<plain_text><page sequence="1">EVIDENCE FOR "LAWS OF NATURE" IN CHINESE THOUGHT DERK BODDE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA INTRODUCTION In the final chapter of the second volume of his study of science in China, Joseph NEPDHAM has demonstrated a difference of signal importance between Chinese and Western thinking. "In Western civilisation," he writes, " the ideas of natural law (in the juristic sense) and of the laws of Nature (in the sense of the natural sciences) go back to a common root. . . . For without doubt one of the oldest notions of western civilisation was that just as earthly imperial lawgivers enacted codes of positive law, to be obeyed by men, so also the celestial and supreme rational creator deity had laid down a series of laws which must be obeyed by minerals, crystals, plants, animals and the stars in their courses." 1 In China, on the other hand, the course of development was radically different, for though a good parallel to the Western con- cept of " natural law " can be found in the body of traditional mores known as 1i 2,2 yet no corresponding development took place for the concept of " laws of Nature." Among NEEDHAM'S several explanations for this fact, probably the most important is that " the autochthonous idea of a supreme being, though cer- tainly present from the earliest times, soon lost the qualities of personality and creativity." Hence, as he then concludes, 1 Cf. Joseph NEEDHAM, Science and Civilisation in China, Vol. II: History of Scientific Thought (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1956), page 518. The following definitions appear on the same page, note a: " I propose to reserve the expression 'natural law' for juridical natural law, i. e., that law which it is natural for all men to obey even in the absence of positive statutes; and 'law or laws of Nature ' for law in the sense in which the term is used in the natural sciences." 2" There was certainly a natural law, namely, that body of customs which the sage-kings and the people had always accepted, i. e. what the Confucians called Ii."

NFEDTAM, 0p. cit.. page 521. 709</page><page sequence="2">710 DERK BODDE The development of the concept of precisely formulated abstract laws capable, because of the rationality of an Author of Nature, of being deciphered and re-stated, did not . . . occur. The Chinese world-view depended upon a totally different line of thought. The harmonious cooperation of all beings arose, not from the orders of a superior authority external to themselves, but from the fact that they were all parts in a hierarchy of wholes forming a cosmic pattern, and what they obeyed were the internal dictates of their own natures.3 Undoubtedly, the consequences of this key divergence between Chinese and Western cosmological thinking have been immense for the development of science on the two sides of the Eurasion continent. In the course of his exposition, NEEDHAM analyzes the signifi- cance of half a dozen or more Chinese juridical terms as found in contexts in which they might conceivably be interpreted as re- ferring to " laws of Nature." One of the most interesting of them is tse FRIJ, used as a noun to mean " rule," " law," " pattern." 4 NEEDHAM begins by citing KARLGREN to the effect that the ancient graph for tse pictured a cauldron and a knife, " in other words," says NEEDHAM, " the very act of incising codes of laws on ritual cauldrons "; only later did the " cauldron " element (radical 206) become corrupted into that for " cowry-shell " (radical 154), the one now appearing in the character.5 NEEDHAM then discusses several passages in which tse occurs, usually in conjunction with the words T'ien k, " Heaven," or Ti or Shang Ti 1*, " Lord " or " Lord on High." They include the following: (a) Book of Odes, no. 260: "Heaven (T'ien) gave birth to the multitudes of people, having bodies, having rules (tse) ." (b) Odes, no. 241, where it is stated that the Lord on High (Shang Ti) commanded King Wen to " conform to the rules (tse) of the Lord (Ti)." (c) Book of Changes, Appendix IV, concerning Hexagram 1: "When it undergoes changes in all the nines, one perceives the rules of Heaven (t'ien tse) ." 6 (d) Hou Han shu [History of the Later Han Dynasty], chapter 89 (biogra- op. cit., page 582.

All these passages (save possibly the last) are either ambiguous or clearly refer to rules laid down for man rather than for natural phenomena; in other words, their analogies (in NEEDHAM'S term- inology) are with "natural law" rather than with "laws of Nature." Furthermore, NEEDHAM finds them counterbalanced by other passages in which it is expressly denied that tse can have any relevance to natural phenomena. Among these are the follow- ing: (a) CHIA I MA, in an ode of ca. 170 B.C., states concerning the generative activities of the universe: " But how can there be fixed rules (ch'ang tse) ? " (b) The Huai-nan-tzu (compiled prior to 19292 B.C.), chapter 9, near beginning, states with reference to the Tao of Heaven that " it follows no rules (tse) ." (c) LIu Tsung-yiian WIJr;x (773-819) states that "Heaven has no color of any kind, no center and no sides-how can you hope to find its rules (tse) ? " NEEDHAM'S general conclusion from the foregoing (op. cit., page 565) is that: It would be of much value for the history of Chinese science to concentrate investigation on other occurrences of the expression Thien tse [rules of Heaven]. But so far as our observations have gone, it is not a common one. The word tse seems to represent a borderline conception. Legal it certainly was, and human too, but though occasionally applied in a scientific or proto-scientific sense, such a use did not seem to " catch on." Here the best support is Chang Heng. The I Ching [Book of Changes] passage is not very decisive, since in a book on divination, where the formation and transmutation of the hexa- grams was supposed to mirror the changing processes of the real world, a strong poetical and symbolic element would be natural, and the implicit relevance to human affairs is brought out by Chu Hsi's commentary, which says: " that the hard should be able to act yieldingly, is Heaven's law (kang erh neng jou, Thien chih fa yeh)." The human relevance is also obvious in the Shih Ching [Book of Odes] verse. Six FURTHER EXAMPLES OF Tse Taking NEEDHAM at his word, the purpose of this article is to examine further occurrences of tse, in an effort to determine whether this conclusion is wholly justified. The first four occur-</page><page sequence="4">712 DERK BODDE rences (and no doubt others could be found) are those iilvolving the term t'ien tse, "rule (or rules) of Heaven." Passage 1. The Huai-nan-tzu, 14/6a, describes the sage as follows: 7 He treads Heaven's Way (Tao), without placing himself first or monopoliz- ing it for himself. He conforms to Heaven's pattern (ii 3E ), without planning in advance or rejecting its proper times. He permits Heaven to set the time, without seeking gain or rejecting good fortune. He follows Heaven's rule,8 without seeking what may be lacking or neglecting what may be gained. This passage, which occurs also in the Wen-tzu t+i9 is neces- sarily inconclusive, since it contains no indication as to whether its " rule of Heaven " applies solely to human affairs or concerns natural phenomena as well. Passage 2. The Ch'ien Han shu [History of the Former Han Dynasty], ch. 22, contains the texts of seventeen " Songs Within the Home for Bringing Peace to the World " (An-shih fang-chung ko M11!d IPW k), probably composed by the Bureau of Music (Yileh Fu Kft) not long after its establishment ca. 120 B.C.; they were intended for ritualistic purposes, the nature of which, however, is not clearly stated in the Ch'ien Han shu. The first two lines of Song 11 read as follows:10 Oh glorious! Oh bountiful! [We] obey Heaven's rule. As is well known, these songs are filled with archaisms and bor- rowings from other texts. For example, the first of the above two lines (P'ing-p'ing i-i ig R ) is a copy of identical phraseology found in the opening sentence of Huai-nan-tzu, chap-ter 3; a con- tracted version (p'ing i) appears in the poem T'ien wen [Questions About Heaven]; " and a variation of the same phrase (yu p'ing yu i ;S,;BMV ) is to be found in Book of Odes, no. 252. This 7All Huai-nan-tzu references are to Liu Wen-tien 1I Huai-nan hung-lieh chi-chieh jijij 0$i (Shanghai: Commercial Press, 1933). 8 Ts'ung t'ien chih tse . Cf.

If this be so, the passage obviously has little value for demonstrating any belief in the " laws of Nature " during the Han dynasty. Passage 3. YANG Chiung 4MP (650-692), in his " Fu Poem on the Armillary Sphere" (Hun T'ien fu M Ri1 ), after de- scribing the functions of the sun, moon, and five planets, has this to say concerning the latter: 12 Looking downward, one examines the affairs of men; Looking upward, one contemplates the rules of Heaven (t'ien tse). Here we again have the echo of a much earlier text, this time Book of Changes, Appendix III, wherein appear two closely similar passages: (a) "Looking upward, one contemplates the signs in Heaven; looking downward, one examines the markings on Earth." (b) " Looking upward, he (Pao Hsi, i. e., Fu Hsi) contemplated the images in Heaven; looking downward, he con- templated the patterns on Earth." 13 The fact that the key terms associated with " Heaven " in these two passages are respectively wen IZ, "signs," and hsiang *, "images," raises the question of why YANG Chiung chose to write tse, " rules," instead of one or the other of these two words. The answer, almost surely, is that in so doing he had no ideological intent, but was motivated solely by the exigencies of rhyme: tse rhymes with te ft, "power," which ends a line four clauses earlier in his poem, wherein he links Saturn to the element or " power " of soil by writing: " This constitutes the power (te) of soil." Obviously, therefore, YANG Chiung's reference to the " rules of Heaven " is as fortuitous as that found in Passage 2 above. 12 Yang Ying-ch'uan chi gtjJII; 1/4a (Ssu-pu ts'ung-k'an edition). 1 Cf. respectively: (a) the translation by LEGGE, page 353; by WILHELM-BAYNES, I.816; (b) the translation by LEGGE, page 382; by WILHELM-BAYNES, I.353.</page><page sequence="6">714 DERK BODDE Passage 4. Lu Chih WR (754-805), in his " Regulations of the King of P'u, Generalissimo of Soldiers and Horse of the Ching- hsiang and Chiang-hsi Circuits " (dated 783) ,14 has the following: When laws are to be proclaimed, they should always be verified according to the rules of Heaven (t'ien tse); When affairs are to be undertaken, they must surely be chosen according to the designs of men. Here, since it is explicitly stated that the laws (of men) are to be verified according to the rules of Heaven, it is evident that the latter can be interpreted only in the sense of " natural law," not of " laws of Nature." All four of these passages are thus either inconclusive or defi- nitely negative insofar as the search for " laws of Nature " is concerned. Much more significant, however, are the two passages that follow: Passage 5. The fifth chapter of the Huai-nan-tzu bears the suggestive title, Shih tse hsiin ?IIJUIII [Teachings on the Rules for the Seasons], on which KAO YU iA2% (ft. 205-212) comments: "Tse (rules) are fa (laws). They are fixed laws (ch'ang fa 1i ?-) for the four seasons, for cold and heat, and for the twelve months. Hence they are spoken of as 'rules for the seasons,' which (phrase) is accordingly used as the title for the chapter." Most of this chapter is identical, or very nearly identical, with the well-known calendrical text, Yiieh ling or " Monthly Com- mands," found in the Book of Rites and, earlier (ca. 240 B.C.), in the Lii-shih ch'un-ch'iu [Spring and Autumn of Mr. Lii]. It describes, month by month, the natural phenomena and human behavior proper to that month, and the dire consequences of practicing in one month the behavior prescribed for another. After concluding its reproduction of the Yiueh ling text, however, the Huai-nan-tzu continues with several pages of additional ma- terial: first (pages 17b-19a), an account of the five directions and the behavior proper to each; then (pages 19a-b), a pairing to- gether of the corresponding months of each season (first month of :"Pu Wang Ching-hsiang Chiang-hsi tao ping-ma Tu-yilan-shuai chih 1j it rr f l jX S 4'Igpt J, in Lu Hsiian-kung chi / , 8/2a (Ssu-pu pei-yao edition).</page><page sequence="7">EVIDENCE FOR " LAWS OF NATURE " IN CHINESE THOUGHT 715 spring with first month of autumn, second month of summer with second month of winter, etc.), describing in each case the harm resulting if the behavior proper to one month in a pair is wrongly practiced in the other; and finally (pages 19b-20a), concludes with the passage relevant to our inquiry, which we therefore translate in full: As the great regulators (chih JIi ) for regulating and measuring the Yin and Yang, there are the six measures (tu ) ): Heaven constitutes the plumb- line (sheng tE), Earth the water-level (chun j ), spring the compass (kuei ,), summer the balancing-scale (heng *f), autumn the T-square (chii W), winter the weighing-scale (ch'iian 4t). [Heaven's] plumb-line serves to align the myriad creatures (wan wu ' Ar), [Earth's] water-level to level them, [spring's] compass to round them, [summer's] balancing-scale to equalize them, [autumn's] T-square to square them, [winter's] weighing-scale to weigh them. The plumb-line [of Heaven], as a measure, is erect and unswerving.15 Draw it out and it has no end. Use it for a long time and it does not wear out. Put it afar and it does not disappear. In its virtue it accords with Heaven and in its brilliance with the spirits.16 What is wished for it obtains, and what is disliked it destroys. From antiquity until today its straightness has re- mained unchangeable. Vast and profound is its virtue, broad and great so that it can contain [the myriad creatures].17 This is why the Lord on High (Shang Ti) uses it as the progenitor of [the myriad] creatures.18 The water-level [of Earth], as a measure, is level and without gradient, even 16 This translation follows Yu Yueh f2it (1821-1907), who interprets cheng V as equivalent to cheng !j, "unswerving." From here to the end of the chapter, the text is in rhyme. 18 This is obviously a telescoped echo of Book of Changes, Appendix IV (translated by LEGGE, page 417; by WILHELM-BAYNES, II.15): "The great man in his virtue accords with Heaven and Earth, in his brilliance with the sun and moon, in his orderly consistency with the four seasons, and in his (relationship to) good and bad fortune with the ghosts and spirits." The sentence fits awkwardly into the rest of our text, since it describes the plumb-line as if it were something entirely external to Heaven, whereas, as we have seen, it is itself the actual instrument or functioning of Heaven. There are other awkward places in our text as well: cases in which the same (or very nearly the same) words or phrases are first used to describe one of the six measuring instruments, and are then applied without distinction to anoher of them. 17 This is seemingly an expanded echo of the Lao-tzu, chapter 21: " The manifesta- tions of its vast virtue (or power). In the Lao-tzu, however, jung t functions as a noun, " manifestations," whereas in our text it is a verb, " to contain." 181 wei uu tsung I KAO YU glosses: "Tsung (progenitor) means pen * (origin)." This seems to be an echo of the Lao-tzu, chapter 4, where it is stated of the Tao that "it is as it were the progenitor (tsung) of the myriad creatures (wan wu)."</page><page sequence="8">716 DERK BODDE and without rise. Broad and great is it, so that it can contain [the myriad creatures]. Wide and all-embracing is it, so that it can harmonize [the myriad creatures]. It is soft and not hard, sharp and not blunt,19 flowing and not stagnant, shifting and not choked.20 It issues forth and communicates accord- ing to a guiding principle (chi *1). It is widespread and profound without being dissipated, and levels and equalizes without error. [Because of it] the myriad creatures are all kept in equilibrium, the people have no dangerous plottings, and resentments and hates do not appear. This is why the Lord on High (Shang Ti) uses it as the equalizer of [the myriad] creatures.21 The compass [of spring], as a measure, revolves without stop,22 makes circles without end,23 and accomodates without permitting undue latitude. Broad and great is it, so that it can embrace [the myriad creatures]. It acts and reacts according to a pattern (ii 3), and issues forth and communicates according to a guiding principle (chi). So accomodating is it, so indulgent, that no resentments ever arise. It measures its circles without error, so that living and breathing [creatures] thereby assume their patterns (ii). The balancing-scale [of summer], as a measure, acts with deliberation yet is not laggard. It equalizes without inducing resentment, extends benefits [for right-doing] without [making a show of] virtue, and expresses sorrow [for wrong-doing] without [making a show of] reproof. It takes care to equalize the people's fortunes, thereby perpetuating [the lives of those who would otherwise suffer] deficiency. Glorious and majestic is it. Only according to virtue does it act. It nurtures, gives growth, transforms and nourishes, so that the myriad creatures abundantly flourish. Thereby it forms the five grains and gives fruition to the demarcated fields.24 Its administration is without error, so that Heaven and Earth thereby become brilliant. The T-square [of autumn], as a measure, is severe but not perverse, hard but not obdurate. It collects without inducing resentment and amasses without inducing harm. Awe-inspiring is it, yet it does not terrify. Its commands operate without being negated. Its deadly punitive attacks, through their efficacy, bring to subjection those who oppose it. It measures its squares correctly and without error, so that all who are condemned to perish thereby submit.25 '9 This clause seems to be an echo of the Lao-tzu, chapter 4 (repeated in chapter 56): " Blunt its sharpness...." " Sharp and not blunt," however, is ideologically inconsistent with the Lao-tzu's " blunt its sharpness," as well as with its own preceding clause, " soft and not hard." I believe, therefore (though this has apparently not been suggested by any of the commentators), that the words have been wrongly inverted at this point and should be emended to read: " blunt and not sharp." 20 Wl'e f, lit. " weeds," here means, I believe, " to be choked (as by weeds)." 21I wei Wub ping Jtfij1 22 This translation follows KAO Yu, who interprets fu 41 as equivalent to o . 281 believe that hlan iR should here be taken as equivalent to wan , "to finish or end." KAO Yu, however, glosses it by chuan I, "to revolve," which to me does not yield sense. 24 Feng chiang I M, lit. "territorial demarcations." 25 This, of course, refers to the dying of plants, insect life, and the like, which comes with autumn.</page><page sequence="9">EVIDENCE FOR " LAWS OF NATURE " IN CHINESE THOUGHT 717 The weighing-scale [of winter], as a measure, acts with urgency but not to excess, and kills but does not afflict. It is full and thereby replete, is wide- spread and profound without being dissipated. It destroys creatures without taking away [from the totality of the universe], and executes the guilty without exception.26 Sincere and true is it so as thereby to be definite, firm and genuine is it so as thereby to be certain. In its sweeping away of hidden evils it cannot be devious. Therefore when the administration of winter is about to operate, it must weaken in order to make strong and must soften in order to make hard.27 It weighs correctly and without error, so that the myriad creatures thereby go into hibernation. The regulations of the Spirit Hall are, for quiescence, to take the water- level as the standard, and, for activity, to take the plumb-line as the stan- dard.28 Spring controls by means of the compass, autumn by means of the T-square, winter by means of the weighing-scale, summer by means of the balancing-scale. In this way dryness and wetness, coldness and heat, arrive at the proper juncture; sweet rain and enriching dew descend at the proper season. While I do not flatter myself that I have caught the exact shades of meaning of all the many adjectives in this passage, its general purport is clear enough and raises several points of interest. First, as to the symbolism, the significance of water as a Taoist symbol of femininity is, of course, well known.29 Hence it is natural that the water-level (described as level, soft, flowing, etc.) should here be correlated with Earth and quiescence; in other words, that it should serve as a symbol of the feminine or Yin aspect of the universe.30 Equally appropriate is it that the plumb- line (described as erect and straight; probably there is a phallic 27 Lit., " without pardoning." 2T This is probably an echo of the Lao-tzu, chapter 36: " If one wishes to weaken something, one must first strengthen it.... The soft and the weak overcome the hard and the strong." 28 In this chapter (as in the Yiieh ling from which it is largely taken) the ruler is said to shift his residence month by month from one to another of the chambers of the Spirit Hall or Ming T'ang f,ilk, moving always in a clockwise direction so as to accord with the shift of seasons. In the second month of spring, for example, he occupies the chamber facing due east, in the second month of summer that facing due south, and so on. By " regulations of the Spirit Hall," therefore, is simply meant the regulations to which man (as well as other creatures) should conform during each successive month of the year. 29 Cf., for example, NEEDHAM, op. cit., pages 57 ff. 80 The phrase, " sharp and not blunt," which, as it stands, obviously does not. conform to this symbolism, should probably, as we have seen (note 19), be emended to " blunt and not sharp."</page><page sequence="10">718 DERK BODDE significance here) should be correlated with Heaven and activity, and thus serve as a symbol of masculinity and the Yang principle. There is likewise reason for correlating the two opposite kinds of measure, the compass and T-square, with the two opposing seasons, spring and autumn; for since the Yang is characterized by roundness and the Yin by squareness, it logically follows that the compass, with its smooth roundness, should be equated with spring, the genial season of growing life and of the waxing Yang, and that the T-square, with its sharp angularity, should be equated with autumn, the severe season of impending death and of the waxing Yin. Less evident is the correlation of the balanc- ing-scale (heng) with summer and the weighing-scale (ch'iian) with winter; properly speaking, heng is the name for the balance- beam of a scale, and ch'iian for its suspended weight. It should be noted, however, that ch'iian also carries the secondary meaning of " power, authority," and this, possibly, is why it is made the symbol of winter, the season which, with its relentless power, destroys and kills living things. The second point of interest is that the metaphor used here of the control of natural phenomena by means of measuring in- struments is by no means original with the Huai-nan-tzu; it al- ready occurs in the Lii-shih ch'un-ch'iu, where, however, the possibility that natural phenomena can be controlled in this way is expressly denied: "The operations of Heaven are profoundly mysterious. It has water-levels for levelling, but it does not use them; it has plumb-lines for setting things upright, but it does not employ them." 31 The probability seems good that it was this very Lii-shih ch'un-ch'iu passage that inspired the unknown author of this Huai-nan-tzu text to develop his own contrary thesis. Interestingly enough, it is also quoted by NEEDHAM (who ignores this Huai-nan-tzu text) to support his counter-contention of " the Chinese denial of a celestial lawgiver [as] an affirmation of Nature's spontaneity and freedom." 8 The final, and most important, point is the evident similarity " Li-shih ch'un-ch'iu, XVII, 2; R. WILHELM, Friihling und Herbst des Lii Bu-we (Jena, 1928), page 266. 32 NEEDHAM, op. cit., page 563, where the reference to Lii-shih ch'un-ch'iu, chapter 94 (consecutive numbering of chapters), should be corrected to chapter 93.</page><page sequence="11">EVIDENCE FOR "LAWS OF NATURE" IN CHINESE THOUGHT 719 between the ideas encountered in this Huai-nan-tzu passage and those underlying the " laws of Nature " in the West. Heaven, Earth, and the four seasons are declared to function as measuring instruments which, with unfailing exactitude, ever "regulate " and " measure " the Yin and Yang, and align, even, and otherwise fit the myriad creatures into their proper relationships. In this way the seasonal movements of natural phenomena occur smooth- ly and without hitch. In spring, living and breathing things assume their appropriate patterns (1i): in other words, their birth and growth take place according to a structured pattern of interrelationships; in summer, Heaven and Earth (conceived at this point as physical entities, not as metaphysical forces) acquire brilliance: in other words, the many growing things in Heaven and Earth then reach the climax of their development; with autumn there comes decay and death for many of these things; and with winter, the season of inactivity, they enter their state of hibernation. Throughout the yearly cycle, wetness and dryness, cold and heat, are caused to arrive at their appointed season. Moreover, it is not only natural phenomena that are thus subject to external controls, for at the same time the people are deterred from dangerous plottings, are prevented from feeling resentments and hates, and have their disparities in (material) fortune equal- ized. This fusing of the natural and human orders is, of course, typically Chinese. Though words like " law " or " rule " nowhere appear in the text proper to describe these processes, the entire imagery cer- tainly suggests that these take place in conformity to fixed laws, to which the natural and human worlds alike are subject. This supposition is strongly confirmed, as we have seen, by the title of the chapter, " Rules (tse) for the Seasons," and by KAo Yu's interpretation of these tse as "fixed laws (ch'ang fa) for the four seasons, for cold and heat, and for the twelve months." Furthermore (and this is especially significant in view of the anthropomorphism from which arose the Western concept of " laws of Nature "), a supreme divine being is stated to exercise supervision over the whole operation: Shang Ti, the " Lord on High," who uses Heaven's plumb-line as the "progenitor" of</page><page sequence="12">720 DERK BODDE the myriad creatures, Earth's water-level as their " equalizer," and who presumably (though this is not explicitly mentioned) exercises similar control over the other measuring and regulating activities of the four seasons. In short, there seems to be a reason- ably complete parallelism here between the Chinese thinking and the " laws of Nature " in the West. Passage 6. The final tse passage, though only one sentence long, is in a way even more significant because-as happens so seldom in Chinese philosophical texts-it actually defines the word with which it is concerned. Its source is the Kuan-tzu , opening section of chapter 6, Ch'i fa tm, "The Seven Standards (or Laws) ." 3 The theme of this opening section is that both good govern- ment and success in war depend upon an adequate understanding of seven naturalistic or psychological factors, which are called the " seven standards " and are first enumerated and then successively defined in single sentences for each. They are as follows: (1) tse, "rules "; (2) hsiang A, "(physical) entities " (defined as those things which have name, shape, lie within the confines of time, etc.); (3) fa 9, " standards (of measurement) " (defined as the foot-rule, plumb-line, compass, etc.); (4) hua ft, " (pro- cesses of) transformation" (defined as operating gradually, smoothly, through repetitive practice, etc.); (5) chiieh-sai M-K, " permissive or inhibitory (types of action) " (defined as giving or taking, benefiting or harming, letting live or killing, etc.); (6) hsin-shu ZI4lJf, " mental arts (or activities)" (defined as involving sincerity, generosity, altruism, etc.); and (7) chi-shu 714;, " sta- tistical calculations " (defined as involving size, distance, amount, and other measurable qualities) . Some of these " standards " and their accompanying definitions are indeed obscure and difficult to understand, but fortunately the definition of tse, " rules," is admirably lucid and simple. It reads as follows: What are basic to the [Yin and Yang] ethers of Heaven and Earth, to the 8 Kuan-tzu 2/lb (Ssu-pu ts'ung-k'an edition), which is translated in Lewis A. MAVERICK, editor, Economic Dialogues in Ancient China: Selections from the Kuan-tzu (Carbondale, Ill., 1954), pages 53-54, where, however, this particular sentence is mistranslated and misunderstood.</page><page sequence="13">EVIDENCE FOR "LAWS OF NATURE" IN CHINESE THOUGHT 721 harmonious balance between cold and heat, to the properties of water and soil, to the existence of human beings, birds, animals, plants and trees; and which things, despite their extreme abundance, all possess as standards (chiin), yet which never undergo change [thermselves]-such are called " rules " (tse) .34 Here we are told that tse are basic to human, animal, and plant life, to climatic phenomena and inorganic matter-in other words, to categories which cover and more than cover those discussed in our preceding Huai-nan-tzu passage. All things, despite their multiplicity, possesses these tse as standards, and yet the tse themselves never undergo change. It can hardly be doubted that we are here confronted with what in the West would be called " laws of Nature." Unfortunately, the remainder of the section says nothing further of importance concerning these tse. On pages lb-2a we are merely told: " Hoping to set up standards and for- mulate institutions while yet remaining ignorant of tse would be like hoping to determine [the direction of] sunrise and sunset on a revolving potter's wheel."35 And again a few lines further (page 2a): " Therefore it is said that to set up standards and formulate institutions without knowing the tse is impossible." CONCLUSION In view of the testimony provided by the foregoing Huai-nan- tzu and Kuan-tzu passages, some readers may perhaps be willing at this point to reconsider the significance of one or two of the passages cited earlier, notably that quoted by NEEDHAM from CHANG Heng's biography (" The steps of Heaven follow fixed 2W4, @k?,,I q'J . I have made two emendations: (a) The negative pu (which appears between &lt; &gt; and causes the text to read: " Things, despite their non-extreme abundance . . .") is obviously incorrect and should be deleted. (b) The sequence of characters in the following clause, chieh chiin yu (" all equally possess ") should probably be corrected to chieh yu chiin (" all possess as standards"). For these emendations, cf. Hst Wei-yii in Kuo Mo-jo ;RMZS, WEN I-to rgJ- :, Kuan-tzu chi-chiao ; and Hsu wei-yi jti (Peking: Science Publishers [K'o-hsuieh Ch'u-pan She], 1956), page 82.

Even, were we cautiously to hold to the earlier decision to reject such pas- sages entirely on grounds of ambiguity, the remaining evidence from Passages 5 and 6 is quite sufficient, in my opinion, to demon- strate that at least a few early Chinese thinkers viewed the uni- verse in terms strikingly similar to those underlying the Western concept of " laws of Nature." On the other hand, I do not feel it suffices to overthrow NEEDHAM'S main contention: namely, that the prevailing trend of Chinese speculation moved along a very different path-that of a self-contained, self-operating, " organis- mic" universe. Undoubtedly, too, as he makes clear, this trend became more pronounced in the course of time, especially with the rise of Neo-Confucianism.36 The Kuan-tzu chapter containing my Passage 6 does not seem to belong to any clearly defined school of thought, nor can it be precisely dated; perhaps it is third century B.C., but conceivably it could be either earlier or (more probably) later. Fortunately, however, the situation with the long Huai-nan-tzu passage is much more clear: it belongs to the second century B.C. (early Han dynasty), is evidently a product of " Yin-Yang and Five Elements" cosmology (though with obvious Taoist admixture, as indicated by its many echoes from the Lao-tzu., as well as its water symbolism), and contains a strong tincture of anthropo- morphic thinking (an important ingredient, as we have seen, in the Western " laws of Nature ") . The combination of these facts is significant, for the Han was both an age in which the " Yin-Yang and Five Elements " think- ing reached its height, and also one in which there seems to have been an archaistic throwback to much earlier anthropomorphic conceptions-exemplified, for instance, in the philosophy of such a man as TUNG Chung-shu f{+ (179?-104? B.C.).3 Further- more, we know that the " Yin-Yang and Five Elements " writers, " Cf. NEEDHAM, op. cit., pages 565-570. " Although TUNG attributed personality to Heaven and conceived of it as giving commands to man, he did not, as NEEDHAM makes clear, go to the length of saying that it likewise commands non-human things-for example, the stars-to behave in the way they do.

NEEDHAM, op. cit., page 548.</page><page sequence="15">EVIDENCE FOR " LAWS OF NATURE " IN CHINESE THOUGHT 723 both before and during the Han dynasty, suffered from an ambi- valence in their thinking (of which they themselves were seem- ingly unconscious), which caused them, when speculating on the interrelationships between the natural and human worlds, to waver between a teleological and a mechanistic (perhaps it would be better to say a naturalistic) explanation.38 In conclusion, therefore, I would suggest that if, as seems very possible, further evidences of " laws of Nature " are to be found in Chinese literature, they should be sought in the cosmological writings of the Han dynasty (including surviving fragments from its apocryphal or wei 4 texts), as well as, possibly, in certain texts of later date preserved in the Taoist Canon, wherein ideas similar to those widely current in the Han were perpetuated. APPENDIX Comments by Joseph NEEDHAM and Author's Rejoinder In a letter dated October 15, 1957, Dr. NEEDHAM has taken the trouble of commenting at some length on the foregoing paper, a copy of which was sent to him in advance of publication. I am deeply indebted to Dr. NEEDHAM for these interesting comments, pertinent excerpts from which are reproduced below, accompanied by further remarks by myself which have been stimulated by them. 1. Concerning the long Huai-nan-tzu passage, Dr. NEEDHAM begins by saying: Your fifth quotation from Huai Nan Tzu is indeed an interesting one.... At first sight it certainly does seem to say that the ruler above (Shang Ti) uses the plumb- line of heaven as the progenitor of all things, and the water-level of earth as the equaliser of all things. However, I wonder whether you ought not to consider the possibility that Shang Ti here refers to the ancient rulers (hsien wang, as one might say), the word shang being taken in the sense of shang ku, ancient, rather than heaven above. This interpretation . . . would mean that the ancient sage kings used the plumb-line as the progenitor of all things and the water-level as their equaliser. As illustrations for this hypothesis, Dr. NEEDHAM then cites three passages from the well-known medical text, Nei ching (which he dates " at least as early as the Huai Nan Tzu "): (a) Nei ching 9/6b: "This is what the ancient emperors (shang ti) kept as a secret " (followed by the gloss of the T'ang commentator WANG Ping: "Shang ti means the emperors and princes of old "); (b) 13/4a: " The study of the color of the patient and the pulse 88 Cf. FUNG Yu-lan, A History of Chinese Philosophy, translated by D. BODDE (Princeton, 1952-53), I.163; II.58.</page><page sequence="16">724 DERK BODDE was highly honored by the ancient emperors (shang ti) " (followed by an identical gloss by WANG Ping); (c) 13/4b: " When the ancient emperors (shang ti) heard of the Tao, they did their utmost to follow it." My comment here is that there is a wide difference in context between the Nei ching and the Huai-nan-tzu. For on the one hand, it is entirely natural to think of the shang ti (meaning " ancient emperors ") as studying the pulse and doing the other things mentioned in the former work. But on the other hand, the idea that any human beings-even those as wise as the " ancient emperors "~-can have the power or even the thought of controlling natural phenomena by means of Heaven's plumb-line and Earth's water-level, seems to me decidedly unlikely, especially in such a Taoist text as the Huai-nan-tzu. 92. Dr. NEEDHAM continues: I must say that when I read your article first it seemed to me quite convincing, but later on I began to have doubts as to whether I had ever seen the expression Shang Ti in a Han text as meaning "God." One is of course fully accustomed to interpreting it in this way in texts of the early Chou period, but can you give us some convincing examples of the use of Shang Ti for " God " as late as the Han? To do this is admittedly not easy, since, as is well-known, the unitary Shang Ti of Shang and early Chou times had, by the Han, become multiplied (under the influence of the five-element theories) into five Shang Ti or " Lords on High " (also known as the Wu Ti or " Five Lords "); the absence of inflection in the language of course made such a transition relatively easy. Conceivably, therefore, the Shang Ti of our Huai-nan-tzu text should be construed as referring to a group of five and not to a single deity. In such a case the text would still retain that anthropomorphism which, as we have seen, helps to make it reminiscent of writings about " laws of Nature " in the West. Quite aside, however, from the philosophical objection (perhaps merely a Western prejudice) against the idea of cosmic phenomena being controlled in this way by five rather than a single deity, there is excellent evidence within our text itself to show that its Shang Ti should almost surely be understood in the singular rather than the plural. Thus it is well-known, of course, that in early Chou times, when Shang Ti was indubitably unitary, its name was often joined to that of T'ien, " Heaven "; a good example is the phrase Huang - T'ien Shang Ti, " Sovereign Heaven Lord on High," found in the Book of History.' Now it so happens that this identical phrase also occurs twice in the Yiieh ling, where, therefore, Shang Ti can likewise be only a single god.2 Since most of the Huai-nan-tzu's fifth chapter is a close copy of the Yiieh ling, it is natural that the same two references should occur there as well (pp. 9a and 17a). By this time, of course, such a phrase as Huang T'ien Shang Ti had become a decided archaism. Nevertheless, its presence in our text virtually assures the fact that when our author later goes on to speak ' Shu ching, V, 12; tr. LEGGE, Sacred Books of the East, III, p. 184. 2 Under the last months of summer and winter we are told that sacrificial animals are raised so as to be used as offerings to Huang T'ien Shang Ti, as well as other deities. See Li chi, ch. 4; tr. LEGGE, Sacred Books of the East, XXVII, pp. 278, 309.</page><page sequence="17">EVIDENCE FOR " LAWS OF NATURE " IN CHINESE THOUGHT 725 of Shang Ti as using Heaven's plumb-line and Earth's water-level, it is the Shang Ti of early times which he has in mind, rather than the five divinities by that name which had become current in his own day.3 8. Dr. NEEDHAM comments further: In any case, even if we could substantiate the meaning of Shang Ti as " God " in the Huai Nan Tzu passage, I still feel on the philosophical side that the picture with which we are presented is rather that of God as an artisan, mechanic or engineer, rather than a legislator. " Controlling natural phenomena by means of instruments " is not quite the same thing as laying down laws which the phenomena have to follow, in the same way as human beings on earth have to follow the laws of legislating princes. In other words, the metaphor seems to be different. Different in outward form this metaphor assuredly is, and yet there would seem to be a close relationship between the idea of a deity who legislates natural phenomena and that of one who guides and controls them by means of measuring instruments. At this point I feel that Dr. NEEDHAM is not wholly consistent with the viewpoint he has expressed in his book, wherein he devotes a special section (pp. 553-554) to an analysis of the word tu (" a measure or " to measure "), concerning which he has this to say: Its implication may be that of "Law," especially when it is found in combinations such as chih tu or fa tu, " systematic rules and laws." . . . There is a close semantic connection between "law " and " measure," for every law has a certain quantitative aspect. . . There are to be found, among the writings of the philosophers of the Warring States and Han periods, numerous analogies between law in human societies, and the carpenter's square, the compasses and the plumb-line. Now not only does this same word tu appear prominently in several places of our Huai-nan-tzu text; but, in its opening sentence, it is even coupled with the word chih just cited by Dr. NEEDHAM in the binom chih tu. The sentence in question, it will be remembered, opens with the words: "As the great regulators (chih) for regulating (chih) and measuring (tu) the Yin and Yang, there are the six measures (tu)." Furthermore, as we have also seen 3 Since writing the foregoing, I have come across the identical phrase, Huang T'ien Shang Ti, in WANG Mang's proclamation of A.D. 7, issued in response to the rebellion of CHAI I in which WANG states: " This is how the Sovereign Heaven Lord on High (huang t'ien shang ti) has brought peace to our Tmperial House." In the same proclamation WANG Mang furthermore twice uses the phrase, shang ti ming if (Mandate of the Lord on High), as in the sentence: " I dare not mistake the Mandate of the Lord on High," or again in a passage about "understanding the Mandate of the Lord on High." In both cases YEN Shih-ku (581-645) glosses shang ti ming as t'ien ming, " the Mandate of Heaven." See Han shu 84/4b-5a (Chung-hua Book Co. photolithic 1923 reprint of the 1739 Palace edition). There can be no doubt that the Shang Ti here spoken of by WANG Mang is the same as the unitary Shang Ti of antiquity, the more so as WANG'S proclamation is explicitly stated by the Han shu to have been modelled on the " Great Announcement " in the Book of History (Shu ching, V, 7; LEGGE, op. cit., pp. 156-161).</page><page sequence="18">726 DERK BODDE (text above note 31), Dr. NEEDHAM himself quotes another passage about water-levels and plumb-lines from the Lii-shih ch'un-ch'iu (wherein denial is made that Heaven makes use of such instruments), precisely in order to support his own contention that the idea of " a celestial lawgiver " was absent from China. Finally, as already several times remarked, the obstinate fact remains that our Huai-nan-tzu author (or at least his editor) chose to entitle his essay " Rules (tse) for the Seasons," and that his commentator then explicitly defined these as " fixed laws (ch'ang fa) for the four seasons, for cold and heat, and for the twelve months." Obviously, therefore, there was for these two Chinese a conviction that a close relationship does exist between the idea of legislating natural phenomena and that of controlling them through measurement. 4. Dr. NEEDHAM'S final comment concerns our Kuan-tzu quotation: Coming now to your last passage from the sixth chapter of Kuan Tzu, I quite agree that the word tse is used here in the sense of the basic constancies which are at the bottom of all natural phenomena, standards which never themselves undergo change in spite of the myriad changes of the individuals. However, I do not feel that you have proved by this passage the conception of rules imposed by a trans- cendent legislator. The rules could surely very easily be thought of as internal, as in the examples of the use of tse which we ourselves have given, and there is nothing in the Kuan Tzu text, important though it is, which seems to me to indicate belief in a transcendent being acting as a legislator for created beings. It seems to me that the beings referred to in this text are not necessarily created, and need not be obeying external rules, but rather the intemal rules proper to their own natures. This comment particularly struck me because of its close similarity to that expressed by a University of Pennsylvania colleague, the mathematician Hans RADEMACHER, when I happened to read to him the Kuan-tzu passage. There seemed to him no need to construe the tse of the Kuan-tzu as being rules or laws that are externally imposed upon the creatures, things and phenomena to which they pertain. Rather, so it seemed to him, they signify the qualities, natures, or tending forces-perhaps, one might almost say, the entelechies- which are inherent in these various categories. Admittedly, I have no ready means of disproving this interpretation, inde- pendently reached on opposite sides of the Atlantic. And yet, if it is really correct, I cannot help but wonder why the Kuan-tzu chose to use the word tse rather than some other word that would more clearly express this idea- for example, hsing , " nature," or ch'ing p, " quality." For in the purely human sphere, as we have seen, tse commonly means a man-made rule or law, while in the phrase t'ien tse it seems to signify the rules or laws which Heaven has promulgated for man to follow. In either case it is a norm or standard imposed from above upon those who are its subjects. Why, then, in a passage where it is broadened to cover the varied facets of the non-human as well as human world, should we assume that it no longer bears this objective and external significance, and conclude instead that it connotes " the internal rules proper to their own natures " ? In the Kuan-tzu's definition of these tse-its statement that they remain ever unchanging despite the multiplicity of things for which they serve as</page><page sequence="19">EVIDENCE FOR "LAWS OF NATURE" IN CHINESE THOUGHT 727 standards (chiun) -I personally find a suggestion of universality and objec- tivity attributed in the human world to codes of law. Of course, what I am expressing is a purely subjective opinion, so that it must remain for the reader to decide for himself which interpretation seems to him more plausible. Postscript In a second letter dated November 28, 1957, Dr. NEEDHAM makes the following comments on the foregoing Appendix, a copy of which, as in the case of the original article, was sent to him in advance of publication: Our only points are: 1. Re the long Huai-nan-tzu passage, I fear we still feel reluctant to regard Shang Ti as necessarily God rather than the hsien wang [ancient rulers] in this place. We have been strengthened in our preference by the fact that the passage concludes with a piece about the Ming T'ang [Spirit Hall], an institution very much concerned with the rule of the ancient emperors. 2. You are right that I stressed the connection between law and measure in Vol. II, yet nevertheless, I still feel that there is a difference in theological conception between a deity who operates a system of measures and one who creates all measures and measurers and things measured from nothingness. Your new appendix will make interesting reading, for nothing is more stimulating than exchanges of opinion.</page></plain_text>
