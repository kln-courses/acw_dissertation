<plain_text><page sequence="1">TOWARD A NEW NATURE POETRY Robert Kern Out of doors one becomes abstract and impersonal. One's individuality ab solutely leaves one. And then Nature is so indifferent, so unappreciative. Whenever I am walking in the park here I always feel that I am no more to her than the cattle that browse on the slope, or the burdock that blooms in the ditch. Nothing is more evident than that Nature hates Mind. —Oscar Wilde, "The Decay of Lying" (1889) I in his important book, The Poetry of Experience, Robert Langbaum calls attention to the paradox that nature poetry since the Romantics has declined in importance precisely because of their success with it.1 His argument implies that the sheer frequency with which poets from Wordsworth on turned to nature for subject and setting began at a certain point to yield diminishing returns. The image of nature hardened into a convention that became less and less capable of ac commodating new experience or arousing fresh response. In short, nature became a cliché, and realizing this, later poets were prompted to search for settings and perspectives other than natural ones. An actual look at the poetry of the last 150 years, however, suggests not so much a flight from nature poetry as a flight—often reluctant— from a certain conception of nature. When we move from Wordsworth's "Tintern Abbey" to Tennyson's "In Memoriam" to Eliot's The Waste Land, we are confronted less by a declining nature poetry than by a sharply waning belief in the kind of nature that the Romantics experienced and wrote about. Langbaum himself takes up this argument in a later essay called "The New Nature Poetry," where he points out that the Romantic view of nature was based ultimately on Newtonian physics, with its projection of a universe so orderly and law-abiding that it pointed directly to the God who had created it.2 With the advent of Victorian science, particularly geology and Darwinian evolution, the benevolent and orderly nature of the Romantics began to look more and more like its nightmare opposite, 1 The Poetry of Experience (1957; rpt.

Wordsworth's sense of divine presence— Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns, And the round ocean, and the living air, And the blue sky, and in the mind of man3 —could not sustain itself against the possibility that the earth and its creatures, including man, had evolved without plan or guidance. God could no longer be found in nature and could certainly not be iden tified with it; he had, to echo J. Hillis Miller's phrase, disappeared from his creation.4 So what was there to write about? Only the Waste Land—the death cry of a civilization estranged from any sustaining principle, a civiliza tion that could affirm nothing, inspire no belief, that, at best, could only assert need. The very notion of the Waste Land of course is Eliot's most elaborate objective correlative for the modern spiritual condition, a natural reflection of a desperate human situation. As such, it is directly opposed to Wordsworth's sense of "something far more deeply interfused" in nature, a landscape totally uninformed by divine purpose or presence. If the kind of nature poetry the Romantics had been able to write underwent a decline, then, this resulted less from its being so success ful as to discourage imitation than from the fact that it seemed to be based on a lie, an illusion about the relationships among man, God and nature that the subsequent history of poetry, with its anxious awareness of the latest developments in science, could no longer evade. But the situation evoked more than one kind of response. Some poets (Hardy is Langbaum's example) were aroused to bitterness and pessimism by the apparently gloomy facts. A somewhat earlier writer like Matthew Arnold spoke to the whole issue in terms of a catastrophic sense of loss. In "The Buried Life," for instance, his con viction that the most authentic life of the self is connected with and governed by nature is undermined by the very sparseness of his natural imagery, which suggests just how inaccessible that authentic life has become. Even more poignant is the fact that many of Arnold's references to nature in the poem are also allusions to Wordsworth, 3"Lines composed a few miles above Tintern Abbey," The Poetical Works of William Wordsworth, ed. E. de Selincourt (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1944), II, 262. 4 The Disappearance of God (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1963). 1 am in debted, in a general way, to the work of J.

Williams in Poets of Reality (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1966). 199</page><page sequence="3">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW and as such they are (or at least now seem to be) the barest echoes of what was once a fuller and less self-conscious lyricism: When our world-deafen'd ear Is by the tones of a loved voice caress'd— A bolt is shot back somewhere in our breast, And a lost pulse of feeling stirs again. The eye sinks inward, and the heart lies plain, And what we mean, we say, and what we would, we know. A man becomes aware of his life's flow, And hears its winding murmur; and he sees The meadows where it glides, the sun, the breeze.5 Arnold's buried life is not only a life of unified sensibility but a re possession of the deepest human instincts that has all the force of a return to Eden, a recovery of an Unfällen condition. Yet the distance between Arnold and Wordsworth, whose "Intimations of Immor tality" ode is distinctly recalled in this poem, can be measured by con sidering that while Wordsworth's poetry is so often rooted in his con crete experience in nature, Arnold's, at least here, is rooted in Wordsworth.6 What is being mourned is not so much the loss of nature as the loss of the Wordsworthian response to nature construed as a general condition of consciousness—the undivided response of the whole human being who speaks out of the only paradise fallen man can know, the paradise within, which is what the eye sees when it "sinks inward" and discovers the transparency of the heart, a unity of being that awakens the senses to a further unity between human life and its natural circumstances. In this respect, of course, it is ironic that in the "Intimations" ode, so much more generalized than his earlier poems, Wordsworth himself is mourning this same loss (though he finds recompense for it in the "philosophic mind," of which the poem is already an expression). Yet it is precisely the analytic and general quality of Arnold's poem, s The Poetical Works of Matthew Arnold, ed. C. B. Tinker and H. F. Lowry (London: Oxford University Press, 1950), p. 247. These lines seem to be Arnold's version of what Wordsworth calls seeing "into the life of things." But whereas for Arnold the experience is an awakening of the senses to an awareness of "our true, original course," for Wordsworth it is a transcendent, meiaphysical experience in which "we are laid asleep / In body, and become a living soul." Both experiences, however, provide relief from a "world" that is deafening in Arnold's case and "heavy," "weary," and "unintelligible" in Wordsworth's. 6Cf. Arnold's lines: "Yet still, from time to time, vague and forlorn, / From the soul's subter ranean depth upborne / As from an infinitely distant land, / Come airs, and floating echoes, and convey / A melancholy into all our day" with these from Wordsworth's "Ode": "Those shadowy recollections, / Which, be they what they may, / Are yet the fountain light of all our day." Significantly, Wordsworth's "shadowy recollections" are perceived as a controlling in fluence of some power, while Arnold's "airs, and floating echoes" are merely a reminder of loss, of the infinite distance separating ordinary life from its authentic sources. 200</page><page sequence="4">NATURE POETRY its presentation of a condition equally regarded as more than private or personal, that raises questions for us about the true subject of nature poetry, or at least about the function of natural imagery. Ar nold's buried life, the poem suggests, is actually recovered not through experience in nature but through the agency of human relationship. To be in an authentic relationship is to regain a state of being whose poetic expression in natural imagery is not only traditional but in stinctive. Thus nature provides a vocabulary of feeling, a way of talk ing about the positive results of such relationship. Of course alienation from others and alienation from nature are parts of the same general condition, the burying of the true self by the processes of modern life. But apparently recovery of the one is also recovery of the other. This might be put more directly in terms of Arnold's literary relationship to Wordsworth. If, from Arnold's point of view, Wordsworth is the Adam of modern nature poetry and is able to write about nature as experience,7 for the fallen Arnold its status has been reduced to that of metaphor, a way of talking about experience, and one of the public or historical meanings of this literary development is Arnold's subject—man's increasing separateness from nature, his growing alienation from genuine life. But if nature ceases to be itself and becomes a metaphor, it still remains a sign of what is most authentic in human existence, and of an authenticity that can be recovered. That is, it retains, for a writer like Arnold, its status as an ultimate source of value in human life, and the significance of this for nature poetry is that it will survive, in however attenuated a form, so long as poets can maintain some sense of positive relation between man and nature, so long as there is some felt connection between nature and human destiny. What is now suggested, however, is that nineteenth-century poets, by and large, never really write about nature but merely about themselves in terms of nature. This, at any rate, may be the most critical implication of Ruskin's formulation of the "pathetic fallacy," his term for the kind of writing that results from the projection of human meaning onto something without human content.8 Even a pes simistic attitude, such as Hardy's, implies a sense of connection, the 'In the preface to his 1879 edition of The Poems of Wordsworth, Arnold writes that "Wordsworth's poetry, when he is at,his best, is inevitable, as inevitable as Nature herself. It might seem that Nature not only gave him the matter for his poem, but wrote his poem for him. He has no style." This essay, entitled "Wordsworth," appears in the Second Series of Arnold's Essays in Criticism, 2nd ed. (1895; rpt. London: Macmillan, 1915), pp. 122-62. 8 See "Of the Pathetic Fallacy" in Modern Painters, III, Part IV, Chap. XII; in The Works of John Ruskin, ed. E. T. Cook and A.

At least this is the common view of Hardy, based on the dramatization of malevolent circumstance in his novels. In a poem like "Nature's Questioning," however, both the landscape and its human observer are seen to be victims of the same condition, a creation gone sour through neglect or lack of control or indifference: When I look forth at dawning, pool, Field, flock, and lonely tree, All seem to gaze at me Like chastened children sitting silent in a school; Their faces dulled, constrained, and worn, As though the master's ways Through the long teaching days Had cowed them till their early zest was overborne. Upon them stirs in lippings mere (As if once clear in call, But now scarce breathed at all)— "We wonder, ever wonder, why we find us here!

Meanwhile the winds, and rains, And Earth's old glooms and pains Are still the same, and Life and Death are neighbours nigh.9 How easily, in Hardy's transcription of the landscape's appearance ("Thus things around"), "the winds, and rains" becomes "Earth's old glooms and pains." Neutral objective description in the first phrase 1 The Collected Poems of Thomas Hardy (London: Macmillan, 1952), pp. 58-9. 202</page><page sequence="6">NATURE POETRY gives way in the second to a language saturated with human meaning and subjective bias, an unacknowledged metaphor for the speaker's own state of mind. Unable to supply an answer to "nature's questioning," the poem's speaker becomes himself a questioner, and in recognizing the landscape as a fellow-sufferer, completes his iden tification with it. But after Ruskin it is precisely the poet's attitude that can no longer be of any consequence, at least not if he is really interested in looking at nature or rendering experience of it. For what is now proposed is that the sense of connection implied by the traditional attitude or by the new pessimistic one that we hear in Hardy is false, an illusion, precisely the pathetic fallacy, from the perspective of which the problem with nature poetry is that all too often it turns nature into a stage for the externalization and enactment of the poet's feelings and natural objects into the objective correlatives of private experience. And the persistence of this kind of writing can only mean that its authors are emotionally and certainly technically unprepared to give up the old view of nature, the old sense of connection, regardless of their attitudes or scientific sophistication. The unavoidable result is sentimentality of the kind (though not always the degree) that Ruskin himself cites in these lines by Charles Kingsley: They rowed her in across the rolling foam— The cruel, crawling foam.10 Thus the later nineteenth-century poet, in his dealings with nature, is reduced to the role of disappointed lover, responding in a variety of negative ways—from elegy to bitterness—to the end of an affair. II If, for the most part, nineteenth-century poets were reluctant to acknowledge, in their work, the end of the affair, even after its end had been declared in areas other than poetry, have twentieth-century poets come much further? Is there really a new nature poetry? The question cannot be answered by simply pointing to a new sense of nature communicated by modern poets, by viewing their work as a transcendence of an outmoded concept. An answer must also include recognition of the problems confronting poets as poets in their attempt to deal with a new concept. For the combination of assaults against 10 Ruskin, 205. 203</page><page sequence="7">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW earlier styles of nature poetry represented by new advances in science on the one hand and literary criticism like Ruskin's on the other sug gests not only that the traditional conception of nature is due for revi sion but that the use of nature as a source of metaphor for human ex perience might be invalid. As the sense of connection between nature and human destiny dissolves under these assaults, poets sensitive to the process find themselves suddenly bereft of a long tradition of con ventional procedures and responses. What is needed is almost a new language, or at least a radically altered one, to fit the altered sense of reality. Certainly to use metaphor in the old way, to persist in the habit of anthropomorphism, of imposing human significance on ob jects and events that have none, is to insist on a connection that no longer exists. In other words, the problem is not simply conceptual or philosophical but linguistic and technical, a problem of language and poetics. In terms of the history of nature poetry, the first step toward its renewal must be the achievement of an attitude toward nature that goes beyond either an optimistic or pessimistic view of our connection with it, that transcends any human feelings based on a sense of what our relationship with nature might be. The problem with nature poetry, from a modern perspective, is that there is not enough real nature in it and too much of what Charles Olson, in what amounts to a restatement of Ruskin's pathetic fallacy, has called "lyrical in terference of the individual as ego, of the 'subject' and his soul . . And for Robert Langbaum the "new" nature poetry is defined precisely by a retreat from anthropomorphism, by a sense of nature as something totally other, without human meaning. Yet this awareness too, once achieved, is not easy to embrace or to live with, and part of the point I want to make is that a good deal of modern nature poetry, for all its apparent recognition of the otherness of nature, for all its care to avoid the pathetic fallacy and to see nature as in itself it really is, has not fully come to terms with it, at least not to the point where comfortable coexistence is a possibility. Even in poets whom Langbaum puts forward (prematurely, I am suggesting) as exemplars of the new attitude, there is a fear of the nonhuman universe that the new view of nature posits and, sometimes, an awareness of a threat to poetry itself posed by such a view. The example of D. H. Lawrence, who for Langbaum "sets the style ""Projective Verse," Selected Writings of Charles Olson, ed. Robert Creeley (New York: New Directions, 1966), p. 24. 204</page><page sequence="8">NATURE POETRY for the new nature poetry,"12 is instructive here, for Lawrence, in resisting the pathetic fallacy, goes to the opposite extreme and makes his poems express, almost with relish, man's complete alienation in the natural world. The whole point of some of his animal poems, especial ly "Fish," which Langbaum quotes, is to dramatize a shocked con frontation between the speaker, ultimately the reader, and an alien form of life, to establish a felt discontinuity between them. Certainly there is little chance here for the kind of identification with nature that Hardy indulges, but Lawrence seems to revel in a nature "red in tooth and claw" not because this is the truth about nature but because of its implications for a narrow anthropocentrism. After evoking, as Langbaum puts it, "the horror and beauty of [the fish's] utterly alien life," Lawrence draws his conclusion: And my heart accused itself Thinking: I am not the measure of creation. This is beyond me, this fish. His God stands outside my God.13 The primary interest here seems to be in this accusation, in making the reader feel his own limits before a nonhuman universe. Lawrence wants to jar the reader out of any complacent or comfortable sense of relationship with nature, to bring home to him its strangeness and mystery and to make him feel his lack of harmony with it. But as nature poetry, this kind of writing seems more like a dead end than a fresh start. In spite of Lawrence's ultimate desire to repair the split, to return man not only to his sources in nature but to his own body, the recognition of otherness here becomes a defeat for man, a disillusioned awareness not only of difference but of inferiority that leaves little room for reconciliation. The speaker, forced to confront his suddenly diminished status within "creation," perceives the fish as "beyond" him, with a "God" superior to his own, and the intent of such language, which still proceeds from a specifically human perspective, is clearly to deprive man of his dominance in nature, or his illusion of it. Lawrence's attitude here could be described as anti-Baconian, but it is as much an overstatement about man's inferiority in nature as Baconian humanism is the opposite. The most likely result of such a poem, given its emphasis on difference and discontinuity, is a retreat into humanity rather than a positive return to nature. From its 12 The Modern Spirit, p. 114. 13 Ibid., pp. 114-15. 205</page><page sequence="9">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW perspective, the possibilities of a nature poetry become severely limited. What I am arguing, then, is that much of the writing which Langbaum claims to constitute a new nature poetry, a revival based on a new philosophical understanding, is in fact still reeling from the shocks which eroded the old way of writing about nature in the latter half of the nineteenth century. There is perhaps even more of a con tinuity between nineteenth and twentieth century literature here than Langbaum acknowledges. In considering poets like Swinburne and Hardy, he says that "both were being anthropomorphic still, at a time when the exciting new concept, the only one that could inspire convic tion, was that of the mindlessness of nature, its nonhuman otherness—a concept attempting at least to transcend optimism and pessimism."14 Yet it is hard to discover much enthusiasm for the new concept among the poets Langbaum considers (with the possible ex ception of Lawrence, who uses it to undermine the assumptions of an overly confident humanism). More often than not, the new view of nature inspires not conviction but a subtle terror, and the poets who subscribe to it seem ultimately to withdraw from the very world they evoke. The necessity to transcend optimism and pessimism is recognized, but such transcendence is hardly ever achieved. Ill As a way of substantiating some of these claims, I propose now to look closely at three poems, two of which are dealt with by Langbaum in his survey of the new nature poetry, while the last, the only real exam ple of a new nature poetry to my mind, was only published in the year that Langbaum's essay appeared. At the risk of oversimplification, I want to argue that Robert Frost's "Come In," Wallace Stevens's "The Snow Man," and "Mid-August at Sourdough Mountain Lookout" by Gary Snyder constitute, in this order, a hypothetical pat tern of development for nature poetry over the last hundred years. Together, the three poems suggest the following scenario: Frost tries to write about nature in the old way, but in realizing that he no longer can, finds himself at an impasse which calls into question the very pos sibility of poetry. Stevens offers a solution which amounts to a reversal of Frost's position and which starts from an acceptance of the new view of nature. But it is a solution from whose implications, as they emerge, the poet increasingly recoils. Only Snyder, who paradoxically 4 Ibid., p. 102. 2o6</page><page sequence="10">NATURE POETRY follows Stevens's instructions to the letter, achieves some measure of success, which is to say access to a new reality and a new con sciousness and thus the possibility of a new nature poetry. The oversimplification of this, however, ought to be obvious. Three poems cannot possibly represent a whole complicated history. At the very least, though, I do think that they exemplify representative at titudes within that history in what is seemingly the logical order of their emergence. Yet the pattern must remain hypothetical because historically the poems do not occur in quite the order in which 1 am considering them. Of the three, Snyder's is indeed the latest, but Stevens's poem, which I am reading as a response to Frost's, actually predates it by more than twenty years.16 Rather than invalidating my argument, however, this fact suggests that assumptions about literary history based on expectations of logical development or on such models as that of progress in science do not necessarily constitute the most effective approach to the truth or complexity of a literary situa tion. To speak of an "old" and a "new" nature poetry is inevitably to oversimplify, and in outlining the seemingly logical order of the emergence of new attitudes and styles, it is important to remember that this is not necessarily the true order. But Langbaum appears to invalidate the true order because it does not conform to the logical one. When he takes Swinburne and Hardy to task for "being anthropomorphic still, at a time when the exciting new concept, the only one that could inspire conviction, was that of the mindlessness of nature" (my emphasis), he seems to be imposing the history of science on that of poetry, insisting that the new ought to follow the old in poetry in the same logical way that it does in science, and therefore that poetry ought to be immediately responsive to changes in scientific or intellectual climate. It seems to me, however, that the ac tual historical relations among the poems I am considering ought to raise questions in turn about these kinds of assumptions, particularly about the concept of literary history that Geoffrey Hartman, a few years ago, referred to as "picaresque adventures in pseudo causality."16 It is a positivistic, diachronic view of literary history, I 15 "Come In" was published in Frost's collection A Witness Tree (New York: Henry Holt, 1942), and "The Snow Man" is dated 1921 in The Palm at the End of the Mind, ed. Holly Stevens (New York: Vintage Books, 1972). Further quotations from Stevens will be taken from this volume, designated PEM in my text. 16 Hartman's phrase appears in his essay "Toward Literary History," Daedalus, 99, No. 2 (Spring 1970), 355. See also, as relevant to this matter, Paul de Man, "Literary History and Literary Modernity," and J. Hillis Miller, "Williams' Spring and All and the Progress of Poetry" in the same issue of Daedalus. 207</page><page sequence="11">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW would suggest, along with too exclusive an attention to the history of ideas at the expense of considerations of poetic language and style, the embodiment of ideas, that lead Langbaum to his overly narrow definition of the differences between what he considers the declining nature poetry of the late nineteenth century and the new nature poetry of the twentieth.17 At any rate, here is Frost's "Come In": As I came to the edge of the woods, Thrush music—hark! Now if it was dusk outside, Inside it was dark. Too dark in the woods for a bird By sleight of wing To better its perch for the night, Though it still could sing. The last of the light of the sun That had died in the west Still lived for one song more In a thrush's breast. Far in the pillared dark Thrush music went— Almost like a call to come in To the dark and lament. But no, I was out for stars: I would not come in. I meant not even if asked, And I hadn't been.18 The poem dramatizes the discovery of the pathetic fallacy, the mind's encounter with itself, and suggests, though only implicitly, the conse quences of this encounter for the kind of poetry that Frost wants to "To do justice to his argument, though, I should point out that Langbaum ultimately does suggest grounds for seeing a continuity between nineteenth- and twentieth-century nature poetry. The best of the latter, he observes, is that which defines itself "by opposing, or seeming to oppose, the pathetic fallacy (one cannot perhaps get round it), and thus extending the range of nineteenth-century projectiveness. For to feel in nature an unalterably alien, even an unfeeling, existence is to carry empathy several steps farther than did the nineteenth-century poets who felt in nature a life different from but compatible with ours" (The Modern Spirit, p. 104). But the point gets muted by Langbaum's emphasis on the conceptual novelty of twentieth-century nature poetry, on its departure from a concept of nature that can no longer be found "in poems that are precisely trying to rescue nature, as it is in itself, from the outmoded concept" (Ibid., p. 102). 18 Complete Poems of Robert Frost (New York: Henry Holt, 1949), p. 446. 2o8</page><page sequence="12">NATURE POETRY write. In this sense it is a poem of stylistic crisis. The mounting lyricism that accompanies the speaker's intensifying identification with the bird singing in darkness, for the first three stanzas, diminishes and recedes more and more into the world of "the pillared dark," finally to leave him at the end with the laconic flatness of the last stanza, a language demystified and drained of poetic possibility. The kind of lyricism that leads to the evocation of "the pillared dark" seems ultimately to belong to it, and the speaker appears happy to let it go. Unlike its Romantic models, the poem enacts not a marriage between the mind and nature but a divorce of the poet from his lyric language. The poetic process is thus described as a false enrichment of language, an inflation that nearly seduces the speaker until he realizes his mistake, his misreading of the situation, which can only end with what must seem like a contrasting impoverishment of language, a deliberate narrowing and restricting of its possibilities, as though language itself were responsible for the speaker's indulgences. Returned from the trance of his lyricism and newly tenacious of his own subjectivity, the speaker adopts a tone at the end that suggests a sobering and a skepticism which will make him approach such situa tions with greater caution in the future. But such caution could be fatal for a poet, for the situation is not simply a dallying with false surmise—it is the poetic act itself. The poem is reminiscent of other situations in Frost where different styles or ways of talking, along with their attendant views of reality, are poised against one another. The most explicit example is in "Birches," where "Truth" breaks in upon one of the poet's metaphorical flights "With all her matter-of-fact."19 This balance between traditional lyricism and a more skeptical, self-possessed adherence to fact seems characteristic of Frost. In "Come In" it takes the form of an opposition between the mysterious view of an active, responsive nature that belongs to Romanticism and a realism that de mands withdrawal from a self-annihilating lyric trance. The poet's very indulgence in lyricism leads him to the harsh realization of what such indulgence implies—imposition of human meaning on an event that really has none—and thus the issue is decided. With the last line of the poem the speaker acknowledges that what he is rejecting is not so much the frightening implications of the invitation to "come in" as "Ibid., p. 152. Reuben Brower, in The Poetry of Robert Frost (New York: Oxford University Press, 1963), advances this argument about the opposition of styles in Frost and observes that the poet in "Come In" seems to be "shying away from his own metaphor" (p. 33). 209</page><page sequence="13">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW the idea that he is being invited at all. At any rate, the whole subject is dropped, and the poem ends, before he can begin to pursue the invita tion to its authentic source. In this way Frost is free to go on writing, forever postponing a real confrontation with the crisis that his work embodies, and yet forever renewing the conditions from which it arises. In "The Snow Man," to a remarkable extent, Wallace Stevens seems to be offering an antidote for Frost's dilemma. In what amounts to a reversal of the speaker's position in "Come In," the poem argues that if it is wrong to impose human meaning on nature, then perhaps the mind can impose "natural" meaning on itself. But "natural" meaning turns out to be no meaning at all, and in the work of a poet for whom "The ultimate elegance" is "the imagined land" (PEM, 187), it seems reasonable to expect that a fictionalization of reality (or even falsification, if it must come to that) would not only be preferable but inevitable. This expectation becomes even stronger when it is remembered that Stevens's work is based largely on the identity of human perception and imagination and that this notion is regarded alternately as the defect and the glory of all our seeing. What is emphasized in "The Snow Man" is the poverty of reality that results from the suppression of imagination: One must have a mind of winter To regard the frost and the boughs Of the pine-trees crusted with snow; And have been cold a long time To behold the junipers shagged with ice, The spruces rough in the distant glitter Of the January sun; and not to think Of any misery in the sound of the wind, In the sound of a few leaves, Which is the sound of the land Full of the same wind That is blowing in the same bare place For the listener, who listens in the snow, And, nothing himself, beholds Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is. (PEM, 54) The speaker begins with the assumption that the reader (with a cast of 210</page><page sequence="14">NATURE POETRY mind similar to Frost's) is going to find this bare winter landscape sad or melancholy, and while describing the scene in language that is ap propriately unadorned and seemingly unaffective, he also prescribes a way of looking at it, a state of mind for seeing it properly. "One must have a mind of winter," or, in Frost's case, a mind of dusk or darkness; in any case, a mind subdued by the element it is going to perceive. To see winter as it is itself we must approach as far as possi ble its condition; we must "become" winter. And this means, further, that we must not "think / Of any misery in the sound of the wind," that we must strip the mind of human content and ultimately give up our humanity entirely, because as it turns out the "mind of winter" is not a metaphor but a literal fact; it belongs to the snow man and is thus made of snow. And the snow man, we are finally told, is "nothing." But it is only "nothing" that can behold "Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is." It is particularly in its closing stanzas, with their incantatory repeti tions and increasing abstraction, that the poem ceases to be a positive recommendation and becomes instead the definition of a negative or at least ambiguous ideal. It defines a condition that, in its own terms, is humanly impossible to achieve. The only way to approach the snow man's "mind of winter" is to give up the human attributes of con sciousness and language, and without these it is no longer possible to speak of "regarding" or "beholding" or "listening," as the poem does. The snow man doesn't perceive reality, after all; he participates in it. And the poem leaves it up to the reader to make the distinction, to realize that with the abandonment of consciousness it is impossible to con tinue to perform acts of consciousness. It is in this sense that the fabrication of reality is inevitable for Stevens. It is a sign of humanity, a humanity which is defined by its readiness to think of "misery in the sound of the wind," and which cannot be evaded. But if all human perception is doomed to be a con struction, an imposition, it is still preferable to any alternative involv ing an abandonment of consciousness, which, even if it were possible, would result not so much in a "true" perception of reality, in the sense of a direct, unhampered, unmediated vision, as in a terrible reduction of it to a threatening and abstract nothingness, a situation in which a discontinuous subject and object would be replaced by a continuity of nothing. Defining the truth of reality as "Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is," Stevens seems perfectly willing to accept the alienation from it that is an inescapable result of consciousness. 211</page><page sequence="15">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW In such a view of the matter, at any rate, nature poetry is at least possible. But it will be a nature poetry of a necessarily limited kind, based on the understanding that "nature" in a poem is never a reflec tion of reality but rather an expression of need or desire, and that, to echo Stevens's terms, it will contain something that is not there in ad dition to the something (including the possibility that this is only "nothing") that is. Thus "The Snow Man" is less an antidote for Frost's dilemma than an explanation of it, even an excuse for it, as well as a demonstration of the human need out of which it arises—the need to fill the apparently inhospitable emptiness of reality with human meanings. But in saying this are we not simply returning to the pathetic fallacy, forced to acknowledge its authority as a descrip tion of the relations between reality and consciousness? I think not, for from Stevens's point of view the idea of the pathetic fallacy can be regarded neither as wholly pathetic nor, any longer, as a fallacy in the strictly pejorative sense. It is, rather, a fallacy that saves, that makes life possible for its practitioners, who remain, with a pathos that verges on the tragic, undeceived about its Active nature. In fact the term "pathetic fallacy" is no longer adequate and is best replaced by what can be seen as Stevens's radical redefinition of it, his notion of the "supreme fiction."20 As he puts it in another poem: The prologues are over. It is a question, now, Of final belief. So, say that final belief Must be in a fiction. It is time to choose. (PEM, 187) The choice, then, is to believe in a fiction or to believe in nothing; hardly a choice at all, since, in Stevens's unyielding conception of the alternatives, "the final belief is to believe in a fiction, which you know to be a fiction, there being nothing else."21 Yet for Gary Snyder this "nothing else" becomes everything, the world of physical reality not external to the self and standing against it but including it. Nature and consciousness are no longer at odds but the same, a seamless continuity in which neither is prior to the other. With the tension between subject and object thus removed, one is no longer "outside" a reality which he must speculate about to know at 20 In an interesting letter, Stevens explains that underlying the notion of the supreme fiction "is the idea that, in the various predicaments of belief, it might be possible to yield, or to try to yield, ourselves to a declared fiction. "This is the same thing as saying that it might be possible for us to believe in something that we know to be untrue." See Letters of Wallace Stevens, ed. Holly Stevens (New York: Alfred Knopf, 1966), p. 443. 21 Opus Posthumous, ed. Samuel French Morse (New York: Alfred Knopf, 1957), p. 163. 212</page><page sequence="16">NATURE POETRY all, and no longer confined to a self which affords protection against engulfment by an external nothingness. Self and world are already in intimate contact, and it is possible to move freely between them: To transcend the ego is to go beyond society as well. "Beyond" there lies, inwardly, the unconscious. Outwardly, the equivalent of the unconscious is the wilderness: both of these terms meet, one step even farther on, as one.22 Thus the process of making up fictions about reality ceases to be necessary, and the poet in his role as the maker of fictions, including any "supreme" one, disappears. For Stevens, of course, poetry itself is the supreme fiction, and the poet is like the singer in "The Idea of Order at Key West," "the single artificer of the world / In which she sang." And when she sang, the sea, Whatever self it had, became the self That was her song, for she was the maker. (PEM, 98) But if Snyder must be seen, in Stevens's terms, as rejecting belief in a fiction and thus unavoidably committing himself to nothing, then in volved in that commitment must also be a rejection of poetry, at least the kind of poetry that Stevens and Frost want to write. And in a real sense this is the case. Snyder is interested in reality before it becomes transformed by the imagination, in the nothingness of winter, in the self the sea had and not the self that it became in the song of the maker. He is interested not in poetry but in something prior to it, a universe regarded as "infinitely blank,"23 and in order to realize this interest he is willing to do what Stevens finds intolerable—give up consciousness and abandon himself to the outer blankness. But the terms of Snyder's relationship with the world suggest that this is not a "giving up" and an "abandonment" so much as the exercise of an ex isting freedom, a possibility already given. In "Mid-August at Sour dough Mountain Lookout," the first poem in his first published book, Snyder acts on this freedom and offers the results, a radiant recovery of the physical world allied with the self that comes not of the "exer tion," as Stevens calls it (PEM, 367), of being part of everything, but of recognizing simply that one is.

I cannot remember things I once read A few friends, but they are in cities. Drinking cold snow-water from a tin cup Looking down for miles Through high still air.24 The poem is not only a report from reality, as opposed to the self strictly defined, but also a statement of preference—preference for reality unmediated by the self, the imagination, or the formal ordering of a conventionally "finished" lyric. What immediately differentiates it from both "Come In" and "The Snow Man" is precisely its ap parent structurelessness, the absence of a frame of discourse. In con trast with Frost, who has a story to tell ("As I came to the edge of the woods"), and Stevens, who has a lesson to teach ("One must have a mind of winter"), Snyder deliberately adopts an utterly casual and non-relational stance which deprives his poem of any rhetorical motive. Less a description than a registration of experience, it is not addressed to anybody and has nothing to recommend. But the most significant lack or negative quality—in a poem that, with regard to more traditional procedures, seems to consist entirely of absences—is that of the "I," the speaker himself, who appears to exist mainly as a disembodied voice totally enthralled by the objects that come under his gaze. Without those objects there would be silence, and in this sense Snyder's poem is the next step after "The Snow Man," an un qualified execution of its instructions, since it exists, is called into be ing, solely by virtue of the physical objects and events occurring in the speaker's environment. This is perhaps what it means to be free of what Charles Olson calls "the lyrical interference of the individual as ego," such freedom in volving the recognition that "man is himself an object."25 The ut terance of which the poem consists does not proceed from a limited, isolated "self" attempting to establish or even describe a relationship with an objective environment. Such a relationship already exists and the poem dramatizes its discovery, reverting momentarily to a stricter definition of the self, at the beginning of the second stanza, only to 24 Ibid., p. 7. 25 Selected Writings of Charles Olson, p. 24. 214</page><page sequence="18">NATURE POETRY confirm the self's new, expanded dimensions in the poem as a whole. For the point of view here is not only inside the self but outside it as well, as though the self has indeed expanded to coincide with its environment—or at least so it might seem to an inhabitant of a self habitually closed off from the world. After the first two lines of the sec ond stanza are spoken—the only lines in the poem that approach a conventional grammar and syntax and thus represent ordinary consciousness—the speaker returns to the poem's dominant mode of quiet, almost toneless, but nevertheless ecstatic participation in the present, a mode in which "Drinking" and "Looking" (participles un modified by any subjective reference) are as much objective "events" taking place in the landscape as the smoke haze down the valley or the pitch glowing on the fir-cones. Thus these two lines of seemingly per sonal, subjective reference do not alter or even interrupt the poem's movement away from a limited conception of self; they confirm that movement; they tell us what is actually happening to the speaker, that his sense of himself as an individual with a history is being abolished, for the present, by his sudden awareness of freedom from such limits and by his full entry into present experience that is not alien to him but that surrounds him intimately, an extension of his being. Unlike "The Snow Man," in which the speaker is slowly overtaken by a sense of ontological terror, "Mid-August at Sourdough Mountain Lookout" dramatizes a process not of loss or reduction but of growth, an ap prehension of continuity with a world that maintains its concrete par ticularity, whereas for Stevens the world, even in its winter bareness, is reduced to an abstract nothingness. In his essay "Poetry and the Primitive," subtitled "Notes on Poetry as an Ecological Survival Technique," Snyder speaks of certain primitive peoples who live in a world of ongoing recurrence—comradeship with the landscape and continual exchanges of being and form and position; every person, animals, forces, all are related via a web of reincarnation—or rather, they are "interborn."26 It is just such a relationship between self and world that is discovered and enacted in the poem, a "comradeship with the landscape" that Snyder attributes, in the same essay, to what he calls the primitive "knowledge of connection and responsibility,"27 where the very knowledge of connection between self and environment confers a " Earth House Hold, p. 129. ' Ibid., p. 121. 215</page><page sequence="19">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW responsibility for both, because ultimately both are "as one." In this way Snyder's work proposes a new understanding of the relationship between man and nature, an ecological consciousness that leads to an ecological ethics, and it is with such an under standing, along with its stylistic embodiment, that an authentic nature poetry, one undertaken neither in the bad faith of the pathetic fallacy nor with the necessary limitations of the supreme fiction, once again becomes possible. For in "Mid-August at Sourdough Mountain Lookout" Snyder has dramatically and stylistically actualized what had become only a metaphorical possibility for an earlier writer like Matthew Arnold—a sinking inward (that is also a movement out ward) to discover not only "fife's flow," whose reality is represented by natural imagery, but the real "meadows where it glides, the sun, the breeze," an apprehension of the "divine ecology,"28 the radical unity of man and nature that lies beyond apparent differences. 8 Ibid., p. 112. 2 16</page></plain_text>
