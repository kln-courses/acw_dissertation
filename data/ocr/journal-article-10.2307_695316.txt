<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY. ZEUS, JUPITER ANI) THE OAK. (Continued from page 186.) IN my last paper I dealt with most of the points essential to an understanding of the Dodonaean cult: but one fact of primary im- portance has still to be considered. There was at Dodona a tradition of human sacrifice. I have already alluded to the legend that a priestess of Dodona was done to death by certain Boeotians, who cast her upon a pyre (Ephorus ap. Strab. 401 f.) or into a caldron of heated water (Heraclides ap. Zenob. 2. 84). There were also occasions on which the oracle definitely prescribed a human sacrifice. Pausanias (7. 21. 1-5 Frazer) states that Coresus, a priest of Dionysus at Calydon, once loved a girl Calirrhoe, who turned a deaf ear to his advances. Thereupon the priest prayed to his god and so brought upon the townsfolk a common frenzy, from which many died. The rest in their extremity applied to the oracle at Dodona and were told that the divine wrath would not be appeased" 'until Coresus had sacrificed to Dionysus either Calirrhoe herself, or some one who should dare to die for her. Finding no way of escape, the damsel sought refuge with those who had brought her up; but she got no protection from them, so there was nothing left for it but that she should be slain, When the preparations for the sacrifice had been made as the oracle of Dodona had directed, the damsel was brought like a victim to the altar, and Coresus stood ready to offer the sacrifice; but, yielding to the impulse of love rather than of anger, he slew himself instead of her, thus giving proof of the most unfeigned affection that ever was heard of. But when Calirrhoe saw Coresus lying dead she repented, and, touched with pity for him and shame at her own treatment of him, she cut her throat at the spring which is in Calydon not far from the harbour, and which has been called Calirrhoe after her ever since.' The romantic colouring of the story is of course late, but-as in the case of Aristodemus'</page><page sequence="2">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW. 269 daughter and her lover (Paus. 4. 9) or in that of Comaetho and Melanippus (Paus. 7. 19)-behind it lurks a genuine tradition of human sacrifice ordained by a conservative oracle. The same bloodthirsty trait comes out in another myth connected with Dodona. According to Dionysius of Hali- carnassus (1. 19), the Pelasgians, when they invaded central Italy, encamped before Kotyle, i.e. Aquae Outiliae, a city of the Aborigines. On seeing the floating island and hearing the name of its inhabitants they concluded that an oracle once delivered to them at Dodona had at last found fulfilment- cTTeLXeTE bLcaLoMvoL ~LKEXWV sa7oPVLaV cLkL &lt;rrelyere paders .eXv Zarpra waya 48' 'A/3optyeviwv KoTrVXl)v, of varos-o: Xe"ra- ot cva.LLXBOvTE 8EKcLTrpV EKtrE/LyfCaTE lOi'/ Kal KE1aX h KpovC3y KaL TW rar7pL 7rrrrETEr ckwra. Dionysius adds that L. Manilius (MVdgEos MSS.) had seen this oracle inscribed in archaic letters on a tripod set up in the precinct of Zeus. It seems probable, as Mommsen pointed out (Rh. Mus. xvi. 284 ff.), that Dionysius is founding on Varro, who (ap. Macrob. 1. 7. 28 ff., cp. 1. 11. 48 fE.) tells the same tale together with its sequel, viz. that the Pelasgians drove out the Sicilienses, devoting a tithe of their spoils to Apollo, and erected a sanctuary of Dis with an altar to Saturn, whose feast they named the Saturnalia. 'For long,' he continues, 'they thought to appease Dis with the heads of men and Saturn with human victims on account of the line Kcl KErahs "AL3y'1 KaTl 7T ra~pL rrb7reTE 47c, but, when Hercules came back through Italy with the oxen of Geryon, he induced -so the story goes-their descendants to change this grim sacrifice for a better by offering to Dis, not the heads of men, but masks made to look like men, and by honouring the altars of Saturn, not with a slain man, but with kindled lights, because the word 4xra denotes lights as well as a man.' Such surrogates were of course not chosen at random but with a view to main- taining the early features of the ritual in question. The human faces (oscilla) swing- ing from the boughs (Verg. georg. 2. 389, cp. figg. in Smith Dict. Ant.3 s.v. ' oscilla ') point backwards to actual human heads hung on a sacred tree (Batticher Baumkultues fig. 31). The candles (cerei) kept burning "ALSp for Kpov(Sp is a noteworthy variation : Zeus at Dodona was telluric (p. 179). NO. CLI. VOL. XVII. at the shrine (Dar.-Sagl. Diet. Ant. i. 869 s.v. 'candela,' 1020 s.v. 'cera') imply a perpetual fire on a sacred hearth.2 It appears then that in early days Zeus of Dodona demanded ' heads and a man '-a demand evaded by the offering of equivocal substitutes. The same principle, in sacris simulata pro veris accipi (Serv. Aen. 2. 116, cp. 4. 512), is illustrated by the legend of 2 Others used the same Dodonaean oracle to account for the ritual of the argei. Ov. fast. 5. 625 if. states that Zeus of Dodona (626 fatidici...Iovis) bade sacri- fice to Saturn (627 falcifero...seni) every year two human victims (627 duo corpora gentis) by flinging them into the river; and that his bidding was liter. ally carried out till Hercules substituted puppets for men. Ovid perhaps drew upon M. Verrius Flaccus de fastis (so H. Winther defastie VerriiFlacci ab Ovidio adhibitis Diss. Berol. 1885 p. 53, Wissowa in Pauly. W issowa i. 692, 62 f.: but see Schanz RBm. Lit. II.'i.2 320 f.), as probably did Festus p. 334 Miill. s.v. 'sexagSenarios': sexagenarios &lt;de ponte olim deiciebant,&gt; cnius causam Mani&lt;lius hane refert, quod Romam&gt; qui incoluerint &lt;primi Aborigines aliquem h&gt; ominem sexaginta &lt;annorum qui esset immolar&gt;e Diti Patri quot&lt;annis soliti fuerint.&gt; quod facere eos de &lt;stitisse adventu Her&gt; culis. sed religio &lt; sa veteris ritus observatione sc &gt; irpeas hom- inum ef&gt; figies de ponte in Tiberim antique &gt; mode mittere &lt;instituisse&gt;. Lactantius, indeed (dir. inst. 1. 21), cites Varro as his authority, when he declares that the practice of flinging a man from the Pens Milvius into the Tiber arose from the oracle ial Iqa- Xhs 'At3n ic! K 7rcerpi ?r4r~rs~w 4ia: but the blunder Milvius for Sublicius makes us suspicious. In all probability, as Wissowa has shown (Pauly-Wissows i. 692, 66 ff.), it was not Varro, but Verrius, who traced the argei to Dodona. Now Verrius, though not such a polymath as Varro, was no fool: and we may even accept his view in the modified sense that that the argei were an institution of the Pelasgians or of the Aborigines their kinsmen (Ridgeway Early Age i. 255, f.). If, where so much is obscure, a con- jecture is permissible, I would hazard the guess that the argeus or sexagenarius was the superannuated representative of a vegetation god, probably of a tree- Jupiter. This at least would account for the main features of the ceremony--the presence, not only of the pontificees, but also of the tflaminica Dialis with dishevelled hair and signs of mourning (Gell. 10. 15, Plut. quaestt. Romn. 86); the part taken by the Vestal Virgins (Paul. p. 15, Ov. fast. 5. 621); the immer- sion of the straw puppets from the bridge (C.B.2 chap. 3); and perhaps the fact that the Ides of May, on which according to Dion. Hal. 1. 38. 3 the sacra argeorum took place, were also marked byferiae lovi Mereurio Maiae. It would also suit the probable meaning of the word argeus, viz. 'white,' i.e. white- headed, a grey-beard (L. Lange R11m. Altert. i." 83, W. Warde Fowler Brnom. Fest. p. 118 f.), and the Oscan name casnar, 'an old man' (Varro ap. Non. p. 86 Merc. s.v. 'carnales': vix ecfatus erat cum more maiorum ultro carnales arripiunt, de ponte in Tiberim deturbant, Varro de 1. Lat. 7. 86, Paul. s.v. 'casnar'), cp. canus for *casnus (Lindsay Lat. lang. p. 307). Mr. Warde Fowler (Romn. Fest. p. 118) has remarked that the puppets used in analogous rites throughout Europe are often called 'the old one,' ' the white man with the white hair, the snow-white husband,' or are dressed in a white shirt. Note also that the flamen Dialis according to Varro (ap. Gell. 10. 15, 32) 'solum album habet galerum.' T</page><page sequence="3">270 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW. Numa. Plutarch (v. Num. 15 Langh.) states that once, when the Aventine 'abounded with flowing springs and shady groves,' it was frequented by Picus and Faunus, who taught King Numa many things, including 'a charm for thunder and lightning, composed of onions hair and pilchards, which is used to this day. Others say, these demigods did not com- municate the charm, but that by the force of magic they brought down Jupiter from heaven. The god, resenting this at Numa's hands, ordered the charm to consist of heads. " Of onions," replied Numa. "No, human "- "Hairs," said Numa, desirous to fence against the dreadful injunction, and interrupting the god. "Living," said Jupiter: "Pilchards," said Numa. He was instructed, it seems, by Egeria how to manage the matter. Jupiter went away propitious, in Greek R'Eos, whence the place was called Ilicium; and so the charm was effected.' This story is usually connected with the cult-title of Jupiter Elicius (Liv. 1. 20. 7, Ov. fast. 3. 327 f., Arnob. 5. 1 follow- ing Valerius Antias); but Plutarch's version suggests rather that there was a Jupiter Ilicius, Jupiter of the, oak (ilex, iliceus, iligneus, ilignus).1 The original practice, undisguised by the refinements of a later age, appears in the myth of Phorbas. The elder Philostratus (imagg. 2. 19)describes how the Phlegyae chose as their king Phorbas, the biggest and most ferocious member of their tribe. He dwelt apart under an oak, which was regarded as his palace; and the Phlegyae resorted to him for judgment. This oak grew on the road to Delphi, and Phorbas terrorised the Delphic pilgrims. Contending in various athletic feats with the strongest of them, he would cut off their heads and hang them on his oak, where they swung in the wind-a ghastly sight. Apollo thus robbed of his votaries came as a boxer and overthrew Phorbas, while a thunderbolt from the sky blasted his oak. The place still bears the name Apv5~ KEckala. Hdt. 9. 39 and Thuc. 3. 24 further state that it was a pass of Mt. Cithaeron on the way from Athens to Plataea, and that the Boeotians called it TpE^$ KEdaXal. Now we have already seen cause to compare the oak-cult of Dodona with the oak-cult of Plataea (p. 181). It seems reasonable therefore to explain the KEfataC of Dodona by the KEcakal of Plataea. We are thus led to conjecture that the priest or priestly-king of Dodona at one time was accustomed to challenge all comers to a contest of strength and, if he worsted them, to slay them and hang their heads on his oak-tree. The con- jecture is supported by two 2 myths, one from Thrace, the other from Elis. Dryas, the 'oak-man' (Ap'as), was a suitor for the hand of Pallene, a princess of the Thracian Odomanti. As such he had a rival, Clitus by name. At the bidding of Sitho, king of the country, their claims were to be decided by a chariot-race, in which the victor should win the princess and the kingdom together. Pallene herself favoured Clitus; and an old servitor of hers induced the charioteer of Dryas to remove the linch-pins of his master's chariot before the race. Dryas fell, and was at once run over and killed by Clitus. Sitho, on realising his daughter's deceit, built a huge funeral pyre for Dryas and was minded to slay Pallene upon it. But a divine portent and a downpour of rain from the sky made him change his mind: instead, he prepared a wedding-feast for the Thracians who were present, and gave Clitus his daughter to wife (Parthen. 6, cp. Con. 10). In this myth the oak-man had to contend with a rival for the kingdom; but nothing 1 Tarquinius Superbus is said to have 'restored' the Compitalia. An oracle of Apollo ordered 'ut pro capitibus capitibus supplicaretur' ; and for some time boys were sacrificed to Mania, mother of the Lares, to secure the safety of the household. On the expulsion of Tarquinius the consul Junius Brutus bade the people substitute garlic and poppy heads, and hang up before their doors puppets for Mania (Macrob. 1. 7. 34 f.). 2 Cercyon of Eleusis, who forced strangers to wrestle with him and slew them when they were thrown, also furnishes a parallel to the grim figure of Phorbas. Observe too that his name KEpICVchY or KEpICvacEs denotes the ' oak '-man, being in all prob- ability connected with quercus. Thus the trial of personal strength is again associated with an oak- king. Perhaps too a trace of the 'heads' caff be discovered in his myth. Cercyon of Eleusis is com- monly identified with Cercyon of Stymphalus: e.g. Charax (ap. schol. Aristoph. nub. 508) relates that Agamedes, king of Stymphalus, married Epicaste, who brought him Trophonius as a step-son and bore him Cercyon as a son. Agamedes, Trophonius, and Cercyon together plundered the treasure-house of Augeias at Elis. Agamedes was there caught in a trap; and, to prevent discovery, Trophonius cut off his head and fled with Cercyon to Orchomenus in Boeotia. Agamedes pursued them and they parted- Trophonius going to Lebadea, Cercyon to Athens. Pausanias' version of this tale (9. 37. 5) mentions Agamedes and Trophonius, but says nothing about Cercyon. The parallel story of Rhampsinitus' treasury (Hdt. 2. 121) also has two thieves. It seems possible, therefore, that Cercyon is an inter- loper in the myth, having been imported into it because he too was in the habit of cutting off heads. Again, Apollo may have figured in the story of Cer- cyon, as he did in that of Phorbas: cp. C.LA. 3. 1203 lEpEbs 'ArohhAwos Kepicuov'ws.</page><page sequence="4">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW. 271 is said about 'heads.' For these we turn to its doublet, the myth of Oenomaiis. It is told at length in the Epitome of Apollodorus (2. 4 ff.). Oenomaiis, king of Pisa, had a daughter Hippodamia, for whose hand he instituted a contest on the following terms. The suitor was to take Hippodamia on his chariot and flee to the Isthmus of Corinth. Oenomaiis, clad in armour and mounted on the car of Ares, would (after sacrificing a ram to Zeus: Died. 4. 73) go in pursuit and, if he caught them, would slay him. In this way he slew many suitors and nailed their heads to his house. When Pelops came to try his luck, Hippodamia fell in love with him and persuaded Myrtilus, son of Hermes and charioteer of Oenomaiis, not to insert the linch-pins of his master's car. Oenomauis was thrown, and, being entangled in the reins, was dragged along and killed or, a roof on them. The structure has been erected in order to protect a wooden pillar which is decayed by time and is kept to- gether chiefly by bands. This pillar stood, they say, in the house of Oenomaiis, and when the house was struck by lightning the fire which destroyed all the rest of the house spared this pillar alone.' The same authority states (5. 14. 7 Frazer): ' At the place where are the foundations of the house of Oenomaiis there are two altars; one is that of Zeus of the Courtyard, which Oenomaiis appears to have had built him- self; the other altar is that of Thunderbolt Zeus, which I suppose they made afterwards when the thunderbolt had fallen on the house of Oenomaiis.' The house of Oeno- mails, whatever its precise site (see Frazer Pausanias iii. 621), must have been very close to the great temple of Zeus; so that, FIG. 1.-OENOMAtS AND PELOPS: ZEUS ANICONIC. r E P i +4 ~ ~ 5 I)EAqpnFcot o INon f n LC~:\ ~hO~ roan~?~ re rP' 'i r r?rcpo3i+n a lldl I IlsQ~U?rT~mWldlllll 1L~ / U~;L'SPO?C~IIII\ UU /n i b ?

O (I O O~CO according to others, was despatched by Pelops, who, thereby won his bride and became king of Pisa. This legend so closely resembles the fore- going one that, when Oenomaiis is sub- stituted for Dryas, we are inclined to ask whether Oenomaiis like Dryas stood in any special relation to a tree. Now a sacred tree was often conventionalised into a pillar (see e.g. A. Evans 'Mycenaean Tree and Pillar Cult' in J.H.S. xxi. 99 ft.). Possibly, therefore, the single pillar of Oenomaiis' palace still standing in the second century A.D. was in reality the old cultus- tree of the kings of Pisa. This at least fits in with all that is known of it. Pausanias (5. 20. 6 Frazer) says: 'What the Eleans call the pillar of Oenomaiis is as you go from the great altar to the sanctuary of Zeus: on the left there are four pillars with if Oenomaiis' pillar represented a sacred tree, that tree was probably a tree-Zeus. The suggestion is confirmed by an Apulian amphora from Ruvo, now in the British Museum (Cat. Vases F 331) and here re- produced from the Arch. Zeitung 1853, Taf. 54, 1. This vase (Fig. 1) shows a most interest- ing variation on the scene represented in the east pediment of the temple of Zeus. The artist has depicted Oenomaiis and Pelops, taking the oath before they start on their race. Only, instead of the anthropomorphic Zeus who forms the central figure in the pediment, he has placed a four-sided pillar, splayed at the foot as if hewn from a tree- trunk and inscribed AI 0 . This can be nothing but the aniconic Zeus of Oenomaiis, who is about to pour a libation from a phiale over the altar in front of his god. Facing T2</page><page sequence="5">272 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW. him stands Pelops in rich attire. The two competitors are flanked by Myrtilus on the one hand, Hippodamia (led forward by Peitho ? ) on the other : Eros and Aphrodite appropriately complete the group. On the palace wall in the background hangs a white pilos with a sword, and to either side of it two human heads-one that of a young man named PEA AF i.e. IlcXyeov (Paus. 6. 21. 11) wearing a Phrygian cap with lappets, the other that of a second youth called PEPI4 A Z , IlEcpcaf--doubtless the heads of Pelops' ill-fated predecessors.' Another vase from the same collection (Cat. Vases, F 278), an Apulian crater, should be studied side by side with this am- phora: the illustration in the text (Fig. 2) is from the Bull. Nap. nuov. ser. vi. 1858, tav. 8. Although the names are not here marked, it can hardly be questioned that closed by two tree-stumps surmounted by a couple of doves.2 The tree-stumps alone might be taken to indicate the Altis or Grove. But the two doves, as Minervini argued (Bull. Nap. 1858, p. 148 f.), should be identified with those of the Dodonaean Zeus, who spoke his oracles Storwoiv K rEXELtc- Sev (Sopb. Track. 172, with schol. ad loc.). This looks very much as though Zeus at Olympia had once had an oracular tree-cult comparable to that of Dodona. Strab. 353 observes: 'The sanctuary was originally famous on account of the oracle of Olym- pian Zeus; when that ceased (iKXiE4&amp;roO), its reputation none the less continued and reached its well-known height owing to the common festival and the Olympic contest.' The oracle of Zeus at Olympia was consulted by Agesipolis i. (Xen. Hell. 4. 7), and is alluded to by Pindar (01. 6. 6) as follows: 'If,' he says, 'one be an Olympic victor and ~ Mn i i :O` ?i i~o I I I II~ i :1 9 'L` L Y g II ""...??. \\\ I ??:`';'"'"'";' \\I' ~ ~nrl,.lllll ~V ~r II II ?I FIG. 2.-OENOMAijS AND PELOPS: ZEUS ICOIlc. the subject is again the compact of Oeno- marls with Pelops before the altar of Zeus (so Walters Cat. Vases, iv. 136, Reinach, Rip. Vases. Peints, i. 495). Zeus is iconic, but stands on the top of the old four-sided pillar with the altar placed as before. The central figures are here too flanked by Myr- tilus and Hippodamia; the former bears armour; the latter, a bridal torch. The presence of Heracles marks the spot as Olympia; for a wide-spread tradition made Heracles the founder of the Olympic games (Paus. 5. 7, Apollodor. 2. 7. 2, Diod. 4. 14, al.). But the most notable feature of the whole design is its frame-work: it is en- treasurer (raLL'ac) to the oracular altar of Zeus at Pisa and one of them that founded glorious Syracuse, what manner of song would not such an one win ' The reference is to Agesias of Syracuse, one of the Iamid clan, which traced its descent from Iamos, son of Apollo (ib. 58. 84 f.) and grandson of Poseidon (ib. 99 f.), and served the oracular altar of Zeus (ib. 119 f,) drawing its omens from burnt-offerings (01. 8. 3, schol. vet. 01. 6. 7, schol. rec. Ol. 6. 119). Possibly before the introduction of the wild-olive the sacred tree had been an oak. Nero dedicated four crowns in the temple of Zeus at Olympia, 'three in the shape of wild-olive leaves and one in the shape of oak leaves' (Paus. 5. 1 Philostr. Jun. imagg. 9. 3 pea&amp;ha ad 'acas, T&amp;Jv rporuva.~cwv ch lv;adort. So on a sarcophagus in the Vatican (Roscher lex. iii. 782) and on another at Naples (Baumeister Denkm. 1203). One of these victims was Iptar (Paus. 6. 21. 11), a name which occurs nowhere else: does it denote the 'oak '-man (wrpi~os) ? 2 Cp. a vase at Arezzo (Mon. dell' Inst. viii. pl. 3, Baumeister DenkEm. fig. 1395), which shows Hippo- damia on the car of Pelops: in the background are two laurel-trees, and the car is accompanied by two flying doves.</page><page sequence="6">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW. 273 12. 8). Indeed, it seems probable that the Olympic Zeus had at different times been associated with different trees. (1) Origin- ally, as at Dodona, he may have had an oak or an oak-grove. For this the evidence, as cited above, is scanty. But note also that just as Dione superseded the primeval Gaea, as consort of the Dodonaean Zeus, so Hera at Olympia may have been the successor of Gaea, who once gave her oracles there at the so-called Gaeum (Paus. 5. 14. 10). The oak pillar surviving in the opisthodomus of the Heraeum (Paus. 5. 16. 1) would be highly appropriate to the partner of an oak-Zeus. (2) A mythical equivalent for the oak was the poplar, as may be seen from the myths of Erysichthon (Call. h. Cer. 37), Dryope (Anton. Lib. 32), etc. This substitution has left its traces on language; for Schrader Reallex. pp. 164, 207, points out that aLyElpos, 'a poplar,' is derived from the same root as alcydyX, ' the winter- or Valonia- oak,' aiyaviy, 'an oaken spear,' aesculUs8 (*aeg-sculus), 'an ever-green oak,' etc.; and KEpKl~, apparently connected with quercus, denotes a kind of poplar (Hesych. KEpKI' aiyecpos) resembling the XEd'yi or white poplar (Theophr. h. pl. 3. 14. 2). The transition from oak to poplar was probably due in the first instance to an actual change of vege- tation. In prehistoric times the oak seems to have been the principal tree throughout Europe (Schrader Prehist. Ant. p. 271 f., Frazer G.B.2 iii. 347 n. 1): nowadays the white poplar is the finest tree in Greece (Leaf on II. 13. 389). But the tran- sition may also have been facilitated by some botanical likeness. Thus at Sicyon in the precinct of Aphrodite leaves of the wat?'poes were burnt along with the thighs of the victims. Pausanias (2. 10. 6 Frazer) says of this tree: 'Its leaves are less than those of the oak, but larger than those of the evergreen oak: in shape they resemble oak leaves: one side of them is blackish, the other is white: their colour may be best likened to that of the leaves of the white poplar.' Frazer ad loc. idenatifies the irat.3- po with the quercus Ballota or the quercus coccifera. Nicander (frag. 2. 55 f. iracu&amp;V POrTE I XEVKfl iTratLO'EVOL) also compares this species of oak to the white poplar. Perhaps, therefore, it was as a substitute for the oak that the white poplar was venerated at Olympia. Heracles found it growing beside the Acheron in Thesprotis and brought it thence to Greece: 'And I believe,' says Pausanias (5. 14. 2),' that when he sacri- ficed to Zeus at Olympia, Heracles himself burned the thigh bones of the victims on wood of the white poplar.' Henceforward none but this wood was used in sacrificing to Zeus or Pelops (Paus. 5. 13. 3, 5. 14. 2). Also, at Lepreum, some fifteen miles from Olympia, there was a cult of Zeus AEvKadoO, probably a god of the white poplar (Paus. 5. 5. 5 and Frazer ad loc.). (3) The wild- olive, again, seems to have been another substitute for the oak. On the one hand, the species of wild-olive called 4vXla was oLoLov 7rpt'p (Hesych c. s.v. Xvkl). On the other, the species of oak called aiyltX was also known as eXaki (Hesych. d~ts' aiyiXdo). The wild olive at Olympia, which was brought by Heracles from the land of the Hyperboreans to supply a dearth of trees (Pind. 01. 3. 13 ff.), is said to have had this peculiarity, that the upper, not the under, surface of its leaves was white (schol. vet. Aristoph. Plut. 586, [Aristot.] mir. acunc. 51).' Whether this was so or not, it is probable that the combination of a light with a dark surface was one reason which led the Greeks to replace the oak alike by the XEVKy and by the KOTLvo~: the word 4avXta could denote both the white poplar and a kind of olive (Hesych. s.v. 4avXla). Oenomaiis was by no means the only king of Elis who disposed of his kingdom by a race. It was indeed the traditional proce- dure. The name of the first king of Elis, Aethlius, son of Zeus (Paus. 5. 1. 3), already points to it. He was the father of Endy- mion, who in turn set his sons to run a race at Olympia for the kingdom (Paus. 5. 1. 4, 5. 8. 1). 'About a generation after .Endy- mion, Pelops celebrated the games in honour of Olympian Zeus in a grander way than all who had gone before him' (Paus. 5. 8. 2 Frazer). Later, the claims of Dius and Oxylus were settled by a single combat (Paus. 5. 4. 1). ' After the reign of Oxylus who also held the games, the Olympic festi- val was discontinued down to the time of Iphitus. When Iphitus renewed the games . . . people had forgotten the ancient cus- toms, and they only gradually remembered them' (Paus. 5. 8. 5 Frazer). 'Iphitus presided alone over the games and after Iphitus the descendants of Oxylus did like- wise' (Paus. 5. 9. 4 Frazer). It seems probable therefore that in mythical times the Olympic contest was a means of deter- mining who should be king of the district and champion of the local tree-Zeus. This supposition explains several points about 1 See further L. Weniger der heilige Olbaum inm Olympia, Weimar 1895, p. 8 ft.

He was feasted 'within the Prytaneum7 opposite the chamber in which is the hearth '(Paus. 5. 15. 12 Frazer). His crown was displayed originally on a bronze-plated tripod (Paus. 5. 12. 5), after- wards on a table of ivory and gold (Paus. 5. 20. 2). It was a spray of olive like th wreath of Zeus himself (Paus. 5. 11. 1), and was cut from the JXaia KaXX'c(TTc aVOs, which grew behind the temple of Zeus (Paus. 5. 15. 3), with a golden sickle by a boy, both of whose parents were alive (schol. vet.

Nothing can, I think, be inferred from the griffin's head that tops this cap-of-honour. It reminds one at first of the griffins on the helmet of the Par- thenos (Paus. 1. 24. 5) and so suggests a Panathenaic victor. But the griflfin is most frequently associated with Apollo (see Furtwiingler in Roscher lex. i. 1774, 12 if., Diirrbach in Dar.-Sagl. Dict. Ant. ii. 1672), which would point rather to a Pythian victory. And a whole series of griffin's heads in bronze has been // -,f,/ ii -i/": FIG. 3.-THE CROWNING OF A VICTOR IN THE GAMES. 01. 3. 60). Again, the singular ceremony of the cfvXo/oXia (schol. vet. Pind. 01. 8. 76 oL VLK(TV7TE ZUbVXXof3ooVTo, Etym. mag. 532, 46 trdcXaL E~ vXho/Xowvv 70o VLKoV7ai, Other reff. in Dar.-Sagl. Dict. Ant. i. 1084, n. 72) becomes intelligible if the successful athlete was regarded as a sort of Jack-in the-green, a human representative of the tree-god. As such he is shown on a kylix from Vulci now in the Bibl. Nat. Paris: my illustration of it (Fig. 3) is from the Arch. Zeit. 1853, Taf. 52, 3. The athlete is here depicted holding in his hands not only his wreath but also ound at Olympia (Furtwangler die Bronzen von Olympice pll. 45, 46, 47, 49). Still, ceremonial head-gear is always of importance and it is worth while to investigate the point further. A very similar helmet is found on an amphora from Capua published in the Compte Rends de Saint- Pdtersbourg 1874 p. 208, Atlas pl. vii., (here repro- duced as Fig. 4). The artist has represented a winged Nike bringing a fillet to a young Isthmian or Nemean victor, who already carries in his hands the selinon and olive-sprays and is decorated with the ribbands. He wears a helmet with a curiously elongated spike, from which hangs another fillet inscribed HO P[AlI kizALO . The nearest parallel to these spiked helmets that I can quote is the apex worn e.</page><page sequence="8">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW. 275 Further, the statue of the victor was set up in the Altis (Plin. nat. hist. 34. 16); and, on his return home, he was welcomed with hymns and honours of all kinds-e.g. clad in a purple mantle like a king (schol. Ar. nub. 70) he was drawn by white horses (Diod. 13. 82) into the city through a breach in its wall (Plut. symp. 2. 5, Suet. Nero 25, Dio 63. 20). Indeed Lucian (Anach. 10) speaks of the victor as W-d0eov vo/Ld/Lcvov. And this was no mere figure of speech. Philippus of Crotona, an Olympic victor, was worshipped after his death as a hero by the men of Egesta &amp; rd EovTroV KJXXog (Hdt. 5. 47). The statue of Polydamas the athlete at Olympia was said to cure cases of fever s, ~C~ P RC~,~,"? E~ ~ll~f~,u~~ Li o r ;c~ s ff i i: FIG. 4.-AN ISTHMIAN OR NEMEAN VICTOR. by the flamen Dialis at Rome. It was a short wand of olive wood (Paul. s.v. ' albogalerus' : virgula oleagina bound about with a wisp of wool (Verg. Aen. 8. 664, Serv. Aen. 2. 683, interp. Serv. Aen. 10. 270, Isid. 19. 30. 5). Now, if the victor in the moment of his triumph wore on his head a cap recalling the virgula oleagina of the flamen Dialis, may we not infer that the spike on his cap was in reality the symbol of the sacred tree ? Just as the tree once worshipped by English villagers came to be repre- sented by the May-pole with its coloured streamers, so the sacred tree at Olympia and elsewhere may have come to be represented by the rod borne on the victor's head. A similar transition from a sacred bough wreathed with fillets to a ceremonial helmet perhaps underlies an obscure gloss in Hesychius: Kopvuahtla" c~cpvi eL/reuu;rl. 'rtvs T)vP elpecaCr~v. &amp;hXos 5h tirepopt &lt;d5repdpetov ? &gt; 6edv. Preller- Robert4 307, n. 2 had already suggested that Kopv- OahXa might be connected with KIovs. (Luc. deer. concil. 12). Euthymus the boxer, a native of Locri in Italy, was actually deified during his life-time on account of his unbroken record at Olympia (Plin. nat. hist, 7. 152). It was said that he never died but passed from earth in some mysteri- ous fashion (Paus. 6. 6. 10): the same was said of Cleomedes of Astypalaea, who was heroified by his countrymen (Paus. 6. 9. 8). Theagenes the Thasian, a man who won no fewer than 1,400 crowns (Paus. 6. 11. 5), contrived on one occasion to beat Euthymus (Paus. 6. 11. 4): he too was worshipped as a god both in Thasos and elsewhere (Paus. 6. 11. 8 f., Luc. deer. concil. 12). These facts occurring among a people so enamoured of equality can hardly be explained except on the assumption that the 'OXverlovlKio was originally and essentially divine.1 I would here call attention to a fifth century krater preserved in the Art Institute of Chicago and published by Prof. E. Gardner in the American Journal of Archaeo- logy 1899 iii. 331 ff., pl. 4 (from which Fig. 5 is taken). It represents a male figure holding a wreath and decked out with olive sprays and a variety of woollen fillets. A winged Nike steps before him and a dancing maiden follows him. If this were all, we should regard him without more ado as an Olympic victor. But this is not all. He seems to be in a kind of transport or ecstasy, in which he imagines himself to be Zeus and challenges comparison with the sky-god. He is bearded and wreathed with olive, as Zeus was. He grasps a thunder- bolt with his right hand and brandishes a sword with his left. He wears greaves too, one on his right leg, the other on his left arm, perhaps to protect it against a bolt from the upper air. Now this combination of thunderbolt with warlike equipment reminds us of the Zeus worshipped by Oenomaiis. For, on the one hand, the house of Oenomaiis contained an altar of Thunder- bolt Zeus (Paus. 5. 14. 7), and, on the other, 'Oenomaiis used to sacrifice..,. to Warlike Zeus whenever he was about to engage in a chariot-race with any of the suitors of Hippodamia' (Paus. 5. 14. 6 Frazer). Here then we have an Olympic victor posing as the local Zeus, Zeus KepacvLos and YApesos. But who is this 1 Here we find ourselves on the threshold of a broader question. Did the great games of Greece in every case originate in a struggle for the post of priestly-king . Where tradition connects them with the funeral of a local hero, the priestly-king may have been thought to embody the spirit of the deceased hero. But the question is too large to be treated in a paragraph</page><page sequence="9">276 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW. victor ? I gladly accept the suggestion made to me in conversation by Miss J. Harrison, that he is Salmoneus.' The essential features of the composition, viz. the trium- phant progress of the Olympic victor and his mad imitation of Zeus, exactly fit the description of Salmoneus given by Virgil Aen. 6. 588 ff. per Graium populos mediaeque per Elidis urbem ibat ovanrs, divomque sibi poscebat honorem, demens. The details are equally approlpriate-Nike remembered that Zeus was not first in the field at Olympia. Pausanias, when discus- sing the origin of the Olympic games, states (5. 7. 10 Frazer) : ' Some say that Zeus here wrestled with Cronus himself for the king- dom; others that he held the games in honour of his victory over Cronus.' This probably implies that the cult of Zeus at Olympia had driven out an older cult of Cronus (M. Mayer in Roscher lex. ii. 1508, Ridgeway Early Age i. 124). The memory of the older cult was kept up in the royal house; for Pindar (01. 3. 23) speaks of Kpoviov IlXorros, and the floalXka, the priestly kings of Olympia, sacrificed to Cronus at FIG. 5.-SALMONEUS THE OLYMPIC VICTOR POSING AS ZEUS. with down-turned hand deprecating his triumph, the lunatic's notion of wearing a greave on his exposed arm, the upward glance as of one who defies the non imitabile fulmen. There is only one difficulty in the interpretation. What is the meaning of the broken fetter on his left ankle No legend of any imprisonment of Salmoneus is extant. Rather we may suspect that it is part of his disguise as a would-be god. It does not, however, so far as we know, suit his character as Zeus. But it must be the spring equinox on the top of Mount Cronium (Paus. 6. 20. 1). It would not be surprising, therefore, if a trait which pro- perly belonged to Cronus had become attached to his successor Zeus. The broken fetter, if I am not mistaken, is just such a trait. Once a year, at the Saturnalia, the statue of Saturn at Rome slipped its fetter (Stat. silv. 1. 6. 4. compede exsoluta, Apollodor. ap. Macrob. 1. 8. 5, Arnob. 4. 24, Minuc. Fel. 22. 5); and Lucian says that poets and painters represented Cronus as ?rc87q)r (Cronosol. 10). I do not doubt, therefore, that the Chicago krater has preserved an early version of the Salmoneus myth, a version in which at Prof. E. Gardner's explanation of the painting as 'the madness of Athamas,' though supported with much learning and ingenuity, has failed to convince me.</page><page sequence="10">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW. 277 least one feature is borrowed from the cult of Cronus, not Zeus. The later account of Salmoneus says nothing about the Olympic victory (except for Virgil's allusion) or the broken fetter. It is given with most detail by Apol- lodorus, who says (1. 9. 7): 'Salmoneus at first dwelt in Thessaly, but subsequently came to Elis and founded a town there. He was a proud man and fain to place him- self on a level with Zeus; for which impiety he was punished. For he declared that he was Zeus, and depriving Zeus of his sacrifices he bade men offer them to himself. He attached to a chariot leather thongs with bronze caldrons and trailing them after him said that he was thundering; he tossed blazing torches towards the sky and said that he was lightening. Zeus therefore struck him with a thunderbolt and destroyed the town founded by him and all its inhabi- tants.' The same mythographer (1. 7. 4.) tells us a somewhat similar tale of Alcyone, the sister of Salmoneus: 'Ceyx, son of Heosphorus, married Alcyone. They per- ished through their overweening pride. For Ceyx declared that his wife was Hera; Alcyone, that her husband was Zeus. Zeus then changed them into birds, making the one a halcyon, the other a ceyx.' Myths of this type may be taken to imply that, when the divine right of kings had faded into obli- vion, posterity in general and alien immi.- grants in particular treated the explicit claim to be Zeus as sheer impiety calling for the vengeance of the genuine god. At a later date still it merely made the claimant ridi- culous: Menecrates of Syracuse, court- physician to Philip of Macedon, prided him- self on his life-giving powers to such an extent that he called himself MEVEKpdTrp Zets, and went about wearing a purple robe and a golden crown, followed by a train of patients dressed up as Heracles, Hermes, Apollo, Asclepius, etc. (Athen. 289 A-290 A, Plut. v. Ages. 21, Ael. var. hist. 12. 51). Pindar's warning # /JrCEUE Zess yeVOeaTL (Isth. 4. 14, cp. 01. 5. 24) was not so far- fetched after all. The old Pelasgian view that the king was indeed divine has, as we have seen, to be pieced together from scattered indications in local usage and mythology. It has even left its traces here and there imprinted on the earliest extant Greek literature. The Homeric epithets O6EoL87%, 90odekXo,, TLOeo , o'Qdeo have doubtless long since lost their full force; but the significant fact is that they should ever have become current as compli- ments and not rather have been avoided as rank blasphemies. When Odysseus promises Achilles that the Messenians shall honour him O&amp;Zv JS (II. 9. 297) or Phoenix urges (ibid. 603) EPXo TcoV yadp oa OG, TLOovOLy 'AXarol, they are of course using the language of contemporary politeness; but the formulae, we may be sure, had a long history behind them, and the latter-day fiction had been the former-day fact.' This comes out clearly in the case of Agamemnon. His stock epithet dva$&amp;vdpuv is suggestive of a divine title (cp. Verg. Aen. 1, 65 divom pater atque hominum rex, Hes. theog, 923 O&amp;iv flao'XTL KaL vv8p&amp;v) and in II. 2. 478 he is described as ottaraa Kat Krea4X'v LKE oo~ LL 7rp7LKEparV'. But it is also known that there was an actual cult of Agamemnon as a Chthonian Zeus in Laconia (Tzetz. in Lyc. 1369, Clem. Al. protr. 2. 38, Eust. 168, 10 ft.) and Attica (schol. vet. Lyc. 1369 Aanrpcra 0 j-coL *Cr 'A7T7Lru , vOa 'Ayap4ipovos ALoh &amp;epOv d7V ). And there are grounds for suspecting that he was once the guardian of a sacred tree2 or pole: for Paus. 9. 40. 11 f. states that the god whom the Chaeroneans honoured most was a wooden staff (8opv) regarded as the sceptre of Zeus, a sceptre possessed in turn by Hermes, Pelops, Atreus, Thyestes, and Agamemnon-' There is no public tem- ple built for it, but the man who acts as priest keeps the sceptre in his house for the year; and sacrifices are offered to it daily, and a table is set beside it covered with all sorts of flesh and cakes' (Frazer's trans.). The priest who kept the sceptre of Zeus in his house for the year was the human Zeus, the priestly-king, the strong man for the time being. I am aware that such divinities as Zeus 'Ayac/lwv or Zeus 'A5~4dpaos (at Oropus, Dicaearch. 1. 6, cp. Rohde Psychse i. 125 n. 2) are usually explained by the assumption that a later Zeus-cult was grafted upon an earlier hero-cult. But it is at least equally easy to suppose that the hero was a Zeus all along, the local champion or king being as such the embodiment of the god. Indeed, much might be said in support of the view that the early kings were essentially divine 1 Dr. Frazer (Enc. Brit." xxiii. 18 s.v.' Taboo ') regards the Homeric application of 8;os, Ostos, iepds to men as 'a survival, or at least a reminiscence, of a system of taboo.' 2 The plane tree at Delphi was said to have been planted by Agamemnon (Theophr. hist. p1. 4. 13. 2, Plin. nat. hist. 16. 238), as was also a plane-tree at Caphyae in Arcadia (eid. ib.). At Aulis the plane. tree, under which the Greeks sacrificed (1. 2. 306 f.), was close t0 'the bronze threshold of Agamemnon's hut' (Paus. 9. 19. 7): cp. the relief at Lansdowne House (Jahn Bilderchron. p1. 3, 1).</page><page sequence="11">278 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW. The influence of this conception over the whole history of the Greeks and Romans has not, I venture to think, been sufficiently recognised' and deserves to be carefully investigated. For example, the frequent apotheoses of the Graeco-Roman age are apparently due to a recrudescence of the primitive belief. The individual may live to a second childhood; and the nation may revert to the faith of its infancy. I much doubt whether the Athenians would ever have deified Demetrius, or the Samians Lysander, or the Romans Julius Caesar and Augustus, had there not been all along a dormant belief in the divinity of the victor. It is a lower stratum; but it crops up on both sides of the landscape. We are recalled to Dodona by the cir- cumstance that among the brethren of Salmoneus were Athamas, father of Helle, and Perieres, founder of the Dodonaean oracle (Apollodor. 1. 7. 3). In view of the myths above considered I would maintain, not only that the priestly-king of Dodona had to undergo a periodical duel or contest of personal strength, after which the head of the vanquished was nailed to the sacred oak or to the palace-wall (cp. Phorbas, Oenomaiis), but also that this contest gave rise to the local games, the N'ica (cp. the origin of the games at Olympia), and that the victor becoming ipso facto the priestly- king was treated as an incarnate Zeus. I had already shown, on the one hand, that the victor in the N6ac was rewarded with a prize-jar symbolising a perpetual lamp; on the other, that the priestly-king had in his Prytaneum a sacred hearth. It now appears that this was no mere coincidence. The victor was indeed identical with the priestly-king; and, if my suggestion on p. 185 was correct, he kept up the undying flame in order to feed the fires of a solar Zeus. Having thus arrived at what I take to be the truth of the Dodonaean cult, I shall next examine various other centres of Zeus- worship round the Aegean basin in order to test the accuracy of my view.
