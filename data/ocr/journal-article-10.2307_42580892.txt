For in psychology, the person here interested is an authoritative in general semantics interpretation who is of also behavior deeply interested in terms in psychology, here is an authoritative interpretation of behavior in terms of a non-elementalistic man: an organism-as-a-whole-in-an-environment. Dr. Cameron, professor of both psychology and psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin, has had full professional training both in objective psychology and in clinical psychiatry. In this book, he bridges the gap between psychology and psychiatry, by presenting the ř abnormal ' in terms of the ř normal .' He drops no bombs, but he does plant a mighty seed that may have even greater effect on the future landscape of psychology. Quietly and without fanfare, he creates a new picture of behavior, by using a different language. But this is not a book of theoretical argument, concerned with tearing down other psychologies in order to advance the author's point of view. As the subtitle ('A Biosocial Inter- pretation') suggests, it is presented simply as a point of view - not as the new psychology. His biosocial approach, the author says in his preface, . . . differs from classical behaviorism in rejecting reflexes, instincts and emotions as building blocks out of which human behavior was supposed to be constructed. It is holistic and analytical rather than atomistic and synthetic. In dealing with biosocial behavior, normal and abnormal, the emphasis is less upon the physiological machinery of the individual than upon communication , learning, role-taking and socially-derived self-reac- tions. The biosocial interpretation departs from traditional psychobiology by dispensing entirely with the concept of consciousness and the distinction between mental and non-mental. [Italics supplied.] While Dr. Cameron has used a different language, he has not coined a new psychological terminology. His psychological language is in some respects like Basic English: its chief character is derived from the words it is forced to leave out. His substitute terms give no trouble, because they belong to the common vocabulary. He simply does not choose to explain behavior in terms of 'instincts,' 'emotions,' 'drives,' 'mechanisms,' 'ego,' 'id,' and so on. The substantives in his 142</page><page sequence="2">Winter 1950 BOOK REVIEWS sentences tend to be people, bodily organs, processes, relationships, symptoms, actions, social institutions. But the author is not adverse to using more 'abstract' terms when these do not have too strong connotations that might link them to familiar elementalistic theories of behavior. For example, 'repression.' As he uses it, this term connotes a process, or a dynamic relationship between 'stimulus,' evaluation, and response. While it is not extensional, it evokes no ghostly images. It is frankly abstract; whereas 'the Censor' is an anthropomorphic term that conjures up an Invisible Man inside us. 'The Censor' is the kind of term Cameron successfully avoids, while giving us a consistent picture of behavior. Though 'repression' is scarcely an important topic in the book, Cameron's development of this idea (without referring to a censor') may serve as an example of his treatment. 'Repression' appears to be the by-product of the normal process of giving attention to other stimuli. That is, whenever we attend to any stimuli, we are able to do so only by excluding from our awareness the other 'stimuli' that are present. Or, in terms of general semantics, there is no evalua- tion until there is abstraction. Why do we attend only to selected stimuli, if there is no censor? Because past experiences have made us more sensitive to certain patterns of stimulation than to others. 'Repression' then appears not as an active force, but simply as a passive residue of characteristics left out - much like the 1 that remains when we subtract 2 from 3. Throughout the book, the author resists the common habit of reifying psy- chological terms. One reads not of 'schizophrenia' but of people with 'schizo- phrenic disorders.' This subtle change of emphasis from the disease to disorders may seem unimportant. Yet the former term has acquired status as an entity, while the latter is understood as a process - a mal -functioning of an organism. This subtle change in emphasis, characteristic of the entire book, will hardly be noticed by the professional psychologist, psychiatrist, or advanced student who has schooled himself to be on guard against the misleading implications of terminology. Yet it is a definite boon to new readers in the field. They will surely get fewer notions that they must later unlearn or reinterpret in the light of further study in general semantics, medicine, sociology, chemistry, physics, and biology. These terminological aspects of the book have been emphasized here because they are of special interest to readers who are used to the orientation of general semantics. However, the book is not for the lay reader of psychology. It is aimed primarily at the serious student, the clinician, the educator, and the sociologist. The main emphasis of the book is on the origin and development of behavior disorders, and the clinical picture of the various syndromes. The author is little concerned with hard and fast distinctions between the disorders; instead he emphasizes the great overlap of symptoms, and the purely arbitrary and utilitarian 143</page><page sequence="3">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS vol. VII, NO. 2 value of any system of classification. In some respects he departs from the stand- ard classifications. There is little discussion of specific therapy. Yet the author emphasizes that the choice of technique should depend upon the nature of the unique biosocial relationship that is needed between patient and therapist in a particular case. Without espousing or condemning any form of therapy for use in all cases, Cameron appears to lean more heavily toward the Rogerian non-directive methods. From the Thought standpoint and of Role-Taking general semantics, that is it most is Cameron's interesting chapter and important. on 'Lan- guage, Thought and Role-Taking that is most interesting and important. It appears early in the book, and forms the basis for the author's biosocial inter- pretation. Other than the use of a dynamic, non-elementalistic terminology, the viewpoint developed in this chapter is the principal innovation and contribution of the book to the study of behavior disorders. The author's semantic orientation may be seen from a few typical quotations taken at random: It is the virtual absence of elaborate language behavior in other animal forms which principally accounts for the fact that nothing approach- ing complex behavior disorders can be demonstrated below the human level. . . . . . . The effects on the individual's life of acquiring and using language do not stop with interindividual signaling and symbolizing ; they go right on to influence his thinking also . . . . . . The fact that verbal operations may differ from the non-verbal man- ipulations they are supposed to represent, and may give different results, is of the highest significance for the behavior disorders. Schizophrenic s, in particular, fall into the verbal traps of their own making . . . ... In conforming to the conventions of language behavior, [the child] conforms also to what those conventions imply in his culture. . . . . . . Sharing one's responses and attitudes overtly with other persons is the most effective way of bringing them into line with those of the pre- vailing cultural patterns. Reactions which for any reason are left uncom- municated and unshared with others are likely to play a leading part in behavior pathology because they lack this controlling influence . . . While this point of view is not new to students of general semantics, it is illuminating and exciting to see it presented as the fundamental basis around which an original view of human behavior is developed. Even of language more stimulating behavior is and the social author's interactions. discussion of This role-taking viewpoint - a is derivative so fresh of language behavior and social interactions. This viewpoint is so fresh and arresting that it is difficult to more than suggest its possibilities in a brief review. Under the influence of this term, 'personality' is seen not as a bundle 144</page><page sequence="4">winter 1950 BOOK REVIEWS of mutually distinct 'selves,' but as a fluid organization of role-taking skills. In brief, role-taking refers to all those processes of social adaptation, in 'real' situa- tions or in play, in which the individaul reacts to his own evaluation of himself, and the evaluations of others to him. It plays a part in fantasy, day-dream, escape, and delusion - and in healthy adaptation to life situations. Skill and ingenuity in switching one's roles are seen as fundamental factors in adapta- tion; and their lack results in rigidity and non-adaptativeness to changes in the environment. The term and its exposition dispels much of the confusion formerly wrought by such terms as conscience,' 'super-ego,' 'idealized image.' But the importance of this section of the book cannot be suggested here. Psychologist or not, anyone interested in general semantics will be rewarded by reading this chapter in particular.
