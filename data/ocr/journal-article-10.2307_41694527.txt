LXXIX ] 1998 [ Parts l-l V DEFINING SACRED PLACE : CONTEST, COMPROMISE, AND PRIESTLY CONTROL IN SOME MÄHÄTMYA TEXTS By Phyllis Granoff The origins of image worship and the transition from Vedic to purSgic Hinduism remain two of the most vexing questions in the study of early Indian religion. It is clear that orthodox Brahmin priests initially rejected the cult of images in the temple and only gradually, and one might even say begrudg« ingly, came to desire a ritual role in temple worship.1 The ambivalence and sometimes downright hostility of at least some orthodox priests to the esta- blished temple cult persists throughout history and is nowhere more apparent than in the mãhõtmya texts, a genre of texts appended to the major puränas. Even the most cursory reading of a wide variety of these texts reveals the curious fact that while we may know these sites as temple sites, many of these texts either ignore totally the existence of temple buildings or seek by various strategies to marginalize the importance of the temple and the rituals carried out in the temple.2 In doing so they define the sanctity of the site 1 See Heinrich von Stietcncron, " Orthodox Attitudes Towards Temple Service and Image Worship in Ancient India", Central Asiatic Journal , vol. 2, 1971, pp. 126-1 38 and Arjun Appadurai, •• The Status of Brahman Priests in Hindu India South Asian Anthropologist , 1983, pp. 43-56. 2 ( An interesting contrast is provided by story literature in which the existence of a won- derful temple is highlighted.

LXXIX ( 1998 ) primarily in terms of the physical site itself, often a mountain, and its natural features, lakes, rivers, and from time to time man-made or divinely made tanks and ponds. The texts of course speak of the god agreeing to reside at the site, presumably in the anthropomorphic image or liñga, but 1 hope to show how the texts nonetheless in their treatment of these main ritual objects preserve a distance between temple cult and orthodox priest, and between temple and the image it houses, on the one hand, and other ritual objects not under control of the temple, on the other hand. Tn this paper I examine two late áaiva mãhãtmya- s, the Arunãcalamãhãt mya and the Prabhãsamãhãtmya , both included today in the Skanda Purãna? While I discuss the Prabhãsa- mãhãtmya in greater detail, I include the Arunãcalamãhãt mya precisely because its treatment of the temple and its icon seems less clear-cut and more nuanced. I hoped by including both texts to offer a richer and more complex discussion of the definition of sacred space, within the temple or outside the tenple, in some late medieval mãhãtmya texts.

On the island is a lotus lake with jewelled lotuses and in the lake is a marvellous temple made of all different kinds of jewels. The. temple is described in some detail, as is the image of Visnu inside the temple The king worships the image of Visnu. The temple and the island have been fashioned from Atri's austerities or tapas . The text is on p. 210 of the edition in the Ãnandãsarama Sanskrit Series, vol, 54, Pune, 1981. It is also important to note that the mãhãtmya- s are a diversé genre of texts and that not every mãhãtmya was written by the same grout) of for the same purposes. Thus we find a text like the V ekkatesamãhãtmya of tbe Skanda Purãna , Vaisnava Khanda, in which the Brahmin priests, the VaikhSna- sas, assist with the building of the temple and the installation of the image ( chapter 9 ). This is a text that at least in part belongs to the priests who tended the images. Simi- larly, the Prabhãsamãhãtmya part II, 1. 101 if. recommends the building of tem- ples to Visnu. My argument here is that in fact such statements are in the minority and constitute the exception to a general rule. In the present paper I will be looking at texts that I assume were written by priestly groups who were at best uncomfortable with image worship, and could even be openly hostile to it. While the texts I am examin* ing are late in date, 1 believe that the earliest mãhãtmya-s were originally priestly texts as opposed to temple texts On the origin of pilgrimage in India and priestly circles see "Client, Ritual and Conflict in Early Brahmanical Order", Indian Historical Review, 6, no. 1, 1980, pp. 63-118. 3 There have been some excellent studies of the mãhãtmya texts, for example, Hans Bakker, Ayodhyã , Groningen : Egbert Forsten, 1986; Hermann Kulke, The Cidam- baramãhõtmya , Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz, 1970; Marie-Claude Porcher, "La représentation de l'espace sacré dans le Kãncimãhatmya ", in Jean-Claude Galey, ed.

The Prabhãsamãhãtmya : who will worship in the temple ? The Prabhãsamãhãtmya ia some ways is totally explicit about the con- test over sacred space and the problems of defining what constitutes the sacr- ed site. The text does indeed mention a temple in addition to defining the boundaries of a larger sacred area, the kçetra. The temple is at the center of the larger area ( 5. 12 ; 7. 60 ). ài va tells the goddess that there is in the larger holy site a house by the ocean in which he resides in the form of a linga: tanmadhye madgrham devi tisfhaty udadhisamnidhau // 40b tasya madhye mahãdevi liñgarüpo vasãmy aham / 41a. Later in the text, in chapter 23, *&lt;e are given the account of the building of the temple. It is connected with the story of the moon, who was cursed by Dak§a, his father-in-law, when he refused to treat all of Dakça's daughters with love and favoured only RohiçL Dak$a curses the moon to have yak aman, a wasting disease. The moon- is distressed and seeks to concili ite Dak§a. He is told to worship Šiva for. a cure. Šiva tells the moon that long ago he too had been cursçd by som? sages and his liňga had been made to fall into the ocean. He tells Soma to consecrate that linga and make it suitable for worship; Višvákarman, the artisan of the gods, will help him. The first step in the consecration of the linga is told in gireat detail ;,it involves building several sacrificial enclosures and preparing for a sacrifice. The first structures that Viévakarman builds are not temples,- but sacrificial marapas. There is a main marapa, which is adorned with flags.- .In itis a marvellous throne from which hang garlands of pearls ; it was like heaven itself with divine garlands of sandal wood and arch ways made from the bea* venly wishing trees ; everywhere it exuded a divine fragrance ( 37-39 ). There are separate structures for the various groups of priests who will take part ip the sacrifice ( 100 ). In verse 120 we learn this odd bit of information that I will argue is actually of great significance : the linga to be installed is to be set up on top of an underground linga. The god Brahmã is the only one .. who can see this underground linga. He digs down and anoints the underground linga and then covers it with a stone, called a brahmaiila .4 ' On the brahma'siln, which is a kind of foundation stone on top of which the image is placed, see S. K. Ramachandra Rao, Agama Kosha, vol. 9. Consecrations, Bangalore : Kalaptharu Research Academy, 1V94, p. 31 and p. 67. According to the discussion on p. 67, the brahma'siln is placed over the area dug out to bold the garbha or depo- sit made under the image. In this case, the underground liaga takes the place of the more normal deposit of jewels and other objects. I have tried to argue elsewhere that the rituals connected with the purification of the site and the gathering of materials for the temple building and its actual buildiog and consecration have a distinctly ( Gontinued on th» next</page><page sequence="4">4 Annals BORI, LXXIX ( 1998 ) After the sacrifice has been completed, marking the consecration foi worship of the linga( s ), the moon finally asks Višvakarman to build a tem- ple for the linga : Cadramã yaksmanã muktah svasthãnanirato 9 bhavat / ähüva visvakarmãnam prâsãdam paryakalpayat / šaddhasphaiikasamkašam goksï radhavalojjvalam // 24. 56 " And the moon, freed of his wasting disease, was enjoying once more his former position. He summoned Višvakarman and had him make a temple that was like shining crystal, white like cow's milk." The moon has other temples made for other gods ; many of the tem- ples bear the name of different jewels. He also makes wells and tanks, hou- ses and places of refuge for the poor and needy. He gives all of these to the brahmins ( 67 ). In fact he founds a city near the main temple, where he settles the brahmins so that they may then go about their normal business : nivešya nagaram somah šrísomešvarasamnidhau / svakarmanãm pracãrãrtham athãbhyarthayata dvijãn // 68 •' And having settled this city near the god Somešvara, the moon requested the brahmins to dwell there and carry out their appointed tasks. " He tells the Brahmins that their homes have been made ready ; they are filled with everything the Brahmins will need, including rare and precious substances like aloe woods, camphor and sandalwoods, brought from distant lands. The merchants have even been instructed to make over to the Brah- mins a portion of their earnings ( 74 ). But the moon wants a special service from the Brahmins in return for giving them a place to live and providing them with subsistence and even luxury goods ; the moon asks these Brah- mins to take care of the liñga he has consecrated in the temple that he has built. The reply the Brahmins give is instructive. They speak through titcir leader Kaušika ; ( Continued from /&gt;. 3, ) Vedic or "orthodox" tone as opposed to other rituals described in the puranas for the worship of the main image; in this case we would have an example of a further orthodox encroachment on the image worship in the temple, with the ritual deposit becoming part of the main image, albeit a hidden part left in the control of the •• orthodox " or non-image worshipping priests. I would no doubt revise and expand upon much of what I bave said in that earlier effort to make a separation between prie- stly ritual ard temple practice, which is also the subject of the present paper. The earlier effort, "Heaven on Earth: Temple and Tempte-Cities of Medieval India" will appear in a festschrift for Frits Staal.</page><page sequence="5">Gřanoff : Defining Sacred Place 5 uvãca Kau š i ka s tesu gotrãnãm prathamo dvijah / sãdhUpadistam asmãkam dvijarãjena sarvaíhã // 84 sarvam etat karisyãmah kimtu kimcinnišamaya / niyogatah püjayatäm š i vanirmãlyasevinãm // 85 pãtityam jãyate 's maka fn érutismrtivigarhitam / šrutismrtí hi rudrasya yasmãd ãjfiãdvayam mahat // 86 kas tad ullamghayen müdhah prãnaih kanthagatair api II 87 astamürteh punar murtãv agnau devamukhe makhãn kurvãnãh šrutimargena prinayãmo 'khilam jagat // 88 " Kaušika, the foremost Brahmin among those Brahmin clans, spoke : 4 In every respect we applaud what the moon, king of the twice-born, ha- instructed us. We will do everything requested of us, but first we beg you to hear this small point we would like to make. If we were to worship accor- ding to the rules of worshipping images in temples, busying ourselves with the leavings of the offerings to Siva, then we would lose our caste status, something which is abhorred by the orthodox sruti and smrti texts. And šruti and smfti are the two great commands of the god Rudra himself ; what fool would transgress them, even if he were threatened with death ? We bring joy to the entire world by performing sacrifices according to the rules of the Sruti into the fire, which is the mouth of the gods, and which is one of the eight forms of that god who has eight forms, namely Šiva. " Kausika's speech is clear. Orthodox Brahmin priests must worship by performing sacrifices according to the rules of the Vedic texis ; worship of images leads to a loss of caste status for a brahmin priest. One has only to think of passages like Manu III. 152 which bars those who tend images from offerings to the gods and pitfs, two important ritual functions for orthodox priests.5 The Brahmin is particularly concerned with the fact that temple priests must deal with the offerings made to the god. I have translated the phrase šivanirmalyasevinam perhaps too loosely here as u busy- ing ourselves with the leavings of the offerings to Šiva. " The real objection is probably that the priests keep and use for themselves what devotees bring to the gods in the temple. This lay behind many of the traditional Brahmin tirades against the priests in the tenaple ; they were considered no better than thieves, who stole what did not belong to them.6 Coupled with this accusa- tion was the horror in which leavings of any kind, particularly of food, were 5 Cited in von Stietencron, p. 134. • Manu 11. 26 ; von Stietencron, p. 134 note ^</page><page sequence="6">6 Annals BO HI, LXXIX ( 1998 ) held in orthodox circles. The leavings of food were considered to be parti- cularly polluting ; in a reversal of orthodox values the leavings of the god's food would be considered prasãda , a form of the god's blessing, by those who came to serve the god in the temple and by the devotees. It was certain- ly not the case in orthodox Brahmin priestly circles.7 Kaušika thus rejects for the orthodox Brahmins a role in caring for the litiga in the moon's new temple. But he has promised to do what the moon requested, and he keeps his promise by suggesting to the moon some people who might be suitable for the task of overseeing the worship in the temple. Kaušika proceeds to describe a group of people, born into the families of brahmarsis, sages who are brahmins by birth 99 . These people were originally demons, daitya- s, enemies of the gods. They had worshipped Siva and obtained boons from him but Visnu had nonetheless slain them when they got out of control and oppressed the gods. They had then been reborn iti the families of brahmarsis and were still devoted to worshipping the litiga ( 121 ). It is these people whom the moon should appoint as priests. One could not want more explicit statement about the orthodox Brahmanical attitude towards the temple and the object of worship in the temple. Orthodox Brahmins are not to be responsible for the worship of the litiga in the temple, and as the story of the demonic ancestry of the priests who are appointed to that task shows, the orthodox Brahmins remain suspi- cious of the status of those who deal with temple worship,8 It seems natural 7 See Charles Malamoud, " Observations sur la Notion du 'reste' dans le Brahma- nisme". Wiener Zeitschrift für die Kunde Südasiens , vol. XVI, 1972, pp. 5-26. 8 The distrust of temple priests seems in some cases to have extended to all Brahmins associated with a sacred site in general. Thus we hear in the Agnipurana , GayS- mãhãtmya , chapter 114, that when the sacred site was first established Brahmã made for the Brahmios a city that was very much like heaven ; the villages had mountains of gold, while the rivers flowed with curds and honey ; the lakes were made of ghee and curds and there were mountains of food (34). He gave them the wishing cow and wishing trees and homes of gold and silver, so that the Brahmins would never have to ask anything of those who were their inferiors ( 35 ). But the Brahmins were greedy and accepted gifts of money and other things at the sacrifice and so all those Brahmins at Gayã were cursed by Brahmã to be devoid of wisdom and always filled with desires. The rivers lost their milk and honey and the mountains became ordinary stone (36-37). When the Brahmins begged Brahmã to give them some means to live upon, he agreed that they would live off the holy place. Those who came to Gayã and gave things to these Brahmins would ensure that their ancestors went from hell to heaven ( 38-41 ).

The clear split in roles between Brahmins, whose job is to recite the Vedas, and temple priests, whose job it is to ( Continued on the n§xt page, )</page><page sequence="7">Granoff ¡ Defining Sacred Place 7 that such an attitude towards the temple and worship of the sacred object in the temple should condition how the orthodox Brahmin priests wished to de- fine the sacred site They cannot simply define the sacred site in terms of the temple, as a modern tourist or scholar of religion might wish to do. In rejecting for themselves a major ritual role in the temple, and yet wanting to maintain a major influence at the sacred site, Brahmin priests needed a defi- nition of the sacred site that lay outside the limited area of temple and its sacred object. I shall argue in what follows that they used various strategies to accomplish this goal. They described numerous rituals that were to be per- formed in the larger ksetra, outside of the temple, and with a sacred object other than the main linga, the control of which they had given over to the " demon priests They even redefined the main sacred object itself, by asserting that it was not simply the visible liòga in the temple that was the focus of the attention of the " demon priests " ; this I will agrue is the signi- ficance of the liňga being consecrated over an " invisible " linga, which only BrahmS, the orthodox priest of the gods, can anoint. And finally they peopled the sacred site with such an abundance of sacred tanks and sacred objects that the focus of sanctity is taken away from the temple with its sacred object and distributed over a broad range of holy objects, virtually all of which are either natural features or bare liñgas, unprotected by temple structures and therefore outside the sphere of authority of the despised temple priests. In what follows I look briefly at these strategies. Before doing so, I would like to review another story in a puranic mãhãtmya that similarly suggests a conflict between self-styled " orthodox " priests and the culture of the temple, and a begrudging acceptance of the efficacy of the temple cult. The Nãgarakhanda of the Skanda Purãna contains an interesting account of the sage Durvãsas, known in purãnic mythology for his quick temper ( 6. 37 ).a Durvãsas comes upon an assembly of orthodox Brahmins. They are engaged in the typical pursuits of the orthodox Brahmin ; some, ( Continued from p. 6. ) worship the gods, is clear in many vernacular texts of a late medieval date. A clear example can be found in the Assamese Rãmãyana Aycdhyã Kamnda *, verse 2005, describing Ayodhyä after Ráma has left the city. The temple priests no longer wor- ship the gods, while the Brahmins no longer recite the Vedas. There then follows a long list of castes and their abandoned duties. ( * i. e. Kända ), w 1 am using tne edition trom Nag Publishers, Delhi, 19ö6, vol. 6. 1 have wnrtten about this section of the Skanda Purãna in an article. " When Miracles Become too Many : Stories of the Destruction of holy Sites in the Täpl Khan da of the Skanda Purãna ABQRl , Amrtamáhotsava Volume, 1991-92, pp. 549-571.</page><page sequence="8">8 Atmais BORI, LXXIX ( 1998 &gt; knowers of the Veda, are busy expounding upon the Vedas ; some, desirous of victory in debate, are wrangling with other experts ; still others, knowers of the sacrifice, are busy discoursing on the sacrifice, while yet others, knowers of Brahma and skilled in the VedSňgas, are wrestling with their own questions and doubts. Some Brahmins are absorbed in their Vedic recitations, as they proclaim the Vedas in loud voices, while others ask each other questions about the lawbooks or recite from the pura nas ( 1-8 ). DurvSsas greets them with the respect due them and then explains to them that he has decided to build a temple to Šiva. He asks them to show him the site on which he should build his temple ( 10-1 1 ). But the Brahmins give him no answer. At that Durväsas curses them all, in a voice loud enough for all to hear ( 13 ). He berates them for their pride, saying that in their lineage from this time forward there will be many who are stained by pride ; sons will go against their fathers and friends and kinsmen will lack any sentiments of good will for each other ( 14-16 ). DurvBsas then turns to leave the assembly, stinging from their insult to him. One of the Brahmins, named Sušila, who is described as eldery and wise ( vfddhatama, sudhî, 18 ), tries to calm DurvSsas. He explains that the Brahmins were so busy with their loud Vedic recitation that they did noi hear DurvSsas' request ; that is why they did not answer him ( 21 ). He personally gives DurvSsas land to build the temple ( 22 ). DurvSsas is pleased with Suslla's offer and accepts the land and builds his temple. The stoiy does not end' bere, however; we are told that rest of the Brahmins are furious when they learn what Sušila has done ( 24-25 ). They in turn curse Sušila with these words : tatah procuh samãsãdya yena íaptã durãtmanã / vaya m tasmai tvayã dattã prãsãdãrtham vasundharõ // 26 tasmãt tvam api cãsmãkam bãhya eva bhaviçyasi / Sušilo ' pi hi duhiilo nãmnã samkirtyase budhaih // 27 " Since you have given land for a temple to that wicked ons who has cursed us, you shall be forever cast out from our group. Though you are called Sušila, ' One of god conduct, by name ', you will henceforth be known by the learned as the ' One of wicked conduct ' ". Suslla humbly accepts their curse; when DurvSsas offers to destroy all of the Brahmins for their treatment of Sušila, Sušila tells him that a person must respect the Brahmins at all cost ( 40 ). At the conclusion of the passage the giver of land for the temple has been cursed to be an outcaste by the ortho- dox Brahmin community ; the temple too is to be known by a term of op pro*</page><page sequence="9">Granoff : Defining Sacred Place 9 brium, namely as the temple of Duhslla, the temple of the wicked, and yet it is promised that people who worship there will be released from sin. The text is clearly uncomfortable both with temple worship as a whole, and more specifically with the Brahmins who would participate too directly in that worship. I turn now to look at what room these texts tried to make for those " orthodox " Brahmins who fek the need to participate somehow in the sanctity of pilgrimage sites that were increasingly temple sites. II. Redefining the sacred : alternative sacred objects. As an example of the alternative sacred object one might select any one of many passages that describe rituals to be performed at PrabhSsa. In chap- ter 24 we are told the story of a very beautiful Gandharva princess, who is overly proud of her beauty. She insults the chief of the gaças, Šikhan^in, who overhears her one day as she is playing with her friends in the garden. She boasts that no one in the world even comes near her in beauty ( 163 ). The gaga is furious and curses her to have leprosy. She is naturally dejected at this prospect and begs the gaç* to tell her how she may be released from this curse. He takes pity on her and tells her to seek out a certain sage in the Himalayas. She runs to her father and tells him what has happened Both her parents are naturally distressed at the turn of events, and they quickly make their way to the HimSlayas, where they find the Ssrami of the sage Gošrůga. Gošfňga tells the girl's father that there is in ths land Bhärata, near the ocean, a god Somesvara, worship of whom cures all diseases ( 181 ). He instructs them to worship Šiva by performing the Somava rar rata, the " Monday ritual " ( 183 ). An unsuspecting reader might assume that since Gošfňga had begun his instructions by mentioning the god Somesvara near the ocean, that is the main god in the temple, that the ritual would be a ritual conducted at the temple and under the supervision of the temple priests. In fact as the lengthy description of the ritual unfolds, we see that such is not the case at all. The description of the ritual is given in chapter 23. We are told that it is the very ritual that the moon had performed long ago and tint secured the presence of Šiva in the liñga that he had consecrated and assured that the liňga would not ever be destroyed. ( 6-10 ). Through that ritual, moreover» the moon was cured of his wasting disease and restored to his rightful place in the sky (11). Then we are given description of the ritual itself. It is to be performed in any month on a Monday in the bright of the month and beg- ins with a ceremonial purification. The person performing the ritual is to brush his or her teeth and bathe vary early in the morning. The ritual is to take place anywhere, as long as the place is suitable for such ritual activity. 2 ( Annals BORI J</page><page sequence="10">10 Annals BORI, LXXIX ( 1998 ) The ground should be level and clean (15). The devotee is to place a deco- rated pot on this ground and then to place th.re two vessels that have been covered with sprouts of mango and bsautified with sandal wood. These ve- ssels should be draped with white cloth and adorned with every ornament (16). Then the devotee is to set up eight images of that god who has eight forms, namely Šiva. The images are to be placed at each of the eight directions, the four cardinal points and the intermediate directions ( 17 ). Šiva should be accompanied by his wife Um9. Next the devotee worships šiva with white flowers ( 17 ), various offerings of food and fru ts ( 18 ) and recites a mantra given in the text. With this mantra he is to worship ( puja ) and make an offering into a sacrificial fire ( homarii ca kãrayet ). ÀII of this is to be done daring the day, while at night the devotee awaits a special dream, lying on a bed of darbha grass and meditating on Šivu (21). In this way we are told, all the many kinds of leprosy are cured. The description goes on ; the next Monday the devotee is to use a special wood, karañja, to brush the teeth and is then to worship the god accompanied by his sakti Jyeçthã. He offers §ata- patra flowers and himself eats some honey and then observes the other rituals described for day one. This ritual brings the devotee wealth, in the form of a lakh of cows. On subsequent days the devotee uses different woods for the toothbrush, offers different flowers and foods and may observe a ritual vigil, staying awake ail night. At the end of nine Mondays of various rituals the concluding ritual is to be held. This is a more elaborate affair. For this ritual thè devotee is to construct a sacrificial enclosure ( mandapa ) and a sacri* ficial pit ( kunda ) (41) He is to build a sacrificial altar ( vedi ) that is square in shape ( 42 ). He is to draw a mandala on the iltar, in the center of which is a lotus. At each of the eight directions he is to place pots filled with gold ( 43 ) and to position there one of the eight Šaktis, beginning with VSm8 ( 43 ). In the center of the lotus he is to place Somesvara, in an an* thropomorphic image ( pratimärüpasampannam ). The image is to be of gold and should include an image of the goddess as well ( hemajam iaktisam - yutam) ( 44). The image is to be put on a bed or couch made of silver ( rukmaiayyösamärüdhani ) ( 45 ) and the whole thing is to be put on top of a vessel made of gold and filled with honey. There the image is to be wor- shipped ( 45-46 ). The imagd is to be worshipped with fragrant substances, garlands, lamps and varions offerings of food ( 47 ). Further offerings are to be made to the guru who is supervising the ritual. These offerings are to be tqade in the name of Somesvara and are to include clothes, ornaments, betel' umbrellas, fly whisks, mirrors, lamps, bells, a canopy and a couch (48). Then the ãcãryç is to be covered in ornaments and he is to be asked to per- form a fire sacrifice ( homa, verse 49 ). That night they are to stay awake, and in the morning the devotee is to çffcr a fçast for the brahmins. He j? to</page><page sequence="11">GřanOFf : Defining Sacred Piace Í1 give them each a pair of garments and a cow and then dismiss them from their ritual duties ( 52 ). What is most striking about this ritual is that it has nothing at all to do with the temp'e, the temple priests or the image in the temple. Indeed from the description of the ritual itself it is not even clear that it should nece- ssarily be performed at Prabhäsa itself. We learn at the conclusion of the account that the Gandharva, the father of the afflicted beauty, does hasten with his family to Prabhäsa. He sees Somešvara and worships him and then begins to perform the ritual. It i* worth noting that the ritual is not perfor- med to the main image in the temple. It is performed outside the temple, in a sacrificial enclosure made expressly for that purpose. It uses another image of the god, one made of gold, and not even a lingi at all. The image used is an anthropomorphic image of Šiva and his consort. This image clearly replaces the liñga in the temple as the appropriate focus of the ritual activity. One can say with less certainty who the priest was who might have supervised the ritual.10 I suspect that it was the orthodox Brahmin priests, who wanted to worship through making offerings into the fire. This is, after all, basically a homa ritual that demands the construction of a sacrificial enclosure and a fire altar. It was just such a ritual at which the Brahmins e: gerly participated in the story of the consecration of the first linga. I understand this ritual, then, as an attempt by the orthodox priests to carve out for themselves a ritual role outside the temple and its rituals, and thereby secure for themselves a place in the ritual world of this holy site. For this story, it is Prabhäsa- kçetra, the larger territory and not the temple itself, that is the sanctified ground. The Gandharva we are told took all that he needed to perform the ritual as instructed by the sage Gošjrňga and went to PrabhSsak§etra : ityuktah sa ca gandharvah putryã saha varänane / sarvopahãrasamyuktah prabhãsaksetram ãíritah // As Šiva teils PärvatI, " And O lady with the lovely face, that Gandharva, having received these instructions, resorted to Prabhãsaksetra. taking with him all that he needed for the ritual At the end of the ritual the Gandharva girl is cured and her father is filled with faith in áiva. In chapter 26 we are told that he then makes a 10 The priest who supervises the ritual is called by the terms ãcãrya and paurSnika guru, a guru learned in the purãnas, ( 48 ).</page><page sequence="12">12 Annals BORI, LXXlX f 1998 ) 1 iièga to ài va, we are told, just to the north of Somesvara. The liñga is accompanied by a guardian figure, DagdapSgi, " the one who holds a stick.'* The linga goes under the name of Gandharveša, " Lord of the Gandharva " ( 2 ) and grants as the fruit of its worship the statt of being a Gandharva. A person who worships this linga on the fifth of the month will never suffer any unhappiness ( 3 ). In the next chapter we learn that the Gandharva's dau- ghter bad also set up a liňga there. It is known as Vimalešvara and cures all sickness (2). If a woman worships that linga on the third of the month she is free from all defects that make her undesirable to her husband. She gains all her wishes and thrives in the midst of sons and grandsons ( 3 ). I see in the accounts of these two liñgas a further attempt to create a sacred space and sacred objects that lie outside the temple, in which worship was so problematic for the orthodox priests. The proliferation of sacked sites within the larger sacred space thus was carefully designed. The temple is given only a minor role in what transpires at the site, according to this text The Gandharva had paid his respects to Somesvara, but then the ritual ground shifts to somewhere outside the temple, where the Gandharva makes his own images, his own temporary ritual enclosures and finally erects his own linga for others after him tò worship. His daughter does the same. While these new lingas are described in terms of their proximity to the main image in the temple, th*y are independent objects of worship. One might even choose to understand them as competing objects of worship. This notion of competing objects of worship is in fact made explicit in one of the later stories in the text. In chapter 39 we are told about a linga called Kedãraliúga, after the famous pilgrimage site of KedSra, which it is said hid in this linga, afraid of sinners in the degenerate age. We hear of a king named Šašabindu, who had come to PrabhSsa. He had gone to Somesvara, where he saw the great sages engaged in a ritual of staying awake all night to worship the linga. He bowed down to Somesvara, but then went on his way to KedSra, where he bathed and worshipped the linga with various offerings of food, clothes and jewels. It was in front of that linga that he stayed awake all night in worship. The sages are curious about the king's behavior and ask him why he has chosen to ignore Somešvara and conduct his vigil in front of another liňga. Surely, th?y say, he must know something special about this liňga. The king replies with a miracle story. He tells them that in a previous birth he was a šfldra. Famine struck the land and he and his wife were starving. One night they came upon this liňga being worshipped by a courtesan on the occasion of the festival of ŠivarStri. They decided to keep the vigil, too, and worship the liňga. As a result the</page><page sequence="13">GRANOFF : Defining Sacred Piace 13 ¿Odra was born as this great king. The sages are impressed by the account and they too become devoted to the worship of the KedSra Unga. In this little miracle tale we are told that a liñga once worshipped by a sQdra and a courtesan is a more fitting object of worship than the main liñga in the temple. This story, then, goes beyond simply telling us that there are other objects of worship at tbe holy site. It suggests that there are better objects of worship than the one under the control of the temple priests. That the rituals done at these other liñgas are under the control of orthodox priests, is I think clear from some of the accounts. Thus in chapter 42, which describes worship at the liñga known as Cagdisa, the worshipper is to conclude hb rituals by giviog daksinã, the ritual gift, to the Brahmins ( 7 ). Candiša is also recommended as a fit place to perform the oblations to the ancestors, the srãddha, a ritual under the control of the orthodox priests (9). In a similar vein, in chapter 70, we hear of a liñga called Varugešvara. In extolling its virtues Šiva tells PärvatI, ko hyartho bahubhir liňgair drstair vã surasundari / varu nei ena drstena sarvatì rhaphalam labhet // 8 " O lovely woman of the gods ! What point is there to seeing many liñgas? When one sees Varupesa he or she gains the fruit of visiting all the holy sites ! " At this site, too one may perform rituals associated with the orthodox priesthood, fire sacrifices and Bali rituals ( 11 ). Perhaps even more subversive of the hegemony of the main temple and its image are the ultimate concluding words of the text : yadvã tadvã püjayitvä Ungarn ksetrasya madhyagam / iri some&amp;am iti jliãtvã someiah pít jito bhavet // " No matter which of the liñgas one worships at this holy site, if one does so thinking in his mind that that liega is Somesa, then Somesa himself has been worshipped These closing words may serve both as a justification for the fact that this text, devoted to Somesa speaks mainly of other holy objects. I would also like to see in them a means by which the Brahmin priesthood could main- tain an interest in the holy site, although they refused to take part in the service of the main image in its main temple.</page><page sequence="14">14 Annals ÈORÍ, LXXlX ( 1998 ) There are still other passages in the text that describe rituals in which there are no objects of worship at all, neither Somesvara, the main god in the temple, nor other liñgas, like those of the Gandharva and his daughter or Kedäresvara. Thus, for example, in chapter 36, we learn about a place in PrabhSsa where it is extremely propitious to die ( 40 ). The ultimate san- ctity of that spot is attested by the fact that it was here that Kf¿na and Arju- na after the Mahãbhãrata war cleansed themselves of the sin of having killed their relatives.11 A person is instructed to observe various fasts, subsisting on water or air or leaves. One should give gold to the Brahmins there ( 44 ) and offer the šraddha , the oblations to the ancestors. It is here, too, that the ancestors are said to be most easily satisfied, just as they are at Gaya, the more traditional spot for performing funeral rituals ( 45-46 ). The man who gives curds to a Brahmin ascends to the world of the gods and eats plentiful and excellent food ( 49 ). The pilgrim who gives a fiae wool blanket to a Brahmin achieves the highest religious goal, one that it is difficult for other mortals to obtain ( 50 ). With these passages we seem to have left entirely the world of the tem- ple and temple ritual ; indeed we are outside the whole religious world in which images and image worship takes place. These are purely Brahmanical rituals that have nothing to do with temple and imige worship. Their pro- minence in a text like the Prabhãsamãhãtmya, which is devoted to a sacred site known in medieval times primarily for its temple to Siva, can tell us much about certain orthodox Brahmanical attitudes towards the sacred site.19 The sacred site in this text in these passages, without ritual objects or with ritual objects other than the main liñga, seems to exist despite the presence of the temple. It is also worth noting that such passages in fact constitute the bulk of our text. 11 The sins of the Pãndiavas are often the subject of miracle stories in the mãhãtmya texts, suggesting that in the late medieval tradition the ethical problems of the Mahã- bhãrata war were a serious concern in some religious texts. The subject deserves a full study. 13 That Somesvara was primarily known for its temple and the god housed there is clear for example in the many medieval Jain texts which describe the pilgrimage of the king Kumãrapãla to Somangtha. See for example the Kumãrapãlacaritrasamgraha , ed. Jinavijaya Muni, Singhi Jain Series, vol. 14, Bombay : BhãratTya Vidyã Bhavan, 1956 The king SiddhapSla is also said to have made a pilgrimage to PrabhSsa to petition the god for a son. One has only to glance through any of the biographies of Kumara- pala to see the important role that the god Somesvara had in the religious life of the period. Kumârapâla's pilgrimage is focussed on the worship of the god Somesvara ia the temple.</page><page sequence="15">Granoff 2 Defining Sacred Place 15 III. Redefining the sacred : the sacred site as sacred object. I have argue J thus far that one strategy orthodox priests used to ensure that the holy site was not seen as synonymous with the temple was to create an alternative ritual structure that took place outside the temple itself and that focussed on ritual objects other thin the main object in the temple, the care oF which had been delegated to priests of lower status. In other cases, the alternative ritual structure make no use of ritual objects at all. The sto- ries about the Gandharva and his daughter making their own liñgas were an important part of this overall strategy to create a sacred space that could be seen as an alternative to the sacred space of the temple, as were the ritual instructions to bathe and give gifts to the Brahmins without worshipping any particular images or liñgas as part of the ritual. I would now like to turn to the peculiar detail in the story of the consecration of the liñga that I had sin- gled out earlier. Tnis is the statement that the main object of worship in the temple was in fact erected over an invisible sacred object that only the priest- god Brahmä could worship. That invisible sacred object has become a part of the holy ground itself ; buried deep within the earth it makes possible the existence of the visible object of worship in the temple. It also, I suspect, could be seen to detract from the ultimate importance of the linga worshi- pped in the temple. True sanctity resides in the unseen eternal linga that the temple priests cannot worship. There is another Šaiva mãthãtmya that I believe can help us to under- stand the significance of this story of the buried or hidden linga that is in effect part of the terrain of the site itself. The Arunãcalamãhãtmya , also included in the Skanda Purãna, is devoted to the cult of Šiva at Aruçãcala, which is actually the site of the enormous temple complex in Tiruvannamalai.1J The temple is even a more minor presence in this text than it was in the Prabhãsa* mãhãtmya. Indeed the sacred object of the site is not a particular image oc linga in a temple, but the mountain itself. Again and again the text tells us that Šiva took the form of the mountain, which was once a pillar of fire, just as the linga is often likened to a pillar of fire : jyotirmayam idam rãpam arunäcalasamjftitam / ye namanti narã bhaktyã te bhavanty amarãdhikãh // 1.2. 32 M This site has been the subject of an exhaustive study by a group of French scholars who have published their results in many volumes, beginning with two volumes of inscrip" lions edited by P. R Srinivasan with indexes and topography by Maiie-Louise Reinj- çhe, Pondichéry : Institut Francais de Pondichéry, 1990,</page><page sequence="16">16 Annals BORI , LXXIX ( 1998 ) " Those people who in faith worship this form of mine that is made of light and called Arunãcala, will be greater than the gods." The mountain is said to be the sum total of all the merit on earth. It is in essence Šiva himself, and is worshipped by all the gods ; and being wor- shipped it grants every wish (1.2. 61- d2 ). The god Šiva is most pleased when his devotee sees this mountain ( 1. 13. 47 ). The mountain is the linga of Šiva which appeared in time past ( 1. 4. 35 ). This text, then sees the holy object not as something conined in the temple, but as the entirety of the sacred territory.11 There is no question of temple priests and tending a special image in this text ; there is instead the vast stretch of this sacred mountain itself. There is no greater contrast in the understanding of sacred space than perhaps the understanding that emer- ges from a reading of this text and what one take away from a reading of the many inscriptions at the actual temple site of Arunãcala, The AruçScala of the inscriptions is a vast administrative center controlled by temple priests of varying titles and castes. The inscriptions record gifts of land, livestock, and ritual objects ; gifts of money for the performance of special festivals and rituals are minutely documented in these inscriptions. The entire religious life of the site according to these inscriptions is focussed on the temple and is overseen by those in charge of the temple. Their many different voices, indeed their presence, seem absent from the Sanskrit mãhãtmya text. In the Sanskrit text the focus of attention is the mountain itself as sacred object ; the temple receives no attention. I interpret this as akin to the phenomenon I sought to describe for the Prabhãsamãhãtmya ; that is, as a strategy of those who were profoundly ambivalent about temple service to secure for themselves some ritual role in an established temple cult. In the case of the Arunãcalamãhãtmya , I will suggest below that this focus on the mountain probably reflects ambivalence rather than the stronger expli- cit hostility of the Prabhãsamãhãtmya . I suspect that this is so because of the explicit focus of conflict in sectarian terms in the Arunãcalamãhãtmya . Nonetheless, the text shows an unmistakable desire to shift attention away from the temple with its icon onto a broader holy site, thit at least poten- tially exists outside the control of those in charge of the temple. That today the circumambulation of the mountain is a private rather than public affair, 14 With this might be compared the notion in Pustimãrga Vaisnavism that Mt. Govardhan is a form of Kr^na. See Paul M. Toomey, Food from the Mouth of Krishna l Feasts and Festivities in a North Indian Pilgrimage Centre , Delhi : Hindu- Stan Publishing Corporation, 1994, pp. 22-23.</page><page sequence="17">Granoff ¡ Defining Sacred PI aee 17 not controlled by the temple priests, but belonging to the solitary pursuits of the renunciates, might help confirm this theory.16 I might add that the notion of the liôga as part of the physical site was not confined to this text ; a story is told of a king of Tripura, Dharma- mänikya, who wanted to uproot a liñga and take it back to his capital city with him. He was unable to move the li4ga, which was rooted under* ground, a part of the mountain itself.16 Instead, instructed by a dream, he sets up an image of the goddess Tripurasundarl in his royal city. The story of Dharmam9çikya makes a similar point, I think; the deity of the site canndt be made the special properly of any one group. Coextensive with the site itself, the deity escapes the confines of total ritual control by any sin gle party. The Sãbhramatlmãhãtmya, which is included in the Padìna Pura nat Uttarakhunda , beginning with chapter 131, similarly stresses that there is no liñga, no special object of worship there. The entire site is to be regarded as sacred. In the words of the text, na Ungarn variate taira mamaikam naganandïni // 131.91b sthõnamâtram tu tat raiva màmakam ndtra samša - yah ¡I 13 J. 92a " O daughter of the mountain ! There is no linga of mine there, but there is no doubt that the very place itself belongs to me. " Simi- larly in the same chapter at verse 1 10 we hear, " sthanam eva sadä Ungarn jñatavyam buddhibhih sadã " The wise are to know that the place itself is my liñga.'! The verse goes on to say that the place should be worshipped with the very offerings that are more usually made to a liñga pr anthropo- morphic image. Later in the text we are told that in the Kali Yuga, when wickedness overwhelms the world, the liñga is hidden. Devotees are to make earthen images and worship them instead ( 147. 56. 66 ).17 In this text the absence of a temple and main object of worship is both striking and doubly explained : there never was a liñga, since the site itself is sacred and does not 16 See vol 2 pf the Tiruvannamali setť p. 19. With this might be compared the remarks of Holly Baker Reynolds on Madurai, " Madurai : Koyik Nakar", in Journal of Developing Societies, Vol. II, 1986, pp. 182-183, where she highlights the fact that the place Madurai and its topographical features are devoid of any primary sanctity ; the focus is entirely on the temple. Thus the city is not circumambulated. Reynolds contrasts this with the belief in the sanctity of Mt. Govardhana as Kfsna and the belief in the Ganges as a god. One might also contrast this view of Madurai with the understanding of Arunãcala in the mahatmya texs. 16 The story is retold in Surendranath Ray, Bangdeser Tirtha Vivaran , Tripurã, Bengali year 1320. p. 32. 17 The text is edited in the XnandSs'rama Sanskrit Sçrjesf Pupe, 1894t % [ Annals BORI J</page><page sequence="18">It Annals BORI, LXXIX ( 1998 ) need to be further sanctified by the presence of a holy object, and the sacred objects have been concealed in this age of sinners when they might well have been defiled. I would like to see behind such statements, possibly among other motives, a desire on the part of certain priestly circles to minimize the importance of worship in a main cultic site or of one particular image. IV. Brahmins and gods : the compromise All of the mãhãtmya texts that I have examined to date unmistakably betray the hands of Brahmin authors. I have taken the Prabhãsamãhãtmya here a$ an obvious example. Brahmins in this text are the equals if not the superiors of the gods. Thus we are told that the gods are invisible in their heaven, but the Brahmins are the visible gods here on earth : brãhmanãí coiva devãí ca teja ekam dvidhã krtam / 22 /65b pratyaksam brahmano devãh parokqam divi devaíãh / na vinã brãhamanã devait na d&gt;.vã brãhmartair vinã //66 yad brãhmanãh slutyatamã vadami tad devaíãh karmabhir ácaranti¡ tuftefu íustãfi sat at a m bhavanti pratyaksadevefu paroksadevãh // 70 " The Brahmins and the gods are one power, divided into two. The Brah&lt; mins are the visible gods, while the others are the invisible deities in heaven. Whatever the Brahmins, most praiseworthy of all, say, that the gods do with their actions. When the visible gods are satisfied, then the invisible gods are also satisfied. " Id an unusual story in chapter 29 we are even told that there was even a short time when the balance of power between the gods and the Brahmins seemťá to be in favor of the Brahmins. The gods, we learn, once made a huge sacrifice. They agreed to give to the Brahmin priests as sacrificial fee virtually everything that they possessed. But then suddenly, out of no where, more Brahmins arrive and demand gifts. The gods do not know what to do and they take to their heels. They hide in the ocean. But the brahmins in those days could fly and they take off after the gods and find them. The gods are desperate and resort to a trick. They conceal fish in the gift of food that they give the Brahmins. The trusting Brahmins eat the food aâd lose their ability to fly on account of the sin they have committed by eating some- thing that is forbidden to them. They curse the ocean for its part in the gods' deception and say that it cannot be touched by men. The ocean pleads with them and is granted a respite from the curse at certain times in the year, when it is said, bathing in the ocean brings merit and cleanses siq.</page><page sequence="19">Granoff i Defining Sacred Place 19 Stories such as these, I think, make clear the intention of the text to proclaim Brahmanical superiority. I have tried to argue that it is in this context that we are to seek to understand what at first is a puzzling feature of these texts : the fact that although they are written about sites on which stood major temple complexes, they seem relatively indifferent to or downright hostile to the practices of temple worship. I would like to understand the abundance of smaller holy sites in the larger whole as part of an effort to ensure that no one holy place, in particular the temple, was given undue emphasis. I have similarly interpreted the proliferation of rituals, in which objects of worship other than the main image in the temple are the focus of ritual activity. But it would be misleading to assume that the Brahmanical take over of the holy site was so easily accomplished by stories and rituals. If, on the one hand the Prabhãsamãhãtmya Í3 unambiguous in its condem- nation of those who serve the temple, it nonetheless does make a place for worship at the temple from time to time. In chapter 23 we are given a description of the fruits of pilgrimage to PrabhSsa. The chapter begins by saying that in this degenerate age, filled with sia, there is no other way to fi id dharma and heaven ( 9 ). Only those who are filled with pure faith and make the pilgrimage to PrabhSsa in this degenerate age fulfill their desires ; all others live in vain ( 10 ). We are then given some rules for making the pilgrimage ; it should be done on foot and by members of any of the four castes ( 20 ). Financing the pilgrimage for those who cannot afford it themselves yields a result four times greater than that from making the pilgrimage on one's own ( 23 ). Pilgrims are instructed to share with others, particularly members of thîir family, the merit that they acquire on the pilgrimage ( 39-41 ). One can even make an effigy of someone and immerse it; that person gets a portion of the merit (42). There follow rules for making gifts, for shaving the head ; there are rules for the different castes ; for offering oblations to the ancestors ( šrSddha, vs 73 ) and particular rules for widows ( 79ff). There are some instructions for kings, particularly concerning gifts ( 90-92 ), and then once again the offer* ings to ancestors and fire sacrifices ( 96-97 ). At some of the famous lingas, we are told, the pilgrim is to offer a bull ( 98 ). These are clearly all rules and rituals that reflect Brahmin priestly interests ; it was the Brahmins to whom one was to make the great gifts and it was exclusively the Brahmin priests and not the temple priests who were permitted to make the offerings to the ancestors. But what, then, are we to make of the next verses ? Jagatïm cãrcayed bhaktyã íathã caivopalepayet / prasãdam dhavalam saudhart kãrayej jlrnam uddharet // 99</page><page sequence="20">20 Annals BORI, LXXIX ( 1998 ) puspavâtî m snànakùpam nirmalam kãrayed vrat ï / brõhmanãnãm bhüridänam devapujãkarãya ca // lOO " And he should worship plinth of the temple with great faith and coat it with white-wash ; should make the great temple white and repair what has fallen apart. Observing the proper ritual restrictions, he should make a garden of flowers and a well with clean water for bathing. He should give great gifts to the Brahmins and the one who is in charge of worhipping the god in the temple. •* In these last verses we are reminded of the otherwise invisible presen :e of the temple, its god and those in charge of its worhip. From time to time the presence of the temple intrudes on the scenery, reminding us that we are dealing with a complex text and a complex phenomenon. The text is a continuation of Brahmanical response, negative response, to temple worship. At the same time it was written about a site famed above all for its temple. The Brahmins might in their text relegate the priests to a lower status and offer alternative objects of worship, one of which was right in the temple itself, though hidden from view. But in end they could not ignore entirely the temple cult, its priests or its holy object. There are also more detailed descriptions of rituals devoted to Some* švara, the main god in the temple. In chapter 30, for example, Pärvati asks áiva how the pilgrim should proceed during the pilgrimage. Šiva replies that first the pilgrim is to bathe in the ocean and offer there a bracelet of gold ; next he should make offering to the pitfs or ancestors ( 1-3 ). Next the pil- grim goes to worship the minor deity, the yak§a Kapardin, with flowers» ¡acense, and clothes and other offerings accompanied by the recitation pf mantras ( 4 ). The pilgrim finally proceeds to Somešvara and bathes the god and recites a number of hymns of praise ( 6 ). The pilgrim is to bathe Some- svara with milk and curds mixed with ghee, with honey and sugar cane juice he or she is to anoint Somešvara with saffron paste ( 7 ). The pilgrim then worships with other fragrant substances, sandal, camphor, musk and incense ( 8 ). Following this the pilgrim waves lamps in front of Somešvara and Rances ; he is to prostrate himself and then worship with song and music (10). A theatrical performance is to be performed and finally gifts are to be given to the brahmins and ascetics ( 11 ). One might note that here too, although the worship is done in the temple, presumably under the supervision of the temple priests, room is. still made for gifts to the Brahmins.</page><page sequence="21">GRANoFř i Defining Sacred Place 2J Io another description of the pilgrimage, however, the worship of Somesvara in the temple is underemphasized. This occurs in chapter 35, after a long description of the river Sarasvatl. Sarasvatl is instructed by the gods to take the burning fire Vãdava and deposit in the ocean. The VSdava had been creatcd by the son of the sage Dadhlci, to kill the gods. The gods had deposited their weapons with Dadhlci, but he drank their vital power and abandoned the weapons themselves. When the gods come to claim them, he offers them his bones to make new weapons. His son decides the gods are thus responsible for Dadhici's death, although it was an act of volun- tary suicide. We are given a long account of Sarasvati's trials and tribula- tions as she goes' to deposit the burning Vädava in the ocean so that it will consume the waters and leave other creatures alone. Át the end of this account we find Sarasvatl settled at PrabhSsa. And here the pilgrimage to PrabhSsa is differently described. First the pilgrim is to worship Sarasvatl and then the ocean ( 111). The sight of the ocean is said to be as purifying as the site of a fire altar (112). The pilgrim next is to bathe at the Agnitir- tha and offer guggula, a fragrant resin; into a sacrificial fire ( 113 ). Next the pilgrim worships Sarasvatl and Kapardin, and then follows a list of gods who are to be worshipped, KedSra, Bhlmešvara, Bhairavešvara, Caijdîsvara, Somesvara and the nine Navagrahešvaras and eleven Rudras(118). The pilgrim then worships BrahmS. This is the pilgrimage to Rudra, or Raudri Yatrã (119). What should be clear from this account is that the worship óf Somesvara, the main god in the temple, is given a very minor role ill the whole pilgrimage process. Somesvara is only one of many deities to be worshipped. Even his position in the list is unremarkable ; he is sandwiched inbetween other deities without any particular importance being accorded to his worship. Contrasting passages like these, some of which emphasize worship in the temple and others of which either minimize it or provide for worship of different images and in an alternate setting, by no means represent the only points of tension in this text. What makes the PrabhãsamShãtmya so challen- ging to the modern schblar is that it seeks to reconcile a number of largely inconsistent viewpoints. The text also struggles with the basic question of who may worship at the holy site ; are its benefits open to all, even the most egregious of sinners, or does it somehow withhold its benefits from all büt the elect ? In maay mShãtmya texts pilgrimage sites offer the promise of universal salvation. For example, the Matsya Purãna in its description of Varatasi stresses that even the individual who is addicted to pleasures of the senses and has abandoned the path of the righteous, gains release from samara by dying at Avimukta Kfetra ( 180.71-72 ). The text also says that</page><page sequence="22">22 Annals BORI, LXXIX (1998) there is no sin so great that it is not eradicated when one enters Avimukta Kçetra (18). 17' 18 ).18 Even the Prabhãsamãhãtmya can say that even the person who is totally without faith gains the full fruit of making a pilgrimage ( 28. Ill- 1 12 ). We are told that PrabhSsa cannot be touched by sin ; both the righteous and the wicked go to heaven there ( 28. 1 18-119 ). But earlier in the text we had been explicitly warned that all the holy places on earth had to be concealed from the wicked ( 3. 123 ). In 4. 85 we are told that sinners do not get to die there and to go to heaven. There is a long list of fierce beings who prohibit access to those who are evil ( 4. 100 ). In chapter 38 of the text, after the pilgrimage, where the pilgrim is instructed to worship Kapardin, the goddess asks Siva why his servant is to be worshipped before Šiva himself is honored. The story told in answer to this question is relevant, I think, to the problem of dealing with the importance of the god in the temple that I have tried to identify as the main problematic of the text. The story is told that the god in the temple, Somešvara, was so power- ful that seeing him even once led to release for even the worst of sinners. As a consequence, in this degenerate age the most abject sinners were going to heaven and no one was bothering any more to perform the Vedic rites( 9 ). The gods were being crowded out of heaven and Yama, whose job it was to send people to hell, was left virtually unemployed. The gods seek the help of &amp;va, who tells them to petition the goddess. She creates from her bodily dirt a four-armed, elephant-headed being, to create obstacles for pilgrims. This is Kapardin. He strikes people with delusion, making them think about their wives, their children, their homes and possessions. And blinded by this delusion they do not see the god ( 39 ). In other cases he makes the pilgrims sick, so that they cannot see the god ( 40 ). For this reason, he must be propitiated at the start of every pilgrimage. This story may help us to understand why at the beginning of chapter 38 Somešvara was called " atlndriyagrãhya M the one who cannot be gras- ped by the normal process of perception ", or " the one who is beyond the range of the senses. " The text seems to intimate that the main deity of the temple is not accessible to just any pilgrim. The wicked, who are defined as those who do not perform the Vedic rituals, are hindered from seeing the u We shall see, however, that this is not the only view of access to the sacred site.

One needs to achieve special sight through the propitiation of Kapardin and the performance of Vedic rituals in order to benefit from seeing Somešvara. In this passage, I think we might also see yet another strategy to redefine the sacred at Prabhãsa. The main deity is no longer simply visible to all ; it can only be seen by those who conduct various rituals, among them the propitiation of Kapardin.19 If the actual worship of Some- švara ia the temple was controlled by a group other than the orthodox Brahmin priests, in this account the orthodox Brahmins nonetheless ultima- tely retain control over just who can perform that worship. The task of defining the wicked seems relatively simple in the Prabhã • samãhãtmya, where the wicked are simply anyone who does not perform Vedic rituals, as the text says, purã dvãparasandhau tu samprãpte ca kalau yuge striyo mlecchâé ca šUdraš ca y e cãnye pãpakõrinah / prayãnti svargam evašu drstvã somešvaram prabhum // 9 na yajnã na tapo danam na svãdhyãyo vratam na ca / kurvanto 9 pi narã devi sarve y anti šivalayam //10 " Formerly, at the end of the Dväpara age and the beginning of the Kali ¿ ge, women, barbarians, sadrás and other wicked people all went right to heaven on seeing the Lord Somešvara, There were no more sacrifices ; there was no more practice of austerities and no more giving of gifts. No one practi- sed Vedic recitation anymore or observed any ritual restrictions. And without doing any of this everyone went to heaven, O Goddess ! The text is transparent in its intentions when it groups together women, barbarians and ŠUdras as " wicked " ; these are the three groups traditionally barred from performing the Vedic sacrifice. To the Brahmin priests, then, the problem with a powerful god in a sacred site, was clear. Allowing a pilgrim to achieve ths religious goal by seeing the god in the tempie left no room for the rituals of the Brahmin priests. Our story aims at a compromise ; the god is powerful, but it is only the power of the Brah- min priests and their rituals that can secure access to the god. The sacred centre is not just the one god in the temple ; the pilgrim has to worship 19 I have been studying the notion of the 4&lt; hidden " god in pilgrimage texts.

There we are told that Avimukta cannot be seen by those who are not devoted to Šiva ( 184. 62-64 ). The issue is less overtly one of ritual and priestly control, but more of theism itself. A stronger statement in 185.46-48 elaborates upon this, including as sinners those who detest Brahmins and the gods, those who deny faith in the gods, killers of Brahmins, the ungrateful, those who are disrespectful of their gurus and those who deny the efficacy of holy places. Belief in god still remains a key issue. For the Prabhãsamãhãtmya worship of Šiva is no longer in question ; the issue has shifted entirely to the priests who supervise that worship and thus to the nature of the rituals themselves. If we turn to our second text, the Arunãcalamãhãtmya, we see that the question of who has access to the sacred site can be very complicated indeed. In chapter 11 of this text is a i interesting version of the famous story of the goddess killing the buffalo demon. Here the goddess becomes frightened after she cuts off the head of the demon, for she sees a linga around his neck. She fears that she has sinned by killing a devotee of the lord, The answer that Šiva gives her is basically this : it is good to kill those who are not devotees ; wearing à liñga does not mean that one is a true devotee. The linga has to be properly consecrated. We are back to the issue of priestly control and the defìniton of sacred space. We now see that the issue goes beyond ortho- dox Brahmins / temple priests and enters into a world of sectarian claims of which we can only have a glimpse through the text itself.21 20 This paper does not deal with the actual situation of temple priests and rituals today. Nonetheless, it seems worth noting that the status of the temple priests at a site like Cidambaram today reflects the basic conflicts I am trying to read out of the mãhntmya texts. Thus the main temple priests, the Diksitas, are «considered to be of low status and are disparaged by high-status Brahman priests. These high status priests, however, do have some role in the temple cult ; they perform the fire sacrifice and the srãddha rituals, for high fees. See David Smith, The Dance of Šiva : Religion , art and poetry in South India, Cambridge ; Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 58. I would add that these are some of the main rituals enjoined in our mahïïtmya texts, suggesting as 1 am arguing that these texts transmit to us the voices and struggles of the orthodox priests at these temple sites, as they try to carve out a ritual space for themselves. 81 Hermann Kulke has analyzed the Cidambaramãhãtmya as revealing the struggle of a Brahmin priesthood with a non-orthodox bhakti religion, the struggle between follow- ers of a cult of the worship of the liã ga and those who worshipped the dancing Siva, and hostility between the liàga cult and a cult of a mother goddess. See Kulke Cidam- baramahatmya , cited earlier. I am trying to see in the Prabhãsamãhntmya and ( Continued on 4he next page )</page><page sequence="25">Granoff : Defining Sacred Place 25 These two texts seemed to agree in their overall perspective; both were interested in Brahmins and those rituals Brahmins normally supervised. Both sought ways to minimize the importance of the temple cult; the Arunãcalamã- hãtmya mentioned a temple only once, in 1. 8, when the sage Gautama comes to Arunäcala as part of an extended pilgrimage site and asks Šiva how his worship is to be conducted on earth. At that Šiva commanded Višvakarman to build a temple and a divine city. The temple is made of jewels. The text tells us that the temple is to be woi shipped ( 64), but other than these verses the temple never again figures in the text. The bulk of the stories are miracle stories associated with worshipping the mountain, which we have seen the text considers to be the holy object and holy site combined. With the story about the demon wearing the liňga we seem to enter yet another arena of conflict, between some devotees who have correctly consecrated ritual objects and others who do not. The sacred space belongs primarily to those with the proper ritual imprimatur, though beyond that we know little else. The Prabhãsamãhãtmya is both more explicit and less explicit about the boundaries of its sacred site. They are for the most part clearly closed boun- daries, carefully guarded by semi-divine figures. There is a place for the temple priests, albeit a circumscribed one. The excluded ones are only broad« ly designated as sinners, pãpinah ; they are ones whose minds have been stained by the taint of the Kali age ( 4. 100 ). From the well-known discourse about the Kali Yuga in other texts we can fill in some of the missing infor- mation ; sinners in the Kali age are those who do not revere the Brahmins and usurp the roles of others. They are those who do not perform the Vedic rituals. They are often the archetypical others, mlecchas, foreigners, those outside the Hindu fold. It is worth noting that mãhãtmya texts often state that holy site is the one place that is left after the destruction of the universe that occurs at the end of the Kali age. Thus speaking of Vãrãnasi and Prayäga, the Matsya Purãna says that both are left untouched by the Kali age ( 183. 40; 111.4). Thus the question of who is admitted into the site also becomes a question of who is spared the agonies of the world destruction at the end of the Kali age.2* ( Continued from p. 24 ) the Arunůcalamahatmya a fundamental conflict between orthodox priests and image worship in general, and beyond that the traces of sectarian differences at the sites. Of the two texts I have used here, the Arunkcalamahatmya seems at least in certain pla- ces to be easier to read as a text written in the heat of sectarian arguments. 23 It would be interesting to know to what extent the venerable concept of declining world ages and a periodic renewal through destruction of the universe became in these texts ( Continued :on the next f&gt;a(e. J 4 ' Annal» BORI J</page><page sequence="26">26 Annals BORI, LXXIX ( 1998 ) In summary, the two texts studied here, the Arunãcalamãhãtmya and the Prabhãsamãhãtmya, though different from each other, share some common concerns in defining sacred space. The sacred space is defined as extending beyond the temple or as existing outside the temple. At the same time, both texts afford a large role to orthodox Brahmin priests in supervising rituals and receiving ritual gifts. Finally, both texts, though they extend the sacred space to as large an area as possible, seek ultimately to restrict access and control its benefits. The Arunãcalamãhãtmya is more explicit and more obviously sectarian, while the Prabhãsamãhãtmya seems willing to include all and sundry who respect Brahmanical norm. I am tempted to interpret this difference as a reflection of a situation in which orthodox priests had come to terms with image worship and accepted the function of serving as temple priests, as we know to be the case today at Aruçãcala.23 Both agree, however, that the ultimate say belongs with some Brahmin priests, either those who consecrate the devotee's liñga, or with the larger group who perform the rites for the ancestors and the ritual offerings in the fire. Both texts tlun allow prisstly concerns to define the shape and substance of the sacred site. In addition, both texts ultimately are involved in achieving a compro- mise; for if the priests of (he Prabhãsamãhãtmya shy away from service in the main temple they do so in the end only by accepting a plethora of competing sacred objects. And it the priests of the Arunãcalamãhãtmya reduce the im- portance in the text of the temple and stress the worship of the mountain, they still worship the mountain as a liňga, in the idipm of the image worship that was at the root of their discontents. There seems in fact to be a closer relationship between the Arunãcalamãhãtmya and its myths and the temple worship at the site than is obvious with th Prabhãsamãhãtmya and the Soma- nãtha temple. The story of the fiery linga told in the Arurtãcalamãhãtmya was represented in icons at the site; even the mountain, reduced to a triangu- ( Continued from j&gt;, 25. ) the basis for a kind of millenarian ideology, it is perhaps not accidental that the Prabhãsamãhãtmya which excludes all non-Vedic and fore'gn elements from the site also gives aifairly detailed account of Kalkin, the incarnation of Visnu who is to destroy the world and particularly its foreign inhbitants. See chapter 19 on Kalkin. The fourth volume of the series on Tiruvannamali by Marie-Louise Reiniche is devoted to the priesthood and shows how complex the situation is. On p. 81 Reiniche notes the importance of the dìksa or consecration to the priesthood ; it is not sufficient to be of the right caste or family. This confirms what I suspected from a reading of the mñhü- tmya ; the issue in this text is less one of brahmin priests / image worshipping priests, but of which Saiva group is the true one.</page><page sequence="27">Granoff : Defining Sacred Place 21 lar form, figured on stele which were themselves objects of worship.91 The Arupãcalamãhãtmya may well be more comfortable with image worship and find more problematic competing sectarian groups than the Prõbhãstb mãhãtmya. V. Conclusions While I have dealt here with only two texts out of a diverse and exten« sive body of literature, I hope that the hypothesis I have advanced will be of use in further study. My basic supposition has been that the texts I studied here are struggling with a role for an orthodox priesthood that rejects or is at least uncomfortable with image worship at sacred sites primarily known for their temples and images.95 I was led to this theory by the texts themselves. First there is the story in the Prabhãsamãhãtmja, in which the orthodox priests refuse to serve in the temple. And then there is the peculiar fact that cannot fail to strike the reader of this literature : just how little space and attention the texts give to the temple and its image and rituals. The Arupã- calamãhãtmya defines the sacred object not as an image in the temple, but at the mountain itself, with the image in the temple merely a substitute for the mountain as liñga, and the Prabhãsamãhãtmya offers numerous competing objects of worship, devoting very little space to the temple and Somešvara by comparison. This led me in turn to try to understand some of the recurring themes in the texts as strategies to deal with this single basic problem. No doubt it has also led me to simplify the texts and read selectively, but I hope it will nonetheless prove to have been a useful reading.

IS. ÎB I would stress that the genre of tbe mãhãtmya texts is diverse. While my suspicion is that many if not most of the mãhãtmyã-s included today in the puratta-s represent the voice of the •' orthodox clearly this is not the case for all known mãhãtmya-s. The Cidambara mãhãtmya in contrast to the texts i studied here struggles to establish the high status and resectability of the Cidambara priests. See David Smith, p€ 62.</page></plain_text>
