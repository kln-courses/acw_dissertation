<plain_text><page sequence="1">MAX OLIVER HOCUTT The Logical Foundations of Peirce's Aesthetics INTRODUCTION There is a sense in which it might be said that Charles Peirce had no aesthetics. Cer- tainly his writings on the subject are the merest fragments. Probably the best single explanation of this fact is that Peirce was wedded to logic and knew her to be a satisfying spouse. A contented husband is, like any other hus- band, frequently distracted by charming young things-but usually only for fleeting moments. Peirce was no exception. He had a recurring interest in aesthetics but never pursued any aesthetic question to its con- summation. Perhaps because of Kant's in- fluence, he was a long time seeing how aesthetics was to be made into a logical en- terprise. This might seem to make doubly impos- sible any meaningful talk about the "logical foundations of Peirce's aesthetics." Not so MAX OLIVER HOCUTT is Asst. Prof. of philosophy at the University of South Florida, Tampa. This paper represents a reconstruction and rewrite of ideas expressed in my doctoral thesis, "The Logical Foundations of Peirce's Theory of Values," presented to the Philosophy Faculty of the Grad- uate School of Yale University in 1960. I wish to thank Prof. John E. Smith who directed my thesis and Prof. James Feibleman of Tulane University who introduced me to philosophy and to Peirce. I should also like to acknowledge a grant from the Southern Fellowship Fund for the period 1957- 1960. however. Late in his career (circa 1893) Peirce began to discern an intimate rela- tionship between logic and aesthetics which he had previously thought could not exist (2.197).1 And though he never fully realized it, he had already laid a foundation in his theory of signs (i.e., his logic) for aesthetics. By taking our cue from Peirce's scattered remarks about aesthetics and working in the light of his philosophy as a whole, it is possible to construct a comprehensive and extremely interesting aesthetic theory in terms of his theory of signs. The aim of the present paper is to briefly expose and comment on this aesthetics. Three topics will constitute the account: (1) Art as Icon, (2) Beauty as Kalos, and (3) The Sense of Beauty as an Emotional In- terpretant. But first some preliminary re- marks about these topics. C. W. Morris published a paper in 1939 designed to show that aesthetics can be in- corporated into the general theory of signs if we regard the work of art as an icon.2 Prof. Morris did not mention Peirce in his 1939 essay, but it represents a legitimate de- velopment of ideas Peirce had already ex- pressed. It is well known that Morris' sem- iotic was taken from Peirce. In particular, the term icon is Peirce's. Peirce had also suggested that the work of art is an icon by describing various types of art works as iconic signs at one time or another. (See, e.g., 8.183, 3.362, 5.475.)</page><page sequence="2">158 MAX OLIVER HOCUTT The second topic, Peirce's definition of beauty, has had an excellent discussion by J. K. Feibleman.3 Beauty, of course, is what differentiates aesthetic icons from other icons. As Prof. Feibleman makes clear, Peirce had the thoroughly Greek and ob- jectivist conception of beauty as kalos. Fei- bleman's account must, therefore, be added to Morris' if we are to have an adequate statement of Peirce's aesthetics. But even the two together are not enough, and our third topic is needed to round out the account. According to Peirce, every sign situation involves three things: sign, object, and interpretant. If the aesthetic sign is an icon and its object is beauty, its only proper significate effect, according to Peirce, is an emotional in- terpretant (5.475). No one, as far as I know, has discussed this third topic or showed that all three topics may be integrated into one systematic theory of aesthetics based on the theory of signs. Art as Icon EXPOSITION. That the work of art is some kind of sign or other Peirce believed could be established on the grounds that it con- veys the ideas of the artist. For example, "The performance of a piece of concerted music is a sign. It conveys and is intended to convey the composer's musical ideas" (5.475). The term ideas does not refer to intellections; it refers to feelings. The "ideas" of a composer "usually consist merely in a series of feelings" (ibid.). That the work of art is an iconic sign is obvious when we consider that the icon is the only kind of sign suited to convey feel- ings. An icon signifies its object by being simi- lar to it. Or, put another way, similarity is the ground of representation of the icon (2.247). Since things may be similar either in virtue of their mathematical form or be- cause of similar qualities, there are two basic kinds of icons, mathematical and aes- thetic. The mathematician's drawing is an icon in virtue of similarity of structure. Art objects are icons in virtue of similarity of quality. In Peirce's terminology, qualities are ob- jectively what feelings are subjectively. Consequently, it is by embodying the ap- propriate qualities that art works are capa- ble of "conveying" the feelings of artists. Also, the aesthetic value of a work of art lies in the qualities it possesses. Speaking in the strictest sense, a work of art is not an icon, but a hypoicon (2.277). A hypoicon is a substantially embodied icon, a pure icon being an essence or pla- tonic idea. The distinction here is much the same (though not precisely) as that made by Morris between a sign and the vehicle of that sign.4 The art object qua object is a sign-vehicle; qua art it is a sign. In the strictest sense, then, an aesthetic icon is whatever set of qualities is possessed by a work of art. One pecularity of the icon is that it may be identical with its object. This is to be expected, since identity is the limit of simi- larity. (What could be more like a thing than itself?) Where the iconic sign is not identical with the object it represents, it is still necessary that, in contemplating it, we should be able to ignore any differences which may exist between it and its object. To take an example from mathematics, a geometrical diagram such as a triangle will serve the purposes of mathematical reasoning only if it does not differ in any relevant respects from the abstract triangle it represents to the mathematician. Having a good diagram, a mathematician is en- abled to proceed with his operations. It is as if he were really interested in that par- ticular drawing. The same breakdown in the distinction between sign and object occurs with art icons. Indeed, whenever this breakdown is noticed, we have an icon: ... in contemplating a painting there is a mo- ment when we lose consciousness that it is a thing, the distinction between the real and the copy disappears, and is for the moment a pure dream -not any particular existence, yet not general. At that moment we are contemplating an icon. (3.362) A related peculiarity of the icon is that it requires no existential object, only a pos- sible object (2.255). The objects primarily represented by icons are platonic ideas or</page><page sequence="3">The Logical Foundations of Peirce's Aesthetics 159 essences, entities neither specific nor gen- eral, but strictly universal and real inde- pendently of their actualization in either thoughts or things. An essence, whether a form or a quality, is a possibility for in- stantiation which may be represented whether it has been previously instantiated or not. It follows from the identity of the icon with an essence and from the possibility that it may be identical with its object, that an icon may be self-representative. An icon is also utterly devoid of assertive value. Thus, we can contemplate a work of art in and for itself. If the art object conveys the ideas of the artist, it is through direct in- spection of that object by ourselves, not because of any effort on our part to "under- stand" the ideas or intent of the artist. COMMENTARY. Two points need to be made here. The first concerns the denota- tion of the term "art object." Since what is emphasized by Peirce in the description of the icon is its properties, either qualities or forms, and not the act of producing it, I think it is safe to say that "natural" objects of aesthetic interest would be included in its denotation. Subscription to Peirce's aes- thetics will not, therefore, require us also to subscribe to some anthropomorphic idea of a divine "artist" in order to account for the fact that mountain scenes are often beautiful. A better term than "work of art" or "art object" would perhaps be "aes- thetic object." The second point concerns the way in which one would account, in terms of Peirce's theory of art, for various artistic "programs" and "techniques." It might seem possible to infer from the fact that the ground of significance of an icon is similarity, that art is, as Aristotle main- tained, imitative. This would seem to rule out all "non-realistic" or "non-represenrta- tional" art forms. Any such interpretation would be mis- taken. One must remember that the object represented by the art icon need not be actual. Consequently, the artist may be as imaginative or as abstractive as he desires. Peirce, who had studied Schiller's Esthe- tische Briefe, was, in fact, much impressed by the importance of free imagination in art. But an image is itself a sort of icon. There is nothing in Peirce's view of art to suggest that "realism" is the only legiti- mate or proper art technique. Since there need be no existential counterpart for the aesthetic icon, invidious comparisons of works of art with actual things are irrele- vant. The work of art must be appreciated for the qualities it possesses itself. Hence, Peirce would probably say that a work of art is imitative only in the sense that it is like, when successful, the particular set and arrangement of qualities intended by the artist. Thus, if a non-representational painter uses a model or paints from a scene and a picture results which does not re- semble the scene, that is no proof the artist has failed. The view that art is icon does not ask a painter to beat the camera at its own game. The model or scene may itself be merely an icon for the artist, something capable of evoking the feelings he wishes to "capture" on canvas. If the aim of the artist is to heighten the effect which certain qualities in the original have under his spe- cial way of regarding them, that is perfectly all right. In Peirce's terms, we should then say that the artist's purpose is to produce an "art" icon superior in representation of select qualities than is the "natural" icon which first called his attention to those qualities. We are thus left entirely free to judge a work of art on its merits, not on whether it conforms to some pre-established conception of "proper" artistic technique. The above point is that the aesthetic value of a work of art does not consist in its relation to some concrete object. It would appear, however, that the aesthetic value of things does consist in their relation to some abstract object on Peirce's theory. Peirce seems committed by his notion of icon to the view of Plato: a work of art is a participant in an essence. The value be- longs primarily to the essence and only secondarily to the object in which that es- sence happens to be ingredient. Indeed, it seems that the work of art represents its essential object in the peculiar way it does precisely because it "participates" in that object.</page><page sequence="4">160 MAX OLIVER HOCUTT This Platonic doctrine explains, how- ever, the difference between the interest of a collector and the interest of an aesthete in a work of art. The collector must have that particular piece of dabbed canvas, but, as far as the aesthete is concerned, an exactly similar reproduction would do just as well. Presented with a choice between an original Cezanne, say, and an indistinguish- able copy, any preference for the original would be something other than aesthetic preference. If this is a fact, the Platonic doctrine is its best explanation. For, accord- ing to that view, the value belongs primar- ily to the universal and only derivatively to the individual. Beauty as Kalos EXPOSITION. To classify art objects as icons is only to state their sign-genus. All icons are not, however, aesthetic icons. In particular, there are also mathematical icons. It is necessary, therefore, to specify what distinguishes the aesthetic icon from others. But that, clearly, is aesthetic value or beauty. Thus, the problem reduces to discovering a satisfactory notion of beauty. Let us back up a bit. We are seeking to identify and describe, if possible, something which is admirable in and of itself (1.611f). Aesthetic value is intrinsic value, and the beautiful object must be fitted by its own internal features to be admired. This is an objectivist theory; that is, beauty is con- ceived as a quality of objects which exists independently of our appreciation of those objects. It is doubtful that Peirce would have admitted Mill's contention that when a thing is admired, it is thereby proved to be admirable. The question of aesthetics may be put in still another way. Beauty is a term which has been progressively narrowed in modern times. Hence, The science of esthetics has been handicapped by the definition of it as the theory of beauty. The conception of beauty is but the product of this science, and a very inadequate attempt it is to grasp what it is that esthetics seeks to make clear. ... We have not in our language a word of the requisite generality. The Greek kalos, the French beau, only come near to it, without hitting it squarely on the head. "Fine" would be a wretched substitute. Beautiful is bad; because one mode of kalos essentially depends upon the quality being unbeautiful. Perhaps, however, the phrase "the beauty of the unbeautiful" would not be too shocking. Still "beauty" is too skin deep. Using halos, the question of esthetics is, What is the one quality that is, in its immediate presence kalos? (2.199) Probably the most satisfactory English equivalent of kalos is harmony. Of course, a generalized sense of harmony is indicated. What we have in a chord is a series of tones so perfectly integrated that they sound as one. This unity, or integration, gives the chord its musical value. It is in a similar integration of parts that the aesthetic value of any object consists. That is to say, an ob- ject ... to be esthetically good must have a multitude of parts so related to one another as to impart a positive simple immediate quality to their to- tality; and whatever does this is, in so far, es- thetically good, no matter what the particular quality of the total may be. (5.132) As is true of whatever we wish to talk about, the essence of beauty lies in its mathematical form (5.551). Harmony can only result from a certain set of relation- ships. Thus, the beauty of a musical com- position ... consists in the orderliness of the successions of sounds which strike the ear at different times.... We may add that just as a piece of music may be written in parts, each part having its own air, so various systems of relationship of succession sub- sist together between the same sensations. (5.396) Modern logic has divulged that one facet of mathematical form is consistency, and contradiction is a kind of disharmony. Hence, there must be a certain consistency in the work of art. To take an illustration, ... every true poem is a sound argument. But let us compare it rather with a painting-with an impressionistic seashore piece-then every quality in a premise is one of the elementary colored par- ticles of the painting; they are all meant to go together to make up the intended quality that belongs to the whole as whole. That total effect is beyond our ken; but we can appreciate in some measure the resultant Quality of parts of the whole-which Qualities result from the combi- nations of elementary Qualities that belong to the premises. (5.119) Form cannot, however, be equated with</page><page sequence="5">The Logical Foundations of Peirce's Aesthetics 161 kalos. For it is not the form as such that matters, but the quality of the form, or the quality imparted by the form, or the qual- ity in which the form is an essential in- gredient. Beauty is, in short, a quality of which form is a necessary condition, but for which it may not be sufficient. Were two paintings to have the same geo- metrical form, with different colors in each of the several places, the resultant quality of the total might very well be different. Each of the different constituent qualities which are substitution instances of ele- ments in a form makes its own distinctive contribution to the whole. For example, an A played by a cornet in a group of four would give the quartet a different quality than it would have with an oboe playing the same tone. The aesthetic question is whether or not the quality of a thing is an instance of kalos. If a thing has kalos then it has the necessary form. COMMENTARY. Peirce has not improved very much on the classical Greek concep- tion of beauty. His aesthetics as a whole is thoroughly Greek; in fact, Platonic. There is in Peirce the very Greek generalization from music to all the arts, and the very Greek basis of his generalization is mathe- matics. Mathematical form is the para- mount thing said Peirce. Peirce, like the Greeks, thus saw similarities between the artist and the mathematician. This is not surprising in view of the fact that both enterprises deal with icons. He stated: The work of the poet or novelist is not so utterly different from that of the scientific man. The art- ist introduces a fiction; but it is not an arbitrary one; it exhibits affinities to which the mind ac- cords approval in pronouncing them beautiful, which if it is not exactly the same as saying that the synthesis is true is something of the same general kind. The geometer draws a diagram, which if not exactly a fiction, is at least a crea- tion, and by means of observations of that dia- gram he is able to synthesize and show relation- ships between elements which before seemed to have no necessary connection. (1.383) Though Peirce did not improve on the essentials of the Greek conception of beauty, it is clear that his familiarity with mathematical logic suggested some new and interesting applications to him. For ex- ample, he viewed a novel as a kind of logi- cal system in which premises are laid down at the beginning along with transformation rules and which then proceeds to deduce the- orems. The novelist is free to choose his premises, but once having chosen them he must stick by them. If a character is blind at the beginning of a story, for instance, he can- not turn up able to see in the middle of the story unless the author has given us some ex- planation of how this came about. Thus, to quote from Peirce, It is true that when the Arabian romancer tells us that there is a lady named Scherherazade... there is a great deal of fiction in what he is talk- ing about. For the fictive is that whose charac- ters depend upon what characters somebody at- tributes to it; and the story is, of course, the mere creation of the poet's thought. Nevertheless, once he has imagined Scherherazade and made her young, beautiful and endowed her with a gift of spinning stories, it becomes a real fact that so he has imagined her, which fact he cannot destroy by pretending or thinking that he imagined her to be otherwise. (5.152) Most of the criticisms that apply to the Greek notion of beauty apply to Peirce's. One objection, however, does not seem valid. Russell has maligned the doctrine that beauty is form on the grounds that a score would then substitute for a perform- ance. Peirce does not equate beauty with form, however; he is only committed to the doctrine that form of a certain kind is ingredient in beauty. But the emphasis is on the quality of the whole taken in the round, not upon the parts in their analyti- cally conceived relations. Although there are similarities between the mathematical and aesthetic enterprises, there are also fundamental differences. The mathemati- cian, qua mathematician, is interested in analyzing a form. Mathematicians fre- quently have aesthetic experiences in the presence of elegant proofs or systems, but not qua mathematicians. In order to have such experiences, they have got to drop the steps out of sight and contemplate the toute ensemble of reasonings. Peirce might also like to remind Russell that pure form often imparts quality. And one modern musician has answered Rus- sell's objection; he is reported to have said of a piece by Berlioz that he heard the best performance when he read the score. It is a complex problem in which at least three</page><page sequence="6">162 MAX OLIVER HOCUTT propositions seem to be true, and these three probably tell only a small part of the story. Without form of a certain kind there is no beauty; play all the notes in a score at random and the result is cacophony, not music. Form is also sufficient in some cases; a mathematician may experience genuine aesthetic raptures. But form is not always sufficient; fail to play the notes of a score at all and you are left merely with a score, not music. There is one objection to this theory of beauty which it is hard to see how Peirce could answer. There are modern musical compositions of aesthetic worth which em- ploy dissonance and which seem to have tor- tured forms. Analogies can also be found in modern painting and sculpture. It is not easy to see how such works of art can be said to possess kalos. Perhaps kalos, then, denotes too narrow a concept of aesthetic value. The Sense of Beauty as an Emotional In- terpretant EXPOSITION. There are, according to Peirce, three possible significate effects of a sign on an interpreter of that sign; a feel- ing, an action, or a thought. Another name for significate effect is interpretant. Hence, there are three classes of interpretants, Emotional Interpretants, Dynamical In- terpretants, and Logical Interpretants. It is obvious that an emotion is the only rele- vant response to an object of aesthetic worth. The aesthetic properties of a thing consist in the qualities of that thing and the subjective correlate of quality is feel- ing, which includes emotion. Consequently, the only proper significate effect of a work of art is an emotional interpretant (5.475). If the work of art is beautiful, the appro- priate emotional interpretant is a "sense of beauty"; if ugly, a "sense of ugliness." Appreciation of an aesthetic object be- gins in observation and ends in criticism.5 It hardly needs pointing out that any judgment of a work of art not based on ob- servation of the work is impertinent and ir- relevant. Aesthetics is based on phenome- nology in a more profound sense than is any other observational science (2.120), and every empirical science is pursued under the assumptions of pure phenomenology. That is to say, every empirical science in- volves the effort to be passive in the pres- ence of the object. If we are to make reli- able observations in chemistry, for example, we must find some way of discounting our biases. Otherwise, theoretical preconcep- tions will corrupt the observations. This general consideration has special applica- tion to aesthetics. I venture to think that the esthetic state of mind is purest when perfectly naive without any criti- cal pronouncement, and the esthetic critic founds his judgements upon the result of throwing him- self back into such a pure naive state of mind- and the best critic is the man who has trained himself to do this most perfectly. (5.111) The capacity for observational naivete is a desideratum in aesthetics. Thus, artists are often more acute observers than empiri- cal scientists, who justly pride themselves on their observational powers (1.315). The above point bears repetition: Peirce believed that aesthetics is (or could be) an observational science. This implies three propositions: (1) Observation is a crucial stage in the procedure of aesthetics; (2) Ob- jective evaluations of aesthetic objects are possible; and (3) The evaluations are ob- jective only if they are the result of reliable observations. Or put another way, the aes- thetic critic, like any other scientist, founds his judgments on controlled observations, and the worth of his judgments, like those of any other scientist, is largely a function of the competence with which his observa- tions were made. Observation of an aesthetic object in- volves attending both to the phenomena which appear and to our emotional re- sponses to those phenomena. For our emo- tional responses are the paramount indica- tors of, or evidence for aesthetic value in objects. The notion that emotions can be (reliable or unreliable) evidence for any- thing objective is likely to sound rather strange to contemporary ears. Emotivism, the currently fashionable theory of values, is the doctrine that emotions are purely self-reflexive and that values have, there- fore, no objective standing. Peirce repudi- ated this philosophy even before it had</page><page sequence="7">The Logical Foundations of Peirce's Aesthetics 163 been formulated by anybody else-and al- most in its own terms. In an early essay en- titled "Concerning Certain Faculties Claimed for Man" he argued that emotions are predicates of things, not of subjects. ... any emotion is a predicate concerning some object. What is here said of emotions in general is true in particular of the sense of beauty and of the moral sense. Good and bad are feelings which first arise as predicates of the not-I, or are deter- mined by previous cognitions (there being no power of distinguishing subjective elements of consciousness). (5.427) Of course some emotions were admitted by Peirce to be purely self-reflexive, namely those which are false. "Ignorance and error are all that distinguish our private selves from the absolute ego of pure appercep- tion" (5.235). A man who gets up "on the wrong side of the bed" only reveals his ugly temper. He tells us little about the world- which is seldom as black as it looks to him at the time. Such a man is literally in error to disapprove of everything he sees. What lends plausibility to the emotivist doctrine that emotions have no evidential value is the synthetic character of emotions. An emotion is a complex predicate substi- tuted for many simple predicates (5.291). For example, to say that lightning is fearful is, among other things, to say that it is sudden, bright, associated with a loud noise, etc. That is not all that is to be sig- nificantly said about it, else we could do away with the term "fearful," but fearful includes all of these simple empirical predi- cates when it is applied to lightning. What we are primarily referring to when we say lightning is fearful, however, is a complex predicate which results from a synthesis of these and which has a quality resembling that of other objects we call fearful. A wild boar is, like lightning, fearful but has dif- ferent simple properties.6 Emotions, then, are the meanings which signs evoke in the minds of interpreters who synthesize the simple empirical proper- ties of the signs they are observing. Emo- tions are evidence of objective properties in the same sense in which sensations are evi- dence. According to Peirce's pragmatic theory of meaning, to say that an object is red is to say that it is a sign capable of evoking, under the appropriate observa- tional conditions, the appearance of red in the mind of some observer. In a similar way, to say that an object is beautiful amounts to saying that it has the capacity, under the appropriate observational condi- tions (namely naivete or "receptiveness"), to evoke the sense of beauty. The appear- ance of red is a sign that an object is red; the sense of beauty is similarly a sign that an object is beautiful. If there is less agree- ment about whether objects are beautiful than there is about whether they are red, that is only because it requires a rather special training to make a competent aes- thetic observer, just as it requires a rather special training to make a competent ob- server of a test-tube reaction. Exactly what is the emotional interpre- tant which is the sense of beauty, and how does it differ from other emotions? This can perhaps best be answered by first stat- ing what Peirce argued it was not. First of all, the sense of beauty should not be confused with taste. Peirce, who ... originally took refuge in the idea that there was no science of esthetics, that, because de gus- tibus non est disputandum, therefore, there is no esthetic truth or falsity or generally valid good- ness and badness. (5.111) eventually concluded that this whole idea rested on a mistaken view of aesthetic ob- servation (ibid.). Taste will not do as a basis of aesthetic criticism because it does not fulfill the condition of observational naivete. Indeed, a man's taste very fre- quently represents a falsification of his spontaneous and direct emotional responses to objects. Many people, for example, have "good taste" in furnishings who do not like the sofas they have in their living rooms. There are controls on taste, but they are of the nature of culturally introduced biases, which are at best aesthetically re- strictive and at worst aesthetically irrele- vant. Taste may, thus, very often be as dis- astrous to the recognition of aesthetic value as was the doctrine of creation to the can- did observation of the facts of biology. Nor should the sense of beauty be con- fused with pleasure. There are emotions of unpleasantness which are entirely irrele- vant to the appreciation of an aesthetic ob- ject (5.132). For example, a storm at sea is</page><page sequence="8">164 MAX OLIVER HOCUTT frightening and fear is an unpleasant emo- tion. But given the proper detachment for aesthetic observation, a storm at sea can also provoke the emotional interpretant of sublimity. The sense of beauty is, doubtless, a pleasant emotion and the sense of ugli- ness is doubtless a painful emotion, but beauty and ugliness can be said to be equiv- alent with pleasure and pain only for a "fully developed superman" (5.552). Such a superman would be an aesthetic critic capable of utterly disinterested and de- tached appreciation of objects. If the sense of beauty is neither pleasure nor taste, what is it? Ultimately, of course, the only possible definition of the sense of beauty is an ostensive definition. Just as you must show a person an example of red in order for him to know what red is, so you must show him a beautiful object if he is to experience and be able subsequently to recognize what the sense of beauty is. For beauty, like red, is a quality. Saving this, the best that we can do in the way of de- scribing the sense of beauty is to say that it is a sympathetic feeling, that it is ... the totality of feeling-and especially the total resultant quality of Feeling presented in the work of art we are contemplating-yet it is a sort of intellectual sympathy, a sense that there is a feel- ing one can comprehend, a reasonable feeling.... (5.114) When we remind ourselves of the defini- tion of beauty as kalos, this description takes on more meaning. The sense of beauty is a feeling whose object is the qual- ity kalos. It is a totality which results from the ordering of parts in an essentially ra- tional manner. We who are rational crea- tures therefore find the sense of beauty to be a "sympathetic" feeling.7 COMMENTARY. Peirce's major question about aesthetics was "Can it be a science?" He seemed to doubt that it could until near the end of his career when he began to change his mind. If he had any basis for his final affirmative belief, it is the doctrine that the sense of beauty is an emotional in- terpretant. Unfortunately, this idea re- quires a great deal more discussion than Peirce ever gave it. Peirce's assumption clearly is that beauty is a real feature of the world, that it is what it is whatever anyone may think about it. He is also committed to the notion that there can be aesthetic truth corresponding to this reality. Both of these propositions are implicit in the doctrine that emotions are predicates. Now the problem of aesthetic truth is an extremely complex one which Peirce never discussed as such-except to state the above doctrine. Presumably aesthetic truth is like any other kind of truth: a proposition that an object is beautiful is true if and only if the object is in fact beautiful. Peirce once pointed out, however, that the correspond- ence definition of truth is a "nominal" defi- nition having only a "first grade of clear- ness." There is a higher "grade of clearness" of the notion of truth. It is that truth is the limit of indefinitely prolonged inquiry (that is, the result of an infinite series of interpretants). Truth is, according to this definition, a function of the evidence. Real- ity is the object of the proposition (or prop- ositions) ultimately found to be true. In his general theory of truth, then, every- thing is made to hinge on the method of inquiry. Presumably, the same would be true in aesthetics. Aesthetic truth would be that judgment arrived at after continual replication of emotional interpretation of an object. Beauty would be the property found to be possessed by all objects which, in the final analysis, arouse the emotional interpretant of beauty. What this indicates regarding the method and procedures of aesthetics is something like the following. We take, as preliminary data, objects agreed by those competent to judge to be beautiful. This group of ob- jects will presumably include such things as symphonies by Beethoven, paintings by Botticelli and statues by Rodin, for there is pretty close agreement among critics that these are outstanding art objects. Those "competent to judge" are those who have observed these works of art and met, as best as we can tell, the conditions of relia- ble observation and interpretation of aes- thetic objects. (The chief such condition is naivete.) To others we can only say "You need a course in art appreciation" or "You need training in recognizing your feelings for what they are." We may analyze the</page><page sequence="9">The Logical Foundations of Peirce's Aesthetics 165 collection of these objects with an eye to discovering precisely what it is they have in common. The conception of beauty cur- rent at any time should represent a work- ing hypothesis which has resulted from the use of this method. Such, for example, was the Greek idea of Beauty, which seems pretty adequate to Greek art. The ultimate conception will be the true conception, its object the beautiful. It is clear that such a method as this would never at any time provide any abso- lutely certain criteria of beauty. Peirce would probably insist, however (if we have been correct thus far), that its continual replication will.8 On such a view, aesthetics has all the features he regarded as essential to a genuine science, canons of empirical evidence and a self-correcting method. But the really crucial doctrine in this theory of aesthetics is that for every emo- tion there is a potentially corresponding ob- ject. Upon this hinges the notion of aes- thetic truth and the objectivity of aesthetic value. And it is a doctrine full of difficul- ties. For example, it is hard to know exactly what the emotion of anger predicates of an object. CONCLUSION It has been the aim of this paper to out- line the aesthetics implicit in Peirce's phi- losophy and very nearly made explicit in certain of his remarks. Of necessity, the method has been one of construction. Like the paleontologist, we have proceeded from one small bone found here and another discovered there to put together the skele- ton of some animal never seen by human eyes. Unlike the paleontologist who recon- structs what was, however, we have been talking about what would have been had Peirce ever got around to developing the aesthetics he fully intended to. We have approached this implicit aes- thetics from the point of view of its logical foundations, that is, as a branch of the theory of signs.9 From that point of view three propositions emerge which describe a comprehensive theory. These three propo- sitions derive from the three elements in a representative situation, the ground of rep- resentation, the object represented, and the interpretant of the representament. The aesthetically valuable object is a sign which "means" what it does in virtue of possessing the characteristics of its object. It is, in short, an icon. What the aesthetic icon rep- resents is, speaking generally, an instance of kalos, that is, a certain complex of qualities which appears as a simple quality because of the internal relatedness of the members of the complex. The effect on an interpreter of an aesthetic sign is a feeling, or rather, a complex feeling having correspondence to the complex quality which is the object of the aesthetically valuable sign. Broadly speaking, Peirce's aesthetics is classical in that it involves an objectivist theory of values, and modern in that cen- tral to his interest was the question of whether a science of aesthetic value is pos- sible. He believed that aesthetics could be a science, or equivalently, that it is a logical enterprise. The most important aspect of its method, as he saw it, would be obser- vation of aesthetic phenomena. This pre- supposes that aesthetic values are imma- nent within the phenomenal field, there to be discovered, not put into the phenomena by the observing subject. A certain type of emotional response to phenomena, pro- vided it has arisen under the proper con- ditions, constitutes evidence of aesthetic value. The "proper" conditions are de- tachment and naivete in the contemplation of qualitied objects. We pointed out in our commentary that in the effort to evaluate Peirce's aesthetics, the critical issue is that of aesthetic truth. If it makes no sense to allege a correspond- ence between aesthetic judgments and properties of objects in the external world then Peirce's hopes for a science of aes- thetics collapse. The central concern of this paper has been, however, to expose and explain Peirce's aesthetics and not to decide whether it is true. Adequate evaluation of it must be left to others or another time. The most that can be claimed for it as a result of this investigation is that it is plaus- ible, provocative, and well worth further investigation.</page><page sequence="10">166 MAX OLIVER HOCUTT 1The usual method of referring to passages in Peirce's Collected Papers by volume and paragraph number will be used here. The above reference is to Vol. II, paragraph 197 of the Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, Charles Hartshorne and Paul Weiss, editors, Volumes I through VI (Cambridge, 1931-1936). Volumes VII, VIII, Arthur W. Burks, editor (Cambridge, 1958). 2 C. W. Morris, "Esthetics and the Theory of Signs," Journal of Unified Science (Erkenntniss), VIII (1939), 131 ff. In the main, of course, our account of Peirce's notion of art as icon is similar to Morris'. There are, however, important differences which the reader may discover for himself by comparing the two accounts. 8See James K. Feibleman, An Introduction to Peirce's Philosophy (New York and London, 1946), Ch. 10. 4 Charles W. Morris, Foundations of the Theory of Signs (U. of Chicago, 1957), p. 3. 6 Aesthetics is only concerned to observe qualities; reactions and relations, as such, are not part of the aesthetic dimension. 6Peirce might, thus, argue that the difficulty of the emotivists consists in the reduction of the synthe- sis (which is the emotion) to a mere collection of the sense data which are the elements of the emotion. 7 "Sympathy" as Peirce uses the term seems to be akin to "pleasure" but somewhat broader. 8 He is thus optimistic about truth in general (7.334). 9An obvious objection to our approach has not been considered in this paper. Peirce argued on some occasions that instead of aesthetics being based on logic, logic is based on aesthetics (e.g., 1.611). But what may seem to be a fatal objection turns out to be only the result of a harmless ambiguity upon ex- amination. Peirce was speaking within the context of his value theory. A sign, he pointed out, may possess three kinds of goodness, expressiveness, veracity, and truth (5.173). The three kinds of goodness are re- spectively, aesthetic, ethical, and logical (in a narrow sense). Of these, expressiveness or aesthetic goodness is primitive, or as Peirce would say, it is First. But there is an ambiguity in Peirce's use of the term logic. Peirce was himself aware of it (1.444). When he said that logic is based on aesthetics, he meant a narrow sense of logic equivalent with what he called Critical Logic (the study of the forms of reasoning normative for investigation). This proposition does not hold true of logic in the more inclusive sense of General Semiotic. In one sense of logic, then, logic is based on aesthetics; in another sense, it is not.</page></plain_text>
