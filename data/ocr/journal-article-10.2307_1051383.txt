<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVELATION AND REASON: A DYNAMIC TENSION IN ISLAMIC ARBITRAMENT Barbara J. Metzger* After delivering a Carlson Lecture at the University of Minne- sota in 1994, Hannan Ashrawi was asked by an audience member if a newly formed, independent State of Palestine would adopt the Shart'a (Islamic law) as the law of the land. The question reveals a deep seated fear in the American mind about Islamic justice. Be- cause Islamic concepts of law and justice have developed from a very different worldview, they seem incomprehensible to us. We don't understand why Muslims argue about theology when talking about legal cases that appear in the news. The Islamic community is organized as a theocracy, where God is the ruler of the community. In such a community, there is very little doubt that God is the ultimate authority in all things, including questions of law. There might, however, be considerable doubt about how the human members of the community respond to, make use of, and/or interpret God's intentions. Islam is no ex- ception to this rule. Throughout its history, groups of people have answered questions about God and the community in different ways. In a 1987 article, "Islam and Ideology: Towards a Typology," William Shepard describes Islam as a "typology of ideological ori- entations."1 He identifies four main ideological types in Islam: secularism, Islamic modernism, radical Islamism, traditionalism, and neo-traditionalism, the modern manifestations of ideological conflicts within the Islamic community since the beginning. Each of the ideological types identified by Shepard takes a different ap- proach to major questions which confront the organization of the Islamic community. One major question faced by the Islamic community is who has the power of arbitrament, that is, who decides human issues in a theocracy? Does all judgment belong to God as revealed through the Prophet? Or do human beings also have arbitrament, through applied reason?

Americans can gain understand- ing of the answers to this question by reviewing the work of twenti- eth century historians of Islam on the development of Islamic law. THE FORMATIVE PERIOD: THE EARLY KHALIFAS AND THE UMAYYAD DYNASTY According to M. Jamil Hanifi in law, classical Islamic theory is the revealed will of God. "[It is] a divinely ordained system pre- ceding and preceded by the Muslim state, controlling and con- trolled by Muslim society."2 Most scholars apparently agree with Duncan B. Macdonald's description of the practice of decision- making used by Mohammed. In Development of Muslim Theology, Jurisprudence and Constitutional Theory, Macdonald describes the four elements in Muslim jurisprudence during the life of Moham- med as: that which was revealed to Mohammed by God; Arab cus- tom; Jewish law; and the personality of Mohammed himself.3 By including Arab custom and Jewish law, we can understand what Hanifi means in saying that law is a divinely ordained system pre- ceding the Muslim state and preceded by the Muslim state. In its earliest form - during the life of the Prophet - it was a synthesis of elements, some old and some new. The Muslim community developed in a part of the world which had long been organized under a system that regulated human conduct. The laws of Madinah were already a synthesis of Jewish and Arabic concepts. The laws of Mecca, a city of com- merce, were especially sophisticated in concepts of trade and fair- ness. The decisions made by the Prophet Mohammed leave little doubt that he knew the legal structures of Madinah and Mecca. However, as Hanifi describes it, The supreme innovation introduced by Islam into the social structure of Arabia was the establishment of a novel political authority possessing legislative power - the Qur'anic command "obey God and His Prophet."4 During the life of the Prophet Mohammed the question who has arbitrament was easily answered: God and His Prophet.

The question who has the power of arbitrament became much more compelling after the death of the Prophet Mohammed. If one defines law as that which was revealed through the Prophet Mohammed, then in principle there would be no more leg- islation and law would be fixed. However, the difficulty comes in the legal practice of the community. Several historians describe Mohammed as sitting at the edge of his yard attending to a long line of community members seeking arbitration. If they were used to having decisions made by Mohammed, then who would they look to for decision-making upon Mohammed's death? If it did take two years after the death of Mohammed for the Qur'an to be gathered together from its fragmentary state as Macdonald sug- gests, then how were decisions actually made in the early Islamic community? On the death of Mohammed, the umma (community) elected Abu Bakr as Khalifa (Caliph) successor of the Prophet of God. H.A.R. Gibb, in Law in the Middle East, describes that act as the umina's first and most decisive exercise of ijmd', (consensus of the community). This step . . . brought the historical process into constitutional theory: The action ... had to be reconciled with and justified by the principles of the shari'a [Islamic law] .... It focused the constitutional theory of the jurists upon the person of the Khalifa-imam (Caliph).s The doctrine of the umma can be termed the root of all Is- lamic political concepts. The umma consists of all those individuals who are connected to one another by religious ties, and all individ- uals in the umma are equal in their relationship to God. God is the head of the umma, and the source of legislation. The state exists to enforce the law, which is seen as the expression of God's will. The state is subordinate to the Qur'an, and there is little basis for criti- cism and dissent. Thus law, as the revealed will of God, is not tied in with the evolution of society and culture.

The stan- dards of the religious law and the demands of political expediency often have not coincided . . .6 It is the role of the imam (leader) to translate law from the sphere of theory into practical application. The Khalifa is estab- lished as the vice regent of God, and is given the duty of judging, or applying the Sharf'a righteously between men.7 The authority of the imam then is derived from God. The election of Abu Bakr as Khalifa was carried out through the consensus of the umma. By that action the community participated, to a limited degree, in ar- bitrament. Because the Khalifa was chosen not by God as Moham- med was, but by the community, a human element is included as a source of decision-making in Islamic legal practice both through, and because of, the exercise of human reason. The Khalifa as judge did not rest his decisions on common sense alone. His source also included the Qur'an, the common law of Madinah (with its synthesis of Jewish and pre-Muslim Arab law), and the decisions of the Prophet as recalled by his compan- ions. During the lifetime of Mohammed, companions kept records of the Prophet's decisions in judgment. These records, and written transcriptions of the Prophet's words in stories, table-talk, and ser- mons were used in legal decision-making and were the basis of the hadfth (traditions). The hadFth themselves were originally passed on orally, per- haps because of the difficulty of reproducing a thought exactly in a written language without diacritical points. Because hadfth were transmitted orally, they came to consist of two elements: the text of what was written by a companion, and the succession of who told it to whom to document of its originality. The early Khalifas essentially continued the practice of Mo- hammed to act as a hakam (arbitrator) for the community. The role of hakam derived from Arab (both Bedouin and sedentary) custom. In situations of conflict where negotiation failed to pro- vide resolution, a hakam was chosen from the tribe for his or her qualities of knowledge and integrity. Before Islam, a hakam might also have been chosen for his or her supernatural powers (a sooth- 6. Hanifi, Islam at 42-43 (cited in note 2). 7. Q II, 28-30 and Q XXXVIII, 25-26.

The Prophet based his legislating on an intention - not to create a legal system - but to teach men how to act. Joseph Schacht suggests: . . . had religious and ethical standards been comprehensively applied to all aspects of human behavior, and had they been consistently followed in practice, there would have been no room and no need for a legal system ... 8 At the time the Umayyad Caliphate was founded there simply was no systematic Islamic legal institution. Duncan Macdonald de- scribes the Umayyads as "simple heathens in all but name, and [they] belonged and recognized that they belonged, not to Islam but to the Jdhiliya."9 Much of their remaining architecture (exclu- sive of the Qubbat al-Sakhra and the mosques at Kufa, Jerusalem and Damascus) demonstrates their intentional self-comparison with rulers of non-Islamic territories. This proclivity is especially noticeable in the palace at 'Anjar and in the bath at Khirbat al- Mafjar. While the Umayyads apparently did not act as supreme reli- gious arbitrators, they did legislate law during the first century of Islam. They also commonly adopted legal and administrative insti- tutions of conquered territories, including Roman provincial, Sas- sanian, Talmudic and canon law of eastern Churches. The Umayyad governors appointed Islamic judges (Qadds) supplanting the Arab hakam with the Islamic qadd. These early qddFs followed the earlier hakam custom of judging according to their own discre- tion, and thus instituted ra'y (sound opinion) as a basis of judg- ment. Macdonald described ra'y as "an opinion that was thoughtful, weighed and reasonable as opposed to a hasty dictate of ill-regulated passion. "10 In Conflicts and Tensions in Islamic Jurisprudence, Noel Coul- son describes the first 150 years of Islam in jurisprudence, roughly coinciding with the period of the first four Khalifas and the rule of the Umayyads, as, characterized by an almost untrammeled freedom of juristic rea- soning in the solution of problems not specifically regulated by 8.

Such rules of law as the Qur'an and the Sunna established were regarded simply as ad hoc modifications of the existing customary law. This existing law remained the accepted standard of conduct unless it was expressly superseded in some particular by the dictates of divine revelation.11 Such freedom of juristic reasoning may have arisen because the prophet left no comprehensive code of law, because the Umayyads established the government so soon after the Prophet's death and were themselves motivated by elements other than reli- gious purity, and because the Umayyad period was one of fairly rapid expansion. Camp cities, such as al-Basra and al-Kufa, were built to hold conquered lands and were some distance from the religious center of Madinah. Jurists in this early period in Kufa, Basra and Syria as well as Madinah and Mecca based their deci- sions on what came to be known as the living tradition of the school. In other words, sources for decisions in those locations be- came the Qur'an; known practices of the Prophet; Arab custom and the practice of law in pre-Muslim Mecca and Madinah; and the continuous chain of decisions made by local jurists. Schacht describes the chain of decisions made by these ancient schools of law as having both a retrospective and contemporaneous aspect: Retrospectively, it appears as sunna or practice or as well estab- lished precedent... it comes to mean normative sunna .... The consensus of the scholars, representing the common denomina- tor of doctrine achieved in each generation, expresses the con- temporaneous aspect of the living tradition of each school.12 The situation under the Umayyads was tolerated for a long period of time, even though there were many Muslims who be- lieved that all law must be derived from the revealed will of God. There was also a general belief that Muslims should support an existing Islamic government. In conflict with that general support, many believed was a feeling that if the government strays from the fundamentals, then it should be put right. According to W. Mont- gomery Watt: Modern scholars accept the idea of development whereas the medieval Muslim scholars found this idea abhorrent.

The dislike of change and nov- elty is deeply rooted in the Arab soul, and goes back to pre- Islamic times when the accepted ideal was to follow exactly the time-honored practice of the tribe or clan. In accordance with this attitude medieval scholars avoided all suggestion of devel- opment in Islamic doctrine, and presented instead the image of a monolithic body of doctrine, which was accepted through the centuries by the great mass of Muslims, and from which a few sectarians at various times had deviated.13 Whether Watt is correct in his analysis of an Arab preference for unity of doctrine, or of the motivations for such preference, historically the umma was in fact split by dissension and factional- ism. Such factionalism was not restricted to Sunni vs Shi'a and the debate over descent of authority. Watt identifies three categories of groups which might be described as dissenting from the Islamic mainstream. The first category was groups of rebels against the government who based their rebellion on theological principles. This category included Kharijite groups such as the Azraqites; fol- lowers of Nafi ibn Azraq; and various Shl'ite groups. The second category included groups and individuals whom the Umayyad rul- ers suspected of subversive activity, but who were punished before they could engage in open rebellion. The third category included large numbers of men who discussed religious questions with one another: as noted later, their discussions ultimately identified by "schools" consisting of individuals who held one or more views in common. Islamic scholars are familiar with the term "the 73 sects of Is- lam." This term is derived from a traditional story (fiqh) in which Mohammed reminds the community that the People of the Book before them had divided into seventy-two sects. In reality, Mo- hammed says there were seventy-three, of which seventy-two would go to hell, and only one which would go to Paradise. Whatever the actual number of sects, it is clear that there were many groups of Muslims who held a multiplicity of conflicting be- liefs, some of which included the issue of revelation vs reason in legal arbitrament. 13.

Hourani divides the history of Islam into three peri- ods: the formative, the classical, and the modem.14 We have so far looked at the place of reason in the formative period. Hourani identifies the transition from the formative period to the classical period at the end of the second century A. H.. He describes the transition as follows: The Traditions were informally canonized in the great collec- tions of Bukhari, Kulini and others; the schools of shari'a law were well established; the twelfth and last Shi'ite imam disap- peared; the Sunni caliphate was reduced to governing little more than Iraq; the Greek sciences and philosophy had been intro- duced into learned circles; the visual arts and literature were set- tling into steady patterns, not without constant change; the economic order was a kind of feudalism, and government almost everywhere was in the hands of secular sultans and amirs.15 In mentioning Bukhari and other collectors of hadiths, Hourani makes a clear distinction between "traditionists" and "tra- ditionalists." He calls the collectors of hadiths traditionists; and those scholars who derive the Islamic sciences of law and theology entirely from the sources of the Qur'an and hadith he calls tradi- tionalists. Other scholars are not so careful to make this distinc- tion, and many reference the movement of those scholars who deny rationalism and the use of human reason in law as the "tradi- tionist movement." Hourani's clearer language assists our purpose in this essay. The movement of the traditionalists arose around the middle of the second century A.H. in religious and ethical opposition to the ancient schools of law, their freedom of juristic reasoning (use of ra'y), and the reliance on the living tradition of the schools of law in decision-making. The traditionalists believed that the for- mal hadfth superseded the living tradition (or the local continuity of decisions), and they wanted all decisions to be based on the Qur'an or the hadfth, because they considered them to be more reliable than the opinions of men. The [traditionalists] refused to go one inch beyond the state- ments in the Qur'an and hadith and to draw conclusions from 14. George F.

This refusal to ask why and how is called balkafa.'6 Some scholars (Macdonald, Coulson and others) accuse the traditionalists of using human reason themselves, both in arguing against its use, and in forging hadith which would provide the same basis for a decision as would the use of reason in a given situation. According to Schacht, The [traditionalists] didn't accept traditions of the compan- ions but only of the Prophet himself (they claimed eyewitness authority even though they produced [the Tradition] in the sec- ond century A.H.). They report the Prophet as saying, 'Sayings attributed to me which agree with the Qur'an go back to me, whether I actually said them or not.'17 THE LITERARY PERIOD OF LAW: TRANSITION INTO CLASSICAL ISLAM The literary period in Islamic law similarly begins in the mid- dle of the second century A.H. Macdonald suggests that books dealing with law in general appeared before any collections of hadith, and that such books were encouraged by the state for the good of the public. The first collection of hadith was the Muwatta of Malik ibn Anas (d. A.H. 179). The Muwatta of Malik ibn Anas was intended to create a system of law based on the hadith. It is impossible to know exactly how many hadFth existed, which were considered sound, and which were viewed with skepti- cism. For example, Macdonald describes the Musnad of Ahmad ibn Hanbal (a collection of hadfth) as containing about thirty thou- sand. Noel Coulson claims the same collection contained more than eighty thousand hadith. It is generally accepted that existent hadFth did number in the high thousands, but many of these were disputed as unverifiable. Perhaps the most respected of all the collections of hadfth is the Sahih (sound) al-Bukhari (d. A.H. 257). His sah?h is a musan- naf (the arranged, classified). It is arranged in chapters according to their subject matter and is intended to provide the basis for an organized system of jurisprudence. 16.

He was very critical of the mass of hadFth and strenuously tested them for authenticity. He rejected all but ap- proximately seven thousand as forgeries. Bukahari was not alone in rejecting many hadFth, the SahTh of Muslim (d. A.H. 261) was very similar to that of Bukhari, though not as juristic. His motiva- tion was also to purify the existing hadfth of forgery. There were numerous collections of hadfth produced at this time of transition to the classical period. Macdonald suggests that only six were widely accepted as canonical: the Musannaf of Bukhari and of Muslim; and the four Sunan (which deal almost entirely with legal tradition) Ibn Maja (d. A. H. 303), Abu Da'ud as-Sijistani (d. A. H. 275), al-Tirmidhi (d. A. H. 279) and al-Nasa'? (d. A. H. 303). THE CLASSICAL PERIOD: DEVELOPMENT OF THE SCHOOLS OF LAW In addition to written collections of hadfth, the early classical period also saw the solidification of the major schools of law, each with a different approach to the issue of revelation vs reason in legal decision making, and varying degrees of hypothetical specula- tion in each school's development and teaching techniques. Many problems discussed in the traditional textbooks of Islamic law, did not arise as an actual case but as a hypothetical one ... Islamic law in its developed form is a jurists' rather than a judges' law. It was expressed in textbooks as the doctrine of the jurists, not in law reports containing the decisions of the judici- ary .... Consequently the problems which exercised the minds of the jurists were problems of pure law.18 These schools were formed by groups of jurists who shared common ideas and they derived their names from a founder- scholar. The two oldest schools are the Hanafis and the Malikis, both developed out of particular geographical locations. The Hanafis developed out of followers of Abu Hanifa at Kufa, and the Malikis out of followers of Malik ibn Anas at Madinah. According to Schacht: The accepted doctrine of the Madanese school, which Malik aimed to set forth, was itself to a great extent founded on the 18. Coulson, Islamic Jurisprudence at 9 (cited in note 11). 706 [Vol. 11</page><page sequence="11">ISLAMIC ARBITRAMENT individual reasoning of the school's representatives. In combin- ing extensive use of reasoning with dependence on the living tradition, Malik seems typical of the Madanese.19 For Schacht, Malik was a working judge who used living tradi- tion copiously and ra'y less often. Schacht believes the school de- veloped out of a recognition of the actual legal practice of Madinah society. Thus it developed the concept of agreement (ijma' and considered the consensus of Mecca and Madinah to be decisive. On the other hand, Schacht describes Abu Hanifa as an aca- demic whose school of law was not based on experience of actual cases. Schacht says Hanifa "seems to have played the part of a theoretical systematizer who achieved considerable progress in technical legal thought."20 He describes Hanifa's system of law as using opinion and analogy of written statute as chief instruments of decision-making. According to Noel Coulson, Hanifa made little use of hadfth, but used the Qur'an extensively. His work was crafted into a finished code by two students: Qadi Abu Yusaf (d. A. H. 182) and Mohammed ibn al-Hasan (d. A.H. 189). Coulson credits the Hanafis with development of the concept of istihan (juristic preference) where the jurist may consider it bet- ter to follow a different course than that required by a fixed code. Though both Hanafis and the Malikis used and developed the con- cept of ijma' in applications of law which appeared to be based on principles of freedom and flexibility; it might not represent as much flexibility as modern scholars would like it to. Coulson argues: The function of ijma' is in fact limited to the ratification of the status quo at the time of its formation; from this stage onwards it becomes a purely prohibitive and exclusive principle. Once formed, the ijma' was infallible; to contradict it was heresy, and the possibility of its repeal by a similar ijma' of a later genera- tion, though admitted in theory, was thus highly unlikely in practice .... As the acknowledged sphere of the ijma' in this broad sense spread, the use of independent judgment or ijtihad, which had been progressively restricted during the formative pe- riod by the emergence of such principles as the authority of Tra- ditions and the strict regulation of methods of reasoning, eventually disappeared altogether. Ijma' had thus set the final seal upon the process of increasing rigidity in the law.21 19. Schacht in Khadduri and Liebesny, Law in the Middle East at 51 (cited in note 5). 20. Id at 52. 21. Noel J.

Three additional schools of law developed out of this conflict: those of al-Shafi' i (d. A.H. 204), Ahmad ibn Hanbal (d. A.H. 241), and Da'ud al-Zahiri (d. A.H. 270). Al-Shafi'i had great reverence for tradition and considered the Qur'an and hadfth of equal authority. Much of his work focused on reconciling contradictory hadfth. He rejected ra'y, believing that reason could not be applied independently of the divine will. Indeed, he held that the role of human reason must be subordinate to the Qur'an and hadfth. He did accept the concept of ijmd', and where consensus of the scholars was contradictory, he looked in- stead to the consensus of all Muslims. Al-Shafi'i believed that human reason was necessary in pro- viding legal rules for new cases, or situations not specifically regu- lated by the Qur'an and Traditions. Such cases were to be decided by analogy (qFyds), or by applying principles used in divine revela- tion to decide similar cases. Al-Shafi'i's legal theory had established a compromise between the dictates of the divine will and the use of human reason in law. But his hopes that such mediation would resolve existing conflicts and introduce uniformity into jurisprudence were frus- trated .... Those who were prepared to accept the precise terms of Shafi'i's doctrine on the role of Traditions were a mi- nority and thus, despite the consistent repudiation of this possi- bility by Shafi'i himself, the Shaf'i school of law was born. It represented the middle position between those whose attitude towards Traditions was more reserved and those whose enthusi- astic support of them was carried to extremes.22 The Hanbalite school and the Zahiri school were both based on rejection of human reason in any form as a source of legal deci- sion-making. Initially the Hanbali school adopted an intolerant and polemical position with regard to the Shafi'i, Hanafi, and Maliki schools, and rejected the method of juristic reasoning by analogy. Although the Hanbalites went further than any other school of law in attempting to integrate the twin strands of law and morality in the Shari'a, they adhered rigidly to the terms of the 22. Id at 70-71. 708 [Vol. 11</page><page sequence="13">ISLAMIC ARBITRAMENT hadfth and were regarded by the other schools as collectors of hadlth rather than real lawyers. The Hanbalites consistently maintained that any consensus was inadmissible after that of the generation of the Prophet's com- panions. In spite of their persecution of scholars from other schools of law, they were never as strong in numbers of adherents as the Hanafi, Maliki or Shafi'i schools; and they never succeeded in gaining territorial dominion until the Wahhabi movement in eighteenth century (C.E.) Arabia. These four schools have come to be known as the orthodox schools of Sunni law. Though there were periods of serious conflict and outright persecution, they eventually grew to exist fairly peace- fully with each other. Indeed, the architectural form of the madrasa (colleges designed for the teaching of the schools of Sunni law) was a cruciform, i.e., a square central court flanked by four halls (liwans). The four liwdns were used by each of the four schools of law. Such peaceful cohabitation is indicative of a basic principle of toleration of diversity in the umma. Not only do the four schools now exist together relatively peacefully, but all four are considered equally valid. Though movement from one school to another is not encouraged, it can be done with no repercussions. This situation has frequently been used to illustrate a basic unity within Sunni law. The Zahiri school of law, the only school which took its name from a legal theory, was founded by Da'ud ibn Kalaf (d. A. H. 270). He was himself trained as a Shafi'ite, but found the school not to be traditional enough for him. He reacted strongly to what he saw, not as compromise between conflicting positions, but as almost hidden increase in the use of reasoning. He expounded the belief that law should be based only upon the literal and evident (zahir) meaning of the texts of the Qur'an and the hadith. The Zahiri school rejected both the exercise of personal opin- ion (ra'y) and the use of analogical reasoning as contrary to reli- gion. This school considered the consensus of the companions of the Prophet as the only legally valid form of consensus. They re- jected any form of living tradition, or any decision based on those of earlier jurists. The Zahirite school never ranked as an orthodox school of Sunni law, though it existed for centuries as a minority voice. 697] 709</page><page sequence="14">JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; RELIGION A superficial glance at the major schools of law would leave the impression that the subject of revelation vs reason in Islamic law is neat and tidy. The Hanafis and the Malikis take the reason side; the Hanbalis and the Zahiris take the revelation side; and the Shafi' is take a middle position of compromise between the other two positions. But that would indeed be a superficial reading of what in reality was a very complex situation, and only considers the four to five major schools of law out of many existing and overlap- ping groups of thinkers. THE MU'TAZILITE AND ASH'ARITE SCHOOLS OF LAW IN MEDIEVAL ISLAM G.F. Hourani looks at two additional groups, and finds their two theories opposed to each other in a debate about the nature of values, one of the most important debates "in Islamic intellectual circles in the early Abbasid period."23 One [of these theories simplified a little] was that of the Mu'tazilah, that values such as justice and goodness have a real existence, independent of anyone's will, even God's .... The other theory was that of Ash-'ari and his like, that all values are determined by the will of God, who decides what shall be just and so forth .... Following a struggle between the two doc- trines, that of Ash-'ari finally prevailed in most learned circles of medieval Sunnite Islam, a result which had far-reaching conse- quences in law and other spheres of Islamic civilization.24 Hourani's description of Mu'tazilite and Ash'arite schools as opposed theories may be true in terms of particulars of belief, but it is not necessarily true in comparison of their methods of argu- ment. Both groups rely on extensive use of reason in their presentations. The Mu'tazilite school has been called the first systematic school of theology in Islam. It was founded by two men, Wasil ibn 'Ata (d. 748 C.E.) and Amr ibn 'Ubayd (d. 761 C.E.). Wasil ibn 'Ata was a student of Hasan al-Basri. He seceded from al-Basri circles and he and his followers were known as Mu'tazilites from that time on. The Mu tazilah were proponents of rationalism, that is, they took stated principles from the Qur'an and deduced their logical consequences. They held that the values of human and di- 23. G. F.

According to von Grunebaum: Where to the Mu'tazilite the identity of reason is the principle tying together the realm of God and the world of man; to the orthodox, divine and human reason are not necessarily of the same order and what safeguards the interaction of God and man is the Command with human reason confined to explication and application.25 Put in other words by Hourani: The Mu' tazlite theory of ethical knowledge claimed (a) that any rational person can know some judgments of good and evil as true necessarily ('ala d-darura) or "immediately", by intellec- tual intuition: e.g., "irreligion (kufr) is evil"; and (b) that other true judgments can be inferred from these primary ones through rational study (bi n-nazar al-'aql).26 This debate was important for Islamic jurists in determining which sources for legal decision making were legitimate. If specific actions are right or wrong for man in themselves, and knowable to man through natural reason, then sources for legal decision making such as Arab custom, Byzantine and Sassanid law, and precedents of earlier jurists are legitimate in that they illustrate the known value of a given act. If specific actions are right or wrong for man only because they are commands or prohibitions of God, then the only legitimate sources for legal decision making are the Qur'an and hadfth, the only sources of the revelation of God's will. R. M. Frank puts it quite succinctly: In order to maintain the integrity of man's autonomy as a moral agent, the Mu'tazila assume that he is endowed with a native capacity to discover and know what is good and what is evil in the realm of human activity.27 The Mu'tazilite school was also known for its emphasis on the unity of God (the only point in its philosophy which was shared by orthodox Sunni Islam). It soundly rejected polytheism and the Christian Trinity. A major point of conflict with orthodox Sunni Islam was its position on the createdness of the Qur'an. 25. G.

Consequently, [for the orthodox] his revelation did not originate in time, owing to a specific act of creation, but has been in existence from all eternity.28 The history of the Mu'tazila is by no means one of peaceful cohabitation with the orthodox. There were periods of persecution and counter-persecution, depending primarily on who was in the favor of the rulers at any given time. It did manage to survive for centuries in intellectual circles and most scholars agree that its final downfall was a result of conflict on the createdness of the Qur'an. Sources of Mu'tazilite philosophy, which seems so far removed from the orthodox, have been carefully analyzed, and most schol- ars agree that sources include both Christian and Greek philosoph- ical thinkers. Grunebaum credits the Mu'tazilah with forcing a measure of the Greek approach into orthodox thought. Al-Ash'ari was born in Basra and studied under Jubba I (d. 915 C.E.), the foremost Mu' tazilite theologian of the Basra school. The doctrine of Ash'ari has been called thoroughly traditionalist by many. Schacht says: Ash'ari first of all followed the doctrine of the Mu tazila, then he became converted to traditionalism, but continued to use the speculative method of the Mu'tazila to defend traditionalist doctrine; in this way he arrived at an intermediate position, and this position was maintained by his school.29 In spite of the similarities in Mu'tazila and Ash'ari as de- scribed by Schacht, there were many differences between the schools. George Makdisi raises some serious questions about Ash'ari's work and his position as a rationalist. He questions Ash'arite propagandists' presentation of Ash'ari as a traditionalist who uses kalam (dialectics), basing his argument on the questiona- ble authenticity of Istihsan al-khaud as a work by Ash'ari: For between reason and kalam there was a difference. It was all the difference between Muslim traditionalism and Muslim ra- tionalism. The traditionalists made use of reason in order to un- derstand what they considered as the legitimate sources of theology: scripture and tradition. What they could not under- 28. G.

On the other hand, the rationalists advocated the use of reason on scripture and tradition; and all that they deemed to contradict the dictates of reason they interpreted metaphorically in order to bring it into harmony with reason.30 In spite of this controversy, it is accepted by most scholars that Ash'ari was a traditionalist who used reason in defense of ortho- doxy. The ways in which the Ash'arite school was clearly different from the Mu'tazila include: the Ash'arites' belief that the Qur'an is uncreated; their adoption of the Hanbalite manner of dealing with the anthropomorphic qualities of God (they exist, but man cannot know in what sense); a more literal interpretation of the Qur'an; their doctrine of predestination; and their belief that God "creates" the acts of people, rather than the Mu'tazilite idea that people create their own acts. The Ash'arites faced many struggles in finding acceptance within Sunni Islam, both in their early formative period and again in the eleventh century (C.E.). The great struggle which began in the 11th century was not be- tween Ash'arites and Mu' tazilites, nor even between Ash'arites and Hanbalites; it was a struggle of rationalist Ash'arism against the overwhelming traditionalist forces of all Sunnite schools of law.31 What emerges from this brief look at the historical dynamics in the issue of revelation vs reason in Islamic legal arbitrament is a clear motivation for modern western study of historic Islamic ideol- ogy. Many of the struggles currently going on in Islamic countries reflect historic tensions in the Islamic Community. Malaysia and Pakistan are but the most obvious examples of ongoing conflict be- tween the modernist reformed approach and the classical tradition in Islamic law. As M. Jamil Hanifi says: According to the classical tradition, law is imposed from above and postulates the eternally valid standards to which the struc- ture of state and society must conform. In the modernist or re- formed approach, law is shaped by society; its function is to answer constantly arising social problems ....

If the law is to retain its form as the expression of the divine command, if indeed it is to remain Is- lamic law, reforms cannot be justified on the ground of cultural necessity per se; they must find their juristic basis and support in principles which are Islamic in the sense that they are endorsed, expressed or implied, by the divine will .... Here it is, then, that the connection between modern legal activities and the re- sults of the researches of Western orientalists becomes readily apparent... Modernism is a movement towards an historical in- terpretation of the divine revelation.32 Human reason has been a part of Islamic decision making in law since the beginning. It was used by Mohammed, and was used in the development of those sources which he accepted and applied in practice. Human reason was also used in legal decision-making by the early Islamic community as it struggled to maintain itself upon the death of the Prophet. It has been a vital thread through- out Islamic history in the application of law, but not without con- siderable debate and conflict. The debate continues today as the Islamic community now struggles with issues of modernism. The question, "who has arbitrament," is not as easily answered now, as it was during the life of the Prophet Mohammed. While it may be possible for all Muslims today to answer, "God has arbitra- ment," it by no means is unanimous that man does also. The dy- namic tension which has existed throughout Islamic history between various answers to this question continues today, and will very likely continue into the future. 32.
