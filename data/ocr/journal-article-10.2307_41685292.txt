An Early Bronze Age Settlement on Samos By HANS PETER ISLER The earliest Heraion important on Samos, centers Greece, of is the one worship of the earliest important centers of the worship of the goddess Hera. Her cult began there in the tenth century b.c. and lasted until the end of antiquity. But the archaeological history of the site began much earlier, as did possibly the history of the sanctuary itself. The existence of a pre- historic settlement beneath the Heraion was es- tablished during the period between the two world wars, and in the course of the 1950's part of that settlement was excavated. This work re- vealed Early and Middle Bronze Age levels and also signs of Mycenaean occupation. Then in 1966 the director of the Heraion excavations, Professor Ernst Homänn-Wedeking, gave me the opportu- nity to excavate an area of about 400 square me- ters, outside the Greek sanctuary. It soon became apparent that inside this area there were no con- structions that could be dated later than the third millennium b.c. Although a test sounding proved the existence of several Early Bronze Age layers, we confined our excavations to the latest stratum only. Because it had not been disturbed by later con- struction, this latest Early Bronze Age settlement was in rather good condition. We unearthed parts of at least three separate dwellings, the most inter- esting in the southeast corner of the excavation area. It contained four rooms, so far as we can tell, and while we have not been able to reconstruct the 170</page><page sequence="2">Workmen excavating pottery and other finds by the side of a fireplace.

It is not, first of all, of the megaron type - that is, it does not consist of a single main room whose extending side walls form an open front porch. Rather, it comprises several similar, rectangular rooms joined together. Like the rest of the settlement of which it is part, it was de- stroyed by fire, and the inhabitants, who seem to have fled with their most important possessions, left no evidence of ever having returned to re- build their settlement. The absence of weapons (with the exception of a single ax) and precious metals, as well as any human remains, suggests that they were not attacked; beyond this, how- ever, we can only surmise. Nor are we able to say why the inhabitants never returned; perhaps for religious reasons the area became sacred after the occurrence of the disaster, as was the case 171</page><page sequence="3">Four-handled pot with cover.

They had no foundations in the conven- tional sense, but rested instead on footings placed on leveled ground and made of small stones built up to a height of about 30 centimeters. Flat stone slabs placed upright against these footings were sometimes used to secure them against leakage; the tops of the footings were leveled with flat pebbles. The walls were made of crude mud- bricks, erected within a framework of wooden beams. The floors were clay. The beamed roofs were thatched with reeds, or possibly covered with mud or clay; no trace survives, however, of any roofing material. Had tiles been used, we would doubtless have found remains of at least some. Vestiges of the all-consuming fire were plentiful: most of the bricks had been reduced to a reddish mass, and only a few retained their original shape. The extensive brick rubble helped to protect many of the artifacts. A 11 told, we recovered about 140 vessels and 200 objects of various kinds. Only a few of the vessels were intact; most were badly fragmented and, owing to the persistent saturation of the soil, so seriously weakened that they had to be cleaned with extraordinary care. A hard incrusta- tion covered many of the sherds, and we dis- covered that an ordinary rinsing would dissolve or deform them. It became a matter of course to remove the fragments with most of the sur- rounding soil, dry them slowly, and then clean them carefully with the aid of scalpels; lastly they were chemically treated to protect them from humidity and to restore them to their original firmness. This painstaking work was finished in 1971. Among the vessels we can count about 50 dif- ferent shapes, not taking into consideration minor variants. Given the size and nature of the settle- ment, this is quite a high number even though the occurrence of many different shapes at the same time is characteristic for the Early Bronze Age 172</page><page sequence="4">Three vases with incised decoration : at the left an aryb alios, in the center and to the right , two "duck vases."

Only a fraction was imported; both the clay and the shape indicate that most of the pots were indigenous. These Samian products have a clearly defined structure with a rather soft outline: spherical and ovoid bodies are prevalent. The articulation between the parts of each vase, the body, neck, handle and feet, are neatly fashioned. Relative to the other parts, the body of the vase is generally large. The pottery of higher quality was covered with a lustrous red burnished slip that harmonized nicely with the shape of the vessel. The slip sur- vives on only a few pots which managed to es- cape the usual corrosion. These Bronze Age people did not adorn their vessels with painted decoration, and they were selective in their use of incision. The bizarre shapes and anthropomorphic details so common in Troy are completely absent here. As at Troy and other sites, however, at Samos the potter's wheel was used only in the production of inferior objects, even though, by this time, the wheel had been known for centuries in this part of the ancient world. The potter's wheel made possible the mass production of goods, but also, it seems, brought with it a deterioration of craft both artis- tically and technically. The Samians seem to have clung to older and better ways. Only later would the rapidly revolving wheel bring about a revolu- tion in the potter's artistic achievement and his ability to accelerate the production of first-rate wares. The small objects we recovered were of more historic than artistic value. They told us much about the technological status of the settlement, which, all in all, remained conservative but by no means backward or culturally inferior to more innovative places. We must avoid the non sequi tur that older equals inferior, an equation disproved, as we saw, in the case of the pottery. We see the same phenomenon in the obsidian and silex in- dustries; the implements produced were rather carelessly made, but this was because the imple- 173</page><page sequence="5">Profile and design of a spindle whorl with incised scene.

Metal technology was less accessible, in the hands of a comparatively small number of craftsmen who were properly equipped, whereas silex and obsidian were available materials, cheap and easy to work. Many smaller objects were made of clay. We unearthed spoons, loom weights, small covers and the so-called spindle whorls which were present in large numbers. The function of the spindle whorls is not entirely clear, but it seems likely that some of them were threaded to make necklaces. Some of the whorls had no decoration, and some had a purely ornamental design. Some, a very few, depicted human, animal or floral forms and have analogies with examples from Troy only. Thçse designs were incised in the clay, and the incisions were filled with a white chalky substance that made them more easily seen. One whorl which depicts human figures is especially important; its workmanship is of excellent quality, and the decor- ation is striking. In the center stands a figure with raised arms; each finger is clearly depicted. Flank- ing this central figure are other figures, who are possibly involved in a dance. Related representa- tions dating from the Neolithic to the Late Minoan period suggest that the central figure is a female divinity in epiphany; her attendants might be in- terpreted as her human worshipers or her divine companions. The metal technology of the Heraion was sub- stantial. We found a number of objects made of bronze and several molds from which such items were cast. Of special interest is a multiple mold, half of which survives. It was used in the casting of a variety of implements, some seven in all. Schliemann unearthed a very similar mold at Troy, and less complex molds of this kind are known to have been in use in the Early Bronze Age of Western Asia Minor and the Aegean. The mold is an open one in which roughly formed objects were cast, to be shaped and refined later through forging and cold working. Accordingly, the bronze objects we found included an incom- plete flat ax, needles of various kinds, small chis- els, fishhooks and a pair of very fine spiral brace- lets. Weapons, on the other hand, were con- spicuously absent. The number and quality of the bronzes found is really quite remarkable, con- sidering the relatively small area we excavated, and it makes it clear that this was an important center in the framework of the contemporary Western Asia Minor and Aegean cultures. 174</page><page sequence="6">Impression of a Mesopotamian cyl- inder seal on an indigenous Samian jar.

The settlement beneath the Heraion of Samos belongs to the west Anatolian Early Bronze Age culture. First recognized at Troy, this culture is now seen to embrace the western coast of Asia Minor and some of the Aegean islands nearby. Samos held a position on the border of this area, where it had contact with both the Gycladic world and to a lesser extent Minoan Crete. There is evidence of influences from both of these cul- tures. The taste for neat, incised decoration at a time when other west Anatolian sites show none, for instance, may be explained by the relationship of Samos with the Cyclades. The so-called duck vases which bear incised decoration are typically Gycladic, although most of those found in the settlement were of Samian, not Cycladic, manu- facture. We also found a vase with barbotine decoration which probably came from Crete - though this, too, had locally made imitations. Other imported items came from nearby west Anatolia; these included a tankard (a shape normally confined to the northern part of the west Anatolian sphere) and a splendid beak- spouted jug, the exact origin of which is not known. There is evidence, moreover, that the in- habitants of Samos had knowledge of and contact with other, more distant cultures. One of these was the Bronze Age town of Tarsus in Cilicia, over 600 miles away. From the impression of a seal on a locally made jar, apparently a Meso- potamian cylinder seal, we can deduce connec- tions with the Near East as well. This seal im- pression show three distinct hoofed animals. There is possibly some connection between such Oriental objects and the birth of indigenous figurai art like the so-called spindle whorls. The destruction of the settlement is contempo- rary with the end of Troy IV and the beginning of Troy V to judge from the similarities between the artifacts we found and those from these levels at Troy. Thus the absolute date of the conflagra- tion on Samos must be set in the last century of the third millennium b.c. The new excavations beneath the Heraion of Samos have helped us see the Early Bronze Age more clearly than we have been able to before, by creating a lively picture of life and civilization in the Aegean world towards the end of the third millennium b.c.' The settlement on Samos was a center of wealth and art whose contacts, by virtue of its position at a crossroad in the nexus of sea routes, extended across the Aegean and along the coast of Asia Minor. This settlement, spared from the ravages of a war which had destroyed a number of its neighbors some centuries before, succumbed to some mysterious disaster at what must have been the pinnacle of its greatness.
