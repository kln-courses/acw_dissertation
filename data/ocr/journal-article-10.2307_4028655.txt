DOI: 10.1017/S0007087404326178 The Great Exhibition read as a text is the latest addition to a series which includes texts as diverse as The Origin of Species, The Interpretation of Dreams, and The Second Sex. One major differ- ence between it and more conventional texts which nestle between two covers is that the 'text' of this exhibition consists of many millions of contemporary words and as many pictures as the evolving print technology could manage. At the time, the exhibition meant many different things to different observers: a showcase for industrial design, a manifestation of God's benign approval of His chosen England, a festival of labour, a pageant of peace and free trade, an advertisement for the achievements of capitalism in English hands, and the biggest ever bazaar of exotic goods. It thus offers historians plenty of scope for continuous reinterpretation. As Louise Purbrick says in her Introduction, Layers of meaning about the Great Exhibition have been produced in published contemporary assessments and in subsequent historical writing. Simultaneously an aesthetic and industrial, cultural and commercial, popular and imperial event, the understanding of its effect also has been revised with almost every academic trend and new disciplinary concern. (p. 6) So there is always much to be done, and equally there is something for everyone. One does not have to stroll far into the Crystal Palace before one encounters a 'Registered expanding and collapsing pianoforte for gentlemen's yachts', Prince Albert taking a stand on his dignity, Joseph Whitworth's micrometer with its claimed accuracy of a millionth of an inch, endless patchwork quilts, stuffed animals in cute anthropomorphic poses, celebratory verses by the dreadful Martin F. Tupper, James Nasmyth's steam hammer, or an 'Improved double truss for hernia invented by a labouring man'. Then, as now, the sheer miscellany precluded any attempt at exhaustive description. Purbrick's Introduction to this group of studies assesses the state of play of exhibition scholar- ship, and is a judicious survey of the different historiographical approaches which see the Exhi- bition variously as a political statement about peace and prosperity under a regime of free trade,</page><page sequence="2">Book reviews 479 a pacifier of working-class discontents, a Foucauldian panopticon, a consumerist dream, or a claim for the benefits of a benign worldwide empire. For my taste, she is altogether too polite about attempts to see the Crystal Palace as a hub of consumerism, or of imperialism, approaches that can be sustained only with lashings of hindsight; otherwise her survey would be hard to fault. Sadly for historians of science, the chapter on William Whewell, inaugural speaker in the series of 'Lectures on the results of the Great Exhibition of 1851' before the Society of Arts, has nothing useful to say about him. It is followed by three chapters which take the Exhibition as a point of departure, and then do more or less rapidly depart. R. C. Denis notes the growth after 1851 of the teaching of drawing to artisans, the natural language of technical understanding and communi- cation, but after a brief introduction the Exhibition is never mentioned again. Brian Maidment examines the lessons that the publisher and temperance campaigner John Cassell learnt during his coverage of the Exhibition for his later attempts to bring the arts to an artisan audience. Peter Gurney discusses the Crystal Palace as a locus for working-class festivals; again, most of the action takes place not in Hyde Park but in the reincarnated Crystal Palace in Sydenham, and on into the twentieth century. All three papers have merits, but none sheds much illumination on the Exhibition itself. The best two papers are saved till last. Both examine significant issues, in the shape of the ambivalent attitudes that were never far below the surface in 1851. Lara Kriegel looks at India, 'the brightest jewel in Victoria's crown', where oriental magnificence had existed from immem- orial ages, a land of penury and luxury, of dirt and exquisite finery, where unregulated and undisciplined artisans whose techniques clearly belonged to the past (and which thus constituted a measure of British progress) could produce far finer muslins than could any Manchester mill (and thus at the same time give a measure of the limits of progress). India emerged at the Exhi- bition 'as a civilisation that was at once miniature, gigantic, governable, unruly and uncontain- able' (p. 169). The ambivalent attitudes that Richard Pearson explores centre on the 'Us and Them' populist attitudes of most of the team of John Bullish Eurosceptics who ran Punch, and the difficulties that W. M. Thackeray therefore had with his colleagues. The Exhibition was always as much about showing Us off to Them as about bringing Them to Us. In his own satirical con- tributions Thackeray was concerned to maintain a two-way balance of assessment and ridicule. The insouciance of the others towards any balance was to contribute to his resignation from the group a little later. This is a useful exploration of yet more meanings surrounding the Exhibition. 'The Crystal Palace could not contain the meanings produced around its exhibits within its "great glass case"' (p. 169), says Kriegel, specifically of India, but the remark is more generally true. So there will always be more meanings of the Great Exhibition to examine, but for now this book has made its contribution. NICK FISHER University of Aberdeen</page></plain_text>
