<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES AND NEWS EXCAVATIONS AND SURVEYS Bethsaida, 2003* The fifteenth excavation season at Bethsaida, shorter than usual due to the political situa tion, was conducted from 1 July to 18 July 2003. The excavations were directed by R. Arav (University of Nebraska at Omaha), and co-directors were: N. Roddy (2003 coordina tor; Creighton University), C. Savage (Drew University), R. Freund (Hartford University, CT), M. Patrick (Drake University), H.-W. Kuhn and R. Franke (University of Munich, Germany). Other staff members were: S. Reynolds (archivist; University of Nebraska at Omaha), C. Dalenta (photography; Hartford University), P. Bauman (Komex International, Calgary, Alberta, Canada) and M. Fine (land surveyor; Hartford University). A total of 27 people participated in the expedition, includ ing students and volunteers. The Excavations The purpose of this season was to clarify and retrieve more information on several issues that were left unresolved during past seasons and were necessary in order to complete the final report on Stratum 5 for Bethsaida IV Excavations were conducted in Area A (the city-gate area) only. The fol lowing issues were addressed: 1. The connection between the Stratum 6 bastion and the four-chambered inner city-gate of Stratum 5 was examined; 2. The wall connecting the outer city gate and the bastion (W855) was investi gated; 3. A sounding was conducted in Chamber 4 in order to check possible walls sug gested by Ground Penetration Radar; 4. Efforts were made to retrieve addi tional information about the occupa tion layer dating from the Roman period. 1. The Bastion (fig. 1) The bastion (6x6 m.), located at the south east corner of the gate complex and pro truding to the east, was built when the city was founded (Stratum 6) and was in use during the subsequent occupation level (Stratum 5) as well. It was thoroughly destroyed during the Assyrian conquest in 732 BCE, and nothing was left above the elevation of -169.70, the lowest spot of the preserved floor level of Stratum 5.

Bethsaida: plan of 2003 season above the ruins of Stratum 6, remains of Stratum 2, dating from the Roman period, were found. In other words, the eastern sec tion of the gate complex was entirely destroyed below Stratum 5, and the next occupation level ? Stratum 2 ? was found directly superimposed on it. Locus 1525: The Iron Age and Roman Period City Walls (figs. 1-2) Since there were no remains left of the Stra tum 5 bastion and the eastern gate area was completely removed, it was important to determine whether any remains connect the bastion to Stratum 5 structures, which would indicate that the bastion was func tioning during Stratum 5 as well. The clos est Stratum 5 element to the bastion is the southern tower of the four-chambered city gate. In order to determine the connection between the two, the wall (W405) connect ing the two elements was excavated. Although segments of this wall have been excavated in the past few years, no connection to the southern wall has yet been established. The area selected for the excavation, located in square 56, was des ignated as Locus 1525. The debris from the top of W405 was removed and its northern face was cleaned. W405 was found to con tinue and connect the southern tower of the four-chambered city gate with the bastion. This discovery is significant as it indicates that the bastion, although constructed in Stratum 6, was part of the city-gate complex in Stratum 5. It also became apparent that W336 ? on top of W405 and thought to be Iron Age because it appears to be parallel to W328 (the western wing of the Stratum 5 outer city gate, in square 53) ? is in fact the only remnant of W405 of Stratum 5. During the Roman period (Stratum 2) it was modified and became a narrow wall in a north-south direction, parallel to the city wall. In the course of the excavation of Locus</page><page sequence="3">NOTES AND NEWS 103 Fig. 2. Bethsaida, 2003: aerial view; note paved road leading to the outer city gate, courtyard and inner city gate 1525, W856 emerged: a north-south wall (1.5 m. in length), overlapping W405 (fig. 3). Its thickness and solid construction indi cate that it is part of a Roman city wall, pre sumably built by Philip Herod in the first half of the first century CE. Segments of the Roman period city wall have already been excavated. During the 1994 season, a long segment of this wall was excavated on top of the Iron Age city wall in Area A south, in squares 58-59. The wall collapsed, possi bly in the third century CE, and debris of its collapse were found scattered over the area east of the wall in squares N-O 55-56. The layout of the debris indicates that it is the result of a severe earthquake. Locus 1525 contained Iron Age pottery and first- and second-century CE pottery, including Roman casseroles, globular cook ing pots with triple-ridged rims (the first half of the first century CE), early Galilean bowls and Roman glass (the end of the first to the early second century CE). The Connection between the Bastion and the Outer City Gate Past excavations have shown a wall con necting the bastion with the outer city gate, a distance of 15 m. Segments of this wall (W855) were found in squares O 54 and O 56. It is as yet of undetermined width (so far only 1.5 m. of its width has been exca vated), was built with large boulders and perhaps extends over the entire length of W855. The area west of this wall constituted the inner courtyard situated between the</page><page sequence="4">104 NOTES AND NEWS Fig. 3. Roman period city wall (W856) in foreground outer and inner city gates. Since Stratum 5 was not preserved in squares O 53-57, all the remains belong to Stratum 6. They con sist of the followings elements: 1) the east ern part of the outer city gate; 2) the inner courtyard, with a floor paved with small and medium-sized cobble stones covered with a layer of white plaster; 3) a debris layer (c. 30 cm.) between this floor and an upper clay floor and c. 1 m. of debris sepa rating the clay floor from the Stratum 5 floor. Excavation in this courtyard was con ducted in several loci: Locus 1508 in square O 54. ? This locus revealed mixed pottery of the Roman period and the Iron Age, testifying to a Roman occupation. Locus 1526 in square O 54. ? This locus has a similar mixture of Iron Age and Roman period sherds. Locus 1521 in square O 54. ? This is a probe to determine whether a postern stair way leads out of the city, presumably to the spring located at the bottom of the ravine, c. 50 m. south-east of the city gate. The fill above the Iron Age wall consisted of Roman period material in its entirety, including pottery and glass sherds. At the bottom of this locus, excavations encountered a well built Iron Age basalt blocking of a possible postern, which may have been added shortly before the city was conquered. Wall W855 seems to end c. 1.25 m. from the outer city gate (W403). Next season we shall examine this area to reveal whether it turned east. A bench was found set c. 25 cm. off alongside the western face of W855. This</page><page sequence="5">NOTES AND NEWS 105 discovery is significant as benches are identified with seats of city elders, often mentioned in the Bible. Monochrome deco rated sherds found on the floor of this stra tum date its construction to no later than the mid-tenth century BCE. The Probe in Chamber 4: Locus 1528 (fig. 4) In previous years, Ground Penetrating Radar indicated a possible wall running east-west for c. 2 m. below the floor of Chamber 4. Since the ground plan of Stra tum 6 in this area is not yet clear, a probe (2.5 3.6 m.) was conducted, beginning on 7 July 2003. It revealed two compact dirt floors of Stratum 5 (elevations: -169.73 and -170.15), c. 2 m. above the floor of Stratum 6 of the inner courtyard. The upper floor con tained red slip and burnished ware, clear Early Iron Age II sherds and scattered stones from some debris in this area. Mono chrome decorated sherds were found on both floors, indicating that their construc tion was no later than the mid-tenth century BCE. Two foundation trenches, made for the Stratum 5 northern tower, cut these floors. The foundation trenches indicate that the four-chambered gate was built after the floors went out of use. The Probe in Chamber 4: Loci 1529-1535 The Roman Period Stratum 2. ? These loci are located to the west of the Iron Age city gate (squares H 53-54). The occupation here is generally rather poor, built of stones of various sizes, probably mostly reused from the Iron Age occupation layers. The Fig. 4.

No defined architecture could be observed, though the walls appear to have been built on remains of older walls. Two parallel walls were observed in an east-west direction. Among the finds there were a few metal objects (including a bronze bell), a basalt square grinding stone, pottery sherds, glass and coins. Pottery. ? Pottery sherds include casse roles with everted rims, globular cooking pots with triple-ridged rims, Galilean bowls and fine ware of the Eastern Terra Sigilatta type, together with one example of North African Red Ware. These finds date from the first to the third centuries CE. Coins. ? Eight legible and two illegible coins were discovered in Area A (fig. 5). The area west of the city gate yielded third century coins, and the loci on the road to Bethsaida yielded first- and second-cen tury coins. One is a silver provincial Tetradrachm coin, minted in Antioch at the time of Philippus Senior (244-249 CE). Two coins date from the end of the first and the beginning of the second century CE, and all the others are third-century coins, perhaps hinting at the date of this occupation layer. A rare coin of the Emperor Gordianus III (238-244 CE) minted in Tyre was also found. All coins are from northern or north western mints, pointing to Bethsaida's ties with Provincia Arabia, with its capital city at Bostra or with Antioch. No coins have been found from any southern or south western mint at Bethsaida.

Support for the excavations has been received from the Philip and Muriel Berman Center for Biblical Archaeology of the Insti tute of Archaeology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the Irene Sala CARE Foun dation. The season's staff included D. Ben Shlomo, M. Frikeman and A. Shatil, all archae ology students at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Approximately 30 volunteers from Israel and overseas participated in the exca vation. The Excavations This season the excavations focused on one, new, excavation area: Area (fig. I).1 The name of the new excavation area is derived from its location on a small local mound called Tell Abu Nimmel in Arabic. Although Stekelis mentioned this locality in his ear lier work on Shacar ha-Golan, he never excavated there. Tell Abu Nimmel is a small shallow hill, covering an area of c. 5,000 sq.m. (five dunams) in the fields of Kibbutz Masada. The local kibbutz mem bers recall that the surface of Tell Abu Nimmel was very rich in Neolithic artefacts 40-60 years ago. Over the years the area underwent various changes, and nowadays it is mostly covered with a date plantation. The original topography of the summit was destroyed when a military installation was built here some 30 years ago. Part of the top was flattened, and an elongated deep depression was cut nearby. Nowadays, this depression is completely covered with gar bage from recent agricultural activities nearby. Tel Abu Nimmel was chosen for excava tion for three reasons: 1. It is located at the eastern edge of the ancient site, as detected by the site survey (Miller 2002). This raised the questions whether the Pottery Neo lithic settlement was indeed so large that it extended all the way to this loca tion and whether it was a built-up or open area. 2. The local topography of the Jordan Valley is basically flat. Does Tell Abu Nimmel represent a natural hill, or is it the result of many settlement layers, accumulated here over the years? Since only Neolithic artefacts were found in surface surveys prior to the excavation, we hoped that we would uncover earlier Neolithic phases, such as PPNA or PPNB. 3. The area has suffered badly from its use as a military installation, a garbage dump, and agricultural land in con stant use, and is severely damaged. It is quite possible that nothing will be left for future generations of researchers. It was our duty, therefore, to test this location before it disappeared com pletely. An area of 200 sq.m. was opened in 2004 and excavated from topsoil to virgin soil. We discovered four main phases, from top to bottom: 1. Modern activities; 2. A Late Islamic cemetery; 3. A Neolithic layer with two phases: the upper layer badly destroyed by modern activities and the cemetery, and a lower phase, also damaged, and with fragmentary architecture; 4. Virgin soil of the Yarmuk River delta. * Cf. IEJ 53 (2003): 223-228. 1 Thus far, running letters marked the exca vation areas at Shacar ha-Golan. The letters A-D indicate M. Stekelis' excavations during 1949-1952. Our previous excavation areas were called E-H.</page><page sequence="8">The two Neolithic phases discerned include part of a building at the eastern edge of the area (fig. 2). The central and western parts of Area functioned as an open area, with various installations and very rich debris, including much flint, as well as stone ves sels, pottery, animal bones and chunks of charcoal. The large flint assemblage included many axes, which were quite rare in Areas E and H. The area was also rich in stone utensils of limestone and basalt. Exotic items of obsidian and seashells were found as well. The pottery is classical Yarmukian pottery with typical forms and the classical herringbone-incised patterns. One new form was unearthed: a large stor</page><page sequence="9">NOTES AND NEWS 109 Fig. 2. Area during excavations (photo: Y. Garfinkel) age jar (pithos) with a raised neck and knob handles. Knob handles usually appeared on holemouth pithoi. A few figurines were found as well. The anthropomorphic figurines include an incised limestone pebble (fig. 3) and frag ments of clay items. An outstanding zoomorphic figurine found this season was a bovid head, made of clay, with emphasised horns (fig. 4). Leaving the Site All the excavation areas uncovered by us at Shacar ha-Golan were reburied. Area F was covered in 1998, the same year it was uncovered. Areas E and G were covered in 2003, and Areas H and at the end of the 2004 season. The areas were reburied according to the instructions received from the Israel Antiquities Authority. The first 20 cm. were covered manually by sand, and the rest was filled mechanically with local earth, up to the surface. Summary The data collected during the 11 field sea sons at Shacar ha-Golan clearly indicate that the site functioned as an urban settlement, on a scale previously unknown in the Neo lithic Near East. This is indicated by vari ous factors: 1. The site's size reaches 20 hectares. 2. In each of the excavated areas (E, F, G, and N) architectural remains were found. 3. The houses consist of a central court yard surrounded by several small rooms. This is an architectural concept that still exists in traditional Mediter ranean societies. The courtyard house makes its first appearance at Shacar ha Golan, giving the site special impor tance in architectural history. 4. The courtyard buildings are monu mental in size (225-700 sq.m.). 5. The houses abut one another, a dense pattern observed both in Area E, near</page><page sequence="10">110 NOTES AND NEWS Fig. 3. Incised pebble from Area (photo: G.

Three passageways were uncovered in the excavation, including a central street (c. 3 m. wide), paved with peb bles set in mud, and a narrow winding alley (1 m. wide). These are the earliest streets discovered in Israel and among the earliest streets discovered in the world. There is a network of grid-like streets, some running from north to east and others from west to south. A well (4.26 m. deep) was dug into the water table. It is indicative of advanced hydrological knowledge and techno logical engineering. Fig. 4. Clay zoomorphic head from Area (photo: G.
