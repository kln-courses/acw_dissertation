<plain_text><page sequence="1">80 List of Early Christian Cross Slabs in Seven North-Western Counties Michael Herity, Dorothy Kelly and Ursula Mattenberger, Members An illustrated list of cross-slabs at sites on the mainland in seven north-western counties of Ireland is presented with a historical introduction. The present numbers can be compared with those known to Crawford, whose lists were published in this Journal in 1912 and 1913. The list printed below is based on a survey of the early Christian sculpture in the eight north western counties of Ireland, the first part of a projected national survey, begun in 1994 with the aid of a grant from the Heritage Council and submitted at the end of 1998. A provisional list of sites to be visited was compiled from older references and lists in the literature, principal among them Crawford's meticulous survey (1912, 1913), Wakeman's survey of the material on Inishmurray Island (1893), the work of Wakeman and Lowry-Corry in the Fermanagh area and several publications by Francoise Henry, beginning with her paper, Early Christian Slabs and Pillar Stones in the West of Ireland (1937). Macalister's lists of those cross-decorated stones having inscriptions in the two volumes of his Corpus Inscriptionum Insularum Celticarum (1945, 1949) were also used, together with Price's list of the slabs and cross-pillars of the Gleanncholmcille valley in Donegal (1941). The general surveys published in recent years, beginning with the volume for Donegal (Lacy et al. 1983) and the Sites and Monuments Record compiled by the Office of Public Works for the various counties, were also consulted, together with the earlier Preliminary Survey of the Ancient Monuments of Northern Ireland (PS AMNI), published in 1940. Early work collecting inscriptions by Petrie and his pupil Wakeman, beginning in the 1830s, was compiled and edited by Margaret Stokes after Petrie's death in the two volumes of Christian Inscriptions in the Irish Language, published by this Society (1872, 1878). Though not wholly free of error, this early compilation includes much material which has since disap peared. The earliest published description and drawing of a cross-ornamented slab from the region is that with inscription from Kilcummin in Mayo, which, though no longer extant, can be taken as drawn and described reasonably accurately; this was described in a paper read by the Revd James Little at the Royal Irish Academy in 1802 and published in the following year in the Academy's Transactions (1803). This first part of the national survey covered the eight counties of Donegal, Londonderry, Fermanagh, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo and Tyrone. The aim of the survey is to provide descriptions and illustrations of all available Irish early Christian cross-slabs and pillar-stones to a'modern standard, together with an indication of their location and context, and to provide authoritative geological identifications. In carrying out the survey, priority is given to providing as full a record as possible of unprotected material still at or near its original site. It was decided that material in safe-keeping in museums and other centres could be first described and refer enced, and later illustrated. Descriptions have been completed of 381 carved stones identified as early Christian. These are found or were originally located in 130 townlands. A noteworthy feature of the survey is the Archaeology Department, University College, Dublin 4. JRSAI Vol. 127 (1997): 80-124</page><page sequence="2">LIST OF EARLY CHRISTIAN CROSS SLABS IN SEVEN NORTH-WEST COUNTIES 81 large number of townlands, 45 in all, in which two or more slabs or pillars are found. Examples of larger collections are Conwal (18), Cloontuskert (14), Boheh (6), Carrowntemple (15) and, offshore, Tory Island (5), Rathlin O'Birne (8), Inishmurray (70), Inishkea North (11) and Caher Island (14). Many of the collections of slabs and pillars at these sites are interesting in the degree to which they represent homogeneous, distinctive and often highly accomplished styles. This feature, already documented in Wakeman's work on Inishmurray (1893) and Henry's on Inishkea North (1945, 1951), has been recently demonstrated again in Herity's publication of the material from the Gleanncholmcille valley, the Loughros peninsula, and the islands of Rathlin O'Birne and Caher Island (1990a; 1995b; 1995c). This north-western region is also dis tinguished by exceptional numbers of very elaborate carved stones and by the very large numbers of slabs which occur on islands from Inishtrahull and Tory in the north to the Inishkeas, Clare Island and Caher Island off the Mayo coast. In all 121 decorated stones recorded in the catalogue and appendices are found on these Atlantic islands. These are not included in the list published here. Of the 389 carved stones recognised 297 were previously listed and published and 45 were listed by the Sites and Monuments Record of the OPW but not to our knowledge previously fully described or drawn for publication. A small number of carvings previously identified as early Christian have not been included. A total of 47 new decorated stones, neither described nor drawn previously, were discovered during the course of this survey, including, for example, Greenan, county Sligo, Roscommon Town and Fuerty (01), county Roscommon, and Feenune (01), Cairowrevagh and Carrowteige, county Mayo, and the slabs discovered in 1997 by David MacGuinness and Markus Redmond in the souterrain at Straid in Gleanncholmcille, county Donegal (thanks are due to Professor S. 6 Cathain and Mr C. Corlett for information on Carrowteige, and Fuerty and Carrowrevagh, respectively). The efforts of two tireless workers in the West, Michael Gibbons and Jim Higgins, must also be acknowledged. The main Catalogue lists 345 cross-marked stones. As a number of these have two or more decorated faces, the total number of decorated faces recorded is 395. The report also documents 36 slabs or pillars recorded or mentioned previously, which were not found in the course of this survey. During the course of the survey we recorded the disappearance of 7 slabs from 5 sites in county Donegal which had been documented by Lacy in 1983. The fact that three further slabs . recorded since the present survey began in 1994 seem to have disappeared from the sites of Aighan in Donegal, and Termon and Fallmore in Mayo gives further cause for concern. Care was taken in the course of the field survey to obtain an accurate first-hand record of measurements, ornamental details, orientation and geological identifications of the slabs and pillar-stones. The drawings made later, after leaving the field, normally at a scale of one-third, are intended to be published at a scale of one-tenth. An example by which the standards of visual recording of the present survey might be judged is the massive Fahan Mura slab (Fig 26): Lacy's ASCD shows photographs (Pis. 43, 44) of both the east and west faces which do not extend to the foot of the design on the west face. While they are excellent records of the ornament and show the depth of the carving, the photographs published by Henry (1940, Pl. 20; 1965, Pis. 52, 54) and Harbison (1986, Pis. 4.9a, b, 4.10a) again do not show important details, particularly at the foot of the west face. A second example is documented in Fig. 22, where a comparison of three drawings of a slab from Inishmurray, county Sligo, is presented: (a) the drawing made by the present survey, (b) the drawing made by W. F. Wakeman in 1878 (1893, 76, Fig. 36, No. 2), (c) Margaret Stokes's drawing made in 1866 (1878, 16, Pl. X, 20). Wakeman's drawing is idealised, the vertical and</page><page sequence="3">82 MICHAEL HERITY et al. horizontal lines of the cross are shown as incised and are drawn as if with a ruler; the curvilin ear terminals on the head and arms are magnified and idealised by comparison with the actual details on the slab. There is no indication of a second, lower transom which is clearly repre sented in the drawing by Stokes. Her drawing, while it gives an impression of the false relief carving which is an intrinsic feature of the slab, is also misleading in that it is based on ruled lines and depicts exaggerated spiral terminals. Severe weathering of the surface of the stone makes elements of the design uncertain today and may also have inhibited Wakeman in 1878. The distinction made between cross and sup porting pillar is based on the greater width of the lower element and an apparent curvilinear swelling between the two, features drawn neither by Stokes nor Wakeman. Faint traces of two horizontal parallel lines on the right-hand side at the top of this pillar may mark an arm; spalling has removed the corresponding evidence on the left-hand side. Margaret Stokes confidently shows a second transom at this level in her drawing done on the island in 1866 (1878, PI. X, 20). The evidence remaining today, taken with the evidence of Stokes's drawing, supports an interpretation of a Latin cross standing on a somewhat broader Tau-shaped supporting element which ends in a short stake. The measurements given in Wakeman's text accord well with those recorded by the present survey. Stokes gives no measurements in her text but the scale of her drawing, given as one sixth, is wrong; the actual scale is nearer to one-twelfth. The variety of cross forms encountered in the survey ranges from simple to complex, from rude to accomplished. The survey has clarified somewhat the range of patterns to be expected and this range should become clearer as the national survey progresses. Preliminary indications suggest that a great deal of cognate material exists in the south-west of Ireland and it is hoped to continue the national survey in eight south-western and southern counties when financial support becomes available. Publication of the first part of the full Catalogue is envisaged as soon as work on the actual survey of the south-west has reached an advanced stage and a pre liminary survey of the whole country from published sources is available to give a clear and comprehensive picture of the total context. In the meantime, the present list is offered as an indi cation of the value of a national survey of this invaluable part of our early Christian heritage; it is hoped that it is a worthy updating of Crawford's lists. The literature References given in it are minimal. A number of the early Christian slabs and pillars encountered in the course of the present survey had inscriptions. All those which depicted a cross have been included here. The value of a specialised epigraphic study of these inscriptions is undoubted; indeed, it was recognised as early as Petrie's time in the nineteenth century (Stokes 1872; 1878). Special methods of recording need to be devised for this epigraphic study, which would greatly extend our knowledge of early writing in Ireland by comparison with writing available on early metalwork and in manuscripts. Acknowledgements The study on which this listing is based could not have been undertaken and completed without the support of the President and Governing Body of University College, Dublin, in financial and other resources.
