<plain_text><page sequence="1">Schenker's Mysterious Five SUZANNAH CLARK This article focuses on Schenker's role in what Milton Babbitt has called the "occupational malady of theorists of music," namely the de- sire to search for the origin or proof of a theory outside its own system.1 Babbitt uses the sev- enteenth-century theorist Marin Mersenne to illustrate his point. In seeking to explain the derivation of the major triad, Mersenne claimed that one must proceed through six divisions of the string; but he need only have busied him- self with the first five divisions, whose notes CCGCE already yield the requisite pitches. If five were enough, why choose six? For consis- 19th-Century Music XXIII/1 (Summer 1999). ? by The Regents of the University of California.

The sixth division, which produces an- other G, turns out to be the limit of conso- nances because the seventh creates a (flat) mi- nor seventh. Given, thus, that the extra G does not alter the pitch content of the triad, six divisions can serve both to yield the triad and the limit of consonances. While this consis- tency was compelling, Mersenne nevertheless felt the need to come up with a greater signifi- cance for the number six. So, he appealed to the oldest explanation, the cosmological justi- fication: at the time Mersenne was writing, there were six known planets. Finding support for the laws of music theory in cosmology was an accepted but hazardous pursuit. As Babbitt points out, the fact that more planets have since been discovered either invalidates Mersenne's theory or shows music to be founded on the wrong number.2 Indeed this kind of appeal to science highlights an important paradox: while scientific "facts" ap- pear to endow music theory with the authority of universal truth, scientific progress is itself founded on the possibility of continually revis- 2Babbitt, "Past and Present," p. 5. 84</page><page sequence="2">ing those "facts." Each new scientific discov- ery might seem an attractive empirical basis for music, but it cannot necessarily remain fixed.3 One of the most decisive and long-last- ing scientific influences on common-practice music theory, however, was the discovery of the overtone series. Rameau's excitement about it is evident: the principles set forth in his first and still most famous treatise, Traite de l'harmonie (1722), were based on the old-style divisions of the monochord. Soon after its pub- lication, he learned of the existence of the over- tone series (as produced by the corps sonore), which he decided clinched his argument about the fundamental bass and the harmonic foun- dation of music in a more deep-rooted way.4 The appeal of the corps sonore was undoubt- edly the apparently unmediated connection of harmony to it: rather than arising from divi- sion, whose proportions may be natural but whose demonstration depended on human in- tervention, harmony was an intrinsic and in- disputable part of every sound.5 Whatever the chosen starting principle (whether natural, scientific, or philosophical), theorists have often assumed that the right foun- dation would be the one that could most com- fortably be shown to govern all aspects of to- nality: the triad, the scale, harmonic succes- sion, and form. It was undoubtedly the omni- presence of the overtone series that made it seem a particularly attractive principle-how to interpret its influence on music continually challenged music theorists. As Thomas Christensen has recently explained, Rameau himself struggled throughout his theoretical career to identify how it exercised control over music's basic elements and principles.6 Har- monic treatises from Rameau's day to the early twentieth century can be read as attempts to iron out the kinks in the series' relationship to musical practice. How do theorists justify ex- tracting only a certain number of tones from the infinite number in the series? How are the minor mode, the scales, and harmonic succes- sion said to relate to it? The habit of seeking explanations for tonality in the patterns in over- tones was rarely subjected to rigorous ques- tioning until the advent of serialism in the twentieth century, which brought about a shift toward "logical" organizing principles.7 Schenker, an avid supporter of a naturalist underpinning for music theory, comes into this history more or less at its conclusion; but nev- SUZANNAH CLARK Schenker's Mysterious Five 31It is interesting that although Babbitt rightly sees the futility of basing musical principles in scientific explana- tion, he partook in a different kind of scientific underpin- ning for music theory-and one which is only seemingly safer-namely, the adoption of scientific language and method (but not the specific scientific ideas) into theoreti- cal discourse. On the effects of introducing the methods of science into music theory, see Marion A. Guck, "Rehabili- tating the Incorrigible," in Theory, Analysis and Meaning in Music, ed. Anthony Pople (Cambridge, 1994), pp. 57-73; and Matthew Brown and Douglas J. Dempster, "The Sci- entific Image of Music Theory," Journal of Music Theory 33 (1989), 65-106. With regards to Schenker, there are many studies about the effect of "scientific" language in translations of his writings. Among them are: William Rothstein, "The Americanization of Schenker," in Schenker Studies, ed. Hedi Siegel (Cambridge, 1990), pp. 193-203; and Robert Snarrenberg, Schenker's Interpretive Practice (Cambridge, 1997). 4The existence of the overtone series was brought to Rameau's attention by the physicist and Jesuit father Louis- Bertrand Castel in his review of Rameau's treatise, which appeared in the Journal de Trevoux (October-November 1722), reproduced in The Complete Theoretical Writings of Jean-Philippe Rameau (1683-1764), ed. Erwin R. Jacobi, vol. 1 (American Institute of Musicology, 1967), pp. xxviii- xlix. Rameau first responded to the news in Nouveau systeme de musique thdoretique et pratique (1726), but did not begin to explore the theoretical potential of the corps sonore until his Generation harmonique ou traite de musique thdorique et pratique (1737). The purpose of his next treatise, Demonstration du principe de l'harmonie servant de base a tout l'art musical thdorique et pratique (1750), was, as the title suggests, to demonstrate scientifi- cally how it serves as the founding principle of music, that is of all harmonic succession as well as of harmonic chords themselves. For a detailed reading of how Rameau's mul- tiple treatises relate to development of scientific under- standing of the corps sonore, see Thomas Christensen, Rameau and Musical Thought in the Enlightenment (Cam- bridge, 1993), esp. chap. 6. 5Rameau was also excited about the existence of the over- tone series because it seemed to offer proof that the origin of music was harmonic and not melodic, as his rival Jean- Jacques Rousseau claimed in Essai sur l'origine des langues, oi il est parl' de la melodie, et de l'imitation musicale, Bibliotheque du Graphe (Paris, 1976). 6Christensen, Rameau and Musical Thought, passim. 7The beginning of this can be traced in Schoenberg's writ- ings. In his 1926 essay "Opinion or Insight?", he contem- plated the degree to which tonal music is natural: "Tonality's origin is found-and rightly so-in the laws of sound" (Style and Idea [Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1975], p. 259). He argued, however, that this does not preclude other kinds of musical expression, whose laws are based on internal relationships: "There is no reason in physics or aesthetics that could force a musician to use tonality in order to represent his idea" (ibid., p. 262). 85</page><page sequence="3">19TH ertheless he marks an important break with CENUTRY tradition. While his harmony treatise involves a conventional beginning, with a look at the derivation of the major-minor system from the overtone series, Schenker saw his contribution as a completely new way of imagining that origin; in particular, one that explained and solved its mysteries for the first time.8 The trick, he felt, was to distinguish nature's role from that of the artist in the creation of tonal- ity.9 He stated that the overtone series was a phenomenon of the physical world whose pres- ence could only affect a musical system if art- ists were capable of tapping it through their intuition. It was but a "hint" from which tri- ads, scales, and musical form were shaped. In- terestingly, he believed that this hint would have remained forever mute were it not for artists: Nature's help to music consisted of nothing but a hint, a counsel forever mute (ein ewig stummer Rat), whose perception and interpretation were fraught with the gravest difficulties. No one could exagger- ate, hence, the admiration and gratitude we owe to the intuitive power with which the artists have di- vined Nature. . . . This hint, then, was dropped by Nature in the form of the so-called 'overtone series.' This much-discussed phenomenon, which consti- tutes Nature's only source for music to draw upon, is much more familiar to the instinct of the artist than to his consciousness.10 There are a number of reasons why Schenker would put things this way. Because the over- tone series is a phenomenon of nature, it has always been present, though Schenker surely is the only theorist to think of it as mute. As he rightly points out, it was not always known to humankind-as discussed above, its discovery dates from the seventeenth century, and it was not properly understood even in Rameau's day. Brought to life by the artist, it was even impor- tant to Schenker that the phenomenon could be misunderstood: the artist's misunderstand- ing of nature is to blame for church modes, pretonal music, and presumably non-Western music; post-tonal music was of course the re- sult of a distancing between nature's hint and the artist's intuition. According to Schenker, then, the tonal sys- tem is a combined effort between nature and the artist. It might at first seem that the intro- duction of the artist into the creation of the system is a sign that Schenker was diminishing the role of the overtone series. As we shall see, however, the artist's input is limited in a way that foregrounds the aspects of the derivation that Schenker deemed natural. Moreover, al- though the quotation above indicates that the overtone series is nature's only source from which music was created, organic replication turns out to be another natural phenomenon important to the creation of scales and musical form. As will be shown below, the fact that Schenker believed that the source combines with organicism allowed him to leap from the creation of the triad (which was dependent on this source) to the creation of the tonal system (which was dependent on the organic replica- tion of the source). While both aspects of na- ture are infinite, the tonal system is closed and finite: a triad has only three notes and fits within the octave, the scale goes from tonic to tonic also within an octave, and musical form un- folds within an "obligatory register" between 8Heinrich Schenker, Harmony, trans. Elisabeth Mann Borgese, ed. and ann. Oswald Jonas (Cambridge, Mass., 1973). The first German edition was published anony- mously "von einem Kiinstler" as Harmonielehre, vol. 1 of Neue musikalische Theorien und Phantasien (Vienna, 1906). For the kind of tone Schenker adopted to distance himself from his predecessors and especially his contem- poraries, see Leslie David Blasius, Schenker's Argument and the Claims of Music Theory (Cambridge, 1996), esp. chap. 1. 9Opinions on Schenker's use of nature are not always ex- plicitly stated but are often easily inferred. Allen Forte ("Schenker's Conception of Musical Structure," in Read- ings in Schenker Analysis and Other Approaches, ed. Maury Yeston [New Haven, 1977], pp. 3-37) describes Schenker's system without any mention of its natural un- derpinning and sees Schenker's view of the history of tri- adic tonality as "desultory" (p. 36). Edward Aldwell and Carl Schachter are skeptical about the overtone series' regulatory function for tonal music in Harmony and Voice Leading (New York, 1978), pp. 21-22. Nicholas Cook rightly argues for the need to know the details of this underpinning in order to understand the "otherwise arbi- trary prejudices and restrictions in his analytical tech- niques" in A Guide to Musical Analysis (Oxford, 1987), p. 39. On the illogicality of simply taking the Ursatz as a formal and informal axiom, however, see Eugene Narmour, Beyond Schenkerism: The Need for Alternatives in Music Analysis (Chicago, 1977), pp. 12-30. 'oSchenker, Harmony, p. 20. 86</page><page sequence="4">an opening and closing tonic." Why did the music of nature need adjusting? Why could it not function as music in its raw state? Why indeed was it mute? As Schenker saw it, hu- mans needed to create a closed musical sys- tem, to limit nature because nature had im- posed limits on them: the ear (God-given) is capable of hearing only a certain number of partials; the voice (God-given) can sing only within a certain range.'2 So, there are two lay- ers of limitation here: nature created us with a limited ability to perceive and to make sound; and we (particularly, the artist) therefore needed to limit nature. Nature may have given us a voice, but we (or the artist in tune with nature's hint) gave nature voice, transforming its vibra- tions into tonality. The act of trimming nature's overtone series and its organic urge was termed "abbreviation" (Abbreviation) by Schenker. This principle is not new: for example, Mersenne had stopped at six divisions, Rameau at the fifth partial of the series. Abbreviation, then, was a pedigreed theo- retical act, a human intervention used to con- trol nature. At the same time, theorists sought to have abbreviation itself controlled by some other phenomenon in order to fix where it takes place. Had Schenker studied Mersenne, then, he would undoubtedly have argued that he was not wrong to have limited the number of divi- sions of the string but was wrong to have lim- ited it to six and to have invoked the number of planets. Similarly, Rameau would have been wrong only in his reliance on the audibility of tones to abbreviate the corps sonore. Schenker's controlling phenomenon, by contrast, was a number that carried no external associations- no planets, no aural exercises; just a pattern. He continually spotted the number five in the derivation of tonality, and its recurrence lent it credibility. Thinking it nevertheless had some kind of otherworldly presence, he went so far as to call it the Mysterious Five (geheimnisvolle Fiinfzahl), and in so doing instilled in it the quality of being an inexplicable, enigmatic or, at the very least, noncontrovertible structuring force.'3 Characteristically, he gave the impres- sion that it is an observed and not an invented property.'4 It is, as he tried to indicate, not humanly derived. Although the Mysterious Five and abbrevia- tion are intimately connected, the significance of Schenker's use of the former has been over- looked, largely because it has been considered less important than the principle of abbrevia- tion itself. It hardly receives a mention in mod- ern literature, except as an object of derision, as by Robert Snarrenberg, who dismisses it with- out discussion as one of Schenker's "irrational justifications" for the conceptual priority of the Naturklang.'5 Or, in a brief description of Schenker's explanation of the origin of tonal- ity, Matthew Brown accuses Schenker of mak- ing "ad hoc assumptions," being at times "rather arbitrary," and offering "no logical rea- son" for his choices. In each of these cases, the factor Brown has missed is the Mysterious Five.16 Surprisingly, such attitudes originated with Schenker's own students. Oswald Jonas, in his annotations of Harmony, pronounced himself unconvinced by Schenker's use of the number, remarking that Schenker's "argument might have been more convincing if it had been SUZANNAH CLARK Schenker's Mysterious Five "All but the concept of obligatory register appear in Har- mony.

Interestingly, he also comments on the limit of the eye in relation to the five-line staff in sec. 11. '3The first few times Schenker observes the presence of the number five, he does not associate it with the mysteri- ous (see Harmonielehre, pp. 37-38). At one point, in rela- tion to abbreviation, he mentions that the human ear has "wunderbarerweise bei der Fiinfzahl halt gemacht!" (ibid., p. 43). Only once he has begun to show that the number returns at different stages in the creation of tonality does mysteriousness begin to feature in his vocabulary, and the word he uses is "geheimnisvoll" (ibid., pp. 39, 51, and 54). Later, as though fully convinced of its validity, he refers to it simply as a principle: "das Prinzip der Fiinfzahl" (ibid., p. 268). My use of the term "Mysterious Five" comes from the moment Schenker described it (most succinctly) as the "geheimnisvolle Fiinfzahl" (ibid., p. 51). 14Schenker made a similar claim concerning his discovery of the fundamental line in Das Meisterwerk in der Musik: Ein Jahrbuch, vol. II (Munich, 1926), p. 41, where he claimed "Ich habe die Urlinie erschaut, nicht errechnet!" '5Snarrenberg, Schenker's Interpretive Practice, p. 10, n. 3. '6Matthew Brown, "The Diatonic and the Chromatic in Schenker's Theory of Harmonic Relations," Journal of Mu- sic Theory 30 (1986), 10. 87</page><page sequence="5">19TH restricted to a consideration of the generally CENTURY valid and essential law of abbreviation rather MUSIC than extending to the 'mysterious' number five, a concept that is bound to remain more or less doubtful." He repeated this objection, this time in connection with another feature of Schenker's derivation of the major-minor sys- tem (namely, the derivation of scale, which will be discussed shortly): "Again, more em- phasis should be put on the principle of abbre- viation than on the 'number five'."'7 Perhaps he thought his teacher had fallen prey to super- stition. What he missed, however, was the cen- trality of the Mysterious Five in Schenker's attempt to pin down a specific and inevitable location for abbreviation. Abbreviation needs the Mysterious Five in order to make it predict- able and to prevent it from being a random process. In basing his theory on a "pure" num- ber (albeit one with mysterious powers) rather than, say, on a quantity of planets (a la Mersenne), Schenker may have avoided the problems inherent in relying on a constantly changing body of scientific knowledge, but he found only an apparently safer option. To be sure, Jonas was right to call attention to the number as a curious theoretical feature (or part of this occupational malady), but the aim of this article is to point out how Schenker relied on it to shape every aspect of his theory from the origin of the triad to, ultimately, the content of the fundamental structure. It is, as we shall see, responsible for the degree to which Schenker excluded foreign keys from the basic structure, regardless of how central they seem in the formal organization of a work. In other words, it is responsible for what we have come to regard as the essence of the Schenkerian system. Indeed, the fact that the principle of the Mysterious Five stayed in Schenker's mind throughout his theoretical career is evident from a reference to it again in Free Composition in the epilogue to the section on form. He argued there that it determines the limit of compre- hensibility for the number of repetitions a rondo may sustain. The number is again taken to be the all-important cut-off point in a form that otherwise threatens indefinite repetition: The key to form lies, in some hidden (Mysterium) way, in the number of parts. Just as 2, 3, 4, and 5 differ from one another, so do the forms derived from these numbers differ in their inner nature and significance. Strangely, in agreement with the prin- ciple of the number 5 (Gesetz der Fainfzahl) which I mentioned in my Harmony (sec. 11), the number five also represents the limit in the world of form. The above-mentioned seven-part rondo (sec. 318) is only an extension of the five-part form, which leaves the essential nature of the rondo untouched.'8 Crucially, the quotation mentions that "the key to form lies, in some hidden way, in the number of parts" (emphasis added)-all refer- ences to the Mysterious Five indicate that it is a property "hidden" from view. II The opening chapters of Schenker's Harmony are not, then, so much a retelling of the sup- posed birth of tonality as they are the uncover- ing-for the first time, Schenker claimed-of the hidden structure of tonality, a structure hidden from view because we tend to think of "the" major triad in its closed five-three form and of scales in steps. In Harmony, Schenker exposed the "real" artist's instinctive under- standing of tonality's construction. In other words, it was there to be discovered all along. It existed during the era of church modes but was not expressed by musical practitioners (to the detriment, Schenker would say, of music); and it existed during the era of tonality and was felt (only) by the geniuses;19 but it was neither ex- '7Schenker, Harmony, pp. 26, n. 17 and 30, n. 19 respec- tively. '8Schenker, Free Composition, p. 145 (emphasis added). 19For Schenker, genius is a kind of medium: "A great tal- ent or a man of genius, like a sleepwalker, often finds the right way, even when his instinct is thwarted by one thing or another or, as in our case, by the full and conscious intention to follow the wrong direction. The superior force of truth-of Nature, as it were-is at work mysteriously behind his consciousness, guiding his pen, without caring in the least whether the happy artist himself wanted to do the right thing or not" (Harmony, p. 60). "The capacity for such a comprehensive feeling for the principal chord is a privilege of geniuses, which Nature has bestowed upon them. They dissolve the tonic triad into the melodic mo- tion of the Urlinie and, at the same time, a few individual chords which are then split up again and again. Such a feeling cannot be nurtured artificially"; Schenker, "On 88</page><page sequence="6">1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 C, c, g, c1, el gl, -bl, c2, d2, e2, _f#2 g2, -a2, -bb2 b2, c2 n (-) oe-(o SUZANNAH CLARK Schenker's Mysterious Five Example 1: Overtone series to sixteenth partial from Schenker, Harmony, p. 21. 45l third fifth 1-40 fundamental Example 2: "The Major Triad in Nature," Schenker, Harmony, p. 26. f fifth Sf-. fhthird fundamental Example 3: "The Major Triad in Our System," Schenker, Harmony, p. 28. plained nor consciously understood until Schenker revealed it. I now turn to the details of this explanation. The first part of Schenker's explanation con- cerns the creation of the triad, which emerges from the overtone series. Schenker provided a sample of the overtone series that reaches the Organicism in Sonata Form," The Masterwork in Music: A Yearbook, v.2 (1926), ed. William Drabkin (Cambridge, 1996), p. 23. Also, Schenker writes that "to conceive [mu- sicality] on the higher plane of creativity demands the concept of a genius-spirit who, by creating secretly from the background of an Ursatz, masters all the arpeggiations of the many individual chords and all diminutions of the composing-out progressions" (ibid., p. 28). It is often said that Schenker's initial anonymous pub- lication of Harmonielehre as "von einem Kiinstler" indi- cated the author's desire to distance himself from the tra- dition of theory (see Harmony, pp. v and 21). Given his notion of the genius figure, however, he could equally be aligning himself with the genius, not in order to claim intellectual prowess but rather to suggest that he is a ve- hicle, specifically nature's vehicle, exposing the Truth about tonality. For a discussion of Schenker's notion of genius, see Nicholas Cook, "Schenker's Theory of Music as Eth- ics," Journal of Musicology 7 (1989), 415-39. Robert Snarrenberg also discusses Schenker's references to genius and his comparisons with the sleepwalker, but he con- cludes, however, that Schenker's use of the "as if" clause suggests he was unconvinced by his speculation that na- ture had a mysterious power (Schenker's Interpretive Prac- tice, pp. 84-86). sixteenth partial (ex. 1),20 and he introduced the Mysterious Five to assert that its practical ap- plication stops at the fifth partial; those tones that lie beyond are, he claimed, incomprehen- sible and hence unusable in tonal music.21 But the three tones of the triad range more than three octaves in their natural state (ex. 2) and must, in order to be more comprehensible, be reordered within the space of an octave. The closed triad (ex. 3) is therefore an artificial ar- rangement of notes and thus "hides" both its origin in the overtone series and the process of abbreviation according to the Mysterious Five. In Schenker's view, the scale as we.know it-a series of tones and semitones-is also gov- erned by the Mysterious Five. Setting out to show how the scale developed from natural principles, Schenker found a tangible formula- tion of its origin by combining two crucial im- ages. The first, which I shall term "nature as physical phenomenon," pertains to observations about the physical facts of acoustics, connected in particular to the overtone series; the second, which I shall call "nature as organic metaphor," has to do with biological or organic growth, interpreted as a process of replication. Schenker claimed that, in its natural state, the scale is ordered not by steps but by fifths. The fifth is a manifestation of "nature as physi- cal phenomenon," for it stems from the over- tone series. It was presumably the obvious choice for the basic interval of the scale be- cause it is the first in the series after the oc- 20Why did Schenker's sample of the overtone series end at the sixteenth partial? Although he indicates the series is infinite, this selection suggests a closed system (the six- teenth partial is the note C). 21Ultimately only the pattern and not the tuning of the first five notes interested Schenker, who simply saw equal temperament as a practical adaptation of nature. He spent no time justifying it, instead dismissing any objections with the advice that "more detailed information about this phenomenon can be found in any dictionary of mu- sic" (Harmony, p. 83). 89</page><page sequence="7">19TH CENTURY MUSIC it- Example 4: Sequence of fifth-projections according to the principle of Entwicklung; from Schenker, Harmony, p. 29. tave.22 According to Schenker, then, the origi- nal form of the scale spans four octaves (ex. 4). In a similar fashion to the triad, it was at some stage reorganized into its familiar stepwise pat- tern, bringing it within the range of an octave for the purposes of artistic comprehension. Schenker maintained, however, that the fifth- relationship within the overtone series was the real (but hidden) connective tissue between tones in the scale. Example 4 characterizes how Schenker reck- oned that the process of repeated fifth projec- tion works. A fundamental-the tonic of the scale-projects a fifth, selected from its inher- ent overtone series. This fifth then becomes an independent agent or new fundamental. As a fundamental, it can project its own overtone series, out of which another fifth is selected. The capacity for each new tone to project its own overtone series forever yields fresh fifths, making each tone other than the first (the tonic of the scale) both a created fifth and a creator of a (new) fifth. What is it that permitted Schenker to assume that a created tone can become an independent agent newly capable of projecting another series? And what is the impetus for this replication? Schenker's answer was to anthropomorphize these tones and treat them as organic material. He adopted nature's procreative urge into his speculative reconstruction of scales and im- posed on musical tones a metaphoric organicism that allowed him to liken the generation of fifth projections to human generation-a pic- ture of the Bach family tree made his point.23 Thus he combined the biological feature of spe- cies generation wherein each being can be both an infant and a parent (nature as organic meta- phor) with the physical fact of overtones (na- ture as physical phenomenon). That is to say, nature designed the fifth in the overtone series, and the fifth, the metaphorical umbilical cord, is the connective interval between each tone of the scale. But alas, nature in its purest form yields an infinite array of replications. Schenker there- fore appealed again to his notion of abbrevia- tion, which, if it is to be consistent with the process applied to the triad, demands that artis- tic interference occur at the fifth stage of the process (ex. 5). It does. But it is important to note how Schenker reached his count: because the scale is created through the organic replica- tion of the interval of the fifth, he counted the number of replications in the process. Before- when locating abbreviation of the overtone se- ries with respect to the production of the triad- he counted the number of elements; five par- 22Schenker never really justified his choice of the fifth, probably not feeling he had to. Rameau long before him had given theoretical roles to intervals from the overtone series: the octave represented the "proof" for the principle of inversion, and the fifth represented the "proof" for mo- tion in music. This was as much as was needed to theo- rize about music: one interval explained the vertical as- pect, the other the horizontal. While the third completes the major triad, it otherwise plays no theoretical role. Schenker's discussion of the prevalence of the fifth as an interval and relationship appears in Harmony, pp. 26 and 29 respectively. While it may appear unseemly to put Rameau and Schenker together, given Schenker's view of Rameau in "Rameau or Beethoven? Creeping paralysis or spiritual potency in music?", the fact remains that many of Rameau's assumptions, which gained force through con- sistent theoretical use in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, are also prevalent in Schenker's thinking. Not least, the cadential prototype that, according to Rameau, is responsible for motion in music becomes the interval (in reverse order I-V, followed by closure to I) that Schenker will eventually rank in Free Composition as empowered by nature with momentum enough to drive an entire struc- ture. Schenker's essay on Rameau appears in The Master- work in Music: A Yearbook v.3 (1930), ed. William Drabkin (Cambridge, 1997), pp. 1-9. 23See Schenker, Harmony, p. 23. In section sec. 38 on "The Biological Foundation of the Process of Combina- tion" (ibid., pp. 84-85), Schenker also speaks in explicit anthropomorphic terms and states the various ways in which "the tone resembles a human being." 90</page><page sequence="8">fifths above: 1 2 3 4 5 5 4 3 2 1 I V II VI III VII VII III VI II V I Example 5: Fifth-projections compressed into the space of an octave, abbreviated according to the Mysterious Five, and then inverted according to the principle of Inversion; from Schenker, Harmony, p. 37. SUZANNAH CLARK Schenker's Mysterious Five tials make the major triad and the overtone series was necessarily numbered to include the fundamental (see ex. 1).24 The fundamental in ex. 5, however, is no longer included in the count because there are six elements but only five projections. In the formation of the scale, as opposed to the triad, the Mysterious Five abbreviates not the number of tones but the number of times the organic process creates new fundamentals. This is why only the fifths above the fundamental in ex. 5 are numbered.25 It is in this way that the organic aspect of the scale (nature as organic metaphor) is to Schenker's mind equally governed by the Mys- terious Five. After abbreviation has taken place, the "cre- ation" of the scale is still incomplete; the fun- damental plus five projections produce only six of the required seven steps of the major scale. According to Schenker, the missing scale de- gree, the subdominant, has a different origin-- one which, as we shall see, is crucial in deter- mining its tonal character. Schenker perceived the subdominant as a tone and harmony that, rather than emerging from nature, was foreign. It was lent to the scale from a "remote system" (ein zuriickliegendes System) and is "a piece of the past history (die Vergangenheit) of the tonic C."26 It is because this tone had already been put to good use in compositional practice that it needed to be assigned a place in the tonal system. Schenker explained its adoption into the system as a consequence of the artistic (i.e., non-natural) discovery of the principle of inver- sion. What does this artistic principle involve? In this context, inversion does not refer to the position of a chord (as in first and second inversions), but rather to the non-natural, de- scending motion that forms a counterpart to the natural, upward motion of fifth relations. Thus it has purely to do with direction, based as it is on the fact that the overtone series goes upward. The descending direction is therefore non-natural. Schenker was specific about the proper place for this kind of inversion: it occurs as a mirror 24The numbering of the tones in the overtone series has always held a significance. The numbers, interpreted as ratios, are 1:2:3:4:5, which produce 1:2 as the octave, 2:3 as the fifth, 3:4 as the fourth, and 4:5 as the major third. 25Later in his treatise Schenker drew another significance from this way of numbering the fifth projections. In dis- cussing the order of sharps and flats in the circle of fifths, Schenker noted that "there is an exact correspondence between the ordinal number of the rising or descending fifth and the ordinal number of the sharp or flat intro- duced by it." Crucially, "the ordinal number of the rising or descending fifth" refers to the numbering system ac- cording to the Mysterious Five. It is important to note that Schenker himself felt this was a vital enough point to give it emphasis; the italics in the above quotation represent Schenker's Sperrdruck (spaced type)-compare Harmony, p. 78 and Harmonielehre, p. 99. There is one area in which Schenker regretted that the Mysterious Five "fails" to de- fine a threshold (Harmony, p. 204): the ninth chord, al- though made of five notes, is nevertheless not an accept- able self-sufficient chord; rather, it is a suspension. (At this stage, Schenker did, however, believe that the seventh chord, which has only four notes, was a self-sufficient chord formulation or unit-see Harmony, pp. 188-89.) 26Schenker, Harmony, pp. 41 and 38. Jonas footnoted this remark and in his annotation in Harmony (p. 41, n. 24) disagreed with Schenker, adding that "the lower fifth can- not be considered as a representative of another, more remote system." His position on this is elaborated in his Introduction to the Theory of Heinrich Schenker (Einffihrung in die Lehre Heinrich Schenkers): The Nature of the Musical Work of Art, trans. and ed. John Rothgeb (New York, 1982), pp. 21-23. Schenker also seems to think that minor is a past system; it is said to occur en route to Destiny or in an experimental stage in history's move toward tonality: "If art is considered as a final and correct understanding of Nature and if music is seen moving in the direction of art so defined, I would consider the minor mode as a steppingstone, perhaps the ultimate one or nearly so, leading up to the real and most solemn truth of Na- ture, i.e., the major mode. Hence the preference of primi- tive peoples for the minor mode" (Harmony, p. 53). 91</page><page sequence="9">19TH image within a single scale. That is, the fifths CENTURY that are first projected upward from the funda- mental reach a certain height-limited, as al- ready stated, by the Mysterious Five. They then fall back along the same route to the funda- mental. Inversion is thus a kind of backtrack- ing along the line of ascending fifths."7 Schenker considered it an artistic "urge" and argued, fur- thermore, that the return to the fundamental provoked the crucial artistic "urge to apply in- version once more" (ex. 6).28 This additional descending fifth was crucial because it sup- plied the system with the missing tone, the subdominant. In this way, all tones of the scale were obtained, but again only once nature and the artist had combined their efforts-once, that is, the natural upward projection (Entwicklung) had been combined with artistic inversion (In- version). 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. upper fifth tonic sub dominant Example 6: "The Discovery of the Subdomi- nant Fifth as a Consequence of Inversion," Schenker, Harmony, p. 39. The scale system in ex. 6 now appears to begin from the subdominant. Positioned as it is at the bottom-most point, the subdominant takes on the appearance of a root or generating fundamental. Schenker himself addressed this potential complaint by invoking, yet again, the "mysterious postulate of the number five." By arguing that it "seems to be inherent in our subconscious," he felt able to maintain that we would naturally comprehend the order and sig- nificance of the tones as he had revealed them. He insisted that a series of six rising fifths is simply "beyond our comprehension."29 The tonic therefore remains the "beginning" of the series even though it is not at the bottom. The subdominant is prevented from becoming the series' (new) root because it does not generate but rather is generated. A completely diatonic system, however, has still not been reached. Above each tone in the scale there is still a major triad (ex. 6). Return- ing to his anthropomorphic metaphor, Schenker explained that each tone of the scale expresses an "egotism" and insists on "its right to its own perfect fifth and major third."30 Because each tone is at some stage a fundamental, it is the root of its own major triad. These major triads also represent only a portion of nature's fuller overtone series: they are, like the "origi- nal" major triad, limited by abbreviation ac- cording to the Mysterious Five. And the triads in ex. 6 are major because the "egotism" of each fundamental has not yet been reconciled with the diatonic demands of the scale's pre- siding fundamental. This reconciliation is the next stage of artificial modification. In a kind of anthropomorphic cooperation, certain tones must sacrifice their incompatible projections to benefit the "community spirit" of diatonicism:31 if the fundamental key is C major, then D major must become D minor, A major must become A minor, E major must become E minor and B major must sacrifice both its D# and F# to become a diminished triad. One might even be a little surprised here 27This idea will also underscore the bass arpeggiation in Free Composition. Having achieved the dominant by fol- lowing the upward trajectory prescribed by nature, the bass must return to its tonic, which entails inversion. (I will return to this point shortly.) uSchenker, Harmony, p. 38. He argued that it was the artistic use of the subdominant that provoked the need for the subdominant, and he singled out how J. S. Bach used it to anchor the tonic at the outset of compositions, provid- ing three examples from his keyboard repertoire (ibid., pp. 38-39). 29Schenker, Harmony, p. 40. It is interesting in this con- nection to note that, contrary to Schenker's advice, Jonas did set up a system of six rising fifths in his Introduction to the Theory of Heinrich Schenker, p. 21. Although one might assume that Jonas was introducing and explaining Schenker's ideas to the Schenkerian student, he in fact altered two crucial components of Schenker's argument on the derivation of the scale: most fundamentally, he disagreed with Schenker's notion of the Mysterious Five (as discussed above), and secondly, he did not place the subdominant harmony below the tonic. Rather Jonas saw it as an alteration of the F#, which is the sixth fifth-projec- tion. Yet, interestingly, he maintained Schenker's way of counting the fifth-projections: as with ex. 6 above, Jonas's diagram (ibid., p. 21) starts with the dominant labeled "1," and the count stops at five. The subdominant is then la- beled "X." Schenker's Mysterious Five is thus still repre- sented in Jonas's diagram, but not in his prose explana- tion. 30Schenker, Harmony, p. 30. 31abid., p. 40. 92</page><page sequence="10">to find that Schenker seems not to have no- ticed that there are exactly five changes needed (ex. 6). The last artistic fine-tuning-indeed the one that, as Schenker asserted, hides nature's part in the design-is the reshuffling of these harmonies to occupy the more comprehensible space of an octave, in much the same way as the tones of the "original" triad were rearranged to form a closed triad. The result of the reshuf- fling of fifths is the major scale arranged in the successive steps that we recognize as "ours" (ex. 7). A E) -g- * Example 7: Major scale, following the order of successive pitches; from Schenker, Harmony, p. 39. III Once he had completed his intricate and in some sense elegant reconstruction of the origin of the major scale, Schenker shifted his atten- tion to the minor mode, the explanation for which he contended "becomes much easier if artistic intention rather than Nature herself is credited with [its] origin."32 As had many theo- rists before him, he rejected viewing the origin of the minor triad in the proportions 10:12:15 (e- g-b)-namely, the 10th, 12th, and 15th partials in the upper region of the overtone series-- because of their remoteness from the fundamen- tal and because they cannot shed that funda- mental, which is not part of the triad. Interest- ingly, he added that it is important to refrain from seeking a natural origin for everything in tonal music: "Our modern era, however, is more progressive in one respect: it has begun to search for explanations in the phenomena of nature. But we have seen how the joy of this first discovery has seduced modern theorists obsti- nately to insist in deriving everything (e.g., the fourth, the sixth, the seventh, the minor triad, etc.) from Nature."33 Schenker's view, then, was that "the minor mode springs from the originality of the artist, whereas the sources, at least, of the major mode flow, so to speak, spontaneously from Nature."34 Without some kind of natural origin to guide its structure, Schenker was left with the ques- tion: what gives the minor system its tonal principles? A convincing answer was as tricky for Schenker as it had been for all theorists who based their system in nature. His solution-I shall consider its faults shortly-was simply to transfer to the minor mode those principles he identified in the major scale. Three layers are recognizable here: raw nature (in the form of the overtone series), a shaped nature (the major triad and scale), and an imitation of nature (the minor triad and scale). The progression from the overtone series to the major mode to the minor mode is much like the relationship be- tween a nature that was never affected by man (say, a jungle), a landscape with carefully planted trees, and a plastic Christmas tree.35 Significantly, Schenker did not begin his ex- planation of the minor system with a study of the origin of its triad. In other words, he never actually presents a kind of "original" or "'Ur- minor" triad to correspond to the "original" major triad that came from the abbreviated over- tone series. Presumably he wished to avoid the difficulty, offering no opinion as to whether, say, the triad originated as an alteration of ma- jor, as a mirror of the major triad, or through a conflation of two overtone series, which are the three basic views tonal theorists have held. Unlike all before him, Schenker begins his dis- cussion of minor directly with the scale. In Schenker's derivation, the minor mode shares the design and mechanics of the major mode (compare figs. 1 and 2). It therefore con- tains the same number and order of upper and lower fifths-a fundamental, five ascending fifths, and one descending fifth-and follows the same principles of projection, inversion, SUZANNAH CLARK Schenker's Mysterious Five 32Ibid., p. 50. 33Ibid., p. 44. 34Schenker, Harmony, p. 52.

Indeed nothing yet seems to differentiate MUSIC the two scales; Schenker seems right to have remarked that, with regards to these principles, "the major and minor modes behave in abso- lutely identical ways."'36 b e a d g c e a d g c adg c f d g c (subdominant fifth) g c tonic Figure 1: Structure of the major system from Schenker, Harmony, p. 43. g c f b e a c f b e a D f b e a subdominant fifth b e a e a tonic Figure 2: Structure of the minor system with the diminished fifth in the middle from Schenker, Harmony, p. 47. The difference between the modes is in the location of the diminished fifth. It circumscribes the major system, located as it is between the two extremities of the fifth projections (one must imagine them full circle with the dimin- ished fifth between the VII and IV).37 In the case of the minor mode, the diminished fifth inter- rupts the series of perfect fifths midway in the sequence, between II and VI. This Schenker dismissed as unproblematic, the result being, however, that the significance of the dimin- ished fifth is contradictory in the two modes. While, in the major mode, its presence between the seventh and the subdominant (between B? and F in fig. 2) "reveals most clearly the extra- neous character of the subdominant fifth," in the minor mode it "in no way" disturbs the sequence of otherwise perfect fifths.38 Thus, in one case, the interval reinforces the external function of a tone, while in the other it has no effect. Moreover, Schenker expressed no good reason for not also shifting the diminished in- terval to other places in fig. 2. Actually, the only thing preventing Schenker from doing so is that he did not want to intro- duce other modes. If the diminished fifth were shifted about in fig. 2, all of the church modes plus the Locrian would result. As shown in fig. 3, a diminished fifth between the third and fourth upper fifths, degrees VI and III, creates the Dorian mode; between the first and second upper fifths, degrees V and II, the mode is Phrygian; between the fundamental and the subdominant, it is Lydian; between the fourth and fifth upper fifths, degree III and VII, it is Mixolydian; the final possibility, with a dimin- ished fifth between the fundamental and the first upper fifth, the dominant, produces the Locrian. Schenker is unlikely to have found fig. 3 appealing. But it is precisely because he did not offer a theoretical defense for the sudden appearance of the diminished fifth in the middle of the fifths of the minor mode that he fails in this regard to make the minor mode the exclu- sive partner of the major. In other words, there is nothing in his derivation of the two scales that prevents the other modes from fitting into the sequence, especially since a conveniently placed diminished interval "in no way" dis- turbs it. This surely implies that all modes could be said to "behave" like the major mode. 36Schenker, Harmony, p. 46. 37One could, of course, put this the other way around and say that, in the major diatonic system, the location of the diminished fifth determines the limit of the series of per- fect fifths, thereby establishing the Mysterious Five. In that case, when it comes to the minor mode, Schenker presumably would not allow the diminished fifth to be a determining factor, but instead would give more weight to the Mysterious Five. Another student of Schenker, Felix- Eberhard von Cube, did use the diminished fifth as deter- miner and built the layout of ascending and descending fifths of all modes according to it. Von Cube, The Book of the Musical Artwork: An Interpretation of the Musical Theories of Heinrich Schenker, trans. David Neumeyer, George R. Boyd, and Scott Harris (Lewiston, N.Y., 1988), table III, pp. 94-95; for the corresponding descriptions of each the seven systems, see pp. 93-111. Von Cube also made no mention of the Mysterious Five in his book on Schenker's theory but is nevertheless clearly interested in numbers. His numbers are 7 and 12 because of the seven- tone system of tonality and the church modes and the twelve-note system of atonality. He connected the sys- tems with an arithmetic joke (that he himself meant in that spirit): "What is half of 12?" The answer is 7. That is, the Roman numeral VII is the top half of the Roman num- ber XII, i.e., I=WVII (ibid., p. 93).

Thus in the end these principles of artistic ab- breviation and the Mysterious Five are not the exclusive defining stuff of tonality that Schenker had hoped for. Schenker needed another pattern. He found one, which, he argued, predisposed the "Art- ist" to choose the Ionian and Aeolian for tonal purposes and to reject the other church modes. He observed that in each case the mode of the primary triads in major and minor respectively is identical: a major tonic, major dominant, and major subdominant in the Ionian (major) mode, and a minor tonic, minor dominant, and minor subdominant in the Aeolian (minor) mode.39 No other church mode has the same triad type on each of the three primary tones; usually at least one triad is different, as can be seen from ex. 8. The Dorian system (that is, D- D, all white notes on the piano) has a minor tonic and dominant but a major subdominant; the Phrygian (E-E) a minor tonic and subdomi- nant but a diminished dominant; the Lydian Subdominant Tonic Dominant (IV) I) V) In Ionian System (major) major major major In Dorian System major minor minor In Phrygian System minor minor diminished In Lydian System _ diminished major major In Mixolydian System major major minor In Aeolian System (minor) __,_ minor minor minor Example 8: Table of primary harmonies for the church modes from Schenker, Harmony, p. 56. (F-F) a major tonic and dominant but a dimin- ished subdominant; and the Mixolydian (G-G) a major tonic and subdominant but a minor dominant. Schenker was clearly ready to admit that three primary chords were necessary to define the uniqueness of the Ionian and Aeolian modes. Despite the non-natural origin and therefore extraneous character of the subdominant, it became a vital force in defining tonality. The tonic and dominant could not act alone be- cause these triads are also both major in the Lydian mode and both minor in Dorian. In the end, Schenker was forced to admit the impor- tance of the subdominant to the diatonic sys- tem-and the justification for it was that it was useful. The tension between its necessity to diatonicism and its extraneous character in 95 39It might be objected that Schenker failed here to recog- nize the compositional evidence that in minor-mode mu- sic the major dominant is much more common than the minor: how could he claim that composers preferred all the primary triads to be minor in the minor mode when they so seldom exploited that consistency? Schenker, how- ever, addressed this apparent contradiction by taking one example-and acknowledging its rarity-where a domi- nant fugal answer remains minor. As Schenker puts it, J. S. Bach, in his Fugue in D Minor from the Well-Tem- pered Clavier, resisted the commonplace and preserved the minor character of his subject: "He preferred to con- form to Nature by keeping the exposition of his fugue clear of elements which would find their place more ap- propriately in a later phase [of the form]" (Harmony, pp. 50-51). The mere fact that most pieces might do some- thing was never enough to suggest to Schenker that the procedure is the theoretically obvious one. Indeed on this issue, Schenker asserted that theorists are often confused about whether or not the minor scale contains the raised sixth and/or raised seventh. Schenker also addressed the mode of the dominant in minor-keyed compositions in Free Composition, sec. 89.</page><page sequence="13">19TH terms of origin, however, is one that Schenker CENTUCRY would struggle with as his ideas about form evolved. Because of this, Schenker's expos6 on the hidden structure of the triad and scale be- comes an increasingly important means of sepa- rating the structural role of the subdominant from that of the tonic and dominant when it comes to matters of form. IV Schenker used his observations about the derivation of the major-minor system to sub- stantiate his claims about large-scale form in both Harmony (German: 1906) and Free Com- position (German: 1935). Nature and artifice were the measuring stones of hierarchy, a hier- archy that changed between these two books. In Harmony, adhering to nature's course by going from the tonic to the dominant is a stron- ger, more desirable option, but other harmo- nies may easily be substituted. Not so in Free Composition: the tonic and dominant are a structural pair for which no other harmony can be offered as a substitute. In his earlier treatise, thematic sections are still part of the definition of form. Thus when Schenker alluded to harmonic freedom, he had in mind, say, a sonata form whose second theme does not go to the dominant or mediant in the exposition. It was possible to see natural har- monies in any given thematic position replaced by what he called "surrogate keys." At this stage in his thinking, such surrogates occupied an equivalent position in the hierarchy for the purposes of form, as the following two passages indicate: Art would not be free art, however, if it insisted always and under all circumstances on a develop- ment of a composition in major toward the fifth and of a composition in minor toward the third. Both in the progression of steps, as they complete a single thematic complex, and in the succession of keys, as they produce the total of the content, we therefore find deviations from the development toward the fifth or the third. [The layman] speaks of a "sonata form," a "sym- phonic form," etc., as if, e.g., all sonatas were the same merely because their harmonic development often moves from the tonic to the dominant, etc. Instead of recognizing in this a feature of Nature, which cannot be rejected by any genius but can at most be replaced at certain times by modifying sur- rogates; instead of understanding that Nature must penetrate all forms of music-be they sonatas or waltzes, symphonies or potpourris-the layman will mistake the command of Nature for a quality of form!40 From these two quotations, it can be seen that Schenker felt that thirds, seconds, and the sub- dominant may replace or act as surrogates for nature's preferred keys.41 While the tonic and dominant may be stronger, he seems to have believed that these other keys could maintain the form as much as the natural tonic or domi- nant they replace. Indeed, as Schenker argued, only the layman would assume that natural harmonies are required for formal definition. Schenker provided many examples of surro- gate keys. He briefly discussed the first move- ments of Beethoven's Piano Sonata in Bb Major, op. 106, Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, op. 125, and Brahms's Piano Quintet in F Minor, op. 34, all of which have second key areas in VI.42 His most interesting comments are reserved for the second theme area of the first movement of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 in E6 Major, op. 73. It goes to E6 minor (m. 130), G6 major (m. 136), and C6 major (m. 159). E6 minor sounds after four measures of E6 major and is therefore part of a tonic modal mixture. Similarly, the C6-major section is preceded by its minor, spelled enharmonically as B minor (mm. 151- 57). Schenker emphasized the EI-minor and C1- major entries because he observed that, along with G6, the roots of these key areas form a C1- major triad. This unusual set of keys was shown to be an outgrowth of a single triad (chord 1VI), which, he argued, makes the modulatory sec- ond theme seem stable at a more fundamental level.43 But, more than this, the fact that the 40Schenker, Harmony, pp. 248 and 250 (italics mine). Schenker refers to "quality (Eigenschaft) of form." "Qual- ity" is thus not about the "degree of goodness" but about the characteristics of form. 41This view is maintained (but without reference to the naturalness or artificiality of keys) in Charles Rosen, So- nata Forms (rpt. New York, 1988), pp. 354-55. 42Schenker, Harmony, pp. 247-49. 43Schenker, Harmony, p. 246. Tovey, for example, sees the second theme for its contrast to the first and not for its underlying stability. As he put it, these modulations offset 96</page><page sequence="14">underlying triad was major, and that therefore all of these harmonic stations make up one chord, encouraged him to declare with great excitement that it was "an emphatic confirma- tion of Nature" at a higher level. Schenker also discussed large-scale tonal pro- gression by seconds, which he considered arti- ficial but permissible.44 His examples are few and restricted to upward seconds: a modulation from E major to F# minor in Mendelssohn's String Quintet in A Major, op. 18, and a modu- lation from B major to C# minor in No. 14 of Schubert's Wiener Damenlindler, op. 67 (D. 734). He could have added that the second half of this last piece begins in A major, which is a descending second (i.e., the flattened leading tone) below the tonic. By Free Composition things had changed. Schenker would now "insist always and under all circumstances on a development of a com- position in major [and minor] toward the fifth." His theory "explains why the first prolonga- tion takes just this particular [tonic to domi- nant] course and no other."45 There are no sub- stitutes for this trajectory. Has he not done what in Harmony he accused the layman of doing in the quotation above, namely "mistake[n] the command of Nature for a qual- ity of form"?46 Was he not approaching in Free Composition the dogmatism he had scorned in Harmony? Certainly it seems that his position had become less flexible: the number of struc- tural keys had been reduced to two. But this was before Schenker proposed the view that musical form was generated through the process of diminution within a particular harmonic space, specifically the fifth between the tonic and dominant. The mistaken layman referred to in Harmony would have insisted on this fifth occurring between certain thematic locations. To be sure, themes can settle in any key, but he no longer saw themes and keys as players in the definition of form. These "illu- sory" (scheinbar) keys, as Schenker called them in Free Composition, are part of the freedom of prolongation, and they operate within the ex- clusive confines of the tonic and dominant. Simply put, the so-called surrogates contem- plated in Harmony are, in Free Composition, no longer surrogate at all, for now they dis- place rather than replace natural harmonies. How did Schenker settle on the fifth between the tonic and dominant for this harmonic space? What happened to the third member of the primary triads, the subdominant? And how did he exclude the possibility of other background structures; in other words, why did he resist adopting the notion of surrogates? Schenker's new attitude was not the result of a revision of fundamental principles. While the Mysterious Five plays no new role in the shaping of the background structure into a I-V- I bass line with a descending Urlinie from 3, 5, or 8, the principles of abbreviation, fifth projec- tion, and inversion, which, as shown above, were all contained by the Mysterious Five, all contribute to the shaping of the background structure. The first stage is to obtain the funda- mental triad. It is reached in identical fashion to the "Ur-major" triad in Harmony, namely through the abbreviation of the overtone series at the fifth partial in accordance with the Mys- terious Five. This is portrayed in fig. 2 of Free Composition. The background structure in Schenker's fig. 1 represents the composing-out of this triad in minimal counterpoint. Just as the artist arranged the triad in its closed posi- tion, so the vertical sound of nature is here also contained within the range of the human voice. This means that the fifth, which in Harmony was the hidden interval in the creation of the scale and tonal system, is the exposed interval 97 SUZANNAH CLARK Schenker's Mysterious Five a movement that thus far has experienced a "severe mo- notony of key." Tovey, Essays in Musical Analysis, vol. 3 Concertos (London, 1936), p. 85. 44This could cause confusion: if both the second and sev- enth degrees were derived from natural ascending fifths, then why were seconds deemed non-natural? Though for Schenker the second and seventh degrees are indeed found within the natural fifth-progressions of ex. 6, the interval of a step is non-natural, created as it was by the artist's need to put everything within the octave, forcing the scale into steps. By a similar token, the subdominant is non- natural because it was derived from inversion, but the interval of a fifth that it forms with the tonic is natural. There is therefore a difference between the progression and harmony involved. A progression of a fifth is always natural but if the result is the subdominant, then the har- mony is artificial; if a fifth progression results in a domi- nant, then both the progression and harmony are natural. Schenker, however, separates progressions of fifths and thirds (both of which are natural, though to different de- grees) from seconds because "in the series of the first five partials the second has no place" (Harmony, p. 236). 45Schenker, Free Composition, p. 133. 46See the quotation from Harmony above (n. 40).</page><page sequence="15">19TH when it comes to the background structure. In CENTURY the creation of the background, however, there MUSIC was no threat of infinite replication of fifths and therefore no need to appeal to the Mysteri- ous Five. But how did he explain the order of the contents of the background? Why is it shaped I-V-I?47 Here the principle of development and in- version (Entwicklung und Inversion) is crucial. Again both nature and the artist contribute to the shape of the bass arpeggiation, and what is important is the priority of nature's direction over the artist's; the bass arpeggiation must first ascend (Entwicklung), then descend (In- version).48 Three essential criteria can be dis- tinguished, all based on the principles set out in Harmony: (1) the bass must span a fifth, (2) it is necessarily an expression of "the" triad, and (3) the interval must ascend before it de- scends. This means that only the 1 and 5 of the triad are contenders for the structural bass at the uppermost background level, and that they can only be interpreted as tonic and dominant. Schenker made sure there can be no misunder- standing about the subdominant: he forbids a structure to follow I-IV-I even though it too constitutes a fifth-which satisfies (1) above. Additionally, it too could conceivably be seen as the unfolding of a single triad, the tonic interpreted as 5 and the subdominant as 1- which would satisfy (2) above, though obvi- ously this would create a conflict between func- tion and Stufe. But it is the principle of devel- opment and inversion-point (3) above-that excludes the possibility of a subdominant back- ground. I-IV-I is, Schenker asserted, "out of the question" because "the descending direc- tion comes first, in opposition to nature" (ex. 9). He added that it does not constitute a mo- tion, for motion can only be obtained when the direction of an arpeggiation follows nature's lead.49 The fact that the subdominant only be- came part of the diatonic system because the artist incorporated it also remains a decisive factor in Free Composition: "But the subdomi- nant, which most definitely forms part of the diatonic system, cannot have its origin in the overtone series."s50 Schenker's assertion-that the fundamental structure must be an out- growth of the overtone series-therefore pre- cludes a structural role for the subdominant. 4 5 (?) (?) * Example 9: On the lower fifth from Schenker, Free Composition, fig. 6, 4-5. All seconds (supertonic and subtonic) and thirds (mediant and submediant) were excluded on the grounds that they do not form fifths with the tonic (they do not satisfy [1] above). In this way Schenker ensured that the tonic and dominant were the exclusive members of the background structure. While his understanding of the theoretical origin of seconds, thirds, and fifths remained essentially the same between Harmony and Free Composition, his attitude toward key structure had changed. The effect of shifting from the notion of surrogate keys (in Harmony) to illusory keys (in Free Composi- tion) was to alter his conception of the hierar- chy of tonicized scale degrees. Perhaps the best example illustrating this shift is to be found in his two analyses of the first movement of Mozart's Piano Sonata in C Major, K. 545. Schenker treats the subdominant in m. 42 dif- ferently in the two analyses, in keeping with his change in thought: in Der Tonwille (1923) it is interpreted as a surrogate, in Free Compo- sition (1935) as an illusory key.51 47I shall not address here the equally interesting question of the contents of the Urlinie. It will be clear, however, that my examination of the bass has implications in this regard. On the development of Schenker's Urlinie, see Wil- liam Pastille, "The Development of the Ursatz in Schenker's Published Writings," in Trends in Schenkerian Research, ed. Allen Cadwallader (New York, 1987), pp. 71-85. On the idea that the Urlinie need not necessarily exclusively descend, see Charles J. Smith, "Musical Form and Fundamental Structure: An Investigation of Schenker's Formenlehre," Music Analysis 15 (1996), 273 and his graphs passim. 48This clearly has implications for the notion of closure, a subject beyond the immediate scope of this article. 49Schenker, Free Composition, p. 14.

In Harmony, Schenker would un- doubtedly have considered the reappearance of the first theme as the start of the recapitula- tion, and its key, the subdominant, therefore, as a surrogate tonic. He analyzes it in just this way in an essay in Der Tonwille, where he marks the passage in the subdominant as the beginning of the recapitulation. Indeed, his Tonwille analysis shows a "sectional" approach to form, the very approach he would later criti- cize as he turned his mind more and more to the thread of voice leading. When Schenker returned to the Sonata in Free Composition, he interpreted the subdomi- nant as a delay of the onset of the recapitula- tion, which had come to be inextricably associ- ated with a return to the tonic (ex. 10). As though it needed no comment, this tonic ar- rival is also the point at which Schenker ceased to give measure numbers in his graph, accepted as it was as an a priori feature of the recapitula- tion. While in one analysis the tonic is replaced and in the other displaced, both analyses share an absence of a sense of "double return."52 With- out a coincidence of the return of theme and key, it is a matter of emphasis as to whether the return will be of theme and not key, or of key and not theme. Schenker moved toward the latter because of his increasing concern to connect all aspects of musical composition to the origin of the tonal system in the manner first conceived in Harmony. Indeed, in Free Composition, Schenker was rarely concerned with theme, not believing it to be the component that provides music with its motion.53 Only harmony's voice leading can do that, extended as it is in musical space m. 4 12 14 28 I (div.)

As part of the develop- ment, Mozart's subdominant is an expansion- it represents an instance where "motion to- ward the goal encounters obstacles, reverses, disappointments, and involves great distances, detours, expansions, interpolations, and, in short, retardations of all kinds."54 It is repre- sented in his graph in Free Composition as a linear progression that displaces the arrival of the tonic by making it a black note with a stem. The more important tonic is a beamed white note. The subdominant (non-natural) har- mony, F major, is composed out from the note F that is consumed by the (natural) dominant to make a dominant seventh. He interprets this event as a contrapuntal dissonance on an upper level and a consonance on the foreground level, the subdominant as a harmony being therefore entirely a foreground event. What makes this structure unusual, then, is not its subdominant recapitulation (for even to call it such would require taking thematic material into account, something a strict late-practice Schenkerian would not do) but the transformation of the seventh into a consonant harmony at the end of the development, which, Schenker observed, is often marked by a dominant seventh but rarely is the seventh itself prolonged. So, in Schenkerian terms, the extended presence of the subdominant at the foreground level does indeed make this a noteworthy structure. At the background level, however, this movement is not distinguished from any other. The question facing recent analysts has been whether such events ought to be considered extraordinary on the background level as well. 52See James Webster's discussion of the "double return" in "Sonata Form" in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed. Stanley Sadie (London, 1980), vol. 17, pp. 497-503. 53By contrast, Schoenberg believed that: "A motive is some- thing that gives rise to a motion .... one can compare the motive with a driving force."

As we shall see, however, where the trend suggests a potential return to condi- tions occurring in Harmony, none has gone this far. John L. Snyder, for example, in a detailed critique of Schenker's two analyses of K. 545, seeks to distinguish this movement from more predictable ones by positioning its anomalies at "relatively deep levels of structure."s55 Unconvinced by Schenker's imprecise portrayal (in Free Composition) of the retake of 3, he attempts to find a reading that more appropri- ately reflects the tonal and thematic events in the movement.56 The fact that there seems to be no satisfactory candidate for the retake of 3 at the beginning of the second theme leads Snyder to consider a different Urlinie: he ana- lyzes it as a 5-line. Schenker himself provided a precedent for equivocating; he first analyzed it as a kind of 5-line in Der Tonwille,57 which, it must nevertheless be remembered, was writ- ten before his notion of the Urlinie had crystalized. The classic difficulty of finding a proper support for a descent from 5 in the expo- sition, together with this weak return of the tonic, also leads Snyder to reinterpret the move- ment as an uninterrupted structure.58 But what then of the subdominant? Even though he identifies it as an anomaly and expresses an interest in elevating it to a higher level, he only goes so far as to make it a middleground activity. This he achieves by keeping it as a harmony and not reducing it to the seventh of a dominant seventh. Now a har- mony, not a tone, Snyder then interprets it as part of an unfolding to an upper neighbor to 5. While Schenker had absorbed the subdominant into the dominant, Snyder subsumes it under 5. Indeed, despite his criticisms of Schenker, his analysis of the subdominant could hardly, in the end, be closer to Schenker's, for it re- mains part of the development, simply as an inner-voice motion.59 In short, Snyder does not succeed in giving it a new role at the deep middleground level as he hoped to do. Other Schenkerians have also recently ad- dressed subdominant recapitulations. David Beach, for example, analyzes the same struc- ture in Schubert's "Trout" Quintet, D. 667.60 In his analysis, the subdominant recapitulation remains a deviation at the level of design, which he ranks lower than structure.61 The general purpose of Beach's article is to grant anoma- lous events the ability to affect the deep-level structure. Interruption is expected in sonata form; a sonata form without one could there- fore be said to be "affected" by some anoma- lous event. For the "Trout" Quintet, Beach pro- vides two graphs, one with and one without an interruption, the latter representing the "af- fected structure." Curiously, he prefers the former because it "preserves" (his word) the Schenkerian structure. In the end, then, he steps away from allowing such a moment to affect the deep-level structure in order to preserve the norm or status quo. But more than this, the idea that such events should affect something at a deep level, rather than be something at a deep level, is symptomatic of a general reluc- tance on the part of modern analysts to ques- tion the highly restricted contents of Schenker's fundamental structure. Charles J. Smith's recent critique of Schenker's theory of form promises to be an exception: Smith proposes that form and fun- damental structure should be regarded as the same thing, thus eliminating the divide be- 55John L.

Snyder, "Schenker and Mozart's Sonata, K. 545," p. 64. 60David Beach, "Schubert's Experiments with Sonata Form: Formal-Tonal Design versus Underlying Structure," Mu- sic Theory Spectrum 15 (1993), 9-13. 61Beach gives a brief summary of various opinions on what constitutes design and structure. His own use of the terms posits that: underlying structure refers to the "underlying voice leading and harmonic organization of a given work or passage," and tonal design refers to the "layout of keys in the course of a composition, which is an entirely differ- ent matter than tonal structure." "Schubert's Experiments," p. 3. 100</page><page sequence="18">tween design and structure.62 Of interest in this context is his proposed new treatment of what he terms "exotic keys," namely those that are nontonic and nondominant. He argues that a work with a "non-standard formal and harmonic profile deserves a non-standard struc- tural model"63 and makes claims for several background structures for both open and closed forms (the open form-akin to the interrupted structure-is the model for sonata form). Smith is least successful when "exotic keys" occur at points other than that of the division of first sections in open form. He briefly examines K. 545 for its subdominant recapitulation, but does not suggest a new solution for how such a nontonic reprise should be characterized. In fact, he explicitly agrees with Snyder and Beach in their approach to this subdominant, which, as we have seen, resembles Schenker's analysis in Free Composition.64 There surely is no rea- son, however, for treating it differently from other "exotic keys" simply on the grounds of location. So Smith's expansion of the content of Schenker's background structure remains limited because, while he is prepared to allow exotic harmonies to act as dividers, he does not allow them to substitute for the tonic reprise. In other words, he does not use the opportunity that he created to devise a background struc- ture that represents Mozart's use of the sub- dominant despite his aim to represent the "full range of formal harmony available to compos- ers of tonal music."65 It is difficult to tell why Smith gets cold feet. A background structure with a I-VIIIV-I bass could fit his criterion of two equally weighted sections (reflecting thus the spirit of his so-called Type 3 hierarchy66) and would be permissible given that he sug- gests-rightly, I think-that functional har- mony, which is tonic-dominant based and which directs phrase structure, should be re- garded as separable from "formal harmony," which shapes pieces and need not produce func- tional-harmonic successions.67 V Snyder, Beach, and Smith are motivated by the same impulse: the desire to give harmonic events a structural weight relative to that of their surface significance. Snyder wants unusual harmonies to have a deeper-level impact, Beach wants unusual harmonies to affect the back- ground; and yet, as shown above, neither recasts the background. Smith goes furthest, introduc- ing a mechanism for radical revision (nontonic and nondominant harmonies can be structural, and theme can define form); but his revision is not comprehensive. While he asserts that his theory is one where "form and fundamental structure are essentially the same thing,"68 the subdominant recapitulation seems not to merit its own fundamental structure. Why do they take the tonic reprise to be so sacred, especially given that they do not share Schenker's reason- ing for making it so?69 Admittedly, no analyst today would want to agree that the Mysterious Five and its sister principles are a justifiable means of anchoring a theoretical system-in- deed it must be seen as another example of that theoretical "malady." At the same time, how- ever, few analysts would disagree with the idea that more structural space should be assigned to unusual harmonies, should their use in a given piece so warrant. To question the underpinning of the system, on the one hand, and the levels on which an event functions, on the other, is to stage a confrontation against the background structure from both sides-leaving it intact be- comes impossible. Why, then, the reluctance on the part of Schenkerians to complete the task? When Schenker declared the I-V-I arpeggiation SUZANNAH CLARK Schenker's Mysterious Five 62Smith, "Schenker's Formenlehre," p. 270. 63Ibid., p. 264. 64Smith writes that Snyder and Beach "both grapple fairly successfully with forms of this sort" ("Schenker's Formenlehre," p. 292, n. 114). 65Smith, "Schenker's Formenlehre, " p. 279. As noted, how- ever, there are structures not represented in Smith's ar- ticle. 66The three types are interrupted structures. Type 1 pre- sents the first descent as subordinate to the second, Type 2 presents the second descent as subordinate to the first, and Type 3 presents both descents as equal. Charles J.

In finding his reasoning dubious, but neverthe- less adhering to the background as the ultimate structure, Schenker's followers have made it "more" sacred-they have substituted the ex- plicable for the inexplicable, or the sacred for the mysterious. Indeed, Schenker's system is what it is be- cause of its primary principles: the shape of the background and the manner in which it regu- lates musical Auskomponierung are, as we have seen, entirely based on the principles first out- lined in Harmony. The supremacy of tonic and dominant was, for Schenker, never in question, including when in Harmony they were the most powerful elements but could be replaced. By Free Composition, Schenker had managed to match his notion of form to his ideas on the derivation of tonality. The system was then comprehensive and consistent-abbreviation, development and inversion, and the Mysteri- ous Five were revealed to have shaped that helpful hint, the overtone series, into a sophis- ticated musical system. Most important, Schenker had achieved what no other theorist had managed to achieve. He had traced the thread that connected and governed all the mu- sical elements: the tone, the triad, the scale, harmonic progression, musical form, the Ursatz. As he saw it, the secret to his success was Of his discovery of the Mysterious Five.
