Zool., 40:833-834 (2000) Introduction to the Symposium: Animal Consciousness: Historical, Theoretical, and Empirical Perspectives1 Matt Cartmill2 and Irene Lofstrom Department of Biological Anthropology and Anatomy, Box 3170, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710 As materialists and Darwinians, scien? tists are compelled to recognize our close animal relatives as being in effect deformed human beings, differing from us only in certain genetic rearrangements that make them grow up funny-looking and stupid. Since our closest relatives have brains, bod? ies, and behavior that correspond to our own in many ways, it seems reasonable to assume as a null hypothesis that they prob? ably have minds and experiences something like ours. Yet many scientists do not see the world in these terms. Natural scientists in general, and biologists in particular, often adopt some version of the Cartesian presumption that nonhuman animals are insensate ma- chines made of meat. Although our close animal relatives are literally anthropomor- phic?that is, human-shaped?scientists are trained to regard psychic anthropomor- phism as a serious error. It is axiomatic in the psychology lab that all animals are mindless unless proven otherwise. The image of animals as insensate mech? anisms is not something that today's sci? entists and philosophers have absorbed from the contemporary cultural back? ground. Artistic and literary images of an? imals, as well as the assumptions and opin- ions of people whose jobs involve daily in? teraction with animals, support the com- mon-sense belief that certain animals have emotions, intentions, and experiences something like ours. Moralists have argued with increasing frequency in recent years that the facts of evolutionary biology and the evident psychological similarities be- 1 From the Symposium Animal Consciousness: His? torical, Theoretical, and Empirical Perspectives pre? sented at the Annual Meeting of the Society for Inte? grative and Comparative Biology, 6-10 January 1999, at Denver, Colorado. 2 E-mail: matt_cartmill@baa.mc.duke.edu tween people and other animals entail some version of the doctrine of animal rights. The contrary assumption?Morgan's Canon?is largely restricted to scientists and post-Car- tesian philosophers. Why does the proposition that dogs feel pain when you kick them and disappoint- ment when you refuse to play ball with them seem dangerously anthropomorphic to scientists and transparently self-evident to just about everybody else? As humanistic critics of science have pointed out, the ca- nonical scientific position reflects certain presumptions of the scientific method itself, which denies evidential status to subjective experiences, and thus makes it awkward to ask questions about them. The canonical position also expresses the interests of re? searchers who find it inconvenient to ask moral questions about experimental ani? mals. But the canonical position is also grounded in empirical findings. The neu- rology and behavior of most animals, in? cluding the lower vertebrates, indicate that they do not have mental lives of any re- motely human sort. These facts affirm our conviction that these matters are susceptible to empirical as well as theoretical inquiry. In recent years, the issue of animal awareness has assumed a central position in several arenas of de- bate. Many biologists have begun posing and testing hypotheses concerning animal experience and cognition. Experimental psychologists have demonstrated that a wide range of warm-blooded vertebrates, from parrots to bonobos, evince surprising antecedents of human linguistic capacities. Postulates, arguments, and conjectures con? cerning animal sentience (or the lack of it) play important roles in contemporary phi- losophies of mind and of morals.

Lostrom correlates is the focus of widespread dis? cussion in the literatures of philosophy, psychology, cognitive and computer sci? ence, and evolutionary biology. The following papers are contributions to a symposium on these topics presented at the 1999 meetings of the Society for Inte? grative and Comparative Biology. This in? terdisciplinary symposium brought together scientists, philosophers, and historians to discuss the issue of animal consciousness. Its participants, chosen to represent all the facets of the many-sided debates surround? ing this issue, include many of the most dis? tinguished and important?and in some cases controversial?investigators in their respective fields. Irene Pepperberg and Sue Savage-Rumbaugh are the leading experi? mental researchers into the linguistic capac- ities of nonhuman animals. Derek Bicker- ton is a major figure in the study of lan? guage evolution and an important critic of animal-language experiments. John Stad- don is a distinguished experimentalist and historian and a thoughtful exponent of the behaviorist school of comparative psychol- ogy. Marian Dawkins is one of the world's foremost students of animal behavior, and has also written extensively on the subject of animal welfare. Robert Seyfarth and Do? rothy Cheney are the leading students of cognition in wild, free-ranging nonhuman primates. Harriet Ritvo and William Kimler are prominent historians of the relationships between scientific and other beliefs about animals and their cultural, social, and po- litical context. Finally, we were fortunate enough to have as our discussant Donald Griffin, whose books and articles have pro? vided perhaps the most important single im- petus behind the revival of scientific inter? est in animal mentation. We are grateful to all these men and women for their participation in and con? tributions to the symposium, and to the U.S. National Science Foundation and the Soci? ety for Integrative and Comparative Biolo? gy for providing the funding that made this gathering possible. We hope that the pro? ceedings of this meeting will contribute to interdisciplinary dialogue and help to stim? ulate fruitful inquiry into these uniquely important and difficult questions.</page></plain_text>
