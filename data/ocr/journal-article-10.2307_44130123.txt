Since early May a large-scale version of Hiram Powers' The Greek Slave has assumed command of Marcel Breuer's awn- ing, beckoning to Madison Avenue in a lady-liberty analogy to "your tired, your poor, your homeless," perhaps punning on "your masses yearning to be free." 200 Years of American Sculpture is the first major study of the history of American sculpture. It reveals this sculpture's revolu- tion and evolution as a particularly potent medium for a particularly psychological culture's interpretation. Art, when inter- preted as reflection and warning system, reiterates a belief in parallels between the evolution of historical consciousness and consciousness in general. The belief that "masterpieces are not single and solitary births; they are the outcome of many years of thinking in common, of thinking by the body of the people, so that the experience of the mass is behind the single voice, " to quote Virginia Woolf. The book blasts the show like an amplifier would a guitar. Its look is sumptuous but the problems of showing a three-dimensional subject within a two-dimensional framework are still very evident with so few secondr and third-view shots. It is divided into seven ma- jor sections of study by essay, chronological- ly organized to trace the major phases of growth as follows: "Aboriginal Art" by Nor- man Feder; "Images of a Nation in Wood, Marble and Bronze: American Sculpture from 1776 to 1900" by Wayne Craven; "The Innocent Eye: American Folk Sculpture" by Tom Armstrong; "Statues to Sculpture: From the Nineties to the Thirties" by Daniel Robbins; "Magician's Game: Decades of Transformation, 1930-1950" by Rosalind Krauss; "Two Decades of American Sculpture: A Survey" by Barbara Haskell; "Shared Space: Contemporary Sculpture and Its Environment" by Marcia Tucker. Throughout, the book is getting at something. Part of this something has something to do with the question: is "a rose is a rose is a rose" a rose? The first essay in- cludes illustrations of Karok, Yurok, and 92</page><page sequence="2">Hupa spoons; the last essay includes an il- lustration of Claes Oldenburg's Bedroom Ensemble. The intentions of the makers of the spoons and the maker of the bedroom were different, yet they are both in our public museums and both in a book entitled 200 Years of American Sculpture. The spoons were made to be used, not displayed; the bedroom to be displayed, not used. Spoon, not spoonness, versus bedroomness, not bedroom. Is "a rose is a rose is a rose" a rose if spoons not intended as art become art and bedrooms are intended as art? But the book is speaking to something beyond even roses with its 200-year span from spoon to bedroomness. It is archetypes, anthro- pological and psychological. Judged within art-historical terms, the anthropological ex- ample of spoon would be termed a vertical and the psychological example of bedroom a horizontal. Slowly but surely, unconsciously then consciously, this transition from ver- tical to horizontal becomes the book's most interesting thrust. A thrust, at first subliminal, that develops with a close trac- ing of the book, especially its approach to artists' recognition of the unconscious - and the unconscious of the artist. Before this can be shown, a quick follow -through of the first four essays is necessary. American "aborigine" (Indian) art as a whole is of greater relevance to ethnology than to an investigation of sculpture. American sculpture of the 18 th and half of the 19th century splits into two: 1. folk art. Idiosyncratically American - residuals of Puritanism (a seductive section of the book); 2. the "ideal" or portrait statues in marble (busts and statues of Washington in Homeric poses) - equated to Europeanism. Marble gives way to bronze. Most sculpture remains academic but the "Wild West" cowboy and Indian sculptures of Frederick Remington and Charles Russell exude the spontaneity of folk art, with technical sophistication. By 1893, American sculpture "ranks" with European - the year of the Chicago Exposition. Beaux-Arts prevails and predominates until the Armory Show of 1913. The Armory Show is of greater academic than actual importance. Between 1900 and 1930 most American sculpture re- mains representative of the human thinker rather than of thought. Processes advance and human situations diversify (labor movements, immigration, etc.), but slowly the "aesthetics of materials" takes precedence over the rhetoric of humanism. Direct carving - subtractive rather than ad- ditive form - becomes dominant, as in the work of William Zorach and Robert Laurent. Daniel Robbins' statements on these two artists are especially interesting and lead to a reinvestigation of primitive sculpture. By the 1920s primitivism and ex- otica blend within the modernistic styliza- tions of Art Deco. Elie Nadelman is perhaps a kind of starting point for "modern American sculpture. " In the last three essays of the book the theme of the unconscious within the dynamic relationship between artist and culture begins to unfold boldly, and proud- ly. The years 1929 to 1949 are a time of great expansion in technique. Welding, free standing, and motion. Krauss emphasizes David Smith, Alexander Calder, and Joseph Cornell as giants of this expansion and exploration - through association and projection - of the unconscious. Says Krauss, "Innovations in technique clearly are symptoms of some kind of shift in con- sciousness. In that sense, technical invention does function as an early-warning system to alert us to the probability that a new kind of content is forcing, or permitting, or sug- gesting, new processes by which to express it." She refers to David Smith's totem series - border lines between human figure and abstract sign - as human figures in terms of the psychic wars within their bodies. Discontinuity between views is the crucial issue. Krauss includes Freud's view of totemism as "a widespread and culturally significant admission of particular un- conscious desires, acknowledged by the very system used to prohibit their fulfillment." Much later Tucker quotes Christian Norberg-Schultz, "The vertical . . . has always been considered the sacred dimen- sion of space. It represents a 'path' towards a reality which may be 'higher' or 'lower' than daily life." One of the high points of the book is the profile as well as the frontal il- lustration of Smith's Blackburn: Song of an Irish Blacksmith (1949-50). Another is Louise Bourgeois' The Blind Leading the Blind ( 1949), of which Krauss says, "And the nature of this encounter was that kind of projection of the Unconscious onto the space of the real that formed the model of sur- reality." Probably Bourgeois was again sum- moning the people she missed: the pole-like structures referring to presences and the shadows a more complicated reference to person and encounter. Nevelson, Kiesler, Noguchi, and Newman are just a few more of the artists she describes as exploring associations with the elements of the "real" world. An approach, of course, in opposi- tion to the Constructivist desire to project each aspect of a three-dimensional object as a redundant expression of a central theme (not innately "American"). Tucker and Haskell both equate the Abstract Expressionism of the '50s to an American sensibility - a shaking off of Euro- pean ties - rebellion of art and culture against the revered Renaissance. Both speak of sculpture's commitment to itself instead of its vehicular properties. Tucker explains the change from direct carving at resistant mass in a catchy way - the sculptor is no longer emancipator of figures trapped in blocks. Their focuses are different although they both encompass an enormous number of artists (often overlapping). Haskell's is on the work of Bell, Bladen, Chamberlain, De Maria, di Suvero, Flavin, Grosvenor, Hesse, Judd, Kelly, LeWitt, Mason, Oldenburg, Price, Rauschenberg, Samaras, Segal, Serra, Wiley, and Wilmarth; Tucker's is on Andre, Artschwager, Heizer, Irwin, Johns, Kienholz, Le Va, Morris, Nauman, Tony Smith, Smithson, Sonnier, Stone, Sugar- man, Truitt, Tuttle, Voulkos, and Wester- mann. It is clear both curators experience the raw and powerful energies of these works. So much so that they believe the '60s and '70s to be a high moment for pure art. Furthermore, each provides an unforget- table service in her explanations, Haskell by relating the reductive forms of the early minimalist-identified sculptors to Gestalt psychology, Tucker by dividing existential space into three elements: 1. place (or center); 2. path (or direction)' 3. domain (area). Tucker goes further in this definition of place and path by citing six of the associated levels of operations: 1. hand (Johns' Ale Cans); 2. furniture (Oldenburg's Bedroom Ensemble ); 3. house; 4. urban (Heizer's Uninhabitable City ); 5. landscape (De Maria's earth-filled Dirt Room); 6. geography (Smithson's Non-Site bins). Haskell and Tucker both refer to the ma- jor change between the '50s and the '60s as being a change from verticality to horizon- tally. Haskell feels that verticality was abandoned because of the artist's avoidance of anthropomorphic allusions in search of a much more transitory quality that is not in- volved in structured, predetermined rela- tionships. She feels that artists idealize con- temporary landscape, in particular its potential for epic grandeur. Tucker sees this change in the evolution of sculpture from art of mass to art of space. There is indeed much evidence beyond hearsay to back up this concept. The vocabulary has changed, in some places blatantly. From sculpture to piece, from studio to arena.

The terms inside and outside are be- ing pushed to outsideinside and insideout- side with so many geographical works. Works such as Smithson's Non-Site bins, which he calls "three-dimensional maps." These, contain rocks from the original site at Palisades-Edgewater, New Jersey, and are contained within a horizontal grid scheme. Carl Andre: "My idea of a piece of sculpture is a road . . . we don't have a single point of view for a road at all, except a moving one, moving along it." Could it be, then, that the shadows of Louise Bourgeois' The Blind Leading the Blind were a 1949 warning, the elongated diagonal shadows a kind of multiple Andre which keep moving along the path of the floor? Horizontality, then, is a highly probable concept. Certainly not a constant, since some art will always de- pend on the human reference. Such a reference, unless the human body changes shape or direction, will always fit somewhere between points of verticality. This is true, for example, of Samaras' mirrored Corridor (1967), happenings, and video pieces. In fact, if examined by this new system of operational space, these works are clearly quite academic in direction. Horizontality as a concept is the kind of fact that feeds the art-as-warning-system. As warning it implies a yearning: a complex kind of nostalgia. Ą search for primordial proof of existence - connections to the metaphysical or phenomenal world - re- iteration of the earth's surfaces. "The ex- perience of the mass behind the single voice." Oldenburg once proposed an exhibi- tion with Manhattan as the work of art. INGRID SISCHY Ingrid Sischy.an artist, is Associate Editor of PCN.</page></plain_text>
