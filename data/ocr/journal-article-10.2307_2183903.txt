<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS EXPLANATION AND UNDERSTANDING. By GEORG HENRIK VON WRIGHT. Ithaca, Cornell University Press, 1971. PP. xvii, 230. $7.50. The title of this new book by Professor von Wright derives from a distinction, attributed to the nineteenth-century German historian J. G. Droysen, between Erkldren and Verstehen. Erkldren ("explanation"), it was thought, is a method appropriate to the study of nature, while Verstehen ("understanding") is deemed to be the suitable method for the study of man. We explain-characteristically in terms of causes -phenomena of nature, and we understand-characteristically in terms of intentions, reasons, and the like-actions of human agents. Thus, the title of this volume encapsulates von Wright's principal thesis that there is a basic methodological split between physical science and the science of man. This form of methodological dualism has been on the upswing in the recent Anglo-American philosophy, and with this important study von Wright comes out squarely on the side of the dualists in their continuing debate with the monists who hold the view that at most the subject matter, not the methodology, separates the two domains of science. Those who know von Wright's previous works need not be told that this is a very good book packed with much original material; it also contains illuminating reinterpretations of some familiar theories and arguments. The range of topics treated includes causation, action, verification of nomic statements, practical inference and its use in the explanation of action, and the structure of explanation in history. Although von Wright's treatment of these topics is structured by his larger views on scientific method, at the same time it is full of insightful details which are certain to engage philosophical reflection regardless of one's attitude toward his larger pictures. There are four chapters. Chapter I delineates the historical background of the current controversy between the monists and the dualists. Von Wright traces monism to the "galilean tradition," whose contemporary embodiment is the well-articulated scientific methodology of logical positivism-in particular, the nomic-sub- sumptive theory of explanation that all events are to be explained by subsumption under general (causal) laws. It is one of von Wright's 380</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS major aims to give coherence and unity to the theory of scientific method in the "Aristotelian tradition" by developing a model of explanation for human actions which will offer a definite alternative to the nomic-subsumptive model. Chapters 2 and 3 are devoted respectively to causality and teleology, and form the core of the book; I shall discuss below their contents in some detail. Chapter 4 is devoted to the analysis of explanations in history and social science in terms of the models expounded in the preceding two chapters. Let us now turn to the important middle chapters. The "condition- ship relations"-the relations of one condition being necessary, or sufficient, for another-play a central role in von Wright's analysis of causal concepts. These relations are explained partly in terms of a formalism he develops, which is a propositional logic augmented with tense-logical and modal operators, and partly in terms of topo- logical-tree representations of the development of causally possible "Tractatus worlds" through discrete temporal stages. The formalism is not extensively developed or used here (see, however, von Wright's "On the Logic and Epistemology of the Causal Relations" delivered at the Bucharest meetings of the International Congress of Logic, Methodology, and Philosophy of Science, I97I). The tree representa- tion of causal systems is an interesting analytical apparatus with considerable heuristic value; it enables von Wright to explain necessity, sufficiency, and related concepts in a very intuitive manner, and with its help some hitherto unnoticed aspects of these concepts are brought to light. The relations of necessity and sufficiency are construed as carrying the force of "nomic necessity" adequate to support counterfactuals. To say "p is necessary for q" is, in part, to say "If p had not been realized on the occasion (where it was actually realized), then q would not have been realized"; and similarly for "p is sufficient for q." And to say "p is a cause of q" is to say, in part at least, "p is a sufficient or necessary condition of q." Note that "p," "q," ... stand for repeatedly instantiable "generic states," not particular datable instantiations thereof (individual states and events). As von Wright sees it, there are two important problems that must be faced at this point. The first is "the problem of asymmetry"; under von Wright's definitions, and also under the usual explanation of these relations, the relation "p is necessary or sufficient for q" is symmetric, whereas the causal relation is asymmetric. We must, therefore, go beyond necessity and sufficiency to provide for the causal 381</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS asymmetry. The second problem concerns the epistemology of nomic necessity: How do we confirm, on the basis of observation of regular sequences of instances of p and of q, the nomic statement that p is sufficient or necessary for q-that if p were to realize, q would also realize, or if p had not been realized, q too would not have? Von Wright seeks solutions to these problems in his "actionist" or "experimentalist" concept of causation, which is one of the most interesting-and potentially controversial-things in the book. It is an attempt to explain causation in terms of action, active interference with nature on the part of an agent. Briefly, the actionist account comes to this: "p is a cause relative to q, and q an effect relative to p, if and only if by doing p we could bring about q or by suppressing p we could remove q or prevent it from happening" (p. 70). The idea of explaining causation in terms of human action or manip- ulation, an "anthropomorphic" approach to causality, is of course not new (see, for example, D. Gasking, "Causation and Recipes," Mind, 64 [I955]). But it is fair to say that von Wright has given us here the most detailed and systematic statement of this approach; and his defense of it is plausible and ingenious, if not wholly convincing. Not wholly convincing for various reasons, some of which I shall now mention. First, there is the question whether the concept of bringing about q by doing p itself must be analyzed by the use of the concept of causa- tion. As von Wright points out, the question which concept is more basic would be difficult to answer. But it seems to me that the action concept is not something that should be taken as a primitive. This is plausible when it is realized that, as Alvin Goldman has discussed in exhaustive detail (in A Theory of Human Action [Englewood Cliffs, 1970], ch. 2), no unitary relation corresponds to the expression "brings about q by doing p." Take one of the stock examples in the current action theory: I signal for a turn by extending my left arm. This fits von Wright's formula: by doing p (where p is my left arm being extended) I bring about q (where q is the state of affairs that a signal for a turn is made). Clearly, however, the arm being extended is not a cause of a signal being made; what makes a case of the former (amount to) a case of the latter is not some causal link but rather the existence of appropriate rules and conventions about signaling. To cite two more noncausal cases of "bringing about": by jumping six feet I outjump George, and by forgetting to mail a letter I break a promise. These examples show not only that von Wright's actionist account 382</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS of causation is too broad, but also, I think, that the concept "bringing about q by doing p" is in need of analysis by a systematic classification of the distinct varieties of cases falling under it. And it seems not unlikely that such a project would have to make use of causal concepts. How does the actionist account of causation help solve the problem of asymmetry? As von Wright is aware, the account as stated above does not quite do it; for the relation "can bring about q by doing p" isn't asymmetric. Von Wright describes a device (which seems physical- ly impossible) consisting of two buttons so connected that whenever one button is depressed the other simultaneously sinks, and conversely. This example, which is cited along with the alleged existence of retroactive causation as reasons against a temporal account of the causal asymmetry, shows that there are cases of generic states p and q such that a given instance of p is a cause of a given instance of q while another instance of q is a cause of another instance of p. Thus, the problem of asymmetry arises only for the definition of causal relations for individual states and events, not for generic ones. It is puzzling, therefore, that von Wright never explicitly formulates a definition of the causal relation for individual states, and as a result it is not completely clear exactly how the actionist concept of causation is supposed to yield the desired asymmetry. What von Wright says about cases like the two-button device is this: "In the cases when I bring about q by doing p, p is the cause and not q; and in the cases when I bring about p by doing q, q is the cause and not p" (p. 75). But this suggests that in order to impose a causal direction in cases of simultaneous causation human agency must in fact be involved; and this seems to contradict von Wright's remark that "[the actionist account] does not mean that whenever a cause can be truly said to operate some agent is involved. Causation operates throughout the universe- also in spatial and temporal regions forever inaccessible to man" (p. 73). It would seem that the only recourse here is to deny the exis- tence of simultaneous causation; and in response to another objection von Wright himself says that he is uncertain about the existence of simultaneous causal relations (p. 76). Now, apart from the fact that this admission takes away one of the two reasons von Wright gives in this book against the temporal account of causal asymmetry, it is easily seen that the difficulty is not limited to simultaneous causation. For, given von Wright's willingness to allow retroactive causation, the same indeterminacy of causal direction would beset temporally successive causal relations in the absence of actual involvement of human agency-unless tem- 383</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS poral asymmetry is crucially utilized in some way. But von Wright gives us no clue as to what role, if any, temporal asymmetry is to play within his scheme. Now, von Wright's response to this could make use of his concept of basic action. For cases of simultaneous causation, he says that perhaps the causal direction could be disambiguated only if either doing p or doing q is a basic action-that is, an action that an agent does, "not by doing something else, but simpliciter" (p. 68). The idea seems to be that if, say, doing p is a basic action, then when I bring about q by doing p, I cannot also bring about p by doing q, and this gives us the desired asymmetry. And perhaps the idea can also be applied to temporally successive causal relations (in fact, von Wright makes crucial use of basic actions in his discussion of retroactive causation). Let me briefly enumerate my reasons for thinking this is not a satis- factory solution. First, the recourse to basic actions would enormously limit the range of application of the actionist concept of causation. Second, whether or not a given type of action is basic is relative to a person at a time; for example, wiggling one's ears may be a basic action to a person at one time but not to the same person at another time or to another person at any time. And this seems to introduce a pernicious sort of relativity into the causal relation. Third, it is dubious that the recourse to basic actions would enable us to dispense with actual involvement of agency. Strictly speaking, the property of being a basic action belongs to individual actions, not to generic actions; a person who can wiggle his ears as a basic action can also wiggle them by moving them with his hands. So it is not enough to say that an instance of p is a cause of an instance of q if we could bring about q by doing p and doing p is a basic action; we must say that this particular instance of doing p is a basic action, and this brings human agency back into causation. Von Wright's approach could of course work for those cases of generic states p and q where we can always bring about q by doing p but the converse is never the case. But a host of unanswered questions arise. What sort of agents does "we" in this formulation refer to? Human beings with characteristic human abilities and powers? Could God reverse the order and bring about p by doing q? Or does this order depend solely on the intrinsic nature of the states p and q ? How does the directionality of time affect it? We now turn to von Wright's treatment of action and explanation of action. What is explained in a teleological explanation, according to von Wright, is behavior qua action, not behavior qua a series of 384</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS bodily movements. Consider my opening the window. This action has two aspects, inner and outer. The inner aspect consists in the "intentionality" of the action, while the outer aspect is in turn analyzed into the immediate and the remote. The immediate outer aspect consists in the muscular activities involved; the remote aspect includes any event or state which is the effect of the muscular activities-for example, the turning of the handle, the window's being open, and the movement of the air molecules. One of the states comprising the remote aspect-namely, the window's being open-is the result of the action; the result of an action is "intrinsically (conceptually, logically) connected with the action itself" in the sense that "unless it materializes the action has, by definition, not been performed (com- pleted)" (pp. 87-88). Thus, if the window is not open, then logically I cannot have performed the action of opening the window. The talk of "logical" or "conceptual" connection between actions and events is baffling. What I find more baffling is von Wright's espousal of Miss Anscombe's view (shared notably by Donald Davidson) on action individuation. I move my hand thereby opening the window thereby cooling the room. According to the Davidson- Anscombe view, my moving my hand, my opening the window, and my cooling the room are one and the same action differently described. But these actions have different "results" in von Wright's sense; the moving of my hand is the result of the first but not of the second or the third; the window being open is the result of the second but not of the first or the third; and so on. Von Wright is of course aware of this; his reply is that the result of an action is relative to the chosen description-that we must speak of the result of an action "under a description." I do not find this notion of "under a description" either clear or ultimately useful, but in any case it should be noticed that the same sort of relativity or description-dependency besets von Wright's notion of basic action (and the relativity may ultimately taint von Wright's actionist account of causation). My moving my hand could be a basic action, but my opening the window is not, since I did this by moving my hand. But under the Anscombe-Davidson view these are one action, only differently described. I am not at all certain that a coherent notion of basic action can be developed within the Anscombe-Davidson scheme; but as far as I can see there is no really compelling reason within von Wright's theory of action to adopt this scheme of action individuation. (In fact, in Norm and Action [London, i963], pp. 40-41, von Wright appears to reject this scheme.) 385</page><page sequence="7">BOOK REVIEWS Von Wright's model of teleological explanation is a schema of practical inference which he calls "PI". It is this: (PI) A intends to bring about p. A considers that he cannot bring about p unless he does a. Therefore A sets himself to do a. Is this inference schema logically valid? Various considerations are advanced, and certain refinements and alterations in (PI) are sug- gested, although the only major refinement we need to take note of here is the addition of "unless A is prevented" to the conclusion. Von Wright claims that the verification of the conclusion of (PI) and that of its premises are interdependent. In order to verify "A sets himself to do a" we must do more than make observations of the bodily motions A goes through; we must establish that A's behavior is "aiming" at doing a -that is, we must establish an appropriate intention and cognition in A. And this shifts the locus of verification from the conclusion to the premises. Von -Wright also argues that the verification of the premises also involves our ability to ascribe to the agent an item of intentional behavior under the description used in the premises. I am not certain exactly what von Wright concludes from this about the logical validity of (PI); he says that "the premises of a practical inference do not with logical necessity entail behavior .... It is only when action is already there and a practical argument is constructed to explain or justify it that we have a logically conclusive argument" (p. I I 7). In any case, von Wright takes the verificational inter- dependence of the premises and conclusion of (PI) as vindicating the "Logical Connection Argument," popularized by A. I. Melden, to the effect that wants, desires, intentions, and the like cannot be "Humean causes" of behavior (or action) because they are "logically connected" with it, whereas a Humean cause must be "logically independent" of its effect. Let me now make some remarks about (PI) as a model of explana- tion. First, there is the following nontrivial counterexample (due to Nicholas Sturgeon): -I am going to New York for a job interview, and since I will be in the city in any case I decide to take in an opera at the Met. Thus, we have the following: I intend to attend an opera at the Met. I consider that unless I go to New York I shall not be able to attend an opera at the Met. Therefore I set myself to go to New York. 386</page><page sequence="8">BOOK REVIEWS But surely the premises of this practical inference do not explain why I am setting out on my trip; what explains it is my intention to have the job interview and its associated belief. The causalist would probably conclude that the reason this inference fails as an explanation is precisely the absence of an appropriate causal link between the inten- tion-belief complex in the premise set and the action given by the conclusion. It is an interesting question how the teleologist will respond to this; perhaps a modification of (PI) on the basis of a hierarchical ordering of intentions might be a natural direction in which to explore for a solution. We often do things for an end even when we do not consider them as "necessary conditions" for realizing that end. For example, I take a bus to go to my office; but of course I know that the same end can be attained by walking, hitching a ride, and so on. Von Wright's reply is that here we can teleologically explain only why I either took the bus or hitched a ride or ..., but not why I took the bus. This seems to indicate a rather restricted scope within which (PI) can be used as an explanatory device. The restricted nature of (PI) becomes more apparent when we consider the fact that it is formulated exclusively in terms of intentions, not in terms of such other psychological factors as wants, desires, valences, and so forth. And despite von Wright's assertions to the contrary, it is not clear that all the major theses concerning (PI) would be unaffected if "intention" and "intend" are systematically replaced by "want," "desire," and their cognates. For example, it seems that nothing like logical validity could even remotely be claimed for (PI) if "intend" is replaced by "want" or "desire." There are conflicting wants and desires, but not conflicting intentions; desires and wants admit of degrees and gradations, but intentions do not in any obvious sense. This is why von Wright's treatment of explanation of action in terms of intention can be so neat and elegant. But it also shows its limited scope. If, as von Wright claims, intention is so intimately connected with action that the link is conceptual or logical, then maybe this is so because intention is now so far removed from wants, desires, and reasons; but unless we understand how desires and wants issue in an intention to do an act, we may not have gone very far in understanding why a person acts as he does. One feels that intention is "logically too close" to action to explain it. If the verification of "A sets himself to do a" logically presupposes the verifica- tion of the alleged explanatory premises, what explanatory insight do we gain when these premises are again adduced as explaining it? 387</page><page sequence="9">BOOK REVIEWS These questions, however, involve large issues, and I can only urge the reader to scrutinize for himself von Wright's resourceful defense of (PI) as a model of understanding human actions. I have concentrated on those points which appeared to me to be both central and controversial. Let me conclude by reiterating that there is much in this book that is valuable, original, and stimulating. No one interested in causation, explanation, or action can afford to overlook it. Von Wright's arguments may not convince everyone, but then the controversy between the causalists and teleologists may be, as von Wright puts it, "removed from the possibility both of reconciliation and of refutation-even, in a sense, removed from truth .... [The choice between the two positions] is 'existential.' It is a choice of a point of view which cannot be further grounded" (P. 32). JAEGWON KIM The University of Michigan</page></plain_text>
