<plain_text><page sequence="1">SHELLEY'S DRAFT OF 'MONT BLANC' AND THE CONFLICT OF 'FAITH' ONE of the several puzzling moments of Shelley's 'Mont Blanc' occurs in the poem's third verse paragraph. Surveying a 'desart' (1. 67)1 of glacial ruin in which 'ice and rock' (1. 63) are 'hideously . . . heaped around' (11. 69-70), Shelley enquires as to the scene's cause. He proposes two fanciful explanations (11. 71-4), concludes that 'all seems eternal now' (1. 75), and draws a larger metaphysical lesson from the experience: The wilderness has a mysterious tongue Which teaches awful doubt, or faith so mild, So solemn, so serene, that man may be But for such faith with nature reconciled. (11. 76-9) Whatever may have happened in the past, the glacial landscape now shows no signs of having been created. It teaches an 'awful doubt' in anthropomorphic first causes (wrathful gods), or, to say the same, a 'faith' in the external existence of 'The everlasting universe of things' (1. 1). Nature appears self-sufficient and self-sustaining, and therefore no god need be invented to explain its existence. Instead of faith in God, the wilderness teaches faith in an uncreated and never-ending Nature. This faith, says Shelley, has qualities of mildness, solemnity, and serenity which may reconcile man with nature, 'But for such faith'. Here, in the phrase 'But for such faith', lies the difficulty. What can Shelley mean when he says that faith's qualities promote recon- ciliation while faith itself prevents it? Although the responses to this problem have been numerous and varied, many critics and editors accept that a rejected line from the manuscript drafts of 'Mont Blanc' ('In such a faith with Nature reconciled'2) reveals Shelley's true meaning. In the recent Oxford University Press edition, Neville Rogers simply replaces the standard version with the rejected one.3 Angela Leighton, with doubtful editorial logic, calls the rejected version an 'alternative' reading.4 1 'Mont Blanc', Shelley's Poetry and Prose, ed.

Vivian and adopted by Judith Chernaik, Earl R. Wasserman, and the Norton editors is probably the most influential and widely accepted. They argue that 'In such a faith with Nature reconciled' reveals the meaning which Shelley's attempt at a rhetorical effect obscures. 'But' is an adverb meaning 'only' rather than a preposition meaning 'except'. Shelley's revision of 'In such' to 'But for such' simply adds rhetorical weight to the claim that faith is necessary to reconciliation. Only by means of so mild, solemn, and serene a faith can man end his estrangement from nature.6 The arguments constructed on the basis of the rejected line, while in some cases persuasive, fail to take into account a second, earlier manuscript cancellation which leads to a contrary interpretation. The following transcript and facsimile opposite show how Shelley made several attempts at drafting the line which he finally published: [ ] with With such a faith [? with] In such a faith with To such high thoughts of Nature-rconcilcd!- Evcn with his mothcr naturc But for such Mountains yc have a voicc not undcrstood 2 By all but which thc wisc &amp; grcat &amp; good [ ] [ ] Intcrprct or makc fclt or deeply feel 1 In such a faith with Nature reconciled-7 Shelley first writes, 'To such high thoughts of Nature reconciled!- IMountains ye have a voice not understood . . .', and then begins interlining revisions out of which 'In such a faith with Nature reconciled' eventually emerges. This version remains uncancelled both in the rough draft and in the fair copy draft which he lost 5 Shelley: A Voice not Understood (Atlantic Highlands, NJ, 1977), 137. 6 Charles H.

He carefully looked over the cancelled lines, picking out the fragment 'But for such', and perhaps thought again about the very first version, 'To such high thoughts of Nature reconciled!' This first version implicitly acknowledges that the faith taught by the wilderness conflicts with man's deeply held belief in God. Man cannot both have faith in a god who created the universe, and accept the 'high thought[ ]' that nature may be uncreated. The mildness, solemnity, and serenity of natural faith, Shelley hopes, might yet persuade the Christian to accept such a faith. Shelley, of course, dropped this implication of a conflict between faiths when he revised his line to read, 'In such a faith with Nature reconciled'. Here faith simply serves as the means of reconciliation between man and nature. When, however, he drafted his final version, revising 'In such' to 'But for', perhaps he attempted to recapture the implication of the earliest version. 'But', in this case, is indeed a preposition meaning 'except'. Faith in nature's eternity is 'so mild, so solemn, so serene that man' might be-if only that faith were otherwise, if only it did not conflict with faith in creative deity-'with nature reconciled'. In a highly elliptical way, Shelley makes the point that faith's qualities attract the Christian, but that, ultimately, the Christian cannot understand this faith because it demands 'awful doubt' in first causes. He remains loyal to his more established belief in Christianity. A summary might make my reading clearer. Shelley first wrote, 'To such high thoughts of Nature reconciled!' This line implies a conflict between man's faith in a creator and the faith in nature's eternal existence which the wilderness offers. Dropping this idea of conflict, he then wrote, 'In such a faith with Nature reconciled'. Faith is so mild that the Christian might learn to accept it and thus to end his estrangement, not in this case from faith, but from nature itself. Finally, Shelley decided on 'But for such faith with nature reconciled'. He combined the sense that faith can be the means of man's reconciliation with nature, and the sense that faith necessarily conflicts with man's Christian belief. Faith is so mild, solemn, and serene that it might reconcile man and nature, but for its incompatibility with faith in a Creator. The phrase 'But for such faith', perhaps, reflects Shelley's recognition that reason alone cannot effect mankind's redemption: 8 Chernaik and Burnett, p. 37. 102 NOTES</page><page sequence="5">. . . until the mind can love, and admire, and trust, and hope, and endure, reasoned principles of moral conduct are seeds cast upon the highway of life which the unconscious passenger tramples into dust, although they would bear the harvest of his happiness.9 Man fell out of sympathy with nature when he acquired faith in a creative deity. This new faith, in Shelley's view, has brought him only misery and ruin. God is the 'proto-type of human misrule'.10 Man searches after him, and rules by his will with a self-destructive passion. The wilderness, however, teaches a bloodless ('mild'), sacred ('solemn'), and composed ('serene') faith which can restore man to his former, idyllic relationship with nature, but which, Shelley recognizes in a flash of intuition, man cannot ultimately understand or accept. The phrase 'But for such faith' is a rhetorical gesture by which Shelley feigns a sudden and bitter recognition that the teaching of the wilderness will never convert the 'unconscious passenger' whom he anticipates will be his reader. From one perspective Shelley upbraids and challenges the Christian. The perverse reversal which 'But for such faith' accomplishes reflects the perversity of the Christian who against reason persists in clinging to his Christianity. From another perspective, Shelley introduces the need for a class of mediators who will translate the 'mysterious tongue' for the less imaginatively gifted who cannot understand. In the final lines of section III, 'the wise, and great, and good' (1. 82) who 'interpret, or make felt, or deeply feel' (1. 83) are the demonic agents by whom the mountain teaches faith, reconciles man with nature, and legislates the 'repeal' of 'Large codes of fraud and woe' (11. 80-1). With his phrase 'But for such faith', may not Shelley, a harbinger of these demonic agents, startle 'the unconscious passenger' into 'awful doubt, or faith so mild'?
