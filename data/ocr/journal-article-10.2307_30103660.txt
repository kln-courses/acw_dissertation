<plain_text><page sequence="1">Toward A Dynamic Psychology FREUD AND ST THOMAS by E. F. O'DOHERTY PRECISELY because this is an area of special difficulty and great controversy, it is an area into which theologians who understand psychology, and psychologists who understand theology should not be afraid to enter. It is an area of rather special problems of exaggeration and confused thinking. The exaggerations are due perhaps to the enthusiasm of psychological neophytes, while the confused thinking may be due to the fact that very often the wrong questions are asked. The primary question here is not : What did Freud say and certainly not : Why did he say it St Thomas argued with great clarity and unusual vehemence in De Unitate Intellectus that the real problem was not what Aristotle may or may not have taught, but rather what was the true answer to a given problem. The Averroists may indeed have been right about Aristotle's opinion, though St Thomas thought they were wrong even about this. But either way, that is a historical question, not a philosophical or psychological one. It may be that historical questions about the content of Freud's thinking have so absorbed us that our attention has strayed from our functions as psychologists and theologians. Thus, it is possible to argue, as Allers does, that the theories of psychoanalysis were a successful error or, to suggest with Dalbiez, that they are a 'metaphysic of incest'. It is comparatively easy to argue, as Bishop Fulton Sheen did, that Freudian psychoanalysis is based on 'materialism, hedonism, infantilism, and eroticism'. Even the very term psychoanalysis is misleading, since it has become so loaded with emotional attitudes and overtones. The term 'analytic theory' is preferable, not only because it does not carry the same emotional load as psychoanalysis, but also because the term psychoanalysis is more properly applied to a technique, a process, of analysing the psyche, and is not one but many. Moreover, it is often wrongly thought of as synonymous with psychotherapy. This is not so, as a glance at the work of Fromm, Sullivan, Roger or Frankl would show. Indeed, the mother comforting her terrified child and calming him through an empathic relationship is using a very efficacious form of psychotherapy, such as a counselling psychologist might use mutatis mutandis with an anxious adult, without involving any form of analysis.</page><page sequence="2">342 Studies [WINTER It is convenient to use the term ' analytic theory ' in the singular, much as one can use the term ' atomic theory ' or ' theory of number ' in the singular, without prejudice to the fact that many theories, even conflicting ones, may be involved. Analytic theory in this sense is not a philosophy of man, but a set of con300ts and hypotheses based on clinical observations and developmental studies, which have achieved the stature of theory because of their explanatory and predictive value. It is not a complete and finalized body of knowledge, but an ongoing process ; not an a priori construct, but an attempt to reach a con300tual understanding of empirical fact. It is easy to argue that, as conceived by some of its exponents, it is a pseudo-religion : a body of doctrine based on unprovable and un tenable hypotheses about man, which are to be taken on faith ; which has its own sacred books, its rite of initiation (a personal didactic analysis), its ritual performances (couch, record of dreams, transference, abreaction ; and which derives both its raison d'htre and its strength from the comfort it gives to its believers. It is true that many of the claims made for it in the past would not now be made ; true also that statistics are not available to prove its efficacy as a therapeutic method. It is true that some of its ablest exponents have taught erroneous doctrines, and that some of its practitioners have on occasion given immoral advice to patients. But there still remains a number of new insights into the human mind which it would be foolish to ignore. It is difficult to separate these insights from the philosophical errors (e.g. about man and freedom and theological errors (e.g. about the nature of religion which some of its ablest exponents built into it. It is difficult to separate these insights from the theory and practice of' psychoanalysis ' in the usual meaning of the term. For the theory and practice of `psychoanalysis' in this sense are as closely bound together as theory and experiment in chemistry. Molecular, atomic, and nuclear theory may all have derived historically from a mechanistic world-picture and from inadequate and sometimes erroneous experimental evidence. Nevertheless they have given invaluable insights into the nature of the universe. One does not reject physics because Laplace was an atheist or Eddington a Kantian. The new insights into the physical world are shared by many who have no notion of the philosophical background in which they appear, nor any accurate understanding of theory, and who have never heard of the experiments of Thompson, Rutherford, or the Curies. The theory that the universe began in the explosion of a primordial atom and that it is flying apart at a rate approaching the speed of light is a far cry from the careful analysis of certain lines in the spectrum showing a shift towards the red end. Here theory and experiment are inseparable, as they are throughout the whole of natural science. And</page><page sequence="3">1960 Toward a Dynamic Psychology 343 yet the intelligent layman who knows neither the theory nor its ex perimental base can share with the scientist something of the latter's new insight into the physical world. Insight understanding, compre hension-is something more than a knowledge of either theory or experiment. Psychoanalysis is a process (of analysing the psyche which differs from other, perhaps shallower, analyses in as much as it aims at a deeper penetration. This deep penetration of the personality, so far from being repudiated by the Church, was endorsed by Pope Pius XII, who called for better and deeper penetration. Analytic theory, historically, is a body of psychological knowledge, mixed with error, which has arisen from this penetrating process. The term analytic theory does not belong to, and should not be allowed to become the private property of any great name or school of psychology. It is high time it was rescued and restored to the public world of the intellect. It is clear that the whole of human personality is not given in simple conscious introspection, as Humean psychology would seem to have assumed, nor in the observation of overt behaviour, as Watson seemed to suggest. Nor can philosophical reflection and analysis in this field reveal, any more than it can in the physical world, a knowledge of empirical fact. Not all mental processes and contents are observable ; we are not wholly revealed to ourselves, because our consciousness is not a Cartesian consciousness such as would be appropriate to a disembodied spirit or, in Thomistic terms, because the natural condition for the human soul is in union with matter, and the material as such, since it is singular, is not immediately present to intellect. Assuming however that intellect can, though laboriously, come by devious ways to a knowledge of process and content which is not immediately given to introspection, assuming further that the world of mind and personality is a world of order (it is unthinkable that it should be chaos, or that liberty should mean anarchy), the term analytic theory, if it can be rescued at this late hour, should be reserved for such a body of knowledge. As I shall use the term analytic theory therefore, I use it not to indicate the theories of Freud or Jung or Adler. I use it as a synonym for dynamic psychology, to indicate a body of knowledge about (a the degrees of accessibility of mental content, (b the processes, both innate and acquired, which are not listed in the classical (descriptive psychology of conative or affective life, (c the affective dimension of cognitive process (this does not mean a theory of affective knowledge, but a study of the influences of emotion on cognitive process at all levels, especially the emotional charge of images and ideas), (d the etiology of certain com600 aberrations, and (e the nature of certain defence processes which, as far as one can see, are com600 to the human psyche everywhere. Understood in this sense, it is clear that ' neither in purpose, philosophy or technique is</page><page sequence="4">344 Studies [_WINTER analytic theory hedonistic, frivolous or pleasure-loving ' (L. Kubie). Many physicists, many physicians, are hedonistic, materialistic, atheistic, but neither physics nor medicine can as such be accused of these errors. It is a pity that adjectives which apply to human beings should be applied uncritically to knowledge itself. It is worth the effort of trying to tease out the valuable elements from the rest in classical analytic theory, and to add to these such con300ts as may be found necessary to produce an integrated and adequate theory of the deep processes of the human psyche. Freud himself was an ascetic, not a Sybarite. His notion of eros, properly understood in such an adequate and in tegrated theory, will be found to lie much closer to St Paul's caritas than many contemporary interpretations of the word charity. Freud wrongly thought that he had explained away the existence of God by his brilliant analysis of infantile fears and the introjection of the father figure. Actually, properly understood on this point, what he has given us is an invaluable insight into our affective attitude to God. We can now understand a little better the difference between the Old and New Testaments (contrast the prohibition on pronouncing the name Yaweh, with `When you pray, say Father ' . We can understand better the prohibition in the law against graven images. Until the revelation is complete and the transcendent Godhead can be thought of in non-anthropomorphic terms, there must be no risk of the creation of infantile gods through the reification of projected infantile imagery in stone or bronze. Similarly we can understand better than was possible in the past the nature of adolescent atheism and revolt. It is a com600 mistake to think that the psychologist, who diffidently claims a little light where there was none, is claiming both to understand completely the behaviour under examination, and to exonerate from all responsibility the individual whose behaviour it is. Zilboorg has pointed out the 'error of thinking that once you discover that you have an unconscious motive for doing something, you may conclude : (1 that the motive is invalid ; or (2 that it disappears ; or (3 that you lose the desire to do what you want to do " because you know the unconscious reason why " ; or (4), what is even worse, that an unconscious motive is neurotic by very virtue of the fact that it is unconscious.' Freud thought in terms of a pansexualist explanation of all man's higher forms of conduct, including literature, art and religion. He succeeded in making clearer the sexual elements in some otherwise non-sexual patterns of behaviour, for instance in some hysterical malfunctions, in some forms of oral satisfaction, in symbolic imagery, and in private rituals. He made clearer the sexual (though unconscious, or unacknowledged elements in some patterns of behaviour which were for centuries known to be undesirable or unhealthy, such as particular</page><page sequence="5">1960 Toward a Dynamic Psychology 345 friendships in colleges, or excessive use of physical discipline, either in punishment of others, or self-inflicted in the name of mortification. Man ', as Zilboorg again rightly points out, is not a disorderly mass of obscure though set " Freudian " mechanisms ...' But a right under standing of these ' mechanisms ' (the term is unfortunate not necessarily in terms of what Freud thought they were, but in the context of our complex spiritual-material nature can help us in many ways. Thus we can now understand better why some marriages fail, we can understand ratum et non consummatum problems a little better, we can understand why some good people find it difficult to go to Holy Communion, why some are filled with terror instead of peace at the Gospel message. Some mysteries of human behaviour (the devils of Loudun, Savonarola, recurrent claims of virgin birth become intelligible. The relation between asceticism and sado-masochism has become clearer. The Church has always known that asceticism could serve neurotic purposes. One remembers the flagellantes and their con demnation : but the difference now is that we can understand the kind of personality which is likely to indulge in such practices, even to predict from seemingly trivial behaviour disorders the possible future aberration. Our basic need for both ritual practices and symbolism becomes intelligible : both are based on our complex nature, neither wholly rational nor wholly sensory. If we were wholly rational we would not need them, as Adam did not. If we were wholly sensory we would be incapable of them. But given our complex nature, the sensory element in them allays our sensory malaise, while our rational component can elevate them to a significance they could not otherwise have. Many problems which baffled our forebears are now partially illumined. One thinks of the compulsions and obsessions, the belief in and burning of witches, the ready ac300tance of the validity of visions and voices. Many of these phenomena were known to be of natural origin, but many also were attributed to de600ic sources by earlier generations. One remembers with dismay the Malleus Maleficarum of Fathers James Sprenger and Henry Kramer (1490). It is now not only easier to distinguish the natural from the supernatural and from the de600iacal, but it is also possible to understand why in a particular individual these manifestations take the form they do. It is even possible sometimes to cure them. Analytic theory has permeated almost every aspect of contemporary life. It has affected most of the sciences which deal with man, and all the sciences of society, from economics to jurisprudence, from anthropology to political theory. It affects law and culture, art and literature. It should not be surprising therefore to find that it can also teach us something even about the spiritual life itself. As it stands, it cannot be ac300ted uncritically. It involves assumptions about the</page><page sequence="6">346 Studies [WINTER nature of man, and about all his higher functions which are not consonant with our philosophy or theology. But neither should it be dismissed out of hand. One must reject many of its typical con300ts, and its a priori assumptions. But there still remains a substantial amount of truth, based not on assumptions, but on clinical observations. It would not be reasonable to reject fifty years of clinical observation without very sound reasons. The chief flaw in analytic theory is perhaps this : it tries to describe mental processes as if they were occurring to mental contents conceived substantially in their own right. Its language is that of physics, engineering, and the natural sciences generally. It uses analogies and suggests that they are literally true descriptions of phenomena. Our task must be to get behind the semantic barriers and the analogies, and to discover the realities which it purports to describe. We must in other words try to formulate a Thomistic dynamic psychology. The Thomistic dynamisms will be found in the con300ts of appetitus naturalis, concupiscentia, timor naturalis, and voluntas ut natura. There are not one but two scales of mental health : the one running from the level of the very disturbed person up the scale to the minimum level of mental health, which involves only an absence of pathological process. But the second scale runs from this level up to the perfection of the mature personality on the natural plane, plus the full development of all its potentialities under the influence of grace. In respect of the first scale, the paranoias, the depressive states, the schizophrenias, etc., analysis alone is of little or no avail, though, even at this level, some psychotherapy (and in many cases a great deal of it is necessary for the full rehabilitation of the sick person. The real efficacy of analytic processes however is found on the second scale. Very few people can achieve full maturity on their own. There remains in most of us some residual effects of infantilism, of emotional distortion, of non-rational thinking. This is sound theology, as well as being good empirical observation. It involves the familiar aphorism of the moral theologian, that the will has not got potestas dominative, but only democratica over the lower functions. It is true that many of the effects of the non-rational processes of the psyche can be understood at the conscious level, and some can be coped with directly by the ego the conscious rational source of self-control. Classical analytic theory on the whole tended to undervalue the efficacy of the ego, which became almost a wholly passive observer or recipient of experience. But, more and more, the great theorists and practitioners have restored the ego to its proper function : that of knowledge, of initiating and guiding action, of controlling the lower processes, and of goal-seeking. Many good people could benefit by a sound therapeutic process which would free the ego the intellect and will, if you prefer from the influence of non-rational forces. We are none of us wholly emancipated yet.</page><page sequence="7">1960 Toward a Dynamic Psychology 347 The task of the dynamic psychologist, or analyst (using the term without prejudice to any ' school ' is to reveal the hidden, or unack nowledged, or unknown forces which distort the judgment, thus giving us a clearer picture of ourselves. Dynamic or analytic con300ts in this sense are not tied to any -ism or person. Know thyself, Cognosce teipsum, was familiar to the Greeks, and St Augustine carries it to a higher plane, by amending it to read Noverim me, noverim to ' That I may know myself, and that I may . know Thee, 0 Lord'. There are laws, natural laws, of psychic process and of psychic development, which in no way negative our freedom. The process of con300t formation, the thought processes, the stages of maturation, are governed by law. These laws are not necessarily determining processes : but it is interesting to note that even determining processes do not destroy our freedom. Voluntas ut natura is not free in respect of the ultimate end. If some of these laws, either in classic or dynamic psychology (the so-called laws of association in classic ' psychology, gestalt laws of per300tion in more recent non-analytic theory, the mechanisms of dynamic psychology), have been too naively formulated or formulated in a philosophically unac300table way, it behoves us to re-formulate them accurately and in an ac300table way, much as the laws of physics have had to be re-formulated many times over, but not summarily rejected. No one would now reject the con300t of dynamic process, or of unconscious influence on the will. But a naive hypostatized thing called 'the unconscious' must be rejected with the `bump of laughter' or of 'mathematics.' of the phrenologist. Few would reject the notions of regression, repression, projection, rationalization, and the rest, though their interpretation in mechanical terms on the basis of physical analogies is simply too naive to be true. The error of the great analytic theorists, if one can put it in a sentence, is the limiting of causality in psychic process to efficient causality. The human act is reduced to an actus hominis, which in turn is accounted for wholly by finding its causes in antecedent experience, working through imagery or memory. Thus, the process of analysis, or psycho analysis, aims at revealing the hidden material derived from earlier, usually infantile, experience, on the ground that . this hidden material (plus of course its emotional charge is the cause of the present symptom or behaviour disorder. In a similar way, the present structure of the personality is accounted for wholly in terms of the experiences which produced it. The error is that of a totalitarian solution : one factor instead of many ; a 600istic solution where a plurality of causes, especially final causality or purpose, may be necessary to account for the phenomenon. But to say this is not to reject the causality of earlier experience. In Thomistic terms, this remains with us in the form of habitual knowledge. The soul has received a 'form', in classical</page><page sequence="8">348 Studies [WINTER terms, without matter, and this form remains within the psyche, but in respect of consciousness only in potentia. Such a person is in potentia in respect of this content, as long as he is not consciously thinking of it. Nevertheless in a true sense he possesses this knowledge is ' informed ' by it-and so is in a different potential relation to it from that of someone who has never undergone the experience at all. This would appear to be the truth of the handy ragbag holdall con300t of the unconscious. In addition to the type of causality attributable to mental contents possessed in the form of habitual knowledge, a valid dynamic psychology needs also the con300t of innate process. This means that the psyche must not be thought of as a mere recipient of experience, a tabula rasa in the phrase beloved of undergraduates (though of course, pace Plato and Jung, all its cognitive content of whatsoever kind must be acquired : there are no innate ideas ; nor should the psyche be thought of as a mere onlooker, a passive spectator at a Humean theatre of the mind where events linked only by the superstition of association laws merely succeed each other on a mental stage (ex300t that, as Bradley pointed out, in this Humean world there is no theatre and no stage, but only the succession of events . The reality of the soul is such that it is of its own nature active (it is form, and forma dat esse et agere . The psyche (the apparatus of process and content called mind is also active of its own nature. Soul, generically, is a wider con300t than mind, embracing as it does both for Aristotle and St Thomas the notion of life principle even at the plant level. Understood in this way, living but non-cognitive and wholly unconscious beings such as plants will still have innate processes (dynamisms, but not yet mental, though genuinely psychical in an etymological and philosophical sense . These innate dynamisms will in general be those concerned with nutrition and reproduction. The notion, therefore, of living, purposive, but wholly unconscious activity is inherent in St Thomas's thought at this point. The rational soul is the source in man of all his activities, including the basic vegetative processes, and is certainly in Thomistic thought the source of even the most basic of physiological processes. It is virtually also a sentient and a vegetative soul, which means in the present context that it is the source of the innate processes or dynamisms which we have just called living, purposive, but wholly unconscious. The key con300t here is the notion of appetitus naturalis. Not only are there innate conative processes, or dynamisms, in the psyche, but according to St Thomas, these extend even to the inorganic world. Thus, material things have a `natural appetite' to preserve their own existence. In English, the term `natural appetite' suggests an anthropomorphic type of thinking which was not that of St Thomas. Indeed, not only does he not attribute a 'human' desire to inanimate matter, but rather attributes</page><page sequence="9">1960 Toward a Dynamic Psychology 349 the intrinsic dynamism of matter (which the scientist calls ' laws of conservation of mass, of energy,' etc. analogously to man. It is important to remember the purposive character of action of all kinds (omne agens agit propter finem, even inorganic matter when we consider motivation later. The operation of voluntas ut natura is a good example of the real nature of a psychic dynamism. For while the will follows the intellect, it nevertheless of its own nature seeks happiness. What precisely it will seek in re may be determined by experience, education, choice. Thus it may seek happiness in wealth, or power. But the seeking of happiness itself is not the result of experience, but is a process inherent in human nature -a dynamism of the will itself. Paralleling this on a different plane, there are other such innate processes. Thus con cupiscence (called libido by the analysts), generically defined as an appetite for sensory pleasure, is an innate dynamism, a function of appetitus naturalis proper to organic sensory life which would incline us or impel us to seek certain satisfactions, even apart from the residual effects of earlier experience. St Thomas makes this point clear in several places (e.g. Ia 2ae, XXX, 3 ; and XXXI, 3 when he distinguishes two kinds of concupiscence, one secundum naturam, the other secundum apprehensionem. In a similar way, fear can be thought of as an innate dynamism, according to Ia 2ae, XLI, 3, c, where St Thomas speaks of a timor naturalis, according to which nature flees from a destructive evil propter naturale desiderium essendi. This con300t of innate fears receives an unexpected confirmation from behaviouristic psychology, according to which certain experiences precipitate fear in a child without previous learning or experience on the child's part, e.g. a sudden loud noise, or the feeling of being left unsupported in mid-air, while other fears are acquired (as a result of a conditioning process, in behaviourist terms, or secundum apprehensionem in St Thomas's terms . Freud's eros can thus be understood as a process of natural appetite combining conservation of being with pleasure-seeking concupiscentia, and the avoidance of destructive evil propter naturale desiderium essendi (timor). But that is not all. That is what it would be if we remained at the level of the organic and sensory. But as consciousness awakens, and rational processes come into play, voluntas ut natura will at first complicate the picture, since it will at first seek happiness in the objects of concupiscentia ; but later, following the illumination of intellect, will be capable of consciously controlling or repudiating the demands of the subrational dynamisms. But they remain with us as active and powerful forces. It is true that the sensory appetite follows sensory knowledge, just as, at rational level, nil volitum nisi praecognitum. We have been arguing however that in addition to motive in the sense of known-object-attracting appetite, the appetites are active in their own right : antecedent to</page><page sequence="10">350 Studies [wINTER knowledge, and independent of consciousness. The best example of this is the infant's appetite for food, oxygen and sleep. The con300t of motivation in Thomistic terms has to take account, therefore, of three sets of innate dynamisms : a natural inclination to seek sensory pleasure (concupiscentia secundum naturam), to avoid unpleasant experiences (timor naturalis), and to seek happiness (voluntas ut natura . These can co-exist in the same act, either in co-operation or in opposition. In addition, however, we have a further type of motivation to take into account : that of final causality. The important point here is that this is not necessarily always conscious. Omne agens agit propter finem : every thing acts for an end, not just conscious beings. It is not always easy to discover the end, but it is inherent in the notion of action itself that it should be directed to an end. We do not always consciously choose the end of our acts : an actus hominis carried out in sleep, or in un consciousness, or unconsciously, is not carried out for a consciously chosen end. In a similar, but far more important, way, the end chosen in consciously directed behaviour may be only one aspect of the whole act, while other processes (of concupiscentia or timor are receiving an unconscious gratification. Their satisfaction was also part of the motivation that brought about the act, and may indeed on occasion be the really effective motivating force, while the consciously chosen end is little more than an occasion (ac300table to intellect and will upon which sensory appetite can be satisfied. This is what analytic theory describes under the general head of unconscious motivation, rationalization, and sublimation. The Thomistic dynamisms account for the processes involved here without their mechanistic overtones. It is salutary, and sometimes vitally necessary, to reveal to ourselves what the purpose of some of our actions really is. Sometimes, however, our purpose may be so deeply buried that we need help to discover it, and it may take prolonged analysis to bring to full conscious acknowledg ment the real meaning of our acts. We are familiar with the notions of habitual and virtual intention in moral theology : these are special cases of unconscious motivation, the first being the case of a motive once conscious and now no longer so, the second being the more extra ordinary case of finality or intention which would have been ours if we had ever thought about it, but which in fact was never conscious at all. They are therefore variations on the general theme of unconscious finality or purpose in human acts and are mentioned here only to show that the idea of our having a motive in our acts which is not known to present consciousness is not in itself a new discovery. But the applica tion of this con300t in many areas is new. Thus, we now know that neurotic, and especially hysterical, patterns of behaviour are purposive or meaningful in ways not known to the neurotic or hysteric, and indeed in ways which the neurotic could never discover for himself,</page><page sequence="11">1960 Toward a Dynamic Psychology 351 since part of the neurosis is precisely the avoidance of reality. In Freudian terms, such people may be living by the pleasure principle, and refusing the transition to the reality principle, but not in the way we do when we deliberately choose to indulge some pleasure instead of coping with a problem. The neurotic does this, but does it unconsciously. The trained psychologist can sometimes discern the meaning of a neurotic pattern. Thus, for example, a novice pining away through a series of illnesses may be simply protesting his unwillingness to . go on in religious life. Actiones sunt suppositorum. It is the person who is behaving thus or thus, whether it be in speech or in other symbolic language. It is perhaps a good thing that so much of our motivation is hidden even from ourselves. 'Father, forgive them for they know not what they do'. Some of the saints would appear to have been given, perhaps as a special prerogative of grace, the gift of total insight into their own motivation. If we had total self-consciousness, we would see all the ramifications of our motivation (this appears to be the case with disembodied spirits . If we had total self-control, we would rule all our acts solely by intellect and will. But we have no such prerogatives. We are free, but our freedom is limited : a600g other things, limited by the factors we have been considering. Sometimes, in strictly pathological conditions, freedom can disappear. The most obvious case is that of passio totaliter tollens usum rationis. But well short of this condition are the obsessions and compulsions which affect behaviour and reduce responsibility. An obsession is an image, usually emotionally charged, which appears involuntarily in consciousness, and which cannot be voluntarily dislodged. A compulsion is a strong tendency to act in some particular way, which results from the efficient causality of a mental content or process, such that the will may become powerless in respect of the act. The psychologist's and psychiatrist's job is the restoration of freedom, where it is impaired by subrational forces. How can psychological insights aid us in the context of moral problems It is often thought, wrongly, that the psychologist's analysis of motivation and human behaviour is aimed at exonerating the individual from responsibility. This is a great error. To forgive is not the same as to exonerate. To exonerate means to declare that an individual has not committed a crime. To forgive means to declare him guilty, and then absolve. The more one understands the nature of the human act and its motivation, the easier it becomes to forgive. Unfortunately, some psychiatrists have on occasion made the mistake of thinking that because they can understand some of the causes of an act, that therefore the act was not free. This is tantamount to assuming that free acts must be uncaused acts, which is an impossibility. Psychological insight can sometimes reveal the causes, hidden from consciousness, which are operating to induce the assent of the will and, by releasing it from their influence, make it easier for the will to make right choices.</page><page sequence="12">352 Studies [WINTER One might perhaps indicate some of the ways in which psychology can be of help to moral theology as follows: (a It can help to reveal to an individual the nature of his own motivation, perhaps at levels hitherto unknown to or unacknowledged by him. Thus, for example, taking liquor in excess may have an obvious end, pleasure. But a man may conceal this from himself and tell himself that he is taking it for health reasons. This is an obvious and simple case. It may, on the other hand, be a much more serious situation he may be over-indulging to allay an anxiety (a timor naturalis he does not wish to face, which in turn may be linked with a sexual problem. (b It can help to reveal hidden dimensions of purpose in an act. There are two elements here. On the one hand, it may be possible to show that a particular act or pattern of behaviour has a significance unknown to or unacknowledged by the agent. The child refusing his food is a good example at a pre-moral level, since the act may not mean that the child is ill, but that he is protesting against a lack of affection in its environment. The youth who steals indiscriminately and hoards the objects may not realize the sexual significance of his acts. On the other hand, an act may not of itself have a particular significance, but in an individual case may be part of a private symbolic language. (c It can help to reveal a complex psychological condition of obsession and compulsion, which may occur consciously or unconsciously outside the region of voluntary control. Complex processes of this kind may become so divorced from the rest of the psyche as to appear to function independently of the personality. Compulsive handwashing of the Lady Macbeth type is a good example. But very far short of this pathological stage, less severe conditions may impair the individual's freedom. A process of this kind may occur simultaneously with an intellectual function in full waking life, but as it were encapsulated '. An adolescent's dream of himself as a great explorer may occur simultaneously with his attempt to master mathematics. His excitement may be displaced from his dream on to his subject, thus facilitating its learning, but this is rare. More usually, the obsessional condition will impair his rational functioning. In Thomistic terminology, this condition may be described as an emotionally charged unit of habitual knowledge which emerges spontaneously into consciousness, and which because of its efficacy in producing motor-behaviour diminishes responsibility. In so far as we can reveal the existence of any of these elements we can hope to release the will from their influence, in much the same way as by removing a young man from bad companions, we can free him from their influence. This does not ensure his reform, but at least it makes it possible in circumstances where otherwise it might seem to be impossible. What the youth does in the context of his bad conn panions may indeed be an evil act, for which he must be held responsible,</page><page sequence="13">1960 Toward a Dynamic Psychology 353 but as long as he remains there he may not, humanly speaking, be capable of reform. In much the same way, the will in the context of these irrational forces may still be free (i.e. these forces may not be such that they destroy voluntariety but, until they are revealed and removed, it may be, humanly speaking, impossible for the individual to reform. It is more difficult for a person who understands the real meaning of his acts, and who is aware that others may also understand it, to continue as before to do these acts. The relevance of analytic theory to problems of spiritual direction can be illustrated, perhaps, by looking at some special problems, in particular the problem of guilt. There are two main types of guilt, the rational and the neurotic. Rational guilt is the state of mind of a person who judges that an ac the did, voluntarily and knowingly, was wrong. It is a judgment of intellect in the context of human acts. Neurotic guilt, on the other hand, is a state of the emotions. A healthy emotional state may accompany rational guilt, just as neurotic guilt may accompany the intellectual judgment of wrongdoing. But they are distinct phenomena. Within neurotic guilt one may distinguish many components : fear, anxiety, dread of and desire for punishment, self-loathing, self-directed aggression, conflict between desire and aversion, etc. It is a pathological state in much the same way as any unhealthy prolonged indulgence of an inappropriate emotion may be unhealthy. It is further complicated by the fact that the individual who experiences it may cling to it for the masochistic pleasure of self-torture. It should be noted conversely that some who should experience some emotional guilt for their wrongdoing can in fact exhibit a too detached unemotional apathy : this state can be just as pathological as neurotic guilt. Neurotic guilt is allied to but not identical with scrupulosity, and admits of many degrees. Its most usual manifestation is in connection with sexual offences, real or imaginary. It is found in depressions, hysterical states, anxiety states, schizophrenia, and involutional states. It can be relieved by many psychiatric procedures, from pharmacological and electro-convulsive therapy to short-term or prolonged psychotherapy. Once the pathological process is relieved or removed, the judgment and will can function once again as rational processes in the control of behaviour and the production of meritorious acts. A special case of neurotic guilt perhaps is the coexistence of anxiety and genuine sorrow for sin. It is only right that one should experience some anxiety in connection with sin, so that this state is not necessarily a pathological one. It may even be a necessary and salutary thing to provoke some anxiety in a penitent who is particularly cold and detached, and this both for natural and supernatural reasons. The criterion to be applied in deciding whether or not the anxiety is unhealthy is the degree, if any, to which the penitent's normal adaptation is inter fered with.</page><page sequence="14">354 Studies Nevertheless, it is usually safe to be suspicious of anxiety, particularly if it is prolonged through time. It may indicate a lack of faith (though this is rare in the mercy of God, but more often it is a concealed request for human sympathy and affection. Sometimes again it is evidence of the existence of a moral problem different from the manifest one, usually more serious and hidden or unacknowledged. In this latter case an under standing of deep personality process may be efficacious in unexpected ways. Thus the inability of an individual to go to the sacraments may be due to an awareness of serious sin which the penitent cannot mention through morbid distortion of emotional life over a long time. This is compatible with all the outward signs of faith and devotion. One can sometimes release all the unacknowledged material by a sudden sharp probe. Religion can sometimes be made to serve neurotic needs. Thus, for example, the compulsive-obsessional type of person in a severe or marked state of his neurosis is fairly easily identified. But milder forms of the same neurosis may seek expression in the use of meticulous private rituals in religion, or even may put religious objects to fetishistic purposes. Or again, the virtues of obedience and humility may be distorted to serve neurotic needs. A little deep probing will sometimes reveal the satisfaction of a masochistic pleasure associated with neurotic guilt in the need for being put under obedience, and sometimes indeed the process of disobedience may be revealed as a means of self-punishment, by incurring guilt which then has to be expiated, sometimes by public penance. Clearly this is a problem of the very few, and should not be exaggerated or generalized. It is analogous to the process one finds in juvenile delinquents, and in children who 'punish' their parents for their lack of affection by stealing, or by other behaviour disorders. Other regressive patterns of behaviour, such as infantilism in many forms, may also be discerned. It may be important also to examine the complex motivations and vicarious satisfactions which are involved in otherwise admirable activities. Clearly, this whole field demands more study and research. Our purpose was to show that there already exists a great deal of dynamic psychology in the traditional con300ts of Thomistic thought. It surely cannot be expected that the solutions to the problems which arise in this domain of research should be simple. On the contrary, they are extremely complicated, and require the diligens et subtilis inquisitio (la, LXXXVII, 1, c by which alone St Thomas says we can come to an under standing of the mind. The Thomistic dynamisms touched on in this paper should prove a useful starting-point for the construction of a valid dynamic psychology, useful alike to the psychotherapist and the director of souls.' 11 Based on a paper read at the Stillorgan Conference on `The Priest and Mental Health' held at the St John of God Hospital, Stillorgan, Co.
