Ad'ryos and "Epyov in the 'Ewrtrdtoq of Thucydides, by Professor Samuel E. Bassett, of the University of Vermont. The contrast between " word " and " deed " is used, in one form or another, more frequently in the " Funeral Oration of Pericles " (Thuc. II, 35-46) than in any other passage of equal length in extant Greek literature. This use has been characterized as " tasteless tautology " (Mure, History of Greek Literature, V2, i69). The present paper attempted to acquit Thucydides of this charge by establishing these points: I. Thucydides uses the contrast as something more than a mere rhetorical device. Ao'yos meant to him the ratio as wvell as the oratio of the Zpyov. WNIhile he uses the popular antithesis (Pro- fessor Gildersleeve, in A. J. P. XXVI, 112, remarks that it was a " news7 toy ") as the tizotif of the oration, and belittles the Aoyos (-oratio), he praises the X6yos (- ratio) as being of greater im- portance than the Z'pyov. In fact, his eulogy of Athens consists essentially in the repeated indications that Aoyos, in this sense, is a fundamental characteristic of the Athenians. II. In his use of the antithesis Aoyos - spyov, and other " polar" expressions, Thucydides presents a striking similarity to Sophocles, who of all fifth century poets is most fond of polarity and most frequently employs the contrast between ' word " and "d eed." Whether Sophocles is to be regarded as the first to make promainent this peculiarity of style (so Navarre) or whether he was influenced by the innovations of Gorgias or other rhetoricians is uncertain, but since the Ant4,rone offers the best illustrations of polarity, it is clear that this feature became popular soon after 450 B.c. It is therefore altogether possible that the style of the Thucydidean " Epitaphius," in which " polar " expressions are v-ery numerous, is, to some extent, Periclean. At all events, it presents many points of contact with the third quarter of the fifth century. III. Thucydides regards the Peloponnesian WVar from the point of view of the preceding generation. Together with Sophocles and Pericles he represents the ideas of the Great Age of Athens. Furtwiingler ascribed the greatness of this brief period in sculpture to the attainment of the nearest approach to a balance between two antithetical principles of art. In a similar way we may say that the intellectual character of the Age of Pericles is marked by an</page><page sequence="16">Proceedings for I9 i6 xv approximate equilibrium between the Xoyos and the rpyov. In pre- ceding generations the Zpyov - or rather, Epya - had somewhat more attention; later, the influence of the sophists on the one hand, and of Socrates on the other, made the Xoyos of superior im- portance; but for a few years about the middle of the fifth century both Xoyos and zpyov receive due consideration. The Age of Per- icles is marked not only by its material achievements but equally by the idealism of Phidias, Sophocles, and Pericles. Hence it is not unfitting that Thucydides in showing the real significance of Periclean Athens should " overwork the new toy " of literary style, and at the same time demonstrate that the true greatness of the Athenians lay in their attention to the Xo'yos as well as to the Epyov. This subtle use of the antithesis prevents it from being a literary blemish. 2. The Phonetic Presuppositions of the Fulgentian Ety- mologies, by Dr. Theodore Arthur Buenger, of the Univer- sity of Pennsylvania. The etymologies contained in the writings of the African Fabius Planciades Fulgentius (500 A.D.) give evidence for the following phonetic phenomena: the change of ae &gt; ae &gt; e, ae &gt; e, au &gt; u, y &gt; i, oe &gt; e, ot &gt; oi &gt; i, v &gt; o, v &gt; i; the occurrence of prosthe- tic e or i; the weakening of vowels in unaccented initial syllables, in unaccented penults, and in final syllables; the loss of the aspira- tion; the simplification of et &gt; /t, pt &gt; t/, ps &gt; ss, mn &gt; nn, nt &gt; t/; the interchange of c and t; the change of g &gt; y, the interchange of b and v; assibilation; and the loss of final consonants and un- accented syllables. 3. A Supposed Connection between Certain Passages in Ovid and Genesis, I8-I9, by Professor Curtis C. Bushnell of Syracuse University. The story of Philemon and Baucis (Ovid, Met. viii, 6I7-724) is not, like most of its fellows, a mere wonder-tale, but rather what in Biblical study is called a Midrash, i.e. a homiletic story. The texts enforced (11. 6I8-619, 724) are in the form called in Hebrew poetry the parallelism. The miracle of 679-680 resembles I Kings, I7, 8-i6 and II Kings, 4, 1-7. The story as a whole closely parallels Gen. i9, I-29, with additional elements parallel to parts of Gen. i8.</page><page sequence="17">xvi American Philological Association The points of resemblance to Gen. i9, 1-29 (the story of Sodom) are: inhospitality on the part of a community toward unrecognized divine beings who seek food and shelter at evening; their contrast- ing friendly reception by a single household; their recognition through a miracle their decree of punishment to the community at large and of immunity for the hospitable household; their com- mand to the latter to go to the mountain; their protecting escort; the execution of the sentence on the morning that follows this eventful night (according to Ovid by submergence in a lake, in Genesis by a fiery rain and " overthrow"); and metamorphoses of certain characters of both stories. The resemblance is made still closer in that a submergence of some kind is thought of as accompanying the destruction of Sodom (Gen. 14, 3; 13, I0; Jos. Ant. I, 9; Strabo, xvi, 2, 44). The pre- ponderance of present opinion is that the Biblical writer thought of the Dead Sea as submerging its site. Features of Ovid's story that might have come from Gen. i8 are the representations that the hospitable pair are old, that the wife takes part in preparing a repast of an elaborate character, and perhaps the suggestion of sacred trees (Gen. i8, 4, 8; Met. viii, 7 I2-7 24). Gen. i8, I-I5 also finds a parallel in Fasti, V, 495-534. An old man offers ample entertainment to three unrecognized divine beings, the chief of whom, when they have disclosed their identity, promises a miraculously given child. The hour is the same as in Gen. I9, I. The passages in the Fasti and Metamorphoses have many resemblances in general thought, in details, and in verbal expression, and must be companion pieces. They differ from the Biblical passages in stressing the poverty and the conjugal affec- tion of the hosts. Ovid's introduction to his account of the Deluge, Met. i, 2 11-26I, is like the story of Sodom in that inhospitality to divine beings brings a catastrophe as a punishment (here the flood). Here too as in that story the divinity comes down in human form to make personal investigation of a report of wrong-doing, and the punish- ment is by " avenging fire " and an " overthrow." Compare Met. I, 230, 231 with Gen. 19, 24-25, and Met. I, 2 11-213 with Gen. i8, 20-21. In all this Ovid agrees with the Greek Deluge story as told by Apollodorus. The Metamorphoses passages seem plainly to show a contact</page><page sequence="18">Proceedings for I9I6 xvii with the Biblical ones. The following may explain the relationship of these to one another and to several similar stories. The ancient versions of the Deluge story are the Babylonian (Berosus, Gilgamesh epic, Scheil's tablet), the Hebrew version in Gen. 6-8, the Syrian version, and the Greco-Roman version. The story of Sodom is related to these, as is also that of Philemon and Baucis. Before any of these narratives there seem to have existed two others which were both independent of one another and the sources of the rest, the one telling of a local, the other of a universal catas- trophe (caused by inundation). Both appear in the Gilgamesh epic (though the former is only in outline), in the tale of Sodom (to the extent of just a trace of the latter, viz. in Gen. I9, 31), and in the Greco-Roman version. The tale of Philemon and Baucis has only the local story, the remaining versions have only the universal story. The story of Sodom seems, except as just noted, to be a localized Hebrew version of the original story of a limited inundation. The Dead Sea environment accounts for such changes and additions as the metamorphosis of Lot's wife and the substitution of fire for water as the agent of destruction (though, as stated, there seem to be traces of an earlier submergence story, for which, indeed, the command to flee to the mountain would have more meaning). The divine personal investigation of and personal dealing with the situa- tion is, as far as we can tell, a wholly new element; it is exactly what the Yahwist writer with his anthropomorphic conception of God would be drawn to add. Compare his narratives in Gen. 3, 8-I9; 4, 9-I2; II, 5-9. Antiochus the Great (B.C. 223-I87) removed 2000 families of Jews from Mesopotamia into Phrygia (Jos. Ant. XII, 3, 4). This would bring Gen. I8-I9 into Phrygia to be remoulded in accor- dance with local environment and local religious ideas into the story of Philemon and Baucis, to whose existence in this locality both Met. viii, 620 ff. and Acts I4, II-I3 testify. As the Dead Sea environment had suggested destruction by fire, the Phrygian environment now suggested destruction by water, since parts of that country are subject to violent floods, a fact which localized in Phrygia both Noah's deluge and that of Deucalion. Here in Phrygia the element of personal investigation and action by the Deity that had originated with the Yahwist writer might naturally</page><page sequence="19">xviii Anmerican Philological Association pass over from the local adaptation of the story of Sodom into the kindred D)eluge story so that eventually the version of the Deluge story according to Apollodorus and Ovid resulted. Thus the local and the general stories of the Flood were again combined, or the local story at least enlarged. The history of the origin of the Fasti passage seems similar to that of the Metamnorphoses passages. Thus our three Ovid passages seem to go back to the Hebrew scriptures, a fact which explains the homiletic quality and other Biblical resemblances of the story of Philemon and Baucis and suggests an explanation for certain other parallels, as that of Met.

In his Quacestiones Graecae, 1I2, Plutarch asks the question, "W Who is Charila among the Delphians ? " In answering this he states that it is the name of one of the three octennial feasts of Delphi, the other two being the Stepterion and the Herois. It is sig- nificant that all three are peculiarly local in their character. The myth which Plutarch relates concerning the Stepterion plainly shows that in origin it was a ceremonial link connecting the cult of Apollo with that of the earth goddess. The Herois, too, through its legendary associations with Semele, is certainly to be traced back to some ritual of earth worship. But as yet no satisfactory explanation of Charila has been forthcoming. Can we not, how- ever, see in its name some indication of its history? Charila is apparently a diminutive of Charis, and Charis, the wife of He- phaestus, is none other than Aphrodite, the earth goddess of the East. All these festivals then are basically of the same nature. From Plutarch's account we gather, first, that the Charila festival, though the last in order of celebration, is the most important of the rituals and therefore probably the oldest; secondly, that all three took place every eighth year (or, according to Greek reckoning, every ninth year) in the dry weeks of summer immediately fol- lowing harvest. It is scarcely an accident that this period corre- sponds to the time fixed for the celebration of the Pythian games, the second full moon after the summer solstice. At all events, we are evidently to look for an astronomical explanation of this com- bination of ceremonies. Now the chief octennial celestial phenome-</page><page sequence="20">Proceedings for I9I6 xix non is the coincidence of the sun, moon, and Venus years, a fact known early to the Babylonians and Egyptians, but unknown to the Greeks until a relatively late date. Whence came this knowledge, then, preserved apparently for centuries in these obscure local festivals of Delphi? Doubtless from Babylonia rather than from Egypt. On quite other grounds this origin has been claimed be- fore, but not proven. M. Bdrard derives the name of Delphi from Delephat, the Babylonian designation of the planet Venus, i.e. Aphrodite, Ishtar, Ishkhara, etc. It is possible that all doubt may be cleared up by a thorough investigation of the origin and signifi- cance of octennial, or enneateric, feasts in Greece and the nearer East. 5. On the Need of Establishing Laboratories for Experi- mental Linguistics and Fonetics, by Professor Robert J. Kellogg, of the James Millikin University. Laboratory work in language includes experimental, observa- tional, clinical, and anatomical study of its mental, fysical, fysio- logical, fonetic, acoustic, and social aspects. It falls under the partly overlapping fields of experimental fonetics, acoustics, metrics, anatomy and fysiology of speech and hearing, psycology and psy- cofysiology of language, linguistic pedagogy, pathological and defectiv forms of language, child language, and animal language. The work is important for general linguistics, for theoretical and practical fonetics, and for methods of language teachiing. Many pressing problems can only be solvd by experimental or observa- tional investigation. Also experimental linguistics can furnish important data for psycology and psycofysiology. The work has hitherto been largely carried on by fysiologists, psycologists, and fysicists from the standpoint of their respectiv sciences rather than from the linguistic standpoint. Important work has, however, also been done by linguists and foneticians. Work along these lines is now being done at more than thirty American colleges and universities under individual or departmental auspices. Workers ar mostly isolated, but some ar collaborating. Laboratory facilities ar partly private, partly furnisht by existing psycological, fysical, and fysiological laboratories, and in several institutions by newly establisht fonetic laboratories. Departnments interested include fysics, fysiology, medicin, fonetics, filology, German, Latin, Romance, Arabic, oriental languages, English,</page><page sequence="21">xx American Philological Association retoric, public speaking, zoology, anthropology, and missionary training.

There ar probably other lines of reserch not yet reported. The work rests largely on individual zeal. Much of it suffers from isolation and scant equipment, with consequent duplication of elementary effort and corresponding loss in volume of advanst results. Most workers also lack facilities for publishing. The situation demands: (i) strengthening and extending exist- ing work, (2) stimulation and encouragement of new workers, (3) additional fonetic laboratories, (4) increast cooperation be- tween different workers and agencies, (5) thoroly equipt linguistic laboratories at one or more strategic centers, with fonetic, linguistic, psycological, pedagogical, fysiological, pathological, clinical, fysical, zoological, and anthropological departments, all organized from and subordinated to the linguistic standpoint.

Vergil's Theocritus, by Professor Louis E. Lord, of Oberlin College. Imitations of Theocritus before Vergil are surprisingly few. The earliest edition of his works which we can define is that of Artemidorus, a contemporary of Vergil, and not of Sulla as Wilamowitz holds. An examination of the recognized imitations of Theocritus by Vergil shows that Vergil used only those Idyls usually numbered i-i i. Supposed imitations from later Idyls are similarities in commonplace ideas or else consist of material which came into the Eclogutes and the later Idyls from Idyls i-I 1. The Theocritean material in the Georgics and the Aeneid is also drawn from this group of Idyls. The account of the boxing match in the fifth book of the Aeneid is taken from Apollonius and not from Theocritus' twenty-second poem. This conclusion is strengthened by the evidence of the pastoral names. All that are common to Vergil and Theocritus occur in the first eleven Idyis, and only four of these (Adonis, Daphnis, Lycidas, Menalcas) appear in the later Idyls. The existence of a collection of the first eleven Idyls is suggested by the character of the hypothesis of Idyl I 2 and by the preserva- tion of these Idyis separately in a Vienna manuscript. Idyis 8 and 9 were probably unfinished studies regarded as a single poem in Servius' time. Hence the collection then consisted of ten poems which were the ten " merae rusticae " from which Vergil took his seven. 7. Ionia and Greek Colonization, by Professor Alfred W. Milden, of the University of Mississippi. The seventh century B.C. iS the earliest period for which reliable data exist such as written records and stamped coins. Our princi- pal sources of information, however, are Herodotus, Thucydides, and Strabo. In the realm of speculation the place of highest honor is, I think, due to David G. Hogarth for his admirable monograph on fIonia and the East. Hogarth holds with Hellenic tradition when it says that</page><page sequence="23">xxii American Philological Association not far from the beginning of the first millennium B.C., bands of colonists came from the west and settled on the western coast of Asia Minor. He reaches the general conclusion that in Jonia we have, not a pure Hellenic civilization, but an amalgam of Asiatic, European, and Aegean culture. This theory is to my mind convincing. Ionia comprised in all twelve city-states, situated along a strip of some ninety miles of the western coast of Asia Minor, which I would characterize as the United States of Ionia. The southern group was composed of Miletus, Myus, and Priene; the Lydian comprised Ephesus, Colophon, Lebedus, Teos, Clazomenae, and Phocaea; while the island group included Samos, Chios, and Erythrae (on the mainland adjoining). Ionia enjoyed the finest air and climate in the world (Hdt. i, 141). The Panionium, their common shrine, sacred to Posei- don, was open only to states belonging to the union, Smyrna, there- fore, being excluded. Monarchy, at first universal, was displaced in a few centuries by oligarchy. The colonists, inspired by their new environment, soon reached in literature and science heights unattain- able by the Asiatic peoples. In the eighth century there followed a second period of colonial expansion in which the leading part was taken by the Jonians and the Dorians. Miletus alone is credited with the founding of eighty colonies - later the principal source of the grain supply of Greece. There is no modern parallel for these Greek colonies. They were attached to the mother city by a sentiment of reverence, but were po/iicaally independent and autonomous. The new citizen held property and married only within the bounds of his own city-state (Abbott, History of Greece, ii, 8). Quite the opposite of these is that artificial type of the sixth century known as a cleruchy, the archetype, doubtless, of the coloniae of the Roman republic, and an anticipation of the modern colony which is based on the theory of territorial sovereignty. It was this latter type which was exten- sively used by Pericles in cementing together the Athenian empire by establishing outposts to ensure the corn trade of the north and preserve, at the same time, the allegiance of doubtful allies. It was alike the strength and the weakness of the Greeks that they separated their politics from their religion. Slowly but surely the Ionians were reduced to political bondage by the empire of the Lydians. After Cyrus conquered Croesus, Lydian domination</page><page sequence="24">Proceedinzgs for I9I6 xxiii gave place to Persian. The voice of protest against the inevitable, the recurring note of freedom, can be heard frequently in the writings of the sympathetic historian of Ionia (Hdt. i, I64; 4, 137; 5, 78). The revolt from the government of Darius finally ended in the sea-fight at Lade in 496 B.C., when disunion in the Greek ranks was attended with disaster. The tragic fall of Miletus was the culminating blow. Ionia had borne the lighted torch of civilization for half a mil- lennium. It was here that true democracy was born, with its fundamental idea of io-ovow'a, perfect equality of all civil and politi- cal rights. It was here that the alphabet, brought by the Phoeni- cians, received its final shape, before it was carried by the Greeks to the civilized world. Here was the home of epic and elegiac poetry, of history and geography, of natural science and philosophy, where a great impulse was given to architecture, sculpture, paint- ing, and kindred arts. Here lived Hecataeus, Herodotus, Anaxi- mander, Thales, Heraclitus, Pythagoras, Anaxagoras, Xenophanes, Mimnermus, Anacreon, and, above all, the immortal Homer. 8. Inorganic R6les in Roman Comedy, by Professor Henry W. Prescott, of the University of Chicago. The paper was an attempt both to present, in synthetic form, the main features of inorganic roles, with their function in the plays, and to determine the significance of the similarity and dissimilarity of Euripidean tragedy and Hellenistic comedy in this phase of dramatic technique. The r6les were discussed in their relation to the three main divisions of the plot: exposition, complication, and solution. The similarity between comedy and tragedy is most apparent in the use of inorganic roles to assist in exposition and denouement; this similarity is not inevitably a proof of close de- pendence of comedy upon tragedy; for as the beginning and the end of dramatic action present usually greater difficulties than the middle, any employment of mechanical devices common to both comedy and tragedy may be, to a large extent, independent of any historical relation between the two types. On the other hand, comedy and tragedy differ in the use of inorganic r6les to assist in the complications of the plot; the tragic plot makes little use of such r6les; comedy freely employs loosely organized and temporary roles even after the difficulties of exposition are solved. To some extent this may be due to the difference in general character of</page><page sequence="25">xxiv Americana Philological Association the tragic and the comic plot; but a notable feature of the use of inorganic roles in this part of the comic plot is the extent to which they are employed to perform the function of a chorus in filling intervals of time; the significance of this will be discussed in a larger context. The general result of the argument was the sug- gestion that comedy and tragedy are quite independent of each other; comedy, issuing from earlier stages in which organic unity was minimized, revels in inorganic roles; in the protatic role (already established, however, in Old Comedy), in the IoSzo ex miiachinia (Crito in the Andria, Callidamates in the Mostellaria, Gripus in the Rudens, Syncerastus in the Poenulus, illustrating in various degrees the mechanical use of roles to assist in the denoue- ment), and in a few other roles, there are apparent points of contact with tragedy, but these only reveal a common use of mechanical devices to surmount common difficulties. 9. The Sources of the History of Alexander the Great, by Professor R. B. Steele, of Vanderbilt University. This paper reviewed and criticised the conclusions in the work of Frinkel, Die Qzuellen (eir Alexaauder/zistoriker, Breslau, I883. The effort to determine from short quotations the length of passages which Plutarch, Strabo and other writers gleaned from their prede- cessors is criticised on the ground that the larger part of the quota- tions in Plutarch are merely incidental and throw no light on the source from which the context was derived. Plutarch mentions several writers of the affairs of Alexander whose works have perished, so that conclusions based only on the works which have come down to us can, at the best, be only problematical. Trhe hypothesis that there were several Alexander writers between the time of Clitarchus and that of Diodorus is a necessary one for the development of the scheme of FrHnkel, but it presupposes that the later writers could not do for themselves the task which is assigned to these auctores cx coniectuira.

The change from V7roKXLaWV (Mss.) to VlroKatwv was an early correc- tion by Casaubon. For X7rAE/3(ov, the correction of Schtitz, we may compare Homer, IZ. I, 462-463; Od. III, 341; Ap. Rhod. Arg.

It is also customary, even if not regular, for an ana- paestic dimeter catalectic closing a system to be preceded by a dipody. These dipodies are at times completed by the insertion of glosses, as in Pers. 6, Aapctoycvr/ Aapeiov vtog. drvp(ov Epwv is correctly interpreted by the scholiast: ri-v Ovcv rjv MoLp&amp;v KaF r,v 'Eptvv'wv a' KacL v?qcAta KaXECTrat. The metaphori- cal interpretation of the words as (i) rejected sacrifice, (2) the offering of Iphigeneia, (3) unholy rites (the marriage of Paris and Helen), are purely subjective, not to say imaginative, in character. Such interpretations are fully discussed and rejected by L. R. Farnell in Class. Rev. xi, 293. The words should be taken in their literal and technical meaning and referred to the Fates, Furies, etc., as the scholiast indicates and as Farnell clearly proves. The expression is not uncommon and Aeschylus may have taken it from Pindar, 0. 7, 88 (tEpOik 'arpotg). The fireless rites of the Furies are substantiated, not refuted, by Eum. io8. The Fates were wor- shiped with the same rites as the Furies, as seen from Paus. ii, I I, 4 and the scholiast as cited. The contrast is between v7roKaLWv, i.e. offerings to the gods above, and svrXEtd,wv, those to the chthonian deities. This contrast is clearly made and is evident in the entire passage: compare vraTcrov and xOov^v (v. 89) -the same anti- thesis - where the thought is directly reproduced. The words a&amp;rv'pv tepopv must be taken as partitive genitive, as might perhaps be inferred from Farnell's note, though he adduces no proof or argument. They go with ew7rtAXEowv, as under their technical meaning they can have no connection with opyas adTEvEag. The rather unusual use of the genitive is paralleled elsewhere by similar expressions: Hes. Op. 596, TpLS v'Sarog rpoX&amp;wetv, certainly an extremely similar passage and closely, even if not exactly, parallel; Theocr. 2, i5 2, aKpaTw ?rtxEtTo. Other instances are mostly in prose or late, as Herodian V, 5 7, cr7rEv&amp;Lv oi'vov; Luc. JJ. Zrag. 35, flkafcf rXv rtXEtv. The meaning and use of nXEIt/3w need not be entirely restricted to liquid offerings, just as Ovu'w is not confined to those by fire. It is improbable, however, that other than liquid</page><page sequence="27">xxvi American Philological Association gifts are here intended. The remarks of A. D. Godley, Class. Rev. xxv, 73 and Arthur Platt,Journ. of Phil. XXXII, 43 are not pertinent to my discussion and involve as well conjectures or transpositions of text not readily defensible. OpyaS a&amp;T1VELZ is to be referred to the Gods, the Fates, the Furies (vv. 55 ff.), though Zeus, o KpELG-cTWV (6o), 0 $E'Vtos (6i), is the pre- dominant idea. (It is perhaps relevant here to note that Zeus Hypatos (cf. v7raTro, 55) was worshiped on the Acropolis at Athens with bloodless offerings.) Because of this double character appease- ment must be wrought, if possible, by viorKa6wv and .'rOwEX,/wv. But, as the passage states, the decision of Fate, or of Zeus who stands therefor, cannot be checked or changed by any kind of sacrifice. If the application of the expression be thus limited and defined, the words Jpya's dTEPE73 would hardly denote " excessive anger," as often rendered, for the Fates as such are without emotion. a7riVpWv LpEUv could also not be taken in connection therewith, whatever the meaning assigned to the latter expression. However, the separation of the two ideas, Zeus and the Fates, is the more apparent. On 7rapa0E'Xat the scholiast gives XELTE 'tro roTL. This is entirely possible and can be supported by syntactical usage. The correct explanation, however, is undoubtedly the omission of the definite article with participle used substantively; cf. Ktihner-Gerth3, I, p. 6o8, i; Soph. El. 697, vvatr ovo' rXvo)v VyEZvi Aesch. Ag. 39, 59, I80, 393 (nom.), 413, 455, 696, 7o6, 840, etc.; and elsewhere both in poetry and prose. This is merely the epic usage in which Aeschylus abounds. It survives most frequently in the oblique cases, but instances of the nominative are easily found. A more definite force than is given by the insertion of rTt is needed in the passage and is hereby added. The conception is of course general in character. The translation will then be: "Nor will he who kindles sacrifice to the Olympians or offers fireless rites to the Chthonians charm into abeyance their temper stern (unyielding)." 0ap/Laaao,uEV1q XPV,uaToI ayvov MaXaKa't aloOXotUt wapqyoptat&amp; 7rcXavv /tvx6GEv flaotXEov.- 94-96. In line 96 the Medicean Ms. (M) reads: 7rcXavJ pxxo'Oev /3aot'XcCw. The scholiumn to the line is as follows: XdE,7EL KO[ktyOjLEvow. Neither the Ms. reading nor the scholium is apparently found in the later Mss. Consequently the line has generally been written by editors: 7rEXa'vp uvXoOEv /3aUXct'(L. The reading 7rEXav0 in M has been noted,</page><page sequence="28">Proceedings for I9I6 xxvii but not /3aotTXELt. The importance of the scholium in the present instance had been minimized or entirely disregarded, and the dative case has been adopted seemingly without argument. 7rEXavio was held an obvious mistake of the Ms. for 7rEXavwt (or 7rEXavWL), and as sufficiently refuted by the reading /3aatXEAtt, which, however, the Ms. does not have. The scholium was thought so evident a mis- take as to be changed by Stanley to KOtC,OfVp, a conjecture gen- erally accepted. There exists, then, the alternative of the omission of the v with 7rEXav&amp; and J3autXELO, as is certainly indicated by the scholium K0,LC0JLEOVOV, or of the omission of the iota subscript, or rather adscript, with the same words. Iota subscript, as is well known, probably does not date from earlier than the I2th century, and consequently does not appear in M (saec. x-xi). In the Ms. then, this iota is commonly written as adscript by the first hand or added slightly above the line by a later hand. The 403 lines of the Oxford Classical Text, represent- ing so much of the Agamemnon as is contained in M, exhibit 46 instances of iota subscript. Of these, nine must be eliminated as being corruptions of text, in rasura in the Ms., true variants, or, as the present two, under discussion. Of the remaining thirty-seven, twenty-nine have iota adscript written by the first or second hand. In the eight remaining instances the iota has been omitted alto- gether. Six of these are datives but found in the same sentence in agreement with other words which have the iota adscript or are datives of the consonant declension; one is in the phrase &amp;L' yXAr(r0 (36); the eighth is in the verb form r1-EVq (I5o). In no single instance has the iota adscript been omitted, even by the first hand (by which it is mostly written), where the slightest am- biguity could result. The scribe would hardly, then, in the present instance, where either genitive or dative might be syntactically possible, have made such an omission with both words. The scholium KOULLOIE'VWV of course indicates an earlier reading in the genitive case. The dropping of the v is difficult of solution. How- ever, either a capital or cursive exemplar would account for the error by a case similar to haplography: NM or ,u,u; the eye omit- ting, in 7reXavuv yuxo'OEv, the first of two similar letters, and uncon- sciously assimilating /3aoat'XEov to the form of the noun; especially as the dropping of the letter in no way influences the meter of the line. It is of course well kniown that the iota adscript was regularly</page><page sequence="29">xxviii Americanz Philological Association omitted in the Mss. of the first centuries of the Christian era, and the complete history of its omission covers a long period of tradi- tion. I have merely endeavored to show that palaeographically, so far as the Medicean is concerned, the reading vEXavov has equal authority with WrEXavoL. WVhether the insertion of iota adscript in M is due to the superior knowledge of the scribe or the peculiar excellence of the Ms. from which he copied cannot of course be told. The omission of the sign for v, so common in this Ms. and in others, is an obvious and common palaeographical error and can perfectly account for the loss of the letter, especially at the end of the line. Paley once read (4th ed., 1879): 7rcavy KlVXOyOEV 3aa-tEItWv, " the thick essence from the inmost stores of the palace," but apparently by conjecture only, and wrongly interpreting /3ao-tAXiWv. Others, such as Blaydes, Enger, etc., represent the ordinary view that /3ao-t- XE'w is to be taken with ALvX0OEv, " with the cake from the royal re- cesses." Such extreme hypallage is not easy to parallel in Greek. A less frequent interpretation is that of Conington and Headlam, "with the royal (i.e. choice, excellent) cake from within." This connotation of " choiceness of quality " is well attested by such phrases as: fl3ao-tXtKoV facp(LaKOV; /3acLTLKOV axavov; /3acLOV cTVKOV /3aoIEtov J3So ,Vf'pov (Hesychius); /3aolX,tov ,aVpoV (Crates and Sappho quoted by Athen. 690 d, e)-cf.

The plural use of 7rEXavo's is well supported in tragic usage, and in the sense of 7rEWcaTrCL, " cakes for sacrifice," the plural form seems to be preferred to the singular. Oily cakes were as suitable as oil for feeding the flames of the altars, if it were so desired. We may compare Eur. lro. I063, aEXavwV 4Xo7c; Id. HJYyp. 147, Ov'rwV 7rEXavwv; Id.

Tolman, of Vanderbilt University. The final Indo-Iranian a is generally indicated by scrzitio plena, giving graphically a, e.g. gen. sg. hyd &lt; I. E. - syo, i pl. act. ma &lt; I. E.- me, 2 pl. act. ta &lt; Ar.- ta, 3 sg. mid.- t &lt; . E. - to, 3 pl. - "ta &lt; I. E. - nto. We believe that this system of writing was not intended to indicate the presence of a long vowel, but rather that the cuneiform sign for a follows the vowel sound inherent in the preceding consonant for the purpose of more accu- rately marking its distinct character. A good illustration of the necessity of graphical representation of a even when not final is seen in such a gen. sg. as cispidp-si (Bh. 1, 5-6). Etymologically we should have ci.pazs, but if written Caisapais (as in Bk. a, 8) it is not to be distinguished from the nom. sg. cispis. The form cispais, thus written and correctly transliterated, does not mean that the gen. sg. of zistems in Ancient Persian ended in ais, but that ais is simply a graphic representation of ais for the purpose of differen- tiating this case form from that of the nom. sg. zs. We wish we could see thus plainly the reason for scriptio ple;za in cases of final a. Since final i and v are always reinforced by their corresponding semi-vowels (e.g. aitiyv, paluv) except before enclitics (e.g. api- maziy, haui - ciy), it appears that it was a characteristic of the Ancient Persian to fortify a final vowel by a distinctive sign. We believe that the writing of the a-sign after the a-sound inherent in the preceding consonant (thus forming graphically a a = a) is simply this same tendency to support the find vowel a of the Indo- Iranian period. This seems all the more conclusive because scri tio Plena never occurs in the case of an apparent final a caused by</page><page sequence="31">xxx American Philological Association phonetic change within the Ancient Persian itself, e.g. nom. sg. a &lt; Ar. - as &lt; I.E. - os; abara &lt; I. E. *ebheret. When this support is made no longer necessary through the presence of an enclitic the historic quantity appears in scr45/io defectiva, e.g. manaa (mand) but mana-ca, Slav. mene; avadaa (avadda) but avada-sis, where the suffix dla is cognate to the Skt. -ha. We should expect also that protection to a final vowel would not be required in cases of composition and juxtaposition, e.g. paru zananam (beside paruz' - zandna-). In like manner we have ava/zya - radiy beside avahyd. The collocation aurahya mazdaha inflects the two meembers without graphical representationi of final a in -hya, owing doubtless to the influence of the composite char- acter of the words, while in mazdi/ha the final a &lt; Ar. as is not an Indo-Iranian final. Where the word is written - mazdaiha the final vowel seems to be treated erroneously by the stone-cutter as if it were in that class. The influence of juxtaposition preserves a in the combination of name + month, e.g. a driyahya mnd/yd. This is seen sometimes in the case of the genitive preceding the noun, e.g. uvaxstrahya taumaya. It seems to the writer that the mooted question of nania and nama comes under this head of juxtaposition. It is this influence which causes scriptio plena where the preceding fem. nom. gives to the phrase something of a composite character (Tolman, Anc. Pers. Lexicon, Ios). In two cases (B/. 3, 39; 46) we have a in gen. sg. - hya where the word lies entirely outside the influence of composition or juxta- position. So too dha,ta occurs in B/h. 3, 49; 5 '. It is interesting to note that in these four examples the following word begins with a short vowel. It would, however, be hazardous to conjecture any influence of sandhi here since scriptio plena is used before vowels in two occurrences of akhaXt, B/h. 2, 77; 3, 75. The 3 sg. pret. aha (in place of *ast) is probably the perfect (cf. Skt. asa), but it is likely that a final f was added from the imperfect, *ahat &gt; aha. This theory would explain the failure to express aha (Skt. asa) by scrijptio plena. 12. An Attempt to Explain Tense Usage in Cicero's Ora- tions, by Elizabeth McJimsey Tyng, of the Packer Collegiate Institute.</page><page sequence="32">Proceedings for I9I6 xxxi The accepted explanations of the tenses of the Latin verb are unsatisfactory for four reasons, which become evident from a con- sideration of the explanations themselves: i. There is no real antithesis between the statement that the aorist expresses an idea viewed absolutely, and the traditional ex- planations of the imperfect. 2. It is often impossible to decide from the context whether an aorist or a present perfect is intended. 3. The accepted explanations do not show why all three tenses of past time may be used to express an idea completed in either past or present time. 4. They prevent placing the tenses of the subjunctive in exact correspondence with the tenses of the indicative. The solution of the difficulty can be found in an examination of the typical uses of the past tenses. The perfect, whether used as aorist or as present perfect, expressing the past idea as prior to a present situation or as absolute, must view that idea from the speaker's standpoint; that is, it must express an idea of importance to the speaker. On the other hand, the imperfect, expressing an idea that is a part of a past situation, and the pluperfect, expressing an idea that is prior to a past situation, are unimportant to the speaker except in their relation to that situation. My conclusions may be summed up in five statements: i. The tenses of the indicative and the subjunctive are identical in meaning except for the difference in mood. 2. The tenses indicate time merely by showing that an idea is present, past, or future. 3. The perfect expresses a past idea that is shown by the con- text to be important to the speaker's argument. 4. The imperfect expresses an unimportant past idea viewed as a part of some situation. 5. The pluperfect expresses an unimportant past idea viewed merely as prior to some situation. A few examples may serve to make the above statements clearer: PERFECT Phil. xiv, i7, dixerim. Cicero's plea in his owrn behalf was, as the parenthesis shows, not regarded by him merely as a purpose. ProArch. 9, veneri/. The passage states the characteristics of the three praetors, with the result clause used by Cicero to empha- size his statement about Lentulus.</page><page sequence="33">xxxii Americanr Philological Association Pro Deiot. 24, habuit. The perfect gives Cicero's apology for the character of the troops that Deiotarus had sent Caesar. IMPERFECT Pl/il. xi, I I, dicebat. The contrast is between verbo and re; therefore dicebat is unimportant. Phil. xiiI, 26, iubebat. It is really the infinitive caedi that identi- fies Varius. Pro Rose. Com. 3o, explodebatur. The development of the argu- ment is as follows: The reputation of Roscius benefited Eros, who went to him because of failure and through his help became a successful actor. In Pis. 3o, dicerent. The objection to the consuls is indicated by the infinitive metuere. PLUPERFECT Pro Leg. Maizil. 17, proposuerarn Phil. v, 27, miserat, in Cat. IV, i , frequentasset. These pluperfects, all prior to a present time, are merely parenthetical and in no way add to the idea ex- pressed by the sentence. The above conclusions are based on an examination of all result clauses and exceptions to sequence in Cicero's orations, together with all dependent indicatives and subjunctives from orations repre- senting his entire career. Among these verbal forms - a total of over 6ooo -there are only 24 which much be admitted as excep- tions. They occur only in certain passages in the Philippics, where the reference is clearly to the present and to the future, as for instance, Phil. xI, 31, huvissent, fecissent, videretur.</page><page sequence="34">Proceedings for I9I6 xxXiii PHILOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE PACIFIC COAST I.

MINUTES The Philological Association of the Pacific Coast held its Eight- eenth Annual Meeting on Friday and Saturday, December i and 2, 19I6, in the California School of Fine Arts, San Francisco, Professor Walter Morris Hart, of the University of California, presiding. FIRST SESSION Friday morning, December i. The minutes of the last Annual Meeting having been published in the PROCEEDINGS for 1915, the chair ruled that it would not be neces- sary to read them. The Secretary read instead the record of a meeting of the Executive Committee held February 26, I9I6, and reported orally the results of the mneeting of the same Committee held just before the opening of this session. One recommendation of the Committee was that the annual dues be raised to $ 3.50. It was moved and seconded that the recommendation of the Committee be adopted. On motion the final vote on the question was post- poned till the end of the fourth session. A request from southern members for permission to hold a summer meeting of the Association in Southern California was referred to the new Executive Committee with power to act. The Treasurer presented the following report: RECEIPTS Balance on hand November 27, 1915 . . . . . . . . $I64.72 Dues ..... . . . . . . . . . . . . . 309.00 Interest . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6.15 $479.87 EXPENDITURES Sent to Professor Moore (June 6, I9I6) . . . . . . $240.00 Printing and stationery . . . . . . . . . . . . 36.80 Postage .... . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25.88 Stenographer for Secretary . . . . . . . . . . 10.10 Addressograph plates . . . . . . . . . . . . 5.42 Janitor (2 years) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4.00 Miscellaneous .1... . . . . . . . . . . . 1.30 Balance on hand December i, I9I6 . . . . . . . . 156.37 $479.87 On motion the Treasurer's report was received.</page><page sequence="37">xxxvi Association of the Pacific Coast The Chair appointed the following committees: Auditing: Professors Deutsch, Paschall, and Johnston.

Tzime and Place of Next Meeting: Professors Bradley, Foster, and Linforth. Social: Professors Cooper, Tatlock, Richardson. The number of persons attending this session was forty. SECOND SESSION Friday afternoon. This session was devoted entirely to the reading and discussion of papers. There were fifty-two persons present. rHIRD SESSION Friday evening. Through the generosity of the University Club of San Francisco a private dining-room was turned over to the men of the Association for this session. After dining together the thirty members present listened to the address of the President, which was followed by im- promptu remarks on the same topic by President Belnjamin Ide Wheeler, Professor Paul Shorey, and several others. FOURTH SESSION Saturday morning, December 2. The Secretary read the recommendations of the Executive Com- mittee concerning annual dues of members, and said that the recom- mendations were to be construed as a proposed amendnment to Article IV, Section i, of the Constitution. The recommendations, which were approved by unanimous vote, read: I. That the annual dues of members shall be three dollars and fifty cents. 2. That of this amount the sum of two dollars and fifty cents shall be paid to either the American Philological Association or the Modern Language Associa- tion of America, as individual members may prefer. 3. That such members as pay their dues before the ist of March shall be en- titled to all the privileges of membership in the national organization of their choice, for that year, and those who pay after the ist of March shall be entitled to all these privileges except that of having their names appear in the alphabeti- cal list of members published in the TRANSACTIONS AND PROCEEDINGS of the</page><page sequence="38">Proceedings for I9I6 xxxvii American Philological Association, or the PUBLICATIONS of the Modern Language Association of America, as the case may be. 4. That for such members as desire to be enrolled in both national bodies the annual dues shall be six dollars. It is understood that the provisions of these recommendations are to go into effect only provided the arrangement is acceptable to the two national organizations. The Auditing Committee reported the accounts and vouchers of the Treasurer correct and in perfect order. On motion the report was adopted. A vote of thanks was extended to the Regents of the University of California, the Directors of the California School of Fine Arts, and the Directors of the University Club, for their hospitality. The Nominating Committee nominated the following officers, who on motion were elected for the year I9I6-I917: President, 0. M. Johnston. Vice-Presidents, H. C. Nutting, G. Chinard. Secretary, W. A. Cooper. Treasurer, B. 0. Foster. Executive Committee, the above-named officers, and M. E. Deutsch, P. J. Frein, A. Gaw, and F. 0. Mower. The choice of the time and place of the next meeting was left to the discretion of the Executive Committee. Thirty-five persons attended this session. The following persons were elected to membership: Prof. Howard L. Bruce, of the University of California. Leslie G. Burgevin, of the University of California. Gabriel H. Grojean, of Stanford University. Dr. Irvin C. Hatch, Polytechnic High School, San Francisco. Prof. Benjamin Roland Lewis, of the University of Utah. Miss Laurence Helene P6chin, High School of Commerce, San Francisco. Miss Anna M. Tietjen, High School of Commerce, San Francisco. Prof. Eliza G.

La gran comedia de los farmosos hechios de Mudarra, by Professor Clifford G. Allen, of the Leland Stanford Junior University. The story of the seven infantes of Lara is found in various chronicles and ballads. The latter are the principal source of this drama. Of the six old ballads (romances viejos) which treat of this sub- ject the author seems to have used only two, Conviddrame a corner in the first lornaMda and A cazar va Don Rodrigo in the second. The ballads which he knew best were the later ballads of Se- pu'Ilveda and of the Rosa Espaiola published by Timoneda. As the ballads in the Rosa Espaniola are in many cases imitations of Sepu'lveda's ballads, it is often impossible to tell whether the origi- nal or the imitation was the source, but the author of the drama inay have used as many as nine of these later ballads. These ballads are, in the first lornada: Muy grande era el lamentar (Sepulveda), Liorando estai Doia Lambra (Rosa Espaniola), Los s/ete infanfes de Lara (Sepulveda), Siete cabezas los moros (Rosa Es/a- inola), Ese buzen Gonzalo Gutstios (Sepuilveda), Una herniana de Alinanzor (Sepuflveda) and Gonzalo Gustios sacado (Rosa Espaiola); in the third: De CUrdoba la nomnbrada (Sept'lveda) and Sale Mu- darra Gonzdlez (Rosa Espanol). The introduction to the first lornada and the larger part of the second and third lornadas are original. The drama in its turn served as the source of at least one ballad, Sentados a un aledrez, and perhaps of others. 2. The Fifth-Century Proscenium, by Professor James T. Allen, of the University of California. A discussion of some of the inconsistencies in the current views regarding the stage-buildings of the early Attic theater, including that of Fiechter (Die baugeschichtliche Entwickluzg des antiken Theaters; see Class. Phil. xii, 2I4). The simplest explanation is that the proscenium of the fifth century closely resembled that of the Hellenistic period. The prothyra depicted in Hellenistic vase-paintings, etc., afford no evidence for the reconstruction of the fifth-century building.</page><page sequence="40">Proceedings for I9I6 xxxix 3. Swinburne as an English Pindar, by Dr. William Chis- lett, Jr. On the basis of the number and general excellence of Swin- burne's Greek, Greek-English, English and Swinburnian Pindarics, the speaker proposed a somewhat higher position for Swinburne in the Pindaric tradition than is commonly assigned him. 4. English box 'cuff,' ' veer,' box ' seated apartment in a theatre,' box pleat, German bugsen, bugsieren 'tow,' 'drag away,' ' eject,' etc., by Professor George Hempl, of the Leland Stanford Junior University.

Some Aspects of the Modern English Verb-Adverb Compound, by Dr. Arthur G. Kennedy, of the Leland Stan- ford Junior University. The combination of the verb with a prepositional adverb is be- coming more common. The variation in the closeness of combina- tion makes an attempt at absolute classifications impracticable, but certain generalizations can be made. The combination with up (e.g. to furnish up, to clear up) is by far the most common. The effects of this combination are both syntactical and semasiological. Verbs ordinarily transitive become intransitive, and vice versa. The compound may take an object of an entirely different nature from that of the simple verb. New meanings are given to the verbs. Often the particle is merely perfective or intensive. Occa- sionally the particle is unnecessary, tho it seldom fails to add a slight force to the verb. Most of the verbs thus compounded are monosyllabic and of Anglo-Saxon origin. While many of these compounds are regarded generally as colloquialisms or slang, they are being used with in- creasing frequency by writers and public speakers, so that no satisfactory line can be drawn between good and bad usage. Often compounds have several meanings, some colloquial, some of good literary standing.</page><page sequence="41">xl Associatzon of the Pacific Coast While figurative usage is undoubtedly the early and primary cause of this tendency to combine, its later growth is influenced also by a desire to strengthen or emphasize the simple verb, by a tendency to add to the categories into which these combinations often fall, by a certain striving for a rhythmical effect at times, and by a sort of linguistic laziness, which prefers to combine fewer well-known verbs with a few particles rather than remember longer and more highly specialized verbs. The tendency is Germanic in nature and often conducive to a simpler, more forceful diction. But if it goes too far there is danger that it will eliminate some more highly specialized and desirable verbs, encourage slovenliness in speech, and increase the possibilities of misunderstanding the meaning of the speaker or writer by emphasizing word-combination and sentence-context rather than word-individuality. 6. Some Etymologies by Cassiodorus, by Professor W. A. Merrill, of the University of California. Cassiodorus, in his commentary on the Psalms, gives the ety- mology of 66 words, of which 58 are nouns, 2 adjectives, and 6 verbs. He agrees with both Varro and Isidorus in 8 cases, with Varro alone in 4, and with Isidorus alone in i8. Presumably where this agreement occurs the derivation was traditional. In the other cases we may infer originality until further investigation is made. Like all other ancient etymologizers his methods are arbitrary and uncritical: typical examples are uxor from ut soror (I27, 3), mensa from mnezsis (22, 6), lacus from latet (7, i 6), frenum- a fero retinenido (31, 13), olera from ol/a (36, i), fois from refovere (67, 30), limIs from ligans hzumum (68, 2), dorsum from deorsum (68, 25), pa/ma from pacis a/ma (9I, 12), stagna from stando (io6, 35), barbarnis from barba and rms (I13, i), lac from liquor (ii8, 70), lax from parcendo or pascendo (121, 7), sera from the adverb sero (147, 2), and gemitus from geminatus luctus (6, 7). 7. Ruben Dario, a Cosmopolitan Poet, by Professor S. Griswold Morley, of the University of California. A consideration of some of the mental attributes of Ruben Dario, the Nicaraguan, who, at the time of his death (Feb. 6, I9I6), was the acknowledged leader of Spanish poetry. He had few of the characteristics usually associated with Spanish literature, and his mind was far more Parisian than Castilian.</page><page sequence="42">Proceedings for I9i6 xli 8. Some Germanic Etymologies, by Professor Clarence Paschall, of the University of California. i. bleibs Instead of an I. E. *bhlei-, it is quite likely that we have in blezbs a contracted form corresponding to the verb bileiban. The older meaning of bi- was apparently 'round about.' It might designate a condition of rest, as in bisitan; a comprehensive motion, as in Ger. begrezfen; the reverse of this, as in biaukan; motion toward the object, as in bigitan; or the reverse of this, as in bininman and bizeiban. Originally the verbal stem could be used to express either 'going' or ' coming' (cf. galei;an). An older meaning of the adjective may be preserved in He/ga Kviba Hiind- ingsbana II, 25, ,bat's bli,bara an br-imis domar. Here Gering trans- lates bli,bara with ' zutraglicher.' 'Das bekommt dir besser' would render it. One might translate into Latin with ' convenit.' In fact bekommen and convenire are analogous to Germanic *biilban both as to formation and as to meaning. The original concrete idea may have been that of 'gathering about some one.' The meaning ' compassionate,' ' sympathetic ' is a connecting link between this idea and the later and more abstract meanings. 2. Bild In Ger. Bild we probably have the same compound, only here the meaning of the prefix continued to be strongly felt, and it was the stem vowel which suffered reduction. The word retains the oldest meaning of the verb, namely, 'to move around.' It was the shadow that moved around a person or an object -the first image that primitive man saw. The 0. H. G. spellings, pilidi, pilodi, piladi are exactly what one might expect in the case of a vowel which had become obscure and was on the point of com- plete extinction. 3- gageigan Like the other two words, gageigan contains an unrecognized prefix- in this case ga. The stem was Germanic *igan &lt; *kan, which, with the prefix, formed * ia-Zgan &gt; *g1gan. \When the contraction had taken place the ga- was no longer felt, and the perfective meaning resulted in the prefixing of a second ga. We have an analogous case in Ger. gegessen. Gageigan is to be con- nected with aigan. The Germanic languages agree in having a</page><page sequence="43">xlii Association of the Pacjftc Coast preterite present aih or a form derived from it. Gagezgin meant 'to gain.' A/ih meant originally 'I have gained.' Later it came to mean 'I possess.' Grammatical change and levelling easily account for the different forms. 9. Bianca Maria di Challant, Heroine of Giacosa's Drama La signora di Cliallant, as a Romantic Type, by Professor Stanley A. Smith, of the Leland Stanford Junior University. This character has seemed inconsistent and enigmatical to cer- tain critics. While agreeing to a certain extent with the first charge, the writer of this paper thinks that Giacosa's conception of his heroine was clearly that of the stock romantic type of the mis- understood and erring woman regenerated through pure love. The argument is based (i) upon an analysis of the source of the play, viz., the fourth Novella, Part i, of Bandello; (2) upon a careful examination of the play itself; (3) upon Giacosa's own discussion of the character of Bianca Maria, found in Chapter vi of his Castelli valdostani e canavesani. lo. Dramatic Irony from Chaucer to Hardy, by Professor John S. P. Tatlock, of the Leland Stanford Junior University. Dramatic irony involves something said or done, the surface meaning of which strongly contrasts, unknown to the sayer or doer, with something elsewhere in the same story. A sinister, or comic, or gentle light shines back on it, or forward, from some- thing which we, the favored audience, know or may foresee. Sometimes the emotional effect is humorous or satiric, sometimes genial and cheering, sometimes pathetic or tragic, sometimes gen- erally heightening and intensifying. Among numerous English writers who employ dramatic irony with skill, perhaps the most skilful are Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Thomas Hardy.</page><page sequence="44">INDEX Arabic numerals refer to pages of the Transactions, Roman to the Proceedings a: v.
