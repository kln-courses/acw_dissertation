<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROBERT S. LOPEZ. The Three Ages of the Italian Renaissance. Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia. 1970. Pp. 103. $6.oo. In this slim volume, which originated as three lectures at the University of Virginia, Robert Lopez presents an impressionistic panorama of the Italian Renaissance with wit, illumi- nating flashes of insight, and what seems at times deliberate wrong-headedness. Through- out he makes imaginative use of the time- honored anthropomorphic conception of a civ'lization as passing through the successive stages of organic growth. "It is pleasant to think [he writes] of the Italian Renaissance as a lovely creature, whose youth, maturity and old age should be defined within limits not exceeding too much the possible life span of a woman" (p. 7). The limits he proposes have "at least an uncontroversial political significance": for the youth of the Renais- sance, the years 1454-94; for its maturity, 1494-1527; for its declining years, 1527-59. Those who feel that the initial date suggests an unduly retarded childhood or adolescence may-or may not-be disarmed by his pro- posal that we "let her be born, like Botticelli's Venus, full grown in her prime." In a brief review it is impossible to com- ment on even the high points of this rapid survey, ranging as it does from economic trends, on which the author's opinions are well known, through the fields of literature, art, social manners, morals, and religion, on all of which he expresses opinions based about equally on wide acquaintance with the ma- terial and highly personal intiutions. It is in these latter fields particularly that he finds the attitudes appropriate to youth, maturity, and senescence-respectively a mood of con- fident expectation, a fluctuation between self- assurance and disenchantment, and, finally, despondence-each "in turn paramount dur- ing the three ages of the Renaissance within the chronological boundaries just traced" (p. 8). One can only add that this book is a delight to read, and that where one would argue with the author one can only hope that his own position might be stated with such disarming wit and epigrammatic precision.
