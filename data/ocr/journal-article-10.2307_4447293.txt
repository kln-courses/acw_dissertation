BOOK REVIEWS 335</page><page sequence="2">The book is designed for readers twelve or more years old. Simple and non-technical language is used. Many of the scientific terms used are in boldface type and defined in a 14-page glossary. Picturesque language is used throughout the book to explain some very abstract topics. Illustrations are used to both ex- plain concepts and provoke questions. Because of the topics covered, the language used, and the useful illustra- tions, young readers should find this short book interesting. However, because cosmology and evolution are abstract ideas, many young readers may not understand parts of the book. The author's attempt to use simple explanations may mislead some young readers. For example, atoms are depicted as "hooked together" to form molecules; and chlorophyll is described as a sub- stance that soaked up the rays of the sun and used the energy to make protein. The author's explanation of the "Big Bang" theory would leave most readers with the idea that in the beginning of the universe there was a primordial mass and a center to the explosion that occurred. Much of the discussion of natural se- lection has the "red in tooth and claw" flavor as fitness is often related to intense competition and drastic environmental changes. Other explanations are too simplistic and anthropomorphic. In explaining the evolution of mammals the author states: "But others discovered that the most de- licious meals around were to be found by breaking open reptile eggs." Some explanations are very mislead- ing. Some cells are depicted as using oxygen to make food. The author re- peatedly indicates that single strands of DNA, each with different messages and from two different parents, combined during sexual reproduction. Finally, the author is careless in dis- tinguishing between hypotheses, theo- ries, and facts. Many highly speculative hypotheses are used throughout the book, but are not identified as such. Despite these weaknesses, I would urge young students to read this book as an introduction to the topics considered. Gerald Skoog Texas Tech University Lubbock</page></plain_text>
