<plain_text><page sequence="1">SCIENCE AND SENSIBILITY IN CHAUCER'S CLERK* by Joseph B. Grennen In any discussion of the Clerk's Tale, it would be well to begin with Muscatine's incisive description of the poem as a version of con ventionalism. "It has some of the consequential logic of the Clerk's training," he says, "the clean abstractedness of his philosophy." And again, "the poem is quite plainly designed in imitation of no life' in any naturalistic sense, but as something abstract and formulated-" Our response to the actions of Walter and Griselda, as Muscatine phrases it, "demands no psychological motivation."1 Indeed, it is Chaucer's obvious lack of concern for realistic psychological portrai ture that to some extent justifies those readers who were taken to task by Sledd for their efforts to account for Walter's monstrous be havior by referring it to the otherworldly nature of his prototype in the Cupid and Psyche folktales.2 Probably no one would deny that Chaucer's artistic strategy for offsetting the limitations of any received story (or for exploiting its merits, for that matter) was to find the particular pilgrim whose pro fessional habitus made him seem the natural teller of the tale, and then to revise it with the kind of detail that makes it seem the in evitable, characteristic utterance of the pilgrim who recounts it. This in itself is admittedly no very profound observation, but it does seem that the degree of particularity with which Chaucer manages his strategy has rarely been fully appreciated. In discussions of the Clerk, it is too often the case that a general sense of his academic propensi ties?as a man given to fustian in his rhetoric and syllogism in his argument?serves to sum him up. Yet, a fuller acquaintance with the intellectual life-style of an Oxford scholastic of the late fourteenth century might conceivably sharpen our response to Chaucer's inten tion in this frequently baffling poem. A fruitful line of analysis was begun in 1958 by J. Mitchell Morse, *An earlier version of this paper was read, in May, 1970, at the Fifth Biennial Conference on Medieval Studies, sponsored by the Medieval Institute, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, Michigan. 1.

His rejoinder, in Morse's words, was to carry "realistic authoritarian ism to an extreme equally anti-social from the point of view of the emergent democratic consciousness."3 Without quite agreeing with Morse that the Clerk, in his concluding speech, contradictorily "sums up for nominalism," we may accept his central point. We must not, of course, lose sight of the fact that the Wife is not, like the Clerk, a philosopher. She knows a good deal about scole-matere, but she is fundamentally a technician practicing a very special craft. The Clerk, like any good academic of an earlier day, is essentially a theorist rather than an activist. In other words, if we are convinced that the best tales reify the sketchy typology of the teller s portrait we may be inclined to look for the ways in which the tale of patient Griselda ex emplifies not a particular doctrine of the schools, but the very con cept of "clerkliness." Wifehood, at least before Chaucer created Ali soun, was not a profession, and the poet manages things so that our central preoccupation is with the Wife's haecceitas. But the Clerk is less sharply defined as an individual, in the portrait as well as the tale, the emphasis being much more strongly reflective of the quidditas of the university scholar, who was, before all else, a logician. This would perhaps be especially the case with an Oxonian, if we are to believe the words of an end-of-the-century alumnus recalling the good old days when, just as "India gloried in jewels and Arabia in gold . . . the University of Oxford rejoiced in the multitude of its subtle logicians. . . "4 Harry Bailly's rather dry remark to the Clerk, "I trowe ye studie aboute som sophyme,"5 adverts to this reputation. Sophismata, such as those Chaucer's contemporaries?Heytesbury, Swineshead, and Dumbleton?tussled with, illustrate vividly the fact that the concern of the clerkly mind is with the imaginable rather than the possible (not to mention the usual or the likely). "The province of the logician," as Heytesbury's modern editor points out, "is the entire range of imag 3. J. Mitchell Morse, "The Philosophy of the Clerk of Oxenford," MLQ, 19 (1958), 15. 4.

The only requirement for an imagin able case or distinction or problem is that it should not involve a for mal logical contradiction; whether it is physically possible or not is a matter of indifference." Such propositions as "a man is an ass," or "Socrates will die today," are legitimate objects of logical examina tion.6 The Clerk's story reveals at every turn this professional, specu lative turn of mind, just as the Wife's manifests a rigorous sort of pragmatism. Such an antithesis, in fact, not only does not exclude but is actually a correlative to the realism/ nominalism antinomy mentioned above. Chaucer is at some pains in the Clerk's prologue to emphasize this difference, in the dialogue between Clerk and Host. Harry, for instance, admonishes him to abandon florid rhetoric in favor of "pleyn" speaking, to which the Clerk replies that he will do so "as fer as resoun axeth, hardily" (E 25). This stands in not so subtle opposition to the Wife's rallying cry of "experience." She is clearly a bizarre votary of what scholastics (in particular, natural philosophers) referred to as the via experientiae, just as the Clerk gradually emerges as an adherent of the via rationis (with its preference for "thought experiments," carried out, as they said, secundum imaginationem), a distinction going back to Galen's treatise De sectis, on the different schools of physicians.7 It is the Wife, in any case, who introduces the note of scientism, with her talk of the instrumentes of marriage, and the office to which they should be put?instrumenta and officium be ing two of the headings under which any art or science was to be examined from a technical point of view.8 Certainly the Pardoner takes her remarks in this sense, when he implies that her long opening apologia is a theorica of the science of matrimony by his interruption calling on her to "teche us yonge men of youre praktike." Technical diction, of course, is a device of characterization of which Chaucer is a master. The Man of Law speaks like a lawyer, the Mer chant like one whose life has centered on the driving of hard bargains, and so forth. The problem is to know at what point a characteristic 6.

In the case of the Clerk, however, even the academic termin ology with which he "saffrons his predicacioun" has generally gone un noticed. Robinson calls one line, "Noon accident for noon adversitee/ Was seyn in hire," apparently a technical usage.9 It is indeed a tech nical expression, probably a version of the scholastic dictum that "di versity and contrariety are found only in qualities [i.e. accidents], not in essences." But he uses a good many other technical terms, most of which have now passed into the common language and are thus missed by modern readers. For instance, the Clerk reports Griselda as asking the Sergeant to wind and wrap the child's body "with alle circumstances tendrely" (E 584); Griselda, after leaving Janicula's home for the palace is said to be "translated ... in swich richesse;" and so with other terms, such as collation, supposition, disposition, place, rest, motion, change, variation, void and constraint. His fussy precision about these terms is just what one expects from a pedant who is capable of the sort of bad academic joke with which he ends his prologue, when, referring to Petrarch's prohemium, which dis courses upon the twistings and turnings of the Po river, he declares (punning on the root meaning of conveho): And trewely, as to my juggement, Me thynketh it a thyng impertinent, Save that he wole conveyen his mateere. . . . (E 53-55) But idiosyncrasies of speech are far from the whole story. The quid ditas of a clerk, as Chaucer understood it, obviously had a number of very essential features: one important characteristic was his ade quation of wordes and werkes (the Clerk uses the phrase twice), with somewhat more importance being given to wordes, although a clerk's werkes usually turned out to be verbal constructs anyway. William of Ockham's position on the nature of natural science, for instance, was typical. Natural science was concerned not with natural substances, not with mobile objects, not with real things as they came to be and passed away, but with "intentions of the soul."10 Of course, Ockham is here merely making a distinction between the ob ject of a science and its subject matter, namely, the set of propositions 9.

Qerkhness also meant a professional habit of probation?proof. Any clerkly pro cess, intellectual or physical, was an ordered sequence of steps culmin ating naturally in a probatio. The common idiom "whan it cometh to the preef" (surviving, for instance, in Shakespeare's line, "A joy proposed, in proof a very woe") is merely a reflection of this sense of order. A clerk also, qua academic, lived at a considerable remove from the ordinary concerns of human feeling, a feature emphasized in the portrait?"full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse," to quote Eliot's variation on Chaucer's line?and it meant, for one thing, that he could examine human physical and moral behavior without the embarrassing encumbrance of personal emotion. This kind of profes sional gaucheness made possible the extension of the impetus theory to human psychology, and of the thermometric system to the descrip tion of bodily well-being in terms of degrees of health. One of the most ludicrous perversions of scientific achievement was the applica tion of the geometrical analyses which led to the development of the so-called Mertonian "mean speed theorem" to human conduct, so that it became possible to speak of "latitudes" of moral virtue. A. C. Crombie notes that "such elaborately subtle and entirely sterile mis applications of a method called down the ridicule of humanists like . . . Vives . . . and Pico della Mirandola . . . and made Erasmus groan when he remembered the lectures he had had to endure at the uni versity."11 There was, of course, another side to the life of a clerk, reflected in the fact that the word clericus has yielded the modern English "cleric" as well as "clerk." In the final analysis, all his scholastic studies were propaedeutics to the study of theology, his university career a preparation for his pastoral mission. This dichotomy is well exemplified in the life of Robert Grosseteste, who excelled as poet, then as philosopher and theologian, founded what is now regarded as the beginning of a true scientific tradition, and then spent the long final portion of his career in episcopal administration. Chaucer paid a nod, perhaps, to this tension between the academic and the pastoral by balancing the Clerk's fondness for Aristotle with his speech "sownynge in moral vertu." Such imperfect adjustment of learning to life underlay, of course, much of the humanist thrust for reform. This refers, obviously, not to the great scholastic teachers, but to their pettifogging imitators, of whom Chaucer must have known many. It is hard to escape the feeling that in a muted and even a some 11. A. C. Crombie, Augustine to Galileo (London: Falcon Press, 1952), p. 268.</page><page sequence="6">86 SCIENCE AND SENSIBILITY IN CHAUCER's CLERK what sympathetic fashion Chaucer anticipated, in his Clerk's Tale, the later humanist reaction to academic awkwardness. First of all, the tale is precisely what Harry Bailly fears. It is an elaborate sophism, involving a question of supposition or denomination. Heytesbury might search for solutions to such questions as "How much of a man must be white, if he is to be called white'?" Or, "What degree of velocity is sufficient to denominate the movement of Brunellus as 'running'?"12 Chaucer's Clerk asks, in effect, "How much patient endurance of motiveless malignity does Griselda have to display in order for her husband to admit that she deserves the denomination 'sad'?" The word "sad," which Chaucer uses less than fifty times throughout his writings, is applied ten times to Griselda. It is a dif ficult word?C. S. Lewis devotes a chapter to it in his Studies in Words?a word generally applied, however, to old, serious, thoughtful people. Sadnesse is precisely the quality that the Clerk himself ought to have; it is obviously what he admires in Griselda, who is all the more admirable and astonishing because of her youth. Actually, the Clerk's pains to affect a "sad" demeanor go unappreciated by Harry Bailly, who impishly interprets his studious silence as a kind of epicene demureness: "Ye ryde [says Harry] as coy and stille as dooth a mayde" (E 2). The Clerk, lacking Harry's virility, is an athlete of the intellect, easily capable of imagining situations which violate the canons of social and moral decorum. He simply "posits" the case of a young woman who has somehow developed the virtues appropriate to advanced years: But thogh this mayde tendre were of age, Yet in the brest of hire virginitee Ther was enclosed rype and sad corage. . . . (E 218-20) It makes perfect sense to him that Walter should marry a young maiden for this quality alone, just as he accepts unquestioningly the Marquis' perverse desire to tempte Griselda?to assay her woman hood with respect to this virtue: Ther fil, as it bif alleth tymes mo, Whan that this child had souked but a throwe, This markys in his herte longeth so To tempte his wyf, hir sadnesse for to knowe, That he ne myghte out of his herte throwe This merveillous desir his wyf t'assaye. . . . (E 449-54) 12. See Wilson, Heytesbury, where such examples may be found throughout the text</page><page sequence="7">JOSEPH E. GRENNEN 87 This form of "knowing" is represented as almost the ultimate sexual act for the Marquis, but we sense that its explicit justification in the narrator's mind is simply the fact that probation seems the right and necessary way to bring any action to a conclusion. It is true that the Clerk calls this testing nedelees, and admits that it is evil to put a wife to such anguish, but this perfunctory sop to ordinary morality does not obscure his genuine fascination for the inexorable regimen that Walter has set himself. The Clerk's final rationalization of Walter's program is horrifying for the ease with which it abrogates the Marquis' humanity by elevating him to the status of a philosophical principle. His words preclude any search for motives: What koude a sturdy housbonde moore devyse To preeve hir wyfhod and hir stedefastnesse, And he continuyng evere in sturdinesse? But ther been folk of swich condicion That whan they have a certein purpos take, They kan nat stynte of hire entencion, But, right as they were bounden to a stake, They wol nat of that firste purpos slake. Right so this markys f ulliche hath purposed To tempte his wyf as he was first disposed. (E 698-707) The language here is redolent of the discussions in Aristotle's Physics, and scholastic commentaries on it, of motion and change, particularly of Aristotle's conception of the characteristics of an "un moved mover," or "prime mover": Such a motor need not undergo any change to preserve a con stant relation with the mobile, but can exercise its kinetic power without ever being exhausted. . . . And for the motion to be uniform, the disposition of the mobile to the motor must also be without change. . . . The only continuous movement, therefore, is that which is caused by the motionless motor, which ever maintains its own uniformity of disposition and will therefore maintain a uniform and continuous relation to the mobile. . . .13 Thus, a better phrase for Walter than "motiveless malignity" would 13.

Leonina, II (Rome, 1884), p. 457.</page><page sequence="8">88 SCIENCE AND SENSmiLTTY IN CHAUCER'S CLERK be "unmoved mover," if we are to use an idiom closer to the Clerk's own sensibility. Motion, of course, in the Aristotelean cosmos, had technical implications which it lost in the post-Galilean world. There were basically three kinds of motion (motus), which, incidentally, was exactly the same as change (mutatio). One type was growth (augmentatio or diminutio); a second was change of place (motus secundum locum), and this was almost universally termed translatio; this explains, for example, the Clerk's statement that Griselda was "translated ... in swich richesse" when she removed to the palace? it was merely a change of position, and not of Griselda's moral being. The third kind was qualitative change (alteratio), precisely what Shakespeare means when he affirms that "Love is not love/Which alters when it alteration finds,/ Or bends with the remover to remove." Now, any one of these three varieties of change would properly be referred to as a "motion." A body which became hotter, redder, faster in its movement, or a person, for that matter, who became braver, wiser, or healthier, could be said to be moved with respect to that quality.14 It might be mentioned here, too, that there was a spe cial form of augmentatio known as antiperistasis, whereby a quality was thought to intensify itself by reflexion in the presence of its con trary quality. On this principle, steam was thought to be more united and more intense in the presence of cold air.15 It is apparently on this principle, also, that the Clerk interprets Griselda's increase of virtue even after she takes up residence in the palace, typically a hotbed of luxury and idleness. For though that evere vertuous was she, She was encressed in swich excellence Of thewes goode, yset in heigh bountee, And so discreet and fair of eloquence, So benigne and so digne of reverence, And koude so the peples herte embrace, That ech hire lovede that looked in hir face. (E 407-13) Numerous details suggest that Chaucer's modifications in the re ceived story are mainly directed toward making the Clerk formulate the "monstrous" trial of Griselda in terms of a scholastic problem of motion. As Walter begins his intimidations, for instance, and watches his wife's face for a reaction, we read: 14. See Aristotle, Physics, III, iii (Loeb ed., I, 209 ff.). 15. The doctrine arose from Aristotle's discussion in his Meteorologica, but see also Physics, VIII, x (Loeb ed., II, 419).</page><page sequence="9">JOSEPH E. GRENNEN 89 Whan she had herd al this, she noght ameved Neither in word, or chiere, or contenaunce. . . . (E 498-99) And when the second child has been spirited away, and Walter scrutinizes Griselda's face and demeanor for signs of a breach in her sadnesse, he finds none: He waiteth if by word or contenance That she to hym was changed of corage; But nevere koude he fynde variance. She was ay oon in herte and in visage; And ay the forther that she was in age, The moore trewe, if that it were possible, She was to hym in love, and moore penyble. For which it semed thus, that of hem two Ther nas but o wyl; for, as Walter leste, The same lust was hire plesance also. (E 708-17) There are echoes here of the so-called "Peripatetic Law of Motion,,, which stated "that an action can proceed only from a proportion of greater inequality [maior proportio], where the active force is greater than the resistive/'16 A usual term in the fourteenth cen tury for this excess of force (Bradwardine employs it in his Treatise on Proportions) was dominium, which, of course, also meant "lord ship" in ordinary contexts. Linguistic conflation of this sort victimizes the Clerk as much as the improbabilities of the narrative he has in herited. What seems clear enough is that the Clerk's efforts at real istic interpretation are continually undercut both by the inherently artificial nature of the action and by his saturation with a clerkly idiolect which could only define psychological realities in logical or geometrical terms. It is far less important to try to interpret Walter's and Griselda's motives than to try to fathom the nature of the Clerk's struggle to explain them. At times, it seems that he is saying that there is no change (no motion of alteration) in Griselda because the lordship which Walter wields so menacingly is only a specious form of dominium; at other times the point seems to be that natural me chanics are suspended by supernatural intervention, that grace oper ates in Griselda in such a way that motor and mobile can preserve 16.

But it may not do to press theological niceties too far. Griselda's con tinual submergence of her will in her husband's, "conformynge hire to that the markys lyked," so that it seemed "that of hem two ther nas but o wyl" seems to eradicate all distinctions of lord and subject. From a strictly doctrinal standpoint, and insofar as the Clerk's Tale is in any sense an allegorical statement of the proper relation of sub ject-man to the Lord-God, this smacks of the heresy of quietism. But is allegory really a fair term to apply to the poem? Walter's lordship is in the truest sense not paradigm but parody of the divine lordship. The Clerk's language invites the comparison, but the context makes such a comparison seem absurd, whereas Griselda's genuinely anal ogous relationship to Job, and Abraham, and even Christ, is merely enhanced by the whimsical absolutism of the lord she serves. In terms which evoke a remembrance of Christ's submission to the Father, for example, Griselda asserts: Al youre plesance ferme and stable I holde; For wiste I that my deeth wolde do yow ese, Right gladly wolde I dyen, yow to plese. (E 663-65) Space is lacking to provide the evidence that could be brought forth to prove that the very phrase "ferme and stable" always carried a strong connotation of divine fixity and peace, or that the single word "dispose" suggested the idea of divine ordination in countless in stances between Plato's Timaeus and Pope's Essay on Man ("Man proposes, but God disposes"). Actually, most readers are probably willing enough to see Walter as in some way suggestive of celestial authority. But the point is that the Clerk tends to define him more as a parody of a philosophical than a theological first principle. By lacking all motive but his arbitrary firste purpos he assumes, practi cally, the status of sheer agency in the strict scholastic sense?a causa agens. All substances, given a high enough level of abstrac tion, were able to be defined as either "agents" or "patients." In the phrasing of Gundissalinus, "omnis substancia uel est causa agens uel causatum paciens."17 And all action depends upon the existence of these two contrary principles. Even the prototypical act of divine disposition (on Platonic principles) required, as Chalcidius puts it, deus ut faciens and silua ut patiens. One probably has to do a con siderable amount of reading in scholastic physics to appreciate the extent to which the objects and motions of the ordinary world of ex 17. Gundissalinus, De divisione phihsophiae, p. 33.</page><page sequence="11">JOSEPH E. GRENNEN 91 perience can be denuded of their sensual reality in the interest of analyzing them as substances and accidents, essences and qualities, agents and patients, and so forth, but some famiharity with this technical vocabulary is essential to an understanding of Chaucer's intentions in the Clerk's Tale. Griselda may have been known as "patient Griselda" before Chaucer's Clerk retold her story, but it was inevitable that she would have that sobriquet after he had finished. In the Clerk's view of things, anyone who has patience in the superabundant measure in which Griselda has it is bound to be thought of as almost the apotheosis of the philosophical concept of the patiens, the thing-being-acted-upon. For a clerk, that is to say, people have greater or less interest simply in proportion to the extent that they are illustrative of philosophical principles. Thus, the peculiar dramatic quality of Chaucer's version of the Griselda story derives to a great extent from the tension between an audience's understand able interest in virtuous character, suspense, pathos, and all the other conventional narrative excellences, and its ability to interpret these features as data filtered through the sensibility of the Clerk, who is driving his tale towards definition as a sophism turning upon subtle ties better left in the lecture hall. One of the most unfortunate red herrings injected into discussions of the poem, I think, is the observation that there is little imagery in it. This is usually taken to mean that its texture is thin, in the new critical sense. It all depends, of course, on what one means by imagery and texture. It can certainly be taken in a very broad sense to include not just metaphor, simile, and appeals to the senses, but also the alternative contexts evoked by the connotative power of spe cial forms of language. If texture means anything, it means the com plexity with which intellect and emotion are involved in responding to the language used, whether or not it contains references to color, form, sound, and so forth. For a knowledgeable audience in Chaucer's day, a large part of the texture of the poem was its resonance of the intellectual style of Oxonian scholasticism?of abstruse theorizing about qualitative change, probably particularly such things as the in terest of the Mertonians in the intension and remission of forms or qualities, and the application of physical laws to psychological and moral acts. Surely the much stigmatized discussion about the number of angels who would be able to dance on the point of a pin is no more absurd than the case adduced by Roger Rosetus in his treatise De maximo et minimo about "whether a frater can be obligated by a precept of the prelate to the performance of a task?say, the reading of sacred scripture?which is against his conscience. One of the argu</page><page sequence="12">92 SCIENCE AND SENSTBrUTY IN CHAUCER's CLERK ments contra is that there is neither a maximum act of studying which would conform to the prelate's precept nor a minimum act of study ing which would not so conform, since the intensity of the act of studying may be increased in infinitum."18 Of primary interest, however, is the resonance of scholastic atten tion to probationes in medieval works. Chaucer's audience would understand that the Clerk's sympathy for Walter is justified by little more than the fact that what he is doing to his wife can be brought under the umbrella of prevyng or assaying. It is a peculiarity of fourteenth-century semantics which may obscure this point for us, since preve then meant what a clerk did in his logical or scientific pur suits just as readily as it meant what God did in the cases of Job and Abraham. The Brome Isaac has a coloration similar to the Clerk's Tale, for the action is clearly conceived as a matter of the proving of Abraham's heart. The figure of Deus says in the beginning: "Abrams hart now wyll I asay,/ Wether that he be stedfast or noo." Abraham sees it in this way, too, but with a kind of objectivity that allows him to regard his own heart as almost a tertium quid between God and himself. Interestingly, also, the play ends with a speech by a character called Doctor, who advises against "grucching" against the will of God, and adds: And thys women, that wepe so sorowfully Whan that hyr chyldryn dey them froo, As nater woll and kynd, Yt ys but folly, I may well awooe, To groche a-gens God or to greve yow. . . ,19 God, in the Clerk's Tale, is simply an extension of this figure of the divine assayer?clearly an anthropomorphic projection along strictly clerkly lines: For, sith a womman was so pacient Unto a mortal man, wel moore us oghte Receyven al in gree that God us sent; For greet skile is, he preeve that he wroghte. But he ne tempteth no man that he boghte, As seith Seint Jame, if ye his pistel rede; He preeveth folk al day, it is no drede, 18. Wilson, Heyteshury, p. 101. 19.

Lat us thanne lyve in vertuous suffraunce. (E 1149-62) As with so many of the Canterbury Tales, the perspective of the tale proper is abruptly underscored for the warped or limited vision it affords by an ending (in some tales it is no more than a brief ejacu lation) which restores the balance. Chauntecleer high on his toes, or high on the branch of the tree where he has taken refuge, is put in perspective by a prayer to God to "brynge us to his heighe blisse. Amen." The deceits and the silly hopes of the alchemists for unearned riches are dismissed with the Yeoman's prayer to God to "sende every trewe man bocte of his bale." Here, judicial probation is set against redemptive love; the idea of the clash of wills in the human context of lordship and servitude is resolved in a vision of divine governance in which, with Pauline charity, voluntas is seen as conditioned by fragilitas. The contrariety of the philosopher's world of forms and qualities, agents and patients, is supplanted by the Christological reality of "sharpe scourges of adversitee," but?more important in terms of the tale's main focus?patience, with the morally neutral connotation it assumes in philosophy, yields to the idea of "vertuous suffraunce," with all the connotations of pain, toleration, and love that the Christian ideal affords it.
