Nelsen Thomas W. Waldron and Karen Stewart Department of Sociology Department of Sociology and Anthropology Catholic University of America Western Kentucky University Abstract A trait of southern religion identified by Hill is its close relationship with southern secular culture. The religious factor in the South is filtered through cultural experience. Various observers have noted the conservative religious ideology found in the South; and researchers have linked the image of God (as punishing) with sectarianism. Using data collected from students attending a regional, state university in the Upper South, three hypotheses were given support: (1) that secrtarianism and the holding of an Old Testament view of God are related; (2) that the holding of such an image of God, which is part of southern culture, is unrelated to religious attendance; and (3) that holding a New Testament image of God as merciful is related to religious attendance because this conception is part of the specific religious culture. Hill's thesis concerning the closeness of the general southern culture and southern religion finds support. One problem area for the consequential dimension of southern culture-religion is suggested. BACKGROUND In his study of white southern Protes- tantism, Hill (1966:30) discussed its close relationship with the larger southern culture. He noted (1966:xv) a revealing contradiction between the long- held sectarian intentions which led the major southern bodies to dissociate them- selves from a secular culture deemed im- pure and their growing acceptance of that culture and, by now, their nearly com- plete identificaiton with it. Central to the southern church's ideology is a general tradition, "a simple list of propositions" which comprise a popular theology (Hill, 1966:23). In a later vol- 37</page><page sequence="2">38 REVIEW OF RELIGIOUS RESEARCH ume Hill (1972:32) continued to develop this thesis. He wrote: . formal theological propositions are always filtered through cultural experience. In the South, accordingly, the religious factor is not official creeds but what peo- ple perceive the church's truth-claims to be, in line with the complex of assump- tions and pictures with which cultural par- ticipation has equipped them. The conservative nature of southern re- ligious ideology has been noted by Hill and others. From a secondary analysis of Gallup data for June, 1968, Nelsen, Yok- ley, and Madron (1971:393-394) pre- sented data from which it can be seen that Southerners are more likely to hold "orthodox" religious views than non- Southerners, even when residence is con- trolled. Reed observed a southern ortho- dox consensus, the literal quality of south- ern belief, and the emotional emphasis in southern religion (1972:60-61, 68). To be religious in the South is to be "a forgiven sinner" rather than one who especially interprets his faith as a call for loving his neighbor (Hill, 1972:35-36). Hill observed that the central concern of southern religion is carrying out the "great Commission," or making disciples or converting souls (1966:81). The church's mission, therefore, is concerned with evangelism, the individual's conversion-usually in an instantaneous and datable experience, and it is depicted as chiefly negative and fu- ture, from sin and hell, for the life to come. Hudson (1972:135-136) saw salvation as pivotal for the fundamentalist Chris- tian belief-system existing in the rural South. It is necessary for the individual's social acceptance and it "enables him to make some kind of sense out of the world in which he finds himself." Furth- ermore, the belief-system is enmeshed with the larger culture; for example, Hud- son reported (1972:122-123) that his re- spondents "almost never referred to the Bible when explaining their beliefs, choos- ing instead to draw examples from every- day life." Religious outlook and social conditions have been linked by Nelsen (1972:226- 233) who interpreted sectarianism "as a reflection of world view formed by in- dividuals with limited, or simplistic, out- looks, i.e., from the lower classes and from rural areas." The need for conver- sion thus can be interpreted as stemming at least in part from the general secular culture, here present in the South and es- pecially in its more rural areas. The need for conversion is tied to a concept of God as punishing or vindictive. As Nelsen wrote, a more Old Testament view of God emerges here, a conception of God as wrathful and as righteous judge, rather than loving savior. . . . Man's response is emotional and fatalistic; often backsliding, he is 'saved" on occasions of revival. In light of the close relationship between the religious and general cultures in the South-the formation of a "popular the- ology"-we view this Christian Old Tes- tament image of God as part of the gen- eral culture of the South with its origin lying in the special conditions attending the taming of the southern backwoods. Cash (1941:55-58) described the need by the frontier "basic Southerner" for "an anthropomorphic God, the Jehovah of the Old Testament: A God who might be seen, a God who had been seen." The presence of this Old Testament image of God in the present-day, general culture provides a beginning point for interaction of revivalistic preachers and religious or- ganizations with potential converts. In the remainder of this article the authors will report a partial testing of Hill's southern culture-religion thesis, or that in the South the general culture</page><page sequence="3">IMAGE OF GOD AND RELIGIOUS IDEOLOGY 39 includes simplistic and sectarian reli- gious belief, resulting in part from the overlap of the secular and religious cul- tures. The data are from students attend- ing a regional, state university in the Upper South. This study, therefore, is in- tended to be a test case of Hill's thesis.' Specifically, we expect to find the con- ception of God as punishing and vindic- tive present in the general culture. The only way we can effectively test for this is to examine the relationship between re- ligious attendance (or involvement in the more specific religious culture) and holding this Old Testament image of God. We will state this hypothesis (and two others) after we briefly review the liter- ature on sectarianism and image of God. RELIGIOUS IDEOLOGY AND IMAGE OF GOD The possible relationship between reli- gious ideology and concept of God has already been introduced in this article. From an analysis of data collected from Southern Appalachian residents, Brewer (1962:205, 207) identified two basic views of God: Old and New Testament portrayals. The Old Testament concep- tion is God as "righteous judge of all men" (30.2% of Brewer's sample held this view), while the New Testament de- scription is God as "loving Heavenly Fa- ther" (29.3% ).2 These descriptions were chosen by the interviewees from cate- gories given for a question asking for the identification of the description "most nearly approaching their ideas of God." Brewer does not report the relationship between description of God and funda- mentalism, or conservative religious ide- ology. Spilka, Armatas, and Nussbaum (1964) obtained data for 64 God-concepts from a very religious sample of sophomore girls in a western Catholic girls' college and from a sample of undergraduate stu- dents at the University of Denver. The latter sample included only students "who professed some degree of religiosity and church participation" (Spilka, Armatas, and Nussbaum, 1964:30). The responses from the two groups were separately sub- jected to factor analysis and the resulting factors were compared across samples. Eleven factors were extracted for the Catholic girls, compared to 12 for the undergraduate university students. Fac- tor I for the Catholic girls was defined (Spilka, Armatas, and Nussbaum, 1964: 31) as "a wrathful, avenging and damn- ing God as opposed to one which is warm and charitable" and it was noted that it "might result from a clear defi- nition of such a God relative to Catholic training either as a truly descriptive God concept or one which is definitely reject- ed." On the other hand, Factor I for the general sample of University of Denver students included what might be inter- preted as socially desirable items (God as considerate, comforting, helpful, etc.).. Spilka and his associates also presented which terms were viewed by the respon- dents as most and least descriptive of God. For both samples, terms of a com- forting and supportive nature were listed under the category "most descriptive," while terms concerning negative punitive- ness were given as "least descriptive." In accounting for the difference between the two samples on Factor I, Spilka and his associates commented that for the Catholic sample the first factor represents "what God is not," while for the general sample "Factor I represents the positive and desired conception of God while Fac- tor II reflects what God is not like." Spil- ka, Armatas, and Nussbaum (1964:34) gave an alternative hypothesis: "Factors I and II [for the general sample] really represent the ends of a secondary</page><page sequence="4">40 REVIEW OF RELIGIOUS RESEARCH dimension of God-concepts, one in which God may be viewed along a more general dimension of positive supportiveness to negative punitiveness and control." Using adjectives employed by Spilka and his associates together with additional items, Gorsuch (1968) asked undergrad- uate students in psychology at Vanderbilt University to rate each adjective-wheth- er it "does not describe 'God'," "de- scribes 'God'," or "describes 'God' par- ticularly well." The responses were factor analyzed; and the results were compared with those reported by Spilka and his associates. Of greatest interest to us is the comment by Gorsuch (1968:64) that: the more liberal and humanistic Christian bodies would probably average much high- er on a factor such as Factor 3: Com- panionable [considerate, fair, faithful, helpful, etc.] while those groups that are more Barthian would probably score much higher on Factor 2: Benevolent Deity [All- wise, Comforting, Divine, Forgiving, and the like.] The fundamentalist groups would probably score much higher on Factor 5: Wrathfulness [Avenging, Cruel, Damning, Punishing, etc.] In conclusion, findings and interpretations presented in this literature tend to sup- port the claim that religious ideology should be related to God-image. Next, we turn to a presentation of our hypoth- eses. HYPOTHESES The following hypotheses will be test- ed: (1) sectarianism and the holding of an Old Testament view of God as vin- dictive are positively related; (2) religious organization involvement, or attendance, and the holding of this Old Testament image of God are unrelated; and (3) holding a New Testament image of God as helpful and merciful is positively re- lated to attendance. A few comments on these hypotheses would seem in order. The first hypothesis--that sectarianism is related to the holding of an Old Testa- ment view of God-clearly stems from the view that the general culture includes an image of God as punishing, i.e., as expecting conversion or "let the nonbe- liever beware." As Nelsen has suggested, sectarianism and the holding of an Old Testament conception of God comes out of social conditions correlated with a simplistic and fatalistic view of life. Per- haps more to the point, Gorsuch has noted that fundamentalism and this view of God should be related. The second hypothesis is more tenta- tive. Granted the first hypothesis, then not all holders of the Old Testament image would be church attenders, even though southern culture places emphasis upon religious belonging and religious culture in the South begins with an em- phasis upon conversion. Religious in- volvement would tend to mean, in the end, the greater likelihood of rejecting this image of God, given the official creed of the southern denominations (accept- ance of Jesus as Saviour, reflecting the mercifulness of God). Consequently, the general culture contains the Christian Old Testament image of God; this is the pivot for southern fundamentalist religious doc- trine. There is little reason, then, to, ex- pect a relationship between religious in- volvement and the holding of this Old Testament image because it is part of the general culture and plays a role in nomi- nal religious involvement as well. The third hypothesis has already been introduced. The notion of a merciful and helpful God, a New Testament image, is a central ingredient of New Testament- based belief. The conversion process, while beginning with a view of man's depravity and a righteous and vindictive God, ends in an experience whereby the individual comes to feel "light as a feath- er" (Hudson, 1972:135), a product of a sense of losing the weight of the feeling</page><page sequence="5">IMAGE OF GOD AND RELIGIOUS IDEOLOGY 41 of guilt, unworth, and being judged for damnation in the eyes of the Old Testa- ment God. In this sense, the secular cul- ture can be interpreted as reinforcing the religious belief-system. In summary, as part of the religious experience, this characteristic of God as the Old Testa- ment figure loses its dominance for the church attender even though it is a motif in the general southern culture. Holding a New Testament image of God should be positively related to church involvement or attendance. SAMPLE AND MEASUREMENT From students attending a regional, state university in the Upper South in the fall of 1971, a random sample consisting of 3.5% of the student body, was select- ed.4 Of these 393 students, 21 were count- ed as ineligible since they either had al- ready withdrawn from school at the time of the survey or had moved and could not be contacted. Of the remaining stu- dents in the sample, 77.2% returned the questionnaire sent them (one followup letter was employed). The great majority were undergraduates, and both males and females were included in the study. Seventeen items (employed by Spilka, Armatas, and Nussbaum (1964) or Gorsuch (1968) in their factors for a loving God and a punitive God) in addi- tion to eight filler items5 (included to safeguard against the identification of the two factors by the respondents) were listed within the questionnaire. Also, in addi- tion to other religious and background items, the six items utilized by Nelson (1972) to ascertain religious conserva- tism or sectarianism were employed.6 The data for the 17 items concerning the image of God were subjected to a principal component solution factor anal- ysis with varimax rotation. This method determined the number of independent dimensions necessary for accounting for the variance in the variables. The filler items were not included in the factor analysis.7 A lower limit of 1.00 was used for the appropriate eigenvalues in order to terminate the extraction of factors. The factor loadings are found in Table 1. The two factors are clearly demarcated and there is virtually no overlap between the two factors.

Factor II distinctly con- tains adjectives for an avenging God, the Christian Old Testament conception. Of course, these characteristics were chosen by the researchers for inclusion in the questionnaire with these two images in mind; therefore, the results are very con- sistent with those expected.</page><page sequence="6">42 REVIEW OF RELIGIOUS RESEARCH From the factor analysis were pro- duced factor scores for each of the two factors. These scores were then trans- formed to a set of scores with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. This transformation was executed solely for processing convenience and in no way altered the shape of the distribution. Scores ranged from 14 through 59 for the first factor and from 38 through 88 for the second factor. In addition, the respondents were asked the number of hours they spent per month in church or related activities. The responses were collapsed into none versus one or more hours. This consti- tuted our involvement measure. The six-item religious conservatism or sectarianism scale developed by Nel- sen (1972) was employed in this study." The value of coefficient alpha for the re- sponses to these six items was .63; and the responses were collapsed into low (score 0), moderately low (scores 1-2), moderately high (scores 3-4), and high (scores 5-6).9 FINDINGS An examination of the relationship between sectarianism and holding an Old Testament image of God reveals that for all respondents there is a mean of 47.9 on the Old Testament scale for those scoring low on the conservatism or sec- tarianism scale, compared to 48.5 for the moderately low, 50.8 for the moder- ately high, and 55.3 for those scoring high. A simple analysis of variance indi- cates that these mean values are signi- ficantly different (F=4.29, p&lt;.05). Dif- ference-of-means tests indicate a signifi- cant difference between means for those moderately high and those high on con- servatism (t=2.18, p&lt;.05). For those moderately low and moderately high, the differences only approach significance (t= 1.70, p=.09). There is no apparent relationship be- tween involvement and subscription to an Old Testament image. The noninvolved have a mean of 49.1 and the involved a mean of 50.3 on the Old Testament fac- tor scale (t=.89, p&gt;.05). Thus, the sec- ond (null) hypothesis is not rejected. There is a positive relationship between church involvement and subscription to a New Testament image of God, however, with the noninvolved having a mean of 43.1 and the involved a mean of 52.6 on the New Testament factor scale (t=7.63, p&lt;.05). Thus, the third hypothesis is given support by this analysis. In summary, a view that southern cul- ture includes the portrayal of God as judge and as a figure meting out punish- ment for sins is given support. Holding such a view is not linked with religious organizational involvement. On the other hand, identification of God as imparting comfort and help is related to religious involvement.'" CONCLUSION Three hypotheses are given support in this study. Individuals who are sectar- ian are more likely to hold an Old Testa- ment view of God; the holding of such a view of God is unrelated to religious involvement (attendance). This offers evidence of the enmeshing of the religious and general southern cultures. On the other hand, the New Testament concep- tion of God and religious attendance, as indicated by analysis of the data, are re- lated. This concept of God is interpreted as part of Christian creed and chiefly imparted through religious participation. In this analysis data collected from stu- dents provided the case test of Hill's the- sis concerning the close relationship be- tween the southern and religious cultures. Further research might well be com- pleted utilizing nonstudent data. Com- parative data (e.g., South versus non-</page><page sequence="7">IMAGE OF GOD AND RELIGIOUS IDEOLOGY 43 South) may also be employed as part of a more extended analysis. Finally, the consequences of the enmeshing of the religious and the more general culture in the South should be assessed. Both Thompson (1972) and Hill (1972) note that southern religion serves the status quo in race relations. Hill writes (1972:43) that in emphasizing the superior purity of southern beliefs and in assuaging guilt, southern religion "le- gitimated the (white) Southern Way of Life." Religion also served to place em- phasis upon individual conversion rather than social action. Research to determine the degree to which southern religion qua religion, as distinct from its enmeshing with southern culture and forming a popular theology, has negative effects on race re- lations should be conducted. Is the em- phasis upon individual conversion rather than group concern (love thy neighbor) a primary causal variable?"' Or does fun- damentalism or sectarianism, including the holding of an Old Testament image of God, play a more significant role?12 Finally, it may be suggested that this is potentially a false dichotomy. Perhaps southern (white) religion has in fact en- shrined traditional southern relation- ships,4' providing statuses acceptable to almost all believers and participants. NOTES AND REFERENCES 1. A senior at the time this researclh was completed, the last author is presently employed by the Ken- tucky Department of Economic Security, Hartford, Kentucky. As part of a larger study, this investigation was partly supported by PHS Research Grant No. 1-RO1-MH-16573. 2. The other categories and percentages were: creator of the world (10.5%), all-seeing eye who watches us (9.0%), ideal of truth, beauty and goodness (7.2%), God of wrath and judgment (4.2%), and the Man Upstairs (1.4%). On Southern Appalachian religion, see also Pearsall (1959:102-126). 3. The second factor for the general sample included such items as damning, punishing, and avenging. Such items as comforting, merciful, and loving appeared in Factor V for the Catholic girls. 4. Thte sample was systematic. After the interval was determined, a starting point was randomly selected. 5. The filler items were severe, critical, passive, hard, stern, distant, inaccessible, and impersonal. 6. The respondents were directed to rate each of the 17 adjectives in terms of "describing what you think God is like." The categories were: "Does not describe God, describes God, describes God particularly well." 7. Reanalysis, including the filler items, gave additional factors rather than additional items falling into the first two factors. Because these filler items were included in the questionnaire with the expectation that they would not load high on the first two factors, this reanalysis sup- ported our initial (and final) strategy of not including them. The filler items were designed to keep the re- spondents from identifying our research expectations (New and Old Testament conceptions) and answering accordingly (resulting in greater coherence than might actually exist in their beliefs). 8. For a review of the literature on sectarianism, including its definition, see Nelson (1972). 9. Nelsen (1972) has identified the low score as rep- resenting modern liberals for the population he studied (his sample consisted of Presbyterians at least nom- inally affiliated with a local church). In our study, however, those scoring low included individuals not involved in any religious organization. Nelsen also identified the moderately low score as representing re- ligious conservatives who were not fundamentalistic or sectarian, the moderately high score as consisting of fundamentalistic nonsectarians, and the high score as identifying fundamentalistic sectarians. These labels were linked with the construction of the scale, i.e., were based on an examination of the content of the items. Since the responses and items were unidimen- sional, however, perhaps these breaking points were somewhat arbitrary. The scale measures religious ideol- ogy with sectarianism being identified for the higher scores. These scores could be collapsed, no doubt, at points other than first suggested by Nelsen. 10. A fourth hypothesis would stem almost directly from Nelsen's (1972) paper on sectarianism and world view. From that writing one nmight infer that opposite sectarianism is tlhe New Testament image (see Brewer, 1962:205, 207). This additional hypothesis would have been the least tenable and it was not viewed as central in this test case of Hill's theory. There were significant differences by involvement on the New Testament scale; therefore, only the responses given by the religiously involved were analyzed at this point. For those respondents low on religious con- servatism, the mean was 54.2 on the New Testament scale in comparison to 52.5 for those moderately low, 51.4 for those moderately high, and 53.4 for those high on the religious conservatism scale. A simple analysis of variance indicates that these mean values are not significantly different (F=.89, p &gt;.05). Therefore, the New Testament image and sectarian- ism are unrelated, even though involvement is speci-</page><page sequence="8">44 REVIEW OF RELIGIOUS RESEARCH fled. A strong relationship exists between religious in- volvement and conservatism (or sectarianism), with gamma= .74, p&lt;.05). One interpretation is that among sectarians who are involved in a religious organization, conversion may well be expected; and the second re- ferent in the conversion process is the redeeming God. Prhaps, then, a potential inverse relationship between sectarianism and the New Testament image variable is cushioned by the participation of sectarians and by the official creed of the religious organization which comes into play with religious involvement. Apparently sec- tarianism remains for the participants, but they also come to accept this New Testament image of God. The tendency for sectarianism to remain is indicative of the strength of the general southern culture. 11. By love of one's neighbor the authors do not mean loving only individual neighbors who are likely to be of the same race and who probably hold similar social and political attitudes but also loving "groups in the mass" (e.g., all races in American society). 12.
