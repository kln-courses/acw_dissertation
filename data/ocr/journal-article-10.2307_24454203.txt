<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Cat and the Fiddle: Images of Musical Humour from the Middle Ages to Modern Times. By Jeremy Barlow. (Oxford, England: The Bodleian Library, 2007. Pp. 88. $20.00.) Although scholars have studied specific sources or genres of music that contain humor (e.g., sheet music, minstrel shows, operettas, musical comedy), this book is the first modern effort to attempt an overview of the theme of graphic musical humor. Beginning with the medieval period and extending to the twentieth century, Jeremy Barlow's research is based entirely on Bodleian Library collections that include manuscripts, prints, drawings, children's books, journals, sheet music, and ephemera produced primarily in England. The first chapter examines religious medieval manuscripts, the marginalia of which includes such unlikely images as devils, anthropomorphic animals, and "mock instruments" such as bellows and tongs. In this chapter, and in the next one on secular romance manuscripts of the same period, Barlow asks whether these images were a reflection of reality—such as devils depicted in mystery plays or the "rough music" played in charivaris—or products of the imagination. The third chapter addresses changes in graphic musical humor of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries following the introduction of printing. The primary locus of imagery shifts to individually printed engravings, drawings, or paintings. These works frequently depict musical humor in scenes of carnival and the carnivalesque theatre that derives from Italian commedia dell 'arte. As Barlow shows in his next two chapters, prints of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries also began using humor to comment on social life and class contrasts. Artists frequently used instruments associated with the lower classes (e.g., bagpipes or hurdy-gurdy) to make pointed comments about individual morals, society, and politics, especially through depictions of charivari and rough music. Barlow's final three chapters address English satires on domestic amateur musicians from the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries, musical humor in children's books and musical oddities of the Victorian era, and music lovers in the twentieth century. He includes a useful glossary of obsolete musical instru ments with references to the illustrations that depict them, a list of works con</page><page sequence="2">14 8 The Historian suited, and an index. The seventy-one pages of text include fifty-one beautifully reproduced illustrations, many in color, with accompanying explanatory captions. Barlow's book is engaging, but as is indicated by its very short length, few citations, and bibliography of general surveys of humor and of music, it is not a scholarly examination of the subject. The text seldom provides analysis, and most chapters contain only about two full pages of text. In addition, Barlow frequently juxtaposes illustrations from widely diverse time periods in an effort to show that artists continued to use similar imagery, but he fails to recognize that the artistic intent differed greatly. For example, a fourteenth-century manuscript and a nineteenth-century caricature by James Gillray both depict dancing bears, but the meaning of these two images is strikingly different (22-23). One is a decoration possibly illustrating an event described in the manuscript, while the other is a commentary about the relationships of British politicians in 1806. Despite these shortcomings, this work serves to suggest a topic that deserves further serious study. University of Southern Indiana Tamara L. Hunt</page></plain_text>
