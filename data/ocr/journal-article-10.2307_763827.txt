<plain_text><page sequence="1">Instrumentalities DAVID BURROWS A n intriguing aspect of musical instruments, considered simply as objects in themselves, is their unmusicality: their stolidly localized materiality is the antithesis of music's transient energy states diffusing through the air.' Perhaps this helps to explain why instruments can't be discussed without raising extra-musical issues, some of which will be taken up in this essay. Besides embodying a conjunction of dense with rarefied-the density of their materials with the rarefaction of their musical product-instruments are a comment on the relation of the performer's body to his or her living space: they raise questions about the interaction of skin-in with skin-out, and about the control of the spaces around and between us. 117 Music is either sung or played, and the performer on an instru- ment, a clarinet for example, rejects the resources of the interior of the body used by a singer in favor of an interaction with an object outside himself. In either case, whether singing or playing the clarinet, the per- former, by focussing and concentrating his breath, animates the space around him with what is literally an expression, a pushing outward of his energy. But in playing the clarinet the performer holds his breath in his own two hands where he can work on it and shape it out in the open, in full view of anyone who cares to watch. Instruments are out there in the open, distributed through living spaces like furniture, along with tables and beds and carpets. Furniture is, in one perspective, exactly what they are, and in a small way they participate in the grand human program of territorial appropriation. They diffuse the activity of making music through the other activities implied by mirrors and chairs and the rest of the furniture of domestic life and so mark its overlapping intersections with them. Though in- struments are certainly easier to write about than is music itself, be- cause their physical stability submits so much better to scrutiny, their very familiarity creates another sort of problem for analysis: it is so hard truly to see a piano, or a guitar, and for the same reasons that 1 My thanks to Siegmund Levarie, Tilman Seebass, Kay Kaufman Shelemay, and An- thony Storr, whose reactions to an earlier version of this paper helped make this one better.</page><page sequence="2">THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY make it hard to see a spoon or a telephone. Though in one perspective it is strange that so bizarre a device as a saxophone could ever be so taken for granted as to require de-familiarizing, the fact is that it is en- tirely assimilated to the everyday. We can think of the voice as one of the two major ways we are present for each other. Besides what we are seen to be, the look of the body's surface, there is what we are heard to be: the voice is formed at another threshold, this one invisible within the body, from which it escapes in the form of a signal whose nature is completely at odds with that of thresholds, in that it blurs to a great extent the distinc- tions between here and there, near and far. Sound in general is a literal disembodiment, an escape from the materiality and the concentrated localization of the bodies producing it. People are their own most loyal listeners, for the sound of their own voices is a message to themselves as well as to others, a message of self-confirmation and self-sufficiency. And we sound so much better than other people, so much more resonant and immediate (though hearing ourselves as others hear us, in the form of a recording of our 118 voices played back to us, can produce a shriveling of the sense of self- esteem). Hearing the sound of his own voice returns the listener to himself in a new form, with benefit to his sense of consequentiality, for the sound, while completely unlike his physical self in its radical imma- teriality, still is uniquely his own and is heard only as and when he causes it to be heard. In vocalizing he sets up a loop, a closed circuit in which kinesthetic and auditory sensations confirm each other: the vo- calizing self is transformed from the status of localized physical thing to that of circumambient energy state. What instruments do is to enlarge the loop, bringing outside matter and new manipulative skills into it and in so doing enlarging still further the performer's sense of his prac- tical competence and consequence in the larger world. While the satis- factions of singing can be as great or greater than those of performing on an instrument, they are more purely self-centered. Listeners may read the message of instrumental competence in the same way. Jane Goodall writes of a low-ranking chimpanzee she called Mike who was one of a group she observed over a long period at the Gombe Stream Reserve. Mike had an evident desire to improve his sta- tus in the group, but to do so needed to compensate for his relatively small size. Lying around the compound were some empty four-gallon kerosene cans. Mike decided to hit them together as part of his power display, producing a powerful clangor, and this gave a considerable sonic boost to the respect with which he was treated by peers and rivals.2 A portable stereo carried down a city street makes a similar gesture. 2 In the Shadow of Man (Boston, 1971), pp. 112-14.</page><page sequence="3">INSTRUMENTALITIES Melodic instruments displace the innate starting point for sound- making from the larynx, buried alive inside the body, to the outer illu- minated world inhabited by the visible and tangible self. The point of inception for sound now assumes the form of an external object, a thing among things, accessible to fingers, eyes, lips, and sometimes feet too.3 But it retains a strong link with the body. Because so many instru- ments make use of semi-enclosed resonators, they form a special group among artifacts morphologically as well as functionally. Like contain- ers of all kinds they mimic the body, with its semi-enclosed interior spaces, and the sounds they make emerge like the voice from hidden recesses. Again like the human body, these quasi-homunculi are not autonomous objects to the degree that, say, a crystal is, but assume the shapes they have down to the finest detail in relation to something out- side themselves. An explanation for the form and composition of a finger-board, like one for the human eye, lies outside structural consid- erations bearing solely on the article itself. Each instrument fitted with a resonator takes possession of its space in a conquest by enclosure-just as the body does-and often musicians take possession of the instruments themselves through acts of envelop- ment, wrapping their hands around them, their arms too or, in the case 119 of a cello for example, much of the body. Musicians and listeners are themselves typically enfolded. A hall meant for the performance of live music is like the walk-in, wraparound resonator of some giant lute. This anthropomorphic aspect of many instruments is the focus of much of their symbolic significance. Symbolism is not the subject of this essay,4 but its workings can be suggested by recalling the Russian prov- erb that states that "a wife is not an instrument you can hang on the wall when you're tired of playing on it." This invites the speculation that an instrument may sometimes be a kind of wife whose special virtue is that she can be hung on the wall when you have had enough of her. Blues- man B. B. King's guitar was named Lucille, and before Lucille it was Betsy for twenty years. Like the human body, the body of an instru- ment is a fixity that is all about potential movement, in this case the movement of sound waves; only-and this constitutes a recommenda- tion for anyone who needs a surrogate lover who is no more than an extension of him- or herself-the movements of an instrument are purely reactive. It is responsive, and nothing but responsive (this state- ment needs qualification in the case of some electronic instruments). Many instruments offer the special advantage in a lover of portability. 3 Whistling seems to occupy a position somewhere between vocal and instrumental performance. The lips belong to the body but form part of its margin with the outside world, and their use for music involves a displacement of function comparable to that involved in, say, using wood to make a guitar. 4 Curt Sachs, The History of MusicalInstruments (New York, 1940) contains many obser- vations about the symbolic import of instruments.</page><page sequence="4">THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY We can't wait to get our hands on things, as the expression goes- hands are even involved in speech much of the time. Singers sometimes don't seem to know what to do with their hands: their activity is concen- trated so intensely on the body's interior that hands, having over- whelmingly to do with what is skin-out, can feel left over, so that the singer may be grateful for a microphone or handkerchief to hold on to. Hands are the means of man's cleverest interventions in his surround- ings, central to the activities of detaching things from their native set- tings and carrying them around. They are so integral to the human way of doing things that the expression "empty handed" carries with it con- notations of inadequacy. Fingers carry intervention a degree further in the direction of fine detail, and a rough parallel exists between the pro- gression in degree of temporal refinement from rhythm to pitch in mu- sic, and the progression from the trunk of the body out through arms and hands and finally fingers as the instrumentalist's means of control- ling these musical dimensions. The word "digit" can mean number as well as finger-fingers were presumably in on the beginnings both of counting and of stabilizing pitches on aerophones and chordophones. This points up a parallel be- 120 tween the domains of number and music: both stable pitches and num- bers are discrete positions along a continuum. Clutching is a global sort of activity compared to the finely discriminating analytical work per- formed by fingers. With all but the aerophones, hands detach music from the act (though almost never from the rhythm) of breathing. Some percussion instruments have almost nothing to do with displaced vocalism, but in- stead start out with and celebrate the interaction of the body's surface, primarily through the agency of the hands, with its surroundings. Ac- tually instruments are situated at the intersection of two directionally opposed tropisms, one of them being the urge to push or reach out from the body's interior, the other to pull things in from the outside and establish them within our sphere of influence. Externalizing the threshold where sound begins necessarily means embodying it in new thresholds of bronze, clay, bamboo, bone, hair, and so on, appropri- ated from our surroundings. Giving a voice to metals and woods means giving life and movement to the inanimate, converting its stillness to resiliency. The fact that these objects, inanimate in themselves, exist for the purpose of being animated gives them another significance. Different times converge in them. The hands of the instrument-maker achieved this fixed result, and achieved it at some particular time in the past which is brought up into the present with the survival of his handiwork. In performance, this result responds to the hands of a performer who may be actualizing a program thought through by a musician-</page><page sequence="5">INSTRUMENTALITIES working at his own rate of speed-from some quite different period in the past. All of this movement is implied in the still body of the instru- ment. Instruments are the most fixed and tangible component in the least fixed and tangible of the arts. We can grip instruments and pos- sess them as we can't music, or time itself. Sometimes more of the effort that goes into their making is directed at the connoisseur of fine visual objects than at the lover of music. An article by Kohut and Levarie pro- posed some years ago that music is an exercise in mastery over the fear- ful side of sound.5 If that is so, then we can think of instruments as a visible and tangible symbol of our power over the special power sound has over us-more radically still, over the very passage of time itself. Like kerosene cans clashed together, sounding mu- sical instruments add something fresh and challenging to the contents of the world. Unlike kerosene cans, instruments, with their frets and keys and mouthpieces, are fashioned in detail to receive our initiatives: they are outside us without being alien to us. They can be thought of as related to what the psychoanalytical theorist D. W. Winnicott called "transitional objects," childhood articles such as blankets or stuffed toys that have a constructively ambiguous status between the small 121 child's self and his or her emergent sense of otherness. They help the child bridge the gap between a stage of assumed omnipotence (sus- tained in fact by total dependency) and the mature phase in which self and other are discriminated. They can do so because they are at once external to the body, part of the outside world, and at the same time as responsive to the child's will as though they were extensions of his body. Perhaps we seldom do completely make the transition to auton- omy, some of us experiencing more difficulty with it than others. Per- haps the provisional solution represented by transitional objects sur- vives early childhood along with the problem of establishing a reciprocal relationship with the outside world that it was meant to deal with, attaching itself to new objects such as pipes, chewing gum, pet ani- mals; and musical instruments. Considered as "transitional objects," instruments participate in what Winnicott called the "third area, that of play, which expands into creative living and into the whole cultural life of man. This third area [contrasts] with inner or personal psychic reality and with the actual world in which the individual lives, which can be objectively perceived. I have located this important area of experience in the potential space between the individual and the environment...."6 5 Heinz Kohut and Siegmund Levarie, "On the Enjoyment of Music," Psychoanalytic Quarterly XIX (1950), 64-87. 6 "The Location of Cultural Experience," in Playing and Reality (New York, 1971), pp. 103-04.</page><page sequence="6">THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY Musical instruments join artifacts of all sorts in this area: screw- drivers, shotguns, telescopes, masks-all the armamentarium of indirection-and even such activities as language, ritual, play, and art itself. Winnicott's "third area" is in the old and honorable philosophical tradition that takes mediacy to be the principal key to human nature, and sees much of what is distinctively human as an array of interpolations-some of them individual, some collective-between us and the surrounding world. The space so fitted out can function either as a buffer zone to keep the outside at a safe distance (insofar as it con- tains things like walls and clothing) or as a staging area for focussing an attack on it (tools of all kinds). Musical instruments, along with instru- ments and tools generally, are transitional in a way that goes beyond the developmental sense intended by Winnicott and applied by him to security blankets and cuddly toys. They are transitional in a more as- sured and active way, a more developmentally evolved way, in that their existence implies full acknowledgment of a separate environment and an intention of adding to it or otherwise making a difference in it.7 Testing the concept "transitional object" for its ap- 122 plicability to musical instruments focusses on the relationship between instrument and performer. Shifting to the interaction between per- former and listener suggests another concept, that of the mask. Masks conceal, but they can do more: a ritual or theatrical mask is an interpo- lation that depersonalizes, or rather repersonalizes the actor (per- sona = mask), for the surface of the mask can be worked up into a styl- ized and grandly expressive new surface. Similarly, an instrument replaces the performer's own sonic face, the voice, with a culturally ap- proved impersonal sound used only for making music. True, the technique of a trained singer takes the natural voice some distance in that same direction. But a given instrument necessar- ily imposes a greater degree of timbral standardization on its per- formers than is found among singers-even among a special class of singers, such as mezzo-sopranos. Collectively, instruments broaden the timbral options, but do so in tight clusters: "ophicleide," "banjo" and so forth. A piano key depressed with a certain velocity will produce the same sound no matter who depresses it. The tone produced by a dozen different pianists will be more nearly uniform than the sounds of their voices, and very likely more uniformly pleasing: musical ability has a different distribution pattern throughout the population than does vo- cal quality. With respect to native tone, all pianists start out even. By 7 Rodney Needham has noted a connection between percussion instruments and an- other sort of transition, the shaman's entering into communication with the supernatural world: "Percussion and Transition," Man II (1967), 606-14.</page><page sequence="7">INSTRUMENTALITIES minimizing tone as a consideration bearing on comparisons among art- ists, instruments have the effect of concentrating attention on more es- sentially musical considerations. Probably the very existence of the folklore that says that the charac- ter of various instruments matches the personalities of their per- formers (the high-strung violinist, the bluff, hearty trombone player) is more informative than its content.8 But a better model than the mask for this construal of the instrument in its relationship to the performer would be the ventriloquist's dummy. For here the maneuver is not sim- ply one of concealment and transformation but involves splitting the performer's personality and displacing part of it onto an alter ego that acts as a foil, not a clone. This model leaves room for possible bluff, hearty violinists and high-strung trombone players. With masks and ventriloquists' dummies-and musical instruments-the performer exercises control over the surface he or she presents to a perceiver, control not so different from that exercised by the wearer of clothes, which are after all a kind of all-but-the-face mask. In all these cases there is a retreat from intimacy with viewers and listeners, in the case of music from the intimacy of vocal performance (singer Mary Mayo once said in an interview that "whether I like it or 123 not, when I stand there singing I'm naked"9). Something similar takes place in moving from the spoken to the written word. A retreat from intimacy may be exactly what is sought on both sides, but at least some of the time the interpolation of a new surface has another consequence, that of facilitating an opening out from the personal onto something more encompassing. A particular voice, a particular face always brings with it some of the atmosphere of ordinary mortality, a particular life situation and life history, and depersonalization liberates expressivity from all such restrictive associations. Being free of words, instrumental performance is also independent of the personal point of view from which remarks are necessarily offered. Opera shows how this potential can be used. The opera orchestra doesn't just frame and pace the proceedings, it almost always knows best, in contrast to the frequently deluded personas on stage. Without a particular human identity and point of view, it provides a polyphoni- cally disinterested commentary on events (inevitably one thinks of the impersonally interlocutory role of the chorus in the ancient Greek the- ater). Instruments can achieve a kind of directness impossible for the voice, a mediated immediacy. The latter-day technology of instrument-building brings about a regression to a purer primitive 8 This is the subject of Chapter 13 inJohn Booth Davies's The Psychology of Music (Stan- ford, 1978). 9 Quoted by Whitney Balliett in The New Yorker, February 27, 1978.</page><page sequence="8">THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY voice, the voice as it was before words, before individuation-it helps the effect that this voice issues from beneath the level of the stage-en- abling composer and audience to conspire at omniscience. As with the archetype of the holy fool, the trade-off for omniscience is a renuncia- tion of articulacy. Something should be said before concluding this es- say about the most obvious and straightforward role played by instru- ments. In relation to music itself they act as energy transformers-this is the kind of thing tools generally are about-enriching the resources available to music-making. The performer's energy is transformed timbrally, registrally, dynamically-some instruments convert the es- sentially monophonic resources of the performer into polyphony. This extended spectrum is further enriched when instruments are com- bined in mixed groupings: gamelan and string quartet are examples of standardized composite instruments. Since instrumental sounds have so few uses outside of music, they help to bracket music (to a degree the voice cannot) as a territory apart. And once musical sound is conceived as a territory, the invention and cultivation of instruments can be un- 124 derstood as the result of a drive for territorial conquest. The modern European history of instruments realizes a program of sonic imperial- ism crudely analogous to, and synchronous with, the geopolitical one. Another possible parallel involves European cultural history. The period of instrumental imperialism began in the fifteenth century and reached its climax in the decades around 161o,10 and this coincided with a fundamental change in broad outlook in the society as a whole. This had many aspects, but a new concern with theatricality is one that it suits my present purposes to stress, along with one other, the increas- ing authority of the scientific outlook with its program of theory- building. This pairing of "theory" with "theater" is not casual, because both words derive from the Greek root theorein, meaning "to see," and both point to a taste for the vicarious, for indirect participation that de- rives from aspirations to a kind of ideal mastery that can only be achieved in detachment. The seventeenth century has been called the great age of theater. In the theater a narrative unfolds on a stage, a space removed from the spectator who maintains a detached overview of the proceedings. In sci- ence, performances called experiments, typically staged in laborato- ries, are expected to lead to synoptic, masterful overviews called theorems, or laws. And the success of the new science was dependent 10 Sachs, History, Chapters 15 and 16. II A vivid picture of the period may be found in H. R.

In fact, the view taken of the role of instruments in east and southeast Asia is something like the reverse of this, for there it is the performer who is seen as the instrument of forces outside himself, and the instruments themselves as being, in some cases, means by which the gods act on mortal per- formers, exacting their duties from them.'3 Nevertheless it does seem suggestive that the first great age of purely instrumental music in Eu- rope should have come along at the same time as two great cultural movements expressing a parallel interest in mastery through detach- ment, the scientific revolution and the resurgence of theater. In the cases both of music and of science, detachment involved the use of me- chanical aids: scientific instruments helped discover a world, musical instruments to build one.
