<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Figure of the Black in German Aesthetic Theory SANDER L. GILMAN DURING THE COURSE of the eighteenth century the figure of the Black became a permanent fixture in German arts and letters. Whether as the cabin boy resolving the conflict in Friedrich Maxi- milian von Klinger's drama Sturm und Drang or as the female im- age of the noble savage in an allegorical grouping of Meissen por- celain, the presence of the Black in European thought during and immediately after the Age of Enlightenment raised the question of the depiction of the Black and the nature of its reception. When writers of this age turned to speculations concerning basic principles of art, the function of such figures in theoretical contexts provided a clue to the comprehension of the exotic as well as of the specific role of the Black in eighteenth-century thought. An understanding of the aesthetic implications of one aspect of the exotic during this period can be extrapolated from an evaluation of the theories of the beautiful in the eighteenth century and an analysis of their discus- sion of the Black.' 1 The literature on the figure of the Black has grown in the past decade. The best historical study remains David Brion Davis, The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture (Ithaca, N.Y., 1966) which, however, deals with German sources only marginally. The German studies which have aided this present in- vestigation are: Johann Jacob Sell, Versuch einer Geschichte des Negersclaven- handels (Halle, 1791) and Albert Hiune, Vollstdndige historisch-philosophische Darstellung aller Veranderungen des Negersclavenhandels von dessen Ursprunge an bis zu seiner gdnzlichen Aufhebung (Gottingen, 1820). Literary studies in this area have dealt with non-German texts, but the following studies are of general interest: Katherine George, "The Civilized West looks at Primitive Africa, 1400- 1800," Isis, 49 (1958), 62-72; J. Robert Constantine, "The Ignoble Savage, an Eighteenth-Century Literary Stereotype," Phylon, 27 (1966), 171-79; and Lemuel A. Johnson, The Devil, The Gargoyle, and the Buffoon: The Negro as Metaphor in Western Literature (Port Washington, N.Y., 1971).

In the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London from 1727-1728 William Cheselden, "F. R. S. Surgeon to her Majesty, and to St. Thomas's Hospital," presented a case study describing the rehabilitation of a thirteen- year-old boy, blind from birth, whose sight was restored through an operation for the relief of cataracts. Cheselden's essay provided scientific data parallel to the theoretical observations presented in Molyneux's monograph. However, his interest was not restricted to the medical intricacies of the operation, rather he focused on the adaptation of the subject to the world of sight. Thus the substance of Cheselden's paper concerned itself with those contemporary epistemological questions, raised in the philosophical and literary discussions, concerning the physical and psychological nature of perception. Cheselden seemed to contradict Molyneux's thesis that an individual, deprived of sight, had to be educated to perceive visual categories such as size, perspective, and color. Even while altering the basis for discussion, Cheselden's paper contributed the impetus to a new orientation of the concept of Blackness. He observed that, while his patient had had the general ability to distinguish between darkness and light with his impaired sight, after the operation ... the faint Ideas he had of them before, were not sufficient for him to know them by afterwards; and therefore he did not tiink them the same, teraire et obsession collective (Paris, 1975); David Brion Davis, The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Revolution, 1770-1832 (Ithaca, N.Y., 1975); Edward J.

Now Scarlet he thought the most beautful of all Colours, and of others the most gay were the most pleasing, whereas the first Time he saw Black, it gave him great Uneasi- ness, yet after a little Time he was reconcil'd to it; but some Months after, seeing by Accident a Negroe Woman, he was struck with great Horror at the Sight.3 For Cheselden the "Negroe Woman" was the anthropomorphic rep- resentation of the terror of darkness. Inherent in his observation were echoes of Plotinus' conviction that darkness was one of the sources of the ugly (Ennead I.6.5 and V.8). Here, however, the question of the inherent nature of the object observed was not raised; rather Cheselden's scientific interest concentrated on the reaction of the observer. The moral implications of the neoplatonic dichotomy of light and darkness did, however, still seem to play a role in the eval- uation of Blackness in the eighteenth century. Darkness remained universally equated with evil. The boy's terrified reaction to the sight of the Black was immedi- ate and intuitive. Cheselden's observations thus seemed to counter John Locke's presumptions on the nature of darkness in his Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1689-1691). Locke had ob- served, drawing on Molyneux's views concerning the nature of darkness, that while "great light be insufferable to our eyes, yet the highest degree of darkness does not at all disease them: because that, causing no disorderly motion in it, leaves that curious organ unarmed in its natural state."4 In nature darkness is neutral, causing neither pleasure nor pain. But man has associated darkness with fear, an emotion not inherent to it but acquired through association: "The ideas of goblins and sprites have really no more to do with darkness than light: yet let a foolish maid inculcate these often on the mind of a child, and raise them there together, possibly he shall 3William Cheselden, "An Account of some Observations made by a young Gentleman, who was born blind, or lost his sight so early, that he had no Re- membrance of ever having seen, and was couched between 13 and 14 Years of Age," Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, 35 (1727-1728), 447-48. 4 John Locke, An Essay concerning Human Understanding, ed. Alexander C. Fraser (Oxford, 1897), II, vii, 4. The Lockean categories reappear in Francis Hutcheson's An Inquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue (1726; rpt. New York, 1971), p. 91, where Hutcheson emphasizes that "Aver- sions . . . rais'd to Darkness" are "strong Associations of Ideas without any Rea- son, by mere Accident sometimes. . . ." But he also postulates the existence of "disagreeable" as well as "beautiful" color as products of a "natural sense of Beauty."</page><page sequence="4">376 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES never be able to separate them again so long as he lives, but darkness shall ever afterwards bring with it those frightful ideas, and they shall be so joined, that he can no more bear one than the other" (II, xxxiii, 10). Yet if the apprehensive reaction to Blackness illus- trated in Cheselden's essay was intuitive, then Locke's presumption that fear is a learned response to darkness was faulty. The fundamental concept that darkness and fear are associated only through the learning process was questioned and rebutted in Edmund Burke's Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1757).5 Burke drew on Cheselden as the source of his view that fear and darkness were inseparably intertwined in the nature of perception. Burke counters Locke in observing that the general association ". . . which takes in all mankind may make dark- ness terrible; for in utter darkness, it is impossible to know in what degree of safety we stand.. ." (p. 143). But Burke's pnrme argument lies not in the realm of association but of the inherent human reac- tion to darkness. It is in this context that he refers to Cheselden's essay: Perhaps it may appear on enquiry, that blackness and darkness are in some degree painful by their natural operation, independent of any associations whatsoever. I must observe, that the ideas of darkness and blackness are much the same; and they differ only in this, that blackness is a more con- fined idea. Mr. Cheselden has given us a very curious story of a boy, who had been born blind, and continued so until he was ftiirteen or fourteen years old; he was then couched for a cataract, by which operation he re- ceived his sight. Among many remarkable particulars that attended his first perceptions, and judgments on visual objects, Cheselden tells us, that the first time the boy saw a black object, it gave him great uneasiness; and that some time after, upon accidently seeing a negro woman, he was struck with great horror at the sight. The horror, in this case, can scarcely be supposed to arise from any association. (pp. 144-45) Burke views Blackness as "but a partial darkness; and therefore it derives some of its powers from being mixed and surrounded with coloured bodies. In its own nature, it cannot be considered a colour" (p. 147). Blackness is a negative force in the realm of perception. 5 Edmund Burke, A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and the Beautiful, ed. James T. Boulton (Notre Dame, Indiana, 1958), p. 149. Compare Nicolson, Newton Demands the Muse, pp. 128-31 and Samuel H. Monk, The Sublime: A Study of the Critical Theories of XVIII-Century England (Ann Arbor, Michigan, 1960), pp. 84-100.</page><page sequence="5">THE BLACK IN GERMAN AESTHETIC THEORY 377 Following Cheselden's observations, he concludes that "after we have been used to the sight of black objects, the terror abates. . (148-49) though Blackness "will always have something melan- choly in it, because the sensory will always find the change to it from other colours too violent. . ." (149). Acclimatization can only mod- ify the inherent emotional effect of Blackness, it cannot alter it. Here Burke adapts a variation of Plato's refusal in the Phaedrus (247C6), to assign either color or shape to "the world of forms," his real being. Color has an implicit value in the classical view, as it does in Burke's aesthetics.6 Most revealing of the underlying premises of Burke's as well as Cheselden's perceptual category of Blackness is their total accep- tance of the anthropomorphism of darkness as the fearsome figure of the Black. Blackness, and therefore the Black, produces terror and is therefore a source of the sublime. For Burke this fear has a physiological source, since darkness causes tension in the muscles of the eye and it is this tension which is perceived as frightening. Thus Negrophobia, irrational in its manifestation, is given an epis- temological rationale by Burke, in order to explain, not the nature of the Black, but rather the fear engendered in the mind of the European by the very appearance of Blackness. Burke places the Black among those natural forces which can generate the sublime. Sublimity, however, is defined by Burke in terms of domination: "...we submit to what we admire, but we love what submits to us; in one case we are forced, in the other we are flattered into compli- ance" (p. 113). Viewing the Black as a source of the sublime entails an acceptance of the premise that the observer is moved to fear through the perception of a force greater than himself. This is the effect of the perception of Blackness on the muscles of the eye, which are forced to strain themselves beyond their limits. Blackness is, therefore, a factor which not only makes the Black unique among the races of men, it is also an aesthetic feature which makes him grand, at least to the European eye. 6For an analysis of the figure of the Black in eighteenth-century German drama under French influence see my essay, "The Image of Slavery in Two Eighteenth-Century German Dramas," Germanic Review, 45 (1970), 26-40; for the application of the aesthetics of Blackness see my essays: "'Das-ist-der-Teu-fel- si-cher-lich': The Image of the Black on the Viennese Stage from Schikaneder to Grillparzer" in the forthcoming Festschrift for Heinz Politzer and "The Aesthetics of Blackness in Heinrich von Kleist's 'Die Verlobung in Santo Domingo,"' MLN (forthcoming).</page><page sequence="6">378 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES The reception of Burke's definition of the aesthetic nature of the fear of the Black was mixed. Few contemporary aestheticians ac- cepted his physiological explanation for Negrophobia. In their at- tempts to counter him they postulated alternative solutions to the enigma presented in Cheselden's case study. Burke's amalgamation of the categories of Blackness (as a personal attribute) and darkness (as a cause of the sublime) was initially attacked by Arthur Murphy, who first reviewed the Enquiry in 1757: It does not appear that this boy had any ideas of the sublime, or that the negroe woman appeared magnificent in his eyes; his horror, we should think, proceeded from the novelty of an object so different from his fellow- creatures, and it does not appear that the coming of night was any way terrible to him, which we should imagine it would be at first, if darkness were terrible in its nature. We are therefore still apt to think Mr. Locke right in making darkness formidable from an association of ideas, and that association of ideas will help increase the sublime.7 Murphy attributes the terror caused by the color of the Black to the novelty of Blackness in a white society. But he returns to Locke's basic premise, that fear of darkness (here Blackness) is a learned response, in order to illuminate the horror generated by the Black's appearance. This rationale in no way mitigates the sense of terror present in the European's perception of the Black, but only ex- plained it as a socialized rather than an inherent response. Murphy accepted the reaction of the young boy as a natural one and only questioned the process by which Blackness and fear were linked. Another view of Burke's category of Blackness was offered by Moses Mendelssohn in his review of the Enquiry (1758): The color black has a great similarity to darkness, for it is nothing but limited darkness.... Here [in the case of Cheselden's observation] there is hardly an association of these concepts, thus this [reaction] must have its roots in a totally different source. The author believes that the effect of blackness can be attributed to the extraordinary expansion of the pupil of the eye, intrinsic to vision in darkness. Since, however, as the author ob- serves in the second section [of his study], every privation is terrifying, to which category one can hardly associate the expansion of the pupil, it 7Arthur Murphy, "Review of Burke's Enquiry," Literary Magazine, 2 (1757), 188.</page><page sequence="7">THE BLACK IN GERMAN AESTHETIC THEORY 379 seems that one could more easily consider darkness, as well as blackness, as a type of privation, and thus explain their effects.8 The privation of darkness is the obliteration of all perceptual dis- tinctions, as James Thomson observed: Order confounded lies, all beauty void, Distinction lost, and gay variety One universal blot.... 9 While altering the category to explain the nature of Blackness, Mendelssohn did not argue against the correctness of Burke's basic assumption concerning the effect of the Black. He only suggested another source for the sense of terror, the deprivation of the senses. Here Mendelssohn parallels Voltaire's incorporation of Cheselden's essay into his discussion of the nature of visual privation and its effects on the nature of perception.10 While Mendelssohn accepted as an inherent response that which Murphy had relegated to the realm of the learned, both critics saw the response to the Black in aesthetic terms. The Black was an object to which certain specific reactions were connected. The categories of terror and Blackness were inextricably associated at this point and the Black was reduced to the effect of his Blackness. This process of dehumanization was 46 * * organized, for reasons of historical accident, mental fantasy and biological fact, about the perception of body colors.

In 1766 Lessing published his own major contribu- tion to aesthetic theory, Laokoon oder (2ber die Grenzen der Malerei und Poesie. In the twenty-fourth chapter Lessing refers to Men- delssohn's views concerning the outer limits of the beautiful, the realm of the disgusting: A sagacious critic has already made the remark concerning the sensation of disgust. "The representations of fear," he says, "of sadness, of terror, of pity and so on, can only excite discomfort in so far as we take the evil to be actual. These, therefore, can be resolved into pleasant sensations by the recollection that it is but an artistic deceit. The unpleasant sensation of disgust, however, in virtue of the laws of the imagination, ensues on the mere representation in the mind whether the subject be considered as actual or not."12 The initial category is taken from Burke, the sublime as the product of the actualization of fear, as in Burke's perception of the Black. However, it is the disgusting, a category missing from Burke's aesthe- tics, which is introduced by Mendelssohn and Lessing to move the question of the perception of the Black to a different cognitive plane. Contrary to existing theories of the ugly, Lessing imagined cer- tain features of the representational arts which can evoke disgust: "A scar in the face, a hare-lip, a flattened nose with prominent nos- trils, an entire absence of eyebrows, are uglinesses which are not offensive either to smell, taste, or touch. At the same time it is cer- tain that these things produce a sensation that certainly comes much nearer to disgust than what we feel at sight of other deformities of body. . ." (p. 148). Disgust is not limited to the lower senses, even the highest sense, sight, can transmit it. It is in the category of the visually disgusting that Lessing classifies the perception of the Black, if only obliquely. For "a flattened nose with prominent nostrils" ["iene gepleschte Nase mit vorragenden Liochern"] was, in the icon- ography of the eighteenth century, a visual metaphor for the inherent 12 Gotthold Ephraim Lessings Simtliche Werke, ed. Karl Lachmann and Franz Muncker (Stuttgart, 1893), DX, 143. (Trans. William A. Steele, Lessing, Laocoon [London, 1970], pp. 89 ff.) The present analysis relies heavily on Herbert Dieck- mann, "Das Abscheuliche und Schreckliche in der Kunsttheorie des 18 Jahrhun- derts," in H. R. Jauss, ed., Die Nicht Mehr Schonen Kiinste.

Lessing introduced the concept of Blackness only indirectly into the category of the disgusting through his reference to the physiog- nomy of the Black. He had earlier employed in the Lackoon the Homeric figure of Thersites as an illustration for the possibility of the ugly to function as the source of the comic. The disgusting is closely related to the ugly and also possessed the potential for gen- erating the comic: The drollest strokes of this kind occur in the Hottentot tale, Tquassouw and Knonmquaiha, in the Connoisseur, an English weekly magazine full of humour, ascribed to Lord Chesterfield. Everyone knows how filthy the Hottentots are and how many things they consider beautiful and elegant and sacred which with us awaken disgust and aversion. A flattened cartilage of a nose, flabby breasts hanging down to the navel, the whole body smeared with a cosmetic of goat's fat and soot gone rotten in the sun, the hair dripping with grease, arms and legs bound about with fresh entrails-let one think of this as the object of an ardent, reverent, tender love; let one hear this uttered in the exalted language of gravity and admiration and refrain from laughter! (p. 149) To support his contention conceming the figure of the Black as the source of laughter through the application of the category of the disgusting, Lessing quoted passages from the original tale in the Connoisseur: Concering the beauty of Knonmquaiha he wrote: He was struck with the glossy hue of her complexion, which shone like the jetty down on the black hogs of Hessaqua; he was ravished with the prest gristle of her nose; and his eyes dwelt with admiration on the flaccid beauties of her breasts, which descended to her navel. And what did art add to place her beauty in its most advantagous light? She made a varnish of the fat of goats mixed with soot, with which she annointed her whole body, as she stood beneath the rays of the sun; her locks were clotted with molted grease, and pow- dered with the yellow dust of Buchu; her face, which shone like polished T"I'no WI lniltifiill?I u7RiA with vrto rof I.Arl iMo,th (n 1 AQ IS De L'Esprit des Lois par Montesquieu (Paris, 1871), p. 223.

He chose for this category the figure of the Hottentot, in whom ethnolo- gists of the late seventeenth century supposedly found a "link be- tween man and the apes" and whose "brutish appearance and bestial customs became stereotyped in the literature of the follow- ing century."15 The sense of racial and cultural superiority inherent in Lessing's choice is clear. He chose the antithesis of the civilized concept of beauty in the stereotype of the Hottentot and, therefore, saw, as the source of the comic, the juxtaposition of these contra- dictory norms. The tale of Tquassouw and Knonmquaiha was not merely a par- ody of the theme of the noble savage. It presented a skeptical re- categorization of all standards of beauty and is, therefore, of primary importance for the reevaluation of the role played by the figure of the Black in German aesthetic theory of the eighteenth century. Eng- lish thought had viewed standards of beauty as relative to culture as early as Sir Thomas Browne, who had observed in his Pseudodoxia Epidemica (1672): ... whereas men affirm this colour was a Curse, I cannot make out the propriety of that name, it neither seeming so to them, nor reasonably unto us; for they take so much content therein, that they esteem deformity by other colours, describing the Devil, and terrible objects, white. And if we seriously consult the definitions of beauty, and exactly perpend what wise men detemine thereof, we shali not apprehend a curse, or any deformity therein.-6 The author of Lessing's source provided an ironic portrait of the Black in keeping with the above view, an opinion also echoed by Sir Joshua Reynolds in the Idler for 10 November 1759. However, Lessin.a's selection of quotations illustrated only one asDect of the 14A.

His body was enwrapped with strange coverings, which concealed every part from sight, except his face and hands. Upon his skin the sun darted his scorching rays in vain, and the colour of it was pale and wan as the watery beams of the moon. His hair, which he could put on and take off at pleasure, was white as the blossoms of the almond tree, and bushy as the fleece of the ram. His lips and cheeks resembled the red oker, and his nose was sharpened like the beak of an eagle. His language, which was rough and inarticulate, was as the language of beasts; nor could Tquassouw discover his meaning, till an Hottentot (who at the first coming of these people had been taken prisoner, and had afterwards made his escape) interpreted between them. This interpreter informed the prince, that the stranger was sent from his fellow countrymen to treat about the enlargement of their territories, and that he was called, among them, Mynheer van Snickersee.17 Here the European is presented as the exotic figure in a manner reminiscent of Montesquieu's Lettres persanes (1721). He is a figure not explicable in the terms of the values of the Black observer. While evidently antiprimitivistic in its intent, this tale attempts to draw into question all standards of perception based on racial or cultural criteria. Not only is the "beauty" of the Hottentots pre- sented in an ironic manner in European terms, so, too, is the figure of the European viewed from an ironic point of view, that of the Black. Lessing made use of only the former in the Laokoon. His view of the Black was rooted in his evaluation of Blackness as in- herently disgusting, parallel to Burke's view of the Black as in- herently terrifying. For Lessing the physiognomy of the Black is repellent; his practices are merely laughable. The social conven- tions in Burke's and Lessing's aesthetics are rooted in their sense of the inherent differences between the nature of the European and that of the Black. The fiction of the Black as intrinsically different is maintained through the rationalization of the perception of Blackness. What has been altered in Lessing's study is the categori- 17 Connoisseur, 1, No. 21 (20 June 1754), 165-66.</page><page sequence="12">384 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES zation of the effect of this perception. For Lessing postulated not terror but laughter as the ultimate effect of the perception of the Black. The concept of relativism introduced ironically into the percep- tion of Blackness in the Connoisseur reappeared in altered form in the writings of Christoph Martin Wieland. In Agathon (1766/1767) Wieland proposed an "anti-platonic" aesthetics, which referred to the same visual image of the Black as that which Lessing employed to categorize the Black as a source for the comically disgusting: Imagine a meeting of as many lovers as there are nations in all the direc- tions of heaven. What is more sure, than that each will praise his beloved above all others? The European will prefer brilliant white, the Moor, the raven-like black of his beloved. The Greek will prefer the small mouth; a breast, able to be covered with a cupped hand; and the pleasing regular- ity of a fine form; the African, a flattened nose, oily skin, and swollen lips.... . . Does this have anything to do with the beautiful in a moral sense, I doubt it.18 Wieland returned to Lockean categories for his argument. His view of the nature of beauty, however, was much more directly indebted to Lord Kames than it was to Locke. In the Elements of Criticism (1762), Lord Kames had observed: "The various colours, though they affect us differently, are all of them agreeable in their purity: but custom has regulated this matter in another manner; a black skin upon a human being is to us disagreeable, and a white skin probably not less so to a negro."'9 Thus Wieland, in his Geschichte der Abderiten (1781) expanded on this social recategorization of aes- thetic standards. At the opening of the novel Demokritus described his travels through the various lands of the known world to the fool- ish inhabitants of Abdera: 18 C.M. Wieland, Sdmmtliche Werke (Leipzig, 1856), IV, 111-12. The concept of ethical relativism had been established in regard to the Black in Wieland's "Reise des Priesters Abulfauris ins innere Afrika" (1770). 19Henry Home, Lord Kames, Elements of Criticism, 2nd ed.

Those who live deeper inland and in the tropic climate are as black from head to foot, even blacker, than the ravens in Abdera. "What you say! -And aren't they afraid of one another, when they see each other?" Afraid? Why? They please one another in their raven-like blackness, and find that nothing could be more beautiful. "Oh, that is funny!" -cried the Abderites. -"Black all over their entire body, as if covered with pitch and believing themselves beautiful! What a dumb race!" (XIII, 32-33) Wieland's view of the nature of beauty had moved from a modi- fied relativism in Agathon to a total relativism in the Geschichte der Abderiten. In the former he postulated a natural model for beauty, relative to each climate and culture, but still believed there to be the potential for some type of universal standard rooted in these relativistic catgories. Thus he was able to choose the relatively most beautiful of the appropriate appearances of man, the Spartan for male beauty and the Persian for female beauty. But in the Geschichte der Abderiten, Demokritus complained: "It is not my fault if Greek ugliness is beauty in Ethiopia. Also I don't see what can justify me to decide between the Greek and the Ethiopian. I guess that it could be that both are right" (XIII, 39). Even a Euro- pean can be made to understand the total relativity of beauty when confronted by it outside of his own cultural context. While Wieland no longer made Blackness a key to a specific perceptual response, aesthetic categories remained central to his understanding of the Black. However, he had moved from the ironic mode of relativism present in the Connoisseur to a new, less encumbered approach to the aesthetic evaluation of the Black. A The concept of the relative evaluation of the Black moved from aesthetic speculation to the area of political reality in the writings of Johann Gottfried Herder. In Ideen zur Philosophie der Geschich- te der Menschheit (1785), Herder echoed Wieland's recategoriza- tion of the Black, recalling Lord Kames's view: With the same right that we hold the black to be a damned son of Ham and an image of the devil could he consider his horrid captors Albinos and</page><page sequence="14">386 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES white devils, who have only degenerated as many animals degenerate as they approach the north pole. I, he could say, I the black, am original man.20 Herder's reassessment of the Black, while couched in aesthetic terms, alters the category into which the Black is placed from the aesthetic to the political. His concern lies with the exploitation of the Black through European society. Blackness, for Herder, is not a special category,- but rather one of many differentiations existing in nature: "The black color of the Black is no more remarkable in its art than the white, brown, yellow, or red of other nations. Neither the blood nor the brain nor the semen of the Black is black, but the net under the skin, which we all have and that in us, at least in certain parts and under certain circumstances, is more or less col- ored" (XIII, 233). But Blackness does have a specific connotation in white society: it is the exterior sign through which the European rationalizes the inferiority of the Black and permits his exploitation in the slave trade. In the tenth Brief zu Befoirderung der Humanitdt (1797) Herder emphasized the fact that nature does not contain a hierarchy of color: "The naturalist does not postulate an order of merit among creatures which he observes; all are of equal value and concern. Thus to the human naturalist. The Black has as much right to con- sider the White a mutant, a born vermin, as the white has to con- sider him a beast, a black animal" (XVIII, 248). Color has no other implication than that given it by the observer. In calling on ethnol- ogy as one of the descriptive sciences for his proof, Herder may well have had in mind Johann Friedrich von Blumenbach's De generis humani varietate nativa (1775) which argued that the Black was in no way different from any other species of mankind, even to the modulation of color within his race.2' Herder specifically condemned the destruction of Black society through the slave trade. In his view the skin color of the Europeans 20 Herders Simmtliche Werke, ed. Bernhard Suphan (Berlin, 1887), XIII, 228.

(XVIII, 222). For Herder the European has become a white devil. The relativism of aesthetics is here transferred to the political realm. Voltaire had provided a model for this ironic reversal of roles in his earlier "Histoire des voyages de Scamentado" (1756) when the voyager, captured by Black pirates off the coast of Africa asks ". . . pourquoi ils violaient ainsi les lois des nations." The Black captain of the pirates answers: "Vous avez le nez long, et nous l'avons plat; vos cheveux sont tout droits, et notre laine est frisee; vous avez la peau de couleur de cendre, et nous de couleur d'ebene; par consequent nous devons, par les lois sacrees de la nature, etre toujours ennemis."22 Voltaire's relativistic presentation of Black slavers imprisoning whites is echoed in Herder's general political reassessment of the category of the Black. While he suc- ceeded in freeing the concept of the Black from its negative impli- cations, he presented a transference of the onus of color to the European. Relativism is maintained, even though the roles are reversed. In his review of Herder's Ideen zur Philosophie der Geschichte der Menschheit (1785), Immanuel Kant strongly qualified Herder's relativistic presentation of the nature of the Black: . . .American [Indians] and Blacks are lower in their mental capacities than all other races. On the other hand, however, if the apparent informa- tion is accepted that they, in regard to their natural capacity, are equal to all other races, it sfill remains to the philosopher whether he will accept such natural distinctions or judge everything on the basis of tout comme chez nous. If this is undertaken then all of his systems constructed on such a shaky foundation, will have the aura of a dilapidated hypothesis.23 Kant's argument against Herder's view of the relativism of racial 22 Voltaire, EEuvres completes, XXI, 131. 23Immanuel Kants Sdmmtliche Werke, ed.

For in that essay Kant did not limit his discus- sion to the purely biological distinctions of race but postulated a relationship between human qualities and race: "In addition the damp warmth is advantageous for the rapid growth of animals, and thus, the Black is such a Product, well-suited for his climate, that is, strong, fleshy, supple, but, through the rich bounty of his mother land, lazy, soft, and frivolous" (II, 445). Kant's observation con- cerning the relationship between skin color and climate is extended in order to characterize the Black in a most negative manner. Kant's view of the Black, both in his review of Herder's work and in his first essay on race, is derived from his reading of David Hume's "Of National Characters" (1753/1754). In a note Hume commented: "I am apt to suspect the Negroes to be naturally in- ferior to the Whites. There scarcely ever was a civilized nation of that complexion, nor even any individual, eminent either in action or speculation. No ingenious manufactures among them, no arts, no sciences.... Such a uniform and constant difference could not happen, in so many countries and ages, if nature had not made an original distinction between these breeds of men."24 It is the quality of Blackness which sets the Black apart from the other races in terms of his creativity, according to Hume. In Kant's Beobachtun- gen uiber das Gefuihl des Schonen und Erhabenen (1764), this fea- ture was introduced to explain the existence of racially determined modes of perception: The Blacks of Africa naturally have no sense which exceeds the childish. Mr. Hume requests that anyone cite a single example when a Black has shown talent, and observes: that among the hundreds of thousand of Blacks who were kidnapped from their lands, although many have been set free, not a single one has been found who has exhibited greatness in art or science or in any other notable area, although among the Whites there are those who constantly rise from the lowest rabble and achieve notice in the world through their notable gifts. So evident is the difference be- tween the two races, that it seems as great in the abilities of the mind as in their color. The widely practiced religion of fetishism is a type of 24 The Philosophical Works of David Hume (Boston, 1854), III, 228-29. A positive statement of the nature of Blackness in regard to skin color is to be found in William Hogarth, The Analysis of Beauty [1753], ed. Joseph Burke (Oxford, 1955), p. 125.</page><page sequence="17">THE BLACK IN GERMAN AESTHETIC THEORY 389 idolatry which is as childish as is possible for human nature. A bird's feather, a cow's horn, a shell or any other common object as soon as it is hallowed through a few words, becomes an object of veneration and ap- peal in the taking of oaths. Blacks are vain, but in the manner of Blacks, and so talkative that they must be driven apart with blows.25 For the precritical Kant Blackness is a state which negatively pre- determines the aesthetic sensibility and proclivity of the observer. By 1785 Kant's view of the Black underwent modification. In his second essay on race, "Die Bestimmung des Begriffs einer Men- schenrasse" (1785), following his review of Rerder, all negative value judgments concerning the nature of the Black have been eli- minated. Kant focuses exclusively on his theory concerning the nature of pigmentation and its relationship to climate.26 By the first edition of the Critik der Urtheilskraft (1790) this alteration in ap- proach was also evident in his aesthetic theory. In his discussion of the "Ideale der Schonheit," Kant denies the existence of objective criteria for aesthetic judgment: "There are no objective rules of taste determined by set concepts. For all judgment from this source is aesthetic, i.e., the feeling of the subject and not the concept of the object is its determination."27 Thus Kant emphasizes the unique- ness of the perception of the Black while modifying his negative evaluation of this singularity: If, in a similar manner, one sought for an average man, an average head, for this head an average nose, etc., the basis for this would be the norma- tive idea of the beautiful in that land where this comparison took place. Th- *U- R01-1- -,.-4.U -ey Aa__,4 L;lmn nnio dn of hkmn-r+tr t1hnn n 25 II, 276-77. Kant emphasizes this fact in his discussion of the role of the woman in Black society. There the woman is "in deepest slavery . . .: A timorous man is always a hard task master among weaklings. . . ." He concludes with the complaint of the Black that Europeans ". . . allow your women too much and afterward you complain, when they make you mad." Kant's comment, without a trace of irony, stands as his final condemnation of the Black through his inter- pretation of the significance of skin color: "It is as if something stated here should have been considered; but alone the fact that this fellow was black from head to foot was sufficient indication that what he said was dumb" (II, 278). Kant's relationship to Burke's Enquiry was evident even to their contemporaries, cf. Johann Georg Hamann's review of the Beobachtungen (30 April 1764), in his Sadmtliche Werke, ed. Josef Nadler (Vienna, 1952), IV, 259-92. 28 IV, 228-29. 27V, 237.

This normative idea is not extrapolated from proportions taken from experience but only after it is formed is judgment possible. (V, 140) The ideal of normative beauty is racially determined. For Kant each race produces an archetype of beauty which constitutes the form of the concept of beauty. This presentation is correct in regard to the presentation of normative rather than ideal beauty. Thus Kant modi- fies his view that all aesthetic perceptions are culturally determined, for he concludes his argument by indicating the ethical component in aesthetic judgment: "The correctness of such an ideal of beauty is indicated in that it is not possible to mix sensual cognition with the satisfaction in the object, and yet allows great interest to be taken. This indicates that such a judgment according to such a stan- dard cannot be purely aesthetical, and that a judgment in accord- ance with an ideal of beauty is not merely a judgment of taste."28 Indeed Kant's elimination of Lessing's category of the disgusting and his modification of Burke's empiricism altered the categories formerly applied to the figure of the Black in such a way as to make such an approach impossible. Kant's concept of the aesthetic as a "sensus communis," adapting Shaftesbury's category, was the last stage of the figure of the Black in German aesthetic theory during the eighteenth century. In the development of the aesthetic theory of the eighteenth cen- tury the treatment of the Black underwent substantial alteration. Be- ginning with Burke the Black had been viewed as an object of aesthetic perception. The central interest of aestheticians was the mode of the European's reaction to him. The uniqueness of the Black in Western Europe had as its result this attempt to explain the negative reaction to the Black. Racism, as a force, was explained in terms of perception. With the ever greater awareness of the politi- cal exploitation of the Black through the institution of slavery, the question shifted ground. More and more, aestheticians asked whether 28 V, 241-42.

Racism gave way to the question of cultural relativism. The Black attained, by the end of the century, the position of an observer rather than an object perceived. The anthropomorphism of darkness was completed and the Black stood as an individual, perceiving reality, rather than as the embodiment of a natural force. Cornell University</page></plain_text>
