Early initiated in Iran in the Shi'ite intellectual tradition of his homeland, he went as a young man to the United States of America where he graduated in physics at the Μ. Ι. Τ. and then to Harvard University where he did his doctoral work in the field of history of science. His numerous publications cover not only the history of science in Islam and of Islamic studies in general but also of comparative religion and the comparative study of civilizations and religions. Within the context of this wide scholarly universe S. H. Nasr displays a knowledge of the history of Christian and Western thought that re- mains rare indeed among Muslim scholars of our day. Over the past two decades or so S. H. Nasr has been increasingly concerned with discerning "the spiri- tual crisis" or "the plight of modern man" as he has put it in the title of two of his recent books. This crisis affects Muslims and non-Muslims. Nasr's critical endeavour ad- dresses all humankind insofar as it is in danger of losing its soul to "the aberrations and deviations of modern times" (22) which, in his view, are caused ultimately by Satan, the master of confusion. Whereas in earlier works Nasr had studied a num- ber of traditional Islamic views that are in confrontation with the modern world, the present volume concentrates on the contrast between traditional Islam and its revival- ist and "fundamentalist" manifestations. These are marked by a "cultural and religious frustration before the onslaught of Western culture and the desire to reas- sert themselves in the name of Islam" (305). They may manifest themselves by recourse to revolutionary jargon drawn from the West or by a puritanical, rationalistic in- terpretation of Islam which would do away with the whole Islamic intellectual and spiritual tradition in the name of a primordial purity no longer attainable. The latter, puritanical and rationalist interpretation, at least accepts the shari'ah, the part of "fundamentalism" clos- est to traditional Islam. The first part of the book turns to some of the basic facets of the Islamic tradition that are being widely dis- cussed and, Nasr insists, not rarely distortingly por- trayed these days. Jihad has been one-sidedly translated as "holy war," taking as the basis its juridical meaning, eclipsing its inner and spiritual significance. Inner jihad, i.e., basic spiritual effort, is not an additional, sixth "pil- lar" of Islam but rather resides within all the other (five) "pillars." A study of work ethics as described in the tra- ditional Islamic sources and found within traditional Is- lam itself, brings out the permanent value of what this notion signifies. In an analysis of the relationship be- tween the male and the female Nasr lays bare the meta- physical and psychological foundations in Islam of the male/female relationship. In the second part of the work Nasr clarifies his view of the confrontation of traditional Islam with mod- ernism which, he maintains, is essentially based on and originates in the secularizing and humanistic tendencies of the European Renaissance. For Nasr "'modern' means that which is cut off from the Transcendent, from the immutable principles which in reality govern all things and which are made known to man through reve- lation in its most universal sense" (98). Modernism, for him, implies all that is merely human and now ever more increasingly subhuman. Throughout history tradition has characterized human existence. It has accompanied life as its sacral dimension, as awareness of the afterlife and of the world of the Spirit, and has given man the knowledge of being the vicegerent (khalifah) of God. In contrast, the period of the domination of modernism, in other words, of divorce from the Divine source reaches only over the past 450 years or so, a fleeting moment in universal history. The modernist outlook thus is charac- terized by the elements of anthropomorphism, evolu- tion, and the loss of the sense of the sacred. Nasr's homo islamicus, in contrast, whilst he knows being on the earth and having earthly needs, yet he is not earthly and his needs are not limited to the terrestrial. He possesses the power of reason which divides and anal- yses, but his mental faculties, far from being limited to reason, possess the possibility of the knowledge of his own inner being which is, in fact, the key to the knowl- edge of God. He remains aware of the eschatological re- alities, and experiences the gradual illumination by the light of the spiritual world of the Unseen, the 'alam al-qhayb. Ultimately, modernity to Nasr is the rebellion of the creature against His Maker, the self-glorification of man who refuses to undergo the experience of fana' (an- nihilation) which would enable him to become "the mir- ror in which God contemplates the reflections of His own Names and Qualities" (104). The third part of the book studies the tensions be- tween traditional Islam and modernism in various cul- tural contexts: education, philosophy, and architecture cum city planning. The final part, by way of three fine presentations of western scholars of Islam (Louis Mas- signon, Henry Corbin, and Titus Burckhardt), demon- strates that, in contrast to modernism and fundamental- ism, "traditional Islam" adjudges Western scholarship of Islam by criteria of universal, traditional truth rather than by the accidental geographical and cultural condi- tioning of the scholars in question. Turning in his conclusion towards a prognosis, Nasr sees the Islamic world, like that of Christianity, becom- ing the battlefield "not between traditional Islam and openly declared secularism and modernism as was the case until recently" (314) but between traditional Islam and various counter-traditional and leftist ideologies pa- rading as Islam, in other words, between Islam as a reli- gion in its traditional sense and those who speak of it as ideology; between Islam as an ally of other traditional religions, including Christianity and Judaism, and the modern world which opposes not only Islam but religion as such. The present work is written in a lucid and fluent style that succeeds in conveying to the nonspecialist even abstract ideas and complicated issues. The author impresses by his comprehensive and ecumenical outlook and knowledge. He speaks with authority on matters Anthropos 85.1990</page><page sequence="3">Rezensionen 255 ranging from the classical to the modern sciences, cover- ing eastern and western civilizations without incurring the dangers of superficiality or hasty generalization. Underlying all his detailed argument would seem to be a basic understanding of the meaning of divine tran- scendence as well as of the relationship obtaining be- tween God and man and, consequently, of history and development that itself is never made in this work the object of critical inquiry. This "pre-understanding" as it were (Vorverstehen) is simply presumed to be correct, the pure and direct outflow of a "genuine" and "true," inner, classically-religious perception of reality. Nasr presents "traditional Islam," and traditional religion for that matter, as if all the philosophical and theological search of the past three or four centuries in the West had been pure aberration and confusion. Mus- lim scholars and thinkers of the stature, for instance, of the late Fazlur Rahman or Muhammad Arkoun who, in their effort to respond to modern questions, search for a renewed hermeneutics of Quran, Tradition, and dogma would seem to merit more than a flat rejection as facilely labelled "modernists." The efforts in modern Christian theology to reconstruct theological thought as a meta- physical and theological anthropology which tries to re- spond to the fact that the word of God is heard historical- ly and endeavours to do justice to the historicity of man as his fundamental attribute would seem to merit the dia- logical attention of a religious thinker who has set out to address a worldwide audience. Nasr's basically esoteric and idealistic approach goes a long way to explain his ap- parent disregard for the ways in which the realm of thought, ideas, and norms interrelates with that of so- cial, cultural, and political factors in all their baffling va- riety. The present work as well as the related earlier ones by S. H. Nasr admirably states one important perception of Islam as put forward powerfully by a whole school of contemporary Muslim scholars (cf. Martin Lings, Gay Eaton, Frithjof Schuon, Titus Burckhardt, and others). It thus helps to appreciate the plurality of contemporary Islamic religious opinion and the tensions obtaining be- tween the varying intellectual approaches and religious options within the Muslim community today. Nasr, also, challenges Christian theology to articulate, in conversa- tion with the other religious traditions, its specific under- standing of transcendence and immanence, of revelation and history, and of similar crucial themes, in response to the challenges of the school of contemporary Muslim thought S. H. Nasr so eloquently represents. A future re-edition of the work might like to correct a small error on page 271: the monastery of Toumliline in the Atlas Mountains was not Dominican but Benedic- tine. Christian W.
