<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Mystery of Distance: Berkeley and Byron PAUL M. CURTIS What seems beautiful to me, what I should like to write, is a book about nothing, a book dependent upon nothing external, which would be held together by the internal struggle of its style, just as the earth, suspended in the void, depends on nothing external for its support; a book which would have almost no subject, or at least in which the subject would be almost invisible, if such a thing is possible. The finest works are those that contain the least matter; the closer expression comes to thought, the closer language comes to coinciding and merging with it, the finer the result. I believe the future of art lies in this direction. I see it, as it has developed from its begin- nings, growing progressively more ethereal. From Egyptian pylons to Gothic lancets, from the 20,ooo-line Hindu poems to the effusions of Byron. Form, in becoming more skilful, becomes attenuated; it leaves behind all liturgy, rule, measure; the epic is discarded in favor of the novel, verse in favor of prose; there is no longer any orthodoxy, and form is as free as the will of its creator. . . . It is for this reason that there are no noble subjects or ignoble subjects; from the standpoint of pure Art one might establish the axiom that there is no such thing as subject--style in itself being an absolute manner of seeing things. Gustave Flaubert, letter to Louise Colet, 16 January 1852. ANT ANT O XI of Don Juan begins with a critique of the philoso- phy of the Bishop of Cloyne, George Berkeley (1685-1753).1 Byron's parabasis has two important implications: that Berkeley is an anomalous figure in the sense that his writings constitute a digression from the empiricist mainstream. In the second case, the parabasis privi- leges our narrator's perceptions of reality as "true" in spite of (or thanks i.

The matter of Don Juan is imminent, we presume yet again, and Juan begins his English sojurn from the top of Shooter's Hill. In stanzas one and two, Byron scoffs at Berkeley's immaterialism with a brio that is typicallyJuanesque: When Bishop Berkeley said 'there was no matter', And proved it-'twas no matter what he said: They say his system 'tis in vain to batter, Too subtle for the airiest human head; And yet who can believe it! I would shatter Gladly all matters, down to stone or lead, Or adamant, to find the World a spirit, And wear my head, denying that I wear it. (xI. I-8) Outrageous punning, reported speech and ambiguous testimony are forms of rhetorical piano-tuning, of course, but tuning with a curious purpose. Ironic reflection upon Berkeley provides a beginning for the canto, no small feat in a poem whose insouciant narrator declares else- where, "Nothing so difficult as a beginning / In poesy, unless perhaps the end.. ." (Iv. 1-2). Despite the facetious tone, the subject of Berkeley has poetical efficacy. The point to note here is that the critique of Berkeley is not simply irreverent attitudinizing. Byron makes poetry by way of Berkeley's idealist philosophy, the foremost tenet of which is esse est percipi. Sub- merged within Byron's irony, then, is another topic: the possibility of poetry as epistemology. The insistence upon "matter" recalls a philo- sophical issue essential to eighteenth-century poetry: how we come to know our world, and how language is the type of knowledge that makes all others possible. Byron trivializes Berkeley in order to parody the autonomous and creating self of high Romanticism: the self that makes the "Universe universal Egotism" (xI. Io). But within the digressive context of this opening the concept of subjectivity increases in magni- tude. Are we to take the word of a persona whose equivocations are at times aggressive? With studied improvisation Byron raises the complex subjectivity of perception; in particular, how subjectivity makes the sim- ple act of seeing creative. This manner of seeing is described otherwise by Edward Young in</page><page sequence="3">Berkeley and Byron 6 I "Night vi" of his Night Thoughts (1742-5). Speaking of our eyes as "small inlet[s]," Locke's philosophical term for all the senses but primar- ily the visive faculty, Young describes how they "Take-in, at once, the landscape of the world . . . And half-create the wondrous world they see."2 Wordsworth takes over this passage for "Tintern Abbey" (1798), emphasizing the peculiar distinction between mere perception and seeing creatively. Being, as he says, "A lover of the meadows and the woods," Wordsworth ponders "the mighty world / Of eye, and ear, -both what they half-create, / And what perceive." Byron recalls a concept central to first-generation Romanticism via the parody of Berkeley. By linking the notion of "half-creating" with that of "words are things" (mi. 793), however, Byron tends to a Berkeleyan semiotics. How might observations on Berkeley figure in Byron's Don Juan? Byron's peculiar narrative method goes by the name "dilation," a term that signifies the occupation of narrative space without the usual correla- tive in time.4 Discursive exposition exceeds, even dwarfs, a poem's nar- rative. The dilatory mode is a common feature of eighteenth-century biblical orientalism and can be demonstrated in Coleridge's Kubla Khan or the medieval Christabel of Tarn Watling in which emblemata leap "out of the carver's brain."s Dilation in romance literature depends upon a stylistic excess in which an "errant" knight learns more about himself, his love, and life as a function of his digressions rather than from a prescribed direction. In terms of Byronic parody, narrative becomes a "hinge" for digression.6 This type of narrative opportunity qualifies humorously the function of the poet vis-a-vis the poem. We are left with the play of rhetoric, the signature of a "self" not limited by a fictional or historical identity. Byron's digressive method questions the ontological inevitability of sequence present in every poem. To see in a non-hierarchi- cal manner is a means to knowledge. 2. Young's Night Thoughts, ed.

I assume that eighteenth- century epistemology describes the means to knowledge rather than the object of knowledge; and secondly, that poetry of any period is similarly a means to knowledge. Byron's romantic epic Don Juan is very different from The Prelude or "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner"; it makes an aesthetic virtue of rhetorical indirection. Digression, as McGann points out, provides the locus of Don Juan's opportunities.7 The appeal of di- gression to Byron lies in its tremendous affective potential, and it would be a great understatement to describe digression as simply narrative disjunction. The disruption of linear or logical thought is the premise of its unique sequaciousness-Byron numbered himself one of the "un- chronological" (BL] v, 218). Can we say that Byronic digression is a way to knowledge? How does the reference to Berkeley, in the context of digression, substantiate this claim?8 Byron's rhetorical indirection is not simply stylistic waywardness. For Byron, indirection juxtaposes the concept of progress inherent in any narrative with images that have a frame of reference outside the narrative in progress. What happens in the poem, what it is about journalistically speaking, has less and less significance vis-a-vis the tremendous rhetorical action of the poetry. Don Juan's success is the relationship between the cognition formed by the erratic movement of the verse and the percep- tions words yield within this unusual rhetoric.9 One concept linking Byron and Keats is the materiality of language, part of the relationship between res and verba.10 The word becomes an 7.

Specificity of reference becomes indirectly a "sublime" occasion for meaning--in the words of Robert Duncan, an opening of the field. Poetry, Byron agrees, can accommodate opposing concepts in a single stanza. In our opening quotation, Berkeleyan "matter" is travestied as a philosophical abstraction. We cannot make sense of it because it is free from representational qualities. On the other hand, Byron makes the abstraction material with his rhetorical indirection: the redundancy of puns, polyptoton and apostrophe. Moreover, the discussion of matter occurs in digression, that is to say in a departure from the matter of the narrative. "Matter" becomes an event, if not a thing, of the creative imagination.1' One brief example which could serve as a guide would be the famous image of oaks as "green-rob'd senators" in Keats's Hyperion: A Fragment (1. 73). The image occurs in a simile at the conclusion of Thea's speech to the supine Saturn. The simile is epic in a romantic rather than a classical sense. Classical epic similes communicate general truths of humanity or Nature by way of particular observations in emotionally charged situa- tions.12 Instead, Keats's simile elaborates Thea's speech to the extent to which it may be considered a digression. The simile's incantatory imag- ery produces a sequential coherence altogether different and independent from its narrative point of departure. The simile momentarily takes our attention away from Thea's interlocutor-the aged Saturn and his awful stasis -and places it upon the nature of Thea's language. With his com- parison of tree and senator, Keats perceives a hierarchical correspondence between the grand occupation of space and the occupation of a grand political office in history. The poem's narrative and the perception yielded by this image are, however, at odds. How is the anachronism of an Imperial Roman senator significant? What is its epistemological value in Hyperion's description of the Titans' fall? An explanation lies in what Is. Byron discusses mind and matter in his second journal, entitled suggestively "Detached Thoughts," which he kept from 15 October 1821 to I8 May 1822: BL] Ix, 46. 12. See, for example, the Aeneid vI, 428-432, where the "airy crowd" of phantoms rush around Charon, "Thick as the leaves in autumns strow the woods": quoted in Virgil's Aeneid and Fourth ("Messianic") Eclogue in the Dryden Translation, ed. Howard Clarke (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1989), p. 155.</page><page sequence="6">64 Keats-Shelley Journal must have been a profound problem for Keats writing the Hyperion poems - the problem of inscribing a god's utterances without the cultural assumptions of early nineteenth-century English. In this example of seeing "as a God sees," Keats images a disjunction between space (a mighty oak) and time (a green-rob'd senator).13 Keats puts "senator" to work in a context antecedent to its etymology. More striking is the fact that the simile as a whole elaborates the partic- ular sequaciousness of Thea's speech- "So came these words and went" (I. 79). Thea's words come and go according to the sequential nature of language, but the perception yielded by "senator" abides by an alternative temporal mode. The metaphor is heuristic as an inscription of "mythical" language, as Keats would have it. An anthropomorphic image of mag- nificent bulk, hierarchical supremacy, and the rising cycle of green sum- mer is used to describe a grey-haired god. Keats puts the image to work by virtue of its difference from the subject. As such, the anachronistic concatenation of word and event forces us to evaluate once more the concepts of past, present and future, all of which are personified (or implied) by Hyperion's sibling Mnemosyne, the mother of the Muses. Does the utility of these concepts reside in the hierarchy of sequence they set forth? Such a utility is urizenic and discarded by Keats. We as twen- tieth-century readers of nineteenth-century epic fragment ponder the temporal ambiguity of senator-like oaks in the context of pre-history. For one moment, so to speak, the poem signifies extemporaneously, beyond the hierarchy that is time. Keats is writing at the beginning of time and language, and so "senator" is a means to poetical truth rather than its object. When we read Berkeley with an eye to Romantic poetry, Byron's estimation is not quite so simple as Johnson's.14 As we shall see, Berke- ley's epistemology has significant implications for language theory, the most important being that words are treated like things, not simply as referential tokens. Byron seems to share this view in the third Canto of 13. Keats, The Fall of Hyperion: A Dream, 1.3o4 (The Poems of John Keats, ed. Jack Stillinger [Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1978]). The OED cites Keats's usage of senator: "In a vaguer sense: A counsellor, statesman; a leader in State or Church." The OED traces the word's etymology to the Latin for "old, old man. 14.

(in.793-798) The "words are things" formula is one of metaphoric identification. The metonymic "ink" rhymes fortuitously with "think:" the act of writing associates symbiotically with cognition to form a diachronic "link" of human culture. A rhyme such as this is characteristic of Byron's word- play: what seems facetious in tone usually carries more trenchant possi- bilities. Our titular hero's name, for example, exemplifies the Byronic word as thing: our uncommon "hero" 'Ju-an' (I. I) is not another false "new one" (I. 2) but the only "true one" (I. 4), one whose apotropaic name places an alternate taste in poetry straight upon the reader's tongue.15 I make no claim that Byron was specifically influenced by Berkeley's philosophy as was Coleridge; but, instead try to raise a Berkeleyan aspect of Byron's poetics.16 My plan is to discuss briefly Berkeley's main argu- ments and outline his semiotics. The conclusions from this survey will then be applied to Don Juan. Wittily, Berkeley makes an issue of space in the title of his first publi- cation, Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision (1709). The figurative usage 15. "Naming is properly apotropaic: it allows something to be placed at a distance, outside the self" - Parker, Inescapable Romance, p. 68. 16. A perusal of Byron's collected letters does not reveal a reference to Berkeley; nor does Elizabeth French Boyd's "Byron's Library and His Reading," in her Byron's "Don Juan": A Critical Study (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1945); nor do the two sale catalogues (the one, 5-6 April 1816; the other, in 1827 after his death) of Byron's library: see Lord Byron: The Complete Miscellaneous Prose, ed. Andrew Nicholson (London: Oxford University Press, 199o), pp. 231-254. In Fiery Dust: Byron's Poetic Development (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1968), Jerome J. McGann notes an entry from Byron's "Detached Thoughts" (cited above) that suggests Berkeley, but concludes that the poet "ridicules Berkeley's pure idealism (D] xI, Iff.) and asserts at every opportunity that corporeality is not a means to something else but is its own end" (pp. 293-294). Anne Mellor, in her English Romantic Irony (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1980) sides with McGann, saying that the narrator of Don Juan "attack[s] Bishop Berkeley's egotistical attempt to reduce the world to pure spirit" (p. 44).</page><page sequence="8">66 Keats-Shelley Journal of the preposition "towards" links knowledge and vision and anticipates Berkeley's proof of the impossibility of seeing distance. The epistemol- ogy of seeing plus his critique of Lockean abstractions are the two main sources of his language theory. Berkeley's first task in the Essay is to show how vision and touch are heterogeneous senses that produce entirely different sets of ideas. To begin, "idea" for Berkeley signifies any sense impression; or, prior sense impressions-thoughts-held by the imagination."17 Berkeley re- tains the notion of reflection but, in a significant departure from Locke, he does away with ideas produced by reflection whereby a self-divided mind watches itself perceive and then categorizes these perceptions.18 Berkeley focuses upon Lockean ideas of reflection as the fallacious term in the proof of external space. Berkeley's early notebook version reads: "The Distinguishing betwixt an Idea and perception of the Idea has been one great cause of Imagining material substances" (Works, I, 75, #609). To this must be added a further qualification: "The Supposition that things are distinct from Ideas takes away all real truth" (Works, I, 75, #606). Berkeley says simply that we do not distinguish between percep- tion and idea. Ideas are the objects of perception instead of material objects out there. For Berkeley the sensationalist, sensation is synony- mous with idea. Our perception of"externality," therefore, occurs in the mind. Things, the minutiae of perception, stuff, what have you, all occur in the mind without the mediation of distance.19 Ideas as nearly un- mediated things constitute the "reality" of our world; the universe it would seem is "all ourselves" (Don Juan, Ix. 1I). To resume the Theory of Vision: Berkeley's separation of visual and tactile ideas enables him to explain how one is the function of the other. Tactile perceptions in fact mediate the visual. We do not see objects 17. See, for example, Berkeley's Philosophical Commentaries in Works, I, 39, #318 "All Ideas come from without, they are all particular"; and I, 45, #378 "All Ideas come from without or within." Hereafter, this work will be cited in the text as PC. 18. Chief among Berkeley's exceptions to Locke is the "Metaphorical Dress" given to "Opera- tions of the Mind." PC, I, 24, #176a. 19. See for example, The Principles of Human Knowledge, in Works, n, 55, S. 35: "I do not argue against the existence of any one thing that we can apprehend, either by sense or reflexion. That the things I see with mine eyes and touch with my hands do exist, really exist, I make not the least question."</page><page sequence="9">Berkeley and Byron 67 outside of us, says Berkeley, so much as we feel them on the retina. The impressions of distance we have are not visual but, ultimately, tactile.20 If we do not "see" distance, then objects of sight are something altogether different. "Visible figures," to quote Berkeley, "are the marks of tangible figures . . . " (Vision, I, 228, S. I40, my emphasis). External space collapses, as it were, and vision becomes a mental act signifying the tactile. In this way, the basis of Berkeley's epistemology is a system of signs, explained in linguistic terms. Visual figures or "things" are signs that function analogously to words. Berkeley elaborates this system by stipulating two orders of signs: those "artificial, arbitrary," man-made signs or words; and secondly, those natural signs that together constitute "the voice of the Author of nature, which speaks to our eyes, [and which] is not liable to that misin- terpretation and ambiguity that languages of human contrivance are unavoidably subject to" (Vision, I, 233, S. 152). To quote Berkeley's important definition in full: A great number of arbitrary signs, various and apposite, do constitute a language. If such arbitrary connexion be instituted by men, it is an artificial language; if by the Author of nature, it is a natural language. Infinitely various are the modifications of light and sound, whence they are each capable of supplying an endless variety of signs, and, accord- ingly, have been each employed to form languages; the one by the arbi- trary appointment of mankind, the other by that of God Himself.21 The topos of nature as a divine language created by God to communicate with man is familiar to English literature since the Renaissance.22 The consequences of Berkeley's variation for Romantic poetry, however, are startling and figure significantly in Byron, who images language in an ideal, pre-intellectual fashion.23 20. For the point of "feeling" distance, see Hepworth's Rise of Romanticism, pp. 62-64. 2 I. This quotation is not from the 1709 edition of the Theory of Vision, but from The Theory of Vision of Visual Language shewing the immediate Presence and Providence of a Deity Vindicated and Explained (1733: Works, I, 264, S. 40. 22. See James C. McKusick's alternate discussion of Berkeley in his Coleridge's Philosophy of Language (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1986), especially pp. 26-32. 23. See for example, Canto n of Don Juan which images the natural unspoken language of Juan and Haidee: "though their speech / Was broken words, they thought a language there, -" (ii. I 507-8, Byron's emphasis).</page><page sequence="10">68 Keats-Shelley Journal A consideration of this epistemology raises two interesting implica- tions regarding the cognitive structures a mind relies upon when con- fronted by a welter of sense impressions. In the first instance, how does the mind organize its perceptions in the absence of spatial hierarchies offered by distance?24 The convenient concepts of "up" and "down," essential to political ("the rise of") and lately literary discourse, no longer give form to the association of ideas. Each idea becomes a particular independent event in the mind; and one idea does not imply another except by the "arbitrary" connection of fortuitous experience.25 As Ber- keley comments, "the Understanding [is] not distinct from particular perceptions or ideas" (PC, I, 76, #614). Without the organizing concept of space, the mind is a continuum of independent particulars each of equal significance and meaning to the other. In the second instance, by doing away with the Lockean ideas of reflection, the concepts of sequence and causality in Berkeley's process of cognition are diminished. Ideas are understood without delay and without the causal links reflection finds between ideas, or the sequencing concepts of "before" and "after" essen- tial to the sequence, say, of credit capitalism.26 In this scheme ideas are signs for other ideas in a process of signification without causality. 27 This ambiguity of space and the experience of time more as a "feeling"28 than an intellectual conclusion are strong characteristics of the eighteenth- century lyric (in Thomson, Young, Gray, or Collins), Coleridge's Con- 24. See Hepworth, Rise of Romanticism, p. 62: "Among the conclusions a reader of Berkeley might be drawn to is the doubtfulness of the relation between an external world and the images of thinking, and of the existence of space as a structural idea of greater importance than other ideas." 25. For Berkeley's associationism, see Theory of Vision, I, 184-185, S. 39. 26. Contrary to Berkeley, an "idea" for Locke signifies any conscious awareness, be it an awareness of sense or the mind's awareness of itself. This separation of ideas is a crucial difference because it organizes two classes of words, the first being a word that signifies a particular sense impression; and the second an abstraction that permits philosophers to talk about the operations of the mind, reflection being one such operation. For an analysis of Sterne's parody of Locke, see Peter M. Briggs, "Locke's Essay and the Tentativeness of Tristram Shandy," in Studies in Philology, 82(1985), 493-52o. 27. See Principles of Human Knowledge, Works, nI, 69, S. 65: "To all which my answer is, first, that the connexion of ideas does not imply the relation of cause and effect, but only of a mark or sign with the thing signified. The fire which I see is not the cause of the pain I suffer upon my approaching it, but the mark that forewarns me of it." Berkeley's emphasis. 28.

Freed from time and space as the bases of cognition, it is the play of the imagination which finds the connections between sense im- pressions. In this way the imagination becomes creative: it provides what I call the "non-sequential" links between independent sense perceptions and thereby gives its own form to Nature. From this perspective, one's "progress" through Don Juan is heuristic; knowledge of a perceived object is apparently created at the moment of sensation and not after the sequential steps of rational deduction. There is another consequence besides the particular idea understood without the assistance of spatial or temporal hierarchies, an exclusively semiotic consequence. We have seen how Berkeley has two orders of sign systems: human language and the visual language of the Creator. Taken together, they form a semiotics wherein a particular word does not refer to an arbitrary signified so much as it refers to a natural sign of the second "divine" order. Accordingly, man's imaginative linguistic experience recapitulates in some small though sublime way the creation ex nihilo of God: "the infinite I AM" in Coleridge's famous definition of the primary imagination.29 Every linguistic utterance becomes eminently poetical because, as a particular sign it is equally capable of implying, perhaps revealing, the workings of God's imagination. In this system signs refer "indifferently"30 to signs in a continuum of the creative imag- ination without a "transcendental signified," unless we include God who, in Berkeley's theism, perceives all that we cannot.31 "Falling like dew 29. PC, I, 99, #830: "Why may we not conceive it possible for God to create things out of Nothing. certainly we our selves create in some wise whenever we imagine." Compare this with Coleridge's definition: "The imagination then I consider either as primary, or secondary.

Berkeley uses "indifferently" to explain how a particular sign, in this case a "line" used in a demonstration of geometry, refers not to an abstract signification but to a "general" sign. In this way, a particular may refer indifferently to another sign. 31.

As the digressive allusion to Macbeth (Banquo's murder) carries forth, the edenic Haidee and her "sinless child of sin" (iv. 5 5 5) yet in the womb are dead; beneath the lee ofJuan's vessel lie the shores of Ilion. Life is surely "full of strange vicissitudes" (iv.40oi) for Juan as the swirl of events transports him to the shadow of Achilles' tomb. But the poem's narrator (and historical Byron in this case) has beaten him to it, and in stanza 77 we witness the scene off Cape Sigeum with a serenity that belies its bar- baric history. High barrows, without marble, or a name, A vast, untill'd, and mountain-skirted plain, And Ida in the distance, still the same, And old Scamander, (if 'tis he) remain; The situation seems still form'd for fame- A hundred thousand men might fight again With ease; but where I sought for Ilion's walls, The quiet sheep feeds, and the tortoise crawls. (Iv. 6o9-616) With considerable success, the stanza juxtaposes an epic locale and a lyric perception. The two, interestingly, are not mutually exclusive 32. In the introductory note to "The Thorn," Wordsworth describes the beauties of the Oriental prophetic technique of parallelism: "There are also various other reasons why repetition and apparent tautology are frequently beauties of the highest kind. Among the chief of these reasons is the interest the mind attaches to words, not only as symbols of the passion, but as things, active and efficient, which are themselves part of the passion" (Poetical Works, n, 513; Wordsworth's emphasis). In a letter to William Godwin regarding the theories of Horne Tooke, 22 September I800, Coleridge writes: "I wish you to write a book on the power of words, and the processes by which human feelings form affinities with them-... Are not words &amp;c parts &amp; germinations of the Plant? And what is the Law of their Growth?--In something of this order I would endeavor to destroy the old antithesis of Words &amp; Things, elevating, as it were, words into Things, &amp; living Things too."

In Berkeley, it is possible for a word to evoke a passion without an "intervening idea."

"My poem's epic," the narrator has already boasted; saying and doing, however, are very different categories of experience. In this scene the persona is confronted by the geographical and emotional locus of his art and compelled to reconcile language and action. The expectation is epic-Byron was certainly the grandest of tourists--to a degree sufficient to withstand the irreverent prosody of Protesilaus / slay us (Iv, 607, 608). The type of seeing that organizes the stanza, however, is not epic and the conjuction "but" in the stanza's final couplet links the two modes in an ironic equipoise. What the narrator's heart would have him believe is unverifiable by the senses. Belief, Hume speculates, is the most vivacious of impressions; and Byron performs a striking variation of Pope's famous line from the Dunciad, "All Classic learning lost on Classic ground."34 The success of the stanza resides in its rhetorical indirection: we learn more about "epic" by virtue of discrepancy. The images "quiet sheep feeds" and "tortoise crawls" lead us to a better understanding of Achilles, much as "green-rob'd senators" communicates indirectly Saturn's fall. The narrator's highly accomplished evocation of Ilion is another type of digression. Juan is at the seat of Western culture, but as an agent of perception he is very distant-below-deck-and not surprisingly subor- dinate, momentarily forgotten. Nevertheless, Juan's imprisonment frees the narrator from the exigencies of plot into the excess of digression. The scene's iconography is highly particularized with topographical fidelity and Homeric adjective. The stanza's opening line describes an Ozyman- dian tumulus. Its anonymity raises the very process of signification. Is it Achilles' resting place, the birthplace of epic poetry? "Without a marble or a name," Byron cleverly lets the scene work into his, and the reader's contemporary imagination.35 The persona's repetitive musing becomes ambiguous temporally as continuity through time--"still the same"-- admits the connotation of static tableaux- "Still form'd for fame." The powerful suggestion of the scene leads the narrator into an innocent contradiction where thousands "might fight again / With ease." Here, 34. The Poems of Alexander Pope, ed.

By virtue of their divergence, the "low" image affirms the "high" epic. To be is to perceive, writes Berkeley, and in this case the epic thrives in the midst of uncertainty. Like Keats, Byron dissolves space as a structure of knowing. The first image "High barrows" gives way to its opposite in the course of seven lines, reducing simultaneously notions of the Longinian sublime.36 Liter- ature, tradition, history are abstracts implied in this stanza, as Byron pits fact and belief, seeing and feeling, and antiquity against a "sheep" and a "tortoise." The image of time, too, as a hierarchical principle of organi- zation is dissolved. The neo-classical poetry of Pope depends upon the image of time as a linear (and spatial) construct stretching back in the case of the Pastorals (1709) to Virgil and Theocritus. Pope's wit enables him firstly to see (to know) time and the literary tradition at a glance, and secondly to arrange artfully images of temporal import such as the pas- toral bowl. Very nearly in a single stanza, Byron dismantles the eigh- teenth-century aesthetic of allusion as exemplified in the poetry of Pope. By forcing his contemporary persona on the stanza, Byron questions the temporal associations of his culture at large. His poem moves forward dilatorily according to a grand remaking of the hierarchy of past time. Concepts of sequence so essential to the image of time in the epic genre disappear into the wonderfully tactile particular of "tortoise." The treat- ment of time as an image of space across a vast tradition of western civilization beginning in Greece disappears into the moment, intuitively understood without prior reference. Words as things, or objects of per- ception in this case, cancel aboutness: they do not refer to abstracts of plot or poetry beyond themselves but rather refer, as in Berkeley's sys- tem, "indifferently" to other equally meaningful signs in a continuum of the imagination. Finally, words are a vehicle for the concept of subjectiv- 36. The foremost biblical orientalist of the eighteenth century, Bishop Robert Lowth, offers the technique of the grand thought described in lowly terms as one of "Sublimity of Sentiment," the title of his Lecture 16. Lowth takes his example from Psalm 78.65-66: And the Lord awaked, as out of sleep Like a strong man shouting because of wine. (Robert Lowth, Lectures on the Sacred Poetry of the Hebrews, tr. G. Gregory [New York: Garland, 1971], I, 363.)</page><page sequence="15">Berkeley and Byron 73 ity with which I began the discussion of Berkeley and which is sum- marized by Byron himself in Childe Harold's Pilgrimage: 'Tis to create, and in creating live A being more intense, that we endow With form our fancy, gaining as we give The life we image, even as I do now. (III.46-49) For Byron and Berkeley words and things depend upon analogous sign systems; and, most importantly, words evoke feelings as immediate and powerful as those sensory impressions we register every day. Both Vol- taire and Herder theorized on the origins of language as being highly figurative, the outpouring of passionate feeling. Throughout Don Juan, the coincidence of word and thing strikes those "unquiet feelings, which first woke / Song in the world" (iv. 843-844). Through the agency of spatial dissolution Byron achieves a peculiar sequaciousness in Don Juan Iv, 77. The temporality of the lyric genre unsettles the expectations aroused by the epic setting. The effect is one of time as a sensation. The poetry of this stanza astonishes because images of the "low" compel an understanding of their generic opposite, the epic. In this way, the rhetoric is indirect: the lyric particular legitimizes the epic. Like our exmple of the "green-rob'd senators," Byron's poetry presents a cognition that depends less upon extension and linear sequence. As Juan departs his native Spain, for example, the narrator digresses upon the awkward sight of seeing "one's native land receding" (ii. 90). "Native land" here is Spain in the context ofJuan as well as Great Britain in the context of Byron: I recollect Great Britain's coast looks white, But almost every other country's blue, When gazing on them, mystified by distance, We enter on our nautical existence. (II.93-96) The pun on see / receding by our seafaring narrator enriches the ambiguity of "mystified by distance." Distance is not simply a concept of space. It becomes an analogue for perception in the midst of high emotion. But distance in this case is also a mystery in temporal terms as Byron sum- mons into play his own anachronistic historical presence. Like Juan,</page><page sequence="16">74 Keats-Shelley Journal sexual transgression forced Byron from his native land. Unlike Juan, Byron's unrepentance made him a traitor to a hypocritical standard. And so a seemingly innocent or comic digression frames a re-cognition of morality beyond the temporal or spatial sequence ofJuan's story. On deck, Juan watches "the town bec[o]me a speck" (II.99), and he "Be- h[o]ld[s] his native Spain receding far" (II. I06). AsJuan looks (and thinks) backward from the stern of the forward-moving ship, the narrator offers a final image of leave-taking in general: "At leaving even the most un- pleasant people / And places, one keeps looking at the steeple" (ii. I 1i1- I 12). The icon of the steeple, the first and last image in the sequence of landings and partings, offers the implications of distance for human con- duct. By examining how little distance there is separating Byron's past from his poetry, he compels us to see the humorous discrepancies be- tween morality and reality and urges us against the compartmentalization of emotion in terms of event: forced leave-takings are painful and comic. The overlay of biographical fact upon fiction implies the distance each of us uses to hide from or come to terms with the past. Moreover, Byron's play with notions of distance demonstrates how the concept of character is nested in his poetry. What begins as a maudlin event forJuan becomes a powerful recollection for Byron and vicariously for readers in terms of their own experience. Leaving home in fact or fiction, appar- ently, is never what it seems to be. Byron is not alone in the attention he pays to the peculiar sequence of ideas in his poetry. Blake satirizes the empirical notion of"outness" with his exaggerated use of prepositions in The First Book of Urizen. De Quin- cey's narcoses organize prose sequences of dream-like association. More to the point is Book ix of The Prelude in which Wordsworth addresses his interlocutor, Coleridge, in the terms of an epic simile. Wordsworth's image for his poem is a river whose every motion forward to the sea somehow recapitulates its source. Book Ix is the first of three that treat the French Revolution, and Wordworth prefaces the poetry of political revolution with a punning trope on narrative sequence: "so have we, my Friend! / Turned and returned with intricate delay (1 850: 7-8). Properly to understand a cultural revolution, Wordsworth seems to say, we must have a poem whose loci of perception are revolutions as well, but revo-</page><page sequence="17">Berkeley and Byron 75 lutions of delay. 37 Via Berkeley, then, words become agents of perception for first- and second-generation Romantics.38 By reimagining the eye into an ignorance of distance, poetic form becomes attenuated and digres- sion a mode of progress, even knowledge.39 Like Hamlet's Polonius, Byron by indirection finds direction out. Universit6 de Moncton, Nouveau-Brunswick 37. Not surprisingly, Coleridge too uses the flux and reflux of water to image the actions of a perceiving, creating mind. His analogy of the water-beetle demonstrates how the iconography of the mind has changed from a linear configuration to one that acknowledges discontinuity, indirec- tion, and alternating sequence. "Now let a man watch his mind while he is composing; or, to take a still more common case, while he is trying to recollect a name; and he will find the process completely analogous. Most of my readers will have observed a small water-insect on the surface of rivulets which throws a cinque-spotted shadow fringed with prismatic colours on the sunny bottom of the brook; and will have noticed how the little animal wins its way up against the stream, by alternate pulses of active and passive motion, now resisting the current, and now yielding to it in order to gather strength and a momentary fulcrum for a further propulsion. This is no unapt emblem of the mind's self-experience in the act of thinking" (Biographia Literaria, I, 8 5-86).
