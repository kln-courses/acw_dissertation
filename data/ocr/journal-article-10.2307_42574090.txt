<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANTI-ANTI-ISMISM MARGARET BENNETTÂ« During entertain the myself worst tie-ups by reading on the the Los bumper Angeles strips freeways, of the I entertain myself by reading the bumper strips of the cars packed around me. Though the pre-election fare can be rich and witty, my all-time favorite bumper strip will always be "The Only 'Ism' For Me is Americanism." * Margaret Bennett is the collaborative pseudonym of June Bier- mann and Barbara Toohey, librarians at Los Angeles Valley College, Van Nuys, California. 56</page><page sequence="2">MARCH 1965 DISCUSSION Since first I saw this phrase three years ago on a dark blue sedan in South Pasadena, I have been trying to puzzle out its meaning. At first I put it in the category of a generalized exorcism, such as " Jesus Saves." These car owners, I thought, were merely using this aphorism to state their opposition to the flagrant evils of our time: communism, alcoholism, mom- ism, bowdlerism, transvestitism, and nepotism. But the longer I sit on freeways, the more isms I think of, and the less confidence I have in my first interpretation. I am becoming hopelessly confused as to just what kind of people belong to this anti-ismism movement. They can't be church- goers because they're against all organized religions. They obviously want nothing to do with Catholicism, Protestantism, Judaism, Zen Buddhism, or Mohammedanism. On the other hand, you can't accuse them of espousing paganism, Darwin- ism, agnosticism, or atheism, either. Evidentally, these people aren't philosophers. They reject everything from Platonism to existentialism. (I shouldn't be surprised, however, if they occasionally made use of the false syllogism.) They must be in league against the arts, too. How could poets survive without lyricism, painters without impressionism or surrealism, writers of historical novels without the anachro- nism and a generous helping of plagiarism and eroticism? I've bitter decided lot whose that exhausts the "only send ism out for twice me-ers" as much are a smog very bitter lot whose exhausts send out twice as much smog as anyone else's. It's clear that they're courting ostracism by those of us with even a smattering of optimism and humanism. Think what the world would be like if they had their way! For one thing, they'd put all our compasses on the blink by discarding magnetism. Then, they would quickly blot out the free press by banning journalism. They would undermine our physical well-being by denying the basal metabolism and destroy our mental health by eliminating our every defense mechanism. Under their rule of ism-nihilism we would even be deprived of the brightening effect of an occasional witticism. Maybe these people haven't stopped to consider where 57</page><page sequence="3">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL. XXII, NO. 1 television would be without pugilism, optometry without astigmatism, Billy Graham without baptism, Walt Disney without anthropomorphism, and the spelling bee without antidisestablishmentarianism. Although I am encouraged that these Americans are making a stand against chauvinism and fanaticism, it saddens me that they are advocating a nation without heroism, indi- vidualism, or idealism. But wait a minute. According to the anti-ismists, con- servatism, capitalism, and patriotism are not for them. Maybe these people ought to be investigated. Or, at least, to use a euphemism, we should regard with scepticism the legitimism of those who bear this bumper strip sophism. 58</page></plain_text>
