<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CAVE OF PUY-DE-LACAN: A MAGDALENIAN SITE IN SOUTH-CENTRAL FRANCE By LILIA AND HOMER H. KIDDER O N the slope of a wooded ridge overlooking the valley of the Correze nearB1rive, the Cave of Puy-de-Lacan opens to the south in a ledge of Triassic sandstone nearly 100 feet above the river at a distance of 273 yards from the right bank. A natural pillar divides the entrance into two arches. The interior, supplied with water that seeps through the coarse rock, measures thirty-two feet in width by forty-two in depth, including a low cavity at the inner extremity. From a rock-terrace in front, a sandy talus drops at an average angle of 150 to the foot of the hill. This is the only site in the region of Brive that is known to have been occupied by folk of Magdalenian culture. The case is surprising for a locality counting many Solutrean and Aurignacian sites, the more so as some forty miles down stream beyond the point where the Correze flows into the Vezere, the neighborhood of Les Eyzies was, in Magdalenian times, as throughout the Upper Palaeolithic, the most frequented center of human life known in the prehistoric world. It may well be that with the advance of ice to within fifty miles northeast of the location of Brive in the re- crudescence of intense cold that prevailed during the Biihl glaciation, most of the inhabitants, following perhaps a movement of game to the southwest and west, abandoned the Correze for the lower valleys of Pdri- gord, where, in fact, as along the Dordogne, the Isle, and the Charente, Magdalenian sites are considerably more numerous than those of preceding epochs.1 Whatever the cause of its isolation, Lacan was on the fore-front of man's range in the direction of the ice-covered highlands of central France. No Palaeolithic site has been found farther up the valley or in Upper Correze stretching northeastward across the bleak Plateau des Mille Vaches towards the Monts d'Auvergne. The site was discovered and named some seventy years ago by two pioneer prehistorians of the Corrize, Elie Massenat and Philibert Lalande, who, digging through a meter of sand on the talus, found a bed of Mag- dalenian culture. Lalande published an interesting account of their work.2 About the year 1900, when a sand pit was opened at the foot of the slope, the shovel men collected on their screens some 700 flaked flints which they turned over to Abbes L. Bardon and A. and J. Bouyssonie, then beginning 1 The last statement is based on an unpublished list indicating the location of prehistoric sites in P6rigord by M D.

Today a new exploitation of the sand pit, which is stripping the talus to the rock, has exposed further archae- ological deposits, these being closely observed by two competent prehis- torians, Abb6s L. Lejeune and J. Bouyssonie, aided by M J.-F. Pe!rol. They have reported a Solutrean bed at the foot of the hill and above it an im- portant Magdalenian deposit which runs up the talus towards the levels dug by us.4 When the relation of these deposits to ours has been estab- lished, MM Lejeune and Bouyssonie propose that we collaborate with them and with M Perol in an article on the site as a whole. The rest of the FIG. 1. Cross section of the Cave of Puy-de-Lacan (Correze), showing the site at the head of the talus. present communication is therefore concerned only with our own work at Lacan. For the same reason, Figure 1 shows, in cross section, only the archaeological beds dug by us at the top of the talus. We first visited the cave, then concealed by woods, in the course of a walk in June, 1929. Poking with a stick in the sand in the interior, one of us unearthed a couple of flaked flints, a small saw-toothed blade, and a borer (fig. 3, nos. 1 and 2). This find led to the reopening of the site. 3 Two papers by these authors that contain passages on Lacan are (1) "De la Succession des Niveaux Archeologiques dans les Stations Pr6historiques des Environs de Brive" (Compte Rendu du Congres Prehistorique de France, Perigueux, 1905); (2) "Sur les Stations Pr6- historiques des Environs de Brive" (Compte Rendu du Congres Pr6historique de France, Angouleme, 1912). 4 Abb6s J.

We wish again to express our thankfulness to these gentlemen. Having dug to bed rock in the cave without striking an expected ar- chaeological deposit, although we found a good many flaked flints, we ran our trench on to the talus and twenty-five meters down the slope. The cross-section (fig. 1) shows three archaeological beds there brought to light: A, B, C, as designated from the bottom upwards. They abutted against a low cliff in front of the entrance, beneath a layer of sand, D, which ex- tended down the talus from inside the cave. At eighteen to twenty meters from the rock, A, B, and C gradually merged with the sand of the talus and were no longer distinguishable. Maximum thickness: A, 45 mm.; B, 54 mm.; C, 65 mm.; D, 1 m. 15 mm. These four beds we excavated systematically in the summer of 1929, one layer at a time, working uphill. The debris was shovelled down the slope to right and left of an oak which we hoped to spare, near the foot of our digging, but which died when the moisture had drained from the block of earth in which it was rooted. Near the rock, a hearth or oven (X in fig. 1), lined with blackened river stones sunk in the sand beneath our bottom layer, contained disintegrated charcoal and a granite lamp whose underside had been fashioned into broad facets, apparently by rubbing or grinding. Rapid decay of organic matter in the sandy soil of our archaeological beds had resulted in total disappearance of the admirable artifacts of bone, antler, and ivory (tools, weapons, engravings, and sculptured forms) such as at sites in calcareous soil, like that of Dordogne, serve as a means of distinguishing between the different epochs of the Upper Palaeolithic and also between the different levels of those epochs. Of the remains of fauna, too, we consequently found almost nothing-a few fragmentary molars of horse and bison. The culture brought to light was, however, recognizable as Magdalenian by the evolved style of the animal engravings on stone, here- with reproduced, and by the presence of flint implements of certain types peculiar to that horizon. The most characteristic of these are the short, flat scraper, with abrupt, retouched edges, called raclette (fig. 4, nos. 3, 4); the dentate blade, with or without retouched margin (fig. 3, no. 1; fig. 4, no. 1) and the parrot beak graver, of which we found only one, an un- developed specimen.6 The other types of the Magdalenian flint industry 5 A drawing of a good specimen of the parrot beak graver may be seen on p. 192, Vol. 1, of Dr G.

KIDDER] THE CAVE OF PUY-DE-LACAN 445 escape the impression that the artisans of Lacan were heirs of the Aurigna- cian tradition of flint work, although they no longer produced certain tools characteristic of the typical Aurignacian, such as the so-called "busked" graver with a notch, the "strangled" blade, and the true Tart6 scraper. With a few exceptions, flake tools of the Upper Paleolithic are smooth and unretouched on one face, the same being the inner face as fractured from the core, with a bulb of percussion often showing near the end where struck with a hammer stone (percuteur); while the other or outer face usually shows one or more longitudinal ridges produced by primary flaking before removal from the core (fig. 4, no. 12).

This implement, long supposed to have served especially for engraving, was also and no doubt chiefly employed for working bone and probably wood. The essential feature of the graver is a short, robust cutting edge made across the thickness of the flake at one of the extremities or angles. Gravers may be grouped in three general categories, of which char- acteristic forms are illustrated in our drawings as follows (mentioned here in order of their frequency at Lacan): I, the spalled graver (burin bec-de- flute), Fig. 3, Nos. 4, 5 (upper end, angle at left), and 6 (lower end); II, the scaled graver (burin ' troncature retouchee), Fig. 3, Nos. 14 (upper end) and 18 (upper end), also Fig. 4, No. 5 (upper end); III, the fluted graver (carinate type, burin caring), Fig. 3, No. 11. These three general categories</page><page sequence="8">446 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 38, 1936 of gravers, as classified by Mr H. V. V. Noone, comprise in all sixteen different types found in the Upper Palaeolithic.6 The Magdalenians seem to have been the first to make general use of the graver for cutting elongated pieces from bone or antler for the produc- tion of harpoons, spear points, needles, etc., by working the short trans- verse edge back and forth in parallel grooves. The photograph (fig. 2, lower) shows the process uncompleted on a piece of reindeer antler unearthed in Magdalenian III at Laugetrie Haute, Dordogne.7 At Lacan, gravers run to 35.8 percent of the flint industry, without counting the chips, and to 52 percent of the total number of tools, without counting burin spalls, tablets, flakes with crimped ridge, etc. In 1930, we dug three remaining portions of the deposit (one about the dead oak, two along the sides) which we had intended to leave as "wit- nesses" (te-moins) of the stratigraphy, but which had already begun to give way under the rains of the preceding winter, so that we saw they would not endure. Finally, we emptied the cave of sand varying in depth up to a little over a meter. On the rock floor within, thus exposed, we found to our surprise un- questionable traces of metal work, where apparently quarry men had tried the quality of the sandstone and had grooved channels to drain off seepage water. There could be no doubt that the ground in the cave had been turned over to the bottom. Both in the cave, however, and also outside, in the same bed, D, extending on to the talus, we found numerous Magdalenian flint implements mixed with others of Mesolithic character and with pot- sherds of historic age, Gallo-Roman and Merovingian. Two inferences seemed clear: that a Magdalenian deposit formerly existing in the cave had been partly but never entirely emptied on to the talus, and that this bed, D, had, strictly speaking, no stratigraphic significance. In other words, the 6 A standard French work on gravers is Captain M. Bourlon's "Essai de Classification des Burins" (Revue de l'Ecole d'Anthropologie, No. 7, Paris, 1911). An even more com- prehensive study is H. V. V. Noone's "Classification of Burins or Gravers" (Journal, Royal Anthropological Institute, Vol. 64, Jan.-June, 1934). Mr Noone's essay has also appeared in French, in Compte Rendu du Congres Pr6historique de France (P6rigueux, 1934). We have borrowed the English terms "spalled" and "scaled" from Noone, the French terms from Bourlon and from Bardon and Bouyssonie. 7 By Miss Barbara Kidder, who has kindly allowed us to reproduce the picture. To obtain elongated pieces for making tools and arms, the Aurignacians and Solutreans split bones, apparently with flint wedges. Two instances have, however, been recorded where Aurignacians (Perigordians) used the graver to remove longitudinal cuttings from reindeer antler by making parallel grooves. Each case was that of a single specimen, one observed by Denis Peyrony in the top layer, Upper Aurignacian (P6rigordien V) at La Ferrassie; the other by his son, Elie Peyrony, in the same level at La Forgt, both in Dordogne.</page><page sequence="9">L. AND H. KIDDER] THE CAVE OF PUY-DE-LACAN 447 age of objects found in this layer could be determined only by comparison with types of known age. The underlying beds, C, B, and A, were undoubtedly in place. Notwith- standing the mobility of their sandy composition on a talus washed by rain and by water from the cave, these three layers had retained a stratigraphic character that appeared in the homogeneous nature of their archaeological contents and in progressive changes, from level to level, in the dimensions, relative frequency, and to some extent in the form of certain flint imple- ments-changes that run more or less regularly through A, B, and C, but are usually arrested in D.

Similarly, the percentage of double end scrapers (fig. 4, nos. 9, 10; characteristic rather of the Aurignacian) diminished rapidly: A, 13.3; B, 8.8; C, 4; while that of end scrapers associated with gravers (fig. 3, nos. 5, 6, 14; fig. 4, no. 5; a favorite combination in Magdalenian times) kept augmenting: A, 23.3; B, 39; C, 43.9. Not to multiply instances, the foregoing may suffice to illustrate the stratigraphic individuality of the three lower beds and the continuity of cultural changes that developed during their formation.</page><page sequence="10">448 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 38, 1936 Similar phenomena, which could be expressed by curves, may be traced in the percentage of most of the items in Table 2.

Unearthed just below the surface of layer C, near the rock and not far from each other, they were possibly by the same hand but are evidently of the same school, that of the great period of Magdalenian art. Abb6 Breuil attributes them to Magdalenian V-VI. In contrast to the mastery shown in these drawings is the immaturity of a horse's head carved in relief on a small block of sandstone picked up in .earth that had fallen from the side of our exploring trench. It is in the characteristic primitive style of sculptured horses' heads from Magdalenian III-IV, found in the Valley of the V6zere by M Peyrony and others and at Isturitz by Count de Saint-P6rier, who considers the profile on our block to be of approximately the same age. Though not found in place, it would seem to have come from our lowest bed, A. Its presence at Lacan, in rela- tion to the developed technique of the two engravings, is of interest as apparently bearing out the supposition that in the region of Brive Mag- dalenian art evolved along lines analogous to those already known in P6rigord and in the French and Spanish Pyrenees. Apart from engravings unquestionably Palaeolithic, one of us (L.K.) unearthed some fifty stones and a potsherd bearing incised signs different</page><page sequence="11">L. AND H. KIDDER] THE CAVE OF PUY-DE-LACAN 449 from anything previously signalized in the country. Among them are char- acters or letters, some of these forming apparently lineal inscriptions; two stones are engraved with conventionalized human visages, others with cupules in various arrangements. The publication of the signs, illustrated by line drawings in the Revue Archeologique,8 gave rise to the expression of very different opinions regarding their age. They were variously ascribed to Glozelian culture in late Magdalenian or early Neolithic times,9 to Gallo- Roman magic (supposed according to this view to have been practised in the Cave of Lacan),'1 and to a survival in the Bronze Age or even later" of conventionalized anthropomorphic figures of Megalithic origin. As the age of these signs is a problem outside of the field of our own studies, we limited ourselves, in our article, to describing the specimens and the stratigraphic conditions in which each piece came to light. The impression has grown upon us, however, that one has here not the product of a single epoch but of each of the periods to which the signs have been attributed. Observers are agreed that there is no doubt of their authenticity. We found them apparently in place in all levels, the largest number being in D. The question to which of the six levels of the Magdalenian the three dug by us belong-a complex question, made none the simpler by the dis- appearance of bone artifacts, which characterize the different levels-will be taken up again when the work at the sand pit has brought to light the remaining vestiges of prehistoric deposits on the talus. Meantime, indica- tions observed in the course of our work may here be stated. The finding of raclettes (flat scrapers with abrupt edges, characteristic of the old Magdalenian) in our lowest bed, A, seems to show that the site was inhabited at that level before the introduction of the primitive bone har- poon in Magdalenian IV, and may possibly have been occupied even earlier than Magdalenian III. On the other hand, the presence of examples of fully evolved art in level C shows that Lacan was inhabited up to Magdalenian V-we should say also in VI were it not that the site has yielded us but one, under-developed specimen of the parrot beak graver, a type particularly characteristic of that level. With a good deal of doubt regarding occupation in VI, we should therefore place our three undisturbed levels as approxi- mately contemporaneous with two well known Magdalenian sites in 8 L. and H. H.
