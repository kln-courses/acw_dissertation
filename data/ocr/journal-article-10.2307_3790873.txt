<plain_text><page sequence="1">Political Psychology, Vol. 4, No. 3, 1983 The Forum Nuclear Arms and the Desire for World Destruction Steven Kull' Our present trend toward a nuclear holocaust may have its roots in an un- conscious attraction to world destruction. More common explanations for war, based on rational self-interest or survival instincts, are not adequate to explain the potential for nuclear annihilation. The desire for world destruc- tion is presented as being derived from the desires for individual self- destruction, for aggressive destruction, for mutual death, and for war itself. Images for world-destructive deities are examined as projections of this desire. It is argued that the attraction to destruction is not most fundamen- tally an attraction to biological death but, rather, to a symbolic or ar- chetypal process of death and rebirth. This process can be seen in the primitive rituals of world destruction and regeneration which may have been, in the Neolithic period, the precursors of the first wars. Attitudes toward war and nuclear arms are examined as fundamentally archetypal processes expressed in the literal dimension. KEY WORDS: nuclear weapons; nuclear war; self-destruction; world destruction; war; rituals. INTRODUCTION Since the threat of nuclear war impinges on every human life, it is only natural that we should grope for some explanation in rational terms of how we have reached this critical predicament. Rational explanations, however, may not be adequate. One sees humanity actively preparing for a war. All sides insists they do not want such a war. Yet, all sides feel it is very possible that such a war will happen. Although it is widely acknowledged that there would be no winners in such a war, and probably not even any survivors, 'Peace and Common Security, 2520 Milvia St., Berkeley, California 94704. 563 0162-895X/83/0900-0563$03.00/1 @ 1983 International Society of Political Psychology</page><page sequence="2">564 Kull the preparation for it continues unabated. The "reason" for such behavior is protection of one's own group, even if it means destroying it in the process. The irrational nature of such behavior has certainly been recognized. Some conclude that there is simply a widespread stupidity operating as if people do not really see what they are doing. Others observe the behavior with a certain fatalism, almost as if humanity as a whole is in the grip of some mysterious, impersonal force leading us to destruction against our will. This force may, however, be all too human, and rather than being simply stupid, we may actually be very effectively, though unconsciously, following an actual desire for world destruction. It is certainly more appealing to explain human behavior in terms of more overt and rational motivations, rather than in terms of mysterious, unconscious motivations that contradict the conscious wish to live. However, in the face of the self-destructive implications of nuclear war, more "obvious" explanations no longer make sense. The most popular explanation of the motive for war has been greed or rational self-interest. This notion has always been very questionable. Numerous studies have demonstrated, e.g., Hobbs (1979), that war is not economically beneficial even for the victor. The rewards of victory are generally outweighed by the costs. Furthermore, the ostensible reasons for war are rarely economic (Richardson, 1950). In any case, the destructive potential of nuclear war makes the economic motive for war sound almost ludicrous. Another popular explanation for warlike behavior rests on the idea that it represents a regression to a more primitive, animal-like state. This is consistent with the age-old deriding of our "animal nature" and a number of popular books based on Lorenz's (1966) comparison of animal and human aggression. However, a key fact shows such explanations to be highly inade- quate. There is no parallel to war in animal behavior. Animals very rarely kill members of their own species. Intraspecific killing in general and war in particular are human phenomena.2 On the whole, it seems that animals are eminently rational. They not only do not kill their own species, they also do not die for abstract causes; nor do they kill themselves. If we define rationality as acting consistently with survival needs, then what is uniquely human is the capacity to act irra- tionally. In the context of the phenomena of evolution, the emergence of this capacity for irrational behavior is a rather awesome development. After billions of years of life forms' acting consistently with the survival principle, 2Even Lorenz has more recently stated that his observations of individual animal aggression are not necessarily applicable parallels to collective human behavior (Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1979).</page><page sequence="3">Desire for World Destruction 565 suddenly a new form emerges that manifests the new behaviors of in- traspecific killing and suicide. And, contrary to the popular notion that humans have become less violent with "civilization," the strongest thrust of anthropological research indicates that humans have become even more violent with civilization. Rather than seeing violence as a regression to an earlier, instinctual mode, I think we must see it as a by-product of a developmental process in which newly emerging human motivations have become so powerful that they have gained the capacity to override the age- old motives for survival. Most likely, there are numerous motivations and processes that con- tribute to the present collective trend toward world destruction. In this paper, we will focus on the attraction to world destruction, per se. We will begin by exploring several components-the individual desire for self-destruc- tion, the desire for aggressive destruction, the desire for war - as well as projec- tions of these desires onto the image of the deity and the world as a whole. Later in this paper, we will explore the attraction to death and destruc- tion as an attraction to symbolic or archetypal processes.3 These processes, exemplified by certain myths and rituals that have been found in nearly every culture, may actually be the root of human war in general, as well as the potential for nuclear war. However, it may be that these archetypal pro- cesses do not necessarily have to be acted out in the conduct of war as such and that, in fact, for much of human evolution they were not acted out in this way. In the final portion of this paper, we will examine the psychological dynamics that contribute to the tendency to literalize destruc- tive processes. We will discuss, as well, trends that may offer means for dealing with those processes in a less harmful manner. THE DESIRE FOR WORLD DESTRUCTION The Desire for Self-destruction Probably the most fundamental root of the desire for world destruc- tion is the individual attraction to self-destruction and death. This can be seen in the overt act of suicide and in the conscious attraction to death. Suicide is considerably more common than most people recognize. Ac- cording to the World Health Organization, approximately 1000 people commit suicide each day. In the United States, approximately 1.5% of all deaths are due to suicide. This is a fairly typical rate, and in some countries 3This is in contrast to Freud's concept of the "death instinct," which is necessarily a biological process.</page><page sequence="4">566 Kull is several times higher. Among college students, suicide is the second highest cause of death (auto accidents rank first). Furthermore, most experts say that these numbers significantly underestimate the actual number of suicide since the diagnosis of suicide as the cause of death is, for a variety of reasons, used only in cases where the evidence is unequivocal. Attempts at suicide are vastly more frequent. It is generally estimated there are eight to ten times as many suicide attempts as there are successful suicides. Besides the more overt suicidal acts, a wide range of self-destructive behavior has been characterized as "subintentional suicides." Deaths by auto accidents, and the cumulative effects of drugs, alcohol, or stressful life styles can, in many cases, be interpreted as the expression of some degree of self-destructive motivation. Another area of substantial self-destruction ap- pears in homicides where the victim was openly provocative -a substantial portion of all homicides. In present-day culture, we almost automatically associate suicide with pathology and depression. Numerous examples, however, make it abun- dantly clear that many acts of self-destruction have been entirely unrelated to pathology or depression. In ancient Greece and Alexandria, a number of philosophers extolled the virtues of suicide as the only meaningful response to the human condition. Individuals were known to commit suicide at the end of their lectures or at the climax of sumptuous feasts. In ancient Rome, many Christians actively sought out the opportunity to be martyred as a means of ensuring entrance into heaven. Later, the Christian church had to work actively to suppress the practice of intentional martyrdom. To counteract suicidal tendencies in general, the church went so far as to make suicide the worst possible sin, worse even than murder. Nevertheless, in the Middle Ages, a heretical sect, the Albigenses, practiced the endura (suicide by fasting) as the most direct means of attaining unity with God. In the "romantic" era of the last century, following the publication of Goethe's The Sorrow of Young Werther, suicide became "fashionable" and reached epidemic proportions. In the early Twentieth Century, the Dadaists argued for suicide as a sublime artistic act. This idea has also appeared more recent- ly in certain punk and "New Wave" art forms. However it is achieved, the image of death holds a fascination and is often presented as an attractive condition. Death itself may be presented as a beautiful, seductive woman, as in the recent film, All That Jazz, or it may be described as a blissful state, as in the selection from Walt Whitman's "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd": Come lovely and soothing death Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving In the day, in the night, to all, to each Sooner or later delicate death.</page><page sequence="5">Desire for World Destruction 567 Prais'd be the fathomless universe For life and joy, and for the objects and knowledge curious And for love, sweet love, but praise! praise! praise! For the sure-enwinding arms of cool enfolding death... Approach, strong deliveress, When it is so, when thou hast taken them, I joyously sing the dead, Lost in the loving floating ocean of thee, Laved in the flood of thy bliss O death. Even when the postdeath state is not described in such positive terms, death can still hold a definite attraction as a climactic fulfillment of one's life. Nearly every nation glorifies those who willingly sacrifice their lives and, no doubt, it is the attractiveness of this kind of death that motivates young men to join dangerous military endeavours. In the Japanese Samurai code, it is explicitly stated that the way of the Samurai is "nothing but a path to death" (Seward, 1968). The Desire for Mutual Death Another component of the desire for world destruction is the desire for mutual death. There seems to be a human attraction not only to destruc- tion of one's own experience, but also to a desire to achieve this destruction simultaneously with other individuals. War, in general, and nuclear war especially, may represent a relatively unconscious expression of this desire. However, there are numerous examples in which the attraction to this kind of death is consciously expressed and acted upon. The most famous type of mutual death is between two lovers. Roman- tic literature throughout the world has glorified the stories of lovers whose relationship climaxes in mutual suicide. Rougemont (1940), in his analysis of this phenomenon, argues that the fact that lovers are ostensibly responding to an external condition that is interfering with their relation- ship is not at all the relevant factor. It is not an accident that they have chosen an inaccessible lover, he maintains; rather, it is the attraction to the potential for this type of erotic death that binds the lovers so hopelessly together. The possibility of group suicide also evidently holds a certain appeal. The recent mass suicide in Jonestown is certainly the most vivid example in this century. Although this event was frequently referred to in the press as a "massacre," implying aggressors and victims, the evidence points away from this interpretation. The process took several hours and, by all accounts, the participants were highly cooperative and expressed positive emotions about the act. Furthermore, the mass suicide had been "practiced" several times before under the mysteriously enticing code name, "white night."</page><page sequence="6">568 Kull The event at Jonestown is one of many historical incidents of mass suicide. In 74 A.D., 960 Jewish Zealots committed suicide at Masada rather than fall into the hands of the Romans. In the Seventeenth Century, groups of Russian Schismatics committed mass suicide in crowded churches, rather than adapt to the new reforms of the Russian Orthodox church. After World War II, groups of Cossacks committed suicide, rather than return to Russia. When the Spaniards originally invaded parts of North America, they complained about a drain on the labor supply due to mass suicides by the natives. In Japan, a culture with an extensive and elaborate tradition around suicide, groups of servants or soldiers customarily committed suicide when their master or leader died. It was only with considerable ef- fort that the Japanese government was able to suppress this practice just several decades ago. Finally, there has been the more subtle form of racial suicide found among various primitive tribes that refused to reproduce after their life style was disrupted by outside invaders. Returning to the subject of war, besides the possibility of an un- conscious desire to die with the enemy, there is a much more overt desire to die together with one's own group. The exhilarating camaraderie generated by the potential of imminent mutual death has been glorified by numerous writers in terms that approach the ecstatic and mystical. Dying together with others for a cause is widely vaunted as the most desirable form of death. The glorification of this kind of death appears in the majority of national anthems. The following verse from the national anthem of the Philippines portrays the pleasure of the "sons" of a country dying together as of a higher order than a mystical, rapturous union with a maternal figure: Beautiful land of love, O land of light, In thine embrace 'tis rapture to lie. But it is glory ever, when thou art wronged, For us thy sons to suffer and die. The following selection from the Prussian national anthem also uses family imagery, suggesting, in this case, a fusion with the father as well as one's country achieved through the act of dying in group formation: I am a Prussian. Do you know my banner. Its colors lead with black and white the way. To die for freedom was my father's manner That, you must note, my banner does convey. Ne'er shall I be despairing Like them I will be daring. The Desire for Aggressive Destruction The most common assumption about aggressive behavior, including war, is that it is fundamentally motivated by a rational (even if reprehensi-</page><page sequence="7">Desire for World Destruction 569 ble) desire to improve one's situation in life. It is also a common assumption that this type of aggressiveness is a much more fundamental human motiva- tion than such irrational motives as self-destruction in which the aim of the desire seems to be destruction per se. The typical image of homicide presented by the media involves an in- dividual seeking some instrumental end through murder. Such homicides involve an exceedingly small portion of the total numbers. More than 90% of all murderers are apprehended and usually with little difficulty. The vast majority of homicides are categorized as "crimes of passion," which have no instrumental end. Statistically, the person most apt to kill you is your lover or spouse, and the place where you are most apt to be killed is your bedroom (Lunde, 1975). There is good reason to believe that homicide is closely related to self- destruction. In the vast majority of cases, the homicidal person suffers dramatically, both emotionally and from the legal punishment that usually ensues. Furthermore, a significant portion of murders are followed by suicide, varying from as low as 4% to as high 640%6 depending on the coun- try and the sex of the murderer (women tend to be higher) (West, 1967). A common view of suicide is that it is an expression of aggression turned in on the self. Freud (1959), however, in his later years argued that self-destruction or the death instinct is more fundamental than aggression, and that aggression is primarily self-destructiveness turned away from the self. Although this view has not been a popular one, it is given some support by the fact that suicide is a much more common phenomenon than homicide. Suicide rates exceed homicide rates in virtually every country and, in some cases, even reach a proportion as high as 20 to 1. In any case, it seems that suicide and homicide have common struc- tural goals. In both cases, the effort seems to be to break down or destruc- ture elements in one's field of experience. This may take the form of harming external elements in one's experience or harming one's own body as the mechanism that supports this experience. The Desire for War Today, it is no longer fashionable to be in favor of war, per se. The possibility of being in favor of war has been displayed only humorously as, for example, in the film, Dr. Strangelove, or How ILearned to Stop Worry- ing and Love the Bomb. Looking backward beyond just the last few decades, we can find an abundance of cases where war is explicitly glorified in no uncertain terms. The writers who glorified war were not simply a fringe element, but in- cluded some of the most respected philosophers in history. Among the an-</page><page sequence="8">570 Kull cient Greeks, Pericles derided the unwillingness to go to war as a sign of spiritual decay. Thucydides saw war as building character. Hume, Bacon, Hegel, and Treitschke all saw war as building character and improving the health of nations. Peace was seen as leading to moral stagnation. Spencer saw war as necessary for the eugenics of mankind, and Adam Smith called war the "noblest of arts." In the early part of this century, the glorification of war almost reached religious proportions. Josiah Royce, in The Philosophy of Loyalty, wrote: Let his elemental passion for conflict hereupon fuse with his love for his own coun- trymen into that facinating and blood-thirsty form of humane but furious ecstasy which is the war-spirit. (1919, pp. 39-40). Von Bernhardi wrote, shortly before the First World War: The efforts directed towards the abolition of war must not only be termed foolish, but absolutely immoral and must be stigmatized as unworthy of the human race. To what does the whole question amount? It is proposed to deprive men of the right and the possibility to sacrifice their highest material possessions, their physical life, for ideals, and thus to realize the highest moral unselfishness. (1914, p. 34) Note how Von Bernhardi does not promise material gain from war, but explicitly glorifies the sacrifice of one's possessions and one's life as an end and ideal in itself. There is no need to recount more examples of these militaristic philosophies. As is well known, they appeared in full form in Fascist ideologies. It has really only been since the development of atomic weapons that overt militarism has become such an overtly dangerous philosophy that it has become no longer tenable as a presentable viewpoint. This does not mean, however, that we should assume that the underlying attraction to war has also evaporated. It does mean that wars are now fought in the name of defense, not of war. It goes without saying, though, that there must be some aggressive action involved in a military conflict, and that such conflict must be motivated. Undoubtedly, the attraction to war persists no matter how emphatically it is denied by all participants. Returning to the issue of self-destructiveness, it should be reiterated that the attraction to war can be regarded as a form of self-destructiveness. As discussed previously, wars are economically harmful even to the victor, and for the individual soldier the potential benefits by no means outweigh the risks involved. The attraction to war is the attraction to destruction per se. In this light, it is not surprising that suicide rates generally drop from 25 to 50%o in times of war (Dublin, 1963).</page><page sequence="9">Desire for World Destruction 571 Projections of the Desire for World Destruction An extremely bewildering aspect of the present nuclear arms phenomenon is the impression that there is an unidentified moving force impelling people toward a fate that no one wishes. All sides insist that they have no desire for a nuclear war. And yet, there is a widespread feeling that it is very possible that such a war will, nonetheless, occur. What is this in- visible moving force that controls people against their will? As we shall see, the various images of deity and of the world itself that have been developed in different cultures often depict such an impersonal force that moves toward the destruction of the world. Such images can be regarded as projections of underlying human motives, which, for some reason, are not accepted into conscious awareness. Although these motives may be repressed, it is not difficult to see the influence they have on human behavior. In the Hindu system, the primary destructive deity is Shiva. Shiva forms a trinity with Brahma and Vishnu. Brahma represents the creative force in the universe and is often depicted as the source of both Shiva and Vishnu. Shiva and Vishnu have a polarized relation in which Vishnu is the maintaining, protective principle in contrast to Shiva's destructiveness. Shiva is a complex god - at times playing a beneficent role, but for the most part, breaking down forms. He is known as "the Reabsorber," "He Who Takes Back or Takes Away," and the embodiment of "Super-Death." His son, Skanda, is the God of War. Zimmer wrote: Shiva is... the swallower of time, swallower of all the ages, and cycles of ages. He reduces the phenomenal rhythm and whirlpool to nought, dissolving all things, all beings, all divinities, in the crystal pure, motionless ocean of Eternity.... (1946, p. 167) When dealing with destructiveness at the level of deities, there is little difference between destructiveness and self-destructiveness, since it is the deity itself that is being destroyed. The self-destructive quality of Shiva is demonstrated in the following tale: To punish an attempt to steal his wife, Shiva created a powerful, destructive demon. However, when this demon was about to attack the culprit, Shiva intervened. According to tradition, when a god intervenes and prevents such an attack, he must offer an alter- native prey. Shiva offered his own hands and feet to be eaten. The demon, however, did not stop eating until most of Shiva's body was gone. Rather than being upset, Shiva was delighted with the self-consuming power of his own creation. With only his face left uneaten, Shiva blessed the demon with the name "Face of Glory."4 4The image of the self-consuming whole has been extensively explored as the Uroburos by Neu- mann (1954). A typical image of this archetype is the snake who eats its own tail.</page><page sequence="10">572 Kull Closely related to Shiva is the goddess, Kali. She is both an aspect of Shiva and, at times, his consort. She is depicted as standing in a sea of blood from the children whom she has destroyed and are sipping their blood from a skull. Often she is surrounded by flames that represent the conflagration that ends each world period. Perhaps the most vivid display of the bloodthirsty quality of a deity is in its demand for human sacrifice-a practice that appears in numerous cultures. In Hinduism, it is the goddess Camunda, another consort of Shiva, who demands such sacrifice. The following is a verse from the Bhavabuti repeated by priests at a human sacrifice: Hail, hail! Camunda, mighty goddess, hail! I glorify thy sport, when in the dance That fills the court of Shiva with delight Thy God descending spurns the earthly globe. ... the whirling talons rend The crescent on they brow; from the torn orb The trickling nectar falls, and every skull That gems thy necklace laughs with horrid life. In the image of deity in the Judeo-Christian tradition, we find a more complex problem. Since this is a monotheistic system, and the One God is presented as omnipotent, it is more difficult to reconcile the destructive aspects of the deity with the image of a benevolent, wise, loving, paternal figure (i.e., the summum bonum). This problem has been explored in depth by Jung in Answer to Job (1969), and the following discussion draws on his work. One of the major ways that the destructive aspects of the deity is presented is in the image of Satan. Clearly, Satan is a creation of Yahweh-even for awhile his favorite. And, since Yahweh is all-powerful and all-knowing, it should not be assumed that God simply failed in some way when Satan rebelled and began his destructive career. Satan can be better interpreted as an aspect of Yahweh, rather than his opposite. Numerous other stories in the Old Testament depict a God that is im- pulsive, wrathful, jealous, and prone to demand macabre tests of loyalty. He describes Himself as "a jealous God" who not only "visits iniquity" on the unfaithful, but punishes their innocent progeny "unto the third and fourth generations." He shows extreme favoritism and does not hesitate to perform massive slaughters of innocent children in order to aid his favored group. Even more striking are the tests of loyalty he requires from even his most favored subjects. He asserts His right to demand the first-born son in all cases (Genesis 22:29), and in the case of Abraham, actually makes the demand, relenting only when Abraham has the knife at Issac's throat. Evidently, Yahweh has some definite infanticidal tendencies.</page><page sequence="11">Desire for World Destruction 573 The story of Job is a particularly vivid depiction of God's willingness to be destructive. In response to a boastful wager by Satan, God agrees to allow Satan to kill off all of Job's family and servants, and to inflict undue hardship on Job, as well. This brings Job to the point where he wishes for death and assumes that God would find pleasure in destroying him (Job 6:8, 9). Apparently, the essence of Job's test is to accept the destructive impulse of God, and to refrain from cursing it with what would be understandable bitterness. The developmental process that Job seems to go through is one in which he grasps the nature of God as indiscriminately destructive. In the New Testament, there is an increased emphasis on the loving aspect of God, even to the point of identifying God with love itself. However, this loving quality is not easily won: to realize it, God's son, Christ, must be sacrificed. Once again, the image of a god with infanticidal tendencies appears. Christ offers himself as a cathartic object to mollify these impulses. Furthermore, Christ must continually beseech God to restrain His harsh ways with his children. Jung wrote: .. although Christ has complete confidence in his father and even feels at one with him, he cannot help inserting the cautious petition-and warning-into the Lord's Prayer: 'Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.' God is asked not to entice us outright into doing evil, but rather to deliver us from it. The possibility that Yahweh, in spite of all the precautionary measures and in spite of his express inten- tion to become the Summum Bonum, might yet revert to his former ways is not so remote that one need not keep one eye open for it. At any rate, Christ considers it appropriate to remind his father of his destructive inclinations towards mankind and to beg him to desist from them. Judged by any human standards it is after all unfair, indeed extremely immoral, to entice little children into doing things that might be dangerous for them, simply in order to test their moral stamina! Especially as the difference between a child and a grown-up is immeasurably smaller than that between God and his creatures, whose moral weakness is particularly well known to him. The incongruity of it is so colossal that if this petition were not in the Lord's Prayer, one would have to call it sheer blasphemy, because it really will not do to ascribe such contradictory behavior to the God of Love and Summum Bonum. (1969, pp. 48-49). Jung further suggested that the essential meaning of the incarnation in Christ is that God needs to have His destructive tendencies tempered by a humanizing experience. Such an experience would, hopefully, make God more compassionate and restrained. With the story of the apocalypse in Revelations, however, the restraint of the deity is entirely lost. Here the wrath of God (also depicted as the "wrath of the Lamb," a symbol of the short-lived effort to be somewhat more kind) is released in a massive destruction of the human race, after which there are only 144,000 survivors (Revelations 7:4). Among the many images of destruction is one of the "great winepress of the wrath of God," "as high as a horse's bridle, for one thousand six hundred stadia" (Revela- tions 14:19-20) in which humans are crushed. Even the once-forgiving</page><page sequence="12">574 Kull Christ gets into the act and treads "the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God" (Revelations 18:20). With appropriate chagrin, Jung described the Apocalypse as: ...a terrifying picture that blatantly contradicts all ideas of Christian humility, tolerance, love of your neighbor and your enemies, and makes nonsense of a loving father in heaven and rescuer of mankind. A veritable orgy of hatred, wrath, vindic- tiveness, and blind destructive fury that revels in fantastic images of terror breaks out and with blood and fire overwhelms a world which Christ had just endeavored to restore to the original state of innocence and loving communion with God. (1969, p. 76) Beside the anthropomorphic images of deity, the desire for world destruction can also be projected onto the world or the universe itself. In this case, the world is seen as having a tendency to go through a periodic process of apocalyptic self-destruction followed by renewal. Eliade (1959a) has described this as "the myth of the eternal return" and demonstrates its ap- pearance in virtually all cultures. A variety of systems map out elaborate frameworks covering millions of years with the periodic apocalyptic moments carefully and mathematically determined. Eliade also observed that more recently, as the concept of time has evolved from a cyclic concept to a more linear one, the image of the apocalypse has become less associated with a cyclic process and more with the image of a final end. This end is usually followed by some transformation into some other entirely different mode of being, but sometimes the image of an absolute end also appears. War and the Projected Desire for World Destruction Certainly one of the most stirring images used to incite the sacrifices of war is of a larger entity that wants the war. The choice to participate is not presented primarily as a means to achieve personal gain, but rather as an op- portunity to fuse oneself with this larger entity-the fusion being most fully achieved when there is a willingness to sacrifice one's life to fulfill the pur- poses of the entity. Although the purposes of the larger entity may be presented as being ultimately beneficial in the human dimension, this is by no means always the case, and is most often fairly incidental. Calls to battle do not usually em- phasize the benefits of war as much as the idea that the intention of the larger entity transcends the question of human suffering, and that it would be better for all to die in the name of that intention than not to attempt it. Incidents in which groups knowingly sacrificed themselves by entering a hopeless battle are explicitly glorified as being exemplary. It is no wonder that the image of the</page><page sequence="13">Desire for World Destruction 575 larger entity itself is often depicted as having a certain fanaticism and destruc- tiveness that is oblivious to human suffering. For example, in the song, "The Battle Hymn of the Republic," the war itself is described not as a battle between groups, but as the "coming" of God in a style drawn from the apocalyptic imagery of Revelations. God is even quoted as intending to kill not only the enemy, but also the singers themselves as an act of "Grace." In the final verse, the soliders affirm not only their will- ingness to die, but also their intention to die as a necessary step in the onward march of God and his "truth." Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord; He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored; He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword His truth is marching on.... I have read the fiery gospel writ in burnished rows of steel: "As ye deal with my contemners so with you My Grace shall deal"... In the beauties of the lilies Christ was born across the sea, With a glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me; As he died to make men holy, let us die to make men free While God is marching on. The intentions of the deity toward war are not always clothed in the images of a vague righteousness as they tend to be in Christian imagery. In Hindu literature, the deity is more openly depicted as being in favor of war itself. One of the major Hindu texts, the Mahabarata, is a long epic poem describing a war between two lines of descendants the ultimately results in the destruction of both sides. This war is directly encouraged by the deity, Krishna. In the most famous section of the Mahabarata, the Bhagavad Gita, the leader of one side, Arjuna, begins to question the purpose of the war. Krishna appears promptly and insists that he must carry out the slaughter, reminding him that physical life is only temporal, and at the same time maligning his masculinity should he have a change of heart. There is no am- biguity about Krishina's desire to manifest himself through war. When he shows himself in his "glory," there are "marvelous and many uplifted weapons." The fact that these wishes of the god for war are harmful to humans is also fully recognized. In a section of the Mahabarata entitled, "The Tyranny of the Divinity," God is presented as a cruel parent acting out his own sadistic infanticidal tendencies through the medium of war: Behold the power of illusion that hath been spread by God, who confounding with his illusion, maketh creatures slay their fellows... the Selfcreate Grandsire, Almighty God, spreading illusion slayeth his creatures by the instrumentality of his creatures, as one may break a piece of inert and senseless wood with wood, or stone with stone, or iron with iron! And the Supreme Lord, according to his pleasure, sporteth with his creatures, exalting and destroying them like a child with his toy. (3:30)</page><page sequence="14">576 Kull The collective self-destructiveness of war appears not only in the im- agery of an anthropomorphic deity, but also in the more impersonal images of totality that describe the periodic or final appearance of apocalyptic destruction. The determinations of these processes are sometimes depicted as intensifying the enmity between people, thus leading to wars that are disastrous to all parties. Here again, the pain and suffering are not simply at- tributed to human action; they are seen as the inevitable unfolding of the im- personal patterns of some larger entity. Nuclear Arms and the Projected Desire for World Destruction As we have discussed, the present world nuclear arms situation presents the baffling picture of humans claiming to be impelled by a force that is, against their intention, leading them to self-destruction. As we shall see, im- ages that involve the projected desire for world destruction play a role in our relation to nuclear weapons and offer some insight into the irrational nature of this phenomenon. The desire for world destruction is not only projected onto the image of an abstract deity, but the deity is sometimes seen as em- bodied in the bomb itself. Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, when he observed the first atomic explosion, reported that his first thought was the quote from the Bhagavad Gita describing the god, Krishna: If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky That would be like the spendor of the Mighty One ... I am become Death The shatterer of worlds. Perhaps Oppenheimer was simply making a causal literary comparison. However, Lifton's (1979) study of the psychological dynamics operating in the group of scientists who developed and later promoted atomic weapons revealed that their attitude toward the bomb had a highly religious quality. He used the word "nuclearism" for this mentality, and described it as follows: Nuclearism is a secular religion, a total ideology in which 'grace' and even 'salvation,' the mastery of death and evil - are achieved through the power of a new technological deity. The deity is seen as capable not only of apocalyptic destruction but also of unlimited creation. And the nuclear believer or 'nuclearist' allies himself with that power and feels compelled to expound on the virtues of his deity. (1979, p. 369) Lifton went on to examine how this "religion" spread to politicians and diplomats who played a crucial role in establishing the U.S. government policy of stockpiling vast arsenals of atomic and nuclear weapons and resisting any treaties that would limit their development.</page><page sequence="15">Desire for World Destruction 577 Another study by Lifton (1979) revealed how the image of the bomb can become imbued with a transcendental quality. In a study of young people who have lived their whole lives with the bomb, Lifton investigated their rela- tionship to the bomb, which usually began with their first air raid drills in school. He found that the bomb was often perceived as having supernatural qualities. In a number of cases, there were mystical-type experiences of merg- ing with the bomb, and even of wishing that the bomb would drop. The image of the deity acting through nuclear weapons also plays a role in a number of fundamentalist Christian groups that interpret the Bible literally and find evidence that an apocalyptic destruction of the world is fair- ly imminent. Many Biblical passages, including some attributed to Jesus, can be interpreted as meaning that the Second Coming will occur in this epoch. These passages indicate that the Second Coming will be preceded by wars and by massive destruction; It is quite easy to transpose the imagery of the predicted apocalypse onto the imagery of nuclear war and conclude that God is actually preparing the apocalypse through the development of nuclear weapons. Old Testment descriptions can be used to elaborate this idea, as well. Some of these descriptions have an almost uncanny similarity to the events that would lead up to the result from a nuclear war. For example, Isaiah's vision of the apocalypse depicts a war in which all sides lose and which results in widespread damage to the ecology - a phenomenon that was certainly unknown in Isaiah's time: For the indignation of the Lord is upon all the nations, and his fury upon all their ar- mies: He hath utterly destroyed them, He hath delivered them to the slaughter.... And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch. It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up forever: From generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever. (34: 2,9,10) Of course, the fundamentalist view is that the similarities between the Biblical descriptions of the apocalypse and the present potential for nuclear war indicate precognition or divine revelation on the part of the authors of the Bible. Jung (1969) also takes seriously the idea that John's prediction of the apocalypse occurring during this particular period of history can be regarded as at least partly an intuition about the development of nuclear weapons. While I would not reject parapsychological interpretations out of hand, I think there may be a simpler way to account for the similarities in these perceptions. The projected desire for world destruction may produce ar- chetypal images that appear in different cultures. These images in turn may actually influence the course of human events and, therefore, have a deter- minative as well as predictive meaning. In this light, it is not surprising that a culture that has been raised on apocalyptic imagery for two thousand years</page><page sequence="16">578 Kull would gravitate toward its realization. And from this perspective, it may not be necessary to assume there is a transcendent entity or order leading us to an- nihilation - other than the images derived from our mutually projected desire for world destruction. THE ARCHETYPE OF WORLD DESTRUCTION In the beginning of this paper, I explored evidence that there is a desire, usually unconscious, that draws us toward would destruction, and that this desire may be influencing our present trend toward a nuclear holocaust. In this second part, I will attempt to penetrate more deeply into the nature of this world-destructive impulse. Rather than viewing it as simply a perverse element in human nature, the effort here is to understand it as a fundamental psychological process. Given that the imagery of world destruction appears almost universally in myth and rituals, we may well refer to it as an archetypal image or process. As we shall see, viewing this impulse as based in an abstract, archetypal process, rather than as a literal instinct, raises the possibili- ty that this process may be expressed in a form that is not so literally destruc- tive. The Meaning of Self-destruction To understand the collective tendency to self-destruction, we must begin with the individual tendency. What is it that makes self-destruction attractive to the individual? Freud (1959) theorized that the aim of the death instinct is actual biological death, consistent with the general tendency of entropy to achieve an undifferentiated condition. I think it is a questionable practice to use objective principles derived from physics as a foundation for explaining subjective motivation. The principle of entropy can, however, be regarded as a useful metaphor for describing a certain tendency in human motivation to achieve a certain structural condition. The condition that is attractive should not, however, be necessarily equated with biological death. The biological aspects of dying per se are near- ly always perceived as extremely repugnant and frightening. However, the subjective condition achieved through death is frequently described as positive and desirable. Sometimes this state is described as an undifferen- tiated condition of dissolution. In other cases, it is described in terms of the ultimate satisfaction of familiar worldly needs - a condition in which there is no longer any tension in relation to the environment. Images of various types</page><page sequence="17">Desire for World Destruction 579 of ordered, harmonic balance are also quite common. A common theme that emerges in the structural characteristics of these various descriptions is unity. Many writers have pointed to the desire for unity as a fundamental trend in human motivation. Rank (1929) spoke of the desire to return to the unity that was originally found in the womb. He also related this desire to the desire for death. Fromm (1973) spoke of an actual desire for unity, and Silverstein's forthcoming book (see Adams, 1982) describes the "desire for oneness" as a basic human motivation. My own study of the perceived structural characteristic of desired states indicated that unity is a dominant quality of such states (Kull, 1980). What this suggests is that the desire for self-destruction may not be an actual desire for death but rather for a transformation of experience. It may be that when one's experience lacks the desired quality of unity, a level of frustration is reached in which there is a willingness to undergo the painful processes necessary to alter one's state radically. The predominant finding of Durkheim's (1951) major study of suicide was that the populations with the highest incidence of suicide were those with the lowest level of social in- tegration. The act of suicide may be motivated not only by the desire to ter- minate a painful condition of alienation, but also by the desire (perhaps un- conscious) to achieve an experience of greater unity. In this sense, when we speak of self-destruction, the self being destroyed is not the body per se, but a particular image or experience of the self in a state of disunity. From this perspective, the thoughts and even the acts of suicide may be interpreted as a particular enactment or "literalization" of an archetypal transformative process. Hillman (1964) has suggested that the suicidal pa- tient should be understood as seeking a way to alter or terminate his or her life, radically. Effective interventions with suicidal patients may involve finding ways for the patient to go through this self-destructive process by means other than the literal method of biological suicide. This perspective is supported by a study of patients who recovered from a severe suicidal episode (Moss and Hamilton, 1959). They wrote: We found consistently that recovery requires a major change in the life situation. Only three recovered patients returned to the same environments in which the illness arose without fundamental changes in the employment situation or personal rela- tionships. All other recovered patients had made some significant change that could be interpreted as a "death" of an old self, e.g., quitting a job, ending or significantly improving a relationship. This image of death as a psychological transformative process appears in a wide variety of contexts. Various studies of primitive initiation rites point to the image of willfully inflicted death followed by rebirth as an</page><page sequence="18">580 Kull almost universal characteristic (Eliade, 1965). The neophyte submits to a series of painful experiences that are meant to "kill" the "old self' as a means of realizing the "new self' who is then a more integrated part of the group. Perry's (1974) studies of acute schizophrenics illustrated the widespread imagery of death as a symbol of the psychotic break itself and the imagery of wholeness and integration as the intended conclusion of this otherwise painful process. Even in the context of artistic creativity, the im- agery of death as a transformative process appears. Kandinsky, for exam- ple, vividly described the process of creativity as one of destruction and rebirth: Painting is a thundering collision of different worlds, intended to create a new world which is the work of art. Each work originates just as does the cosmos-through catastrophes which out of the chaotic din of instruments ultimately create a sym- phony, the music of the spheres. (1964) The Meaning of World Destruction The tendency to world destruction can also be interpreted as the ex- pression of a transformative impulse. In the beginning of this paper we observed archetypal patterns of world destruction through the imagery of world destructive deities and periodic apocalypses. Perhaps a more com- prehensive explication of the meaning of this archetypal process can be found in the rituals of world destruction that are widely practiced in primitive cultures. Several anthropologists and psychologists, most notably Eliade (1959a), have examined these rituals and described their common characteristics. Most often, they are performed around the new year or at the time of the harvest. The ritual imagery emphasizes destruction of the old world as a necessary process for bringing in the new. There are roughly three aspects of the ritual: (1) the destruction of forms; (2) contact with the primordial transcendent level; and (3) the recreation of forms or rebirth. The destruction of forms is characteristically enacted in widespread chaos. For a certain period, the normal laws of the society dissolve. There are orgies, servants play at being masters, kings are humiliated, and there is general frenzy and indulgence. Through ritual enactments, the world is drowned by floods or devoured by flames. Sometimes, there are acts of self- mutilation, or animal or human sacrifices. Groups of soldiers enact ritual combats of death and destruction. Eliade wrote: The last days of the past year can be identified with the pre-Creation chaos.... (they) mark the abolition of all norms and in their violence, to illustrate an overturn- ing of values (e.g., exchange of condition between masters and slaves, women</page><page sequence="19">Desire for World Destruction 581 treated as courtesans), a general license, an orgiastic modality of society, in a word, a reversion of all forms to indeterminate unity... a return to the primordial unity, to the inauguration of a 'nocturnal' regime in which limits, contours, distances, are in- discernible. (1959a, pp. 68-69) The shattering of forms makes possible a reconnection with a dimen- sion that transcends mundane existence. This dimension is beyond time and the ritualized destruction constitutes what Eliade called the "abolition of time." Within this realm, the dead are able to commune with the living. More importantly, through, by breaking the structures of mundane time, one is able to experience the eternal realm, the source of all time, the ground from which all forms arise. Finally, the experience of this "original" condition leads to the recrea- tion of time, form, and the world. The overall emphasis of the ritual is not simply to escape the structures of time, but to reenact what Eliade called the entire "cosmogonic act." This is done first by returning to the original con- dition of formlessness and eternity, reexperiencing the original creative im- pulse, and then symbolically recreating the world of form and time. The ef- fect of this process is one of regeneration, purification, and renewal. A pro- totype of the entire process can be found in the ritual of baptism, where the immersion in water (a symbolic death or dissolution) is followed by a reemergence in a more purified form. The process of recreating the world is often more vigorous and com- plex than simply choosing to reemerge out of the formless. The entire pro- cess of creating the world must be reenacted, which often entails a kind of struggle against the chaos of the formless. This may be depicted as a battle of a deity against a dragon or sea monster. In some cases, this process is enacted through ritual combat where one group succeeds in subduing another. The chaos, symbolizing the original unstructured condition, is now conquered and subdued in order to recreate the organized world. The ritual itself may include an actual reestablishment and reinstatement of social and legal structures. Eliade (1959b) explained that the meaning of such rituals is the reestab- lishment of a sacred order. The primitive views the order of human society as continuous with all order in the natural world. The order of human society is not simply an arbitrary human choice, but is sacred in that it arises from a transcendental dimension. When any new structure is developed in the course of the year, e.g., a new method for hunting, it is regarded as pro- fane, i.e., not yet part of the sacred order, not natural. In the yearly ritual of destruction, the old sacred order as well as the new profane elements are symbolically dissolved back into the one source. Only after such a dissolu- tion can a new order emerge that assimilates the formerly profane elements into the sacred. The tension between the purely human or profane dimen- sion and the natural or sacred dimension is resolved by dissolving all order</page><page sequence="20">582 Kull into its original state of chaos. Then, the order that reemerges out of this common ground is coherent in that it is an expression of a single, underlying principle. The need for such rituals of world destruction to create this sense of order and of meaning is not entirely absent in modern man. The modern New Year's Eve party with its chaos, indulgence, atypical behavior, and im- ages of the old year dying and the new year as a baby, show many of the ear- marks of the original ritual form. The importance of destruction as an im- age of birth or origin is also indicated by the fact that three major countries of the modern world, the United States, the Soviet Union, and China, all see themselves as explicitly founded on a revolution, which is referred to in reverent, semi-religious terms, and celebrated on a yearly basis. In the United States, this celebration is accompanied by explosions and fireworks and, in some cases reenactment of some of the original battles of the revolu- tion. War and the Archetype of World Destruction The question now arises whether war in general and nuclear war in particular can be better understood in terms of this archetypal process of world destruction exemplified by primitive rituals. As we have already discussed, the fact that there is no adequate explanation for war in more ob- vious terms means that we must begin to look to some of the more complex processes that emerge out of the human psyche. It may be that war is actual- ly a relatively recent permutation of the underlying archetype of world destruction. It is a popular assumption that war is a fixed trait in human behavior. Numerous philosophers have described war as being the original or most natural human condition. However, the preponderance of archaeological and anthropological evidence suggests quite the contrary. The phenomenon of war seems to have emerged only fairly recently in human evolution. Wars as we know them, i.e., wars of conquest, only appeared approximately 7000 years ago. Before then, there were ritual wars, but even these only go back approximately 13,000 years. It was during that period (the Neolithic Period) that the first weapons of war appeared, although the technology necessary for such weapons existed as far back as the Middle Pleistocene period (near- ly 200,000 years ago) (Mansfield, 1982). There are good reasons to believe that rituals of world destruction pre- ceded the appearance of the first ritual wars. What evidence exists of the pre-Neolithic ages indicates that there were widespread rituals that involved themes of destruction, death, and rebirth.</page><page sequence="21">Desire for World Destruction 583 Furthermore, the wars that appeared in the Neolithic Period closely followed the patterns of the ritual of world destruction. The purpose of these wars was not economic gain, but rather, religious significance. Highly formalized rules were followed and usually, as soon as just one person was killed, both sides would make a hasty retreat. The essence of the war was the act of killing as a ritual act. As in the archetypal ritual of world destruc- tion, the war represents a return to the original chaos, followed by the con- quering of chaos, and the reestablishment of religious and legal structures. Mansfield (1982) wrote that ritualized war is a reenactment of the cosmogonic act of creation. Although the wars of civilized society became increasingly associated with political and economic conquest, they were nonetheless still closely related to archetypal processes. As discussed previously, the reasons for war are rarely viewed as economic and instead are bound up with collective sym- bolic and religious meanings. War is justified and valued as a transcenden- tal test that leads to purification, renewal, and the prevalence of the good. As Gaster (1961) and Bentzen (1955) have suggested, war can be considered a historification of processes that are more fundamentally mythic and religious. Even in the more secularized wars of modern times, one can still observe many of the archetypal patterns found in primitive rituals of world destruction. The normal, established structures of living are dramatically disrupted and there is widespread destruction. For a period of time, events take on a heightened significance. The encounter with death, the potential for cultural collapse, the sense of the individual being swept by collective forces, and the potential for heroism and honor, all give war an aura of transcendence that is not afforded by the mundane character of normal liv- ing. Finally, with the end of the war, a new order is created that has a peculiar vitality. This is more than a simple release from the destructive ef- fects of the war. The destruction itself seems to lead into some increase of in- tensity, a regeneration, and revitalization. This revitalization may be economic, as well as psychological, and may apply to the vanquished, as well as the victor, as it did for Germany and Japan after World War II. Nuclear Arms and The Archetype of World Destruction Numerous aspects of the nuclear arms phenomena also reflect key elements of the archetype of world destruction. First and foremost, the im- age of the exploding bomb is an exceedingly powerful, transcendental im- age, of which there are few in our highly secularized society. The image of</page><page sequence="22">584 Kull the bomb implies not only destruction, but total annihilation and a return to the beginning.5 The association of the bomb with the "return to the beginning" or the "abolition of time" can be found in the response of those who observed the first atomic explosions. The survivors of the Hiroshima explosion actually referred to the bomb as "the original child" (Merton, 1962). After the first atomic explosion of Alamogordo, William Lawrence described the ex- perience as follows: On that moment hung eternity. Time stood still. Space contracted to a pinpoint. It was though the earth had opened and the skies had split. One felt as though he had been privileged to witness the Birth of the World.... The big boom came about a hundred seconds after the great flash - the first cry of a newborn world.... (1959, pp. 116-119) The attitudes expressed about the first atomic explosion also make clear the role of this image as a world-transforming symbol. Henry Stim- son, Secretary of War while the bomb was being developed, expressed the view that "this project (the making of the atomic bomb) should not be con- sidered simply in terms of military weapons, but a new relationship of man to the universe." After the Hiroshima bomb, an article in the New York Herald Tribune stated "One forgets the effect on Japan or on the course of the war as one senses the foundations of one's own universe trembling." President Truman, on hearing the news, exclaimed, "This is the greatest thing in history!" Lifton (1979), in accord with his concept of "nuclearism" to describe the religious quality of the attitudes toward the bomb, wrote: As with any religion, embrace of nuclearism is likely to be marked by a 'conversion ex- perience'- an immersion in death anxiety followed by rebirth into the new world view. At the heart of the conversion experience is an overwhelming sense of awe-a version of Freud's 'oceanic feeling' in which one's own significance in relationship to the larger universe is so extreme as to feel oneself, in effect, annihilated. (1979, p. 569) Lifton went on to describe several highly influential individuals who became virtually fanatical about the importance and value of nuclear weapons. The idea of the weapons ushering in some new era appears repeatedly and is perhaps most vividly expressed by an argument by Teller that the mutations caused by fallout may actually lead to a new development in the evolution of the human race. He wrote: Deploring the mutations that may be caused by fallout is something like adopting the policies of the Daughters of the American Revolution, who approve of a post revolu- tion, but condemn future reforms. (quoted in Lifton, 1979, p. 428) 5This was alluded to in a science fiction story of a post-World War III civilization that was built on the ruins of nuclear war and reestablished the calendar of years beginning with the time immediately following the holocaust.</page><page sequence="23">Desire for World Destruction 585 Clearly, the image of nuclear arms is a powerful symbol for eliciting fundamental archetypal processes related to the image of world destruction. Several psychiatrists have recognized the danger that nuclear arms hold as a means for realizing these psychological processes. Psychoanalyst Edward Glover wrote: The most cursory study of dream life and of the phantasies of the insane shows that ideas of world destruction (more accurately destruction of what the world symbolizes) are latent in the unconscious mind. And since the atomic bomb is less a weapon of war than a weapon of extermination it is well adapted to the more bloodthirsty phantasies with which man is secretly preoccupied during phases of acute frustration. Nagasaki destroyed by the magic of science is the nearest man has yet approached in the realiza- tion of dreams that even during the safe immobility of sleep are accustomed to develop into nightmares of anxiety. The first promise of the atomic age is that it can make some of our nightmares come true. The capacity so painfully acquired by normal men to distinguish between sleep, delusion, hallucination and the objective reality of waking life has for the first time in human history been seriously weakened. (1976, p. 274) Lifton and Olson went even further in referring to a "need" related to the image of world destruction that may play itself out in the context of nuclear arms: Expressed boldly, there may be a need to destroy one's world for purposes of im- agined rebirth, a need which lends itself either to suicidal obliteration or to transfor- mation and regeneration. This need takes advantage not only of every variety of in- dividual and social aggression but fits as well with the psychological principle of touching death, either imaginatively or literally, as a precondition of new life. Thus, nuclear weapons can achieve vivid symbolic representation in our minds precisely because of their promise of devastation. (Lifton and Olson, 1976, p. 102) The Psychodynamics of Nuclear Militarism Nuclear militarism, or the belief that nuclear military action is valid and meaningful, can be characterized as a particular psychological orienta- tion. This orientation can be described as a particular mode of assimilating the influences of the archetype of world destruction. Most centrally, it represents a tendency to literalize these influences into the political realm. However, there are at least three significantly different ways of assimilating the influences - ways which depend on the various effects of the dynamic of identification. Jung has described how the individual's conscious psyche can become heavily dominated by a particular archetype. As this becomes more extreme, and particularly as the individual tends to repress the influences of opposite archetypes, there develops a condition that can be characterized as identifica- tion with the archetype. The most basic form of militarism can be characterized as an iden- tification with the archetype of world destruction. This phenomenon was described previously as the desire for war and the almost mystical belief in</page><page sequence="24">586 Kull the transformative power of war. It is not difficult to see how the opposite archetype (let us call it "preservation") is repressed. There is an extraor- dinary lack of concern with the question of human survival. The transfor- mation achieved through war becomes the only concern; it must be achieved at any cost. Since World War II and the development of the atomic bomb, this type of orientation has become very unpopular. Perhaps the devastation of the war, or perhaps the vividness of the effects of the atomic bomb, made it a difficult orientation to sustain. Nevertheless, there is no question that even in the context of nuclear weaponry there are those who yearn for the opportunity to transform the world by purifying it of Communism, even if it means massive loss of lives on both sides. For the most part, however, this orientation is rejected and is subject to a certain amount of ridicule. A much more common and widespread form of nuclear militarism can be characterized in almost opposite terms. In this case, the conscious iden- tification is with the archetype of preservation. The tendency is to identify with established structures and to regard their defense as intrinsically right and essential. The impulse to destruction is completely repressed and, in- stead, is projected onto the enemy who is viewed as being imbued with an insane zeal for destruction. In other words, the enemy is perceived as iden- tified with destructiveness and ignoring preservation. This image is certainly projected by the Americans and Soviets onto each other. Both view the other as compelled by an ideological fervor that could lead them to initiate a suicidal war. In this context, it then becomes a meaningful response to use military force even if that action may ultimately lead to self-destruction. In this way, the underlying, repressed destructive impulse insidiously still asserts itself though in the name of its opposite. It becomes possible to con- sider destroying the world in the name of saving it. A recent study lends support to the hypothesis that a tendency to iden- tify with established structures and repress destructive/transformative pro- cesses correlates positively with a militaristic orientation. Benson and Strommen (Benson, 1981) studied the correlation between the voting patterns and religious beliefs in a sample of U.S. Congressmen. Rather than using con- ventional denominations, they placed each subject in a category on a con- tinuum. At one end of the continuum were the "legalistic religionists" who emphasize rigid, traditional, and absolute rules and an image of God as a restrictive force. At the other end were the "nontraditional religionists" who describe God as mysterious, difficult to define, or as a "process," and as releasing rather than as restrictive. These categories can be related to the tendencies, on the one hand, to identify with established structure and repress destructive/transformative impulses and, on the other hand, to view structures as less absolute and to be more open to change. Interestingly, the</page><page sequence="25">Desire for World Destruction 587 "legalistic religionists" Congressmen voted in favor of a strong military 84% of the time, while the "nontraditional religionists" did so only 26% of the time. More recently, a third form of nuclear militarism has appeared that is even more complex than the two already described. In the first form, the em- phasis is on promoting war to achieve a positive transformation. In the se- cond, the emphasis is on the importance of preservative defense. In this third there is an almost schizophrenic attempt to do both at the same time. In contrast to the strategy of deterrence, a new strategy often known as the "war-winning" strategy has gained dominance in the U.S. defense establishment. It was initially built on the perception that the Soviets were not deterred by the suicidal implications of a nulcear war, and were in fact preparing to win a nuclear war (see Pipes, 1977). This, almost paradoxically, led to the idea that the Soviets were right and that, in fact, a nuclear war is willable. Gray in his article with Payne, "Victory is Possible," went on to say that we should, therefore, prepare to win a nuclear war (Gray and Payne, 1980). Gray's argument expresses a curious combination of both the preser- vative and the destructive principles. However, rather than being a blend, they exist side by side in a fragmented, contradictory fashion. If I under- stand him correctly, Gray is saying that the United States should plan to in- itiate a nuclear war as a means of deterring a nuclear war. His argument speaks to both the need for preservation and the desire for transformative destruction simultaneously, without reference to the contradiction between these positions. It is not difficult to see the signs of the archetype of world destruction. Gray clearly argues that we should be willing to sacrifice a major portion of the population to achieve a positively transformed world. The United States should plan to defeat the Soviet Union and to do so at a cost that would not prohibit U.S. recovery. Washington should identify war aims that in the last resort would contemplate the destruction of Soviet political authority and the emergence of a postwar world order compatible with western values. (p. 21) As for potential losses, he concedes only that: ...a U.S. president...should not launch a strategic nuclear strike if expected U.S. casualities are likely to involve 100 million or more American citizens. (p. 26) The earmarks of a traditional world destruction myth become especial- ly apparent when he draws on the guidelines of the Catholic Church for a "just war." He writes that the policy of deterrence is "immoral" because, inconsistent with the "just war" guidelines, it ...contains no definition of success aside from denying victory to the enemy (and) no promise that the successful use of nuclear power would insure a better future than surrender... (p. 17)</page><page sequence="26">588 Kull In other words, he draws on ecclesiastical authority to insist that nuclear war should be seen as offering a potentially positive transformation. However, this old-fashioned appeal to destructive/transformative im- pulses is simultaneously offset by the claim that all these proposals are meant to "enhance" deterrence. The act of planning to initiate a nuclear war and simultaneously assessing the ultimate value of such a war is meant to pre- vent such a war from happening. I do not mean to imply that Gray is simply a wolf in sheep's clothing, or that he is trying simply to manipulate his reader. All humans find it difficult to assimilate both the needs for preser- vation and destructive transformation in a coherent way. I do believe, however, that his is a particularly dangerous way. There is not a shred of evidence to support the idea that planning violent behavior and extolling its benefits reduce the probability of its occurring. There is however, a con- siderable body of evidence that suggests the opposite. Conclusion The final question that inevitably arises is whether there are ways that humans can reconcile the needs for preservation and destructive transfor- mation and diminish the psychological trend toward nuclear war. This is, of course, a vast subject, but two potential developments that show promise can be identified. These are the trends toward the deliteralized expression of psychological needs and the disidentification from established psychological structures. For some time now, there has been a tendency in Western culture to literalize psychological needs, i.e., to see the literal, objective world as the primary context where psychological needs are fulfilled. This is in contrast to other societies, where highly developed mythic and ritual domains were a primary context for dealing with psychological needs.6 No doubt, the rise of the materialistic view of the universe has contributed to this secularized orientation. It has been perhaps most aptly characterized in the modern television commercial, which promulgates the view that an extraordinary number of psychic needs can be fulfilled through the acquisition of material products. Most likely, modern culture has become too highly pluralized to recreate the cohesive collective contexts for realizing psychological pro- cesses found in primitive societies. However, an important trend is the 6There is a cogent argument to be made that war has arisen as the efficaciousness of such nonliteral contexts has declined.</page><page sequence="27">Desire for World Destruction 5b9 development of individual contexts for realizing psychological processes. This is occurring most vividly in the context of psychotherapy. The therapist and patient together develop a framework of models and symbols within which the patient is able to realize psychological processes. The effect of bringing these processes into consciousness is to deliteralize their expres- sion and lessen the probability that they will be problematically realized in the behavioral or somatic realm. At present, probably the most widespread psychological syndrome that contributes to the unconscious trend toward nuclear war is the iden- tification with established psychological structures. As discussed previously the tendency to identify with established structures leads to the repression of destructive impulses and their projection onto an enemy who then must be fought.7 To move beyond this psychological syndrome requires a certain disidentification from established structures that could allow some degree of assimilation of the destructive/transformative impulse. In other words, the rigid identity that leads to militaristic polarization would need to be replaced by an identity that is less attached to any specific structure and is more oriented to identity as a process that includes an ongoing, or at least periodic, transformation. This shift in orientation is not just something that occurs at an in- dividual level, but at a collective, cultural level, as well. Too often, culture stands as a bulwark against change rather than a means for assimilating it. However, there are several trends that can be interpreted as a general disidentification from an absolute, collectively held reality. The most notable area where this trend can be observed is in the field of physics. The image of an absolute reality of physical objects suspended in time and space, existing independently of human consciousness, has been thoroughly quashed. While the average person may not really grasp the newer theories themselves, there is an increasing awareness that science no longer claims to have elucidated a final version of reality. This "loosening" of reality has had its parallel development in all of the arts where predictable or representational art has declined in favor of art that tends to destructure and modify experience. Within the field of psychology, altered states of awareness and even psychotic states of aware- ness have become increasingly regarded, not as simple observations, but as alternative modes of experience that may at times even have a positively transformative effect. In short, there are numerous areas of the culture that are moving in the direction of supporting the processes of destructuration and reformation. 7The tendency to identify with the destructive pole can be a powerful problem but, as far as I can see, at present it is a lesser problem in the population as a whole.</page><page sequence="28">590 Kull These trends may seem like weak candles to hold up in the face of the awesome power of nuclear weapons. They certainly do not eradicate the feeling that somewhere there may be an enemy who will cause our destruc- tion. But then, they are not meant to. Somewhere there is an enemy. For some, the enemy is the "other side" who threaten us with nuclear weapons. For some, the enemy is the group on our side who argue that a nuclear build-up is a necessary response. And for some, perhaps the real enemy is our very tendency to create an enemy. We cannot hope to get rid of the enemy. Our psyche needs an enemy. It is magnetically attracted to the destruction that the enemy brings. And of course, identifying oneself as one who fights destruction itself has never succeeded in eradicating destruction. It has only had the effect of bringing the fight into the literal dimension where some other trusty fighter will, no doubt, fight the good fight as your enemy. However, perhaps by grasping the pattern of the battle we can attain the wisdom of Pogo who said, "We have met the enemy and they is us," which is not to say that such con- sciousness will stop the battle or the final conflagration. But perhaps the fuel of the fire will be the forms of our experience, rather than human flesh. REFERENCES Adams, V. A. (1982). Mommy and I are One. Psychol. Today 16(5): 24-36. Benson, P. L. (1981).
