This is also the case in Septuagint Proverbs, but the LXX expands her ability to function as a metaphor for abstract ideas. 4Q184 creatively reworks the Strange Woman to describe a female who functions as a general symbol for wickedness. She is associated with Sheol to a greater extent than any figure from Proverbs. In their reception of the Strange Woman, the Septuagint and 4Q184 have interpreta tive traditions in common, or at least understand her in similar ways. Keywords Proverbs, Septuagint Proverbs, the Strange Woman, 4Q184, Sheol, wisdom literature Introduction In his authoritative Judaism and Hellenism Martin Hengel argues that Sep tuagint Proverbs reconfigures the Strange Woman into a symbol for "for eign wisdom"—that is, she becomes a negatively charged signifier for Hellenistic philosophy.1 He contended further that scholars can "best understand" 4QWiles of the Wicked Woman (4Q184) in light of the Strange Woman of LXX Proverbs. 4Q184 draws on the account of this female in Proverbs to describe a woman who is vividly associated with " Μ.

The view that the LXX Strange Woman symbolizes "foreign wisdom" has been vigorously defended by Johann Cook. For him she is a cipher for "'foreign,' 'dangerous' wis dom, namely Greek philosophy from the Hellenistic period."3 Michael Fox has offered a more nuanced view, considering the woman "a multiva lent symbol" that can be applied "to an indefinite variety of inimical reali ties," including Hellenistic mores encountered by Jews in the Diaspora.4 21 4Q184 was officially published in J. M. Allegro, Qumran Cave 4.1 (4Q158-4Q186) (DJD 5; Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1968), 82-85. This edition is read in conjunction with J. Strugnell, "Notes en marge du volume V des 'Discoveries in the Judaean Desert of Jor dan,'" RevQ 7/26 (1970): 163-276 (esp. 263-68). There is a revised edition of DJD 5 in preparation by M. J. Bernstein and G. J. Brooke (DJD 5a). Earlier in the study of 4Q184, Carmignac and others understood the female as a veiled reference to a group or figure that rivaled the Dead Sea sect. Today commentators recognize that there are no explicit markers in the text that it was composed by members of this movement, although this possibility cannot be discounted.

Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 20-45 Neither Fox nor Cook engage Hengel s claim that 4Q184 should be under stood in light of the Strange Woman of LXX Proverbs.5 In this article I examine the Strange Woman of Proverbs, in both the MT and LXX, and the woman of 4Q184. The Strange Woman embodies attitudes rejected by the book of Proverbs. While she can be understood in numerous ways, she represents a type of immoral female whom male addressees could encounter in their daily lives but should avoid. Both LXX Proverbs and 4Q184 expand the Strange Woman's ability to function as a metaphor for abstract ideas and ways of life to be shunned. At times it is not clear that these two texts are describing a "real woman." A trend towards allegorical and symbolic interpretations of the Strange Woman is evident in later periods of Judaism and Christianity.6 4Q184 and LXX Proverbs help fill out an earlier stage of this development. LXX Proverbs Discerning differences between a verse in the LXX and its counterpart in the MT is often less difficult than explaining them. One has to decide if variants should be attributed to the technique of the LXX translator or if they should be understood as translations of a Vorlage that does not match exactly the MT.7 Different readings can also be a product not of the initial 5, Fox, Proverbs 1-9, 254. Jones, "Wisdoms Pedagogy," examines Prov 7 and 4Q184 but the Septuagint is not a main focus of his study. ® In rabbinic tradition she has been understood as a reference to Christianity (e.g., b. 'Abod.'Abod. Zar. 17a). Origen and other patristic figures associate the woman with Greek learn ing. See, for example, Clement, Strom. 15, 29, on Prov 5:3; Origen, c. Cels. IV, 44.

The fragments of Proverbs from Qumran (4Q102-103) are brief and preserve no extensive passages that discuss the Strange Woman.8 Commentators have stressed the relative freedom of LXX Proverbs as a translation.9 It is often somewhat loose in its rendering of specific words but generally reproduces the basic sense of its parent Hebrew text, as of of of the International Organization for Septuagint and Cognate Studies, Leiden 2004 (ed.

Fox, Proverbs 1-9, 361, understands LXX Prov erbs as "a fairly faithful rendering of a Hebrew original" that "can be used as evidence for textual variants." Cook, by contrast, understands LXX Proverbs to have expanded and altered its Vorlage to such an extent that the recovery of a Hebrew original is "virtually impossible." It seems to me difficult, however, to assess the range and scope of LXX Prov's expansions without at least implicitly having an understanding of its parent text. See ].

In the Hebrew Prov 28:20 teaches that the one who wants to become rich will not go unpunished but in the LXX version the wicked will not go unpunished.

One example he gives of a difference attributable to the compilers of LXX Proverbs is Prov 13:9, which is expanded (13:9a) by material that may be derived from LXX Ps 36:21 (MT 37:21).

Goff/ Journal for the Study ofJudaism 39 (2008) 20-45 25 He asserts, as do most commentators, that most of the variants in LXX Proverbs should be placed in the former category.15 The Strange Woman (MT) The core passages traditionally associated with the Strange Woman are Prov 2:16-22; 5:1-14; 6:20-35 and 7:5-27 (cf. 22:14; 23:27).16 In some texts she emerges as a distinct literary character; others warn more gener ally of women who are dangerous and promiscuous. Only Prov 2:16 and 7:5 attest the phrase אטה זרה (cf. Sir 9:3). These verses occur in pericopes that describe a female who ensnares men with seductive speech (cf. 7:21) and takes them on a path that leads to death (2:18; 7:27).17 Proverbs 2:16 also refers to her as a נכריה, or foreign woman (cf. 5:20; 6:24). Proverbs 5 understood as differences in LXX Proverbs attributable to its Vorlage. The material that cor responds to MT Prov 24:23-24 is between Prov 30:14-15 in the Septuagint and chapters 25-29 are between Prov 31:9-10, and there are many transpositions and omissions in LXX Prov 15, 16 and 20 when compared to the MT. 151 Τον, "Recensional Differences," 44, writes "most scholars agree that the translation [of Proverbs into Greek] contains much evidence of contextual exegesis, in both minor and major details." Fox, Proverbs 1-9, 361, is critical of the term "exegetical" as too vague to describe variations in LXX Prov when compared to the MT. He contends that this descrip tion should be restricted "to describe words, phrases, or lines intended to explain another element in the translation." This qualification makes sense, but Tov's basic point still stands—there are differences in LXX Proverbs that should not be ascribed to a Vorlage that varies from the MT. Cook's emphasis on the creativity of the compilers of LXX Proverbs is a maximalist variant of the consensus view that the book is a rather free translation. For example, he considers several of the differences in order in Prov 24-31 as intentional rear rangements of material.

Goff/Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 20-45 mentions a זרה whose lips drip sweet words (v. 3; cf. v. 20) and stresses that she represents a path that leads to Sheol (v. 5). The "strangeness" of the woman has been interpreted in various ways. A prominent view is that the adjective זרה refers to her ethnic status. Claudia Camp understands the Strange Woman as a trickster figure against the backdrop of the marriage policies of Ezra and Nehemiah, a conceit used to enforce endogamy and patriarchal control.18 In earlier scholarship G. Bostrom presented her as a foreign woman associated with a pagan love goddess.19 An ethnic interpretation of זרה is not impossible and compati ble with the common biblical trope that non-Israelite women lead Israelite men astray towards other religions. But the Strange Woman is never explic itly identified with a specific ethnic group or a foreign cult.20 It is clear, however, that she is married. She says so to the man she propositions (7:19). The warnings about her in Prov 5:1-6 are followed by an exhorta tion that one should "rejoice in the wife of your youth" (v. 17). By contrast, the wicked female of Prov 2:16 "forsakes the partner of her youth and forgets her sacred covenant" (v. 17), a term that in context probably refers to marriage.21 The words זר and נכרי do not necessarily refer to people who are ethni cally foreign, although they can have this meaning (e.g., Judg 19:12; 181 Camp, Wise, Strange and Holy, 323-44; J. Blenkinsopp, "The Social Context of the Outsider Women' in Proverbs 1-9," Bib 72 (1991): 457-73 191 G. Bostrom, Proverbiastudien: Die Weisheit und das fremde Weib in Spriiche 1-9 (Lund: C. W. K. Gleerup, 1935). LXX Proverbs was important for his understanding of the Strange Woman. LXX Prov 7:6 presents her looking out the window (παρακΰπτουσα), whereas the MT is ambiguous on this point, with some core terms in the first person. In the Hebrew text the speaker could be the instructor figure who watches the scene unfold between the Strange Woman and the male. Bostrom appealed to a cult that existed in Phoenicia and Cyprus, Aphrodite παρακΰπτουσα. In this cult Aphrodite, identified with Astarte, is depicted as looking out of a window. He argued that the LXX contained the original read ing of Prov 7:6, which was emended to avoid any reference to this Aphrodite cult. This view, though influential, has not fared well in recent scholarship. See McKane, Proverbs, 33334; R. J. Clifford, Proverbs (OTL; Louisville: Westminster John Knox, 1999), 85; Fox, Proverbs Proverbs 1-9, 404; J. B. Burns, "Proverbs 7:6-27: Vignettes from the Cycle of Astarte and Adonis," SJOT 9 (1995): 20-36; R. H. O'Connell, "Proverbs VII 6-17: A Case of Fatal Deception in a 'Woman and the Window' Type-Scene," VT41 (1991): 235-41. 201 She is associated with the Yahwistic sacrificial cult (Prov 7:14). 21) Fox, Proverbs 1-9, 120. The Qumran wisdom text 4QInstruction urges, in a discussion of marriage, a woman not to forget her holy covenant (4Q415 2 ii 4). See also Kaminka, "Septuaginta und Targum zu Proverbia," 179.</page><page sequence="8">Μ. Goff/Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 20-45 27 IsaIsa 1:7). The terms can more generally signify individuals who are not of one's own household. The discussion of levirate marriage in Deut 25 stresses that the wife of a deceased man shall not marry an איש זר (v. 5; cf. 1 Kgs 3:18; Job 19:27). A male from another ethnic group would be a "strange man," but the point of the verse is that any person beyond the household of the deceased is not a suitable candidate for levirate mar riage.22 The emphasis on the marital status of the Strange Woman suggests that her "strangeness" primarily signifies that she is not known or familiar. She is not the male addressees wife.23 The most elaborate portrait of the Strange Woman is in Prov 7:3-27. This passage is prefaced by a discussion of the dangers of adultery in 6:20 35. The woman lurks in public places in an urban setting, looking for unsuspecting men to seduce.24 Lurking at night, she seizes a young man and kisses him (7:12). She makes a bold proposal: I have decked my couch with coverings, colored spreads of Egyptian linen; I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. Come, let us take our fill of love until morning, let us delight ourselves with love. (7:16-18) This is a ribald example of her seductive speech. She is an overtly sexual figure. This pericope has echoes in the Song of Songs (e.g., 4:14). Her speech is not false or deceitful. The text does not dispute that the man 22זר י and נכרי occur in a psalmist's lament that he has become estranged from his family: "I have become a stranger (מוזר) to my kindred, an alien (נכרי) to my mothers children" (Ps 69:9 [Eng. 8]; cf. Prov 27:2). 231 Fox, Proverbs 1-9, 262. See also Maier, "Die 'fremde Frau,'" 254. 241 She has been understood as a prostitute. Van der Toorn, for example, argues that she is not a common prostitute but, since she currently lacks the necessary funds to fulfill her vows (cf. 7:14), she turns to prostitution. It is never stated, however, that she charges the man for sex. According to the NRSV, Prov 7:10 describes the woman "decked out like a prostitute" (טית זונה)■ The term זונה can refer to women who provide sex in exchange for some form of payment, as in the case of Tamar (Gen 38:15-16). The word can be more broadly applied to females who are for various reasons not considered suitable or ideal as wives. The rabbis debated the exact nuance of the word (e.g., b. Yebam. 61b). In any case, the Strange Woman is married (Prov 7:19) and the expensive trappings of her chambers suggest she is not in financial need (v. 16). She does not earn a living by charging men for sex. See K. van der Toorn, "Female Prostitution in Payment of Vows in Ancient Israel," JBL 108 (1989): 193-205 (esp. 199); D. A. Garrett, "Votive Prostitution Again: A Comparison of Proverbs 7:13-14 and 21:28-29," JBL 109 (1990): 681-82; E. A. Goodfriend, "Prostitu tion (OT)," AS£&gt; 5:505-10.</page><page sequence="9">28 Μ. Goff/Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 20-45 would enjoy spending the night with this woman, and he is easily per suaded by her (7:21).25 The book teaches that the physical pleasures she offers are short lived and that such a woman is ultimately dangerous and destructive: "in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword" (5:4).26 The portrait of the Strange Woman helps teach young men to resist adultery and temptation, and that marriage is the proper sphere for sexual activity. Woman Folly (or "foolish woman"; אשת כסילוח), who only appears in Prov 9:13-18, is not exactly the same character as the Strange Woman. The former is a personification of folly who is dualistically opposed to Woman Wisdom. The Strange Woman is more directly opposed to the wife of the envisioned male addressee than personified wisdom. Yet the descriptions of the Strange Woman and Woman Folly overlap and the distinctions between them can become ambiguous.27 Both females are situated in urban contexts (7:12; 9:14) and seek out the simple and dim-witted (7:7; 9:16). Unlike the Strange Woman, Woman Folly does not lurk through city streets or lay in ambush for her victims. She calls out to passers-by and invites them to her house, as does Woman Wisdom (8:5; 9:5; w. 15-16). The foolish woman does not utter any explicitly sexual statements akin to Prov 7:16-18 but the one proverb with which she is associated endorses illicit pleasures: "Stolen water is sweet and bread eaten in secret is pleasant" (cf. 30:20). Personification and the Strange Woman: "Evil Counsel" and the Underworld Most of the Strange Woman texts in the LXX are not radically different from their MT counterparts.

As discussed below, the accounts of these women overlap more in the LXX than in the MT. Woman Wisdom and Woman Folly, while they have charac teristics like some of the other women of Proverbs, function ultimately not as depictions of actual women but allegories for, respectively, wisdom and folly. The figure of Woman Folly suggests a gradual development from literary constructions of specific types of "real"</page><page sequence="10">Μ. Goff/Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 20-45 29 exception. Unlike the MT, LXX Prov 2:16 never mentions a woman. Referring to the crooked ways of the wicked of the previous verse, v. 16 states that they are bent "in order to keep you far from the straight way and make the righteous judgment strange (άλλότριον)." Commentators rea sonably understand the differences in this verse, and those of w. 16-18 in general, as interpretative innovations.28 In the Septuagint, v. 16 does not introduce a new topic (the Strange Woman) but continues the teaching of the preceding verses about avoiding the wrong path. A statement about a promiscuous woman and adultery is transformed into a ethical statement about avoiding the wrong path. Prov 2:17 exhibits a similar tendency towards general, moral language: העזבח אלוף נעוריה ואת־ברית אלהיה שכחה υιέ, μή σε καταλάβη κακή βουλή ή άπολείπουσα διδασκαλίαν νεότητος και διαθηκην θείαν έπιλελησμένη Ο son, let not evil counsel over take you, which has abandoned the teaching of youth and for gotten the divine covenant. In the Hebrew this verse elaborates the wicked nature of the woman of v. 16. The Greek discusses "evil counsel." Cook, following Hengel, under stands κακή βουλή as a reference to Hellenistic philosophy.29 Cook also interprets "evil counsel" as a reference to the Jewish concept of the evil yetzer,yetzer, יצר הרע. "Evil counsel" is at best an indirect allusion to any sort of foreign wisdom. LXX Prov 2:17 could have emphasized the foreignness of the "counsel" but it does not. The evil yetzer is generally presented in who forsakes the partner of her youth and forgets her divine covenant women, such as the Strange Woman, towards females who symbolize abstract ideas. LXX Proverbs and 4Q184 can be understood as continuing this development. Fox, "The Strange Woman," 42, contends that the additions of Prov 9:12 and 18 (discussed below) "seem to be basing themselves upon an existing allegorization of the Strange Woman." See further Clifford, Proverbs, 27, 48; McKane, Proverbs, 367. 281 Fox, Proverbs 1-9, 374-75; Cook, The Septuagint of Proverbs, 132, 141. 291 Cook, The Septuagint of Proverbs, 138; Hengel, Judaism and Hellenism, 1:155.</page><page sequence="11">30 Μ. Goff/Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 20-45 Jewish tradition as an innate disposition towards immoral types of behav ior. There is not a lot of evidence for understanding the yetzer as a desig nation for foreign ideas Jews should avoid. Fox has argued that κακή βουλή refers to advice and urgings that would be detrimental in contrast to the "good counsel" (βουλή καλή//Π0Γ0) of Prov 2:11 that provides protection.30 The men of Prov 1:11-14 offer an example of "evil counsel" when they propose that one should join them in a plot to ambush the innocent. But LXX Prov 2:16-18 does not simply replace the Strange Woman with general ethical language. V. 17 personifies "evil counsel." It has itself forgotten the divine covenant, implying a degree of anthropomorphism. While in the MT of this verse the word "covenant" probably refers to mar riage, this cannot be the case in the LXX since Prov 2:16 does not mention a woman. In the Septuagint version "covenant" is reasonably read as an allusion to the Torah, since it and "the teaching of youth" are distinguished from "evil counsel."31 The personification of "evil counsel" is elaborated in verse 18. MT Prov 2:18 states that the woman leads people to death: "For her way leads down to death and her paths to the shades" (NRSV). This translation emends ביתה ("her house") to נתיבתה ("her way").32 But the term "house" is in the LXX version: "For she has placed (εθετο) her house (τον οίκον αυτής) beside death and her courses beside Hades with the earth-born."33 "Hades" is in parallelism with "death" and has no direct counterpart in the MT. The word is an addition that emphasizes the theme 301 Fox, "The Strange Woman," 33. Cook understands the good and bad forms of counsel in LXX Prov 2 as allusions to the good and evil yetzers. See also his "The Origin of the Tradition of the יצר הטוב and 80-91 :(2007) 38 /5/",יצר הרע. 311 Cook, The Septuagint of Proverbs, 329. See the discussion of LXX Prov 9:10 below. The LXX probably understands the word the MT vocalizes as אלוף ("companion") as a form of the verb אלף, which in the Piel means "to teach." See Fox, "The Strange Woman," 34. 321 One rationale for the emendation is that the image of the house "inclining" towards death is awkward. Also the subject is masculine ("house") and that the verb is feminine (שחה),שחה, from the root שוח). The change produces a parallelism of path terminology. See Fox, Proverbs Proverbs 1-9, 121; idem, "The Strange Woman," 34; Cook, "464 ",אטה זרה; McKane, Proverbs,Proverbs, 213. 33, This suggests that "her house" should not be emended in MT Prov 2:18, despite the difficulties this causes. As discussed below, the woman of 4Q184 also has a house associated with Sheol. Fox, Proverbs 1-9, 375, has suggested that εθετο is a translation of שחה, rather than MT s שחה.

The "earth-born" (των γηγενών) corresponds to the word רפאים (cf. 9:18).34 To whose house does the verse refer? In the MT it is the Strange Worn an's. In the Septuagint the likely antecedent is "evil counsel." The wicked female is not simply written out of LXX Prov 2. She is sublimated into an abstract idea, "evil counsel." This immoral quality is personified, although not to the extent that one finds with Woman Wisdom in Prov 1 or 8. The personification of "evil counsel" is plausibly understood as an interpretive and allegorical expansion of a Vorlage that read אשד! זרה in Prov 2:16, as does the MT. The LXX translator presumably understood her core value not as representing a real and wicked woman but in her function as a sym bol for ideas and attitudes that are immoral. There is a similar process at work in LXX Prov 5:5. The MT states "Her feet go down to death (רנליה יריות מות); her steps follow the path to Sheol." The LXX version reads: "For the feet of folly (αφροσύνης) bring down those who are intimate (χρωμένους) with her with death into Hades."35 The MT does not mention "feet of folly." This section of chapter 5, in the LXX and MT, warns of a dangerous woman who is enticing (e.g., v. 3). This suggests that "folly" is an interpretative addition. LXX Prov 5:5 reconfigures the Strange Woman into an allegory for undesirable qualities. In this chapter descriptions of a promiscuous female are side by side with a depiction of her as personified folly.36 The House of "Evil Counsel" "Evil counsel" is not only given anthropomorphic attributes. Its house is located in the underworld. This claim is never made about the Strange Woman in the MT. LXX Prov 2:18 states the house of "evil counsel" is "beside" (παρά plus dative) Death and Hades. The preposition corresponds to אל, which conveys the sense that her house inclines to death, a reference to the netherworld, παρά with the accusative typically means that some thing has been moved beside something else, whereas with the dative the 34י For more on this verse see M. J. Goff, "Subterranean Giants and Mortals: The 'Earth born of LXX Proverbs,"(forthcoming). 351 The verb χράω can refer to sexual intercourse (e.g., Herodotus 2.181), but it could also have the more innocuous meaning of "treat" or "deal with." 361 Fox, "The Strange Woman," 35.</page><page sequence="13">32 Μ. Goff/Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 20-45 preposition often signifies rest at the side of a person or thing.37 LXX Job 10:12 uses the combination of the verb τίθημι with παρά plus the dative (as does Prov 2:18) to refer to things that are with Job: "Life and mercy you have given me (εθου παρ' έμοι)."38 In the story of Jacob and Rebecca steal ing the birthright from Esau, Rebecca takes Esau's "clothing" (στολήν) which was "with her (παρ* αύτη//אתה) in the house" (Gen 27:15). In this verse the preposition signifies that the clothing is close at hand. These examples suggest that in LXX Prov 2:18 the emphasis is not on movement (towards Hades) but location (beside or before Hades). The verse does not depict the house of a woman who flouts the bonds of matrimony. LXX Prov 2:18 contains a more metaphorical and mythological image—the house of "evil counsel" at the opening of the gates of Sheol.39 LXX Prov 5:5 asserts that the "feet of folly" descend to the underworld. Both pericopes associate the personification of an abstract entity as a woman with Sheol. The Woman of 4Q184 The theme of the netherworld raises the relevance of 4Q184 for LXX Prov erbs. The dangers of the woman of 4Q184 are summarized in line 8 of fragment 1: "She is the beginning of all the ways of iniquity" (!היאה ראטיר 40.(כול דרכי עול It is not clear that she should be understood as an allegory of a specific abstract idea. She is never explicitly identified as the embodi ment of "folly," "evil counsel" or the like.41 She represents wicked ways of living that lead to the netherworld.42 What constitutes wicked behavior, other than following her, is left relatively open.43 37י In the Septuagint παρά is not the most common translation of אל. The preposition is translated a number of ways. Sometimes πρός is used, as is εις. For an example of the for mer, see LXX Num 22:8, for the latter, LXX Exod 33:8.

LXX Exod 40:6, 29; 1 Sam 9:24; Jer 9:10. 39) McKane, Proverbs, 287, understands the reference to death in MT Prov 2:18a as an allusion to the Canaanite deity Mot, "whose gaping throat is the gateway to Sheol." This interpretation is easier to sustain with the LXX version of the verse than the MT. 40) Aubin, "She is the beginning," 5. 411 Harrington, Wisdom Texts, 35, understands the figure as an elaboration ofWoman Folly.

In the Psalms the word דומה signifies the underworld (94:17; 115:17).44 Her beds are "couches of the pit (4) "(שחחQ184 1 5). The composition is rich in "pit" terms such as שחח, ΓΤ®, שוחה and 17 ,11 ,6 ,5 ,3 .11) בור). The darkness associated with the Strange Woman in Proverbs is reinterpreted as descrip tions of the netherworld.45 Baumgarten has argued that the female of 4Q184 is "a seductive demoness who resides in the darkness of the neth erworld but issues forth stealthily to lure the unsuspecting to apostasy and perdition."46 He likens her to the demon Lilith of later Jewish tradition. He depicts the woman of 4Q184 as having wings and horns.47 Since she is a denizen of the netherworld one can easily imagine her as a demon. But she is never explicitly described as such a creature.48 Moreover, it does not make sense to envision her as a demon occasionally entering the human realm. 4Q184 1 13 states that she lures victims in part by raising 44) DJD 5, 84; Carmignac, "Poeme allegorique," 367. 451 This can be illustrated by comparing Prov 7:9 and 4Q184 1 6. In Prov 7 the woman lurks through city streets at night. To convey the darkness in which she operates v. 9 reads "in the twilight, in the evening, at the time of night and darkness (באישון לילה ואפלה)." 4Q184 1 6 includes a phrase that can be transcribed [באישנ״ ליל[ה {DJD 5, 82). These words refer to the darkness of Sheol. Lines 6-7 state that she dwells in "foundations of gloom" (מוסדי אפלות) and that her tents of silence are among the eternal flames. Strugnell, "Notes en marge," 265, suggests transcribing באושני in 4Q184 1 6, producing "in the foundations of night are her tents." Nebe, "Lexikalische Bemerkugen," 103, advocates this transcription and recommends that this (and Prov 20:20) be used to emend the word אישון of Prov 7:9 to אישון■ He translates the key phrase of the verse as "in der tiefsten Nacht und Finsternis." Such an emendation is plausible but would produce a phrase that is not all that different in meaning from the MT's אישון .כאישון לילה ואפלה signifies the pupil of the eye (cf. v. 2) and conveys that she is outside during the darkest part of the night (as the pupil is the darkest part of the eye). See Fox, Proverbs 1-9, 239, 243; McKane, Proverbs, 336. For באישון לילה the LXX reads ησυχία νυκτερινή ("nocturnal silence"). LXX Proverbs 7 emphasizes the silence of the streets at night. 4Q184 1 7 uses language of silence to describe the female's residence in Sheol ("tents of silence"). 461 Baumgarten, "On the Nature of the Seductress," 143. 47) Ibid., 139-40. He also suggests that she may be flying in the night. 481 Baumgarten contends that the word כנפיה of 4Q184 1 4 should be translated "her wings." The term occurs in the context of a sequence of phrases describing her "garments" (1. 4) and "coverings" (1. 5). This suggests that כנפיה refers to some sort of clothing rather than wings. The claim that she has horns is based on the word 4 .1) תועפות). Allegro, DJD 5,5, 83, translates this as part of the phrase "the depths of the night." His understanding of the term is supported by Job 11:17, in which תעפה refers to darkness. The lines of this</page><page sequence="15">34 Μ. Goff/Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 20-45 her eyelids "wantonly." How many men would this attract if she has horns and wings?49 While several texts situate the woman in Sheol, her location is ambigu ous. This is evident in the description of her house. Part of line 10 of frag ment l reads: [שעריה שערי מות בפתח כיחה חצעד שאו[ל. Strugnell translates "her gates are the gates of Death, at the door of her house Sheo[l] stands."50 This rendering of the line needs modification. The verb צעד does not mean "to stand" but "to stride" or "to march." It describes the man walking past the house of the Strange Woman in Prov 7:8b (51.(ודרך כיתה יצעד It is also not clear what the subject of תצעד is.52 One could render the phrase תצעד טאו[ל] as "Sheo[l] marches," but this would go against the thrust of the text (and Prov 1-9), in which the woman leads people to Sheol.53 She entices men and leads them to sin so that they will walk "in the ways of the pit" (4) (בדרכי שוחהQ184 1 17). Line 11 states that "all who inherit her descend to the pit (ירדו שחת)." The woman of 4Q184 encourages people to sin, and is thus to at least some extent situated in the human realm. She is associ ated in 1.12 with "city squares" (רחובות עיר) and "town gates" (שערי קריות). If the woman were in the netherworld, she would not be at the "begin ning" of ways of sinful living, as line 8 states. Sheol is the terminus of such a path. The key phrase of line 10 should thus be understood as תצעד שאו[לה], "she proceeds [towards] Sheo[l]."54 section of 4Q184 1 repeatedly mention darkness using various terms (11. 4-6), favoring Allegros understanding of the term. 49י Below I examine the theme of eroticism with regard to the female of 4Q184 and the LXX Strange Woman. 501501 Strugnell, "Notes en marge," 267, argues that this understanding of the verse is sup ported by Prov 2:18. Allegro, DJD 5, 83, renders the last part of the line "in the opening of her house it stalks. To Sheol..." See also Baumgarten, "On the Nature of the Seductress," 138; Carmignac, "Poeme allegorique," 369. 511 In the LXX "her house" is in the plural, as in Prov 5:8. 521 There is more space between הצעד and [טא1[ל than one expects. Strugnell, "Notes en marge," 267, considers this accidental. See also Carmignac, "Poeme allegorique," 369· 531 This reading would assume that "Sheol" is a feminine word. The word takes a masculine adjective in Job 26:6 but is elsewhere feminine, as in, for example, Isa 14:9. DSSSE, 1:377, translates the relevant section of 4Q184 1 10 as "in the entrance to her house Sheo[l] proceeds." 54) Allegro, DJD 5, 83, transcribes [טאו[לה. This is the last word of line 11. The beginning of line 12 has not survived well and has been reconstructed as כ[ו]ל [ באיה בל ] יטובון ("a[l]l [who go to her will not] return") (cf. Prov 2:19).

GojfΊ Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 20-45 35 The "double" location of the woman of 4Q184 echoes that of Woman Folly. 4Q184 1 10 states that her gates are "gates of death" and "at the door of her house (ביחה ΠΓ0Ζ1) she proceeds [towards] Sheo[l]."55 פחח כיתה is admittedly common language but occurs in Prov 9:14 with regard to the house of Woman Folly (cf. 5:8).56 She is explicitly situated in the public sphere, as is the Strange Woman. But Woman Folly does not simply lead people to the netherworld. Her guests are already there. Those who decide to follow her "do not know that the dead are there, that her guests are in the depths of Sheol" (9:18). At a literal level they cannot be in her house, which is in a town (9:14), and in Sheol. The operating metaphor is that the men who are in the foolish woman's house, and thus on a path that leads to death, are already in Sheol. Proverbs 9:18 can be understood as a poetic elaboration of 2:18, 5:5 and 7:27, which state that the Strange Woman leads men to Sheol.57 The female of 4Q184, and the association of her residence with both the human realm and Sheol, can be analogously under stood as an intensification of the claims of Prov 2:18 that the Strange Woman's house "inclines" to Sheol and that she brings men there. One can posit that 4Q184 envisions both a woman who is an evil dweller of the underworld and a wicked human female who is a worldly embodiment of this figure from the underworld. The mindset would be similar to the "two-storey" reality that is common in early Jewish apoca lypses such as Daniel, in which aspects of the human world have counter parts in the supernatural realm.58 However, the woman's location in Sheol should not be taken literally but as a metaphor for her wickedness. The Strange Woman represents "real" women who are immoral. 4Q184 draws on the portrait of this figure in Proverbs. This Qumran text takes a great deal of poetic license in its interpretation.59 The main function of 4Q184 551 In the Psalms the "gates of death" refers to Sheol: "you are the one who lifts me up from the gates of death (משערי מות)" (Ps 9:13 [Heb. v. 14]; cf. 107:18; Job 38:17). The image of the gates of death is a metaphor in the Hodayot that expresses the grief of the speaker. 1QH' XIV 25-26 (ed. Sukenik VI 22-23) reads in part: "I [have become] like a sailor in a ship in the raging seas: their waves and all their breakers roar over me... the deep thunders at my sigh, [my] so[ul nears] the gates of death (שערי מוח)" (cf. Wis 16:13; 3 Macc 5:51; 6:31). 561 In Prov 9:14 the phrase is accompanied by a lamed. 571 Clifford, Proverbs, 107; McKane, Proverbs, 367. 58, J. J. Collins, The Apocalyptic Imagination (2nd ed.; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1998 [orig. pub., 1984]), 103. 591 The understanding of death in 4Q184 is also different from that of Proverbs since the</page><page sequence="17">36 Μ. Goff/Journal for the Study offudaism 39 (2008) 20-45 is not to teach men about the kind of woman to avoid. Rather the work describes a female who represents ways of living that lead to Sheol. The certainty of this result is poetically embellished by expansion of the theme of the underworld. The woman of 4Q184 sometimes appears to be a human female and sometimes a dweller of Sheol. Conveying her evil nature is more important to the author than consistency. Sexuality and Speech LXX Proverbs does not consistently recast the Strange Woman into an allegory or negatively charged symbol. Throughout much of the book she is depicted as an "actual" immoral woman. The invitation to the young man to have sex in Prov 7:16-18 is in the LXX.60 In the Greek version of Prov 7:10 she has the appearance of a loose woman (πορνικον), as in the Hebrew.61 LXX Prov 5:3 reads "Do not pay attention to an evil woman (φαύλτ! γυναικί) for honey trickles from the lips of a loose woman (γυναικός πόρνης), who for a time anoints your throat." The basic point of Prov 5:7 14 in both the Hebrew and Greek is to avoid such a female. former implies that the wicked are punished after death in Sheol. The woman has "no inheritance among all those who shine brightly (4) "(מאיר״ ענהQ184 1 7-8). The fact that the woman has nothing to do with such people implies that the virtuous do not go to Sheol. "Those who shine brightly" is reasonably understood as an allusion to some form of blessed afterlife for the righteous, not unlike Dan 12:3 and 1 En. 104:2-6. It is never stated explicitly but 4Q184 probably operates with the view that the wicked receive some kind of punishment after death in Sheol. The netherworld contains "eternal flames" (מוקדי עולם), a motif elsewhere in early Jewish literature associated with postmortem punishment (4Q184 1 7; cf. 1QSIV 13; lQpHabX5). See GofF, Discerning Wisdom, 115; Harrington, Wisdom Texts,Texts, 33. 601 In MT Prov 7:18 she asks "let us drink in our fill of love" (נחה דדים) and "let us delight ourselves with love (נחעלסה באהבים)." The LXX reads "let us enjoy love" (άπολαύσωμεν φιλίας) and "let us wallow in love" (έγκυλισθώμεν ερωτι). As Fox, Proverbs 1-9, 406, observes, the verb έγκυλίομαι can signify rolling which, given the context, probably has sexual nuances. In the Hebrew the woman's invitation includes a different physical image of "drinking in" her love. In different ways MT and LXX Prov 7:18 depict the woman as an unapologetically erotic figure. 611 The word πορνικός and its related terms, like זונה, can refer to a woman who charges money for sex or more broadly to women who are sexually immoral. The MT of this verse has the unusual phrase נצרת לב which is often translated "wily of heart" (lit. "guarded of heart"), referring to the woman. In the LXX she "makes the hearts of youths fly away." This emphasizes not the deceitful nature of the woman but the effect she has on men. This</page><page sequence="18">Μ. Goff/ Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 20-45 37 There are also erotic aspects to the woman of 4Q184. Like the Strange Woman, the female of this Qumran text lurks in public places looking for men to ensnare. Lines 11-12 of fragment 1 read: "She lies in ambush (תארוב) in secret places... in the squares of the city she veils herself, and in the gates of the town she sets herself up."62 The word תארוב is used to describe the Strange Woman in Prov 7:12. 4Q184 1 describes a female looking for a man: "her eyes glance here and there and she raises her eyelids wantonly (בפחז) to spo[t a] righteous [m]an and overtake him" (11. 13-14). Proverbs 6:25 warns a male addressee not to be enticed by a woman's eye lids (cf. Sir 9:7-8). The official edition of 4Q184, prepared by John Allegro, presents the female in starkly sexual terms. In his edition line 3 of fragment 1 reads "In perversion they seized the fouled (organs) of passion, they descended to the pit of her legs to act wickedly."63 The first letter of the first line is a he, from which he reconstructs ד1זונ]ה]. He translated this "[the harjlot." If הזוב] ה[הזוב] ה] were the correct reconstruction, traces of the ligature of the letter nun nun would be visible. Allegro's edition is excessively sexualized.64 The female of 4Q184 is not as erotic as the Strange Woman in both her MT and LXX portraits.65 This Qumran text never reproduces the sexual invita don of Prov 7:16-18. The woman of 4Q184 never kisses a man. The Strange Woman does in both the MT and LXX (Prov 7:13; נטקה// έφίλησεν). She alluringly states that she has prepared her bed (ערטי) with fine linens and her couch (משכבי) with fragrant spices (w. 16-17). The female of 4Q184 1, by contrast, has "couches of darkness" (מטבבי חושך) expression is probably an effort on the part of the translator to make sense of an obscure Hebrew phrase. 621 This text may continue with erotic language. 4Q184 1 12 ends with the expression "without rest[ing]." The next line begins ]מה. Strugnell, "Notes en marge," 265, suggests reconstructing either [מה[זנות חסיד ("from perpetual fornication") or [ΎΉΠ מה[לכת ("from perpetual walking"). He prefers the former (ibid., 267) but scholars have used both options. See Aubin, "She is the beginning," 6; Harrington, Wisdom Texts, 32.1 favor "from perpetual walking" because the expression comes in the context of the woman moving throughout a city. The Strange Woman is also depicted as on the move (Prov 7:11). The proper reading can not be restored conclusively. See Strugnell, "Notes en marge," 267; Carmignac, "Poeme allegorique," 370. 631631 DJD5, 82-83. 641 Strugnell, "Notes en marge," 264. He understands this passage from 4Q184 1 3 as "[her eyes] are defiled with iniquity, her hands descend to the pit, her feet go down to act wick edly."

The speech of the female of 4Q184 is less seductive than that of the MT Strange Woman. 4Q184 never depicts its female character speaking but one gets an impression of her speech. The words of the Strange Woman are described as "smooth" with forms of the word חלק. The term is also applied to the female of 4Q184. The last legible expression of fragment 1 describes its central character as wanting "to speak smooth words to [all] the sons of man" (66.(17 .1) (לפתוח בחלקוח[ כל] כני א~ם Several commentators under stand this as an attempt at seduction.67 She does attract people to a sinful way of life. But portraying her as a sexual and seductive figure is not a main interest of the text. The expression "sons of man" may refer to humankind in general, not just males, although she is depicted as leading a "righteous ma[n]" and a "[no]ble man" astray (11. 13-14). The first extant portion of fragment 1 also describes the woman's speech: [From] her [mouth] she brings forth vanity... she constantly seeks [to] make [her] words smooth (ל]שמן]). Mockingly she says smo[ot]h things together with speaking scornfully (קלס תחל[,] ק ולהל־ץ יחד) with l[ips] of iniquity (68.(11.1-2) (בט[פתי] עול Her words are "smooth" but also negative and disdainful. They are much less enticing than the speech of the Strange Woman. One wonders how many "righteous" and "noble" men would be seduced by the female's scornful words. In the Septuagint the Strange Woman utters erotic speech. LXX Prov 5:3, for example, depicts honey trickling from her lips of a loose woman, which can be understood as a reference to seductive speech. But this theme is muted when compared to the MT. Proverbs 2:16 and 7:5 stress that her words are "smooth," using the phrase אמריה החליקה.

Goff/ Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 20-45 39 discusses a woman's speech that is tempting or dangerous.69 LXX Prov 7:5 mentions a wicked female in the expression άπό γυναικός αλλότριας και πονηρ&amp;ς ("from a strange and wicked woman"). She speaks to a man with "words for favor" (λόγοις τοις προς χάριν).70 This language contains no "literal" translation of חלק to highlight the smooth and seductive nature of her speech. Proverbs 6:24b urges one to keep "from the smooth tongue of an alien woman" (מחלקת לשון נכריה). The LXX version of the phrase char acterizes her speech as negative rather than seductive: άπό διαβολής γλώσσης άλλοτρίας ("from the slander of the tongue of an alien woman").71 MT Prov 7:21b describes the Strange Woman speaking to the man: "with her smooth talk (בחלק שפתיה) she compels him." The Septuagint presents her speech as dangerous: "and with traps (βρόχοις) from her lips she com pels him." Forms of the word חלק that describe her words in the MT often do not have direct Greek equivalents in LXX Prov 1-9. This may be because the translator did not want to portray "smooth speech" in a negative light.72 These changes are reasonably understood as innovations by the translator rather than a consequence of a Vorlage that differs from the MT. By mak ing the seductive nature of the woman's words less prominent, the Septua gint casts the Strange Woman as a less erotic figure than in the MT. Marriage and Adultery In the Septuagint s presentation of the Strange Woman, as in the masoretic text, the themes of adultery and marriage are significant. In both traditions 691 אמריה החליקה corresponds to δικαίας γνώμης ("righteous judgment"). See Fox, Proverbs 1-9,1-9, 374; Cook, The Septuagint ofProverbs, 131-33; d'Hamonville, Les Proverbes, 171. 701 The MT and DOC convey the same basic idea in Prov 7:5. In both one is to call wisdom his sister in the preceding verse, who will protect him from the woman of v. 5· The phrase άπό γυναικός αλλότριας και πονηράς corresponds to מאטה זרה מנכריה. The athnah under זרה helps produce two parallel statements. נכריה was presumably understood by the LXX as an adjective modifying "woman" rather than a noun in parallelism with זרה. It is possible that זרה and נכריה were reversed in the Vorlage, since αλλότριας corresponds to the former and πονηρ&amp;ς to the latter. "This may, however, not be the case since άλλοτρίαν approxi mates זרה in Prov 5:20 (cf. v. 3). See Fox, Proverbs 1-9, 403; d'Hamonville, Les Proverbes, 200. 711 711 Cook, The Septuagint of Proverbs, 184-86. 721 Fox, Proverbs 1-9, 406, writes "It seems that the translator thought that verbal smooth ness was not an unambiguous indicator of danger and deceit, because mellifluous rhetoric can be a worthy talent."</page><page sequence="21">40 Μ. Goff/ Journalfor the Study ofJudaism 39 (2008) 20-45 her exploits in Prov 7 are prefaced by teachings on adultery (6:20-35). This is quite different from 4Q184, which shows no interest whatsoever in the marital status of its female character. Her temptations are to be resisted and one can infer that this approach should be applied to the advances of married women. But sexual ethics is not an explicit theme. The assessment of the "strangeness" of the LXX Strange Woman depends on the interpretation of the word αλλότριος and its derivatives. Like זר, the word can refer to something that belongs to someone else, including a man's wife, αλλότριος can also signify foreign ethnicity.73 Proverbs 5:20 reads: "Do not be great with another woman (άλλότριαν//ΓΠΓ), nor embrace the arms of one not your own (της μή ιδίας//74".(נכריה Cook understands this verse, and LXX Prov 5 in general, as containing "stern warnings against things foreign," i.e., ethnic foreigners.75 The women that Prov 5:20 recommends to avoid could be of various ethnicities, but the parallelism of άλλότριαν and της μή ιδίας stresses that a man should avoid intimacy with females aside from his wife.76 V. 18 in the LXX, like the MT, exhorts one to "enjoy the woman of your youth."77 MT Prov 6:24a warns a male to stay away from a אשת ךע ("evil woman"). The NRSV, however, translates "wife of another" (cf. v. 29a). This is based on the LXX variant: "to preserve you from a married woman (άπό γυναικός ύπάνδρου)." The translator presumably understood the consonants as רע ("neighbor").78 The problem with the woman in question is not any inherent wickedness but that she is married to another man. She may be a foreigner, since LXX Prov 6:24b can be understood as warning against a "foreign tongue."79 But the essential issue is not her ethnicity but her married status. LXX Prov 7 describes a "strange and wicked woman" (v. 5). The passage never mentions her ethnic background. It is explicit, however, that she is married (v. 19). 731 For the former, see Aeschylus, Agamemnon 448 and the latter, Herodotus 8.73. 741 Not being "great" with such a woman may be a reference to having children. See Fox, Proverbs Proverbs 1-9, 394; d'Hamonville, Les Proverbes, 190-91. 75, Cook, "466 ",אטה זרה. 761 Fox, "The Strange Woman," 42. 771 This is often understood as a reference to one's wife.

Strange Waters and the Foolish Woman For Cook the "strangeness" of the Strange Woman in LXX Proverbs is ultimately a reference to Hellenistic philosophy—"foreign wisdom." He grants that this connection is not always clear in the accounts of this figure in Prov 2, 5 and 7, and argues that these texts need to be understood in terms of chapter 9.80 In this chapter the LXX includes two sets of pluses. There are three additional verses between MT Prov 9:12-13 (9:12a-c) and the chapter concludes with four verses not in the masoretic text (9:18a-d). The first plus is as follows:81 9:12־ one wh0 relies on lies, he shepherds winds, he pursues flying birds. 9:12b For he has deserted the ways of his vineyard, and gone astray (from) the paths of his own field. 9:12c He travels through a waterless desert and a land assigned to droughts, he gathers barrenness with (his) hands. The second plus: 9:18a But turn away, do not delay in the place, nor set your eye upon her. 9:18b ρ0Γ thUs you will go through strange (or: "foreign"; άλλότριον) water, and cross over a strange (άλλότριον) river. 9;18c From strange (άλλοτρίου) water keep away, and from a strange (άλλοτρίας) spring do not drink, 9:18d So that you may live long, and years of life be added to you. Prov 9:12a-c describes a foolish man and 9:18a-d embellishes the account of Woman Folly in w. 13-18, whose description is framed by these pluses.82 801 Cook, "469 "אטה זרה; idem, The Septuagint ofProverbs, 141, 285. 811 811 Fox, Proverbs 1-9, 418-23; idem, 37-42; Cook, The Septuagint of Proverbs, 266-86; idem,idem, "470-75 ",אטה זרה; d'Hamonville, Les Proverbes, 215-17. s2&gt; Cook, "472 ",אטה זרה.</page><page sequence="23">42 Μ. Goff/Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 20-45 These pluses, Cook argues, were not part of the Vorlage of the LXX but added by the translator.83 The water imagery of Prov 9:18a-d in his opin ion refers to Styx, the river of Hades in Greek mythology.84 The foolish woman of Prov 9:13-18 is symbolically recast as foreign waters one should avoid, and thus has become a cipher for foreign wisdom. Fox is critical of Cook's reading of the pluses: "The Styx is fatal in the crossing, not in drinking or touching, nor would the reader be advised to pass through the River Styx" (cf. 9:18b).85 He argues that Prov 9:12a-b are translations of Hebrew, which he reconstructs. He contends that they were added "as a hermeneutic guide" to Prov 9, emphasizing the importance of not trusting in falsehoods.86 Prov 9:12c and 18a-d are Greek additions. In his view these pluses are not negative allusions to Hellenistic philoso phy. Rather the recommendation that one is to pass through but not par take of these strange waters is a modus vivendi for Diaspora Jews: "Pass through the culture but don't assimilate it."87 Offering a different perspec tive, Prov 9:12a-b teaches that "it is possible simply to stay home and avoid the foreign realm."88 Fox's critique of Cook is well-founded. In Greek tradition everyone crosses the River Styx when they die. Only the wicked and foolish heed the false teachings of the foolish woman of Prov 9. It is a debated topic, but many commentators agree that LXX Proverbs reflects a degree of famil iarity with Hellenistic philosophical ideas. The word αρμόζουσα ("harmo nizing") in Prov 8:30, corresponding to the famous masoretic crux אמון, is a case in point.89 If LXX Proverbs appropriates Greek philosophical 831 Cook, The Septuagint of Proverbs, 273. 841 Cook, The Septuagint of Proverbs, 284; idem, "474 ",אשה זרה.

This supports his view that the two pluses are not from the same authors. Τον, "Recensional Differences," 48, understands Prov 9:12a-b as "inner translational pluses" rather than a reflection of the book's Vorlage. See also Cook, "The Text-Critical Value of the Septuagint of Proverbs," 414-15. 89, Fox, Proverbs 1-9, 414, discerns in the term αρμόζουσα the Pythagorean idea of harmo nia,nia, "the music of the spheres." Hen^ci, Judaism and Hellenism, 1.162-63, argues that LXX Prov 8:22-31 relies on the Stoic idea of the "world soul" and may reflect familiarity with Plato's Timaeus. Gerleman, Studies, 57, claims that LXX Prov 8:30 is a product of</page><page sequence="24">Μ. Gojf/ Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 20-45 43 concepts, even to a limited extent, this would run counter to the basic thrust of Cook's reading of the Strange Woman as "foreign wisdom."90 Moreover, in Prov 9:18 the guests of the woman are in Sheol but not in the Septuagint version of the line. If the waters of Prov 9:18a-d represent the River Styx, one would have expected LXX Prov 9:18 to intensify, rather than obscure, the assertion that the foolish woman's guests are in the underworld.91 One could argue that the water imagery in Prov 9:18a-d functions like that of Prov 5:15, which urges a male addressee to drink water from his own "well," a reference to sex within the confines of marriage.92 In this reading the strange waters symbolize women to whom one is not married and thus sexually out of bounds. Ethnicity would thus not be the core issue. The emphasis in Prov 9:12b on not abandoning one's vineyard or field can be understood as metaphors for one's own wife, "the source of legitimate delight and fruitfulness."93 The "strange" waters in Prov 9:18a-d are reasonably understood as a reference to ethnic foreignness, as Cook and Fox suspect. One should pass through the strange waters without drinking from them (9:18b-c). This assertion does not make sense as advice about avoiding relations with women aside from one's wife. The plus is better read along the lines of Fox's interpretation that Prov 9:18a-d endorses a Diaspora attitude of accep tance without full assimilation.94 The plus in Prov 9:10 supports the view that the waters symbolize ideas that Jews are to avoid: "for to know the law engagement with Stoic philosophy, and he sees echoes of Hellenistic philosophy elsewhere in the book.

Goff/Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 20-45 (νόμον) is the sign of a sound mind." This is plausibly read as a reference to the Torah.95 The law and the strange waters of Prov 9:18a-d can be under stood as opposed to one another, although this contrast is never stated explicitly. Woman Folly and the Strange Woman are similar in the MT, but only the latter is "strange." The connection of the term αλλότριος to both women indicates a degree of overlap between the two not found in the Hebrew text. Above I argued that the "strangeness" of the Strange Woman, in both Greek and Hebrew Proverbs, relates primarily to the fact that she is not the sanctioned marriage partner of the envisioned male addressee. In Prov 9:18a-d the word, which is used repeatedly, seems to refer to ethnic ity. This supports the view held by Cook and Fox that the plus is a Greek addition and can thus itself be considered an interpretation of Woman Folly. LXX Proverbs does not emphasize that the woman of Prov 9:13-18 is the personification of folly but rather that she is a symbol for Gentile ways of life that Jews should not wholly adopt. In this broad sense one can agree with Cook that she signifies "foreign wisdom." The situation is quite different in 4Q184. The ethnicity of its main character is never discussed. There is nothing that could be construed as "foreign wisdom." Conclusion Neither LXX Proverbs nor 4Q184 represent a consistent and thorough effort to transform the Strange Woman into an abstract symbol. But in both texts a trend towards abstraction can be discerned. The woman in 4Q184 is not primarily designed to represent an immoral female of the sort one could encounter but is rather a vivid and loose appropriation of the Strange Woman that intensifies her affiliation with death and Sheol. In LXX Proverbs the Strange Woman is generally depicted as a woman one should avoid but in chapter 2 she is sublimated into a base attribute, "evil counsel" that is associated with a house in the underworld. LXX Proverbs and 4Q184 have a similar pedagogical approach. MT Proverbs teaches that the Strange Woman is an enticing figure whose allure should be '5י LXX Prov 1:7; 6:23; 13:15; 28:4. See J. Cook, "The Law of Moses in Septuagint Proverbs," VT49 (1999): 448-61 (esp. 455); idem, "472 ",אפה זרה.

Gojfi Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 20-45 45 resisted. In their reception of this woman, the producers of LXX Prov and 4Q184 mitigated aspects of her that could be seen as positive, such as her eroticism, in order to make explicit that their female characters are immoral and dangerous.96 The primary challenge is not to resist their sultry tempta tions but to understand that they are wicked, which 4Q184 and LXX Proverbs make glaringly obvious. These two texts appear to have interpre tative traditions in common, or at least understand the Strange Woman in similar ways.97 The view of Hengel and Cook that the Strange Woman of the Septua gint is a negative reaction to Hellenistic philosophy should be revised. But Hengel is right that LXX Prov is profitably compared with 4Q184. %) Jones, "Wisdom's Pedagogy," 79. '7) One famous example of interpretative traditions found in the Septuagint attested else where in early Jewish literature is LXX Gen 2:2, which states that God finished the work of creation on the sixth day. "This is probably intended to avoid the implication that God performed some degree of work on the seventh day, the Sabbath. The tradition that God ended his work on the sixth day is found in other sources, including Jubilees (2:16) and the Samaritan Pentateuch (cf. Philo, Opif. 89). See J. C.
