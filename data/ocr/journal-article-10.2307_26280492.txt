<plain_text><page sequence="1">James F. Lea. Kazantzakis: The Politics of Salvation. Foreword by Helen Kazantzakis. University: University of Alabama Press, 1979. 207 pp. f 13.50. This study is a valuable explication of the Greek writer's political thought, a thorough analysis and evaluation of his ideas and the meaning of his credos in our century. In the first part of his book, James Lea offers us an adequately in formative survey of the familial, sociopolitical, and cultural influences which provided the background for his political philosophy of freedom. The appro priate quotations chosen from Kazantzakis' novels serve to illustrate vividly how his parents, the women in his life, and, above all, the harsh reality of his motherland, Crete, equidistant from Europe, Asia, and Africa, contributed to the formation of his unique Cretan glance: "the third eye of the soul [which] is freedom, the ontological attitude that can grasp life and death —the élan vital/ life pulse of the universe" (p. 29). In the second part, Lea continues to examine in chronological order the several phases of Kazantzakis' progression of political thought in relation to con temporary historical events: the Buddhist apoliticism, which dominated the years 1918-1920 was abandoned for the revolutionary activism of the 1920-1930s; an intense involvement in Soviet Marxism, "the most extreme betrayal of his literary nature . . . [, and] the most important political implication of his internal struggle for Kazantzakis' thought" (p. 39). It is the period during which Kazant zakis turned to an active political participation that later became political inept ness for two reasons: his literary nature and his preoccupation with values rather than the structure of a political system. As a consequence, his violent, end oriented Marxist approach underwent a transformation (1936-1938), leading to a deep but man-centered spiritualism. "The forceful power of the spirit rather than the power of violence becomes a central theme of his works in the 1940s and 1950s" (p. 53). In the third part, in order to illustrate this transformation, Lea refers to the great philosophies which influenced Kazantzakis' thought: Buddha's non-existen tialism, Nietzschean nihilism, Bergson's dynamic evolution, Hegel's scientific historicism, Marx's economic determinism, Spengler's cultural determinism, and Spinoza's scientific naturalism. Kazantzakis admirably combined Eastern and Western thought to renounce the scientific ethos of Communism as temporal and adopted an interrelated artistic-political role where art represents "the best 370 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="2">hope for world deliverance and betterment" (p. 83). This exposition is followed, in the fourth part, by a close analysis of the writer's religious thought, discussions of the struggle of man to create his personal God, the rejection of the Christian anthropomorphic God, and the contribution of the Greek classical heritage to the visualization of a new God. For Kazantzakis saw that "Greece represents the meeting place of East and West symbolized as the interaction of Apollo, God of the West and Dionysus, God of the East" (p. 115). In this fashion, the Greek background did not limit his vision; on the contrary, the former aristocratic nationalism (1912-1922) ultimately yielded to a holistic insight of international ism as it is eloquently discussed in the last part of Lea's book with numerous references to Kazantzakis' The Odyssey, an c; exploration of the meaning of freedom, which bears an ontological validity transcending socio-political con cepts and can be described as a revision of the Cartesian cogito from '"I think therefore I am' to 'I strive therefore I am'" (p. 156). The Politics of Salvation contains, thus, a valid thesis, contradicting the view that Kazantzakis was "apolitical." Helen Kazantzakis mentions in the foreward that the essay has been written with "much knowledge and affection." Moreover, it is distinguished by the rare privilege that it addresses a wide range of readers with quite different specializations and interests, whether literature, history, political philosophy, or political science.
