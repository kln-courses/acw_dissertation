<plain_text><page sequence="1">God in Christian Thought and Experience. By W. R. Matthews, M.A., D.D. (Library of Constructive Theology.) (London: Nisbet &amp; Co. 193?- Pp. xix + 283. Price 10s. 6d.) Ritschl's statement that the field in which theology and philosophy meet is the doctrine of God is illustrated by the title of the volume to be here reviewed. The series to which the volume belongs, The Library of Con? structive Theology, seeks "to lay stress upon the value and validity of religious experience"; but this is the only volume in the series the title of which makes reference to "religious thought" as well. It is impossible, as the author recognizes, to deal with the subject of God without this wider reference; and throughout the volume account is taken of the bearing of contemporary philosophy on the theological formulation of the religious belief in God. The starting-point, however, is religious experience, not exclusively Christian, as the first chapter deals with Man's Experience of God in religion generally, which is described as the recognition of and co-operation with "The Beyond that is akin," and is defended as "an anthropomorphic interpretation of reality." The second chapter, which deals with The Development of the Con? ception of God, shows that "anthropomorphism is the line of progress," until the development is consummated in God in Christ Jesus. The third and fourth chapters then discuss The Christian Experience of God. In these what may be described as a "liberal evangelical" theology is presented. The conclusion is reached that the New Testament does contain suggestions towards a doctrine of the Trinity. "The fifth chapter, on The Theological Conception of God, offers a candid and effective criticism of the dogmatic development, and offers as a "reason for the partial failure of traditional theology, not a lack of intellectual power or religious experience on the part of the theologians, but rather the inadequacy of the intellectual tools which were available. Philosophy, as they were acquainted with it, was incapable of fulfilling the task which they imposed upon it" (p. 110). In the remaining seven chapters the author seeks "to approach the eternal problem of God from the standpoint" of our own time, "in view of changed philosophical presuppositions and enlarged knowledge." In the sixth chapter, entitled Transition, "the present stage of intellectual development is sur- veyed," and "the converging tendencies of different schools of philosophy" 126</page><page sequence="2">NEW BOOKS are interpreted as resulting in the displacement of static by dynamic categories, and as involving a challenge of theistic thought: "Is not the process (of the world) itself the sole reality?" (p. 131). This is the challenge the author seeks to meet. Chapter VII offers an argument for Transcendence. Assuming the evolution of the Universe from stage to stage, each trans- cending the one preceding, the consummation is found in God. "The ladder of being by which we ascend through the orders from matter to spirit leads, in the conviction of religion, to the supreme Being, who is the Transcendent One, beyond all orders of being, but at the same time the One, whose presence with every order and level gives them their existence and constitutes them into orders, and into an order." Here the author insists on the value of the doctrine of Creation. "The Creator transcends all creatures . . . as the active Will in which they take their origin" (p. 136). Chapter VIII then seeks to show that the Creator, so transcending, is the living and personal God. While it is admitted that not all religions unequivocally witness to the personality of God, yet "the Christian faith and the Christian experience are alike involved in the assertion that in the divine Life is the perfection of person? ality, so that it is manifested in the Incarnation through the life of a perfect human Person" (p. 163). The difficulties of this assertion are fully recognized. After a discussion on the nature of personality as active subject, not passive substance, reasons for and objections to "believing that God is personal" are dealt with. "Possibly the Godhead," the author says, "is best described as 'supra-personal,' but impersonal categories are not admissible." What is essential is "to justify and clarify the Christian experience of personal relationship with God" (p. 179). Chapter IX, on The Holy Trinity, shows how in that Christian experience this doctrine has its roots, and any influence from pagan religion is denied. The "economic" Trinity is rejected; a trini- tarian constitution of human personality is expounded as an analogy of the divine Trinity; but another is found also in the conception of society as tending towards personal unity; and the author asserts his conviction that these analogies converge. Having thus reached the Christian conception of God, the author in successive chapters discusses three problems. What is involved in Creation; how the evil in the world can be reconciled with the belief in God as love; and the way in which God, though eternal, is related to Time, so that it has a relative reality for Him, and He is carrying on the providential order of the World. I find myself in almost entire agreement with the theological and the philosophical conclusions of the whole volume. The treatment of all the varied topics is masterly; there is adequate knowledge and competent judg? ment. The claim of religions, specially Christian experience, to be fully taken into acount is maintained; and yet the need to justify that experience intellectually is recognized. The volume can be most cordially commended even to readers whose interest is dominantly philosophical, for not only does the author recognize the claim of philosophy to be heard on this subject, but may it not be urged that the Christian experience is a datum no philosophy can afford to ignore ?
