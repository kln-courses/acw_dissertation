<plain_text> <page sequence="1">     Conclusion While the graphic novels explored in this book abound in posthuman  scenarios made possible by advances in artificial intelligence, virtual  reality, bionics, genetic engineering and cryonics, they remain deeply  suspicious of the co- option of these technologies for the pursuit of  immortality and a transcendence of the materiality of human existence.  Such uses of technology are likely to be associated in these texts with  authoritarian practices of mind control, intensive surveillance, politi- cal repression and discrimination of various kinds. Indeed, in some of  the graphic novels studied here, technology is primarily construed as  a threat to humanity. These texts would fit more comfortably into the   ‘anti- humanist’ camp, as defined by Rosi Braidotti, than a fully posthu- manist one:  their opposition to humanism does not move forwards to   trace ‘a different discursive framework’ or to look ‘more affirmatively     towards new alternatives’.1 The political imperatives that shape La bur-  buja de Bertold, Planeta Extra or Dengue, for example – a denunciation  of the vast social and geopolitical inequalities and the environmental  disasters that are only deepened by the kind of hubristic and exploit-  ative development that fuels contemporary technocapitalism – relegate   to a role of lesser importance the task of ‘elaborating alternative ways   of conceptualizing the human subject’ which characterizes posthuman    thought for Braidotti.2 Other texts studied here do, however, confront the challenge of  tracing new ways to conceive of human subjectivity and agency that   do not cast nature or technology as humanity’s ‘other’. They create uni- verses in which humans are neither unique nor morally superior, and in   which our destinies are thoroughly entwined with those non- humans –   animals, machines, crops, oceans, energy sources, forests – that we  have sought to dominate and exploit for our own advancement. They  find ways to move beyond the binaristic, exclusionary logic that has  informed the discourses and practices of modernity. This entails a thor- ough rejection of representationalism in its separation of the world into  207 </page> <page sequence="2">    words and things. This is particularly evident in Informe Tunguska,  which brings nature and culture together in relationships of symbio- sis and similarity, using patterns and models from the natural world to  explain the development and dissemination of human language and cul- ture. Many of these graphic novels, including 1899: cuando los tiempos  chocan and E- Dem, call for a new posthuman ethics based on an under- standing of the co- evolution of humans and technologies and the com-  plex assemblages that bind them together. The ‘becoming topological’  (see Chapter Five) of time, space and culture demands new approaches  to account for the complexities of power in the contemporary city and  in global digital society more broadly, some of which are suggested in O  Beijo Adolescente. As Ollivier Dyens states, in these increasingly intricate ecosystems,   ‘The body has become entangled in a multitude of systems, fragmented  into an infinite number of realities, easily plasticized into untold num- ber of shapes and forms, dissolved into its constituting parts and frag-    ments’.3 The affordances, as well as the dangers, that result from such  assemblages are powerfully brought into focus in a number of graphic  novels from Latin America. While they often explore distributed forms  of agency and the role of the digital and the virtual in the construction of   posthuman ‘subjectivities’, they do not abandon the body as an obsolete  relic of the past, soon to be replaced by new forms of consciousness that  transcend human mortality and physical imperfections. Instead, they  consistently emphasize embodiment and materiality, drawing attention  to what is occluded by the apparently dematerialized nature of infor-  mation and cyberculture. Jan Baetens and Hugo Frey suggest that ‘the   overwhelming presence of the protagonists’ bodies’ in the graphic novel  signals one of many instances of its convergence with contemporary   thought, specifically here ‘the rediscovery of the body in cultural     theory’.4 The analyses presented in this study have given much evidence  of this convergence, and delved deeper to ask what it is about the form  and materiality of the graphic novel that makes it so uniquely qualified  to illuminate questions of embodiment and textuality in posthumanism.  In some texts, such as Angela Della Morte, E- Dem and Policía del  Karma, posthuman embodiment is worked through via the hyperbolic  treatment of gendered bodies. As discussed in the relevant chapters,  gender politics in these graphic novels is marked by a certain opacity  and a resistance to theorization from an ideological perspective. The  bodies they depict are not (simply or primarily) subjected to Foucauldian  disciplinary discourses or the site of the kind of iterative and citational   performances described by Judith Butler. Karen Barad’s posthumanist  208 Posthumanism and thE graPh ic novEL in L at in amEr ica </page> <page sequence="3">     notion of performativity – while acknowledging the significance of   Foucault and Butler for her work – attempts to move beyond them to  theorize in a much fuller way the relationship between the discursive  and the material in a posthuman context. To avoid reinscribing matter,   and particularly human bodies, as ‘a passive product of discursive prac-    tices’,5 she emphasizes the active role of materiality in materialization,   and calls for ‘a robust theory of the materialization of bodies’ that would  take account of the intra- activity of non- human as well as human forms     of agency.6 Angela Della Morte, E- Dem and Policía del Karma push us in  a similar way beyond the anthropocentric limits of the work of Foucault  and Butler. They dramatize the intra- actions of human and non- human  agencies and demonstrate how the specific materiality of human bodies  shapes the ways in which they may be taken up by, and resist, discursive  formations. In this respect, these graphic novels share a critical commit- ment with a number of recent theorists seeking to bring the insights of  queer theory and affect theory to bear on posthumanism. Mel Y. Chen,  for example, explores the construction of animacy hierarchies in biopo- litical regimes. The relentless mapping of distinctions between what is  animate and inanimate (beyond human and animal) produces slippages  between these categories. A full examination of the concept of animacy  reveals its slipperiness and carries out an effect of queering the domi- nant distinctions between life and death and the production of gendered   and racial identities. ‘Queering,’ Chen claims, ‘is immanent to animate  transgressions, violating proper intimacies (including between humans     and non- human things).’7  Claire Colebrook has warned that the assertion of a flat ‘dehier-  archized’ ontology through the erasure of the human from its elevated   perspective is doomed to ‘ultrahumanism’ since ‘when “man” is negated  or removed what is left is the human all too human tendency to see     the world as one giant anthropomorphic self- organizing living body’.8  Posthumanism is certainly vulnerable to criticisms concerning its  anthropomorphizing gestures, as well as its covert universalism, which  ultimately flattens difference in the manner denounced by Juanita  Sundberg (see the Introduction). The treatment of posthuman bodies in  the graphic novels we have studied here may well, at times, fall into the  trap of anthropomorphization, although this is effectively turned on its  head in Informe Tunguska (see Chapter Six) and in the animist leanings  of the work of Edgar Clement (see Chapters Two and Three). Moreover,  these works cannot easily be charged with universalism, remaining  acutely aware of human difference even as they explore couplings and  comminglings between the human and non- human. concLus ion 209 </page> <page sequence="4">    The manifest commitment of Latin American graphic fiction to  materialist and embodied concepts of the posthuman is unsurprising in   the context of the continent’s historical and contemporary experience of  socio- economic inequality and its continued relegation to the periphery   of global power. Sherryl Vint reminds us in her study of the ‘bodies of   tomorrow’ that:  The ability to construct the body as passé is a position only avail- able to those privileged to think of their (white, male, straight,  non- working- class) bodies as the norm. This option does not exist  for those who still need to rely on the work of their bodies to pro- duce the means of survival, for those who lack access to the tech- nologies that can erase the effects of illness, and for those whose  lives continue to be structured by racist, sexist, homophobic, and    other body- based discourses of discrimination.9 The alacrity with which some posthuman thinkers have done away   with the body – regarding it as a relic of the past in a new digital age –  reveals the continued legacy of Cartesian dualism, which insists on    associating the self with the mind.10 But it also exposes the ethical void  at the heart of the liberal humanist project, which finds its most per-   fect expression in transhumanist disembodiment.11 As Vint points out,   ‘Disembodied consciousnesses lack a connection to material reality, and     material reality is the space of ethics’.12 The refusal of disembodiment that characterizes these graphic  novels is consistent with a number of theoretical engagements with  posthumanism both within and beyond Latin America that have  warned of the dangers of fully turning our backs on humanism. Mabel   Moraña argues that posthumanism should serve as a critical tool to  examine the complicities of humanism and colonialism in the region  and rework humanistic discourses from within. In this, she follows Neil   Badmington’s argument that the aim of critical posthumanism should   not be to ‘fashion “scriptural tombs” for humanism’ but rather ‘take the  form of a critical practice that occurs inside humanism, consisting not     of the wake but of the working through of humanist discourse’.13 Simply  to move beyond humanism would be to risk re- instituting the racial  and gendered codifications that policed the term in the first place. As  Zakiyyah Iman Jackson puts it in her critique of the disavowal of race   in much posthumanist thought, ‘What and crucially whose conception     of humanity are we moving beyond?’14 Las playas del otro mundo and   Operación Bolívar both articulate posthuman visions in the heart of the  210 Posthumanism and thE graPh ic novEL in L at in amEr ica </page> <page sequence="5">    humanist culture of the colonial era. In this respect, the texts construct  a perspective that coincides with theorists who have criticized posthu- man theory for caricaturing humanism as a homogeneously Cartesian   enterprise. In her study of what she calls the ‘anatomical humanism’ of   the nineteenth century, Kay Anderson argues that ‘humanity’s unique  capacity for intelligence was no ethereal myth handed down by classi-    cal, Christian and Cartesian narratives of reason and soul’.15 Rather, it   was a ‘technical and discursive achievement’ that relied on the practices  of colonial racial science (and in particular craniometry) in an endlessly  frustrated attempt to reinforce hierarchies among and between living    beings by recourse to material differences in anatomy.16 Although ques- tions of race are not often explicitly thematized in the texts discussed  here, their commitment to an embodied posthumanism and their  engagement with the modes of exclusion produced by humanism align   them with Anderson’s ideal of a critical posthumanism that should be ‘as     lithe and flexible’ as humanism itself.17 In the Latin American context, it is not always easy to read  these graphic novels as political projects. If, as Elana Gomel claims,   ‘Posthumanism is not an identity or an ideology but a willingness to     abandon both’,18 then the ethical interests of posthuman texts will not  be founded on identity politics. This marks a point of divergence from  the kind of politics that has been so prominent in Latin America in recent  decades, and so powerful in its opposition to the hegemonic, univer- salizing categories that marginalize and suppress difference. Nor will  these texts subscribe to any coherent ideology, distancing themselves   from the ‘isms’ – Marxism, feminism, post- colonialism and so on – that  have so thoroughly shaped political commitment in Latin American art  and cultural criticism for many decades. Indeed, posthumanism has  provoked criticism from Marxist critics for reinforcing the conditions  of oppression of the capitalist system. Jennifer Cotter et al. argue that  if humanism functioned as a key component of the ideological infra-  structure of industrial capitalism by fostering a ‘more unified notion   of social relations to suture class contradictions’ then posthumanism is    an ideological agent of post- industrial capitalism.19 The decentred sub- jectivities described by critics such as Braidotti are the counterparts to  an increasingly centreless and flexible capitalist system. The potential  articulation of posthumanism with contemporary capitalism is directly  addressed in O Beijo Adolescente. The series plays on an ambiguity con- cerning whether its teenage protagonists carry out a heroic resistance   to the ‘adult’ capitalist world of work or embody a solution to the conun- drum of what constitutes work in a digital economy. In other words, it is  concLus ion 211 </page> <page sequence="6">    unclear whether the teenagers are arch anti- capitalists or the embodi- ment of a flexible, decentred digital capitalism. Posthumanism remains a particularly ambivalent discursive tool  in the service of an emancipatory politics. The contradictory politics of   a cyborg world – ushering in greater societal control, but also opening  up to new ontologies and a new politics that is not based on essentialist   identities – is succinctly outlined by Badmington: From one perspective, a cyborg world is about the final imposi- tion of a grid of control on the planet, about the final abstraction  embodied in a Star Wars apocalypse waged in the name of defence,   about the final appropriation of women’s bodies in a masculinist   orgy of war [. . .]. From another perspective, a cyborg world might  be about lived social and bodily realities in which people are not  afraid of their joint kinship with animals and machines, not afraid  of permanently partial identities and contradictory standpoints.  The political struggle is to see from both perspectives at once because  each reveals both dominations and possibilities unimaginable from    the other vantage point.20 The graphic novels explored in this book often adopt this dual perspec- tive. They bear witness to the terrible loss of autonomy that might result  from authoritarian uses of biotechnology, but gesture to the new expres- sions, experiences and ethical practices that might arise from enhanced  or altered forms of embodiment, or from recouplings of nature and cul- ture, bodies and machines or the material and the virtual. The ambig-  uous narrative modes of Policía del Karma and O Beijo Adolescente pose  considerable challenges to dominant models of political resistance and  demand new critical approaches that move beyond the simple designa-  tion of technologies as ‘good’ or ‘harmful’. Posthuman perspectives can  certainly offer a cogent way to explore the moral and social complexities  of a post- ideological, neoliberal society, but their power is often more  descriptive than normative and perhaps more easily harnessed to a  broadly ethical agenda than a specifically political one. Graphic novels from Latin America make a clear contribution to  the task of decolonizing both culture and theory, however. A crucial ele- ment in the new posthuman ontologies explored in many of these texts   is the performance of a ‘reenchantment of the world’ in which cybernetic  technologies are related to the kind of human/ non- human metamor- phoses and exchanges imagined in indigenous (usually Mesoamerican)   cosmovisions. In Las playas del otro mundo, Operación Bolívar and Los  212 Posthumanism and thE graPh ic novEL in L at in amEr ica </page> <page sequence="7">     perros salvajes, these practices – ostensibly rejected by modernity as   primitive and irrational – offer insights into a contemporary world of  new media technologies and new forms of imperial violence. The role  of indigenous practices in these texts is often strongly associated with a  broader aim to decolonize thought and to question European narratives  of modernity and progress. The unexpected convergences enacted in Las   playas del otro mundo, Operación Bolívar and Los perros salvajes between  religion, magic and technology, alongside those of BioCyberDrama Saga   and the ‘Aurora pós- humana’, cast those relationships as ones of co-  evolution and symbiotic development rather than antagonism, even in   ‘modern’ Europe. This rhetorical move resonates with Latour’s critique  of a modernity that has gone to disastrous lengths to suppress animism,  magic, the primitive and the irrational in a bid to establish an illusory  rupture with the past and with anything that might hamper an embrace  of science and progress (see Chapter Two). It also becomes part of these   texts’ rewriting and resituating of cybernetic tropes and posthumanist  debates from within the Latin American context. The important critique in the Latin American graphic novel of  European discourses and practices of modernity does not, however, lead  to a pseudo- Romantic nostalgia for the pre- modern. Indeed, the nostal-  gia and history that Baetens and Frey find to be the ‘common theme’    across graphic novels today21 is almost entirely absent in the texts we  have explored here. Their thesis holds reasonably well for current pro- duction in Europe and North America, where historical and autobi- ographical genres have dominated the rise of the graphic novel in the  twenty- first century. However, it does not account for the flourishing of  cyborg fictions in Latin America in that same period. Indeed, Baetens   and Frey suggest that ‘a real casualty’ of the trend towards history and   nostalgia ‘has been the science fiction genre’, and that the few science  fiction narratives still being produced are becoming subsumed under     ‘heritage thematics’ and steampunk nostalgia.22  Baetens and Frey’s exclusion of Latin American material is hardly  unusual among the analyses and theorizations of the graphic novel cur- rently being published in Europe and Anglophone America. It is perhaps  inevitable given the limited availability of translations into English of  the major texts. But it does somewhat weaken their hypothesis that the   rise in nostalgia and the decrease in science fiction’s popularity may be   explained as a consequence of ‘times of less confidence and social anx-  iety [. . .] where there is a preference for glorifying past times, looking     backwards in art and culture to find a sense of security and grounding’.23   Argentina, Chile, Brazil and Mexico – the principal countries whose  concLus ion 213 </page> <page sequence="8">     graphic novels we have explored here – are hardly strangers to the kind  of social and economic crisis cited by Baetens and Frey. Yet even their   steampunk creations such as 1899: cuando los tiempos chocan and Policía  del Karma cannot credibly be read as nostalgic, producing instead an  excoriating critique of political repression and the environmental  destruction wreaked by modern capitalist development. Rather than  nostalgic, we might describe the dominant modes of Latin American  graphic fiction as critical and reflexive. Their frequent recourse to the  science fiction genre befits their interest in exploring posthuman subjec- tivities while setting into relief the gross socio- economic inequality that  characterizes the region. This choice of genre also affords many oppor- tunities to challenge the hegemonic narratives of modernity as well as  humanist universalism and anthropocentrism. If the graphic novel in Latin America has become a privileged  medium for the expression of posthuman subjectivities, this is partly  because the specific modes of visuality and representation proper to  graphic fiction lend themselves to an explicit depiction of how informa- tion systems function and interact in the material world. In his semi-  nal work on comics, Scott McCloud asserts that ‘By de- emphasizing the  appearance of the physical world in favor of the idea of form, the car-    toon places itself in the world of concepts’.24 If this accounts for some  forms of cartoon simplification, however, it is entirely insufficient as a  description of the contemporary graphic novel, which is often complex  and sophisticated in its visual design and clearly prioritizes embodied  experience. By contrast with the literary text, the visual element of  graphic fiction demands that it define and make visible the connections  it imagines between systems. The virtual world and the webs of cyber- space in which humans are caught cannot remain invisible, but must be  made manifest. We see this in the depiction of game worlds in O Beijo  Adolescente or the transmigration of souls in Angela Della Morte. This  visibilizing function is sharpened in science fiction, which often renders  literal (or visible) certain metaphors relating to contemporary subjec- tivity and social relations. Thus the circulation of ideas may be repre- sented as the spread of a virus or our prosthetic use of technology as  a literal coupling between human and robot. As Joanna Russ suggests,   ‘Mundane, realistic fiction often carries its meaning behind the action,  underneath the action, underneath the ostensible action. Science fiction  cancels this process by making what is usually a literary metaphor into a     literal identity’.25 These processes of literalization and visibilization are   particularly evident in Policía del Karma, in which even psychic commu- nication and spiritual emanations acquire a material density. As Baradit  214 Posthumanism and thE graPh ic novEL in L at in amEr ica </page> <page sequence="9">     and Cáceres explain in an epilogue to Policía del Karma, ‘en este mundo   PDK las energías incluso espirituales son cuestiones administrables,   mensurables y utilizables’ (in the PDK world even spiritual energies may  be managed, measured and utilized). The materializing effects of graphic fiction are compounded by a  widespread use of erotic, violent or hyperbolic images of the body in the  medium. These images reference the embodied nature of perception  and affect and experiment with sensorimotor forms of cognition on the   part of the reader. They are not just meant to be ‘viewed’ or ‘read’ but to  trigger remembered responses of pain or pleasure or to invoke different  forms of embodied experience in a way that engages the reader on an  affective level. Such experiences typically include physical disorienta- tion, euphoria, feeling alone in the vastness of the universe or sensing   a deep bond with other beings or one’s environment, torture or con- finement, sensory deprivation, vertigo, the intoxicating or somniferous  effect of ingesting different chemical substances, endorphin- induced  elation or exhaustion. This may also account for the frequent represen- tation in graphic fiction of out- of- body experiences, hallucinations, fan- tasies, the supernatural and drug- taking, in order to defamiliarize our  embodied experience and to challenge more conventional notions of a  hierarchical relationship between mind and body. The images of graphic   fiction do not simply ‘stand in’ for reality or mediate between us and that  reality. They often produce in us the same effects, triggering the same  sensory responses and extending our experience of embodiment while,  at the same time, challenging ways in which we normally orient our- selves within our environment. While many theories of graphic fiction   have focused on the medium’s dynamic interplay between the visual  and the verbal, what has often been omitted is an account of how the  visual spills over into the visceral, as unexpected angles, discontinuous  zoom- outs and collage splash pages wrench us from a neutral sense of  balance, proportion and spatial relations. The demands placed on the   reader of the graphic novel – kept in tension with its strong identificatory   effects – make it a privileged medium for an engagement with ethics  in a posthuman world, in which it is imperative that we learn to nego- tiate our shared existence with non- humans and to participate consci- entiously in modes of embodiment that are not (and have never been)  uniquely human. For this reason, graphic novels lend themselves particularly well  to the exploration of critical approaches that have emerged from theo- ries of embodied cognition in relation to practices of reading, writing,  drawing, viewing and listening, many of which we have explored in the  concLus ion 215 </page> <page sequence="10">    analyses presented here. These approaches (such as those developed    by Karin Kukkonen, Ian Hague and others cited in the Introduction)26  are closely associated with theories of the haptic, but often supplement  these with recent research by psychologists, philosophers and cognitive  scientists into the sensory and perceptual processes at work in reading  and spectatorship. They have a particular value in theorizing graphic  fiction, given the cognitive work that is clearly required of the reader in   constructing meaning from discontinuous panels that – in many con-  temporary graphic novels – are not placed in a straightforwardly linear  sequence. The application of cognitive embodiment theories to the read- ing experience opens up new dimensions of mimesis that are founded,  not on a separation between representation and the represented, but on  the processes of mirroring that are immanent to life and bind nature and  culture together in a posthuman vision. If we have emphasized these  critical perspectives over other approaches that have been developed in   scholarship on graphic fiction and comics – such as semiotics and nar-  ratology – it is because we believe that they offer much greater insights  into posthuman subjectivity and media affordances, the two principal  concerns of the majority of the graphic novels studied in this book. The emphasis on materiality evident in these graphic novels  extends, as we have seen, to the reflexive presentation and manipula- tion of their own medium. From the citations of antiquated cut- and-  paste comic book techniques in 1899: cuando los tiempos chocan to the  haptic, immersive dimensions of the large- format O Beijo Adolescente,  these texts continually reflect on their materiality in a way that contests  any dematerialized understanding of the literary text as independent  from its media supports. More broadly, the frequent experimentation  with intermediality, remediation and transmediality in Latin American  graphic novels works to foreground their position within a complex, con- stantly shifting media ecology in a way that highlights the role of media   technologies in shaping subjectivity. As Latour claims, ‘Technologies  bombard human beings with a ceaseless offer of previously unheard- of   positions – engagements, suggestions, allowances, interdictions, hab-    its, positions, alienations, prescriptions, calculations, memories’,27 and  media technologies, including the book, are no exception. A significant number of the graphic novels discussed here stage  an encounter with different media, often as part of a wider, collab- orative, cross- platform project. In doing so, they sometimes seek a  cultural legitimacy for a medium that has often been associated with   pulp fiction, caricature or children’s literature; the effect is always,  however, to draw attention to the particular ease with which graphic  216 Posthumanism and thE graPh ic novEL in L at in amEr ica </page> <page sequence="11">    fiction may agglutinate, remediate or even replace other forms of art  in performing specific social and cultural roles. If the joint exhibition  of comic book images and ceramic sculptures within the spaces of the  graphic novel and the art gallery in Informe Tunguska was intended as  such a bid for legitimacy (see Chapter Six), it was also an experiment  in extending graphic fiction to three dimensions. Similar experiments  have been carried out at the point of intersection between graffiti and   comic book art in Latin America. Alberto Serrano’s ‘Tito na Rua’ project  uses the streets of Rio de Janeiro as a platform for a narrative that was  constructed with the familiar syntax of the comic book page and sub-  sequently transposed into graphic novel form in Zé Ninguém (2015). In  the context of post- Crisis Argentina, the evocation of portrait painting  and popular theatre in Planeta Extra and La burbuja de Bertold supports  the reassertion of a national- popular imaginary. The newspaper head- lines and blog format of the second volume of Los perros salvajes perform   the role of critical journalism in charting Mexico’s slide into violence.   The immersive effects of videogame aesthetics in E- Dem and Operación   Bolívar prompt reflection on the performativity of violence and specta- torship. Meanwhile, O Beijo Adolescente connects spatial practices such  as graffiti with virtual role- playing realms to reveal the complexity of  socio- technological assemblages in contemporary urban culture. The  repeated images of viral invasion, colonization and propagation in   Policía del Karma create a particular role for graphic fiction as a kind of  counterculture, and its multiplatform strategies point to the potential of  graphic fiction to exemplify (and intervene in) the structural couplings   that characterize cyberspace. In the ‘Aurora pós- humana’, the interplay  between the BioCyberDrama Saga graphic novel and the audio and per- formance elements reinforces the decentred, distributed nature of post- human subjectivity and agency. Simultaneously, it draws attention to  the embodied processes at work, not just in listening to electronic music  or participating in performance art, but also in reading graphic fiction. In a number of cases, the recourse to intermediality constructs a  genealogy for graphic fiction that reaches back to pre- colonial times.   The clear parallels drawn in Las playas del otro mundo, Operación   Bolívar and Los perros salvajes between contemporary graphic fiction  and Mesoamerican codices and sculpture locate a position for comic  book textuality within a long and celebrated history of signifying sys-  tems that combine texts and images in innovative ways. Graphic fiction’s  agglutinative, transmedial practices hold the potential to confound lin- ear histories of the text. They bring together the ancient and the futur- istic in a way that emphasizes continuity rather than rupture. Another  concLus ion 217 </page> <page sequence="12">    example of the interest of contemporary graphic novels in constructing   a sense of artistic continuity with the past would be André Diniz’s Morro  da favela (2011), which mimics the black- and- white woodcuts that illus- trated cordel chapbooks, particularly popular in the 1920s and 1930s in  northeastern Brazil. While they often denounce the violence that characterizes Latin  American history, whether in its pre- Columbian past, the colonial  era or the contemporary period of aggressive neocolonial capitalism,  these graphic novels are also engaged in a constant reflection on their  own materiality, form and readership. Their incorporation of previous  comic book styles and methods of production is less an instance of the   ‘retro culture’ and nostalgia suggested by Baetens and Frey, and much  more evidence of a self- reflexive positioning of the graphic novel. It is  presented as a medium that is fully connected with visual culture and  textuality in a (pre)- colonial past and, at the same time, constantly rein- venting itself as a powerful site for social critique and artistic innovation  in a posthuman era. 218 Posthumanism and thE graPh ic novEL in L at in amEr ica </page> </plain_text>
