As if children did not emulate cultural practices, they noted that "[ethnic] differences are behavioral, rather than physical, and thus are harder to distinguish than gender and racial differ- ences" (p. 25). These conclusions reached by Ocampo et al. not only reduce gender and race to biology but also ignore both the femi- nist literature on the cultural construction of gender (see Stoler's analysis in American Eth- nologist [16(4):634-660] of how race is actu- ally gendered) and the role of the state in imposing certain ethnic categories, especially in multicultural societies (it is not until the last chapter, chapter 14 [Berry], that the issue of the state is addressed). Nonetheless, Ocampo et al. convincingly argue that ethnic awareness occurs sometime between 5 and 12 years of age. In spite of this call for the realization that "ethnicity" does not occur in the minds of children until the fifth birthday (just about the time they begin attending school-a state institution!), the rest of the authors totally ignore the hypothe- sis as well as the importance of gender and discuss the formation and transmission of ethnicity throughout the boak as if ethnic identity was universally an aspect of the self, self-identification, or social identity "trans- mitted" both by family and "nonfamily." As Bernal and Knight generalized, "Ethnic iden- tity is one aspect of the important question, 'Who am I?' It constitutes a basic part of the ethnic individual's personality" (p. 1). With regard to the pervasive lack of gender analy- sis, the feminist focus on power relations be- tween husband and wife could have been useful, for example, in answering the ques- tions Estrada asked in chapter 9 when con- fronted with the fact that children raised un- der an Anglo father and a Hispanic mother are raised "Anglo" (p. 178). Lastly, there is no useful or applicable defi- nition of "ethnic identity." Tautologies abound until Hurtado et al. distinguish "eth- nic identity" from other "social identities" 130 pages later. For example, Bernal et al. (chap- ter 3) write, "Ethnic identity is a construct or set of self-ideas about one's own ethnic group membership" (p. 33; identical definitions are used throughout the book; see Aboud and Doyle, chapter 4, p. 47); Phinney (chapter 5), in her analysis of ethnic identity development among adolescents, does not distinguish be- tween "minorities" and "ethnics" with rigor and talks about "ethnic minority" (p. 63) ren- dering the existence of white ethnics almost invisible (see p. 65). Finally, this lack of aware- ness of a widespread multicultural setting, though acknowledged by Berry (chapter 14), is evident in the conceptual framework of Rotheram-Borus's work on adolescence (chapter 6). Even though Rotheram-Borus noted that "in increasingly pluralistic socie- ties, contact is often with more than one group and, as a result, youth become[s] mul- ticultural" (p. 83), she insists on emphasizing "biculturalism," unconsciously following the "acculturation-assimilation" paradigm, which characterizes the "contact between two cul- tures" syndrome diffused throughout most of the book and which characterized psycho- logical anthropology at the end of World War II. Perhaps Renato Rosaldo's eloquent expo- sition of "cultural borderlands" in Culture and Truth (Beacon Press, 1989) can serve as an adequate reference to rethink these issues. Maybe in the second edition, and for the readers' sake, the editors will consider a much more legitimate form of dialogue in which the politics and production of the discourse on "ethnicity" can be appropriately discussed in an interdisciplinary context that none of us can ignore anymore. Faces in the Clouds: A New Theory of Relig- ion. Stewart Elliott Guthrie. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993. 302 pp. IVAN BRADY State University of New York, Oswego Every thoughtful human being on the planet knows that consciousness brings a sense of mortality; that death brings a sense of loss to the survivors; that contemplating death begs questions about the difference between animated and unanimated bodies; that our inability to control misfortune, the terrors of some dreams and the night, and the need to escape from disease and death under- write an ancient search for realities beyond appearance. That is the stuff of religion. Guthrie scarcely mentions such things, but he connects to them all in a provocative way. He argues that anthropomorphism, "the attribu- tion of human characteristics to nonhuman things or events" (p. 3), is a universal and fundamental part of the human cognitive imperative to make sense of contradictory experiences. So are "optimizing" perceptual strategies-selection for an interpretation that seems best for the circumstances, that perhaps carries "the most meaning," espe-</page><page sequence="2">464 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [96, 1994 cially one that maximizes security and relative certainty. Tracking human beings in their particulars through the same processes and extending them to other experiences with a variety of nonhuman things and events (rocks, vegetables, lightning, etc.), we create a fund of "apparent humans, and echoes and copies of humans, both in our immediate environments and in our ultimate condi- tions." By these calculations, mailboxes can appear as "persons," plagues as "messages," and order in the world as "design" (p. 204). Said simply: being human, we tend to see the world as optimally human, even if by some other cultural or more practical estimation our attribution is wrong. That is the essence of anthropomorphism and its cousins, ani- mism and anthropocentrism, all of which reg- ister as at least connected to religious activi- ties, if not as religion per se. Guthrie relies extensively on cognitive structural psychology in his formulation. He also winds through a slough of data and other theories of anthropomorphism as they ap- pear in anthropology and sociology, the eth- nographic record, historical accounts, litera- ture, architecture, philosophy, physics, biology, art, advertising, and modern Ameri- can society. He is careful to say at every junc- ture how his thesis differs from previous work, so his criticism is both keenly focused and constructive. His real burden, however, is to show what divides religion from other forms of anthropomorphism. By suggesting that "nothing sets it off clearly or distinctly" (p. 197)--that religion, "itself broad and di- verse," is part of the "even broader, more diverse, and persuasive phenomenon" of an- thropomorphism (p. 202)-he leaves an opening for a giant tautology that may or may not claim the whole thesis, depending on how one reads his argument on human conscious- ness, the universality of anthropomorphism in human consciousness, and whether any- thing (including particular forms of anthro- pomorphism) is distinctively religious after all. He does say that religion has no universal functions "other than interpretation and in- fluence, shared by all thought and action" (p. 201). He concludes that it is best understood as a systematic anthropomorphism. It may also be seen as much more than that. Developing the idea that religion is not only an aspect of the more general phenome- non of anthropomorphism but is anthropo- morphism, Guthrie sees both anchored clearly in daily life and extended to other realms. All religions share "the search for human form and behavior, and all constitute claims to have found such form and behavior in the nonhuman world," including shared language, yielding yet another example of anthropomorphism (p. 197). The unity of principles in religious and secular thought also changes the question of religious persist- ence in human society to one of "Why do hunanlike models persist?" (p. 201). The answer is Guthrie's baseline: "Humanlike models persist because they identify and ac- count for the crucial components of our world: humans and their activities and effects. Because such models are vital, employing them is our first, our automatic, and our most powerful approach to the world. In sum, re- ligion arises and persists because the strategy from which it stems often succeeds in identi- fying phenomena-real humans and their actions-that are uniquely important" (p. 201). This larger view also enables Guthrie to address several related questions, such as whether or not nonhuman animals are by their own species equivalent to being anthro- pomorphic and thus "have anything compa- rable to religion." He adverts briefly in this context to Goodall's chimpanzees and their possible interpretations of "storms as living things" (p. 202). He believes his broad ap- proach also helps to explain much that has been attributed to religious thinking and ac- tion, such as "faith, ritual, the supernatural, and the sacred," since these features "stem from the centrality of humanlike beings to religion"; that it "explains views of religion as felt, not thought" (p. 203); and that it "sug- gests why notions such as 'ultimate condi- tions' are more typically the domain of relig- ion than of science or even philosophy" (p. 204). Taking seriously Durkheim's caution about illusion, that any attempt to explain such a pervasive human activity as religion in that framework "must find causes as general as religion itself' (p. 204), Guthrie rises to the challenge: "The causes I have suggested- that perception is interpretation, that inter- pretation attends to the most important pos- sibilities, and the most important possibilities are humanlike-are more general yet. They are embedded in the conditions of our knowl- edge of the world, and they lead us to find humans, and signs of humans, and human- like features, wherever we can" (p. 204). Arguing through fundamentals of human perception, cognition, and representation, and searching widely through the record of human experience and related theories, Guthrie manages to draw from the murky reasonableness of everyday living what is most</page><page sequence="3">GENERAL/THEORETICAL ANTHROPOLOGY 465 human in our perceptions of what animates life; and that is served up on a plate of human ideas about the ultimate death interpretation and management systems we call religions. Anthropomorphism is by itself a sweeping topic with fuzzy edges and a history of lop- sided treatment in anthropology, but Guthrie handles it with originality and-clarity. He may also overpromote its place in the origins of religion. By skirting a tautology (if in fact he really does miss it) and by covering so much disciplinary ground, his thesis is bound to be picked at. Nevertheless, he has posed it with such detail that any successful criticism of it will surely advance our knowledge of the whole topic. Feminist Messages: Coding in Women's Folk Culture.Joan Newlon Radner, ed. Urbana: Uni- versity of Illinois Press, 1993. 324 pp. RUTH SAI.VAGGIO University of New Mexico This timely collection of essays explores feminist acts of coding, the various messages that women communicate through covert forms of expression. Grounded in the disci- pline of folklore, most of the essays investigate the dynamics of coding in women's folk ex- pression, notably in their stories, crafts, and songs. The essays cover a broad range of material, from messages coded in the Anglo- American child ballads to those in African- American women's rap music, from feminist stories embedded in quilts to those coded in dolls, from Native American narratives about healing to feminist renditions of the Grimms' fairy tales. Recognizing that such coded mes- sages are generated from particular women's cultures rather than from some essential fe- male community, the essays shed light on how women's communication, like gender itself, is constructed through the social relations of specific communities and cultures. At the same time, they suggest that women share some common signifying practices whose meanings are not always accessible to men, practices that define a series of coding strate- gies revealed both in women's folk expression and throughout women's expressive culture, from everyday communication to fine art. The collection is divided into four sections showing how women code messages within the patriarchal household, among them- selves, in the larger community, and through interpretations of their own stories. An open- ing essay on "Strategies of Coding," by Joan Radner and Susan Lanser, provides the con- textual framework for the volume by deline- ating a "provisional typology" of coding strategies that are characteristic of women's cultures. These strategies include appropria- tion (exaggerations of male forms or materi- als) ,juxtaposition (the ironic arrangement of texts, artifacts, or performances), distraction (drawing attention away from the subversive power of feminist messages), indirection (ambiguous or equivocal modes of expres- sion), trivialization (adopting forms of ex- pression considered unimportant by the dominant culture), and incompetence (de- nying expertise in order to express resistance to patriarchal expectations). These coding strategies can work in a variety of ways, such as when women appropriate and invert the image of innocent "Sunbonnet Sue" in their quilt work to show their resistance to domi- nant cultural norms; or when they claim do- mestic incompetence to subvert the ideology of domesticity; or when they emphasize am- biguous and equivocal messages in folktales to transform ostensibly misogynist stories into narratives of female empowerment. In a fascinating example of coding through appropriation, Barbara Babcock shows how Indian Pueblo women have taken back the power of storytelling by crafting "storyteller" dolls, thus reclaiming the power of discourse that had originally belonged to them in ma- trilinear pueblo culture. Such examples of coding share insights with much recent femi- nist theory and scholarship that call attention to women's distinctive uses of language within patriarchal cultures that deny them the opportunity to express themselves openly and directly. They also clear the way for other investigations of coding, such as covert mes- sages exchanged in lesbian cultures, an area of study that, as Radner points out, has yet to receive attention from folklorists. While the very acts of coding remind us of the numer- ous ways in which women's language has been curbed and suppressed, the feminist mes- sages contained in these codes show how women have also long resisted and attempted to subvert dominant cultural values and dis- course. As Radner and Lanser explain, under- standing these codes in the context of femi- nism "may help bring about a social order in which coding may no longer be necessary" (p. 24). At the same time, I would add, we can appreciate the necessity of coding-both within feminism and elsewhere-in continu- ally resisting the potential for language to become the property of dominant groups</page></plain_text>
