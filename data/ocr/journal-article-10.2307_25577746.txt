<plain_text><page sequence="1">EDITORIAL I chose to assemble this issue largely by invitation. The reason was partly practical, partly critical. Poetry Ireland Review does receive a considerable volume of American submissions (nearly half our total, of late), but they are of a highly variable calibre, and I was disinclined to rely solely on such postal fortuitousness. Without a spurt of editorial initiative, therefore, it was evident that the issue I envisaged early on would not materialize: poetry from a representative selection of the most interesting poets now at work, buttressed by some genuinely useful and enlightening criticism, the whole aimed at the reader without in-depth knowledge of the poetries of the continent and its islands. The upshot of this decision was several months' intensive reading and research (collections new and revisited, anthologies, magazines, conversations, two trips to the States) followed by a finetuning (very difficult) of the list of poets to be invited. By early August, I had posted eighty-four invitations, and commissioned a number of articles. I then set it all aside and headed off for a much needed break in the Mexican state of Zacatecas-thankfully cut-off from the phone and mail-bag. When I returned to Ireland in September, a small avalanche of packets and envelopes, invited and unsolicited, much more than anticipatd, was waiting. Just oveer half the list responded; submissions ranged from the single poem to the recently completed manuscript. The splendid poetry which follows is only a part of that remarkable haul. A second issue, equally compelling, could easily be compiled from the unused work submitted by the present contributors. As it: turns out, with one exception, the poetry here is by Americans. (Part of me always expects to?see sic after that last word; but usage-history made linguistic-has left us with our ambiguous, fraternal and vaguely insular self-appellation). This bias is lrgely due: to my own lack of familiarity with Canadi-an and'West Indian poetry, but also the size and inter'national importnce of the poetic traditon in the United States, as well as to editorial considerations of focsm and space. The:weight of the prose here,'too, is devoted tocntemporary American poetry.

A fascinating project, indeed, would be an anthology which attempted to mirror the confluence of cultures and languages in the northern Americas by placing under one cover contemporary poets from Mexico, The United States, English-speaking Canada, Quebec, and the anglophone-francophone-Creole Caribbean. Such would certainly illustrate, in the words of the philosopher Cornel West, "[our] radical cultural hybridity, [our] improvisational New World sensibility"-a salutary image of human society in an era increasingly plagued, literally and spiritually, by ethnic and national 'essentialism'. I have ordered the issue with an eye both to creating thematic currents and juxtapositions, and to aligning the sequence of poets in ways which seemed to me apposite, novel or satisfying. I have hoped thereby to strengthen its suggestiveness of the wider American poetic -indeed cultural-grain. I do think, though chary of drawing too much out of the line-up here, (albeit one which contains many of North America's most distinguished and distinctive poets), that a number of wider trends and qualities in the best recent American poetry are distinctively in evidence. One of these, which has an old pedigree in American literature as a whole, is the preoccupation with the relation of language to reality. Many major American authors, Richard Poirier has argued: in a classic formulation, have been preoccupied with metaphors of building, or 'structures' of mind and language, partly, no doubt, as a response to the fluid and intractable, the 'improvisational', New World reality-one is reminded, for instance, of Charles Wright, Allen Ginsberg, Robert Pinsky, Gary Snyder and Jorie Graham. Here too, in microcosm, there is the live sense of political engagement without being ideologically engagd; the religio-spiritual wind-chime, often Budist or Eastem in spiit; and the looming presence of non anthropomorphic wilderness. There is also, in the work of a number of contributors,a rich historical acumen, suggesting to me at least the 'settling' (in the pimary physical sense, as with a house or sediment), the actual deepening 'settlement', of American society after four centuries-thefurther realisation of Frost's "salvation in surrender"to the land,., It seems to me, furthermore, that one of the reasons for this last trend is the emergence and acceptance over the past several poetic generations of major Black and Nate American voices (the voices were always there, of course). The work of Wendy Rose, for example, captures with utmost power te slow-otion genocide and dispossession of the Natie American: she thus makes good, imaginatively, D. H. Lawrences prescient claim that "the aboriginal life of the continent, and ithe conttinity between"t murdered Red America and the seething White Ameiica" are essential components of the mericane "sense of place" Tu to fr, a particlarly vexed ;i Poetry Irela. nd crevie ii 0 X 0 0 0 0 L &lt; wtty Irelan RevOu ~43/44</page><page sequence="3">question in American poetry, it might seem indisputable that over the past forty years the 'open form' has triumphed over the 'closed'. But this, as Thom Gunn makes plain in his riveting essay, is a misleading, if superficially attractive, supposition: there is now a kind of cross fertilizing dtente, or osmosis, between them. One of the reasons, I think, for the growing appreciation of Elizabeth Bishop's importance lies in the recognition of her oeuvre as exemplary: she unites with mastery both the 'open' or loose with the 'closed' or formally taut. I am here reminded of Eliot's prediction in one of his essays that the prosody of the future (and there is always prosody, even if it is anti-prosody) would draw upon and meld all the resources of the poetic tradition: vers libre, accentual-syllabics, rhyme, the alliterative beat, Pound's rhythm of 'the musical phrase', registers of usage, the strengths of prose, et cetera. That prosody, judging from this issue, is now well advanced. Chris Agee Belfast, Co. Antrim 6th October 1994 Poe try Ireland Rve , ./i,</page></plain_text>
