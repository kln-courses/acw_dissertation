<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE METAPHORS IN TIUTCHEV'S PHILOSOPHICAL POEMS SIDONIE H. SAFONOV The poet Afanasii Fet, in his article about Tiutchev, has well characterized the beauty and depth of his countryman's poetry: Two years ago, on a quiet autumn night, I stood in a dark passage-way of the Colosseum and peered through one of the window spaces at the starry sky. Thle big stars looked intently and radiantly into my eyes, and as I gazed into the delicate, dark-blue firmament, other stars appeared before me and looked at me just as mysteriously and just as eloquently as the first. Behind them, in the depth, there twinkled even more delicate sparkles, and little by little they in turn revealed themselves. Framed by the dark masses of the walls, my eyes saw only a small part of the sky, but I felt that it was boundless and that there was no end to its beauty. With similar sensations I open the poems of F. Tiutchev.1 An important factor in the intensity and saturation of thoughts and images in Tiutchev's poetry is his use of metaphors. They enable the poet to project double images into his many-dimensional land and seascapes or into whatever other setting he would choose. Though Tiutchev's works include a number of exquisite love poems (his political verses are of lesser interest), it is in his poems about the mysteries of life that we find him at his best. Tiutchev's concept of life and his philosoph- ical ideas are reflected in his poetry largely though metaphorical images. These are particularly effective in focusing a thought and establishing the relationship between two planes. I. A. Richards (in his book The Philosophy of Rhetoric) calls the Imetaphor "the omnipotent principle of language" which conveys two things in one- the "tenor" or underlying idea, and the "vehicle" or image. He introduces these two technical terms to assist in distinguishing the two parts of a metaphor-its plain meaning on the one hand, and the figure of speech used by the poet on the other. Richards defines the metaphor as "a borrowing between and intercourse of thoughts, a transaction between contexts."2 Personification of nature is one of the most characteristic feautres of Tiutchev's poetry and reveals his attitude toward that plane. Thus he uses many animating verb metaphors, e.g., in the poem "Spring Waters" (Vesennic Vody),3 dated 1832, where the spring waters "run," "waken," and "walk." These underdeveloped metaphors are, of course, from the human domain. The same anthropomorphizing function is performed by the noun metaphor "heralds of spring" (gontsy vesny), by implication the spring waters. One of the best examples of personifying nature may be found in the fol- 'Russkoe slovo, February 1859, Section II, pp. 67-68. Quoted in Tiutchev, p. 29. 2I. A. Richards, The Philosophy of Rhetoric, A Galaxy Book (New York: Oxford University Press, 1965), p. 94. 3F. I. Tiutchev, Stikhotvorenia, pisma (Moskva: Gosudarstvennoe izdatel'stvo khudozhestvennoi literatury, 1957), p. 71. Subsequent references to this edition will appear in the text. For the purpose of this literary analysis I have tried in all my translations of Tiutchev's poetry to stay as close to the literal meaning as possible. 55</page><page sequence="2">lowing lines from "Nature isn't what you think it is" (Ne to, chto mnite vy, priroda), writen in 1836: Nature isn't what you think it is: Its face is neither blind nor soulless- It has a soul, it has its freedom, It has its love, it has its speech . . . (p. 121). Tiutchev here endows nature with a face, a soul, freedom, love, and speech. This poem may be regarded as the credo of Tiutchev's pantheism, since the presence or absence of freedom-according to the Kantian philosophy partly adopted by Tiutchev-is the criterion for humanity. The anthropomorphic features of nature in this poem, however, are not presented in the form of metaphors. Pantheistic thinking is metaphorically expressed in another poem, "You saw him in the circles of the glittering world" (Ty zrel ego v krugu bol'shogo sveta, p. 59), written in the years 1829-30, where the moon is described as a "luminous god" (svetozarnyi bog). In this adjective-noun combination acting as a simple replacement metaphor, the inanimate tenor, the moon, is not only personified but deified. Yet the poem "In the crowd, in the immodest noise of day" (V tolpe liudei, v neskromnom shume dnia, p. 60), written at about the same time, contains a much more beautiful and imaginative moon metaphor from the domain of sense, i.e., of sight and smell: "Night comes- and into the clean glass/It pours the holy oil, fragrant and amber-colored" (Nastupit noch'-i v chistoe steklo/Vol'et elei dushistyi i iantarnyi). The moon, usually associated with a round sphere, here turns into something like the "container and the contained" of pseudo-Dionysius. The eternal riddles of the world and of man are conveyed in the metaphor- ical images of the next poem (Cherez livonskie ia proezzhal polia), dating from the years 1830-37: I was driving through Livonia's fields Everything around me was so dismal... The sky's faded ground, the sandy earth- All this brought to my heart a mood of thoughtfulness. I reminisced about the past of this sad land- That bloody, gloomy time, When its young sons, stretched out upon the dust, Kissed the knightly spur. And, looking at you, desert river, And at you, oak grove on its banks, "You," I pondered, "must have come from far away, You, who are the same age as that past!" Yes, you alone succeeded To come down to us from shores of quite another world. Oh, if I could get an answer To a single question about that time! ... But your realm, oh nature, remains silent about days gone by With a smile, ambiguous, mysterious- Likewise will a boy, chance witness of night's charms, Not divulge them even in the light of day. (p. 79) 56 RMMLA BULE.TIN JUNE 1972</page><page sequence="3">THE METAPHORS IN TIUTCHEV'S PHILSOPHCAL POEMS Only the river and the oak-grove in the poem succeed in reaching us "from shores of quite another world" (s beregov drugogo sveta). In this metaphor the vehicle suggests the Lethe, the river of oblivion in the realm of the dead, according to Greek mythology. Immortal nature, a "sphinx," as Tiutchev calls it in another poem (Priroda-sfinks), is contrasted with mortal man. Tiutchev's tendency to reverse old established concepts is exemplified in a metaphor from the above poem as "the sky's ground" (grunt nebes). The vehicle "ground" is the carrier of Tiutchev's philosophizing. Applied to the cosmic body, the tenor, it indicates a reversed perspective. Around 1830, at the summit of his poetic activity, Tittchev wrote a poem which is extremely rich in metaphorical images: Insomnia The monotonous beat of the clock, Night's painful, wearisome story! A tongue likewise strange to all, Yet distinct to each, as one's conscience! Has anyone heard without anguish, Amidst the silent universe, The hollow groan of time, The prophetic voice that bids farewell? It seems to us: this orphaned world Was overtaken by some iron fate- And we, at war with all of nature, Find ourselves abandoned and alone; And our life is standing there before us, Like an apparition at the edge of the world, And, together with our age and our friends, Grows pale and dim in the gloomy distance. And a new, young generation Has meanwhile blossomed in the sun. But we, my friends, and our time Have long been covered by the snowdrifts of oblivion. (p. 58) This poem (the Russian title is "Bessonnitsa") contains some of Tiutchev's basic philosophical ideas. '"he monotonous beat of the clock/Night's painful, wearisome story!" (Chasov odnoobraznyi boi, Tomitel'naia nochi povest'!) is a metaphor from the domain of thought. The vehicle "story," in interaction with the still somewhat vague tenor, produces a metaphorical image which generates an air of fear and pessimism at the fugitive aspect of time and the ordeal of man's life-a concept close to Schopenhauer's philosophy. This idea becomes clearer as the metaphor develops. "A tongue likewise strange to all" (Iazyk dlia veskh ravno chuzhoi), i.e., time, is a simple noun replace- ment metaphor with animating qualities; the anthropomorphized image of time is further substantiated by the subsidiary metonymy 'The prophetic voice that bids farewell" (prorocheski proshchal'nyi glas). The vehicle creates the image of death by a "system of associated commonplaces" (as Max Black S7</page><page sequence="4">calls it in his book Models and Metaphors4), while the adverb in the Russian text (prorocheski, i.e., prophetic) suggests the idea of the inevitability of man's fate. The theme of orphanage is presented as a transferred epithet, another metonymical device: "It seems to us: this orphaned world/Was overtaken by some iron Fate" (Nam mnitsia: mir osirotelyi/Neotrazimyi Rok nastig). In the metaphorical image "And our life is standing there before us,/Like an apparition at the edge of the world" (I nasha zhizn' stoit pred nami/Kak prizrak na kraiu zemli) Tiutchev revives the sunken verb metaphor.5 It anthropomorphizes life via the concept of the duality of man-whose one part stands "at the edge of the world," a trope representing Tiutchev's concept of cllaos. The inserted simile "Like an apparition" (Kak prizrak) points us to Schelling's idea that the individual existence is untrue or unreal. Further on, "thle gloomy distance" (sumrachnaia dal') is a subsidiary metaphor which expands the image of Tiutchev's chaos. The vehicle is here taken from the (lomain of visual sense. By its associated commonplaces we identify gloominess witl night or, through the influence of Tiutchev's philosophy, directly with chaos. "And a new, young generation/Has meanwhile blossomed in the sun" (I novoe, mladoe plemia/Mezh tem na solntse rastsvelo) represents an unexpect- ed turn in the author's trend of thought, as well as a switch from darkness to light. The vehicle of the metaphor, "blossomed in the sun," is derived from nature, and the interaction of its vehicle and tenor conveys a dehumanizing quality to the young generation. It implies the merging of man and nature and reveals Tiutchev's strong cosmic feelings, his pantheism. The trope "But we, . . . /Have long been covered by the snowdrifts of oblivion" (A nas, . . . /Davno zabveniem zaneslo) is a transferred epithet which represents a cause-effect metonymy merged with the metaphor from the domain of nature. The vehicle "covered by snowdrifts" (zaneslo), through interaction with the tenor "man," causes a metamorphical, dehumanizing effect in man himself and creates the image of death and decay. The last image of the poem "Insomnia," "The metallic funeral voice" (Metalla golos pogrebal'nyi), is synecdoche as well as an animating metaphor. One of Tiutchev's faded metaphors is contained in the poem "Not cooled from the heat of day" (Ne ostyvshaia ot znoiu, p. 179), written between 1851-54.6 It reads, "The sky is full of thunderstorm" (Nebo polnoe grozoiu). Here, it is the adjective which represents the metaphor. Another poem, "Winter's rage is not for nothing" (Zima nedarom zlitsia, p. 117), dated 1837, 4Max Black, Models and Metaphors. Studies in Language and Philosophy (Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 1962). 'Henry H. Wells, in his book Poetic Imagery. Illustrated from Elizabethan Literature (New York: Russell &amp; Russell, 1961), p. 61 ff., defines the sunken metaphor as "one which powerfully affects the imagination without conveying a definite picture." These images often "approach but do not realize personification." 6The faded metaphor does not convey any definite picture, nor does it arouse the imagination, as Henry Wells points out in Poetic Imagery. 58 RMMLA BULETIN JUNE 1972</page><page sequence="5">THE METAPHORS IN TIUTCHEv's PHILOSOPHCAL POEMS contains an example of an emotional-descriptive metaphor: "the vicious witch" (ved'ma zlaia). This type of metaphor, however, as well as faded or sunken metaphors, are not characteristic for Tiutchev; the majority of his metaphors are functional. A complete merging of man and nature, the idea of pantheism, is remarkably well demonstrated in a poem from the year 1836 (Potok sgustilsia i tuskneet): The stream has thickened and grows dull, And hides below the solid ice, And color dies out, sound grows dumb, In that icy numbness,- Only the spring's eternal life The almighty cold is powerless to fetter: It flows on and on-and, murmuring, Disturbs the deathly silence. Thus in the orphaned bosom, Crushed by the coldness of existence, The rapid stream of youth Does neither flow, nor does it sparkle,- But underneath the icy crust There is still life, there is still murmur- And now and then one clearly hears The whisper of the secret spring. (p. 110) The metaphor 'The spring's eternal life" (Zhizn' bessmertnuiu kliucha), though placed in the literal frame of nature, is taken from the human domain. This lends to the "spring" qualities supposed to characterize the human soul. The metaphor gradually reverses the meaning of the poem and prepares for the allegory of the immortality of mankind as part of nature. The epithets describing the human condition are also drawn from nature, and through this transfer of epithets from one domain to another we obtain a complete inter- action between the two spheres-a total unity of man and nature. The following poem (Kak ni gnetet ruka sud'biny), dated 1830, contains several philosophical ideas again revealed through the microscopic lens of the metaphor: Although the hand of fate may oppress you, Although deceit may torment the people, Although the brow may be furrowed deeply And the heart be full of wounds; All those gruesome tribulations That may hold their sway over you- Yet what can resist the breath And the first touch of spring! Spring ... it is oblivious of you, Of you, of sorrow and of evil; Its shining gaze is filled with immortality And there is not a wrinkle on its brow. Obedient solely to its own commandments, At a predestined hour it descends to us, All light, and blissfully indifferent, As befits a diety. 59</page><page sequence="6">60 RMMLA BULLETN JUNE 1972 Not of the past do roses sigh, Nor does at night the nightingale sing, Aurora does not shed Her fragrant tears about the past,- And fear of the inevitable end Will not blow off a single leaf from trees: Their life, like that of boundless oceans, Is all poured out into the present. You, toy and victim of a personal life! Come here, renounce delusive feelings And throw yourself, cheerful, all-powerful, Into that life-creating ocean! With its ethereal water, Come, wash your suffering bosom- And of divinely-universal life Be a participant, if only for a moment! (p. 137) Man is here shown as "toy and victim of a personal life" (Igra i zhertva zhizni chastnoi). This is a replacement metaphor with two vehicles which, though essentially different, share the quality of lack of personal freedom, of helplessness. The vehicles in their given order imply dramatic development and point to man's ultimate fate. The tragedy of "the personal life," referring to the individual, is contrasted with the state of "that life-creating ocean" (sei zhivotvomyi okean). As before, the ocean stands for Tiutchev's concept of chaos, an image which is expanded by the subsidiary metaphor of "divinely universal life" (zhizni bozhesko-vsemirnoi). Tiutchev in his duality shows a strong desire to merge with nature, as well as an attraction to chaos. This is well illustrated in the poem "A Dream at Sea" (Son na more), dated 1828/29: The sea and the storm both were rocking our boat, And, drowsy, I yielded to whims of the waves. Within me there were two infinities Which wilfully played their game with me Around, like cymbals, the rocks clanked loud, The winds hailed each other, the billows sang. Deafened, I lay there 'midst chaos of sounds, But over this chaos my dream glided on. How painfully bright and enchantingly still It fluttered on lightly over thundering darkness. Yet through all my day-dreams, like a sorcerer's howl, I heard the roar of the ocean's abyss, And into the still realm of visions and dreams Tore the foam of the raging billows. (p. 61 ) Because of his duality the poet is unable to attach himself to either the realm of nature or to chaos, as the following metaphor shows: "Within me there were two infinities/And wilfully they played with me" (Dve bespredel'nosti byli vo mne/I mnoi svoevol'no igrali one). The "two-fold abyss" (dvoinaia bezdna) which in "The Swan" (Lebed', p. 88) only surrounds pure and</page><page sequence="7">THE METAPHORS IN TIUTCHEV'S PHLOSOPHICAL POEMS harmonious nature, here resides within man himself, though in him it is called "two infinities." The vehicle of this metaphor from the poem "A Dream at Sea," interacting with the tenor "man," points to Tiutchev's idea of the polarity of life, i.e., the opposition between the spiritual sphere and chaos. The "dream" and the "ocean" are both simple replacement metaphors which constitute subsidiary images of the primary metaphor of the "two infinities," since they relate to the same philosophical concepts. "hundering darkness" (gremiashchaia t'ma) and "the ocean's abyss" (puchina morskaia) share the tenor of the sea metaphor. Here it should be noted that Tiutchev's chaos to some extent corresponds to Schelling's concept of the universe as a non-rational being. The image of chaos in man's soul is further expanded in metaphors of other poems: "Silentium" (p. 72), dated 1833, and "About what do you howl, oh wind of the night" (O chem ty voesh', vetr nochnoi, p. 109), written in 1836. The first shows the interior of the soul as the source of all feelings and thoughts-partly a romantic conceit; but the second poem relates a communi- cation between the "night wind" and the "night soul." Though one is drawn from the natural, and the other from the human domain, these last two metaphors both point to the same tenor-chaos-by means of their respective vehicles. Tiutchev's thoughts about man's position in the world are reflected in several nature metaphors. In the poem "A Ray of Light" (Problesk, p. 48), dated 1826, man's spiritual longings are shown as unattainable because of his earthly bondage: "It is not given to the lowly dust/To inhale the heavenly flame" (I ne dano nichtozhnoi pyli/Dyshat' bozhestvennym ognem). In this figure of speech we actually have two metaphors contained in adjective-noun combinations. "Dust" and "flame" are definitional metaphors whose epithets, "lowly" and "heavenly," though expendable, still increase the feeling of distance between the natural and the spiritual spheres. Here man's state is as low as it possibly can be. In the 1837 poem "I sit here, thoughtful and alone" (Sizhu zadumchiv i odin), the metaphorical image of man seems to be somewhat raised again, but the contrast with his spiritual ego is omitted: Year follows year, age follows age ... Why is man so indignant, That earth-bound plantl .. He withers quickly, yes, so quickly, But each new year brings with it a new plant And a fresh leaf. Again there will be all that now exists, Again the roses will all bloom, And blackthorns too... But you, my poor, pale flower, No rebirth waits for you, You will not bloom again. (p. 114) In the metaphor "Why is man so indignant,/That earth-bound plant!" (Chto zh negoduet chelovek,/Sei zlak zemnoi!), the vehicle from the domain of 61</page><page sequence="8">RMMLA BULLETIN nature, "the plant," has a delhumanizing effect on the tenor, the hluman mass, whose existence, like that of nature, is constantly perpetuated. The following metaphor, however, shows an unexpected turn: "But you, my poor, pale flower,/No rebirth waits for you" (No ty, moi bednyi, blednyi tsvet/Tebe uzl vozrozhdenia net). This metaphor, though taken from nature, carries epithets from the human domain. Moreover, the vehicle "flower" possesses clearly individualizing features, as opposed to the equalizing nature of the grass. Thus the individual is not shown as sharing the continued existence assured to the human mass, but as doomed to perish. Three decades later, the poet is still trying to define man and his position in life. Man has revealed characteristics that only add ridicule to his low position. The poem "There is melody in the ocean's waves" (Pcvuchest' est' v morskikh volnakh, p. 244), dated 1865, finds man in a dualistic garb: "The thinking reed is grumbling" (Ropshchet mysliashchii trostnik). Expressed through a metaphor from both the human and the natural domains (i.e., a mixed metaphor), this unusual idea, which could almost be called a meta- physical concept, is of course borrowed from Pascal.7 "From the clearing a kite soared up" (S poliany korshun podnialsia, p. 107), written in 1879, carries still another image of man: "I, king of the earth, became rooted to the earth" (Ia, tsar zemli, priros k zemli). This metaphor, through the verb of the vehicle, "rooted," refutes the idea of freedom for man, a freedom which the poet qualifies as "illusory" (prizrachnyi). The metaphor is a pun on the idea of the oxymoronic relation between "king," a symbol of power and freedom, of oxymoronic relation between "king," a symbol of power and freedom, and "rooted," expressing man's bondage to the earth. One of Tiutchev's most characteristic philosophical metaphors is that of "day" in the poem "Day and Night" (Den' i noch'), dated 1839: Over the secret world of spirits, Over that nameless abyss, A gold-embroidered veil is thrown By the exalted will of gods. Day is that resplendent veil- Day, that quickening of mortals, That healing of the aching soul, The friend of people and of gods! But the Day fades away-the Night comes on, It has arrived-and, from this fatal world Having torn the blesed fabric of the veil, Having tom the blessed fabric of the veil, Casts it aside ... And now before us is exposed the abyss With all its horrors and its darkness, No barrier parts us now from it That's why we find the Night so fearsomle! (p. 139) The metaphor "day" is repeated in three different metaphorical structures. The first, "A gold-embroidered veil is thrown" (Pokrov nabroshen 7Pascal, "Les Philosophes", Pensees, Editions Gamier Freres (Paris, 1964), p. 162. 62 JUNE 1972</page><page sequence="9">THE METAPHORS IN TIUTCHEv'S PHILOSOPHICAL POEMS zlatotkannyi), is a simple replacement metaphor in which the tenor "day" remains unmentioned. The second, "Day is that resplendent veil" (Den'-sei blistatel'nyi pokrov), is a metaphor by apposition. In this subsidiary trope the vehicle of the primary metaphor, "veil," is repeated and substantiated. The third, "Day, that quickening of mortals" (Den', zemnorodnykh ozhivlenie), is a copulative metaphor. This second subsidiary metaphor comprises three vehicles. The vehicle of the primary metaphor "veil" belongs by association to the domain of the night; applied to the day, however, it points to a reversed perspective of the world on the part of the poet, an example of which has been given before. The cluster metaphor of the day is one of Tiutchev's most striking imaginative structures. The day is but a phantom to him, a golden veil that can be pulled away at will. Here we sense Schopenhauer's idea of the unreality of the "world of sensible phenomena," a concept which he in turn derived from Kant. "Over the secret world of spirits,/Over that nameless abyss" (Na mir tainstvennyi dukhov,/Nad etoi bezdnoi bezymiannoi) is a metaphor characterizing Tiutchev's night. This is the implied tenor within the surface context of the poem. Within the deeper meaning of the poem, the night represents the primordial forces of life which are characterized by irrationality. In Tiutchev's philosophy night stands for the basic substance of reality. Another interesting metaphor of the night, though not as deep as the above, is found in an earlier poem, written in 1830: "Like the ocean surrounds the terrestrial globe/All earthly life is enveloped in dreams" (Kak okean ob" emlet shar nochnoi,/Zemnaia zhizn' krugom ob"iata snami, p. 65). It reads: 'The night sets in-and with melodious waves/The element pounds against its shore./This is its voice" (Nastanet noch'-i zvuchnymi volnami/ Stikhiia b'et o bereg svoi./To glas ee). Here two metaphors are mounted one upon the other, which increases the sense of mystery and deepens the image. The first, the "element," is drawn from nature; the second, "its voice," is from the human domain. The idea of the unreality and futility of man's existence did not loosen its grip upon Tiutchev's mind. It found expression in many of his poems, of which "Wave and Thought" (Volna i duma, p. 178), dated 1852, is not the least important: Thought after thought, wave after wave- Two phenomena of one element: Be it inside the narrow heart, or in the boundles ocean, Always eteral surge and retreat, Always the same disturbingly empty spectre. 'lle metaphor "the disturbingly empty spectre" (prizrak trevozhno-pustoi), embedded in an allegory, stresses the unreality of man's thought and, by implication, of man himself. Another poem (Smotri, kak na rechnom prostore), written in 1851, expresses the same idea of unreality, although its metaphorical image differs: 63</page><page sequence="10">RMMLA BuLLETI Look, how on the river's wide expanse, Down the slope of newly quickened waters Into the all-embracing ocean Ice floe after ice floe drifts. All together-small and large, Having lost their former image, All indistinguishable like the element,- Merge into the fatal abyssl .. Oh delusion of our thought, You, the human Ego, Is not this your meaning, Is not this your destiny? (p. 175) The delusion of man's thought, the human ego, merges in an allegorical form with "the fatal abyss" (s bezdnoi rokovoi), just like the melted ice floes in the poem. Thus primordial chaos is described as the final destination of man. Here Schellingian tenets and the Indian philosophy of Nirvana have fused and have been transformed into an original Tiutchevian concept. One of Tiutchev's last major philosophical poems, "From that life which once abounded here" (Ot zhizni toi, chto bushevala zdes', p. 291), dated 1886, reverts to the enigma of man's unreality, as opposed to the all-pervading presence of nature: Nature has no knowledge of the past, Our shadowy years are quite unknown to it. And facing it, we vaguely realize Ourselves as being just a dream of nature. In this metaphor from the domain of thought, the vehicle "dream of nature" (greza prirody) once more points to the idea of the unreality of man's existence. Man is just a fleeting dream of nature, and the only reality to which he can turn is also expressed in the form of a metaphor: after his futile endeavors on earth man is received back by "the all-absorbing, peace-creating abyss" (vsepogloshchaiushchei i mirotvomoi bezdnoi) from which he came. This metaphor contains two vehicles-the idea-content of the first refers to the natural, the second to the metaphysical plane. Yet together they qualify the same tenor, chaos, which through interaction of both parts of the metaphor emerges as the elemental, universal force which perpetuates creation. For Tiutchev our soul is the Jungian world-soul; and for him the same chaos which forms the basis of his philosophy also characterizes man's own soul. Every man is subject to the eruption of his own chaos at any moment, because irrationality is the powerful element lurking under the delusively smooth surface of life. Despite all probing and searching of the mind, the mystery of the human being, the mystery of life, remains. Through his metaphorical unions of the natural and the supernatural, Tiutchev enables us to partake in his fascinating ideas and insights.
