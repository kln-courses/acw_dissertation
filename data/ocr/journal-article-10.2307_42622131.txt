AMICO Paris Bernard Palissy and "Saint-Porchaire" Ceramics The names ceramics two of groups traditionally "Saint-Porchaire" of sixteenth-century classified and under Bernard French the ceramics traditionally classified under the names of "Saint-Porchaire" and Bernard Palissy (Agen 15 io -Paris 1590) each merit the epithet "sphinx of French Renaissance ceramics." A rapport between the two work- shops has long been postulated but never ver- ified owing to limited knowledge concerning both types of production and the lack of even a single object from either group traceable through provenance to the sixteenth century. Furthermore, the works of both have been repeatedly doubted, with some suspicions that most, if not all, "Saint-Porchaire" ceramics are nineteenth-century inventions. Indeed, the two types of ceramics were repro- duced and imitated in the nineteenth-cen- tury Renaissance revival when Charles-Jean Avisseau and family, as well as Minton's of Stoke-on-Trent, linked the two in their ceramic output. Georges Pull, who may be responsible for many Palissy (and "Saint- Porchaire") ceramics currently mistaken for originals, likewise produced imitation "Saint-Porchaire" ceramics in the nineteenth century.1 The purpose of the present article is to secure the link between Bernard Palissy and "Saint-Porchaire" and to prove the sixteenth- century existence of some important pieces of "Saint-Porchaire" ceramics based on twen- tieth-century archaeological finds from the site known as the Paris atelier of Bernard Palissy. Historical Background The two types of ceramics occur side-by-side in sixteenth-century inventories of Anne de Montmorency's townhouse in the rue Saint- Avoye (du Temple), Paris. Anne de Mont- morency was a patron of many ceramists, including those of "Saint-Porchaire" as well as Bernard Palissy, Masseot Abaquesne from Rouen, and Guido Durantino of Urbino. The first inventory was drawn up in 1556, coinci- dent with the date of Palissy's first rustic ceramics and the year Montmorency intro- duced Palissy to Henri II and the cardinal de Lorraine. At least five works listed in the inventory are probably by Palissy: "deux bassins de terre en forme ovalle, esmailléz, avec plusieurs figures de toutes bestes rep- tilles...ung grand vaze de mesmes, en façon de drageoir...ung aultre petit vaze de mes- mes, en forme d'esguyère...une forme de rochier de terre esmaillée, où il y a plusieurs bestes reptilles."2 These same works, with slightly different descriptions, are repeated in another inventory of the same townhouse, made in 1568 after Montmorency's death in 1567. In addition, works labeled as "façon de Xainctes" or "ouvrage de Xainctes" were added. These may or may not have been made by Palissy, who began his ceramic career in Saintes, as no mention of rustic dec- oration is made. Listed in these inventories are works ten- tatively identified as what is now called "Saint-Porchaire." In the 1556 inventory, "Saint-Porchaire" ewer with anthropomorphic handle and animal spout, height 19 cm Musée National de la Renaissance, Château d'Ecouen EC. 83; photograph: Réunion des Musées Nationaux 27</page><page sequence="3">these are referred to simply as works made of clay from the Poitou; in the 1568 inventory, they are listed as "façon de Sainct Porchère/'3 The sixteenth-century inventory of Cather- ine de' Medici, queen of France, friend of Anne de Montmorency and a patron of Pal- issy, presumably alludes to works by Palissy, but whether this inventory includes "Saint- Porchaire" ceramics is subject to debate.4 Only one other sixteenth-century inven- tory refers to works by Palissy,- it is the only one to mention him by name and the only one to provide a link to nobles and prelates whom Palissy, Anne de Montmorency, and other patrons of "Saint-Porchaire" certainly knew. This is the 1590 inventory of the house of Bourgtheroulde in the Eure, pre- pared after it was pillaged. The house belonged to Claude le Roux, identified as "deuxième du nom, seigneur de Bourgthe- roulde et d'Infreville, Conseiller du Roi, et Maître ordinaire en sa Chambre de Comptes, Paris/'5 Claude le Roux had inherited the Hôtel de Bourgtheroulde, begun in Rouen in the late fifteenth century and largely rebuilt in the early sixteenth century by members of the le Roux family, from his brother Guil- laume III.6 Rouen was the home of Masseot Abaquesne, who created the tin-glazed floor for Anne de Montmorency's château at Ecouen in 1542 and in 1557 the march d'autel for the chapel of La Bâtie d'Urfé, loca- tion of the only fully intact sixteenth-cen- tury French grotto. Charles de Bourbon (1520-15 90), the archbishop of Rouen, had been bishop of Saintes (1544-15 50) while Palissy lived in that city.7 The list of damages records the following: "Grand nombre de grands bassins et vases de vaisselle de valleur, de la façon de Messire Bernard Palissy, de diverses coulleurs fort exquises, toute laquelle vaisselle valloit plus de cent cinquante escus, laquelle ils ont toute volée et brisée, sans qu'il en soit demeuré une pièce entière."8 While the Bourgtheroulde inventory is the only one of the sixteenth century to mention Palissy by name, two rare inventories men- tion "Saint-Porchaire," both from the Tré- moille family, who knew Palissy and who intermarried with the Montmorency and Gouffier families. The first is that drawn up in the family's château in Thouars upon the death of François de la Trémoille in 15 42. 9 The second was made in the same château upon the death of François' son Louis III de la Trémoille,10 under the direction of François de la Trémoille. In 1542 Palissy had redrawn the plans for the salt flats in the Saintonge, which had been improperly mapped several years earlier by François de la Trémoille.11 Twenty years later, when Palissy's Saintes studio, constructed for him by Anne de Montmorency, was ransacked, Palissy called upon members of the Trémoille family to tes- tify as to the original state of the works (paid for by Montmorency) in the ruined atelier. These were "deux frères de monseigneur de la Trémoille," the latter of whom was Louis III de la Trémoille.12 Claude Gouffier, who is associated with the Trémoille through his first wife (of five), Jacqueline de la Trémoille, owned the châ- teau of Oiron, where it was once believed that "Saint-Porchaire" ceramics were made.13 A connection between Gouffier and Palissy had been argued in the nineteenth century on the basis of a drawing for a grotto formerly in the Destailleur Collection.14 The drawing bears the enigmatic inscription, "Le portraict de la crotte rustique qui sera en terre environ quinze piet, et le tout sera faict de rustique, tant les animault que la massoneryere; et ladicte crotte a esté inventé par Madame la Grand."15 The drawing and the relationship of Palissy to Gouffier remain subject to spec- ulation, but there may be some evidence that Gouffier appreciated Palissy's rustic style: a small table fountain covered with lizards, frogs, and shells bears his motto, "Hie Ter- minus Haerat."16 The tradition of collecting "Saint- Porchaire" and Bernard Palissy ceramics con- currently continued in the eighteenth cen- tury, and the only inventory tracing an existing piece of "Saint-Porchaire" ceramic back to at least the eighteenth century is that of Horace Walpole,17 in whose collection works attributed to Palissy were also found. The ambiguity concerning whether Walpole knew that his French faïence was Palissean in style is due to his 1774 description of*the contents of Strawberry-Hill, which predated any systematic classification of French Renaissance ceramics and is imprecise even for Italian maiolica.18 Although Walpole himself never alluded to Palissy or to the term "French faïence" in his inventory, he had an interest in the Montmorency family and was familiar with the legend of Palissy 28 AMICO</page><page sequence="4">i .

The date of the auction catalogue, as well as the circum- stances eliciting the descriptions, leave ques- tions as to whether they could possibly have been accurate with reference to the French faïence. Ten ceramics in the sale were described as being by "Bernard Palizzi; known also as Bernard des Tuileries."20 The only rustic work was lot no. Found in the dairy, it was described as "a fine old enam- elled dish by Bernard Palizzi, ornamented with Frogs &amp;. c. in high relief;" it sold for £7. 21 Given that Walpole did not himself speak of Palissy, it is worth noting that the spelling used by the auctioneers in 1842 matches that on the Cellini cup made in 1839 by Jean- Pierre Nazaire and Antoine Benoît-Roch Marrei and exhibited in the Paris Exposition des produits de l'industrie of that year. A tribute to Renaissance revival, the cup included the names of Bernard Palizzi [sic], Lorenzo Ghiberti, Benvenuto Cellini, Michelangelo, and others along with their portrait busts in relief.22 A final collection of ceramics that dates back to the eighteenth century and is like- wise renowned for having included works by Palissy and "Saint-Porchaire" is that of Andrew Fountaine. Here, however, defini- tively tracing the provenance of one of these works as Sir Andrew's, rather than a later acquisition by his heirs, has not yet proven possible. The Twentieth-Century Finds Since the time of Horace Walpole's auction, enormous progress has been made in Palissy studies, for which many documents have long existed. Palissy himself wrote three books that touch upon his work. Archaeolog- ical remains of Palissy's Paris atelier were uncovered in the nineteenth century and again in the 1980s in the Cour Napoleon (Jardins du Carrousel) of the Louvre. Knowl- edge of Palissy, for whom there still exists no signed original, now far exceeds knowledge of "Saint-Porchaire." The details of the 1985-1987 Paris finds were reported in 1987, 1990, and 1992.23 Also in 1987, the first study devoted exclusively to Palissy's rustic ceramics - those that earned him the commissions for grottoes from Anne de Montmorency and Catherine de' Medici - was published, based on the nineteenth- AMICO 29</page><page sequence="5">century archaeological finds.24 One work, whose authenticity is beyond question, has since been added to the Palissy oeuvre as a result of the twentieth-century finds; the possibility of adding at least two others has been suggested.25 The unquestionable work now in Lyons, somewhat related to a mold found on the site and in perfect accord with unglazed ceramics also found there, may rep- resent one of the earliest of Palissy's rustic basins (fig. i). The same finds that cracked the riddle of one sphinx have helped crack another, that of "Saint-Porchaire." These results unequivo- cally prove a sixteenth-century origin for at least two, and possibly three, of the most important pieces in Paris. Before the presen- tation and discussion of these finds as they pertain to the ceramics of both "Saint- Porchaire" and Bernard Palissy, it is impor- tant to summarize several of the points that argue for a rapport between the two prior to these discoveries. 1. Among the patrons of both Palissy and "Saint-Porchaire" ceramists were the Mont- morency family: Anne de Montmorency for "Saint-Porchaire" as evidenced, for example, by the presence of his initial on the candle- stick from the Petit Palais (index 25), and Palissy as evidenced by the rustic ceramics recorded in his inventories as well as the grotto presumably intended for Ecouen; and the Montmorency-Laval branch of the family for "Saint-Porchaire" as indicated by its arms on, for example, the tankard from the Louvre (index 22) and a cup from the Hermitage (index 33), among others. Bressuire, about four kilometers from Saint-Porchaire in the Poitou (Deux-Sèvres), was a seigneurie of the Montmorency-Laval branch. In the same region is Thouars, where the aforementioned Trémoille family inventories were prepared. Palissy was familiar with Bressuire (although he never mentioned Saint-Porchaire even though there is another town by the same name just a few kilometers from Saintes): "Il me souvient avoir passé de Parthenay, allant à Bressuyre en Poitou, et de Bressuyre vers Thouars, mais en toutes ces contrées les terres argileuses sont fort blanches."26 2. Both ceramics may have been produced in roughly the same time period. It is known that Palissy was producing ceramics by the 1 5 40s and until at least the 1580s. The dates for "Saint-Porchaire" are less certain. Ber- 30 AMICO 2.

Both types of production have tradition- ally been linked to neighboring parts of southwest France, the Saintonge and the Poitou. Although born in Agen, Palissy lived in Saintes from at least the late 1530s until the mid- 1 560s. 4. Both used lead-based glazes,- "Saint- Porchaire" having an extremely limited color range and Palissy having an unlimited palette. Works of "Saint-Porchaire" with col- ored lead glazes are generally believed to have been influenced by Palissy, who took more pride in his translucent glazes than for his invention of rustiques figulines. 5 . The most curious evidence until now for a link between the two has been the appear- ance of small reptiles and amphibians on sev- eral pieces traditionally attributed to "Saint- Porchaire" despite their being characteristic of Palissy's repertoire. The most famous example is a fragmentary "Saint-Porchaire" platter (fig. 2; index 21) covered with the sacred monogram IHS and other decorative motifs typical of the "Saint-Porchaire" reper- toire. Otherwise nearly flat in its decoration formed by colored inlays, the work is deco- rated in the middle with a three-dimensional coiled snake eating a frog, which Gaston Migeon believed was cast from life.29 Else- where, a lizard steps on its own head and the field is scattered with other lizards, a small snake, and small frogs not cast from life. The exact provenance of this work is unknown, but most believe it to be an archaeological find - despite its mysterious and late appear- ance - particularly as it was accompanied by flat molds, one of which may have been used to produce the IHS monogram. The IHS monogram is found on other works, includ- ing the candlestick in the National Gallery of Art (index 52) and the cups in the Cleveland Museum of Art (index 38) and the Hermitage (index 32). While the animal repertoire is rep- resentative of Palissy's own, there is little relationship in scale and style between the sculpted animals found on "Saint-Porchaire" works and those of Palissy, molded from life. One notable exception is a basin in the Louvre, which shows a frog sculpted in the "Saint-Porchaire" style and is attributed to Bernard Palissy (fig. 3), in part on the basis of an argument for Palissy's atelier's style hav- ing become more sculptural with time.30 Other than this detail, the Louvre fragmen- tary platter, with its knotted snake, is closest to the rustic basin recently discovered in Lyons, which has been proven to be by Palissy (see fig. 1). Migeon saw in the Louvre fragmentary "Saint-Porchaire" platter, with its jaspered underside set against a cream-colored back- ground, "l'équivalent d'une signature" of Palissy, and "il me paraît fort admissible que Bernard Palissy ait lui-même fabriqué des pièces de ce genre, et le fragment qui vient d'entrer au Musée du Louvre vient appuyer cette hypothèse d'une singulière façon."31 Migeon's colleague M. E. Molinier was some- what more reserved, preferring to see in such a work "le témoignage de recherches qu'un savant aussi curieux que Palissy put tenter vers la technique de la porcelaine?"32 But in 1969, Henry-Pierre Fourest revived the hypothesis that Bernard Palissy may have had a role in the creation of at least some "Saint-Porchaire" ceramics.33 Some of Pal- issy's early works bear a relationship to the partially Gothic appearance of some "Saint- Porchaire" ceramics.34 A small rustic ewer by Palissy in the Louvre (fig. 4) is related to the mold for a rus- tic vessel emanating from the Paris atelier of Bernard Palissy and to the open-mouthed ceramic frogs found in the fountain area of the Cour Napoleon.35 A comparison between this work and the small "Saint-Porchaire" ewer in the permanent collection of Ecouen (fig. 5; index 13) suggests that the two works, the one fully Renaissance in appearance and the other bearing traces of a Gothic ancestry, are not as discordant as one might think. In Palissy's rustic ewer, the spout is formed by an open-mouthed frog; in the "Saint- Porchaire" ewer a fantastic, reptilelike crea- ture is found in the corresponding area. The frog on Palissy's ewer is balanced by a cray- fish (the . species once indigenous to the region where Palissy lived, now replaced by a heartier type) stemming from the handle and across the top to the frog. The fantastic beast on the Ecouen ewer is balanced by an anthro- pomorphic figure on the opposite side lean- ing forward over the top toward the beast. Both ewers are roughly similar in form. But for the moment the comparison goes no fur- ther, for Palissy transforms a utilitarian object into an illusionistic representation of amico 31</page><page sequence="7">4- Bernard Palissy and atelier, rustic ewer, lead- glazed ceramic Musée du Louvre, Paris M.R. 2337; photograph: Réunion des Musées Nationaux nature in which the body is formed of life casts of shells embedded into a jasper-colored surface suggestive of a crag, in a manner typ- ical of his work. Although found in invento- ries of private hotels in the sixteenth century, such objects may also have had a utilitarian use for Palissy, as suggested in the garden plan from his Recepte véritable : " Aussi audit rocher sera formé quelque espèce de buffet pour tenir les verres et coupes de ceux qui banquéteront dans le cabinet... aussi audit cabinet y aura une table de semblable estoffe que le rocher, laquelle sera assise sur un rocher et sera ladite table en façon ovale, estant esmaillée, enrichie et colorée de diverses couleurs d'esmail qui luiront comme un cristallin."36 The Jewelry Mounts Unknown before twentieth-century excava- tions is the fact that a ceramist, Palissy, was fabricating dinner services that included casts of Renaissance jewelry mounts, a com- mon motif found on "Saint-Porchaire" cer- amics. As in the works of "Saint-Porchaire," these were embedded into uncommon set- 32 AMICO</page><page sequence="8">5. "Saint-Porchaire" ewer with anthropomorphic handle and animal spout, height 19 cm Musée National de la Renaissance, Château d'Ecouen EC. 83; photograph: Réunion des Musées Nationaux tings. One example of Palissy's use of such jewelry casts is the handle of a spoon in which he has aligned one cast vertically and a second horizontally (fig. 6). One from among many examples of "Saint-Porchaire" ceramics that includes casts of jewelry is the candlestick in the Petit Palais (fig. 7; index 25). Although no exact parallels to the many jewelry molds (in both plaster and clay) found on the site have yet been discovered, they do resemble the jewelry designs produced by Jacques Androuet du Cerceau and Étienne Delaune.37 Delaune's design for a ring with a pointed diamond in a quatrefoil setting with double-arched divisions (fig. 8) bears more than a slight resemblance to the bague used as a ring held in the mouth of the lion on a Louvre salt cellar (fig. 9; index 18). Palissy himself decorated some of his ce- ramic grotto bricks with a pointed diamond motif in a quatrefoil setting with double- arched divisions. One such brick was found in the nineteenth-century excavations and engraved in Histoire général de Paris by Adolphe Berty and H. Legrand, but was sub- sequently lost.38 amico 33</page><page sequence="9">34 AMICO 6.

This motif led, in part, to Benjamin Fillon's argument that "Saint- Porchaire" ceramics were created at Oiron, where Claude Gouffier had an extraordinary library. Petits fers motifs were also found in the twentieth-century excavations of Palissy's atelier. It is known from his writ- ings that Palissy had access to an exceptional library since he made reference to Serlio, Vit- ruvius, Francesco da Colonna, Pliny, Pierre Belon, Rondelet, and alchemical treatises.39 Furthermore, while Palissy lived in Saintes, his best friend was the bookseller and pub- lisher Philibert Hamelin, who worked for John Calvin and regularly traveled between Geneva and the Saintonge until his execu- tion in 1 5 57. 40 A fragment decorated with arabesques (fig. 10) relates both to the technique used by bookbinders (using multiple impressions of the same motif to create a second motif) and to the technique used in the manufacturing of "Saint-Porchaire" ceramics, although it is unclear that the motif found on the site of Palissy 's atelier is from bookbinders. It can be proven, however, that the motif on this frag- ment was derived from the double impres- sion of a mold found also on the site (fig. 11). Although difficult to explain how a triangu- lar mold (with motifs in relief) was used to create an impression in the form of a paral- lelogram containing arabesques, it appears that the triangular mold was impressed twice in the same base clay before the impression was filled with clay of a lighter color. In one impression, the apex of the triangle was placed at the top of the clay slab; in the sec- ond impression, the mold was inverted. The resulting impression is a new motif, one that required the intervention of the potter to clarify the design. The potter had to efface parts of the double border that surround the three sides of the triangular motif found on the mold after the impressions; this awkward and laborious manner is typical of Palissy. It is quite possible that this particular fragment represents a shop experiment, since a trace of the double border still remains in thè upper left corner. The fragment does, however, pro- 36 AMICO 10.

X 731 vide evidence of someone trying to arrive at a finished "Saint-Porchaire" product. It testi- fies to the kind of trial-and-error effort that characterized Palissy in his early career, recounted in his Discours admirables. It is clear that the molds emanating from the site must be manipulated to correlate them with the motifs found on "Saint- Porchaire" ceramics and with sixteenth- century bookbinding motifs. One case reported here involves one of the most com- mon bookbinding motifs of sixteenth- century France and Italy, and is related to a motif found on many "Saint-Porchaire" ceramics. The motif (fig. 12) is a stylization of a sculpted leaf motif found on the tympana of French Gothic cathedrals and used in Venetian bookbindings. One version of this motif on a bookbinding (fig. 13) was dis- cussed by Jestaz, who also correlated "Saint- Porchaire" motifs with bookbinders' stamps.41 It is possible to produce a variant of this motif from inverted double impressions of the single circular motif found in Palissy's studio in a manner similar to the recon- structed process noted above. A double impression, with some modification, results in a double foliate scroll with a heart-shaped design in the middle.42 It is apparent on the binding that the rectangular exterior border was formed from multiple impressions of one stamp (which may in this case have been a double stamp), while the interior arabesque motif, with roughly rectangular borders, was formed by a combination of two versions of the same stamp: in the central part, the same stamp was used; in the corners and edges, near the border of the interior motif, a trun- cated version of this stamp was used. A six-petaled rosette (fig. 14) found on small terra-cotta molds, sample impressions, and a small fragment of unglazed ceramic appears very similar to motifs found on a "Saint-Porchaire" ewer ( biberon ) in the Petit Palais (fig. 15; index 27). The motif is impressed in at least two sizes. The slightly larger size of the motif as it appears on some finished "Saint-Porchaire" ceramics could be explained by the fact that, in the finished works, the originally flat motif was stretched to conform to a rounded shape. On the Petit Palais ewer, the center of the rosette is ser- rated - not perfectly round, as in the mold. This last difference could be accounted for by the intervention of the potter's knife, but amico 37</page><page sequence="13">38 AMICO 14.

This observation suggests that some of the decorative elements present on " Saint- Porchaire" ceramics were formed by thin, flat slabs of clay pressed into molds, inlaid with colored clay paste, and applied to the predetermined shape of the vessel. On a fired, unglazed "Saint-Porchaire" fragment of white base clay whose motifs are filled with dark brownish red clay and which was found on the site (fig. 16), the same six-petaled motif measures 1.1 centimeters in diameter, and a fragment of another mold appears to represent the same motif in a slightly smaller form than the rosette pictured at left in fig. 14. Under these circumstances, and allowing for different shrinkage rates between differ- ent clays, it is possible to state that molds and impressions of the "Saint-Porchaire" flo- ral motif found on the Palissy site are com- patible with the motif as it appears on at least some museum works.43 Another stylized vegetal motif commonly found on "Saint-Porchaire" ceramics is also represented in terra-cotta relief molds found on the site in two sizes (fig. 17). The clay- filled impressed quatre feuilles on the semi- finished fragment (see fig. 16) measures 0.45 centimeter, roughly corresponding to the smaller of the two quatre feuilles molds found on the site (see fig. 17), and corre- sponding exactly to the same motif as it appears on a bookbinding in the Bibliothèque Nationale (fig. 18). This binding is represen- tative of the medallion bindings made fash- ionable by Lyons artisans in the mid-15 50s.44 The medallions on this sixteenth-century amico 39</page><page sequence="15">20.

The binding also bears the arms of the Hérmand de Denouville family, known in the sixteenth century to be from the Poitou region, where some believe "Saint-Porchaire" ceramics originated.45 In addition to the individual impressions and molds of all these floral and leaf motifs, there exists what appears to be a mold in which the motifs have been combined and organized in bands capable of producing the impression shown on the semifinished frag- ment (fig. 19). Like this fragment, the mold is flat and might have been used to produce a plate with a slightly upturned rim. One plausible way of reconstructing the inlaid decorative process is to imagine the artist beginning with the bookbinder's iron with the rosette motif, for Palissy's impres- sions are not incised but are clearly the result of the clay being stamped by another, pre- formed object. With this iron, the potter makes an impression in clay, then uses this impression to make a clay mold, which would then have been used to make other impressions. This theory is in complete accord with the ceramic medallions found on the site, for which Palissy began with the originals in bronze and made terra-cotta molds in order to produce ceramic casts.46 In reference to the process used for making the impressed motifs previously described, the production of the semifinished fragment would have required multiple impressions and some modification before the final mold combining several motifs was manufactured. Considerable intervention on the part of the potter was necessary in the cutting of the impression and its fitting into a mold that would give the finished work its final form. Following assemblage of the body from numerous elements, additional relief motifs and structural elements, such as commonly found on " Saint-Porchaire" ceramics, would have been added before the work was glazed and fired.47 When speaking about his ceram- ics in the Discours admirables, Palissy gives a detailed account of the white clay of the 24. "Saint-Porchaire" ewer with serpent handles, lead- glazed ceramic, height 37.2 cm Musée du Louvre, Paris OA 10589; photograph: Réunion des Musées Nationaux 40 AMICO</page><page sequence="16">Poitou (where Saint-Porchaire is located), but in the context largely of the enormous prob- lems caused when he tried to combine it with other clays: he found that the white Poitou clay needed a firing temperature dif- ferent from that of the other clays and that when he combined Poitou clay with others his products were often ruined in the firing process. Migeon felt that such works were formed of clay from the Poitou, "une terre blanchâtre, peut-etre un peu kaolinique, d'une déplorable cuisson et qui s'exfoliait."48 Mold for a Dog and the Petit Palais Ewer In addition to the impressed motifs found on the Petit Palais ewer (biberon), applied deco- ration, such as the small dog ornamenting the handle,49 was also determined to bear a relationship to material emanating from Palissy's Paris atelier (fig. 20). A mold with the same motif (fig. 21) was excavated, pro- viding additional proof that "Saint- Porchaire" ceramics were made in the six- teenth century and providing another link between "Saint-Porchaire" and Palissy's Paris atelier. The dog on the ewer measures 4.5 centimeters from the tip of its tail to its extended left forepaw; that in the mold, in fine, light beige terra-cotta, measures 4.2 cen- timeters and is broken at the tail, presumably accounting for the difference in dimensions. Both have the same composition: a dog repos- ing, its head raised, with front left and rear right legs extended. In both, the back curves in one direction, while the tail curves in the other. Striations suggestive of hair emanate from the spine. The mold bears signs of wear, which may account for the smoothness of the head on the modern plastilene impres- sion taken from the mold (fig. 22). However, a beige terra-cotta cast of this same dog (fig. 23), found in the atelier and measuring 4.0 centimeters from the tip of the tail to the tip of the left forepaw, shows the hair striations on the head in a profile view as well as the same roughly rectangular ear that appears on the dog of the Petit Palais ewer. This dog from the Palissy site, cast in the sixteenth century, exemplifies the product at the moment it was removed from the one-part mold, exhibiting no undercutting and with extra clay still connected to the head, before it was reworked and applied to a finished ceramic.

A terra-cotta mold, decorated with the same serpent-head motif (fig. 25) found twice on the rim of the Louvre ewer, atop the snakelike handles (fig. 26), was also excavated. In a contemporary plastilene impression of the serpent head (figs. 27-28), the head measures 3.3 centimeters from the tip of the mouth to the back of the brow,- the body is incomplete. Both heads on the Louvre piece and the head in the mold all have the same deeply furrowed brows that drop very sharply to a shallow snout on either side before terminating in the nostrils bordered by an upturned lip, although the lip is visible only on the left side of the impression. Other details are shared, including the eye sacks and the large, S-shaped ripple between these and the lip. The mold displays no portion of the shell bitten by the serpents, as depicted on the Louvre ewer. One plausible explanation is that the serpent heads were cast separately and then added on top of a molded seashell, which was then cut and bent to the form now seen on the Louvre ewer. Molds and casts of 42 AMICO 26. Detail of "Saint- Porchaire" ewer, fig. 24, showing serpents' heads Musée du Louvre, Paris OA 10589; photograph: archives départementales</page><page sequence="18">large shells made from life were found on the site.51 If one of these, or one like them but now lost, from the Palissy atelier had been used for the shell on the Louvre example, or if a snake cast from life had been the source of the handles, considerable intervention would have been required on the part of the ceramist to smooth out certain portions, such as the snake's scales, in order to accom- modate the necessary shape. Such a process is in perfect accord with Palissy 's techniques. As is well known, the ewer seems to have been inspired by an Enea Vico print, dated 1543 and, according to Vico, derived from antiquity (fig. 29). The relationship between the Louvre ewer and the Vico print is evident not only in the snake handles and the masks but also at the base of the shell, which has been altered from the life-cast into a scroll as found on the print. But the remainder of the shell's form follows the life-cast molds found on the site rather than duplicating Vico's print, which shows a shell unnaturally elon- gated to form a spout. Mold for a Fantastic Reptile and the Ecouen Ewer The final example of an excavated mold that bears a relationship to a finished "Saint- Porchaire" work concerns the Ecouen ewer 29. Enea Vico, design after an antique vase with snake handles, 1543, engraving Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris EB 1 1 AMICO 43</page><page sequence="19">( aiguière ) and two fragments of a terra-cotta mold of a scaled, fantastic beast (fig. 30). The relationship here is less clear, complicated in part by its fragmentary nature: the mold is missing the head, the upper portion repre- sents only the body and one webbed foot, and the lower portion represents both sides of a sinuous tail and terminates in a webbed foot. The profile of the beast on the Ecouen ewer shows two webbed feet and a sinuous tail on a scaled body (see fig. 5). The scales in the mold have a single dot in the middle, not found on the beast from the Ecouen piece. Either this is not the mold, or the impression was greatly reworked, as is suggested by the entire body of the beast on the finished product. The question can be raised as to whether the shallow depth of the scale con- tours in the mold were adequate to catch the paste of red clay responsible for the scales on the Ecouen example, or whether the scales were added after the pressing, as they were in the Louvre piece. It should be borne in mind that the petal striations evidenced in the mold of the six-petaled floral motif did not reproduce well in the semifinished fragment of "Saint-Porchaire" bearing that motif from the site (see fig. 16). It is likely that the petal striations were removed from the fragment after recesses in the white body clay had been filled with iron-rich clay paste and during the scraping of the surface to eliminate excess colored, inlay clay. A similar problem could have resulted in the removal of the dot found on the mold for the beast but missing on the Ecouen ewer. Where the upper part of the mold for the beast's body terminates, there are strands of sculpted hair similar to those on the Ecouen beast, and the head, missing in the mold, seems to be a relief motif added by the potter (just as the serpents' heads were attached to the shell on the Louvre ewer). As noted in the spoon handle (see fig. 6), such a combination of various parts of separate figures was not alien to Palissy. Conclusion The "Saint-Porchaire" molds and impres- sions emanating from the excavation site of the Paris atelier of Bernard Palissy prove beyond any reasonable doubt the sixteenth- century existence of at least two important examples of "Saint-Porchaire" ceramics: the 30. Bernard Palissy and atelier, mold with motif of fantastic beast, unglazed terra-cotta, length 11.7 cm Musée National de la Renaissance, Château d'Ecouen EP 1837; author photograph Louvre ewer (index 23) and the Petit Palais ewer (index 27). It is highly likely that molded elements from the Ecouen ewer (index 13) are also represented in the finds. The molds and impressions establish a stronger rapport between "Saint-Porchaire" ceramists and Bernard Palissy than was pre- viously believed. Other questions subsequently open for con- sideration can be but tentatively answered: 1. Do the present finds change traditional and hypothetical dating of "Saint-Porchaire" ceramics? 2. Was Bernard Palissy creating "Saint- Porchaire" ceramics? 3. Do these finds argue for a Paris rather than a provincial origin for "Saint-Porchaire" ceramics? It can be safely said that the contact between Palissy and the "Saint-Porchaire" 44 AMICO</page><page sequence="20">ceramists has been established, and it is pos- sible to hypothesize that the influence was reciprocal. This mutually beneficial relation- ship is clearly evidenced in shared decorative motifs, which are not restricted to the petits fers decorations that probably originated in the "Saint-Porchaire" rather than Palissy ate- lier. Either Palissy or " Saint-Porchaire" ceramists first introduced casts of jewelry motifs derived from du Cerceau and perhaps Delaune. Rustiques figulines are another dec- orative motif shared by both workshops, although generally recognized as less atten- tive to nature than the life-casts of Palissy. If the "Saint-Porchaire" ceramists were not being influenced directly by metalwork from Wenzel Jamnitzer or Giulio Romano, then it was Palissy, the "Inventeur des rustiques figulines du Roy et de la Reine mère du Roy" who influenced "Saint-Porchaire" ware since at least 1555/1556, when he produced his first perfected rustic basins. A comparison of the range of styles in the applied figurai elements that appear on "Saint-Porchaire" ceramics and those on Palissy's rustic ceram- ics reveals an evolution from the indigenous, Gothic animal style to the natural style of Palissy's most well-known works, probably derived from the influx of Italian sculpture and ceramics and/or German metalwork into France at that time. Regarding dating, Jestaz stated, "Il serait difficile de croire qu'un seul homme ait put oeuvrer de 15 10 environ à 1570 au moins, mais il aura suffi d'un fils pour assurer la continuité de l'atelier."52 It is unlikely that Palissy is this son, and the Paris finds present a paradox with specific datings within that suggested range. If the hypothesis that the monogram G on the Louvre ewer stands for Gilles II de Montmorency-Laval (rather than Claude Gouffier as once thought) is correct, then the proposed date of between 1550, based on the first appearance in French pat- tern books of the petits fers motifs relating to this work, and "1559, date approximative du décès de Gilles II de Montmorency-Laval,"53 conflicts with that assigned to the Paris ate- lier of Palissy by archaeologists. Based on excavated coins, they believe his atelier was active 1565/1566 to 1584/1590.54 But this would not be the first paradox raised between the dating of the site and the ceramic materi- als found there, the most curious being the terra-cotta mold of the arms of Françoise de Brosse (certainly by Palissy), who married Claude Gouffier in 1545 and died in 1558. Such inconsistencies are resolved by an idea originally proposed by Louis Dimier that Palissy transported his Saintes atelier with him to Paris and that this atelier would have included material from the unfinished grotto for Anne de Montmorency.55 A broad sam- pling of all Palissy's ceramic history may also have been among the materials transported from Saintes, including the early ceramic medallions made while he lived in Saintes and some of the molds in use for "Saint- Porchaire" ceramics, as both were found on the site. In Palissy's early ceramic career in the Saintonge, he often fired his works in the kilns of other potters. All the above could be interpreted as se- curing a date after the 1540s for the Louvre ewer and the Petit Palais ewer and probably the Ecouen ewer if the relief molds related to these works were in Palissy's hands while he lived in the Saintonge and were subsequently taken by him to Paris when he established himself in the Tuileries. If this supposition is untrue, and if Palissy himself made or acquired these molds while in Paris, then the dates of these works would have to be after 1565/1566, and subsequently after the death of Gilles II de Montmorency-Laval. While pondering these paradoxes, one might do well to reexamine the tired subject of the rapport between "Saint-Porchaire" motifs and bookbindings. It is unclear, how- ever, whether this relationship can clarify the dating problem or the problem of origin, except in rare instances such as with the Lyons invention of the medallion bindings or the later fashion of fanfare bindings. Re- garding the other petits fers motifs, the prob- lem (and the history of French bookbinding) is more complicated: stamps were first pur- chased from Venetians, later recreated and altered on French soil, and the same petits fers were repeatedly sold and reused again and again as each bookbinder purchased the contents from the studio of another deceased bookbinder. As to whether Palissy was making "Saint- Porchaire" ceramics, there is an unmen- tioned complication: Palissy himself never alluded to these ceramics, and Palissy never failed to mention his successes. Indeed, the only ceramics aside from his own and those of Girolamo della Robbia that Palissy men- AMico 45</page><page sequence="21">tioned were those of Beauvais, ceramics that may have been also manufactured at Chapelle-des-Pots, where Palissy regularly fired his works, and fragments of which were found on the Paris site.56 What Palissy may not often have mentioned were his failures; only this can explain the fact that in the Dis- cours admirables he makes no allusion to his grottoes, for which there is in fact no evi- dence of their ever having been completed. If, as once suggested, it took the intervention of an architect such as Philibert de l'Orme to influence the design of "Saint-Porchaire" ceramics,57 this architect might have in some instances been Palissy. When paid in 1 564 for the Montmorency grotto, he was called " architecte et ynventeur des grot es figulines de Monseigneur le Connestable," and when arrested in 1586, he was described as "archi- tecte en oeuvre de terre/'58 It is difficult to imagine Palissy working cooperatively with anyone for extended pe- riods, let alone rival potters. He fought bit- terly with his wife, whose only known name is that given her by Palissy himself: "my second persecution." As early as 1555 there was a warrant for his arrest; by 1562 he is reputed to have hacked sacred images in the Church of Saint Eutrope in Saintes, and the disgruntled parishioners, in turn, vandalized images Palissy was fabricating for the grotto of Anne de Montmorency, one of whose offi- cial tasks it was, in fact, to eliminate the Protestants. Arrested, the stormy Huguenot called all the priests "pimps" during the court proceedings in Bordeaux. By 1563 - the year Recepte véritable was published - Palissy was probably already preparing for a break with Anne de Montmorency. In 1563, Palissy made overtures to François de Mont- morency, whom Protestants anticipated would be more tolerant than his father, and to Catherine de7 Medici.59 He fought with Philibert de l'Orme in the Tuileries, labeled the work that inspired the fountain portion of his grotto (the Songe de Poliphile) "perni- cious," and disparaged Girolamo della Rob- bia, whose works clearly influenced his. Palissy fled Paris in the wake of the Saint Barthélemy massacre and obtained his long- sought-after refuge in the town of Sedan, where he appears to have fought bitterly with many and where he was excluded from par- ticipating in Protestant services. By the 1580s, "Montpalissy," his home in Sedan, lay in ruins because he reneged on the promised dowry for the marriage between his daughter and a merchant, which included the very tools and molds of his trade. Thus, it would be characteristic of Palissy to have engaged in a period of close coopera- tion with the potters of "Saint-Porchaire," followed by the inevitable storm after which they would be excluded from his repertoire and from his writings. In this hypothetical case (one among many), the "Saint- Porchaire" molds and impressions found in Palissy's Paris atelier are archaeological curiosities, appropriately inconsistent with the dating of the site and representative of a 46 AMICO</page><page sequence="22">fragmented past that, by pure chance, consti- tuted a major archaeological find from the sixteenth century. The influence and ramifi- cations of this excavated material will inevitably lead to the rewriting of sixteenth- century ceramic history in France. As to the question of origin, had Palissy not documented his life in Saintes, one could mistakenly conclude that such innovative works, including his rustiques figulines and ceramic grottoes, could have been produced only in Paris, not in the provinces. It must be remembered that it was part of Catherine de7 Medici's reconciliatory policy to integrate provincials into court life60 as well as to dif- fuse mounting tensions between Protestants and Roman Catholics, as evidenced in her court festivals. Furthermore, it is clear from his remarks about Girolamo della Robbia that Palissy himself was accustomed to using clays from different parts of France: "le te confesse que cest Italien estoit homme excel- lent en son art, mais en cest endroict fufaute de philosophie, ou bien de l'indigence, ou faute d'experience, a causé ce mal qui est, que n'ayant point congneau, ny approuvé auparavant les terres de Paris, ou environ iceluy, ou bien n'en pouvant recouvrer d'autre, il faict son oeuvre d'icelle, sans avoir esgard à l'advenir."61 The question of origin, nevertheless, may remain unresolved, and for this I defer to my colleagues with one cautionary remark: molds and clays were as portable in the six- teenth century as they are now. amico 47</page><page sequence="23">NOTES I extend my sincerest thanks to the director and staff of the Musée National de la Renaissance, Ecouen, especially Hervé Oursei, Thierry Crépin- Leblond, and Fabienne Audebrand, and to the Ser- vice régional de l'archéologie, île de France, Jean- Claude Blanchet, Pierre-Jean Trombetta, and, by affiliation, Dominique Poulain.

Even Palissy's famous life-cast of a human being, intended for his grotto and discovered in the nine- teenth century, suggests a combination of Renais- sance naturalism and Gothic stylization by the fact that its legs are crossed, as so often appears in full- length sculpted figures on the façades of French Gothic cathedrals, such as the one at Senlis.

See Palissy, Recepte véritable, in France 1880, 133-136. 41. Jestaz 1975, 387. Historians of bookbinding gen- erally refer to this iron as one decorated with two circles united by an arabesque. For example, see Jacques Guignard, "Premières relieures parisiennes à décor doré: De l'atelier des reliures Louis XII à l'atelier du Maître d'Estienne ou de Simon Vostre à Pierre Roffet/' in Humanisme actif: Mélanges d'art et de litérature offerts à Julien Cain (Paris, 1968), 230. 42. The inverted (or reverse) mold required for the second impression has yet to be found in the twentieth-century excavated material. Size differ- ences in the motif as found on the ceramics and bookbindings may be negligible. It should be borne in mind that the Paris atelier represents only one of Palissy 's studios. 43. Some "Saint-Porchaire" works used variations of the same motif, plausibly emanating from the work- shops of different bookbinders. As a case in point, it should be noted that the rosette motif on the bottom flange of the Louvre salt discussed earlier (index 18) is distinguished from those found on the Palissy site not only by size but also by the fact that the petals are not uniformly spaced but divided, almost imper- ceptibly, into two groups of three petals, as in a fer used by Simon Vostre. See Guignard 1968, 230. 44. British historians of bookbinding refer to these motifs as four dot motifs, but the Bibliothèque Nationale's term, quatre feuilles, is more appropriate since the center is surrounded not by four dots but by small ovals that are indeed suggestive of stylized leaves. See Anthony Hobson, Humanists and Book- binders (Cambridge, 1989), 136-140. 45. Perhaps it is no coincidence that the quatre feuilles bookbinding motifs were found on the same site as Palissy's ceramic medallions, one of which includes a bust of Henri II, the bronze prototype for which is in the Bibliothèque Nationale and is dated 1554. This is not the same medallion that appears on the binding, but could it have appeared on others? 46. Palissy began making such medallions, often based on originals by artists such as Leone Leoni and Jacopo da Trezzo, about 1549. For a repertoire of Palissy's medallions and a discussion of this medal- lion, see Dufaý et al. 1987, 51-56. 47. Multiple processes were used in the manufacture of "Saint-Porchaire" ceramics. See Daphne S. Bar- bour, Shelley G. Sturman, and Pamela B. Vandiver, "Technical Appendix II: The 'Saint-Porchaire' Ceramics," in Distelberger et al. 1993, 267-280. These processes are in perfect accord with those used by Palissy, as suggested by the archaeological evidence, including the fact that Palissy used clay skins added onto keyed, clay substrates, as demon- strated in the grotto fragments. 48. Migeon 1896, 386. Once sufficient objects are analyzed, it is likely that some of Palissy's ceramics will be found to have the same composition as "Saint-Porchaire" ceramics. Pierre Munier, working with the nineteenth-century finds, analyzed several Palissy clays. A white clay, analyzed by Munier, is very similar to published analyses of "Saint-Porchaire" ceramic compositions. See Pierre Munier, "Contribution a l'étude des céramiques de Bernard Palissy," Bulletin de la Société Française de Céramique , no. 3 (1949), 37. 1 am grateful to Shelley Sturman and Daphne Barbour for bringing this study to my attention. 49. Another example of a ewer [biberon) with a small dog ornamenting the handle and bearing a great resemblance to the Petit Palais dog was at one time in the Pourtalès Collection. Based on his viewing of the lithograph in Henri Delange and Carle Delange, Recueil de toutes les pièces connues jusqu'à ce jour de la faïence française dite de Henri II et Diane de Poitiers (Paris, 1861), Fillon believed that the handle and dog were restorations. See Fillon 1864, 94. The Pourtalès ewer was sold at Sotheby's, Monaco, 5 December 1987, lot 294. 1 am grateful to Timothy Wilson and Daphne Barbour for bringing other works with the dog motif to my attention. 50.

"Il y en a une espèce à Savigny en Beauvoisis, que je cuide qu'en France n'y a point de semblable, car, elle endure un merveilleux feu, sans estre aucunement offensée, et a ce bine là, de se former autant tenue et deliée que nulle des autres,- et quand elle est extrêmement cuitte, elle prend un petit polissement vitrificatif, qui procède de sons corps mesme; et cela cause que les vaisseaux faits de ladite terre, tiennent l'eaux forte autant bien que les vaisseaux de verre," Palissy, Discours admirables, France 1880, 366. Marie- Juliette Ballot, La Céra- mique Française (Paris, 1924), 7-8, hypothesizes that some of the ceramics now called Beauvais could have been manufactured at Chapelle-des-Pots, where it is known that Palissy fired some of his works. She points out that Chapelle-des-Pots derives its name 50 AMICO</page><page sequence="26">from a chapel erected in 1320 by the chapter of Saintes for area potters. She also maintains that the works in the Montmorency inventory listed as "façon de Saintes" could, in fact, be works made at Chapelle-des-Pots. 57.

For evidence of why Protestants anticipated François de Montmorency would be more tolerant than his father, refer to Palissy's preferatory dedica- tions accompanying the Recepte véritable. 60. A related phenomenon occurs in the nineteenth century in the story of Charles-Jean Avisseau, prac- ticing only in Tours but patronized by the court of Napolean III in Paris. Part of his launching to fame was the result of the work of Charles-Philippe de Chennevières, who visited Avisseau in Tours in his capacity as inspecteur des musées de province under Napoleon III. De Chennevières' efforts may fall into a broader political effort to fortify the centralized government in Paris by an appeal to provincial sup- port, which included a campaign to encourage, in turn, provincial talents. Philippe de Chennevières also contrasted the moral character of such provin- cial artists as Avisseau - a combination of quiet nobility, pride, tenacity, self-sufficiency, and an abil- ity to "lutter contre l'isolement" that preserved their innate warmth - to that of Parisian artists, weakened by their struggle to "lutter contre la foule" and who "mourraient é tiques et glacés" should they ever encounter the obstacles overcome by those of their compatriots living far away from the protectionist atmosphere of the Parisian art crit- ics. He had a genuine concern also for the isolated artist working in a "terrain ingrat ét abandonné," initiating a system of grants in the 1870s by which artists could travel and organizing the Inventaire général des richesse d'art de la France, which con- tinues to bridge the cultural gap between Paris and the rest of France.
