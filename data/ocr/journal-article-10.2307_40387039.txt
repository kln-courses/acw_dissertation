<plain_text><page sequence="1">Archaeol Oceania 31 (1996) 103-124 Birth of the Rainbow Serpent in Arnhem Land rock art and oral history PAUL S.C. TAÇON, MEREDITH WILSON AND CHRISTOPHER CHIPPINDALE Abstract The Rainbow Serpent is agreed to be one of the most powerful, all consuming and widespread Ancestral Beings of Aboriginal Australia. It pervades not only oral history but also ceremony, per- formance and visual art, and is associated with great acts of cre- ation and destruction. Although Rainbow Serpent imagery varies, its supernatural nature is usually emphasised by its form, often through the incorporation of attributes derived from a variety of natural creatures. Rock paintings of the Being are scattered across the continent but a particularly large sample can be found in west- ern Arnhem Land. We analyse 107 of these in detail and note vari- ation across both time and space through the use of multivariate statistical techniques. We hypothesise about the origins of the old- est images and compare key elements of Rainbow Serpent stories to those of 'Yam Style' Rainbow Serpents, reputed to be 4000-6000 years of age. It is our contention that an archaeological context for many of the more significant aspects of Rainbow Serpent oral history can be found over several millennia. Imagine that global warming has occurred on a grand scale. Everywhere coastlines are being drowned, and people are fleeing inland. The climate has become wet- ter. With the rains the previously parched interior springs to life. Landscapes become carpeted in green, and snakes emerge from the ground to escape the floods. Waterholes fill to the brim, while formerly dry creek beds turn into raging torrents that sweep away everything in their paths. Blinding flashes of lightning, booming crashes of thun- der and howling winds wreck havoc with the land and all its inhabitants. Along the coast, strange creatures are washed up on shore. But high up in the sky, sometimes before, sometimes after a storm, there appears a great serpent-like form full of elemental colour. A rainbow is born and soon more rainbows appear and travel across the land, heralding at once both great acts of creativity and destruction. Change is literally in the air. Old land- scapes are destroyed while new ones are born. Every liv- ing creature is somehow affected. In a sense this story repeats itself every year across the Top End of Australia's Northern Territory with the PSCT: Anthropology, The Australian Museum, College St., Sydney 2000; MW: Archaeology and Natural History, RSPAS, Australian National University, Canberra; CC: Cambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, Cambridge U.K. Email for PSCT:pault@amsg.austmus.gov.au. arrival of the monsoonal wet season, in a rhythmic cycle of climate change that has ancient roots; it began between 15,000 to 7000 years ago during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition (see Taçon and Brockwell 1995). It was only well after the end of the last ice age, at about 6000 years ago, that sea levels sta- bilised and the present climatic regime was established. And at about this time the first depictions of Rainbow Serpents, great composite beings with supernatural sig- nificance, appeared on rock shelter walls and ceilings. These fantastic works of rock painting are the oldest known surviving forms of one of the world's most pow- erful mythological creatures. Indeed, they are evidence of one of the oldest continuous religious traditions (Chaloupka 1984:41). Today the Rainbow Serpent enjoys renewed popularity as a uniting symbol for Aboriginal people across Australia. It is also popular for non-Aboriginal people as a dramatic subject in bark or paper paintings or as a powerful symbol for those fol- lowing New Age philosophies (Taylor 1990:329). And as we will show, the Rainbow Serpent has played a major role in Arnhem Land society throughout this period. But just how much of the Rainbow Serpent religious com- plex can we safely say had its origins up to 6000 years ago and what changes have occurred over time? Are we able to find archaeological evidence of key aspects of oral history in Arnhem Land that have great antiquity? If that is possible, can we find the very origins of Rainbow Serpent imagery? Distribution of Rainbow Serpent beliefs The rainbow has long fascinated the peoples of the world, and among many cultures it is described as a great mythical serpent because of its form and colour. John Lowenstein (1961) has documented serpent beliefs asso- ciated with the rainbow throughout the Pacific, Africa and South America and concludes 'myths of a giant rain- bow-serpent are common among primitive tribes inhabit- ing the tropics. Outside the tropical belt the rainbow-ser- pent concept is hardly to be found' (Lowenstein 1961:37). He notices how the distribution of the myth corresponds with the distribution of the Boidae family of snakes, which includes large pythons and boas. As well, the mythical Snake's 'association with rain and the rain- bow may indeed have its origin in the brilliant colours 103</page><page sequence="2">and iridescent glow of most of these imposing reptiles, in their aquatic habits, their capacity to climb trees, and, last not least, in their habit to hibernate and reappear after the first seasonal rains' (1961:38). In Australia, A.R. Radcliffe-Brown (1926) was the first to document the distribution of various indigenous Rainbow Serpent myths; others, such as Mountford (1978), have since more fully described them. Radcliffe- Brown, drawing on early ethnographic accounts gathered from all areas of the continent, concluded: There is found in widely separated parts of Australia a belief in a huge serpent which lives in certain pools or water-holes. This serpent is associated, and sometimes identified, with the rainbow. In many instances it is also associated with quartz-crystal, doubtless from the pris- matic colours visible in the latter. Now rock-crystal, in a great number of Australian tribes, is regarded as a sub- stance of great magical virtue, and is constantly made use of by medicine-men. Hence the rainbow-serpent may come to occupy an important place in the beliefs and cus- toms relating to medicine-men and the practice of magic (1926:19). Radcliffe-Brown also argued 'those few places in which the water never entirely disappears may quite jus- tifiably be regarded as being the permanent dwelling- place of the spirit of water as represented by the rain- bow-serpent' (1926:24-25). Spencer recorded much the same among the Kakadu people he encountered in 1911, and so did Taylor among the Kunwinjku in the early 1980s. Spencer was told the rainbow seen in the sky is the Iwaiyu, or soul/spirit, of the Rainbow Serpent; when it disappears it has returned to the Serpent underground (1914:326). Spencer also highlights the association between medicine-men and Rainbow Serpents, stating 'they alone are supposed not only to be able to see him, but to have eyes that can withstand his glance; other natives are unable to do this' (1914:295). Contemporary Kunwinjku conceptions Among the Kunwinjku of western Arnhem Land, and many of their neighbours, dozens of Rainbow Serpents are said to populate the landscapes that make up their homelands. Two different types of Rainbow Serpents are consistently described or referred to in their mythology, oral history, performance and painted art. As Luke Taylor (1990:330) notes: Kunwinjku use the English term 'rainbow' to describe two distinct mythological beings. One of these, Yingarna, is described as the original creator being, the 'first mother' of all subsequent beings. In some myths, Yingarna's first born is said to be a male rainbow called Ngalyod, followed by a female spirit called Ngalkunburriyaymi. Ngalyod is equivalent in some respects to the Borlung of Dangbon mythology. Ngalyod features most prominently in the myths for the creation of particular sacred sites or djang in western Arnhem Land, although the names Yingarna and Ngalyod may some- times be used interchangeably. Berndt and Berndt (1970:20), Hiatt (1971), Maddock (1970), Taylor (1990) and others have noted that both Rainbow Snakes are androgynous or bi-sexual to some extent; androgyny features in Rainbow Serpent mythol- ogy throughout Arnhem Land. Taylor (1990:331) has also described the different ways in which they are said to have created landscapes. For instance: In some versions of these creation myths, Yingarna is described as having travelled with the Nakorrkko father and son, the creator heroes whose journey is celebrated in Kunabibi and Yaburdurrwa (Berndt and Berndt 1970:123). This journey is cited as the basis for the links between sites throughout western Arnhem land. However, the myths which relate to the creation of specific sites often take the form of an ancestral being meeting, and arousing the anger of, Ngalyod who proceeds to 'swal- low' them. The swallowing metaphor is used to describe the act of transformation into features of landscape. Thus Yingarna is associated with creation of sites at the macro- cosmic level, while Ngalyod is said to be involved in more specific creation stories. It should be added that Ngalyod is associated with 'seasonal fertility through the creation of rain' and that 'During the dry season the rainbow is said to inhabit deep waterholes, and water lilies on the surface of the water indicate its presence. The figure is often painted with water lilies on its back to indicate this manifesta- tion' (Taylor 1990:331). In the sequence of Rainbow Serpent rock paintings plants sprouting from Rainbow Serpent bodies are found from the beginning - the incorporation of plants is not a recent innovation but an essential feature of the complex. An Arnhem Land artist who frequently emphasises the composite nature of Rainbow Serpent depictions is Bardayal Nadjamerrek, from near the Liverpool River. Many of his Ngalyods have water lilies growing out of their backs. He brings varied animal species into his images. As Margie West (1995:25) notes in editorial comments: There are a number of important Rainbow Serpent sites on the Liverpool River at Ankung Djang in Bardayal's Mok clan estate. Here there are freshwater crocodiles, file snakes, waterlilies and turtles which are all species belonging to the Duwa moiety. By constructing his Ngalyod forms with the body parts of these different species, Bardayal illustrates the Rainbow's transforma- tional aspects perhaps better than any other artist. Rainbow Serpents in the rock art of Arnhem Land The oldest well-described body of rock paintings from western Arnhem Land consist almost entirely of large naturalistic animals. The next phase, known as Dynamic Figure art (Chaloupka 1977, 1984, 1993a, 1993b), is dominated by human figures. Animals are often shown in some human context or relationship; mythological beings, human-like figures with animal heads, are por- trayed for the first time. The following phase 104</page><page sequence="3">(6000-4000 BP) sees the incorporation of floral motifs, such as yams, water lilies and other food plants, and the first composite Rainbow Serpents appear in the art record (Tacon and Chippindale 1994). These creatures have snake-like bodies, macropod or flying fox heads, three types of tails, and a variety of plant and animal appendages. Yams, water lilies, anthropomorphs, fruit bats, birds and geometric designs are associated with them. Subsequent depictions of Rainbow Serpents are equally elaborate and various. Today these Beings con- tinue to be painted on sheets of bark and paper; the sto- ries of them describe the creation of landscapes, animals and Aboriginal people (Taylor 1990; West 1995). We aim to delineate the attributes that define Rainbow Serpents, chart geographical and temporal change, note differences between 'male' and 'female' forms and remark on the significance of these unusual and powerful paintings. We also hypothesise about the origin of Rainbow Serpent imagery and compare key features of the rock art to those described in oral history. Five key questions arose from these aims, as well as from observations in the field: (1) Do Rainbow Serpent paintings become more varied or heterogenous over time, and do they change in size? (2) Is there régionalisation on a grand scale within any period of Rainbow Serpent painting? (3) Are there differences within particular regions, such as between Jim Jim Creek and Twin Falls Creek, in the centre of Kakadu National Park? (4) Do differences in Rainbow Serpent rock paintings occur at the local level, for example, on either side of Twin Falls Creek? If so, what may account for sig- nificant differences? (5) Are different types of Rainbow Serpents depicted that are not a function of space or time? For instance, are there differences related to gender, as with Yingarna and Ngalyod stories? By answering these questions, we not only better describe one of the least understood phases of Arnhem Land rock art but also show that there are archaeological contexts for some core elements of contemporary Rainbow Serpent cosmology. Furthermore, we suggest the unusual Rainbow Serpent image may have a sound basis in the natural world. Multivariate Analysis Multivariate statistical analysis, as applied to Pacific (Wilson 1994) and Australian (McDonald 1994) rock art, is well suited to analysing the varied and composite nature of Rainbow Serpent imagery. Initially, we had four main objectives. The first was to delineate the attributes1 that define Arnhem Land Rainbow Serpents depicted in the rock art. Second, to chart their geographi- cal and temporal change. Third, to establish whether functional differences, such as gender, are coded in the attributes which make up Rainbow Serpents. And, fourth, to remark on the significance of these powerful and unusual paintings. The sample The sample consists of 107 individual Rainbow Serpent rock paintings. Fifty-nine of these derive from Paul Taçon's slide collection at the Australian Museum (from field studies between 1985 and 1994). Others are from publications by Eric Brandi (1982 [13]), George Chaloupka (1993a [6]; Chaloupka et al 1985 [1]) and Darrell Lewis (1988 [14]). During a 1995 field expedi- tion to Arnhem Land by Gundjeihmi elder David Canari, Taçon, Chippindale and Wilson, an additional 14 were documented and later analysed. The sample was sub-divided into three temporally defined groups based on chronologically identifiable attributes that relate to styles described by Chaloupka (1984, 1993a, 1993b), Chippindale and Taçon (1993), Taçon and Chippindale (1994), Haskovec (1992) and others: Dynamic (c. 1 0,000 BP) 1 Yam (c.6000-4000 BP) 61 Modern (c. 4000-present) 29 Unknown 16 Total 107 One Dynamic Figure image of a snake (Brandi 1982:16) was included because of its unusual size in relation to nine male and female Dynamic human figures it is shown interacting with, and because of an unusual bulge at its neck. Unique in this style, and not necessar- ily a Rainbow Serpent, this figure does not share charac- teristics of other images but was suggested to be a Rainbow Serpent by Brandi (1982:16) because of the nature of the composition. Sixteen Rainbow Serpents were placed into an 'unknown' category because they exhibited attributes from both the Yam and Modern period. It was hypothesised that many of these might be transitional between Yam and Modern specimens and it was hoped that the results of the analysis would shed light on their temporal placement. Attribute selection Attribute selection involved collating many and varied attributes. A large number of attributes generates a data set sufficient for manipulation, and gives protection against the bias that can arise through selecting a few attributes only. One criterion used for the selection of an attribute was its occurrence as a recognisable unit two or more times. 1 Attributes are defined here as units that cannot be sub-divided into logically or empirically smaller characters. 105</page><page sequence="4">Size attributes were available for only about two-thirds of the sample so they were not included in multivariate analyses. For Rainbow Serpent paintings where size measurements were available it was found that average size increases with time. Yam Rainbow Serpents are gen- erally smaller than Modern, in terms of mean length, mean width and in surface area (maximum height versus maximum width at right angles). After eliminating attributes pertaining to size a list of 137 attributes was assembled (see Appendix 1). This list was arranged in an hierarchical manner such that each attribute fell into one of eight main attribute groups: 1 . General physical attributes 2. Appended straight or meandering lines 3. Tail' 4. 'Body shape' (for instance, coiled, straight, arched) 5. 'Body' design (for instance, barbed edge, scalloped edge) 6. Technique of painting (for example, outline with infill, solid area) 7. Infill 8. Associated (neighbouring or attached) fea- tures (within 30 cm from any point of the Rainbow Serpent). Statistical procedures Each Rainbow Serpent was described in the form of binary data. In this case ones and zeroes were used, Τ indicating the presence and Ό' the absence of the attribute. This type of data is analogous to multiple-choice data in the standard form (Nishisato 1994: 24). A set of questions is asked within each of the eight attribute groups - for instance, spiked taii?, pointed tail?, other? - and only one answer is possible for each Rainbow Serpent. Multivariate analysis was selected as the most suitable means for exploring the similarities and differences between the recorded data. The multivariate technique best suited to multiple-choice data is Correspondence Analysis (CA), a 'specially weighted version of Principal Components Analysis' (Wright 1992: 30). It is a thor- oughly established technique, applied in the general field of statistics (Benzecri 1992, Nishisato 1994) as well as in archaeology (Baxter 1994). The correspondence algorithm measures the chi- squared distance relationship between variables (attrib- utes) and objects (Rainbow Serpents). The generated scores can be presented in the form of scattergrams, which portray objects and variables in the space of up to four vectors. Two scattergrams are generated - one for objects and the other for variables. Mutual examination of these is required for interpretation. Phenetic similarity, that is, overall similarity, is measured by the distance between points. Results Five Correspondence Analyses were undertaken. The results are presented and discussed with reference to the scattergrams of object scores although the full range of scattergrams is not published here. Correspondence analysis 1 : variation over time The first analysis calculated the correspondence between 107 Rainbow Serpents and 137 attributes. In figure 1, each Rainbow Serpent is displayed as a symbol that indi- cates which temporal period it belongs to. In the overall distribution of points Yam Rainbow Serpents form a rela- tively dense cluster on the left of the graph plane; Modern figures are comparatively dispersed and predominate on the right; unknown figures form a central and essentially overlapping cluster. The single Dynamic Figure of the sample has plotted close to the axes' centroid (0,0). 8 -ι 1 6- 4 -- s s 2- χ . ■ 0 .«^V '.-Ο ■ x ffi œ -2 -- a œ = œ s -4 -I 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 -2-1012345 • Yam a Modem χ Unknown ° Dynamic Figure 1. Object scores in relation to time, x-axis: correspondence axis 1 ; y-axis: correspondence axis 2. Note that Yam period Rainbow Serpents cluster to the left and Modern to the right. An explanation for the low score (close to 0,0) of the Dynamic figure is that it is not a depiction of a Rainbow Serpent. Since it lacks what we may term 'diagnostic' attributes - ones which clearly distinguish Rainbow Serpents from other painted subject matter (for instance, a macropod-like head) - it may have been intended as a depiction of an Ordinary snake'. Chaloupka (1993a) also believes it not to be a Rainbow Serpent; suggesting the thickening at the snake's neck represents skin being shed, he believes it probably is a large python. One explanation for the overall distribution shown in Figure 1 is that the two groups (Yam and Modern) are being distinguished on the basis of their styles and that the unknown group is essentially indeterminate. Indeed, 106</page><page sequence="5">Figure 2. Example of a Yam Rainbow Serpent (50 cm χ 24 cm) close to the central origin. the unknown specimens have a combination of Yam and Modern attributes. An alternative interpretation is that the placement of the Yam group as a coherent cluster on the left and the Modern Rainbow Serpents on the right shows elapsing time. If this is the case, the Unknown group, which is situated between the Yam and the Modern, could be interpreted as chronologically interme- diate. Absolute dates for different members of the Modern and other samples would provide a better foun- dation for the suggestion that we are viewing a temporal seriation from left to right, and ongoing research is addressing this. However, all that can be said at this point is that Rainbow Serpent rock paintings known to have been produced this century lie towards the far right end of the Modern distribution. If Rainbow Serpents vary much with time we can investigate chronological relationships between Rainbow Serpents at a. much finer scale than that which is avail- able from existing chronological divisions. For instance, in Figure 1 the Yam figures (6000-4000 b.p.) may lie at coordinates which reveal information about their chrono- logical relationship to each another, as well as other tem- poral groups. Yam figures on the left of the graph may be prototypes for unknown and modern figures on their right. Furthermore, there may be temporal differences between Yam figures themselves, between those closest to the central origin (Figure 2) and those further away (Figure 3). A further implication of this result is increasing varia- tion over time. Although Yam figures have a greater number of attributes describing them as a group, they are far more aggregated (that is there is less variation between points) than their modern counterparts, because they are much less varied. This is supported by their degree of dispersion relative to other groups. It can also be seen that objects from the Unknown group are clearly not as aggregated as the Yam group and not as dispersed as the Modern sample, a pattern which accords well with the notion of increasing variation over time, as well as the hypothesis concerning the transitional status of Unknown specimens. A statistical randomisation procedure was used to determine the significance of this impression of increas- ing variation over time. SHUFDIS 1, a program compati- ble with MV-Nutshell, calculates the mean inter-object distance (MIOD) for a category (in this case individual time periods, eg., Yam), then randomly assigns that cate- gory over the whole sample and re-computes the MIOD. This procedure is performed 999 times to produce a result which shows how often the degree of aggregation displayed on the object graph was exceeded for each cat- egory, a measure of how probable it is that aggregations have occurred by chance. The randomisation results confirm that Categories 1 and 2 (Yam and Modern) are clustering in a statistically significant way. Within the Yam group (category 1), the 107</page><page sequence="6">Figure 3. Example of a Yam Rainbow Serpent (67 cm χ 37 cm) further away from the central origin. 108</page><page sequence="7">actual MIOD (0.784) is less than the shuffle mean MIOD value (1.700). As there were no occasions when the shuf- fle degree of clustering was more than the actual degree of clustering, there is less than a 1 in 1000 probability of that degree of aggregation occurring by chance. For the Modern sample (category 2), in all 999 occa- sions the shuffle degree of clustering was more than the actual degree of clustering: there is less than a 1 in 1000 probability of a dispersion this large occurring by chance. For the Unknown group (category 3), the actual MIOD value of 1.231 falls within the first confidence interval in which there is a 1 in 10 probability of obtain- ing this degree of aggregation by chance. When this lower statistical significance for the Unknown category is weighed against the high signifi- cance of the remaining two categories, it is reasonable to see an increase in the variation between Rainbow Serpents over time. If the Unknown category consists of transitional specimens, then they are less likely to make a coherent and aggregated group. Correspondence analysis 2: variation in space The second correspondence analysis examines similari- ties and differences between Rainbow Serpents in rela- tion to space. Our specific interest was whether geo- graphic distance between Rainbow Serpents correlates with their phenetic differences. We predicted that Rainbow Serpents closest together in space would be most similar. Taçon (1993: 112) has defined seven 1000 square kilo- metre sample areas which encompass three linguistic groups (Jawoyn, Gundjeibmi, Gagudju/Mangeridji/Kunwinju, Figure 4); 101 of the Rainbow Serpents come from these areas. Six Rainbow Serpents paintings derive from an eighth sample area, directly east of area 7 (KunwinjKu/eastern Kuninjku). Figure 5 displays the correspondence between Rainbow Serpents according to the three language zones. Since the correspondence axes do not correlate with 'region', a homogeneity between Rainbow Serpents is apparent across space. Similarly, the correspondence relationships between Rainbow Serpents do not correlate with the 8 arbitrarily defined regions in Western Arnhem Land (see Figure 6). The randomisation procedure described above - used to test the statistical strength of this interpretation - confirmed an absence of correlation between the corre- spondence axes and region displayed in Figures 5 and 6. Further correspondence analyses were used to test whether regionalism occurred within the different time periods (excluding the Dynamic period for which only one sample was available); similar results were obtained. We find no evidence that Rainbow Serpents painted dur- ing the Yam, or any other phase defined for Western Arnhem land rock art, varied between language groups or regions.

Possible explanations are that the Modern sample is too small and/or that the Yam sample is too old for current linguistic boundaries to be of use. Alternatively, the greater degree of heterogeneity in the Modern sample may reflect differences between individ- ual artists' styles within linguistic boundaries so that dif- ferences between linguistic divisions cannot be easily dis- criminated. Indeed, field observations, multivariate analyses and discussions with Aboriginal elders all sug- gest that Rainbow Serpents were painted by a wider range of people in recent times than during the Yam period. 109</page><page sequence="8">β 6 ■ * 4 - o o ' *#$'&amp;. ζ s ° ■2- . χ - S -4-1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 -2-1012345 ° Réglons 1-3 = Regions 4-6 χ Regions 7-8 Figure 5.

This was undertaken because of observed similarities between the rock art of each river system in the field and in order to compare localised, neighbouring groups of paintings. The sample includes 35 Rainbow Serpents with 98 attributes; 23 derive from Twin Falls Creek (coded 4X'), and 12 derive from Jim Jim Creek (coded Ύ'). The pattern of resem- blances reveals no identifiable differences between the Rainbow Serpents from the two river systems (Figure 7). Correspondence analysis 4: variation between the two banks of a river system The fourth correspondence analysis compares Rainbow Serpents on either side of Twin Falls Creek. The sample includes 22 Rainbow Serpents with 73 attributes, 11 from the bank west and south of the creek (coded XI), 11 from the north and east (coded X2). The distribution seen in Figure 8 shows there is a distinction between Rainbow Serpents from either side of Twin Falls Creek. Those from the western and southern sides are also more dispersed (that is, there is greater distance between their represen- tative points), showing a greater variation between Rainbow Serpents there than on the northern and eastern sides. Are the location differences at Twin Falls Creek real, or are they just a response to the inclusion of the Modern specimens in the statisti- cal analysis? Recalling the results of the temporal analysis (Figure 1 ), Modern specimens are struc- turally more varied than the older Rainbow Serpents. To test this, Modern specimens were omitted from the Twin Falls Creek sample, and correspondence was tested for Yam figures alone (68% of the Twin Falls sample). Apart from a single X2 outlier, a similar pattern to that of Figure 8 was found. Again, XI specimens are sit- uated further from each other than X2 specimens, indicating greatervariation between them. Figure 7.

The differences between Rainbow Serpents are according to tail type. Figure 10. Correspondence between Yam Rainbow Serpents at Twin Falls Creek according to tail type without tail attrib- utes included, x-axis: correspondence axis 2; y-axis: corre- spondence axis 3. The tail attributes were omitted for this analysis and differences between Yam Rainbow Serpents on either side of the creek are no longer identifiable. Results of a randomisation procedure sup- ported the significance of the aggregation of Rainbow Serpents found north and east of Twin Falls Creek: there is a 1 in 1000 probability of a chance result. The west and south (X2) group dispersion was not as significant: there is a 1 in 10 probability of a chance result. The Twin Falls Creek results are interesting for three reasons. First, earlier results have not discriminated between Rainbow Serpents on the basis of regional differences within Western Arnhem Land. Yet there is a geographical aspect to the placing of Yam Rainbow Serpent depictions. These figures and their attributes segregate into two groups relating to their location on either bank of Twin Falls Creek. Second, this contextual difference exists over a considerable period of time, for the same pat- tern is seen in the ancient and the Modern fig- ures. This contrasts with the correspondence pat- terns obtained for the entire Western Arnhem Land sample which correlate strongly with tem- poral differences and do not show regionalism. Third, there is an interesting relationship between the dual cluster and different tail attrib- utes. Having established that regionality is rele- vant to the patterns associated with the Twin Falls Creek Rainbow Serpents and that time is not, an investigation of the sample according to tail variants was conducted. For both the entire Twin Falls sample (which includes specimens from the Yam and Modern periods), and the Yam sample alone, the corre- spondence patterns reveal aggregations which accord with tail type differences (Figure 9). These aggregations occur regardless of temporal differ- ences (that is, across all time periods). When the tail attributes were omitted and the analysis was performed again a dual cluster was no longer apparent. In other words, the separation of Rainbow Serpents into two groups is principally due to tail differences displayed by the images on either side of Twin Falls Creek (see Figure 10). A randomisation test on tail categories within the Yam figures at Twin Falls Creek revealed greater significance for the aggregation of pointed tail than spiked tail Rainbow Serpents. This implies that the attributes which charac- terise pointed tail Rainbow Serpents (including the pointed tail) form a more distinct, and possi- bly more easily identifiable, group. Ill</page><page sequence="10">Correspondence analysis 5: tail type at regional level A fifth analysis was undertaken to determine whether the tail type aggregations occurring at a local level also existed at a regional level. Correspondence results obtained for the entire Western Arnhem Land sample reveal no correlation between tail type and region. Discussion of results Rigorous statistical methods and the use of repeatable rules for determining similarity and difference have pro- vided a solid means for exploring diversity within three dimensions of Rainbow Serpent rock pictures found in Western Arnhem Land - time, space and structure. The results indicate: 1 . There is an increase in variation, from homogeneity to heterogeneity, of Rainbow Serpent depictions over time, from Yam to Modern. Size also increases over time. 2. Across western Arnhem Land there is no large scale regional variation between Rainbow Serpents from any period. 3. Within region 3, which includes Jim Jim and Twin Fall Creeks in central Kakadu, Rainbow Serpent rock paintings are essentially homogeneous, with only slight variations between the groups from the two river systems. 4. At Twin Falls Creek the Rainbow Serpents south and west of the river are more varied than those found north and east. Most of those from the south and west have pointed tails while those from the north and east have spiked tails. Are these differences functional? Do they reflect differences in local landscapes or con- texts? Are we seeing differences related to individual or clan art styles? Or is there something else going on that relates to two different categories of Rainbow Serpents, such as male versus female? 5. At a local level, within the Yam and Modern samples there is clustering according to tail type. Pointed tail Rainbow Serpents are clustering together in a statisti- cally significant way, while the Rainbow Serpents with other tail types are not. This clustering is inde- pendent of time and linguistic boundaries. Therefore, some other factor, such as gender, may be operating to indicate that at least two different types of Rainbow Serpents have been painted throughout the sequence, just as contemporary oral history tells us for the most recent period. Perhaps the dual Rainbow Serpent concept of mother and son has been emphasised from the beginning and is not simply a contemporary component of Rainbow Serpent cosmology. Importantly, in 1994 Gundjeihmi elder David Canari immediately volunteered that two Yam Rainbow Serpents painted next to each other were of different genders, when we first came across the site: the Serpent with a pointed tail was female, that with a spiked tail was male (Figure 11). Senior Kunwinjku bark painter Bardayal Nadjamerrek (in West 1995:25) has remarked similarly, stating that barbed or spiked tails indicate the potential malevolence of Rainbow Serpents, a male attribute. At many rock art sites we have noted the similarity of spiked Rainbow Serpent tails and painted crocodile tails. Figure 1 1 . Adjacent pointed and spiked tail Yam Rainbow Serpents (each 128 cm in length), Upper Twin Falls Creek. Aboriginal elders claim male and female versions are shown side by side. 112</page><page sequence="11">Furthermore, when the scutes of an actual crocodile are seen from the side they curve up and out in a similar way. Pointed Rainbow Serpent tails most closely resem- ble painted snake tails and many are described as such by bark painters (see examples in West 1995). In oral history, the crocodile, violence and destructive acts (including the disregarding of important cultural norms) are associated with the male domain of the world while the snake, birth and great acts of creation are more often associated with the female realm. This is emphasised in some origin stories about Rainbow Serpents and croco- diles (Taçon 1989b:265-67). The origin of Rainbow Serpent imagery Today there is no denying that Rainbow Serpents are composite beings. Was this always true? Certain features of the Rainbow Serpent resemble plants and animals: the head appears similar to that of a macropod, the pointed tail similar to a snake tail, the spiked tail reminiscent of a crocodile tail, and there are yam and water lily-like attachments. But might they originally have been mod- elled on an unusual actual species of animal found in the Arnhem Land region? Certain repeated features in the oldest examples made us think that Rainbow Serpents were being painted to a schema that was based on an actual real-world creature. Consistently repeated features include the length/width ratio of body parts, the curving tail, the head angled at ninety degrees to the body, the cross-hatched matrix at the neck and tail, the tubular, bobbled snout, a curved, outward extension of the belly above the tail and the macropod-like head. As we examined Rainbow Serpents more closely, becoming increasingly familiar with their constituent parts, certain features (such as the tubular nose and the head tucked down toward the chest) did not correspond morphologically with features of the species - croco- diles, macropods, snakes - they have been thought to represent. These unusual elements of early Rainbow Serpents are found in members of the sea-horse and pipe- fish family, Syngnathidae. The seahorse has a distinctive tubular snout that widens toward the mouth, a head angled at 90 degrees to the body, a brood pouch near the tail, and a prehensile, curving tail with a matrix-like design - all features of the Yam Rainbow Serpent form. Sea horses are small creatures, a matter of a few cen- timetres long, but Rainbow Serpents are painted large, a matter of many centimetres and quite large compared to other painted subjects. Yet there are far greater numbers of small Rainbow Serpents amongst the early Yam fig- ures than within the Modern sample, leading us to con- sider that the early impetus for the Rainbow Serpent may indeed have stemmed from the Syngnathidae family. As the multivariate results have demonstrated, the Yam Rainbow Serpents contain less inherent variation than their modern counterparts, which seems to indicate that the artists were painting to a particular schema - per- haps to represent anatomical features of Syngnathidae. Over time anatomical changes in Rainbow Serpent images occurred; painted Rainbow Serpents increased in size and more crocodile features were added, including teeth in the most recent depictions. In order to test this aspect, a final series of multivari- ate analyses were undertaken. The aim was to investigate the relationship between painted depictions of Rainbow Serpents and 'actual' creatures extant in the landscape in which Rainbow Serpent paintings are found (for a simi- lar analysis see McDonald 1983, 1993). The idea stemmed from the striking resemblance between many Rainbow Serpent images and seahorses, as noted above. After consultation with marine biologist John Paxton at the Australian Museum in Sydney, we noticed even stronger similarities between Yam Rainbow Serpent images and pipefish, in particular, the Ribboned pipefish Haliichthys taeniophorus. The Ribboned pipefish (Figure 12), first brought to sci- entific attention by J.E. Gray in 1859 (39, Plate. 7), is found around Irian Jaya and northern Australia, from Shark Bay, Western Australia to the Torres Strait, northern Queensland. Specimens have been collected off the north coast of Arnhem Land and the Cobourg Peninsula. One of the largest pipefish, it reaches lengths of up to 300 mm. Its body is irregularly blotched with dark brown, 'sometimes with indications of narrow dark bars crossing dorsum and upper part of side of body' (Dawson 1985:95). It has rela- tively short, strong and mostly recurved head and body spines, another frequent attribute on Yam Rainbow Serpents. There are two long ear-like projections similar to those of Yam Rainbow Serpents. Trailer-like appendages and a dorsal fin accord well with Yam Rainbow Serpent features (compare Figure 3 and others to Figure 12). As with other pipefish, it is the male that incubates the eggs in a ventral brooding pouch. Something resembling this fea- ture is often found on Yam Rainbow Serpents and, of course, both the creative and androgynous nature of the Being is continually emphasised in the recent oral history. How much of the exotic reproductive story of the pipefish/sea horse would be known to Aboriginal people? How much has emerged only through intense recent nat- ural history studies? We really do not know but could there still be a link between this pipefish (Figure 12) and the earliest depictions of Rainbow Serpents? In order to test the statistical strength of the correspon- dence between Rainbow Serpents and pipefish we added a number of species found in the natural environment to the sample, including seahorse, crocodile, snake and kangaroo. All of these creatures exhibit features which appear incorporated into the Rainbow Serpent image in certain ways, with the crocodile and snake both featuring in Rainbow Serpent mythology. Pipefish The result of the pipefish analysis, represented as a scat- tergram (Figure 13), situates the pipefish at the periphery of the Yam cluster. The addition of the pipefish to the 113</page><page sequence="12">Figure 1 2. Three views of a Ribboned pipefish, Haliichthys taeniophorus, col- lected near Darwin, N.T.

Below: Close-up of tail showing spikes. sample slightly alters the overall phenetic relationships between Rainbow Serpent images, but not significantly enough to force a reconsideration of earlier interpretations. Statistically, a close phenetic relationship is seen between the Yam Rainbow Serpents and the pipefish. In a temporal interpretation, the peripheral location of the pipefish to the left of the Yam cluster points to the Rainbow Serpent image deriving much of its form from the pipefish, and from a temporal perspective suggests that the yam figures on the far left of the graph were conceived first. However, mutual examination of the object and variable graphs (Figures 13 and 14) generated from this analysis suggests we should not over- estimate the amount of information we can derive from the multivariate object result. Given that every specimen within the sample consists of a number of attributes, and that the correspondence algorithm determines the rela- tionships between each of these attributes, the relative scores for each pipefish attribute need to be examined before proposing that a discrete combination of pipefish attributes are among proto-typical elements of the Rainbow Serpent image. The attributes which characterise the pipefish are not clustered at the periphery of the distribution, but hold values which span the graph vicinity occupied primarily by Yam Rainbow Serpents. It is therefore reasonable to propose that the Rainbow Serpent form was in some way inspired by the pipefish, but over time, the elements contributed by the pipefish were superseded. A good interpretation of the significance of the statistical similarity between the Yam Rainbow Serpent and the pipefish, and the lack of variability between them compared to the rest of the sample, is that the artists responsible for creating the Yam Rainbow Serpent were adhering to a design schema which accurately represented certain physiolog- ical features from the pipefish form. Following the Yam period, the physical components of the Rainbow Serpent image became less structured; the artists were no longer depicting as closely features found in the natural environment. Crocodile Unlike the pipefish, the crocodile has plotted at the top of the graph (Figure 15), isolated from any particular chronological group of Rainbow Serpents. Its marginal location might be due to the tendency for the correspondence algorithm to emphasise rare attributes. One rare attribute is 'crocodile hind legs and claws' which is not found among Rainbow Serpent images. Other crocodile attributes cluster quite close to 0 on the X-axis and between 0.5 and 3 on the Y-axis, in an area of the graph shared by an approxi- mately even number of specimens from each temporal group. None of the attributes which characterise the croc- odile are located in the lower left quadrate where the complete range of pipefish attributes are situated. Since there is neither an exclusive nor a definitive sim- ilarity relation between the crocodile and the Yam Rainbow Serpents, the crocodile form cannot be regarded as an original source for the development of the Rainbow 114</page><page sequence="13">Figure 13. Object graph showing the distribution of all Rainbow Serpents in rela- tion to the pipefish, x-axis = correspondence axis 1 ; y-axis = correspondence axis 2. Note the location of the pipefish on the left of the Yam Rainbow Serpent group. Figure 14. Variable graph showing the distribution of all Rainbow Serpent and pipefish attributes, x-axis = correspondence analysis 1 ; y-axis = correspondence analysis 2. The pipefish attributes span the location of the graph where Yam Rainbow Serpent attributes are primarily found. Serpent image. If there is a relationship, it is a temporal one as Rainbow Serpents acquire crocodile characteristics when strict adherence to replicate the pipefish form grad- ually subsides and new features from other creatures are incorporated into the attribute repertoire. Snake The correspondence algorithm generates a score which places the snake in the lower right quadrate of the graph (Figure 15), relatively close to the central origin 0,0. Its distinctiveness appears to have been influenced by the higher score generated by H32 (snake head), which only a few Rainbow Serpents exhibit. The distance between the Dynamic style Serpent and the snake is relatively narrow: the Dynamic Serpent is the most 'snake-like'. Earlier, it was questioned whether the Dynamic Serpent is a depiction of a snake or a Rainbow Serpent. We concluded it was more likely a snake rather than a Rainbow Serpent and this is further confirmed here. However, even if it does represent a snake, not a Rainbow Serpent, it is still an important image, as the snake itself has long been consid- ered a powerful being with special properties for the people of greater Arnhem Land. That it was so during the Dynamic Period is signalled by its exaggerated size when compared to the human figures interacting with it. In this sense, it is logi- cal that snake-like features are exhibited in the painted Rainbow Serpent images and also feature in Rainbow Serpent stories. Two attributes denoting the snake are the 'pointed tail' and 'sinuous body'. Both generated low correspondence scores (close to 0,0), and both are distinctive of Rainbow Serpent images from all time periods. The low scores and com- monality of these attributes suggests that they do not inform about temporal differences. They transcend temporal boundaries, unlike those of the pipefish which are restricted to a particular temporal group. Kangaroo We next looked at the placement of the kanga- roo. The kangaroo is located in the upper right hand quadrate of the graph, aligned on the x- axis with the more dispersed 'unknown' speci- mens and the more aggregated 'modern' speci- mens. If kangaroo features were incorporated into the Rainbow Serpent image, it was probably at the end of the transitional phase and the beginning of the modern phase. Indeed, there are a few Rainbow Serpent images that have plotted very close to the kangaroo, suggesting that many attributes of some of the more recent paintings derive from this creature. We notice that few of the attributes describing the kangaroo impose on the graph area dominated by the Yam specimens. This is again consistent with Rainbow Serpents belonging to the Yam style being painted with rigidly structured configurations in mind (influenced by 2 'Distinctiveness' is defined by 'relative difference' to other objects in the sample and distance from the central origin. The implication derived from the attributes which describe the snake is that if it was not for the presence of H3 (which scores higher than the other snake attributes), the coordinates for the snake would be much closer to {0,0}. 115</page><page sequence="14">Figure 15. Object graph showing the distribution of various animals found in Arnhem Land's natural environment and Rainbow Serpent rock paintings, x-axis = correspondence axis 1 ; y-axis = correspondence axis 2. There is increasing vari- ation (distance between points) from left to right which may relate to time. This shows an early inspiration of the Rainbow Serpent form deriving from pipefish and the incorporation of attributes from many different creatures over time. the pipefish), while those belonging to later periods were afforded greater flexibility, whereby a combination of different species-related features were assimilated into the repertoire of Rainbow Serpent designs. Seahorse The result for the seahorse is similar to the pipefish - understandably given that they are similar creatures in the same zoological family. The distributioneof seahorse attributes exhibits a slightly greater coverage of the attribute scoring range than those that describe the pipefish. All creatures When we include all creatures at the same time, we find individual scores altered slightly, but not the overall sim- ilarity relations between specimens (Figure 15). Both the pipefish and the seahorse are located in the upper left quadrate along with the crocodile; the majority of Yam specimens have also moved to this sector. The relation- ship between 'actual' creatures on the one graph is statis- tically similar to that seen when comparing the individ- ual graphs showing the results for each creature; the pipefish is more similar to the majority of Yam Rainbow Serpent images than the seahorse but no longer at the left hand extremity of this group. A cluster of modern figures lie closest to the kangaroo; the 'kangaroo forearm' acting as the major influence on their proximity. In summary: pipefish and some sea horse attrib- utes cluster near the beginning of the Rainbow Serpent painting sequence; snake attributes run right through the sequence; crocodile and macropod attributes appear later. If temporality is expressed by the distribution, we may con- clude that Rainbow Serpents were initially mod- elled on pipefish, in particular Haliichthys tae- niophorus, and snakes, most likely colourful pythons, such as the water python Liasis fuscus (Lowenstein 1961; Worrell 1966:99, opp. 112). Some seahorse and fish attributes (on the tail) were also used, and plant elements featured, especially yam and water lily. Later, the com- posite nature of Rainbow Serpents became less standardised and a variety of macropod and/or crocodile elements were added (for example, Figure 16). The most recent rock painting depic- tions and contemporary bark or paper paintings are the most varied, as emu, turtle, human and other elements are used in various combinations with earlier features. Pipefish and Old Arnhem Land The incorporation of body parts of these several crea- tures is understandable, as they predominate in Arnhem Land, but why could the initial pipefish influence be so strong? A plausible scenario springs to mind. We know that rising sea-levels during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition had a profound physical and cultural impact on the peoples of greater Arnhem Land, as it then existed. One of the more immediate was loss of land (Taçon and Brockwell 1995:25): If 25 to 45 metres of land was being lost each year between 17,000 and 8000 b.p., as suggested by Allen and Barton (1989:7), significant changes for people living close to the coast were occurring in single life-times, although rises may have been intermittent rather than continuous. Chronological sequencing (Chaloupka 1993a; Chippindale and Tacon 1993; Lewis 1988) also informs us that Rainbow Serpent imagery appears in a fully developed form, beginning near the end of the transition, when sea levels stabilised. Peoples living near the coast would have been familiar with marine species, but peo- ples inland would have had less opportunity to know saltwater species, such as pipefish, that do not have freshwater counterparts. They would have seen serious, life threatening flooding, and some strange, new snake- like creatures. One of the largest and most unusual would have been the pipefish Haliichthys taeniophorus, which, along with sea horses, the now-more-turbulent seas would have washed up on newly formed shores. The supernatural significance of this observation has world wide counterparts: 116</page><page sequence="15">Figure 16. Examples of Modern Rainbow Serpents with heads and ears that are more macropod-like, 'emu chest bulges' and features of other creatures (10 cm scale). These are very different from Yam Rainbow Serpents or pipefish and plot on the right side of the graph shown in figure 1 . Seahorses have long been held to have magical proper- ties. In ancient Greece, fishermen who found seahorses washed ashore believed these were the young of the giant stallions that pulled Neptune's chariots across the waves. The Roman natural historian Pliny stated that ashes of seahorse mixed with tallow and oil of marjoram, and applied to the pate with the bone of cuttlefish, would cure baldness. And in the Orient today, seahorses play a role in traditional medicine (to relieve back pain) and are used as aphrodisiacs (Vincient 1989:124). At the same time as pipefish and seahorses were seen, flooding would have made encounters with snakes more common on land, and the storms of changing weather patterns would have made rainbows more often in the sky. We see these coincident changes to land, water and sky as giving birth to the Rainbow Serpent imagery and stories. Ultimately, the most unusual aspects of change - snakes slithering away from drowning landscapes, rainbows overhead and strange 'new' creatures such as pipefish washed ashore - were combined into a power- ful metaphor and symbol of change itself. Ngalyod, Yingarna and all the other Rainbow Serpents were then born - at the same time that new landscapes were being created or defined. The Rainbow Serpent was adopted to explain the dislocation, disruption and incredible experi- ences Arnhem Landers endured during this period. As new worlds emerged and new lifeways were established at the end of the Pleistocene, the Rainbow Serpent sto- ries helped make sense of it. No doubt, the rock paint- ings were used to recount some of these stories; they were not placed in restricted locations, but figure promi- nently in shelters used by the initiated and uninitiated alike, as evidenced by their closeness to water and travel routes, their general accessibility and the range of arte- facts found in surface scatters and deposits. Perhaps some of the more enigmatic designs consistently placed next to early Rainbow Serpent images, such as crossed circles or comb-like forms (Figures 2, 3 and 17) also relate to the watery world of pipefish, or the transforma- tions they were associated with, and somehow enhanced the stories. For instance, they may represent such things as sea urchins (spöked circles), sea cucumbers (comb- like designs), sea weed (trailers) and other creatures washed ashore (see Figure 17). Gulinj, flying foxes and Rainbow Serpents One final creature associated but not incorporated as a partial element into Rainbow Serpent imagery is the fly- ing fox or fruit bat. Fruit bats are commonly depicted hanging from Rainbow Serpent trailers, especially in the Yam style, or next to Rainbow Serpent rock paintings. Sixteen of the 107 Rainbow Serpent paintings have fly- ing foxes and usually they are shown in some sort of relationship. Most Rainbow Serpents have between one and four flying foxes hanging from trailers; one depic- tion, first recorded by Taçon and Chippindale in 1992, has 13 (Figure 18). When they were depicted nearby, fly- ing foxes are more often shown singly or in pairs. A total of 50 flying foxes are associated with 16 Rainbow Serpents. Of the 9 Rainbow Serpents with flying foxes on trailers, 6 have pointed tails; of the 7 Rainbow Serpents with unattached flying foxes, 4 have spiked tails. This difference, if significant, is likely related to the meaning of different tail types but the full story cannot be ascertained. An extensive oral history in Arnhem Land about the relationship between flying foxes and Rainbow Serpents sheds light on their association in rock art. George Chaloupka et al (1985) recorded the Badmardi version of the relationship between Gulinj, the flying fox man- ancestor, and the Rainbow Serpent. It revolves around an incident in the upper reaches of Balawurru (Deaf Adder Creek). 'At that time Gulinj, who was a man then, his wife and children, lived in the upper reaches of this creek' (1985:80). A Rainbow Serpent rock painting at Djuwarr illustrates part of the story (see Brandi 1982:74, Figure 158). In the story, Gulinj 's two sons were swallowed by the Rainbow Serpent while returning from an initiation cere- mony among the Jawoyn, to the south. While travelling across the top of the stone country they stopped to kill, 117</page><page sequence="16">4é^^^ 4β^^ Figure 17. 'Sea urchin' (spoked circle), 'sea cucumber' (comb-like motifs) and 'seaweed-like' (trailers from near neck) designs attached to or near this Yam Rainbow Serpent discovered on the Arnhem Land plateau in 1993. roast and eat a rock possum. During the cooking one of its eyes burst, and it was this sound that attracted the Serpent who announced its presence with a buzzing sound like that made by the rock-nesting native bees: In fear the boys ran towards the higher rocks, but the Rainbow made a large waterhole around them and swal- lowed them. A large cloud rose above the waterhole and reflected the colours of the Rainbow's body. This was seen by Gulinj's wife who pointed it out to him thinking that it was a bushfire. But Gulinj, when he saw the flash- ing colours, knew that it was not a fire. He told her that it is the Rainbow who had swallowed their sons (Chaloupka et al. 1985:81). Gulinj then rescued his sons by killing the Serpent with a bolt of lightning and cutting open its body. Cutting the Serpent into several pieces, he threw them in all directions 'naming the localities where they landed' (1985:81). The Rainbow Serpent later returned and on two more occasions swallowed Gulinj's sons. Again he rescued them: But when it happened for the third time, after getting his sons out of the Rainbow's stomach he said 4I am Gulinj, the little bat, you are Almudj the Rainbow, you can go anywhere'. This accounts now for the multiplicity of this indestructible being at numerous localities throughout the region. The location where this happened is Gulinj Djarrang, Djarrang, the little bat's djang, in the Deaf Adder Creek valley (1985:81). Chaloupka et al. (1985:189) note a similar incident occurred at Wongewongen Gorge: 'In this instance the two young men involved were roasting the corms of anbuled (Triglochin procera) when they were attacked by the rainbow. The Rainbow Snake remains in the deep waterhole at the entrance to this gorge.' Wongewongen is due west of Gulinj Djarrang Djarrang; an art-site that includes a painting showing Gulinj spearing the Rainbow Serpent, found and recorded by us in July 1995, lies almost halfway in between. Anbuled, described as 'good yam tucker' by Russell-Smith (1985:262), is roasted when available between yegge to wurrgeng (May-July). Here there is an association between the Rainbow Serpent, the flying fox man and yams, just as there is in the rock art. Chaloupka (1993a:48) identifies Gulinj as the progen- itor of the Gundjeihmi-speaking Badmardi clan; although the main story is illustrated at the Djuwarr site, there is another image relating to the myth 'far to the east on the Mann River, and similar subjects are depicted in recent bark paintings'. Further afield, Mountford (1978:80), using informa- tion from Stanner (1961:244), has outlined the Rainbow Serpent story associated with the Murinbata of the Daly River: The rainbow serpent of the Murinbata appears to be a guardian spirit; he is believed to be the mythical source of spirit-children, animals, fish, flying foxes, rain, the deep pools of fresh water, and the general increase of nature. 118</page><page sequence="17">Figure 18. A Yam Rainbow Serpent with 13 flying foxes on a trailer that extends from its neck, discovered near Jim Jim Creek in 1992 (10 cm scale). The painting is oriented so that the flying foxes appear to stand upright rather than hang down. Mountford further notes that the Rainbow Serpent of this region was once a man named Kunmanggur: All manifestations of the rainbow are attributed to Kunmanggur, his spittle, his tongue, and the water spat out of his drone tube. It is believed that this water con- tained both spirit-children (narit-narit) and flying foxes (1978:80). After a detailed analysis of Northern Territory Rainbow Serpent mythologies, especially those involv- ing flying foxes, Kenneth Maddock concludes, 'the rain- bow serpent stands in opposition to the flying fox' (1978:6). He notes that 'the incidents of their antagonism are such that the additional oppositions of sky and water, above and below, upward movement and dewnward movement may also be accepted as invariant', a relation- ship found right across the Top End of the Territory: How widespread these associations are has yet to be established, but they are not confined to the four peoples whose rainbow-serpent myths are reported by Stanner. For example, in the Gunabibi, further to the east in Arnhem Land, rainbow-serpent imagery is predominant and flying foxes appear to women at a moment when bull-roarers (rainbow-serpent symbols) are sounding in concealment (hence unseen by women) nearby . . . In Stanner 's myths the rainbow serpent and the flying fox become*polarized in relation to each other. The terms 'water', 'below', and 'downward movement' form a clus- ter around one opponent and the terms 'sky', 'above', and 'upward movement' a cluster around the other. The mid- dle ground, on which human life is played out and which the opponents shared until trouble over women led them to separate vertically, is abandoned. The myths thus sketch a tripartite cosmos. It needs no special acumen to see that rainbow serpents are at home in a world so divided, for a being who lives below in the water but shows above as a rainbow embodies the polarities between which the middle ground is framed (1978:7). Importantly, flying foxes associated with Rainbow Serpents in the rock art are usually depicted as if stand- ing on Rainbow Serpent trailers (see Figure 20) rather than hanging down from them, as would be expected for a creature that normally hangs from branches. In this sense, they are shown 'above' the Serpents. One notable Modern exception is an image over 5 metres in length from southern Arnhem Land published by Maddock (1970) and not included in our study, a Rainbow Serpent with a row of flying foxes hanging down from its 'belly'. At other sites, flying foxes shown next to Rainbow Serpents invariably are portrayed upside-down. Earlier we noted differences in Rainbow Serpent tail types and whether flying foxes were attached or alongside. This combined with the above observation leads us to the con- clusion that - with the exception of Maddock's Serpent3 - flying foxes associated with pointed tail Rainbow Serpents generally point upward while those associated with the spiked tail variety most often are upside down. With a small sample size (16), it is difficult to say more. In contemporary bark - and paper - paintings of Rainbow Serpents flying foxes are rare. Instead, water lily plants are more often shown growing out of and ris- ing above Rainbow Serpent backs, but links between Rainbow Serpents and flying foxes can be found in oral ■ The Rainbow Serpent published by Maddock is shown with a row of clam shells attached to its back: 'The snake is said to have brought mussels when travelling with the Long-armed Kangaroo, and to have vomited flying foxes' (Maddock 1970:452). The Snake has been portrayed so as to emphasise oppositions through their incongruous placement - the freshwater mussels above, fly- ing foxes below. If the image was turned over, the mussels/water environment and flying foxes/air environment would be seen in proper relationship to each other, as they occur in nature, resulting in the flying foxes being portrayed upright. 119</page><page sequence="18">history and ceremony (see Berndt and Berndt 1951, and Warner 1937). Contemporary depictions of Rainbow Snakes invariably are filled with brilliant cross-hatched infill, usually as geometric clan designs, to further emphasise human ancestral links with the creature. Rainbow Serpents and cross-hatching Darrell Lewis (1988) argues that cross-hatching in X-ray rock art may have resulted from contact with Macassans, the woven material traded to Aborigines along the coast inspiring this infill technique. X-ray, solid, stroke and dot (central Arnhem Land most frequently - Taçon 1994; Taçon and Garde 1995) designs are common forms of infill in rock paintings produced between 4000 years ago and the present. Cross-hatched infill is rare and for the most part appears only very recently; it is especially found in large polychrome X-ray fish made during the past few hundred years. However, in recent times, cross- hatching was common on sacred mardayan (marian) stones and other secret/sacred objects used in restricted men's ceremonies that often featured the Rainbow Serpent. Cross-hatching, or rarrk, has become a very popular and important form of infill on bark - and now paper - paintings across Arnhem Land. In western and central Arnhem Land its use has increased dramatically since the 1950s. Aboriginal elders argue that the cross- hatched rarrk designs add brilliance, rainbow colour or rainbowness, Ancestral power and aesthetic potency to paintings (see Morphy 1991, Taçon 1989a, 1989b, 1991, Taylor 1987, 1990). In essence, the cross-hatching makes the subjects of paintings 'alive' with Ancestral power and with spiritualness, found within all living things, that is most concentrated within the Rainbow Serpent. The Yam Rainbow Serpents, the oldest surviving images of this Being from anywhere in Australia - and their associated forms (bulbs, yams, birds, some land mammals, anthropomorphs, etc.) are the first motifs to feature cross-hatching and to confine or concentrate it at specific locations. This points to an early origin and an in situ development of the technique, which was initially reserved for more spiritual images and subject matter between 4000 and 6000 years ago. Cross-hatching on Yam Rainbow Serpents, most often found in an area above the tail, sometimes covers the tail as well. It also is frequently found on the neck. It is possible this resulted from observations of pipefish or crocodiles (or both), creatures that have pronounced cross-hatched designs at these locations. In many Yam Rainbow Serpent depic- tions the cross-hatching is combined with rows of recurved spines along the outlines of their bodies (see Figures 2, 3, 11, 17 and 18), another pipefish feature. Morphy (1991), Taçon (1989a, 1989b, 1991), Taylor (1987) and others have remarked on the significance of cross-hatched designs, brilliance, colour and the shim- mering nature of this form of infill. Aboriginal people liken it to the shimmering effect of the sun on water; it also is said to represent the essence of rainbow colour and life itself. The earliest as well as the most contempo- rary accounts of Rainbow Serpents include stories about how they reside in water. The early examples of cross- hatching may point to the antiquity of this belief; less convincingly, some Yam Rainbow Serpents were placed in natural, roughly circular, hollows or depressions in rock walls that closely resemble water holes. We recorded examples in 1995 (Figure 19), and elsewhere we have seen fish painted in similar hollows; investiga- tions by Taçon (1989b, 1993) showed that Aboriginal elders agreed with this interpretation of the hollows rep- resenting water holes. Indeed, similar depressions in the rocky floor of part of the Mann River called Kubumi are said to have been made by the Serpent. We conclude that - whatever its inspiration - the use of cross-hatching to denote an element of sacredness in an image, and especially to Rainbow Serpents, has much antiquity and originated with the first Rainbow Serpent depictions. Conclusions As we have shown, many aspects of the contemporary Rainbow Serpent oral history complex are illustrated in the rock art depictions of this powerful creature. Furthermore, a number of features can be traced back between 4000-6000 years ago, to the very beginning of Rainbow Serpent imagery. This has been demonstrated by an analysis of subject matter and Rainbow Serpent attributes, using field observations and measurements, detailed descriptions of the structure and nature of Rainbow Serpent imagery and multivariate statistical analyses. Some of those features of the oral history that have greatest antiquity are: 1. Rainbow Serpents are composite beings made up of key elements from a number of different creatures, including plants; 2. There are at least two different classes of Rainbow Serpents depicted and described, with their different tail types being an important distinguishing feature related to meaning (and not regionality or time period); 3. There is an intimate association and relationship between Rainbow Serpents and flying foxes; 4. Cross-hatching is the primary form of infill; 5. Rainbow Serpents are associated with water and often reside in water holes. Aboriginal creation stories reveal in great detail how the world was created by the Rainbow Serpent at a time of great transformations. There is evidence to suggest that the earliest depictions of this powerful Being date to the period after the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, a period of great physical, environmental and cultural transforma- tions occurring as the final rise in sea levels flooded the land (Chaloupka 1993a; Lewis 1988; Taçon 1989b; Taçon and Brockwell 1995; Taçon and Chippindale 1994). It 120</page><page sequence="19">Figure 19. A Yam Rainbow Serpent that was purposely painted within a natural, circular hollow of the rock wall discovered in Deaf Adder Gorge, Arnhem Land in 1995 (10 cm scale). would seem then that this aspect of the oral history also has an ancient origin and both relates to and reflects the experiences of Aboriginal ancestors who lived many thousands of years ago. The Rainbow Serpent has been used to define the nature of human existence for at least 4000-6000 years; it has become a symbol of the creative and de'structive power of nature (Taçon 1989a, 1989b). Perhaps the ori- gin of its image is as we have outlined: visible indicators of changes to air (rainbows and flying foxes), to land (snakes) and to sea (pipefishes) combined to create a wondrously powerful yet intimidating form. Later the image became both larger and more varied, less schemat- ically restricted in its traits, and new creatures or aspects of change were added, such as crocodile heads and teeth, water lily stalks and leaves, or now even horns of the water-buffalo which have run feral in Arnhem Land since the mid- 1880s (Taylor 1990:340, Plate 4). Both Lewis (1988) and Taylor (1990) have shown how the Rainbow Serpent image acts to bring together and unite neighbouring or more diverse groups of Aboriginal peo- ple by emphasising their common origins, shared her- itage, and there being an aspect of rainbowness in all of us. Restricted ceremonies like Kunabibi reaffirm this. So do the creation stories themselves. In this sense, the Rainbow Serpent can be considered a symbol of integration and, ultimately, peace. Is it coin- cidence that the earliest depictions of Rainbow Serpents appear in the rock art record at about the same time as the first large-scale battle scenes, examples of organised warfare (Taçon and Chippindale 1994)? It is likely that the displacements and disruptions to Aboriginal life brought about by the rising seas led to all sorts of encounters and conflicts. Perhaps the Rainbow Serpent emerged not only to define and describe the nature of a changing universe, along with the position of humans within it, but also to bring people together, to unite them behind a shared symbol, experience and common cause. The fact that rock art depictions of Rainbow Serpents are found at hundreds of prominent, accessible locations near or at camp sites throughout Arnhem Land reinforces this interpretation. Its presence there would have acted as a constant reminder of similarity between humans, rather than difference, as well as of intimate relationship to par- ticular landscapes and other creatures.
