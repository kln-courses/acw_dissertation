<plain_text><page sequence="1">Medieval Jewish Aesthetics: Maimonides, Body, and Scripture in Profiat Duran Kalman P. Bland Reconnaissance of sixteenth-century French literature convinced Lucien Febvre that "like their acute hearing and sharp sense of smell, the men of that time doubtless had keen sight. But that was just it. They had not yet set it apart from the other senses." As he wittily concluded, "... there was no Hotel Fairview in the sixteenth century, nor any Prospect Hotel.... The Renaissance continued to put up [a' descendre] at the Rose, the Wild Man, or the Golden Lion, refugees from heraldry that had stumbled into the hotel business." Taking a cue from Febvre's search for the "sensory underpinnings of thought in different periods,"' historians of Judaism might ask: what are the aesthetic doctrines of Jewish thought? Where, for example, did medieval Jewish philosophers "put up"? Was their hearing acute, their sense of smell sharp, and their sense of sight keen? Did they set vision apart from the other senses? Before proceeding to the combined textual and artifactual evidence on which fresh answers to these questions must be based, I want briefly to describe the conventional answers and to explain why they have gone stale. When the conventional answers were first formulated, historical scholarship was conceptually dominated by Cartesian dualism, neo-Kantian moralism, and Hegelian enthusiasm for poetry and Volksgeister Idealism. This scholar- ship was simultaneously embroiled in socio-political warfare over the ques- tions of Jewish emancipation, assimilation, and cultic reform.2 In the middle The author is grateful to the two anonymous readers for JHI and to Professors Edward P.

Bland of these nineteenth-century battles Ludwig Feuerbach, one of Judaism's most cultured and influential despisers, proclaimed that the Greeks looked at nature with the theoretic sense; they heard heavenly music in the harmonious course of the stars; they saw nature arise from the foam of the all-producing ocean as Venus Anadyomene. The Israelites, on the contrary, opened to Nature only the gastric sense; their taste for Nature lay only in the palate; their consciousness of God in eating Manna. The Greek addicted himself to polite studies, to the fine arts, to philosophy; the Israelite did not rise above the alimentary view of theology.... The Jews have main- tained their peculiarity to this day.... The Greeks looked abroad into the wide world that they might extend their sphere of vision; the Jews to this day pray with their faces turned towards Jerusalem.3 As if to rebut directly Feurbach's conspicuous rehashing of traditional Chris- tian theological polemics,4 David Kaufmann (1852-99), the distinguished Hegelian historian of Jewish philosophy, cited the following fifteenth-cen- tury text to prove that Judaism characteristically devalued bodily sensation and privileged hearing and sight because of their leading role in abstract theoretical speculation:5 This is why we find that man has a stronger desire for the sensibilia of sight and hearing than for those of smell and taste. Nature has put in us a stronger desire for the former because we are more apt through them to acquire theoretical knowledge, upon which human perfection depends. The other sensibilia, on the other hand, bear a closer relationship to bodily feelings and desires, which are far away from phies of Judaism, tr. David W.

Man has them only for the mainte- nance of his body, like the other animals.6 Kaufmann was not alone in defending Judaism against Feuerbach's ignorance and hatred. Heinrich Graetz, the late nineteenth-century German- Jewish historian, typifies all of the modem scholars and theologians who first devised and then perpetuated a normative, aniconic, eternally verbal, ethical essence of Judaism. Eager to flee the natural and the visual in order to embrace the spiritual and the aural, they concocted chaste Hebraic ears and aesthetically seductive but morally questionable pagan eyes.7 Their argu- ments are epitomized in the following passage by Graetz: To the pagan, the divine appears within nature as something observ- able to the eye. He becomes conscious of it as something seen. In contrast, to the Jew who knows that the divine exists beyond, outside of, and prior to nature, God reveals Himself through a demonstration of His Will, through the medium of the ear. The human subject becomes conscious of the divine through hearing and obeying. Pa- ganism sees its god, Judaism hears Him; that is, it hears the com- mandments of His Will.... Furthermore, artistic expression also develops differently ac- cording to the different concepts of God. The artistic act created in Greek paganism, in accord with its sensuous God-concept, is the art of sculpture, that lovely fragrant blossom of the pagan form of perception. In Judaism, on the other hand, which perceives its God in the alternatingly loud and soft sounds of the movement of the waves, in the rhythm of word sounds, the artistic drive, in harmony with this particular view of God, gave birth to music combined with religious poetry.... It is unnecessary to dwell on this viewpoint any longer, for the entire structure of Judaism attests to it. The sharp opposition of 6 Joseph Albo, Sefer Ha-'Ikkarim, tr. I.

This exhaustively documented monograph was arranged thematically. Each of the five senses, for example, was discussed in its own section. Passages were therefore isolated from their literary and historical contexts. Kaufmann pioneered the study of Jewish art. 7 The shopworn strains of "Hebraism vs. Hellenism" are widespread and persistent.

Bland Judaism to a paganism sunk in idolatry and immorality, traits which are conspicuously evident at a single glance, is nothing but the broad antithesis between the religion of the spirit and the religion of nature, divine transcendence and immanence.8 The need for a fresh start on the search for the sensory underpinnings of medieval Jewish thought should now be obvious. Feuerbach's enthusiasm for Greek universalism smacks of nation-state imperialism and its pernicious corollary, modem racism. His references to ears, eyes, and taste-buds typify the dreadful pseudobiological "ways of enlisting nature in our causes and crusades."9 Like Feuerbach's invidious cultural comparisons between Greeks and Jews, Graetz's juxtaposition of Judaism and paganism is in- formed less by an appreciation for the complexities of Greek or Jewish culture and more by the political realities and social prejudices of his own day. Both Graetz and Feuerbach indulged in the distorting, value-laden "Grand Dichotomy" between primitive and advanced societies.10 Kaufmann would have us believe anachronistically that the majority of medieval Jewish philosophers considered theoretical knowledge to be life's supreme value and that they associated emotions, taste, and smell with sheer biological survival or that they designated sight and hearing the premier senses merely because of their lead in abstract thinking. Despite these defects, the historiographical presuppositions of Feuer- bach, Kaufmann, and Graetz highlight significant topics about which medi- eval Jewish philosophers indeed had much to say: the two extremes of sheer physical survival and "high" culture, especially the verbal arts of poetry and abstract philosophic speculation. But the medieval scholars also had much to say about the vast intermediate realms of the sensory, the sensuous, and the sensual as they relate to perception, physical labor, diet, athletics, and games. They also commented on the rich variety of aesthetic experiences connected with emotional and non-verbal artistic life. As David Freedberg has argued, visual images are ubiquitous and powerful.11 His conclusions are supported by the material history of Jewish art.2 As its Paulinian critics and observant 8 See The Structure of Jewish History and Other Essays, tr., ed., and intro.

Using these presuppositions and seeking to be "aston- ished" 14 by medieval Jewish culture, I shift the focus from nineteenth- century ideologies to the textual and artifactual evidence of medieval Jewish aesthetics.15 In the discussion to follow, Moses Maimonides (1135-1204) and Profiat Duran (ca. 1360-ca.1414) will speak for philosophy. Two figures are needed because medieval Jewish philosophy unfolded in two chronologically and culturally distinct phases: an earlier phase within the orbit of Islamicate empires and a later phase within Christian Europe. Furthermore, two vastly different "epistemes,"116 ""paradigms," 17 or "mentalities""8 are discernible across the lines of all medieval Arabic, Hebrew, and Latin philosophy. Epistemes are the cultural templates which construct reality and make knowl- edge possible. Because of them, philosophic discourse is intelligible and disagreement inevitable. Conventionally, these medieval templates are tagged Augustinian and Thomist.19 The one belongs to the family of Neo- Platonisms and the other to the various Neo-Aristotelian empiricisms. M.-D. Chenu named them "symbolist mentality" and proto-scientific "Nature"- ism.20 I understand the operation of these cultural mechanisms to be that when medieval intellectuals used one episteme to experience reality, they declared it a universe within which they searched for spiritual affinities, correspondences, and analogies; when they used the other episteme, they also declared reality to be a universe but then searched it for impersonal struc- tures, materialist regularities, and corporeal causation. Viewed historically, epistemes flourish, compete, and undergo change because they originate in living societies whose circumstances they reflect and whose needs they serve. In this search for the sensory underpinnings of Jewish thought, Maimonides, that redoubtable rationalist and towering presence in medieval Jewish intellectual history, will speak for an Islamicate "Nature"-ist and 13 G.

Bland Duran for the return to a "symbolist mentality" which challenged Mai- monideanism and flourished among Jews in fifteenth-century, anti-Jewish, Christian Spain. In the Guide of the Perplexed 111:25 Maimonides prefaced his inter- pretation of Judaism's laws by dividing all possible behavior, including God's, into four possible categories: futile, frivolous, vain, and good and excellent actions. He defined a frivolous act to be one which aims low: "I mean to say that something unnecessary and not very useful is aimed at therein, as when one dances not for exercise or as when one does things in order to make people laugh about those things."21 Maimonides explicitly emphasized that actions are not intrinsically frivolous and that their evalua- tion depends on the needs of the agent and the nobility of the intention behind the act. As doctors well know, "the different kinds of bodily exercise are necessary for the preservation of health."22 In fact physical exercise is to bodily health what scribal skills are to the scholar. As the one kinaesthetic act prepares the material implements needed for writing, so too the other condi- tions the body for thinking. Both actions equally command our respect: Thus those who accomplish acts exercising their body in the wish to be healthy, engaging in ball games, wrestling, boxing, and control- ling the breath, or those who engage in actions that are done with a view to writing, as for instance the cutting of reed pens and the making of paper, are in the opinion of the ignorant engaged in frivolous actions, whereas they are not frivolous according to the learned.23 The argument on behalf of the body continues in 111:27. Somatic health is a noble aim because it is prerequisite for and subordinate only to spiritual- intellectual health: "For a man cannot represent to himself an intelligible ... if he is in pain or is very hungry or is thirsty or is hot or is very cold."24 Readiness for intellectual activity, according to Maimonides, is also contingent upon the emotions. In the explicitly anti-ascetic chapter of his introduction to the mishnaic treatise Abot (the so-called Ethics of the Fa- thers), known to posterity as The Eight Chapters, he affirmed that 21 Guide of the Perplexed, tr.

On the basis of this reasoning, he would not aim at pleasure alone, choosing the most pleasant food and drink ... rather he would aim at what is most useful. If it happens to be pleasant, so be it; and if it happens to be repugnant, so be it. Or he may aim at the pleasant in the fashion of medical science, like the person whose appetite for food has weakened is stimulated by well-seasoned and tasty dishes which man's soul desires or like someone afflicted with melancholy who dispels it by listening to music and various kinds of song, by strolling in gardens, by experiencing beautiful buildings, by associating with beautiful pictures, and similar sorts of things which broaden the soul, and thereby rids himself of the melancholy. The purpose in all this is to heal the body. And the purpose of the goal of healing the body is the acquisition of science.... If a man sets this notion as his goal, he will discontinue many of his actions and greatly diminish his conversation. For someone who adheres to this goal will not be moved to decorate walls with gold or to put a gold border on his garment-unless he intends thereby to give delight to his soul for the sake of its health and to drive sickness from it, so that it will be clear and pure to receive the sciences. Thus they said: "An attractive wife, attractive utensils, and a bed prepared for the scholar (B. Tal. Shabbat 133a)." For the soul becomes weary and the mind dull by continuous reflection upon difficult matters, just as the body becomes exhausted from undertaking toilsome occupations until it relaxes and rests and then returns to equilibrium. In a similar manner, the soul needs to rest and to do what relaxes the senses, such as looking at beautiful decorations and objects, so that weariness be removed from it.... Now it is doubtful that when done for this purpose, these are bad or futile, I mean decorating and adorning buildings, vessels, and garments.25 A striking parallel to this early, exoteric, anti-ascetic, halakhic passage is found in the later, esoteric, speculative context of the Guide, where Maimonides addressed the law of the beautiful captive woman (Deut. 21:10- 14). Unlike the passage from the Commentary to the Mishnah, it does not legitimate emotions solely because they are means to intellectual ends, but it does show Maimonides' esteem for the considerable powers of affect. To explain why her captor must not forbid her to grieve, to be disheveled, and to weep, he noted that "those who grieve find solace in weeping ... until their 25 I have combined two translations from the Arabic original: Lenn E.

Bland bodily forces are too tired to bear this affection of the soul; just as those who rejoice find solace in all kinds of play"(la'b, sehoq).26 Another illustration of this principle is found in Maimonides' discussion of the Temple cult. Be- cause he recognized that abstract philosophizing is no match for slaughter- house odors, and without insisting that there be an immediate intellectual goal in sight, he explained that incense was burned twice daily "in order to improve its smell and the smell of the clothes of all who served there..., for the soul is greatly solaced and attracted by pleasant smells and shrinks from stench and avoids it."27 Taken together, all of these passages dealing with non-verbal aesthetic or emotional experience reveal the strong side of utilitarian hedonism within the "multifaceted dialectical diversity" of Maimonidean thought, which both repudiates and encourages ascetic austerity.28 They show that Maimonides used different scales of value when he assessed texts and non-verbal artifacts. He approved of secular and religious poetry without regard for its rhetorical form, as long as its thematic content encourages virtuous conduct and inculcates true opinions.29 He understood that scriptural and rabbinic texts are allegories, parables, and integuments, whose use is pedagogically legiti- mated because they protect complex philosophic notions while conveying them to the masses in popular form; but he did not insist that non-verbal artifacts meet the same rigorous standards. According to Maimonides, paint- ings, architecture, music, tasty food, and perfumes, together with the emo- tional responses they elicit, are not shadowy cognitions judged to be inferior when compared to the logical rigor and clarity typifying the demonstrative proofs of philosophic discourse. Gardens do not have to be allegories. He would have preferred that ball games, yoga-like breathing exercises, paint- ings, decorated walls, music, and tasty foods lead directly to philosophizing; but he was apparently willing to concede that for certain people in certain 26 See Guide, III:41 (567). 27 Guide, III:45 (580-81). This chapter also contains aestheticizing explanations for why Priests had to be physically handsome and their garments beautiful, why Levites were disqualified from service if their voices were unpleasant, and why the Temple was so lavishly decorated. He also noted the pedagogic utility implicit in the formal requirement that there be two, rather than one, cherubic sculptures over the ark. For his aestheticizing explanation of why sacrificial offerings consisted mainly in "meat, wine, and song," see Guide III:47 (591-92).

Each was also deemed capable of preparing the mind for philosophy. Maimonides' appreciation of the egalitarian potential of the sensorium is consonant with his metaphors of choice for intellectual perfection. As to be expected, he favored light and vision. The introduction to Part One of the Guide characteristically teaches that the truths of physics, metaphysics, and theology strike us like bolts of lightning, sometimes intermittently, other times continuously, but always against the dark sky of ignorance.3" But he seems to have been equally fond of gastronomics. Guide 1:30 is a lexico- graphic chapter devoted to the term "eating" which is construed as a figure of speech signifying "knowledge, learning, and in general, the intellectual apprehensions through which the permanence of the human form (i.e., intel- lect) endures in the most perfect of states, just as the body endures in the most perfect of its states."32 Guide 1:32 exploits the superficial resemblance between the cognitive limits of human reason33 and gastric distress. The first half of the chapter appeals to the physiological reflex of temporary visual impairment caused by such actions as forcing the eye to gaze upon "very minute writing or miniature drawings"; the second half develops the simile of indigestion and vomiting caused by overindulgent consumption of honey.34 Similarly, Guide 1:33 likens the premature introduction of theology and metaphysics into the curriculum to "someone feeding a nursing child with wheaten bread and meat and giving him wine to drink. He would undoubtedly kill him, not because these aliments are bad or unnatural for man, but because the child ... is too weak to digest them so as to derive a benefit from them."35 30 See Warren Zev Harvey, "Ethics and Meta-Ethics, Aesthetics and Meta-Aesthetics in Maimonides," in Shlomo Pines and Yirmiyahu Yovel, Maimonides and Philosophy (Dordrecht, 1986), 131-38. 31 Guide, 6-8. 32 Guide, 63. 33 See S.

In Guide 111:50 the kiss of God, alluded to in the biblical Song of Songs, is construed to mean that Moses, Aaron, and Miriam died pleasantly in a "state of intense and passionate love" due to the perfection of their intellectual grasp of God.36 This is all the more remarkable since Maimonides concurred with the proto-ascetic and Aristotelian notion that the sense of touch "is a disgrace to us"37 insofar as it misleads us into excessive eating, drinking, and copula- tion, thus competing unfairly with the less sensational allure of philosophic contemplation. Another indication of Maimonides' attitude toward the somatic can be extracted from his analysis of divine attributes and anthropomorphisms. Religious philosophers in the tradition of Xenophanes have long debated the propriety of ascribing certain qualities to God.38 In Guide 1:47 Maimonides sought to explain why "hearing, sight and the sense of smell are figuratively ascribed" to God by the prophets, "whereas the sense of taste and that of touch are not."39 He believed that God was perfectly incorporeal, so that strictly speaking, either all five of the senses should equally be ascribable to God in a metaphorical sense, or none of the senses-including hearing, sight, and smell-should ever be ascribed to God, even metaphorically. He resolved the inconsistency by noting that even common people understand that touch and taste require direct physical contact between the perceiver and the per- ceived, whereas the other three senses operate at a distance. Therefore no pedagogic harm is done by attributing sight, audition, and smell to God. In contrast the predicates of taste and touch, if applied to God, would demean Him in the minds of the masses. But to apprehend God appropriately, Maimonides argued, the masses must also come to understand that He no more sees, hears, or smells, as we do corporeally, than He either touches or tastes, even metaphorically. If Graetz was correct in asserting that "the entire structure of Judaism attests to" the contrast between pagan sights and Judaic sounds, then Mai- monides must paradoxically be excluded from the structure of Judaism. According to Maimonides, God is no more appropriately perceived in the "alternatingly loud and soft sounds of the movement of the waves, in the rhythm of word sounds" than He is made manifest in visions born in prophetic imagination40 or fairly represented in the objects encountered when "strolling in gardens, experiencing beautiful buildings, associating with beautiful pictures, or similar sorts of things which broaden the soul."

With the notable exceptions of listening to particularly lusty secular music42 or gazing upon idolatrous objects like those found in Christian places of worship,43 he apparently set no limits on aesthetic experi- ence. He forbade looking at nature in the form "of a woman who is prohib- ited to us, even to look at such a woman with a view to pleasure ... and birds and beasts when they copulate,"44 but he permitted almost unrestricted gazing upon crafted artifacts. This liberal attitude toward the arts coincides with his principle that no natural or artifactual object can serve to represent God. To expedite the intellectual cognition of the God-concept within the confines of Jewish law regulating diet, sexuality, and aesthetic-somatic experience, Maimonides granted an egalitarian measure of hygienic, stabiliz- ing freedom to all of the body's kinaesthetic, sensory, and emotive faculties. No one of them was privileged over the others. Because Maimonides distinguished God over all other beings and pro- cesses, he also sharply differentiated human intellection of God from propaedeutic sensory experience.45 Aesthetic-somatic freedom could be al- lowed only in partnership with constant reminders that, except for the human 41 See Mishneh Torah, Laws of Idolatry III:10-I. "(10) It is forbidden to make images merely for decoration even though it is not for the sake of idolatry ... so that one might not be mislead by them and imagine that they are intended for idolatry.

The implicit contrast between making and viewing is reiterated in The Book of Commandments (Negative, #4): "... we are forbidden to make figures of human beings out of metal, stone, wood, and the like, even if they are not made for the purposes of worship.

Bland capacity for abstract intellection and purposive behavior in governance, there is no mythopoeic resemblance between God, human society, and nature.46 He conceded the pedagogic necessity of using the analogies and metaphors belonging to what Chenu called the "symbolist mentality." That Maimon- ides possessed talent for composing a parable is evident in the well-known castle motif of Guide 111:51, but no correspondence between God, society, and nature is allowed to go unchecked. No sooner is an analogy offered than it is crushed under the weight of myriad qualifications.47 His distrust of symbols is neatly illustrated by the rough handling of the symbolists' favorite metaphor: man, the microcosm. Midway through Guide 1:72, after systematically weaving the cosmological parallels made obvious by this metaphor, he suddenly shifts tactics and proceeds systematically to unravel it: this whole comparison can be consistently applied to every indi- vidual animal that has perfect limbs; but you never hear that one of the ancients has said that an ass or a horse is a small world. This is because of that which is a proprium of man only, namely the rational faculty-I mean the intellect, which is the hylic intellect.... Know that it behooved us to compare the relation obtaining between God, may He be exalted, and the world to that obtaining between the acquired intellect and man.... We should have compared, on the other hand, the rational faculty to the intellects of the heavens, which are in bodies....48 Of all the rich implications of the microcosm metaphor, only one remains standing after this Maimonidean critique: a drastically attenuated and ob- scure similarity between the perfected human intellect and the mysterious cognitive entities which cause the celestial bodies to move. Confident that nothing sensory or even humanly intellectual is capable of representing God but realistic about the somatic underpinnings of all human behavior, Maimonides was therefore free to appreciate the sensory. He indulgently granted almost total freedom to the need for aesthetic experience. As long as the people were warned not to let inferences from the natural and the cultural mislead them into forming idolatrous notions regarding God, and as long as people needed somatic-aesthetic weapons in their fight against 46 See M. Fishbane, "Israel and the 'Mothers,' " The Other Side of God, ed. Peter L. Berger (Garden City, 1981), 28-47, and H. Frankfort et al., Before Philosophy (Baltimore, 1946, rep. 1959), 11-36, 237-63. 47 Ambivalence toward myths, metaphors, and symbols is deeply rooted in the Greek philosophic tradition to which Maimonides was heir.

He cautioned them, however, not to confuse somatic delight with spiritual pleasure. One prepares for the other, one superficially resembles the other, but the two have nothing else in com- mon. The ultimate incommensurability of the somatic and the spiritual is forcefully stated in the introduction to his Commentary on Mishnah: Sanhedrin, chapter 10 (Pereq Heleq): Know that just as the blind man cannot imagine color, as the deaf person cannot experience sounds, and as the eunuch cannot feel sexual desire, so bodies cannot attain spiritual delights. Like fish, who do not know what the element of fire is, because they live upon its opposite, the element of water, so are the delights of the spiritual world unknown in this material world.... We enjoy only bodily pleasures which come to us through our physical senses, such as the pleasures of eating, drinking, and sexual intercourse. Other levels of delight are not present to our experience. We neither recognize nor grasp them at first thought. They come to us only after great search- ing. It could hardly be otherwise, since we live in a material world and are, therefore, able to achieve only inferior and discontinuous delights. Spiritual delights are eternal. They last forever; they never break off. Between these two kinds of delight there is no similarity of any sort....4 This is precisely the strategy used by Maimonides in his interpretation of Job to differentiate human and divine activity: "our act does not resemble His act; and the two are not comprised in one and the same definition. Just as natural acts differ from those of craftsmanship, so too the divine governance of, the divine providence ... differ from our human governance of, providence for ... the things we govern, we provide for, and we purpose."50 This exploration of sensory underpinnings has shown that Maimonides likened philosophic speculation to the scribal arts. Bodies, like quills and paper, must first and always be kept sharpened and prepared. He declared that to think correctly, bodily appetites must first be satisfied, depression re- moved, and emotions balanced. Without sensation there is no thought; without thought firmly anchored in sensation and tempered by the Aristote- lian sciences there is no access to the divine. Correct thinking about God, however, means approaching the quasi-ascetic ideal of pure "intellectual worship," described in Guide III:5 1, in which human intellect is instructed to detach itself from its sensory underpinnings. Intellect might then oscillate 49 Twersky, A Maimonides Reader, 410. 50 Ibid., 496-97.</page><page sequence="14">546 Kalman P. Bland mysteriously in the interstices between corporeality and incorporeality, con- templating silently the otherwise unknowable divine. The philosophy of Maimonides did not go unchallenged. Throughout the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries Kabbalists contested its principles, Aristotelians and Averroists questioned its conclusions, and Maimonidean defenders eliminated or modified its more radical claims.51 In late fourteenth- and early fifteenth-century Spain, where Jewish intellectuals were contend- ing with violent anti-Jewish riots and the spectacle of forced mass conver- sions to Christianity,52 Hasdai Crescas synthesized all three of these strate- gies and mounted a full-scale, devastating attack against the entire Maimonidean program.53 Isaac ben Moses Levi, otherwise known by the Catalan Profiat (Profayt) Duran or by the punning Hebrew acronym Efodi, traveled in Crescas's circle.54 Duran, a moderate Maimonidean, composed a straightforward commentary on the Guide of the Perplexed and incorporated numerous citations from the rest of the Maimonidean corpus within his own writings. He salvaged Maimonidean bric-a-bac and used those disconnected fragments for building blocks in his own non-Maimonidean ideology of the aesthetic. By 1403, when Duran was composing the introduction to Maaseh Efod, his grammar of biblical Hebrew,55 he had probably reverted to Judaism after a 51 See, for example J.

He was taking to task the Talmudists, the Philosophers, the Kabbalists, and the general populace for neglecting the conscientious study of Scripture.56 Duran disputed the adequacy of the Maimonidean position. Agreeing with Maimonides, he taught that Scripture conveys its ideas in rhetorical forms and that its legislation is meant to guide the ascent of human intellect after first securing the socio-economic order. Disagreeing with Maimonides, he asserted that Scripture is also an artifact whose aesthetic or sensational properties do more than merely convey ideas and govern society. To make his point, Duran likened the artifactual Bible to the art of medicine. Just as some medications work when consumed as food and drink, while others work'by touch, some by smell, and also by gazing-as with eyeglasses for the weak, sighted,57 so too with respect to this sacred Book. For the effects resulting from its property vary. It also works, in some way, by being gazed upon and by being pronounced and recited.58 Two aspects of this passage deserve immediate comment: like Maimonides, Duran respected the sheer power of somatic experience. Like the Arabophone Maimonides and the sixteenth-century intellectuals and poets of Febvre's France, Duran was typical of post-1391 Spanish Jews who "doubtless had keen sight. But that was just it; they had not yet set it apart from the other senses." The unqualified rhetorical richness of the Scripture-as-medical-treatment analogy indicates that Duran's thought was anchored in anti-Maimonidean principles. Maimonidean intellectualism and ambivalence toward symbols never survived intact the arduous journey from the relative tranquility of twelfth-century Islamicate Egypt to the persecutions of fifteenth-century Christian Spain. Where a Maimonidean would have insisted that the resem- blance between Scripture and medication is suggestive but, strictly speaking, a resemblance in name only, Duran unapologetically asserted that Scripture is drug-like and is itself "in some way" a drug. 56 For discussion, see I. Twersky, "Religion and Law," Religion in a Religious Age, ed. S. D. Goitein, (Cambridge, 1974), 69-82. 57 Translating the Hebrew mar'oth as eyeglasses is philologically unproblematic; it is demanded by context and supported by the popularity of metal-framed corrective lenses (oculares) in fifteenth-century Spain after their invention in late thirteenth-century North- ern Italy. See the useful comments of Gerard L'Turner and Claus Baumann in A Spectacle of Spectacles: Exhibition Catalogue, ed. Wolf Winkler and tr. Dorothy Jaeschke (Leipzig, 1988).

Or the Spanish soga, meaning attached by a string? 58Efod, 13.</page><page sequence="16">548 Kalman P. Bland Duran's penchant for symbols and resemblances belongs to an episteme which played a decisive role in Western culture until the end of the sixteenth century. According to Foucault, the operative terms in this mode of thinking were convenientia, aemulatio, analogia, sympathy, and antipathy. The similtude between things "must be indicated on the surface of things; there must be visible marks for the invisible analogies." To the question, what does something mean, the answer must take the form of "bring[ing] to light a resemblance."59 This is precisely the operation performed by Duran when he argued that Scripture is an artifact which is somatically sensational and therapeutically effective. Duran's notion of artifactual power is the key to understanding his pedagogic instructions for biblical study. He was attending to the manifest appearance of Scripture rather than to its latent content when he suggested that it is best studied from texts written in "square, block script inasmuch [as] this script, owing to its loveliness and beauty, will leave its impress on the common sense and in the imagination, on account of which it will be better preserved in memory."60 He urged that one ought to consult only those books whose script inclines to the "thick and heavy, rather than to the delicate," both for its salutary effect on memory and for its greater legibility in old age when vision degenerates.6' He also recommended that Scripture be studied in pleasantly decorated schoolrooms. His best known prescription decrees that Scripture be read from gorgeously decorated, beautifully illumi- nated, and lavishly bound manuscripts since "the contemplation and study of pleasing forms, beautiful images and drawings broaden and stimulate the soul. They strengthen its faculties."62 Duran's attentiveness to somatic effects and aesthetic considerations reveals terminological and conceptual debts to Maimonidean, psycho-educa- tional utilitarianism. But the Scripture-as-medicine simile indicates that his principles were not purely Maimonidean. In Duran's view the manifest appearance of Scripture is a catalytic agent equal in power to Scripture's 59 See Foucault, The Order of Things, 17-26, 29. "Up to the end of the sixteenth century, resemblance played a constructive role in the knowledge of Western culture..., organized the play of symbols, made possible knowledge of things visible and invisible, and controlled the art of representing them" (17). 60 Efod, 21.

Scripture formally recapitulates sacred, architectural space; Scripture and Temple are physically and materially isomorphic. Alluding to the traditional tripartite division and sequential ordering of the Masoretic Bible, i.e., Pentateuch, Prophets, and Writings,63 Duran declared that because this sacred Book is equal in its properties to the Temple, it was originally divided into three sections just as was the arrangement of the Temple. In it were the Holy of Holies, the place of the Ark containing the Torah; the Holy, the place of the Table, the Candela- brum, and the Golden Altar; and the Gathering Place or Courtyard in which there was the Altar for Burnt Offerings.64 The iconographic resemblance between Scripture and Temple was nothing new to Duran's contemporaries. Scholars would have recognized it as a familiar rabbinic tradition.65 People with access to expensively produced, illuminated manuscripts would have recognized it in the opening pages of their Bibles. Cultivating a practice which originated not later than the thir- teenth century, Spanish Jews were fond of decorating their biblical manu- scripts with lavishly painted pictures of Temple ornaments, structures, and implements. The material evidence, comprising some twenty illuminated manuscripts of Spanish provenance,16 is reflected in Duran's sardonic, but equally apologetic report that in every generation, highly esteemed wealthy people exerted great efforts to have beautiful compilations written and numerous books produced, even though for most of them, it was a matter of self- 63 See George F.

Nonetheless, there is merit to their actions, since, in some way, they cause the Torah to be exalted and beautified. And even if they are not worthy of it, they bequeath a blessing to their children and to those who succeed them....67 Duran's willingness to assign merit to the mere physical possession of beautifully illustrated manuscripts stems from his notion of Scripture as artifact and indicates his discomfort with Maimonidean intellectualism. Because the symbolist mentality delights in constructing chains of corre- spondences and resemblances,68 Duran joined Scripture-as-Temple to the medieval, hierarchical, great chain of being: "All of this is a symbol and similitude for the three divisions of reality which are the intelligible world of the God of Israel and the holy angels; the world of heaven and those pure bodies; and this lower world, the world of generation and corruption."69 This is Duran's innovative combination of two venerable traditions: the Temple- as-Cosmos motif 70 and the familiar medieval trope of the Book. The trope's claim that God is an author exerted a profound influence in governing the common methods for reading the spatio-temporal Book of Scripture and the polysemous-literary Book of Nature.7' Duran also extended the unifying chain of Scripture-Temple- Cosmos by linking it with revelation as differentiated in Maimonidean prophetology72 and rabbinic tradition. The three divisions of Scripture were ordered from high to low in the scale of sanctity and authority. So too with respect to this sacred Book. It contains the divine Torah which is God's Torah, emanating from Him, may He be blessed, to 67 Efod, 20. 68 When asked by his younger colleague Meir Crescas for an explanation of why the number seven is so prominent in biblical law, Duran replied correlating the mathematical qualities of "seven" with a wide variety of cosmological, anthropomorphic, and cultic resemblances; see Efod, 313-17. 69 Efod, 11. 70 See, for example, Raphael Patai, Man and Temple in Ancient Jewish Myth and Ritual (2nd ed., New York, 1967) and Mircea Eliade, The Myth of the Eternal Return or, Cosmos and History, tr.

The second division is the Prophets which originated with God even though it was through the mediation of the angel emanated from the heavenly movers.... The third divi- sion are those Writings uttered through the Holy Spirit inasmuch as this rank is lower than the rank of prophecy.... And as a consequence of all this, how well he did who called the name of this great Book the Temple of God, made by His hands. "The tablets were the work of God; the writing, the writing of God." (Exodus 32:16)73 Duran then took a familiar page from the Eight Chapters of Maimonides, combined it with the established "fact" of the spatial Scripture-Temple- Cosmos-Revelation isomorph, and concluded that it was legitimate both to produce and to study from the opulent Scriptural artifacts favored by his contemporaries. He argued that these were legitimate practices because they imitated God's instructions for the beautification of the Temple in Jerusalem. The [talmudic rabbis] declared that "three things prolong a man's life: an attractive wife, beautiful furnishings, a pleasant dwelling. (B. Tal.Berakhoth 57)." And in this respect it is permitted to make decorations and pictures on buildings, furnishings, and clothing. For the soul grows weary and thought passes away [becomes ugly?] in seeing always ugly things. Just as the body grows weary from doing heavy work until such time as it is able to rest and be restored, its constitution reverting then to its equilibrium, so too must the soul occupy itself in the restorative pacification of the senses by behold- ing decorations and beautiful things so that its weariness be re- moved.... This matter is also appropriate and required, I mean to beautify the Books of God and purposefully to attend to their beauty, adorn- ment, and loveliness. For just as God desired to beautify the place of His Temple with gold, silver, precious stones, and material delights, so too is this appropriate for His sacred books, and especially this sacred Book which is the Temple of God made by His own hands, in such a manner that they resemble the most noble of all corporeally existent objects, namely the celestial body in which He included that which He did from among the comely and the beautiful. These three are God's Throne....74 Duran's pedagogic recommendations for lavishly produced and visually attractive textbooks testify eloquently to the religious and aesthetic sensibil- 73 Efod, 11. 74 Efod, 19.</page><page sequence="20">552 Kalman P. Bland ity of early fifteenth-century Spanish Jewry. His ideological or political mo- tives emerge when his recommendations are read against the social back- ground of a struggle for survival. Between 1391 and 1415 the Church was bent on destroying Spain's Jews. In Duran's utterances his contemporaries heard a rationalization for the venerable custom of using illuminated Bibles, Prayerbooks, Passover Haggadahs, and general texts. But they also heard, in a period of extreme adversity, a stabilizing reaffirmation of life conducted according to the norms of rabbinic Judaism. Duran assured them that their suffering was not irremediable and that they were not helpless victims. He urged them to channel their financial and intellectual resources toward the Bible. For them, illuminated manuscripts ostentatiously displayed wealth, improved memory, and delighted the eye.75 But if Duran was right, illumi- nated manuscripts also showed that their life was legitimated by and shel- tered under the sacred, but equally beautiful, "canopy"76 of God's tripartite universe. Just as the world was made beautiful, so too was the Temple made lavishly spectacular. In Duran's way of seeing, it was therefore only "natu- ral" for them to find refuge in cosmic patterns. Duran encouraged them to defend themselves by imitating God's style in their use of books which mirrored the structure and celestial radiance of Cosmos and Temple. Duran was convinced that Scripture possesses sensational properties and that, as a visual artifact, its manifest appearance must imitate the Temple. Using similar arguments, he also argued that biblical and rabbinic texts resemble sacred libretti whose musical settings must emulate Temple prac- tice: It is particularly appropriate that studying and being engaged with Scripture be conducted with song and melodies, for these increase yearning and desire in the one engaged with it. Stimulation of one's faculties and their being strengthened also improves the faculty of memory, because, within the length of time of the singer's phrasing, there are movements, sounds, rests, and pauses. Simultaneously, understanding of and attentiveness to the phrase are perfected during the length of time in which it is sung. This is the reason for praying with pleasant voices and sweetly in synagogues so that proper atten- tion in prayer be perfected. This was done to perfection in the Temple 75 Even a cursory glance at the richly painted, densely ornamented, medieval Hebrew illuminated manuscripts reveals that the secular, aesthetic values of Romanesque art described by Meyer Schapiro ("spontaneity, individual fantasy, delight in color and movement, and the expression of feeling that anticipate modern art") continued to thrive in late fourteenth- and fifteenth-century Jewish life in Spain. See Meyer Schapiro, Ro- manesque Art, (New York, 1977), 1-28. 76 See Peter L. Berger, The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion (Garden City, 1969), 3-101, 175-77, for a synopsis of Marxian, Weberian, and Durkheimian social theory which emphasizes the legitimizing and stabilizing functions of projection or externalization in religious systems.</page><page sequence="21">Medieval Jewish Aesthetics 553 singers and instruments. It was considered by them to be a major science. And it is appropriate that, to the extent possible, this sacred Book resemble it, the Temple of God made by His hands, inasmuch as the true meaning of this science is absent from us nowadays. The philosophers have said that belonging to this science, which is the practical division of the science of music, there is an efficient cause which moves the faculties and brings into equilibrium one's natural constitution to the extent that it is restored to its health when it has departed. Furthermore, it too belongs to that which brings one to rejoicing and mourning, as well as to the other accidental states of the soul. I think that this is the reason why "To the Conquering Leader (La-Menazzeah)" is inscribed in several of the Psalms, since the tune that was particular to that Psalm belonged to that which caused one or more of the soul's faculties to prevail by restoring them to a proper level (yosher) and corrected state (tikkun). David was great among the experts in this science and with the special instruments which powerfully aided in this.... It also belongs to its property to arouse the faculty of prophecy. As for the special melody with which we sing the phrases of this sacred Book, the rank of its properties is not that of the one just mentioned. Nevertheless, it has a virtue and rank beyond any of the melodies used by the nations in singing their utterances and prayers, for by itself it almost provides the meaning intended by the phrases.... The similarities between this passage and those relating to the visual, artistic appearance of Scripture are obvious. Sacred texts are understood to be reenactments of the Temple cult and audio-visual aids affecting cognitive memory and emotional response. But the difference in Duran's treatment of the auditory is significant: he claimed no resemblance between scriptural cantillation and cosmic, pythagorean music. This deviates from his claim that the visual appearance of Scripture reflects the tripartite structure of the cosmos. In all likelihood Duran did not invoke the musica mundana because he was siding with Maimonides who had endorsed Aristotle's notion of a silent heaven.78 Duran's enthusiasm for composing runs of symbolic corre- spondences was apparently moderated by intellectual commitments to the comparatively sober, Maimonidean cosmology. 77 Efod, 20 and Adler, Hebrew Writings, 128. For texts and studies related to the history of Jewish music, see the references cited supra n. 37 and the still useful classic A. Z. Idelsohn, Jewish Music in its Historical Development (New York, 1929). The continua- tion of Duran's statement in its entirety will be found in Appendix A. 78 See Guide 11:5 (259-60) and 11:8 (267). In his comments to 11:8 Duran only took issue with Maimonides' explanation for the celestial mechanism whereby sound might be produced, but not with Maimonides' contention that the heavenly bodies, in fact, produce no sound.</page><page sequence="22">554 Kalman P. Bland Duran was also loyal to Maimonidean psychology. He excluded the soul from both the visual Scripture-Temple-Cosmos-Revelation isomorph and the auditory parallel between the Temple cult and the musical setting of religious texts. Like Maimonides, Duran did not subscribe to theories regarding musica humana. They conceded that visual art and musica instrumentalis affect the soul, but they did not ground this claim in any formal or substantive resemblance between the arts and the soul. Unlike other medieval theoreti- cians of music, they drew no correspondences between biological pulsations and musical rhythms or between physiological structures and musical instru- ments. Duran seems to have agreed with Maimonides in implying that man is a microcosm in only the most restricted, abstractly intellective sense of the term. His Maimonidean principles also surface in the denial of music's con- temporary power to induce prophecy. If Duran was aware of contemporary mystical techniques, then his denial may be read as a direct repudiation of Abulafian practice and claims to mantic, ecstatic, unitive prophecy.79 For Duran music was laudable only insofar as it balanced the emotions, imitated Temple practice, unified the community, and aided in the cognitive tasks of memorization and comprehension. Duran's assimilation of the Book to the Temple transformed textual study into artistic performance, both visual and musical. For him, these structural affinities and aesthetic resemblances signified equivalent func- tions. Sacred books became the cultic surrogate for the Temple. He argued that textual study as imitatio dei is performative because He [God] said, "I am their quasi-Temple (miqdash) in the lands to which they came" (Ezekiel 11:16). Just as the Temple was the cause of the dwelling of God's Presence (shekhinah) in the midst of the people Israel, so too is this sacred Book that on account of which divine Providence is upon the people through the frequent reading of it with acceptable intention and the investigation of the pearls of its statements. Furthermore, just as those mighty rituals performed in the Temple are the cause on account of which God forgives the sins of the people in its trespassing on His commandments, may He be blessed, so too being occupied with the sacred Book with acceptable 79 For a discussion of the three types of music made famous by Boethius, see Werner and Sonne, "Philosophy and Theory of Music...," 253.

Following the precedent of Maimonides, which he invoked by referring his reader to Guide III:51 and 21, Duran also attributed to the study of Scripture a decisive role in launching intellect on its con- templative ascent to theoretical, rational enlightenment regarding an ulti- mately unknowable God. Inspired by Maimonidean utilitarianism, Duran stressed that proper textual study aesthetically prepares the body and frees the mind from all emotional distractions, thereby enabling mind to concentrate on God when engaged with Scripture in worship or study. Unlike Maimonides, Duran venerated religious texts as quasi-sacramen- tal artifacts and was therefore particularly stringent regarding their outer appearance and musical setting. In keeping with his principles, Duran also attached quasi-theurgic and unequivocal penitential potency to the simple acts of "merely being occupied with, pronouncing and reciting"'" sacred texts. "Merely being occupied with" apparently means merely possessing illuminated manuscripts; merely commissioning their abundant production; merely storing them away in treasure chests; merely handling the texts, gazing upon their jewel-studded bindings, beholding their decorative and narrative illuminations; merely chanting their words with appropriate melo- dies; and even the uncomprehending, merely mechanical recitation of young children in elementary schools.82 For Duran sheer aesthetic experience with sacred texts is sufficiently potent to produce cultic, soteriological effects even in the absence of logocentric, cognitive, comprehension. This was the explicitly anti-Maimonidean upshot of his medical metaphor. Duran's radical aestheticizing empiricism did not go uncontested. Ironi- cally, his Scripture-as-medical-treatment metaphor aroused the opposition of the equally empiricist Maimonideans. Duran was a gifted polemicist. He was either anticipating the battle or reporting one that had already occurred when he formulated their trenchant rationalist arguments fairly and forcefully: One might object and say that all this is merely speculation and the product of uncontrolled thinking. It is fine for credulous believers who live by their faith, but who do not seek proof for it. All these are merely words uttered without their corresponding to reality outside of the soul. Science requires that one not look to the sensory for 80 Efod, 1 1. 81 Efod, 13. 82 Efod, 14.</page><page sequence="24">556 Kalman P. Bland agreement with whatever is conceived in the soul, but to let reality accord with true opinions, in addition to making public its difference. It is the work of those who mislead, inasmuch as logic decrees nothing at all regarding it. Neither does it belong to that which intellect, by its nature, predisposes and convinces.83 Duran defended himself against the paired charges of irrationalism and unscientific reasoning by succinctly articulating the empiricist case for the profound limits of reason and the inadequacy of the philosophic sciences. I say that the forces of existing things including their properties are not grasped by syllogistic logic and theoretical speculation. They possess nothing which intellect decrees. On the contrary, everything known is known through sensation and experience. Then it is pos- sible to supply things with a cause inasmuch as they are things which are consequent to the universal form which cannot be apprehended. For despite all of their investigation, the philosophers are unable to grasp the form of the smallest plants and other existing things. Similarly with regard to this sacred Book: What the Israelites grasped with respect to that property, they grasped through direct experience and from those who reliably reported it.84 This appeal to "sensation and experience" indicates that Duran, like so many of his contemporaries who were appalled by the mass of forced defections to the Church, was attracted to the anti-Aristotelian, historicizing thought of Judah Halevi.85 Duran was dissatisfied with the Maimonidean version of Judaism because it favored philosophic sciences over biblical studies and seemed to offer nothing more than setting the somatic and emotional stage for abstract intellection. He remained, nevertheless, a moderate Maimonidean. As a moderate, Duran's cosmic aestheticizing of sacred Hebrew texts fell short of a similar transformation of the entire Law in theurgic-theosophical Kabbalah,86 just as it fell short of Crescas's distaste for Aristotelian rationalism. For Duran, the Law continued to be a Maimonidean vehicle on which Jews ascended to 83 Efod, 13. 84 Efod, 13. 85 See Kitab al Khazari: Book of Kuzari by Rabbi Judah Halevi, tr.

But Duran required of the Law that it also bring God to earth. To save Spanish Jewry from extinction, the Law would have to be charged with more power than Maimonides had been willing to grant. With Duran's help, the aesthetic pleasures and pedagogic benefits of Hebrew texts were enhanced. Sacred books became densely packed artifactual symbols in which the natural order was morphologically recapitulated. Illuminated manuscripts became sacramental instruments by which Jewish history was soteriologically reenacted. Duran was therefore anything but indifferent to both the manifest visual appearance and the musical rendition of religious texts. I cannot claim that the ardent biblicism of Duran and the austere intellec- tualism of Maimonides are typical of popular, medieval Jewish culture. Because medieval philosophers were an elitist minority, the light they shed on medieval culture is partial and subdued. Aristotelianism was unacceptable to the ascetics, and even moderate Maimonideanism was outmatched by the traditional sway of Talmudism, the popularity of folk-religion, and the growing allure of Kabbalah. But who exceeds the ascetic in acknowledging the sensory underpinnings of pietistic discipline?87 And who exceeds the Talmudist or the Kabbalist in imposing religious significance on the entire sensorium? Because Maimonides and Duran proposed comparatively moder- ate ideologies of the aesthetic, they provide us with a conservative estimate of medieval Jewish attitudes toward the sensory, the sensuous, and the sensual. The lingering influence of late nineteenth-century apologetics would have us believe that medieval Jewish culture devalued the body, privileged one or two of the senses-usually hearing-over all the others, and lacked appreciation for the visual arts. I have used Duran and Maimonides to prove otherwise. Duran's sacramentalization of beautifully illuminated manu- scripts suggests that medieval Jewry was anything but aniconic. His notion of Scripture as artifact is imbued with Maimonidean respect for the sheer power of somatic-aesthetic experience. Duran' s Maimonideanism and debt to Judah Halevi indicate that the sensory underpinnings of medieval Jewish culture did not conform to nineteenth-century ideals. Duran and Maimonides con- fronted diverse social circumstances and differed in philosophic loyalties, but neither of them argued that human eyes and ears should be valued solely because they were vital to physical survival, hedonism, or abstract intellec- tion. To the contrary, they both urged their contemporaries, for different purposes, to enjoy the multiple aesthetic benefits of a fully engaged sen- sorium.

As it was said concerning Saul, "Seek a man who can play the lyre well; and when the evil spirit from God is upon you, he will play and you will be well.... One of the young men answered, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who knows playing ..." (I Samuel 16:16-18). It also belongs to its property to arouse the faculty of prophecy, as he [sc. Elisha] said, "Bring me a minstrel. And when the minstrel played, the power of the Lord came to him" (II Kings 3:15). The song with these properties is called the song-of-God concerning which it was said "How shall we sing the song-of-God on foreign soil?" (Psalms 137:4). As for the special melody with which we sing the phrases of this sacred Book, the rank of its properties is not that of the one just mentioned. Nevertheless, it has a virtue and rank beyond any of the melodies used by the nations in singing their utterances and prayers, for by itself it almost provides the meaning intended by the phrases. The explanation of this is like what was said by the author of the Kuzari [sc. Rabbi Judah Halevi]: "The intended meaning of utterances is to reveal that which is within the soul of the speaker and that which is to be conceived in the soul of the hearer. This is impossible to accomplish except in face to face conversation. Hence the advantage of speech over writing. As the old saying puts it, 'From writers, not from writings.' For we are helped with spoken words, which is living speech, by appropriate pauses and by the flow of speech; by appropriate rises and falls; by gestures and gesticulations; and by the inflections of astonishment, question, supplication, and command; and all the rest of which, written speech, dead speech, is incapable. In oral speech, it is possible for the speaker to be helped by the motions of eyes, hands, and head in order to make clear anger, pleasure, and the like" (Kuzari II:72). Now Ezra the Scribe, together with the Men of the Great Assembly, invented the trope-signs for the language of this sacred Book in order that it be perfected with oral speech, to the extent possible, relative to what it lacks as written speech. Discussion of this follows: Singing with these trope-signs is specially designated for this Book. Perfection has certainly resulted from it, since you will discover that "one hundred people will recite what is written as if they were one person, pausing in unison and connecting their recitation in unison" (Kuzari II:76). [Halevi's] Rabbi wrote about this and praised the utility of this degree of diligence in recitation, how it facilitates memory and the transmission of concepts into the soul. If you listen to the sound of the songs of the other nations, you will discover that their nature so differs from this that they almost destroy the form of the phrases and that it is almost impossible to discern anything but some tone or syllable, for they attended only to the pleasure of the sense of hearing caused by the various relations between voices in thickness or</page><page sequence="27">Medieval Jewish Aesthetics 559 delicacy and the like. Now with respect to some liturgical poems (piyyutim) and rhymed prosody, the Jews adopted this custom because they mixed with the nations, learned from their ways of doing things, and destroyed the form of the phrases with lyrical tunes and melodies. But they have already im- proved, for during the days of repentance and those sacred days, they followed the custom of using tunes and melodies which aid in achieving proper attention and which arouse hearts to repentance; they do not deviate toward the pleasure of singing which destroys the form of phrases. Know that the practice of singing with the above-mentioned cantillation- tropes, despite its being designated for Scripture, was also the custom followed by the ancients for the Mishnah. They used to recite it from their special compilations in the same fashion as Scripture, since it is entirely or mostly general principles of the Oral Law. For this reason, they chose it for the sort of recitation which aids in memorizing by heart. Hence you will discover that all of the ancient texts of the Mishnah are written with vocaliza- tion and cantillation-trope.88 88 Efod, 20-21 and Adler, Hebrew Writings, 128-30. Cf.
