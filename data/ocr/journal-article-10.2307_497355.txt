<plain_text><page sequence="1">irtbaeological Jntitute of Imerica THE SUBJECTIVE FACTOR IN GREEK ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN THE first impression of the Greek arts of design is that made by their simplicity, their regularity, their bilateral symmetry, and their refinement of form. The earlier analyses of Greek art were therefore made for the purpose of determining certain canons of proportion, by which, it was assumed, these simple and regular characteristics might be reduced to a science, and the compelling charm of the Greek work reduced to a formula. It was assumed also that the reproduction of this charm would then no longer wait on special artistic perception, but once so formulated, would be thereafter at the service of all intelligent workers. This thought was fostered by the fact that, in reference to the proportions of the sculptured human form at least, it had long been known that not one canon only, but several, existed among the Greeks.- As to the influence of these canons upon contem- porary work it is difficult to judge. The verdict of Balcarres is that "Every country has produced at one time or another some schedule of formulae to guide the artist and indeed a canon is both natural and necessary, for we judge a dwarf or deformity by an involuntary canon of measurement. It only becomes misleading when applied with excessive zeal, when imposed as a check upon creative forces, or where it limits the faculties of imagination." 2 In other words, it is misleading when it is permitted to become the final authority. In reference to architecture a canon of proportion was defi- nitely stated by Vitruvius,3 and there can be little doubt that this canon had some weight in the Roman practice of his day. He makes no personal claim to it, but sets it down as the way in 1 For example, the square or massive canon of Polyclitus, and its emendation by Lysippus. 2Evolution of Italian Sculpture, p. 128. 8 De Architectura, III, 1, etc. American Journal of Archaeology, Second Series.

However much earlier than Vitruvius it may be, even though he often illustrates it by Greek examples, nevertheless, the slightest examination of the facts shows that no simple scheme of proportions had any real weight with Greek architects at any time. It is important to discuss this point briefly, since a contrary impression is prevalent. I shall first quote the opinion of authorities on both sides. Pen- rose says,' "It (the Doric order) received from Greek architects great refinements, of a scientific and artistic character, particu- larly in the mathematically adjusted profiles of the mouldings and the curvatures of the main vertical and horizontal lines ap- plied as delicate corrections of an optical nature, together with a rigorous but very practical scheme of proportion, which un- doubtedly contributed to the perfection of the works of the best period." Again after giving the dimensions of the stylobate of the Parthenon, and calling attention to the fact that the width and length are almost exactly in the proportion of four to nine, he goes on, " It was almost invariably the case that a Greek temple was so planned that the length and breadth of the stylobate formed with each other a ratio in low numbers (it was not always the upper step that was taken, but one of the steps of the stylobate, which were generally three in number). There is scarcely an ex- ception to this rule of proportion." Fergusson,2 Percy Gardner,3 and many other writers may be quoted to the same effect. Penne- thorne,4 after recognizing that the dimensions of the principal members and groups of members in the buildings on the Acropolis at Athens are incommensurable, shows that a point of view can be chosen for each building, from which these members subtend commensurable arcs. Without questioning the accuracy of his figures, there remains the question of probability; whether it is likely that these buildings, which are visible from all sides, and are accessible in many directions, were so designed that each would give the desired effect from one or two points only. The quotations given above are, I believe, typical of the opin- ions of writers who are convinced that a canon of proportions for temples was a potent and living force, as Balcarres says of the canon for the figure. Before quoting on the other side of the 1 In Whibley, Companion to Greek Studies, p. 220. 2 History of Architecture (Edition of 1887), I, p. 251. 3 Principles of Greek Art, p. 21. 4 The Geometry and Optics of Ancient Architecture.</page><page sequence="3">SUBJECTIVE FACTOR IN GREEK DESIGN 3 question, I wish to call attention to two or three points. In the citation from Penrose we read, "It was not always the upper step that was taken, but one of the steps of the stylobate, which were generally three in number." It is not easy to obtain the figures necessary to discuss this question adequately, because authorities differ and dimensions are often roughly measured, but in the table given below I have endeavored to use the best available data and have in each case reduced the proportions of the upper step to decimal form, and have interpolated the decimal values of simple numerical ratios in order. These are numerous enough, so that with option of first, second, or third step the measured ratio must often be quite near to one or another. Moreover, it would be natural and workmanlike to use multiples of a common unit in places where the eye does not call for a more subtle rela- tion; as here, for instance, in the length and breadth of a large temple, where the greater part of the stylobate is concealed by the cella and the peristyle, and where the lines recede from the eye at such angles that an accurate comparison is impossible. It will be seen from the first table that the ratio of the length to the breadth of the stylobate varies greatly in the different temples; that is, from 2.081 to 2.678, and that there was no one proportion to which all conformed, even approximately. Neither are there a few distinct groups only, although of the nineteen temples chosen because of the probable accuracy of the available measurements, eight appear to belong to four groups of two each, and in three cases these also correspond to the simple ratios 4:9, 3:7, and 3:8, respectively. I cannot believe that this correspondence is due to anything more than mechanical con- venience in laying out in a place where there existed no higher consideration, such as the effect upon the eye. Especially does this seem true, since the ratios, in the case of the other temples, are so scattered through the table that no order is evident. Even the usually accepted statement that the older temples are longer proportionally than the later ones, is not wholly true. The temple of Ceres at Paestum is believed to be nearly a century older than the Theseum, but is shorter proportionally, while one of the longest temples, that at Bassae, is the work of the architect of the Parthenon. I have also given a table of the proportions of the columns of a number of Doric temples, the heights being stated in terms of the lower diameters.

Here, if anywhere in the building, the ratio is apparent, obvious, and here if anywhere the canon should call for a fixed ratio, such as is called for in the architectural schools to-day.

The few groups in the table to which any meaning can be attached, are those which show the existence of local conventions, e. g., the Girgenti group, 4.73, 4.74, 4.75, and the Rhamnus group, 5.55. This is in itself evidence against a universal canon such as is supposed to have existed, but is exactly what might have been expected as a result of local shop-rules, such as are known to every mason and car- penter even to-day. In the passage cited Fergusson admits that the "ratios are in some instances so recondite . . . that many would be in- clined to believe that they were more fanciful than xeal," while Percy Gardner grants that the subject is a complicated one, and that "to understand these proportions is an elaborate matter." Here may be added the opinion of Statham,' "It is probable that the Greeks had some very distinct rules as to the relative proportions of parts, but the subject is so obscure historically, and the different theories started about it are so contradictory, that it is not worth while to attempt to compare or analyse them in an outline treatise of this description." I shall now quote opinions on the other side of the case. Porter 1 Short Critical History of Architecture, p. 130.</page><page sequence="6">6 ALBERT W. BARKER says,' "The Greeks were always artists, and consequently free designers. . . ." Elsewhere in the same work, he says, "In Greece the orders were never reduced to dry formulas as in Ro- man and Renaissance times, and the various examples show among themselves a charming and refreshing variety that allows almost any characteristic of the order, however salient, to be varied according to the taste and discretion of the architect." On this side of the question Sturgis2 and Percy Gardner3 may also be read with profit. I shall now give a quotation, cited by Professor William H. Goodyear in his important work on the Greek refinements, a book in which the author is not so much concerned to disprove the existence of architectural canons in general, as to work con- structively, and to show the temperamental significance of the refinements. This is a matter to which I shall refer presently, but his citations bear so directly on the subject in hand that I shall put them in evidence here. "In modern times great porticoes, of at least equally large dimensions, have been built, and yet we have not been able to achieve the same satisfactory effect. The cause is made clear by a close study of the ancient ruins, and we find then that the Greeks were not content to build their temples according to narrow rules or according to such a canon as Vitruvius or the modern architects, endeavor to establish, but that everything was with them a matter of feeling.' They had the feeling which was encouraged by their high culture, and their happy climate, that straight lines have a cramped and stiff effect. They saw that nature avoids the rectilinear, and develops its most attract- ive forms in swelling curves and so they endeavored to make the construction of their buildings resemble nature, to transfer to them the beautifully curving forms which surrounded them, and thus to infuse the lifeless forms of art with a breath of living nature. Thus were their temples of worship built, and thus we find in them a system of curving lines whose perfect logic fills us with wonder and astonishment at the refinement of feeling which they express."' 1 Medieval Architecture, I, 9; I, 4; etc. 2 History of Architecture, I, 178. 1 Principles of Greek Art, p. 39. 4 Joseph Hoffer, Wiener Bauzeitung, 1838, as translated by Goodyear, Greek Refinements, A Study in Temperamental Architecture, p. 83.</page><page sequence="7">SUBJECTIVE FACTOR IN GREEK DESIGN 7 Professor Goodyear also quotes from Burckhardt and Kugler who affirm with Hoffer that in the use of the refinements the Greek purpose (was it not rather the Greek instinct?) was "to give to apparently mathematical forms the pulsation of a living organism, "1 to give "an effect of breathing life to this portion of the construction."' Professor Goodyear's own work also deals with the significance of the Greek refinements, especially with the curvatures, usually convex, of stylobate and architrave in most Greek and in some other temples. The contention of the can- onists has been that the entasis of the column was to prevent an appearance of hollowness or concavity of the conical form, which, so it is claimed, a column would have, if it had diminution only and no entasis. Their contention is that the stylobate was made convex lest it should appear concave, and in order that the base of the pediment-triangle should not appear to sag, the entabla- ture was made to rise slightly in the middle. The statement is general that the intention of the Greek architect was to secure a rectilinear effect by such "optical corrections. "' Fergusson,4 says, "In like manner, the architrave in all temples was carried upward so as to form a very flat arch, just sufficient to correct the optical delusion arising from the interference of the sloping lines of the pediment. This I believe, was common to all temples, but in the Parthenon the curve was applied to the sides also, though from what motive it is not so easy to detect. " He would have been still more troubled to account for the curves on the optical correction theory had he seen the long list of curva- tures now known to exist, both in elevation and in plan, generally convex, but sometimes concave (e.g., at Segesta, Paestum, Cori) in the lines of the flank as well as in the faCades.5 It will thus be seen that the case for the canon offers many diffi- culties to its defenders, and that of recent writers, Statham, who believes that some sort of canon probably existed, passes the sub- ject by with the comment that the attempt to recover and estab- lish it has led merely to contradictions and confusion.

BARKER it would seem that the best opinion is tending back to the idea originally expressed by Hoffer, and now ably supported by Good- year, with new facts at his disposal, the idea that to the Greek, design was a matter of feeling. This is far from saying that this feeling was irresponsible, or without a guide. On the contrary, the fact that all Greek motives, derived from whatever source, Egyptian, Asiatic, or native, gradually conformed to a distinct and special Hellenic ideal, forbids this thought. For the moment then, we will regard the theory of a canon as unproved; later we will seek a ruling instinct which will help to explain the existence of special Hellenic types. II Closely allied to the idea of a canon of mathematical propor- tions in Greek architecture, is the idea of the dominance of conic sections in Greek design, especially in ornament, in the profiles of architectural mouldings, in vase-forms, and so forth. It is natural enough, therefore, that in almost every work on the sub- ject in which the canon is defended, we find that the profiles of the mouldings are described as parabolic or hyperbolic, etc., and in Pennethorne's work there are plates of carefully drawn con- tours analyzed into their conic components. If these writers had been able to show a mathematical formula for the proportions of the stylobate, or of the column, where dimensions are the essentials of design, then we might have passed to the examination of the moulding contours with the hope of finding for them also a simple geometric basis. But if on the contrary, the design was an expression of vitality and fitness of organic relations in construction, an expression addressed to the mind, it is true, but addressed to it in the form of a visual image and not as a mathematical formula, then it would be strange if the moulding contours had been considered primarily as geomet- ric expressions. For while it was not an unreasonable quest to seek for mathematical relations where the eye would see such relations if they existed, yet, if no such relation were found, we should have little reason to expect a geometric meaning in these contours. The reason for this is that a moulding appears very seldom as the contour of a perpendicular section. In its function it is a surface and not a contour, a surface whose character is emphasized by its projection, its texture or enrichment, and by its shadows, and if its appeal is to the eye, it is the surface-form</page><page sequence="9">SUBJECTIVE FACTOR IN GREEK DESIGN 9 and not the contour which is significant. Nor need it disturb us that Pennethorne could resolve these simple curves into arcs of circles, elipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas, or nearly so, for there are innumerable conic curves, and it has been shown that curves of far greater complexity admit of mathematical analysis. I shall therefore content myself with recalling the fact that the moulding-contours vary as greatly and as universally as do the main proportions, and shall not undertake a laborious disproof of the conic theory. It is linked with the canon of proportion, and the two theories stand or fall together, according as we find that the Greeks designed as mathematicians or as artists. The moulding which has been most studied, and for which the greatest amount of evidence is available, is the echinus of the Doric capital, and anyone who has examined the works of Greek architecture must have noted that the forms taken by the capitals are almost characteristic of particular buildings. I will add that wherever I have been able to compare analogous mouldings from different buildings, the same great variety ap- pears. It is perhaps pertinent to show here that in the surface-enrich- ment, the carved ornament of these mouldings, there is, aside from differences in different buildings, noticeable variety in the separate units of the design in a given moulding, also that in bilateral and other regular forms the symmetry is rarely exact. This can be seen readily in the Erechtheum, our best example of rich ornament in a major work of the fifth century at Athens. For example, in the anthemion-band on the necking of the col- umn-caps on the North Porch, the units are not strictly alike, as they would be in good modern work, or as they would have been here, if the Greeks had felt that uniformity was a virtue in design. As is frequent in this kind of band, there are two types of plant form which alternate with one another to make the pattern. The examples of each type show such differences as, are found in leaves from any given tree. I do not assume that the workman tried to make them different; he was perhaps concerned to make each fit its particular place, and be enough like the rest to avoid disorder in the design, and give it formality; I do believe that it never entered his head that they would be better if they were all exactly alike. The guilloche ornament on the upper tori of the bases of these same columns and of the antae is of two entirely different kinds, as is shown in the photographs (Figs. 1-3). Fur-</page><page sequence="10">10 ALBERT W. BARKER ther the rosettes on the trim of the great doorway are not designed on a series of concentric circles, nor are their petals exactly alike. Similar variations appear in the ornament which enriches the cyma reversa on the same jamb. The sharply-toothed leaves are, in general (omitting the points), of a triangular shape, but the fundamental form is in some cases almost rectilinear, sometimes the sides of the triangle are much curved; the leaves sometimes wider, sometimes narrower (Fig. 4). Close examination of the . . . . . . . . . . 4.1 FIGURE 1.-GUILLOCHE ON BASE OF COLUMN: ERECHTHEUM. eggs of the much-injured egg-and-dart moulding on the parapet of the Porch of the Maidens shows that they are not and never were exactly alike (Fig. 5). Such evidence as I have here presented would be superfluous if it were not that the regularity of Greek ornament has been greatly overestimated. This overestimate is largely due to the modern drawings of Greek ornament, otherwise carefully and accurately made, in which the repeating decorative units are drawn as if they had been exactly alike in the original work. These drawings, which illustrate some of the best books on the subject, show a kind of depressing monotony, like that of the</page><page sequence="11">SUBJECTIVE FACTOR IN GREEK DESIGN 11 Danish reproductions of Greek vases, a monotony distinguish- able from that of modern work only by its better proportions. The fluidity of Greek design in ornament could be endlessly illustrated from minor works, vases, and stelae, except for the easy answer that these are only minor works and that the varia- tions are due to carelessness! This, of course, implies that such excellent design- ers as the Greeks preferred obvious proportions, mo- notonous repeti- tion and straight lines, whereas all other good design- ers, of whatever race or period, have preferred lines that turn or even fluctuate, proportions with an element of the unexpected, and ornament in which the second or third unit has still some interest after the first has been seen. Finally, it is questionable whether the Greeks of the FIGURE 2.-GUILLOCHE ON BASE OF COLUMN: ERECHTHEUM. formative period in Greek architecture had any knowledge of the conic sections. The culmination in Greek architectural design had been reached before the year 400 B.C., and its development had been proceeding in a definite direction for several centuries prior to that. On the other hand, the geometry of the conics begins with the school of Plato, of the fourth century. It is of course probable that they had been observed before they were made the subject of mathematical analysis, but if they had been so valued as to have been made the motive and basis of all archi-</page><page sequence="12">12 ALBERT W. BARKER tectural design, is it likely that they would have had no scientific history? The construction of a given conic implies a very con- siderable scientific knowledge of its properties. As to Greek knowledge of these curves I quote from the article on "Conic Sections" in the 11th edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica: " The invention of the conic sections is to be assigned to the school of geometers founded by Plato at Athens about the fourth cen- tury, B.C. Under the guidance and inspiration of this philoso- FIGURE 3.--GILLOCHE ON BASE OF ANTA: ERECHTHEUM. pher much attention was given to the geometry of solids, and it is probable that while investigating the cone, Menaechmus, an associate of Plato, pupil of Eudoxus, and brother of Dinostratus (the inventor of the quadratrix), discovered and investigated the various curves made by truncating a cone. Menaechmus dis- covered three species of cones (distinguished by the magnitude of the vertical angle as obtuse-angled, right-angled, and acute- angled) and the only section he treated was that made by a plane perpendicular to a generator of the cone; according to the species of cone he obtained the curves now known as the hyperbola,</page><page sequence="13">SUBJECTIVE FACTOR IN GREEK DESIGN 13 parabola and ellipse. . . . But the greatest Greek writer on the conic sections was Apollonius of Perga, and it is to his Conic Sections that we are indebted for a review of the early history of this subject . . . Prior to his time a right cone of definite vertical angle was required for the generation of any particular conic. Apollonius showed that the sections could all be pro- duced from one and the same cone, which may be either right or oblique, by sim- ply varying the inclination of the cutting plane." This was at the end of the third century, B.c., Plato is of the fourth, the great temples are of the fifth and sixth or earlier.' III Although the case for the canon and the conics falls unproved, there was never- theless a definite Hellenic stand- ard. FIGURE 4.-JAMB OF NORTH DOOR: ERECHTHEUM. Throughout the period of Greek development we discern the influence of certain racial ideals. These were so fundamental that they acted with continuous pressure during many centuries.

Baker, of Haverford College for the suggestion that Xenophon (Mem. 4, 7, 2-3), and Plato (Rep. 525ff; Phileb, 56), seem to indicate that no practical value was ascribed to higher geometry even in the fourth century.</page><page sequence="14">14 ALBERT W. BARKER that the Greeks borrowed,-and the Greeks borrowed freely,- were so transformed in their hands that the Hellenic stamp is unmistakable. Early or late, whether it comes from Sicily or Ionia, or from Greece proper, any work that comes from a Greek workshop is unmistakably Greek. This ideal acted slowly through a long period of time; foreign motives and native were gradually transformed, and became FIGURE 5.-MOULDING ON PORCH OF THE MAIDENS: ERECHTHEUM. more and more Greek in the process. The doctrine of the accu- mulation of beauty is based on fact; a doctrine of the accumula- tion of Hellenism would be equally true and would include it. The sources of Greek art must always be of interest; to the historian and fhe archaeologist most; to the artist less. To the latter it must be of first consequence to know, if possible, the nature of the ideal which transformed the Doric capital of the so-called Basilica at Paestum into that of the Parthenon, and the Apollo of Tenea into the Hermes of Praxiteles. That this ideal was simple I do not believe; in the effort to</page><page sequence="15">SUBJECTIVE FACTOR IN GREEK DESIGN 15 translate it into words, clumsy as the attempt must be, we can learn as much as that. Love of physical beauty was there, what we call fitness and reserve were there, intellectual clarity and system were there, and so forth. That this ideal was analyzed or even recognized by the Greeks in general, is very doubtful. Like the Roman instinct for gov- ernment, its greatest work was done before the intellectual hori- zon was wide enough to admit of analysis and generalization. There is some evidence that it is alive even to-day; not among those who seem most eager to come under its power, nor among scholars and philosophers, but among poor and unschooled crafts- men of Greek blood. A friend whose judgment can be trusted writes to me:-" The present day potters at Girgenti, Sicily, who are direct descendants of the Greeks, have no training in art, no sense of order, or of form as taught, but by some transmitted touch and feeling, or through association with the types of form, they can produce shapes of almost pure classic proportion." I hope later to define one element of this ideal in reference to the arts of design; here I wish merely to note its existence, and to draw attention to certain elements, present in the arts of other nations, in which the Greeks had no share. In the first place, the engineer's sense of construction was not Greek. Beside the Roman vaults, the domes of the East, or the rib-and-buttress system of medieval Europe, the structural method of the Greek is like the play of children with their blocks. The same lack shows itself in smaller works. Wooden chairs of the type shown in the stele of Hegeso indicate that the feeling for beauty of line was not checked by any strong sense of the treat- ment appropriate to a given material. Neither can the Greeks claim the highest rank in that kind of artistic integrity which shows itself in a close intimacy of function and form. In the best Gothic work the functional member blossoms forth into its natural ornament, while even in the best Greek work the orna- ment is often reminiscent of superseded structure, or at any rate is quite independent of that which exists. Nor have we any evidence that color, much as the Greeks used it, ever became the vital element in their art that it was in the splendid composite art of Byzantium a thousand years later. It would appear then, and the best opinion tends this way, that it is in form and line, as such, that Greek art is preeminent, and</page><page sequence="16">16 ALBERT W. BARKER that the Greek ideal, whatever its nature, found its expression in the perfection of form and line. I shall therefore discuss first the two great types of expressive line, and then see if we can trace the pressure of certain Hellenic ideals on the Greek type of perfection in form. IV Lines and forms in design are of two general types. The one is obviously descriptive of some fact or function; the second is what we call abstract. Of the first class is a portrait-bust or the naturalistic drawing of a flower, expressing natural facts, or a visible arch or lintel, expressing function. Of the second class are lines, bands or areas of color drawn or modelled on a surface, architectural mouldings in general, and ornaments carved like the egg-and-dart, for which there is no natural prototype. It is the general fact, that, in order to preserve that unity or integrity which is one of the basic characteristics of works of art, natural forms or motives must be made to conform to certain conditions or limitations which govern the whole work, must be conventionalized, as we say. Otherwise they are merely at- tached to it, and are not a vital part of its structure. Odysseus tells his woes in hexameter verse, not in everyday prose, however impassioned; the statue in the niche on a cathedral must be a stone image of a man, a static part of a static whole, and not a real man precariously balanced where he has no business. This conventionalization obeys several laws. First, the image must conform to the material and the tools. The rosette carved in stone with chisel and drill will be one thing; that in wood, fash- ioned with a gouge, another; that beaten out of the red-hot iron with the hammer, still a third; that composed of marble tesserae in a mosaic, different again. Again it must conform to the scale and the degree of projec- tion determined for the whole building or other work of art which it is to adorn. If it is a picture for a wall, its perspective must be so modified and its realism so reduced that it will not "make a hole in the wall," as the saying is, or by its color affect disastrously the architectural scheme. Further, and this is the most important fact for us, it must conform to the style and character of the whole work of which it is a part. That is, among stone rosettes, all good examples of the flower form conventionalized as to color, scale, material,</page><page sequence="17">SUBJECTIVE FACTOR IN GREEK DESIGN 17 and tooling, there will still be Gothic rosettes, Renaissance ro- settes, Roman rosettes, and Greek rosettes. The question is, what makes a rosette a Greek rosette? Perhaps it is something not essentially a part of the original flower-form. It is rather something racial, for it is related to the historic style throughout the building, not alone to the flower motive. At least, if it existed in the original flower, it existed there for the Greek eye and mind alone, which eye and mind found a similar quality in all objects of artistic value. The figures in the pediment, the horses and oxen in the frieze, are like the flower in this, that the same Greek sentiment breathes from them all. We find a similar phenomenon in the abstract forms. That an abstract line can have intrinsic meaning and expressiveness "A 6 B9" FIGURE 6.-WEAK AND STRONG CONSTRUCTION OF CORNERS. is hardly likely; that it can be expressive of character is certain, but it is a derived meaning which it conveys. A border line is drawn around an inscription, to enclose it, as we say, as if we had fenced it in to keep it in its place (Fig. 6). If the rectangle has rounded corners as in "A" we feel its weakness; by a transfer of ideas we think of it as if of some actual fabric. We strengthen the corners exactly as we would reinforce the corners of a paper- box with metal or linen strips, or as we would strengthen the angles of a fortress with towers or bastions, and we find that the line has gained in its expression of strength, as in "B." So also with the abstract forms of mouldings; the cyma recta is naturally expressive of elegance; if the convex element pre- ponderates, it becomes clumsy, dull; if the concave, it becomes fragile. Moreover, this is as true of the expression in a piece of outline-ornament (as in a vase form on a Renaissance panel), as it is in sheer fact when the moulding is run in solid marble, the meaning in the former case being dependent upon the fact in the latter. The cyma reversa is naturally more sturdy in 3</page><page sequence="18">18 ALBERT W. BARKER character; like all the mouldings it has innumerable variants; some robust, some dull, some vigorous, vulgar, superficial, coarse, refined, and so on. Thus there is in these ten or a dozen classic mouldings with their variations, a whole vocabulary, and in their relations a whole syntax, together composing a rich language. A well designed entablature is thus a poem full of meaning, addressed not merely to the pleasure-loving eye, but to the finer or ruder mind that lies behind the eye. The same varied expression of character exists in the more or less abstract enrichment of the mouldings, for, particularly in Greek design, these by their shapes define and accentuate the surface on which they are modelled. Thus a fret, with its nearly straight lines, enriches a flat band, an anthemion pattern the cyma recta, the egg-and-dart the ovolo, the bead-and-reel the astragal. Thus, throughout a building, from its large structural basis to its slightest ornament, there is character proclaimed; proclaimed in a language as unmistakable and varied as that composed of spoken words, and in a great work of architecture the sentiment is consistent throughout. Moreover the sentiment of a Greek building is Greek throughout, that of a Gothic, Gothic throughout; natural forms are utterly transformed, arti- ficial or abstract forms wholly conceived in a Greek spirit or in a Gothic spirit as the case may be. V The purpose of this essay is to suggest a possible source of the motive and character which so transformed the natural forms employed and which furnished the prototypes of the abstract lines and surfaces in Greek architecture. I shall first quote again from Hoffer, "they endeavored to make the architecture of their buildings resemble nature, to transfer to them the beautifully curving forms which surrounded them, and thus to infuse the lifeless forms of art with the breath of living nature." This is, as far as I know, the earliest statement of the "vital motive" in Greek architecture, and the reader will remember that it refers to the fundamental lines. Since that time the "vitality of Greek art" is a commonplace of the text- books, but the idea has not been adequately developed. In a comparatively recent book,' Charles H. Moore says, "In Gothic 1 Development and Character of Gothic Architecture, p. 22.</page><page sequence="19">SUBJECTIVE FACTOR IN GREEK DESIGN 19 sculpture a singular correspondence with the spirit of Gothic construction is noticeable. As what may be likened to a living organic principle distinguishes this construction, so does a vital principle find expression in Gothic sculpture to an extent un- equalled in the sculpture of any other school or epoch. An appreciation of the animating spirit of nature, from which all the elements of this sculpture are drawn, is invariably displayed. Whether in subordinate ornamentation-the enrichment of capitals, the running patterns of string-courses, the voussoirs of archivolts,-or in the sculpture of the human figure itself, this expression of life is always marked. It is true that in the orna- mental sculpture of the best previous schools of art a vital char- acter is often noticeable, and is seldom wholly wanting. Most Greek ornamentation, though severely abstract and conven- tional, owes its essential beauty to qualities of line and surface that suggest life. And in Greek, as in Gothic, art these qualities were plainly derived from natural organic forms. I do not mean to affirm that there was in the mind of the Greek carver, when elaborating his ornament, any direct and conscious reference to nature, or any imitative intention. But the inspiration of na- ture is clearly apparent, even in the most abstract elements of Greek ornamental design, except such as are of purely geometric character. The profiles of Doric capitals, Ionic volutes, and of acanthus leafage afford instances which will occur to every stu- dent of Greek art. But in Gothic ornament this expression of life takes a wider range, and the suggestion of nature is more full and varied." In this passage Mr. Moore does well in calling attention again to the fact that even the abstract forms reflect nature, and in dwelling on the unconsciousness of the process. It appears to me, however, that there is yet another fact untouched, of still larger import. This is, that in the fully Hel- lenized forms, the echinus has no longer its own proper vitality alone, nor has the snail-shell of the volutes its own alone, nor has the acanthus merely the vegetative life of a growing plant, but that these, and all the other parts and members are alert with Hellenic life, and that for the original physical form in which the Greeks found this singularly marked quality we must seek elsewhere. Yet it seems to me that the answer is near at hand, and that it is already written in the poetry and mythology of the people. To the Greeks, in the early days of rich imagination, a river</page><page sequence="20">20 ALBERT W. BARKER was in no way a mere stream of water flowing by its weight into the sea; it was a god at first, a great and beneficent god, to whom prayers were addressed, and to whom sacrifices were made. So all nature teemed with life, with spirits, with gods, and, more than with any other nation, these gods took the shape of beau- tiful and varied human forms, men and women, young and old, and the most characteristic worship of these gods consisted of the great periodic festi- vals, where the exercise of the body in physical per- fection was thought to be the fittest offering that could be made. If with this key in hand, we look again on the tem- ples of the gods, as the imagination recalls them, standing in their original perfection, springing clear- outlined, bright, and self- contained, and turn again in thought to the beautiful groups, that even in these days we may see from time to time by the river- side in summer, vigorous nude types of mankind, alert, supple, shining like gems in the midst of the duller textures of beach and foliage, especially if we remember also how much a part of everyday life such sights were in ancient Greece, a .kinship appears between the forms of the temples of the gods and these other highly vitalized forms, a kinship which is surely more than accidental. Nor does this idea escape under closer analysis. To the pres- ent writer the thought first grew in the process, long continued, of helping beginners to analyze, as an exercise in drawing, at certain times the human figure, at others the details of Greek ornament, Greek vases, stelae, sculpture. The close comparisons FIGURE 7.-CURVE FROM TEMPLET.</page><page sequence="21">SUBJECTIVE FACTOR IN GREEK DESIGN 21 thus compelled gradually brought to light a close similarity of line, and with it the idea that in this similarity of character might lie the secret of the peculiarly Hellenic type of vitality in Greek design. This thought I submit to the judgment of other students of design, confessing that I see no present means of full proof; per- FIGURE 8.--CURVE FROM TEMPLET. haps none is possible. Identity of lines is not to be sought, but merely an identity of type of line, which gives identity of senti- ment. VI A first glance at the human body shows that its surfaces are for the most part convex. Even those lines which the beginner usually draws as concave are found on further study to be in reality the valleys between convex forms. Rarely the stretched</page><page sequence="22">22 ALBERT W. BARKER skin over these valleys does show a concave surface, of small extent and distinctly transitional only. This is true of Greek architecture also. The dominant lines and surfaces are all con- vex. In the Doric order there are few concave elements, and these are of small extent. The fluting of the columns is the obvious example, and the flutes are just deep enough to empha- FIGURE 9.-CURVE FROM TEMPLET. FIGURE 10.--CURVE FROM TEMPLET. size the long convex arrises of the shaft. A curious proof of the preference for the convex surface is seen in another of the few places where a concave element is found. The bird's beak moulding which appears at several places in the Parthenon, is of course undercut for the sake of the shadow. But at the line where the surface again becomes visible beneath the overhanging beak, it has already become convex.</page><page sequence="23">SUBJECTIVE FACTOR IN GREEK DESIGN 23 In the Ionic order the concaves are more numerous, but they are small and are employed to obtain shadows or to define an arris. It is by no means necessary to attempt to explain away the concaves that exist; there was no anthropomorphic dogma or canon, as I believe, but an ever present influence in favor of the swelling curves, and in favor of giving to these a special elastic tension. This special characteristic of tension is of the FIGURE 11.-TEMPLETS CAST FROM LIVING MODEL. utmost importance; it sets the Greek work practically alone in the field of art, and it is what many writers have had in mind in speaking of the contours as parabolic or hyperbolic; they have compared them with the slack and vegetative curves of Roman design, which are composed generally of the arcs of circles. If again we examine the body, the long lines at first appear to be merely more or less convex. A more careful examination shows that the line is complex, being composed of nearly straight elements joined by very short curves of small radius. This sudden change of radius is due to the bony framework and the</page><page sequence="24">24 ALBERT W. BARKER strap-like muscles that overlie it, and it is especially characteristic of animals of fine organization, like the horse and man. In man, however, the translucency and smoothness of the skin make the phenomenon incomparably more effective. In cross-contours, whether of the torso or of the legs or arms, the facts are similar, but the cooSrdinate measurements form a smaller ratio, and of course we get less contrast in the radii of curvature. In many respects this makes them more interesting; there is a harmony of elements alike enough to be easily related by the eye, and they are also like the curves of mouldings and vase-forms in their general proportions, and so admit of easy comparison. Those shown in Figures 7-10 are contact-photo- graphs from templets cast from life, and, though reduced in size, have suffered no retouching of any kind. A photograph of a number of the templets is reproduced in Figure 11. They show clearly the character of the human curves, and comparison should also be made with the echinus contours shown in any good history of architecture, and with vase-profiles, etc. Above all, an examination of the Greek works themselves, not inch by inch, nor curve by curve, but each as an expressive whole, would show whether or not we have, as I believe we have, in the tense and supple human form the source of inspiration that gives the special character and distinction to Greek design.
