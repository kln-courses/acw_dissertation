<plain_text><page sequence="1">with nature. The author contrasts Munch's Dance of Life, a painting which reveals hu- man destiny, with Renoir's Dance at Bougival in which a lovely young couple simply enjoys sensual pleasure, just as he counterposes van Gogh's Sower with Millet's prototype. The Dutch (Northern) painter, instead of a rather literary idealization of the good peasant at work, paints a solitary figure against an em- blematic setting sun, located symbolically in the center of the horizon, a motif also found in Munch's large mural for the Great Hall of the University of Oslo -"a symbol of nature's om- nipotence." The motif of the sun, set symboli- cally in the very center of the painting, which occurs first in Friedrich's transcendental Sea with Sunrise, 1826, is traced by the author up to Max Ernst's The Entire City of more than a century later. Ferdinand Hodler's large visionary Sym- bolist paintings of Night and Day certainly recall Runge's great projects for the Times of Day, and the Swiss painter's stark frozen mountain peaks evoke a sense of awe first experienced in the sublime landscape paint- ing of the Romantics, but they also point ahead, as I suggested in my Hodler mono- graph (1972) when I compared one of Hodler's ominous and mysterious mountain paintings, with its floating luminous cloud-shapes which almost impinge on each other, to Rothko's painting a half-century later. When dealing with Northern painters of the Romantic tradition at the end of the 19th century the omission of the satanic works by James Ensor is inexplicable. Here was an artist of extreme disquietude, a man haunted by skeletons, masks, and demons, preoccu- pied with death (as were Munch and Hodler), and possessed with religious images to a point of possible self-identification with Christ. Also, Rosenblum omits German painters of the late 19th century, men like Bocklin, Klinger, and Stuck, whose mythological pic- tures and romanticized classical dreams are of an entirely different character, but who, in their own admittedly more literary visions, relate to certain aspects of the metaphysical concerns and "pathetic fallacy" of the Roman- tics. Furthermore, here the connection is very direct: Bocklin's early landscapes of ca. 1850 are directly indebted to Friedrich, and Franz von Stuck, one of Bocklin's greatest admirers, was teacher to both Kandinsky and Klee. The relationship of German Expressionists to the Romantic painters has, as mentioned above, been evident for a long time, as exem- plified in the lonely landscapes by Emil Nolde with their infinite horizons or his paintings of the ocean in which, as I wrote in my mono- graph on the artist in 1963: "a diffuse light dematerializes the seascapes in a manner reminiscent of the late work by Turner, its still mood and fusion of sea and sky suggest- ing infinity." Rosenblum draws similar anal- ogies with Romantic painting in the pantheis- tic work by Franz Marc, the apocalyptic vi- sions by Vasily Kandinsky and their ultimate rejection of the tangible world. Klee's paint- 86 ings of the metamorphoses in nature and Feininger's transparent Gothic churches and his crystalline Baltic seascapes relate to Friedrich, whether or not he knew the Ro- mantic master's paintings at the time. A more conscious transformation of Romantic painting into the modern idiom is seen in some of Graham Sutherland's images of thorns and in Max Ernst's visionary and haunting extraterrestrial forests which are based on a knowing admiration of his Roman- tic forebears. In fact, by 1960 Ernst entitled a canvas of a great primeval thicket: The Al- most Late Romanticism. The last part of Rosenblum's book, dealing with "Transcendental Abstraction" is the most provocative. He correctly sees the road to abstraction - at least outside of Paris - as a liberation from the empirical world and a search for the spiritual. This he observed in Kandinsky and in the final works by Franz Marc and, above all, in the mystical and metaphysical creations of the early Mon- drian. He traces the Dutch artist's work from early landscapes that have a truly Friedrich- ian look or his portraits of stark iconic sym- metry similar to those of Asmus Jakob Car- stens, Samuel Palmer, Hodler, and Munch. He discusses Mondrian's search for the super- natural in the natural in his symbolic paint- ings of single anthropomorphic flowers and he notes the spiritual mystery in Mondrian's paintings of lonely trees, Gothic churches, and remote lonely seashores-the very sub- jects which had occupied Caspar David Fried- rich. Finally, when Mondrian renounced the empirical world completely in his early ab- stractions of the ocean and the church facade of 1914 and 1915, he uses a Cubist vocabulary for the quasi-religious purpose of erasing the material aspects of the world to create pure linear energies which, interestingly enough, assume the form of the cross. The reader who is accustomed to the worn-out formalistic in- terpretation of Mondrian's work can only ad- mire Rosenblum's empathetic insights into the works of Holland's great spiritual painter who, eventually, attempted to suppress all apparent emotion for the sake of pure and universal visual harmonies. Rosenblum concludes the book with a chap- ter on Abstract Expressionism, where similar metaphysical impulses to find universal myths and to create spiritual icons made themselves felt after the cataclysm of World War II. He focuses on Still, Pollock, Gottlieb, Newman, and Rothko and finds an American precedent to some of these artists in the paintings by Augustus Vincent Tack. This reviewer has been familiar with and fasci- nated by Tack's unexpected abstractions (at the Phillips Gallery in Washington) for many years but does not share the author's enthusi- asm for these semi-abstract landscapes. They resemble but do not equal in evocative sensi- bility the still little known but somewhat similar and much earlier abstractions of mountains and flowers by the Swiss painter Augusto Giacometti. While Tack's All Souls triptych may belong to the Romantic tradi- tion, it certainly is a part of its most senti- mental wing. Rosenblum is very convincing when relating Gottlieb's symmetric Burst se- ries of heavenly orbs to earlier American pro- totypes such as Dove's "pictorial hymns to the pagan mysteries of the moon" or to O'Keeffe's early watercolors, which were often emblem- atic equivalents of elemental forces. He re- lates Clyfford Still not only to Tack but also to the American landscape, an interpretation certainly not shared by the artist. But we cannot deny that Still does, perhaps in an indirect manner, belong to the Romantic tra- dition as do the organic nature-related can- vases by Jackson Pollock which even bear titles like Autumn Rhythm, Ocean Greyness, etc. Their "Gestalt-free matrix" (Anton Eh- renzweig's term) and agitated energy relate to Turner's world of a century earlier and some of us have indeed looked at Turner through Pollock's eyes. Barnett Newman early on spoke of Pol- lock's "ritualistic will," a term perhaps even more applicable to his own work, which, ac- cording to Rosenblum "provides a visual met- aphor for divine creation and in its passionate insistence on projecting spaces of boundless sublimity Newman's Command bears com- parison with Blake's Ancient of Days, who emerges from fearful chaos and with his piercing compasses - more shafts of light than palpable matter-imposes a shaping will upon the universe's shapeless beginnings." Ultimately in his series of the Stations of the Cross, Newman creates metaphors of black and white "transforming the corporeal Pas- sion into a spiritual one." Mark Rothko had always indicated his ad- miration for the Romantics and their search for the transcendental. Rosenblum relates Rothko's "symmetry and luminous empti- ness" back to O'Keeffe, Mondrian, and Hodler and to Turner's dissolution of matter as well as to "Friedrich who also placed the spectator before an abyss." Rothko's dark and somber paintings, his surfaces of contemplation, have found a place for meditation in his Chapel in Houston. Without resorting to any conven- tional ritual Rothko has created large tragic panels, icons that can evoke an authentic re- ligious experience in our secularized time. In an article "The Romantics were Prompted," published in 1947, Mark Rothko announced that "pictures must be miraculous." This clearly includes him as part of the Northern Romantic tradition so brilliantly traced by Robert Rosenblum in a book which must also be commended for its excellence in typogra- phy and design. PETER SELZ University of California, Berkeley Matthew Baigell, The American Scene: American Painting of the 1930s, New York, Praeger Publishers, 1974. 214 pp., 140 black and white, 24 color plates, $29.50. During the 1930s when the nation seemed ART JOURNAL, XXXVi/1</page><page sequence="2">unable to shake the burden of the most devas- tating depression in its history, American artists created an art movement of unprece- dented popularity. Along with most of Amer- ica they suffered the hard times of that bleak period, but the wide public interest in their work gave them the heady feeling they were riding the crest of a great cultural wave. An American Renaissance, everyone seemed to agree, was in progress. While high regard for American art of the 1930s did not extend be- yond the nation's shores, commentators in the mass media joined ranks with establishment critics in near universal support of the emer- gence of a native art. The emphasis on Ameri- can subject matter, whether it celebrated the American environment or called attention to its imperfections, reflected the pervasive aes- thetic and political isolation and egalitarian yearnings of the period. In a time when there were few opportunities to exhibit or sell, the movement was fortified by the massive pa- tronage of the government art projects which encouraged an art of relevance. Artists of the American scene did not pro- duce a specific style or even share a broadly defined aesthetic view-except in their gen- eral condemnation of European modernism. Within the movement, however, there were two distinctly hostile tendencies: the Region- alists who more or less wished to document the strengths of American society, and the Social Realists who sought to express the in- justices of that society. As with all attempts to categorize groups of artists the distinctions were not quite so neat, but in that intensely polemic time, the poles of the movement rep- resented antithetical dogmas and no respon- sible critic would have located them in the camp. Baigell's joining of the two disparate groups under the single aegis of American Scene (a term once reserved for the Regional- ists) is surprising but reasonable when viewed from the vantage of the passage of four decades. The Regionalists and the Social Realists may have approached the American scene with differing bias, but their assump- tions about the function of art and its rela- tionship to society were very much alike. The book is organized into three main sec- tions. Part One is a succinct history of the American scene movement describing the in- tellectual and cultural climate from which it emerged, the significant influence of the gov- ernment art projects, the essential distinc- tions between the attitudes of the Regional- ists and the Social Realists, and the decline of the movement at the close of the 1930s. Part Two consists of short monographs of six of the period's leading artists: Thomas Hart Benton, Grant Wood, John Steuart Curry, Reginald Marsh, Stuart Davis, and Ben Shahn. Part Three is a selection of paintings from artists of the time who were "painting America." The text is both scholarly and well-written, with extensive and useful documentation; it is amply illustrated with 140 black-and-white illustrations and 24 color plates. The designa- tion of the major artists seems appropriate, although unlikely to please everyone. The in- clusion of Davis as part of the movement seems particularly daring considering the conscious influence of European abstraction in his work. Baigell justifies his selection of Davis because of the artist's desire to reflect the "impersonal dynamics of New York City." The omission of other major 1930s artists from the movement also seems questionable but Baigell does a creditable job of justifying his decisions. Precisionists Charles Sheeler and Charles Demuth were fascinated with the forms of the environment rather than the en- vironment itself. Charles Burchfield and Ed- ward Hopper were excluded because their mature styles were developed well before the decade. This is primarily a picture book with the text obviously intended as an overview of the movement. It naturally suffers the short- comings of any digest; I would have preferred longer monographs and the inclusion of more of them. Even so, despite the brevity, Baigell succeeds in revealing the richness of the sub- ject without exaggerating its importance. The American Scene is a welcome addition to the literature and can be recommended as an ex- cellent introduction to the period. GERALD M. MONROE Glassboro State College Alfred Werner, Max Weber, New York, Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 1975. Alfred Werner's book, Max Weber, reintro- duces the oeuvre of one of the most varied, capable, and neglected of America's early modern artists. A question arises with this publication, "Why has there been no compre- hensive monographic study on such a tal- ented, prolific, and provocative painter?" In recent years there have been retrospective exhibitions including monographic contribu- tions on Max Weber's contemporaries, among them Arthur Dove, Georgia O'Keeffe, John Marin, and Alfred Maurer. But the most re- cent scholarly work concerning Max Weber published since the personal and truncated biography by Weber's friend Holger Cahill, in 1930, was Sandra Leonard's Henri Rousseau and Max Weber in 1970, which illuminates a minor portion of the artist's life. Little critical attention has been paid to Max Weber since his death in 1961, and he was one of the most vilified of the modernists during the early decades of the 20th century; his work was exceedingly difficult for critics and public to understand and appreciate. Professor Werner correctly states: At various times the consensus of art criticism has favored one or another phase of it, but as the totality of his huge output becomes clearer to us, its common characteristics are more noticeable than its frequent metamorphoses. Dr. Werner agrees that there should be a study of Weber's entire oeuvre, but even he stresses the varied, exciting, and revolution- ary early life and work over the later more thematic works and bourgeois existence, which are relegated to a minor fraction of the limited text. Max Weber is not a critical or problematic study but an introduction to the life of the artist, including a comprehensive selection of reproductions which tantalizingly display the depth of Max Weber's extensive production. Although Bialystok, Russia, was Max We- ber's birthplace in 1881, he was brought to the United States at the age of ten. His parents settled in the Williamsburg section of Brook- lyn, New York, a primarily Jewish commu- nity, and here Max attended public schools. In 1900 he received a degree from the Normal course of Pratt Institute of Art, which he uti- lized as a teacher of drawing and manual training in Virginia and Minnesota from 1901 to 1905. He had barely studied painting while in New York, but inspired by the progressive training of Arthur Wesley Dow, Weber painted in Virginia and Minnesota and was included in a group exhibition in Minnesota. He had decided to become a painter and felt that a trip to Europe was essential to his education. After four years of teaching in ru- ral America, Max Weber saved enough money to go to Europe. In 1905 the young painter sailed to France. He remained in Paris for three and a half years, making artistic pilgrimages to Italy, Holland, and Spain. In Paris Weber met Henri Rousseau, Pablo Picasso, Dunoyer de Segonzac, and Jules Flandrin, and studied with the academic Jean-Paul Laurens and the progressive Henri Matisse. In January, 1909, his funds depleted, Max Weber returned to New York City. Here he encountered hostility and neglect, but he con- tinued to experiment with the revolutionary methods and motifs which he had assimilated in Europe. Thematically he remained a tradi- tionalist preferring nudes, still-lifes, and landscapes, but his modernistic stylizations- Fauvism, Cubism, Futurism-enraged the critics and confused a public hesitant to ac- knowledge new trends. Through the '20s and '30s Weber turned to a more realistic Expres- sionistic style for which he began to receive favorable notices. His reverent and fervent religious themes became particularly favored by a growing Jewish bourgeoisie. Throughout his career he continued to paint his three favorite themes, emphasizing each at differ- ent times, and by the end of his career had turned again to a lyrical abstraction. At the time of his death in 1961 Max Weber was acclaimed as the Dean of American Moderns. Dr. Werner mentions Weber's experimen- tation and development from Fauve tenden- cies, inspired by his study with Matisse, through his espousal of Cubist and Futurist motifs, to his arrival at a mature form of personal Expressionism, but Dr. Werner pos- tulates no rationale for the artist's frequent shifts in style and theme. Weber was much in tune with the innovations of his time and aware of avant-garde stylizations; he was also deeply motivated by events in his own life. It is significant to note that Weber's turn to a ART JOURNAL, XXXVI/1 88</page></plain_text>
