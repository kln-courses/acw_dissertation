TOMKINSON DIVINE SEMPITERNITY AND ATEMPORALITY Notable among the current fashions in philosophical theology is the movement away from the view that the mode of being properly attributable to God is some form of atemporal eternity. It sometimes seems almost to be the case that a consensus is in process of formation in support of the contention that the only rationally defensible interpretation of the divine eternity is in terms of sempiternity, i.e. of beginingless and endless temporal duration. This is true not only of the so-called 'process theologians', for leading theistic philosophers throughout the English-speaking world seem to be in something of a rush to espouse this particular cause.1 It may be suspected that many of the determinants of this attitude are extra-philosophical. There seems something fitting in the idea that ultimate reality is subject to change, open to development, and therefore temporal in nature, to those who live in a society which sees itself as dynamic and 'open' and which sees these characteristics as virtues. Another source of the influence which is leading theistic writers to reject the interpretation of the divine eternity in terms of atemporality seems to lie in the failure of biblical scholarship to detect unequivocal expressions of that view in either Old or New Testaments. It is certainly true that when arguing in support of the case for sempiternity many writers cite the evidence for the biblical preference at suspicious length and in suspicious detail, so that it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that this is being used either in support of or in place of philosophical argumentation.2 Of course neither of these alleged factors carries any philosophical weight. If it is indeed true that modern man finds the idea of a time-conditioned, developing God more satisfying than that of an atemporal divinity modern man may nevertheless be destined to languish unsatisfied, since the facts may be otherwise. The attempt to characterize God as time-conditioned may be another instance of our attempting to make the gods in our own image. The biblical evidence is equally irrelevant to the philosophical questions. It may be important in the history of thought, and ' For example J. Hick, 'Necessary Being', Scottish Journal of Theology, xiv (I96I), 353-69; and R. G. Swinburne, The Coherence of Theism (Oxford, I977), pp. 2I0-29.

TOMKINSON there may be religious sects whose theologians require biblical support for all of their dogmas, but the alleged data of supernatural revelation can have no philosophical weight. The specifically philosophical reasons for the present trend would seem to lie largely in the host of logical difficulties which are felt to undermine confidence in the coherence of talk about an extralogical yet atemporal mode of being. Combined with this there seems to be an uncritical assumption that no special difficulties are raised by making the claim that if there is a God he will possess boundless duration throughout time. In rejecting atemporality and recommending sempiternity a recent prominent writer expressed himself thus: '... . as I have been urging, the theist has no need to incorporate the doctrine of the timelessness of God into his theism. He can easily do without it and all the difficulties which it brings, and rely instead on the simple and easy coherent understanding of God's eternity [i.e. as sempiternity] . . . '1 In this paper I wish to question both of these positions, arguing first of all that the attribution of sempiternity to God may not be to utilize a 'simple and easy coherent understanding' at all. Secondly, I shall attempt to show that the case against the coherence of divine atemporality has not been made, that most of the arguments which are alleged to count against it are in fact directed at quite a different notion from that of the atemporal eternity traditionally attributed to God. As a consequence of the arguments put forward, it will be maintained that it is more reasonable to hold that if there is a God he will possess eternity in the traditional sense than it is to maintain that he will exercise his being throughout the boundless stretch of time. THE UNACCEPTABILITY OF DIVINE SEMPITERNITY It may reasonably be assumed as analytically true that if the term 'God' is exemplified it will be uniquely instantiated, and that the unique individual thus designated would suffer no limitations or impediments upon the exercise and enjoyment of his nature and being unless the assertion of the absence of those limitations itself be incoherent. This might be expressed by providing a 'working' nominal definition of 'God' as the least limited logically possible being, a reasonable modern interpretation of the description of God as 'Something than which nothing greater can be thought' in Saint Anselm's Proslogion.2 Acceptance of this nominal definition would provide us with a procedural rule for the practice of philosophical theology to the effect that no property the possession of which entails some limitation upon the mode of existence of its subject may properly be predicated of God unless the assertion that God fails to possess it be incoherent. 1 R.

They are a means of distin guishing one state of affairs from another. What is the case now is different from what was the case in the past and from what will be the case in the future, other things being equal, precisely in virtue of the exclusiveness made possible by the passage of time. Temporality then is a fundamental aspect of our limited nature precisely in its imposition of limitation. Moreover, this sort of limitation is not obliterated by merely extending temporality without bounds. This point was adequately made by Boethius: Whatever lives in time exists in the present and progresses from the past to the future, and there is nothing set in time can embrace simultaneously the whole extent of its life; it is in the position of not yet possessing tomorrow when it has already lost yesterday. In this life of today you do not live more fully than in that fleeting and transitory moment. Whatever, therefore, suffers the condition of being in time, even though it never had any beginning, never had any ending and its life extends into the infinity of time, as Aristotle thought was the case with the world, it is still not such that it may be considered eternal.1 Sempiternity involves the denial of a limit to existence within time, but temporality itself is by nature limiting. Secondly, the passage of time limits the possession and enjoyment of what is good in a manner to which the God of traditional christian theism would be particularly vulnerable. In the words of the famous hymn: Time, like an ever-rolling stream, Bears all his sons away; They fly forgotten, as a dream Dies at the opening day.2 What is lost in the passage of time may often be valued as good per se. What is thus valued in and for itself may be valued precisely for its individual peculiarities, for its particularity, as a unique and unrepeatable good. The loss caused by the disappearance of some of these strictly unrepeatable goods may be greater than the loss which is attendant upon the passing of others. A particular bottle of wine may be both good and recognizably unique. It is unlikely, although by no means impossible, that we should value it precisely in and for those distinctive properties which render it unique. If its disappearance be regretted we may nevertheless be adequately compensated by the anticipation of future bottles of wine different from but perhaps at least as pleasurable as the one which has ceased to exist. Thus our drinking of the bottle of wine would hardly be accompanied by melancholy at the thought of its irretrievable loss. But consider, by contrast, the judgement of a mature and loving parent on the various phases to be observed in the growth and development of his child. In appreciating and enjoying these successive Boethius, The Consolations of Philosophy, tr. V. E. Watts (London, I969), p. I64. 2 English Hymnal, number 450, verse 5.</page><page sequence="4">i8o J. L. TOMKINSON stages of his child's growing up, the parent would constantly be presented with new 'goods', as new characteristics or fresh aspects of personality make their appearance or manifest fresh modifications. But each change will bring a loss as well as a gain. Facets of the child's personality, valued for their particularity, will constantly be disappearing as the old makes way for the new. The parent's pleasure in the experience of the development of his child will be tempered by an appreciation of a continual loss, a loss which, on the basis of our everyday understanding of the nature of time, is quite irrevocable and absolute. The parent of a child of sixteen years of age has lost that child as a child of fourteen years of age for ever. Of course such a parent might take to musing contentedly over the remembrance of times past; but he would probably maintain that in comparison with the genuine appreciation of the 'higher' good of the child's actual personality at some particular time in the past, such fond memories would be little more than the trifling luxury of a selfish introspection. No copy is possible, and no alternative or substitute would serve to cancel out precisely that loss. Human parents, of course, have their limitations. Their love may never have been very strong. They may simply forget, or develop new interests. But the loss will bear upon them with greater force in direct proportion to their capacity for love, and for appreciation of the value of the child's unique personality, and in direct proportion to the degree to which these things are not clouded by self-centredness or ignorance. Such loss would bear with unique force upon the traditional God of christendom. According to the creation story in the Old Testament: 'God saw everything that he had made, and behold it was very good.'1 Jesus seems to have taught that this appreciation of the worth of the creation by its Creator is no merely intellectual estimate based upon the purely general characteristics of the world, but rather that for God each unique individual is uniquely appreciated and loved by the Creator as by a Father: 'Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father's will. But even the hairs of your head are numbered. 2 The loss experienced by a loving parent as the passage of time bears away the child he knew will be multiplied and intensified beyond estimation for the Father of all, whose omniscience will be undimmed by ignorance and whose love will be unquenched by selfishness. Were the traditional God of christianity to be a sempiternal being, faced with the constant disappearance of various uniquely valuable and fully appreciated aspects of the personalities of his innumerable children, he would be the most wretched rather than the most blessed of beings. In the face of the obviously limiting character of temporality several I R.S.V. Genesis I: 3I 2 Matthew IO: 30.</page><page sequence="5">DIVINE SEMPITERNITY AND ATEMPORALITY i8i attempts have been made to achieve a compromise, to attribute to God a temporal mode of being which in some way avoids carrying with it the limitation which time-bound existence involves. Two will briefly be considered. Many protestant theologians have claimed that God exists within the temporal process but is not limited by it. In God's passage through time there is said to be no conflict, loss or ignorance. Since he is in complete control of things, God dominates time; it does not constrain him. As J. R. Lucas expresses this view: '.. . time passes but does not press. All time is present to the divine mind, in the sense that none is remote or far away or absent, but not in the sense that it is simultaneous, nor that eternity is timeless in which nothing ever happens nor can be conceived of as happening. '1 This will not do. Those who hold such views are either contradicting themselves in asserting obliquely that God both is and is not time-bound, or they are merely advancing in grossly misleading fashion rather unobjectionable but also insignificant claims to the effect that God has rather a good memory, that he is capable of efficient anticipation of the future, etc. But this hardly suffices to cancel out the limitations inherent in the temporal condition. A more traditional attempt to understand God as a temporal being yet as immune from the ravages of time is provided by the interpretation of the doctrine of the divine immutability which has been especially popular among Islamic theologians. For al-Ghazali, God is '. . .exalted above change and alteration; for him there are no happenings, no misfortunes can befall him, but rather he possesses everlastingly the properties of his majesty beyond the reach of decay, and for the attributes of his perfection he needs no growth or process of perfection. '2 This attempt to provide the Supreme Being with immunity from the undesirable consequences of the temporal nature attributed to him must also be counted a failure. A being condemned to exist throughout the endless duration of time, in whom there are no changes and for whom there are no happenings, would seem to be the least free and powerful of existents, the most pitiable of the prisoners of time. Since the concept of divine sempiternity involves the attribution of limitations to God, the assertion that God possesses this mode of being will be incoherent unless there is no way of describing God which is coherent and which does not involve the ascription to him of even greater limitations or restrictions upon the exercise of his nature and existence. The traditional notion of eternity as atemporal is supposed to do precisely this, to refer to a mode of being which is intrinsically less restrictive or limited that that which is exercised in time. To this traditional notion we must then direct our attention. 1 J. R. Lucas, Treatise on Time and Space (London, 1973), p. 307. 2 Al-Ghazali, 'Resuscitation of the Sciences of Religion', in Philosophers Speak of God, ed. C. Hartshorne and W. L. Reese (Chicago, I953), p. I07.</page><page sequence="6">I82 J. L. TOMKINSON THE NATURE OF DIVINE ATEMPORALITY The concept of a mode of being superior to the temporal may be found in the writings of Parmenides,' Plato2 and Philo of Alexandria.3 In the Confessions of Saint Augustine we read: 'Your years neither go nor come, but our years pass and others come after them, so that all may come in their turn. Your years are completely present to you all at once, because they are at a permanent standstill. They do not move on, forced to give way before the advance of others, because they never pass at all.'4 Developed in the Consolations of Philosophy of Boethius, this was to become, and despite exceptional individuals and divergent subsidiary traditions was to remain, the dominant tradition within christian theology until the present century. The hostility which this approach arouses in certain quarters, together with the contemporary tendency to reject it as incoherent, suggests the possibility of a certain degree of misinterpretation. Sometimes, there is evidence that those who reject this approach are influenced by a caricature of it in terms of a being frozen into complete immobility throughout endless time. But to accept that image as an adequate characterization of the traditional view would be to confuse it with a position already rejected, namely that which combines divine sempiternity with immutability. An atemporal being cannot be frozen in endless immobility because it does not exist in time. Since it does not exist in time it cannot exist throughout endless time. A second source of confusion lies in the analogy which is often drawn between the timelessness of God and the timelessness of subsistent entities such as numbers, concepts and propositions. M. Kneale writes: 'All that is meant by calling mathe matical truths " timeless " is that there is no point in asking when two and two are four in the same way that there is point in asking when the daffodils are in bloom.'5 Such a privative notion of atemporality may represent the opinion of a few writers, but it can hardly be an adequate account of the mainstream position. Indeed, it seems endemic to the traditional position not only that it is denied that temporality is a limiting condition of God's being but also that at the same time temporal predicates should be attributed to him! Thus Anselm could write: 'You were not, therefore, yesterday, nor will You be tomorrow, but yesterday and today and tomorrow You are. Indeed You exist neither yesterday nor today nor tomorrow but are absolutely outside all time. For yesterday and today and tomorrow are completely in time; however, You, though nothing can be without You, are nevertheless 1 See W.

'1 Yet he can go on to assert: 'You therefore permeate and embrace all things; You are before and beyond all things. You are before all things of course since, before they came to be, You already are.'2 If this language is not irremediably confused it must be the case that the divine eternity is not being thought of in terms of the timelessness of logical or mathematical truths, to the truth value of which temporal considerations are simply irrelevant. This problem disappears once the traditional doctrine of God's 'atemporal' eternity is seen as an instance of negative or apophatic theology. The great pains taken in the Old Testament to underline the differences in modes of being between God and creatures results, in the work of Philo of Alexandria, in the belief in the ineffability of God and in a consequent preference for negative attributes. H. A. Wolfson notes that in the works of Albinus and Plotinus the term 'remotion' (&amp;qpaipEats) is used in order to describe such negative language as opposed to terms signifying mere negation or privation. In the case of negation by remotion the opposite of the proposition can in no case be asserted, whereas in other cases it may. This is because negation by remotion serves to exclude a subject from the universe of discourse of the logical type to which both the original predicate and its simple negation are appropriate. Thus to say that God is not good, in a remotive sense, is to say neither that he lacks goodness nor that he is evil. It is rather to assert obliquely that he is the kind of being in relation to whom literal or univocal goodness, i.e. goodness as experienced by us in finite beings, is only asserted at the price of committing a category mistake.3 Nevertheless, there is an implication that he will possess some property which is in some significant way analogous to the original, but which is appropriate to his special nature. Averroes refers to this type of eternity, proper to the divine nature, when he says: 'There are two kinds of existence: one in the nature of which there is motion, and which cannot be separated from time; the other in the nature of which there is no motion and which is eternal and cannot be described. '4 The 'atemporal' eternity of God is not, then, the mere absence or irrelevance of time, but rather a mode of existence less limiting or constricting than the temporal. The relationship between the two is described by Plato as that of image and paradigm: 'We call time an eternal moving image of the eternity which remains for ever at one. '5 This phrase, re-echoing down the centuries, is the key to the traditional interpretation of God's eternity. Much later, in quite a different milieu, Ralph Cudworth was to reiterate this claim: 'Time is an image of the uncreated duration of 1 Anselm, P, 141, 3. 2 Anselm, P, 143 3 H. A.

As the sensible world was created as an image of the intelligible world, so was time created together with the world as an image of eternity. '1 It seems clear that the 'movement' of time referred to in the Timaeus is the circular paths which the heavenly bodies were believed to follow. These were closely connected with the 'circle of the year' during which the annual changes of the seasons, the annual cycle of life, death and rebirth is revealed in the natural world. In a single cycle each successive stage is exhibited in a continuous series, one after the other. By contrast, it is held that God possesses his being in complete and undivided plenitude. Speaking of his own concept of ultimate reality, Plotinus claimed: We know it as a life, changelessly motionless and ever holding the universal (time, space and phenomena) in actual presence; not this now and not that other, but always without part or interval. All its content is in immediate concentration on one point: nothing in it ever knows development; all remains identical within itself, knowing nothing of change, for ever in a NOW, since nothing of it has passed away or will come into being, but what it is now, that it is for ever.2 The divine eternity is not the barren timelessness of subsistent entities but rather a mode of being in which the fulness of life is possessed in a simple and indivisible totality. It is the mode of existence proper to the Source and Ground of Being. It is for this reason that Spinoza could define 'eternity' as 'existence itself'.3 From within our time-bound situation we can only use temporal language concerning this divine 'hyper-temporality'. Yet if we cannot experience this mode of being, it does not follow that our language concerning it is vacuous. What we may not be able to imagine we may nevertheless be able to understand, since there may be analogues to it within our experience. R. W. Hepburn has drawn our attention to the way in which the mind grasps the notes we hear during the performance of a piece of music. In apprehending the notes as parts of a whole the mind seems to transcend the immediate present.4 This is no less true of our grasp of language. More striking perhaps is the experience of being so absorbed in the appreciation of something which is exerting a fascination over us that time itself seems suspended. Two collections of such experiences by M. Paffard, gleaned largely from auto biographical literature, are replete with such phrases as 'timeless moment' and 'in time yet out of it '.' Perhaps in discussing this notion of eternity it is misleading and unhelpful to lay too much stress on the term 'time'. Such terms as 'temporal existence' and 'eternal existence' or 'temporal life' and 1 R. Cudworth, The True Intellectual System of the Universe (London, I820), p. 396. 2 Plotinus, Enneads, tr. S.

The positive aspect of eternal life is that it is claimed to be more fully life than its temporal counterpart. It is in moments of great concentration, with their heightened awareness of the present and consequent unawareness of the passage of time, that we come closest to the experience of such an eternity ourselves. If totally absorbed in the appreciation of some sublime musical creation or a punch on the jaw, in this state of clarity or fixity of focus upon some object of our attention we may be considered to experience something analogous to eternity. But what is positive about such experience is its vividness, force and plenitude, and not merely the attenuation of our awareness of the passage .of time. Using, as we must, the language of time-bound existents, we can nevertheless express this concept by echoing the famous definition of Boethius to the effect that eternity is 'the complete, simultaneous and perfect possession of everlasting life '.1 THE COHERENCE OF DIVINE ATEMPORALITY This traditional notion of eternity, far removed as it is from current preoccupations, fads and fashions, has been subjected to searching and rigorous criticism. Since it would be impracticable to attempt to deal with each one separately, or in the space available to deal with any one as fully as it may deserve, I shall simply indicate in a general way the most important types of attack and the general approach which might be adopted towards each in order to show them to be irrelevant or lacking in force. The general epistemological difficulty which arises when sense-bound language is used to refer to alleged realities which lie beyond the world of the senses may be resolved by reference to a twofold analysis of the language of eternity. Negative claims may be interpreted in a remotive sense as is customary in apophatic theology. Affirmative statements may be understood in analogical senses, the ground of the relevant analogies being experiences of the types cited by Hepburn and Paffard alluded to above. Other objectors purport to detect incompatible elements in the traditional concept. E. Baltazar sees a contradiction in supposing that there could be a mode of being which is both non-temporal and yet which is analogous to the temporal.2 But what is being denied of the divine eternity is univocal temporality. What is being asserted of it is something different from but analogous to temporal existence. In this there is no contradiction. More usually, some incoherence is alleged in the idea of God's possessing such a mode of being. R. Coburn sees an incompatability between the sort 1 Boethius, CP, p. I63. 2 E. Baltazar, 'Evolutionary perspectives and the divine', in Traces of God in a Secular Culture (New York, I973).</page><page sequence="10">i86 J. L. TOMKINSON of being God is supposed to be, i.e. a person, and the sort of mode of being eternity is supposed to be: Surely it is a necessary condition of anything's being a person that it should be capable (logically) of, among other things, doing at least some of the following: remembering, anticipating, reflecting, deliberating, deciding, intending and acting intentionally. To see that this is so, one need only ask oneself whether anything which necessarily lacked all of the capabilities noted would, under any conceivable circumstances, count as a person. But now an eternal being would necessarily lack all of these capacities inasmuch as their exercise by a being clearly requires that the being exist in time. After all, reflection and deliberation takes time..." This extremely popular objection2 seems to involve the critic in more than a small measure of anthropomorphism. Traditionally, God is said to be a person, to know, exercise free will, act, etc., all of which for time-bound persons take time or take place in time. But when God is said to be a person, it is not intended in traditional thought that he is like a time-bound finite person. It is rather that in God's dealings with us we recognize that we are confronted with a being fundamentally different from us in nature, yet that dealing with God is far unlike dealing with sub-personal forms of life. On the contrary, what is distinctively personal is more rather than less prominent in dealings with God, i.e. he is 'super-personal' or 'hyper-personal'. Finite human personality is simply the ground of an analogy between human and divine natures. Similar considerations may be applied to other concepts cited. Those which necessarily entail reference to past or future, such as memory and anticipation may be regarded as signs of imperfection and finitude in the creatures capable of them. There is no reason to suppose that the ability to exercise those capacities is a necessary condition of being in some sense personal, only a necessary condition of being univocally personal where the use of that term is tied to the sorts of persons of which we have sense experience. We may not be able to imagine what hyper-personality amounts to, but there is no reason why we may not understand something of this mode of being on the basis of experiences which act as grounds of analogy, of the logic of the concept 'God' and of some form of revelation. There is, of course, a primafacie difficulty in reconciling this view of eternity with the christian belief in the Incarnation, the hypostatic union of timeless God and time-bound man in one Christ. Barth finds such a union impossible, and is therefore compelled to posit a God inextricably enmeshed in the flux of time.3 Moreover, the Incarnation is customarily said to be the divine response to a previous state of affairs, namely the Fall. The problem, however, of reconciling the results of philosophical theology with the claims of some revelation must always, insofar as philosophical theology is concerned, lie with the advocates of the revelation in question. It is hardly incumbent 1 R. Coburn, 'Professor Malcolm on God', Australasian Journal of Philosophy, XL, I (I962-3), I55. 2 E.g. N. Pike, God and Timelessness (London, I970), pp. 12 I-9; R. G. Swinburne, CT, pp. 221-2 . C. Barth, Church Dogmatics (Edinburgh, I957), V. ii. (i).</page><page sequence="11">DIVINE SEMPITERNITY AND ATEMPORALITY I87 upon the philosopher to demonstrate the compatibility of his findings with whatever may be advanced as the fruit of some revelation. This is an important methodological point. If an analysis of the received concept of God, i.e. as supreme being, leads to a conclusion which seems at odds with those of revelation, the former may claim the credentials of reason, the analysis being open to inspection by all concerned. If and insofar as the supporting reasoning seems cogent it has a claim upon us logically prior to that of the interpretation of some special experience. It may be argued that if God exists outside time then time must ultimately be unreal, since reality is the world as God perceives it. A. C. Ewing has met this criticism by reference to McTaggart's distinction between the A-series and B-series of temporal relations.' He concedes that the A-series of past, present andfuture will only be perceived as such by time-bound creatures, but that the B-series of before, contemporary with and after may be apparent to a timeless God. 'As for a being who was non-spatial considering the spatial world as a whole, Manchester would still be such and such a distance from Moscow, though no place in the world would be 'here' or such and such a distance away for such a being. '2 Thus if A-series relations could be reduced to B-series relations, and Ewing argues cogently that they can, time would be real for an eternal being which could appreciate the B-series relations. But even if this rejoinder were to prove ineffective, it may be noted that the so-called difficulty arises out of an unwarranted assumption that 'time' must be as we perceive it. It may be that our necessarily limited apprehension is inadequate to support a correct and objective characterization of time. There is, moreover, no reason to suppose God's apprehension of time to be limited to the B-series relations above. Although in the traditional view himself unconditioned by time, God is also said to create and to sustain in being all creatures which are so limited. He may experience the passage of time in the creatures which he thus maintains in being. Some writers had seen in the supposed limitation upon God's experience of the passage of time a threat to his omniscience.3 But presumably an immanent Creator might know his creation intimately in virtue of his special relation to it. While himself free of all temporal constraints he might nevertheless understand and appreciate temporality 'as from within' in virtue of the relation of creative causality which he holds to all temporal things. CONCLUSION On the one hand, it has been shown that there are some special difficulties in accepting the view that the proper mode of being to attribute to God were 1 A. C.

Swinburne, 'The Timelessness of God', Church Quarterly Review (I965), p. 336, note I 7.</page><page sequence="12">i88 J. L. TOMKINSON he to exist would be that of sempiternity. On the other hand, it has been argued that the difficulties which are raised against the traditional view that an existent God would exist outside time seem to lack force upon investigation. They seem to arise and to have force only because of some tacit anthro pomorphism, or because of a tendency to identify the limits of the possible with the limits of our experience, or because of an inadequate understanding of the traditional concept of timeless eternity itself. Should we, then, simply conclude that there is little to choose between them, or that neither view can properly be adopted with confidence? Although this may seem on the face of it a reasonable and fair-minded position to adopt, it fails to take account of two crucial factors. The former is that the logic of the concept 'God' compels us always to attribute to God the less restrictive of any two properties which are comparable. This is because it is not coherent to suppose that there might be a being less restricted in the exercise of its nature and being than God. But this will impell us to adopt, if possible, the position that the traditional notion of eternity is the one appropriately attributable to God, unless of course that concept should turn out to be itself incoherent. That this state of being is less restrictive than that of sempiternity we may be reminded by Plutarch: and we in turn reply to him 'Thou art', as rendering unto him a form of address which is truthful, free from deception, and the only one befitting him only, the assertion of Being.... But God is (if there be need to say so), and He exists for no fixed time, but for the everlasting ages which are immovable, timeless and undeviating, in which there is no earlier nor later, no future nor past, no older nor younger; but He, being One, has with only one 'Now' completely filled 'For ever'; and only when being is after His pattern is it in reality Being, not having been nor about to be, nor has it had a beginning nor is it destined to come to an end. Under these conditions, therefore, we ought, as we pay Him reverence, to greet Him and to address Him with the words, 'Thou art... " It is, then, the eternity of atemporality, or rather of hypertemporality, which should be thought of as the mode of being appropriate to divinity. Yet the arguments to the effect that this concept is incoherent can hardly be said to have been confuted fully and decisively. Indeed, we have no guarantee that there is not some argument, not considered above, which itself constitutes an irrefutably damning condemnation of this concept. A concept thought to be coherent may, on reflection, turn out to be incoherent. We are not infallible in such matters, so that even if no arguments were ever formulated against the coherence of some concept, that concept might nevertheless turn out always to have been incoherent. But this should not be cause for undue worry, since it is true of every concept. The bare logical possibility that we should be mistaken concerning the coherence of a certain 1 Plutarch, 'The E at Delphi', 17, 20, in Plutarch's Moralia v, tr. F. C. Babbitt (London, I957), pp. 239, 245</page><page sequence="13">DIVINE SEMPITERNITY AND ATEMPORALITY I89 concept, while it should be freely and openly acknowledged, has of itself no force against it. The logical possibility of our being mistaken about a concept is not itself a flaw in the concept, it is at worst the logical possibility of a flaw in our understanding of it. We cannot, moreover, justify the claim that all our terms are coherent before we use them. It is not a practical possibility. Nor ought we to adopt a procedure which would be a form of Cartesian scepticism carried to absurd lengths. There is, then, a burden of proof upon anyone wishing to establish the incoherence of a concept in common use. It is contended that the arguments directed at proving the incoherence of the traditional concept of God's timeless eternity have not clearly and decisively attained their goal. The inconclusive state of the argument does not, however, justify a neutral stance in relation to the relative merits of that concept and the now fashionable notion of God's sempiternal being. The logic of 'God' compels us to stand by the traditional position until driven from it by an unequivocal and unavoidable proof of incoherence. God, it should be concluded, if he exists, must be thought of as existing in some manner which is devoid of the limitations inherent in temporality, and which is more fully life than anything which we time-bound prisoners can imagine.</page></plain_text>
