<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Feast of Dasara in the City of Mysore by Fabio Scialpi 1. Introduction As well as being one of the most popular and spectacular of festivities, the Durg?p?j? is also one of the richest in religious elements of all the Hindu calendar. It is celebrated with various names throughout the whole of India and in Nepal, in the big cities 0 and in the little villages scattered over the vast areas of countryside and tucked away in isolated mountain regions ("). It lasts ten days (3), during which many varied public and domestic rites are per (-) This study was carried out as a part of a research financed by the Consiglio Na zionale delle Ricerche (CNR) on the subject of 'Religious Anthropology of India. Feasts, rites and values in the popular culture of present-day India'. The study was also conducted taking into consideration two other researches financed by the Ministry of Education on the following subjects: 'The Lexicon of Smarta Ritual' (University of Turin; Director: Prof. S. Piano) and 'The Indian Mother Goddess' (University of Rome 'La Sapienza'). In par? ticular, the study represents the preliminary results of a field enquiry carried out in the city of Mysore (Karnataka) in September-October 1984. The original text, here completely revised and enlarged, was presented as a contribution to the international Colloquium 'Authority and Power in the Indian Subcontinent* organized by the University of Trieste from November 29th to December 1st 1984. Subsequently it was also the subject of two lectures held respectively on May 9th 1985 at IsMEO, in the presence of H.E. Homi J.H. Taleyarkhan, the Ambassador of India, and on April 22nd 1986 at the Centro Piemontese di Studi sul Medio ed Estremo Oriente (CESMEO) of Turin. The author wishes to thank Dr I. McGil vray for his accurate translation. (A) Suffice it to recall the truly impressive quality of the feast in Calcutta. Here we observed the Durg?p?j? during two missions held in 1976 and 1978. (2) One example is the celebration in the village of Gorkha observed by Giuseppe Tucci during his Nepal expedition of 1952 when, still unspoilt by mass tourism, the country pre? served intact the essential features of its traditional culture (G.T., Tra giungle e pagode, Roma 1953, pp. 43-46). Due to the influence exerted by Hindu culture, the feast is also observed in various ethnological cultures with, for example, the name of Dashera (or Dassera) (see fn. 9 and 10) among the Gonds of Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh (P. Juliusson, The Gonds and their Religion, Stockholm 1974, pp. 143, 159; C. von F?rer Haimendorf, The Gonds of Andhra Pradesh, London 1979, pp. 469-72); the name of Dasai among the Mundas of Chota Nagpur in Bihar (S.C. Roy, The Mundas and their Country, Calcutta 1912, p. 479); and with the name of Dasae Parab among the Santals of Bihar (J. Troisi, Tribal Religion. Religious Beliefs and Practices among the Santals, New Delhi 1979, pp. 214-16). (3) Some authors, however, consider the tenth day ? that of Vijay?dasami ? as a separate celebration following immediately on the one lasting nine days and nine nights [1] 105</page><page sequence="2">formed with an enormous expense of energy and resources involving all social levels and practically every single individual. It is, moreover, one of the most complex and puzzling of all the Hindu festivities, with many themes interweav? ing about the main core. The complexity starts with its very name. Apart from the already men? tioned name of Durg?p?j? and the rather similar name of Durg?mahotsava (or Durgotsava) (4), the celebration has also been given (or rather con-fused with) many other names, including Navar?tri (or Navar?tra) (5), Mah?navami (?), R?mli I? (7), Vijay?dasami (3), Dasahar? (9) and Dasar? (10). Above and beyond the (whence the name 'Navar?trP). See fn. 8. According to other sources, the Durg?p?j? lasts only three days, taking place from the seventh to the ninth day of the ten-day festive period (Imperial Record Department, An Alphabetical List of the feasts and Hol? idays of the Hindus and Muhammadans, Calcutta 1914, p. 20). (4) Mention of this name for the feast can be found in one of the earliest writings by western authors on the Hindu religious calendar. It is by William Jones, who traced out the basic pattern of the calendar on the basis of the Tithitattva by Raghunandana (16th century) (W.J., The Lunar Year of the Hindus' in The Works of Sir William Jones, vol. IV, London 1807, p. 127). See also, among others: P.V. Kane, History of Dharmas?stra (Ancient and Mediaeval Religious and Civil Law in India), vol. V, pt I, Poona 1958, chapter IX, p. 154 et seq.\ G.

(Navar?tri, Durg?p?j?) for the same festive event may seem surprising; in reality, however, it appears quite justified, as we shall see, by the close connection of the victory of Rama over R?vana, described in the R?m?yana, with the figure and myth of Durg? which are at the centre of the celebration we are concerned with, A.C. Mukerji (Hindu Fasts and Feasts, 106 [2]</page><page sequence="3">regional variations that can be granted in such a vast country, these names rep? resent the most immediately striking sign of the many varied problems the feast poses for the specialist in Indian civilization. As could well be imagined, given the fundamental importance and the great number of functions Hinduism has assigned to her from the earliest times to the present day, the documentation Allahabad 1916, p. 119) takes a different view, seeing the R?mlil? and the Durg?p?j? as two celebrations held independently the one from the other, though associated in popular tradition (but both are not always to be found in all regions of India)., On the association between the hero's exploit (or, at any rate, his adventures) and the feast of Dasar? (or the Durg?p?j?) see, for example: J. Tod, op. cit., p. 467; Monier Williams, op. cit., pp. 183-84; Abbe J.A. Dubois, op. clt.y p. 622, fn. 1; Imperial Record Department, op. cit., p. 83, fn. 2; M.M. Underhill, The Hindu Religious Year, Calcutta 1921, pp. 54-55; R.E. Enthoven, The Folklore of Bombay, Oxford 1924, p. 122; J.H. Hutton, Caste in India. Its Nature, Function, and Origins, Bombay 19634 (repr. 1973, p. 241). (8) This is the name used to refer to the 'tenth day of the victorious Goddess*. Ac? cording to some scholars, this tenth day forms part of the Durg?p?j?, marking its climax (Monier Williams, op. cit., p. 183; G. Tucci, Tra giungle e pagode, cit., p. 43). Accord? ing to others, however, the Vijay?dasami represents a different celebration. This opinion is well-established and can be met with from the early decades of the last century. Thus, according to Ch. Coleman [The Mythology of the Hindus, London 1832, p. 87), who refers to the observations of a previous author, on the western side of India, only the first nine days of celebration were dedicated to the worship of Durg?, while the tenth day was con? sidered a separate celebration in honour of R?ma and Arjuna, extolling their heroic victories. Simi? larly, (Imperial Record Department, op. cit., p. 83) the Vijay?dasami, while coinciding with the day on which the image of Durg?, who is worshipped during the Durg?p?j?, is consigned to the waters, represents a different celebration from the former, commemorating the victory of R?ma over R?vana. See also: B.A. Gupte, op. cit., pp. 180, 245, 273; M.M. Underhill, op. cit., p. 53; and V.S. Apte (The Student's Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Delhi, repr. 1970, p. 509, under the heading 'Vijay?'), who mentions a celebration in honour of Durg? ? the Vijayotsava ? held on the tenth day of the bright fortnight in the month of ?svina. Finally, M. Biardeau (op. cit., pp. 46-47) appears to consider the Vijay?dasami the con? clusion of the Navar?tri (or Durg?p?j?). However, distinction is made among the regional variations of the feast: in practically the whole of the north and part of Maharashtra, the Durg?p?j? commemorates the Goddess' victory over the demon-buffalo and is therefore characterized by the sacrifice, real or symbolic, of a buffalo on the eighth day of the cel? ebration (Durg?stami); in the south, on the other hand, this sacrifice is not performed and, generally speaking, the Durg?p?j? is ignored in favour of the Vijay?dasami. A direct link between the Vijay?dasami with the Goddess' exploit and the sacrifice of the buffalo (and so the Durg?p?j? itself) is, therefore, not evident. (9) This is the name for the tenth and last day of our celebration (Monier Williams, op. cit., p. 183; Id., Religious Thought and Life in India. Vedism, Br?hmanism and Hinduism, London 1883, repr. New Delhi 1974, p. 431; W. Crooke, op. cit., p. 29; J. Gonda, op. cit., p. 329); or rather, it indicates both a celebration in honour of the Ganges and one in honour of Durg?, held on the tenth day of ?svina (Imperial Record Department, op. cit., pp. 15-16; V.S. Apte, op. cit., p. 247, under the heading 'Dasahar?'; cf. Monier Williams, A Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Oxford 1899, repr. London 1970, p. 472, under the heading 'Dasahar?'). However, others (e.g. A.C. Mukerji, op. cit., p. 63; M.M. [3] 107</page><page sequence="4">on the Mother Goddess Durg? (and thus on the celebration dedicated to her) is vast. It spans an extraordinarily long time, involving both the classical sources of Br?hmanism and those relating to regional or outlying cultures, and requires knowledge and grounding in various disciplines. However, the scholar finds himself up against a task that, like the image of the Goddess, has two different facets: one peaceful, the other terrifying ("). On the one hand, one is daunted by such a hard task and, on the other hand, the prospects of reaping many in? teresting results are alluring. I shall limit myself here to pointing out that inquiry into this intricate subject matter means covering the various phases of a historical process that has often seen the most vital creative energy of Hindu Underhill, op. cit., pp. 101-2) hold that the two celebrations of Dasahar? and Dasar?, despite the similarity of their names, were quite separate and should therefore not be con? fused. The latter name is probably a corruption of the former; however, it still remains to be explained how a name used for the celebration of the Ganges observed between May and June (in the month of Jyaistha) could also then go on to mark the autumn celebration (in the month of ?svina) in honour of Durg? (Imperial Record Department, op. cit., p. 16; cf. J. Gonda, op. cit., p. 329). Among the reasons that may have led to this transition, we should not ignore the possibility of some typological analogy. The Dasahar? (or Gangotsava, or Gangap?j?), like the Dasar? (see below, section 2), seems to show some of the features of a celebration of a new beginning: for example, it takes place immediately before the rainy season, includes sacrifices and rites of expiation and purification, and is based on a myth suggesting rivalry and conflict between men (Sagara and his sons) and superhuman beings (divinities, especially Indra), followed by the victory of the latter (Kapila, the in? carnation of Visnu, keeper of the established order) over the former (Sagara's sons). See also, among others: H.H. Wilson, The Religious Festivals of the Hindus', JRAS, vol. IX (1848), pp. 68-69; Imperial Record Department, op. cit., pp. 15-16; A.C. Mukerji, op. cit., pp. 64-65; M.M. Underhill, op. cit., pp. 101-3; cf. J. Dowson, A Classical Dictionary of Hindu Myth? ology and Religion, Geography, History, and Literature, London 1879 (repr. Bhopal, 12th ed., n.d., pp. 271-72, under the heading 'Sagara'). (10) Ch. Coleman, op. cit., pp. 83, 86-88; Abbe J.A. Dubois, op. cit., p. 569; Im? perial Record Department, op. cit., p. 16; Swami Sivananda, op. cit., p. 11 et seq. The name Dasar? is equivalent to Vijay?dasamI (Imperial Record Department, op. cit., p. 16; A.C. Mukerji, op. cit., p. 124; M.M. Underhill, op. cit., p. 55; M. Biardeau, op. cit., p. 47). With this name (pronounced and transliterated in various ways) the festivity is observed not only in Karnataka (the region of Mysore and thus of the celebration we are particularly concerned with) but also in other states in the north and south of India, e.g. Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. See the publications of the Census of India 1961 dealing with the festive and religious occasions in the various states (Part VII-B, Fairs and Festivals): vol.

Moreover, it offers an opportunity to devise new research methods to verify and complete text data with ethnographic data collected through field work in the past and in the present. The field, in this case, being the country of India, with its practically matchless range of human interest and rare beauty. 2. The period of the celebration Our attempt to understand the nature and meaning of the Durg?p?j? and to identify the original stratum underlying the complex of cultural accretions can conveniently be approached from the period of the celebration. We shall there? fore consider the place it occupies in the Hindu calendar, which represents the ordinary time sequence to which the cultural implications of the celebration are to be related. We can, in fact, reasonably suppose that the period of celebration takes on different meanings according to the position it occupies in the custom? ary time sequence. The Durg?p?j? is celebrated during the first ten days (13) of the bright fortnight (14) in the month of ?svina, corresponding to a period spanning the (12) See the brilliant method of inquiry adopted by M. Biardeau, based on the inte? gration of textual analysis with ethnographical data collected through field work (M.B., op. cit., pp. 43-53; cf. S. Piano, Prefazione to M. Riardeau's LTnduismo. Antropologia di una civilta, It. transl., Milano 1985, pp. 7-11). (13) This is obviously so if one considers the Vijay?dasami as an integral part of the celebration and not, as some maintain, a festivity in its own right following on the pre? vious one. See fn. 8 and 3. (H) In a few words, the year of the traditional Hindu calendar is luni-solar (sam vat sard), combining both systems for measuring time based on the sun and the moon. According to this calendar, the beginning of the civil and religious year is as a rule deter? mined by the new moon immediately preceding the first day of the solar year, when the sun enters the zodiac sign of Aries (Mesa) at the spring equinox. The year consists of twelve lunar months, and each lunar month comprises a bright fortnight (suklapaksa) and a dark one (krsnapaksa), and the month may begin with either of these. Thus, in some regions, the month begins with the bright fortnight, on the day following the new moon, and ends with the day of the following new moon, which brings the dark half to a close ('new-moon system', am?nta)\ in other regions it starts with the dark fortnight, the day after the full moon, and ends with the day of the succeeding full moon ('full moon system', p?rnim?nta). In south India, in Bengal and Maharashtra, the former system is followed. See: R. Sewell, S.B. Dikshit, The Indian Calendar, London 1896, pp. 2-32; M.M. Underhill, op. cit., pp. 16-23; R.K. Trivedi in Census of India 1961, Gujarat, cit., section III, pp. 37-49, 56-57; A.L. Basham, The Wonder that was India. A survey of the history and culture of the Indian sub-continent before the coming of the Muslims, London 1967s (repr. 1969, pp. 494-95); J.L.A.

[5] 109</page><page sequence="6">end of September and the beginning of October in the Gregorian calendar. In 1984 the celebration took place between September 26th and October 4th (1S). It comes immediately after the dark fortnight of the month of Bh?dra, dedicated to the sr?ddha, or cult of the dead It coincides with the autumnal equinox (23rd September) (1T), a very significant point as the Vikrama era (Vikram Samvat) (18) ? one of the main eras in Indian chronology ? was originally held (15) September 25th was the day of the new moon. In accordance with the system described the feast therefore commenced at the beginning of the bright half of the month of ?svina. Paradoxically, however, not on the first day, which that year appeared to have been skipped, but on the following day (September 26th). This explains why the ten days of the feast corresponded in 1984 to only nine days in our calendar (September 26th-October 4th). (16) M.M. Underhill, op. cit., pp. 65, 112-15. This author offers evidence of the wide? spread belief that, in this period, when the sun enters the sign of Virgo, the spirits left the house of Yama and returned to occupy their descendents' dwellings. He also mentions that the rite on behalf of the spirits included various offerings, among which, in particular, at the end of the ritual meal served to the Br?hmans who were invited to represent the dead, balls of rice. These balls were not eaten by the guests, but thrown into the fire or given to a cow. According to a custom observed among the lowest castes, on the day of the new moon of Bh?drapada, called 'Sarvapitri am?v?sy?' ('All Fathers' new moon'), balls of flour or rice were given to the crows, believed to be the spirits of the dead. Balls of rice were, therefore, reserved for the spirits of the dead. This has, more? over, been a typically funereal kind of offering from the Vedic period to the present day (Monier Williams, Religious Thought, etc., cit., p. 285; J. Gonda, Die Re? ligionen Indiens, I. Veda und ?lter Hinduismus, Stuttgart 1960; Fr. transl., Les reli? gions de ITnde, L Vedisme et Hindouisme ancien, Paris 1962, pp. 164-68; S.H. Black? burn, 'Death and Deification: Folk Cults in Hinduism', HR, vol. 24, Feb. 1985, pp. 264-65). Considering the exclusive nature of this offering and the fact that celebration of the Durg?p?j? comes so near harvest time (see below), it seems possible that the balls of rice may represent an offering of first fruits to the spirits of the dead on the occasion of (or very close to) the feast. For the association between the offering of first fruits to the spirits of the dead and ancestors, the ritual consumption of new rice, the harvesting of this crop, the cult of the Earth Mother and celebration of the feast of Dassera (Dasar?) among the Gonds of Andhra Pradesh, see C. von F?rer-Haimendorf, op. cit., pp. 469-71. The offering of first fruits and return of the dead are typical features of New Year feasts in various cultures (V. Lanternari, La grande festa. Storia del Capodanno nelle civilt? primitive, Milano 1959, pp. 104-5, 117-20, 122-23, 128-29, 314-17). Our celebration also includes some features typical of New Year feasts (see below). Apart from previous remarks on the connection with the spirits of the dead, it seems significant that the first day of the Durg?p?j?, coinciding with the first day of the bright half of the month of ?svina, is still the occasion ? at least with the 'am?nta system' ? for another funeral rite, the m?t?maha sr?ddha, celebrated by the grandson for his maternal grandfather (M.M. Underhill, op. cit., p. 115). (17) W. Crooke, op. cit., p. 29. (18) Tradition has it that the Vikrama era was established by a king named Vikram? ditya to celebrate his victory over the Sakas in 58 B.C., and their expulsion from Ujjayinl. 110 [6]</page><page sequence="7">to begin with the month of K?rttika (3 9) which in fact corresponded approximately to the autumnal equinox (20). (Later, however, the beginning was fixed with the month of Caitra, between March and April in the western calendar, cor? responding to the entry of the sun into Aries with the spring equinox) (21). Originally, therefore, falling at the time of the autumnal equinox, the Dur? g?p?j? marked the moment of transition from one year's cycle to the next. As this also corresponded by and large to the end of the south-west monsoon (22), it also marked the change of seasons (2:i). In terms of economic activities, more? over, it marked the time to harvest the summer crops {kharif) (24) including rice, which could also be ripe for harvesting ("*). Nowadays, however, the cul? tivation of rice which is, of course, India's major crop ("*), shows some vari? ation from the phasing of the traditional cycle. It is still harvested at this time It was generally observed in north India where, in fact, it can still be found, though retained merely out of respect for tradition. Among others, see: R.

Basham, op. cit., p. 496. The month of K?rttika comes immediately after ?svina, roughly corresponding to a lunation between October and November. (20) M.M. Underhill, op. cit., p. 16. (21) Ibid., pp. 16-17. However, the beginning of Vikram Samvat was not observed uniformly in all the regions. For example, in Gujarat the Vikram Samvat was mostly k?rttik?di, i.e. it began ? as indeed it originally had ? with the month of K?rttika, while in some parts of Kathiavad and Gujarat it was ?s?dh?di, beginning with the month of ?s?dha, between June and July (R, Sewell, S.B. Dikshit, op. cit., p. 41; R.K. Trivedi, op. cit., pp. 39, 47-48). Nowadays the official national calendar of India begins with the month of Caitra and follows the Saka era (R.K. Trivedi, op. cit., pp. 45-46; J.L.A. Filliozat, Hindu Calendar, cit., p. 622). (22) J. Tod, op. cit., p. 464; W. Crooke, op. cit., p. 39; Fr.

Modern agricultural technology and the recent change in consti? tutional organization in Karnataka (30), together with the long-dating innovation in the calendar described above, have combined to confuse the economic and institutional background to the celebration (see below). We can therefore conclude by stating that the Durg?p?j? was originally a feast of the New Year (31). Interpretation of the various rites forming the bulk of this festivity can, then, best be carried out ? whatever the different meaning possibly attached to these rites by the faithful who have continued through the ages to perform them according to their traditions ? in the light of the specific typology of such celebrations, which the historians of religions already identified some time ago. Among them, an outstanding contribution was made by Mircea Eliade, who interpreted the ceremony of the New Year feast as the re-enaction of an archetypal event, namely 'the regeneration of the world and life through the (27) For certain kinds of rice, harvesting is carried out between September and October in some north-east regions (West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa), in various northern regions (Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh) and in central India (Madhya Pradesh).

Tucci, ed., he civilta dell}Oriente, vol. I, Firenze-Roma 1956, repr. 1965, p. 738; P. Spear, The Oxford History of Modern India 1740-1975, Delhi 19782, pp. 406-7). As we shall see (see section 6), the figure of the mah?r?ja represented the fulcrum around which the entire Dasar? celebration revolved in Mysore. (31) The bibliography on this subject is very extensive, and we cannot give it all the attention it deserves here. For more details about the typology of New Year feasts, see in particular: A. van Gennep, Les rites de passage, Paris 1909 (repr. Paris-The Hague 1969, p. 254 et seq.); M. Eliade, he mythe de VStemel retour - ArchStypes et repetition, Paris 1949 (It. ed., II mito delVeterno ritorno - Archetipi e ripetizione, Torino 1968, chap? ter II, pp. 71-121); V.

On the feast of the New Year in Vedic India ? celebrated on the day of the full moon in the month of Agrah?yana ('Beginning of the year', also called M?rgaslrsa, be? tween November and December), see: A.B. Keith, The Religion and Philosophy of the Veda and Upanishads, Harvard 1925 (repr. Delhi 1976, pp. 362-63); J. Gonda, Les religions de ITnde, I, cit., pp. 155-56, see also pp. 195-96.

Brelich too had a happy intuition in this respect: as the 'sacred time' of the celebration is distinctly separated from every? day time thanks to the interruption of the customary work activities, 'the feast frees profane time for practical activities, which are thus released from the bonds of particular religious prescriptions' (33). In other words, the deliberate delimi? tation of sacred time at this particular point of the year serves to protect and assist the indispensable 'secular' activities belonging to the ordinary time sequence. 3. The divine figure As we have seen, some of the most common names for the feast involve the Goddess Durg?, and in particular her victorious fight celebrated in the myth (see section 4). The name of R?mlil?, referring to the deeds of the hero of the R?m?yana, may seem rather surprising as R?ma has nothing to do with the myth of the Goddess, re-evoking and celebrating an apparently totally different event. It is, however, worth pointing out that, from a structural point of view, R?ma's victory over the monster R?vana is not so very different from Durg?'s exploit against another monster, Mahis?sura. The parallel between these two exploits must, therefore, have seemed quite evident to the faithful, just as the victory of the fierce Goddess, who was in fact called 'Aindri' (34) in the Devtm?h?tmya (see section 4), must have seemed analogous with the triumph of the Vedic Indra over Vrtra (35). Moreover, tradition shows a number of links between the two i32) M. Eliade, op. cit., p. 85; Id., Tratte d'histoire des religions, Paris 1948 (Engl, transl., Patterns in Comparative Religion, London 1958, repr. 1983, pp. 398-404). (33) A.

(34) On the meaning of this epithet for the Goddess, which suggests close links with Indra, as the source of her power, see T.B, Coburn, Devi-M?h?tmya. The Crystallization of the Goddess Tradition, Delhi 1984, pp. 132-33. (35) On the many implications and interpretations of this myth, see, among others: J. Gonda, Les religions de ITnde, I, cit., pp. 73-79; R.C. Zaehner, Hinduism, London 1962, (New York ed. 1966, pp. 22-24); F.B.J. Kuiper, The Basic Concept of Vedic Religion', HR, vol. 15 (Nov. 1975), pp. 109-11; M. Eliade, Histoire des croyances et des idees reli gieuses, I. De Vage de la pierre aux mysteres d'Eleusis, Paris 1976, pp. 217-20. The analogy may well be extended yet further. The myth of Indra expressed an eternal truth for Vedic society, reality that could be made present ? thanks to the mystic force of the word and the power of the rite ? for the benefit of the sacrificer; thus succour was be? sought of the god in the face of every otherwise impossible difficulty (J. Gonda, ibid., pp. 33-38). Similarly, the myth of Durg? provided her devotees with the model for every victory (M. Biardeau, 'Mythe epique, etc.', cit., p. 53). It is for this very reason that [9] 113</page><page sequence="10">figures of the Goddess and R?ma. When the hero met with difficulties in resist? ing his adversary, he apparently invoked the help of the Goddess (36): thanks to her intercession, R?vana appears to have at last been killed, after a long struggle (37)&gt; on the eighth day consecrated to her {Durg?stami) (38), when the killing of Mahis?sura is commemorated and the buffalo sacrifice is performed (3!&gt;) as part of the Durg?p?j? celebrations. According to some, the celebration itself orig? inated with the homage R?ma paid to the Goddess (40). The feast is, therefore, dominated by the figure of the Goddess (41). She is an awesome, impetuous Goddess {candl, candik?) (42), represented with ten arms (dasabhuj?) (43), mounted on a lion (simhav?hini (44)? armed to the teeth (45), R?ma appeals to the Goddess at a crucial moment in his struggle with R?vana; similarly, in two much debated hymns in the Mah?bh?rata (see fn. 52-53), Yudhisthira and Arjuna appeal respectively to the Goddess beseeching victory (M. Biardeau, ibid., p. 53). C36) M.M. Underhill, op. cit., p. 55; M. Biardeau, 'Mythe epique, etc.', cit., p. 47.

Biardeau, 'Mythe epique, etc.', cit., p. 47. According to others, the death of R?vana corresponds to the ninth day of the Durg?p?j? (Monier Williams, Hinduism, cit., p. 184), or the tenth day of the festive period we are referring to (Imperial Record De? partment, op. cit., p. 16; M.M. Underhill, op. cit., p. 55). (39) M.

(41) This does not, however, imply that the celebration was always associated with a cult. Originally, given its position among the seasons and its function in the calendar, the celebration could have been observed independently of any divinity (cf. A. Brelich, Introdu zione, cit., pp. 51-52).

In these circumstances she does not play the usual role of Siva's consort reserved for her by orthodox Br?hman ism (47); rather, she seems to be destined to a splendid isolation as she could only contemplate marriage with one who had vanquished her in battle (48), and such an eventuality appears inconceivable (49). Nevertheless, incongruously enough by the lights of western logic, though not of mythical thinking (50), especially in India, the Goddess has been seen from the earliest times to the present day as a mother figure (51), lovingly protecting her children. To this we may add, in conclusion, that two hymns in the 4th and 6th books of the Mah?bh?rata respectively (52), excluded from the critical edition of the poem (53), describe her as a lover of intoxicating drinks, meat, animal victims (sidhum?msa pasupriy?), and buffalo blood {mahis?srkpriy?) (54). These features, together with her virginity (kum?rl) (55) and the fact that she came from shepherd stock Hindus in Northern India, London 19002 (repr. 1975, p. 73); G.

There is evidence to suppose that, orig? inally, the figure of the Goddess (Um?, Durg?, Gauri, etc.) was independent; subsequently, she appears to have been associated with Siva as consort (S. Bhattacharji, op. cit., pp. 158-59, 164; F. Scialpi, op. cit., p. 498). Even after this association, however, the Goddess could at times still appear superior to her husband for her devotees (J. Gonda, Les religions de ITnde, II, cit., p. 253; F. Scialpi, op. cit., pp. 490-91), and could even separate from him (G. Tucci, 'Induismo', cit., p. 598). (48) P. Jayakar, op. cit., p. 25.

There is one more point to be made, in conclusion, on the divinities ac? companying Durg? and shown together with her in the powerful, vigorous and often very costly images [pratima] (60) typical of the Durg?p?j?, for which Calcutta is rightly renowned (01). In keeping with the celebration of a new begin? ning, which is the point of this feast, apart from the Goddess the following are presented to our admiration: Ganesa, the guardian deity of all beginnings; Laksmi, whose concern is prosperity; Sarasvati, patron of literature and the arts; and, finally, K?rttikeya, the war lord armed with bow and arrows and perfectly at his ease in the context of the celebration of the Great Mother's struggle and victory. 4. The myths and the epic tradition We have already mentioned the myth underlying the celebration of Durg?'s feast which also gave inspiration to one of the most ancient and recurrent themes (5S) J. Dowson, op. cit., p. 87; J. Gonda, Les religions de ITnde, II, cit., p. 252; S. Bhattacharji, op. cit., pp. 159, 165, 167-68. (57) B.C. Mazumdar, 'Durga: Her Origin and History', JRAS, April 1906, pp. 355-62. It is truly impressive to observe the method adopted in this article written so long ago, combining textual analysis with data from an ethnographical inquiry. However, the con? clusions the author comes to are in direct contrast with those reached by Biardeau as regards the authenticity of the two above-mentioned hymns in the Mah?bh?rata (see fn. 52-53).

Mukerji, op. cit., pp. 120-21. (61) The amount of money traditionally spent to make the celebration as creditable as possible is considerable and, we feel, also serves to show the power and wealth of the families and communities involved (cf. Ch. Coleman, op. cit., pp. 83, 85). Generally, the most expensive items are the preparation and illumination of the pavillions (pand?l) and the pratim? that are placed inside them. Once they were specially made for all the families of a certain standing by craftsmen who had long-standing relations with them (Pratapachandra Ghosha, op. cit., pp. 4-5); nowadays, it seems very likely that the images are mostly bought at the market, already prepared by the craftsman according to his own inspiration or, especially in the case of larger images, ordered in advance. During our 1978 mission in Calcutta on the occasion of the Durg?p?j?, we noted that the budgets of two associations ('Forward Club' of Hazra Road and 'SatadaP of Southern Avenue) for the combined cel? ebrations of the Durg?p?j? and LaksmTp?j? the previous year amounted to 14,486 and 12,508 rupees respectively. 116 [12]</page><page sequence="13">in all classical and popular Indian art, namely 'Durg?mahisamardini' (*"). Suffice it here to add that it is recorded in a section of the M?rkandeya Pur?na (B3), the Devim?h?ttnya or Candlp?tha, where three myths (64)? linked by the function they attribute to the Goddess, are related. The function was to help overcome the power of the Asuras or directly oppose it, restoring order where they had created confusion (65). In the first myth the Goddess, invoked by Brahma when brought face to face with the dangerous Madhu and Kaitabha, withdraws from the body of Visnu who is sunk in cosmic sleep, thus allowing him to kill the two Asuras whom she has already ensnared with illusory power (ri6). In the second Candik?, the supreme form of the Goddess (fi7), massacres the Asuras who had defeated the gods, finally killing their leader, Mahisa, who had taken on the form of a buf? falo (whence the epithet 'Mahisasuramardim'). The third relates the Goddess' long struggle against the serried Asura ranks led by Sumbha and Nisumbha who had got the better of the gods. Among those slain on this occasion were Canda and Munda, whose combined names formed an epithet for the victorious Kali (HH), a fierce manifestation of Durg?, namely C?mund? (?), the name with which she is particularly venerated in the city of Mysore (70) (which was in turn so called in memory of Mahis?sura) (71). At last Sumbha and Nisumbha were also over? whelmed (and in memory of this exploit Durg? was at times to be called 'Nisum bhasumbhahananf) &gt;(72). (62) O.

The parallel patterns of the stories related in the second and third myths of the Devlm?h?tmya ?? respectively on the Goddess' struggle against Mahisa and her fight against Sumbha and Nisumbha ? can, according to this author, be accounted for with the fact that the two myths both originally came from one theme in which the Goddess, as protagonist, destroys various demons. The tale of Mahisa was, according to this version, only subsequently separated from the original nucleus to become [13] 117</page><page sequence="14">It would be superfluous to dwell on all the details of the myth here; suffice it to recall just three particularly significant points. The first is that, in the Candtp?tha, a rsi relates the Devi's exploits to king Suratha, who has sought refuge in the forest after having been driven from the throne of his earth embracing kingdom by the power of his enemies and the faithlessness of his ministers (73). Significantly, at the end of the Devtm?h?tmya it is the Goddess herself who promises the king that he will reconquer his lost kingdom. The Goddess is, in fact, no less concerned for the material well-being of her devotees than for their lasting bliss in the next life, according to a wish for complete hap? piness in both worlds which, curiously enough, we also found in Asoka (74) and, before him, in a famous inscription of Xerxes at Persepolis (75). When requested by the king, who had become a devotee of the Goddess after hearing the tale, she guaranteed victory over his enemies and the reappropriation of his kingdom for him and, after his death, the rebirth of the sun and the assumption of the role of Manu on earth in the following age (Manvantard) (76). Thus the king derived renewal and legitimization of his temporal authority, as well as his eventual investiture with a cosmic role, from the promise of the Goddess whose favour he had secured through his veneration. The second point we consider relevant once again concerns the figure of the king, together with that of the vaisya, like him exiled in the forest, sharing his spiritual quest addressed to the rsi and finally, again like him, enlightened by the ascetic's tale. The two of them established the cult of the Goddess, which was performed near a water-course. They vowed to follow a strictly ascetic existence. They fashioned an image of the Goddess in clay that was presumably obtained from the river bank, and performed the p?j? in her honour. They abstained from food, concentrating on deep meditation, and presented offerings an independent story {op. cit., pp. 148-49). Apart from anything else, it is worth noting the undoubted validity of the author's approach, using iconographical data (in this case from the Udayagiri reliefs) to shed light on the complex problems of Pur?nic mythology. (") F.E. Pargiter, op. cit., p. 466. (74) See our article, 'The Ethics of Asoka and the Religious Inspiration of the Achae menids', EW, vol. 34 (Sept. 1984), pp. 72-73. (75) Reference is to inscription H, 47-48, 54-56. For text and translation, see R.G. Kent, Old Persian, Grammar, Texts, Lexicon, New Haven, Connecticut, 1950, p. 151; for a recent interpretation of the passages referred to, see Gh. Gnoli, 'Asavan. Contributo allo studio del libro di Ard? Wir?z', in Gh. Gnoli, A.V. Rossi, eds., Iranica, Napoli 1979, pp. 410-13. The double prospects of happiness associated with piety-justice seem to have been a topos of the Achaemenid mentality (U. Bianchi, 'L'inscription "des daivas" et le zoroastrisme des Achemenides', RHR, vol. CXCII-1, July 1977, p. 7); it therefore seems reasonable that Asoka, like many other cultural elements introduced by the Mauryas probably deriving from the Achaemenids, can have taken inspiration from this. (76) F.E. Pargiter, op. cit., p. 523. 118 [14]</page><page sequence="15">bathed in their own blood. After these rites had been performed for three years, the Goddess appeared to them and granted their requests; the lost kingdom, for the present life, and government of the universe in the future era for the king, while the merchant, more modestly and perhaps even surprisingly, was only granted perfect knowledge (77). It is also worth noting that, in the part occupied by the ksatriya and the vaisya in their dealings with the Goddess and the estab? lishment of her cult, the context is totally devoid of representatives of the Br?hmanical class. In our opinion, this bears out the fact that Goddess and cult are quite removed from the most ancient Br?hmanical traditions and areas of in? fluence (78). Finally, the third element to be adduced from the myth is the generative power of the Great Mother, whose very nature practically exudes fecondity (7*). In fact, she promises the gods that, when the earth has been afflicted by drought and lack of water for a hundred years, her birth there will take place; she guaran? tees that she will nourish the world with plants sprouting from her very body (80) during a period of plentiful rainfall. For this reason, the Goddess is to be celebrated on earth with the name of S?kambhan, the 'bearer of vegetables' (81). So much is recounted in the Devim?h?tmya. But the mythical events linked to the feast are not confined to this text. We must also consider a legendary tale which has certain connections with the epic tradition of the Mah?bh?rata, even though it is not documented in the classical version of the poem. The tale appears to have inspired the celebration of the Vijay?dasaml (or Dasar?), either the climax of the Durg?p?j? or an entirely sep? arate feast following immediately upon it (82). It relates that, on the tenth day of the festive period, which in fact corresponds to the Dasar?, the five P?n davas went to retrieve the weapons they had hidden among the branches of a samt tree (83) before going in disguise to the court of Virata in the year following their twelve-year exile in the forest. At the end of the prescribed year they are (77) Ibid., pp. 522-23. (7?) Cf. F.E. Pargiter, Introduction, op. cit., pp. xi-xiii, xx. (79) S. Bhattacharji, op. cit., p. 161. (80) For this reason, on the occasion of some celebrations dedicated to her, the Goddess is identified with the crops. For the feast of Gangaur, Gauri is barley, wheat or rice. See: J. Tod, op. cit., p. 454; Abbe J.A. Dubois, op. cit., p. 568; F. Scialpi, op. cit., p. 486. (81) FJE. Pargiter, op. cit., pp. 517-18; cf. E.W. Hopkins, op. cit., p. 12, fn. ) (?) See fn. 3 and 8.

[15] 119</page><page sequence="16">said to have performed a p?j? to the samt; they retrieved their weapons and went to fight the Kauravas, finally defeating them (84). Actually, according to the classical version of the poem, it was Arjuna alone who, having almost completed the year spent incognito, went to retrieve his div? ine bow G?ndiva to fight the Kauravas who had attacked Virata's capital and plundered the cows during his absence. Having revealed himself to the king's fearful son, Uttara, he performed the pradaksin? around the tree and took back his weapons (85); he then put the enemy to flight, recovered the cattle, again hid his bow and arrows (8G), urged that messengers be sent to Virata to announce the victory and that the credit should go to Uttara (8T) with whom he returned to the city, still disguised as a eunuch with the assumed name of Brhannad? (88). Be it as it may, we hold that the two tales show an analogous structure: in both cases, after a period of preparation and trial (the festive period prior to the Dasar?; the exile in the forest and the year spent at Virata's court), vener? ation of the tree {p?j?; pradaksin?), is followed by victory resulting in the re? covery of what had been lost (the kingdom; the cattle). The two tales seem, therefore, to have the same implications and to lend themselves to parallel ap? plications. Considering both the apocryphal tale and the authentic episode in the Mah?bh?rata, the origin of the Dasar? seems to be connected with a victory in battle (S9); moreover, the importance attached to the samt tree and the veneration accorded it in the two tales offer an explanation of its involvement and par? ticular significance in the celebration of the feast (see section 6). The victory leitmotiv, as we have seen (see section 3), also appears in a legendary tale, not documented in the R?m?yana but preserved by tradition, considered by many to be at the basis of the Vijay?dasami feast. Durg? ap? pears to have come to the assistance of R?ma in his struggle with R?vana when the regenerative power of the monster's ten heads posed serious problems for the hero. Thus R?vana appears to have been killed on the day of Durg?stamL This tale, too, contains evidence of the worship of the tree on the day of Dasar? (performed by R?ma) (*?). (84) M.M.

The fertility rites We shall not dwell here (91) on all the rites marking the various phases of the festive period day by day with liturgical meticulousness. Suffice it to say that the set of complex rites, gentle or gory as they may be; the general atmos? phere of cheerful bustle enlivening the towns during the period (notably Calcutta and Kathmandu); the feelings pervading the frank, curious, hospitable and very human inhabitants; all this, and more besides, appeals to observers coming from a different world and moves them. The sense of wonder takes one back to impressions of the great religious celebrations of one's own culture in the distant past, filtered through the vague reminiscences of the old or the evidence of literary sources and artistic documentation. All this stirs an indescribable sense of nostalgia, deep respect and great love. Here I shall limit myself to a few brief references to some of the fertility rites most clearly and directly relating to the Devtm?h?tmya myth examined in section 4. First of all come the ceremonies relating to the Goddess' generative powers and fecondating nature (9~). These include an invocation to the Goddess to dwell during the period of celebrations not only in the image dedicated to her (y3) but also in a jar filled with water and plants (gbata, kalasa) (P4), which is a symbol of her fecundity and the actual personification of her divine essence (05). The jar is made of clay (9B), with earth (or cow-dung) spread on the part most (91) However, we intend to take up the subject again in a volume on the Hindu religious feasts, which will be published by the Centra Piemontese di Studi sul Me? dio ed Estremo Oriente (CESMEO) of Turin.

Anderson, The Festivals of Nepal, London 1977, pp. 144, 146-47; cf. S.M. Natesa Sastri, op. cit., p. 86. (95) The traditional shape of the large earthen water jar used in Bengal, bulging in the middle and with a very narrow neck (Pratapachandra Ghosha, op. cit., p. 22, Appen? dix, p. xxv, note 15), may suggest a female figure. In this case one might suppose that the ring fashioned at the base of the jar was meant not only to keep it steady {ibid., p. 22), but also to complete the female form with an allusion to the sexual organ. A piece of new cloth dyed yellow with turmeric was tied round the neck of the ghata; then the figure of a divinity with two arms and two legs (ibid., p. 22) was depicted on the central part with a paste made of vermilion (perhaps kuhkum) and ghi. For the identification of the clay pot in the shape of a woman with the Mother Goddess and the role of the potter's wife in the work of manufacture, see P. Jayakar, op. cit., p. 17; note figs. 20 and 21. (m) Pratapachandra Ghosha, op. cit., p. 22; W. Crooke, op. cit., p. 36; M.M. Anderson, op. cit., p. 144. [17] 121</page><page sequence="18">in sight. Here barley grains are carefully sown and, thanks to regular watering, soon begin to sprout (91): thus the Goddess' promise to turn into S?kambharl, as we have seen in the myth, acquires a sense of vital, natural reality. On other oc? casions, as we saw at the Ramakrishna Mission in Calcutta, a pot of water is placed at the feet of the effigy of Durg? (98) so that her face is reflected in it, and it is in this physical form, mirrored in the water, that the benevolent, smiling image of the Goddess appears to the faithful. Then there is the sowing of barley in what we may describe, through analogy with the 'gardens of Adonis' mentioned by Frazer ("), as the 'gardens of Durg?': small pots of sprouting barley, also used in other Hindu feasts including the Gangaur in Rajasthan (10?), used to perform a fertility rite of fundamental importance for the community (101) in the critical period of transition marked by the Durg?p?j? (see section 2). At the end of the festivities these ' gardens' are left to dissolve into the water (10~), thus con? firming the element of homoepathic magic typifying the whole rite (103). While on the subject of the powers assumed by the Goddess in the myth as bearer of vegetables, mention must also be made of the Bengalese rite connec (97) In 1980 we observed this rite in the Kathmandu residence of major Kaisher Bahadur, whom we wish to thank for the hospitality and precious help offered us during our Nepal mission on the occasion of this celebration. For this rite see also M.M. Anderson, op. cit., p. 146. (9?) Cf. Pratapachandra Ghosha, op. cit., p. 39. (") J.G. Frazer, The Golden Bough.

Crooke, Religion and Folklore of Northern India, new edition edited by R.E. Enthoven, Oxford 1926 (repr. New Delhi n.d., p. 258). In our study dedicated to this Rajasthani feast, we called the clods of sown earth the 'gardens of Gangaur' (F. Scialpi, op. cit., pp. 484-88), The names change, but the facts symbolically represented remain: in both cases, the Goddess (Gauri, Durg?) is identified (see fn. 80) or at least closely associated with the crop. On closer examination, however, the 'gardens of Adonis' reveal a different significance from that noted by us. It has in fact been pointed out that the Greek hero, unlike the Indian Goddess, was not characterized by a close relationship with cereals (G. Piccaluga, Minutal. Saggi di storia delle religioni, Roma 1974, pp. 93-94). (101) Pratapachandra Ghosha, op. cit., pp. 14, 22-23; L.C.G. Grieve, op. cit., p. 73; W.

The same practice is also commonly observed for other ritual objects associated with the Goddess' cult ? pratim?, ghata, navapattrik? (see below), which are 'consigned to the river' after the completion of the pup. See Pratapachandra Ghosha, op. cit., pp. 79-82, Appendix, p. i, note 1; G. Tucoi, Asia religiosa, cit., p. 80; Id., 'Induismo', cit., p. 607. At Kathmandu, however, the 'gardens' are simply thrown away; the day after the celebration the streets are full of them. (103) W. Crooke, The Dasahra, etc.', cit., p. 47. 122 [18]</page><page sequence="19">ted with the navapattrik? (104), the leaves of nine edible plants (105) which are covered with a sari (306) and placed to the right of Ganesa (107)&gt; not far from the image of the Goddess. This is yet another plant manifestation of Durg? (108)? this time wrapped in the earthly vestments prepared for her during the festive period. The crudest and most spectacular rite, the sacrifice of a buffalo, also aims at procuring fertility. This is only represented in the images of the Goddess in Calcutta, showing her as Mahis?suramardim at the moment of her ruthless triumph over the demoniac buffalo (109), while it is almost unknown in cel? ebrations in the south of India (no). In Nepal, on the other hand, particularly in Kathmandu, the sacrifice is very widely performed, leading parts being played by the king and the military (U1) (as well as the poor buffaloes, of course). A vividly horrifying description of these sacrifices in Kathmandu, on the ninth day of celebrations, can be found in a work by H.A. Oldfield written in 1880 (i12). Further evidence can be found in the Giornale by Father Cassiano da Macerata, a Capuchin missionary in Nepal, who described the rite performed by the sov? ereign before the statue of the Goddess, in her manifestation as Bhav?nl (113), (104) Pratapachandra Ghosha, op. cit., pp. 66-69; Imperial Record Department, op. cit., p. 23 (the nine plants are listed in fn. 2 on p. 23); G.

(108) Pratapachandra Ghosha, op. cit., pp. 66, 68; G. Tucci, Tra giungle e pagode, cit., p. 45. Another example of analogous plant manifestation can be found in Nepal, in the case of Phulp?ti ('Flowers and leaves'), the sacred royal vessel filled with a bunch of tall stemmed flowers, banana stalks, sacred leaves and sugar cane, wrapped in a red cloth which, on the seventh day of the feast, is ceremonially carried from the historical Royal Residence in Gorkha where the present ruling dynasty originated to the old Royal Palace of Hanuman Dhoka in Kathmandu. According to devotees the Goddess Taleju, the divinity originally pro? tecting the royal family, is manifested in the kalasa of flowers and leaves. See M.M. Anderson, op. cit., pp. 146-48; cf. H. Whitehead, The Village Gods of South India, Calcutta 19212 (repr. Delhi 1976, pp. 37-38). (109) pratapachandra Ghosha, op. cit., pp. 5-6. (n0) M. Biardeau, 'Mythe epique, etc.', cit., pp. 46-47. (1U) According to various Pur?nic texts, the rituals to be observed on the ninth day of the festive period were particularly associated with the figure of the king (V.B. Mishra, Religious Beliefs and Practices of North India during the Early Mediaeval Period, Leiden K?ln 1973, pp. 53-54). (U2) H.A. Oldfield, Sketches from Nipal, Historical and Descriptive, London 1880 (repr. Delhi 1974, vol. II, pp. 344-50). (113) Giornale di Era Cassiano da Macerata, in L.

The rite had magical elements; as we have seen (see section 3), the Goddess found blood gratifying and, in this case, it was not only shed but made to spurt as high as possible from the victims'necks. We interpret this to indicate the desired height to be reached by the crops (114). To conclude with, there is yet another rite, of both private and public nature, that we consider significant. In this ceremony the head of the family spreads the tilaka of turmeric powder mixed with grains of rice on the forehead of the members of his family (llc&gt;), and the king performs an analogous rite with his highest-ranking dignitaries and functionaries (11G). The latter case represents additional clear evidence of the idea that prosperity is linked to the figure of the sovereign, and is guaranteed through being dispensed from his hands (see section 6). At the same time, the king's gesture probably represents his acknowledg? ments to his closest assistants in the task of government and confirmation of the rank they 'have been granted (U7). 6. The feast of Dasar? in the city of Mysore Having ranged far and wide over Bengal and Nepal in search of the motifs of this celebration, we finally come to Mysore, in the southern state of Kama (m) Fr Cassiano adds other interesting details. The blood spurting from the victims was aimed by the sacrificers at the faces of two naked men at either side of the statue of the Goddess. For the entire duration of the ceremony, these men had to remain stand? ing, without being allowed to move or touch food except for a little milk that others might feed them with {ibid., pp. 53-54). It seems possible that the two men who undergo such a severe trial of physical resistance and religious faith (the fast) may represent with their erect posture ears of ripe wheat corroborated by the animals' blood. For a similar identification of crops with human beings (barley impersonated by small girls) during a New Year celebration, see F. Scialpi, op. cit., pp. 477-79. As for the blood that was to spurt as high as possible, Fr Cassiano notes that there was 'no little emulation' among the 'butchers' (ibid., pp. 53-54). It may be useful to compare this Nepalese competition with a typical contest practised by the Bants, a group of land-owners and rice-growers in southern Kanara (today Karnataka). It consisted in running pairs of buffaloes separately, each usually led by a driver, on specially prepared rice beds full of water and mud, so that the animals splashed as much water and mud as they could and as high as possible. The race clearly had ritual, propitiatory significance (E. Thurston, op. cit., pp. 157-60). Such competitions and contests, as well as games of chance and skill, are often used to predict the future. At the feast of the New Year, the Onondaga, a tribe of American Indians, played with peach-stones tossed up from a bowl or dish struck on the floor. Harvest predictions were based on the results of the game which was played between men and women. If the men won, the ears of corn would be long like them, and short if the women won (E. Sidney Hartland, 'Games', Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics, vol. VI, Edinburgh 1913, p. 170). (115) L. Petech, op. cit., p. 54. (116) H.A. Oldfield, op. cit., p. 351. Even the common people who go to the Royal Palace still receive the tilaka on this occasion. (m) Ibid., p. 351. 124 [20]</page><page sequence="21">taka. On the strength of our previous findings, it will suffice now to pick out the analogies and, should they occur, differences that can help us to understand better, by comparison, the various similar facts taken from the various celebrations. On the whole, the celebration at Mysore follows the same pattern, with the same mythical background and the same criteria defining the festive time as elsewhere. However, there is a profound difference between this celebration and the other in terms of what we might hazard to call the gravity and tone of the feast. Throughout its entire history, from Vijayanagar times (1336-1565 A.D.) (118) down to a few decades ago, the Dasar? at Mysore had always been the celebration of the mah?r?ja of Mysore (uw). It represented an occasion, at a crucial time of the year (see section 2), to ex toll the figure of the sovereign and solemnly transport his investiture, ordained by the Goddess (C?mund?) in mythical time (see section 4), into the present. The celebration therefore served to stress and reconfirm the link binding king and Goddess together in a recipro? cal relationship, and guaranteed the community of subjects well-being and har? mony with the supernatural world. The victorious Goddess legitimized the dynasty ruling over Mysore and protected both it and the all those under it the royal family returned the favour, guarding over worship in the temple dedi? cated to her on the hill which is, in fact, named after the Goddess ('C?mundi HilP) (121) and dominates the capital (12~). This solidarity represented the ideo? logical foundation of the feast, the fame of which extended, in days gone by, throughout India and even beyond. Today, however, the mah?r?ja no longer reigns over this glorious, time honoured state. The celebration has therefore lost its original, truly religious meaning. Thus, while the tradition and organization are maintained by the government of the new state belonging to the Indian Union (123), the celebration (na) The first direct evidence of the feast celebrated at Vijayanagar (with the name of 'Mahanavamr) came from the Italian traveller Nicolo de* Conti who visited the kingdom and city in 1420. The feast took on the name Dasar? and was celebrated with great pomp by the Royal Family of Mysore from 1610 onwards. In this year the raja Wadiyar (translit? eration also given as Wodeyar) founded an independent kingdom in Karnataka following on that of Vijayanagar. See: K.A. Nilakanta Sastri, A History of South India from Prehistoric times to the Fall of Vijayanagar, Madras 19764, p. 31; B. Stein, op. cit., pp. 77-78. (119) See H.V. Nanjundayya, L.K.A.

(122) Here we are obviously referring to the mah?r?ja's capital of Mysore (B.B. Goswami, S.G. Morab, op. cit.y p. 1). (m) On the occasion of festivities the Karnataka government also takes charge of the publication of a booklet, Dasara Cultural Festivities, Souvenir. The last booklet to have come out by 1984, the year of our Mysore mission, referred to the 1983 celebration. [21] 125</page><page sequence="22">seems to have lost its vitality and its authentic origins appear doomed to progres? sive oblivion. In comparison with celebrations in Calcutta where, for historical reasons, such political implications have never existed, or with celebrations in Kathmandu where, on the contrary, the monarch still holds sway and, under? standably, takes charge of them, ensuring that they serve ad instrumentum regni, the Mysore Dasar?- retains only a shadowy hint of what it had been like in the old times. It lives on in documents and in the superb vision conveyed by the frescos in the Royal Palace and the Jagan Mohan Palace far more vitally than in the city streets. So far we have considered the feast as a public event involving the whole city of Mysore in years past. Yet it is still celebrated today, with almost all its old splendour, inside what used to be the mah?r?ja's Palace and is now a public monument under the administration of the new state (124). During the days of Dasar?, which are also separated from the everyday time sequence in virtue of this form of celebration, Prince Sri Srikanta Datta Narasimharaja Wadiyar, heir to the last mah?r?ja of Mysore (125), retains the right to celebrate his rites. Admission to take part is granted on a purely private basis to a very limited number of functionaries and collaborators of what used to be the Royal Household and has now become the Prince's private administration. As one mi^ht imagine, the rites typifying the Mysore Dasar? focus mainly on the figure of the mah?r?ja, in virtue of the historical role he had until recently played. There are also, of course, rites of a private nature but, with the exception of rites for work-tools (12e) and, in particular, vehicles (from humble bicycles to (m) Cf. N. Narasimha Rau, 'Mysore Palace and Me', in Government of Karnataka, Dasara Cultural Festivities 1983, Souvenir, p. 106. (125) The last mah?r?ja of Mysore was His Royal Highness Sri Jayachamaraja Wadiyar. After the accession of the state of Mysore to independent India, he continued to govern the country until the Indian Constitution came into force in 1950. Subsequently, he became r?japramukh of the new state. See P.B. Desai, ed., A History of Karnataka (From Pre? history to Unification), Dharwad 19812, p. 448. His heir is Prince Sri Srikantadatta Na rasimharaja Wadiyar. To the Prince who granted us the privilege of attending the rites held in the Palace during the 1984 Dasar?, we wish to express our sincere gratitude for his kindness and understanding in having made it possible for us to complete section 6 of this study. Sincere thanks are also due to the Prince's collaborators and functionaries, in particular Sri M.R. Murthy, Manager of the Palace Office, and Sri S. Narayana Rao, Personal Assistant to the Prince, whose generous help greatly facilitated our research. Special thanks must also go to Sri C.C. Shah, Legal Adviser to the Prince, for his helpful advice during our research. O Cf. S.M. Natesa Sastri, op. cit., p. 88; W. Crooke, The Dasahra, etc.', cit., p. 54; M.M.

Moreover, even in the domestic p?j? peculiar to Dasar?, still held in a very small proportion of private dwellings, the figures of the sovereign and his consort are placed at the centre of the small altar, practically putting the remaining statuettes of the vast Hindu pantheon (128), if not the kalasa representing the Goddess herself, in the shade. The many rites performed by the mah?r?ja ? previously public and ap? plying to the entire community he ruled over (see section 5) and now, as we have seen, strictly limited to his private circle, though still celebrated with the old magnificence ? can be grouped in four categories. There are the preliminary rites, during which the golden lion ? symbol of royalty (129) and the Goddess' mount (see section 3) ? is attached to the throne once again (13?), to renew the sacredness of the latter, after it was taken down the previous year and kept in a safe place. It is to be noted, in fact, that the conclusion of the feast is marked by the Prince detaching the lion from his throne. This first rite is followed on the same day, the first, by the adoration (m) Cf. G. Slater, op. cit., pp. 90-91; P.K. Nambiar, K.C. Narayana Kurup, op. cit., p. 16; M.M. Anderson, op. cit., p. 151. (128) These small altars are set up with meticulous care and are often quite complex. Basic features are the royal couple and the kalasa, surrounded by the main divinities of the Hindu pantheon. Alongside these, however, room is given to many other figurines and objects (animals, little dolls, ornaments, toy cars; in one case, there was even a replica of the characteristic figure in national costume that is the symbol of Air India). Evidence dating back to the beginning of the century shows that it was the tradition to display a great many toys for the festivity in every Hindu household (S.M. Natesa Sastri, op. cit., pp. 84-86; P.K. Nambiar, K.C. Narayana Kurup, op. cit., pp. 16-17 and illustration facing p. 16). The small altars in the houses we visited seemed to be maintaining this custom. Perhaps what seemed to the above-quoted author to be mere toys were in fact miniature replicas of important goods which the families, through the rite, wanted to be sure of getting or at least having the use of. Otherwise, one might suppose (as in the case of the miniature cars) that they were expressions of the cult of work tools previously mentioned. Beside the small altar, or sometimes inside it, some families showed a 'garden of Durga*; this, too, has become little more than a game for the devotees, having no connection with productive activities or the essential problems of survival. We wish here to express our gratitude to Dr J.S. Paramashivaiah, Professor of Folklore at the University of Mysore, and Sri Chaduranga for their valuable assistance in guiding us to the houses where the small altars were set up. Our gratitude is also due to the families whose homes we were permitted to visit. Special thanks must go to the following ladies and gentlemen: Kama lamma Nagaraja Rao; Alamela Srinivasan; M.S.

[23] 127</page><page sequence="24">of the nine planets (navagraha) (131) as well as a great many kalasas inside which the Goddess' presence has been invoked and the golden throne. Indian tradition holds that the throne is the womb and navel of royalty, the actual cosmic birth-place of the king (13L&gt;) and, therefore, supreme symbol of his temporal power. In the case of the mah?r?ja of Mysore, this power had been exercised since ancient times and handed down, by divine right, from the ancestors of the dynasty. The p?j? to the throne is then repeated, with liturgical regularity, every evening during the festive period. This occasion is also marked by the gathering of the darbar; dignitaries and functionaries of the old court pay hom? age and bear gifts to their lord (even today they present him with coins as a token of the precious gifts of former times) (133). Taken as a whole, these rites and, in particular, the adoration of the throne and the navagraha, appear to exalt the king's temporal role and cosmic function, in accordance with the God? dess' promise in the Devim?h?tmya (see section 4) and, in our opinion, as a conscious continuation of the sacred tradition of the cakravartin (134). The second category of rites concerns the cult of arms (?yudhap?j?); this worship is performed on the day of Mah?navamI and, understandably, is very important in ksatriya circles (l35) and among the military even today (13*).

Both ideas appear to be present in the rites referred to, which include adoration of the throne (symbol of sovereignty over the kingdom) and the nine planets (the first of which is the sun). (135) J.

We ourselves saw signs of 128 [24]</page><page sequence="25">The p?j? to the arms in the personal property of the Prince and belonging to the old state (137) is followed by the p?j? offered up to the other symbols of royal power which include the state horse, elephant and cow, the golden palanquin and silver chariot, the carriage and even the dolt, the flags and the favourite top-quality motor-cars (138). Significantly, the horse and the elephant, two of the four members (caturanga) which used to provide solid support for the mah?r?ja*$ power, receive a p?j? every evening during the festive period. On the next day of Vijay?dasamI the Prince, attended by his retinue, carries his own sword (as also do the principal dignitaries) to the temple dedicated to the Goddess (13e) under the name of Bhuvanesvari which stands outside the Palace but within its precincts. It is significant that the arms are solemnly carried to the sacred place of the Lady of the universe; again, it is extremely significant that a samt tree rises within the temple precincts. This is no mere chance, and we can conclude that the swords are consciously associated with the samt; in a similar way, in the Mah?bh?rata, the arms were intentionally hidden among the branches of the same tree by the five P?ndavas (see section 4). According to Vedic tradition, the samt is the matrix of fire. For this reason, the ritual fire is kindled through friction between two pieces of wood from the samt and the asvattha, the piece of asvattha being held vertically so that its point enters a hole made for this purpose in the worship of a rifle in the house of one of our dear friends and precious sources of infor? mation, Sri K.P. Dathatraya Swamy, Sub-Inspector of Excise in the city of Mysore. He also assured us that particular celebrations, above all dedicated to vehicles, took place in the yard of the building he worked in (Excise Intelligence Bureau). We wish here to offer our sincere thanks to our friend, his wife and family, who showed us extraordinary and truly moving friendliness and hospitality. At the same time, we must also express our appreciation to his direct and indirect superiors for the help they offered us in our work and for having arranged for him to accompany us during our stay in Mysore. In par? ticular we thank Sri J. Alexander, I.A.S., Excise Commissioner (ex officio Secretary), Ban? galore; also: Sri L.A. Suryanarayana, Deputy Commissioner of Excise, Bangalore; Sri D.S. Nagendrappa, Deputy Commissioner of Excise, Mysore; Sri Ramachandra Padaki, Super Intendent of Excise, Mysore. Our gratitude is also due to Sri A. Muniswamy Gowda, I.A.S. (Retd.), Bangalore, and his family for the generous help they gave us in their city. Last but not least, we must also express our debt of gratitude to Sri Ammedeus Michael, an old friend and functionary at the Italian Embassy in India, who gave indispensable help to our mission. (137) Generally all weapons, even the most modern and least traditional like, for example, rifles, are honoured. However, particular importance is attached to swords (cf. J. Tod, op. cit., pp. 464-67; W. Crooke, 'The Dasahra, etc.', cit., pp. 29, 47, 54; H.V. Nanjundayya, L.K.A. Iyer, op. cit,, pp. 60-61; J. Gonda, Ancient Indian Kingship, etc., cit., p. 37). (13e) M. Biardeau, 'Mythe epique, etc/, cit., p. 49; cf. J. Gonda, Ancient Indian Kingship, etc., cit., pp. 37-38, 44. See H.V. Nanjundayya, L.K.A. Iyer, op. cit., illustrations facing pp. 62, 63, 64.

This ritual association of arms and the samt (U1) may well, as Biardeau suggests (14~), serve to transmit the sacred fire into the arms once again. This is not only because the arms are abandoned during the monsoon period, as the distinguished French scholar suggests (M3), but above all because the feast marks a beginning which transcends the natural cycle of seasons (see section 2). At the beginning of the new year, with the prospect of 'new birth' for the human community and institutions, the cosmogonic myth is repeated and the world regenerated (114); similarly, the arms must be regener? ated or, in other words, endued with new power and consecrated to guarantee new victories. This explains the tradition according to which the day of Dasar? coincided with the beginning of the sovereign's military campaigns (14S). The New Year war is likely to have had particular ritual significance, as indeed had many other wars and contests in the ancient world (146). The rites of the third category are also performed in the same temple: the Prince distributes the leaves of the sami tree among his dignitaries and function (L4?) M. Biardeau, 'Mythe epique, etc.', cit., p. 45. Note that Vedic tradition is preserved in today's Tamil language and culture {ibid., pp. 45-46). (141) Ethnographical data appear to confirm the association of weapons with the samt tree. According to some witnesses, military professionals and soldiers used to shoot arrows at this tree on the tenth day of celebrations, and set the leaves that fell from it in their turbans (J. Malcolm, Transactions of the Bombay Literary Society, quoted by Ch. Coleman, op. cit., p. 87; W. Crooke, 'The Dasahra, etc.', cit., p. 36). Among the Mar?thas, on the same day the Peshw? (prime minister and first military authority) plucked some leaves of this tree, and the action was hailed with artillery and musketry shots (Ch. Coleman, op. cit., p. 88). It seems likely that this custom, which was originally restricted to the military, spread in time throughout the population until it became general practice (see below). (142) M. Biardeau, 'Mythe epique, etc.', cit., pp. 45-46, 48. (14S) Ibid., p. 47. (144) Cf. M. Eliade, II mito delVeterno ritorno, etc., cit., pp. 74-79; Id., Patterns in Comparative Religion, cit., pp. 400-1. (145) J. Tod, op. cit., p. 467; W.H. Sleeman, op. cit., pp. 241, fn. 2, 293; L.C.G.

Gonda, Les religions de ITnde, II, cit., p. 329; M. Biardeau, 'Mythe epique, etc.', cit., p. 47. The history of the kingdom of Vijayanagar is highly illuminating concerning this practice. We know that, on the eve of the decisive battle with the Muslim army, the true king of Vijayanagar, R?ma R?ya, chose the day of Vijayadasami (September 15th, 1564) to inform the nobles that war was imminent and to order them to gather all avail? able forces without delay (K.A, Nilakanta Sastri, op. cit., p. 293). This, however, did not prevent the Hindu army from being routed at Talikota. Apparently, not only military cam? paigns led by kings and princes, but even expeditions for plunder were launched with the celebration of Dasar? (W.H. Sleeman, op. cit., p. 296; M.M. Underhill, op. cit., p. 57). The latter were probably considered by those carrying them out as imitations of the former, the original religious significance of which was no longer felt. (146) A. Brelich, Guerre, agoni e culti nella Grecia arcaica, Bonn 1961. 130 [26]</page><page sequence="27">aries, in accordance with the very popular custom observed by all to procure at least a few leaves of the tree on this day (14Z). These leaves are, in fact, valued like gold (148), which is hardly surprising as the tree contains the sacred fire which is the very essence of gold; thus gold is a sort of condensation of the sacred fire (149). Thus the king guaranteed prosperity for his subjects with the consent of the Goddess; he was the original source of their fortunes, which were closely linked to his sacred figure (150). Finally, the fourth group of rites was performed, on the same day of Vi jay?dasaml, in the context of a long, majestic procession of the mah?r?ja together with the parade of his dignitaries and selected troops in full uniform from the Royal Palace along the city streets to the place, which at least in the old times was beyond the city limits (15~), where the sacred samt tree stood (153), and here the mah?r?ja offered the p?j? (I54). However, as we have already pointed out, the Prince's Dasar? is nowadays confined within the Palace precincts, and so, unlike his step-father, the last mah?r?ja appointed as Governor of the new state in independent India, he no longer takes part in it. Despite the efforts made by the government body responsible for the or (m) W. Crooke, 'The Dasahra, etc/, cit., pp. 36, 52, 55; M.M. Underhill, op. cit., p. 56; R.E. Enthoven, op. cit., pp. 55, 122.

The name corresponds to that of the same tree in Tamil (vanni-maram) and derives from the Sanskrit vahni ('fire'), confirming the above stated igneous nature of the samt in Vedic tradition (M. Biardeau, 'Mythe epique, etc.', cit., p. 50). (154) Cf. J. Malcolm, quoted by Ch. Coleman, op. cit., p. 88; W.H. Sleeman, op. cit., p. 174, fn. 2; L.C.G. Grieve, op. cit., p. 15; W. Crooke, 'The Dasahra, etc.', cit., p. 55. We observed clear signs of a pup, which is still performed to the samt tree by the major authorities of the Karnataka government on the occasion of the festivities (see below), at 'Banni mantap' on the evening of the day of Vijay?dasami.

[27] 131</page><page sequence="28">ganization (155) and the direct participation of the major authorities (156), the new procession has not managed to retain the same meaning (or perhaps even fasci? nation) as the old one. It still proceeds along the streets of Mysore bearing the effigy of the Goddess on an elephant towards the same destination as in years gone by, and yet its original savour, having gradually faded during the last few decades, now seems finally lost (15T). We can only hark back, nostalgically, to the old procession when something like a ritual display was made of all the sovereign's wealth, power and magnificence (158) for the joy and wonder of the subjects who identified with their lord. Such a procession recalls the one of the r?n? in the city of Udaipur, so unforgettably described by James Tod C?), Both processions now live on in the impressive eloquence of the frescos in the Palaces of Udaipur and Mysore. 7. Conclusion Some concluding remarks remain to be made. We have considered the complexity of the Durg?p?j?, or Dasar?, celebrations and their fundamental im? portance in the Hindu calendar, inasmuch as they coincide with the autumn equinox and mark the beginning of a new seasonal, economic and yearly cycle. (155) Organization of the procession is in the charge of the Directorate of Archaeology and Museums in Karnataka. This important task had been entrusted to Dr A. Sundara at the time of our mission. He gave us great help for our work in Mysore and we wish to thank him here for his friendliness and competence. Our gratitude is also due to Dr M.S. Nagaraja Rao, Dr Sundara's predecessor at Mysore and subsequently Director General of the Archaeological Survey of India, whose assistance and help in informing the Karnataka authorities of our research proved indispensable. Finally, we owe thanks for their support given to this research to Sri A.S. Melkote, Secretary to Government of Karnataka, Ministry of Information, Tourism, Youth Services and Archaeology (Bangalore), and to Sri Vinay Kumar, I.A.S., Deputy Commissioner, Mysore District. (156) The 1984 procession began with the p?j? performed by the Chief Minister of Karnataka, Sri Ramakrishna Hegde, to the effigy of the Goddess placed in the royal howdah on the back of an elephant [The Times, Bangalore, October 3rd 1984, p. 3; ibid., October 5th 1984, p. 3; Deccan Herald, Bangalore, October 6th 1984, p. 1). (15T) The procession we observed had more of a socio-political than religious flavour, despite the role played by the effigy of the Goddess. It included twenty 'tableaux vivants' arranged by each district, showing the state's development activities and historical events; it also included fifteen folklore groups, nineteen military bands coming from the various districts and a number of decorated elephants {The Times, October 3rd and 5th 1984, cit.). The parade also included the mab?r?ja's golden palanquin drawn by a pair of oxen and accompanied by the guard of the Prince's Palace. (158) Cf. J. Gonda, Ancient Indian Kingship, etc., cit., pp. 13-15, 37-38. (159) J. Tod, op. cit., pp. 455-56. 132 [28]</page><page sequence="29">The feast answers to the basic needs of the community celebrating it, and even extends to the satisfaction of the ever-arising new needs which the creative imagination implicit in this culture contrives to incorporate into its traditional nucleus. Originally, or at any rate in a very early phase, the celebration may have simply served to distinguish and separate a fixed number of days at the beginning of the new year (the sacred time of the feast) from the remaining period of the year (the ordinary time of everyday life) (I6?) following on the celebration. The primordial conception of the universe, such as is found in archaic cultures, views all existence not as the property of humans but of superhuman beings who constantly require propitiation if man is to be allowed to enjoy with impunity all that he appropriates from his natural surroundings to safeguard his survival (161). Thus the concentration of sacred time at the beginning of the year represented an original and effective means of reconciling the indispensable human activity modifying the natural environment with the tribute due to the masters of nature itself. In fact, the festive period, like the offering of the first fruits of the crops to be consumed by the group (162), was consecrated to them, while, on the other hand, the profane time belonging to the rest of the year was salvaged for practical activities which could then be freely performed thanks to this preventive deconsecration (163). Moreover, as the feast represented a deliberate return to the mythical origins when everything had yet to be decided and realized (164), it offered the opportunity to predict, by means of the appropriate magical rites, what the new year held in store (165). For example, the Nepalese buffalo sacrifice, with the blood of the victims spurting high in the air (see section 5), might well have had the purpose to magically prefigure the height the crops would reach and thus the abundance of the harvest. Subsequently, as agriculture gradually established a position of its own among the economic activities of the human group, the celebration itself could take on the nature of a more specifically agrarian festivity, connected with the harvest (see section 2) and the first consumption of crops; an example of this can still be found among the Gonds of Andhra Pradesh. It was intended to exalt the 'generative power that bursts from the tangles of the forests to nourish human (16?) A. Brelich, Introduzione, etc., cit., pp. 50-52; Id., Trolegomeni, etc/, cit., p. 30. (1S1) A. Brelich, Introduzione, etc., cit., pp. 45-46; Id., Trolegomeni, etc.', cit., pp. 29-30. (162) A. Brelich, Introduzione, etc., cit., pp. 45-46; Id., Trolegomeni, etc.', cit., pp. 29-30. (163) A. Brelich, Trolegomeni, etc.', cit., p. 30. (164) See the opinion expressed by Mircea Eliade: {In illo tempore, in the mythical period, anything was possible. The species were not yet fixed and all forms were "fluid"'. (Patterns in Comparative Religion, cit., p. 395). f165) M. Eliade, II mito delVeterno ritomo, cit., pp. 79, 81-82, 90-91. [29] 133</page><page sequence="30">life with the gift of the crops' (166). This generative power, manifested in veg? etation, was traced back to the earth. Thus arose the cult of plants as represen? tation and expression of the vital forces, as in the Bengalese and Nepalese cer? emonies of the nine leaves, and the procession of Thulp?ti' from Gorkha to Kathmandu (see section 5). Moreover, fertility rites, like miniature-scale sowing (see section 5), were performed; and they, in the original, mythical time the celebration aimed at transporting into the present, were probably meant to restore the generative power of the earth that had been exhausted or at any rate reduced by recent harvesting. However, the same generative power also functioned at the human level, and could, therefore, be better besought through anthropomorphic representa? tions (167). It was thus primarily conceived of as a mother and, as time went by, became the Great Mother worshipped throughout India and characterized by a double nature, both 'endless source of life and inexorable power that kills' (168). Still later, this mother who had originally had no husband acquired new features deriving from non-Aryan cultures (161&gt;); in recognition of the increasing 'Br?hmanization' of pre-existing ethnological and literary cultures, she was fully incorporated within the Hindu pantheon (17?); she acquired the features of a goddess, and a complex mythological web was woven around her. Thus was born 'Durg?, the most popular goddess in India' who, in the course of a long and not always clear historical process, 'absorbed within herself a host of other divinities worshipped in every village from the age of Mohenjodaro to the present day as symbols of fertility and cosmic vitality' (171). Thus the festivity was unequivocally associated with the new divinity and, while retaining marked vestiges of the various phases it had passed through, it became the celebration of the Mother Goddess or, in other words, the Durg? p?j?. The sacred tales of Durg? provided a new mythical sub-stratum for the ancient New Year celebration and accounted for the rites associated with it. They also served to renew the social institutions and economic activities of the group, and consolidate the specific function of the feast as a cultural creation aiming at the restoration of the mythical time of origins through the symbolic return to initial chaos followed by the ritual rebirth of the cosmos. The old rites acquired new significance as performance of them was now associated with (166) G. Tucci, Tra giungle e pagode, cit.y p. 44. (167) A. Brelich, Introduzione, etc., cit., p. 29. (168) G. Tucci, Forme dello spirito asiatico, cit., p. 143. (169) Ibid., pp. 145-46; S. Bhattacharji, op. cit., pp. 172-74, 176. (17?) W. Crooke, 'The Dasahra, etc.', cit., pp. 39, 58-59; H. Whitehead, op. cit., pp. 16, 18, 31, 91-92, 107-8, 123-24. (m) G. Tucci, Forme dello spirito asiatico, cit., p. 145. 134 [30]</page><page sequence="31">the Goddess. Such was the case, for example, of the Nepalese buffalo sacrifices, which were now performed before the statue of Bhav?ni, and the ritual sowing of the 'gardens of Durg?' which now took place in the presence of an effigy of the Goddess, or even on the kalasa containing her presence (see section 5). Celebration of Durg? on the occasion of the feast also served to stress the sacred nature of the main economic activity carried out by the group (agriculture), as well as providing a religious basis for the power wielded by the king. In fact, in the Devim?h?tmya the Goddess had promised to feed the world with the plants that were to sprout from her body during a period of heavy rainfall (see section 4). This lent authority to the old intuition that the generative power of the earth had the face of a mother, that of the Goddess herself. Thus agriculture became a means to obtain from the Goddess, 'bearer of vegetables' (S?kambhari), what she had promised, and a human activity modifying the natural environment became a sacred function desired by the Mother Goddess who was identified with the earth, practically acquiring the force and significance of an act of worship. We also find in the Devim?h?tmya that the Goddess invested the king with temporal power during his present life and dominion over the universe in future times (see section 4) in return for the cult he had founded in honour of her. Thus, in societies ruled by a monarchy like Nepal and, until very recently, Mysore, the feast served for the ritual renewal of the religious legitimization of the king's authority at the beginning of each new year. Moreover, the link be? tween the Goddess and the figure of the king insured the community he ruled over against the risks of everyday life. Security and prosperity were guaranteed under the rule of the king and with the blessing of the Goddess. The subjects identified with the sovereign, and his absolute power found new support in the common consent. Finally, the Pur?nic tale of the Goddess' exploits afforded the feast a solid mythological basis, reinforcing its ancient nature and significance. Durg? (or the manifestations of her) had concluded a titanic struggle with the defeat of serried ranks of demoniac beings and had returned to the gods the dominion over the world that these beings had usurped from them. Thus the celebration of the Goddess assumed the significance of the exaltation of the luminous power of good over the dark sway of evil. Once the right order had been restored, the cosmos once again emerged from chaos: primordial time had again been touched and, regenerated through this contact, life had begun its course from the beginning once again (m). All this, and yet more besides, is expressed in the feast of Dasar?, that extraordinary microcosm revealing not only the limitations, but also the orig (172) Cf. M. Ellade, II mito delVeterno ritorno, cit., pp. 74-85; Id., Patterns in Com? parative Religion, cit.y pp. 400-1. [31] 135</page><page sequence="32">inality, wealth and, at times, genius underlying the archaic conception of time, the world and life that can be found in Hindu culture. Modern civilization, with its new dimensions of time (173) and myth of science (m) has proudly abandoned such conceptions, but at the same time it has been drawing ever further from Nature and measure of man himself. It might be worth recalling, as James G. Frazer wrote, that 'we stand upon the foundation reared by the generations that have gone before, and we can but dimly realise the painful and prolonged efforts which it has cost humanity to struggle up to the point, no very exalted one after all, which we have reached' (175).
