<plain_text><page sequence="1">Art Criticism as Autoportraiture Serge Gavronsky WHERE SHALL WE BEGIN with Francis Ponge? Shall it be when he first looked at himself? That might be an appropriate moment but better still when he first began reading himself, when he first started to translate self into text, one body into another. As of that materialization of the text, Ponge begins a long, steady if refracted confir mation of his image not only in his writings but also in his numerous essays on French painters and sculptors. In the following paragraphs, I propose to read Francis Ponge in his art criticism, especially his last publication: L'Atelier contemporain,' which groups all of his previously scattered pieces on contemporaries and near contemporaries. My point will be limited to the proposition that for Fran cis Ponge art criticism is not only an aesthetic appreciation of the Other but a self-revealing textual production wherein the poet graphs some of his own most discernible features—therefore, art criticism as a genre of autoportraiture, but a portrait highlighting poetics and character more than physiognomic distinctions. The first point of communality between art and poetry is the meta phorical bridging of the relationship between prose, painting and sculp ture; a shared poetics transcending distinctive semiotic fields. This is particularly evident in his numerous comments on Braque where the point in common is matter itself (AC 307-308). As language assures the poet with the possibility of one day formulating a new rhetoric, figures as close to a non-Euclidean universe as possible, so for the artist, in his own space, a similar operation exists. Differences are equally pertinent. Words and paint are not only signs. They are beings or things and, as a consequence, they cannot be manipulated in the same fashion (AC 309 310). Nevertheless, the existence of a particularity does not prohibit the poet from signing his painterly studies, thereby indicating the successful 1.

This would then be the initial connec tion: etymologically speaking, the metaphor assures the translation from one medium to another, without overlooking the fact that both are depen dent upon sight itself. The figure would resemble a triangle with painting and prose at the base and sight as the determining angle at the top (much like a Masonic eye). This insistence on language's gravity, making it something equivalent to nature's own minerals and vegetal pigments (AC 321, 349) carries over into Ponge's formal though laconically stated poetics: PARTI PRIS DES CHOSES égale COMPTE TENU DES MOTS.2 Or rather freely translat ed, a measure of things is equivalent to a measure of words. These "things" that belong to the extra-linguistic world are apprehended by words which are equally, at the outset, free of any anthropomorphism. Man has yet to taint his language when he begins to write. Francis Ponge's attention to simple objects is therefore quite removed from the opinions expressed by the sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi who metamorpho sizes them into "something wonderful and extraordinary. . .

And in another revealing ob servation, commenting this time on Giacometti, the poet notes about that sculptor his "Supreme elegance. Reduced to a thread, he appears out of the shadow, comes and goes in the decayed world of the absurd" (AC 155). And yet this text which dates the piece to Ponge's own hesitation with the question of the Absurd is quickly displaced by a more pertinent emphasis in his views on Braque. According to the painter of the School of Paris, ideas are "the launching pads of the painting. That is, the scaffolding from which the boat frees itself in order to slide down into the sea. . . The painting is finished," writes Braque, "when it has dismissed the idea, when the inevitable has occurred" (AC 74). What predetermines both types of texts, the painterly one and the verbal, is a joined understanding of the reality of the means of "expres sion," of the signifier, but of a signifier whose presence is deliberately chosen. As Ponge once again in a lapidary manner exclaims: raison réson.AWi\ich as the painter or the sculptor needs to attend to the reality of 2.

But both artists are equally concerned with the propriety of the impression made. Neither the Absurd nor surrealism conforms to this Kantian rationalism. Man is dictated equally by the orchestration of vowels and consonants as he is by the necessity of expressing the world, of providing a voice to silent worlds. In looking at co-equivalent efforts, Ponge stresses this fraternity. In his "Note hâtive à l'éloge d'Ebiche," Ponge praises this little known painter for the determination he has shown in not avoiding the fundamen tal question of inventing a new language in order to react properly to natural forces (AC 348). In order to make them out, in order to situate mein Wimm une s emotion, oui aiso io communicate tnat emotion to others, the painter/poet goes beyond established conventions, ways of seeing the world. He must transgress the world in order to express it. Whatever the material nature of the production, both painter, sculptor and poet sign their texts and it is on this function that I would now like to linger awhile as one does in front of a work of art. Writing about Fautrier, Ponge says that his manner of signing is mar vellous: in tiny, energetic but humble characters, providing a scale, a measure for everything else (AC 258). The question is once again situated on a dual plane. On the level of the signifier, one must consider the position and the graphism of the signature of the painter but also, as Derrida has defined it, of the poet's own name as it appears in his texts and not as an afterthought, a conventional ending, but as a substantive part of the text, as signaling the incorporation of the poet within the world at his disposal: a world of letters that belongs to reality itself.5 At the end of The Meadow (Le Pré), Ponge apostrophizes in the following manner: Typographers, sirs, Would you kindly place the final line here. Then below, without any spacing, lay down my name. In lower case, naturally, Except for the initials, of course. Since they also correspond To the Fennel and Parsley Thattomorrowwillgrowabove.

As poem, seductively remind ing the reader-vie wer of the presence of the underground where, in a materialist universe, all bodies eventually will find themselves to become at one with matter, or to become, as the case may be, fennel and parsley. And as typography, to be sure, since the poet, much like the painter, must acknowledge what appears to be a transparent dependency on materials not of his own invention. The signature operates distinctively: it is seen without question and it also defines the end of the text and suggests the identity of the text as a creation of consequence. Its visibility becoming a metonym of creation itself and, perhaps in a slightly metaphysical operation, forces the reader viewer to re-view the text, to consider it from its own point of culmina tion back to its matriarchic origins. For a poem in print this is literally possible; for a painting and for a sculpture, it is a figurative process. The eye goes from signature to text and back again constituting it as an object: an autotelic structure which, nevertheless, modestly contains the universe. More perhaps. The signature is you, dear viewer. We correspond from one signature to another. We are, figuratively there, part of the schema. All signatures from this point of view are equal. Poetry, as Lautréamont once exclaimed, is written by everybody and the signature (or its absence) leaves little to be desired. That certain signatures are more equal than others is also evident, but that aspect of the symbolic is a surdetermination of a given sign: it does not obviate other signatures in the world of texts. However, the text itself is a signature. We detail the identity of the artist, the authority of the text not only in reference to the name appended or incorporated into the text. The visibility of the composition, its style, speaks for its origins and for its acknowledged vision of the world, differ ent though the medium might be. In this way the signature is the universal indicator of Narcissism. We too are reflected in the work of the Other: we are contained in it; we glorify in it as it glories us indirectly. If this Narcissism is other than 6. Serge Gavronsky, "The Meadow," in The Power of Language (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1979), p. 119.

It is not out of a degree of misogyny that he has deflected from his texts his most intimate sentiments; as he says of his own work, it is in fact those very things he loves best which he cannot express.7 What he is left with, but then what pride he finds in its development, are things, the simplest ornaments of this marvellous machine that is our universe as first seen by Lucretius and then by a painter like Chardin. In this enterprise can the painter-poet ever totally efface himself from his own creation? As he repeatedly states in his observations on painting and sculpture, the rhetorical vision is singularly more important and as a result tends to reduce the degree of humanism injected into any given text Rut the sianatnrv nnwer is never absent even if it comes to the fore dressed in monastic habits. Throughout Ponge's observations one can trace this running and shift ing metaphor of the monk at work, a paradox supposing that, of all workers, he is the one who systematically refuses to sign and yet is signed by his life's work. Speaking about the Breton painter Kermadec, Ponge notes the fashion in which he proceeds with energy and equilibrium, characteristic of a monk of pleasure (AC 204). This apparent oxymoron underlines the libidinous trajectory that Ponge discovers in himself through his commentaries on others. Under the robe of the monk, all manner of pleasures are to be experienced and, for example, the combina tion of aesthetics and asceticism. The rule is everywhere present. Again speaking about Fautrier, he mentions that, in any case, whatever is done will be done as a form of exercise (AC 19). And then he quotes Braque who appreciated the rule which corrected the emotion (AC 107). The rule establishes the positiveness of the text in a Comtian sense, that is, as a materiality. There is no language without rules and thus Ponge finds himself at odds with Rimbaud's statement concerning the need systemati cally to deregulate all the senses. Closer to the materialist eighteenth century, Ponge assumes that the true ruling of the senses can only come from the most exquisite of them all: Reason itself (AC 350). Picasso is not excluded from this series of observations on a metaphorical interpretation of monasticism. In his blue and pink periods, Picasso's choice will be exactly that of the monk, writes Ponge, that is, poverty itself (AC 193). 7.

Vol. XXII, No. 4 71</page><page sequence="6">L'Esprit Créateur The signature is affixed to the text; the rules of the game oversee its definition and far from being the temporal and fluid portrait of Narcissus, works of art as well as Ponge's own dense and bomb-like texts, as he liked to refer to them, remind the reader-viewer of the only true value of the inscription of art: immortality itself. As the sculptor chisels into the stone or forges his steel constructions, as the painter traverses his canvas with his brush, so the poet with his stylus impresses on paper his own nativity, his life, and the evident expectation of lasting in a manner equal to that of matter itself. Thus, and by a visible pun, Ponge signs one of his texts, on sculpture, using the V instead of the U, as stonecutters do.8 This connection between signature and immortality reminds one of Rabelais' disquisition on procreation and indeed the rapprochement is not that far-fetched since Ponge explicitly accepts the image of the phallus pen/brush. What forces the sperm to ejaculate is the presence of a source of pleasure. But in a more sophisticated way, he describes in a text on Giacometti his own procedure, his own poetics. "I do not describe in extension. It is the simple idea (the essential particularity, the differential fKif T Anlr; u;ont t/~* ovnraee fn PiOAiilofp" ( A 1 TVlP CQmP ic true at the end of his epic poem, The Sun Placed in the Abyss, when the poet writes: "... finally finding the moist doors of your center open, my pen will plunge in, and I will inundate you with my opaline ink from the right side."9 And that in order to assure, as he writes about Muriel Marquet, the "generation of that world we all hope will emerge" (AC 277). The pen like the chisel does not slip. The poet engraves his name in his text; on his text. Thus the poem much like the sculpture stands, a rock, a monument, a tombstone, that will surely live on. A disinterested look at art? Far from it. As I hope to have briefly indicated, what motivates Ponge's appreciation of a variety of aesthetic applications are the corresponding tactics, a similarity of enterprises: the communality of vision as it defines the subject matter, a consciousness of matter itself and, of course, the sensibility of the artist himself. How close are these critical observations to Francis Ponge's own writings? I See the text SCVLPTVRE in AC, passim, as well as F. Berthet, J.-F. Chevrier, J. Thibaudeau, "Ponge, pratiques artistiques," in Digraphe (Paris), No. 8 (1976), pp. 56-59. The painter Bougereau already had in 1884 transformed his "u" into a "v" in his painter's signature.

Ponge makes little distinction between a critical and a creative discourse. It is language and the way that that medium is used and applied which counts and not the special function it plays: as a poem, or as an essay on art. It is then difficult to distinguish between the text Proêmes, La Fabrique du Pré and the linguistic-rhetorical stance of the poet in his essays on painters and sculptors whom he has known and through whose inscription in the Pon gian text, not only the specificity of a work or an artist is revealed, but the essential though discreet outlines of the poet's own autoportrait.
