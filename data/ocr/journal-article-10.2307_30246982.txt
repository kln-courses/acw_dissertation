<plain_text><page sequence="1">Pottery Figurines from Central Arizona by STUART D. SCOTT Stuart Scott obtained his Master's Degree from the University of Arizona in 1959. During the following year he partici- pated in the University of Pennsylvania archaeological proj- etc. at Tikal, Guatemala. After this year of field work in his area of major interest he returned to Arizona to pursue a pro- gram of graduate studies in the Department of Anthropology, working towards his Ph.D. degree. THIRTY YEARS AGO, the late J. W. Simmons, then a resident of Prescott, Arizona, made an archaeological collection near that city. This work produced an unusually large number of prehistoric clay figurines, some 400 in all. The Simmons collection was purchased in 1933 by Gila Pueblo. In 1951, the Gila Pueblo collection, including the Simmons materials, were transferred to the Arizona State Museum where they are now located. This report is a summary of a study of the Simmons collection, presented in 1958 in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the M.A. degree at the University of Arizona. Special emphasis is placed on the description of the figurines and their sig- nificance in Southwestern prehistory. In Mexico clay figurines have been the subject for a number of intensive studies. Their abundance, wide geographic distribution, long pre-Columbian history, and varied typology, have made them signifi- cant culture and horizon indicators. In the Southwest, although figur- ines are widespread, they are much less common than in Mexico. Moreover, they fall far short of those from Mexico in time depth and style variation. As a consequence, with one exception (Morss 1954), the figurines from Southwestern ruins have received little more than passing notice. The Simmons collection, which is accompanied by ex- cavation notes, provides a remarkably good opportunity to examine a localized and intensive expression of the figurine complex. A large majority of the figurines, approximately 340, were found in the vicinity of Groom Creek Divide, within the Bradshaw Mountain 1 rectangle of the Gila Pueblo archaeological survey. This mountainous area (Fig. 1, shaded portion) is a pine woodlands region a few miles south of Prescott, where scattered house and village sites are found at elevations ranging from 5000 to 7000 feet. The figurines were found in abundance in the area bisected by Groom Creek. Simmons named 11</page><page sequence="2">this complex the "Groom Creek Effigy Culture" and postulated that this region was perhaps the focus of the figurine-producing culture. The few remaining figurines, not found in the Bradshaw Mountain 1 rectangle, came from adjacent areas to the north of the Groom Creek drainage. The rarity of figurines outside of the Groom Creek area cannot be attributed completely to the lack of excavation and surveys in other rectangles. Sites excavated in the Prescott 2 rectangle, for example, have produced only one figurine. The diminishing yield of figurines outside the major area re-emphasizes the view that Groom Creek is the focal point of this cultural manifestation. Although some of the figurines were found on the surface, most of them were excavated from burials and middens. Figurines with burials were usually near the skull, but not all burials were accom- panied by offerings. A few burials were disturbed, but the majority had not been vandalized. If the figurine finds are accurately reported, pot- tery figurines were apparently neither overwhelmingly preferred for funerary offerings, nor were they found exclusively in graves, as both human and animal figurines were abundant in middens. There is no information on what proportion of the figurines was found with burials, but it is likely that the bulk came from midden excavations. Simmons (1931) comments as follows on the circumstances of recovery: Figurines recovered by screening middens occurred in two ways: at random (a few) and in shrine like affairs consisting of a small cluster of cobblestone sized rocks. As the turning over of the rubbish progressed, it became almost an accepted fact that when one of these structures was encountered, it would contain a figurine. Shrines are also noted in the Gila Pueblo survey sheets for sites near Groom Creek, although here the figurines are referred to as having been "in association with stones." At one site figurines were found in mid- dens among boulders at the rims of fire places. Others were beneath stones but at some distance from any fire place. Still others were scat- tered in the loose soil. The association of figurines with stones would seem to be more an effort to place a delicate object near a heavy rock for protection than to create an elaborate receptacle as the word shrine suggests. More information on the middens in each site would help to clarify the situation. In general, however, enough figurines have been found in fire places and graves to indicate that they seem to have had some ceremonial value.

The figurines and clay objects have been divided into several classes according to general morphology: human and animal figurines and miscellaneous objects of fired clay. All are similar in character and in method of construction. Representations identified as human outnumbered the animal forms by approximately 2 to 1; however, since some items are badly fragmented, this ratio involves a degree of guesswork. Method of Construction. All but two of the figurines are of the single piece construction type, described by Haury in the report on Snaketown, in which "the whole image was fashioned from one piece of clay, excepting such additions as were made to gain greater realism in forming the body and facial features" (Haury 1937: 234). The two exceptions involve a joining of two rods of clay to form a vertically bisected body, smoothed across the top and bottom (Fig. 2 1). The basic body shape of human figurines is the cylinder. Legs may be long and somewhat naturalistic, or short, stubby appendages, or entirely absent. No human figurines were modelled in a seated posi- tion but some were made to stand upright. The shapes of the bases were described by Simmons (1931) as follows: The bases were of four types (other than those with legs): taper- ing to a dull point; straight sides with a flat base; base wound with a rope of clay; and some stuck into a pellet of clay. The latter two procedures often produced a poor bond and the rope or pellet fell off. As a rule, however, some evidence of the rope or pellet still adheres to the side of the base. Bases may have been tapered in order to be set into the ground. The detached legs show that they and other anatomical details were sometimes formed from pinching and extending of the body clay but more frequently such pieces were formed separately and stuck onto the larger body piece. The flat pinched upper end of the cylinder, representing the head, is tilted back and often occipitally depressed. Less frequently, heads are more rounded frontally and not tilted. Only rarely are facial fea- tures well defined. Representations of humans and animals are not elaborate. Body details of the quadrupeds are confined to eyes, anal openings, and, rarely, mouths. The only method for elaborating the bird figurines is incising to represent wings or feathers. Animal bodies are cylindrical or hemispherical with short, straight legs. There is great variation in size. Over-all lengths of complete human figures range from 3.5 cm. to 15 cm. The variation in the size of the animal figurines is also great, although none reach 15 cm., the length of the largest 14</page><page sequence="5">human figurine (Fig. 2 j). The paste is dark brown to rust color with a coarse to medium fine temper, though the coarse tempering is more common. Often one feature such as a torso or an appendage is disproportionately large. The artisans were satisfied to produce the general appearance and the result is that, with few exceptions, the whole group appears to have been carelessly made. Human Figurines. The human figurines generally show little de- marcation between the heads and the bodies. Eyes and mouths when present are slits or holes. Noses are consistently prominent throughout the whole series. Only two figurines illustrate the genitalia: one male and one female (Fig. 2 b, d). Females can be identified more easily by conical protuberances representing the human breast. These are always about the chest but are variously placed in and out of propor- tion to the length of the body. Only 17 of the human figurines portray the female breast. There is some indication that the figurines were broken with intent, particularly at the neck. Often only heads were recovered with no trace of the bust, so little can be said of the true proportion of the sexes in the manufacture of these figurines except that females seem to predominate. There are a number of complete human figures, the bodies of which show no differentiation as to sex. Also, with so many bodyless heads, it is again impossible to propose a reliable estimate of sexless figurines. Simmons noted that the vast majority did not indicate sex. Upper ex- tremities are almost entirely lacking, the only exceptions being two cases of incipient "arm buds" or lateral extensions of clay in the shoulder area (Fig. 2 h). Lower extremities are more common and vary from highly stylized small appendages to shaped and generally more realistic full length legs (Fig. 2 k). Heads and faces exhibit a great range in physiognomy. The most common form is a flat disc head tilted upward with a depressed occiput, generally triangular to oval in outline, and stylistic and simple in ap- pearance (Fig. 2 c, i, and j). From this standard, there are several variations in which not only heads change to more realistic proportions, but more detailed facial features are added such as pierced ears (Fig. 2 e), nostrils (Fig. 2 a), and occasionally an opened mouth (Fig. 2 a). These variations are not patterned and they represent an apparent at- tempt at individuation. There are two curious funnel shaped heads that expand from the neck to the top (Fig. 2 f). Figurines g, i, and m in Figure 2 illustrate a variation in the method of construction. This consists of a heavy wad of clay, flattened 15</page><page sequence="6">on the end and crudely spherical to amorphous in outline. This repre- sents the base that supported the body vertically. While the heads are missing from these forms in many cases, a few of the cylindrical bodies have human breasts. A few complete human figures which preserve this globular base (Fig. 2 i) suggest that this is just an alternate type of basal support. Animal Figurines. The animal figurines exhibit the same quality and diversity as already observed in the human figurines. Birds and quadrupeds are the two classes of animals and they are represented by approximately 60 whole and broken pieces. Simmons (1931) is very imaginative in his discussion of the identification of the animals: They consist of every known small animal and up to the bear and deer. They are so representative that in very few instances is one in doubt about the species that they represent. The squirrel, gopher, bear, the fox, coyote, or wolf, naturally fall into one group and I sup- pose are very much alike. Among the avian forms, the grouse, parrot, and full chested owl are as detailed as any artist can paint. As among the human figurines, there is a predominant animal form that is somewhat standardized. This is an unidentified quadruped, usually with short, stubby, and straight legs supporting a heavy globular body (Fig. 3 h, k). Tails are pinched to a point, often sticking up or away from the body. A few have an intentional perforation below the tail that presumably represents an anal orifice and it is usually con- tinuous with another opening in the chest of the animal or on the ventral surface between the forelegs. Wendorf (1950) noted the same phe- nomenon on eight specimens from a late ruin at Point of Pines. Fulton and Tuthill (1940:50) include the following explanation in their dis- cussion of the human and animal figurines from the Gleeson Site: Some of the figurines from Gleeson, both animal and human, had been modelled on a small twig or large grass stem, as evidenced by the small hole running through the long axes of the bodies, a feature especially noticeable in the broken fragments of torsos. The real pur- pose of this rod is not known but it may have served to stiffen the body during the modelling or as a handle while the clay was still wet and soft. Whether the rods were withdrawn prior to firing or whether they were allowed to burn out in the process cannot be determined. It is likely that a natural orifice was intended, for several specimens have an anal orifice that is not continuous with an internal channel. No human torsos illustrate this grass stem type of construction. The majority of the animal figurines are made by simple hand modelling, but there is also one example of a large animal torso, broken at the neck and hollow with very thin sides. It is clear that the makers of these figurines intended to represent common forms of wildlife around them. As a rule, however, similari- 16</page><page sequence="7">" . .:..- a d B'..

Length of j, 15 cm. 17</page><page sequence="8">ties are greater than differences, and each animal embodies a combi- nation of anatomical features that make a single identification difficult. There are exceptions. One small quadruped has ringed incisions around the body resembling the encased bony plates of an armadillo (Fig. 3 b). Figure 3 i and j are tentatively identified as badger and kit fox. A parrot was clearly intended in Figure 3 f. Knowledge of the parrot is indi- cated by a parrot skull and beak among the non-ceramic artifacts from the Bradshaw Mountains. A triangular head with protuberant eyes (Fig. 3 d) suggests a reptilian form. Figure 3 c is typical of several quadru- peds which look like models of the peccary or wild pig, and Figure 3 e closely resembles a well fed prairie dog or ground squirrel. Except for two birds modelled in simulated flight (Fig. 3 a), all birds sit upright on three supports, the tail and two legs (Fig. 3 f and g). Where wings and feathers are present, they are represented by vertical and hori- zontal parallel incisions. CHRONOLOGICAL PLACEMENT The approximate time period of the figurines is based on a study of the associated ceramics. We are not concerned with a chronology of technical change because there is no evidence for a sequence of de- velopment in the group of figurines. The aim is to establish a relative time framework in which to date the figurines. There is no archaeolog- ical evidence for the direct association of the following vessels with the figurines, but it is known that these vessels were found at sites within the same rectangles of the Gila Pueblo Survey and, by infer- ence, the ceramics and figurines are considered to be contemporary. At the Arizona State Museum, there are 60 whole or restored vessels from sites in the Jerome 4, 7, 8, and Bradshaw Mountains 1 rectangles of the Gila Pueblo survey. Both locally made and intrusive pottery types are represented. Most of the vessels in the collection are indigenous types. The most abundant decorated pottery type is Prescott Black-on-gray (Cay- wood and Spicer 1935: 50), previously called Verde Black-on-gray (Gladwin 1930: 140). There are 17 large deep bowls of this pot- tery type from the Jerome rectangles. Verde Brown is the predomi- nant type of pottery in the group. There are 30 vessels of this plain- ware type, mostly small bowls and a few large jars (Caywood and Spicer 1935: 42). There are fewer vessels of intrusive pottery types. Six of the seven black-on-white bowls in the collection are identified as Tusayan Black-on-white (Colton and Hargrave 1937: 213). There is only 18</page><page sequence="9">.., -..-. .. . .

Length of j, 10.3 cm. 19</page><page sequence="10">one bowl of Black Mesa Black-on-white; it is also reminiscent of Sosi Black-on-white. There is one bowl of Kayenta Polychrome. One un- typed specimen is an abberant form of a Black-on-red bowl with White Mountain characteristics, but with a northern Arizona design. Spicer (1933: 5) has shown that the geographic range of Pres- cott Black-on-gray is considerable, extending north and south from the Bradshaw Mountains to the north end of the Hualpai Mountains. The time span for this pottery type covers Pueblo III-IV, probably between A.D. 1150 and 1300 (Colton and Hargrave 1937: 185). Prescott Black-on-gray is not diagnostic therefore in fixing the age of the figurines. The Verde Brown has even less value for time place- ment because it was in general use for as much as 300 years, from 1000 to 1300 (Colton and Hargrave !.937: 167). The trade wares are more critical for recording chronological position. The Black Mesa Black-on-white bowl, if transitional to the later Sosi Black-on-white, would place it in late Pueblo II or early Pueblo III. The other black-on-white bowls were identified collectively as Tusayan Black-on-white. They might be further divided into one or two other varieties of the Kayenta Series on the basis of paste characteristics, but such a test was not necessary for the purposes of this report. Tusayan Black-on-white is dated by Colton and Hargrave (1937: 213) at about A.D. 1225 to 1300. This is done by correla- tion with dated wood specimens. The same method produces an ap- proximate range of A.D. 1250 to 1300 for the Kayenta Polychrome bowl. The ceramic mixture represented by these pottery types suggests the Pueblo III Stage of northern Arizona; I infer the same approxi- mate temporal position for the figurines. CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS The comparison of figurines in the Simmons collection with others in the Southwest is based primarily on the anthropomorphic figurines and the animal forms are considered only as they provide additional information. To the north and south of Prescott are two notable con- centrations of Southwestern figurines, termed Northern and Southern traditions by Morss (1954). In his discussion of the Northern Periphery, Morss follows an earlier division by Steward (1936), separating the Fremont culture area of east central Utah from the culture area of western Utah. The Fremont culture is generally considered to be of predominantly Basket- maker III inspiration. Basketmaker III figurines appear more primi- tive but bear resemblances to the eastern Utah specimens. The Basket- 20</page><page sequence="11">maker pattern is continued in the Fremont figurines in size, material, and decorative aspects. Morss (1954: 14) observes: Most of the Fremont figurines represent females but a few have flat chests. The most consistent feature is the pinched nose ridge . . . the body may either end in a straight bar slightly rounded at the bot- tom ("handle-terminus"), have a slight forward projecting bifurcation ("stump-leg terminus"), or flare at the base, in which case it is usually covered with an apron of clay fillets ("skirt terminus") or more ac- curately, ("apron terminus"). Hair and ornaments may be represented by additional applied fillets, blobs, or discs, which are occasionally painted. In the west, divided by Steward into the Sevier and Salt Lake areas, figurines are described from both sections as having general features in common. Steward summarizes the feature of about 50 speci- mens from mounds in both sections. Most of them are of unburned clay and he says that those that are fired were probably not done so intentionally. Individual variation is always more evident in a larger group of artifacts, but as before we will still be concerned with the general characteristics which apply to all those of western Utah, as stated by Steward (1936: 22): The body is square shouldered and tapers to a rounded terminus or "foot," the head is seldom marked off from the body; legs are clearly indicated in only one specimen; arms are never present; breasts are frequently represented. The last can hardly be arms for not only do they resemble breasts in form and position, but in one specimen the nipples are carefully formed. Facial features are always shown, the eyes being stuck on, grooved clay buttons, the nose sometimes pinched into a slight ridge merely indicated by two perforations for nostrils, the mouth, a small perforation. In some instances a headgear and hair are present. The remainder of the body is generally plain except for a navel occasionally indicated by a small perforation. Most of the backs of these specimens are concave. The rounded han- dle-terminus seems to be the most common base treatment although several have short bowed legs with toes indicated by slits in the feet. Viewed in relation to the Fremont figurines, these western Utah examples differ in a few bodily characteristics. A point by point com- parison, however, would not yield significant results for the purpose here. In most respects, figurines of the Northern Periphery are alike. Attention is now called to a review of the general style of the north. The determination of a "northern type" is impossible, just as the "Prescott type" is not a standard which is expressed by a number of identical models. In general, figurines of the Northern Tradition are elaborate by Prescott standards. Applied clay pellets and clay strips seem to be the rule for showing both natural features and decorative ornamentation. Although some representation of the nose is a con- sistent feature throughout the northern series, there seems to be less 21</page><page sequence="12">emphasis on making it the largest and dominant feature of the face. The "stumpleg," "handle," and "skirt" termini are the three treatments of the base. Most of the northern figurines are female forms. The same care is taken with portrayal of the breasts as elsewhere. No recognizable male torso is illustrated from the Northern Tradition by either Morss or Steward. Obviously, all of the Northern Tradition examples do not follow the foregoing description; a few are very simple and without any decoration except a nose. Disregarding these exceptions, however, the broadened shoulders, elaborate flared and filleted base, and other applied clay ornaments give the northern specimens a general char- acter that is somewhat removed from the Prescott series. The Southern Tradition is based on the Snaketown development which was the first systematic study of the figurines of the Hohokam. Excavations at the site of Snaketown produced over 500 specimens, most of which could be assigned to the various phases of Hohokam development. Comparing figurines of the Northern and Southern tra- ditions on a general basis, configurations are not wholly different. Morss states (1954: 30): The Snaketown figurines are in general comparable with their northern counterparts in size, frontal orientation, predominance of the female sex with breasts represented, emphasis on eyes, and on the heavy nose ridge with omission or summary treatment of the mouth and lack of emphasis on arms which may be indicated by mere stumps or wholly omitted. The general effect then is that there are many correspondences and the need arises to examine the samples more closely for specific trait distinctions. Using the Snaketown sequence, figurines of the Pio- neer period including Vahki, Estrella, Sweetwater, and Snaketown phases can be described as a unit. They are generally crude with anatomical features that appear to be executed with the same amount of skill as those of the Prescott examples. Eyes are most commonly represented by slits and occasionally small holes. In the Pioneer Period, heads were uniformly unrealistic, concave in the rear, and continued so with the exception of a hollow headed form in the Estrella Phase with a basin depression in the top of the head, such as is shown in Figure 2 f of the Simmons figurines. Extensive morphological change is first recognized in the specimens of the Gila Butte Phase (Haury 1937). Morss (1954: 30) comments: The material attributed to the Gila Butte Phase of the Colonial Period is rather heterogeneous, with specimens resembling Pioneer types and a few heads with Santa Cruz characteristics, but apparently char- acteristic of this phase is the use of additional incised lines in the region of the eye slit to outline the eye in lozenge form or to indicate the eyebrow. 22</page><page sequence="13">Figurines other than those from Snaketown are considered by Morss in reviewing the Southern Tradition styles. There were only a few fragments of figurine torsos from Ventana Cave (Haury 1950) and they were considered to be Hohokam. At Los Muertos (Haury 1945), which is a Classic period site of the Hohokam dated in the 14th century, one specimen is suggestive of the apron terminus of the Fremont style. Another is an upright cylindrical torso with tilted head that is almost identical to those from Prescott. Elsewhere in southern Arizona non-Hohokam traits are found. Some of the figurines from a cremation at Tres Alamos in southeastern Arizona resemble those in the Santa Cruz cremation group at Snaketown (Morss 1954: 33). These figurines have lines of punctations indicating necklaces and other elaborations which are suggestive of the refinements in the south- ern figurine style that Morss compares with the style of the Northern Periphery. The Santa Cruz heads, minus the linear punctations, are very much like the more realistic types in the Prescott series and they also resemble others in southern Arizona from the San Simon Valley and Texas Canyon. Taking the Southern Tradition as a whole, the following are the traits to be compared. Long legs are a characteristic of the Hohokam apparently through the whole series represented at Snaketown. For the Pioneer Period, slit eyes and a crude treatment of the face is the rule. Ridge noses are prominent throughout the series. Heads are not inclined, but are in the same plane as the body, rectangular, flat on top, and concave in the rear. Other general characteristics have al- ready been stated, including the lack of emphasis on arms and the predominance of the female sex. Many features of the earlier phases are carried over in Santa Cruz. Among the changes that occur in the transition is the switch from the two-piece method of manufacture - a basic characteristic of Pioneer to a dominance of the one-piece method in the Santa Cruz phase. Haury (1937: 235) describes the decorative techniques which increase in and after Santa Cruz: Articles of clothing and leg and ankle bands are shown by bits of clay attached to the bodies. In one case it is also evident that some- thing of a perishable nature was stuck into the head of the figurine while the clay was soft. The practice of doing this may have been the begin- ning of the development of perishable bodies of the Sacaton Phase figurines. In the Sacaton Phase of the Sedentary Period, the last represented at Snaketown, figurines reach a point of realism that is very dissimilar to anything described from Prescott or the Northern Periphery. The principal apparent difference between the Prescott and the 23</page><page sequence="14">Fremont anthropomorphs is the degree of refinement. Neither cloth- ing or other ornamentation is found on the Prescott examples. This is in contrast to the applied painted fillets and other embellishments frequent on Fremont forms. There are important similarities. Both share the typical flat chest and large massive nose ridge and a pre- dominance of female forms. There is little or no concern with upper extremities in either series. The bifurcated base ("stump-leg terminus") is suggestive of the short, stylized legs of the Prescott anthropomorphs. The same is true for the smooth rounded base, termed "handle-ter- minus" by Morss. The "skirt-terminus," however, has no counterpart among the Prescott figurines. The variety of base construction illus- trated in Figure 2 is representative of the whole collection and there is nothing that resembles the flared "apron-terminus." Conversely, the heavy lumps of clay that serve as basal supports for some of the Pres- cott specimens are absent among the Fremont figurines. Eyes of the Prescott anthropomorphs are simple horizontal incisions or small cir- cular holes in the clay, as opposed to the applied discs of clay with holes in the Fremont style. Fremont figurines are made of unfired clay, as are the others of the Northern Tradition. Differences in the western figurine group have already been dis- cussed. The "owlish appearance" described for Fremont is repeated in western Utah. The ornamental nature of the Northern style is not in keeping with the Prescott form. In the north, more attention is given to finer details. The absence of the tilted facial plane, the owlish faces, and the flared filleted bases, give the Northern Tradition an easily dis- tinguished appearance - a development that shows little influence on or from the Prescott area. Because of the similarity of certain traits, the Prescott figurines have been considered in the literature to be a normal component of the Southern figurine complex. The lack of applied elements is per- haps the most obvious feature of the Prescott group. On the strength of a first impression, the Prescott figurines would probably be linked with the early Hohokam series. "In the Pioneer Period, the figure is usually crude, eyes are represented by slits or holes, and applied decora- tion is rare" (Morss 1954: 30). Then Gila Butte and later Hohokam styles begin to show resemblances to the more elaborate northern styles. The culture area around Prescott has been characterized as an area of borrowing. Spicer (1933) discusses the assimilation by people of this Prescott region, of all the basic elements of Pueblo civilization, including the Pueblo arts. The actual historical relationships of the people who produced this culture are not known. Therefore, it is only 24</page><page sequence="15">on a generalized basis that these figurines are said to be derived from another cultural development, but, in this account, I have tried to show evidence for the following statements. Figurines of the Prescott type most closely resemble Pioneer Hohokam styles and a few also approximate Santa Cruz forms. This combined with the presence of certain other Hohokam elements in the Prescott region, such as spindle whorls and a palette fragment (Scott 1958), leads to the conclusion that "The Prescott form is to be considered as a normal component of the Southern figurine complex" (Morss 1954: 36). The figurines from Prescott are a part of the artistic expressions of that culture area. They embody both representational and stylized, somewhat abstract forms, and are characterized by a persistent crudity in the manufacturing technique. Although in contact with Pueblo people to the north, these people also received a number of influences from the south. The perforated ear lobes of Figure 2 e may have been a local addition since none of the figurines illustrated or discussed from north or south have these. Besides the similarity in general form between Prescott and Hohokam types, certain exotic features such as the flared head (Fig. 2 f) are shared by the two. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION This paper presents the results of an analysis of 400 pottery fig- urines from the area of Prescott, Arizona. The collection is one of the largest known from the Southwest. In addition to the human and animal figurines, there are miscellaneous objects of fired clay and an assem- blage of non-ceramic artifacts consisting mostly of tools of bone, stone, and shell. Finally, there are 60 vessels from this general area of Prescott which were used to determine a relative age for the fig- urines. The figurines which are the main interest of this report, were found in burials and middens in the Bradshaw Mountains 1 rectangle of the Gila Pueblo archaeological survey. Certain features of the anthropomorphs are recognized on fig- urines from elsewhere in the Southwest. Among these are features which suggest a relationship to the Hohokam development of southern Arizona. It has not been possible to demonstrate precise contempo- raneity of the Prescott figurines with those of other areas. The Pueblo II or Pueblo III age of the figurines compares in a general way with the late Snaketown sequence. However, physical resemblances are stronger to the earlier Hohokam styles. Haury (1937: 240) sug- gests: "... it must be inferred that if derived from the Hohokam, the diffusion occurred prior to the Gila Butte Phase and that the figurine 25</page><page sequence="16">development in the Prescott area lagged." The figurines of the Simmons collection have been described and the evidence for spatial distribution and time association summarized. The total picture is that of a prevailingly imitative complex of figurines of late Pueblo II to Pueblo III times. Although marginal to both major figurine concentrations in the Southwest, the Prescott specimens were influenced by both the north and the south. The alignment of the Prescott style with the Southern Tradition, however, is based on the accumulation of significant details in the figurines themselves, the mis- cellaneous objects, and in the non-ceramic artifacts.
