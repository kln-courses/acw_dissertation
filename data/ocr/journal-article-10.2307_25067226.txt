<plain_text><page sequence="1">Visual Formula and Meaning in Neo-Assyrian Relief Sculpture Mehmet-Ali Ata? Palace reliefs of the Neo-Assyrian Empire (883-612 BCE) have a long-acknowledged content of a "historical" or "his toricizing" character, especially visible in many scenes of batties and sieges. They are, however, also characterized by a distinctive manner of formulaic representation focusing es pecially on the ruler figure and his associates.1 Chains of visual formulas sometimes run through entire series of pan els, as is the case in Room G of the Northwest Palace of Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BCE) in Nimrud (Fig. 1). Some times such formulas appear individually and discretely, tucked in scenes that otherwise have a "narrative" or "histori cizing" character, such as the scene of "encounter" between the enthroned Sennacherib (704-681 BCE) and a royal as sociate wearing a headband in the panoramic relief series of Sennacherib's Southwest Palace in Nineveh depicting the historically identifiable siege of the Judean city of Lachish.2 Such visual formulas in Assyrian reliefs have a distinct seman tic capacity and their deployment is a conscious and well calculated device on the part of the designers of relief pro grams to create a visual language of a "hieratic" character. This hieratic visual language seems to pertain to funda mental philosophical and religious notions that permeated Assyrian kingship and theocracy, many aspects of which are still relatively obscure to us.3 Even though a definitive inter pretation of these visual configurations may not be possible, their consistent and almost mathematically thought-out de sign, treatment, and occurrence in the reliefs should be taken as indications that what one faces here is a special system of visual denotation and connotation, not unlike the ancient Egyptian visual formulas such as the sema taxvy, "union," which refers to the unification of the two lands of Upper and Lower Egypt, or the Egyptian king smiting captured enemies with a mace (Figs. 2, 3). These designs have a standardized emblematic quality that takes them out of the ordinary realm of pictorial representation, placing them in a timeless rheto ric of hieratic or cosmic character. One could think that Neo-Assyrian art has a semiotic di mension analogous to the aforementioned Egyptian formu las, an understanding of which need not be contingent on explicit textual parallels found either inscribed on the reliefs themselves or in other contemporary literary or "historical" sources. This semiotic element has autonomous dimensions, as it were, which render Assyrian visual culture a mode of signification or communication almost independent from writing and texts. Learning from Egypt In the studies of both ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian art, mention is often made of a semantic and functional relation between art and writing in dealing with the formative periods of the visual cultures of the two geographic areas, both of which can roughly be dated about 3000 BCE.4 The combination, or coextensiveness, of art and writing in the earliest phases of ancient Mesopotamian and Egyptian art is a complex topic, a full treatment of which would go beyond the scope of this paper. Nevertheless, one aspect of this phenomenon is extremely relevant to my inquiry: in both Mesopotamia and Egypt, elements of visual representation of the emblematic type referred to above appear on elite art objects far earlier than actual mature writing or script enters the artistic and intellectual sphere.5 In the absence of con tinuous texts or written literature, these earliest formulaic images may be thought to have addressed and recorded certain fundamental philosophical and religious concepts that could not otherwise have been recorded in any perma nent format.6 It is precisely this quality or potency of emblem atic or formulaic representation that constitutes the bedrock for the kind of "scriptual" or "semiotic" element examined here in relation to the art of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. I should also like to stress that this formulaic representa tion has nothing directly to do with text-image problems, and that this examination makes no attempt to "read" art as if it were a text. It should also be noted that, throughout this study, I use the term semiotic in a rather literal, if not pedes trian, sense, in reference to its derivation from the Greek word sema, sign, rather than to any branch of contemporary philosophical inquiry or linguistic analogy, for it is in relation to an embedded visual sign system that I intend to approach the art of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. It is my argument that the emblematic or semiotic element that characterizes the for mative phases of both ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian art never disappears from their respective visual records. Even in the presence and availability of writing, texts, and literature, this semiotic continues to function in such a unique way that what it achieves could by no means be replaced or paralleled by texts themselves. In this respect, it represents a continuum, or a "tradition," as it were, that was shared by Egypt and Mesopotamia throughout their history, notwithstanding the many centuries of political, cultural, and stylistic fluctuations. The kind of semiotic that exists in the Neo-Assyrian visual record examined here is in fact more immediately visible in ancient Egyptian art, partly on account of the more blatantly juxtaposed elements of ancient Egyptian visual language, such as the royal crowns, floral elements, and insignia held by the king, as will be seen in the comparison with Assyrian examples in the following pages.7 Analogous elements em bedded in certain Neo-Assyrian representations, however, are more subtly and elusively deployed. In turn, certain glosses and interpretations obtained from a study of Neo-Assyrian visual formulas from this perspective may be of use in easing the sometimes almost opaque and frozen perceptions we might have of Egyptian visual formulas, opening it up to possible underlying meaning.</page><page sequence="2">70 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2006 VOLUME LXXXVIII NUMBER 1 IL L_ 1 Panels 1-4 (main scene) and 6-8 (second group), Room G, Northwest Palace of Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BCE), Nimrud (reconstruction draw ing from J. Meuszynski, Die Rekonstruk tion der Reliefdarstellungen und ihrer Anordnung im Nordwestpalast von Kalhu [Nimrud], Baghdader Forschungen, vol. 2 [Mainz: Philipp von Zabern, 1981], pl. 8, reproduced by permission) The rationale for such a comparative approach was eluci dated by Irene Winter in an essay treating an ancient Meso potamian case along with a living tradition of image worship in India: Support for such an enterprise cannot be gathered from any premise of continuity, which would require the dem onstration of either historical contact or some type of contextual similarity (e.g., environmental). Instead, one must have recourse to an argument based upon the dem onstration of systemic parallels between the two members of the comparison. Only following upon such a demon stration can one then proceed to an analysis, not assump tion, of the possibility that particular aspects of the societies under discussion may be indeed analogous and/or that known aspects of practice/behavior/belief in one tradi tion are such as to suggest that, in the absence of data from the other, the former may serve by analogy to explain or amplify understanding in the latter.8 Mesopotamia and Egypt, to a certain extent, seem to conform to the two parameters for the "premise of continuity" cited above?"historical contact" and "some type of contextual similarity (e.g., environmental)."9 It is also the case that many of the Egyptian visual formulas addressed below are much earlier in origin and development than any of the Neo Assyrian examples under consideration. However, the overall figurai and morphological qualities of each group of exam ples are so different from one another that the analogies pursued below hardly go beyond the structural, conceptual, or, to borrow Winter's term, "systemic." Rather than an in stance of historical transmission, what we may be seeing here is a deeply ingrained, and perhaps somewhat unique, shared mentality in certain fundamental matters between Egypt and Mesopotamia that manifests itself in domains outside artistic production as well. For instance, in both Egypt and Meso potamia, sculptural images were subject to the so-called "opening of the mouth" ceremony in order to bring them ritually to life. Further, in the mythology of each culture the sun god travels at night in the netherworld.10 In other words, matters here are perhaps more complex than either compar ing two distant entities in a framework such as delineated and defended by Winter in the quote above or tracing transmis sion of motifs and ideas from one culture to the other.11 This rather complex dynamic, I believe, makes comparing Egypt and Assyria at once challenging and rewarding in that, on the one hand, there seems to be in this relation a rather elusive bond, one that defies any straightforward theory of transmission, while on the other hand, the parameters of inquiry seem to conform to the bases on which a comparison of the two systems may be justified as a methodological tool, as already put forward in the passage by Winter quoted above. Finally, to Winter's parameters, I would add one other: that even if there may be no absence of data or lack of under standing in either of the counterparts of a comparison, one may still be justified in going ahead with a comparison for an enhanced affirmation of the relevant arguments and inter pretations proposed in a particular scholarly framework. Looking at the changing facets of the use of visual formu las, both in iconography and in palace design, as taken up and exploited by the designers of different kings ranging from Ashurnasirpal II to Ashurbanipal (668-631 BCE), leads to the idea that the art of Ashurnasirpal II represents the most densely and emphatically formulaic phase of Neo-Assyr ian art (Fig. 1). With the transfer of the imperial Assyrian capital from Assur to Nimrud (Fig. 4),12 the creators of this relief program must have intended to invent a visual vocab ulary that would have not only superseded the developments of the Middle Assyrian period (ca. 1350-1000 BCE) but also formed a unique synthesis of art and erudition, worthy of a new page in the history of the Assyrian state. This unique synthesis, characterized by a dense formulaic visual texture (Fig. 1), slowly dissolves as one moves later in the Neo Assyrian period. Nevertheless, this texture is by no means eradicated, as it appears in different formats, albeit in a reduced manner, in the palaces that follow Ashurnasirpal's.</page><page sequence="3">FORMULA AND MEANING IN NEO-ASSYRIAN RELIEF SCULPTURE 7]_ 2 "Binding of the Two Lands," from the Temple of Ramses III (1194-1163 BCE), Medinet Habu, Nineteenth Dynasty (artwork in the public domain; photograph by V. de Mestral Combremont, from Gustave J?quier, L'architecture et la d?coration dans l'ancienne Egypte: Les temples ramessides et sa?tes de la XIXe ? la XXXe dynastie [Paris: Moranc?, 1922], pi. 62) The Encounter In laying out the formulaic texture of the Neo-Assyrian palace reliefs, I begin with one of the most salient motifs seen in the iconography of these carvings. It could be termed the "en counter scene," since it depicts the Assyrian king and a high ranking official wearing a headband face-to-face in several variations (Fig. 3). In the art of Ashurnasirpal II, this encoun ter scene is deployed in roughly three variations. The first, and perhaps the most subtle or indirect one, can be seen in some of the scenes from the throne room, Room B, of the Northwest Palace of Ashurnasirpal II (Fig. 5). These scenes depict libations poured over a hunted lion and a hunted bull in the aftermath of the ceremonial royal hunt. In these compositions, the king and the figure with the headband are shown facing one another, with the dead animal in between (Figs. 6-8). The fact that there are other dignitaries and military officers depicted in these scenes is what makes them more indirect, in contrast, say, to the encounter scenes that appear on the facade of the throne room or on other panels within the throne room itself, which show the king and this high-ranking official face-to-face in an unmediated manner (Fig. 3). It is, however, in the aforementioned libation scenes 3 Ashurnasirpal II and an official, detail of panel 7b, Room B (throne room), Northwest Palace of Ashurnasirpal II, Nimrud.

Comparison of the two libation scenes from the throne room reveals numerous important differences. In the bull scene, the figure with the headband stands closer to the king, right in front of the dead animal, whereas in the lion scene, he remains behind the officiating eunuch,13 who is shown cooperating with the king in the libation ritual. The bull scene hence presents a more compact version of the encoun</page><page sequence="4">72 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2006 VOLUME LXXXVIII NUMBER 1 5 10 15 20 25 30m CZ 5 Plan of the "State Apartments" of the Northwest Palace of Ashurnasirpal II, Nimrud (from S.

Further differences between the two scenes, in addition to the obvi ous difference in the hunted animal depicted, can be seen in the composition of the group of figures located in front of the king. For instance, the eunuch standing next to the high-ranking official with the headband is armed with a sword in the lion scene. In the bull scene, the same eunuch figure, who here stands by himself at the center, is shown without a sword. Such elements that perhaps function on the micro, rather than macro, level are clear indications that there is a visual "script" encoded in these scenes that in great likelihood deploys each figure for a specific purpose in the expression of messages and concepts. Both scenes can be divided into two distinct zones: on the left, the zone marked by the king, his entourage, and the dead animal, and on the right, the zone marked by the high ranking official wearing the headband, the officiating eu nuch, the other eunuch who stands in the middle, and the musicians at the back, who perhaps play a ceremonial tune. For the purposes of our analysis, let us call the left-hand zone the king side, which is responsible for the delivery of the hunted animal or the sacrificial victim, and the right-hand zone the non-king side, which seems to receive and "bless" the affair. It is noteworthy that both the high-ranking official with the headband and the freestanding eunuch of the bull scene are depicted with their hands clasped.14 Clearly, their side has more of a pious, or sacerdotal, appearance to it, strengthened by the presence of cultic musicians, in compar ison to the greater military emphasis of the other side. Further differences can be observed in the king sides of both libation scenes. For instance, whereas in the lion scene four fully armed attendants stand behind the king, in the bull scene, there are only three attendants, one of whom is the royal parasol bearer. If such subde but significant differences between these two structurally analogous compositions are not for the sake of variety, what one then sees here is the manifestation of a sense or system of visual decorum, per haps dictated by, or going along with, the nature and the symbolism of the animal hunted in each scene. Perhaps the fierceness and royal symbolism of the lion stipulated a more emphatically military appearance in its composition. The symbolism of the bovine may have dictated a slightly differ ent, perhaps less emphatically military, kind of constellation, whereby the central eunuch lacks a sword, the official with the headband stands closer to the dead animal, and a parasol bearer is introduced.</page><page sequence="5">FORMULA AND MEANING IN NEO-ASSYRIAN RELIEF SCULPTURE 73 B-20 B-19 B-18 6 Panels 18-20, Room B, Northwest Palace of Ashurnasirpal II, Nimrud (reconstruction drawing from Meuszynski, Die Rekonstruktion der Reliefdarstellungen, pi. 1, reproduced by permission) 7 The king making a libation over a dead bull, panel 20b, Room B, Northwest Palace of Ashurnasirpal II, Nimrud.

The British Museum, London (artwork in the public domain; photograph ? the Trustees of the British Museum) What would be the significance of pairing these two ani mals, the lion and the bull, within the context of these two formulaic libation scenes? We know from Assyrian royal in scriptions that the lion and the bull were not the only animals the Assyrian king hunted, as that category includes ele phants and even ostriches.15 Clearly, the lion and the bull were here selected for a specific semantic purpose. In Assyr ian royal inscriptions, both the lion and the wild bull are qualified by the adjectival designation ekdu in Akkadian, meaning "fierce" or "ferocious," which also characterizes one of the royal epithets, "fierce/ferocious predator." In the "Standard Inscription" of Ashurnasirpal II?the inscription that runs across many of this king's relief panels in the Northwest Palace, as well as in his Ninurta Temple in scription?the king is referred to as "attentive prince, wor shipper of the Great Gods, ferocious predator, conqueror of cities and the entire highlands."16 It has been suggested that the adjective "fierce/ferocious" (ekdu), which is other wise used only for lions and wild bulls, may demonstrate that the king is as fierce as, or even more so, than the animals</page><page sequence="6">74 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2006 VOLUME LXXXVIII NUMBER 1 9 The libation scene from the lion hunt reliefs of Ashurbanipal, Room S1, North Palace of Ashurbanipal (668-631 BCE), Nineveh. The British Museum, London (artwork in the public domain; photograph ? the Trustees of the British Museum) he overpowers, giving an indication of his power and viri lity.17 Looking at the lion and the wild bull from an ontological as well as symbolic standpoint, however, might lead one to think that the leonine and the bovine may have embodied distinct inherent semantic aspects. For one thing, the bull, even if it is of the wild type qualified by the adjective "fierce" (ekdu), is never a predator. I would further argue that the bull and the lion were here meant as two signifiers that together constituted a "complementary opposition" (a theme further explored below). In fact, the lion attacking the bull is one of the perennial themes of the art of the ancient Near East from Early Dynastic Mesopotamia to Achaemenid Iran, a configu ration that surely points to a relation of opposition-cww equilibrium rather than one of straightforward equiva lence.18 A related visual expression displaying the same principle of a complex yet balanced opposition can be seen approxi mately two centuries later, in a bipartite composition from one of the lion-hunt panels of Ashurbanipal. The composi tion depicts the king and his military entourage on the right-hand side of an altar and incense stand and, on the left-hand side of the same group of cultic furniture, a group of attendants without weapons carrying dead lions preceded by musicians (Fig. 9). Chikako Watanabe has suggested that the left-hand side of this scene may be read as an antecedent of the right-hand side, the dead lions located to the right shown at left in the process of being brought toward the king for the libation ceremony.19 Even if this is so, the artist here has made use of this merger in conveying a visual scheme of duality analogous to those that we have looked at in the libation scene of Ashurnasirpal II. Watanabe also makes the observation that in Ashurbani paTs libation scene the usual sequence of the placement of the altar and the incense stand is reversed. The norm, as traced in a number of examples by Watanabe, is to place the altar closer to the recipient of the veneration, for example, a temple or a carved image of the king.20 Here, since it is Ashurbanipal who performs the pious act, one would expect not only the other side to contain a venerable entity or image but also the altar to be placed closer to that side. Watanabe accounts for this "problem" as follows: The fact that those two scenes are facing each other ... suggests that this was an intentional device of the artist to unify those two scenes into one. This unification inciden tally creates the implicit effect that the figure of the king standing on the side of the offering table could be over lapped with the figure which has been worshipped in the normal ritual scenes, as if he is worshipped by the pro ceeding attendants from the left.21 One should keep in mind, however, that on the basis of our analysis, the left side of this composition is the equivalent of the non-king side of Ashurnasirpal's libation reliefs and may in fact be charged with an aura of venerability and receptivity, further enhanced by its lack of military equipment. One detail that Watanabe does not note in her analysis of this scene is the orientation of the bow. It has been observed that "when the bow is held vertically by Assyrian kings it is almost invariably held so that the string is turned away from the king's body."22 The configuration presented by this par ticular libation scene clearly constitutes an exception to this rule of thumb. Moreover, it has been proposed that in formal emblematic contexts, the direction faced by the arch of the bow denotes the superior party in Assyrian art, and the subordinate in Egyptian.23 If the orientation of the bow has indeed such a significance in Assyrian art, in the case of Ashurbanipal's libation scene, the king, facing the strings of the bow, would be on the subordinate side. This reversal may be thought to be consonant with the reversal created by the positioning of the altar and the incense stand noted by Watanabe. In other words, rather than considering the king as the recipient of the devotion, as Watanabe suggests, one wonders if the entire scheme functions as an artificial signi fier that purposely places a two-sided equation in an ambig uous, and perhaps chiastic, equilibrium. Such a view offers insight into how these designs may have been dominated by a complex and almost geometric sense of placement and decorum.</page><page sequence="7">10 Defeated enemy prostrating himself before Ashurnasirpal II, panel 18b, Room B, Northwest Palace of Ashurnasirpal II, Nimrud. The British Museum, London (artwork in the public domain; photograph ? the Trustees of the British Museum) FORMULA AND MEANING IN NEO-ASSYRIAN RELIEF SCULPTURE 75 Coming back to the Northwest Palace of Ashurnasirpal II, we see two relief scenes from the throne room that belong to the second type of encounter scene in the palace. They depict the king and the high-ranking official wearing the headband in association with captured enemy figures (Figs. 6, 10). On the panel immediately neighboring the libation-encounter series, these two principal figures are depicted facing each other more direc?y than in the libation schemes, with a subdued enemy in prostration be tween them. Behind the prostrate enemy figure and the high-ranking official, further captives in tow approach the king in submission. The immediate proximity of this panel to the libation slabs may be taken as an indication that it shares to some extent the condensed formulaic constellation of the libation scenes, with their "place of honor" in the segment of the south wall of the throne room closest to the throne.24 Another difference between these neighboring configura tions is that whereas the high-ranking official is shown with hands clasped in reverence in the libation scenes, he is shown gesticulating toward the king in the scene depicted on the adjacent panel. Again, as a matter of visual decorum, the act of gesticulation was perhaps deemed more appropriate in scenes with the military theme of conquest and its aftermath, the submission. Whereas the king appears holding a bowl in the libation scenes as necessitated by the ritual act in which he is engaged, he is shown with arrows in the prostration scene, again in accordance with the military theme of the latter relief panel. In fact, as noted further below, this alternation between the ritual bowl and arrows is one that becomes the principal semiotic parameter of the relief scenes in Room G, as already marked by M. A. Brandes,25 revisited by other scholars, such as John Russell and Rita Dolce,26 and reconsidered below (Fig. 1). The libation scenes from the throne room of Ashurnasirpal II are further significant in that they incor porate another formulaic configuration that is among the hallmarks of the art of Ashurnasirpal II: the king engaged in a ceremonial act in cooperation with a eunuch whisk bearer (Figs. 7, 8). This formula is also among the building blocks of the relief groups in Room G (dealt with below). The scenes from the throne room are hence loaded in a condensed manner with some of the most fundamental elements that constitute the visual language of the North west Palace. In a way, they provide the viewer with a more natural context for both the bowl and arrows, which appear in a more distinctively artificial and emblematic capacity in Room G. In addition to the prostration scene from the throne room of Ashurnasirpal II (Fig. 10), a second example of this more direct or immediate type of encounter scene is on a panel located further down the south wall of the throne room toward the west, again depicting the king and his high ranking official in a military context, with the former holding arrows and the latter gesticulating, followed by captives in tow, though this time with no figure in between, be it that of a prostrate enemy or a dead animal (Fig. 3). What is new in this scene is the appearance of the Assyrian winged disk, the theocratic Assyrian symbol par excellence, hovering above and between the two figures, clearly testifying to the hieratic nature of this formulaic configuration.27 As a semantic anal ogy to these scenes, one can think of the ancient Egyptian unification scheme and how in it two mythological figures that stand for different aspects of the ideal Egyptian king are shown face-to-face, with an Egyptian theocratic symbol, the hieroglyphic sign for union, at the center (Fig. 2).28 This comparison may provide a clue to indicate that the two figures of the Neo-Assyrian scheme, the king and his royal associate, may also stand for conceptual components of a unified Assyrian kingship. Finally, the third type of encounter scene in the Northwest Palace is the monumental representation found on the fa cade of the throne room facing the inner courtyard of the palace (Fig. 11). In this scene, notwithstanding the military overtones of the act depicted, the high-ranking official wear ing the headband is shown with hands clasped, whereas the king is shown with bow and arrows. This scene is in a way the conflation of the first two types (Figs. 3, 7, 8). We also see in this composition another touch of the hallmark of the Room G scenes, in which the king is flanked by whisk-bearing attendants. This time, rather than the officiating eunuch who faces the king with his whisk, as seen in the libation scenes, invariably visible in the Room G scenes as well (Figs. 7, 8), we see only his counterpart, the whisk bearer located behind the king.</page><page sequence="8">76 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2006 VOLUME LXXXVIII NUMBER 1 D-2 D-3 D-d-1 11 Panels D 2-3, Courtyard D, Northwest Palace of Ashurnasirpal II, Nimrud (reconstruction drawing from Meuszynski, Die Rekonstruktion der Reliefdarstellungen, pi. 5, reproduced by permission) The "Crown Prince" and the "Prince-King" Before leaving the throne room and moving on to the Room G configurations, we should step back and consider the identity and semantics of the high-ranking official figure with the headband. In all of the scenes under consideration, this figure is identical to the king save for his headdress (Fig. 3). However, the king also incorporates this figure's headdress, as he wears an identical band wrapped around his fezlike miter. This composite headdress could be seen as a concep tual equivalent of the Egyptian double crown, with both the miter and the fillet, whereas the junior princely official wears the equivalent of a single crown.29 By this analogy, the figure of the Assyrian king might be thought of as a visual expres sion of a unified king and his junior official as his "un unified" counterpart. In Egyptian mythological representations it is usually Ho rns, the falcon-headed god of light and the perfect savior king, who is shown with the double crown, whereas a figure such as Osiris, god of the netherworld, is more often than not shown with one of the crowns, typically the white crown of Upper Egypt or a derivative thereof, the Atef crown, presum ably the superior of the two crowns (Fig. 12).30 If, as I have suggested, the "encounter scenes" of Ashurnasirpal II can be understood as a formulaic representation of a concept of duality inherent in Assyrian kingship as well, it is probable that the high-ranking official with the headband who appears in the reliefs of Ashurnasirpal II has a more complex status than is visible at first sight. As already indicated, this figure is located in the midst of those members of the royal entourage who seem more "pious" or "sacerdotal," including musicians in Ashurnasirpal's libation scenes, as opposed to the military officials who surround the king on the opposite side (Figs. 7,8). The figure with the headband has been identified by some as the Assyrian crown prince.31 The evidence cited for this identification has usually been a stela carved for Esarhaddon (680-669 BCE) and erected in the site of Zincirli in south eastern Anatolia. The monumental stela depicts the two sons of Esarhaddon, Ashurbanipal, the crown prince designate of Assyria, and Shamash-shum-ukin, that of Babylonia, on the shorter sides of the slab, both facing the dominating figure of King Esarhaddon that occupies the frontal face of the stela (Fig. 13). The left-facing figure, thought to represent Ashur banipal, wears a headband that is identical to that worn by Esarhaddon around his miter, and hence understood as a potential iconographie indication of the Assyrian crown prince figure. Connected with the appointment of the two aforementioned princes as kings of Assyria and Babylonia is a letter addressed to Esarhaddon: What has not been done in heaven, the king, my lord, has done upon earth and shown us: you have girded a son of yours with headband and entrusted him the kingship of Assyria; your eldest son you have put (up) to the kingship in Babylon. You have placed the first on your right, the second on your left side!32 This passage plainly presents a headband as a token associ ated with the future kingship of Assyria. Even though all these testimonials postdate the reign of Ashurnasirpal II, some scholars tend to see the high-ranking figure with the head band as the standard representation of the Assyrian crown prince in all Neo-Assyrian art.33 I will not discuss here the legitimacy of this idea, but I am sympathetic to the identifi cation of this figure as a princely personage of close royal involvement, perhaps more of a conceptual alter-ego figure if not a definitively identifiable official. It is also noteworthy that in the earlier periods of ancient Mesopotamia, kings appointed their sons and daughters as high priests or priest esses to important sacerdotal positions which they themselves did not direcdy occupy. If the figure with the headband is indeed the "crown prince," he might also have a priestiy capacity that complements what the ruler figure represents in "encounter" scenes.34 One way to approach the semantics of this rather enig matic figure may be through examining more closely the concept of the "prince" in Assyrian culture and theocracy, since this figure, as an underling of the king, clearly has a "princely" character. In fact, the notion of a prince, rubctum (or rubu), or "princehood," rubctutum, is crucial to the ar chaic phase of Assyrian sovereignty. The ruler in the Old Assyrian period was referred to as rub?'um, "prince," as op posed to the "standard tide of the south," that is, southern Mesopotamia or Babylonia, lugal/Sarrum, "king."35 The term rub?'um "constituted the general, neutral Old Assyrian word for a human ruler, irrespective of his nationality or the size and importance of his realm."36 The Sumerian counterpart of this word is nun, a term never used as a royal tide.37 Even though rub?'um remained the general tide of the kings of Assur only down to the end of the Middle Assyrian period (ca. 1350-1000 BCE), the concept of a "princely" ruler may not have been eradicated from Assyrian royal rhetoric, and traces of it, both visual and textual, may be found in the Neo Assyrian period as well. Indeed, one of the epithets of the Neo-Assyrian kings in royal inscriptions is still nun, "prince," or nun-? na-a-du, "attentive prince."38 The Assyrian king also invariably held the tide ?sakku (ensik) ASSur, the vice regent of the god</page><page sequence="9">12 Enthroned Osiris, from the rear wall of the upper pillared hall in the tomb of Sety I (1306-1290 BCE), Nineteenth Dynasty, drawing by James Burton. British Library, London FORMULA AND MEANING IN NEO-ASSYRIAN RELIEF SCULPTURE 77 Ashur, another "princely" tide, which was his principal sacer dotal epithet through the Neo-Assyrian period.39 The tide iSSakku/ensik in a way tied the Assyrian king to the political structure of the early city-states of Sumer, where the term may have referred to the ruler's special relation and closeness to the principal god of his city-state.40 It is as if the Assyrian kings, even in their full imperial capacity, always maintained a persistent modesty in relation to the gods, always empha sizing the insuperable distance between the human and the divine. Finally, even in the Neo-Assyrian visual record, we see the king himself depicted in the very princely guise in which the high-ranking official wearing the headband is depicted. Such representations of the king usually occur in scenes of the royal hunt in the arts of both Ashurnasirpal II and Ashurba nipal (Fig. 14). In the North Palace of Ashurbanipal in Nin eveh, in addition to hunting lions on horseback, the king appears with this headdress within the formulaic framework modeled after the design that characterizes the Assyrian royal seal, which depicts the king in face-to-face combat with a lion (Fig. 15). However, whereas on the official royal seal the king is shown with the full regal headdress, in Ashurbanipal's relief scene the king appears wearing only the headband. Clearly, the royal lion hunt or combat was deemed by the Assyrian artist as an appropriate context within which to show the king in his princely appearance, perhaps owing to the princely or sacerdotal notions attached to the royal hunt itself. So far, this particular appearance of the king himself with the headband on Assyrian palace reliefs has not been fully accounted for. Rather than a random instance of variety or a sportive headdress suitable for the dynamic activity of the hunt, it is more likely that there was a semiotic behind the use of this motif in relation to the king as well. This viewpoint is reinforced by one of the formulaic phrases in Assyrian hunt ing texts, which emphasizes a "princely" aspect in the activity of the lion hunt, again with the use of the word rub?'um: ina m?luti rubutiya, "while I was carrying out my princely sport."41 All in all, in the art of Ashurnasirpal II, it is tempting to see the encounter formula as an expression of the extraction of the prince, the rubtium, so integral a component of early Assyrian kingship, from the now all-powerful and unified Assyrian king, the Sarrum (Fig. 3).42 What the artist perhaps</page><page sequence="10">78 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2006 VOLUME LXXXVIII NUMBER 1 13 Stela of Esarhaddon (680-669 BCE), from Zincirli.

Within this setup, however, the part itself seems to have a weight equal to that of the whole against which it is juxtaposed, rather than the two constituting an imbalance. On the stela of Esarhaddon, this duality is expressed in a slighdy different form, by means of both the king and prince depicted in the same context and the duplication of the prince on the two side surfaces of the stela (Fig. 13). The princes here are shown with hands clasped in veneration, as is the figure with the headband in some scenes of Ashurna sirpal's reliefs. The idea of duality ingrained in the stela of Esarhaddon is further enhanced by the depiction of two captives held in check by the king from ropes attached to nose rings. Hence, this monument presents a perfect exam ple of how the Neo-Assyrian artist deployed visual formulas to achieve a hieratic statement in addition to a visual supple ment to a historical record. From this standpoint, it is once again fair to compare the composition of the stela of Esar haddon to ancient Egyptian smiting scenes or, especially, union designs, which depict acts frozen in cosmic time rather than specific historical events.43 As already mentioned above, the two princes depicted on the stela of Esarhaddon are Ashurbanipal and Shamash shum-ukin, the crown prince designate of Assyria and of Babylonia, respectively. After Sennacherib's destruction of Babylon in 689 BCE, Esarhaddon, Sennacherib's successor, launched "carefully calculated, conciliatory moves" to pacify this troubled region.44 In 672 BCE he announced that his son Shamash-shum-ukin would be the future king of Babylonia, 14 Ashurnasirpal II hunting lions, panel WFL 14, Room WG, Northwest Palace of Ashurnasirpal II, Nimrud. The British Museum, London (artwork in the public domain; photograph ? the Trustees of the British Museum) ruling this land subject to his brother, Ashurbanipal, hence consolidating Assyrian control in the area, without denying it a degree of autonomy. The idea of union that may have been communicated on the stela of Esarhaddon may be thought to have a further affinity with the Egyptian notion of the unifi cation of two lands, in that what one sees here is a perennial Mesopotamian idea of a split-a/w-union between two geo graphic areas?Assyria, that is, Northern or Upper Mesopota mia, and Babylonia, that is, Southern or Lower. In fact, such a regional or geographic duality, bordering on an ideological one, had always existed in ancient Mesopotamia. In the third millennium BCE, for instance, the duality Sumer in the south and Akkad, slightly further up north in relation to Sumer, though not as far north as is Assyria, found expression in one of the royal titles adopted by the Sumerian kings of the Ur III period (ca. 2112-2004 BCE), king of Sumer and Akkad (Fig. 4). Both the south, Sumer, and the north, where aspects of Akkadian kingship were more at home, seem to have had different traditions and ideologies of rule, Sumer emphasiz ing the cult and the city-state, whereas Akkad had a more or less Unitarian notion of kingship.45 Later, in the first millennium BCE, the time of the imperial domination of Assyria, a comparable polarization seems to have existed in the duality of Assyria in the north and Baby lonia in the south. Like the older duality Sumer and Akkad, this polarization may also have encompassed a conceptual ethos, in addition to political, perhaps with theological con notations as well. As direct heir to the age-old Sumerian antiquity of the south, Babylonia represented the ultimate cultural and intellectual model for Assyria. As the most am bitious political power in the area, however, Assyria always sought to tie Babylonia to itself politically.46 Thus, even though some of the Neo-Assyrian compositions here under scrutiny, such as the stela of Esarhaddon and Ashurnasirpal's throne room scenes, may ultimately have taken their cues from actual historical incidents or royal ritual practices, the designers of this visual system must have tried to transcend all of these particularities for the sake of a "metaphysical" semi otic, one that may especially have referred to a formulaic and</page><page sequence="11">15 Ashurbanipal hunting lions, panel 13, Room S, North Palace of Ashurbanipal, Nineveh.

It is this semiotic with which especially the art of Ashurnasirpal II is woven. "La Salle dite 'G'" In the Northwest Palace, in addition to the throne room, the spaces that have visual formulas concentrated in their deco rative programs are Rooms G, H, N, and C (Fig. 5). In Room G, what has been referred to as Ashurnasirpal's hieratic rhet oric is maintained through the image of the king alone rather than through the configuration of the encounter formula in which the king stands face-to-face with his "princely" coun terpart. In this manifestation, however, duality is imparted in the images through either placing the king in the midst of "opposites" or reduplicating the image of the king and plac ing him between alternating pairs of antediluvian sages, ap kallus,47 and eunuch officials (Fig. 1). The first instance, the formula that places the king in the midst of "opposites," can be observed on the main panel of Room G, which shows the king enthroned and flanked by whisk-bearing eunuch offi cials (Figs. 1, 16). What I have referred to as the "opposites" in this case are the armed eunuchs wearing swords and carrying bows and arrows, on the one hand, and the com pletely unarmed eunuch who is the king's ceremonial asso ciate, on the other. The unarmed eunuch is further distin guished from the military eunuch by the long scarf he is shown wearing. What we see here may again be the duality of the military and the cultic, or sacerdotal, with the king placed in between. It should be noted that the king is here completely unarmed, and in this case he perhaps inclines closer to the sacerdotal segment than to the military. In fact, if one bisects the com position along the vertical, the line of division passes almost exactly along the royal seat's bovine protome on the right and the ram protome of the whisk held by the military eunuch official behind the king, placing the entire figure of the king inside the left segment with the sacerdotal eunuch and leaving the military eunuchs inside the right segment (Figs. 1, 16). Thus, not only is the composition loaded with meaning, but that meaning is legibly enhanced by the com position's geometry. One can again compare this configuration to Egyptian enthronement or coronation scenes from the New Kingdom, such as the coronation of Ramses II (1290-1224 BCE, Nine teenth Dynasty) from the Hypostyle Hall of the Temple of Amun-Re in Karnak (Fig. 17), or the enthroned Sety I (Nine teenth Dynasty) from his funerary temple in Abydos. In both scenes, the Egyptian king is seated between personified and hieroglyphic representations of the two cosmic counterparts, Upper and Lower Egypt. The female figures seen in the composition are the goddesses Nekhbet of the south or Up per Egypt and Wadjet of the north or Lower Egypt. In both cases the triad is flanked by Horus and Thoth, perhaps standing for unified royal power and sacerdotal authority, respectively.48 As already suggested, while the semiotic aspect of such compositions is very clear in the Egyptian represen tations, it is more subtle and elusive in the Neo-Assyrian visual record. However, a close examination of the reliefs of Ashur nasirpal II reveals the presence of an analogous semiotic in this early phase of Neo-Assyrian art as well. This semiotic can be understood as one that pertains to the complementarity of cosmic opposites, or principles, which may be thought to find expression in the visual rhetoric of kingship in both ancient Egypt and Assyria. The second mode in which this dual rhetoric is expressed in Room G in the Northwest Palace places the image of the king between alternating pairs of antediluvian sages, apkallus, and eunuch officials. Brandes has already noted its presence in the second principal compositional group of Room G,</page><page sequence="12">80 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2006 VOLUME LXXXVIII NUMBER 1 F^fp^* 16 Panels 1-4 (main scene), Room G, Northwest Palace of Ashurnasirpal II, Nimrud. The British Museum, London (artwork in the public domain; photograph ? the Trustees of the British Museum) 17 Coronation of Ramses II (1290-1224 BCE) from the south wall of the Great Hypostyle Hall, Temple of Amun-Re, Karnak, Nineteenth Dynasty (photograph by Georges de Mir? and Valentine de Mir?, from R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz, The Temples of Karnak, trans. Andr? Vanden Broeck [London: Thames and Hudson, 1999], pi. 73) where the king, standing, shows his sacerdotal attribute, the ritual bowl, in the midst of the military eunuchs, and his military attribute, the arrows, in the midst of the apkallus (Fig. 1, G-6-8).49 According to Brandes, the king shows his most "transcendent" aspect in the "immanent" unit of this compo sition defined by the military eunuch officials, and his most "immanent" aspect in the "transcendent" defined by the mythical antediluvian sages.50 The result is a configuration of the yin-yang principle, which again corroborates the pro posed philosophy of geometry permeating the art of Ashur nasirpal II. What Brandes does not elaborate on is the fact that the king also wears a sword in the segment where he holds the ritual bowl, whereas he is depicted without it in the segment where he holds the arrows. Although Brandes mentions the arrangement, he passes over it rather lightly, without under lining how this touch enhances the element of chiasmus that intertwines the parameters of the military and the sacerdotal in the composition. Similarly, the officiating eunuch de picted in cooperation with the king with his whisk in the military segment (at extreme right) also wears a sword, whereas his counterpart in the main audience scene of Room G is shown without it (Fig. 1, top band, second figure from left). What the main panel of Room G achieves in the two distinct divisions of one composition, the second principal composition from the same room achieves by chiastically blending visual attributes belonging to the dialectics of the military and the sacerdotal in two separate units. It is important to note that such instances of chiasmus seem to occur in the ancient Egyptian visual record in asso ciation with the dual rhetoric of kingship as well. For in stance, a door lintel of Amenemhat I (1991-1962 BCE, Twelfth Dynasty) from his pyramid temple in Lisht shows two figures of the king seated back-to-back under the pavilions, with the figure to the left wearing the crown of Upper Egypt and that to the right wearing the crown of Lower Egypt. Facing the latter is the Seth animal, and facing the former was in all likelihood a Horus falcon, as shown restored in the drawing, since that part of the lintel is missing (Fig. 18). In other configurations of similar design, the Horus falcon usu ally faces the king wearing the crown of Lower Egypt, and the Seth animal faces the king wearing the crown of Upper Egypt, as is the case with the representation on the door frame of King Amenemhat-Sobekhotep from Medamud (1759-1630 BCE, Thirteenth Dynasty) (Fig. 19). The door lintel of Amen emhat I has reversed this more usual match, creating a scheme not unlike the one found in the second principal composition of Ashurnasirpal's Room G. Another such Egyptian formulaic representation that re verses elements of the north and south can be seen on a relief from the Temple of Khonsu in Karnak that represents Heri</page><page sequence="13">FORMULA AND MEANING IN NEO-ASSYRIAN RELIEF SCULPTURE gl 18 Lintel of Amenemhat I (1991-1962 BCE) with a represen tation of the enthroned king at the Sed festival, from his pyramid temple at Lisht, Twelfth Dynasty (drawing from Dieter Arnold et al., Temples of Ancient Egypt, fig. 33, ? 1997 Cornell University) hor, the general who assumed royal tides after the death of Ramses XI (1100-1070 BCE) at the end of the Twentieth Dynasty, seated between the two goddesses Wadjet of the north (left) and Nekhbet of the south and the gods Seth (left) and Horus, whereas one would expect that Seth would be behind the goddess of the south, and Horus behind that of the north.51 Finally, chiasmus can be seen even in the coronation scene of Ramses II discussed above (Fig. 17), with Horus, ordinarily standing for Lower Egypt, holding the white crown of Upper Egypt, and Thoth, who may here be replacing Seth in his association with Upper Egypt, holding the red crown of Lower Egypt.52 As demonstrated, such par allel conceptual visual devices were exploited by both the Assyrian and Egyptian artistic idioms in rendering certain hieratic designs concerning a philosophy and metaphysics of royalty. In these chiastic compositions reminiscent of the yin-yang principle, the ultimate message may be a fundamen tal notion regarding the overlap or reconciliation of essen tially opposed dual principles, with a kernel of the one em bedded in the greater body of the other. Architectural Context It is equally rewarding to observe and analyze the emblematic or hieratic reliefs of Ashurnasirpal II such as traced above within their architectural context in the Northwest Palace in Nimrud. For instance, it has been noted time and again that when entering the throne room through gate e from the primary courtyard of the palace, one comes face-to-face with one of the principal hieratic reliefs of the palace on the opposite wall, the so-called "sacred tree" slab (Fig. 5). Then, making a right-angle turn to the left to face the throne, one sees another panel behind it that depicts the "sacred tree" scene (Fig. 20) .53 This right-angle turn has been character ized by scholars as a deliberate evocation of the age-old Sumerian bent-axis temple plan.54 A similar spatial configu ration can be seen in Room G as well (Fig. 5). Although no outstanding emblematic image placed right on the axis of the entrance greets the beholder from the opposite wall when entering the room from the secondary courtyard of the pal ace, courtyard Y, one needs to make a right-angle turn to the left in order to see the audience scene in which the king is depicted enthroned (Figs. 1, 5, 16). Whereas in the throne 19 Monumental door frame of King Amenemhat-Sobekhotep showing the enthroned king at the Sed festival, Medamud, Thirteenth Dynasty (1759-1630 BCE) (drawing from Dieter Arnold et al., Temples of Ancient Egypt, fig. 36, ? 1997 Cornell University) room it is likely that the viewer faced the live king seated on his throne on the turn to the left, in Room G he instead came across his image depicted in the same enthroned position (Figs. 1, 16). Additional spatial relations among the hieratic reliefs of Ashurnasirpal exists. As Dolce has noted, in both the throne room and Room G the main emblematic composition of the room is along the same longitudinal axis with another hier atic composition that appears on the rear wall of a subsidiary room all the way across from these main rooms.55 In the case of Room G (Fig. 5), this subsidiary space is Room N, and the representation that faces the Room G audience scene is one in which the king is depicted in his military incarnation, holding the arrows, placed between the antediluvian sages, the apkallus (Fig. 21). This image differs from the military unit of the second principal compositional group (G-6) of Room G (Fig. 1) in the presence of the sword and the doubled space within which the figure of the king is placed, in contrast to the Room G depiction, which places two fig ures, the king and a sage or eunuch associate, within the same space. Hence, we see in the main emblematic image of Room N the unified military king complete with the sword and arrows, his completeness further enhanced by the dou bled space within which he is shown. In a way, the sword here has found its appropriate location, in contrast to the second compositional group in Room G (G-7-8), where it is associ ated with the king holding only the bowl. The same correspondence between a main and a subsid iary room can be seen in the throne room suite of the Northwest Palace. Here, the auxiliary room that opens up to the main space is Room C (Fig. 5), which displays on its rear wall an image of the king, again in doubled space, this time holding the bowl and wearing the sword (Fig. 22), the exact same configuration in which he is shown in the sacerdotal division of the second principal compositional group of Room G (Fig. 1, G-7-8).56 As is further the case with the latter, the king is also shown between eunuch officials on the Room C panel. The same "unified" king combining both the sacerdotal through the ritual bowl and the military through the sword is depicted twice in Room H, again in the "double-space" for mat, this time between apkallus (Fig. 23, H-8-10, 15-17). In fact, one of these representations in Room H (H-8-10) is again placed prominently on one of the short walls of the</page><page sequence="14">32 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2006 VOLUME LXXXVIII NUMBER 1 ".'J*-*.?~B'-L- ' -* ?* mm k '.tj^***, Irviirv-Tv^' 20 The "sacred tree," panel 21, Room B, Northwest Palace of Ashurnasirpal II, Nimrud.

Room H is further characterized by the total absence of eunuch official groups. Instead, only apkallu groups ap pear, flanking the king in both double- and single-space format. The single-space version constitutes yet another vari ant, depicting the king holding the bowl but not wearing the sword (Fig. 23, H-2, 4). What one perhaps sees in this in stance is the "uncontaminated" sacerdotal appearance of the king, placed between apkallus such that there is now a total match between the frame and its content: the antediluvian sages and the king with the bowl and without the sword respectively, both sacerdotal. Finally, Room S contains as well a hieratic representation placed on the short wall of the longitudinal space on a right-angle turn to the left as one enters the room through doorway e (Fig. 5). As is the case in Rooms C, H, and N, this image depicts the king in "double-space" format, this time, however, with a different attribute. In a change from the other main rooms that display hieratic reliefs, the king, wear ing the sword and flanked by eunuch officials, here appears holding a long staff against the ground line (Fig. 24). The king evidently also appears in this guise on the panels that flank one of the "sacred tree" slabs (B-14) in the throne room, the one that faces the viewer direcdy on the opposite wall on entry from the main courtyard. Whatever the precise 22 Panels 6-8, Room C, Northwest Palace of Ashurnasirpal II, Nimrud (reconstruction drawing from Meuszynski, Die Rekonstruktion der ReliefdarsteUungen, pl. 4, reproduced by permission) connotations of the staff may be, along with the bowl, arrows, and the sword, it is among the visual attributes that constitute the semiotic of the art of Ashurnasirpal II in the Northwest Palace.57 In Room S, Dolce has drawn attention to how the composition on the rear wall of Room T that opens up to Room S is again in axial correspondence with the hieratic scene located on the short wall of the latter (Fig. 5) .58 The Room T composition is rather generic?one of the many slabs that depict the "sacred tree" flanked by apkallus. It is nevertheless situated perfectiy on the axis directed toward the king's image on the Room S panel, the line of symmetry that bisects the tree coinciding with the same axis. One can see from the foregoing visual survey how the art of Ashurnasirpal II is densely but paratactically woven with themes and variations that pertain to what might be under stood as different facets of kingship, especially alternating between, as well as reversing and blending, the military and the sacerdotal, with each attribute of the king acting as a semiotic device in the expression of this complexity. What is more, the function of these images is enhanced and even dictated by the spaces within which they are placed. In fact, when one looks at a plan of the Northwest Palace, one immediately wonders what functional necessity may have stip ulated the oblong rectangular shape that is so predominant (Fig. 5). For all the speculation as to what may have been going on in these spaces,59 litde evidence is available for definitive identifications of activities that may have taken</page><page sequence="15">FORMULA AND MEANING IN NEO-ASSYRIAN RELIEF SCULPTURE g3 23 Panels 1-17, Room H, Northwest Palace of Ashurnasirpal II, Nimrud (reconstruction drawing from Meuszynski, Die Rekonstruktion der Reliefdarstellungen, pl. 11, reproduced by permission) .ewi 'MIS*''9'?-' MPity.r IM ip ?ijttj iglLP1 lili H-17 H-17? ?4e4 place in them. However, one matter is certain: the geometric statement seems to be as important as whatever practical function may have been accommodated in each space. The entire "state-apartment" section of the palace is designed on a quadrilateral basis, with each of the four "blocks" contain ing its own main longitudinal space, enriched and inscribed with the hieratic iconography traced here in a basic fashion. I have in fact dealt with only three of these four quadrants, as there were not many extant reliefs from the so-called West Wing that would lend it to detailed analysis. Nevertheless, the litde that remains of this wing, with its emphasis on the royal lion and bull hunt (Fig. 14), also speaks for a hieratic content that may have furthered and complemented the messages of what is extant from the other wings.60 The palace as a whole is oriented toward the cardinal directions, further betraying its cosmographie scheme (Fig. 5). It is noteworthy that Assyrian astrologists considered the cosmos to comprise four main regions, which they associated with the four countries that formed the four segments of the world: Akkad or Babylonia, Subartu or Assyria, Elam, and Amurru.61 Indeed, one of the epithets of the Assyrian king is kibr?t arbdim, the "King of the Four Quarters," an epithet that goes back to the Akkadian period (2334-2154 BCE).62 In the throne room, the throne is located to the far east, and most of the action on the south wall flows from the east to the west (Fig. 6) .63 This directionality is further enhanced by the god inscribed in the winged disk, who is occasionally shown shoot ing arrows toward the same direction. The entire configura tion betrays a solar scheme, almost making a sun king out of the enthroned Ashurnasirpal II. In fact, the Assyrian winged disk (Fig. 25) was very likely derived from the Egyptian winged disk, which is a solar symbol signaling the path of the sun, mosdy on door lintels, along the east-west axis in Egyp tian temples.64 In sum, the Assyrian palace is first and foremost a physical model of the cosmos and Assyrian theocracy, before it is a utilitarian architectural entity. Given the complex grammar of the reliefs, it is in any event most likely that these state apartments were meant as spaces of display and contempla tion for an "initiated" audience that knew how to look at this</page><page sequence="16">84 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2006 VOLUME LXXXVIII NUMBER 1 il r S-1 S-2 S-3 S-4 S-5 S-b-1 24 Ashurnasirpal II holding a staff, panels 1-5, Room S, Northwest Palace of Ashurnasirpal II, Nimrud (from Paley and Sobolewski, The Reconstruction of the Relief Representations, pi. 2, reproduced by permission of the authors) 25 Assyrian winged disk, detail of panel 21, Room B, Northwest Palace of Ashurnasirpal II, Nimrud. The British Museum, London (artwork in the public domain; photograph by the author) art, in addition to probable solemn ceremonial. Given also the highly sophisticated system of messages inherent in this art, especially in that of Ashurnasirpal II, the audience of the reliefs probably consisted of the royal residents of the palace as well as the Assyrian intellectual or scholarly elite that constituted the king's inner circle.65 The representations thus imbued the spaces with a hieratic aura that direcdy pertained to the theology of kingship developed and guarded by this very elite. The idea that the king combines in himself both the ad ministrative/military and the religious functions of the state and mediates between the divine and human domains is often cited in the scholarship on both ancient Mesopotamian and Egyptian kingship. What the foregoing visual survey dis closes, however, is a rhetoric that goes beyond the thought that the king is a bridge between gods and humanity, one that points rather toward a fundamental duality, or a split between complementary opposites, on the one hand, and a mutual interdependence and reconciliation of these opposites, on the other, within a cosmological framework. The images may be telling us, with their hieratic grammar and geometry, that this dialectic does not necessarily operate on any pragmatic or even ordinary religious level, such as the king's day-to-day administrative and cultic duties, but rather in an emphatically philosophical and, if you will, metaphysical dimension. It is also precisely in this regard that the ancient Egyptian visual and hieroglyphic rhetoric of duality becomes indis pensable to the present discussion, since the cosmological quality of this dichotomy is much clearer in both Egyptian visual culture and the fundamental myth of Egyptian king ship, in which two gods vie for complete sovereignty over the land of Egypt.66 In no Assyrian royal annal can one find direct clues to such an understanding, except perhaps in the way the royal tides may have been deployed, and it is again visual language that has the most immediate power of notation.67 The "sacred tree" panel (Fig. 20) perhaps most potentiy and densely embodies this very fundamental dialectic. The King and the "Sacred Tree" The meaning of this panel (B-21), placed behind the throne base in the throne room of the Northwest Palace of Ashur nasirpal II (Fig. 20), has been the subject of a long-standing debate in Assyriological scholarship.68 The composition has been read as based on bilateral symmetry, with the vertical axis defined by the "tree,"69 but a careful look reveals that although symmetrical, it has many variations on both sides that deviate from perfect mirror symmetry. On the left, the king's raised right hand covers his breast, whereas on the right, his right hand stretches away from his torso, exposing the pectoral of divine symbols on his chest (Figs. 20, 26, 27). The right hand of the king on the left points down slightiy toward the "sacred tree," while the king on the right points up slighdy to the winged disk, within which a god is inscribed, facing and gesticulating toward the king (Fig. 25) .70 The king on the left by no means lacks divine symbols; most simply are not visible behind the raised right arm (one of the stellar medallions can be seen above it, Fig. 27) .71 However, the two armbands with ram protomes worn by the king on the left are nowhere visible on the other king. Although the left arm of the king on the right is wrapped in a shawl, one would expect the other armband to appear if these were indeed two symmetrical images of the same king.

Like the king standing before him, the apkallu on the left wears armbands with ram protomes and has a whetstone with a bovine pro tome tucked in his belt. The apkallu on the right, like the king before him, does not wear anything with a pro tome (Figs. 20, 29, 30). Enough differences exist between the two sides of the "sacred-tree" composition to lead one to think that these actually depict two different images of the king, and perhaps two different images of kingship. With the herbivorous animal protomes and a physical as well as visual association with the tree through the mace, the king on the left seems to be more "earthbound," whereas the king on the right, with his visible pectoral of celestial symbols, his pointing to the winged disk above, the winged god's reaction, facing and gesticulating toward him, and his lack of physical contact with the tree through the mace, is more celestially oriented.73 If Brandes were to comment on this scene, he would designate the king on the left the "terrestrial" and the one on the right the "celestial." He would further ascribe "immanence" to the terrestrial and "transcendence" to the celestial.

Vorderasiatisches Museum, Berlin (artwork in the public domain; photograph provided by the Berlin Vorderasiatisches Museum) propose that the "terrestrial" may stand for transcendence, or "esoteric" kingship, whereas the "celestial" segment for im manence, or "exoteric" kingship. There is in fact an ancient Mesopotamian cosmological formula for the duality of celestial and terrestrial, Sumerian an and ki, and its Akkadian equivalent Samu and ersetu. This bipolar formula, in addition to meaning literally "heaven and earth," also refers to the cosmological duality of heaven and the netherworld.74 It is the netherworld and its affiliated gods, such as the Anunnaki, and to a certain extent the god of the realm of the underground sweet waters, Enki/Ea, that are associated with "esot?rica," rather than the ruler gods of the ancient Mesopotamian and Assyrian pantheons stationed above the netherworld and in the heavens, such as Enlil, Marduk, Ashur, and Anu, who perhaps maintain a more exoteric character as the rulers of the cosmos and patrons of worldly royal power. Moreover, the word Annunaki contains in it the Sumerian logogram nun, meaning prince, rub?um in Akkadian, introduced above in relation to the standard tide of the Assyrian king in the Old Assyrian period. Hence, perhaps the Annunaki, as "esoteric" deities, are princes in "opposition to the towering figure" of the king, lugal, of the gods, Ashur, Marduk, or Enlil.75 This sacerdotal capacity attached to both the Annunaki and Enki, the subterranean gods, as it were, as opposed to the full royal power of the aforementioned ruler gods, is reminiscent of the visual dual ity we have observed above in scenes of encounter between the Assyrian king and his "princely" counterpart. Enki, whose name literally means Lord, en, of the earth or the netherworld, ki, and who is the patron deity of the apkaUvs, is particularly to be seen as the god of gnosis.76 The god himself, or one of his associates, may have been repre sented on a ritual basin from Assur dating to the reign of Sennacherib, now in Berlin. The figure at center, whose "divinity" is ascertained by the horned headdress, is shown holding a vase gushing with water,77 flanked by the apkaUus, this time in their fish-cloaked incarnation (Fig. 31). As al ready mentioned, the realm of Enki is an underground body of sweet water, known as Abzu in Sumerian and Aps? in Akkadian. In traditional Mesopotamian cosmography, this body of water is located underneath the surface of the earth, and yet above the netherworld proper, the true realm of the dead.78 In contrast to the netherworld, which had rather grim associations in ancient Mesopotamia, however, the Aps? was a region of primeval purity and perfection, though lo cated out of sight, in some hidden part of the cosmos, espe cially in relation to the surface of the earth inhabited by humanity. Familiar counterparts or analogues of the realm of the Aps? in some other traditions include the ancient Greek Elysian Fields and the Islands of the Blessed, both of which were located in proximity not only to Okeanos, a cosmic body of water like the Aps?, but also to the infernal regions of Hades in Greco-Roman cosmology.79 In fact, one might go so far as to think of the Aps? as some sort of a terrestrial paradise located "in some normally inaccessible part of the earth, which might become the goal of man's search and, in a literal as well as metaphorical way, the object of his dreams."80 After all, the hero Gilgamesh, in search of "eternal life," dives into the Aps? in order to fetch the plant of immortality.81 In ancient Mesopotamian cosmology, although the Aps? and the netherworld are distinct entities, there were instances in which the two locales were equated or confused with one another.82 It may not be far-fetched to think about the celes tial versus terrestrial duality observed in the "sacred tree" scheme as one that corresponds to the heavens versus the Aps?. Support for this association might come from the apkallus themselves, who, as the associates of Enki/Ea, were also thought to inhabit the Aps? (as discussed below). Their fish-cloaked incarnations, seen on the ritual basin from Assur (Fig. 31), may indeed be seen as an indication that they originally belonged to this watery or "oceanic" realm.83 Fur ther, the apkallus, like the Aps? itself, are referred to as "pure" in ancient texts.84 In putting together the icono graphie syntax of the ritual basin from Assur, which may well be a literal representation of the Aps? proper, with that of the "sacred tree" scheme from the throne room of the Northwest Palace of Ashurnasirpal II (Fig. 20), and considering both against the background of the foregoing discussion, one cannot help but see the important allusion the "sacred tree" itself might be making not only to this ancient Mesopotamian terrestrial realm of purity but also to the god Enki/Ea him self.85 The idea that the Assyrian "sacred tree" may be associated with both the Aps? and Enki/Ea was in fact pointed out time and again in the Assyriological scholarship of the late nine teenth and the first half of the twentieth centuries, though without due emphasis on the ancient Mesopotamian antedi luvian tradition. 86 Ancient Mesopotamian sources give cor</page><page sequence="19">FORMULA AND MEANING IN NEO-ASSYRIAN RELIEF SCULPTURE g7 roboration for this connection. For instance, the poetic texts carved on the clay cylinders of the Neo-Sumerian ruler Gudea of Lagash (ca. 2100 BCE) in commemoration of his rebuilding of the Eninnu, the main temple of the chief deity of the Sumerian city-state of Lagash, Ningirsu, make numer ous unambiguous references to the founding of this temple deep in the Aps?, supplemented with further literary images of certain cosmic trees that grow out of the latter.87 The "sacred tree" may thus be a visual entity associated with an esoteric understanding of kingship in its literally funda mental, "terrestrial," or "subterranean" sense. As already sug gested, the terrestrial character of the tree would then have been direcdy associated with both Enki/Ea and his aquatic domain, the Aps?. By contrast, the winged disk may be thought of as an embodiment of overt or "exoteric" kingship governed by hero or ruler gods, such as Ninurta or Shamash, or gods who are "heads" of pantheons, such as Ashur.88 Whoever the god inscribed in the winged disk may be, he is also shown in the act of extending a ring toward the "celes tial" king (Fig. 25), which may be interpreted as the conferral of divinely sanctioned "temporal power," that is, active worldly rule, on the king, in juxtaposition to "sacerdotal authority," a more passive but steadfast notion of priestiy establishment, embodied by the tree. The existence of other important examples of this motif leads to the conjecture that in ancient Mesopotamian iconog raphy, the conferral of the ring, or the ring and the rod, stands for temporal power imparted to the king by divinities who are patrons of royal power or by gods who belong to the heavens or the upper world rather than the netherworld, such as the sun god Shamash on the stela of Hammurapi, Ishtar in the Investiture of Zimrilim, and the moon god Nanna (Sin) on the stela of Ur-Namma, even though both Shamash and Ishtar are known to travel in the netherworld in ancient Mesopotamian mythology. It is therefore fitting that the god in the Assyrian winged disk, be he Shamash or Ashur, is shown extending the ring to the celestially oriented king located to the right of the "sacred tree" (Fig. 20). Notions of priesthood in relation to kingship are rather complex in the ancient world. For instance, the Assyrian king is essentially the official priest or vice-regent of deities of royal rule, such as Ninurta or Ashur, rather than that of the be hind-the-scenes gods, such as Enki/Ea, even though the latter is mentioned in royal inscriptions. While the priesthood of the Assyrian king is incontestable, it was in all likelihood an elite body of learned scholars who maintained the ideology of sacred kingship and genuine priesthood in Assyria, project ing onto the king the ultimate priestiy status while in fact possessing it themselves. This projection certainly entailed actual priestly duties on the part of the king, but he per formed those duties on behalf of the true sacerdotium.89 In so doing, he took on the rhetoric of exoteric ruler gods, while aspects of the sacerdotium were also blended into that rheto ric. This merger results in the kind of dual semiotic I have traced in the visual record. To recapitulate, on the "sacred tree" panel of Ashurnasir pal II, the ideal king, a combination of the regnum and the sacerdotium, is hence laying claim over both the "esoteric" (ki) and the "exoteric" (an) aspects of the state religion. The ki is embodied by the terrestrial, earthbound tree, while the an is represented by the winged disk. The terrestrial in this case may be understood as the netherworld or the Aps?, inasmuch as the latter is below ground, the "esoteric," whereas the celestial, or the heavens, is the "exoteric," where gods ruling over the mainstream cosmos hold power. Ashurnasirpal's apkallus flanking the "tree," and occasion ally the king himself, are often shown with two objects, re ferred to in ritual texts as the purifier (mulillu) and a bucket (banduddu) (Fig. 20). It has been suggested that Ashurnasir pal's "sacred tree" might be a stylized date palm and that the scene might be depicting an act of pollination, with the cone-shaped object held by the apkallus resembling the male date flower cluster and cones.90 According to this convincing and concrete "pollination" theory, the scene is not intended to depict a real pollination but portrays instead an act of pollination occurring in the divine sphere.91 Without dismissing the pollination theory, I would also emphasize the literal meaning of the word mulillu, purifier, for this is precisely how certain ritual texts refer to the cone-shaped object in their descriptions of figurines of apkal lus to be buried in foundation deposits for magical protective purposes.92 There surely must have been some purificatory function attached to the cone-shaped object, even though the precise nature of this phenomenon may lack as concrete an explanation as that provided by the date palm pollination process. The "pure" nature of both the apkallus and the domain in which they reside, the Aps?, speaks to the likeli hood of this connection.93 The fact that one of the accoutre ments the "pure" apkallus are shown holding should be re ferred to as the "purifier" would be very fitting.94 What one might be encountering in the "sacred tree" design may then be some kind of activity, be it fertilization or purification, that belongs to the special milieu of the Aps?, as well as to the magical expertise of its agents, the apkallus. The apkallus and the king are here depicted perhaps tending to the maintenance and well-being, again be it through fertili zation or purification, of the perfect and pure cosmic order embodied by the tree. It should be noted, however, that the most common representation of the "sacred tree" in the Northwest Palace of Ashurnasirpal II shows the apkallus di rectly flanking the tree, without including images of the king (Fig. 32). In fact, only two relief panels picture the "sacred tree" flanked by the king as well as the apkallus, both in the throne room (Fig. 20). In addition to these two instances of the "sacred tree" composition that incorporate both the apkallus and the king, one other scene from the Northwest Palace of Ashurnasirpal II belongs to the same iconographie milieu. In this composi tion, the king himself is flanked by two apkallus, shown with the purifier, the mulillu, and the bucket, the bandudd? (Fig. 33). Here we may see an incident in which the act of "fertil ization" or "purification" is being directed to the king. The primary purpose of this act may be to impart to the king himself the very qualities embodied by the tree?that is, qualities pertaining to a primordial state of purity?carried out by the apkallus as the agents and "permanent residents" of the Aps?. In other words, what the apkallus are perhaps shown doing in this scene is "alchemically" transforming the human king into a divine primordial man.95 In compositionally and conceptually close ancient Egyp</page><page sequence="20">88 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2006 VOLUME LXXXVIII NUMBER 1 m N i K^imwimi '^mm^ s$T '?^CTW| tetf;i? fc F-e 32 Panels 5-8, Room F, Northwest Palace of Ashurnasirpal II, Nimrud (reconstruction drawing from Paley and Sob?lewski, The Reconstruction of the Relief Representations, pi. 6, reproduced by permission of the authors) 33 Ashurnasirpal II flanked by apkallus, panels 3-4, Room F, Northwest Palace of Ashurnasirpal II, Nimrud.

In ancient Egypt, the scene is understood as a depiction of a lustration ritual, which normally would have been exe cuted over the royal corpse by priests, but which was also thought to be simultaneously performed by the divinities, whom the priests impersonated, in the "other world."96 This formula "was intended as much more than a purification. As evidenced by the Old Kingdom Pyramid Texts, as well as later scenes from tombs and temples, it also provided the recipient with life."97 In other words, "after the ablutions the deceased was endowed with an unearthly and indestructible body, i.e., was reborn as the result of his lustration."98 This special process of purification or transformation con ducted by divine agents on the king, or whomever the king stands for in this situation, may be understood as an instance of initiation, inasmuch as initiation into the mysteries enables the adept to be reborn and become immortal.99 It is hence my argument that the Assyrian "sacred tree," with all its direct and indirect references to the Aps?, the apkallus, and their purity, may be understood as an embodiment of the primor dial state implied by rebirth. From this standpoint, the repet itive use of the "sacred tree" design throughout the North west Palace of Ashurnasirpal II in Nimrud may be thought to 34 The purification of Sety I (1306-1290 BCE), from the Funerary Temple of Sety I, Abydos, Nineteenth Dynasty (artwork in the public domain; photograph by V. de Mestral Combremont, from J?quier, L 'architecture et la d?coration dans l'ancienne Egypt, pi. 24) signal the palace as a model of the primordial cosmos. That is, it was not only the ancient Mesopotamian temple that mim icked the primordial cosmos, with its foundations reaching the Aps?, but also the Assyrian palace, or more specifically, in the present framework, the Northwest Palace of Ashurnasir pal II, with its pronounced emphasis on representations of the "sacred tree" and the apkallus.100 In fact, scholars have already pointed to the notion of "divine world order" or "cosmic order" in relation to the "sacred tree,"101 without, however, elaborating on the nature of this cosmic order. On the basis of the foregoing discussion, I would emphasize that this "world order" should be under stood specifically as the original world order. In ancient Mes opotamian cosmic history, this order vanishes with the myth ical phenomenon of the "Flood," which divides cosmic time into an antediluvian and a postdiluvian period.102 It is to the antediluvian period that the apkallus, along with their special knowledge and magical skills, belong. Further, as the "sacred tree" scene asserts, although this cosmic order has technically vanished with the Flood, it continues its existence, but this continuation is now hidden or in "occultation."103 The Mesopotamian myth of the Flood stands as a bench mark in man's protohistory, constituting a division between a spiritually better-informed age, represented by the antedilu vian sages, and a later age in which this spiritual information is less available and hence in the custody of an exclusive</page><page sequence="21">FORMULA AND MEANING IN NEO-ASSYRIAN RELIEF SCULPTURE 89 35 Sety I with the djed pillar, from the Funerary Temple of Sety I, Abydos, Nineteenth Dynasty (artwork in the public domain; photograph by V. de Mestral-Combremont, from J?quier, Uarchitecture et la d?coration dans l'ancienne Egypt, pl. 22) elite. One of the most popular accounts of decline in the spiritual quality of successive cycles of time in ancient litera ture is Hesiod's "Myth of the Ages," contained in the Works and Days. According to Hesiod, the "golden age" was not eradicated. It was rather "covered," and its inhabitants be came "pure" spirits (daimones hagnoi).104 They continued to populate the earth in occultation, roaming everywhere on earth wrapped in air, invisible but still effective in that they guide mortal men toward true judgment and wisdom.105 The function of the apkallus may be comparable. They literally appear everywhere in Ashurnasirpal's palace, perhaps truly invisible to the real human figures with which they mingle, ensuring that the original world order, the "sacred tree," is well maintained. In sum, I would argue that the interpretation of the notion of order or judgment along these lines is some kind of "esoteric" knowledge, a version of gnosis, which signifies awareness of the true nature of the cosmic system, with a previous order behind the curtain or in the foundations of the present.106 When they flank the "sacred tree," the apkallus are shown tending to the very image of their own vanished order, the sacerdotium proper, or sacred kingship governed by a ruler of the greater netherworld, a figure like Enki or the Egyptian god Osiris, rather than the patron gods of worldly royalty stationed on or above the ground. An analogy from ancient Egypt, the motif of the djed pillar, helps to supply a wider framework. This is a hieroglyphic and iconographie entity in ancient Egyptian visual culture, the word djed referring to the concepts of "stability" and "duration." The pillar was originally an embodiment of Ptah, the chief Memphite god of creation, but it later became that of Osiris.107 Just as the Assyrian sacred tree is tended to by the apkallus and the king, in the Egyptian visual record, the djed pillar is shown erected by the king (Fig. 35) or flanked by Horus and Thoth. Furthermore, just as the Assyrian sacred tree is sometimes surmounted by the winged solar disk, the djed pillar is sometimes surmounted by the 36 Amulet showing the djed pillar surmounted by the solar disk (drawing from Erika Feucht, ?gyptobgische Abhandlungen, vol. 22 [Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz, 1971], fig. 99B) Egyptian solar disk (Fig. 36).108 In the djed pillar scheme, while the solar disk may be thought to stand for the visible sun, the worldly rule, Horus or Re, the pillar itself stands for Osiris and the netherworld. In ancient Egypt, where Osiris represents sacred kingship, Horus, as the earthly rep resentative of Osiris, is in charge of taking care of and ulti mately saving Osiris from occultation. In the ancient Egyptian religion, the descent of the sun god Re to the netherworld and his "union" with Osiris at night is clearly another model for this soteriological process. In ancient Egyptian solar the ology, the main goals of the sun god's descent to the neth erworld are caring for Osiris and sending his enemies to slaughter.109 This union of Re and Osiris in Egyptian solar mythology takes place around the middle of the twelve-hour journey through the night as described in the New Kingdom Books of the Afterlife such as the Amduat and the Book of Gates}10 The twelve hours constituting the nocturnal journey of the sun in ancient Egypt are represented on paintings in the tombs of New Kingdom pharaohs, especially those of the Eighteenth through the Twentieth Dynasties. In the repre sentations of the Amduat, immediately past the midnight hour, the time of "union" and "transformation," the crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt are depicted in conjunction on the three divine ba birds that appear in the seventh hour (Fig. 37). The Book of Gates depicts at the midpoint of the twelve hours of the night Osiris's chamber of judgment, in which Osiris is shown wearing the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt (Fig. 38). The meeting of the two gods, one alive, the other dead, one celestial, the other terrestrial or subterranean, around the midnight hour in the Egyptian netherworld can be understood as the ultimate model for the union of the regnum and the sacerdotium. Throughout the duration of this union, the Lord of the Netherworld, as the unified king, presides over the judgment of the dead. The foregoing comparison of ancient Egyptian and Assyr ian visual and conceptual paradigms pertaining to the solar and the terrestrial suggests that what we see on the "sacred tree" panel is perhaps once again a "mystical" union of com plementary opposites expressed in a cosmological dual vo cabulary by means of the "winged disk" surmounting the</page><page sequence="22">90 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2006 VOLUME LXXXVIII NUMBER 1 37 The conjunction of the crowns of the north and the south on ba birds from the seventh hour of the night in the Amduat, Tomb of Ramses VI (1143-1135 BCE), Twentieth Dynasty (diagram by Mark Hasselriis and Pierre Cl?re, from N. Rambova, ed., The Tomb ofRamesses VI: Texts, Bollingen Series, vol. 40, no. 1 [New York: Pantheon Books, 1954], fig. 80) "sacred tree." This binary rhetoric is further enhanced by the dual manipulation of the royal figure, not only in the "sacred tree" composition per se but also in the Room G scenes examined above. Bilateral Complementarity The conceptual complexities in the art of the Neo-Assyrian Empire that we have traced are also accommodated and presented in its relief sculpture by means of distinctive rep resentational conventions that enhance the semiotic content of the designs under examination. For instance, in addition to the variations on both sides that we have already noted, the "sacred tree" scheme displays the two views or profiles of the same figure, the king, from two different sides on right and left, without constituting mirror-image reversal (Fig. 20). The figure on the right has the appearance of the figure on the left seen from the other profile, with all the variations. This formula is a seminal visual convention throughout Neo-As syrian art, particularly attached to what has been referred to here as hieratic representations. It can be seen, for example, in monumental rock-cut representations of Sennacherib, where the king on the right is always the king on the left turned 180 degrees.111 I should like to name this represen tational convention bilateral complementarity and draw at tention to its persistent and meaningful use within the for mulaic mode of Assyrian figurai representation. This compositional convention can also be seen on the throne base of Shalmaneser III, the son and successor of Ashurnasirpal II, from his throne room in his palace-cwm arsenal, known in current scholarship as Fort Shalmaneser, in Nimrud (Fig. 39). The scene in question in fact decorates the central portion of the throne base, and hence takes pride of place. It depicts an instance of agreement and bonding be tween the Assyrian king, Shalmaneser III, shown to the right, and his Babylonian counterpart, Marduk-zakir-shumi, to the left, after "Shalmaneser suppressed a revolt against [Marduk zakir-shumi] and confirmed his position on the throne of Babylon. It is probable that their 'handshake' was a gesture 38 The Hall of Judgment with the enthroned Osiris, from the Book of Gates, Tomb of Horemheb (1319-1307 BCE), Eighteenth Dynasty (photograph by L. F. Husson, from Rambova, The Tomb of Ramesses VI, fig. 155) well-understood at the time and denoting some degree of homage paid by the ruler of a client state."112 In the central composition of the throne base, both kings are shown in an almost identical fashion, with identical at tributes but different headdresses. If one disregards the head dresses and the handshake, it is again as if these two views belonged to one figure whose image on the left is the image on the right turned 180 degrees, or vice versa. The same treatment is extended to the representations of attendants standing behind both kings. It is important to note here that the visual convention in question may be considered subser vient to the kind of dual royal semiotic that permeates much of the earlier phases of Neo-Assyrian relief sculpture such as already proposed. In this instance, the semiotic is clearly cast within the framework of the royal dichotomy of Assyria and Babylonia, the "two lands" of ancient Mesopotamia in the first millennium BCE, which we have also encountered on the stela of Esarhaddon. Contrary to M. E. L. Mallowan's view quoted above, rather than seeing Babylonia as a "client state," one should observe in this scene how the two kings are depicted in visually equal terms, and how this equality results in a highly emblematic and, indeed, hieratic, design. It al most certainly evokes timeless notions of the two fundamen tal or cosmic principles that are one another's complemen tary counterparts, expressed here in terms of a reconciliation between the kingdoms of Assyria and Babylonia. The bilateral complementarity formula in Neo-Assyrian art displays its most noteworthy example with symmetrically ar ranged figures shown both from the front and from the back, such as some members of the heraldic as well as chiastic groups of lahmus (beneficent and protective deities),113 ugal</page><page sequence="23">FORMULA AND MEANING IN NEO-ASSYRIAN RELIEF SCULPTURE Qj :*5l *&lt;&amp; - 39 Center panel of throne base of Shalmaneser III (858-824 BCE), from Fort Shalmaneser, Nimrud.

Whereas the lion-demons (ugallus) and the Ninurta genii on the left-hand side present frontal torsos with legibly incised nipples, those on the right expose the backs of their torsos, with shoulder blades marked out. The rendition of their clothing further reveals this difference in direction ality. The lahmu figures to the far left and right seem to have been excluded or exempt from this mode of rendition. According to the description of an Assyrian ritual text known as the G?ttertypentext, the ugallu or the lion-demon has the head and ears of a lion and human hands; in his right hand he holds what is referred to as [mu]l.ud.da and in his left a hatchet.116 However, these attributes do not match those illustrated in art, reflecting the general lack of full correlation between text and image in Assyrian visual culture. In art the ugallu is pictured with the ears of a donkey rather than those of a lion. Furthermore, representations from the North Palace of Ashurbanipal in Nineveh show the lion demon with a mace in his left hand and a raised dagger in his right. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the texts specify which attribute is to be held by which hand. In Ashurbani 41 Doorway guardians on a slab from a doorjamb, Room B, North Palace of Ashurbanipal, Nineveh. The British Museum, London (artwork in the public domain; photograph ? the Trustees of the British Museum) pal's reliefs as well, the mace and the dagger, although not the attributes cited in texts, are held by the left and the right hand respectively on both of the seemingly symmetrical ugallu figures. One might then wonder if it was the specific assignment of these attributes to the right and the left hand that dictated the phenomenon of bilateral complementarity in representations of lion-demon groups, as this would have been the natural solution for creating superficial symmetry while preserving the prescribed location of the attributes. It is more likely that the fixed placement of the ugallu s attributes, rather than constituting the sole etiology behind bilateral complementarity, is a natural enhancement of a primarily geometric compositional device.117 When the Assyrian king and other associated human fig ures appear in schemes of bilateral complementarity, their upper bodies are depicted in an almost schematized three quarter view, not fully frontal, as is the case with the lion demons, as well as in ancient Egyptian representational con ventions.

More likely than a touch of playful variety, these configurations betray the hieratic geometry and sense of decorum that the Assyrian artist exer cised. In this regard, the chiasmus and bilateral complemen tarity prevalent in the depictions of such guardian figures in later Neo-Assyrian palaces might be seen as the continuation in another guise of the chiasmus exploited in the Northwest Palace of Ashurnasirpal II. In fact, as if to demonstrate this notion of chiasmus, further representations of ugallus from the North Palace of Ashurbanipal are shown in pairs, to gether rather than separated by doorways, presenting a liter ally chiastic configuration.118 As is often acknowledged, the densely inscribed formulaic vocabulary of the art of Ashurnasirpal II gradually dissolves in the palaces of the Sargonid kings, the Southwest Palace of Sennacherib and the North Palace of Ashurbanipal, both in Nineveh.119 In the latter palaces, one sees instead discrete visual formulas more sparsely allocated within the expanse of relief representations that depict scenes rendered panoram ically, such as Sennacherib's relief series depicting the siege of the Judean city of Lachish and Ashurbanipal's lion hunts, as already mentioned. Between the Sargonid kings, Senna cherib and Ashurbanipal, and Ashurnasirpal II, however, is yet another formulaic scene type worth examining. It is an encounter scene that depicts the king enthroned, rather than standing, a formula that characterizes the art of Tiglath Pileser III in Nimrud. The King Enthroned The art of Tiglath-Pileser III (744-727 BCE) maintains an element of the dense hieratic texture seen in the art of Ashurnasirpal II, in contrast to the innovative panoramic character of the arts of the Sargonid palaces in Nineveh. The reliefs of the Central Palace of Tiglath-Pileser III in Nim rud120 clearly draw on the art of Ashurnasirpal II in some of their configurations, such as the scene depicting the standing king face-to-face with his princely counterpart, a prostrate captive between them (Fig. 42). This scheme in a way con flates the second (Fig. 10) and third types of encounter scene found in the Northwest Palace of Ashurnasirpal II (Fig. 11), 43 Slab showing Tiglath-Pileser III trampling an enemy, Southwest Palace, Nimrud, drawing by A. H. Layard. The British Museum, London, Or. Dr. 3 S.W. 17 (photograph ? the Trustees of the British Museum) with the prostrate subject and the gesticulating princely fig ure of the second type, merged with the fan bearer and the vertically held bow of the third type. One formula from the Central Palace of Tiglath-Pileser III unprecedented in extant Neo-Assyrian art up to this time depicts the king, a long spear in his hand, trampling on an enemy, with a whisk-bearing eunuch behind him (Fig. 43).121 As already mentioned, another innovation in the art of Tig lath-Pileser III later taken up by Sennacherib is the version of the encounter taking place between the enthroned king hold ing the staff and his princely counterpart. The staff is an element employed in the art of Ashurnasirpal II. There are two known examples of this scene type among the reliefs of Tiglath-Pileser III in Nimrud. Both show the king enthroned not only with the staff but also with a flower, another unprec edented royal attribute in Neo-Assyrian palace reliefs (Fig. 44).122 One of these scenes depicts a captive who prostrates him self in front of the king, and the other simply the enthroned king facing the "prince."123 In the latter, the hieratic charac ter of the scene is legibly expressed by means of the astral or divine signs that appear in the upper field and the gesture of veneration performed by the "prince" and his entourage facing the king (Fig. 44). As is the case with the art of Ashurnasirpal II, the "prince" does not clasp his hands in scenes that involve military connotations. Instead, in such scenes, he is shown gesticulating toward the king by raising one of his hands. Moreover, the presence of the royal parasol in this "hieratic" scene, as opposed to others of greater mil itary emphasis (Figs. 42, 43), can once again be thought to provide justification for a more sacerdotal reading of the bull libation scene of Ashurnasirpal II, which features not only the parasol but also a closer encounter between the king and his "princely" counterpart, in contrast to the lion scene, as al ready discussed (Figs. 7,8). I would argue that the various versions of the scene depict ing the enthroned Assyrian king facing his "princely" coun terpart in the art of Tiglath-Pileser III constitute yet another important hieratic formula in Neo-Assyrian art, one also later taken up by Sennacherib.124 Similar encounter scenes be</page><page sequence="25">FORMULA AND MEANING IN NEO-ASSYRIAN RELIEF SCULPTURE 93 44 Slab showing Tiglath-Pileser III enthroned receiving a high ranking official, Central Palace, Nimrud, drawing by A.

Central XVIII (photograph ? the Trustees of the British Museum) tween the enthroned royal figure and an underling can be seen on the orthostat reliefs of the Neo-Hittite states, western neighbors of Assyria. One example, the stela of Bar-rakib from Zincirli, shows the seated king facing a scribe with a combined solar-lunar symbol, the sun disk inscribed in the crescent, in the field above and between the two figures (Fig. 45).125 This celestial symbol can in fact be considered a gloss on the meaning of the scene. With its emphasis on the complementarity of the two major celestial opposites, one belonging to the day and the other to the night sky, the symbol may reflect an analogous complementarity between the royal figure and his scholar-scribe. In addition to these emblematic and semiotic subdeties displayed by Neo-Assyrian art, one may find more general and thematic mythological allusions or references in some of the scenes. For instance, the scene type in which the king is shown trampling the enemy figure (Fig. 43) might contain a reference or allusion to the conquest of the mythical enemy, a monster or a rebel god, which the royal hero god of ancient Mesopotamian mythology subdues by trampling on its neck.126 An example is Anz?, the monstrous opponent of the god Ninurta, with whom the Assyrian king was often identi fied. Ninurta's form of expressing his subjugation of this bird as related in'Sumerian and Akkadian literature is to trample on its neck.127 Such scenes may be rehearsals of this or similar mythical incidents, again translated into an ostensible visual expression of Assyrian political and military affairs. The Lion Hunts of Ashurbanipal The visual formula in the final fruition of Neo-Assyrian art is exemplified by the palace reliefs of Sennacherib and Ashur banipal in the last imperial Assyrian capital, Nineveh. They feature continuity of the picture plane, in which events or actions take place in landscapes over an extended surface, as can be seen in Sennacherib's scenes depicting the transpor tation of the lamassu, the colossal winged bulls that func tioned as guardian figures at Assyrian palace gateways, and the Battie of Til-Tuba (or the River Ulai) series of Ashurba nipal.128 This trend constitutes a significant contrast to Ashurnasirpal's paratactic and densely formulaic scenes that 45 Stela of Bar-rakib from Sam'al (Zincirli), Neo-Hittite, ca. 730 BCE. Vorderasiatisches Museum, Berlin (artwork in the public domain; photograph provided by the Berlin Vorderasiatisches Museum) seem to be suspended outside any indication of space and time. In the reliefs of Sennacherib and Ashurbanipal, the formulaic component is instead emphatically concentrated on mythical figures of Mischwesen, part-animal, part-human mythological beings, exclusively deployed in doorway con texts (Figs. 40, 41), freeing the main relief scenes themselves of overt hieratic and mythological associations.129 However, touches or traces of such formulas are sparsely tucked into these larger and more continuous scenes, as we have already traced (Fig. 15). In such instances, it may be the particular themes of these scenes that lend themselves to the incorpo ration of hieratic formulas. One such theme in the art of Ashurbanipal within which formulas may have been deemed appropriate for placement, aside from representations of gate guardians, is the royal lion hunt. The mythological semantic of the lion hunts of Ashurba nipal has already been emphasized by Chikako Watanabe and Elnathan Weissert.130 Both scholars agree that the hunts may be ritual reenactments of the mythological battle between the royal hero god, be he Marduk/Ashur or Ninurta, and his "monstrous" opponents, Tiamat or Anz? respectively.131 Such battles are often seen as taking place between order and chaos, order being represented by the king and the gods who are patrons of royalty, such as Marduk/Ashur and Ninurta, but matters may not be that simple. It is indeed the case that in such mythical frameworks the representatives of chaos, as dead or defeated divine entities, possess a whole theology and have a venerability about them that carry covert dimensions. When these beings are conquered, defeated, and violated by the hero god, this violation encompasses a degree of sacrilege stemming from the paradoxical venerability attached to these archaic gods, who in mainstream mythological texts are de picted as monsters.132 Thus, when the king hunts and kills lions, he is in a way</page><page sequence="26">94 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2006 VOLUME LXXXVIII NUMBER 1 performing the same mythical sacrilege over the animals. From this perspective, when he performs libation over them?a theme already encountered in the art of Ashurna sirpal II?it signals his expiation for this religious offense. Watanabe points out that . . . the murder of a mythological figure serves as the origin of cultural order that keeps destructive violence away. Such a figure is often a divinity and becomes the source of sacred rites where someone else is sacrificed as a surrogate victim. The role of such a figure is characterized by its dual connotation: on the one hand, he is an object of scorn, gibes and insults, and his guilt must be avenged violently; on the other, he is surrounded by a quasi-religious aura of veneration to become a sort of cult object.133 Watanabe's attempt to place the Mesopotamian situation in a broader context of anthropological theories of sacrifice and "dying gods" overlooks a more evident and specific theology of victimization in ancient Mesopotamia that could be under stood and analyzed without resorting to such theories. Both the divine beings conquered by Marduk/Ashur and Ninurta and the monsters, as well as inanimate or semianimate myth ological beings violated by Gilgamesh and Enkidu, may be seen as examples of an ambivalent phenomenon of victim ization analogous to the state of occultation that character izes the apkallus, the antediluvian sages, addressed above. These beings, too, are on the one hand relegated and ren dered impotent, while on the other still venerable in that they belong to a cosmic primordial time brought to an end by the aggressive superiority of an alternative faction of divinities that became established as leaders of the mainstream pan theon of Mesopotamian religion. The lion hunts of Ashurbanipal therefore can be thought of as the most hieratic component of the entire relief corpus of this king, and as a matter of visual decorum, they may have been deemed by the designers of Ashurbanipal's reliefs as the most appropriate ground in which to incorporate visual for mulas analogous to those seen in the reliefs of Ashurnasirpal II, such as the binary division seen in the libation scene (Fig. 9) and the incorporation of the Assyrian royal seal. At the same time that the dense hieratic texture of the art of Ashurnasirpal II gradually dissolves later in the Neo-Assyr ian period, the palaces' architectural layout changes as well. The tightly quadrilateral arrangement of the "state apart ments" of the Northwest Palace in Nimrud, with one promi nent longitudinal throne room standing out among other spaces with its special iconography (Fig. 5), gradually gives way to more sprawling plans with more than one space re sembling the throne room. In these later palaces, the close directional relation between relief scenes and their architec tural contexts seen in the Northwest Palace in Nimrud also seems to weaken, with relief scenes of a panoramic character taking the upper hand and hieratic formulas being limited to doorways and a number of discrete instances such as the lion hunts of Ashurbanipal. Behind these developments in both architectural design and iconography, one wonders if there was a gradual shift from the religious toward the secular and from the timeless to the more specific.134 For instance, whereas the battle scenes of Ashurnasirpal II in his throne room cannot be easily identified as particular historical battles, a panoramic battle scene in the relief corpus of Ashurbanipal is identified as the Battle of Til-Tuba (or the River Ulai) between the Assyrians and Elamites, although this representation probably does more than record history.135 An analysis of the developments through more than two centuries in Neo-Assyrian relief sculp ture thus demonstrates the art of Ashurnasirpal II as an exceptional instance of a densely encoded and formulaic visual system, which continued to nourish the following phases of Neo-Assyrian art, while the latter in the meantime took on a greater, whether superficially or not, historicizing course of development. The idea of formula, however, was never completely lost in later reliefs. It is fully present in high standards of conception and execution in both the gate guardian groups of the palaces of the Sargonids and the lion hunts of Ashurbanipal. We have seen that there is more to Neo-Assyrian relief iconography than the glorification of the king, the expres sion of Assyrian imperial ideology, historical documentation, or even the idea that the king is a bridge between the human and the divine. In addition to, or beyond, these phenomena, especially in the emblematic manifestation of the art of Ashurnasirpal II, but to a lesser extent in that of some other kings, too, is a highly encoded visual semiotic that refers to fundamental, timeless concepts, be they philosophical or cosmological, expressed through the manipulation of the king's figure and the latter's relation to other figures of officials, animals, and hieratic or cosmic entities such as the "sacred tree" and the "winged disk," all embedded in and reinforced by distinctive Assyrian representational conven tions such as bilateral arrangements with no symmetry, chi asmus, and mainly symmetrical designs that ultimately defy symmetry and rather juxtapose complementary views of the same figure or of two different figures in one composition with respect to a central axis. A sense of history and allusions to or depictions of his torical incidents certainly are present in the iconography of Neo-Assyrian relief sculpture. Yet, above all in the art of Ashurnasirpal II, and in the emblematic representations of some other kings, such as the throne base of Shalmaneser III (Fig. 39) or the stela of Esarhaddon (Fig. 13), though certain scenes and designs may have taken their initial cues from historical incidents, they have managed to make something more universal out of the latter. This principle in fact per meates the "royal" arts of the ancient Near East, as noted here primarily in relation to Assyria and Egypt, going back to their earliest formative times, in which such emblematic formulas constituted the principal medium of conceptual signification. I would hope that analogous lines of approach will extend to the study of the "codes" of the more distinctively "historical" or "historicizing" scenes that remain somewhat outside the obviously emblematic mode dealt with here and their rela tion to the Assyrian historiographie or annalistic tradition as well as to earlier representations of conflict and royal aggres sion in the ancient Near East. Further analogous lines of approach might be extended to the study of the monumental imperial arts of cultures and areas adjacent to Assyria and Mesopotamia within the greater Near East for a more nu anced understanding of ancient Near Eastern philosophies of</page><page sequence="27">FORMULA AND MEANING IN NEO-ASSYRIAN RELIEF SCULPTURE 95 kingship and their expression in artistic and intellectual do mains.

Notes This essay is a revised and expanded version of a part of my doctoral disser tation, "Scribal-Sacerdotal Agency in the Production of the Neo-Assyrian Palace Reliefs: Toward a Hermeneutics of Iconography" (Harvard University, 2003). The project was supervised by Irene Winter, Gloria Ferrari, and Paul Alain Beaulieu. For the current version, I am greatly indebted to two anony mous referees for The Art Bulletin, as well as to A.

I am further grateful to Dominique Coll?n and Beate Salje for facilitating the permission procedures for photograph reproductions at the British Museum and the Berlin Vorderasiatisches Museum, respectively. Last, but not least, I would like to thank Marc Gotlieb and Lory Frankel for many suggestions that helped refine and simplify the final form of the manuscript. 1. On "historical narrative" in Neo-Assyrian palace reliefs, see especially Irene Winter, "Royal Rhetoric and the Development of Historical Nar rative in Neo-Assyrian Reliefs," Studies in Visual Communication 7 (1981): 2-39; John Russell, "Sennacherib's Lachish Narratives," in Narrative and Event in Ancient Art, ed.

More generally on narrative representa tion in Assyrian art, see Julian Reade, "Narrative Composition in As syrian Sculpture," Baghdader Mitteilungen 10 (1979): 52-110. I have avoided lengthy rehearsals and analyses of theories of "narrative" in ancient art, primarily because what is dealt with here not only is al ready fully loaded with its own agenda, but also is so fundamentally different from "narrative" that a juxtaposition would be so sharp as to nullify the advantages that may be gained from setting one phenome non against the backdrop of another. 2. Dominique Coll?n, British Museum: Ancient Near Eastern Art (London: British Museum Press, 1995), 145, fig. 117. The Lachish series of Sennacherib is identified by an epigraph that cites the name of the city. Lachish is not mentioned in the annals of Sennacherib, but exca vations at the site unearthed portions of the massive siege ramp built by the Assyrians. All of this evidence is corroborated by the biblical account of the Assyrian attack on Lachish (II Kings 19:13-14, 17; Isaiah 36:1-2, 37:8).

An up-to-date and focused study of the theology of Assyrian kingship is still missing in Assyriological scholarship. Also lacking is an updated study of ancient Mesopotamian kingship that would build on, or re place, the classic works of Ren? Labat, Le caract?re religieux de la royaut? assyro-babylonienne (Paris: Librairie d'Am?rique et d'Orient, 1939), and Henri Frankfort, Kingship and the Gods: A Study of Ancient Near Eastern Religion as the Integration of Society and Nature (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1948). Some sections of Labat's work are nevertheless still very lucid and informative regarding the "priesthood" of the As syrian king (I7ff.). Though not a study exclusively focused on king ship, Elena Cassin, La splendeur divine: Introduction ? l'?tude de la men talit? m?sopotamienne (Paris: Mouton, 1968), also has sections that explore literary images pertaining to the relation between the king and the supernatural in ancient Mesopotamian texts. For further on the "priesthood" of the Assyrian king, see Mogens Trolle Larsen, The Old Assyrian City-State and Its Colonies, Mesopotamia: Copenhagen Studies in Assyriology, vol. 4 (Copenhagen: Akademisk Forlag, 1976), 11 Off.; and Ursula Magen, Assyrische K?nigdarstellungen, Aspekte der Herr schaft: Eine Typologie, Baghdader Forschungen, vol. 9 (Mainz: P. von Zabern, 1989), 9ff., 65ff. On the learned priestly elite that surrounded the Assyrian king, see especially Simo Parpola's introduction to Letters from Assyrian and Babylonian Scholars, State Archives of Assyria, vol. 10 (Helsinki: Helsinki University Press, 1993), viii-xxxv. On Assyrian state religion centered on the national god Ashur, see Steven Hollo way, ASSur Is King! AsSur Is King! Religion in the Exercise of Power in the Neo-Assyrian Empire (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 2002). 4. Two works that have dealt with this phenomenon are John Baines, "Communication and Display: The Integration of Early Egyptian Art and Writing," Antiquity 63, no. 240 (1989): 417-82; and Holly Pitt man, "Towards an Understanding of the Role of Glyptic Imagery in the Administrative Systems of Pro to-literate Greater Mesopotamia," in Archives before Writing, ed. Piera Feri?lo et al. (Turin: Scriptorium, 1994), 177-205. For further on various aspects of this discussion in both ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt, see Henry George Fischer, L'?c riture et l'art de l'Egypte ancienne (Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1986); Whitney Davis, The Canonical Tradition in Ancient Egyptian Art (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989), esp. 131-33, in which the question is more or less dismissed; and Piotr Michalowski, "Early Mesopotamian Communicative Systems: Art, Literature, and Writing," in Investigating Artistic Environments in the Ancient Near East, ed. Ann C. Gunter (Washington, D.C.: Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, Smithsonian Institution, 1990), 53-69. 5. See Baines, "Communication and Display," 479. On this early Egyp tian emblematic and "iconographie" formulation of ideology and cos mology, see idem, "On the Status and Purposes of Ancient Egyptian Art," Cambridge Archaeological Journal 4, no. 1 (1994): 77. 6. One often-cited example of the recording of such concepts is the Pre Dynastic Egyptian palette of Narmer, ca. 2900 BCE, which displays elements of writing in a limited way, while the representational as pect, especially the fundamental Egyptian visual formula of the king smiting an opponent with a mace, dominates whatever message may be thought to be embedded in the monument. The idea that the pal ette of Narmer depicts a timeless, almost "ritual" act is often acknowl edged by scholars. See, for instance, Orly Goldwasser, From Icon to Met aphor: Studies in the Semiotics of the Hieroglyphs (Fribourg: University Press Fribourg Switzerland, 1995), 11; and Erik Hornung, Idea into Image: Essays on Ancient Egyptian Thought, trans. Elizabeth Bredeck (New York: Timken, 1992), 152. Another monument along these lines may be the ancient Mesopotamian Warka vase from Uruk (modern Warka), dating to the Uruk period, ca. 3000 BCE, which likewise de picts visual themes of fundamental significance featuring the "priest king," along with visual formulas that can also be encountered on contemporary cylinder seals, clearly as elements of a system of visual notation (Pittman, "Towards an Understanding," 180fi\). 7. This aspect of Egyptian art may be referred to as hieroglyphic, as it has been already, for example, by Fischer, L'?criture et l'art de l'Egypt, not because one can "read" the art as if it were a text composed of Egyptian hieroglyphs but rather because such standardized and for mulaic figurai depictions, some of which have overlaps with actual hieroglyphic signs, constituted an iconographie system of visual nota tion. One study that addresses such "hieroglyphic" aspects of Egyptian art, for example, is idem, "Some Emblematic Uses of Hieroglyphs with Particular Reference to an Archaic Ritual Vessel," in Ancient Egypt in the Metropolitan Museum Journal: Volumes 1-11 (1968-1976) (New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1977), 31-49. On further uses of Egyptian hieroglyphic elements in contexts of emblematic representa tion that does not necessarily reproduce language or speech, such as the symbolic designs that typically decorate the base areas of Egyptian temple walls and columns, see John Baines, "Temple Symbolism," Royal Anthropological Institute News, no. 15 (August 1976): 10-15. For a discussion of aspects of this "hieroglyphic" nature of ancient Egyptian art, see also Fischer, "The Ancient Egyptian Attitude towards the Monstrous," in Monsters and Demons in the Ancient and Medieval Worlds: Papers Presented in Honor of Edith Porada, ed. Ann E. Farkas et al. (Mainz: Philipp von Zabern, 1987), 13-26. 8.

Scholarly literature on both topics is extensive, and the focus here is entirely different. Representative studies that have dealt with the "opening of the mouth" ritual are Christopher Walker and Michael B. Dick, "The Induction of the Cult Image in Ancient Mesopotamia: The Mesopotamian mis pi Ritual," 55-122, and David Lorton, "The Theol ogy of Cult Statues in Ancient Egypt," 123-210, both in Born in Heaven, Made on Earth: The Making of the Cult Image in the Ancient Near East, ed. Dick (Winona Lake, Ind.: Eisenbrauns, 1999). On the jour ney of the Mesopotamian sun god at night in the netherworld, see, for instance, Wolfgang Heimpel, "The Sun at Night and the Doors of Heaven in Babylonian Texts," Journal of Cuneiform Studies 39 (1987): 127-51; on the Egyptian solar journey at night in the netherworld, see especially Erik Hornung, The Ancient Egyptian Books of the Afterlife, trans. David Lorton (Ithaca, N.Y: Cornell University Press, 1999). 11. An example of the latter endeavor is Margaret Cool Root, King and Kingship in Achaemenid Art Essays on the Creation and Iconography of Em pire, Acta Iranica, vol. 19 (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1979), in which Meso potamian and Egyptian visual formulas are analyzed in relation to their transmission into Achaemenid Persian visual culture. In my framework, the Egyptian visual formulas in question, notwithstanding</page><page sequence="28">96 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2006 VOLUME LXXXVIII NUMBER 1 their chronological precedence, might not easily be thought of as straightforward antecedents or prototypes for the Neo-Assyrian visual formulas dealt with in the following pages, primarily owing to the dis tinct macrodifferences in configuration and morphology between the visual vocabularies of each culture. However, I would not rule out the likelihood of a highly conceptual exchange of philosophical and icon ographie ideas between this high point of Assyrian culture and an cient Egypt. This question requires further research that goes beyond the present scope. 12. On the moving of the Assyrian capital from Assur to Nimrud, see, for instance, Julian Reade, "Ideology and Propaganda in Assyrian Art," in Power and Propaganda: A Symposium on Ancient Empires, ed. Mogens Trolle Larsen, Mesopotamia: Copenhagen Studies in Assyriology, vol. 7 (Copenhagen: Akademisk Forlag, 1971), 330; J. E. Curtis and J. Reade, eds., Art and Empire Treasures from Assyria in the British Museum (New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1995), 123; Michael Roaf, Cultural Atlas of Mesopotamia and the Ancient Near East (New York: Facts on File, 1996), 160; and Rita Dolce, "Dualit? e realt? virtuale nel Palazzo Nord-Ovest di Ashurnasirpal II a Nimrud," in Contributi e mat? riau di archaeologia orientale VII (1997): Studi in memoria di Henri Frank fort (1897-1954), ed. Paolo Matthiae (Rome: Universit? degli Studi di Roma "La Sapienza," 1997), 142. 13. Beardless male figures in Neo-Assyrian palace reliefs are traditionally identified as eunuchs. According to Julian Reade, the presence of the beard as the traditional distinction between "men" and "eunuchs" is supported by Sir Austen Henri Layard, Albert Ten Eyck Olmstead, and many other scholars. Reade indicates, however, that the pictorial evidence is by itself far from conclusive, as these "eunuchoid" features could simply be a stylistic convention.

The hand-clasping posture is the standard iconographie notation for pious veneration or votive disposition in the visual culture of ancient Mesopotamia, going back to the Early Dynastic period (ca. 2900-2334 BCE). 15.

The symbolism of the lion and the bull as they occur in the art of Ashurnasirpal II deserves a much lengthier treat ment than here provided. Within the confines of the present study, suffice it to draw attention to the fact that it is each animal's respec tive symbolism that may have dictated the slightly different composi tional arrangement in each scene. 19.

The dual nature of the Egyptian king also arises from his embodi ment of two primordial antagonistic gods, Horus and Seth, at the same time (Frankfort, Kingship and the Gods, 21). 29. In fact, in analyzing the component parts of this royal headdress, Samuel Paley assigns a particular meaning to each unit. Given the highly paratactic and formulaic character of Ashurnasirpal's art, it is convincing that even the structure of the royal headdress can be "read." According to Paley, the "fez" or miter stands for the identity of the king as an official, the cone for the martial qualities, and the fillet for "status and lineage."

From the Middle Kingdom on, Osiris is often shown wearing the white crown of Upper Egypt, perhaps indicating his Upper Egyptian origin, and this crown can be seen in the god's iconography through out all later periods. "Another crown closely associated with the god is the so-called Atef Crown?similar to the White Crown but with two side feathers and occasionally with horizontal horns and solar disks attached"; Richard H. Wilkinson, The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt (London: Thames and Hudson, 2003), 121. I have not been able to find in recent Egyptological literature a study concen trating on the semiotic of the royal crowns and their possible cosmo logical associations in the Egyptian visual record. Katja Goebs, "Crowns," in Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt, ed. Donald B. Red ford, 3 vols. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), vol. 1, 321-25, refers neither to this theme nor to a source that focuses primarily on this matter. It seems difficult to map out consistent meaningful pat terns or rules in the use of the royal crowns in the ancient Egyptian visual record. Goebs has a monograph currently in preparation that deals with this complexity. 31. The identity of this figure is a much-debated matter in the study of Assyrian art. I am indebted to an unpublished seminar paper by Amy Gansell, "Identifying the Crown Prince in the Neo-Assyrian Visual Record" (seminar, "Neo-Assyrian Palace Reliefs and Palace Design," Harvard University, Fall 1998), in summarizing the main lines of scholarly discussion in this matter. The proposition was formulated by E. Unger, "Die Darstellung Assurbanipals, des Kr?nprinzen von Assur, und des Schamasch-schumukin, des Kr?nprinzen von Babylon, auf der Stele des Assarhddon aus Sendschirli," Zeitschrift f?r Assyriologie 31 (1918): 237. Unger suggested that the headband with pendant bands with which Ashurbanipal is depicted on Esarhaddon's stela from Zincirli may be indicative of his rank as crown prince. Building on this suggestion, Julian Reade, "Two Slabs from Sennacherib's Palace," Iraq (1967): 47, proposed that this distinctive diadem may be thought to generally identify images of the crown prince in late Assyrian art. Other scholars have identified the individual wearing the headband as the turtannu, a high-ranking Assyrian military official (David Oates, "The Excavations at Nimrud [Kalhu], 1962," Iraq 25 [1963]: 15; and T. A. Madhloom, The Chronology of Neo-Assyrian Art [London: Athlone Press, 1970], 67, 76). The basis for this interpretation was stated by A. Olmstead, History of Assyria (New York: Charles Scribner and Sons, 1923), 105, 108, who suggested that the officials portrayed in proces sion on Assyrian reliefs were arranged in the same ranked succession as they were on the eponym lists. The turtannu appears second on these lists, following the king. 32.

For instance, in the Ur III (ca. 2112-2004 BCE) and Isin (ca. 2017 1763 BCE) periods, the priest of Uruk, en dInanna, who was also un derstood as the spouse of the city-goddess Inanna, was separate from the ruler of Uruk, en Unug^. Thus, while the ruler himself assumed the title ruler of Uruk, he appointed one of his sons as the spouse of the goddess Inanna, and hence as the high priest of Uruk.

The word nun, "prince," also characterizes gods that are somewhat in antithesis to gods who are lugals, "kings." These "princely" divinities are gods such as Enki/Ea, the god of wisdom and the underground sweet waters, and the Anunnaki. On this matter, see J. V. Kinnier Wilson, with Herman Vanstiphout, The Rebel Lands: An Investigation into the Origins of Early Mesopotamian Mythology (Cam bridge: Cambridge University Press, 1976), 34, esp. 35, where the eti ology of the Anunnaki's designation as "princes" is understood as an "opposition to the towering figure of their lugal, or 'king,' a term re served only for the greatest and most powerful among them?such as was Ninurta, the classical 'lugal ud melambi nergal.'" On Enki and his association with esoteric knowledge and the "secrets," see Joan Good nick Westenholz, "Thoughts on Esoteric Knowledge and Secret Lore," in Intellectual Life of the Ancient Near East: Papers Presented at the 43rd Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale, Prague, July 1-5, 1996, ed.

Kuhrt, The Ancient Near East, vol. 2, 579-80. 47. Three principal types of genius occur in Ashurnasirpal's relief pro gram: the bird-headed genius, the human-headed genius with horned crown, and the human-headed genius with headband. All these genii have in fact been identified as antediluvian sages, apkallus in Akka dian. These are mythological beings that correspond to a primordial godlike generation of humanity in existence during a vanished cosmic time, a concept found in several other ancient traditions, such as the Greek and Indie, as well. The apkallus are closely associated with the Mesopotamian god of wisdom Enki/Ea. In Hesiod's "Myth of the Ages," contained in Works and Days 109-200, mention is made of a golden age whose humanity lived like gods. Wlien this age was "cov ered," its inhabitants became "pure" spirits ("daimones hagnoi"), 122, dwelling on earth invisibly. Similarly, the apkallus, as the circle of Enki/Ea, are also referred to as "pure" (ebbu) in literary texts (Erica Reiner, "The Etiological Myth of the 'Seven Sages,'" Orientalia 30 [1961]: 1-11, esp. 9). And, just as Hesiod's pure spirits were covered, the apkallus as well descended to the Aps?, the underground sweet water realm of Enki/Ea, as a result of the new organization of the cosmos by the ruler god Marduk (ibid.). For basic information on the myth and nature of the apkallus, see ibid. For the Indie tradition of the Seven Sages (rishis), see John E. Mitchiner, Traditions of the Seven Rishis (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1982). On the ancient Egyptian counterpart of the same phenomenon of an original and superior cosmic time, known as the "First Time" (sp tpy), see Siegfried Morenz, Egyptian Religion, trans. Ann E. Kepp (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1973), 166ff. A typology of these three kinds of apkallus in Ashurnasirpal's relief program is presented in Russell, "The Program of the Palace," 102; Dieter Kolbe, Die Reliefprogramme religi?s-mytholo gischen Characters in neu-assyrischen Pal?sten: Die Figurentypen, ihre Benen nung und Bedeutung (Bern: Peter D. Lang, 1981), 14-17, where the human apkallu is "Variante A," the bird-headed apkallu "Variante B," and the fish-cloaked apkallu "Variante C"; and F. A. M. Wiggermann, Mesopotamian Protective Spirits: The Ritual Texts, Cuneiform Mono graphs, vol. 1 (Groningen: Styx and PP Publications, 1992), 73-77, where the anthropomorphic apkallu is designated umu-apkallu, the bird-headed apkallu "Bird-apkallu," and the fish-cloaked apkallu "Fish apkallu." 48. For an illustration of the coronation of Sety I from his funerary tem ple in Abydos, see Gay Robins, The Art of Ancient Egypt (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1997), 205. The god Thoth, who may be shown in Egyptian art with the head of an ibis, is the moon god and the scribal god. He is responsible for conducting the interroga tion of the deceased in the afterlife, as well as recording the results of the weighing of the heart, the psychostasis, against the feather of ma'at, the Egyptian concept of the true cosmic order, in the netherworld (Morenz, Egyptian Religion, 46; Wilkinson, The Complete Gods, 215ff.; and Denise Doxey, "Thoth," in Redford, Oxford Encyclopedia, vol. 3, 398-400). Thoth has a clear scribal-sacerdotal dimension, whereas Horus can be thought of as a god of action, standing for royalty in its active or military capacity. He is, after all, the avenger of Osiris, as well as the model divine king to whom all Egyptian rulers are ideolog ically assimilated. Edmund S. Meltzer, "Horus," in Redford, Oxford Encyclopedia, vol. 2, 119-22. 49. Brandes, "La salle dite 'G,'" 151. 50. Ibid.

Vincent Arieh Tobin, "Divine Conflict in the Pyramid Texts," Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt 30 (1993): 93-110, at 100: "Pyra mid Texts 204a speaks of Seth as 'the one who dwells at Nubet, the Lord of Upper Egypt.'" Even though the association of Horus with Lower Egypt and that of Seth with Upper seems to be the "norm," exceptions such as mentioned above may have been more than mere "anomalies." They may rather point toward a complexity that a straightforward expression of the duality of the two lands cannot fully cope with. On the idea that Horus in essence belongs to Lower Egypt, see Alan H. Gardiner, "Horus the Behdetite," Journal of Egyptian Ar chaeology 30 (1944): 23-60, esp. 25. 53.

Ashurnasirpal II is shown holding such a staff on the relief panel carved into his "Banquet stela," on which see M. E. L. Mallowan, Nim rud and Its Remains (London: Collins, 1966), 62ff.; and D. J. Wiseman,</page><page sequence="30">98 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2006 VOLUME LXXXVIII NUMBER 1 "A New Stele of Assur-nasir-pal II," Iraq 14 (1958): 24-44. A similar motif also occurs on the glazed-brick panels of Sargon located in tem ples in the king's city Khorsabad/Dur-Sharrukin. These glazed-brick panels "covered the sides and faces of low platforms which projected at the base of internal courtyard fa?ades, on either side of major en trances"; Irving L. Finkel and Julian Reade, "Assyrian Hieroglyphs," Zeitschrift f?r Assyriologie 85 (1995-96): 244-69, 247. There, a human figure holds a staff exactly as does Ashurnasirpal II in his reliefs. The difference is that the figure on Sargon's glazed-brick panels does not wear the royal headdress, indicating that he probably is not the king. 58. Dolce, "Dualit? e realt?," 149. 59. It has been argued by both Brandes, "La salle dite 'G,'" 147-54, and Russell, "The Program of the Palace," 665ff., that the iconography of Room G might contain clues to its function and use in the palace. 60. Russell, "The Program of the Palace," 665: "The relief decoration in the principal rooms of the west suite was poorly preserved, largely be cause many of its wall slabs had been removed in the seventh century B.C. for use in the nearby palace of Esarhaddon." 61. Labat, Le caract?re religieux, 330. 62. The epithet itself goes back to the pre-Sargonic period, during which only the gods Enlil, the god of the earth, Utu, the sun god, and An, father of the gods, bore it. The Akkadian kings adopted this title as a royal epithet (ibid., 6). 63. One should note, after Winter, "The Program of the Throne-Room," 21, however, that "in only one instance do the king and the action reverse direction. That is in the sequence of slabs B5a to B7a, where the king is shown on foot, leading his chariot toward the left. It is sig nificant that this is not a battle/action scene, but rather an aftermath, and one sees from slab 137a that the destination of this procession is the king's own camp. He is clearly returning to it, with prisoners in tow." Also noteworthy is yet another reversal of orientation, this time in that of the god inscribed in the winged disk on the counterpart panel of the "sacred tree" scene, the less well-preserved panel 13, di rectly facing entrance "e" in the throne room. 64. The winged disk passed from Egypt to Mesopotamia, probably via the Syrians and the Hittites. Black and Green, Gods, Demons and Symbols, s.v. "winged disc," 185. 65. On the scholarly elite that constituted the Assyrian king's "inner cir cle," see Parp?la, introduction to Letters, xivff. Many scholars have as sumed that the Assyrian palace reliefs would also have been visible to foreign dignitaries and tributaries who visited the palace (for exam ple, Irene J. Winter, "Seat of Kingship / 'A Wonder to Behold': Palace as Construct in the Ancient Near East," in "A Special Issue on Pre Modern Islamic Palaces," Ars Orientalis 23 [1993]: 27-55, esp. 31; and Russell, "The Program of the Palace," 663). Even though it is likely that outside visitors had a limited and controlled access to the pal aces, the kind of semiotic traced here would have required the view ers to spend a focused and extended amount of time contemplating the images, which might have been unlikely in the case of such visi tors. The idea of a primarily internal audience for the Assyrian reliefs, but in quite a different capacity from the one here proposed, has also been put forward by Bachelot, "La fonction politique," 116ff. 66. On the mythological conflict and ultimate reconciliation between the Egyptian gods Horus and Seth, and this myth's relation to Egyptian duality and royalty, see Frankfort, Kingship and the Gods, 2Iff.; Gywn J. Griffiths, The Conflict of Horus and Seth: From Egyptian and Classical Sources (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 1960); and Tobin, "Di vine Conflict." For further on ancient Egyptian notions of duality and dual kingship, see Mysliwiec, The Twilight of Ancient Egypt, Iff. 67. One potential source, however, might be the Standard Babylonian Version of The Epic of Gilgamesh, redacted and preserved in "libraries" in the Neo-Assyrian period, in which traces of the royal dichotomy discussed above may be seen in the Gilgamesh-Enkidu conflict and reconciliation. 68. For various interpretations, which are not here rehearsed in detail, see, for instance, Barbara Nevling Porter, "Sacred Trees, Date Palms and the Royal Persona of Ashurnasirpal II," 129-39, esp. 133, and Simo Parp?la, "The Assyrian Tree of Life: Tracing the Origins of Jew ish Monotheism and Greek Philosophy," 161-208, Journal of Near East ern Studies 52 (1993); Parp?la, "The Esoteric Meaning of the Name Gilgamesh," in Prosecky, Intellectual Life, 315-30, esp. 324; and Winter, "Royal Rhetoric," 10. Mariana Giovino has a monograph currently in preparation on this topic, based on her 2004 University of Michigan PhD dissertation, "Interpretations of the 'Assyrian Sacred Tree,' 1894-2004." By the time the present article was completed, this dis sertation was still not available from the University Microfilms to be integrated to the current discussion. 69. See, for instance, Winter, "Royal Rhetoric," 10. 70. Opinions vary as to the identity of this god. According to Black and Green, Gods, Demons and Symbols, s.v. "winged disc," 186, "the disc in Assyria was a symbol of Shamash (Utu), though it has also been attrib uted to Assur or Ninurta." See also Russell, "The Program of the Pal ace," 710. The gesture of pointing with the index finger has been identified as the ub?na tar?su, "with outstretched finger," which was made during prayer (Magen, Assyrische K?nigdarstellungen, 45-54; and Ann Taylor Shafer, "The Carving of an Empire: Neo-Assyrian Monu ments on the Periphery" [PhD diss., Harvard University, 1998], 57 n. 29). The earliest representations of this gesture are from the Middle Assyrian period (ca. 1350-1000 BCE), as can be seen on the well known altar of Tukulti-Ninurta I, on which the king, dressed in the same "priestly" robe, makes the pointing gesture toward what might be the emblem of the Babylonian god of light, Nusku (Shafer, 58). 71. Similar divine symbols also appear in greater prominence around the chest of the figure of the king shown on panel 4 in Room F (Fig. 33). 72. The same configuration can be seen on a glazed brick panel of Shal maneser III in Fort Shalmaneser, the only difference being the ab sence of the "sacred tree" in the middle. For an illustration, see J. E. Reade, "A Glazed-Brick Panel from Nimrud," Iraq 25 (1963): 38-47. 73. One should note, however, that on the other "sacred tree" panel (B 13) in the throne room, the orientation of the god in the winged disk is reversed, with the god now facing and gesticulating toward the "ter restrial" king. See Samuel M. Paley and Richard P. Sobolewski, The Reconstruction of the Relief Representation and Their Positions in the North west-Palace at Kalhu (Nimr?d) II (Mainz: Philipp von Zabern, 1987), pi. 2. 74. The word ersetu in Akkadian is the name both for the earth and earth's surface and for the netherworld. The Sumerian equivalent of this word, ki, mainly means "earth," since another Sumerian logogram, kur, corresponds more direcdy to the concept "netherworld" (Wayne Horowitz, Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography [Winona Lake, Ind.: Eisen brauns, 1998], 272). Nevertheless, examples of ki being equivalent to ersetu as the netherworld occur in bilingual texts (ibid.). In her recent work The Image of the Netherworld in the Sumerian Sources (Bethesda, Md.: CDL Press, 2003), Dina Katz states that most of the Sumerian occurrences of the "bipolar formula an-ki do not point to the nether world but to earth," since the word ki more frequently signifies "neth erworld" from the Old Babylonian period onward and, especially, in later bilinguals (12, 14, 60). In spite of the difficulty of tracing a con sistent semantic value attached to the formula an-ki through the ages in ancient Mesopotamia, for the period under consideration here, it is likely that the pair referred to heaven and the netherworld from a cosmological standpoint. Further evidence for the presence of this cosmic polarity in the royal rhetoric of Ashurnasirpal II can be found in the contemporary status of the god Ninurta, to whom the Assyrian king was closely assimilated. See, for instance, Amar Annus, The God Ninurta in the Mythology and Royal Ideology of Ancient Mesopotamia, State Archives of Assyria Studies, vol. 14 (Helsinki: Neo-Assyrian Text Cor pus Project, 2002), 42. For further on the bipolar formula an and ki in relation to ancient Mesopotamian temples and ziggurats, see D. O. Edzard, "Deep-Rooted Skyscrapers and Bricks: Ancient Mesopotamian Architecture and Its Imagery," in Figurative Language in the Ancient Near East, ed. M. Mindlin et al. (London: School of Oriental and Afri can Studies, University of London, 1987), 15. 75. See Kinnier Wilson, The Rebel Lands, 34-35. 76. On Enki and his association with esoteric knowledge and the "se crets," see Westenholz, "Thoughts on Esoteric Knowledge," 454; and Kramer and Maier, Myths of Enki, 178ff. On the name Enki, see also ibid., 3, where it is indicated that Enki's name may originally have been "En-kur," "Lord Kur," kur being another Sumerian logographic word meaning the netherworld, in addition to meaning "mountain." See also ibid., 180. 77. This vase is known as the "flowing vase" in the study of ancient Meso potamian art, and it is usually understood as a symbol of abundance (Black and Green, Gods, Demons and Symbols, s.v. "vase with streams"). 78. Ibid., s.v. "abzu (aps?)"; on the Apsu, see also Horowitz, Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography, for example, 17, as well as many other references throughout. 79. One of the clearest depictions of this spatial proximity in ancient lit erature is in book 6 of Virgil's Aeneid, where Aeneas enters the neth erworld under the guidance of the Sibyl and passes first through the grim part of this subterranean realm, whence he makes a transition to the "Land of Gladness," or the "Groves of Blessedness" (844ff.). In the "Myth of the Ages" depicted in Hesiod's Works and Days, the zone in which the fourth generation of humanity, the heroes who fought at Troy and Thebes, are placed is referred to as "Islands of the Blessed," located by the banks of the Okeanos (I70ff.). For a basic analysis of classical literary references to such idyllic terrestrial domains, see A. Bartlett Giammatti, The Earthly Paradise and the Renaissance Epic (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1966), 15ff.</page><page sequence="31">FORMULA AND MEANING IN NEO-ASSYRIAN RELIEF SCULPTURE 99 80.

According to the Babyloniaca of Berossos, a third-century BCE priest of Bel-Marduk in Babylon, a fish-man named Oannes emerged at the beginning of time from the sea and taught humanity the arts of civili zation, including the knowledge of letters and sciences and how to found cities, establish temples, introduce laws, and measure land (Stanley Mayer Burstein, The "Babyloniaca" of Berossos [Malibu: Undena Publications, 1978], 6). In fact, a bronze openwork panel from Nim rud also merges a central palmiform tree with a flowing vase flanked by two winged bird-headed griffins, clearly seconding the association here drawn between the "sacred tree" and the Aps? (Curtis and Reade, Art and Empire, 124, fig. 84). 84. Reiner, "The Etiological Myth," 9. 85. Indeed, Irene Winter has also recently drawn attention to an idea sug gested earlier by Edith Porada "that the spirals and curlicues extend ing the tree beyond its trunk represented schematic watercourses." Edith Porada, The Great King, King of Assyria: Assyrian Reliefs in the Met ropolitan Museum of Art (New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1945), 32, cited in Irene Winter, "Ornament and the 'Rhetoric of Abundance' in Assyria," Eretz-Israel: Archaeological, Historical and Geo graphical Studies 27 (2003): 252-64, at 253. 86. The history of this early scholarship has been traced by Giovino, "In terpretations of the 'Assyrian Sacred Tree.'" 87. Cylinder A x 15-16, xx 9-11, xxi 19-22, xxiv 20, xxv 17-19; Dietz Otto Edzard, Gudea and His Dynasty, Royal Inscriptions of Mesopota mia, Early Periods, vol. 3, no. 1 (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1997), 75, 81, 82, 84, 85, respectively. Another example would be a passage from the Poem of Erra in which a mythological mes tree is de scribed as reaching from the lowest earth, the netherworld, to the heaven of Anu, the sky god: "Where is the mesu-tree, the flesh of the gods, the emblem of the King of the Univ[erse] (si-mat $?r gim-[ri\) / the pure tree (is-su el-lu), august hero ([et-lu] si-i-ru), which is becom ing to lordship, / whose roots reach 100 leagues through the vast sea to the depth of the under [world] / whose crown, in the heavens, leans on the Heaven of [Anu]?" (quoted in Horowitz, Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography, 245; see also Luigi Cagni, The Poem of Erra [Malibu: Undena, 1977], 32, 11. 150-53). Notwithstanding aforementioned ref erences to a number of cosmic trees in ancient Mesopotamian texts, I demur from equating or associating the Assyrian "sacred tree" with any particular one of them and propose rather the semantic connec tion of the "sacred tree" with the Aps? in general, and further suggest that one of the clues to the symbolism of the "sacred tree" within the context of the art of Ashurnasirpal II is the ancient Mesopotamian antediluvian tradition itself. 88. Dalley, "The God Salmu," 85; and Black and Green, Gods, Demons and Symbols, s.v. "winged disc." 89. In discussing kingship and priesthood in relation to the Indie tradi tion, Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, Spiritual Authority and Temporal Power in the Indian Theory of Government (New Haven: American Oriental So ciety, 1942), 17 n. 16, writes, "That the King is the Sacrificer and Lord of the Sacrifice does not mean that he normally performs or conducts the rite, but that he is the patron who institutes, pays for and defends the Sacrifice on behalf of his people." Further along these lines (ibid.): "In the same way the King is assimilated to and identified with the Priest for the duration of the nuptial Sacrifice, but, just as in any other Sacrifice, 'becomes again what he really is' when the rite is re linquished, thus returning from divinity to humanity." By the same token, in ancient Egypt, the king was the "effective celebrant of the rites" only in title, "and he was so represented in the bas-reliefs, but in practice he delegated his powers to specialists who from that time on would perform this task in his stead. ... it was in the name of and in place of the reigning sovereign that the priests of Egypt would en sure that the cults were carried out throughout the land on a daily basis." Serge Sauneron, The Priests of Ancient Egypt, trans. David Lorton (Ithaca, N.Y: Cornell University Press, 2000), 32. 90. See especially Porter, "Sacred Trees," 133. According to a 1982 United Nations study of date palm cultivation in the modern Near East and Africa, quoted in ibid., 134, "one common method of polli nating date palms in the Near East is to cut a ripe male flower clus ter, carry it up the female tree, and shake it over the female flowers to fertilize them." Further, "water also plays a role in the process of pollination. When the male flowers have been collected ahead of time, they may grow dry and are then dipped in water to make them less fragile during pollination." 91. Ibid., 137. Porter also quotes two other scholars who have interpreted the meaning of the "sacred tree." Parp?la, "The Assyrian Tree of Life," 167, writes, "Thus if the Tree symbolized the divine world or der, then the king himself represented the realization of that order in man, in other words a true image of God, the Perfect Man" (see also idem, "The Esoteric Meaning," 324). Winter, "Royal Rhetoric," 11, sees the scenes as an "emblem of the provisioning of the land and the role of the king in relation to it." 92. Wiggermann, Mesopotamian Protected Spirits, 14-15, text I, 11. 174-77: "Seven statues of sages of clay you shall mak[e,] / clad in white paste over their uniform; you shall draw fish scales on them / with black paste; in their right hands they shall hold / a cleaner, and in their left hands a bucket" (emphasis added). 93. See, for instance, Gudea, Cylinder A xxiv 20: "The grove (?) (of the House) he let grow on ground pure [ki-sikil] as the Abzu" (Edzard, Gudea and His Dynasty, 84); or verses xxix 1-4 from the same poetic work (ibid., 87): "The seven stones set around the House are such as to take counsel constantly with their master. / Its chapel for funerary offerings is very clean as if cleansed by the Abzu." 94. I would submit this idea notwithstanding the different Akkadian words, though with parallel or identical meaning, used in each case: mulillu (purifier, from ellu, cultically pure or holy) in reference to the cone-shaped object, and ebbu (cultically clean, pure) in reference to the apkallus. The Assyrian Dictionary of the Oriental Institute of the Univer sity of Chicago (Chicago: Oriental Institute, 1958), s.v. "ebbu," "ellu," "mulillu." 95. Parp?la, "The Assyrian Tree of Life," 167, and idem, "The Esoteric Meaning," 324, has also explained the meaning of the "sacred tree" by relating it to the "divine world order," represented by Gilgamesh and the king as "perfect man" (etlu gitm?lu), without, however, a dis tinct emphasis on the Aps? and its semantics. 96. Fischer, "Some Emblematic Uses," 34; and Alyward M. Blackman, "Sacramental Ideas and Usages in Ancient Egypt" (1918), in Gods, Priests and Men: Studies in the Religion ofPharaonic Egypt by Alyward M. Blackman, ed. Alan B. Lloyd (London: Kegan Paul International, 1998), 190. Other scholars have recognized in the scene "an episode in the coronation ceremonies, or at least in a real or imaginative se ries where the royal prerogatives were bestowed or confirmed." Sir Alan Gardiner, "The Baptism of Pharaoh," Journal of Egyptian Archaeol ogy 36 (1950): 6. 97. Fischer, "Some Emblematic Uses," 34. 98. Pyramid Texts 1423-28, quoted in Blackman, "Sacramental Ideas," 189. Gardiner, "The Baptism of Pharaoh," 6, goes so far as to draw an analogy between this ritual and Christian "baptism." In this regard, Gardiner, 7-8, also quotes from a text in Karnak from "the time of Sety I (13 SI), where we read: I purify thee with life and dominion, that thou mayst grow young like thy father Re and make Sed-festival like Atum, being arisen gloriously as prince of joy." It is further noteworthy that the water with which this ablution or lustration purified both the Egyp tian sun god as well as the king is associated with the stream of Nun, the ancient Egyptian primordial waters from which everything arose and out of which the sun comes daily anew, "reborn through the me dium of its waters" (Blackman, "Sacramental Ideas," 183, 192). In fact, Nun may be thought to have an affinity to the ancient Mesopotamian Aps?, since just as the foundations of ancient Mesopotamian temples had a special connection and contact with this cosmic body of water, the Egyptian temple is often thought to make a reference to the so called primordial mound that emerged out of Nun, the primeval ocean, at the beginning of time and became the ground on which the creator god performed his initial act of creation. On Nun as the pri mordial waters, see Morenz, Egyptian Religion, 167ff., I7lff.; on the significance of Nun in Egyptian temple symbolism, see especially Hor nung, Idea into Image, 119. 99. Initiation on a basic level is defined by Mircea Eliade, The Enyclopedia of Religion (New York: Macmillan, 1987), s.v. "initiation," 255, as fol lows: "The term initiation in the most general sense denotes a body of rites and oral teachings whose purpose is to produce a radical modifi cation of the religious and social status of the person to be initiated. In philosophical terms, initiation is equivalent to an ontological muta tion of the existential condition. The novice emerges from his ordeal a totally different being: he has become 'another.'" My use of the term initiation is closer to the "philosophical" segment of this defini tion, more particularly, in the term's classic sense of "signification" in traditional metaphysics. 100. Appearances of the "sacred tree" flanked by apkallus, though not as numerous as Ashurnasirpal's, are also known from many subsequent reigns, such as of Shalmaneser III (see n. 72 above), Tiglath-Pileser</page><page sequence="32">100 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2006 VOLUME LXXXVIII NUMBER 1 Ill, Sargon II, Esarhaddon, Sennacherib, and Ashurbanipal.

The ancient Mesopotamian myth of the Flood is related in two princi pal literary works, the Tablet XI of the Standard Babylonian Version of The Epic of Gilgamesh and The Epic of Atrahasis. For translations, see, for instance, W. G. Lambert and A. R. Millard, Atra-Hasls.

For translations of various versions of The Epic of Gilgamesh, see George, The Epic of Gilgamesh. 103. The idea of the disappearance of the superior magical skills of an an tediluvian humanity is best expressed in The Poem of Erra, in which Marduk, the head deity of the Babylonian pantheon, laments the ab sence of the apkallus from the mainstream cosmos, as they were the experts of fashioning and magically bringing to life a divine statue, which Marduk himself is unable to do: "Where are the seven sages of the Aps?, the pure puradu-?sh, who, just as their lord Ea [Enki], have been endowed with sublime wisdom?" (quoted in Reiner, "The Etio logical Myth," 9). In the same poem, Marduk clearly declares, "I dis patched those (renowned) ummanu(-s2Lges) down into the Apsu: I did not ordain their coming up again / I changed the place of the mesu tree (and) of the elmeSu(-amber) : I did not reveal (the new place) to anybody" (quoted in Cagni, The Poem of Erra, 32, 11. 147-48). 104.

It is usually superficially understood as "truth, justice, and order," but in essence it is nothing but the original order of the cosmos, which is long endangered and needs to be upheld.

The djed was originally associated with Ptah, who was himself termed the "Noble Djed." Through assimi lation and syncretism, the god Ptah came to be equated with the dei ties of the netherworld Sokar and Osiris. By the beginning of the New Kingdom, the djed was the established symbol of Osiris and thought to be a representative of that deity's backbone (ibid.). 108. The analogy between the djed pillar and the Assyrian "sacred tree" was drawn by Sidney Smith, "The Relation of Marduk, Ashur, and Osiris," Journal of Egyptian Archaeology 8 (1922): 41-44, esp. 44. The same anal ogy is stressed by E. O. James, Tree of Life: An Archaeological Study (Lei den: E. J. Brill, 1966), 42, who goes so far as to suggest that they may have had a common origin. Like Smith, James indicates that the tree is closely associated with Ashur. I would like to stress, however, that Ashur/Marduk cannot be considered as Osiris's counterpart in As syria. Given the analogy I have drawn between the tree and a god in occultation, the most tenable candidate in the Assyrian pantheon to match the tree would be Enki/Ea. 109.

The formula nevertheless goes back to rock-cut reliefs, possibly from the Akkadian period, that depict a royal figure trampling over his en emies, such as those from Sar Pol-i Zohab. B?rker-Kl?hn, Altvorderasi atische Bildstelen, vol. 2, nos. 29-33; on the dating of these monuments by various scholars, see ibid., vol. 1, 137-40. 122. Even though this is the first time the motif is encountered in Assyria, it appears earlier in the Levant and Syria, the source for Tiglath Pileser III. The motif is a traditional emblem of royalty in Syria going back to the second millennium BCE. Irene J. Winter, "Art as Evidence for Interaction: Relations between the Assyrian Empire and North Syria," in Mesopotamien und seine Nachbarn: Politische und kulturelle Wech selbeziehungen im Alten Vorderasien vom 4. bis 1. Jahrtausend v. Chr.; XXV Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale, Berlin, ed. Hans-J?rg Nissen and Johannes Renger (Berlin: Dietrich Reimer Verlag, 1982), 366. 123. For the former example, see Barnett and Falkner, The Sculptures of Assur-Nasir-Apli II, pi. XVIII. This very formula can also be seen on the wall paintings in the so-called governor's palace in Til-Barsib, also dated around the reign of Tiglath-Pileser III. F. Thureau-Dangin and Maurice Dunand, Til-Barsib (Paris: Librairie Orientaliste Paul Geuth ner, 1936), pi.

In the art of Sargon II (721-705 BCE) the encounter scene resembles that in the reliefs of Tiglath-Pileser III, with a whisk-bearing eunuch depicted behind the king (Fig. 43). However, in Sargon's art the king is never shown en throned in these scenes. Following rather the model set by Ashurna sirpal II, he is shown standing face-to-face with his "prince." On the relief program of Sargon II in Khorsabad, see Pauline Albenda, The Palace of Sargon, King of Assyria (Paris: ?ditions Recherche sur les Ci vilisations, 1986). 125. Henri Frankfort, The Art and Architecture of the Ancient Orient (1954; reprint, New Haven: Yale University Press, 1970), 304. The Neo-Assyr ian influence on such Neo-Hittite reliefs should be noted; it is espe cially clear on the stela of Bar-rakib in the depiction of furniture, "which to all intents and purposes was Assyrian" (ibid.). For further on Neo-Assyrian influence on the Neo-Hittite states of northern Syria, especially during the reign of Tiglath-Pileser III, see Winter, "Art as Evidence for Interaction," 365ff.; and J. N. Postgate, "The Land of Assur and the Yoke of Assur," World Archaeology 23 (1992): 247-63. 126. Examples include a wide range of heroic acts of conquest directed against monsters and Mischwesen, part-animal, part-human mythologi cal beings, such as related in the Babylonian poem of creation in which Marduk, the new ruler of the cosmos, defeats an army of rebel gods generated by one of the most primordial deities, Tiamat. How ever, it is perhaps the exploits of the god Ninurta directed against a group of bizarre monsters called the Slain Heroes, including Anzii, that are more closely associated with royalty, on account of Ninurta's close connection with Assyrian kingship (Annus, The God Ninurta, 39ff.). On Ninurta's exploits, seejerrold S. Cooper, The Return of Ni nurta to Nippur, an-gim dim-ma, Analecta Orientalia, 52 (Rome: Pontifi cium Institutum Biblicum, 1978), 2; Wilfred G.

The act of trampling on the necks of enemies is a literary trope at tached to the conqueror hero gods in the defeat of their enemies. For instance, verse 10 of the text Rites of EgaSankalamma reads: "The bundle of reeds which one prepares is Bel, treading in the necks of his [-] relentless enemies" (quoted in A. Livingstone, Court Poetry and Literary Miscellanea, State Archives of Assyria, vol. 3 [Helsinki: Hel sinki University Press, 1989], 96). In the Sumerian version of the Anzu story, Enki addresses Ninurta as follows: "Hero! No god among [your] brother gods would have done so. / As for the bird which your mighty weapon has pinioned? / [You will set] your foot upon its neck from now to eternity" ("Ur Excavations, Texts," VI No. 2: 16-18, quoted in Samuel Noah Kramer, "Ninurta's Pride and Punishment," Aula Orien talis 2 (1984): 231-34, esp. 233. 128. For the scenes of the transportation of the lamassu, see Richard D.

For the Battle of Til-Tuba (on the River Ulai) series, see Curtis and Reade, Art and Empire, 74-75, figs. 20-22. 129. It should be noted that a shift of emphasis occurs in the mythical vo cabulary of the Neo-Assyrian palace reliefs, from the ancient Meso potamian antediluvian tradition as represented by the apkallus to the Mischwesen that belong to the army of Tiamat, the archopponent of the Babylonian ruler god Marduk, who is the organizer of the uni verse in the Babylonian poem of cosmogony, Enuma Elish. It is clearly the case that this shift in visual emphasis from apkallu figures to Tiamat's Mischwesen reflects the intense Babylonian politics of both Sennacherib and Ashurbanipal and, more important, the arrival and assimilation of the Babylonian Epic of Creation Enuma Elish to Neo Assyrian culture, especially through the replacement of Marduk with Ashur, the national god of Assyria, as the hero of the poem. See Wil fred George Lambert, "The Assyrian Recension of En?ma Elis," Assy rien im Wandel der Zeiten: XXXIXe Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale, Heidelberg 6.-10. Juli 1992, ed.

See Watanabe, "Symbolism," 441ff., on the lions as surrogates for monsters slain by Ninurta; and Weissert, "Royal Hunt," 349, on the Assyrian king as following the example of Ashur/Marduk and Ishtar in subduing the "mythical hosts of chaos" such as Tiamat. On the as sociation of the Ninurta myth with the royal lion hunt, see also An nus, The God Ninurta, 102ff. 132. In fact, Gudea is known to have honored Ninurta's "Slain Heroes," raising their status to equality with that of the gods. He is further known to have arranged for an offering place, a ki-a-nag, for them in the E-ninnu, the Temple of Ningirsu in Girsu/Lagash, which he re built: "As these are warriors [once] slain [by Ningirsu], he let their mouths be pointed towards the libation place.

The carvings are described in several clay tablets, which enable us to restore the entire decorative scheme in principle. Some of the incidents in the battle are also described in captions cut on the sculptures themselves, but the tablets give addi tional details which help to explain what is happening."</page></plain_text>
