An extensive collection of ancient clay figures gathered in the provinces of Shen-si and Ho-nan during the period from 1908 to 1910 is the basis of the present investigation. As the character of this material gives rise to research of manifold kinds, it has been thought advisable to publish it in two separate parts. Many of the clay statu? ettes which form the nucleus of our study are characterized by the wear of defensive armor, hence this first part is devoted to an inquiry into the history of defensive armor,?a task of great interest, and one which here? tofore has not been attempted. It will be recognized that this subject sheds new light on the ancient culture of China and her relations to other culture zones of Asia. The second part of this publication will deal in detail with the history of clay figures, the practice of interring them, the religious significance underlying the various types, and the culture phase of the nation from which they have emanated. Before embarking on our subject proper, a preliminary question must be decided. It is the tradition of the Chou period that the cuirasses1 employed at that time were manufactured from the hides of two animals designated by the words se (No. 10,298) and si (No. 4218).2 It is imperative to have a clear understanding of what these two animals were in the early antiquity of China. As this problem is still pending, and as a close and coherent investigation of the matter has never been made, I have decided to treat it from the very beginning by means of all accessible methods, with the possible hope of a final solution. The present state of the problem is as follows: Edouard Biot,3 1 "Cuirass" or "cuirbouilly" is the right term for this kind of armor, as these words (like French cuirasse, Italian corazza) go back to Latin coratium ("a breast? plate of leather"), derived from the word corium ("leather"). 2 These figures refer to the numbers of the Chinese characters in the Chinese English Dictionary of H. A. Giles. 3 Le Tcheou-li, ou Rites des Tcheou, Vol. II, p. 507 (Paris, 1851). 73</page><page sequence="4">74 Chinese Clay Figures the ingenious translator of the Chou li, has expressed his opinion in these words: "I translate by buffalo the character si, and by rhinoceros the character se. These two characters1 denote in the Shi king a rhinoceros or a wild buffalo, without the possibility of distinguishing between them. The skin of the rhinoceros being very thick, it seems difficult to believe that it could have been sliced, and that the pieces were sewed together, in order to make cuirasses. In this case the two characters of the text2 would designate here two species of buffalo."3 Palladius, in his Chinese-Russian Dictionary, treats the matter in the opposite way, and renders se by (i) "an animal resembling a wild ox," (2) "Malayan rhi? noceros," and si by "rhinoceros." Couvreur credits the word se first with the latter meaning, secondly with that of bauf sauvage} Chavannes5 has clearly and sensibly expressed the opinion that 1 It should properly read, "words." 2 Referring to the passage of the Chou li where the hide cuirasses are mentioned. 3 In his essay on the Manners of the Ancient Chinese (in Legge, Chinese Classics, Vol. IV, Prolegomena, p. 148), Biot says that "they hunted also herds of deer, of boars, of wild oxen," on which Legge annotates, "These wild oxen would seem to be rhinoceroses." But in his original article (Journal asiatique, 1843, p. 321), Biot has added the following comment: "Le caract?re si est traduit ordinairement par rhino? ceros, et c'est, en effet, son sens actuel. Lacharme a traduit, tantdt bos sylvestris, tant?t rhinoceros. II me semble que les grandes chasses devaient ?tre dirig6es surtout contre des troupeaux de bceufs sauvages ou buffles." The objections raised by Biot in the above passage are not valid; it is certainly possible to slice rhinoceros-hide, and to sew the pieces together. Cuirasses and shields have been made from it, as may be seen from many specimens in the collections of our museums. A shield of rhinoceros hide is illustrated in Plate XXVII. In accordance with the above definition, Biot, likewise in his translation of the Annals of the Bamboo Books (Extrait du Journal asiatique 1841 and 1842, pp. 41, 46), rendered se by "rhinoceros" and si by "bceuf si (rhinoceros)," while Legge (Chinese Classics, Vol. Ill, Prolegomena, pp. 149, 153) in both cases has "rhinoceros." It will be seen in the course of this investigation how Biot's error was caused, and that his opinion is untenable. W. R. Gingell (The Ceremonial Usages of the Chinese, p. 81, London, 1852) treated the two words in a way opposite to that of Biot, translating in the passage of Chou li the term si kia by "rhinoceros-hide armor" and se kia by "wild buffalo's-hide armor." No one of those who from purely philological points of view proposed the rendering "wild buffalo" has ever taken the trouble to raise the question whether anything like wild buffalo exists in China, anciently or in modern times. Bushell (The Stone Drums of the Chou Dynasty, Journal China Branch R. As. Soc, Vol. VIII, 1874, P- J54) was of the opinion that the ancient Chinese hunted the rhinoceros in the low swamps. 4 The passage in Lun yii (xvi, 7) is translated by Couvreur (Les quatre livres, p. 250), " Si un tigre ou un bceuf sauvage s'6chappe de sa cage." Nevertheless in the glossary (p. 664) the^word se is rendered by "rhinoceros." Legge (Chinese Classics, Vol. I, p. 307) translates here "rhinoceros," despite Chu Hi's (undoubtedly wrong) interpretation of se being a ye niu (" wild bull"). In his first edition of Lun yii (which is not accessible to me, but this may be gleaned from Plath, Die Besch?ftigungen der alten Chinesen, p. 56), Legge translated se by "wild ox." In the text of Ming-tse (III, 2, ix, 6), Legge (Classics, Vol. II, p. 281) and Couvreur (I. c, p. 452) are in mutual accord in translating the word si by "rhinoceros," and this is likewise the case with reference to the word se in Li ki, II, 1, in, 40 (Legge in Sacred Books of the East, Vol. XXVII, p. 158; Couvreur, Li ki, Vol. I, p. 181). In Tso chuan, vn, 2, Legge (Classics, Vol. V, p. 289) renders si se by "rhinoceroses and wild bulls." 5 Les Memoires historiques de Se-ma Ts Hen, Vol. Ill, p. 502.</page><page sequence="5">History of the Rhinoceros 75 se niu and si appear to be two different species of rhinoceros. Also G. Deveria1 has translated se and si by "rhinoceros." Bretschneider, both a naturalist and an eminent sinologue, upheld the opinion that the rhinoceros, and goblets made from rhinoceros-horn, are repeatedly mentioned in the Chinese classics, and that the latter has been reputed from time immemorial for its antipoisonous virtues. He refers the saying that rhinoceros-horn cures all poisons, to the Shen-nung pin ts'ao king, attributed by tradition to the mythical Emperor Sh?n-nung, at all events the most ancient Chinese materia medica in existence.2 In the first edition of his Chinese-English Dictionary, Professor Giles, the eminent sinologue at the University of Cambridge, Eng? land, attributed to both se and si the meaning of "rhinoceros," with? out establishing a distinction between the two. In the second edition, however, we read under se (No. 10,298), "A bovine animal, figured as a buffalo with one horn, known as the se niu. Another name for the si 4128; see 8346 for its confusion with the rhinoceros." Under the last named heading it is said that the term si niu is "a bovine animal, figured as a buffalo with a single horn;" with the addition that the traditional "rhinoceros" of foreigners seems to be wholly wrong. Further, the reader is requested to correct No. 4128 si, where the meanings "tapir" and "rhinoceros" had been given. In his "Adver? saria Sinica" (p. 394), Mr. Giles has expounded more in detail the reasons which induced him to make these alterations. The arguments advanced by him are briefly three: 1. The rhinoceros is known to the Chinese as pi kio, "nose-horn." 2. In two passages of Chao Ju-kua (translation of Hirth and Rockhill, pp. 118, 233), rhinoceroses are spoken of as being shot with arrows, while Giles finds it stated in the T%u shu tsi ch'lng that arrows cannot pierce the hide of the rhinoceros. 3.. The si and the se are figured in the latter work as slightly differing 1 Histoire des relations de la Chine avec 1'Annam, p. 88 (Paris, 1880). 2 Chinese Recorder, Vol. VI, 1875, p. 19, and Mediaeval Researches, Vol. I, p. 153. Regarding the materia medica current under the name of Sh6n-nung see Bret schneider (Botanicon Sinicum, pt. 1, pp. 27-32). Bretschneider, though believing that in India the people from time immemorial attribute the same antipoisonous vir? tues to the rhinoceros-horn as the Chinese do, says he cannot believe that the Chinese have borrowed this practice from the Hindu or vice versa. The Hindu conception is not attested by any passage in Sanskrit literature, but only by Ctesias and Aelian who state that drinking-vessels made from the horn of the unicorn safeguard from poison and various diseases. The belief is likewise absent among the Greeks and Ro? mans, in whose records the number of references to rhinoceros-horn is exceedingly small (H. Bl?mner, Technologie und Terminologie der Gewerbe und K?nste, Vol. II, p. 358). There is no evidence that the Chinese notions are due to any stimulus received from outside; they appear, on the contrary, as legitimate offshoots grown on Taoist soil. The Chinese likewise conceived the idea of carving rhinoceros-horn into cups, girdle-plaques, and fanciful ornaments. We shall come back to these various points in detail.

Says Mr. Giles, "The Erh ya says: the latter is like an ox, and the former like a pig, while the Shan hai king speaks of both as occurring in many parts of China. There is thus hopeless confusion, of which perhaps the explana? tion is that a term which originally meant a bovine animal was later on wrongly applied to the rhinoceros." The first argument advanced by Mr. Giles is not admissible as good evidence in the case. "The rhinoceros is known to the Chinese as pi Mo, 1 nose-horn/ and is approximately figured in the T%u shu" By referring to the Chinese cyclopaedia we find, however, that this name with the illustration is extracted from the K%un yii fu shuo. The latter is not the production of a Chinese author, but of the Jesuit Ferdinand Verbiest, born in 1623, and who arrived in China in 1659 and died in 1688.2 This section of the T%u shu tsi ch'tng alluded to by Mr. Giles and devoted to "strange animals' * contains quite a number of illustra? tions and texts derived from the work of Verbiest; and neither his zoological nomenclature nor his descriptions and illustrations, which are based on European lore, can be laid at the door of the Chinese. The evidence is here produced in Figs. 1 and 2. In Fig. 1, Verbiest pictures a "single-horned animal" (tu kio shou), saying, "India, situated on the continent of Asia, is the habitat of the single-horned animal which is as big as a horse, very light and swift, and yellow in color. On its head it has a horn, four to five feet long, of bright color. It is made into drinking-vessels which are capable of neutralizing poison. As the horn is pointed, the animal can charge a big lion. The lion, while struggling with it, takes refuge behind a tree; and when missing its aim, it butts the tree, while the lion bites it at this moment." In Fig. 2, the pi kio shou referred to by Mr. Giles is pictured. Verbiest com? ments, "The locality Kang-pa-ya3 in India, situated on the continent of Asia, is the habitat of an animal called 'nose-horn' [rendering of 'rhi? noceros']. Its body is as powerful as that of the elephant, but its feet are somewhat shorter. Its trunk is covered all over with red and yellow spots, and is overlaid with scales. Arrows cannot pierce it. On its nose there is a single horn as strong as steel. It prepares for its battles with the elephant by whetting its horn on the rocks; and hitting 1 This is a debatable point. The two illustrations do not resemble bovine animals, but deer (see Figs. 9 and 10 on pp. 102 and 103). The "bovine animal with one horn" first appears in Lionel Giles, An Alphabetical Index to the Chinese Encyclopaedia, p. 5 (London, 1911). 2 Wylie, Notes on Chinese Literature, p. 58; M. Courant, Catalogue des livres chinois, p. 95; H. Cordier, L'imprimerie sino-europ6enne en Chine, p. 59; P.

The alleged combats of the rhinoceros with the lion and elephant are classical reminiscences (see p. 84) which are absent from Chinese folk-lore. Verbiest repeats the popular tradi? tions current at his time in Europe, and like Cosmas Indicopleustes, still discriminates between the monoceros or unicornis (tu kio) and the rhinoceros (pi hid), illustrating the former by the unicorn of European heraldry. Consequently the terms employed by Verbiest are literal translations of European nomenclature into Chinese, made by Verbiest for his purpose; and the word pi kio cannot be claimed, as has been done by Mr. Giles, as a genuine term of the Chinese language. It is a foreign term not employed by the Chinese. Indeed, in a long series of Chinese texts dealing with the rhinoceros, and given below, not any use of this name is made. Only a single case is known to me: the Manchu Chinese dictionary TsSng win pu hui of 1786 (Ch. 4, p. 23) explains the Manchu word sufen by the said pi kio, adding the definition, "a strange animal bred in Cambaya in India, like an elephant, with short feet," etc., the same as given by Verbiest. This, accordingly, is a mere repetition of the latter's statement, and is not conclusive. Curiously enough, that expression which Mr. Giles credits as the only authentic word for "rhinoceros" is given a quite different meaning in the Polyglot Dictionary of KHen-lung (Appendix, Ch. 4, p. 75), where we find the series Chin. pi kio shou, Manchu sufen, Tibetan ba-men, Mongol batnin. The Tibet? an word ba-men, reflected in Marco Polo's beyamini,1 denotes the gayal wild ox (Bos gavaeus). Whether this equation, as a matter of fact, is correct, is certainly a debatable question; but this point does not concern us here. The point to be brought out is that pi kio in the sense of "rhinoceros" is a term coined by Verbiest, and that it has not yet been pointed out in any Chinese text prior to his time.2 Simultaneously Mr. Giles's argument directed against Hirth?"the TKu shu expressly 1 See the writer's Chinese Pottery, p. 260, note 4. 2 The general Chinese expression for rhinoceros-horn which is even now traded to Canton and there made into carvings is still si kio; hence it follows that at the present day the designation of the animal itself, as it has been for several millenniums, is the word si. The English and Chinese Standard Dictionary of the Commercial Press, issued by a commission of Chinese scholars, who must know their language, renders the word "rhinoceros" into se niu and se (Vol.,II, p. 1919). Couvreur (Diet, francais-chinois, 2d ed.) has likewise se niu. Doolittle (Hand-Book of the Chinese Language, Vol. I, p. 411) gives under "rhinoceros" si, se niu, and si niu. Schlegel (Nederlandsch-chineesch Woordenboek, Vol. Ill, p. 622) renders the word by se, si, and si niu. True it is that in recent times the words se and si have been transferred to bovine animals, and the Chinese themselves are well aware of this fact. Thus Li Shi-chen, in his Pin ts'ao kang mu, remarks that the term "hairy rhinoceros" is at present referred to the yak (see p. 150). This, however, as will be established by abun? dant evidence, was not the case in former times. In fact, these recent adjustments prove nothing for conditions which obtained in earlier periods. The question as to how the word se became transferred to the buffalo is discussed on p. 161, note 5.</page><page sequence="10">8o Chinese Clay Figures says that arrows cannot pierce the hide of the rhinoceros"? falls to the ground. This is a verdict of Verbiest, and not to be encountered in any Chinese report regarding the rhinoceros. It is, moreover, an argument of no meaning and no value; it is simply a popular notion of fabulous character. The numerous stories formerly current anent the rhinoceros chiefly culminated in thi;ee points,? its ferocity, the use of its horn as a weapon of attack, and its invulnerability. These notions have been refuted by close observation. We quote an authority, R. Lydekker :1 " Fortunate? ly, in spite of stories to the contrary, the creature in its wild state appears, to be of a mild and harmless disposition,2 seeking rather to escape from 1 The Game Animals of India, Burma, Malaya, and Tibet, p. 31 (London, 1907). 2 Certainly; it is easily kept in confinement and tamed, and has often been trans? ported over vast tracts of water and land. A good example of the overland trans? portation of a tamed rhinoceros or several animals is furnished by Se-ma Ts'ien, in the chapter on the Imperial Sacrifices to Heaven and Earth, when this animal together with an elephant was conducted as far as the foot of Mount T'ai in Shan-tung with a possible view to their being sacrificed; but the Emperor spared their lives, and the animals were allowed to return (see Chavannes, Les M?moires historiques de Se-ma Ts'ien, Vol. Ill, p. 502). The following tributes of living rhinoceroses are on record. In the year 2 a.d. the country Huang-chi (south of Tonking, 30,000 li from the capital of China) sent a living rhinoceros as tribute to the Court of China, as mentioned three times in the TsHen Han shu (Ch. 27 b, p. 17b). These texts have recently been studied by Paul Pelliot (T'oung Pao, 1912, pp. 457-460), who has revealed their fundamental importance for the history of Chinese relations with the countries of the Indian Ocean in the first century of our era. On the basis of Pelliot's transla? tions, the country Huang-chi has recently been made the object of an interesting, geographical study on the part of A. Herrmann (Ein alter Seeverkehr zwischen Abessinien und S?d-China bis zum Beginn unserer Zeitrechnung, Zeitschrift der Gesellschaft f?r Erdkunde zu Berlin, 1913, pp. 553~56i). This author identifies Huang-chi with Abyssinia mainly on the ground that the rhinoceros occurs there. This argument is not cogent, since the home of the animal is in all parts of both In dias, Borneo, Java, and Sumatra as well. Also for other reasons this identification is unfortunate. The transportation of a live rhinoceros from Abyssinia to China over a maritime route would have been a feat impossible in those days, in view of the im? perfect state of navigation, while it could easily have been accomplished, if Huang-chi, as assumed by me, was located on the Malayan Peninsula; and as shown by the Chinese records, the live rhinoceroses all hailed from Indo-China or Java. The name Huang chi, moreover, cannot be derived from Agh?zi, as Herrmann thinks. His decisive argument in support of this theory is, of course, the statement in the Chinese text that Huang-chi is 30,000 li distant from Ch'ang-ngan, the then capital of China. Mr. Herrmann unreservedly accepts this as a fact, and is in this manner carried away to eastern Africa. We have known for a long time (in fact, the Jesuits of the eigh? teenth century knew it) that the Chinese definitions of distances over maritime routes must not be taken at their surface value. Nor have we any reason to be more Chinese in this respect than the Chinese themselves. The following is expressly stated in the Sung shu, the History of the Liu Sung Dynasty (420-478 a.d.; Ch. 91): "The southern and south-western barbarians, generally speaking, live to the south and south-west of Kiao-chi (northern Annam), and also inhabit the islands in the great ocean; the distance is about three to five thousand li for those that are nearer, and twenty to thirty thousand li for those that are farther away. When sailing in a. vessel it is difficult to compute the length of the road, and therefore we must recollect that the number of li, given with respect to the barbarians of the outer countries, must not be taken as exact" (see Groeneveldt, in Miscellaneous Papers relating to Indo-China, Vol. I, p. 127). It is plainly indicated in this passage that the distances;</page><page sequence="11">History of the Rhinoceros 81 its enemies by flight than to rout them by attack. When badly wound? ed, or so hustled about by elephants and beaters as to become be? wildered, a rhinoceros will, however, occasionally charge home. In such onslaughts it is the common belief that the animal, like its African cousins, uses its horn as its weapon of offence; but this is an error, the real weapons being the triangular, sharp-pointed low tusks." The same author states in another work1 on the skin of the animal, "Prom the immense thickness and apparent toughness of its enormous folds, it was long considered that the hide of the Indian rhinoceros was bullet? proof, and that the only places where the animal was vulnerable were the joints of the armor. ... As a matter of fact, the skin of the living animal is quite soft, and can readily be penetrated in any place by a bullet, or easily pierced by a hunting knife. When dried it becomes, however, exceedingly hard; and it was formerly employed by the Indian princes in the manufacture of shields for their soldiery." given for the routes in the southern ocean are not exact, and that a description of twenty to thirty thousand li is nothing but a convention to denote the very remote barbarians of the south. Compare, on Chinese calculations of sea-routes, particularly G. Schlegel (T'oung Pao, Vol. Ill, 1892, pp. 161-5). In Hou Han shu (Ch. 116, p. 3 a) the location of Huang-chi is positively indicated as being south of Ji-nan (Ton king), which means that it was situated on the Malayan Peninsula. In 84 a.D. the Man I beyond the boundary of Ji-nan offered to the Court a living rhinoceros and a white pheasant (Hou Han shu, Ch. 116, p. 3 b). In 94 a.d. the tribes in the south? west of Sze-ch'uan sent an envoy and interpreter presenting a rhinoceros and a big elephant (ibid., Ch. 116, p. 8 b). At the time of the Emperor Ling (168-188 a.D.) of the Later Han dynasty, Kiu-cMnin Tonking despatched a living rhinoceros to the Chinese Court (Huan yil ki, and Ta Ming i t'ung chi, ed. of 1461, Ch. 90, fol. 5, where it is said also that at the time of the Yuan dynasty [1260-1367] Annam presented a rhinoceros). In 539 Fu-nan sent a live rhinoceros (Liang shu, Ch. 54, p. 4). A similar report in regard to the country of Ho-ling (Java) occurs in 819 a.D. at the time of the T'ang dynasty (Kiu T'ang shu, Ch. 197, p. 2 b). Finally the poets Yuan Ch&amp;n (779-831; Giles, Biographical Dictionary, p. 964) and Po K?-i have celebrated in verse a tame rhinoceros which had been sent as tribute in the year 796; it was housed in the Shang-lin palace, and an official was appointed to care for it; but in the winter of the following year when great cold set in, the poor creature died. In 1009 Kiao-chi (Annam) presented a tame rhinoceros to the Court (Sung shi, Ch. 489), and there are other similar reports by the essayists of the Sung period.?Tavernier (Travels in India, ed. V. Ball, Vol. I, p. 114) saw a rhinoceros eating stalks of millet presented to it by a small boy; encouraged by this sight, the traveller seized some stalks, and the rhinoceros at once approached him, opening its mouth four or five times; he placed some stalks in it, and when the animal had eaten them, it continued to open its mouth to receive some more. Tame rhinoceroses, to which a good deal of freedom was allowed, were formerly not uncommonly kept by the Rajas of India. Surely, not only men, but also animals, are usually better than their reputation among men. One of the most notable facts about the behavior of the rhinoceros in captivity, as al? ready observed by Darwin (The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestica? tion, Vol. II, p. 165, Murray's edition, 1905), is that under this condition it breeds in India far more readily than the elephant. The captive elephants, in contrast to the rhinoceros, as pointed out by Darwin and confirmed by others (E. Hahn, Kultur? geschichte der Haustiere, p. 37), but very rarely breed; as a rule, they do not even copulate. There is no doubt that the rhinoceros possesses the qualities fitting it for domestication, and that only the lack of promising advantages has prevented man from embarking on such a plan. 1 The New Natural History, Vol. II, pp. 1055-1056.</page><page sequence="12">82 Chinese Clay Figures Naturally the skin of the animal is as soft and sensitive as that of any other living creature, and arrows are certainly painful to it. Only when properly prepared and dried does the skin assume that iron-like hardness which has achieved its reputation and probably caused the fable of its being impenetrable in the live beast. The account of the Arab envoy given in 993 to the Chinese Emperor, that "to capture a rhinoceros, a man with a bow and arrow climbs a big tree, where he watches for the animal until he can shoot and kill it," as narrated by Chao Ju-kua, is entirely trustworthy.1 The fable lies entirely in the "arrows cannot pierce the hide," to which Mr. Giles gives credence. When it is said, "he rips up a man with his horn," Chao Ju-kua simply accepts the belief of all his contemporaries, eastern and western; and the remark certainly proves that he speaks of the rhinoceros, while it is no argument in favor of Mr. Giles's opinion that the animal in question is not the rhinoceros. While the general result at which Mr. Giles has arrived is not novel, being partly anticipated, as we have seen, by Biot, Palladius, and Couvreur, his arguments, as summed up above under No. 3, are original, and deserve serious consideration and discussion. What appears to Mr. Giles as the most weighty evidence in favor of his view are the queer Chinese illustrations of the two animals. Queer they are, but we must make an attempt at understanding and explaining them. For this reason, we shall first enter on a somewhat lengthy digression into the iconography of the rhinoceros; and it will be seen that this, as every 1 The effect of arrows on the rhinoceros is well illustrated in the following story of Gaspar Correa, who went to India in 1512, and wrote a detailed chronicle of the Portuguese possessions there. He describes a battle of King Cacandar, who availed himself of elephants fighting with swords upon their tusks, and in front of them were arrayed eighty rhinoceroses (ganqlas) "carrying on their horns three-pronged iron weapons with which they fought very stoutly . . . and the Mogors with their arrows made a great discharge, wounding many of the elephants and the gandast which as they felt the arrows, turned and fled, breaking up the battles" . . . (quoted by Yule and Burnell, Hobson-Jobson, p. 363). In India rhinoceroses were hunted with sabre, lance, and arrows. Timur killed on the frontier of Kashmir several rhi? noceroses with sabre and lances, although this animal has such a hard skin that it can be pierced only by extraordinary efforts (Petis de la Croix, Histoire de Timur Bee, Vol. Ill, p. 159, quoted by Yule and Burnell, Hobson-Jobson, p. 762). In Baber's Memoirs (quoted ibid.) a rhinoceros-hunt is described in these words: "A she rhinoceros, that had whelps, came out, and fled along the plain; many arrows were shot at her, but . . . she gained cover.'^ The hunters of Java hide sickle-shaped knives under the moss on steep mountain-paths; the animal, dragging its paunch almost close to the ground, rips up itself, and is then easily mastered (P. J. Veth, Java, Vol. Ill, p. 289, Haarlem, 1903). Hose and McDougall (The Pagan Tribes of Borneo, Vol. I, p. 145, London, 1912) have this observation to report: "Punans, who hunt without dogs (which in fact they do not possess), will lie in wait for the rhinoceros beside the track, along which he comes to his daily mud-bath, and drive a spear into his flank or shoulder; then, after hastily retiring, they track him through the jungle, until they come upon him again, and find an opportunity of driving in another spear or a poisoned dart through some weak spot of his armor."</page><page sequence="13">History of the Rhinoceros 83 thing else connected with the animal, is an attractive subject of great culture-historical interest. It should be stated at the outset that the Chinese sketches pointed out by Mr. Giles, and other Chinese illustra? tions as well, can never have been intended for any bovines, whatever the alleged bovine character in the animal may be; for there is in this world no bovine animal with a single horn and three toes which, as will be shown, appear in the early Chinese definition, and are plainly out? lined in the sketch of the rhinoceros said in the Erh ya to be of hog-like appearance (Fig. 6).1 The single horn and the three toes, however, are thoroughly characteristic of the rhinoceros, and of this animal exclusively. But we are first going to study the psychology of the case. On the first day of May of the year 1515 the first live rhinoceros was brought to modern Europe from India by Portuguese, and presented to King Emanuel of Portugal.2 In commemoration of this event, Albrecht D?rer, who took a deep interest in exotic animals and people, sketched in the same year a likeness of this rhinoceros, published as a wood engraving, with a somewhat lengthy description in German. D?rer's original drawing is still preserved in the British Museum (Plate IX).3 It is so weak that, as already pointed out by Dr. Parsons,4 the first serious 1 See likewise Fig. 9, p. 102. 2 The history of this event is narrated in the Decadas de Asia of J. de Barros (quoted by Yule and Burnell, Hobson-Jobson, p. 363): "And in return for many rich presents which this Diogo Fernandez carried to the King, and besides others which the King sent to Aflonso Alboquerque, there was an animal, the biggest which Nature has created after the elephant, and the great ?nemy of the latter . . . which the natives of the land of Cambaya, whence this one came, call Ganda, and the Greeks and Latins Rhinoceros. And Affonso d'Alboquerque sent this to the King Don Man? uel, and it cfame to this Kingdom, and it was afterwards lost on its way to Rome, when the King sent it as a present to the Pope." 31 am indebted to Mr. Laurence Binyon of the British Museum for his courtesy in favoring me with a copy of this wood-engraving, from which our reproduction is made. The particulars of the history of this engraving are discussed by C. Dodgson (Catalogue of Early German and Flemish Woodcuts in the British Museum, Vol. I, p. 307, London, 1903). 4 Die nat?rliche Historie des Nashorns, welche von Doctor Parsons in einem Schreiben an Martin Folkes, Rittern und Pr?sidenten der K?niglich-Englischen Societ?t abgefasset, mit zuverl?ssigen Abbildungen versehen, und aus dem Englischen in das Deutsche ?bersezet worden von Doctor Georg Leonhart Huth, N?rnberg, bey Stein und Raspe, 1747. The English original of this interesting pamphlet of 16 pages in quarto is not known to me. It is accompanied by three plates engraved on copper representing the first fairly exact figures of the rhinoceros in various views, its horn and other organs of its body. An anonymous copper-engraving was pub? lished in 1748 under the title, "Vera effigies Rhinocerotis qui in Asia, et quidem in terris Mogolis Magni in regione Assam captus et anno 1741 tertio aetatis anno a capitano Douvemont van der Meer ex Bengala in Belgium translates est." This rhinoceros, a three years old animal, was exhibited in Holland in 1741, and styled on the placards the behemoth of the Bible (Job, 40) and the unicorn of mediaeval times. It proved an overwhelming sensation. In 1747 it made its appearance at Leipzig where Gellert set it a literary monument in the poem with the beginning, "In order to behold the rhinoceros, I was told by my friend, I resolved to stroll out." In</page><page sequence="14">84 Chinese Clay Figures student of the anatomy of the rhinoceros, it is impossible to assume that he had ever seen the animal. This fact is quite certain, for it is known that the King of Portugal despatched the animal to the Pope, and that it was drowned off Genova when the vessel on board which it was being carried was foundered. The only supposition that remains, therefore, is that some one of Lisbon near King Emanuel must have sent on to D?rer a rough outline-sketch of the novel and curious creature, which was im? proved and somewhat adorned by the great artist. But to what sources did he turn for information on the subject? Naturally to that fountain head from which all knowledge was drawn during that period, the au? thors of classical antiquity. The fact that D?rer really followed this procedure is evidenced by the very de? scription of the animal, which he added to his sketch, and in which he reiterates the story of the ancients regarding the eter? nal enmity and struggle of rhinoceros and elephant.1 The most curious feature FlG' 3* about Durer's rhinoceros is Marble Relief of Two-Horned Rhinoceros in Pompeii . (from O. Keller, Antike Tierwelt). that, besides the hOIH On 1748 it reached Augsburg where Johann Ridinger made a drawing and etching of it with the title as stated (L. Reinhardt, Kulturgeschichte der Nutztiere, p. 751, M?nchen, 1912). The rhinoceros is a subject which for obvious reasons has seldom tempted an artist. It should be emphasized that no artist has ever made even a tolerably good sketch of it, and that only photography has done it full justice. 1 According to the tales of the ancients, the feuds between the two animals were fought for the sake of watering-places and pastures; and the rhinoceros prepared it? self for the combat by sharpening its horn on the rocks in order to better rip the arch? enemy's paunch which it knows to be its softest part (compare Diodor, i, 36; Aelian, Nat. animalium, xvn, 44; Pausanias, ix, 21; and Pliny, Nat. hist., vin, 20: alter hie genitus hostis elephanto cornu ad saxa limato praeparat se pugnae, in dimicatione alvum maxime petens, quam seit esse molliorem). The same story is still repeated by Johan Neuhof (Die Gesantschaft der Ost-Indischen Gesellschaft [1655-57], p. 349, Amsterdam, 1669) in his description of the Chinese rhinoceros, which is based on classical, not Chinese reports: 14 It makes permanent war on the elephant, and when ready to fight, it whets its horn on stones. In the struggle with the elephant it always hits toward its paunch where it is softest, and when it has opened'a hole there, it desists, and allows it to bleed to death. It grunts like a hog; its flesh eaten by the Moors is so tough that only teeth of steel could bite it." The Brahmans allowed the flesh of the rhinoceros to be eaten as a medicine (M. Chakravarti, Animals in the Inscriptions of Piyadasi, Memoirs As. Soc. of Bengal, Vol. I, p. 371, Calcutta, 1906); according to al-Ber?nl (Sachau, Alberuni s India, Vol. I, p. 204), they had the privilege of eating its flesh. Ctesias stated wrongly that the flesh is so bitter that it is not eaten.</page><page sequence="15">History of the Rhinoceros 85 its nose, it is provided with another smaller horn on its neck. This proves that he must have read about a two-horned rhinoceros, for the specimen shipped to Portugal was the single-horned species of India. Martial, in one of his epigrams (Sped. Ep. XXII), has the verse, "nanique gravem gemino cornu sic extulit ursutn." As long as the fact of a two-horned rhinoceros was not yet scientifically established,? and Dr. Parsons was one of the first to point it out, ? the critics of Martial felt greatly embarrassed over the statement that a rhinoceros with double horn1 should have lifted a bear, and arbitrarily changed the verse in various ways to get around the double horn. D?rer no doubt had this passage in mind, and accepted it as a fact. Nobody at that time, however, knew the location of the second horn: thus it found its place on the neck.2 This case is very instructive, for the Chinese 1 The two-horned African rhinoceros is figured on the bronze coins of Emperor Domitian and on Alexandrian coins of the same emperor (Imhoof-Blumer and Kel? ler, Tier- und Pflanzenbilder auf M?nzen und Gemmen, Plate IV, 8), and unmis? takably referred to by Pausanias (I. c), who describes it as having the one horn on the extremity of its nose, the other, not very large, above the latter. The struggle between bear and rhinoceros is represented on a pottery lamp from Labicum, which is reproduced in Fig. 7 after O. Keller (Tiere des classischen Altertums, p. 118, Innsbruck, 1887), in order to illustrate the affinity of this creature with the " hog-like'' rhinoceros of the Chinese (Fig. 6). D?rer's picture formerly led astray many a student of classical antiquity by giving the impression that a horn was really growing up from the animal's back. Thus S. Bochart, in his Hierozoicon (p. 931, Lugduni Batavorum, 1692), a learned treatise on the animals mentioned in the Bible, makes the following observation with reference to the verse of Martial above quoted: "Frustra etiam id observatur, Rhinocerotem geminum habere cornu. Alterum enim est in dorso, quo ursum extulisse dici non potest. Itaque ad illud cornu non pertinent haec poetae: gemino cornu sic extulit ursum.'' It was Bochart who proposed several conjectures tending to ameliorate Martial's text. Johannes Beckmann (De historia naturali veterum libellus primus, p. 129, Petropoli et Goettingae, 1766) was the first to point out emphatically the actual truth in the matter, in these words: "Sed non soli philologi, verum etiam physici duo cornua neglectis illis veterum locis [i.e., the passages of Martial and Pausanias] negarunt Rhinoceroti; uti Scheuchzerus, Peyerus. Consultius fuisset nec afhrmare nec negare. Hodie enim auctoritatibus gravissi morum virorum satis probatum est, esse Rhinocerotes etiam bicornes, qui cornu alterum non in fronte, non in dorso, sed etiam in nare habent." In view of our sub? ject, it is of especial interest to us to note that this truth was generally recognized in Europe as late as the latter part of the eighteenth century, while Chinese authors were well informed on the subject from the beginning of our era. 2 It has recently been asserted (compare the notice of S. Reinach, Re&amp;ue archeo logique, 1913, p. 105) that the rhinoceros on a marble relief of Pompeii (Fig. 3; repro? duced also by Reinach, Repertoire de reliefs, Vol. Ill, p. 93; and O. Keller, Die antike Tierwelt, Vol. I, p. 388) is an exact copy of the wood-engraving by D?rer and accordingly the work of a forger. This point of view seems to me inadmissible, and I concur with Reinach in the view that a common antique model may have been handed down by the illustrators of the bestiaries. The most striking coincidence between the rhinoceros of Pompeii and that of D?rer is the location of the second horn on the neck. This argument, however, is not cogent in establishing a close interdependence of the two; for also in China, on a picture of Yen Li-pen of the Tang period (Fig. 11), the rhinoceros appears with a horn on its neck, and with scales on its body. As the artists all over the world were so much puzzled as to where to place the horn or horns, it is perfectly conceivable that D?rer, solely guided by his reading of ancient writers, even without having recourse to an antique pictorial representation, worked out his</page><page sequence="16">86 Chinese Clay Figures draughtsmen who had set before them the task of portraying a rhinoceros saw themselves in the same predicament as D?rer, in that they were lacking all personal experience of the animal, and for this reason were actuated by the same psychological factors. They, on their part, resorted to the classical definitions of the animal, as laid down in the ancient dictionaries Erh ya and Shuo win; they did not intend to picture a rhinoceros true to nature and directly from nature, simply because they were deprived of this opportunity, but they composed and pieced to? gether the creature from certain notions which they formed from bits of information gathered from their literary records. Whatever carica? tures their achievements may be, however, there cannot be the slightest doubt that they intended to represent a rhinoceros, not some other animal. D?rer's work, from a scientific viewpoint, is in details highly inaccurate and untrue; the modern naturalist may even pronounce the verdict that what he represented is far from resembling a rhinoceros at all; but the bare fact remains ? and this is the essential point ? that the artist, as expressly stated in the legend by his own hand, had the intention of representing in this work a rhinoceros. As in most cases, the artist does not reproduce an object as it appears in the world of reality, but conveys to us his own notions of things as they are pro? jected in his mind. Exactly as it happened in China, so D?rer's model found many adherents and followers, even among the naturalists who copied him again and again, and who surpassed him in fanciful additions of scales, wrinkles, and other decorations. Even Bontius,1 who pre? tends that he saw the animal in exotic forests and stables, and boasts of furnishing a figure of it free from D?rer's defects, represents it, instead of with hoofs, with a paw very similar to that of a dog, only that it is somewhat larger. own theory in regard to the second horn. But it is desirable that, as suggested by Reinach, the iconographic question should be studied in detail. Neither should the differences between the two be overlooked. D?rer's posterior horn is directly behind the ears; in the Pompeiian picture it is far behind the ears, above the front legs; in the same spot D?rer has a small triangular point, the significance of which is not clear. It is certainly astonishing that the artists of Pompeii could commit this error, as the two-horned African rhinoceros was perfectly known in the Roman circus, and is correctly represented on the coins of Domitian mentioned above.?Ulysses Aldro vandus (Quadrupedum omnium bisulcorum historia, p. 354, Francofurti, 1647) has the figure of a rhinoceros, with an additional horn in the shape of a corkscrew placed on the shoulders. 1 Jacobi Bontii, Historiae naturalis et medicae Ihdiae Orie^ntalis libri sex, p. 51 (Amsterdam, 1658). The horn is correctly drawn* Bontius avails himself of the word abada, which was used by old Spanish and Portuguese writers for a rhinoceros, and adopted by some of the older English narrators. The word is probably connected with Malayan badak, "rhinoceros" (see Yule and Burnell, Hobson-Jobson, p. 1). In G. de Mendoza (Dell' historia del gran regno della China, 1586, p. 437) the word abada is identified with the rhinoceros.</page><page sequence="17">History of the Rhinoceros 87 Archaeologists are agreed that the rhinoceros (Fig. 4)1 is represented on the black obelisk of Salmanassar (b.c. 860-824) in company with an elephant, human-looking apes, and long-tailed monkeys. This tribute picture suggests to I. Kennedy2 the first certain evidence of Baby? lonian intercourse with India. The animals formed part of the tribute of the Muzri, an Armenian tribe living in the mountains to the north-east of Nineveh.8 The rhinoceros is called in the inscrip? tion an "ox of the river Sakeya," and Kennedy criticises its repre-* sentation as "very ugly and ill drawn." Indeed, it is no more and no less than a bull, and, as far as natural truth is concerned, much in? ferior to the Chinese sketches. It even has cloven bull-feet, while one of the Chinese drawings has correctly three toes,4 and the single FlG' 4* - ., . ? , j Rhinoceros from Obelisk of Salmanassar Clumsy horn IlSeS On ltS IOrenead (from O.

Marquart (Untersuchungen zur Geschichte von Eran, II, p. 101, Leipzig, 1905), who discusses the same passage in the inscription of Salmanas sar II, Muzri is the name of a country and mountain-range (Muz?r Mountains) west of the Euphrates, and comprising also a part of the mountainous region south of the river. Marquart translates "cattle of the river Irkea." Others, like Schr?der, Hommel, and W. Max M?ller (see B. Meissner, Assyrische Jagden, p. 20, Leipzig, 1911) identify Muzri with Egypt. Kennedy does not explain how the rhinoceros could have gotten into that region from India; and it may have been, after all, an African species, although the single horn would rather point to India; the elephant, however, m his opinion, came over the passes of the Hindu Kush. There is, of course, the possibility that the lower Euphrates region may have harbored the rhinoceros, if we can depend upon the report of the Hou Han shu regarding the country of T'iao chi (Hirth, China and the Roman Orient, p. 38); and I am in full accord with what Hirth remarks on this point in the preface (pp. x-xu). However this may be, I agree with Kennedy, P. Hommel (Die Namen der S?ugetiere bei den s?dsemiti? schen V?lkern, p. 324), Meissner, and Keller that the animal figured on the black obelisk of Salmanassar is intended for a rhinoceros, and not merely for an ox, for there is no ox with single horn as here represented. The Assyrian name for the rhinoceros is kur-ki~ssa-an-nu*= kurkizannu (F.

The trade-relations of India with Babylon are well established (see particularly G.

Bengal, 1874), which, according to Hommel _* i_i_i /_~_a_1_* l _</page><page sequence="18">88 Chinese Clay Figures between the eyes, as it occurs in the armorial unicorns. It is very instructive to compare this Babylonian representation with those of the Chinese; and whoever will view them together will certainly grant attenuating circumstances to the latter. The Babylonian production is the more surprising, as the supposition is granted that the live animal was sent as tribute; and the "artist," we should think, had occasion to actually see it. The outcome is such a caricature, however, that this point of view seems impossible; the "artist" simply acted on hearsay, or had been instructed to represent a queer foreign animal of the appearance of an ox, but with only a single horn on its forehead. And here we are again landing right at the threshold of the psychology of the Chinese draughts? man who, most assuredly, had never throughout his life viewed any living specimen of a rhinoceros, but merely reconstructed it in a vision of his mind from what he had heard or read. Nevertheless his product is not what it may seem to us on the surface, but it is and remains what it is intended for, ? the rhinoceros. Another instructive example for the iconography of the rhinoceros is furnished by Cosmas Indicopleustes, the Egyptian monk and traveller of the sixth century a.d. Cosmas1 discriminates between the unicorn (monokeros) and the "nose-horn" (rhinokeros), and has handed down to us sketches of both. In regard to the former, he remarks that he has not seen it, but that he had had occasion to notice four brazen figures of it set up in the four-towered palace of the King of Ethiopia, from which he was able to draw it. His figure2 looks somewhat like a missing link between a horse and a giraffe, carrying on its head a straight, long horn. "In Ethiopia," Cosmas assures us, "I once saw a living rhi? noceros from a great distance and saw also the skin of a dead one stuffed with chaff, standing in the royal palace, and thus I was able to draw it accurately." The result of this "accurate" drawing is the figure of a maned horse with bushy tail, with two horns planted upright on its nose.8 Nobody, as far as I know, has as yet inferred from this figure that the Greek word rhinokeros relates to an equine animal and should be translated by "horse." An interesting example of a Persian conception of the rhinoceros is depicted in the Burlington Magazine} This is derived from an Vol. I, p. 371, Calcutta, 1906). In the commentary of Kuo P'o to the dictionary Erh ya (see below, p. 94) and in the Kiao chou ki of the fifth century a.d. it is clearly stated that the rhinoceros has three toes.

Here we have the interesting case that the author of this article, C. Anet, who evidently does not read Persian, mistakes the rhinoceros for "a horned gnu." But the picture is entitled in Persian kerkeden (or kargadan), "the rhinoceros/' and it is therefore superfluous to dis? cuss the point that it cannot represent a gnu.1 Although the creature has the shape of an ox, exactly as on the Assyrian obelisk and in the Chinese woodcut (Fig. 5), with the additional hump of a zebu2 and black antelope-like stripes on its body, it is unmistakably characterized by a single horn in the form of a crescent.3 In order to understand how the early Chinese illustrations of the rhinoceros alluded to by Mr. Giles were made, it is imperative to study the ancient definitions of the two words se and si. These definitions are sufficiently clear to place us on the right track in nicely dis? criminating between the two words, which plainly refer to two distinct species of rhinoceros. The weak point in Mr. Giles's definition of "bovine animal"4 is that it is somewhat generalized, and leaves us entirely in the dark as to the difference between the two words se and si. They are physically differentiated words, and are expressed by different symbols in writing. Se-ma Ts Hen5 mentions the two species of rhinoceros and elephant as inhabitants of the country of Shu (Sze-ch*uan).6 The commentator 1A species of antelope restricted to Africa, which could hardly be expected in Persian art. 2 This hints at the square-mouthed or white rhinoceros of Africa. One of the peculiarities of this species is the prominent, rounded, fleshy hump on the nape of the neck, just forward of the withers (U. Heller, The White Rhinoceros, p. 20, Washington, 1913). 3 A representation of the rhinoceros in sculpture is spoken of in a Persian descrip? tion of the province of Fars from the beginning of the twelfth century; in Istakhr the portrait-statue of King Jamshld was erected in stone, with his left hand grasping the neck of a lion, or else seizing a wild ass by the head, or again he is taking a unicorn (or rhinoceros) by the horn, while in his right hand he holds a hunting-knife, which he has plunged into the belly of the lion or unicorn (G. Le Strange, Journal R. As. Soc, 1912, p. 27). In the Annals of the T'ang Dynasty it is on record that in 746 a.d. Persia offered a rhinoceros and an elephant (Chavannes, Txoung Paoy 1904, p. 76). * What wild bovine animal should be understood has never been indicated. 5 Shi ki, Ch. 117, pp. 3 b, 7 b. 6 Our historians of Japan have been greatly puzzled by the fact that the Japanese Buddhist monk Tiao-jan (Japanese Ch?nen), who came to China in 984, stated in his report embodied in Sung shi (Ch. 494, p. 4 b) that there were in his native country water-buffalo, donkeys, sheep, and plenty of ? thus it has been translated ? rhinoceroses and elephants (for example, by P. A. Tschepe, Japans Beziehungen zu China, p. 89, Yen-chou fu, 1907). O. Nachod (Geschichte von Japan, Vol. I, p. 22) went so far as to appeal to a misunderstanding on the part of the Japanese informant, which he believes cannot be surprising, as Tiao-jan, though well versed in the written characters of the Chinese, did not understand their spoken language. This argu</page><page sequence="20">9o Chinese Clay Figures states, "The animal se is built like the water-buffalo. The elephant is a large animal with long trunk and tusks ten feet long; it is popularly styled 'river ape' (kiang yilan, No. 13,741). The animal si has a head resembling that of the ape yuan and a single horn on its forehead."1 mentation is entirely inadmissible. It is certain that neither rhinoceros nor elephant exists in Japan: consequently Tiao-jan, in using the expression si siang (Japanese sai-zo) cannot be understood to convey to it its literal meaning, but he is sure to em? ploy it in a different sense. Chinese expressions (and Japanese are largely based on them) do not always mean what they seem to imply on the surface, but are often literary allusions or reminiscences of a metaphorical significance. The Japanese monk indeed avails himself of a Chinese phrase of classical origin traceable to Ming-tse (Legge, Classics, Vol. II, p. 281), and in my opinion, simply means to say that Japan produces "extraordinary wild animals." Yen Shi-ku, defining the word shou ("wild animals") in the Annals of the Han (TsHen Han shu, Ch. 28 a, p. 4 b), explains it as embracing such kinds as rhinoceros and elephants, whence it follows that this com? pound si siang is capable of rendering the general notion of wild animals. Si siang has thus become a stereotyped term occurring in many authors, although the literal meaning usually remains, as, for example, in TsHen Han shu (Ch. 28 b, p. 17), Erh ya (see p. 94, note 3), Nan shi (Ch. 78, p. 7), T'ang shu (Chs. 43 a, p. 1, and 221 a, p. 10 b), and in the History of Shu (Shu kien) written by Kuo Y?n-t'aoin 1236 (Ch. 10, p. 1, ed. of Shou shan ko tsKung shu, Vol. 23). Hirth and Rockhill (Chau Ju-kua, p. 174) have taken a different view of the matter and suppose that the document utilized in the Sung Annals, and partially copied by Chao Ju-kua (inclusive of the statement that Japan produces si siang), contained a number of clerical errors; they are convinced that Tiao-jan's statement really was to the effect that there are neither rhinoceroses nor elephants in Japan. There is certainly no direct objection to be raised to such a point of view, but I am inclined to believe that with the indication as given there is no necessity of resorting to such a conjecture. 1 This universal notion could have emanated only from the two-horned species with reference to the rear horn, which anatomically is indeed placed over the frontal bone, while the front horn is situated over the conjoined nasal bones (Flower and Lydekker, Introduction to the Study of Mammals, p. 403). The posterior horn immediately follows the anterior one, and is somewhat beneath the eyes. Curiously enough, this idea of the position of the horn on the forehead was transferred also to the single-horned species, and became a well-established tradition, which one author copied from another. It is found in the classical world as well as among the Arabic authors. Ctesias (ed. Baehr, p. 254) seems to be the most ancient writer in whom this tradition has crystallized: he describes the wild white asses of India as "having on the forehead a horn a cubit and a half in length." The fact that he speaks of the rhinoceros, above all, is evidenced by his reference to the horn being made into drinking-cups which were a preventive of poisoning (compare also Lassen, Indische Altertumskunde, Vol. II, p. 646). The monoceros of India, in the description of Pliny (Nat. hist., vin, 21), had a single black horn projecting from its forehead, two cubits in length (uno cornu nigro media fronte cubitorum duum eminente). The horn of the rhinoceros sculptured in Assyria, as we have seen, is planted on its fore? head. Of course, when describing a rhinoceros which he saw at the games in the cir? cus, Pliny (viii, 20) states correctly that it has a single horn on its nose (unius in nare cornus); so does Aelian (xvii, 44), and so does likewise Kuo P'o. The Arabic merchant Soleiman, writing in 851 (M. Reinaud, Relation des voyages faits par les Arabes, Vol. I, p. 28), attributes to the rhinoceros of India a single horn in the middle of its forehead, and is duly seconded by his copyist Mas'?di (Ruska, Der Islam, Vol. IV, p. 164). Ibn al-Faqih, describing the two-horned species of Africa, states that it has on its forehead a horn, by means of which it inflicts mortal wounds; and another minor one is beneath the former and placed between its eyes (E. Wiede mann, Zur Mineralogie im Islam, p. 250). Even al-Ber?nl (E. Sachau, Alberuni's India, Vol. I, p. 204), who imparts a sensible account of the Indian rhinoceros, asserts from hearsay that the African species has a conical horn on the skull, and a second and longer horn on the front. Early European observers also believed that the horn of the rhinoceros was growing on its forehead. Barker, as quoted by Yule</page><page sequence="21">History of the Rhinoceros 9i In the other passage, the definition of Kuo P'o (276?324), the editor of the dictionary Erh ya, is quoted. The following definitions of the words se and si are given in the an? cient dictionary Shuo win (about 100 a.d.), and are here reproduced from an edition of this work printed in 1598, which is an exact facsimile reproduction of the Sung edition of the year 986. In all probability, this one faithfully mirrors the text of the original issue. The definition of se consists of only five words: " It is like a wild ox and dark-colored."1 The character is then explained as a pictorial symbol (compare the re? production of the Chinese text on p. 92). It is doubtless on this enigmatic and incomplete definition that the explanations of Palladius and Couvreur (above, p. 74) are based. In order to reach a satisfactory result, however, it is always necessary to consult all records relating to a case; and it will always be unsafe to rely upon a single statement, which, after all, may have been curtailed, or in? correctly handed down. Let us note at the outset that the Shuo wen by no means says that the animal in question is a wild ox, but only that it is like one; a comparison with a wild ox is not yet proof of identity with it. Hing Ping (932?1010), the commentator of Shuo wen, annotates on the above passage as follows,?" Its skin is so strong and thick that armor can be made from it,"?and quotes theKiao chouki2 to the effect that "the horn is over three feet long and shaped like the handle of a horse-whip." 3 The fact that this author means to speak of a single horn becomes evident from the statement of Kuo P*o to be cited presently.4 The and Burnell (Hobson-Jobson, p. i),wrote in 1592, "Now this Abath [abada, bada ?= rhinoceros] is a beast that hath one home only in her forehead, and is thought to be the female Unicorne, and is highly esteemed of all the Moores in those parts as a most soveraigne remedie against poyson." 1 K'ang-hi's Dictionary quotes the Shuo win as saying that "the animal se has the shape or body of a wild ox and is dark-colored." 2 Records of Annam, of the fourth or fifth century, by Liu Hin-k*i (Bretschnei der, Bot. Sin., pt. 1, p. 159). 3 In a somewhat different way, the Shuo win is cited in Yen Men lei han (Ch. 430, p. 16 b), where original text and commentary are blended together: "The animal se resembles a wild ox and has a dark-colored skin which is so strong and thick that it can be worked up into armor. Among the animals on the mountain Po-chung, there is a large number of se." The latter name, according to Palladius, is an ancient designation for a mountain in the west of Shan-si. The fact that the rhinoceros should have occurred there in ancient times is not at all surprising (see the notes below on the distribution of the animal in ancient times). It is noteworthy that we meet here the reading, "it resembles a wild ox," in agreement with the wording of the Erh ya, whence it follows that the se was not straightway looked upon as a wild ox, but as something else; it was merely likened to it?a phraseology which is echoed in Baby? lonia and in the classical authors. This simile seems to account for the erroneous at? tempt of later commentators, like Chu Hi, to interpret se as identical with a wild ox. 4 The Kiao chou ki is credited in the Yen kien lei han with the words, "The se has a single horn which is over two feet long and shaped like the handle of a horse? whip."</page><page sequence="22"></page><page sequence="23">History of the Rhinoceros 93 animal si is defined in the Shuo win as "an ox occurring beyond the southern frontier. It has a horn on its nose and another one on the crown of its head; it resembles a pig."1 This definition fits no other animal than the two-horned species of rhinoceros, and has great his? torical value as a piece of evidence in determining the former geograph? ical distribution of the species. The passage shows us that in the first century a.d. it no longer existed in northern China, where its habitat had been prior to that time, and that it was then driven back beyond the southern border, speaking roughly, south of the Yangtse. It was then naturalized in Y?n-nan, in the country of the Ai-lao,2 and in Tonking.3 To the author of Kiao chou ki we owe the following interesting de? scription of the Annamese rhinoceros:4 "The rhinoceros (si) has its habitat in the district of Kiu-t? (in Tonking). It has hair like swine, three toes, and a head like a horse. It is provided with two horns,? the horn on the nose being long, the horn on the forehead short." It is clearly manifest that this description comes from an eye-witness, or one well informed by the native hunters, and that it perfectly fits the two-horned so-called Sumatran rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sumatrensis), the only living Asiatic species with two horns, and also the most hairy one.5 Its essential characteristics are well observed and briefly set forth in this definition. The dictionary Erhya, edited by Kuo P*o (276-324), defines the animal se as resembling the ox, and the animal si as resembling swine. The commentary by Kuo P'o explains that the se has a single horn, is dark in color, and weighs a thousand catties;6 and "the si resembles in form 1 Marco Polo (edition of Yule and Cordier, Vol. II, p. 285) says regarding the rhinoceros of Java that its head resembles that of a boar. 2 Hou Han shu, Ch. 116, p. 8 b. 3 The question of the former geographical distribution of the rhinoceros in China is studied in detail below, pp. 159-166. 4 Yen kien lei han, Ch. 340, p. 1. In Annamese the rhinoceros is called hut (written with the Chinese character for se) and tdy or ti (written with the character for si). 5 Hair grows sparsely all over the head and body, but attains its maximum de? velopment on the ears and the tail, its color varying from brown to black. The long? est known specimen of the front horn is in the British Museum, and has a length of 32&gt;? inches, with a basal girth of 17inches; a second specimen in the same collec? tion measures 27inches in length, and 17 $4 in circumference (R. Lydekker, The Game Animals of India, p. 38). The statement of the Kia? chou ki that the horn is two or three feet long is therefore no exaggeration. Concerning the two horns in the si, there is consensus of opinion between that work and the Shuo win. 6 This may not be an exaggeration, though merely based on a rough estimate. The average weight of the rhinoceros, for reasons easy to comprehend, has never been ascertained. But if the weight of the skin alone may come to three hundred pounds (E. Heller, The White Rhinoceros, p. 10), the complete animal may easily total a thousand and more. K%ang-hi and the modern editions of the Erh ya write '' thousand</page><page sequence="24">94 Chinese Clay Figures the water-buffalo,1 but has the head of a pig, a big paunch, short legs, and three toes on its feet; it is black in color and has three horns, one on the head, another on the forehead, and the third on the nose. The horn on the nose is the one by means of which it feeds [that is, uproots shrubs and trees];2 it is small and not long; it likes to eat thorny brambles; there is also a kind with but a single horn." Kuo P'o, accordingly, is fully acquainted with the single-horned rhinoceros (his three-horned species is discussed farther on), and renders it plain enough that in his opinion neither the se nor the si is a bovine animal, as he treats them in a different section; while in his section on bovines, with twelve illustrations of such, no hint is made at se or si.z The last doubt which might still exist as to the acquaintance with the single-horned rhinoceros on the part of Kuo P'o and H? Sh&amp;n, the author of Shuo wen, will be banished by another word, tuanA (or kio tuan), of which Shuo win (Ch. n, p. 2) says that it is an animal of the shape of swine, with a horn which is good for making bows, and which is produced in the country Hu-siu.8 catties." Yen kien lei han (I. c.) has the erroneous reading "ten," which is impossible. Also Chang Yu-si, the author of the Pu chu pin ts*ao of the year 1057, as may be seen from the Ching lei pin ts'ao, quotes the Erh ya as saying that "the se resembles an ox and has a single horn." Kuo P'o, accordingly, concurs with Liu Hin-k'i in the view that se is the single-horned rhinoceros. 1 Yen kien lei han (Ch. 430, p. 1) offers the variant, "The si resembles swine, but is in shape like an ox;" then the same text as above is given, but the clause in regard to the three horns is wanting. 2 While feeding, the point of the horn of the animal may come in contact with the ground, so that the point is sometimes worn flat on its outer face (E. Heller, The White Rhinoceros, p. 31). According to Ibn al-Faqlh, the African rhinoceros tears herbage out with the anterior horn, and kills the lion with the posterior one (E. Wiedemann, Zur Mineralogie im Islam, p. 250). 3 The rhinoceros is incidentally mentioned in another passage of Erh ya (Ch. B, fol. 29), where nine mountains with their famed productions are enumerated: "The finest productions of the southern region are the rhinoceros (si) and elephant of Mount Liang" (Liang shan, in Chung chou, Sze-ch*uan; Playfair, 2d ed., No. 3790, 2; Bretschneider, Bot. Sin., pt. 3, p. 575, No. 187). Kuo P'o adds, "The rhinoceros furnishes hide and horn, the elephant ivory and bones." It follows therefrom, as is also confirmed by other sources, that in the third century a.D., the lifetime of Kuo P'o, the rhinoceros still existed in Sze-ch'uan, as seen above; its existence was attested there by Se-ma Ts'ien several centuries earlier. 4 Composed of the classifier kio ('horn') and the phonetic element tuan (No. 12,136).

Other editions write Hu-lin. A horn bow is not a bow exclusively made from horn, which is technically impossible; but horn is only one of the substances entering into its manufacture. Technically the Chinese bow belongs to the class of composite bows, the production of which is a complicated process and requires a large amount of toil and dexterity. The foundation of the bow is formed of flexible wood connected with a bamboo staff. Along the back a thick layer of carefully soaked and prepared animal sinew is pressed, which, after drying, stiffens into a hard elastic substance. The inner side of the bow is then covered with two long horn sticks joining each other in the centre. The opposite of the horn bow is the wooden (or simple) bow (mu kung), as it is mentioned, for instance, as being used by</page><page sequence="25">History of the Rhinoceros 95 Kuo P'o states in regard to the same animal, "The horn is on the nose and capable of being made into bows. Li Ling presented ten such bows to Su Wu.1 The animal mentioned in the Life of Se-ma Siang-ju in the Shi ki (Ch. 117) is the kH-lin2 kio tuan" The animal with a horn on its nose is the single-horned rhinoceros; and the term tuan or kio tuan is a counterpart of the word monoceros of the ancients, as alluded to by Ctesias, Aristotle, Pliny, Aelian, and others, and which, according to the general consensus of opinion, relates to the one-horned rhinoceros of India. Bows manufactured from the horn are mentioned also in the Annals of the Kin Dynasty.3 The allusion to armor by Hing Ping is additional proof for se being a rhinoceros, for, as we shall see, armor was not made in ancient China from the hides of bovine animals.4 It is beyond any doubt that in those various definitions there is plainly the question of a rhinoceros. We cannot get over the single horn, whether placed on the nose, the head, or the forehead;5 we can? not get over the fact, either, that a conspicuous distinction between the single-horned (se) and two-horned (si) species is made, ? a fact which will be discussed in full farther on when we have learned everything that Chinese authors have to report anent the two animals; nor can we get over the three toes which form a prominent characteristic of the rhi? noceros,6 but assuredly not of any bovine species. In fact, the Chinese definitions, without pretension to scientific accuracy, which could not be the populace of Tonking (TsHen Han shu, Ch. 28 b, p. 17), which in connection with it availed itself of flint, bamboo, and sometimes bone arrowheads. 1 See Giles, Biographical Dictionary, pp. 450, 684. 2 Regarding the kH-lin see below, p. 113. 3 Kin shi, Ch. 120, p. 3. Fossil rhinoceros-horn (from Rhinoceros tichorrhinus) is still employed by the Yakut in the manufacture of bows (B. Adler, Int. Archiv f?r Ethnographie, Vol. XIV, 1901, p. 11). 4 Regarding other Chinese notions of monoceroses see p. 114. Of later descriptions of the rhinoceros, the one contained in Ying yai shing lan of 1416 by Ma Kuan is the most interesting. It is the most concise and correct definition ever given of the animal outside of our modern zoology. "The products of Champa are rhinoceros horn and ivory of which there is a large quantity. The rhinoceros is like the water buffalo. Animals of full growth weigh eight hundred catties. The body is hairless, black in color, and covered by a thick skin in the manner of a scale armor. The hoofs are provided with three toes. A single horn is placed on the extremity of the nose, the longest reaching almost fifteen inches. It subsists only on brambles, tree leaves and branches, and dried wood." 5 As already remarked by Cuvier, the only real animal with a single horn is the rhinoceros. 6 This statement reflects much credit on the observational power of the Chinese, especially as it is not pointed out by any classical author in describing the rhinoceros or unicorn. Al-Ber?nl (Sachau, Alberuni's India, Vol. I, p. 203) is the only early author outside of China to make the same observation. Al-Ber?nl gives two different and contradictory descriptions of the rhinoceros, apparently emanating from two different sources. First, the animal is sensibly described from personal observation</page><page sequence="26">96 Chinese Clay Figures expected, are perfectly sound and to the point in stating what a primitive observer could testify in regard to an animal so difficult of access and so difficult to describe. Surely, the Chinese definitions are not worse, and in several points perhaps better, than anything said about the animal in classical antiquity, among the Arabs, or in Europe up to the eighteenth century. And we shall soon recognize that until the very recent dawn of our scientific era the Chinese were the nation of the world which was best informed on the subject.1 The Chinese likened the rhinoceros to the ox, the water-buffalo, the pig,2 and its head to that of an ape. as follows: "The ganda exists in large numbers in India, more particularly about the Ganges. It is of the build of the buffalo [analogous to the Chinese definition], has a black scaly skin, and dewlaps hanging down under the chin. It has three yellow hoofs on each foot, the biggest one forward, the others on both sides. The tail is not long; the eyes lie low, farther down the cheek than is the case with all other animals. On the top of the nose there is a single horn which is bent upwards. The Brahmins have the privilege of eating the flesh of the ganda. I have myself witnessed how an elephant coming across a young ganda was attacked by it. The ganda wounded with its horn a forefoot of the elephant, and threw it down on its face." The other account of al-Ber?ni, which refers to the double-horned African species, is composed of the narrative of a man who had visited Suf?la in Africa, and of classical reminiscences freely intermingled with it; to the latter belong the beliefs in the mobility of the horn and in the sharpening of the horn against rocks, and here appears also the wrong notion that it has hoofs. ? Pliny (Nat. hist., vin, 21, ?76) asserts that the single horned oxen of India have solid hoofs (in India et boves solidis ungulis unicornes), a tradition which savors of the description of a unicorn after a sculpture (on the As? syrian obelisk the animal has bovine hoofs). Even Aristotle (Hist, an., n, 18; ed. of Aubert and Wimmer, Vol. I, pp. 74, 254), who evidently speaks after Ctesias, characterizes the single-horned "Indian ass" as solid-hoofed (fi&amp;wxa). This lacune in the descriptions of the ancients was aptly pointed out by Belin de Ballu (La chasse, poeme d'Oppien, p. 174, Strasbourg, 1787), who, in speaking of the familiarity of the ancients with the animal, concludes by saying, "Mais ce qui doit nous Stornier c'est qu' aucun n'ait parle* d*un caraetere particulier de cet animal, dont les pieds sont partag?s en trois parties, rev&amp;tue chacune d'une sole semblable ? celle du bceuf." 1 The only reproach that can be made to the Chinese authors is that they never point to the peculiar skin-folds of the animal (with the only exception, perhaps, of Fan Ch&amp;n of the Sung period, who describes the rhinoceros of Annam as "clad with a fleshy armor;" see p. 113), and that, despite the live specimens procured for the Imperial Court (p. 80), no attempt has ever been made at a more precise description based on actual observation. But we may address the same charge of omission to the authors of India, the Greek writers on India, and to Pliny and Aelian. Pliny is content with stating that he saw the animal in the Roman circus, but does not de? scribe what he saw, while he is eager to reproduce all the fables regarding the monoce ros, emanating from India or from former sources relative to India. Aelian (Nat. an., xvn, 44) thinks it superfluous to describe the form of the rhinoceros, since a great many Greeks and Romans have seen and clearly know it. In matters of descrip? tion the animal presents as difficult a subject as in matters of art. Exact descriptions of it are due only to competent zoologists of recent times. 2 How very natural this comparison is, maybe gleaned from the account contained in Nan Yiie chi (quoted in T'u shu tsi chKing, chapter on rhinoceros), that at the time of the Han a rhinoceros once stampeded from Kiao chi (Annam) into Kao-liang (the ancient name for Kao-chou fu in Kuang-tung Province), and that it was mistaken by the people for a black ox, while those acquainted with the animal asserted that it was a black rhinoceros. The resemblance of the rhinoceros to an ox or buffalo has indeed obtruded itself on the observers of all times; and this notion is so far from being restricted to the Chinese, that it may almost be called universal. As seen above (p. 87), the Assyrians called the animal "ox of the river Sakeya." Pliny (Nat. hist.,</page><page sequence="27">History of the Rhinoceros 97 This is all exceedingly good: it is simply the result of that mental process which classifies a novel experience under a well-known category, viii, 21, ?72, 7^) speaks of the unicorn oxen of India. Festus calls the African rhinoceros the Egyptian ox, and Pausanias tells of "Ethiopic bulls styled rhino? ceroses" which he saw himself in Rome (O. Keller, Die antike Tierwelt, Vol. I, p. 385). The Indian physician Caraka, who lived at the Court of King Kanishka in Kashmir, placed the rhinoceros in the class of buffalo (an?pa, Mem. As. Soc. Bengal, Vol. I, 1906, p. 371). The Arabic merchant Soleiman, who wrote in 851, compared the Indian rhinoceros with the buffalo (M. Reinaud, Relation des voyages, Vol. I, p. 29); and so did, as seen above, al-Ber?nl. Ibn al-Faqih says regarding the African rhinoceros that it resembles a calf (E. Wiedemann, Zur Mineralogie im Islam, p. 250). The Talmud, in three passages, mentions the one-horned ox as an animal sacri? ficed by Adam (L. Lewysohn, Die Zoologie des Talmuds, p. 151, Frankfurt, 1858). The "sea-ox" mentioned by Leo Africanus (Hirth and Rockhill, Chau Ju-kua, p. 145) certainly is the rhinoceros. The Malays designate the two-horned species badak-karbau, "the buffalo-rhinoceros," and the single-horned species badak-g?jah, "the elephant-rhinoceros." It is difficult to understand, however, why some of the classical authors allude to the rhinoceros under the designation "the Indian ass" (Aristotle, Hist, an., n, 18, ed. of Aubert and Wimmer, Vol. I, pp. 74, 254). Aristotle's definition is traceable to Ctesias (ed. Baehr, p. 254), who states that there were in India wild white asses celebrated for their swiftness of foot, having on the forehead a horn a cubit and a half in length, and that they are colored white, red, and black; from the horn were made drinking-cups which were a preventive of poisoning (compare also Lassen, Indische Altertumskunde, Vol. II, p. 646). The mention of these antipoisonous cups is good evidence for the fact that Ctesias hints at the Indian rhinoceros (Herodotus, iv, 191, speaks of horned asses of Libya, but they are not one-horned). Ctesias is an author difficult to judge. His account of India, said to have been written in b.c. 389, it should be borne in mind, was de? rived second-hand, while he resided in Persia as court-physician of King Artaxerxes Mnemon, so that his data may partially be based on Persian accounts of India, and misunderstandings of his informants may have crept in; moreover, his report is handed down in a bad and fragmentary condition, and may have been disfigured by Photias of Byzance of the ninth century, to whom the preservation of his work is due. The definition of Ctesias in the present case cannot be regarded as correct, as we do not find in India, or anywhere else in the East, a comparison of the rhinoceros with an ass, nor any tradition to this effect,? a tradition which is not likely ever to have existed. If the ass really was contained in his original text, it must go back, in my estimation, to a misunderstanding on his part of the word imparted to him by the authorities whom he questioned. With the exception of the horn, Ctesias does not seem to have entertained any clear notion of the animal; and his description of the skin as white, red, and black, is baffling. V. Ball (Proceedings Royal Irish Academy, Vol. II, 1885, and in his edition of Tavernier's Travels in India, Vol. I, p. 114) tried to show that the colors seen by Ctesias were artificial pigments applied to the hide, as they are on elephants at the present day; rhinoceroses kept by the R?jas for fighting-purposes were, according to him, commonly painted with diverse bright colors. This forced explanation, shifting quite recent affairs to the days of early antiquity, is hardly plausible. It seems to me that we are bound to assume that the text of this passage is not correctly handed down. The colors white, red, and black would seem rather to have originally adhered to the horn. The Eastern lore of the rhinoceros, as shown by the reports of the Chinese and Arabs, essentially clusters around the horn.? Marco Polo (ed. of Yule and Cordier, Vol. II, p. 285) says in regard to the Javanese rhinoceros that its head resembles that of a wild boar; and this characteriza? tion is quite to the point, as is that of Kuo Pfo when he compares the two-horned si to swine. A glance at Fig. 8, representing the specimen of a Sumatran two-horned rhinoceros in the Field Museum, will convince every one of the appropriateness of this simile. The pig shape of the rhinoceros is apparent also in a Roman representa? tion on a clay lamp from Labicum illustrating the struggle between that animal and a bear (Fig. 7), so that even the most skeptic critic of Chinese animal sketches will be compelled to grant a certain foundation of fact to the hog-like rhinoceros of the Erh ya (Fig. 6).</page><page sequence="28"></page><page sequence="29">History of the Rhinoceros ,99 and the comparisons could not be any better. We should halt a moment to reflect by what class of people these observations had been made. Most certainly by the hardy hunters who chased the wild beasts. We must distinguish between the original observer and story? teller, and the scholar closeted in his study who draughted the definitions for the consumption of the learned. It was not the Chinese philologist who went out into the jungle to study the rhinoceros; he, indeed, never had occasion to see it, but he derived his knowledge from reports made to him by the sportsman. The latter probably was plain and matter-of-fact; the Fig. 8. Sumatran Rhinoceros, Sketch from Museum Specimen (compare Elliot, Catalogue of the Collection of Mammals, Zo?l. Series, Vol. VIII, p. 105). former added a bit of romance and exaggeration. Have we any right to ridicule the Chinese over their embarrassment as to where to locate the horn or the horns, when we observe that this was still a matter of wild speculation amidst Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries?1 1 Dr. Parsons, in the pamphlet quoted, a better proof of how easily men may fall conclusions than this very topic of the horn justly remarks, "Nothing could serve as into uncertainty through preconceived of the rhinoceros."</page><page sequence="30">ioo Chinese Clay Figures Have we any right to look down upon their artists in their naive at? tempts to sketch the rhinoceros in the shape of an ox with a horn on the forehead (Fig. 5), when we observe that the so-called "civilization" of Assyria and the painting of Persia committed the same error, or when we glance at the puerile drawings of Cosmas and recall Duress work with the horn on the animal's neck? In the above definitions we recognize the elements and tools with which the subsequent Chinese illustrators worked. They set out to il? lustrate, not the rhinoceros, but the descriptions given of it in the ancient dictionaries. They studied, not the animal, but the ready made definitions of it encountered in book-knowledge. They read, and their reading guided the strokes of their brush. " The se resembles in body a water-buffalo, the si a pig:" consequently such bodies were outlined by the illustrator of Erh ya; and long, curved, and pointed single horns were placed on the heads (Figs. 5 and 6).1 He apparently shunned the three horns, as the matter was difficult to draw; and no? body knew how to arrange them. He carefully outlined the three toes 1 Our illustrations are derived from a folio edition of the Erh ya printed in 1801 (3 vols.), which is designated as "a reproduction of the illustrated Erh ya of the Sung period" (Ying Sung chxao hui txu Erh ya). The ancient illustrations of the Erh ya by Kuo P'o and Kiang Kuan are lost (see Bretschneider, Bot. Sin., pt. 1, p. 34), and were renewed in the age of the Sung, presumably without any tradition connect? ing the latter with the former. This fact may account for the purely reconstructive work of some illustrations, and we may well assume that the earlier sketches were far better. Many other illustrations of the Erh ya have been brought about in the same manner as those of the rhinoceros. Compare, for instance, the picture of the fabulous horse po (No. 9393) surrounded by flamed fluttering bands and about to lacerate a tiger seized by its carnivora-like, sharp claws; while a panther is swiftly making for safety to escape a similar fate. Of course, the craftsman has never observed this scene, but faithfully depicts the definition of the book, "The animal po is like a horse with powerful teeth, devouring tigers and panthers." This notion, as indicated by Kuo P'o, goes back to the Shan hat king, which says, "There is a wild animal styled po, like a white horse with black tail and powerful teeth, emitting sounds like a drum and devouring tigers and panthers." (Here we have a parallel to, and pre? sumably an echo of, the flesh-eating horses of Diomed and the man-devouring Bucephalus of the Alexander legend; see J. v. Negelein, Das Pferd im arischen Al? tertum, pp. 43, 75, K?nigsberg, 1903.) Otherwise the horses pictured in the Erh ya, aside from their technical drawbacks, are quite realistic; and so are the oxen and other animals which came under the every-day observation of the Chinese. It is still a mystery, and a problem worth while investigating, why the Chinese were rather good at drawing some animals and completely failed in others. It may be pointed out that the tapir of the Erh ya, aside from the exaggerated trunk and wrong tail, is rather correctly outlined with its white saddle, and corresponds to a well-known species (Tapirus indicus). In view of the retrospective and reconstructive sketches of this work, we have the same state of affairs as in the illustrations accompanying the Shan hai king, and as formerly shown by me in Jade, in the San li txu, and to a certain extent in the Ku yii Vu p%u. The illustrators of the ancient Rituals did not directly picture the actual, ancient ceremonial objects, most of which were lost past hope in their time, but reconstructed them from the descriptions supplied by the commentators of the ancient texts, and for better or worse, based their illus? trations on these artificial reconstructions, which to a large extent are erroneous or imaginary.</page><page sequence="31">History of the Rhinoceros ioi in the animal si; and this feature, combined with the single horns, is sufficient flavor of the rhinoceros to guard from any rash conclusion even one who has not considered the psychological foundation of these sketches. From the fact that the animal se is drawn in the shape of an ox, Mr. Giles infers that the word se does not denote the rhinoceros, but "a bovine animal." Then, how about the word si? The animal si (Fig. 6) is undeniably represented in the Erh ya tu with the body of a hog,? why not, to be consistent, also translate the word si by "swine"? If a child who was invited to make a sketch of a whale should delineate it in the shape of a fish, should we conclude for this reason that the whale is a fish? To make use of an illustration for a far-reaching philological and zoological conclusion, it is indispensable to ascertain the real value of such an illustration, and to make a somewhat critical study of its origin and basis. Mr. Giles is right in stating that there are illustra? tions of the animal se that are purely those of an ox. The ill-reputed San li tu, for instance, stooped to this wisdom when the difficult task arose of illustrating in the shape of a rhinoceros the target used by the lords and ministers in the practice of archery, and spoken of in the Chou li and I li. But what wonder! Those illustrators who employed the pure-ox design simply stood on the platform of the sober and incom? plete definition of the Shuo win, "The animal se is like a wild ox." Nothing could be more convenient to the unthinking and mechanical craftsman; this plain recipe freed him from the responsibility for the horn. Anybody could outline an ox with two regular horns; and by inscribing it se, the satisfaction at this achievement was naturally the greater. It is incorrect, however, to say that the animal se, as outlined in T*u shu tsi ch'lng (Fig. 9), is the picture of an ox. In its general features it resembles a kind of deer, as does likewise the animal si (Fig. 10). A lengthy discussion of the "deer-like" rhinoceros follows below (p. 109). Again, in Fig. 9, the draughtsman has taken particular pains to set off distinctly three toes in the left front foot; and where is the bovine animal with three toes? And where is the bovine animal with a single horn, and with this peculiar shape of horn? As to Fig. 10, it presents itself as an illustration of the legend that, while the rhinoceros is gazing at the moon, the peculiar designs within its horn are formed (p. 147). This notion exclusively refers to rhinoceros-horn, so that the animal here intended can be no other than the rhinoceros.1 1 The two illustrations of T%u shu tsi ch'ing are derived, with a few slight altera? tions, from San tsxai Vu hut (section on Animals, Ch. 3, p. 7; Ch. 4, p. 12), where, curi</page><page sequence="32">i02 Chinese Clay Figures Fig. 9.

E. Heller1 states in regard to the black rhinoceros covering the whole of Africa with the exception of the Congo Basin that, although the species is almost invariably two-horned, occasional variations of one and three horned specimens are met with. In the light of this observation, Pliny's (Nat. hist., VIII, 21) notice of oxen of India, some with one horn, and others with three (Indicos boves unicornes tricornesque), is apt to lose much of the legendary character with which it was formerly charged. As far as I know, a three-horned specimen has not yet been pointed out among the species of the Indo-Malayan region; notwith? standing, the possibility remains that such may have occurred in times of antiquity. However this may be, whether we assume that the notion of a three-horned species was founded on a natural observation or not, the fact of the coincidence between Kuo P*o and Pliny remains, and hints at the existence of a tradition anent a three-horned variety in the beginning of our era.2 At any rate, whether real or imaginary, the latter is but a variation of the two-horned species; and by omitting Kuo PVs illusory "horn on the head," we arrive at a fairly accurate description of it, and then Kuo P'o exactly agrees with H? SMn's definition of the word si. And there can be no doubt of the point that ously enough, they are separated and dispersed in two different chapters. In the latter work, the horn of the se is decorated with different designs, which are white on black, while they are black on white in Txu shu. The si of San ts*ai is adorned with flamed and fluttering bands, and the crescent of the moon is absent. 1 The White Rhinoceros, p. 35 (Washington, 1913). Again on p. 17: "The num? ber of dermal horns on the snout is of less importance. These have been found to show some individual variation in the African species varying from one to three in number in the same species. The front horn, however, is nearly always the better developed and is never wanting." 2 The case could certainly be argued also from a purely philological point of view. Kuo PVs creation might be explained as an ill-advised combination of the single horned and two-horned species, or even regarded as a subsequent interpolation in his text, due to a scribe who meant to be sure of his definition being as complete as possible. Pliny's tricornis might be rationally interpreted as the result of an arithmet? ical process, providing the rhinoceros as a species of ox with two bovine horns, and adding the nose-horn as the third. In this manner Damlri's three-horned rhinoceros must have arisen (Ruska, Der Islam, Vol. IV, 1913, p. 164), for it has one horn between the eyes and two above the ears. The natural explanation based on zoologi? cal observation appeals to me to a much higher degree, for we must not be forgetful of the fact that it is impossible for the human mind to invent spontaneously such an observation; a feature of this kind, in order to be observed by man, must have some? how pre-existed in nature. It means nothing, of course, to say that the three horns are a fable; if fable it is, then how did the fable come into existence? It is not the question of a mythological conception, or of a mythical monster, but plainly of a really existing animal described in sober words. I feel confident that the three-horned variation in a living or extinct species will be found some day also in Eastern Asia.</page><page sequence="35">History of the Rhinoceros what Kuo P'o intends to describe is the two-horned species of rhinoceros, not any other animal: his statement in regard to "the horn on the nose" excludes any other idea, and the bovine animal with such a horn remains as yet to be discovered. Li Shi-ch?n of the sixteenth century, as will be seen below (p. 150), rejects the definition of Kuo P*o as erro? neous; that is to say, he did not know of any three-horned variety, and recognized in it the two-horned species. An illustration of this three horned creature may be viewed in the Wa-Kan San-sai-zu-e, the Japa? nese edition of the Chinese cyclopaedia San ts'ai fu hui.1 The defini? tion runs thus: "The rhinoceros has the hair of swine and three toes on each foot; it has the head of a horse and three horns, on the nose, the forehead, and on the skull, respectively." The three toes and three horns are exactly drawn in accordance with this prescription; curiously enough, however, the head is not that of a horse, but of a bull. The old tradition of the draughtsmen is retained in spite of the definition. Kuo P*o, in all probability, is not the first or the only author to speak of a three-horned variety. A work Kiao Kuang chi? Account of Kiao chou (northern part of what is now Annam) and Kuang-tung, reports, "In the territory of the Barbarians of the South-west occurs a strange rhinoceros with three horns emitting light at night like big torches at a distance of a thousand paces. When it sheds its horns, it hides them in a remote and dense jungle to prevent men from seeing them. The sovereigns hold this strange product in high esteem, and make it into hair-pins. These are capable of checking evil and rebel? lion. '7 Here we have the testimony of an eye-witness or one reproducing a hearsay account; and, quite correctly, he points out this variety as a freak of nature. The exact date of the work in question is unfortunately not known to me; but as the quotation is placed between one from Kuang-chi by Ku Yi-kung, who according to Bretschneider3 belonged to the Liang dynasty (502?556), and one from Kuang chou ki, a work of the Tsin period (265?419), the inference may be justifiable that Kiao Kuang chi likewise is a production of the Leu-eh*ao period. However remote from truth all these Chinese illustrations may be, most of them are fairly correct as to the outlines of the horn, naturally because 1 The illustration is easily accessible in L. Serrurier, Encyclopedic japonaise, le chapitre des quadrupedes, Plate VIII (Leiden, 1875). This cut is not contained in a recent edition of this Japanese work (Tokyo, 1906), but is replaced by a rhinoceros with two horns, the one on the forehead, the other on top of the skull. These attempts clearly prove that Japanese as well as Chinese illustrators did not draw the animal from life, but from the definitions of the books. In the Chinese San ts'ai Vu hui (Ch. 4, p. 32) only a three-horned animal (san kio shou) is depicted. 2 Quoted in the chapter on Rhinoceros in T%u shu tsi ch%$ng, 3 Bot.

As shown by the symbol illustrated in the Po ku tu lu (Fig. 18), it was pictured in early antiquity; and other representations of that period mentioned in Chinese records are discussed on p. 160. The animal lacks those aesthetic qualities of form which tempt the brush of the painter; and this may be the reason why despite the living rhinoceroses sent up as tribute to the capital (see p. 80) it has never been immortalized on any Chinese scroll known to us.2 There is, however, one case on record. Chang Shi-nan, who wrote the book Yu huan ki win early in the thir? teenth century,8 narrates that he once saw in Sze-ch'uan (Shu) the painting of an unknown artist showing the outlines of a rhinoceros with a horn on its nose.4 The inhabitants of Sze-ch'uan, accordingly, were familiar with the animal, and for this reason represented it correctly. On some Buddhist pictures it may owe its existence to a mere lucky chance; that is, to the fact that it was so copied from an Indian Buddhist model. On Yen Li-p^n's picture showing Samantabhadra's elephant,5 the rhinoceros is unmistakably contrasted with the elephant as the smaller animal with scaly body, and head surmounted by a single horn. Another illustration of the same subject is reproduced in Fig. 11 from Ch'eng shi mo yuan (Ch. 6 b, p. 16) published in the Wan li period, after 1605. Possibly it occurs also on the later typical paint? ings of Buddha's Nirv?na in the group of wailing animals.6 On the sculptures of Angkor-Vat the rhinoceros is represented as the vehicle of the god K?rttikeya.7 The Mongol emperors made practical use of the typical, conventional designs of the rhinoceros on the standards of the army: there was a standard with the picture of the animal se, " resembling an ox, with a single horn, and of dark color," and another with a picture of the 1A modern Chinese school-book published at Shanghai in 1901, and illustrated by Wu Tse-ch'eng of Su-chou, illustrates the word si with the cut of a rhinoceros of European origin, and the word se with a jovial ox of his own invention; while the text accompanying it, imbued with the spirit of the Shuo win and Erh ya, speaks of one horn on the nose and three toes. 2 It is likewise absent from classical Greek art.

The traditional reconstructions of the animal are here faithfully preserved; the three toes (the third, of course, is not visible) and the shape of the horn, though it is wrongly placed, come somewhat near the truth. The manufacturers of ink-cakes availed themselves of the same design for printing on the stuf ace of their products.

But this explanation conflicts with Chinese tradition, according to which the animal hi is a sacrificial ox; and an ox is apparently represented in this bronze.

It will certainly not induce us to propose for the word si the new translation "cervine an? imal;" but a rhinoceros of cervine character has really existed in the imagination of the ancient world. The idea started from India, has taken a footing in the classical authors, and long survived even down to our middle ages. It is a fascinating story, deserving full discussion, the more so as it has never been clearly and correctly set forth. Two classical texts may first be quoted which fit well as an explanation to our Chinese woodcut. Pliny (Nat. hist., VIII, 21) tells regarding the Orsaean Indians that "they hunt the indomitable, fierce monoceros (unicorn) which has the head of a stag, the feet of the elephant, the 1 Regarding this work and its history see T\oung Pao, 1913, p. 351.

This beast, it is asserted, cannot be captured alive."1 In the Cyranides, a curious Greek work written between 227 and 400 a.d.,2 it is said, "The rhinoceros is a quadruped resembling the stag, having a very large horn on its nose. It can be captured only by means of the perfume and the beauty of well dressed women; it is indeed much inclined toward love."3 The importance of this passage, first of all, rests on the fact that the single-horned cervine animal is here clearly identified with the rhinoceros, an identification not yet made by Pliny, who speaks of rhinoceros and monoceros as two distinct species; and we remember that Cosmas Indicopleustes makes the same distinc? tion in regard to India. In his introduction, F. de Mely4 observes that the Cyranides is the first work to reveal to us the starting-point of the legend of the chase of the unicorn which is nothing but the rhino? ceros. This, however, is very inexact. The first Occidental source relating this legend is the Physiologus which is older than the Cyranides. The Physiologus5 tells of the monoceros that it is a small animal re? sembling a buck, but very cunning; the hunter cannot approach it, as it possesses great strength; the horn grows in the centre of its head; it can be captured only by a pure virgin who suckles it; then she seizes it, and carries it into the palace of the king; or according to another version, the unicorn falls asleep while in the lap of the virgin, whereupon the hunters gradually approach and fetter it. The monoceros is located by Pliny in India; and the western legend of the unicorn ensnared by a virgin was first traced by S. Beal6 to the ancient Indian legend of Ekacringa, the hermit Single Horn. H. L?ders,7 who has traced with great ingenuity the development of the legend in the sources of Indian 1 Orsaei Indi . . . venantur asperrimam autem feram monocerotem, reliquo corpore equo similem, capite cervo, pedibus elephanto, cauda apro, mugitu gravi, uno cornu nigro media fronte cubitorum duum eminente, hanc feram vivam negant capi.

L?ders rises also against the view of Lauchert, who inter? prets the story in Physiologus from a misunderstood passage of Aelian (XVI, 20); and I am in full accord with the criticism of L?ders, to which the argument should be added that this alleged influence of Aelian on the Physiologus is out of the question, as Aelian is in time posterior to the latter.2 F. W. K. M?ller studied the same question in connection with a Japanese N? play, the plot of which is the legend of EkaQringa.3 M?ller likewise thinks Lauchert's explanation to be hardly plausible, and admits, with excellent arguments, the dependence of the Physiologus story on the tradition of India. There is but one point in which my opinion differs from the one expressed by M?ller. M?ller, at the close of his highly interesting study, advances the theory that the real unicorn, as already recognized by Marco Polo, may always have been the 1 Of the mediaeval versions, that of John Tzetzes, the Byzantine poet and gram? marian, who flourished during the twelfth century, in his Chiliades (v, 398), deserves special mention: "The monoceros carries a horn on the middle of its forehead. This animal is passionately fond of perfumes. It is hunted in this manner. A young man disguised as a woman exhaling the odor of the most exquisite perfumes takes his position in the places frequented by this quadruped. The hunters lie in ambush at a short distance. The odor of the perfumes soon attracts the monoceros toward the young man; it caresses him, and he covers its eyes with perfumed woman's gloves. The hunters hasten to the spot, seize the animal which does not offer resistance, cut off its horn, which is an excellent antidote to poison, and send it back, without in? flicting on it further harm." 2 Claudius Aelianus flourished under Septimius Severus, and probably outlived Elagabalus (218-222 a.D.). His writings come down from the beginning of the third century (Baumgarten, Poland, and Wagner, Die hellenistisch-r?mische Kultur, p. 615, Leipzig, 1913), while the Physiologus was written in Alexandria as early as the second century (ibid., p. 622). Little is known about Aelian's life; only Philostratus and Suidas have some brief notes regarding him. He availed himself of the writings of Athenaeus, who wrote at the time of Elagabalus, or in the first years of Alexander Severusl(222-235); Philostratus mentions his death in his Lives of Sophists composed between 222 and 244. As regards the Physiologus, it is necessary to discriminate between the final Greek recension clothed in a Christian-theological garb, as we have it now, and the primeval source or sources of animal stories without the allegories, from which the former was extracted. Lauchert (I. c, p. 42) certainly is quite right in rejecting the hypothesis of an " Urphysiologus" in the sense that it was a literary production serving as model to our Physiologus; but a primeval Physiologus must be presupposed for about the beginning of the first century, in the sense that it simply was an assemblage of verbal stories current in Alexandria, and some of which were imported from India (compare T'oung Pao, 1913, pp. 361-4). * Ikkaku sennin, eine mittelalterliche japanische Oper (Bastian Festschrift, PP? 5I3~538?

Keller1 has arrived at the same result, and reduced all ancient traditions and representations of the unicorn to the Indian rhinoceros. This opinion seems to me fundamentally wrong. Not one of the numerous variants of the ancient Indian tradition re? garding the Hermit Single-Hor'n alludes in this connection to the rhinoceros; he is miraculously born from a gazelle, and has received his horn from the latter.2 Single-Horn is not even his original name, but this one was Antelope-Horn (Rishya-gringa); and according to L?ders,3 the name Single-Horn has arisen from the latter, owing to popular etymological re-interpretation caused by the tradition, already appearing in the Mah?bh?rata that the penitent had a single horn on his head. In other texts, the Padmapur?na, Skandapur?na, and Kanjur, he is even equipped with two horns, while the versions of the R?m?yana and the P?li J?taka make no statement with regard to the horn. The Greek Physiologus, in the story alluded to, avails itself of the word monokeros ("unicorn")? which literally corresponds in meaning to Sanskrit Eka gringa, and describes the creature as a small animal resembling a buck, without any qualities inherent in the rhinoceros; and this is plainly corroborated by the illustration accompanying the Physiologus, in 1 Die antike Tierwelt? Vol. I, pp. 415-420; this is presumably the weakest chapter of an otherwise intelligent and excellent book. I do not understand how Keller arrives at the opinion that the ancients in general treat monoceros, unicornis, and rhinoceros as identical notions, and in most cases conceive them as the African rhinoceros. The historical connection of the unicorn legend with Ekagringa has escaped Keller en? tirely. 2 The iconography of Ekacringa in Indian art has been traced by L?ders and M?ller. It is notable that any suggestion of a rhinoceros is absent. As proved by the masks of the hermit used in the dramatic plays of Japan and Tibet (Plate X), he was conceived as a human being with a single, short, forked horn, or with a very long, curved horn. The illustration of the Japanese mask is derived from the work N?gaku dai-jiten (Dictionary of N? Plays) by Masada Sh?jir? and Amaya Kangichi (T?ky?, 1908; compare Bulletin de VEcole frangaise dKExtrime-Orienty Vol. IX, 1909, p. 607). The Tibetan mask, much worn off by long use, was obtained by me from a monastery of Bagme, in the western part of the province of Sze-ch'uan. It is very striking that the rhinoceros hardly plays any rdle in the culture-life, folk? lore, or mythology of India. The allusions to it in literary records are exceedingly sparse. The word khadga appears but a few times in Vedic literature, a rhinoceros hide being mentioned in one passage as the covering of a chariot (Macdonell and Keith, Vedic Index, Vol. I, p. 213, London, 1912). The animal is mentioned in the inscriptions of King Acoka (third century b.c.); and the consumption of its flesh, blood, and urine plays a certain r61e in Indian pharmacology (see Chakravarti, Mem. As. Soc. Beng., Vol. I, p. 370, Calcutta, 1906; and Hooper, J. As. Soc. Beng., Vol. VI, 1910, p. 518). It is very curious that no Indian record regarding rhinoceros horn cups and their antipoisonous virtues has as yet been pointed out; our information on this point rests on Ctesias, Aelian (see below, p. 115), some Arabic authors, and more recent observers like Linschoten and Garcia Ab Horto (Aromatum et simplici um aliquot medicamentorum apud Indos nascentium historia, p. 66, Antverpiae, 1567), who says, "Illud tarnen scio Bengala incolas eius cornu adversus venena usur pare, unicornu esse existimantes, tametsi non sit, ut ii referunt qui se probe scire autu mant." It remains to be pointed out also that the literatures of India contain no accounts of unicorns. 3 L. c, p. 28.</page><page sequence="43">History of the Rhinoceros which the animal is outlined as a long-tailed antelope with a large single horn curved like that of a gazelle.1 Pliny, as we saw, credits the monoceros of India with the head of a stag and a single horn on its fore? head (that is, the gazelle-horned Ekagringa), but does not identify it with the rhinoceros, which was well known to him from the circus. For the first time, as far as the West is concerned, the identification of the single-horned cervine animal with the rhinoceros is made in the Cy ranides.2 In the East, the first intimation of it leaks out in our Chinese illustration from Cheng lei pin ts'ao, which depicts the rhinoceros in the form of a deer with one horn on its forehead, and which, without any doubt, is an offshoot of the Indian conception of Ekagringa. Now, we encounter the curious fact that at a much older date also the Chinese mention a single-horned deer under the name p%ao (No. 9104), described in the Erh ya as an animal "with the tail of an ox and one horn." Pal? ladium 3 straightway translated the word by "rhinoceros," but this venture is not justified by Chinese tradition; the Chinese, in this case, make no reference whatever to the rhinoceros. On the contrary, Kuo P'o, the editor and interpreter of Erh ya, states that the animal p'ao is identical with the deer called chang (No. 407); and Yen Shi-ku (579-645), as quoted in ICang-hi's Dictionary, maintains that it re? sembles in shape the deer chang. The very definition shows that the animal p'ao is a near cousin of the kH-lin* which has likewise "the tail 1 Figured by Strzygowski, Der Bilderkreis des griechischen Physiologus, Plate XII (Byzantinische Zeitschrift, Erg?nzungsheft i, 1899), and Keller (/. c, p. 419).

Dalton, Byzan? tine Art, p. 482 (Oxford, 1911). 2 Neither Luders nor M?ller has consulted these two important passages of Pliny and the Cyranides. 8 Chinese-Russian Dictionary, Vol. I, p. 58. 4 At times a temptation was felt to identify the animal lin with the rhinoceros. Sh?n Kua, the versatile author of the Ming k% pi Van of the twelfth century, narrates that in the period Chi-ho (1054-56) the country Kiao-chi (Annam) offered a lin like an ox, having the entire body covered with large scales and a single horn on its head. There is no question that this animal was a rhinoceros; this follows also from the further observation of the author that it did not resemble the lin, as described in ancient records, and that there were people designating it as a mountain-rhinoceros (shan si, a variety recognized also by Li Shi-ch?n). But as Sh?n Kua could not trace any report in which scales are attributed to the rhinoceros (for explanation see p. 149), he formed the erroneous theory that the animal in question was identical with the THen-lu cast in bronze by the Emperor Ling in 186 a.d., a specimen of which he had beheld at Nan-yang in T&amp;ng chou in Ho-nan. In a similar manner, Fan Ch?n of the Sung period, in his work Tung chai hi shi (Ch. 1, p. 8; in Shou shan ko ts%ung shut Vol. 84), tells the story of two KH4in sent as tribute from Kiao-chi in the period Kia yu (1056-63), which he had occasion to see in the imperial palace. He describes them as having the shape of water-buffalo clad with a fleshy armor, and equipped with a single horn on the extremity of the nose; they subsisted on grass, fruit, and melon, and every time before feeding had to be beaten on their horns with a stick. This writer likewise concludes with a discussion, in which serious doubts of the identifica? tion of these animals with the lin are expressed.</page><page sequence="44">ii4 Chinese Clay Figures of an ox and a single horn."1 Indeed in the Erh yu Vu, both creatures are figured almost alike, and agree in their essential characteristics. It is obvious that, as iconographic types, these creatures are not derived from any rhinoceros, but point in the direction of the fabulous one horned monsters (known in archaeology as "Oriental animals") de? veloped in the art of Mesopotamia.2 In regard to the type of kH-lin, this has been aptly pointed out by A. Gr?nwedel;3 and as the same West-Asiatic forms found their way into the art of India, we here have the basis for the origin of the single-horned gazelle (deer or antelope) transferred to, or personified in, the person of Ekagringa. In Baby? lonia, these types of unicorn are very ancient, going back to the third millennium b.c.,4 and could not have been developed there from a rhinoceros. The conclusion therefore presents itself that the notion of a unicorn cervine animal which was developed in Western Asia from remote times spread together with artistic motives into India and China,5 while the identification of this fabulous creature with the 1 Regarding the kH-lin see Yen Shi-ku (in TsHen Han shu, Ch. 6, p. 5 b); Mayers (Chinese Reader's Manual, p. 127); P. W. K. M?ller (in Feestbundel aan P. J. Veth, p. 222, Leiden, 1894); ^E Groot (The Religious System of China, Vol. II, pp. 822 4); and H. Dore (Recherches sur les superstitions en Chine, pt. 1, Vol. II, pp. 446-8). I do not subscribe to everything that the last two authors say about the subject. The Chinese illustrations are reproduced in C. Gould (Mythical Monsters, pp. 350, 353, 354, London, 1886). 2 A distinction must be made between iconographic or archaeological type or artistic representation, and traditions or speculations regarding such a type. The tin, as early mentioned in Shi king and Li ki, may very well be an indigenous Chinese thought. Nevertheless its subsequent portrayal in art rests on a borrowed type, which has again fertilized native ideas as to form and behavior of the creature. An interesting example of the fact that iconography and literary tradition may move along lines widely different and emanating from diverse sources is afforded by the unicorn of Europe. The unicorn tradition of the Physiologus is traceable to India; the iconography of the creature, however, has no connection with Indian art, but leans in the beginning toward the ancient West-Asiatic types. Throughout the middle ages, there is not a trace of the rhinoceros in the representations of the unicorn (compare Marco Polo's astonishment when he saw the ugly beast on Java, "not in the least like that which our stories tell of as being caught in the lap of a virgin, in fact, altogether different from what we fancied"); now it is an antelope, now an ox, now a narwhal, now a hybrid formation composed of various creatures. My opinion in this respect deviates from the one expressed by Strzygowski (I. c.) that there may be interaction between the animal types of the earliest Buddhist art in India and those of the Physiologus. It is not there the question of interaction, but of affinity, solely caused by West-Asiatic productions which both have in common as their source. 3 Bemerkungen ?ber das Kilin (Feestbundel aan P. J.

In the Erh ya is defined an animal called chui (written with the classifier 'horse' and the phonetic complement sui, No. 10,388), 4 like a horse with a single horn; those without horn are spotted." Kuo P'o comments,</page><page sequence="45">History of the Rhinoceros "5 rhinoceros ? owing to the single horn ? is the product of a much later period; this is not the starting-point, but the final result of the matter. It is, of course, necessary to assume that this result was brought about in India itself; 1 otherwise it would be unintelligible why it appears on the surface in the Cyranides and in China.2 In my opinion, we are even "In the eighth year of the period Yuan-k*ang (298 a.d.) it was in the territory of Kiu-ch&amp;n (in Tonking) that hunters captured a wild animal of the size of a horse with one horn, the horn being soft as the core of the young antlers of the deer (lu jung). This is identical with the animal chui. At present men sometimes meet it in the dense mountainous jungles, and there are among them also those without horn." Kiu-ch?n is situated imTonking; and on p. 81 mention has been made of the tribute of a live rhi? noceros sent from there to the Emperor Ling (168-188 a.d.); indeed, that region was always famed for this animal, which is apparently intended in the text of Kuo P'o. The same conception of the rhinoceros as a horse or horse-like animal with a single horn is met likewise in the West. The ancients enumerate altogether five animals as having single horns, the Indian ass first traceable to Ctesias, the single-horned ox, the monoceros, the single-horned horse, and the oryx of Africa. Strabo (xv, 56) quotes from Megasthenes' remarks upon Indian animals that there are horses in India with one horn. Aelian (Nat. anim., in, 41) says, "India, it is reported, pro? duces horses with a single horn, likewise single-horned asses. Cups are made from these horns; and if a mortal poison is poured into them, it will do no harm to him who drinks it, for the horn of both animals seems to be an antidote against poison." In another chapter (xvi, 20) Aelian describes the unicorn of the Indians, "called by them kartazonos [a word apparently connected with Assyrian kurkizannu, mentioned above, p. 87J, said to equal in size a full-grown horse." Horace (Serm., 1, 5, 58-60) speaks of a wild horse having a single horn in the midst of its forehead. As a matter of fact, the rhinoceros has no similarity to a horse; and it is difficult to see how the simile could ever arise. The bare fact remains, however, that it did; but it is incon? ceivable that this notion, not founded on a natural observation, could spontaneously spring up in the West and East alike. There is no other way out of this puzzle than to presume that India, to which the account of Megasthenes reproduced by Strabo and Aelian refers, is responsible for this idea, and disseminated it to the West and to China. 1 It may be pointed out in this connection, though it is not wholly conclusive for the present case, that the Sanskrit word v?rdhr?nasa means a rhinoceros and an old white goat-buck. 2 We meet also in ancient China a unicorn conceived of as a wild goat. This is the animal termed chai (No. 245) and Mai (No. 4423) chai. The fundamental passage relating to it is in the Annals of the Later Han Dynasty (Hou Han shu, Ch. 40, p. 3), where a judicial cap in the shape of this animal, and worn by the censors, is mentioned. The definition given of the animal in the text of the Annals is, "A divine goat (shin yang) which is able to discriminate between right and wrong, and which the king of Ch'u used to capture." Huai-nan-tse is quoted in K*ang-hi (under Mai) as saying that King Wen of Ch'u was fond of wearing Mai caps; the un-Chinese word Mai chai, therefore, will probably be a word of the language of Ch'u (T. de Lacouperie, Les langues de la Chine avant les Chinois, p. 17, Paris, 1888), as above all proved by the vacillating modes of writing (Forke, Lun-heng, pt. II, p. 321). The comment added to the text of Hou Han shu is extracted from I wu chi, which may be read in Schle gel's Uranographie chinoise, p. 587 (it is, of course, impossible, as proposed by Schle? gel, to identify the animal with the Tibetan chiru; see below, p. 120). It is not stated in Hou Han shu nor in / wu chi (nor in K'ang-hi) that "it eats fire in its ravenous fury, even to its own destruction" (Giles). This is a subsequent addition which arose un? der the influence of Buddhist art. F. W. K. M?ller (Feestbundel aan P. J. Veth, p. 222, Leiden, 1894) has recognized correctly that this explanation is derived from the iconography of the animal, which is represented as being surrounded by flames. M?ller, however, omits to state that this is a secondary development, which has nothing to do with the previous pre-Buddhistic conception of the creature on Chinese soil, when it was not equipped with flames, nor set in relation with a lion. The</page><page sequence="46">n6 Chinese Clay Figures forced to admit that the counterpart to the illustration of the Chlng lei pin ts'ao has already pre-existed in India, and was transmitted from there to China; for neither the author of that work, nor any other Chinese source, as far as I know, furnishes any explanation for this picture. An unexpected confirmation of this opinion comes to us from another quarter,? Tibet. In the Tibetan language we meet the word bse-ru which at present denotes two animals,?first, the rhinoceros, and second, a kind of antelope. The former is the original and older significance, the latter is secondary. The second element of the compound, ru, means "horn," and may be dropped; the proper word is bse (pronounced se). The stem is se, the prefixed labial 6- not being part of the word-stem, and like most prefixes in Tibetan nouns, representing the survival of an ancient numerative. This is corroborated by the corresponding Lepcha word sa and the Chinese word se, all three referring to the rhinoceros. This linguistic coincidence leads to the conclusion that the Chinese and Tibetans as stocks of the large Indo-Chinese family of peoples were acquainted with the rhinoceros in prehistoric times, for otherwise they could not have the word for it in common; and this conclusion will be fully upheld by our historical inquiry into the subject. This fact of comparative philology is also apt to refute the supposition of Mr. Giles that "a term which originally meant a bovine animal was later on wrongly applied to the rhinoceros." As proved by comparison with the Tibetan and Lepcha words, the Chinese term originally must have designated the rhinoceros.1 Above all it is incumbent upon me to demonstrate that the Tibetan word bse really designates the rhinoceros, and that the Tibetans were familiar with this animal. The ancient translation "lion-unicorn" adopted by M?ller is not to the point, as far as the time of Chinese antiquity is concerned. The Mai chai is not explained as a lion (nor could this be expected, as the lion was unknown in ancient China), but as a divine wild goat (shin yang). The fact that the conception of the animal existed among the Chinese in times prior to the contact with India is clearly proved by the occurrence of the word in Huai-nan-tse, in Tso chuan (S?an Wang 17th year: Legge, Chinese Classics, Vol. V, p. 332), Se-ma Ts'ien's SM M (Ch. 117), Lun hing, Hou Han shu, Erh ya, and Shuo win. Only in such late compilations as the Japanese version of the San tsKai Vu hui do we meet the statement that the animal resembles a lion, merely because it is sketched like a lion crowned with a single horn (see L. Sekrurier, Encycl. japonaise, le chapitre des quadrupedes, Plate III; or E. Kaempfer, The History of Japan, Vol. I, p. 195, Glasgow, 1906). The connection of this creature with the rhinoceros, and its transformation into a goat, will be discussed below (p. 171). 1 The hypothesis of such "confusions," which are usually assumed to suit one's own convenience, is untenable also for other reasons obvious to every ethnologist: people in the primitive stages of culture, being nearer to nature than we, are surely the keenest observers of animal life and habits, and will most assuredly never con? found a bovine animal with a rhinoceros; they may, by way of explanation, compare the one with the other, but from comparison to confusion is a wide step.</page><page sequence="47">History of the Rhinoceros 117 Sanskrit-Tibetan dictionary Mah?vyutpatti1 renders the Tibetan word bse by the Sanskrit word ganda which refers to the rhinoceros.2 Wherever this word appears in the works of Sanskrit Buddhist litera? ture, it is faithfully reproduced in the Tibetan translations by the word bse. An interesting example of its application appears in a Tibetan work from the first part of the ninth century.3 It is well known that in India the Pratyeka-Buddha was styled Single-Horn Hermit and com? pared with the solitary rhinoceros;4 and this simile is explained in that Tibetan book in the words that the Pratyeka-Buddha, who in the course of a hundred eons (kalpa), through the accumulation of merit, is no longer like ordinary beings, resembles the rhinoceros in his.habit of living in the same solitary abode. It is interesting to note that in this early Tibetan text the word bse-ru is used for the designation of the rhinoceros. This comparison has passed into Tibetan poetry, and is frequently employed by the mystic and poet Milaraspa, who speaks of himself as being "lonely like a rhinoceros."5 This meaning of bse is confirmed by two Chinese lexicographical sources, ? the Hua i yi y?, which in its Tibetan-Chinese vocabulary6 renders bse-ru by Chinese si niu; and the Polyglot Dictionary of the Emperor K'ien-lung (Ch. 31, p. 4 a), where bse is explained by Chinese si ("rhinoceros"). The national Tibetan word bse, akin to Lepcha sa and Chinese se, naturally bears out the fact that the ancient Tibetans were familiar with the 1 Tanjur (Palace edition), S?tra, Vol. 123, fol. 265 a. This work was written in the first part of the ninth century. 2 Al-Ber?nl (Sachau, Alberuni's India, Vol. I, p. 203) knew this word, and cor? rectly described under it the rhinoceros of India (p. 95). It is likewise mentioned by Garcia Ab Horto (/. c.) and other early European travellers enumerated by Yule and Burnell (Hobson-Jobson, p. 363). The rhinoceros brought to Portugal in 1515 (mentioned above, p. 83) was labelled "rhinocero, called in Indian gomda." 3 Entitled Sgra sbyor bam-po gnis-pa (Tanjur, S?tra, Vol. 124, fol. 14 a, 4), cor? rectly dated by G. Huth (Sitzungsberichte der preussischen Akademie, 1895, p. 277) in the first part of the ninth century. Compare also the application of the word in T?ran?tha (Schiefner's translation, p. 245): the sorcerer Ri-ri-pa summoned the fierce beasts of the forest, the rhinoceros and others, and mounted on their backs. 4 Eitel, Hand-book of Chinese Buddhism (pp. 76, 123, 197); F. W. K. M?ller, Ikkaku sennin (/. c, p. 530); and H. Kern, Manual of Indian Buddhism (pp. 61 and 62, note 1). 5 G. Sandberg (Tibet and the Tibetans, p. 297), who is ignorant of the fact that bse or bse-ru means' 'rhinoceros/' and who merely carries the modern popular meaning of the word, "antelope," into the sphere of literature, makes Milaraspa say that he is "lonely as a seru" (antelope). The antelope, however, is not a lonely, but a highly social animal living in herds. Nowhere in Buddhist literature has bse-ru the signifi? cance of' 'antelope,'' but only that of "rhinoceros.'' The Tibetan poet, who in every line is imbued with the language and spirit of India, most obviously intends with this simile a literary allusion to the Buddhist comparison of the Pratyeka-Buddha with the rhinoceros. 8 Copied by me from the manuscript deposited by Hirth in the Royal Library of Berlin.

We know that the primeval habitat of the Tibetan stock was located along the upper course of the Huang-ho (where Ptolemy knows them as Bautai, derived from the native name Bod, "Tibetans;" the Yellow River is styled by him Bautisos), as well as along the upper Yang tse. There they lived in close proximity to the ancient Chinese; and in that locality, as will be established from Chinese records, the rhi? noceros was their contemporary. Large parts of the present Chinese provinces of Kan-su and Sze-ch'uan are still settled by Tibetan tribes; and we shall see that the rhinoceros occurred there in the times of antiquity, and long survived, even down to the middle ages. The Pai lan ? a tribe belonging to the Tibetan group of the Klang, and border? ing in the north-east on the Tu-y?-hun ? in 561 a.d. sent an embassy to China to present a cuirass of rhinoceros-hide (si kid) and iron armor.1 Whether they had made this cuirass themselves, or had received it from an outside source (this fact is not indicated), this tribute, at any rate, shows that they were acquainted with this material and its manu? factures.2 The Pin ts*ao yen i of 1116 extols the horns of the Tibetan breed of rhinoceros for the fine quality of the natural designs displayed in them (see p. 148). Li Shi-eh6n, in his Pen ts'ao kang mu (see p. 149), expressly names as habitats of the rhinoceros the regions of the Si Fan and Nan Fan; that is, the western and southern Tibetans,?the former scattered over Sze-ch'uan and Y?n-nan with their borderlands, the latter peopling the valley of the Tsang-po (Brahmaputra) and the Himalayan tracts adjoining India. Indeed, down to the middle of the nineteenth century, or even later, the rhinoceros was to be met with along the foot of the Himalaya as far west as Rohilkund and Nepal; and it survived longer still in the Terai of Sikkim.4 J. Ch. White 4 notes the 1 Chou shu, Ch. 49, p. 5 b. 2 In the year 824 the Tibetans offered to the Chinese Court silver-cast figures of a rhinoceros and a stag (T'angshu, Ch. 216 B, p. 6 b). Bushell (The Early History of Tibet, p. 88) translates the word si in this passage by "yak," but this point of view is not admissible. True it is that some modern Chinese writers on Tibet call the yak si niu, but this usage of the word is not earlier than the eighteenth century. The T'ang Annals, however, persistently designate the Tibetan yak by the word li niu (No. 6938); and in the very passage alluded to, the gift of the rhinoceros and stag silver figures is immediately followed by the words, "and they brought as tribute a yak" (kung li niu), which Bushell correctly interprets likewise as yak. The words si and li niu in the same sentence cannot possibly refer to the same animal; and it becomes evident from a consideration of all Chinese sources concerned that down to the end of the Ming dynasty the Chinese word si with reference to Tibet and Tibetan tribes invariably denotes the rhinoceros, and nothing else. Rhinoceros-horn was formerly included among the tribute gifts which the Dalai Lamas of Tibet were obliged to send to China; it took its place between coral, genuine pearls, precious stones, amber, etc. (Wei Tsang Vu chi, 1792, Ch. a, p. 17). 3 R.

In Tibet proper, the animal does not occur at present, but fossil remains of it were discovered at high elevations by Sir R. Strachey near the source of the Tsang-po.1 The early Tibetan translators, when they correctly rendered the Sanskrit word ganda by bse} must have entertained an exact notion or reminiscence of the rhinoceros; but the animal, as every? where, became rapidly exterminated in those territories where Tibetans had occasion to behold and to hunt it, while the inhabitants of Central Tibet seldom or never had this opportunity. For this reason, also in Tibet, the rhinoceros underwent the process of fabulous "unicorniza tion." Reports of a Tibetan unicorn greatly stirred the imagination of European explorers, and gave rise to wild speculations. Captain S. Turner,2 I believe, was the first to circulate such a report, being in? formed by the Raja of Bh?tan that he was in possession of a unicorn, a sort of horse, with a horn growing from the middle of its forehead; it was kept at some distance from Tassisudon, the capital, and the people paid it religious respect, but Turner had no occasion to see it. The Lazarist fathers Hue and G?bet, who reached Lhasa in 1846, are said to have even claimed the discovery in Tibet of the unicorn of Scripture. Major Latter, in the first part of the nineteenth century, was very sanguine of being able to find a veritable unicorn in the interior of Tibet: he was advised by a native that he had often seen these an? imals, which "were fierce and exceedingly wild and seldom taken alive, but frequently shot;" and that they are commonly met with on the borders of the great desert, about a mile from Lhasa. From a drawing which accompanied Major Latter's communication, the presumed unicorn was something like a horse, but with cloven hoofs, a long, curved horn growing out of the forehead, and a boar-shaped tail. Un? der the heading "Unicorns in Asia,"3 a writer revived the opinion of the existence of veritable unicorns, such as were reported to Major Latter: the animal in question was of the deer kind, having a single horn at the top of the head; it was known by the name of the Seru.4 Then 1A. R. Wallace (The Geographical Distribution of Animals, Vol. II, p. 214; also Vol. I, p. 122) refers to this in the words that more than twenty species of extinct rhinoceroses are known, and that one has even been found at an altitude of 16,000 feet in Tibet. Mr. L. A. Waddell (Lhasa and its Mysteries, p. 315) has this sugges? tive remark: "The dense rank growth of wildflowers and weeds along the borders of the fields was such as to make this part of the Tsang-po oasis a quite suitable habitat for the rhinoceros, and to bring the discovery of the fossil remains of that animal by Sir R. Strachey near the source of this river into harmony with present-day facts." 2 An Account of an Embassy to the Court of the Teshoo Lama, p. 157 (London, 1800). 8 Asiatic Journal, Vol. II, 1830. 4 Compare W.

In Anglo-Indian nomenclature we now find two words in use, chiru and seru, the latter also Anglicized as serow, on which Yule, in his "Hobson-Jobson," unfortunately has not commented. Serow has be? come a household stock-word of the Anglo-Indian sportsman to denote a large variety of different Indian, Burmese, and Tibetan antelopes.6 G. Sandberg7 recognizes in it the Tibetan word bse-ru, and identifies the latter with the species Nemorhaedus bubalinus.

On p. 298 he points out that the word chiru should be written gcig ru ("one horn"). This derivation is impossible, as "one horn " can be in Tibetan only ru (or rva) gcig, or ru zig. The name Ekagringa is rendered in? to Tibetan Rva gcig-pa. (Compare also Hor c*os byun, ed. Huth, p. 16, 1.14.) Chiru is simply a local or dialectic variation of se-ru. Strange words exert a singular fascina? tion upon the human mind. The Anglo-Indian chiru has had several good fortunes. Thanks to the imaginative powers of G. Schlegel (Uranographie chinoise, p. 587), it has found cheerful hospitality in Chinese astronomy, the Chinese animal Mai being wrongly identified with it. A few years ago the chiru was deemed worthy of the honor of being admitted into the sanctum of classical philology. O. Keller (Die antike Tierwelt, Vol. I, p. 293) identifies the Indian Oryx mentioned by Aelian, and the Oryx on the Hydaspes mentioned by Timotheus, with the Tibetan chiru,? a venture which has no foundation; in fact, the oryx of Aelian is located in India, and corresponds to the Indian black-buck. 8 Tibetan-English Dictionary, p. 593.

Both lexicographers, in this respect, rely on the statements of the European sportsmen, but leave us in the dark as to the opinion of the Tibetans on the point. The question arises, ? Do those European speculations on a Tibetan unicorn identified with an antelope styled se-ru have any foundation in a Tibetan tradi? tion? The French Missionaries, in their Tibetan Dictionary (p. 1056), give a slight intimation of the existence of such a tradition by remarking that the animal bse-ru is believed in Tibet to belong to the genus of goats {ex genere caprarum), but that nobody has ever seen it; the latter clause doubtless means that nobody has encountered this wild goat in the shape of a unicorn which it is fabled to be. I. J. Schmidt1 had a certain presentiment of the matter when he annotated a passage in his translation of the Geser Saga, that the Tibetan and Mongol name of the unicorn is seruy that the existence of this animal in the wild moun? tains of Tibet is asserted in Tibetan books, but that the description given of it does not at all fit the rhinoceros. The unicorn which stopped Chinggis Khan on his expedition to Tibet and induced him to return,2 judging from the description given by the Tibetan historian,3 is identical with the Chinese k'i-lin, as already recognized by G. Schlegel.4 Another association of the unicorn with Tibet appears on the tribute painting ascribed to Li Kung-lin (Li Lung-mien), where Bonin5 has pointed it out among the envoys from the Kingdom of Women. In the Polyglot Dictionary of the Emperor K'ien-lung6 we find the Tibetan 1 Die Thaten Bogda Gesser Chan's, p. 56 (St. Petersburg, 1839). Compare also p. 125. 2 G.

According to Chinese tradition, however (see the texts of Kui sin tsa chi and Chxo keng hi, in T*u shti tsi ch'?ng, Chapter kio Luan, ki ski, p. 1 b), the marvellous animal opposing the conqueror belonged to the class of unicorns (kio tuan), and is described as a hundred feet high, with a single horn like that of the rhinoceros, and able to speak a human language. 6 Le royaume des neiges, pp. 40, 299 (Paris, 1911). M. Bonin's description of this painting is based on a copy of it in the Mus6e Guimet, which is certainly not the original from the hand of Li Kung-lin; it is a much later and somewhat weak copy, as stated also by Tchang Yi-Tchou and Hackin (La peinture chinoise au Mus?e Gui? met, p. 59). On Plate V of the latter publication, the portion of the picture illustrat? ing the envoys of the Kingdom of Women is reproduced; the unicorn is a wretched production. Mr. Freer of Detroit owns two copies of the same painting, both far superior to the one in the Mus?e Guimet. One of these offers such high qualities as come very near to an original.

Pozdnayev (Vol. I, p. 288). The Mongol equivalent of Tibetan bse-ru and Chinese si kio is here bodi g?r?g?s?n ("the animal of the bodhi," Sanskrit bodhimriga); that is, the gazelle.

These are,? the Buddha Amit?yus (the Buddha of Endless Life), the long-lived wishing-tree (dpag bsam lin tsle rin) figured as a peach-tree in Chinese style, the long-lived rocks (brag ts'e rin), the Chinese God of Longevity Shou-sing (in Tibetan Mi ts'e rin) seated on a mat and holding a rosary, a pair of cranes (krun krun ts*e rin) pecking at some peaches (k'am-bu) that are planted in a jar, and a pair of bse-ru. Though apparently inspired by the deer, which is the emblem of the Chinese God of Longevity, their outlines considerably differ from the latter, and approach the Tibetan notion of the appearance of a'bse-ru;1 but, curiously enough, they are without any horns. There can be little doubt, ac? cordingly, that in recent times, when the rhinoceros had almost vanished from the memory of the Tibetan people, the word bse-ru was transferred to a species of deer or antelope; and, as the ancient tradition of the bse-ru being a single-horned animal had persisted through the centuries, the single horn, in popular imagination, was fixed on the antelope. When we inquire why it was just the antelope, and not any other animal on which the idea of a unicorn was projected, the story of Ekagringa pre? sents itself again as the happiest solution. We know that this legend, in a Tibetan translation, has been incorporated in the Kanjur; and A, Schiefner 2 has translated it from this version. It is likewise extant in Kshemendra's Avad?nakalpalat?, of which a literal versified rendering, and an abridged prose edition made for children by order of the Fifth Dalai Lama, exist in the Tibetan language. This plain version has ren? dered the story immensely popular among Tibetans; and, as pointed out, it is current also in a dramatized form. The Tibetan mask of Ekagringa (Plate X) is equipped with an unmistakable antelope-horn.3 The psychological process is therefore quite clear.

Gr?nwedel, in his Russian Description of the Lamaist Collec? tion of Prince Uchtomski (Bibl. BuddMca, No. 6, p. 26), has figured a similar woodcut, but without explanation. The God of Longevity bears the Mongol legend Tsaghan ?bugh?n ("The White Old Man"), who is certainly, as stated on p. 117, a national Mongol deity; but from an iconographic point of view, as he appears in Grunwedel's drawing, he is nothing but a copy of the well-known Chinese God of Longevity. 2 In Ralston, Tibetan Tales, p. 253. 3 On the lid of a Tibetan censer in the Field Museum (Cat.

One of these is provided with a single horn on its forehead; the other, apparently conceived as the doe, is hornless. The former seems suggested again by a reminiscence of Ekagringa, but it is not known to me whether the Tibetans would name it bse-ru. Other Tibetan censers are surmounted by a monster of Chinese style, showing a horn on its nose and another on its forehead,? manifestly derived from the two-horned rhinoceros.</page><page sequence="54">124 Chinese Clay Figures ually forgotten by the people, the word bse or bse-ru of this meaning continued in literature; the people retained the recollection of its being a single-horned animal, and in their attempts at finding this creature, the legend of Hermit Single-Horn, the son of an antelope or gazelle, flashed into their minds; so that the unicorn bse-ru was finally identified with a species of antelope named for this reason bse-ru. This unicorn bse-ru we now recognize also in the Chinese drawing of Cheng lei pin ts'ao (Fig. 13). Since the proof is now established that the interaction and intermingling of deer and rhinoceros have taken place in China, in Tibet, and in the West with the first conspicuous allusion in the Cy ranides,1 and that this process of adjustment and affiliation has radiated from the Indian legend of Single-Horn born from a gazelle, we are justi? fied in concluding that the foundation, or at least the commencement, of this transformation, must have arisen in India. The development of the matter in Tibet shows sufficiently that Ekacringa is disguised also under our Chinese illustration. So much about the latter. A most interesting psychological parallel to the representations of the rhinoceros in China is formed by the ostrich. We now know from the reproductions of Chavannes2 that in the T'ang period the ostrich was chiselled in stone in a very naturalistic manner on the imperial burial-places (Fig. 15).3 1A counterpart of the rhinoceros of cervine character occurs also among the Arabs. In Ethiopic, the word chartsh corresponds to the monokeros of the Sept?aginta (Job, xxxix, 9), and in all probability signifies the1 'rhinoceros." According to Qazwlnl, charish is an animal of the size of a ram, of great strength and swiftness, with a single horn on its forehead like the horn of the rhinoceros (karkadan). Some Arabic lexicog? raphers even take it for a marine animal, others identify it directly with the rhinoce? ros. Hommel (Die Namen der S?ugetiere bei den s?dsemitischen V?lkern, p. 333, Leipzig, 1879), to whom this information is due, regards the Arabic word as a loan from Ethiopic. Damiri, in his Lexicon of Animals, avails himself of this word in trans? lating the text of the Physiologus regarding the unicorn (K. Ahrens, Das Buch der Naturgege^ist?nde, p. 43). What escaped Hommel is the fact that Cosmas Indico pleustes (McCrindle, Ancient India as described in Class. Lit., p. 157) states that the Ethiopians, in their language, call the rhinoceros arou or harisi. G. Jacob (Studien in arabischen Geographen IV, p. 166, Berlin, 1892) holds that Qazwlnl is the only Arabic author to discriminate between chartsh and the rhinoceros, and identifies the former with the Saiga-antelope of southern Russia. The rendering "unicorn" by the Seventy and the English Bible is erroneous. The Hebrew word, thus translated, is reem, corresponding to Assyrian rlmu. It is now generally interpreted as a wild buffalo, and on the basis of Assyrian monuments is ingeniously identified with Bos primigenius by J. U. D?rst (Die Rinder von Babylonien, pp. 8-11, Berlin, 1899). The animal, called in Hebrew behemoth (Job, xl, 15-24), and formerly taken for the rhinoceros (p. 83), is the hippopotamus of the Nile. The Bible does not mention the rhinoceros or the unicorn. 2 Mission archSologique, Nos. 458, 459, 472,481. 3 These ostriches belong to the very best ever executed in the history of art. They are much superior to any representations of the bird by the Egyptians (O. Keller, Die antike Tierwelt, Vol. II, p. 170), the Assyrians (P. S. P.

After he had negotiated his treaties with the countries of the west, the King of Parthia (An-si) sent an embassy to the Chinese Court and presented large bird's eggs,1 which most probably were ostrich eggs. A live Fig. 15. Ostrich sculptured in Stone, T'ang Period (Sketch after Chavannes, Mission, No. 472). specimen (or specimens) of the "large bird of T'iao-chi" was despatched as tribute from the same country in 101 a.D., and termed in China "Parthian bird."2 They are not made after any western artistic models, but constitute invincible proof for the fact that the Chinese artists in the T'ang era observed and studied nature, and worked after natural models. This case may be recommended for due considera? tion to the adherents of the preconceived dogma that all Chinese art is copied from that of the west, and that no art is possible outside of the sanctum of classical art. 1 Ski ki, Ch. 123, p. 6; Hirth, China and the Roman Orient, p. 169. Forke (Mitteilungen des Seminars, Vol. VII, 1904, p. 139) wrongly says that the Ski ki mentions "large birds (ostriches) with eggs as large as earthen pots as a peculiar fejature of T'iao-chi;" this is not in the text of the Ski ki, which speaks only of large bird's eggs, but it is found in Ts%ien Han sku (Ch. 96 a, p. 6 a). The trade in ostrich eggs in the west is of very ancient date (O. Keller, /. c, p. 168). 2 Hou Han sku, Ch. 118, p. 9; Chavannes, T*oung Pao, 1907, p. 178. M. Cha vannes advances the theory that the Chinese erroneously applied to the ostrich the</page><page sequence="56">I2? Chinese Clay Figures It was styled also "great horse bird."1 Its resemblance to the camel was emphasized, and hence the name u camel-bird" was formed. Living ostriches were sent to China again in the T*ang period. In 650 Tokh?ra offered large birds seven feet high, of black color, with feet resembling those of the camel, marching with outspread wings, able to run three hundred U a day, and to swallow iron; they were styled camel birds.2 The T'ang artists, accordingly, were in a position to witness and to study live specimens of the bird; and the fact that they really did so leaks out in the realistic high-relief carvings referred to above. But what do we find among the latter-day draughtsmen who en? deavored to illustrate the creature for books? Fig. 16 shows the woodcut with which the Pin ts'ao kang mu of Li Shi-cMn is adorned. Bretschneider (I. c.), in a somewhat generous spirit, designated it as "a rude, but tolerably exact drawing of the camel-bird." Forke 3 holds that this ostrich is pictured like a big goose, but with the feet of a mammal; and he comes far nearer to the truth. Li Shi-cMn, born in K?i chou in the province of Hu-pei, spent his life name "bird of Parthia" (An-si, Arsak), but that in faet these birds originated from T'iao-chi, that is, Desht Misan or Mesene, where ruled Arabic princes who had all facilities for obtaining ostriches from Arabia. This theory does not seem necessary to me. As already observed by Bretschneider (Notes and Queries, Vol. IV, p. 53; and Mediaeval Researches, Vol. I, pp. 144-145), the ostrich is described in Wei shu as a bird indigenous to Persia (compare also Sui shu, Ch. 83, p. 7 b; Pei shi, Ch. 97, p. 8), and is again mentioned in the T*ang Annals as a Persian bird; there is, on the other hand, the testimony of the Persian authors and of Xehophon (Anabasis, i, 5), who saw the bird on the banks of the Euphrates; and up to the present time, ostriches are met with, though not frequently, in western Asia. Handcock (L c, p. 25) ob? serves that the ostrich appears in Mesopotamian art at a late period, though in Elam rows of ostriches are found depicted on early pottery, closely and inexplicably re? sembling the familiar ostriches on the pre-\lynastic pottery of ancient Egypt; it sometimes, however, assumes a conspicuous position in the embroidery of an Assyrian king's robe, and is found also on a chalcedony seal in Paris. Further references to Assyrian representations are given by O. Keller (/. c, pp. 172, 594). In ancient Syria, the ostrich is well attested by the interesting description in Job (xxxix, 13-18), ? Moses prohibited the flesh of the bird as unclean food,? and by reliefs at Hiera polis of Roman times. It further occurs in the Syrian version of the Physiologus. Brehm (Tierleben, Vol. III, p. 692) sums up, "In Asia, the area of the habitat of the ostrich may formerly have been much more extended than at present; but even now, as established by Hartlaub with as much diligence as erudition, it occurs in the deserts of the Euphrates region, especially the Bassida and Dekhena, in all suitable localities of Arabia, and finally in some parts of southern Persia. V?mbery even learned that it is still sometimes found on the lower course of the Oxus, in the region of Kungrad (?), and is named there camel or coffer bird." Also in the Encyclopaedia Britannica (Vol. XX, p. 362) it is said, "It is probable that it still lingers in the wastes of Kirwan in eastern Persia, whence examples may occasionally stray north? ward to those of Turkestan, even near the lower Oxus." 1 TsHen Han shu, Ch. 96 a, p. 6 b. In this passage the bird is noticed as a native of Parthia, an,d commented on by Yen Shi-ku. 2 Chavannes, Documents, p. 156.

The chances are that he had never seen the sculptures of ostriches in the mausolea of the T'ang emperors near Li-ts'?an, Shen-si Province; but, be this as it may, his woodcut proves that the T'ang tradition of the representation of the ostrich was wholly unknown to him, and moreover, that he himself had never be? held an ostrich. We have no records to the effect that ostriches were transported to China during the Ming period; and they were then probably known merely by name. Li Shi-ch?n's production is simply a reconstruction based on the definitions of the texts ("marching with outspread wings, feet of a camel,,, etc.); the only exact feature is the two toes, which are mentioned also in the older descriptions of the bird; everything else, notably the crane's head, is absurd, and a naturalist of the type of Bretschneider should have noticed this. In the great cyclopaedia T%u shu tsi chxing, published in 1726, we find a singular illustration of the ostrich, which is reproduced in Fig. 17 as an object-lesson in Chinese psychology. This accomplishment must open every one's eyes: here we plainly see that the illustrator had not pIG. i6. the slightest idea of the appearance of an ostrich, ?strichj^ is ao but merely endeavored, with appalling result, to outline a sketch of what he imagined the "camel-bird" should look like. He created a combination of a camel and a bird by illustrating the bare words, as they struck his ears, without any recourse to facts and logic; he committed the logical blunder (so common among the Chinese from the days of the Sung period) of confounding a descriptive point of similarity with a feature of reality. All Chinese texts are agreed on the point that the bird is just like a camel, or conveys that impression. This case is most instructive in disclosing the working of the minds of the recent Chinese illustrators, and in exhibiting the value due to their productions. It would not do in the present case to deny that this figure is intended for an ostrich, to define it as a new animal species, a " bird-shaped biped camel" (something like an Avi-camelus bipes), and to conclude that the Chinese term fo niao does not denote the ostrich. On the contrary, we have to con? clude that illustrations of this character are out and out valueless for our scientific purposes, that definitions of an animal cannot be deduced from them, but that all reasoning on the nature of the respective animal</page><page sequence="58">128 Chinese Clay Figures Fig. 17.

Another impressive lesson to be derived from the case of the ostrich is that China, which by virtue of a widely accepted school opinion appears to us as the classical soil of ultra-conservative perseverance of traditions, is very liable also to lose traditions, and even rather good ones. The excellent ostrich representations of the T'ang have not been perpetuated, but have re? mained as isolated instances. Indeed, they seem to have remained unknown to Chinese artists, archaeologists, and naturalists, and hidden away in seclusion and oblivion until discovered by M. Chavannes. It is this very China unknown to the Chinese, which, as research ad? vances, will become our most attractive subject of study. We referred above (p. 100) to the fact that the ancient illustrations to the Erh ya are lost, and that Kuo-PVs sketches of the rhinoceros may have been nearer to the truth. In now raising the question whether any representations of the animal are handed down in the ancient monuments of China, we naturally remember the primeval form of writing that mirrors the stage of her primitive culture. The celebrated Catalogue of Bronzes, the Po ku fu lu, published by Wang Fu in the period Ta-kuan (1107-1111), has preserved to us (Ch. 9, p. 23) two an? cient symbols which are veritable representations of the single-horned rhinoceros se (Fig. 18). They are placed on the ends of a handle of a bronze wine-kettle attributed to the Shang dynasty (b.c. 1766-1154). The explanatory text runs as follows: " The two lateral ears of the vessel are connected by a handle, on which are chased two characters in the shape of a rhinoceros (se). When it is said in the Lun yil that 'a tiger and rhinoceros escape from their cage/2 it follows that the rhinoceros is 1 And these must certainly be handled with a critical mind, as, for instance, a glance at the chapter " Ostrich " in the T'u shu tsi ch'ing will convince one. The first extract there given from the Ying yai shing lan of 1416 deals with the "fire-bird" of Sumatra, which is the cassowary (see Groeneveldt, in Miscell. Papers relating to Indo-China, Vol. I, pp. 198, 262). Mo k*o hui si, a work written by P'eng Ch'&amp;ng in the first half of the eleventh century (Bretschneider, Bot. Sin., pt. 1, p. 174), is quoted as making a contribution to the subject in question, because a bird able to eat iron and stone is mentioned there; this bird, however, called ku-t%o, occurs in Ho-chou, the present Lan-chou fu in Kan-su, is built like an eagle, and over three feet high! Accordingly we here have a wrong association of ideas, and the subject has nothing to do with the ostrich. The editors of the cyclopaedia blindly follow the uncritical example of Li Shi-ch?n, who embodied the same in his notes on the ostrich. Finally, Verbiest's K*un yii Vu shuo is laid under contribution, as he describes the "camel bird" of South America. This is the Rhea belonging to the Ratite family, but distinguished from the true ostrich by its possession of three toes. 2 Legge, Chinese Classics, Vol. I, p. 306; and above, p. 74, note 4.</page><page sequence="60">Chinese Clay Figures ^^^^^ ^^^^H ^^|pB^^^ st &amp; Pig. 18.

Indeed, it inflicts injury on man; and for this reason the ancients availed themselves of it to fine a person a cup of wine, which is expressed by the phrase 'to raise the goblet of rhinoceros-horn.' 1 This goblet receives its name from the rhinoceros, and so it is proper also that there should be wine-kettles with the emblem of the rhinoceros. On the two ends of the handle of this vessel is pictured a rhinoceros with head and body complete, the latter having the shape of a glutton (fao fie). This certainly indicates that it symbolizes a warning. In this manner all vessels were decorated during the Shang dynasty, and it is by such symbolic forms that they are distinguished from those of the Chou." Whatever the rough character of these two sketches transmitted by the Po ku Vu lu may be,2 the single-horned rhinoceros is here clearly outlined with a naive and refreshing realism, such as could be spontaneously produced only by the hand of primitive man, who with a few forceful outlines recorded his actual ex? perience of the animal. Here we do not face the narrow-breasted academic and philological construction of the scholars of the Sung period, but the direct and vigorous impression of the strong-minded hunter of past ages, who was formed of the same stuff as the Bushman of southern Africa and palaeolithic man living in the caves of Spain and France. No bridge spans the chasm yawning between the Shang and Sung productions. The Shang rhinoceros breathes the same spirit as its companions on the rock paintings of the Bushman (Fig. 19), and in the palaeolithic cave of Font-de-Gaume in France (Fig. 20).

For the sake of comparison, and in order to show that the primitive Chinese man knew very well how to discriminate between a rhinoceros and an ox, the contemporaneous symbol for the sacrificial bull (hi niu), and designs of recumbent oxen (explained as such in the Po ku Vu lu) on the lid of a bronze vessel, are here added (Figs. 21 and 22). We arrive at the result, which will most naturalists referred to a single genus, which is found living in Africa and south-eastern Asia, while formerly it was widely distributed over the entire Old World (with the exception of Australasia), ranging as far north as Siberia.2 Three species exist in Asia, ?

For the purpose of our inquiry it should be particularly borne in mind that it is in the territory of Assam where we meet the three species together. " The Imperial Gazetteer of India "3 states, in the chapter on Assam, "Rhinoceros are of three kinds: the large variety (unicornis), which lives in the swamps that fringe the Brahmaputra; the smaller variety (sondaicus), which is occasionally met with in the same locality; and the small two-horned rhinoceros (sumatrensis), which is now and again seen in the hills south of the Surm? Valley, though its ordinary habitat is Sumatra, Borneo, and the Malay Peninsula." Assam is inhabited by numerous tribes, a large portion of which ranges among the Indo-Chinese family. What now holds good for Assam, as will be recognized from a survey of Chinese sources, two millenniums and more ago was valid for the south-western and southern parts of China, the Tibeto-Chinese borderlands, and Indo-China in its total range; in short, the historical fact will be established that in the past the rhinoceros in its two main varieties, the single-horned and two-horned, had occupied the whole territory of south-eastern Asia. The greater part of the knowledge possessed by the Chinese in re? gard to the rhinoceros has been digested by Li Shi-ch^n in his materia medica Pen ts'ao hang mu (Ch. 51 a, p. 5) completed in 1578 after twenty six years' labor. He first quotes a number of authors beginning from the fifth century, and then sums up the argument in his own words. This discourse is also of value for zoogeography, in that it contributes materially to the possibility of reconstructing the early habitats of the rhinoceros in China. The text of this work is here translated in extenso, but rectified and supplemented from the materia medica of the Sung period, the Cheng lei pen ts'ao, first printed in 1108.4 1 Al-Ber?nl (973-1048) states that the rhinoceros existed in large numbers in India, more particularly about the Ganges (Sachau, /. c, Vol. I, p. 203). In the sixteenth century it occurred in the western Himalaya and also in the forests near Peshawar (Yule and Burnell, Hobson-Jobson, p. 762). Linschoten found it in great numbers in Bengal (ibid., p. 1); so also Garcia Ab Horto (/. c, p. 66): multos in Cambaya Bengala finitima, et Patane inveniri tradunt. Abul Fazl All ami (1551-1602), in his Ain I Akbari written in 1597 (translation of H. S.

After this survey, we shall turn to the times of early antiquity, and discuss the subject in the light of such information as has been handed down to us from those days. Li Shi-eMn opens his discourse on the rhinoceros with the explana? tion of the name. "The symbol for the word si still has in the seal character chuan win the form of a pictograph,1 and is the name for the female rhinoceros. The se is styled also 'sand rhinoceros' (sha si). The Erh ya i2 says that the words se and tse (female) approach each other in sound like the two words ku Cram/ No. 6226) and ku ('male'). In general, si and se are one and the same. The ancients were fond of saying se, the people of subsequent times inclined toward the word si. In the northern dialects the word se prevails, in the southern dialects the predilection is for si. This is the difference between the two. In Sanskrit literature the rhinoceros is called khadga." 3 Li Shi-ch?n then proceeds to quote the ancient work Pie lu,4 which makes the following important statement in regard to the former localities where the rhinoceros occurred: "The habitat of the rhinoceros 1 This is indeed the case in the Shuo win (see p. 92). The names of the rhinoceros and the various kinds of its horn are here reproduced from T*u shu tsi ch'ing (p. 134). 2 An appendix to the Erh ya by Lo Yuan of the twelfth century (Bretschneider, Bot. Sin., pt. 1, p. 37). 3 Written with Nos. 1456 and 1558 (k*et-ga); compare Eitel, Hand-book of Chinese Buddhism, p. 76. (Other Sanskrit words for "rhinoceros" are ganda, gandaka, gand?nga.) The work Sheng shut yen Van lu, written by Wang P'i-chi about the end of the eleventh century (Wylie, Notes, p. 195), seems to be the first to impart this Sanskrit name (see the Chinese text opposite); it further gives a Sanskrit word for the horn in the Chinese transcription pi-sha-na corresponding to Sanskrit vish?na ("horn "). The latter and the word khadga were among the first Sanskrit words in Chinese recognized by Abel Remusat (see S. Julien, Methode, p. 3). 4 The Pie lu is not identical with the Ming i pie lu, as first stated by Bret? schneider (Bot. Sin., pt. 1, p. 42), but later rectified by him (in pt. 3, p. 2). It is an independent work, which must have existed before the time of Tlao Hung-king, and which was known to the latter and commented on by him. This is quite clear in the present case, as Li Shi-cMn first introduces the Pie lu, and then proceeds, "T'ao Hung king says." And since the latter starts with the phrase "at present," it is apparent that he had the words of the Pie lu before his eyes, and gave his definition in distinc? tion from the older work. This is also proved by the text of the Ching lei pin ts*ao published in 1108 by the physician T'ang Sh&amp;n-wei (edition of 1523, Ch. 17, fol. 21 )9 where the two quotations are separated and marked by type of different size. As in Bretschneider's opinion nearly all the geographical names occurring in the Pie lu refer to the Ts*in (third century b.c.) or Han periods, although some of them can be traced to the Chou dynasty (b.c. 1122-249), the above passage surely relates to a time antedating our era by several centuries; and it goes without saying, that as a matter of fact, in the age of the Chou and at a far earlier date, the two-horned rhinoceros must have been a live citizen in the south-western parts of China.</page><page sequence="66">136 Chinese Clay Figures (si) is in the mountains and valleys of Yung-ch'ang and in Yi-chou;1 Yung-ch'ang is the southern part of the present country of Tien (Yun? nan)." 2 The next author invoked by Li Shi-chdn is T'ao Hung-king (452 536), a celebrated adept of Taoism and a distinguished physician, author of the Ming i pie lu, a treatise on materia medica.3 He states, "At present the rhinoceros (si) inhabits the distant mountains of Wu-ling,4 Kiao-chou,5 and Ning-chou.6 It has two horns; the horn on the forehead is the one used in fighting.7 There is a kind of rhinoceros styled 'communicating with the sky' (fung fien), whose horn is in? tersected by a white vein running clear through from the base to the tip; the night dew does not moisten it. It is employed as a remedy, whereby its wonderful properties are tested. In the opinion of some, this is the horn of the water-rhinoceros, which is produced in the water.8 The Annals of the Han Dynasty speak of the horn of 'the rhinoceros frightening fowl' (hiai ki si): when it was placed in the rice that served as food for the chickens, they were all scared and did not dare to peck; 1 Playfair, The Cities and Towns of China, No. 8596 (2d ed., No. 7527, 1). In the Han period, Yi-chou was the name of a province occupying the territory of the present province of Sze-eh'uan, a part of Kuei-chou and Y?n-nan (Bretschneider, Bot. Sin., pt. 3, p. 565), while the southern part of Y?n-nan is understood by the designation Yung-cfrang. The Pie lu, accordingly, locates in south-western China the rhinoceros si, which, as follows from the comment of T*ao Hung-king, is the two-horned species. 2 This last clause is not contained in the text of the Ching lei pin tsKao, and is doubtless a later comment, presumably derived from T'ao Hung-king's edition of the Pin ts*ao king, which is listed in the Catalogue of the Sui Dynasty, and according to Bretschneider's supposition, embraced likewise the text of the Pie lu. 3 His biography is in Nan shi (Ch. 76, p. 4 b) and Liang shu (Ch. 51, p. 12). 4 Playfair, No. 8112 (2d ed., No. 7080): district forming the prefectural city of Chfang-te\ Hu-nan Province. 6 Northern part of the present Tonking (see Hirth and Rockhill, Chau Ju-kua, p. 46). 8 Playfair, No. 5239, 2 (4672, 2): in Lin-an fu, Y?n-nan Province. Under the Tsin it was a province comprising Y?n-nan and part of Kuei-chou (compare Hua yang kuo chi, Ch. 4, p. 1, ed. of Han Wei ts'ung shu). 7 Thus the two-horned (so-called Sumatran) rhinoceros is here clearly mentioned. 8 The rhinoceros is fond of spending the hot hours of the day immersed in water, and thence the Chinese designation "water-rhinoceros" may take its origin. In this position particularly, the animal calls to mind the water-buffalo. In ancient times it was therefore dreaded as being able to overturn boats, which is quite believable; and soldiers crossing a river were encouraged to prompt action by their commander shouting the name of the animal (Chavannes, Les M^moires historiques de Se-ma Ts'ien, Vol. I, p. 225, Vol. IV, p. 37; Forke, Lun-H?ng, pt. II, p. 322; according to Forke, the reading of the text is ts%ang kuang, but as quoted in T%u shu tsi chKing and P*ei win y?nfu it is ts'ang se, as in Se-ma TsHen). The water-rhinoceros (shut si) is mentioned in Kuang chou ki (see Bretschneider, Bot. Sin., pt. i, No. 377) as occurring in the open sea off the district of P'ing-ting, resembling an ox, emitting light when coming out of, or descending into, the water, and breaking a way through the water (quoted in T%u shu tsi ch*ing).</page><page sequence="67">History of the Rhinoceros 137 when it was placed on the roof of a house, the birds did not dare to assemble there.1 There is also the horn of the female rhinoceros, which is very long, with patterns resembling those of the male, but it is not fit to enter the pharmacopoeia." 2 1 The allusion to the Mai M si occurs in Ch. 108 of Hou Han shu (compare Cha? vannes, Les pays d'Occident d'apres le Heou Han Chou, Txoung Pao, 1907, p. 182; and Hirth, China and the Roman Orient, p. 79), where this kind of horn is ascribed to the country of Ta Ts*m (the Roman Orient). The legend given in explanation as above is derived from the famous Taoist writer Ko Hung, who died about 330 a.d.; and it is not accidental that the Taoist T'ao Hung-king here copies his older colleague, for the legend is plainly Taoistic in character. It is quoted in the commentary to Hou Han shu, but not in the text of the Annals. The view of Hirth, that it has arisen in consequence of a false etymology based on the Chinese characters transcribing a foreign word, seems to me unfounded. First, as Chavannes remarks, the foreign word supposed to be hidden in hiai-M has not yet been discovered, and in all probabil? ity does not exist. Second, as will be seen from P'ei win yiinfu (Ch. 8, p. 87 b), the term Mai M si does not occur in Hou Han shu for the first time, but is noted as early as the Chan kuo ts*e at the time of Chang I, who died in b.c. 310, when the King of Ch*u despatched a hundred chariots to present to the King of Ts'in fowl-scaring rhinoceros-horns and jade disks resplendent at night (ye kuang pi). It is certainly somewhat striking to meet here these two names, which are identical with those in Hou Han shu, and occur there close together; and it cannot be denied that the passage of Chan kuo tsxe might be an interpolation. Huai-nan-tse, who died in b.c. 122, alludes to a rhinoceros-horn frightening foxes (si Mo Mai hu, quoted in Pxei win yiin fu, I. c, p. 89 a, "when placed in the lair of a fox, the fox does not dare return"), which is a case analogous in word and matter to the fowl-frightening horn. These notions must be taken in connection with the other legends regarding the rhinoceros, which all seem to spring from indigenous Taoist lore. The text of Ko Hung, as quoted in P%ei win yiin fu and translated by Hirth and Chavannes, is fuller than cited above in the Pin tsxao, while the final clause in regard to placing the horn on the roof does not occur in Ko Hung. The latter links the Mai ki si with the Vung Vien, which Hirth and Chavannes translate "communicating with Heaven." This is cer? tainly all right; but I prefer to avoid this term, because it may give rise to mis? understandings, as we are wont to think of Heaven as the great cosmic deity. A com? parative study of all passages concerned renders it clear that the rhinoceros is not associated with spiritual, but with material heaven; that is, the sky. It is the stars of the sky which are supposed to be reflected in the veins of the horn. This means that the designs of the horn gave the impetus to the conception of connecting the rhinoceros with the phenomena of the sky,? again a thoroughly Taoistic idea, in which no trace of an outside influence can be discovered. Father Zottoli (Cursus litteraturae sinicae, new ed., Vol. I, p. 301) renders the term Vung Vien si tai by "pene trantis coelum rhinocerotis cingulum."?Chao Ju-kua (Hirth's and Rockhill's translation, p. 103) attributes Mai M si or Fung Vien si also to Baghdad (but I see no reason why these words should denote there a precious stone, instead of rhinoceros horn). On p. 108 (note 10) the two authors represent the matter as though this refer? ence might occur in Ling-wai tai ta, but in fact it is not there (Ch. 3, p. 1 b); it must therefore be due to Chao Ju-kua, who seems to indulge in a literary reminiscence taken from Hou Han shu. The passage, accordingly, affords no evidence for a trade in rhino? ceros-horns from Baghdad to China, which per se is not very likely.?In the illustra? tions to the Fing shin yen i (ed. of Tsi ch*ing Vu shu, p. 9, Shanghai, 1908), T'ung t'ien kiao chu (see W. Grube, Die Metamorphosen der G?tter, p. 652) is seated astride a rhinoceros (outlined as a bull with a single striped horn), apparently because his name T*ung tHen has been identified with Vung Vien si. 2 There are several additions to this text as edited in the Ching lei pin tsxao, the most interesting of which is that "only the living horns are excellent." This means the horn of a live animal slain in the chase, which was believed to be superior in qual? ity to a horn cast off and accidentally found (compare Hirth and Rockhill, Chau Ju-kua, p. 233). Similar beliefs prevailed in regard to ivory. That coming from the tusk of an elephant killed by means of a pike was considered the best; next in quality</page><page sequence="68">138 Chinese Clay Figures Li Shi-ch6n does not refer to Ko Hung, the famous Taoist adept of the fourth century,1 who is the first author to impart a fantastic account in regard to rhinoceros-horn. He is likewise the first to set forth its quality of detecting poison. His text is here translated, as given in Txu shu tsi ctiing? "Mr. CMng3 once obtained a genuine rhinoceros-horn of the kind ' communicating with the sky,' three inches long, the upper portion being carved into the form of a fish. When a man carries such a piece in his mouth and descends into the water, the water will give way for him and leave a vacant space three feet square, so that he has a chance to breathe in the water.4 The horn 'communicating with the sky' has a single red vein like a silk string running from the base to the tip. When a horn filled with rice is placed among a flock of chickens, the chickens want to peck the grains. Scarcely have they approached the horn to within an inch when they are taken aback and withdraw. Hence the people of the south designate the horn 'communicating with the sky' by the name 1 fowl-frightening horn.' When such a horn is placed on a heap of grain, the birds do not dare assemble there. Enveloped by a thick fog or exposed to the night dew, when placed in a courtyard, the horn does not contract humidity. The rhinoceros (si) is a wild animal living in the deep mountain-forests. During dark nights its horn emits a brilliant light like torch-fire. The horn is a safe guide to tell the presence of poison: when poisonous medicines of liquid form are stirred with a horn, a white foam will bubble up, and no other test is necessary; when non-poisonous substances are stirred with it, no foam will rise. In this manner the presence of poison can be ascertained. When on a journey in foreign countries, or in places where contagion from ku was the ivory of an animal which was found shortly after it had died a natural death; least esteemed was that discovered in mountains many years after the animal's death (Pelliot, Bulletin de V Ecole francaise d'Extrime-Orient, Vol. II, 1902, p. 166). In Siam, the rhinoceros is still killed with bamboo pikes hardened in the fire and thrust into its jaws and down the throat, as described by Bishop Pallegoix (Descrip? tion du royaume Thai ou Siam, Vol. I, p. 75, Paris, 1854). 1 He died in 330 a.d. at the age of eighty-one; see Giles (Biographical Dic? tionary, p. 372); Mayers (Chinese Reader's Manual, p. 86); Bretschneider (Bot. Sin., pt. 1, p. 42); and Pelliot (Journal asiatique, 1912, Juillet-Ao?t, p. 145). 2 Chapter on Rhinoceros (hui k*ao, p. 3), introduced by the author's literary name Pao-p'u-tse, and the title of his work Teng she pHen, which is not included in the Taoist Canon. 3 Presumably Cheng Se-y?an, a relative and spiritual predecessor of Ko Hung (L. Wieger, Taoisme, Vol. I, Le canon, p. 16; Pelliot, /. c, p. 146). 4 It is interesting to note that this belief is still upheld in the modern folk-lore of Annam: "Celui qui peut se procurer une corne de rhinoceros et la sculpte en forme de poisson, s'il la met entre ses dents, peut descendre sans danger, comme le rhi? noceros ou le poisson, tout au fond de l'eau" (P. Giran, Magie et Religion Annamites, p. 104, Paris, 1912).</page><page sequence="69">History of the Rhinoceros 139 poison1 threatens, a man takes his meals in other people's houses, he first ought to stir his food with a rhinoceros-horn. When a man hit by a poisonous arrow is on the verge of dying, and his wound is slightly touched with a rhinoceros-horn, foam will come forth from his wound, and he will feel relief.2 This property of the horn 'communicating with the sky' of neutralizing poison is accounted for by the fact that the animal, while alive, particularly feeds on poisonous plants and trees provided with thorns and brambles,3 while it shuns all soft and smooth vegetal matter. Annually one shedding of its horn takes place in the mountains, and people find horns scattered about among the rocks;4 in this case, however, they must deposit there, in the place of the real one, another horn carved from wood, identical with that one in color, veins, and shape. Then the rhinoceros remains unaware of the theft. In the following year it moves to another place to shed its horn.5 Other kinds of rhinoceros-horn also are capable of neutralizing poison, without having, however, the wonderful power of the fung-fien variety." Su Kung, the editor of the T%ang sin pin ts'ao (the revised edition of the materia medica of the T'ang dynasty) states as follows: "The tse (No. 12,325) is the female rhinoceros. The patterns on its horn are smooth, spotted, white, and clearly differentiated. It is ordinarily called the 'spotted rhinoceros' (pan si). It is highly esteemed in pre 1 See T*oung Pao, 1913, p. 322. 2 The belief that the horn will check the effects of poisoned arrows is repeated in the Pet hu lu, written by Tuan Kung-lu around 875 in the T'ang period (Pelliot, Bul? letin de V Ecole fr angaise, Vol. IX, 1909, p. 223). The notes of this book regarding the horn are all based on the text of Ko Hung; instead of Vung tHen si, the term Vung si is employed. 3 The animal feeds, indeed, on herbage, shrubs, and leaves of trees. 4 The supposition of the rhinoceros shedding its horn regularly has not been ascer? tained by our zoologists; but it is not very probable that it does so, nor have the Chi? nese made the actual observation. It is clear that their conclusion is merely based on the circumstantial evidence of detached horns occasionally found and picked up in the wilderness, which suggested to them the notion of a natural process similar to the shedding of cervine antlers. 8 A similar story is told in regard to the elephant by Ch&amp;n Kuan, who wrote two treatises on the medical virtues of drugs, and who died in the first part of the seventh century (Bretschneider, Bot. Sin., pt. 1, p. 44): "The elephant, whenever it sheds its tusks, itself buries them. The people of K'un-lun make wooden tusks, stealthily exchange them, and take the real ones away." K'un-lun is the Chinese designation for the Malayan tribes of Malacca, and was extended to Negrito, Papua, and the negroes of Africa (see Hirth and Rockhill, Chau Ju-kua, p. 32). In this connec? tion we should remember also the words of Pliny (Nat. hist., vin, 3, ?7), that the elephants, when their tusks have fallen out either accidentally or from old age, bury them in the ground (quam ob rem deciduos casu aliquo vel senecta defodiunt). It is not impossible that the great quantity of fossil ivory mentioned as early as by Theophrast (De lapidibus 37, Opera ed. F. Wimmer, p. 345; compare the interesting notes of L. de Launay, Mineralogie des anciens, Vol. I, pp. 387-390, Bruxelles, 1803) may have given rise to this notion.</page><page sequence="70">140 Chinese Clay Figures scriptions, but is not such an efficient remedy as the horn of the male rhinoceros."1 Ch'&amp;i Ts'ang-k'i, who lived in the first half of the eighth century, states in his work Pin ts'ao ski i ("Omissions in Previous Works on Materia Medica") as follows: "There are not two kinds of the rhinoce? ros, called the land and water animal. This distinction merely refers to finer and coarser qualities of horns.2 As to the rhinoceros 'com? municating with the sky,' the horn on its skull elongates into a point after a thousand years. It is then adorned, from one end to the other, with white stars, and can exhale a vapor penetrating the sky; in this manner it can communicate with the spirits,3 break the water, and frighten fowl. Hence the epithet 'communicating with the sky' is bestowed on it. Pao-p\i-tse4 says, 'When such a rhinoceros-horn is carved into the shape of a fish, and one holding this in his mouth de? scends into water, a passage three feet wide will open in the water.'"5 Su Sung, author of the Txu king pen ts'ao, published by imperial order in the age of the Sung dynasty, has the following: "Of rhinoceros horn, that coming from the regions of the Southern Sea (Nan hai) takes the first place; that from K'ien and Shu6 ranks next. The rhinoceros resembles the water-buffalo, has the head of a pig, a big paunch, short legs, the feet being similar to those of the elephant and having three toes. It is black in color, and has prickles on its tongue. It is fond of eating thorny brambles.7 Three hairs grow from each pore in its skin, 1 Li Shi-ch$n's text exactly agrees with that given in the Cheng lei pin ts*ao. It is an interesting coincidence that the horn of the female rhinoceros (tse si kid) is men? tioned in the Annals of the T'ang Dynasty (T'ang shu, Ch. 40, p. 6 b) as the tribute sent from the district of Si-p'ing in Shen chou, the present territory of Si-ning in Kan-su. The Annals therefore confirm the statement of the contemporaneous Pin ts*ao. 2 It will be seen below that Li Shi-chen does not share this opinion. 3 The same paragraph is found in Li Shi, the author of the Sii po wu chi (Ch. 10, p. 8 b; ed. of Pai hai), ascribed by tradition to the T'ang period, but in fact coming down from the Sung. He interprets the expression Vung Vien by the words, "It is capable of communicating with the spirits" (ning Fung shin). According to him, "the horn communicating with the sky" is a thousand years old, long and pointed, overstrewn with white stars, the tip emitting a vapor. 4 Surname of Ko Hung, a famous Taoist writer, who died at the age of eighty-one about 330 a.d. (see p. 138). 5 The text in the Ching lei pin ts*ao is somewhat fuller. It opens by saying that the flesh of the rhinoceros cures all poisons, especially poisoning caused by the bites of snakes and mammals. On Java bits of the horn are considered as an infallible antidote against snake-bites (P. J. Veth, Java, Vol. Ill, p. 289). At the close of Ch*en Ts'ang-k'i's text it is added that the horn is called also nu kio (literally, "slave horn'') and shi kio ("the horn, with which the animal feeds"); the word nu seems to be the transcription of a word from a non-Chinese language. 8 Ancient designations for the present territory of the provinces of Kuei-chou and Sze-ch'uan. 7 The entire definition, except the "prickles on the tongue," is derived from Kuo P'o (see p. 93). Marco Polo (ed. of Yule and Cordier, Vol. II, p. 285), speaking of</page><page sequence="71">History of the Rhinoceros 141 as in swine. There are one-horned, two-horned, and three-horned ones." 1 the rhinoceros on Java, says, "They do no mischief, however, with the horn, but with the tongue alone; for this is covered all over with long and strong prickles [and when savage with any one they crush him under their knees and then rasp him with their tongue]." Yule comments that the belief in the formidable nature of the tongue of the rhinoceros is very old and widespread, though he can find no foundation for it other than the rough appearance of the organ. Dr. Parsons (p. 9 in the pamphlet quoted above, p. 83) observes, "As to the tongue of the rhinoceros, the scribes assure us that it is so rugged that it can lick off with it the flesh from the bones of a man, but the tongue of the live animal examined by me is as soft and mild as that of a calf; whether it will grow rougher with the advancing age of the animal, I am unable to say." It is easy to see how the fable of the prickly tongue arose. The animal mainly feeds on herbage, and the alleged or real observation of its inclination for brambles led to the conclusion that its tongue must be thorn-proof and prickly. A similar belief seems to obtain in Siam: "On dit que ce monstrueux quadrupede fait ses devices des opines de bambou" (Mgr. Pallegoix, Description du royaume Thai ou Siam, Vol. I, p. 156, Paris, 1854). 1 Now follows in the Pin ts*ao the quotation from the Erh ya translated above (p. 93). The text then following in the Pin ts'ao is purported to be a quotation from Ling piao lu i; but it is in fact abridged, and intermingled with extracts from Yu yang tsa tsu. For this reason I have abandoned at this point the text of the Pin tsxao, and given separately translations of the two documents, as they are published in T'u shu tsi ch'ing (Chapter on Rhinoceros, hui k*ao, p. 4). In evidence of my statement, the text of the Pin ts%ao here follows; the main share in the confusion will probably be due to Su Sung, not to Li Shi-chen. "The Ling piao lu i by Liu Sun (of the T'ang period) says, ' The rhinoceros has two horns: the one on the forehead is called se si, the other, on the nose, is called hu mao si. The male rhinoceros also has two horns both of which are comprised under the name mao si ('hairy rhinoceros'). At present people uphold the opinion that it has but a single horn. These two kinds of horn are provided with grain patterns, and their price largely depends upon the finer or coarser qualities of these designs. The most expensive is the horn with floral designs of the rhinoceros 'communicating with the sky.' The animals with such horns dislike their own shadow, and constantly drink muddy water in order to avoid beholding their reflection. High-grade horns bear likenesses of all things. Some attribute the qualities of the Vung Vien horn to a pathological cause, but the natural reason cannot be ascertained. The term tao ch%a means that one half of the lines pass through in the direction downward; the term cheng chxa means that one half of the lines pass through in the direction upward; the term yao ku chKa means that the lines are inter? rupted in the middle, and do not pass through. Such-like are a great many. The Po-se designate ivory as po-ngan, and rhinoceros-horn as hei-ngan,? words difficult to distinguish. The largest rhinoceros-horn is that of the to-lo-si, a single horn of which weighs from seven to eight catties. This is identified with the horn on the forehead of the male rhinoceros. It has numerous decorations conveying the impression of scattered beans. If the specks are deep in color, the horn is suitable to be made into plaques for girdle-ornaments; if the specks are scattered here and there, and light in color, the horn can be made only into bowls and dishes. In the opinion of some, the animal called se is the female of the si. [It resembles the water-buffalo, and is of dark color. Its hide is so hard and thick that it can be worked into armor.] I do not know whether this is the case or not." (There is here a confusion in Li Shi-cheri's text. The passage enclosed in brackets does not occur in the text of the Ching lei pin tsxaot where it runs, "In the opinion of some, the animal called se is the female of the si; I do not know whether this is the case or not." The rest is evidently interpolated, and is derived from the Shuo win and its commentaries; at all events, it cannot be ascribed to Su Sung.) "Wu Shi-kao, a physician of the T'ang period, tells the fol? lowing story: 'The people near the sea, intent on capturing a rhinoceros, proceed by erecting on a mountain-path many structures of decayed timber, something like a stable for swine or sheep. As the front legs of the rhinoceros are straight, without joints, it is in the habit of sleeping by leaning against the trunk of a tree. The rotten</page><page sequence="72">142 Chinese Clay Figures The Ling piao lu i ki1 says, " The rhinoceros, in general, resembles an ox in form. Its hoofs and feet are like those of the elephant. It has a double armor and two horns. The one on the forehead is styled se si; the other, on the nose, which is comparatively smaller, is termed hu mao si.2 The designs and spots in the anterior horn are small; many have extraordinary patterns. The male rhinoceros likewise has two horns, both of which are designated mao si ('hairy rhinoceros'), and are provided with grain patterns.3 They are capable of being worked into plaques for girdles.4 Among a large number of rhinoceros-horns there timber will suddenly break down, and the animal will topple in front without being able for a long time to rise. Then they attack and kill it.' " The conclusion is translated above in the text. 1 In the Pin ts'ao, and otherwise, usually styled Lingpiao lu i. According to Bret Schneider (Bot. Sin., pt. i, p. 170), it is an account of the natural productions of China by Liu S?n of the T*ang dynasty. 2 Hirth and Rockhill (Chau Ju-kua, p. 233), briefly alluding to this text, under? stand the terms se si and hu mao si as two different varieties of the rhinoceros. This point of view seems to me inadmissible, as Liu S?n distinctly speaks of the two-horned variety only, and then goes on to specify the two horns in the same animal, which differing in size and shape are, from a commercial and industrial standpoint, of dif? ferent value. The term Hu mao (* cap^ of the Hu'; the Hu in general designate peoples of Central Asia, Turks and Iranians) is a very appropriate designation for the anterior horn of this species, which is a low, flat, roundish knob, and indeed resembles a small skull-cap. In the Ming kung shi (Ch. 4, p. 8; new edition in movable types, 1910, in 8 chs.), a most interesting description of the life at the Court of the Ming dynasty (compare Hirth, Txoung Pao, Vol. VI, 1895, p. 440), this cap is explained as coming down from the T'ang dynasty, and as having been used by the heir-apparent of the Ming; it was made from sable and ermine skins, and worn in the winter on hunting expeditions to keep the ears warm. It is mentioned in T*ang shu, Ch. 24, p. 8 (and presumably in other passages). 3 Li Shi-ch6n (p. 150) expands this theme. Fang I-chi, who graduated in 1640, in his Wu li siao shi (Ch. 8, p. 20 b), states that only the rhinoceros-horn of Siam has grain patterns, while they are absent in the hairy (that is, the double-horned) rhi? noceros of Annam, which has flower-like and spotted designs. 4 In the Treasure-House of Nara in Japan are preserved objects carved from rhinoceros-horn coming down from the T'ang period, as leather belts with horn plaques, drinking-cups, Ju-i, and back-scratchers. The girdles studded with plaques carved from the horn seem to make their appearance in China under the T'ang dynasty; the assertion of Bushell (Chinese Art, Vol. I, p. 119) that they were the "official" girdles of the dynasty does not seem to be justified: at least, they are not enumerated in the class of official girdles, but seem to have been restricted to the use of princesses (compare the account of Tu yang tsa pien, translated below, p. 152). Interesting texts bearing on rhinoceros-horn girdles are communicated in T%u shu tsi ch'ing (Chapter on Girdles, tai pKei, hi shi, p. 9 b). Such girdles were made also in Champa: the Sung Annals (Sung shi, Ch. 489, p. 2) relate a tribute sent from there in the period Hien-t? (954-962) of the Hou Chou dynasty; it was local products including rhinoceros-horn girdles with plaques carved in the form of cloud-dragons. A rhinoceros-horn girdle sent from the Court of the Sung to that of the Khitan is men? tioned in Liao shi (Ch. 10, p. 1). Under the Kin dynasty (1115-1234) the materials employed for official costume were ranked in the order jade, gold, rhinoceros-horn, ivory (Kin shi, Ch. 34, ? 3, p. 7). The emperor wore a hat-pin of rhinoceros-horn, and a girdle of black horn (wu si tai); the imperial saddle was decorated with gold, silver, rhinoceros-horn, and ivory. Officials of the second rank and higher were en? titled to a girdle of the Vung si horn; those of the third rank, to a girdle of the hua si horn; the rest, to plain rhinoceros-horn girdles (ibid., Ch. 43). They were in vogue also</page><page sequence="73">History of the Rhinoceros 143 are few in which the lines pass through from one end to the other. These are pointed, and their designs are large and numerous. Those with small designs are styled tao ch'a Vung} These two kinds are called also 'bottomless jade cups.'2 If there is not sufficient space for the lines to pass through, and the white and black designs are equally distributed, then the price is considerably increased, and the horn will become the treasure of numberless generations. When I lived at P^n-y?,31 made a thorough examination of what is current there con? cerning rhinoceros-horn. There is, further, the to-lo-si, the largest among the rhinoceros-horns, which may reach seven catties in weight.4 This is the horn on the forehead of the male rhinoceros, which has numerous designs in the interior conveying the impression of scattered beans. If the stripes are deep in color, the horn is capable of being made into girdle-plaques and implements; if the stripes are dispersed and light in color, the horn may be employed to advantage for the making of cups, at the Court of the Ming emperors (Ta Ming hui tien, Ch. 5, p. 30), and were allowed to alternate with tortoise-shell girdles (Ming kung shi by Liu Jo-yu, Ch. 4, p. 3 b&gt; new ed. of 1910). Under the Yuan dynasty a bureau for works in rhinoceros-horn and ivory was established. This was a sort of court-atelier, in which couches, tables, implements, and girdle-ornaments inlaid with these materials were turned out for the use of the imperial household. An official was placed in charge of it in 1263, and he received an assistant in 1268; the force consisted of a hundred and fifty work? ing-men (Yiian shi, Ch. 90, p. 5, K*ien-lung edition). According to Qazwinl (1203 83), the inhabitants of Sand?bil (Kan-chou in Kan-su Province) were clad in silk and adorned with ivory and rhinoceros-horn (J. Marquart, Osteurop?ische und ostasiatische Streifz?ge, p. 87, Leipzig, 1903). De Goeje is inclined to think in this connection of rhinoceros-horn set with gold and worn as amulet; but an instance of such a mode of use is not known in China, and it rather seems that it is in this case likewise the question of girdles decorated with plaques of ivory and rhinoceros-horn. The Mohammedan authors were well aware of the fondness of the Chinese for this material and its employment for girdles, and during the middle ages became the most active importers of the horn into China. The Arabic merchant Soleiman writ? ing in 851 relates that the inhabitants of China make from the horn girdles reaching in price to two and three thousand dinars and more, according to the beauty of the figure found in the design of the horn (M. Reinaud, Relation des voyages faits par les Arabes, Vol. I, p. 29). Hafiz el Gharb, who wrote at the end of the eleventh century, observed, "The most highly esteemed ornaments among the Chinese are made from the horn of the rhinoceros, which, when cut, presents to the eye singular and varied figures" (Ch. Schefer, Relations des Musulmans avec les Chinois, p.10, in Centenaire de VEcole des langues orientates, Paris, 1895). 1 Tao, "to reverse;" chxa, "to insert;" Vung, "to pass through." 2 Thus this phrase is explained in Giles's Dictionary, p. 1326 b (tenth entry). 3 Playfair (2d ed.), No. 4927: one of the two districts forming the city of Kuang-chou (Canton). 4 Hirth and Rockhill (Chau Ju-kua, p. 233), relying onGerini, identify the coun? try To-lo or To-ho4o, as written in T*ang shu, with a country situated on the Gulf of Martaban. The journey from Kuang-chou to that country takes five months. An embassy with tribute came from there to China in the period Cheng-kuan (627 650), and emphasis is laid on the great number of fine rhinoceroses. See also Schlegel (T*oung Pao, Vol. IX, 1898, p. 282) and Pelliot (Bull, de VEcole frangaise, Vol. IV, 1904, p. 360).</page><page sequence="74">144 Chinese Clay Figures dishes, utensils, platters, and the like.1 Then there is the horn ' frighten? ing fowl' with a white, silk-like thread; placed in the rice, it scares the fowl away. The ' dust-dispelling horn' is utilized to make hairpins and combs for women; it keeps dust out of the hair. As to the 'water dispelling horn,' when brought into the water of a river or the sea, it has the power of breaking a way across it. Exposed to a fog, and in the evening, it does not contract moisture. As to the 'resplendent horn,' this one, when put in a dark house, emits its own light.2 Of all these various horns, I know only from hearsay, for I have not been able to procure and see them." The Yu yang tsa tsu by Tuan Ch^ng-shi of the ninth century3 makes the following comments on the rhinoceros: "The variety of rhinoceros styled ' communicating with the sky' dislikes its own shadow, and is in the habit of drinking muddy water.4 When the animal is im? mersed in the water, men avail themselves of this opportunity to cap? ture it, as it is impossible for it to pull its feet out of the mud. The natu? ral structure of the horn is such that it is filled with figures resembling objects of nature. It is asserted by others that the designs penetrat? ing the rhinoceros-horn are pathological.5 There are three varieties of design, styled tao ch'a ('lines inverted and inserted'), cheng ch'a ('straight and inserted'), and yao ku ch'a ('inserted like a barrel-shaped drum').6 They are styled 'inverted,' if one half of the lines pass 1 The colors indicated by the Chinese writers altogether answer the facts. In its exterior, the color of rhinoceros-horn is usually black or dark brown. A cross-section reveals various colors. A specimen kindly presented to the Museum by Mr. F. W Kaldenberg of New York exhibits in the interior a large black zone running through the centre and extending from the base to the tip, and filling the entire space of the extremity. In the lower, broad portion it is surrounded on the one side by a gold brown section, about 3.5 cm wide and 21 cm long, and on the other side by a mottled light-yellow and greenish zone almost soap-like in appearance. This horn was found in the woods, and is in places eaten through by insects. The surface of the base exhibits the tips of the bristles, and appears like a coarse brush. The fibres running longitudinally, owing to the effect of weathering, can be easily detached. 2 As shown above (p. 138), optic properties are attributed to the horn as early as the time of Ko Hung. The subject is discussed in detail below (p. 151). 3 As now established by P. Pelliot (T*oung Pao, 1912, pp. 373-375), this work was published about 860. 4 The Pen ts'ao adds, " In order to avoid beholding its reflection." This notion is doubtless derived from the animal's predilection for a mud-bath; its favorite haunts are generally in the neighborhood of swamps (Lydekker, /. c.} p. 31). 5 The Pin ts*ao adds, "But the natural reason cannot be ascertained." This is a comment of Su Sung. 6 The meaning of these technical terms is not quite easy to grasp. The word tao (No. 10,793) is "to invert," ch'a (No. 205) means "to insert:" tao ch'a, accordingly, may mean "lines inserted in the horn in an inverted position;" and cheng ch*a, "lines inserted straight." Yao ('loins') ku (No. 6421; in Pin ts*ao erroneously No. 6227) is the former name for a barrel-shaped drum (hua ku, see A. C.

They are styled 'straight/ if one half of the lines pass through in the direction upward. They are styled 'drum-shaped,' if the lines are interrupted in the middle, without passing through. The Pose designate ivory as po-ngan, and rhinoceros horn as hei-ngan.1 Wu Shi-kao, a physician from Ch'eng shi men, century (Wylie, Notes, p. 160), makes the following remark: "The fundamental color of rhinoceros-horn is black. Is the color simultaneously black and yellow, the horn is styled 'standard throughout' (ching Vou). Is the horn yellow with black borders, it is styled 'inverted throughout' (tao Vou). The horns of standard color are highly esteemed by our contemporaries. If the shape of the horn is round, it is designated as 'horn communicating with the sky' (Vung Vien si). In the south, there are counterfeits which may be recognized from gradually getting warm when rubbed. In view of the fact that rhinoceros-horn by nature is cold, it does not become warm when rubbed." 1 Su Sung makes the addition, "words difficult to distinguish." Po-ngan means literally "white ngan" (No. 57), and hei-ngan "black ngan,"?evidently transcrip? tions of Po-se words. Palladius, in his Chinese-Russian Dictionary (Vol. I, p. 7), has indicated po-ngan ("ivory") and hei-ngan ("rhinoceros-horn") as Persian loan? words. Ivory, however, is called in Persian shir m?ht; and rhinoceros, as well as the horn of it, kerkeden. It is true that Po-se is the Chinese name for Persia, which first appears in the Wei shu; but Persia is not meant in the above passage. P*ei win yiin fu (Ch. 8, p. 89 b) gives three quotations under the heading hei-ngan si. One from a book Sheng shui yen Van says that the Po-se call rhinoceros-horn hei-ngan; the refer? ence to the name of ivory is omitted, so that the clause "it is difficult to discriminate " makes no sense. The second is derived from the Leng chai ye hua of the monk Hui hung, written toward the close of the eleventh century (Wylie, Notes on Chinese Literature, p. 164), and says that "the men of the south (nan jin) designate ivory as po-ngan, rhmoceros-horn as hei-ngan" The third reference is taken from a poem of Tu Fu (712-770), who remarks that hei-ngan is a general article of trade of the Man. These texts render it probable that the country of Po-se here referred to is not Persia, but identical with the Malayan region Po-se mentioned by Chou K'?-fei in his Ling-wai tai ta, written in 1178 (Ch. 3, p. 6 b; edition of Chi pu tsu chai ts%ung shu), and then after him in the Chufanchi, written in 1225 by Chao Ju-kua (translation of Hirth and Rockhill, p. 125). The two authors seek it in or near the Malay Peninsula, though Negritos are not necessarily to be understood: the mere state? ment that the inhabitants have a dark complexion and curly hair is not sufficient to warrant this conclusion. Gerini identifies the name Po-se with Lambesi below Atjeh on the west coast of Sumatra, which seems somewhat hypothetical. Mr. C. O. Blagden (Journal Royal As. Soc, 1913, p. 168) is inclined to regard Po-se as identical with P?se (or Pasai) in north-eastern Sumatra, but adds that there is no evidence that the place existed as early as 1178. The above text shows that the Po-se of the Chinese mediaeval writers were a Malayan tribe speaking a Malayan language, for the two transcriptions po-ngan and hei-ngan can be interpreted through Malayan. In the Hakka dialect, hei-ngan is het-am; and hitam is the Malayan word for "black" (Javanese Ngoko Mr eng). Pei-ngan is in the Hakka dialect p'ak-am (compare Dic tionnaire chinois-franeais dialecte Hac-ka by Ch. Rey), in Cantonese pak-om, in Yang-chou puk-y?. In Javanese Krama "white" is pe\ak, in Javanese Ngoko putih, likewise in Batak, in common Malayan p?teh. We should expect that the two Malayan words, judging from the Chinese transcriptions, would terminate in the same syllable, which caused misunderstandings on the part of Chinese dealers. There is (or was) perhaps a certain Malayan dialect, in which the word for "white" ended in -am, or in which the words for "white" and "black" terminated in -i or -ih (compare Madagassy intim, inti, "black;" and puti, "white;" G. Ferrand, Essai de pho n^tique comp, du malais et des dialectes malgaches, pp. 24, 54, Paris, 1909). It is evident that neither the Malayan words for "ivory" (g?ding, Javanese gating) and "rhi? noceros-horn" (chula b?dak or simply chula), nor the words for' 'elephant'' (gdjah, Java? nese gajah) and "rhinoceros" (badak, Javanese warak), are intended here, but only the color names "white " and "black," with which the traders distinguished ivory and rhi</page><page sequence="76">146 Chinese Clay Figures while he served in the district of Nan-hai (in Kuang-tung), had occasion to meet there a captain who told him this story: 'The people of my country, intent on capturing a rhinoceros, proceed to erect on a mountain path many wooden structures like watch-houses or posts for tethering animals.1 As the front legs of the animal are straight, without joints, it is in the habit of sleeping by leaning against a tree. The rotten timber will suddenly break down, and the animal is unable to rise.2 Another noceros-horn. The Malayan word badak seems to cover the entire Malayan area where the rhinoceros is found; it occurs on Borneo in the language of the Dayak (A. Harde land, Dajacksch-deutsches W?rterbuch, p. 24, Amsterdam, 1859), and on Sumatra (M. Joustra, Karo-Bataksch Woordenboek, p. 59, Leiden, 1907). Among the Malayans, the rhinoceros-horn (chula) is supposed to be a powerful aphrodisiac; and there is a belief in a species of "fiery" rhinoceros (badak apt) which is excessively dangerous when attacked (W. W. Skeat, Malay Magic, p. 150, London, 1900). The horn is carefully preserved, as it is believed to be possessed of medicinal properties, and is highly prized by the Malays, to whom the Semang generally barter it for to? bacco and similar commodities (Skeat and Blagden, Pagan Races of the Malay Peninsula, Vol. I, p. 203, London, 1906). There is nothing in these Malayan beliefs showing that complex series of ideas, met with in China. They may be a weak echo of Chinese notions conveyed by Chinese traders bartering among them for the horn. 1 Chii yi (Nos. 2974 and 13,205). I do not know but this may have to be taken as a compound with a more specific technical meaning. The two Pin tsxao have changed this unusual term into "stables for swine or sheep." There is no doubt of what is meant, ? posts of rotten timber, which will easily break to pieces under the burden of the animal leaning toward it. 2 This story has passed also into the Arabic account of the merchant-traveller Soleiman, written in 851 a.d. (M. Reinaud, Relation des voyages faits par les Arabes et les Persans dans Finde et a la Chine, Vol. I, p. 29, Paris, 1845): "The kerkeden (rhinoceros) has no articulation in the knee, nor in the hand; from the foot up to the armpit it is but one piece of flesh." In T'oung Pao (1913, pp. 361-4) the historical importance of this tradition is pointed out by me inasmuch as this originally In? dian story has migrated also to the West, where it leaks out in the Greek Physiologus (only the rhinoceros is replaced by the elephant), and in Caesar's and Pliny's stories of the elk. I wish to make two additions to these remarks. Aelian (Nat. an., xvi, 20), describing the rhinoceros of India, called by him tcaprafapos, asserts that its feet have no joints and are grown together like the feet of the elephant (roi&gt;s pkv w68a$ ?diap&amp;p&amp;irovs re teal k?&lt;pepeZs k\e&lt;pavTi avpwepvKkvcu: ed. of F. Jacobs). This passage, therefore, confirms my former conclusion that it was the rhinoceros which was credited in India with jointless legs; but we see that the same notion was like? wise attached to the elephant. It may be the case, accordingly, that the elephant with jointless legs was borrowed by the Physiologus straight from India. Mr. W. W. Rockhill (Diplomatic Audiences at the Court of China, p. 32, London, 1905) quotes a statement made to him by T. Watters on the kotow question with reference to Lord Macartney's embassy, as follows: "It was an opinion universal, and was told among the Chinese, that the Kuei-tse or foreigner was not built up like the jen [that is, man] or Chinaman, and particularly that he had no joints in his legs. So that, if the Kuei-tse was knocked down or otherwise put on the ground, he could not rise again. It was because the Emperor did not want to have possibly a death or at any rate an unseemly spectacle that he waived the kotow." Compare also Rubruck's story of "the creatures who have in all respects human forms, except that their knees do not bend, so that they get along by some kind of jumping motion " (W. W. Rockhill, The Journey of William of Rubruck, p. 199, London, 1900). The fabulous notion of the jointless legs of the rhinoceros may have arisen from the observation that the animal is indeed in the habit of sleeping in a standing position. Says E. Heller (The White Rhinoceros, p. 41), "The hot hours of the day are spent by the white rhinoceros sleeping in the shade of the scattered clumps of trees or bushes which dot the grassy veldt. They seem to rest indifferently, either lying down or standing</page><page sequence="77">History of the Rhinoceros 147 name for the rhinoceros is nu kio. There is also the chin ch*u, which is presumably a rhinoceros. The rhinoceros has three hairs growing out of each pore.1 Liu Hiao-Piao asserts that the rhinoceros sheds its horn and buries it, and that people exchange it for a counterfeit horn." The story alluded to in the latter clause is better worded in the Pen ts'ao, which says, "It is told also that the rhinoceros sheds its horn every year, and itself buries it in the mountains. The people near the sea, with all secrecy, make wooden horns, and exchange these for the reaRmes, and so they go ahead continually. If they would go to work openly, the animal would conceal its horns in another place and defy any search." 2 Li Sun, who wrote an account of the drugs of southern countries (Hai yao pen ts*ao) in the second half of the eighth century, expresses himself in these words: "The rhinoceros 'communicating with the sky,' during the time of pregnancy, beholds the forms of things3 passing across the sky, and these are reproduced in the horn of the embryo: hence the designation ' communicating with the sky.'4 When the horn, placed in a water-basin during a moonlight night, reflects the brilliancy of the moon, it is manifest that it is a genuine horn 'communicating with the sky.' The Wu k% ki5 says, 'The mountain-rhinoceros lives on bamboo and trees. Its urinating is not completed in the course of a day. The I Liao6 get hold of it by means of bow and arrow. This is up with lowered head. When at rest they stand with their noses almost touching the ground, their heads being elevated to a horizontal position only when alarmed." 1 The same is said in the Pin ts*ao in regard to the seal (compare G. Schlegel, Toung Pao, Vol. Ill, 1892, p. 508). Compare p. 140. 2 In the text of the Ching lei pin ts*ao, Su Sung terminates, " I do not know wheth? er at present they take horns in this manner or not." Compare the account of Ko Hung, p. 139. 8 The Ching lei pin ts*ao reads "the destiny of things" (wu ming) instead of "forms of things" (wu hing). 4 In the notes embodied in the Pin ts*ao regarding the elephant (Ch. 51 a, p. 4) it is said that the patterns in the horn are formed while the rhinoceros gazes at the moon, and that the designs spring forth in the tusks of the elephant while the animal hears the thunder. A work Wu ting hui yuan, as quoted in Pxei win y?nfu (Ch. 21, p. 113 b), similarly says that the rhinoceros, while enjoying the moonlight, produces the designs in its horn, and that the floral decorations enter the tusks of the elephant when it has been frightened by thunder. These passages prove that it is material heaven to whose influence the formation of the natural veins in horn and tusk is ascribed. The rhinoceros gazing at the moon is represented in T*u shu tsi chling (Fig. 10). 5 A work listed in the T%ai pHng yil lan as being published in 983; but, as it is quoted here by Li Sun, it must have existed in or before the eighth century. 3 An aboriginal tribe belonging to the stock of the Man, according to T%ang shu (Ch. 43 a, p. 6 b) settled in Ku chou (Playfair, No. 3256) in the province of Kuei chou.

When the people make music, this bull leaves the water to listen to it, and at that moment they capture it.'3 The rhino? ceros has a horn on its nose, and another on the crown of its head. The nose-horn is the one best esteemed. The natural histories (pen tsxao) are acquainted only with the mountain-rhinoceros. I have not yet seen the water-rhinoceros." 4 K?ou Tsung-shi, a celebrated physician of the Sung period, reports in his Pen ts'ao yen i (completed in 1116)6 thus: "The designs in the horns of the river-rhinoceros and the southern rhinoceros are fine. The black rhinoceros-horn has designs clearly displayed, while the yellow rhinoceros-horn has very sparse designs. None equals the patterns in the horn of the Tibetan breed, which are high, and come out clearly at both ends.6 If the forms of objects pictured in the horn are yellow, while the rest is black, the horn is 'standard color throughout' (cheng tou). If the forms of objects are black, while the rest is yellow, the horn is 'inverted throughout' (tao fou). If the black color is taken as stand? ard, and the forms of the design are imitative of real objects, the horn is a treasure; this horn is styled fung si ('penetrating rhinoceros'). It is an indispensable condition that the patterns come out clearly, and that the yellow and black be sharply differentiated. If both ends are moist and smooth, the horn is of the first quality." 7 1 The territory of the province of Kuei-chou, where the rhinoceros formerly occurred, as already attested by Su Sung (above, p. 140). 2 Several works of this title were in existence (see Bretschneider, Bot. Sin., pt. 1, p. 154). 3 The animal in question is certainly not a rhinoceros, and has crept in here by way of wrong analogy. In his notes on cattle, Li Shi-chen mentions a variety "ma? rine ox" (hat niu, Ch. 51 a, p. 7 a). This creature is described after the TsH ti ki by Fu Ch'6n of the fifth century or earlier (Bretschneider, Bot. Sin., pt. 1, p. 201) as follows: "Its habitat is around the islands in the sea near Teng-chou fu (in Shan? tung); in shape it resembles an ox, it has the feet of an alligator (t*o No. 11,397, not iguana, as Giles still translates, despite the correction of E. v. Zach, China Review, Vol. XXIV, 1900, p. 197), and the hair of a bull-head fish. Its skin is soft, and can be turned to manifold purposes; its blubber is good to burn in lamps." The marine ox, accordingly, must be an aquatic mammal of the suborder of Pinnipedia (seals). There may be a grain of truth in the above story: the intelligence of seals is remark? able, they are easily tamed and susceptible to music. There is an interesting chapter on tamed seals in the classical treatise of K. E. v. Baer, Anatomische und zoologische Untersuchungen ?ber das Wallross (MSmoires de VAcad. imp. des sciences de St. Petersbourg, 6th series, Vol. IV, 1838, pp. 150-159). 4 The last clause is not in the text of Cheng lei pin ts\io. 5 Pelliot {Bulletin de VEcole francaise d'Extrime-Orient, Vol. IX, 1909, p. 217). 8 The rhinoceros of Tibet has been discussed above, p. 116. 7 The Arabic authors assert that the interior of the Indian rhinoceros-horn fre? quently presents designs of a human figure, a peacock, or fish, and that the price paid in China is raised according to the beauty of these designs (M. Reinaud, Relation</page><page sequence="79">History of the Rhinoceros 149 Li Shi-chen himself, the author of the Pen tsKao kang mu, sums up as follows: "The habitat of the rhinoceros is in the regions of the Si Fan,1 the southern Tibetan tribes (Nan Fan), the southern portions of Yun? nan, and in Kiao-chou, and occurs there everywhere. There are three species,? the mountain-rhinoceros, the water-rhinoceros, and the se si. There is, further, a hairy rhinoceros resembling the mountain-rhinoceros, and living in hilly forests; great numbers of it are captured by men. The water-rhinoceros makes its permanent abode in water, and is there? fore very difficult to capture. It has, in all, two horns. The horn on its nose is long, that on its forehead is short. The skin of the water rhinoceros has a pearl-like armor,2 but not so the mountain-rhinoceros. des voyages faits par les Arabes, Vol. I, p. 29). Reinaud (Vol. II, pp. 68, 69) com? ments on this point that the Chinese are satisfied to compare the designs with flowers and millet-seeds, and do not discover in them half of the things which the Arabs saw in them. It seems to me that the Arabs, in this case, merely reproduce the ideas of the Chinese. The philosophy of these designs was fully developed in the T'ang period. K'ou Tsung-shi speaks of real objects visible in the horn; and Wang P'i-chi, in his Sheng shut yen Van lu (p. 135), offers an elaborate contribution to this question. Ac? cording to him, "the designs in the horn from Kiao-chi are like hemp-seeds, the horn being dry, a bit warm, and glossy; the horn imported on ships and coming from the Arabs has patterns like chu yil flowers [this name applies to three different plants: Bretschneider, Bot. Sin., pt. 2, No. 498], is glossy and brilliant with colors, some resembling dog-noses, as if they were glossed with fat; others with floral designs and strange objects, these horns being styled Vung tHen si; some like sun and stars, others like clouds and moon; some like the corolla of a flower, some like scenery; some have birds and mammals, others dragons and fishes; some have deities, others palaces; and there are even costume and cap, eyes and eyebrows, staff and footgear [conveying the illusion of the picture of a wanderer], beasts, birds, and fishes. When the horn is completed into a carving, as if it were a veritable picture, it is highly esteemed by the people. The prices are fluctuating, and it is unknown how they are conditioned." There is assuredly an inward relation between the statements of this account and the Arabic texts of Damirl quoted by Reinaud (Vol. II, p. 69). It is hardly necessary to insist on the chronological point that Damirl (1344-1405) wrote his zoological dictionary Hay?t el-haiw?n (C. Huart, Literature arabe, p. 365, Paris, 1902) several centuries after Wang P'i-chi (end of eleventh century). From a psychological point of view, the dependence of the Arabs in this matter on the philosophy of the Chinese is self-evident. Neither the classical world nor ancient India has developed any similar thoughts; and this subject is decidedly Chinese, with a strong Taoist flavor of nature sentiment. It must not be overlooked, either, that al-Ber?ni (Sachau, Alberuni's India, Vol. I, p. 204) merely states that "the shaft of the horn is black inside, and white everywhere else," and that he is entirely reticent about figures in the horn. The Arabs interested in the trade of the horn to China imbibed this lesson, and propagated it themselves in catering to the taste of their customers. The question is whether, in the interest of the business, they did not help nature by art, and may have produced several of the more fanciful designs artificially. This, however, is no matter of great concern; and the fact remains that bristly fibres of various tinges compose the horn, and result in a natural play of design and color which is apt to arouse the imaginative power of a susceptible mind. 1 Western Tibetan tribes; from our standpoint, eastern Tibetans. 21 take this to be identical with what our zoologists say in regard to the skin of the Asiatic species, which "has the appearance of a rigid armor studded with tuber? cles." The whole skin of the Javan species, as already remarked by B. Cuvier (The Animal Kingdom, Vol. I, p. 157, London, 1834), is covered with small compact angular tubercles. Joannes Raius (Synopsis methodica animalium quadrupedum, p. 122, Londini, 1693) describes the skin of the rhinoceros thus: "Auriculae porcinae,</page><page sequence="80">Chinese Clay Figures The se si is the female of the rhinoceros which is termed also 'sand rhinoceros.' It has but a single horn on the crown of the head. The natural designs of the horn are smooth, white, and clearly differentiated, but it is useless as medicine, for the patterns on the horn of the male are big, those on the horn of the female too fine. In the beginning of the period Hung-wu (1368-1398) Kiu-chen1 sent one as tribute, which was called one-horned (monoceros) rhinoceros. The view of Ch'eri Ts*ang k'i that there are not the two kinds of land and water animals, the view of Kuo P'o that the rhinoceros has three horns, and the view of Su Sung that the hairy rhinoceros is the male rhinoceros, are all erroneous. The term 'hairy rhinoceros' is at present applied to the yak.2 The designs of the rhinoceros-horn are like fish-roe. On account of their shape they are styled 'grain patterns.'3 Inside of the latter there are eyes, styled 'grain eyes.' If yellow decorations rise from a black back? ground, the horn is 'standard throughout.' If black decorations rise from a yellow background, the horn is 'inverted throughout.' If within the decorations there are again other decorations, the horn is 'double throughout.' The general designation for these is fung si, and they are of the highest grade. If the decorations are spotted, as it were, with pepper and beans, the horns are middle grade. The horn of the black rhinoceros, which is of a uniform black color and devoid of decorations, is the lowest grade.4 If the horn of the rhinoceros 'com? municating with the sky' emits light, so that it can be seen at night, it is molli et tenui cute vestitae; reliquum corpus dura admodum et crassa, velut squamis quibusdam crustaceis rotundis aspera." This is the reason why in some Chinese and early European sketches the .animal is covered with scales (see Figs. 3 and 11, and Plate IX). 1 Playfair, No. 1295 (1278): in Annam (compare above, p. 81). 2 Li Shi-cMn refers to the notes on this subject contained in the same chapter. This remark renders it plain that it was the notion of "rhinoceros" which was trans? ferred in recent times to the yak, and that the development was not in the reverse order, as assumed by Professor Giles. 3 This and the following sentences, commenting on the natural designs of the horn, have been translated by S. Julien (in M. Reinaud, Relation des voyages faits par les Arabes, Vol. II, p. 68). 4 In the Memoirs on the Customs of Cambodja by Chou Ta-kuan of the Yuan period, translated by P. Pelliot (Bulletin de VEcole frangaise d'Extrinte-Orient, Vol. II, 1902, p. 167), it is said that the white and veined rhinoceros-horn is the most es? teemed kind, and that the inferior quality is black. The List of Medicines exported from Hankow, published by the Imperial Maritime Customs (p. 15, Shanghai, 1888), is therefore wrong in stating that the black and pointed horns are considered the best. A valuation for the horn is not given there. According to a report of Consul-General G. E. Anderson of Hongkong (Daily Consular and Trade Reports, 1913, p. 1356), rhinoceros-horns are imported into Hongkong to some extent, the price ranging from $360 to $460 per picul, or from about $1.30 to $1.65 gold per pound; they are largely of African production, and imported from Bombay. According to L. de Rein ach (Le Laos, Paris, no date, p. 271), rhinoceros-horns have in the territory of the Laos a market-value of 111-137 fr. the kilo, and rhinoceros-skins 60-70 fr. a hundred kilo.</page><page sequence="81">History of the Rhinoceros called 'horn shining at night' (ye ming si):1 hence it can communicate with the spirits, and open a way through the water. Birds and mammals are frightened at seeing it. The Shan hai king speaks of white rhino? ceroses.2 1 This idea may have been borrowed from the precious stones believed to shine at night (Hirth, China and the Roman Orient, pp. 242-244; Chavannes, Les pays d'occident d'apres le Heou Han Chou, T*oung Pao, 1907, p. 181). Jade disks shining at night (ye kuang pi) are mentioned in Shi ki (Ch. 87, p. 2 b). The note of Li Sta? chen is doubtless suggested by the following passage of the Tu yang tsa pien, written by Su Ngo in the latter part of the ninth century (Wylie, Notes on Chin. Lit., p. 194; ed. of Pai hai, Ch. b, p. 9, or P'eiwin yiinfu, Ch. 8, p. 87 b): " In the first year of the period Pao-li (825 a.d.) of the Emperor King-tsung of the T'ang dynasty, the country of Nan-chfang [in Kiang-si; Playfair, No. 4562] offered to the Court a rhi? noceros-horn shining at night (ye ming si). In shape it was like the 'horn com? municating with the sky.' At night it emitted light, so that a space of a hundred paces was illuminated. Manifold silk wrappers laid around it could not hide its luminous power. The Emperor ordered it to be cut into slices, and worked up into a girdle; and whenever he went out on a hunting-expedition, he saved candle-light at night." We even hear of a luminous pillow (ye ming chin) lighting an entire room at night (Yiin sien tsa shi, Ch. 6, p. 3 b, in T%ang Sung ts%ung shu, which quotes from K'ai-yiian THen-pao i shi). The story of Tu yang tsa pien may be connected with the curious tradition regarding W&amp;n K'iao (Tsin shu, Ch. 67, p. 5), who by the alleged light emitted from a rhinoceros-horn beheld the supernatural monsters in the water (see Petillon, Allusions litteraires, p. 227; S. Lockhart, A Manual of Chinese Quotations, p. 280; and Giles, Dictionary, p. 794 b, ? who translate 'to light a rhi? noceros-horn,' which is not possible, as in this case the horn would burn down; the horn was shining through its alleged own light). An illustration of this scene by Ting Y?n p'eng is published in Ch'ing shi mo yuan and Fang shi mo p*u. The notion that the rhinoceros-horn is luminous at night, and is therefore styled "shining or bright horn" (ming si, or kuang ming si), and also "shadowhorn" (ying si), is found in Tung ming ki (Wu-ch'ang print, Ch. 2, p. 2), embodied in a fabulous report on a country Fei-lo, said to be nine thousand li from Ch'ang-ngan in Indo-China (Ji-nan). This work relating to the time of the Han Emperor Wu, though purported to have been written by Kuo Hien of the Han, is one of the many spurious productions of the Leu-eh'ao period (fourth or fifth century), and teeming with anachronisms and gross inventions; some accounts in it are interesting, but devoid of historical value (see Wylie, Notes, p. 191). The assertion theremade, that the inhabitants of Fei-lo drive in carriages drawn by rhinoceros and elephant, is very suspicious; but the report that the horns sent from there were plaited into a mat, the designs of which had the appearance of reticulated silk brocade, is probably not fictitious; for this is confirmed by a passage of the T'ang Annals (Chapter wu hing chi, quoted in T%u shu tsi ch*ing), according to which a certain Chang Yi-chi had a mat made for his mother from rhinoceros-horn. Since the latter (the designation "horn," from a scientific standpoint, is a misnomer) is composed of agglutinated hair or bristles, it is possible to dissolve a horn into thread? like fibres; and the possibility of a technique employing these for the plaiting of mats must be admitted. 2 According to the more precise wording of the passage, as quoted in P*ei win yiin fu (Ch. 8, p. 88 a), the white rhinoceros occurs in the mountains of Kin-ku, inhabited by large numbers of other wild animals, also hogs and deer. The Shan hai king is an apocryphal work teeming with fables, and has little value for scientific purposes. The P'ei wen yiin fu, further, quotes the Tung kuan Han ki (completed about 170 a.d.; Bretschneider, Bot. Sin., pt. 1, No. 990) to the effect that in the first year of the period Y?an-ho (84 a.d.) of the Emperor Chang of the Han dynasty the country Ji-nan (Tonking) offered to the Court a white pheasant and a white rhi? noceros. But this text, unreservedly accepted by Hirth (Das weisse Rhinoceros, Txoung Pao, Vol. V, 1894, P- 392)&gt; must be taken with some caution, as it is identical with, and apparently derived from, the passage in Hou Han shu (Ch. 116, p. 3 b), according to which, in the first year of the period Y?an-ho (84 a.d.), the Man I beyond the boundary of Ji-nan offered to the Court a live rhinoceros and a white pheasant.

The Po k'ung leu fie3 speaks of the 'heat-dispelling' rhinoceros-horn (pi shu si) obtained by the Emperor Wen-tsung (827-840 a.d.) of the T'ang dynasty.4 During the summer months it can cool off the hot temperature. The Ling piao lu ib records the horn of the 'dust-dispelling' rhinoceros (pi chxen si), from which hairpins, combs, and girdle-plaques are made, with the effect that dust keeps aloof from the body. The Tu yang tsa pien* text of the official Annals is decisive, and it is easy to see that the word "live" could have been altered into "white" by the suggestion of the white pheasant. The T'ang leu tien, a description of the administrative organization of the period K'ai-y?an (713-741) of the T'ang dynasty, ascribed to the Emperor Y?an-tsung (compare Pelliot, Bulletin de VEcole franqaise d'Extrtme-Orient, Vol. Ill, 1903, p. 668), says that "the white rhinoceros (pai se) is an auspicious omen of the first order" (shang jui; quoted in Yen kien lei han, Ch. 410, p. 17 b). But as most of the creatures appearing in the category of such "auspicious omens" are imaginary, it is more than probable that this white rhinoceros owes its existence to pure fancy. The white rhinoceros, therefore, does not rest on good evidence; and I am not convinced that the Chinese were ever acquainted with such a variety. Moreover, the so-called White or Square-nosed Rhinoceros (Rhinoceros simus cottoni) has not yet been traced in Asia, but is restricted to Africa. It is described and illustrated by A. Newton (Proceedings of the Zoological Soc. of London, Vol. I, 1903, pp. 222-224; see ibid., Vol. II, 1903, p. 194), R. Lydekker (The Game Animals of Africa, p. 38, London, 1908), and E. L. Trouessart (Le Rhinoceros blanc du Soudan, Proceedings etc., 1909, pp. 198-200, 3 plates). A fine monograph is devoted to it by E. Heller, The White Rhinoceros (Smithsonian Misc. Collections, Vol. 61, No. 1, Washington, 1913, 31 plates), embodying the results of Colonel Roosevelt's African expedition. As to the "white" color, Mr. Heller observes, "The skins cannot under the most lenient cir? cumstances be classed as white. They are, however, distinctly lighter than those of the black species, and may on this account be allowed to retain their popular designa? tion of white. Their true color is smoke gray of Ridgway, a color conspicuously lighter than the dark clove-brown of their geographical ally, Diceros bicornis." 1 Matters omitted in the Annals of the Reign of K'ai-y?an (713-742) by Wang J?n-yu, written during the Wu-tai period (907-960); see Bretschneider, Bot. Sin., pt. 1, p. 156. 2 The text is quoted in P'ei wen yiinfu (Ch. 8, p. 87 b) as follows: "The country of Tonking sent a rhinoceros-horn of golden color, which was placed in a golden pan in a hall of the palace; the warmth caused by it was felt by every one; the envoy said that it was the cold-dispelling rhinoceros-horn." 3 The complete title runs T'ang Sung Po k'ung leu Vie; it is a cyclopaedia in 100 chapters arranged according to subject-matters dealing with affairs of the T'ang and Sung periods (Ming edition in John Crerar Library, No. 786, in 96 vols.). 4 The exact text is given in P'ei win yiin fu. A sceptre of auspicious augury (Ju i), made from a "heat-dispelling horn" in the possession of the same emperor, is mentioned in Tu yang tsa pien (Ch. b, p. 12; see note 6).

These extracts, ranging from the fifth to the sixteenth century, leave no doubt that during this interval the two words se and si invariably referred to the rhinoceros, that the two species of the single-horned and two-horned animal were recognized, that their geographical distribution was perfectly and correctly known,1 and that the main characteristics of the animal were seized upon. Among these, the horn naturally attracted widest attention, and in most cases was the only part of the animal that came within the experience of the writers. The wondrous lore surrounding the horn, the supernatural qualities attributed to it, led also to fabulous stories regarding the animal itself, which in the midst of impenetrable forests was seldom exposed to the eye of an observer. A lengthy dissertation on the healing properties of the horn, and on its utilization in prescriptions, is added in the Pin ts*ao kang mu; but this matter has no direct relation to our subject.2 Princess T'ung-ch'ang, and consisted of small balls turned from horn, as shown by the description that they were round like the clay pellets used in shooting with the bow tan (No. 10,603). These bows, a combination of a sling with a bow, are still turned out in Peking, and used in slaying birds, to prevent the plumage from being damaged. In India they are known as goolail (Yule and Burnell, Hobson-Jobson, p. 386), and are chiefly employed for exterminating crows, being capable of inflicting severe injuries. Every ethnologist is familiar with these sling-bows or pellet-bows, as they are called, and with the difficult problem presented by their geographical dis? tribution over India, south-eastern Asia, and in the valley of the Amazon in South America (compare G. Antze, in Jahrbuch des Museums f?r V?lkerkunde zu Leipzig, Vol. III, 1908, pp. 79-95; and W. Hough, Am. Anthr., 1912, p. 42). It is further added in the Tu yang, that this horn, when placed in the ground, does not rot, ? a notion presumably originated by occasional finds of fossil horns or those acciden? tally shed by the animal. 1 The case is certainly such that the zoologist, as in so many other cases, is obliged to learn from the historian in regard to the distribution of animals in former periods of history. Our zo?geographers trace the area of the two-horned rhinoceros to Suma? tra, Borneo, Siam, and the Malay Peninsula, and from there extending northward through Burma and Tenasserim to Chittagong and Assam. Our investigation has taught us that it covered in ancient times a much wider geographical zone, including Cambodja, Annam, and southern China, in particular Kuei-chou, Hu-nan, Y?n-nan? and Sze-ch'uan. 2 The theory of Ko Hung or Pao-p'u-tse of the fourth century, as shown above (p. 139), is that the horn can neutralize poison, because the animal devours all sorts; of vegetable poisons with its food. Li Shi-chen states that the horn is non-poisonous^ and is forestalled in this opinion by T'ang SMn-wei. Shavings of the horn, the decoc? tion of which is taken in fever, small-pox, ophthalmia, etc., are still to be had in all Chinese drug-stores. A specimen obtained by me at Hankow was said to come from Tibet. According to S. W. Williams (The Chinese Commercial Guide, p. 95, Hong? kong, 1863), a decoction of the horn shavings is given to women just before parturi? tion and also to frightened children. As stated by the same author, the skin of the animal is likewise employed in medicine. It is made into a jelly which is highly esteemed, and the same is done with the feet (Soubeiran and Thiersant, La ma tike medicale chez les Chinois, p. 47, Paris, 1874). This practice presumably originated in Siam. Monseigneur Pallegoix (Description du royaume Thai ou</page><page sequence="84">154 Chinese Clay Figures The word se is presumably the older of the two, as the ancient Chinese seem to have been first acquainted with this species, while it was still alive in their country; at a somewhat later time, which, how? ever, still ranged in a prehistoric period, they became familiar with the two-horned si. This theory would account for the statement of Li Shi-chen that the ancients were fond of saying se, while later on people inclined toward the word si; and that in the north (the ancient habitat of the se) the word se prevailed, in the south the word si. This came about Siam, Vol. I, p. 156) reports the following: "On attribue beaucoup de vertus ? sa corne, et (chose singulare!) sa peau, quelque ?paisse et coriace qu' eile soit, est re? garded comme un mets delicat et fortifiant pour les personnes faibles. On grille d'abord la peau, on la ratisse, on la coupe en morceaux et on la fait bouillir avec des epices assez longtemps pour la convertir en mature gelatineuse et transparente. J'en ai mange* plusieurs fois avec plaisir, et je pense qu'on pourrait appliquer avec succ?s le meme proe?d? aux peaux de quelques autres animaux." The skin, as well as the horn, the blood, and the teeth, were medicinally employed in Cambodja, notably against heart-diseases (A. Cabaton, Brdve et v?ridique relation des eV6ne ments du Cambodge par Gabriel Quiroga de San Antonio, p. 94, Paris, 1914). In Japan rhinoceros-horn is powdered and used as a specific in fever cases of all kinds (E. W. Clement, Japanese Medical Folk-lore, Transactions As. Soc. of Japan, Vol. XXXV, 1907, p. 20). Ko Hung of the fourth century, as we observed, is the very first Chinese author to develop the theory of the horn as to its ability to detect poison, and as an efficient antidote against poison. He also reasons his theory out, and sup? ports it with arguments of natural philosophy breathing a decidedly Taoist spirit. Nothing appears in his account that would necessitate a cogent conclusion as to his dependence on Indian thought. Indian-Buddhist influence on the Taoism of that period certainly is within the reach of possibility, but like everything else, remains to be proved; and for the time being I can only side with Pelliot (Journal asiatique, 1912, Juillet-Ao?t, p. 149) when he remarks to L. Wieger, "Ici non plus, je ne nie pas la possibility de semblable influence, mais j'estime qu'il faut ?tre tr?s prudent." If a Buddhist text translated from Sanskrit into Chinese in or before the age of Ko Hung, and containing a distinct reference to this matter, can be pointed out, I am willing to concede that Ko Hung is indebted to an Indian source; if such evidence should fail to be forthcoming, it will be perfectly sound to adhere to the opinion that Ko Hung's idea is spontaneous, and the expression of general popular lore obtaining at his time; and there is no valid reason why it should not be. No ancient Sanskrit text containing similar or any other notions concerning this subject has as yet come to the fore; and the evidence in favor of Indian priority is restricted to the slender thread of Ctesias' account (p. 97), which is insufficient and inconclusive. The light-minded manner with which Bushell (Chinese Art, Vol. I, p. 119) dealt in the matter (as if the lore of the horn and the horn itself had only been a foreign import in China!) must be posi? tively rejected. Bretschneider (above, p. 75) no doubt was a saner judge. Neither in ancient India nor in the classical world do we find any trace of such beliefs as those expounded by Ko Hung and his successors, nor a particle of all that Chinese natural philosophy of the horn. Aelian merely reiterates Ctesias; Juvenal (vii, 130) mentions an oil-bottle carved from the horn; the Periplus Maris Erythraei (ed. Fabri cius, pp. 40, 44, 56) refers to the export of the horn from African ports only, not from India. The Cyranides (F. de Mely, Les lapidaires grecs, p. 90) are ignorant of the poison-revealing character of the horn. But for Ctesias, we should be compelled to admit that this belief originated in China and spread thence to India. At any rate, the report of Ctesias stands isolated in the ancient world; the untrustworthy charac? ter of this author is too well known to be insisted upon, and it would be preposterous to build a far-reaching conclusion on any of his statements which cannot be checked by other sources. His text is handed down in poor condition, and as late as by Photius, patriarch of Byzance (820-891), so that I am rather inclined to regard the incriminated passage as an interpolation of uncertain date. The belief in rhinoceros horn being an efficient antidote against poison prevailed in Europe until recent times.</page><page sequence="85">History of the Rhinoceros naturally, as the south bordered on Indo-China, where the two-horned species abounded, and a lively trade in its horn was carried on at all times. Hence in the primeval period represented by the songs of the Shi king the rhinoceros is styled se. The philological students of China will certainly feel somewhat un? easy at the thought that an animal like the rhinoceros should have been within the vision of the early Chinese. We are all wont to look at It seems to have received a fresh impetus from India in the sixteenth century. The Portuguese physician Garcia Ab Horto (Aromatum et Simplicium aliquot, p. 66, Antverpiae, 1567; or Due libri dell' historia dei semplici, aromati, et altre cose che vengono portate dall' Indie Orientali pertinenti all' uso della medicina, p. 58, Venetia, 1582) first reports from personal experience that rhinoceros-horn is employed in Bengal as an antipoisonous remedy, and goes on to tell that this is a fact established by experiments; his story is that of two poisoned dogs?the one who had swallowed double the dose was cured after taking in water a powder prepared from the horn, while the other dog, who had been given but a small quantity of poison and did not receive the remedy of the horn, was doomed to death. Doctor Nicol? Monardes, physician in Sevilla (Delle cose che vengono portate dall* Indie occidentali pertinenti all' uso della medicina, p. 72, Venetia, 1582), has the following account: "L' Unicorno vero e cosa di maggiore effetto, che habbiamo veduto, e nella quale si trova maggiore esperienza; del quale poco si scrive. Solo Philostrato nella vita di Apollonio dice, essere contra il veneno; il que ampliarono molto i Moderni. Bisogna, che sia del vero; perche ne sono molti di falsi, e finti. Io vidi in questa citt? un Vinitiano, che ne port? un pezzo molto grande, e ne dimandava Cinquecento scudi; delquale fece in mia pre senza la esperienza. Prese un filo, e lo unse molto bene con Elleboro, e lo pass? per le creste di due polli; all' uno de'quali diede un poco di Unicorno raso in un poco di acqua comune; e all' altro non diede cosa alcuna. Questo mori tra un quarto di hora; l'altro che prese l'Unicorno dur? due giorni, senza voler mangiare, e alia fine di due giorni mori, secco come un legno. Credo io, che se si desse ad huomo, che non mor rebbe; perche tiene le vie pi? aperte da potere scacciare da se il veneno; e gli si pu? ancho fare de gli altri rimedij, col mezzo de' quali, e coll' Unicorno potrebbe liberarsi. Di tutte queste Medicine compongo io una polvere, che cosi per qualit? manifeste, come per proprietadi occulte ha gran virt?, e e di grande efficacia contra tutti i veneni, e contra le febbri Pestilentiali, ? che habbiano mala qualit?; ? cagione venenosa." Then he describes the composition of this remedy. This European doctor was a contemporary of Li Shi-ehen. Who, after reading the confession of his firm belief in the virtues of rhinoceros-horn, will blame the Chinese physicist? In the court ceremonial of France as late as 1789, instruments of unicorn-horn are said to have been employed for testing the royal food for poison.? Chinese lore of the rhinoceros is based on actual observation and speculation built thereon. Not only, as previously pointed out, are the observations of the Chinese in this line more complete, but even more accurate, than those of the classical peoples. In fact, the Chinese adopted noth? ing from the latter as to their notions of the animal. It is of especial interest that the fantastic belief of the ancients in the mobility of the horn is entirely absent in China. Pliny (Nat. hist., vin, 21, ?73; ed. Mayhoff, Vol. II, p. 103) observes in regard to the animal eale, which has been regarded by some authors as the two-horned rhi? noceros, "It has movable horns several cubits long, which it can alternately raise in a combat and turn straightforward or obliquely, according to opportunity" (maiora cubitalibus cornua habens mobilia, quae alterna in pugna sistit variatque infesta aut obliqua, utcumque ratio monstravit). The mobility of the horn is insisted on by Cosmas: "When it is wandering about, the horns are mobile; but when it sees any? thing which excites its rage, it stiffens them, and they become so rigid that they are strong enough to tear up even trees with the roots ? those especially which come in the way of the front horn" (McCrindle, Ancient India, p. 156). In a similar manner al-Ber?nl (Sachau, Alberuni's India, Vol. I, p. 204) says about the African rhinoceros that its second and longer horn becomes erect as soon as the animal wants to ram with it.</page><page sequence="86">156 Chinese Clay Figures things in the dim candle-light of school traditions, and to think of the rhinoceros as an exclusively southern, tropical animal; but the fact remains that it is not, any more than the tiger, whose original home doubtless was on the Amur, and who is a comparatively recent intruder into Bengal. Climatic conditions and natural surroundings were dif? ferent in ancient China from what they are at present; and the hills were still crowned by dense forests which were haunted by colossal pachy? derms, like the elephant, the tapir, and the rhinoceros.1 The historical fact that the rhinoceros was a living contemporary of the ancient Chinese is fully confirmed by the investigations and results of palaeontology. As early as 1871, F. Porter Smith2 stated, "The teeth of the extinct rhinoceros of China, met with in the caves of Sze ch'uan, are sold as dragon's teeth." Specimens of teeth in the posses? sion of the naturalist D. Hanbury, obtained in Shen-si or Shan-si, were examined by Waterhouse of the British Museum, and referred to Rhinoceros tichorhinus Cuv., Mastodon, Elephas, Equus, and two Hip potheria? Armand David discovered at S?an-hua fu, north-west of Peking, Chili Province, bones from the extremities of a mammal and a nasal bone fragment, which were sent to Paris and determined by Gaudry 4 as belonging to Rhinoceros antiquitatis; and in 1903 M. Schlosser5 was able to show that this species had once been distributed as far south as the Yang-tse. The famous naturalist A. R. Wallace 6 wrote in 187 6 that in northern 1 The alligator is now extinct in the Yang-tse, but has risen to life again in the ancient bone carvings of Ho-nan, and is represented in several excellent specimens in the Field Museum obtained with many others from the late F. H. Chalfant. 2 Contributions towards the Mat. Med. of China, p. 185. Not all "dragon-teeth " (lung chH), however, originate from the rhinoceros. A number of these gathered by me in a drug-store of Hankow and now in the American Museum of New York (Cat. No. 13,847) were examined by the palaeontologist Mr. B. Brown, and contained five teeth of Rhinoceros, one tooth of Mastodon, two teeth of Hipparion (1 m2), and one tooth (P3) of an undescribed Hipparion. The palaeontologist M. Schlosser of Munich (see below) has devoted a careful study to these teeth with remarkable results. Rhinoceros-teeth were employed for medicinal purposes as early as the middle ages. In the Annals of the Sung Dynasty (Sung shi), Biography of Ts'ien Shu (929-988; Giles, Biographical Dictionary, p. 144), there is a record that in the year 963 this prince, ruler of Wu and Y?e, sent as tribute ten thousand ounces of silver, one thousand single rhinoceros-teeth (si ya), fifteen thousand catties of perfume and drugs, and a hundred wrought objects of gold, silver, genuine pearls, and tortoise-shell (P'ei wen yiinfu, Ch. 21, p. 114 b). For the year 983, a tribute of rhinoceros-teeth is re? corded in the same Annals as having been sent from San-fo-ts'i (Palembang on the north-east coast of Sumatra). 3 China Review, Vol. V, 1876, p. 69. 4 Bulletin de la societi geologique de France, Vol. XXIX, 1871-72, p. 178. 6 Die fossilen S?ugetiere Chinas (see below), p. 56. 6 The Geographical Distribution of Animals, Vol. I, p. 123.</page><page sequence="87">History of the Rhinoceros 157 China remains of Hyana, Tapir, Rhinoceros, Chalicotherium, and Elephas, had recently been found, closely resembling those from the Miocene or Pliocene deposits of Europe and India, and showing that the Palasarctic region had then the same great extent from west to east that it has now. Of two species,?complete carcasses with the skin,?the two horns, hair, and well-preserved interior organs, were discovered in frozen soil between the Yenisei and Lena Rivers in Siberia.1 They lived during the ice age, and were covered with a coarse hairy and finely curled coat, the skin being smooth and without the characteristic folds of the now living species. K. A. Zittel2 defines the zone of these two species (Rhinoceros mercki and antiquitatis) as extending over the whole of northern and central Asia, inclusive of China, and over northern and middle Europe.3 The best study of this subject, thus far, has been made by M. Schlosser.4 He records a new species from China (Rhi? noceros habereri)5 in two different types, and two others belonging to the forest fauna, one of which is referred to the two-horned Sumatran type, 1 This first find was made in 1771 on the bank of the river Wilui near 640 N. lat. It was^ first described by the prominent naturalist P. S. Pallas, in his treatise De reliquiis animalium exoticorum per Asiam borealem repertis complementum (in Novi Commentarii Acad. Scient. Petropolitanae, Vol. XVII, 1772, p. 576), and in his Reise durch verschiedene Provinzen des russischen Reichs (Vol. III, p. 97, St. Peters? burg, 1776). Head and feet of this animal are still preserved in St. Petersburg. A fun? damental investigation still remains that of J. F. Brandt, De rhinocerotis antiquitatis seu tichorhini seu pallasii structura externa etc. (MSmoires de VAcad. de St. Peters bourg, series 6, Vol. V, 1849, pp. 161-416). A rich collection of rhinoceros-bones made in the western part of Transbaikalia is in the Museum at Troitskosavsk (com? pare Molleson, in Papers of the Troitskosavsk-Kiachta Section of the Russian Geogr.

For a restoration of the woolly rhinoceros found in Siberia see N. N. Hutchinson, Extinct Monsters, Plate XXI. 3 We know that fossil rhinoceros-horn had attracted the attention of Siberian natives long before it came to the notice of European scientists. It was employed to strengthen their bows, and the belief was entertained that it exerted a beneficial influence on the arrow hitting its mark. (Compare A. E. v. Nordenski?ld, Die Umsegelung Asiens und Europas auf der Vega, Vol. I, p. 367, Leipzig, 1882.) Now we read in the Annals of the Kin Dynasty (Kin shi, Ch. 120, p. 3 a) that the Ni?chi, a Tungusic tribe, availed themselves of rhinoceros-horn for the same purpose; and it may therefore be presumed that they obtained it through the medium of trade from inner Siberia (compare above, p. 95). Fossil rhinoceros-horns have also been found in the valley of the Kolyma River. K. v. Ditmar (Reisen und Aufenthalt in Kamtschatka, Vol. I, p. 37, St. Petersburg, 1890) saw one from that region nearly three feet long, and emphasizes the co-existence there of numerous remains of rhi? noceros, mammoth, and narwhal. 4 Die fossilen S?ugetiere Chinas (Abhandlungen der bay er. Akademie, Cl. II, Vol. XXII, 1903, pp. 1-221, 14 plates). This work is conveniently summed up by H. F. Osborn (The Age of Mammals, pp. 332-335), where an interesting map (p. 505) is added, showing the former and recent distribution of the rhinoceros. The material described by Schlosser is derived from Chinese drug-stores, and was collected by K. Haberer. The author gives also a valuable summary of the localities in China where fossil remains of mammals have been found (pp. 9-19). &amp;L.c, pp. 58-63</page><page sequence="88">Chinese Clay Figures and the other (Rhinoceros brancoi) possibly to the single-horned Indian species. This fact is in striking agreement with the result of our his? torical investigation, according to which these two species were known to the ancient Chinese and distinguished by the two names si and se. In view of the acquaintance of the Chinese with these two species, the question as to the age of the fossil remains is, of course, important. According to the researches of Schlosser, the number of species of fossil rhinoceroses traceable in China amounts to at least seven, three of which originate from the Pleistocene, four from the Pliocene; and Schlosser was able to prove that Rhinoceros sinensis Owen does not rep? resent a species from the Tertiary, as presumed heretofore, but should be rather one from the Pleistocene.1 There is, accordingly, from a geological viewpoint, good reason to believe that several species of rhinoceros could have survived on Chinese soil down to the historic period when man made his first appearance there;2 and it is in the rec? ords of the Chinese that this fact has been preserved to us. It even seems to me (but this is the mere personal impression of a layman, which may not be acceptable to a specialist in this field) that the Chinese rec? ords, in a highly logical manner, fill a gap between the palaeontological facts of Siberia and the present-day existence of the hairy two-horned rhinoceros in south-eastern Asia. If it is admissible to identify the Siberian tichorhinus with the latter species, or to consider the former as the primeval ancestor of the latter, it is conceivable that the Siberian animal, pressed by the advance of the ice, started on a migration south? ward, and first halted in northern China, where it became the si of the Chinese, and whence it finally proceeded south-east. Whatever this fancy may be worth, there can be no doubt of two points,? first, that the ancient Chinese, from the very beginning of their history, were acquainted with two species of rhinoceros, the single-horned and the two-horned ones, distinguished as se and si; and, second, that the 1 L. c, p. 52. 2 We owe to M. Schlosser an interesting discovery in regard to the age of man on Chinese soil. He describes (pp. 20-21) and figures a tooth, a molar (ms) of the left upper jaw, which originates either from man or from a new anthropoid. This tooth is perfectly fossilized, wholly untransparent, and shows between the roots a reddish clay, such as is found only in teeth really coming from the Tertiary, and not from the loess; so that the author is inclined to ascribe to it a tertiary origin, or at all events, a very great age, going back at least to old Pleistocene. A definite solution of the problem cannot be reached at present. "The purpose of this notice is," con? cludes Schlosser, "to call the attention of subsequent investigators, who may have an opportunity of undertaking excavations in China, to the possibility that either a new fossil anthropoid or tertiary man, or yet an old-Pleistocene man, might be found.'' I agree with Schlosser on this point, and regard his discovery, which certainly so far remains entirely hypothetical, as highly suggestive, and pointing in the direction of a future possibility of a new Pithecanthropus being discovered in Chinese soil.</page><page sequence="89">History of the Rhinoceros 159 former is identical with the present Rhinoceros indicus unicornis (as proved above all by the linguistic relationship of the word se with Tibetan bse and Lepcha sa), and the latter with the present Rhinoceros sumatrensis.1 We may now attempt something like a reconstructive history of the rhinoceros in the historical era. At the time of the Shi king, the rhinoce? ros was known to the Chinese as a game-animal. In a song celebrating a hunting-expedition by King S?an, it is said, "We have bent our bows: we have our arrows on the string. Here is a small boar transfixed; there is a large rhinoceros (se) killed." 2 As a metaphor, the name of the animal is employed in another song, in which soldiers constantly occupied on the war-path complain of cruel treatment, and say, "We are not rhinoceroses, we are not tigers, to be kept in these desolate wilds." 8 Also cups carved from rhinoceros-horn (se kung)4 make their debut in the Shi king; and from the passages where it is mentioned, an apparent symbolism is connected with it. In the region of Pin it was customary for the people in the tenth month to visit the palace of their prince with offerings of wine, and "to raise the cup of rhinoceros-horn with wishes for numberless years without end." 5 In another song, a woman yearn? ing for her absent husband takes a cup of wine poured out of a rhinoce? ros-horn, in the hope that her grief will not last forever.6 The idea of the healing property of the horn is possibly here involved. In the Shu king, embodying the most ancient historical records of the nation, the rhinoceros is not directly mentioned, but one of the two principal products yielded by it is alluded to. At least, this is the opin? ion of the Chinese commentators. In the chapter entitled Tribute of Y? (Y? kung), "teeth" and "hide" are stated to have been the produce of the two provinces Yang-chou and King-chou,?the former covering the littoral territories south and north of the Yang-tse delta; the latter, the present area of Hu-nan and Hu-pei. The term "teeth" is interpreted 1 It would now be appropriate to introduce for the two extinct Chinese species the names Rhinoceros unicornis var. sinensis (Chinese se), and Rhinoceros bicornis var. sinensis (Chinese si). 2 Shi king, ed. Legge, p. 292. 3 Ibid., p. 424. 4 Nos. 6393 and 6398. The two characters are read kung (according to T*ang yiin) and kuang (according to Shuo win). 5 Ibid., p. 233. The rhinoceros belongs to the long-lived animals. "Individuals have lived for over twenty years in the London Zoological Gardens, and it is stated that others have been kept in confinement for fully fifty years. Consequently there is no doubt that the animal is long-lived, and it has been suggested that its term of life may reach as much as a century" (R. Lydekker, The Game Animals of India, P-3i). 6 Ibid., p. 9.</page><page sequence="90">i6o Chinese Clay Figures as ivory; the term "hide," as rhinoceros-hide.1 This inference is very reasonable, for the tributes or taxes of those territories cannot have been any ordinary animal teeth or hides of any kind, but they certainly were those teeth and hides most highly prized in the Chou period,? and these were ivory, and rhinoceros-hide desirable for body armor.2 The sov? ereigns of the Chou dynasty hunted the rhinoceros. In b.c. 965, as recorded in the Annals of the Bamboo Books, Chao Wang invaded the country of Ch'u, and crossing the Han River, met with a large single horned rhinoceros (or rhinoceroses). Yi Wang, in b.c. 855, captured, when hunting in the forest of SM, a two-horned rhinoceros, and had it carried home.3 The rhinoceros was also pictured at an early date. When the em? peror mounted his chariot, they posted on both sides of it the lords, whose chariots had red wheels, two crouching rhinoceroses being repre? sented on each wheel; and they posted in front the lords, whose chariots had red wheels with a single tiger represented on each wheel.4 This 1 Legge, Chinese Classics, Vol. III, pp. in, 115; Couvreur, Chou King, pp. 71, 73 (see also Hirth, The Ancient History of China, p. 121). Legge remarks, "This view is generally acquiesced in. Are we to suppose then that the rhinoceros and elephant were found in Yang-chou in Yu's time? They may very well have been so. Hu Wei observes that from the mention or supposed mention of these animals some argue for the extension of the limits of the province beyond the southern mountain range to Kuang-tung, Kuang-si, and Annam, and replies that the princes might be required to send articles of value and use purchased from their neighbors, as well as what they could procure in their own territories." This conclusion of Hu Wei is quite unnecessary. It is merely elicited by the school opinion that the geographical distribution of animals must have been the same anciently as at present. There can certainly be no more erroneous view. Nothing in nature remains unchangeable. All the large mammals formerly had a far wider range, gradually narrowed by natural events and human depredations. We are simply forced to admit that the rhinoceros, as well as the elephant, existed in Yang-chou and King-chou in the times of antiquity. This logically results from the Chinese records, and is a logical inference from a zoo geographic point of view. No jugglery or sophistry, like extension of geographic provinces, misunderstanding of words, or introduction of bovines, is necessary to explain and to understand a fact of such simplicity as this one. 2 The skin of the rhinoceros was utilized in the Chou period also for the manu? facture of a yellow glue employed for the purpose of combining the wooden and horn parts of a bow (Chou li, xliv, Biot's translation, Vol. II, p. 586). The commentator Wang Chao-yu of the twelfth century justly adds that either skin or horn can be made into glue, but that, as far as the rhinoceros is concerned, only the skin is laid under contribution to this end. Naturally, since the horn is too valuable. CMng K'ang ch'?ng assures us that in his time (second century a.D.) the stag-glue was exclusively made from the antlers. It is hardly conceivable that Yang-chou and King-chou should have sent as tribute bovine hides which could be obtained everywhere: the specification of these territories implies a specific material peculiar to them; of wild bovines there, nothing is known. 3 Legge, Chinese Classics, Vol. Ill, Prolegomena, pp. 149, 153; Biot's translation of Chu shu ki nien, pp. 41, 46 (Paris, 1842). Note that the idea of the monoceros hiai-chai originated in the country of Ch'u (above, p. 115, note 2). In the Ch'un ts'iu period, as it appears from a passage of Tso chuan (Legge, Chinese Classics* Vol. V, p. 289), both se and si were still plenty. 4 Chavannes, Les Memoires historiques de Se-ma Ts'ien, Vol. Ill, p. 214.</page><page sequence="91">History of the Rhinoceros 161 juxtaposition of rhinoceros and tiger is noteworthy, for it turns up again in Chuang-tse: "To travel by water and not avoid sea-serpents and dragons,?this is the courage of a fisherman. To travel by land and not avoid the rhinoceros and the tiger,?this is the courage of hunters." 1 And in Lao-tse's Tao te king (Ch. 50): "He who knows how to take care of his life, when travelling by road, never meets rhinoceros or tiger; when entering the army, he does not require defensive or offensive armor. The rhinoceros, therefore, finds no place where to insert its horn, the tiger where to lay its claws, the soldier where to pierce him with his sword."2 Finally in the passage of Lun yii3 already referred to. The extermination of wild animals made rapid progress; the grad? ually advancing Chinese agriculturist cleared the hills and deforested the plains in order to till the ground and to yield the means of subsist? ence for the steadily increasing populace. The famous passage in M$ng-tseA is of primary importance: Chou-kung, the organizer of the government of the Chou dynasty, broke the rebellions and established peace throughout the empire; "he drove far away also the tigers, leop? ards, rhinoceroses, and elephants,? and all the people was greatly delighted." Toward the end of the Chou period (middle of the third century b.c.) the one-horned rhinoceros was, in all likelihood, extinct in northern China; and the two-horned species had gradually withdrawn, and taken refuge in the high mountain-fastnesses of the south-west. The strong desire prevailing in the epoch of the Chou for the horn of the animal, which was carved into ornamental cups, and for its valuable skin, which was worked up into armor, had no doubt contributed to its final destruction in the north. So there is no reason to wonder that to the later authors the extinct animal se was a blank, and offered a convenient field for fanciful speculations.0 1 Giles, Chuang Tz?, p. 214. 2 Compare S. Julien, Le livre de la voie et de la vertu, p. 183. It is noticeable that the word kia, which in Lao-tse's time designated a cuirass of rhinoceros-hide, appears here in close connection with the rhinoceros. 3 Legge, Chinese Classics, Vol. I, p. 307. 4 Legge, The Chinese Classics, Vol. II, p. 281. 5 It is a well-known phenomenon in all languages that newly-discovered animals are named for those already known, for example, that sea-mammals are named for land-mammals to which they bear some outward resemblance, or insects for larger animals. Thus we know a rhinoceros-beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros) with horns or pro? cesses on its head (see Science, 1913, p. 883), and a rhinoceros-bird or hornbill (Buceros rhinoceros) noted for the extraordinary horny protuberance on the crest of its bill. These examples certainly do not mean that our word "rhinoceros" originally referred to an insect or a bird; but in our effort to coin a name for this beetle and bird, we happened to hit upon the rhinoceros, because certain characteristics of it were, by way of comparison, seen in the former. It is exactly the same when the Chinese, in literary</page><page sequence="92">Chinese Clay Figures Se-ma Tslen, the father of Chinese history, who was born in b.c. 145, and died between b.c. 86 and 74, and who in his Historical Memoirs repeatedly mentions the two species, doubtless was personally familiar with them; for he locates them in Sze-eh'uan,1 and we know that he, a great traveller and observer, accompanied the military expedition of the Emperor Wu sent in b.c. hi into Sze-ch'uan and Y?n-nan.2 Again and again, Chinese authors in the beginning of our era point to that ter? ritory as the stronghold of the rhinoceros. We noticed that Kuo P'o of the third century alludes to Mount Liang in Sze-ch'uan as its habitat (p. 94); and we may add to this the weighty testimony of Ctfang K'? style, sometimes designate the buffalo "the water-rhinoceros" (shut se). In the pre Christian era the word se invariably applied to the single-horned rhinoceros, ? a fact confirmed by the concordance of the word with Tibetan (b)se (p. 116). In times following the ultimate extermination of this species on Chinese soil, this word natu? rally fell into disuse and became open to other functions; while si is still retained as the general word for rhinoceros, whether single or two horned. The word se was transferred to the buffalo, because to a naive and primitive mind the two animals, as has been demonstrated by the world-wide propagation of this notion, bear a striking similarity to each other. The attribute "water" fits both with their fond? ness for lying embedded for hours in mud and water. A sequel of this transfer in meaning, then, was the impression of recent Chinese authors that the word se had denoted also the wild buffalo or ox in the times of antiquity. This, of course, is a phantom. The most instructive passage where the words si and shui se are used to? gether in close succession occurs in Sung shi (Ch. 489, p. 1), where it is said, in the chapter on Champa (Chan-ch*6ng), that "the country abounds in peacocks and rhi? noceros (si niu), that the people keep yellow oxen and buffalo (shui niu), and that those engaged in the capture of rhinoceros and elephant (si siang) pay a tax on them to the king; they eat the flesh of wild goats and buffalo (shui se)." In Siam, permis? sion to capture wild elephants must still be obtained from the Government, and for each animal caught a royalty of $150 is paid (C. C. Hansen, Daily Consular and Trade Reports, 1911, p. 751). In mediaeval times when the rhinoceros became grad? ually scarcer on Chinese soil, and the supply of its skin no longer satisfied the de? mand for it, buffalo-hide was substituted for it. Chinese authors, with fair accuracy, indicate the time when this change went into effect. A book Ts'e lin hai ts*o, quoted in the cyclopaedia Yen kien lei han (Ch. 228, p. 4), states in substance that what is designated rhinoceros-hide armor in the T*ang History is at present made from buffalo hide, but continues under the general name "rhinoceros" (si). The Chinese, accord? ingly, were perfectly aware of the fact that the ancient cuirasses were wrought from rhinoceros-hide, and that buffalo-hide was a later substitute. Ch'&amp;ng Ta-ch'ang, who wrote in the latter part of the twelfth century, says in a discourse on defensive armor (inserted in Wu pei chi, published in 1621 by Mao Y?an-i, Ch. 105, p. 4) that the skin of a domesticated animal like the ox is always handy, while the two rhinoceroses si and se cannot be reared, and their skins are not always obtainable; and that in his time armor was produced from buffalo-hide. In T'ang shu (Ch. 41, p. 1) the tribute sent by the district of Kuang-ling in Yang-chou (circuit of Huai-nan) is stated to have consisted of armor made from buffalo-hide (shui se kia). The rhinoceros is here out of the question, as it did not occur in that region; and the geographical chapters of the T'ang Annals give us the best clew to the tracing of the geographical distribution of the rhinoceros in the China of that period. It is worthy of note that the term shui si ("water rhinoceros ") is still employed with reference to the rhinoceros only, not the buffalo. Chung Kia-fu writing in 1845 (Ch*un ts%ao Vang chi, Ch. 30, p. 13) makes the remark that "the cups and dishes carved from rhinoceros-horn (si kio) in his time are not from the genuine rhinoceros (shui si), but from the horn of a wild ox (ye niu) in the countries of the foreign barbarians." 1 Shi ki, Ch. 117, p. 3 b. 2 Chavannes, Les M6moires historiques de Se-ma Ts'ien, Vol. I, p. xxxi.</page><page sequence="93">History of the Rhinoceros of the period of the Tsin dynasty (265-419), who in his interesting work Hua yang kuo chi ascribes colossal rhinoceroses to the country of Pa, the ancient designation for the eastern part of Sze-ch'uan, and further places the animal in the district of Hui-wu, the present Hui-li in the prefecture of Ning-y?an, province of Sze-eh'uan.1 However doubtful the exact date of the work Pie lu may be, the fact remains that it plainly indicates south-western China in its whole range as the geographical area of the rhinoceros (p. 135). With their victorious advance toward the south-east in the third and second centuries b.c., the horizon of the Chinese people widened; and they encountered the two-horned rhinoceros also in Tonking.2 The tributes of live rhinoceroses sent to the Chinese Court from that region have been mentioned (p. 80). Liu Hin-k'i, author of the Records of Kiao-chou, of the fourth or fifth century, gives a perfectly correct description of the two-horned Annamese rhinoceros (p. 93). T'ao Hung-king, the universal genius of the fifth and sixth centuries, logically combines the ancient information relative to the south-west with the additional experience coming from the conquered south-east: Hu-nan, Y?n-nan, and Kiao-chou in Tonking, according to him, represent the home of the rhinoceros (p. 136). This alliance of the two geographical zones is a fact of the greatest interest, for this observation of T'ao Hung king incontrovertibly proves that the word si can but signify the rhinoceros, and particularly the two-horned species. When the Chinese first struck the rhinoceros of Annam, the matter is not reported as a novel experience; but they merely renewed an old experience which they had long before made in their own country, and applied the same familiar word to it. If the si of Tonking is the rhinoceros (and there is not an atom of doubt about it) ,3 the si formerly recorded in Sze-ch'uan, Y?n-nan, 1 Playfair, No. 2480 (2d ed., No. 2341). The passages referred to are in Hua yang kuo chi, Ch. 1, p. 2 b; Ch. 3, p. 23 (ed. of Han Wei ts'ung shu). 2 TsHen Han shu, Ch. 28 b, p. 17. Thus the pseudo-embassy of the Emperor Marc Aurel, presenting in 166 a.d. the Annamese products ivory, rhinoceros-horn and tortoise-shell, and mentioned in the Annals of the Later Han Dynasty (Hirth, China and the Roman Orient, pp. 42, 176), was not the first to make the rhinoceros horn of Annam known to the Chinese, who were acquainted with it at least two cen? turies earlier. 3 The fact is still evidenced by present-day conditions and the continuous trade carried on at all times in rhinoceros-horn from Annam to China. Compare G. Deveria, Histoire des relations de la Chine avec P Annam, pp. 41, 88 (Paris, 1880); S. W. Williams (The Chinese Commercial Guide, p. 94) states that the best sort of rhinoceros-horn comes from Siam and Cochinchina, selling at times for $300 apiece, while that from India, Sumatra, and southern Africa, represents an inferior sort, and sells for $30 and upwards apiece. For the middle ages we have the testimony of Chao Ju-kua (Hirth's and Rockhill's translation, p. 46). As has been pointed out, the word se gradually sank into oblivion in the post-Christian era, and was superseded by the exclusive use of the word si, which was then applied also to the</page><page sequence="94">164 Chinese Clay Figures etc., must likewise be the rhinoceros; andT*ao Hung-king is our witness in establishing the identity of the animal as occurring in the Chinese and Indo-Chinese zones. This fact is borne out also by the coincidence of the definitions contributed by Kuo P'o and Liu Hin-kl. In the T'ang period (618-906) the animal must have been plentiful in many parts of China. The geographical section in the Annals of that dynasty carefully enumerates the various articles sent up to the capital as taxes from every district; and it is the local products which come into question. Besides, rhinoceros-horn, as far as I know, was not imported at that time from beyond the sea. The present terri? tory of the province of Hu-nan in central China seems to have then abounded in the animal,1 for no less than eight localities within its boundaries are on record which furnished rhinoceros-horn to the Court: viz., Li-yang in Li chou, circuit of Shan-nan; Wu-ling in Lang-chou; K'ien-chung in K?ien-ehou; Lu-k'i in Ch*en-ehou; Lu-yang in Kin chou; Ling-kl in K'i chou (modern Yung-shun fu); Kiang-hua in Tao chou, circuit of Kiang-nan; and Shao-yang in Shao-chou. Rhinoceros horn was further supplied from Lung-k'i in Tsiang-chou, from T*an yang in S?-chou, Sze-ch'uan; from Ts'ing-hua in Shi-chou (now Shi nan fu) in Hu-pei Province; from Yi-ts'uan2 in Yi-chou, province of Kuei-chou; from Annam; and elephants and rhinoceroses were sent from Ling-nan (Kuang-tung), forming the southern part of Yang-chou.3 Is it conceivable that the tribute of those regions should have con? sisted of bovine horns which have hardly any commercial value? From mediaeval times onward, as the geographical knowledge of the Chinese more and more advanced, and their intercourse and trade with the nations of the southern ocean increased, they became cognizant of the existence of the rhinoceros in India, 4 Java,5 and Sumatra, and even single-horned rhinoceros. The rhinoceros of India is indeed designated si (Hou Han shu, Ch. 118, p. 5 b; Nan shi, Ch. 78, p. 7; T'ang shu, Ch. 221 a, p. 10 b). This proves again that the word si refers to the rhinoceros, and to this animal only. 1 Hu-nan, as said before, is mentioned also by T'ao Hung-king. In this province formerly occurred both the rhinoceros and the elephant, furnishing hide and ivory, respectively, at the time of the Chou dynasty (Hirth, The Ancient History of China, p. 121, and above, p. 159). In Hu-nan fangwu chi, "Records of the Local Products of Hu-nan" (Ch. 3, p. 14; edition of 1846), it is stated that there was rhi? noceros-horn among the local products sent as tribute from Heng-chou; the text is quoted from Kiu y? chi, a geographical description of China, which, according to Bretschneider (Bot. Sin., pt. 1, p. 162), was published in 1080 a.D. 2 Playfair, Nos. 6381, 6713 (2d ed., No. 5701). 3 Playfair, No. 8350 (2d ed. No. 3939).

Papers relating to Indo-China, Vol. I, p. 139). The Sung shi (Ch. 489; Groeneveldt, i bid., p. 144) reports a tribute from Java</page><page sequence="95">History of the Rhinoceros Africa. The interesting notes of Chao Ju-kua written in 1225/ em? inently translated and interpreted by Hirth and Rockhill, afford an excellent view of all the localities from which rhinoceros-horn was traded to China, during the middle ages;2 he refers to the Berbera coast as producing big horns (p. 128), and records them also for the island of Pemba (p. 149).3 Returning to China, we find trustworthy accounts, according to which the rhinoceros has persisted there in some localities at least down to the thirteenth century. Kuo Y?n-tao, who composed an elabo? rate history of Sze-eh'uan in the thirteenth century,4 states that the region of the aboriginal tribes of the south-west (Si-nan I) harbors a great number of rhinoceroses and elephants; and this agrees with the above statement of Su Sung (p. 140) that rhinoceros-horns came from Sze-ch'uan at the same period. As the author includes also the prov? ince of Kuei-chou, we are allowed to presume that the two-horned rhinoceros still inhabited the forests of Sze-ch*uan and Kuei-chou during the age of the Sung dynasty (960-1278).5 In the year 987, as narrated in the Annals of the Sung Dynasty,6 a rhinoceros penetrated from the southern part of K'ien into Wan-chou7 where people seized and slew it, of short swords with hilts of rhinoceros-horn or gold, and records the word ti-mi as the native name of the rhinoceros. This word is not Javanese, in which the animal is called warak, but is presumably traceable to the Kawi language (compare the discussions of this word by G. Schlegel, T'oung Pao, Vol. X, 1899, p. 272; and P. Pelliot, Bull, de V'Ecole frangaise, Vol. IV, 1904, p. 310). 1 Pelliot, T'oung Pao, 1912, p. 449. 2 At least as early as the fifth century, carved objects of rhinoceros-horn were traded to China from the Roman Orient and India (Hirth, China and the Roman Orient, p. 46). In the year 730 a tribute of rhinoceros-horn from Persia is mentioned (Chavannes, T'oung Pao, 1904, p. 51). 3 The Geography of the Ming Dynasty (Ta Ming i Fung chi, ed. of 1461, Ch. 91, fol. 20) lists rhinoceros-horn also among the products of Arabia (THen-fang). Un? der the Ming, rhinoceros-horn was imported to China from Champa, Cambodja, Malacca, Borneo, Siam, Bengal, and rhinoceros-flesh from Java. These data are derived from the Si yang ch%ao kung tien lu by Huang Sh6ng-tseng, published in 1520 (reprinted in Pie hia chai ts%ung shu); this is the most convenient work on the coun? tries of the Indian Ocean and on Chinese knowledge of them during the Ming, and gives more information than the Ming Annals. 4 Shu kien (Ch. 10, p. 1), reprinted in Shou shan ko ts'ung shu, Vol. 23. The pref? ace of Li W&amp;n-tse is dated 1236. 5 It might seem that the rhinoceros was extinct in China proper at the time of the Yuan period (1271-1367), judging from a remark made by Chou Ta-kuan, in his Memoirs on the Customs of Cambodja, to the effect that the latter country har? bors the rhinoceros, elephant, the wild buffalo, and the mountain-horse, which do not occur in China (Pelliot, Bulletin de V Ecole frangaise, Vol. II, 1902, p. 169); but the passage is by no means conclusive, and may simply be interpreted in the sense that the author had never seen or heard of a rhinoceros in China. 6 Sung shi, Chapter Wu hing chi, quoted in TKu shu tsi ch'?ng (Chapter on Rhi? noceros). 7 Now the district of Wan in K'uei-chou fu, Sze-ch'uan Province.</page><page sequence="96">Chinese Clay Figures keeping its skin and horn. It should be remembered that Li Shi-eMn, who lived in the sixteenth century, still assigned to the rhinoceros the southern portion of Y?n-nan and the adjoining Tibetan regions. Even at the present time the rhinoceros may still exist in isolated spots on Chinese territory. Johan Neuhof 1 locates it in the province of Sze-efruan, particularly near the small town of Po (P'a is presumably meant). O. Dapper 2 appropriates to the rhinoceros Sze~ch'uan and Chucheu fu (?) in Kuang-si. Du Halde 3 ascribes the rhinoceros to the prefecture of Wu-chou in Kuang-si. L. Richard4 states, "On account of the devastation prevailing in Kuang-si, a great number of wild animals are found there: the tiger, rhinoceros, panther, tapir, wolf, bear, and fox." The zoologist W. Marshall, 5 in a general summary of the Chinese fauna, observes that the south, and particularly the south-west, of China, harbor decidedly Indian types of mammals, among these the Indian tapir and the single-horned rhinoceros. The products yielded by an animal, and the manner of their utiliza? tion, allow also conclusive evidence in regard to the nature of the animal itself. That rhinoceros-horn was worked in ancient times and well differentiated from other ordinary horn, is evidenced by the curious fact that three distinct verbs pertaining to the treatment of ivory, ordinary horn, and rhinoceros-horn, are listed in the dictionary Erh ya. The carving of ivory is designated by the word ku (No. 6248); the treat? ing of ordinary horn (kid), by the word hio;6 the carving of rhinoceros horn (si), by the word ts'o or ts'uo (No. 11,766). In the latter case Mr. Giles, in the second edition of his Dictionary, has justly retained the meaning "to make rhinoceros-horn into cups; to carve." The word is apparently identical with is'o (No. 11,778), meaning "to file, trim, cut, plane, polish," etc., including all the various manipulations of the carver. At this point it may not be amiss to call to mind the fact that a 1 Die Gesantsehaft der ostindischen Geselschaft, p. 348 (Amsterdam, 1669). 2 Beschryving des Keizerryks van Taising of Sina, p. 230 (Amsterdam, 1670). 3 A Description of the Empire of China, Vol. I, p. 121 (London, 1738). 4 Comprehensive Geography of the Chinese Empire, p. 198 (Shanghai, 1908). 5 Die Tierwelt Chinas (Zeitschrift f?r Naturwissenschaften, Vol. 73, 1900, p. 73). 6 Composed of the classifier kio ('horn') at the foot, and the phonetic comple? ment Mo ('to learn').

The definition of the word Mo given by the Shuo win ? chi Mo ("to treat horn") ? calls for attention, any word like cutting or carving being avoided. The ancient Chinese were familiar with all processes of horn-work (soaking, slicing, welding, etc.), which are described in the Chou li.</page><page sequence="97">History of the Rhinoceros 167 rhinoceros-horn is capable of being carved, but that the horn of a bovine animal cannot be carved. These horns, biologically, are entirely dif? ferent in origin and structure. The Chinese were quite right in re? garding the rhinoceros-horn as a marvel of nature, for it is a unique phenomenon of creation. It is composed of a solid mass of agglutinated hairs or bristles, and has no firm attachment to the bones of the skull, which are merely roughened and somewhat elevated so as to fit into the concave base of the solid horn. Ox, sheep, or antelope, however, have hollow horns; deer and giraffe, bony antlers. None of these is fit to be worked into a cup; and a cup carved from a horn can mean nothing but one carved from rhinoceros-horn. Horns of bovine animals, as we all know, may be utilized as drinking-vessels, or, as among primitive tribes, as powder-flasks, or, as among the Tibetans, even as snuff-bottles, or, as in India, to pour out holy water; but they are by nature made ready for use, and do not require any carving. The se kung of antiquity are certainly cups carved from rhinoceros-horn,1 not cups of buffalo horn, as Mr. Giles (No. 10,298) has it in the second edition of his Dictionary. Naturally, none of those ancient drinking-horns has survived, but at a later time they were imitated in bronze. There are, at least, some bronze drinking-cups preserved, which are connected by Chinese archaeologists with the drinking-horns of antiquity. In the Po ku tu Im (Ch. 16, p. 16) an illustration (Fig. 23) is given under the title Han hi shou pei ("cup with the head of a sacrificial bull, of the Han period"). A similar bronze (Fig. 24) is figured in the Kin shi so, with the legend Chou se kung ("rhinoceros-horn cup of the Chou period").2 The text of the Po ku tu lu quotes the passage of the Shi king in which the se kung are spoken of (above, p. 159), and says that this bronze cup comes very near to them. The bull-head is certainly a feature which originated only subsequently in bronze-casting, when the accepted forms of the horn cups were imitated in bronze. It is noticeable that the cup, as figured in the Sung Catalogue of Bronzes, corresponds in a measure to the form of a rhinoceros-horn inverted and hollowed out from the base. 1 Likewise Palladius (Vol. I, p. 136) and Couvreur (p. 451). 2 The authenticity of the specimen of the Kin shi so seems somewhat contestable. The head is that of a stag, but is equipped with ox-horns. The dating in the Chou period is arbitrary and unsupported by evidence. It is remarked in the explanatory text that it is not known whether the piece is a rhinoceros-horn cup (se hung). The similarity of the two specimens (Figs. 23, 24) with the rhyton of the Greeks is appar? ent, but there is no necessity of assuming an historical interrelation of the two types. Both were independently developed from natural horns used as drinking-cups, which were subsequently imitated in more durable materials, like clay and metal. Moreover, the Greek rhyton has a feature lacking in the Chinese specimens,? a single oblong loop-handle.</page><page sequence="98">i68 Chinese Clay Figures As stated by a great number of commentaries,1 the se kung were carved from wood if rhinoceros-horn were lacking. Certainly, there could have never been any want of bovine horns; and it is inconceivable that an ox-horn should have been ever reproduced in wood.

Moreover, these horn vessels were differentiated according to their capacities: the vessel kio (No. 2218) containing one pint (sMng); the vessel ku (No. 6221), two pints; the vessels (No. 1925), three pints;1 the vessels ("horn"), four pints;2 the vessel kung or kuang (No. 6393), seven pints. All of these served the same purpose,?they were filled with wine; and the ancient tradition is that the bad or tardy disciple, or whoever had violated a rule or lost a game, was forced to empty the horn at a draught by way of punishment.3 Now, there could be no greater absurdity than to suppose that these drinking-horns were veritable ox-horns, whether from a wild or domesticated ox, and were emptied at a draught by those wretched fellows. Every former German student knows from experi? ence that an ox-horn contains such a volume of liquor, that even the strongest drinker in the world could not empty it at a draught; and every one who has lived among the Chinese is acquainted with those tiny bits of porcelain cups from which they enjoy their hot rice-wine during meals, and knows how limited their abilities in Baccho are. The punishment of forcing a negligent student to do away with a quantity of wine contained in a buffalo-horn would certainly have been most efficient in killing him instantly and saving further trouble about him; that, however, was not the intention of the law-giver. Naturally, these drinking-cups of early antiquity were nothing but miniature cups carved from rhinoceros-horn. Indeed, it is the very horn of the rhino? ceros, which renders this cup eligible as a fit means of correction, for "the horn of the rhinoceros is terrible to its enemies; and for this reason the holy emperors of old, in condemning a man to empty a cup by way of punishment, wanted it to be made from rhinoceros-horn." 4 The terror which the animal was able to inspire in man should be brought home to the mind of the culprit, and this was the essential point of his punishment. Similar was the idea when the rhinoceros-horn cup was emptied on the occasion of a vow; as in ttt? case of the three lords who pledged fidelity to the King of Tsin, with imprecations of calamities to 1 According to Shuo win (Ch. 11, p. 4), four pints; while the vessel shang (No. 9744) held three pints. 2 Compare the dictionary Kuang ya by Chang I, written in the first part of the third century (Ch. 8, p. 5 b; edition of Han Wei tsxung shu). 3 Compare Biot, Chou li, Vol. I, p. 259; Vol. II, p. 17.

We have seen that the single-horned rhinoceros se existed in the country of Ch'u in the beginning of the Chou dynasty (p. 160), and it was among the people of Ch'u that the notion and word hiai chai originated (p. 115). The transformation into a goat of what originally was the rhinoceros was developed by the notion of "butting" under the influence of a legend emanating from Ch'u, which unfortunate? ly is lost. In past times the rhinoceros was so plentiful in the home of the Chinese, that carvings from its horn belonged to the common household objects, especially at the period before the utilization of metals, when wood, bone, horn, antler, and stone furnished the material for the making of implements. There are other objects stated to have been made of rhinoceros horn, where the supposition that ox-horn might be involved is again out of the question. In the biography of Li Se, who died in b.c. 208,4 objects carved from rhinoceros-horn and ivory (si siang kH) are men? tioned, and classed among ob jets de vertut Implements of ox-horn would certainly not rank in this category. According to Hou Han shu* seals were cut out of rhinoceros-horn and ivory. Everybody knows the 1 Tschepe, /. c.

When Kao Yao administered justice and entertained doubts of a man's guilt, he ordered this goat to disentangle the case: it butted the guilty party, but spared the innocent (Forke, Lun-heng, pt. n, p. 321). 4 Giles, Biographical Dictionary, p. 464. 5 Shi ki, Ch. 87, p. 2 b. 6 Ch. 40, p. 5 a.</page><page sequence="102">*72 Chinese Clay Figures square and rectangular cubes in which Chinese seals are shaped, and to cut such a seal out of ox-horn is impossible. Finally, the memorable passage in the Chou li from which we started, and that is discussed in the following chapter, regarding the manufacture of hide armor, is sufficient evidence in itself that the hide in question is only that of the rhinoceros. Mr. Giles renders the words se and si indiscriminately by "bovine animal;" it is manifest, however, from the text in question, that se and si are two distinct animals, but can by no means be two distinct bovine animals. It will be seen that the Chou li speaks of three kinds of cuirasses,? those made from the hide of the two-horned rhinoceros (si), which consist of seven layers, and will last a hundred years; those made from the hide of the single-horned rhinoceros (se), which consist of six layers, and will last two hundred years; and those made from a combination of both hides, which consist of five layers, and will last three hundred years. The skin of the rhinoceros was utilized for the manufacture of hide armor, because it was the thickest and strongest known in the animal kingdom,1 and because the rhinoceros was justly considered a strong, warlike, and long-lived creature (see p. 159); and the qualities of the animal were believed to be transfused into the body of the wearer of the cuirass. The single-horned rhinoceros was the bigger and stronger of the two species known; and for this reason armor from its hide was believed to last twice as long as that of the two-horned kind. We notice that there is a close interrelation between the number of layers of the hide and the number of years that the armor is supposed to endure. All this becomes intelligible only if we interpret the two words se and si in the manner that has been proposed.2 But what would the interpretation be if the armor of the Chou had been made from the hide of wild bovine animals? The passage, in this case, could receive no intelligent and convincing interpretation. That bovine hide can be utilized in the making of armor, nobody denies. It is utterly inconceivable, however, that the ancient Chinese should have taken the trouble to hunt wild bovine animals, in order to secure their skins for cuirasses, since they were in possession of plenty of domestic cattle from which leather was obtainable; and this one certainly could 1 The toughness and durability of rhinoceros-hide are indicated also by its utiliza? tion in the coffin of the Son of Heaven, which was fourfold. The innermost coffin was formed by hide of water-buffalo and rhinoceros, each three inches thick. This leather case was enclosed in a coffin of white poplar timber; and this one, in two others of catalpa-wood (Couvreur, Li ki, Vol. I, p. 184; Legge's translation in Sacred Books of the East, Vol. XXVII, p. 158). 2 The fact that the general notion of leather and hide (pH ko) was closely associ? ated with rhinoceros-skin is evidenced by Yen Shi-ku defining that term by the words si se (TsHen Han shu, Ch. 28 b, p. 16 b).</page><page sequence="103">History of the Rhinoceros 173 have been employed with greater facility and the same result for the purpose of defence. And if they had really employed cowhide to this end, why should the Chou li not simply state that cuirasses were made of this material (niu pH)? Why should it introduce the story of two won? derful animals se and si, interwoven with religious beliefs of longevity, if nothing but a mere every-day cowhide was at issue? On the other hand, there is every reason to believe that the skin of ox or cow was never, for religious reasons, employed in ancient China in the making of armor. The ox was a sacred, and in a measure inviolable animal, looked upon as the helpmate in gaining man's daily bread. He was the animal sacrificed to the deities Heaven and Earth. There is no account to the effect that neat-leather was ever employed for cuirasses; while the tradition that rhinoceros-skin is a fit material for this purpose, as we saw, has been maintained even by later authors.</page><page sequence="104">II. DEFENSIVE ARMOR OF THE ARCHAIC PERIOD "Your subject has heard that the army of the Son of Heaven is rather maintained for the assurance of peace than for the purpose of aggressive war. The Empire and all its inhabitants being your own, is it worth while wast? ing a day's business on the land of the Barbarians, or driv? ing a single horse to exhaustion on their behalf?" Memorial of Huai-nan-tse to the Emperor Wu. Defensive armor, as employed in the epoch of antiquity, is char? acterized by the absence of any metal.1 During the Chou period (b.c. 1122-255) harness was exclusively made of hide (lorica of the Romans). Ts'ai Ch'en, in his commentary to the Shu king (published in 1210), makes this correct general observation on the subject: "In ancient canonical literature it is a question only of cuirasses (kia. No. 1167) and leather helmets (chou, No. 2463). Prior to the time of the Ts'in, metal armor (k*ai, No. 5798) and metal helmets (tou mou, Nos. 11,424, 8041) were not in existence. The ancients availed them? selves of hide for the making of armor (kid). From the time of the 1 It is not the object of the present investigation to give a detailed history of Chinese defensive armor of all periods, or to describe each and every type of armor mentioned in Chinese records. Such a task would require dwelling at great length on the military organization and activities of every dynasty, and would swell into several volumes of questionable practical value. It is merely my intention to outline the principal and conspicuous features of the general development of the matter, and to emphasize those types of armor which are of particular interest to the archaeologist and ethnologist. Only those Chinese records which have a real value for an historical consideration of this subject are here exhibited. The theories of the philosophers and the later legendary inventions are historically worthless, and only interesting for what they are worth,? in their quality as philosophy, poetry, or folk-lore. A pure fable it is, for example, when the philosopher Kuan-tse makes Ch'i Yu (alleged b.c. 2698) the first inventor of metal armor (k*ai), and when as late a work as the T'ai po yin king by Li Ts?an of the middle of the eighth century (Wylie, Notes on Chinese Literature, p. 90) is gracious enough to ascribe to the same also the honor of having first cut hide into armor, and goes on to construct the evolutionary scheme that Sh&amp;n-nung made weapons of stone, Huang-ti of jade, and Ch'i Yu of bright met? al. The famous Ts'ao Chi (192-232) is credited with the statement that the former emperors bestowed on officials an armor (k'ai) called "brilliant like ink" (mo kuang) and another called "brilliant like light" (ming kuang), one suit of armor with a double seat in the trousers (liang tang [No. 10,727] k'ai), one suit of ring and chain armor (huan so kKai), and one suit of horse mail. This text is not well authenticat? ed, and is hardly deserving of historical credence. The ring and chain armor is an anachronism in view of Ts'ao Chi's time; and any armor of the designation k'ai did not exist under the ancient emperors. The expression huan so k'ai occurring in this passage is explained in the dictionary Cheng tse Vung as identical with so kia ("chain armor"). TKu shu tsi ch'ing, in reproducing this passage, writes mo kuang, as above; P'ei win yiin fu has in its place hei kuang ("of black brilliancy"); and Ko chi king yuan has li (No. 6870) kuang, which seems to be a misprint. The two latter works write the character tang in the phrase liang tang k'ai without the classifier 145. 174</page><page sequence="105">Defensive Armor of the Archaic Period 175 Ts*in and Han, iron armor and helmets (fie kxai mou) gradually came into use. These two characters (kxai mou) are formed with the classifier 4metal' (kin), for these objects were made from iron." This chronologi? cal division of words and matters, indeed, corresponds to the facts as expressed in the documents of literature. The comment of Ts*ai ChtAn relates to the speech of the Prince of Lu, Po K?in, son of Chou Kung (Shu king, IV, 19), in which he admonished his soldiers to see that their cuirasses and helmets were well sewed together (that is, were in good order), and that the laces of their shields were well secured. In this passage the three means for making the complete defensive armor of the primeval epoch are named; and these are followed by the three principal representatives of offensive armor,? the bow, the long and the short spears. We meet in the early period essentially two varieties of hide armor, distinguished by two different words, kia (No. 1167) and kiai (No. 1518). The latter, as will be seen (p. 195), was scale armor, composed of im? bricated leather pieces which were cut out in the shape of scales (com? pare Plate XIV). The former was a cuirass made in imitation of a coat. Our knowledge of this device is mainly founded on the State Handbook containing the ritual and institutes of the Chou dynasty, the Chou li. A special office of armorers was instituted at the Court of the Chou dynasty; they were called han jen, "men who envelop (han, No. 3809) the body with a protective contrivance." The manufacture of these military leathern costumes is minutely described in the Chou li.1 "The armorers make the cuirasses (kia). Those made from the hide of the two-horned rhinoceros (si) consist of seven layers of hide; those made from the hide of the single-horned rhinoceros (se) consist of six layers; those made from a combination of both hides consist of five layers. The first endure a hundred years; the second, two hundred years; the third, three hundred years. In order to accomplish a cuirass, first, a form (dummy) is made,2 and then the hide is cut in accordance with it. The hide pieces are weighed; and two piles equal in weight are apportioned, the one for the upper, the other for the lower part of the cuirass. The long strips, into which the hide has been cut up, 1 Biot, Vol. II, p. 506. The work of Biot is here, as in other instances, quoted for easy reference, as by referring to Biot the Chinese text may readily be looked up; but my rendering is based on the original text, and on several points deviates from that of Biot, and fundamentally, in this passage descriptive of armor. 2 The dummy was patterned according to the figure of the individual for whom the cuirass was intended, and the hide was tailored and adjusted in correspondence with the dummy. It was left on the latter for some time, until it was thoroughly hardened and had assumed the required shape. The process was the same as that still practised on a smaller scale by the Chinese hatters, who fashion their caps over wooden models.</page><page sequence="106">176 Chinese Clay Figures are laid around horizontally. In general when the hide has not been properly cured, the cuirass is not strong;1 when the hide is worn out, it will wrinkle. The method of inspecting cuirasses is as follows: the stitches, when examined, must be fine and close; the inner side of the hide must be smooth; the seams are required to be straight; the cuirass must perfectly fit into the case in which it is to be enclosed.2 Then it is taken up,3 and when examined, it must allow of ample space. When it is donned, it must not wrinkle. When the stitches are examined, and found to be fine and close, it is a sign that the hide is strong. When the inner side is examined, and found to be smooth, the material is well prepared and durable. When the seams are examined, and found to be straight, the cutting is perfect. When it is rolled up and placed in its case, it should fold closely. When, however, it is taken out, it should offer ample space to the wearer, and it is then beautiful.4 When it is donned without wrinkling, it will gradually adjust itself to the form of the trunk." We gather from this account that the ancient hide corselets were not downright primitive affairs, but testify to an advanced stage of culture. Armor, as early as that archaic period, was individual, and carefully adapted to the shape of the body. Its weight was equally balanced between the upper and lower portions, the former reaching from the shoulders to the loins, the latter from the loins to the knees. Ap? parently it was but one uniform coat, without sleeves, and without any separate parts for protection, as nape-guards, greaves, knee-covers, or 1 Biot translates, "En g^ne'ral, si la facon n'est point parfaite, la cuirasse n'est pas solide." And Couvreur (Dictionnaire chinois-francais, p. 799), "Toute cuirasse d'un travail imparfait n'est pas solide." My rendering is based on the comment of Ch?ng Ngo. 2 The cuirass was rolled up and encased in a covering, presumably of hide. This case wasstyled kao (No. 5949), a^ word now used in the sense of "quiver." Hide bags in which to preserve armor are still used in Tibet, and there is one in the Museum's collection. The Chinese now avail themselves of trunks with a special compartment in the lid for the helmet (compare Plate XLIII). 3 The first test that the cuirass is exposed to refers to its fitting into the case; the second, to its fitting on the wearer; for this purpose it is taken out of the case. 4 As will be seen from Biot's comment, the K'ien-lung editors hold that the last two qualities are difficult to reconcile, as, on the one hand, the cuirass must fit like a coat without throwing folds, and, on the other hand, must have ample space and splendor. I do not believe that this objection is very serious. The conditions stipu? lated in the text could all, indeed, be fulfilled. The essential requisite was elasticity to grant full freedom of motion; the cuirass must be tight-fitting, but if the hide is sufficiently elastic, "ample space" is secured to the wearer. Owing to its flexible character it could be readily rolled up, and, when taken out of its case, immediately reverted to its original shape, so that it could be donned without loss of time. The word ming ("brilliant") translated by Biot "alors eile a del'^clat," I believe, means something like "it is then in evidence, it fulfils its purpose."</page><page sequence="107">Defensive Armor of the Archaic Period 177 buskins.1 The hide was well cured, and the inner side cleaned from all adhering impurities. My conception of the technicalities in the construction of this armor is widely different from that of Biot based on the opinions of the Chinese commentators. These interpret that the cuirass made from the hide of the two-horned rhinoceros consisted of seven pieces sewed together; that from the hide of the one-horned rhinoceros, of six; and that made from a combination of both, of five pieces. There is no sense in this point of view of the matter. The commentators of the Han and later ages were unable to form a clear idea of the cuirass peculiar to the Chou period, because it was lost in their time; and they merely applied to the latter the notions which they had gained from a consideration of contem? poraneous armor. The armor terminology of the Han was read into Chou armor, and a purely philological reconstruction was reached, which hardly corresponds to a living reality. The armor, as interpreted by the Chinese scholars, in my opinion, is technically impossible, and beyond our experience: armor-suits of such requirements have been made nowhere in this world, and in all likelihood never could have been made.2 There is no raison oVUre in assuming that the first should have been 1 Red knee-covers and buskins are mentioned in the Shi king, but they were outfits belonging to the costume of ceremony, not of war (Legge, Chinese Classics, Vol. IV, Prolegomena, p. 157, and p. 402). 2 For technical reasons it is highly improbable that the hide armor of the Chou was sewed together from different pieces, because such a process would considerably diminish its strength and capability of resistance, and a blow struck at the seams would have had dangerous consequences. On the contrary, wherever hide armor was made, the principle was quite naturally developed to make it, as far as possible, in one piece; and this is exactly the point where the chief purpose of defensive armor comes in. If the Chou cuirass had been patched together from odd pieces, as the later Chinese philologists would make us believe, it could not have been a defensive armor proper, but simply a skin garment. W. Hough (Primitive American Armor, Report U. S. National Museum, 1893, p. 641) informs us that "American skin armor was always made in one piece folded over, sewed above the shoulders, leaving an orifice for the head and with a hole cut out of the left side for the left arm, the right side of the garment remaining open; the skin was often doubled, but more frequently the coat was reinforced with pieces of thick hide." Indeed, our Chou armor, cum grano salis, can have been no other in type and appearance than the hide armor of the American Indians, as figured on our Plate XI and by Hough on Plates XVI-XIX, although it may have been somewhat more elegant in its fit to the individual wearer. Hough (pp. 645, 646) furnishes several examples of the fact that hide armor in America was worked in several layers; thus, two, three, or more folds of the strongest hides were employed by the Nass Indians of the Tsimshian stock; a great many folds of dressed antelope-skins by the Shoshoni; and the Navajo singer chants of suits of armor made of several layers of buckskin. Likewise A. P. Niblack (The Coast Indians of Southern Alaska, Report U. S. National Museum, 1888, p. 268) states that the leather jerkins formerly made in Alaska were of one, two, or three thicknesses of hide, and in itself offered considerable resistance to arrows, spears, or dagger thrusts. Armor of rhinoceros-hide, according to Nachtigall, is still made and employed by the Arabs of the Sudan (H. Schurtz, Grundz?ge einer Philosophie der Tracht, p. 114).</page><page sequence="108">i78 Chinese Clay Figures made in seven, the second in six, and the third in five pieces; moreover, they double these figures, and conjecture that the upper portion (shang Iii) and the lower portion Qiia Iii) each consisted of this number of pieces. But how can such an affair be realized? It is perfectly conceivable that a coat is composed of six pieces (two in front, two in the back, and two on the sides); any other even number?as four, eight, ten, or more?likewise is imaginable. It is not easily conceivable, however, as being incompatible with a normal state of affairs, that a cuirass should have consisted of seven or five pieces (or any larger odd number of pieces), as the Chinese commentators and Biot would have us believe. This supposition is not very reasonable. The symmetry of the human body inevitably results in principle in a strictly symmetrical style and technique of costume, and of armor especially: asymmetric armor nowhere exists.1 Normal harness of the primitive stages of culture is usually composed of an even number of pieces; and for this reason, the Chinese interpretation is improbable. Even granted that another point of view is possible in theory, ? that, for example, the harness of seven pieces may have had four in the back and three in front, or three in the back, two on the sides, and two in front, etc.,2?we still face the mystery of the threefold classification graduated according to age: what should be the reason that the cuirass of seven pieces is supposed to last a hundred years, that of six pieces two hundred years, and that of five pieces three hundred years? This is the salient point, to which no Chinese commentator has paid due attention; but it is obvious that this belief is associated with the two animals si and se furnishing the hide for the cuirasses, and that the supposed differentiation of the age of the two creatures is transferred to their products. Certain it is that the philological interpretation of the Chinese literati must be at fault. Their fundamental error lies in the misunderstanding of the word shu;3 and in 11 am, of course, aware of the fact that in European armor, which is more or less artificial, a studied asymmetry is sometimes displayed (see, for instance, Bashford Dean, Catalogue of European Arms and Armor, p. 64). The above re? mark refers only to the spontaneous productions of primitive cultures. 2 Such an arrangement, moreover, I must confess, would appear to me as too sophisticated, and technically too complex for such a simple and primitive age as that of the Chou. In order to grasp the character of its culture-objects, we should collect experience from the life of primitive peoples as we actually observe it (com? pare Plate XI). 3 The text unfortunately is yery succinct, and merely contains the terms tsH shu, leu shu, and wu shu. The Chinese commentators, accordingly, take the word shu (No. 10,061) in the sense of "hide pieces laid out side by side and then joined to? gether," but this is a point which I venture to contest. In my opinion, the question can be satisfactorily decided, not only from a technological, but from a philological point of view as well, if we interpret the word shu in the sense of "strata, or layers of hide pressed together." The word shu is capable of assuming many significations; its original meaning is, "to adhere, to place one thing on another, to tie together,</page><page sequence="109">Defensive Armor oe the Archaic Period 179 the venture of dragging in the terms cha (No. 127) and ye ("leaf"), which are peculiar to the Han period, but which did not exist with this meaning and with reference to armor in the age of the Chou. These two terms refer to laminae or plates of hide or metal reinforcing armor (see pp. 196, 210), and it will be seen that this type of armor springs up only from under the Han. It certainly had not come into existence under the Chou, as proved by the description of the armor given above after the Chou li, in which those terms are absent. Again, it is an ab? surdity to speak of an armor consisting of seven, six, or five laminae or plates, as these are of small dimensions, and a very large number of them is required to make a suit of armor.1 The verdict of the Chinese scholars must therefore be repealed. It is solely to the very text of the Chou li, which is sound and sane, that we must appeal for a correct understanding of the structure of this cuirass. We can understand, in my estimation, only that the suits were com? posed of seven, six, and five superposed layers or thicknesses of hide, respectively, as in fact hide armor has been produced. Then the whole passage becomes intelligible. There is a sensible gradation of three coats, regulated according to the quality believed to inhere in the hide. That of the two-horned rhinoceros ranks lowest in strength, therefore requiring seven layers,2 and lasts only a hundred years. That of the single-horned rhinoceros, which is the stronger animal, is superior, therefore requiring only six layers, and yet it will last two hundred years. That of both kinds combined is the best and strongest of all, therefore demanding only five layers, and will last three hundred years (see also p. 172). The hide, accordingly, was cut up in horizontal sec to unite, combine, to assemble," whence the significance "layer, stratum " is doubtless derived; whereas there is no evidence that it was ever understood in the sense of "piece." Couvreur explains it as a numerative of the pieces of an armor, and cites from TsHen Han shu, "an armor composed of three pieces" (san shu chi kia). It is inconceivable that such a device ever existed. It certainly was a hide armor consisting of three layers of skin. A. Conrady (Eine indochinesische Causativ Denominativ-Bildung, p. 165) has succeeded well in tracing the etymology of the word shu. The ancient pronunciation, according to him, was Zuk (Japanese Suk); the primeval form to be supposed is grog, identical with the Tibetan root grog in s-grog-pa ("to tie"), s-grog ("rope, strap"), and grogs ("fellow, friend"). This derivation also sheds light on the Chinese word shu assuming the significance "strip or layer of hide or leather." 1 It is therefore an anachronism when the passage in the text of the Chou li (Giles, No. 4437) is translated, "In coats of mail, it is desirable for the plates to fit evenly." Anything like plates is then out of the question. What is meant in this passage is (and it is so understood by the Chinese commentators) that the hide used in the cuirasses should not wrinkle. Biot very aptly translates, "On la rev&amp;t, et on demande qu'il n'y ait pas d'in6galit6s dans les coutures (qu'elles ne grimacent pas)." 2 A cuirass of seven thicknesses is mentioned in the biography of I SMn (T'ang shu, Ch. 170, p. 2).</page><page sequence="110">i8o Chinese Clay Figures tions into large and thin sheets, such as could be weighed and divided into equal parts. It would be unreasonable to infer that a rhinoceros skin in its natural state of thickness could be properly cured, and then utilized for the making of an armor: the skin was split into strata evenly thick, which were cured, probably boiled, and according to the number required were tightly pressed together. The fact that the harness was not composed of seven, six, and five pieces becomes sufficiently evident also from the rule that the long hide strips were laid around the trunk horizontally;1 naturally, for this was the most rational and efficient use that could have been made of them. In all probability, the entire affair consisted of only two main parts,? the corselet enveloping the trunk, and the skirt protecting the thighs,?both being closely joined together. Either part could have been made from a single piece of hide. The sewing, of course, refers to the various layers of hide and the seams. How the garment was put on is not indicated in the text; but it seems plausible to infer that it was open in the middle of the front. By a very similar process, cuirasses were still turned out in northern China and Mongolia in recent times. The American Consul Bedloe 2 reported on this subject as follows: "The original armor of the north (Manchuria and Mongolia) seems to have been leather, and in shape was more like a blouse than a jerkin. In the course of years the skin was doubled, trebled, and quadrupled, and a Chinese lower garment that might be called leather greaves and cuirasses combined was added to the upper one. The Mongolian nomads learned at an early age that a coat or cuirass made of sheepskin in several thicknesses makes a very warm garment and would turn a spear, arrow, or sword. Apparel of this class is in use to-day and may be bought very cheaply in Shan? tung." In the same manner the cuirasses of the Mongols invading Europe were wrought. Thomas of Spalato, an historian of the thir? teenth century, describes their defensive armor as made of ox-hide, several layers of it being so tightly pressed together that the armor is quite impermeable, and affords considerable protection.3 This is confirmed by Marco Polo,4 who relates that the Mongols wear on their backs armor of cuirbouly, prepared from buffalo and other hides, which 1 Biot translates with perfect correctness, "On prend leur longueur totale pour faire le contour de la cuirasse." 2 Consular Reports on Commerce, Manufactures, etc., No. 147, p. 494 (Washing? ton, 1892). 3 G.

Meng tse4 speaks of the strong armor and the sharp weapons of Ts'in and Ch*u. Si?n King, a philosopher of the third century b.c., ascribes armor of sharkskin and rhinoceros-hide to the people of Ch'u; both were hard like metal and stone.5 This is the more remarkable, as the author goes on to say that the people of Ch*u possessed the iron and steel of Y?an, a place corresponding to the modern Nan-yang in Ho-nan Prov? ince, and that their lance and arrow heads, apparently of iron or steel, were sharp like the stings of wasps and scorpions. We may therefore infer that the people of Ch'u, despite their acquaintance with iron, had not yet advanced to the stage of iron armor. Their hide armor must have been light in weight; for they are reported to be "light and agile, fiery and swift, and rapid like a hurricane." In general, however, or in other states, these cuirasses seem to have been heavy and uncomfortable; for we hear that they were donned only during battle, but rolled up and carried by the soldiers during the march.6 They did not allow the wearer to run; and when driven to flight, the soldiers threw them off, trailing their arms behind.7 From a text in Tso chuan8 it appears that rhinoceros cuirasses were 1 Buffalo-hide came up as a substitute for rhinoceros-hide in the making of armor during the T'ang period (p. 162). 2 A. Pfizmaier, Die Geschichte der Mongolen-Angriffe auf Japan (Sitzungs? berichte Wiener Akademie, 1874, P* l5*) 3 Legge, Chinese Classics, Vol. IV, p. 202. 4 Ibid., Vol. II, p. 135. 8 This passage is quoted also by Se-ma Ts*ien (Chavannes, Les Memoires histo riques de Se-ma Ts'ien, Vol. Ill, p. 217). The Wu pei chi, an extensive work on mili? tary science written under the Ming dynasty by Mao Yuan-i, and published in 1621, comments on this statement of Si?n ICing that sharkskin armor equals rhino? ceros-hide armor in hardness, and is therefore styled shui si ("water-rhinoceros"), because the shark is produced in the water. Another instance of sharkskin armor occurs in the TKung kien kang mu (quoted in T*u shu tsi ch*eng), where it is ascribed to the Mongols. Shagreen seems to have been utilized by the Chinese in olden times, especially in saddlery. The imperial'' caparisons made of shagreen " (Chavannes, I. c.f p. 214), I believe, are identical with the modern saddles mounted with shagreen. It is used also for mounting the sheaths and handles of knives and swords, even for the decoration of snuff-bottles. A detailed investigation of the subject is contained in H. L. Joly and I. Hogitaro (The Sword Book, pp. 3 et seq. of the appendix). 6 As attested by Sun-tse (see L. Giles, Sun Tz? on the Art of War, p. 58, London, 191 o). The case in which the rolled-up cuirass was enclosed was styled kao (No. 5949). 7 As is evident from a passage of M6ng-tse (Legge, Chinese Classics, Vol. II, p. 130). 8 Legge, Chinese Classics, Vol. V, p. 290.</page><page sequence="112">l82 Chinese Clay Figures also varnished with a red lacquer. They are frequently alluded to in that work,1 and were doubtless the usual means of body protection during the whole Ch'un-ts'iu period (b.c. 722-481). The states drew up schedules of their weapons and defensive armor. In one passage,2 a distinction is made between soldiers wearing armor lashed with cords (tsu kia, No. 11,828) and those who had donned an armor of silken fab? rics (pH lien, Nos. 8769, 7151). It is clear only that two kinds of armor are here discriminated, and that their diversity of technique and quality of material brought about a different effect: of the soldiers clad with the former armor, there were three hundred, of whom eighty es? caped; of soldiers with the latter armor, there was a force of three thou? sand, of whom only three hundred escaped. We do not exactly know, however, what these armors really were. Legge interprets tsu kia as " buff -coats lacquered as if made of strings" (then again translating "the men whose buff-coats looked as if made of strings"), and pxi lien as "whose coats were covered with silk." Neither is intelligible. S. Couvreur3 has proposed to explain the term tsu lien as "euirasse faite de cordons de soie, et tunique ouatee faite de grosse soie cuite," 4 and the term tsu kia as "euirasse faite de cordon de soie et enduite de vernis." These definitions are helpful, yet they leave us in the dark as to the contrast between the armor tsu and the armor lien. The latter, which proved so disastrous to their wearers, may have been made entirely from a coarse silken material; the former, however, as attested by the word kia, seem to have consisted essentially of hide, with the addition of silk cords (styled tsu), which I am inclined to think refer to the lashings of the hide armor. A special protective contrivance employed by the archers was an arm-guard, called han (No. 3799), a leather cuff wrapped around the left arm, the bow being supported against it.5 From the Han period these objects were made of iron. The utilization of rhinoceros-hide for armor persisted down to the T'ang period. Li Wang of the Han makes mention of this material (si se) for that purpose. A helmet of rhinoceros-hide is mentioned under the year 30 a.d. in the Tung kuan Han ki, completed about 170 a.d. In the biography of General Ma Lung,6 who died in 300 a.d.,7 we hear 1 Ibid., pp. 289, 397, 419? 517. 2 Duke Siang, third year (Legge, p. 419). 3 Dietionnaire chinois-franeais, pp. 494, 982. 4 In Li ki, garments of coarse boiled silk worn after the first year of mourning are mentioned. 6 Couvreur, Li ki, Vol. I, p. 621. 6 Inserted in the Annals of the Tsin Dynasty (Tsin shu, Ch. 57, p. 2 b). 7 Giles, Biographical Dictionary, p. 568.</page><page sequence="113">Defensive Armor of the Archaic Period 183 of a singular stratagem, in which iron mail (fie k%ai) versus rhinoceros hide cuirasses (si kid) was at stake. Ma Lung defeated a hostile army by covering the sides of a narrow pass with loadstone,1 so that the iron-clad enemies were unable to move, whereas his cuirassed men got the better of them. Whatever the basis of this anecdote may be, we recognize that hide armor still held its ground in the age of iron armor, and insured mobility of troops to such a degree that hide-clad soldiers could carry a victory over a heavy-mailed force struggling along under the burden of metal. In some other passages of Tsin shu and Sung shu we meet the term si pH k'ai ("rhinoceros-hide metal armor")? which must have been a suit with a hide foundation reinforced by metal laminae. We shall hear more of cuirasses in later periods, and likewise of metal armor. The hide armor of the Chou is irretrievably lost, and there is little or no chance that any will ever come to light. To a certain degree, hide armor, as still manufactured not so long ago by native tribes of America, may serve as an object-lesson and substitute, and assist us in reconstruct? ing in our minds the appearance of the ancient Chinese warriors. As the course of our investigation renders it necessary to touch also the subject of American defensive armor, these illustrations of American specimens not easily accessible will be welcome to many students. Plate XI illustrates an armor, in the form of a vest, made from extremely hard, heavy, tanned moose-skin of two thicknesses, the two layers being tightly pressed together. It is proof, against musket-balls fired at a reasonable distance. It opens in front, and is closed by means of three iron buckles of foreign make. The specimen comes from the Tlingit, Alaska.2 The armor figured in Plate XII is the work of Asiatic Eskimo from East Cape on the Chukotsk Peninsula. It is of particular interest in this connection as exhibiting the tendency toward making a cuirass of a single large piece of hide, as far as possible, thus avoiding the cutting of it. Extending in its total width to fully 1.55 m, two complete skins of seals are utilized in this specimen, the one forming the exterior, the other the interior, of the suit. They are sewed together along the edges 1 Regarding the loadstone in China see J. Klaproth (Lettre sur Finvention de la boussole, pp. 66 et seq., Paris, 1834), and F. de Mely (Les lapidaires chinois, p. 106). 2 Similar coats of hardened hide were turned out by the Haida, Chinuk, Hupa, Shoshoni, Navajo, Pawni, Mohawk, and others. There are in the Field Museum sev? eral other Tlingit cuirasses painted with the totemic emblems of the clans to which the chiefs wearing them belonged. The shields of the Plains Indians were made from buffalo-hide, with one or two covers of soft dressed buffalo, elk, or deer skin; the hide used for the purpose was taken from the neck of the buffalo bull, and was made exceptionally thick and tough by shrinking it, while wet, over a fire built in a hole in the ground (J. Mooney, in Handbook of American Indians, Vol. II, p. 547).</page><page sequence="114">184 Chinese Clay Figures with bands of seal-thongs, and enclose between them wooden slats. The central piece protecting the chest has incased in it a board of the same shape and size, while the gradually narrowing flaps have each four slats inserted to secure greater elasticity of movement. On Plate XIII is illustrated an armor of hard tanned caribou-skin, of especial interest to students of China because it is covered all over with Chinese coins. It is of the same type of cuirass as the one in Plate XI and comes from the Tlingit, Tarku Tribe, on theTarku River, Alaska. It was obtained by Lieutenant G. T. Emmons, who says that "the Chinese money was procured in trade from the early Russians, whose ships, exchanging the furs of the North Pacific with the Chinese for tea, plied constantly between the two countries, by which means many Chinese articles found their way to this coast." The coins (about a thousand in number) are arranged in regular vertical rows, and are fastened to the surface of the skin coat by means of leather strips, which pass through their square perforations. The coins are all care? fully selected, and only well preserved specimens have been used. The obverse, containing the Chinese legend, is usually on the outside; only in a few cases does the reverse with the Manchu legend stand out. The bulk of these coins date from the beginning of the Manchu dynasty, and are those inscribed with the periods Shun-chi (1644-1661), K'ang-hi (1662-1722), and Yung-ch&amp;ng (1723-1735). There are several coins of the period K'ien-lung (1736-1795) in this lot, but they form the minority, while the K'ang-hi coins outnumber all others. There is no coin later than the K'ien-lung period, so that it may well be supposed that this collection of coins was traded off in Alaska during or shortly after that period, say roughly at the end of the eighteenth century. We know, of course, that until a few years ago coins of the said description were still circulating in many parts of the interior of China, particularly in the country, though I understand that they have now been with? drawn from currency owing to the financial and monetary reform; it is not likely, however, that such a large number of those older coins would have arrived in Alaska in recent times without any additional modern coins. The conspicuous absence of any coins of the nineteenth century in a lot of a thousand speaks in favor of the assumption that they had been traded at the termination of the eighteenth century. A closer attempt at dating could be made, if it were possible to take off all the K'ien-lung coins, in order to read their reverses, which usually impart the place of the mint, and in some cases would allow of the establishment of a fixed year for the coinage. The last year thus determined would yield the terminus a quo; that is, the approximate date, after which this money may have left China en route to the north-east. It is not feasible</page><page sequence="115">Defensive Armor of the Archaic Period 185 to detach the coins from the armor, nor to lift them sufficiently to enable one to read the reverse, as they are fastened very tightly. Certainly, I do not mean to say that the armor itself originated at the end of the eighteenth century, though of course this might be possible; while it is conceivable also that the coins, on arrival in Alaska, were kept in a family; or bequeathed to some member of it, and were attached to the cuirass at a much later date.1 It is curious that in the Chou li no mention is made of helmets. A reference to them was presumably contained in the lost chapter Se kia, "the Superintendents of Armor," an office dealing with the business of defensive and offensive armor. In the Shi king, in one of the songs of the country of Lu, helmets adorned with shells (pei chou) axe mentioned. The shells, as is explained by the commentaries, were connected, and attached to the helmets by means of strings of vermilion color.2 The helmets were nothing but round leather caps, corresponding to the galea of the Romans. Armor and helmet were designed to create the impression of strength and bravery, and to inspire such fear that the enemy did not dare to attack the wearer.3 They were considered valuable objects and were presented as gifts.4 The regular force which a great state could at the utmost bring into the field consisted of a thousand chariots.6 Each chariot contained 1 F. Ratzel (?ber die St?bchenpanzer, Sitzungsberichte der bayerischen Akademie, 1886, p. 191), who mentions such coin armor among the Tlingit, derives it from the idea of armor-scales, and remarks that motives of protection and decoration here come into close contact with each other. The idea of a scale armor, however, is ex? cluded in such specimens as the one figured by Hough (Primitive American Armor, Plate XXI, Fig. 1) where the coins are strung loosely and at some distance from one another, so that protection from them, if any at all, could only amount to a minimum. Further, the conspicuous absence of scale armor on the entire continent of America conflicts with the view that the comparatively recent coin armor might be the imita? tion of scale armor. The coins have a merely ornamental purpose, and possibly also the function of amulets or magic protection; as such, these two ideas being com? bined, we find Chinese coins sewed on to every-day garments among the Gold and the Gilyak on the Amur; and as the common Chinese people are themselves in the habit of wearing old coins as charms, it seems very plausible that the example of the Chinese may have served as an incentive to the Amur tribes, and that Russian trad? ers, familiar with the customs of Siberian peoples, may have suggested the same prac? tice to the tribes of Alaska. 2 Legge, Chinese Classics, Vol. IV, p. 626. 3 Li ki, ed.

But the great antiquity which the war-chariot may claim in China prevents us from accepting the conclusion that it was plainly derived there from Babylonia in historical times. Like many other basic factors of ancient Chinese culture, it ranges in the class of those acquisitions which ancient China has in common with western Asia, and which go back to a re? mote prehistoric age. To these belong the mode of agriculture, the cultivation of</page><page sequence="116">Chinese Clay Figures three armored men,? the charioteer in the middle, with a spearman on his right, and an archer on his left. There were attached to it seventy two foot-soldiers and twenty-five other followers, one hundred men in all; so that the whole force would amount to a hundred thousand men. But in actual service, the force of a great state was restricted to three armies, or three hundred and seventy-five chariots, attended, inclusive of their armored occupants, by thirty-seven thousand five hundred men, of whom twenty-seven thousand five hundred were foot-soldiers.1 It seems that body armor was restricted to those fighting from the chariots. Another safeguard of the warriors was formed by shields decorated with figures of dragons, or perhaps adorned with feathers.2 The latter affair presents a point of controversy among the commentators: the one understanding that the feathers were fixed to the shield; the others, that they were painted on it. Legge adopts the latter view, and trans? lates, "the beautiful feather-figured shield." Also Couvreur is inclined to think that feathers of different kinds were represented on the shield. This opinion, however, is not very convincing. Whereas it is perfectly plausible that designs of dragons, or, as in recent times, of tigers were painted on the shields, and doubtless intended to guard the wearer and to terrify the enemy, it is difficult to see what reasons could induce man to decorate his shield with a pictorial pattern of feathers. We are all familiar with the shields of primitive man adorned with real feathers, particularly among the American Indians; and the primitive man of the Shi king period, in all likelihood, may have done the same.3 A document of the Han period brought to light by M. Chavannes (see p. 189), in which pigeon tail-feathers are mentioned in connection with a buckler, is very apt to corroborate this conclusion. The shield was combined with the spear,4 while later in the Han pe wheat and barley, tilling of the field by means of the plough drawn by an ox, methods of artificial irrigation, cattle-breeding, employment of cattle as draught-animals, the composite bow, the cart based on the principle of the wheel, and the potter's wheel. 1 Legge, Chinese Classics, Vol. IV, p. 626; Couvreur, Cheu King, p. 137. I have abandoned Legge's inexact word "mailed" and substituted "armored" for it; anything like "mail" was unknown in China during the archaic period (compare Chapter IV). 2 Legge, I. c, p. 194; Couvreur, I. c, pp. 135, 136. 3 The Tibetans had bucklers ornamented with feathers (see p. 256). An unsophisti? cated mind may certainly be entitled to raise the question how the Chinese com? mentators get at the "feathers" in the passage of the Shi king, as no direct word to this effect is employed. The word ming (No. 7763), into which this meaning is read, means "to cover, to envelop;" and the term mtngfa, after all, may simply mean "wooden shields covered with hide." In this sense, the term ming tun ("hide-covered buckler") is indeed utilized in later literature. 4 For instance, Biot, Chou Ii, Vol II, p. 223. In the inscriptions on ancient bronzes, as reproduced and explained in the Po ku t*u lu, the word sun ("grand</page><page sequence="117">Defensive Armor of the Archaic Period 187 riod it was handled together with the sword. The term kan ko (" shield and spear") in the Shi king1 is a collective notion comprising defensive and offensive armor, or war-implements. In the administration of the Chou dynasty, there was a special official presiding over the various kinds of spears and bucklers, and commissioned with their distribution.2 But no contemporaneous description of shields is handed down, from which an exact conception as to their material and form might be gained. The shields protecting the soldiers in the war-chariots were presum? ably roof-shaped, as we glean from a text in Tso chuan 3 when, in the battle of Ch'ui-pi, fought between the armies of the principalities of Lu and Ts'i, Tse-y?an Tsi of Ts'i pursued SMng-tse, and shot an arrow at him, hitting the ridge of his shield. In this passage the ridge is designated "roofing-tile" (wa), explained by the commentary as the ridge of the shield. This is also the earliest document in which the word shun (No. 10,154) appears as a designation for the shield, and, owing to its composition with the classifier 'wood/ leaves no doubt that the shields were wooden.4 It is worthy of note that during the early period, in the same manner as in armor, no metal was employed for the bucklers; and it is remarkable also that in all later periods of culture when the working of metals was in full swing, none were ever turned to that purpose; wood, rattan, and hide holding their place. The buckler, accordingly, never assumed a vast importance in Chinese warfare.5 A fundamental text relating to ancient shields, though dating from the time of the Later Han dynasty, is contained in the dictionary Shi ming by Liu Hi. He defines the word tun ("shield") as tung ("to son") is represented in writing by the rough figure of a youth holding spear and shield, and performing a war-dance. 1 Legge, Chinese Classics, Vol. IV, pp. 484, 578. Likewise in Li ki (ed. Cou? vreur, Vol. I, pp. 233, 468). 2 Biot, Chou li, Vol. II, p. 238; J. H. Plath, Das Kriegswesen der alten Chinesen (Sitzungsberichte der bayerischen Akademie, 1873, P* 33)* 3 Duke Chao, 26th year, b.c. 516 (compare Legge, Chinese Classics, Vol. V, p. 716). 4 Shi king, Chou li, and Shi ki use the word tun (No. 12,223), which is doubtless derived from the verb tun (No. 12,225), "to hide away, to conceal one's self." The word kan (No. 5814) appears twice in Shu king. The commentaries do not interpret the differences between the three words, but explain one by another. The shield, as elsewhere, was occasionally applied also as an offensive weapon. Thus, Fan K'uai, girt with a sword and bearing the buckler on his arm, penetrated into the camp of Hiang Y?, and used the buckler in pushing the guards down, who thus fell to the ground (Chavannes, Les M?moires historiques de Se-ma Ts'ien, Vol. II, p. 279). 5 Copper shields are mentioned by the Chinese, but refer to foreign tribes; for instance, in the Annals of the Yuan Dynasty under the year 1286, when they were sent from a foreign country called Ma-pa; they are ascribed also to the Shan of Yun? nan (see p. 193).</page><page sequence="118">i88 Chinese Clay Figures conceal one's self," No. 12,241), and as the object behind which a man hides himself in a kneeling position in order to evade an attack. Liu Hi enumerates two kinds of foreign shields adopted by the ancient Chinese, ? a large and flat one, which originally was indigenous to the country of Wu1 and peculiar to the generals there, hence styled Wu k'uei (No. 6499), "general of Wu;" and a high one, termed sii tun2 coming from the country of Shu (Sze-cfTuan), but termed by others "shield of the K'iang (Tibetans)" because they asserted that it origi? nated from the K'iang. Here we notice the ever-recurring Chinese tendency toward imitating and appropriating the armaments of the neighboring tribes. Liu Hi mentions also the long and narrow shields used by the infantry soldiers in combination with the sword,? styled "foot shields" (pu [No. 9485] tun)f and the short and narrow shields employed on the war-chariots,? styled "small shields" (kie [No. 1505]* tun). As to the materials chosen for their manufacture, he emphasizes boards and, what is of especial interest, rhinoceros-hide (si pH). The latter were termed "rhinoceros shields" (si tun); the former, "wooden shields" (mu tun). The specimen of a circular buck? ler of rhinoceros-hide, of Indian manufacture (secured by the writer in Tibet), is illustrated in Plate XXVII. Culture-objects when once acquired survive through the ages with persistent force, even after the introduction of innovations which seem to be apt to supersede entirely the old material. We have already referred to the fact that cuirasses have not yet wholly disappeared in modern China. Indeed, we meet them in all periods of Chinese history, despite new inventions of superior quality. From the wooden documents found in Turkistan, and recently deciphered with admirable ingenuity by E. Chavannes 5 it becomes apparent that hide corselets formed the defensive armor of the Chinese soldiers serving in eastern Turkistan during the Han period. The contemporaneous texts written out on wooden slips employ either the 1 No. 12,748. Wu is an ancient kingdom comprising the present province of Kiang-su, the southern part of An-hui, and the northern portions of CM-kiang and Kiang-si (see Chinese Pottery in the Philippines, p. 42, note 10). 2 S? (No. 4716) is explained as a war-implement in K'ang-hi's Dictionary, which quotes the passage in question. This interpretation is not quite satisfactory; for the word s? must have a more specific meaning, as shown by the parallelism of the preceding sentence and the following clause, in which it is said that these shields were handled by the S? of the country of Shu. The word, accordingly, parallel to the preceding generals of Wu, must refer to a military charge or rank in Shu; and it is doubtless derived from a language spoken in Shu, or from a language of the K'iang. 3 These were actually used in the Han period, as will be noticed in Chapter III. 4 The word is explained by him in the sense of "small." 5 Les documents chinois ddcouverts par Aurel Stein dans les sables du Turkestan oriental, p. xvi (Oxford, 1913).</page><page sequence="119">Defensive Armor of the Archaic Period 189 plain word kia (No. 187), or the compound ko kia (Nos. 393, 569), "hide armor;" and we hear also of an official having charge of armor (No. 758) .* Simultaneously, another word for body armor, k'ai, is twice used in these documents (Nos. 758, 794), and translated by M. Chavannes likewise " cuirasse." This seems to be correct only in so far as leather was applied also to this kind of armor, as expressly attested by document No. 794; but it will be seen in the following chapter that the new word k%ai, which springs up in the Han period, denotes a new type of armor presenting a combination of hide with metal, and that the rendering by "cuirass" is therefore inadequate. The defensive armor of the Han soldiers was completed by a helmet (No. 794) and a buckler {tun), the latter being described as red in the wooden documents (Nos. 75, 77), from which it may be inferred that they were made of wood covered with a red varnish 2 protecting the wood from moisture, red being believed to terrify the enemy; it was the main function of the buckler to ward off the shots of arrows (No. 682). In one case a buckler is especially mentioned as having been made in b.c. 63 by the official Armory of Nan-yang in Ho-nan Province (No. 39); in another case a buckler is on record as having been worked in b.c. 61 by the ar? tisans of the administration (No. 40). Bucklers were decorated with pigeon tail-feathers attached to them (No. 75).3 Despite the fact that metal armor, as will be seen in the next chapter, gradually made its way during the period of the two Han dynasties, and was firmly established in the age of the T'ang, mention is still made in the Statutes of the T'ang Dynasty 4 of hide cuirasses (p%i kia); rhino 1 In Ch. 49 of Hou Han shu the story is told of how in 75 a.d. General K&amp;ig Kung and his troops, being at war with Kucha, were at the point of starvation, and cooked cuirasses and crossbows so as to feed on the leather and sinews contained in them (Chavannes, T'oung Pao, 1907, p. 228), ? a case sufficiently convincing as to the material of which they were made. 2 In the same manner as the cuirasses (p. 182). 3 M. Chavannes (I. c, p. 30) thinks that the expression "pigeon-tail" must be a technical term which designates perhaps the leather or hemp handle of the buckler. There is in my opinion no necessity for such a conjecture. " Pigeon-tail," I venture to suggest, is to be understood literally, inasmuch as the buckler, as perhaps in the period of the Shi king, was adorned along its edges with feathers; in the document in question the report is made that the soldier so and so has received "a red buckler, the pigeon tail-feathers of which had rotted away." ^ The " rotting-away" sounds plausible with regard to the latter, but much less so if a leather or hemp strap were intended. As to offensive armor, M. Chavannes correctly emphasizes the fact that the Chinese soldiers of the Han time availed themselves of crossbows, not of bows; this is con? firmed by his documents as well as by the Han sculptures, on which men are usually represented as shooting with crossbows, not, as has been said by some observers, with bows. As to swords, it seems preferable to study them from actual specimens of cast bronze and iron, such as are in our collections, instead of from the bas-reliefs, as M. Chavannes recommends us to do (compare Plates XX and XXI). 4 Pxei win yiin fu (Ch. 106, p. 73), and Ko chi king yiian (Ch. 41, p. 3). The Txang leu tien ("Six Statutes of the T'ang Dynasty") gives a description of the</page><page sequence="120">190 Chinese Clay Figures ceros-hide (si se) being employed for them, and sometimes being sup? planted by buffalo-hide. In the History of the Liao Dynasty 1 rhinoceros-hide armor is still recorded for the year 952 as a tribute of the Nan T'ang dynasty to the Court of the Liao. The captains in the army of the kingdom of Nan chao are reported to have used cuirasses made from rhinoceros-hide.2 During the middle ages, when the rhinoceros grew scarcer, other hides began to take its place. It has been demonstrated above (p. 162) that under the Tlang the district of Kuang-ling sent to the Court tribute of buffalo-hide armor.3 Marco Polo 4 says regarding the Mongols that on their backs they wear armor of cuirbouly (boiled leather), prepared from buffalo and other hides, which is very strong; and all contemporary western writers speak of the leather armor used by the Mongols.5 This fact is confirmed by the Annals of the Y?an Dynasty.6 The type of cuirass styled "hoop armor" has possibly at one time existed in China, though there is no description of it. At the Court of the emperors of the Kin dynasty (1115-1234) in Peking, the guards were all clad with armor. On the left were stationed those with a banded cuirass colored blue (tsHng Vao kid), holding in their hands a flag on which was represented a yellow dragon. On the right were . stationed those with a banded cuirass colored red (hung fao kid), holding a flag with a red dragon represented on it.7 The word kia used in this connection indicates that it is the question of hide cuirass; and the word Vao ("band") defines the peculiar character of this armor in that it was banded or hooped, the bands being cut out of leather, perhaps in a administrative organization of the period E?ai-yuan (713-741) of the T'ang dynasty, the authorship being ascribed to the Emperor Y?an-tsung (713-755), and Li Lin-fu and others contributing to the interpretation of the work (Wylie, Notes on Chinese Literature, p. 67; Pelliot, Bulletin de VEcole frang?ise d'Extrime-Orient, Vol. Ill, 1903, p. 668). 1 Liao shi, Ch. 6, p. 1. 2 C.

It is quoted, though incompletely, in PKei win yiinfu (Ch. 106, p. 74). Chavannes' translation "cuirasses avec des cordons bleus" certainly is all right, as far as the translation is concerned; but I am inclined to think that this term is capable of the interpretation as given above. The word Vao ("band") is in Giles, No. 10,817.</page><page sequence="121">Defensive Armor of the Archaic Period 191 manner similar to that of the corresponding Chukchi armor figured and described by Walter Hough1 and W. Bogoras. 2 Another singular kind of armor is alluded to in the Lan p'ei lu 3 under the name jung kia. The word jung (No. 5736) refers to the soft core of the young antlers of the deer (considered by the Chinese an efficient aphrodisiac); and I am inclined to interpret the term jung kia as a cuirass strengthened by horn shavings fastened to the surface, for which there are interesting analogies in other culture areas.4 In the passage 1 Primitive American Armor (Report of the U. S. National Museum for 1803, Plate IV and p. 634). An excellent specimen of this type is in the Field Museum (Cat. No. 34&gt;i5i). 2 Publications du Musee ?"Ethnographie et dJAnthropologie de St. Petersbourg, II, Plate XII, Fig. 1 (St. Petersburg, 1901). The Chukchi hoop armor, however, is not related to the so-called banded mail of the European middle ages, as asserted by Hough (/. c, p. 633) and repeated by Bogoras (The Chukchee, Jesup North Pacific Expedition, Vol. VII, p. 162). In the European types it has been shown that the banded appearance, as it occurs in mediaeval illustrations, was produced by thongs of leather which were strung through adjacent rows of chain-links (Bashford Dean, Catalogue of European Arms and Armor, p. 22, New York, 1905),? a feature entirely lacking in the Chukchi armor. 3 Quoted in P'ei win yiin fu, Ch. 106, p. 74. This is a brief work containing likewise the narrative of a mission to the Court of the Kin emperors in 1170 by Fan Ch^ng-ta (1126-1193), and reprinted in Chi pu tsu chai ts'ung shu. In the text of this work it is added that the guards had spears with handles inlaid with gold leaf, and flags painted with blue dragons; those in the east had yellow flags, and those in the west white ones. 4 Ammianus Marcellinus (xvii, 12) narrates that the armor of the Quadians and Sarmatians consisted of small scales of polished horn arranged on a linen coat like the plumage of a bird (loricae ex cornibus rasis et levigatis, plumarum specie linteis indumentis innexae); and Pausanias (1, 21, 5) relates that a Sarmatian scale armor made of horses' hoofs was preserved as a curiosity in the Temple of Aesculapius at Athens. Ratzel (?ber die St?bchenpanzer und ihre Verbreitung im nordpazifi? schen Gebiet, Sitzungsberichte der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1886, p. 191) mentions, after a letter received from William H. Dall, an armor made by the Tlingit from slices of deer-hoof fastened to a foundation of elk-skin in the manner of scale armor. In the Philippine collection of the Field Museum (Cat. No. 34,493, gift of Mr. E. E. Ayer), there is a suit of armor composed of rectangular laminae of buffalo (carabao) horn, mutually connected by means of rows of brass rings. This armor was made by the Moro on Basilan Island. It is identical with the specimen figured by L. Scherman (Berichte des K. Ethnographischen Museums in M?nchen IV, 1911, M?nchner Jahrbuch der bildenden Kunst, 1912, p. 96, Fig. 18), which is stated to hail from the Sulu Archipelago, and to be characteristic of this region. In the Field Museum, however, there is also a suit of armor of exactly the same type, in which the laminae are entirely wrought from brass, and likewise joined by means of brass rings. This metal suit, according to the traditions of the natives, was captured in 1631 when a Spanish expedition was massacred at Lake Lanao; they assure us also that the suits of carabao horn were turned out in imitation of this Spanish model. It is therefore obvious that the metal harness in question, as moreover attested by the evidence of the object itself, is of Spanish make, and served as model for the Philippine as well as the Sulu horn armors. Suits of armor have always been highly prized articles and carried away to remote corners by barter or capture in war; and it is always necessary to be on one's guard in making correct attributions. We may even go so far as to say that it would be impossible for the natives of the Philippines to construct such a complicated affair from their own inventiveness. Their purely native armor is unpretentious, being made from woven hemp stuffed with matted hemp fibre. This is the national North-Malayan type of body armor, the same as</page><page sequence="122">192 Chinese Clay Figures referred to it is said that in the east and west galleries of the imperial palace the guards were clothed with armor, and that those posted east wore armor of horn dyed red (hung jung kid), those posted west wore armor of horn dyed green and blue (pi [No. 9009] jung kid). It thus seems that the Kin or Ni?chi had a predilection for curious armor. Reference to the cuirass of the Mongols has already been made above (pp. 180, 190). "They ride long like Frenchmen, and wear armor of boiled leather, and shields and arblasts, and all their quarrels are poisoned,"?thus Marco Polo 1 describes the equipment of the inhabitants of the kingdom of Nan-chao in Y?n-nan called by him Carajan. Yule is inclined to prefer the reading "cuir de bufal" offered by another text, as some of the Miao-tse of Kuei-chou are described as wearing armor of buffalo leather2 overlaid with iron plates. Hide was indeed the chief material utilized for body armor by the aboriginal tribes inhabiting southern China. In this respect we are well informed by several reliable and observant authors of the Sung period. The famous Fan Ch'dng-ta (1126-1193),3 official, poet, florist, traveller, and ethnographer, has the following description in his valuable account of the regions of southern China,4 "As regards the armor of the Man tribes, harness and helmets are wrought to a large extent only in the kingdom of Ta-li.5 Elephant-skin is used for this purpose in such we find on Formosa. The aborigines of Formosa, at the time when the Chinese made their first acquaintance in the beginning of the seventh century, were in a transitional stage of life, iron being only sparsely used, while bone and horn took its place; and a hoe with stone blade was employed in tilling the fields. The interesting account given in the Annals of the Sui Dynasty (Sui shu, Ch. 81, p. 5) ascribes to them knives, spears, bows and arrows, swords and daggers; and adds that owing to the scarcity of iron in the country the blades are thin and small, being replaced to a great extent by bone and horn, and that "of plaited hemp they make armor, or avail themselves of bear and leopard skins." 1 Ed. of Yule and Cordier, Vol. II, p. 78. 2 According to the Nan-chao ye shi, as previously shown, it was rhinoceros-hide; while the text of Fan Ch'&amp;ng-ta which follows above speaks of elephant-skin. In all likelihood these three materials, buffalo, rhinoceros, and elephant, were used side by side. 3 Giles, Biographical Dictionary, p. 242. 4 The general title of the work is Kui hai yil hing chi (Wylie, Notes on Chinese Literature, p. 56; Bretschneider, Botanicon Sinicum, pt. 1, p. 165). The single chapters have separate headings; the one from which the above extract is given is entitled Kui hai k*i chi ("Records of Implements in Southern China"). My quota? tion refers to the reprint of the text in Txang Sung ts%ung shu. 5 Name of the country and the capital of the Shan in the present province of Y?n-nan, who ruled as the Nan-chao dynasty, and whose kingdom was destroyed by the Mongols in 1252. It still was independent at the time to which our above account refers. The fact that the armor of the Man is traced to the kingdom of Ta-li, then inhabited by the T*ai or Shany is of some significance. The T*ai were a warlike and chivalrous nation like the Tibetans, and had developed a highly advanced culture</page><page sequence="123">Defensive Armor of the Archaic Period 193 a manner that one large piece covers the breast and another the back, looking like the carapace of a turtle, and being as solid and massive as iron.1 Then small strips of leather are so combined as to form brassards and nape-guards, made like the iron armor-plates of the Chinese,2 and all colored vermilion. Helmet and harness, both on the interior and exterior side, are all colored vermilion. By means of yellow and black mineral dye-stuffs they paint designs of flowers, small and large animals, such as are now found on girdle-buckles,3 ? of admirable workmanship. They string also small white shells 4 in connected rows, sew them on to the harness, and decorate the helmets with them. Presumably they are survivals of those ancient helmets adorned with shells on vermilion strings mentioned in the Shi king.115 betraying, in opposition to the Chinese, a keynote of striking individualism. Every adult was a soldier; and it is a surprising fact that there was compulsory military service in the kingdom of Nan-chao, and that the army was highly organized. The History of Nan-chao compiled in 1550 by Yang Shen (1488-1559) narrates that the army captains used to wear cuisses, red helmets, and cuirasses of rhinoceros-hide, and carried bucklers of copper; but they marched bare-footed (C. Sainson, Histoire particuliere du Nan-Tchao, p. 19, Paris, 1904). As to its historical relations, the pro? tective armor of the Man must therefore be connected with that of the Shan; and the Man apparently derived it from the superior culture of their neighbors. 1 Vir?dhaka, one of the four guardians of the world (lokap?la) in Hindu mythol? ogy, wears a helmet from the skin of an elephant's head (Gr?nwedel, Buddhist Art in India, p. 138, and Mythologie des Buddhismus, p. 181). ^ An armor of elephant skin overlaid with gold in the possession of a Mongol prince in 1573 is mentioned by Sanang Setsen (I. J. Schmidt, Geschichte der Ost-Mongolen, p. 217). The Jesuit Francisco Combes, in his Historia de Mindanao of 1667 (Blair and Robertson, The Philippine Islands, Vol. XL, p. 179), reports that the Joloans on Mindanao in the Philippines are armed from top to toe with helmet, bracelets, coat-of-mail, greaves, with linings of elephant-hide armor so proof that nothing can make a dint on it except fire-arms, for the best sword or cutlass is turned. As the elephant does not occur in the Philippines (its presence on Borneo is presumably due to human agency), these armors, in all likelihood, must have been importations from the Asiatic mainland. 2 See Chapter V. 3 The word employed here is si-pi (No. 9050), which in this mode of writing, for the first time, appears in Se-ma Ts'ien's Shi ki (Ch. 110, p. 6 b) in the sense of a buckle to fasten a girdle. E. H. Parker (China Review^ Vol. XX, p. 15), in his translation of this passage, explains si-pi as a word of the Sien-pi language. See now R. and H. Torii, Etudes archeologiques (Journal of the College of Science, Vol. 36, T?ky?, 1914, p. 82, and Plate XII). The same word is used again by our author in the description of the swords made in Ta-li; the sheaths are colored vermilion, and painted in their upper part with a design like those occurring on buckles (si pi hua win). Similarly it is employed in the Ling-wai tai ta (published by Chou K'u-fei in 1178) in the description of the saddles of the Man (Ch. 6, p. 5), which are varnished red and black like the designs on buckles (ju si pi win). This term is not registered in the Pxei win yiin fu. 4 The Ling-wai tai ta (Ch. 7, p. 9), composed by Chou K??-fei in 1178, informs us that the shells utilized in the kingdom of Ta-li for the decoration of armor and helmets came from the island of Hainan; they are called "large shells" (ta pei), in the works on natural history "purple shells" (ts*e pei). They are described as being round on the back, with purple flecks, and with deep cracks on the surface. 6 See above, p. 185. Such combinations are suggested to the learned Chinese authors by their literary education, but certainly are no evidence for the shell decora? tions of the Man being really due to a stimulus received from ancient China. The</page><page sequence="124">194 Chinese Clay Figures As to the Li, the inhabitants of the island of Hainan, the same author states that they make helmets of plaited rattan. A cuirass of the Lolo is figured and described by F. Starr. 1 It is composed of heavy, moulded plates of thick leather, varnished black and decorated in red and yellow, the shoulders being protected by two projecting wings. From this plastron is suspended an apron of seven horizontal rows of scales, each row overlapping the one above it, and the scales in each row overlapping. The mode of wear of this armor may be seen in the portrait of the Lolo chief Ma-tu figured by Ch. Francois, 2 who states that these cuirasses are made of buffalo-skin painted with various colors, somewhat similar in shape to the ancient Japanese armor.3 Two specimens of Lolo armor are described by Herbert Mueller,4 which are of the same type as the one figured by Starr, only that those have the central breastplate, which is apparently lost in the latter speci? men. Neither Starr nor Mueller has recognized what type of armor is here represented. It is not armor of a uniform structure, but one in which two principles are combined, that .of sheets, and that of plates or laminae. The sheets form the body armor proper, ten in number, employment of shells for decorative purposes, on the contrary, is a general charac? teristic of all cultures in south-eastern Asia and Tibet, where they are employed in a manner foreign to the Chinese. The Tibetan women use large shells as bracelets, and wear girdles, to which rows of shells are attached. It is surprising to find these in the high mountainous regions of Sze-ch'uan (for instance, in Romi-Drango), in isolated spots remote from the sea, whither these shells must have been brought from India via Tibet, or from Burma by way of Y?n-nan. The women of the P'u j&amp;n, a tribe of the T'ai or Shan stock formerly inhabiting Y?n-nan, used to wear a short skirt, to which ten rows of marine shells were fastened all round (C. Sainson, Histoire particuliere du Nan-Tchao, p. 164). The women of the White Kuo-lo or Lo-lo covered their heads with black cloth adorned with shells (ibid., p. 167); compare also pp. 170, 175, 179, 185, in regard to other tribes who observed the same practice. An interesting study of the Indian shell industry was recently published by J. Hornell (The Chank Bangle Industry, Memoirs As. Soc. Bengal, Vol. Ill, pp. 407 448, Calcutta, 1913). 1 Lolo Objects in the Public Museum, Milwaukee (Bulletin of the Public Museum of the City of Milwaukee, Vol. I, 1911, p. 216 and Plate III, 8). 2 Notes sur les Lo-lo du Kien-tchang (Bulletin de la SocietS d'Anthropologie, 1904, p. 640). 3 The correctness of this comparison seems to me doubtful. Playfair (China Review, Vol. V, p. 93) has drawn from a modern Chinese source the following notes on armor among the Kiu-ku Miao: "The crown of the head is protected by an iron helmet which leaves the back of the head exposed. On the shoulders they wear two pieces of hammered iron armor, of considerable weight, which act as a face-guard. Their body armor covers the whole of the back and the chest. In addition they wear iron chain mail covering the entire body and weighing about thirty catties; they have the appearance of being enclosed in a cage. Their legs are cased in iron greaves of great strength. They carry in their left hand a wooden shield, in their right a sharp-edged spear." Chain mail is discussed in Chapter IV. 4 Baessler-Archiv, Vol. Ill, 1912, p. 59 and Plate III.</page><page sequence="125">Defensive Armor of the Archaic Period 195 a breast and a back sheet,1 and eight below these for the protection of the abdomen and loins. Combined with this leather sheet armor are tasses consisting of six or seven horizontal rows, each composed of small rectangular leather laminae, arranged in vertical position. The leather sheets and plates are varnished red on the outside2 and yellow on the lower side. Mr. Mueller remarks that parallels to this armor are hardly known, but that, as far as can be judged from the pictures preserved, a certain relationship, however distant, with ancient Chinese armor seems to exist. Unfortunately he does not state to what kind of pictures he refers, nor in what the supposed resemblance should con? sist. There is hardly any solid foundation for this opinion. This type of armor, on the contrary, although it agrees in some features with one represented on certain Chinese clay figures of the T'ang period (Plate XXXI), does not meet with any exact counterpart among Chinese specimens known to us; nor is such a connection at the outset very probable, since the affinities of Man armor, as has been pointed out, go with that of the Shan, and are accordingly focussed on another culture-zone. Besides the word kia, another word for armor occurs in the Shi king, and this is the word kiai (No. 1518). It is once used with reference to great armor donned by a king;3 and on another occasion it refers to a team of four horses in a war-chariot, clad with armor.4 Legge, following the Chinese comment, is of the opinion that the meaning of kiai is identical with that of kia; but they are two different words written with two different symbols, and it is therefore justifiable-to presume that they denote two different types of armor. As the word kiai is used to designate the scales of fishes, turtles, lobsters, and other aquatic scaly animals, it is most likely that it was this notion of the word transferred to a type of body armor, and that it related to scale armor (lorica squamata), the scales being cut out of hide or leather.5 There 1 Plastron and dossiexe. 2 In accordance with the ancient Chinese cuirasses, as mentioned in Tso chuan (see above, p. 181). 3 Legge, Chinese Classics, Vol. IV, p. 606. 4 Ibid., p. 131. 6 Legge (L c, p. 194) states that the armor (not mail) for the horses was made of thin plates of metal, scale-like. It is most improbable that the scales were of metal at the time of the Shi king. See Chapter VII. The same semasiological develop? ment as in Chinese kiai is illustrated in the Tibetan word k'rab and the Burmese word k'yap, that in the first instance denote scale (scale, of a fish), and secondly a body armor, which is now the usual meaning; and it is further interesting that Tibetan k'rab has also the meaning of "shield, buckler" (see J?schke, Tibetan-English Die</page><page sequence="126">196 Chinese Clay Figures is unfortunately no description of this armor in any ancient text. In the Li ki the word occurs several times, the rules of politeness excusing the warrior clad with akiai from making a bow;1 but nothing is brought forward to add to the knowledge of the subject.2 I have never seen in China any suit of armor made of scales of leather; and they are not like? ly to have been made at later ages when metal was available. In Japan, such specimens have fortunately survived; and the one figured by Bashford Dean 3 may give us an excellent idea of the appearance of the ancient Chinese scaly leather coats. It is attributed to the Fuji wara period (around 1000 a.D.), and described as a primitive type of Japanese harness, the single laminae being of boiled leather, cut and beaten into pieces shaped like fish-scales. A suit of copper scale armor obtained in Sze-ch'uan (Plate XIV) may be regarded as the natural continuation of the ancient leather armor of the same type. The scales are fastened by means of brass wire to a foundation of sack? cloth, and overlap one another. This specimen, weighing 38^4 pounds, as evidenced by the effects of many blows and bullet-holes visible in the metal, has actually been employed in warfare.4 Scale armor is distinctly mentioned in the Wan hua ku, a work written at the end of the twelfth century; but this passage is taken from the T'ang leu tien, and therefore refers to the T'ang dynasty.5 The tionary, p. 49). In all probability, the Chinese and Tibetan words kiai (or kai) and k*rab are anciently related, in the same way as Tib. k*rag ("blood") and Chinese hiuet, Tibetan skrag-pa ("to be afraid of") and Chinese ki? (W. Grube, Die sprach? geschichtliche Stellung des Chinesischen, p. 16), Tib. sgrog-pa ("to tie") and Chin. kiao (Conrady, Eine indochinesische Causativ-Denominativ-Bildung, p. vu). Also the Chinese word kia, "armor" (ancient pronunciation kiap, rhyme hiap), may be allied to Tibetan k'rab. It will be seen below (Chapter IV) that scale armor repre? sents the earliest type of armor in Tibet, Persia, and India. 1 Couvreur, Li ki, Vol. I, p. 65; Vol. II, p. 13. 2 The scales of hide armor were called kia cha (No. 127). This may be inferred from a passage in the Chan kuo ts*e (quoted in P'ei win y?nfu, Ch. 97, p. 5 b), where Su Tai (third and fourth century b.c.; Giles, Biographical Dictionary, p. 682) addresses Yen Wang, and says, "You cut the scales of the buff-coat yourself, and your wife fastens them together by means of cords." The word siao (No. 4309), which is here utilized and means "to scrape, pare, trim," indicates that leather is in question, and that the leather strips were trimmed into a certain shape called cha. Regarding the technical meaning of this word see p. 210, note 3. 3 Catalogue of the Loan Collection of Japanese Armor, p. 39 (The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Hand-Book No. 14, New York, 1903). 4 Consul Bedloe (Consular Reports on Commerce, Manufactures, etc., No. 147, p. 494, Washington, 1892) states, "Scale mail, at an early period, was carried to a high perfection. The scales were applied to cloth or leather at first, as spangles are to gauze, and later as tiles or slates are to the boards of a roof. They were composed of iron, pewter, silver, gold, or of various oriental alloys. In making a suit, scales of one kind were usually employed, but combinations were frequent, in which metals of contrasting colors were used. A good suit of armor can be bought at prices rang? ing from $10 to $150." 6 Bretschneider, Botanicon Sinicum, pt. 1, p. 160, No. 330. The above text will be found in the Chapter on Armor (kia chou pu) in Txu shu tsi ch'ing. Ko chi</page><page sequence="127">Defensive Armor of the Archaic Period 197 third kind of armor known at that time is termed in that book si lin kia ("armor of thin scales"), and is classified among iron armor. The very name implies that it is a question of scale armor. The fourth variety of armor is styled shan win kia ("armor with a mountain pattern"); a zigzag design or a continuous row of triangles being under? stood by the latter name. Also this, likewise made of iron, was perhaps scale armor;1 as presumably also the fifth, designated "black hammer armor" (wu chui kia), likewise of iron. No descriptions of these pieces are furnished in the book mentioned. Leather scale armor was still used by the Mongols, as attested by Friar William of Rubruck (i 2*53), who states," I saw two who had come to present themselves before Mangu, armed with jackets of convex pieces of hard leather, which were most unfit and unwieldy." 2 In the Ming period the technical term for armor-scales is "wil? low-leaf" (liu ye). We read in the Statutes of the Ming Dynasty (Ta Ming hui tien) that in 1393 six thousand sets of "willow-leaf armor" and helmets of chain mail were ordered for the soldiers of the body? guard serving in the Imperial City. The great antiquity of hide scale armor is an important fact to us, as there are certain ancient clay figures on which this type of armor is represented. These belong to the earliest that we have, and range in the archaic period;3 and it will be seen from the notes devoted to their dis king yuan (Ch. 41, p. 3) and Pxei win y?nfu (Ch. 106, p. 73) give exactly the same quotation extracted from the T'ang leu lien (the " Six Statutes of the T'ang Dynasty "), drawn up by the Emperor Y?an-tsung in the early part of the eighth century (Wy lie, Notes on Chinese Literature, p. 67; and above, p. 189). The only additional matter prefixed to the latter text is that the thirteen kinds of armor enumerated were ordered to be made by the Imperial Armory (wu k*u). 1 P'ei win y?nfu (Ch. 106, p. 74) quotes the T'ang shi lu to the effect that the armors called shan win kia were made by the Emperor T'ai-tsung from iron (black metal) dyed in five colors, so that the "mountain pattern" may have been brought out by the color-work. Five-colored armor (wu ts'ai kia) is mentioned in T'ang shu (Ch. Ii yo chi, ibid., p. 73). The Pek-tsi, a Korean tribe, brought "varnished armor of metal" (kin hiu k'ai) to the Chinese General Li Tsi (Giles, Biographical Dic? tionary, p. 421), who subjugated Korea between 644 and 658; on these armors, which were used by the Chinese cavalry, five mountain patterns (shan ngu win) were repre? sented by means of iron, which may be understood in the sense that five iron scales were arranged in such a manner as to suggest the design of a mountain. This passage is contained likewise in T'ang shu (Ch. 220, p. 3 b). 2 W. W. Rockhill, The Journey of William of Rubruck, p. 261 (London, Hak luyt Society, 1900). In the Mongol period, designs of a tiger or lion skin, and the design of metal-armor scales, were also painted on hide armor (Yuan shi, Ch. 78, p. 12, K'ien-lung edition). 5 The clay figures in our collection come down from different periods. A rigid classification coinciding with dynastic periods cannot be established: two large groups may be distinguished,? archaic and mediseval. The two merge into each other. The former may be said to comprise roughly the Chou and Han periods, and to go down perhaps with some types into the fourth and fifth centuries; the latter occupy an epoch from the sixth to the eighth century. The term "archaic" is merely</page><page sequence="128">igS Chinese Clay Figures cusslon in the second part of this publication that, according to my interpretation, they are intended for the figure of the ancient shaman1 (wu, or fang siang shi). Among the exorcists of the Chou period, the Fang siang shi2 occupies a prominent place. According to the Chou li,d he donned a bear-skin decorated with four golden eyes,4 black trousers, and a red jacket. Armed with a spear and a shield, accompanied by a suite of a hundred attendants, he performed the purifications of every season, searching through the houses and driving out disease. At a great funeral service he strided in front of the coffin, and accompanied it to the grave. intended to convey a chronological notion, but is not applied here with reference to technique or style. The age of the T'ang dynasty may safely be regarded as the terminus ad quern for the industry of burial clay figures, for we know surely enough that under the Sung and Ming dynasties the paraphernalia for the grave were carved from wood, but not modelled in clay. This question will be treated fully in Part II. 1 Our word "shaman" is derived from the Tungusian languages (Manchu samant Gold sama). The Mirror of the Manchu Language (Manju hergen-i buleku bithe) explains the word saman by means of the Chinese phrase chu shin j in ("a man who invokes or conjures the spirits"); and it is defined, enduri weceku-de jalbarime baire nialma ("a man who prays to and conjures spirits by sacrificing"). It is said in the same Dictionary that the saman acts near the sick-bed, and that there are male and female samasa (plural of saman). The Tungusian word has no connection whatever with Chinese sha-men (from Sanskrit gramana, P?li samana) denoting a Buddhist ascetic (Yule and Burnell, Hobson-Jobson, p. 820); a Buddhist monk and a Siberian shaman will always remain two distinct affairs. Pelliot (Journal asiatique, Mars Avril, 1913, p. 468) has traced the word saman in the language of the Ni?chi to a Chi? nese document of the twelfth century. The identity of the notion conveyed by the Chinese word wu ("sorcerer ") with the word "shaman" becomes evident from T'ang shu, where in the description of the Kirghiz it is remarked, "They call their sorcerers kan (hu wu wei kan)." The latter word (formerly articulated kam) is identical with Turkish kam, the general designation for the shaman in all Turkish dialects (compare W. Schott, ?ber die echten Kirgisen, Abhandlungen der Berliner Akademie, 1865, p. 440). While reading the proofs, I receive No. 3 of the Revue orientate (Vol. XIV, 1914), in which J. Nemeth devotes a special investigation to the origin of the word saman: by applying methods of comparative philology, he arrives at the result that the word is an ancient property of the Turkish-Mongol languages. 2 Cheng K'ang-ch'eng, in his commentary to the Chou li (Biot, Vol. II, p. 150), explains the word fang siang shi as "expellers of formidable things," by substituting two other words lot fang siang yielding this sense; but this conjecture is not adopted by the editors of the Chou li under K'ien-lung. Biot translates the term, much too literally, by inspecteurs de region, or by preservateur universel. Grube (Religion und Kultus der Chinesen, p. 51) renders it "supervisors of the four points of the com? pass." De Groot (The Religious System of China, Vol. VI, p. 974) proposes the translation, "inspectors or rescuers of the country to the four quarters." These translations do not render account of the two words fang and siang: fang (No. 3435) means not only "place, region, quarter," but also "a recipe, a prescription;" and fang shi, according to Giles, is "a master of recipes,? a medicine man; a necroman? cer." The word siang* (No. 4249) means "to judge of by looks; to practise physiog? nomy " (hence in Buddhism: the lakshana or physical marks of beauty of a Buddha). The fang siang shi, accordingly, is a "doctor" who has two functions,? he prescribes medicines, and practises the art of physiognomy (siang fa). 3 Biot, Vol. II, p. 225. 4 Apparently a mask, which was worn by the Chinese shamans in all exorcising ceremonies (see De Groot, The Religious System of China, Vol. VI, pp. 974-980, 1151, 1187 et seq.; also, Vol. I, p. 162).</page><page sequence="129">Defensive Armor of the Archaic Period 199 When the coffin was lowered into the grave, he struck the four corners with the spear, in order to chase away the spirits wang-liang.1 The bear-skin, a Chinese commentator explains, serves the purpose of lend? ing him a formidable appearance; and the four golden eyes testify that he spies in the four regions of the empire all places where contagious diseases are raging. The spear seems to indicate that he combats malignant spirits, and the shield is his means of defence against their attacks. The two figures of shamans represented on Plates XV-XVII are clad with tight-fitting, sleeveless leather jerkins, the material being cut out in the form of scales arranged in regular horizontal rows. On the front (Plates XV, XVII) the scales are carefully outlined in black ink or varnish over a coating of pipe clay;2 on the back of one of the figures (Plate XVI) they are impressed in the surface of the clay, presumably by means of a stamp. This process is not applied to the other figure, whose back is plain. In both, the jerkin is held by means of a leather belt tightly drawn around the loins. It does not seem to have a slit in front, and was presumably put over the head. The shaman in Plates XV and XVI wears a hide helmet surmounted by a queer crest, and laid out in vertical grooves; on the back (Plate XVI) coifs of hide scales are attached to it. The other shaman (Plate XVII) is adorned with a snail-like, high tuft of hair held by a hoop. Both are manifestly repre? sented in the attitude of warriors, displaying the same pose of arms and feet. The right arm is raised, the thumb being placed against the second finger: they are apparently in the act of throwing a spear; and the spear, presumably of wood, may have actually been in their hands. The left arm reaching forth with clinched fist, and the feet wide apart, correspond to this action; and the two men naturally concentrate their weight on their right sides. The lively fighting attitude and the body armor show us that the two shamans are engaged in a battle with the demons; and, if the tradition of the Chinese is correct that such clay figures were interred in the graves during the Chou period, we may infer that, as the shaman warded off pestilence and malignant spirits from the grave before the lowering into it of the coffin, he continued in this miniature form to act as the efficient guardian of the occupant of the grave. Helmets bedecked with scales occur also in Chinese illustrations (Fig. 33), and seem to have remained in the possession of shamans, even though they did not don the scale armor. The clay figure of a magician 1 No. 12,518.

A cape of tiger-skin envelops his shoulders. He wears a necklace and jewelry with floral designs on his chest. His coat is girdled; and a shirt of mail, presumably plate mail,1 is emerging from beneath it. In his left hand, which is perforated, he seems to have seized a spear or sword.2 A rectangular bag, which pos? sibly serves for the storage of his paraphernalia, is attached to the belt on his left-hand side. The wearing of a coat over the armor is character? istic of the T'angperiod; and the artistic, though conventional, modelling of the face would seem to point to the same epoch. In general, the conditions of defensive armor, as encountered in the archaic epoch of China, show a striking coincidence with those found in other ancient and primitive culture-groups of Asia, and those still alive in primitive societies. On the whole, the military equipment of the ancient Chinese in principle agrees, for instance, granted the difference of material, with that of the Scythians as described by Strabo (VII, 3), who states that they used raw ox-hide helmets and cuirasses, wicker shields, spears, bows, and swords. 1 See Chapter V. 2 Presumably one of wood, which has decayed under ground.</page><page sequence="131">III. DEFENSIVE ARMOR OF THE HAN PERIOD "Your servant understands that, according to the clas? sics, the perfection of government consists in preventing insurrectionary troubles, and the highest point of military art is to avoid the occasion of war." Yang Hiung in TsHen Han shu. The sculpture of the Han period unfortunately furnishes no decisive contribution to the question of body armor. While possibly the artists may have intended in some cases to represent armor, as perhaps in some of the fighting horsemen, the stone work does not minutely indicate texture, and the material is such that no positive inferences can be drawn from it.1 The only piece of defensive armor that is clearly enough outlined on these monuments is the shield or buckler, usually handled in connection with a sword. It is oblong and rectangular in shape with a convex curvature in the centre, causing a hollow on the inner side where the wearer's hand finds its place, and is notched in the middle of the upper and lower ends (Fig. 25). It is a parrying shield easily movable, and sufficient to protect the left arm and to ward off blows struck at it.2 It is notable that many soldiers represented on the Han monuments carry their shields also in their right hands, while manipulating the swords in their left; I presume that the fighters, when wearied out, sought relief in this manner by changing weapons from one hand to the other. In Fig. 25 a left-handed, and in Fig. 26 two right-handed shield-bearers have been selected. The same shield is employed also by soldiers fighting from war-chariots. Another form of shield is much larger, more convex, almost roof shaped, decorated with what appears like a tree design, and capable of hiding a man's face and the upper part of his trunk (Fig. 27).3 1 The difficulty of studying from the bas-reliefs the costume and the ornaments displayed on it, is acknowledged also by M. Chavannes in his recent work Mission archeologique dans la Chine septentrionale, Vol. I, part i: La sculpture ? Tepoque des Han, p. 39 (Paris, 1913). On a stone of the Hiao-t'ang-shan, M. Chavannes (p. 82) has correctly recognized some warriors clad with cuirasses; but hardly any other conclusion than that it is in general the question of hide armor can be drawn from these representations. These warriors are barbarians styled Hu, and in all probability Huns (Hiung-nu, who are frequently termed also Hu). We shall come back to this monument below in speaking of the tactics of the Huns. 2 See, for example, Chavannes, Mission, Nos. 131, 136. 3 Ibid., No. 190. Chavannes (La sculpture ? l'^poque des Han, p. 251) states that this buckler is of rattan, doubtless for the reason that there are still rattan shields in China; but these are always circular, almost half-spheroidal, and plaited in basketry style.

Soldier with Circular Buckler (Sketch from Rubbing of Han Bas-relief representing the Battle on the Bridge). against an arbalist whose crossbow he has adroitly overturned with a thrust of his shield, while a footman is attacking his rearing horse rattan plaiting. It is much more likely to be of wood covered with hide, on which the design is painted. The rattan shields have often been described and illustrated (Amiot, Art militaire, MSmoires concernant les Chinois, Vol. VII, p. 371, and Plate XXX, figs. 10 and 11; de Guignes, Voyages ? Peking, Vol. Ill, p. 20; Atlas of Staunton's Embassy, Plates XVII and XIX, No. 5, etc.). In Peking I had occasion in 1901 to see these shields used by fencers, and procured two specimens painted with tiger-heads for the American Museum, New York. The general opinion of the Chinese is that rattan shields are a matter of recent development, and that originally shields were made from a combination of wood and hide (see Huang ch'ao li kH Vu shi, Ch. 15, p. 21, where the earliest relevant text quoted is the Ki siao sin shu of 1566 by Tsi Ki-kuang, followed by the Wu pei chi of 1621 by Mao Y?an-i). The earliest illustration of the rattan shield I am able to trace is in the Lien ping shi ki (Ch. 5, p. 5, ed. of Shou shan ko tsxung shu. Vol. 52), written in 1568 (Wylie, Notes, p. 91). Merely judging from its circular shape, the round shield above referred to, in the hand of the soldier at the foot of the bridge, might be a rattan shield; but I venture to doubt that the latter was in existence during the Han period. The shield in question may as well be of wood or hide (compare Figs. 28, 30). The rattan shield painted with a tiger's head was officially introduced into the army under the Manchu. This troop was uniformed with a short jacket of yellow cotton stuff on which tiger stripes were represented in black, a pair of leggings and boots with the same design, and a hood in the shape of a tiger-head (see Huang ch'ao li kH Vu shi, Ch. 13, pp. 49-50; the shield is figured and described in Ch. 15, p. 21). 1 Chavannes, Mission, No. 136.</page><page sequence="134">204 Chinese Clay Figures with a spear. On this representation we notice another type of shield of circular shape (Fig. 28) on the arm of a warrior who is posted on the left-hand side at the foot of the bridge. The question as to the material from which this shield may have been wrought is not susceptible of positive decision. Certain it is, however, that three distinct types of buckler are depicted on the monuments of the Han.1 Of the three types of Han bucklers, the first may be ascribed as peculiar to the period, in so far as it does not seem to have survived in later ages; it is not alluded to in military literature, nor is it traceable among the specimens of shields in vogue during the Ming and Manchu dynasties. The case is different with regard to the two remaining types. The greatest authority on military matters is Mao Y?an-i, who published his work Wu pei chi (not mentioned by Wylie) in 1621 (80 volumes). It is the most comprehensive work of this class, and the one best il? lustrated. All relevant illustrations of the T*u shu tsi ch'ing, which quotes this author as Mao-tse, are derived from his work. In accordance with an older work Wu king ("Canon of Military Matters")? he dis? criminates between two main types of shields, the long shield of the footmen (Fig. 29), and the round shield of the horsemen (Fig. 30). The former is entirely made of wood, and, being as tall as a man, com? pletely screens his body. It rests on the ground, and is a veritable fence or bulwark.2 The latter, of wood covered with hide, is carried by the cavalier on his left arm, which is passed through the two straps in order to protect his left shoulder against arrow-shots, while he brandishes in his right hand the short sword.3 Mao admits that it offers no advan? tages, and it certainly was more an encumbrance than a safeguard. As the round buckler is peculiar to the horsemen, we may suppose that the Han soldier armed with it is an equestrian engaged in a dismounted combat. There are instances on record to the effect that the soldiers, especially when the decisive moment approached, dismounted from their horses, marched on foot, sword in hand, and engaged in close com? bat.4 From the wooden documents of Turkistan recently edited and trans? lated by M. Chavannes we learn that the shields used by the soldiers of the Han period were red; that is to say, they were made of wood, and 1 Thus likewise Chavannes, La sculpture, p. 37. 2 This is the same type of shield as that figured and described by Ph. F. v. Sie? bold (Nippon, 2d ed., Vol. I, pp. 336, 337). 3 The horsemen of the Kirgiz, who wore wooden cuishes, fastened a round shield to their left shoulder to ward off arrow-shots and sword-cuts (T'ang shu, Ch. 217 b, p. 8). 4 Compare the battle deciding the fate of Hiang Y? in Shi ki, Ch. 7 (Chavannes, Les Memoires historiques de Se-ma Ts'ien, Vol. II, pp. 318-320).</page><page sequence="135">Defensive Armor of the Han Period 205 51 I ?

The wooden documents employ the word tun,3 once formed with the classifier ispear' (mao);4 and in one passage5 appears the word pxai (No. 8574), which, as far as I know, is thus attested for the first time in the Han period.6 In his Introduction M. Chavannes has given an admirable sum? mary of the information garnered in these early documents, and has drawn a vivid picture of the garrison life in those outposts of the Chinese empire.7 He has sounded also the sentiments by which those soldiers were animated, by rendering several fine pieces of poetry of the T'ang period. There is still another, contemporaneous source which permits us some inferences as to the emotional life of those brave Han frontier guards. Chavannes8 has ably described the function of the signal towers erected along the frontier at intervals averaging thirty It, which served as optical telegraphs announcing the approach of hostile van? guards by means of huge beacon-fires. In many cases the guards stationed in these towers were kept alert in repelling undesirable in? vaders. 9 In the burial pottery of the Han period, which is a microcosm of the culture life of those days, we find a number of miniature models 1 Compare above, p. 189. 2 It seems to have been customary in the Han period to occasionally inter armor and shield with a general. We learn that the son of the marshal Chou Ya-f u purchased from an officer of the Imperial Armory a cuirass and buckler intended for the funeral of his father (L. Wieger, Textes historiques, p. 448). This act led to an ac? cusation against the old general, which resulted in his suicide; the illegal point of the case, however, was sought in the step of purchasing imperial property, not in the intended burial; and the charge was forced, as the Emperor was intent on causing the downfall of the old officer. The Ku kin chu by Ts'ui Pao of the middle of the fourth century relates that in the third year of the reign of the Emperor Chang (78 a.d.) people dug up the ground of a burial-place at Yuan in Tan-yang (An-hui Province) and found in it a piece of armor. It was a cuirass (kia). 3 Chavannes, /. c, Nos. 77, 763. 4 No. 75. 5 No. 682. 6 The Annals of the Han Dynasty employ neither of these words, but the word shun. 71 can only join Mr. L. C.

Beacon-towers in which lookout soldiers were kept, tun Vai (No. 12,205), were still in existence under the Ming dynasty, and are well described by Persian travellers in the fifteenth century (see Bretschneider, China Review, Vol. V, p. 34). Compare Fig. 31.</page><page sequence="137">Defensive Armor of the Han Period 207</page><page sequence="138">208 Chinese Clay Figures representing such watch-towers; and all these, according to the unanimous testimony of the Chinese, have been found in graves of Kan-su Province. The conclusion would seem justified that pottery of this type was in? terred, as worthy emblems of their martial calling, with renowned officers who had deserved well of their country in the frontier wars and had died the honorable death of the soldier. On Plate XIX is illustrated a green-glazed model of a three-storied watch-tower rising from the bottom of a round bowl: on the two parapets and roofs the sentinels are engaged in showering from their crossbows a volley of darts on an advancing column of scouts.1 Here we enjoy seeing before us in action the undaunted heroes of the Hunnic wars whose sentiments were im? mortalized by Li Po. The imposing loftiness of the structure standing with the force of a pyramid, the beautiful architectural forms, the jutting wooden beams supporting the corners of the parapets, are notable fea? tures making this bit of clay a live and unique document of the culture of the Han period. There are also less elaborate pottery models of such watch-towers. One in the Museum collection2 shows a single story with windows on three sides and a door ajar in the front wall; the windows are provided with elegant lattice-work. Another specimen3 represents the section of a city-wall with a roofed, square tower in the corner, to which a stair? case leads up. The most signal fact about defensive armor under the Han is that metal suits gradually made their way during this period. We meet, for the designation of it, a new word k'ai (No. 57.98), written with a charac? ter in which the classifier kin ("copper" 4 or "metal") enters, and which does not occur in the ancient canonical texts. From the terminology of the dictionary Shuo win (around ioo a.d.) we gather that armature had then grown more complete, that there were metal helmets {ton mou), brassards (few),6 and metal protectors for the nape (ya-hia).$ The old 1 This beautiful piece of Han pottery is in the collection of Mr. Charles L. Freer of Detroit, to whom I am greatly indebted for the photograph and his kind permis? sion to publish it.

In the Chou li gold is always designated huang kin ("yellow metal"). 5 Giles (No. 3791) translates "greaves; leg-guards for soldiers," which is doubt? less also correct; but the definition of this word in the Shuo win is pei k%ai; that is, arm-guards. 8 See Couvreur, Dictionnaire chinois-frangais, p. 115 b (also in Palladius, Chinese-Russian Dictionary).

These facts combined go to prove that far-reaching innovations had set in after the close of the Chou dynasty, and that the Han period must have revolutionized the entire method and technics of armature. Ch&amp;ig K'ang-ch'&amp;ig, the famous commentator of the Chou li9 who lived in the second century a.D., says anent the armorers of the Chou time1 that the ancients em? ployed hide in the manufacture of corselets (kia)9 but that now (in the author's time) metal (kin) was utilized for the same purpose, and that this product is designated k*ai. Of what metal was this new armor made? And what type of armor was represented by it? The most interesting contribution to this question is made by Chung Ch'ang-t'ung, 1 Biot, Chou Ii, Vol. II, p. 152.</page><page sequence="140">2io Chinese Clay Figures an author who lived in the beginning of the third century a.d., and who is known as the editor of the Taoist writer Yin W&amp;n-tse.1 He is quoted as follows in the Yen fan lu:2 "In days of old, war-chariots were em? ployed in warfare, and the fashion of iron plates was not yet in use for armor; at the present time, hide armor, though it can still offer sufficient resistance to a crossbow, will needs lead to the loss of the army and the destruction of the empire. Regarding this matter, it was at the time of the Posterior Han (25-220 a.d.) that armor received iron laminae, but it is not known what the state of affairs was at the time of the Anterior Han (b.c. 206-23)." Here it is plainly expressed that iron armor came up under the Later Han dynasty, and the expression Vie cha3 leaves no doubt that it was armor composed of iron laminae. In this connection another notice incorporated in Ko chi king yuan (Ch. 41, p. ib) would be of interest, if any dependence could be placed as to the value and the time of the source from which it is quoted. This is a work called "Dissertation on Corporal Punishments" (Jou hing lun) by K'ung Jung, a descendant of Confucius in the twentieth degree, who, according to Giles,4 died in 208 a.d. Nothing is known to me regarding this work; M. Pelliot, in his careful bibliographical study of Chinese law,5 does not mention it. In the present case, it would be indispensable to know exactly when that work was composed, as the author lays stress on a contemporaneous event, and to ascertain whether the incriminated passage was really contained in the original 1 Wylie, Notes on Chinese Literature, p. 156; L. Wieger, Taoisme, Vol. I, Le eanon, p. 184, No. 1159. 2 Completed in 1175 by Ch'&amp;ig Ta-ch'ang (Wylie, Notes on Chinese Literature, p. 160) and reprinted in the T%ang Sung ts'ung shu. 3 The word cha (No. 127) refers to the wooden or bamboo tablets used for writing and united into bundles of books before the invention of paper. The discoveries in Central Asia have rendered us familiar with the form of these wooden documents. The plates, as used in the manufacture of armor, have indeed a very similar shape; and hence the transfer of the name of the latter is easy to understand. Couvreur (p. 736 b) translates cha by "les couches de cuir ou les plaques de m?tal qui composent une armure;" Palladius in his Chinese-Russian Dictionary (Vol. II, p. 379) by "fish-scale, armor;" Giles gives the meaning "a layer" and "numerative of kia, armor." There are some passages in the Tso chuan and Han shi wai chuan (see P%ei wen yiinfu, Ch. 97, p. 6) where cha doubtless relates to the different layers of a hide armor; but as a rule it originally refers, as stated above (p. 196), to the scales of a hide scale armor. This is also the opinion of K'ungYing-ta (574-648), who, in his work Shang shu cheng i, gives the following definition of the word ye (No. 12,996),? "metal lamina or plate in armor; the metal lamina of armor is the same as that is called cha in the Kxao hung chi (in the Chou li)" The word cha, however, does not occur in the text of the Chou li, but only in the commentaries. In the same sense, the K'ang-hi Dictionary defines the word cha as kia ye, "armor leaves," that is, plates or laminae covering the armor. 4 Biographical Dictionary, p. 401. 5 Le droit chinois (Bulletin de VEcole frangaise d)' Extrime-Orient, Vol. IX, 1909? pp. 27-56).</page><page sequence="141">Defensive Armor of the Han Period 211 edition. Not being able to do so, I can give it only with all reserve: "The holy men of antiquity made armor of rhinoceros-hide; now the ptn ling1 have iron armor." The fact that the word k%ai, and the new type of body armor under? stood by it, were actually employed during the Han period, is now obviously brought out by the contemporaneous wooden slips discovered in eastern Turkistan, and which have been edited and translated by E. Chavannes.2 As already mentioned, the word k'ai occurs there on two of the wooden documents (Nos. 758, 794); while the ancient word kia is preserved in three other cases. Both types, kia and k'ai, accordingly, were in use among the outlying Chinese garrisons of the Han period; and as explicitly recognized by Chinese authors, the k'ai differed from the kia in the essential point that they were reinforced by metal pieces. The foundation of the armor k%ai consisted likewise of leather or hide; and in Chavannes' document No. 794 the question is of "four pieces of hide, two halves being so connected as to make two suits of armor." The "halves" seem to refer to two large pieces of hide covering chest and back. The metal helmet appearing under the Han and perhaps under the Ts'in dynasty (p. 175) is the natural accompaniment of metal armor; the galea of ancient times gives way to the cassis (Figs. 32, 33). The word ton mou for the metal helmet mentioned above appears, indeed, on one of the contemporaneous wooden slips of the Tsin dynasty (265-313).3 If the metal of the Later Han dynasty was iron, ? what was the metal employed during the Former Han dynasty? And what was the shape of the metal pieces attached to the hide foundation? It is not very likely, for technical reasons, that hide armor was im? mediately followed by armor consisting of iron laminae. The latter denotes a much more advanced stage of civilization, and presupposes acquaintance with the art of forging iron; it is also a much more complicated structure, its manufacture requiring a skill far superior to the more mechanical mode of preparing a coat of hide. We are fortunately in a position to show from both literary and archaeological evidence that iron hide armor was preceded by copper hide armor. In the work Yen fan lu quoted above, the observation is made that "in the times of remote antiquity and in the period anterior to the Ts'in and the Han leather armor named after the rhinoceros was much used in the army, but that in the records of Se-ma Ts'ien's Shi ki mention 1 Apparently the title of a military office at the time of the Han dynasty. 2 Les documents chinois decouverts par Aurel Stein dans les sables du Turkestan oriental (Oxford, 1913). 3 Chavannes, /. c, No. 794.</page><page sequence="142">212 Chinese Clay Figures is made of armor fabricated from forged copper (tuan kin wei kid); that, however, on close examination,, the employment of the latter is still much restricted."1 We shall not be far wrong in concluding that the metal pieces em? ployed for the reinforcement of armor in the period of the Anterior 1 The expression "to forge defensive armor" (tuan kia) occurs in Shi kit Ch. 112, in the biography of Chu-fu Yen (compare P*ei win yiinfu, Ch. 106, p. 56 b). In the age of the Three Kingdoms (221-277) metal armor, for which copper or iron was utilized, was firmly established, as we see from the life of the famous General Chu-ko Liang (San kuo chit Wu chi, Ch. 19, p. 1 b), who lived from 181 to 234 (see Giles, Biographical Dictionary, p. 180). In Tsin shu and Sung shu, metal armor is fre? quently mentioned. An iron mask (Vie mien) for the protection of the face is first mentioned as being employed in the period Yung-kia (307-313 a.d.) by General Chu Ts'e (styled Chung-wen) in the battle of Hia-k'ou, in Han-yang fu, Hu-pei Province (Tsin shut Ch. 81, p. 6).</page><page sequence="143">Defensive Armor of the Han Period 213 Han were of that metal then most generally employed,?copper. And a number of perforated, thin copper plates exhumed in the environment of Si-ngan fu from a grave of that epoch tends to confirm this opinion. These laminae, some of which are sketched in Fig. 34, can but have served the purpose of being sewed on to the surface of a cuirass. They were employed for the making of a kxai, and formed the natural continua tion of the ancient scale armor kiai discussed at the end of the previous chapter. The scales in the latter were cut out of leather: in the third and second centuries b.c., the Han made a decided advance by gradual? ly transforming these leather into copper scales; and the Posterior Han, in the first centuries of our era, went a step farther in substituting iron for copper. The specimens in Pig. 34 demonstrate that the copper pieces leaned in their forms toward scales, though they approach to a higher degree the shape of a leaf (hence the term "leaf " which we meet in the Han authors). A slow and gradual development must have been</page><page sequence="144">214 Chinese Clay Figures in operation toward effecting that uniform oblong, rectangular shape which we are wont to designate as "plate." There is, for lack of monuments, as yet no means of exactly ascertaining the date when this type of regular iron plate armor sprang up in China. The term fie cha employed by Chung Ch'ang-t'ung, discussed above, is very tempting in leading us to assume that it existed at least toward the end of the Posterior Han period in the third century a.d. ; the word cha relates to the rectangular wooden writing-slips still prominent in the administra? tive system of the Han, and the application of this word to the plates of ^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^ Bronze Scales of Armor of Han Period (half of actual size). an armor is most happy. As these wooden slips possessed regular forms, we are allowed to infer that also the iron plates in the armor of the Han were gradually adapted to the same uniform standard. In the age of the Tang (618-906) iron plate armor presents itself as an accomplished fact, and was made with a technical perfection which must have been preceded by centuries of diligent and intelligent practice (see Chapter V). The existence of protective laminae of rectangular shape under the Han may be inferred also from another matter peculiar to that age.1 In the biography of Ho Kuang, who died in B.c. 68, the great "king? maker" of the Han dynasty, as Mayers calls him, mention is made of "jade clothes" (y? i). Yen Shi-ku (579-645), the famous commentator of the Han Annals, explains this term as denoting a coat of the form of an armor (k*ai), consisting of jade slabs joined together by means of gold threads; these jade slabs were shaped into regular plates (cha), one foot long and two inches and a half wide; they formed a perfect enclosure, and reached down to the feet. Another style of this garment, compared likewise with armor by Yen Shi-ku, was composed of strung pearls or 1 The following information is drawn from the Han tsien (No. 164.8) of Kua Ts'ang lin of the Sting; the edition before me is by Wu Ki-ngan of the Ming, and was pub? lished in 1600.

It is self-evident that these jade plates, of which we hear nothing at any earlier period, were produced in imitation of metal armor-plates; and Yen Shi-ku's simile with an armor strongly supports this opinion. By what factor was the innovation and progress of the Han in mat? ters of defensive armor caused? The development of the defence of the body moves along as the natural consequence of the advance in weapons of offense. "The history of invention as applied to war has been the record of alternate advances in this line, and in overcoming defence." 1 The steadily growing perfection of weapons necessitated a corresponding increase in the efficiency and power of resistance of body armor. The chief weapons of the Chou period were spear and bow; and the armor of rhinoceros-hide offered to them adequate opposition. In the age of the Han we meet the more effectual crossbow and the two-edged sword; and Chung Ch'ang-t'ung justly says that hide armor then was no longer a suitable shelter for the arrows shot from crossbows, if the interests of an army were to be maintained. The copper or bronze swords in vogue among the Former Han dynasty gradually gave way to iron swords under the Later Han dynasty; and parallel with this movement, we notice a logical development from plain hide and hide scale armor to copper scale and iron scale, and ultimately to iron plate armor. Thus, judging from appearances, it may be conceived that this sequence in the gradual perfection of armor might have been evolved from purely inward causes and necessities, and that no factors of any outward influence need be invoked in order to account for it; but such a conclusion hazarded without any regard to historical agencies would be plainly illusory. It cannot be denied that an entirely different point of view may be pursued in this problem. It may be argued that the Chinese, despite the numerous aggressive and defensive wars which they have made on the adjoining tribes, cannot be called, in the strict sense of the word, a warlike nation, and that they were always deficient in inventions of military implements. At all times they were ready to adopt any superior arms from their more belligerent neighbors, and to vanquish their enemies with their enemies' devices. The crossbow is properly claimed as a contrivance of the aboriginal tribes of southern China; and the type of the short bronze sword of the early Han (see Plate XX) bears such a striking similarity to that of the Siberian bronze age, that imitation due to historical contact may justly be suspected. Under the Han, cast-bronze swords (Plate XX) gradually gave way to 1 O. T. Mason, The Origins of Invention, p. 389.</page><page sequence="146">2l6 Chinese Clay Figures cast-iron swords (Plate XXI), the latter being cast in the same shape as the former. The process of transformation is identical with the one that we observe in the antiquities of Siberia. The excellent plates of ancient Siberian bronze and iron swords published by W. Radloff,1 in which bronze is colored green and iron brown, afford a good object-lesson for the study of the gradual transition from bronze to iron: here, for instance, we note that the hilt is changed into iron, whereas bronze is retained for the blade (Plate XII, No. 4); or that the blades become iron, and the hilts remain of bronze (Plate XIII, Nos. 1-3), until ultimately there spring up types purely of iron which faithfully preserve the forms and ornaments of the more ancient bronze swords. We know from literary documents that the Han still turned out weapons of bronze, that under the Former Han the latter were gradually superseded by iron weapons, and that these were definitely established under the Later Han: the year 219 may safely be regarded as the term when weapons were made exclusively from iron, and when bronze was discarded for this purpose.2 It will therefore be in general correct to assume for archaeological purposes that bronze swords bearing the characteristics of the Han, with greater probability belong to the period of the Former Han dynasty (b.c. 206-23), while cast-iron swords of the same features most probably range in the period of the Later Han dynasty (25-220 a.D.). The casting of iron for implements of every-day use is peculiar to that age: the Chinese then ingeniously applied to iron the same pro? cess as formerly to bronze, casting it in sand moulds, and perpetuating in the new material their ancient bronze forms. Thus we have large bulging vases (of the type styled hu) with movable lateral rings and inscriptions in Han style cast in high relief on the exterior of the bot? tom,3? of the same shape as the corresponding vases in bronze and pot? tery. There are, further, stoves, large cooking-kettles, cooking-pans, coin-moulds, bells, lamps, chisels, knives, and mountings for chariot wheel-naves,? in style and decoration breathing the spirit of Han culture, and the complete decomposition of the thick iron core testifying to their great antiquity. The cast-iron spears shown on Plate XXI, owing to the decay of the iron substance underground, have almost lost their original forms. The swords are in a somewhat better state of preservation. They are two-edged, like the older bronze prototypes. 1 Siberian Antiquities (Materials toward the Archaeology of Russia, No. 5, in Rus? sian, St. Petersburg, 1891). 2 See the interesting observations of F. Hirth (Chinesische Ansichten ?ber Bron? zetrommeln, pp. 18-22, and The Ancient History of China, pp. 234-237). 3 It is the well-known formula i hou wang ("may it be serviceable to the lords!").</page><page sequence="147">Defensive Armor of the Han Period 217 with massive iron hilts, but with lozenge-shaped guards of bronze coated with a dark and polished patina. We are now confronted with the fact that the Han period has run through the same phase of development with regard to offensive and defensive armor. It is therefore inevitable to conclude that a correlation exists between these two developments, and that the production of defensive iron armor under the Posterior Han is prompted by the coeval coming into existence of iron weapons. The two phenomena are in mutual proportions. In the same manner, the perfection of bronze arms under the Anterior Han must have resulted in the machination of bronze protective armor. The same causes bring about the same effects; and if the agencies of the cause, the weapons, are suspected with good evidence of foreign origin, the same suspicion is equally ripe for the effects ? defensive armor. The one is inconceivable without the other. In the ancient Siberian swords we meet the same process of development from bronze to iron as in ancient China, and this paral? lelism plainly reveals the historical interrelation of the two culture groups. This being the case, the further supposition is justifiable that also the progress made under the Han in body armor might be due to an impetus received from the same quarter. At this point due attention must be paid to the great historical connections linking all Asia in mat? ters of military art. No human invention or activity can be properly understood if viewed merely as an isolated phenomenon, with utter disregard of the causal factors to which it is inextricably chained. Every cultural idea bears its distinct relation to a series of others, and this reciprocity and interdependence of phenomena must be visualized in determining its historical position. The development of harness must be viewed in close connection with the mode of military tactics/ the science of warfare: every progressive step advanced in the latter draws a natural reaction on the form of armament, and a transformation of the latter is a sure sign of the fact that a considerable change in tactical conduct has preceded it. It is therefore from the history of tactics that we must derive our understanding of the technique of armor. The problem now set before us is,? What great movement in military tactics caused the radical transformation of arms experienced by the peoples of China, Central Asia, and Siberia around the centuries of our era? This movement, in my opinion, proceeded from ancient Iran. I shall endeavor to demonstrate that far-reaching tactical reforms were launched in Iran and deeply affected the entire ancient world, and that these innovations spread from Iran to the Turkish tribes of Central Asia, and were handed on by the latter to the Chinese. Developments of tactics and armature moved along very similar lines in the three groups.</page><page sequence="148">2l8 Chinese Clay Figures First of all, attention should be called to the fact (and this cannot be an accident) that the new parts of the armor added in China during the Han period are exactly those which we find in ancient Persia. The nape-guard (ya-hia)1 meets its counterpart in the k?iris named in the Avesta, rendered in the Pahlavi version grlvp?n ("neck-guard") and explained by the gloss, "attached behind from the helmet to the corse? let." 2 The Avesta mentions also leg-guards,r?nap?n? ("thigh-protec? tor") which are interpreted as greaves; and according to Jackson, the helmet is described in the Avesta as made of iron, brass, or gold.3 Likewise the new mode of righting prevailing in the Han period ? the use of the sword in connection with shield and armor ? is paralleled in Persia when we read in Xenophon's Cyropcedia (II, i, 21) that Cyrus, in training his men, relieved them from practice with the bow and the javelin, and exercised them in but one direction, to fight with sword, shield, and armor.4 Further, it is essential to grasp the fundamental fact of the difference between mounted archers and true cavalry, and the development of these two different arms and means of tactics among the Iranians. Herodotus (VII, 84) states that the Persian horsemen were equipped in the same manner as the infantry, except that some of them wore upon their heads devices wrought of brass and steel. Accordingly, the Persian cavalrymen of that time must be credited with the wearing of sleeved tunics of diverse colors, bedecked with breastplates of iron scales like fish-scales, as attributed by Herodotus (VII, 61) to the infantry. The description of Herodotus (IX, 49) leaves no doubt that the Persian horsemen fighting the Greeks were only a body of infantry mounted on horses and chiefly depending upon their bows, at which Herodotus expresses astonishment by remarking that, though horsemen, they used the bow; they were, accordingly, mounted archers. This mode of fighting was spread over the entire Scythian and Iranian world. The Scythians shot with bow and arrow from horse? back (Herodotus, IV, 131), and singly skirmished in open order against their opponents, attacking them here and there where chance or advantage offered; they were at the same time nowhere and ubiquitous, effectually screening their operations. The Massagetas (Herodotus, I, 1A Chinese word suspicious of foreign origin. 2 A. V. W. Jackson, Ancient Persian Armor (in Classical Studies in Honor of Henry Drisler, p. 118, New York, 1894). 8 Ibid., p. 119. The greaves are mentioned also by Xenophon (Anabasis, vin, 6); Herodotus (vii, 84) ascribes brass and steel helmets to the Persian cavalry men; Xenophon (Cyropcedia, vi, 1, 2) speaks of brazen helmets, and in one case (vi, 4, 2) of a golden helmet. 4 Compare also Cyropcedia, 1, 2, 12.</page><page sequence="149">Defensive Armor oe the Han Period 219 215) were familiar with the mode of fighting both on horseback and on foot, which indicates that when in the saddle they were mounted foot? men. The Parthian mounted archers were dreaded and detested by the Romans, chiefly because in taking to flight they shot their arrows back? ward at the pursuing enemy.1 The Mongols, during their invasions, availed themselves of the same mode of tactics. " In battle they with? draw in good order, as soon as they are at a disadvantage,n says the Ar? menian historian Haithon, "but it is very dangerous to pursue them, as, though turning back, they are able to shoot during the flight, and thus wound men and horses." According to Xenophon (Anabasis, VIII, 6, 7), there were around Cyrus about six hundred cavalry, the men all armed with breastplates, greaves, and helmets, except Cyrus, who presented himself for battle with his head unprotected;2 and all the horses of the cavalry that were with Cyrus had defensive armor on the forehead and breast. Here, then, for the first time is the question of real cavalry; horse and man being completely armored, and this new equipment being a sign of a new mode of tactics, while in the age of Herodotus the horse of the Persians was not yet caparisoned.3 Though the term "cataphracti" is not used by Xenophon, the institution described by him is either the forerunner of the latter or identical with them. In Cyropcedia (VI, 4, 1), besides the frontlets and breastplates of the horses, single horses with greaves, and chariot horses with plates upon their sides are mentioned; so that the whole army glittered with brass, and shone with purple garments. Abradatas equipped the horses of his chariot with brazen mail {ibid., VI, 1, 51).4 In the same work (VII, 1, 2) it is on record that all those who were with Cyrus were fur? nished with the same equipment as himself; purple coats, brazen armor, brazen helmets, white crests, short swords, and each with a spear made of the timber of the corneil-tree. Their horses were armed with brazen forehead-pieces, breastplates, and shoulder-pieces which simultaneously served as thigh-protectors to the rider. The rider allowed his feet to hang down behind these flank-pieces which safeguarded his thighs. 1 E. Bulanda, Bogen und Pfeil bei den V?lkern des Altertums, p. 61 (Wien, 1913). 2 On the armor of Cyrus see Xenophon (Cyropcedia, 1, 4, 18; vn, 1, 2). 3 The Massagetae (Herodotus, i, 215), who in their costume and mode of living resembled the Scythians, had their horses caparisoned with breastplates of bronze, while gold was utilized for the bridles, the bit, and the cheekplates. The fact that the horses in the army of Xerxes were not caparisoned is practically demonstrated by the Nisaean charger of the Persian noble Masistius, which received an arrow in its flank (Herodotus, ix, 22). Neither were the horses of the Assyrians caparisoned, who possessed only mounted infantry, not cavalry in the strict sense. 4 Compare also vi, 2, 17.</page><page sequence="150">220 Chinese Clay Figures Finally, in his concluding chapter (VIII, 8, 22), in which Xenophon laments the gradual degeneracy of the Persians after the death of Cyrus, he sums up again by saying that Cyrus, after breaking them of the habit of skirmishing at a distance, armed with breastplates both men and their horses, gave every one a javelin in his hand, and trained them to close fighting; but now, the historian complains, they neither skirmish from a distance, nor do they engage hand in hand. In this passage it is clearly stated that Cyrus was the father of a new mode of tactics, and that this method was exactly what we understand by regular cavalry in the modern sense,? horsemen engaging in close combat, and charging their opponents with all possible speed by means of javelin, spear, lance, or sabre. The Cyropcedia, of course, is nothing more than an historical romance, and the attribution to the elder Cyrus of the new tactical principle is plainly an anachronism; it must, however, have been in full operation among the Persians in Xenophon's time. It cannot have existed under Cyrus, as we do not find it in the army of Xerxes invading Greece. The mail-clad warriors of the Persians and related nations became known in the antique world under the name cataphracti (KarcuppaKroi) or catafractarii, derived from cataphracta, the designation of their de? fensive armor. Sarmatians clad with such armor are represented on the Column of Trajan; actual fragments of armor of this sort discovered in graves of southern Russia, and, further, the notices of classical authors, enable us to form some idea of the appearance of these suits of armor.1 They consisted of a foundation of cloth or leather, to which scales or laminae of metal (copper or iron), more rarely of horn or bone, were sewed on in such a manner that the single rows overlapped, each row covering the upper part of the row immediately below. The result, accordingly, was a type of scale armor (&lt;p6\i5wt6s) , the details in the arrangement of which naturally escape us. It was singularly flexible, provided with sleeves, and enveloping the entire body except that por? tion of the thighs which grips the horse. It was well adapted to the form of the trunk, and permitted the soldier ample freedom of motion. The horses likewise were completely armored with the same kind of scales, though they were frequently caparisoned with leather only (Ammianus, XXIV, 6),2 as they were handicapped by the weight of the metal. The man had to be lifted on his horse. He was equipped with a long spear, which was supported by a chain attached to the horse's neck, and at the end by a fastening attached to the horse's thigh, so as 1 Compare the excellent article of E. Saglio in Dictionnaire des antiquites grecs et romains, Vol. I, p. 966. 2 Operimentis scorteis equorum multitudine omni defensa.</page><page sequence="151">Defensive Armor of the Han Period 221 to get the full force of the animal's weight into the spear-thrust.1 At a given signal, the squadron composed of such horsemen dashed forth for the assault of the enemy, and was a formidable weapon against the infantry armed with bows, as the body protection rendered the horsemen arrow-proof. There were also cataphracti armed with bows, as follows from the figure of such a cavalier represented on the Column of Trajan, and shooting backward. It is clear that this troop could be efficient only as a united body and for the purpose of a surprise charge; when successfully repelled, the result must have been disastrous to the clumsy horsemen. The single ones were incapable of defending themselves; and we hear that the Gauls who accompanied the army of Crassus practised the stratagem of seizing their lances and pulling them off the horses. The difference in principle between the former mounted bodies of archers and this new system of cavalry is obvious: the mounted infantry soldier was an individual, and as such an independent fighting unit, able and mobile on any occasion, be it charge, enduring battle, or pursuit; this troop did not advance at command in any regular align? ments, but dispersed in open order, small bands suddenly sallying forth here and there, and as swiftly turning round, now attacking, then feigning flight, exhausting their opponents in pursuit, then rallying and pushing forward again till the contest was decided. The new cavalry troop was a machine set in motion by the will and word of a single com? mander. It was effective as long as the body preserved the agility of its members and worked with collective action as an undivided unit. Its success was bound up with the speed, security, and force of its assault; when the charge failed, its case was lost. When and by whom this new mode of tactics was invented is un? known. We have seen that it existed in Persia at the time of Xenophon, and the idea seems to have indeed originated among Iranians. Sub? sequently we find it in the army of Antiochus Epiphanes; and from the time of Antoninus Pius it became common in the armies of the Romans, soldiers of this description being frequently mentioned in inscriptions of that period. Thus we see the Romans adopt the strategy of their adversaries,? a bit of history which, as we shall see presently, repeats itself in China. The Iranian mode of strategy with the peculiar body armor for man and horse spread likewise to the Scythians (see p. 220), and to Siberia as far as the Yenisei, as witnessed by the famed petro glyph of a mounted lancer equipped with plate mail. This horseman in? deed represents a cataphractus (Fig. 35). This monument may be 1 Smith, Wayte, and Marindin, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities,. 3d ed. (Vol. I, p. 384).</page><page sequence="152">222 Chinese Clay Figures roughly dated in the time of the Siberian iron age, and is surely coeval with the period of Chinese-Turkish relations in the epoch of the Han. In fact, the Turkish tribes who fought the Chinese at that time had undergone a similar development from the primitive and crude warfare of mounted archers to the principle of organized cavalry, like their Iranian neighbors; and the Turks, on their part, were duly seconded in this respect by the Chinese. We know surely enough that the pri meval Chinese did not possess cavalry, and that their battles were fought by soldiers on foot or in war-chariots (p. 185). We know, further, that the tactics of mounted infantry archers, in imitation of Turkish practice, were first organized in China by King Wu-ling (b.c. 325-299) of Chao; that he introduced the narrow-waisted and tight-fitting barbaric costume among his subjects, and taught them shooting with the bow while on horseback.1 Regular cavalry, we see, came up in China from under the Anterior Han, and this was still less a truly Chinese idea than the mounted infantry. It was adopted from the Huns; and the Huns, I venture to assert, ? though this impression cannot be supported at present by a literary document,? had learned this lesson from Ira? nians. There is no escape from the conclusion that historical contact and derivation must have been in operation, for it would be against all 1 See the writer's Chinese Pottery, p. 216.</page><page sequence="153">Defensive Armor of the Han Period 223 reason to assume that both the Huns and the Chinese should independ? ently have run through the same stages of development of a complex series of phenomena as the Iranians did several centuries before this period. The inward identity of these developments on the three sides, resulting in the same styles of body armor improved by the utilization of metal, and the same manner of fighting, is sufficient proof for the fact that the one nation successively adopted the new practice from the other. It would be beyond the scope of the present investigation to enter into the details of the history of this military institution in China. China's military history has been much neglected, though it offers a wide field for studies of great culture-historical interest. Among these, a research into the subject of cavalry is worthy of special consideration. A few suggestive remarks may here be offered.1 The Huns, the Hiung-nu of the Chinese Annals, were born fighters, tribes of horsemen, and expert archers. According to the picture of their life drawn by Se-ma Ts'ien,2 they taught their children to practise riding on the backs of sheep, and to shoot birds and rodents with bow and arrow. Qualification in archery made the soldier, "and every soldier strong enough to bend a bow was a cuirassed horseman." 3 This plainly indicates that the soldiery of the Huns consisted of mounted archers fighting in open order and individually, like the Scythians; and the historian further adds that their offensive weapon for distant fight? ing was the bow and arrow,4 while in close combat they employed swords and short spears. Whether they engaged also in dismounted combat, we do not know. When Se-ma Ts'ien adds that they were not ashamed of flight, this is duly connected with their mode of fighting, as set forth above (p. 218) in regard to Iranians and Scythians:5 their flight was a 1 An interesting work giving a digest of the military affairs of the Han dynasty is the Pu Han ping chi (reprinted in Chi pu tsu chai ts'ung shu). 2Shiki, Ch. iio, p. i b. 3 Thus in the translation of E. H. Parker (China Review, Vol. XX, p. i), which seems to me exact. Hirth (Ancient History of China, p. 168) translates, "Having grown to become soldiers, they would thus become excellent archers, when they were all supplied with armor on horseback." This, though generally rendering the sense of the passage, is hardly in Se-ma Ts'ien's text; at any rate, the words kia ki cannot be separated, but form a technical term, "a horseman clad with hide armor." The word kia in Se-ma Ts'ien invariably refers to hide armor or cuirass, not to metal ar? mor, which is kxai. 4 As swift and mounted archers the Huns appeared in Europe (motibus expediti, et ad equitandum promptissimi: scapulis latis, et ad arcus sagittasque parati. Jornandes, xxiv), as did the Mongols at a later date. s Marco Polo (ed. of Yule and Cordier, Vol. I, p. 262) very aptly says in re? gard to the Mongols,14 As they do not count it any shame to run away in battle, they will sometimes pretend to do so, and in running away they turn in the saddle and shoot hard and strong at the foe, and in this way make great havoc. Their horses are trained so perfectly that they will double hither and thither, just like a dog, in</page><page sequence="154">224 Chinese Clay Figures sham-flight to deceive and exhaust their opponents, and they did not fail during this manoeuvre of retreat to send their arrows backward. Their cuirass (kia) was of leather obtained from the skins of their domestic animals, from which also their ordinary clothing was prepared; in addition to leather garments, they had coats of felt. The re-organizer of the military power of the Huns was the famed Moduk1 (Mau-tun), who at the end of the third century b.c. welded the scattered tribes into a compact unit. Moduk was the son of the Shan-y?2 T'ou-man, who afterwards had a younger son by a favorite consort. Wishing to disinherit Moduk, and to place this younger son on the throne, he sent Moduk as hostage to the old enemies of the Huns, the Y?e-chi (Indoscythians), and then went on the war-path against the latter. Moduk, his life being thus imperilled, thought of his safety, and, stealing one of the swiftest horses of the Y?e-chi, fled homeward. His father, who thought this was an heroic deed, placed him in command of ten thousand horsemen. The ambitious Moduk then plotted against his father's life and throne. The Chinese historian Se-ma Ts'ien3 narrates the story of how he achieved his scheme, in a high? ly anecdotal form, from which important events are apparently omitted. The story is that Moduk, making sounding arrows,4 trained his equestrian a way that is quite astonishing. Thus they fight to as good purpose in running away as if they stood and faced the enemy, because of the vast volleys of arrows that they shoot in this way, turning round upon their pursuers, who are fancying that they have won the battle. But when the Tartars see that they have killed and wounded a good many horses and men, they wheel round bodily, and return to the charge in perfect order and with loud cries, and in a very short time the enemy are routed. . . . And you perceive that it is just when the enemy sees them run, and imagines that he has gained the battle, that he has in reality lost it, for the Tartars wheel round in a mo? ment when they judge the right time has come. And after this fashion they have won many a fight." This picture holds good as well of the Scythians, Huns, and T'u-kue. From the numerous representations of the mounted archer shooting backward on the relief bands of the Han pottery we see how deeply impressed the Chinese were by this feat of military skill. 1 This is the correct Turkish restoration of the name, as based on the data of the Chinese commentators, according to O. Franke (Beitr?ge aus chinesischen Quellen zur Kenntnis der T?rkv?lker und Skythen Zentralasiens, Abhandlungen der preus sischen Akademie, 1904, p. 10). He reigned b.c. 201 to 177. 2 Title of the sovereigns of the Huns. Compare Plate XXII for a Chinese pictorial representation of one of the Shan-yu. 3 Shi ki, Ch. no, p. 3 b. Compare A. Wylie, History of the Heung-noo in their Relations with China (Journal of the Anthropological Institute, Vol. Ill, 1874, p. 408); E. H.

Hirth (Sinologische Beitr?ge zur Geschichte der T?rk-V?lker, p. 254, St. Petersburg, 1900), who very well characterizes Moduk as a hero. 4 He did not invent them, as Wylie translates. Also Giles (No. 10,928; ming ti) states that the sounding arrows were "invented by Mao-tun or Meghder" (simi? larly Palladius, Vol. I, p. 174). Aston (Nihongi, Vol. I, p. 87) makes Parker say that the sounding arrows are not Chinese, but an invention of the Huns; but Parker (China Review, Vol. XX, p. 7), referring to the nari-kabura of the ancient Japanese, observes only that the latter seem to have imitated the Huns. In my opinion it is</page><page sequence="155">Defensive Armor of the Han Period 225 archers in shooting with them. An order was issued by him to the effect that all his men, at whatever goal he should discharge a sounding begging the question to speak in this ease of an invention of Moduk, or of a Hunnic invention, or of invention at all; for such a contrivance is not an invention creditable to an individual or a single tribe. It represents the result of a gradual finding and experimenting, the how, when, and where of which is lost. All we may safely assert is that chronologically we first meet these buzzing arrows among the Huns, ? and the text of the Shi ki contains the oldest record of them, ? and that numerous archae? ological finds made in central and western Siberia testify to the fact that this type of arrow was formerly generally diffused among the Turkish stock of peoples (compare B. Adler, Pfeifende Pfeile und Pfeilspitzen in Sibirien, Globus, Vol. 81, 1902, pp. 94-96; this brief notice is purely descriptive, without an historical point of view). Moduk did not invent the sounding arrow, which surely existed before his time, and which was used by his countrymen for hunting purposes; but he turned it to a novel use by availing himself of the whizzing noise as a signal for a cavalry attack. With this specific end in view he had such arrows "made," as the Chinese text says, which implies that they were previously known. Hirth (/. c, p. 254, note) has justly doubted whether Moduk may be regarded as the "inventor" of the sounding arrow, since a similar expression (hao shi, No. 3872, "sounding arrows, discharged by bandits as a signal to begin the attack") is metaphorically employed by the philosopher Chuang-tse of the fourth century b.c. But the ming ti of Moduk must have been affairs somewhat different from the latter, otherwise we should not have the two dif? ferent terms. There are indeed (and the ethnographical point of view should never be neglected) diverse types of sounding arrows in our collections. An arrow can be made "sounding" by merely having one or several perforations in the iron blade; and the humming is essentially intensified by a special whistling apparatus inserted be? tween shaft and head. This device is an oval-shaped knob of wood or bone, perforat? ed like a whistle with two, four, or more holes, on which the wind plays when the arrow sharply cuts the air. I venture to presume that the sounding arrow mentioned by Chuang-tse belonged to the first of these types, and that of Moduk to the second; the interpretation given by Ying Shao (Shi ki, Ch. no, p. 3 b) of the term ming ti leaves no doubt as to this fact. Again in the Chinese Annals we hear of sounding arrows being in the possession of the T'u-kue or Turks (for instance, Chou shu, Ch. 50, p. 3; Pei shi, Ch. 99, p. 2; and Julien, Documents historiques sur les Tou kioue, p. 9). A new term appears in the Annals of the T'ang Dynasty (T'ang shu, Ch. 39, p. 9), ? hiao arrows (hiao shi). The word hiao, not listed in any of our dic? tionaries, is written with a character composed of the classifier ' bone' (ku) and the phonetic element hiao ('filial piety'). This reading is indicated in the Glossary of the T'ang Annals (Ch. 4, p. 2 b) where the word is explained by the older term ming ti ("sounding arrow"). The manner of writing the word indicates that the question is here of arrows with a whistling contrivance carved from bone. These arrows, according to T'ang shu, were sent as tribute from the district Kuei-ch'uan in Kuei chou, now the prefecture of S?an-hua in Chi-li Province (Playfair, Cities and Towns of China, 2d ed., No. 7363). Sounding bone arrows, accordingly, were made and used in China during the T'ang period; and in coming to Japan, we need not invoke the Huns, but are confronted with the plain fact of an idea directly imported from China. The K?jiki of 712 a.D. (B. H. Chamberlain's translation, p. 72) relates that "the Impetuous-Male-Deity shot a whizzing barb into the middle of a large moor, and sent him [the Great Deity] to fetch the arrow, and when he had entered the moor, at once set fire to the moor all round." The text employs the same charac? ters for the word as Shi ki and TsHen Han shu (Ch. 94 a, p. 2 b: ming ti), but they receive the Japanese reading nari-kabura (literally,' singing turnip'). Chamberlain, in the introduction to his translation of the K?jiki (p. lxix) , justly emphasizes that this peculiar kind of arrow belongs to the traces of Chinese influence on the material culture of old Japan (Japanese illustrations in Ph. F. v. Siebold, Nippon, 2d ed., Vol. I, p. 342, and G. Mueller-Beeck, Mitteilungen der deutschen Ges. Ostasiens, Vol. IV, p. 3, Plates 5 and 6). In the Nihongi of 720, a sounding arrow with eight eyes or holes is mentioned (Aston, Nihongi, Vol. I, p. 87; K. Florenz, Japanische Mythologie, p. 206). Reverting to China, we have for the Mongol period Rubruck's account to the effect that Mangu made a very strong bow which two men could</page><page sequence="156">226 Chinese Clay Figures arrow, should aim at the same, under penalty of decapitation. To ascertain how far his followers might be relied upon, he speedily put them to the test. Taking the sounding arrow, he aimed at his favorite horse, when some of his attendants hesitated to follow his example, and were decapitated on the spot. A sterner test was soon in store: his attendants stood aghast at seeing the sounding arrow fly at his cherished wife; those fearing to comply with the order were at once beheaded. Afterwards he went ahunting and discharged the sounding arrow at King T^u-man's favorite horse; his men without exception duly followed suit: thus Moduk knew that his adherents could be trusted, and finally resolved on the accomplishment of his grand coup d'etat. While on a hunting-expedition with his father, he seized a favorable opportunity to let a sounding arrow fly at the Shan-yu, whereupon a volley was fired at him by his adherents. The king fell; and his death was followed by the massacre of his wives (except Moduk's own mother), his youngest son, and all officers of state who refused allegiance to the victor. Moduk set himself up as Shan-y? in b.c. 201.1 There is assuredly the fact of a large political movement at the bot? tom of this narrative. Certainly, there was no need of a brigade or two of cavalry to eliminate the person of the king; it was a wrestle for the kingdom which involved a contest with a huge army. The problem confronting Moduk was how to overrun the king's powerful host. At this point his reform set in: he became the drill-master of his equestrian archers and a prominent cavalry tactician. His task was beset with hardly string, and two arrows with silver heads full of holes, which whistled like a pipe when they were shot; Mangu sent these as a symbolic gift to the King of the Franks (W. W. Rockhill, The Journey of William of Rubruck, p. 180). As to the Ming period, these arrows are figured in the Wu pei chioi Mao Y?an-i of 1621 (Ch. 102, p. 10). Those used in the army under the Manchu dynasty are illustrated and described in the Huang ch*ao li k% Vu shi (Ch. 14). They exhibit a great number of types and varieties which require a special study; in principle, there are two chief classes,?arrows with sharp iron points stuck into the whistle; and arrows with whistle, but without any iron point. The latter do not serve the purpose of killing, but of making only a certain impression. The Kalmuk of the eighteenth century availed themselves of whizzing arrows in hawk-hunting. When the water-fowl frightened by birds of prey would not rise, it was roused by means of such arrows provided with a bone knob, but without iron; for the fowl should not be slain while in the water (P. S. Pallas, Sammlungen, Vol. I, p. 147). Such blunt sounding arrows were used till the end of the Manchu dynasty by the imperial body-guards to frighten ob? trusive people when the emperor was driving out. Wounds from this weapon, if any, were of course harmless. This type of arrow is styled pao (E. v. Zach, Lexicogra phische Beitr?ge, Vol. I, p. 50); it is not, however, as v. Zach explains, merely the bone knob which is so called, but the entire implement. The bone knob is termed ku pao. The word pao first appears in the T'ang leu Hen (the "Six Statutes of the T'ang Dynasty") in the sense of a bone arrowhead. At one time, sounding arrows were used in old England, the arrowheads being perforated (J. Strutt, Sports and Pastimes of the People of England, p. 12 7). 1 This is the date given by M. Tchang (Synchronismes chinois, p. 118). Wylie gives the date as b.c. 209.</page><page sequence="157">Defensive Armor of the Han Period 227 grave difficulties; to break the former deep-rooted habit of irregular fighting on the part of these wild hordes, and to train them to the word of one chief commander, required a master's mind and an iron will? power. Men always wont to unrestricted freedom in the discharge of their weapons, and almost unconstrained as to their movements and operations on the battle-field, were now forced to absolute subjection under the command of the chief, and compelled to fire volleys strictly at his signal, ? a genuine cavalry feat. Speaking cum grano salts, Moduk did the same as Cyrus in Xeno phon's Cyropcedia, or Maurice of Nassau when in the war of inde? pendence of the Netherlands (1568-1609) he drilled his German mer? cenaries, who were more lightly armed and mounted than their Spanish opponents, to form in two or three lines, to move rapidly, and to make direct charges while firing their pistols at the enemy. Moduk's method of drilling naturally presupposes an orderly array of his troops in rigor? ous alignments. The revolutionary character of his innovation, which was a source of amazement to his countrymen, is indicated by the grad? ual exercises and tests, and the severe punishments meted out to the negligent ones. His military genius is illustrated by the fact that he conceived the bold plan of introducing a radically new mode of tactics, that of organized and compact cavalry, in order to overthrow his father's irregular horsemen. He opposed the art and strategy of war to natural belligerents, the principles of cavalry attacks to unprincipled savage warfare. Was Moduk himself the inventor of this new science of tactics? This can hardly be presumed. We remember that he lived as a hostage among the Y?e-chi. This, of course, was at a time when the Y?e-chi still occupied their seats in the northern part of Kan-su; their westerly migration took place in b.c. 165. Maybe he learned military lessons from the Y?e-chi. The facts, at all events, prove that he had the spirit and nerve of Cyrus in him. The Iranian standard is clearly demonstrated in his doings. In the same manner as Iranian cavalry practice was adopted by the Romans, it deeply influenced the Turkish tribes; and Moduk was the prominent leader and organizer of this reform. In reading carefully the battles fought by the Huns against the Chinese, we recognize, despite their meagre and incomplete descriptions, that the Huns were most expert cavalry tacticians, who fully practised the rules laid down by Frederick the Great after the lesson which he received from the Austrians at the battle of Mollwitz,? "Every officer of cavalry must ever bear in mind that there are but two things required to beat the enemy: first, to charge him with the greatest possible speed and force; and second, to outflank him." Hunnic skill in manoeuvres</page><page sequence="158">228 Chinese Clay Figures of the latter sort1 and their ability for making the best of the field of operations or any accident of territory, are especially notable in the fierce struggle against the army of Li Ling. On outpost and scouting duty they were unsurpassed. The manner in which Moduk in an unusually cold winter forced the army of the first Han Emperor, 320,000 men, mostly infantry, into a siege, enticing it on by feigning defeat and flight and keeping his best forces in ambush, is a feat worthy of this military genius. It is a deplorable loss that the details of this unique campaign have not been recorded accurately.2 A "battle of the Huns" is preserved on the stone monuments of the Hiao-t'ang-shan.3 There we see them galloping on their sturdy ponies, and shooting with bow and arrow. Others are equipped with long hal? berds, and show us that the Huns charged in the same manner as the cataphracti. One horseman makes an attempt to drag another out of the saddle by means of a long lance with presumably hooked point.4 A dismounted warrior, clad with a cuirass and with sword in hand, is engaged in cutting off heads. Also some of the mounted archers have donned an armor. Reserves waiting in ambush are kept in the back? ground, shielded behind hilly ground or artificially thrown-up intrench ments.5 The king of the barbarians is seated in front, giving instructions to a man kneeling before him. 1 It is interesting that there is a Turkish word for this manoeuvre, tulghatna. This practice was introduced by B?ber into India, and is described in his Memoirs (Pavet de Courteille, B?ber nameh, Vol. I, p. 194, and P. Horn, Das Heer- und Kriegs? wesen der Grossmoghuls, p. 22, Leiden, 1894). The cavalry of the Moghuls, con? sisting of armored lancers mounted on caparisoned horses, certainly is an offshoot of the ancient cataphracti. 2 A great setback to the study of military matters is the lack in the Chinese annals of any descriptions of battles, such as we have in the classical authors. The annalists are usually content to state the figures of the respective armies, the names of the commanders, date and locality of the battle, and its final dry net result with the quota of the slain and captives; but nothing, as a rule, is given out concerning the military operations in the course of the battle. Only in the biographies of the prominent gen? erals of the Han period do we occasionally encounter a somewhat detailed record of the military evolutions of a combat, though these also are sadly deficient and pass over in silence what we are most anxious to learn. The Confucian scholar never was interested in the military side of the events. 3 Chavannes, Mission, No. 47, and La sculpture, p. 82. In a poem of the first century a.d. by Wang Yen-sh&amp;n, descriptive of a palace in K'u-fu, the home of Con? fucius, are mentioned representations of people from Central Asia (Hujin) depicted in a group on the upper parts of the pillars. They were outlined kneeling in a reveren? tial attitude opposite one another. "There they remained unmoved with their long and narrow heads and their eyes in a fixed gaze like that of a bustard (tiao). Over their lofty noses and deep eyes they lifted their highly arched eyebrows. They looked sad as if in danger" (J. Edkins, in Chinese Recorder, Vol. XV, 1884, p. 345). 4 Such lances are illustrated in Wu pei chi and other Chinese works concerning military matters. 6 M. Chavannes (/. c.) conceives them as going out of tents. This point of view is possible, but the opinion as given above seems to be preferable. The outlines here in question have hardly any resemblance to tents.</page><page sequence="159">Defensive Armor of the Han Period 229 It must certainly be granted, as justly emphasized by Chavannes,1 that the Huns were initiated also into the more "scientific" strategy of the Chinese by those Chinese generals who, from fear of being cashiered and court-martialled at home as a sequel of their defeats, preferred surrender to the enemy. The brave General Li Ling, who was forced to surrender to the Huns, is reported to have trained their soldiers in the art of war as then practised by the Chinese; the Emperor, on hearing these tidings, condemned him as a traitor, and caused his mother, wife, and children to be put to death.2 Hirth,3 in balancing the advantages and shortcomings of Hunnic and Chinese warfare, thinks that the Chinese have had on their side greatly superior armament and a certain uniformity of organization. The latter observation is doubtless to the point, but I hardly believe that Chinese arms were superior in technique to those of the Huns: the ancient bronze and iron arms discovered in Siberian soil are surely as good as any of ancient China. Possibly the crossbow, which was foreign to the Huns, rendered the Chinese superior in some respect. The military equipment and organization of the Han, compared with that of the Chou, show a number of fundamental changes which are simultaneously symptoms of radical reforms in the manner of tactics and strategy. The main features of these innovations are the great importance attributed to the horse,?as the renowned General Ma Yuan put it, "the horse is the foundation of all military operations," 4 ? the preponderance of horsemen over infantry, the prevalence of the crossbow over the bow, the use of body armor on' the part of the horse? men, and the gradual development of a genuine and regular cavalry. The immediate cause of these military reforms was brought about by the endless struggles with the ever-restless nomadic hordes threatening the north-western outskirts of the empire; and imitation of their mode of warfare consequently became imperative. The wearing of armor by the horsemen, as we noticed, was a custom of the Huns; and if the Chinese followed suit, we may well lay it down as an adoption of Hunnic practice. This is not merely an impression in the matter, but a fact confirmed by the report of Ch'ao Ts*o presented to the throne in b.c. 169.5 In this lengthy memorial the diversity of Hunnic and Chinese warfare is set forth in detail; and for the first time the formation of a 1 Les Memoires historiques de Se-ma Ts'ien, Vol. I, p. lxix. 2 Giles, Biographical Dictionary, p. 450. 3 Ancient History of China, p. 166. 4 Hou Han shut Ch. 54, p. 9. 6 L.

He further advised employing the tactics of the Huns against the Huns, and hiring mercenaries of the horde I-k*? for this purpose; while within the boundaries of the empire the Chinese army should continue with the Chinese mode of tactics. This suggestion was not earned out im? mediately, but we see it brought into effect under the Emperor Wu (b.c. 140-87), who may be regarded as the reformer of Chinese cavalry. The man who really achieved the work and infused new life into the cavalry arm was General Ho Kl?-ping, who completely abandoned the traditional ground of Chinese tactics, and put the institution of chevaulegers into practice.2 As a youth of eighteen he was an ac? complished horseman and archer, and at the head of a squadron of eight hundred chevaulegers, forming the advance-guard of the army, gained laurels against the Huns. In b.c. 121, when only twenty years of age, he was appointed commander-in-chief of the entire force of chevaulegers, and defeated the Huns in six consecutive battles.3 His common sense is shown by the fact that he positively refused to study Sun Wu's "Art of War," and preferred to trust to his own judgment. This doubtless means that he was a practical man who rejected theories, and by long experience had grasped the warfare of his adversary and appropriated the latter's method as the most promising one. His victories over the Huns are due to the tactics of cavalry which he adopted, while his pred? ecessors under the early Han emperors prior to Wu met with dis? astrous failures by opposing infantry to the horses of the enemy. Surely the Chinese had bought their experience at a high price. Cavalry thus grew during the Han period into an independent arm, and finally was the most important one in the wars against the roving tribes of Central Asia. The cavalry had its own organization and administrative powers. As shown by a passage in a memorial 1 Or pHao ki (No. 9134), "fleet cavaliers" (see Chavannes, Les Memoires his toriques de Se-ma Ts'ien, Vol. Ill, p. 559), apparently translation of Turkish lap kunli (P. Horn, Das Heer- und Kriegswesen der Grossmoghuls, p. 21, and W. Radloff, W?rterbuch der T?rk-Dialecte, Vol. III, col. 1922). 2 A repetition of this spectacle took place in Europe when it suffered in the tenth century from the inroads of the Hungarians, until Henry I of Germany, by adopting the cavalry methods of the enemy, finally succeeded in repelling him. Again, in the thirteenth century, the light horsemen of the Mongols and Saracens got the better of the iron-clad cavalry of central Europe. Only the German Order of Prussia then possessed enough military acumen to form an excellent light cavalry under the designation "Turcopoles" placed at the command of a "Turcopole," which rendered good services against Lithuanians and Poles (M. Jahns, Ross und Reiter, Vol. II, p. 86). 3 His biography is in Shi ki (Ch. 1 n) and TsHen Han shu (Ch. 50). It has been translated by A. Pfizmaier (Sitzungsberichte Wiener Akademie, 1864, pp. 152-170); see also Giles, Biographical Dictionary, p. 260.</page><page sequence="161">Defensive Armor of the Han Period 231 presented by Huai-nan-tse to the Han Emperor Wu, there were then four officially recognized main bodies of troops,?war-chariots, cavalry, archers, and arbalists.1 The new order of military affairs is especially expressed by the new military offices instituted by the same Emperor. The high signi? ficance which the tactics of cavalry must have reached in his time is very conspicuous in these functions. He established a commander of cavalry (tun ki hiao wei), a commander of the squadrons of foreign cavalry (yile ki hiao wei) formed by the men of the country of Y?e subjected to China, a commander of the squadrons of foreign cavalry (ch%ang shui hiao wei) formed by the Turks or Huns (Hu) of Ch'ang shui and S?an-ho, and a commander of the Turkish or Hunnic cavalry (hu ki hiao wei) stationed at Ch'i-yang.2 In this institution of Turkish cavalry3 incorporated with the Chinese army we may recognize a positive sign of the fact that the Chinese had borrowed the whole affair from their Turkish neighbors, and utilized against them their own tactical stratagems. Also in the military colonies founded by the Emperor Wu in Turkistan to break the power of the Turks, detachments of cavalry were established.4 The perpetual wars with the turbulent nomads required an immense number of horses. "In view of his campaigns against the barbarians of the north, the Son of Heaven maintained a large number of horses, several myriads of which were reared in the capital Ch'ang-ngan," relates Se-ma Tslen.5 "In b.c. 119, the commander-in-chief and the general of the chevaulegers made a great incursion to attack the barba? rians of the north; they took from eighty to ninety thousand captives. Five hundred thousand pounds of gold were distributed as reward. The Chinese army had lost over a hundred thousand horses. We do not here render an account of the expenses incurred by the land and water transportation, the chariots and cuirasses."6 Here, accordingly, is the question of cavaliers wearing cuirasses. The generals of the Han dynasty were all clad with armor and mounted on horseback. When in 48 a.d. General Liu Shang was badly defeated by the Man barbarians, General Ma Y?an, who had formerly 1 L.

Biot, Memoire sur les colonies militaires et agricoles des Chinois (Journal asiatique, 1850, pp. 342, 344, 345). 0 Chavannes, Les Memoires historiques de Se-ma Ts'ien, Vol. Ill, p. 561. 6 Ibid., p. 569.</page><page sequence="162">232 Chinese Clay Figures gained laurels in their pacification, turned in a petition asking to be placed in service again. As he was in his sixty-second year, however, the Emperor declined his offer in view of his advanced age. Ma Y?an then made a personal appeal to him, saying, "Your servant is still able to sit in the saddle with the armor on his body." The Emperor de? manded the experiment, whereupon the aged soldier flung himself into the saddle and daringly looked around, in order to demonstrate that he was still of use. The Emperor, filled with admiration, entrusted him with the command.1 It is on record that General K?ng Ping, who died in 91 a.D., was always at the head of his troops, enveloped with his armor and mounted on horseback.2 There is thus sufficient evidence at hand that the Chinese derived their whole system of cavalry from the Huns, both cavalry tactics and cavalry equipment; and there can be no doubt of the fact that the Chinese made exactly the same use of cavalry as the Huns.3 Thus the Iranian ideas have filtered through the Huns into the Chinese. For this reason it is most likely also that the new cuirasses bedecked with copper and iron laminae, coming up in China during the epoch of the Han, received their impetus from the west, more specifically from the metal scale and plate armors worn by the Iranian and Scythian cataphracti. As said before, the history of cavalry development in China (and that of military art in general) remains to be written. An interesting observation may still be added here. Under the Sui and T'ang, the light cavalry, apparently the inheritance of the institution of the Han, was in full operation, particularly in the campaigns against the Turkish tribes. It seems, however, that the method of cavalry charges, as established by the Han after Hunnic example, had subsequently fallen into oblivion; for we are informed from the interesting biography of Yang Su inserted in the Annals of the Sui Dynasty4 that this daring 1 Hou Han shuf Ch. 54, p. 12 b; Hirth, Chinesische Ansichten ?ber Bronze? trommeln, p. 60. 2 Chavannes, TKoung Pao, 1907, pp. 223, 224. 3 A good example of the employment of cavalry for reconnoitring is furnished in b.c. 152 by the feat of Li Kuang, who went out with a guard of a hundred horsemen and suddenly saw himself confronted by a cavalry corps of several thousand Huns. He advanced to make them believe that he represented the vanguard of a large force following. At a short distance from the enemy he gave orders to dismount and to unsaddle, in order to show that he had no mind to retreat. A captain of the Huns sallies out; Li Kuang and ten of his men jump on their horses, and fell him with an arrow-shot. He turns back, unsaddles again, and orders his soldiers to graze the horses, and to take a rest. Until the evening the distrustful Huns durst make no charge. Under cover of night, the Chinese retreated in good order. The interesting biography of Li Kuang has been translated by A. Pfizmaier (Sitzungsberichte Wiener Akademie, 1863, pp. 512-528). 4 Sui shu, Ch. 48, pp. 1-6. According to Giles (Biographical Dictionary, p. 914) Yang Su died in 606 a.D.</page><page sequence="163">Defensive Armor of the Han Period commander was obliged to inaugurate again a reform of cavalry tactics. In 598 a.d. the Turkish Khan Ta-t'ou, the Tardu of the Byzantine historians, made an inroad into China; and Yang Su, appointed gen? eralissimo against him, met with unusual success. Formerly, the Chi? nese annalist tells us on this occasion, the generals in their battles with the Turkish hordes were chiefly concerned about the cavalry of the en? emy, and merely observed an attitude of defence by forming a carr6 of chariots, infantry and riders, the latter being posted in the centre sur? rounded by the other troops, and the carr? being encircled by an abatis.1 Yang Su held that this means of defence was merely an act of fortifying one's self, but could never lead to a victory; and he entirely abandoned this old-fashioned practice. He a ^ ^ ^ and worshipped. At the head of a hundred thousand picked equestrians he advanced, and suffered a distressing defeat from the hand of Yang Su, who charged him with all vehemence. Fortunately we are told also some details as to the method of Yang Su's offensive procedure. He was a harsh warrior, enforcing martial laws with Spartan severity: capital punishment was meted out to whomever infringed the articles of war. In open battle he began operations by rushing one or two hundred riders against the position of the enemy. Did they succeed in breaking him, it was all right; did they fail and retreat, he had all of them, irrespective of their number, beheaded on the spot. Then he proceeded to send forth a squadron of two to three hundred men, until the enemy was beaten. Thus his officers and men were overwhelmed with awe, and " possessed of a heart ready to die." From this time, Yang Su remained victorious in every combat, and reaped the fame of a remarkable com? mander.2 When I make the armament of the Iranian and Scythian cata formed his troops solely into squadrons of horsemen ready for immediate attack. On learning these tidings, the Khan was overjoyed, exclaiming, "Heaven has accorded me this favor!" Dismounting from his horse, he looked up to Heaven Fig. 36.

At least, there is no direct documentary testimony to this effect, save the rock-carved lancer on the Yenisei (Fig. 35), which thus far represents an isolated case. The "battle of the Huns" above referred to displays Central-Asiatic horsemen armed with long halberds amidst equestrian archers, and could possibly be invoked as attesting, on the part of the Huns, cavalry charges in the manner of the cataphracti. In the Chinese Annals, however, as far as I know, no instance of a charge of horsemen with spears,1 on the part of either the Chinese or the Huns, is on record; nor do I find any mention of armored horses in the Han period. The earliest palpable evidence for an armored warrior astride a caparisoned horse is represented by a clay figure pointing to the T'ang epoch.2 Several references in the Annals allude to such caparison in the sixth and seventh centuries of our era. As the facts are, neither the Huns nor the Chinese could have had any use for the more specific tactics of the cataphracti. These were directed against heavy-armed infantry lined up in regular files. The Huns did not possess any infantry; and the Chinese employed theirs against the Huns only in the experimental stage of their operations, and with such disastrous results that it deterred them from further experiments. On the whole, Hunnic-Chinese expeditions were cavalry wars conducted with light brigades. The long marches, the wretched roads, the difficulty of the field of operations, the uncertainty of supplies and forage, and the exhausting Central Asiatic climate, formed a serious handicap in the equipment of troops, man and horse, with heavy armament; so that a selective method in what western progress in the art of war had to offer became indis? pensable. In the Ming period mail-clad cavaliers managing lances and war-clubs 1 Spears are not mentioned in the Han documents translated by M. Chavannes, but the conclusion would not be warranted that they were then not used by the Chinese army. The renowned General Li Ling, who in b.c. 99 advanced into the territory of the Huns with a small army of five thousand foot soldiers, in the first encounter with the enemy, arrayed his ranks in such a manner that the front line was formed by those armed with spears and bucklers, while the archers and arbalists occupied the rear. The Huns, as well as the T'u-kue and Uigur of later date, accord? ing to the Chinese records (Pei shi, Chs. 97, p. 5; 99, p. 2), had spears. 2 See Chapter VII and Fig. $1.</page><page sequence="165">Defensive Armor of the Han Period 235 were in existence, as attested by an illustration in the Lien ping shi ki1 (Fig. 37).

HISTORY OF CHAIN MAIL AND RING MAIL Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs Piercing the night's dull ear, and from the tents The armourers, accomplishing the knights, With busy hammers closing rivets up, Give dreadful note of preparation. ?Shakespeare (King Henry V). In the preceding notes we attempted to establish on the basis of inward evidence a progressive historical sequence indicating a connec? tion which linked Iran, Tur?n, and China in matters of warfare and armament about the first centuries before our era. We now propose to subject to an investigation a specific case revealing in the time of the early middle ages the transmission of a well-defined type of body armor from Persia to China and other countries. At the present time we find widely distributed over Asia an interest? ing type of defensive armor occurring in the two variations of chain mail and ring mail. The word "mail" is derived from French maille (Latin macula), and originally designates the mesh of a net. Chain mail consists of interwoven links of iron or steel so joined together that the whole affair in itself forms a shirt or coat. Ring mail is composed of rows of overlapping iron or steel rings fastened upon a heavy back? ground of cloth or leather forming a jerkin. Chain mail was a favorite means of defence in the chivalrous age of Europe, during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. At present specimens are still encountered in Persia, among the tribes of the Caucasus, in India, Tibet, Mongolia, Siberia, and China.1 Tibet is probably now the only country in the world where chain mail is still donned in actual military service; while all other peoples simply keep it as an heirloom or relic of the past, or, like the chieftains of some Caucasian tribes, may sometimes parade it on ceremonial occasions. The origin of chain mail, as will be seen from the following notes, is to be sought in Iran. The Persian chain mail is an astounding example of the migration and wide distribution of a cultural object over a vast area. Not only is it diffused over India, Tibet, and China, but also over the whole of Siberia; and it is interesting to note that nearly all observers 1 Reference to the use of chain mail among the Kiu-ku Miao has been made above (p. 194) 237</page><page sequence="168">Chinese Clay Figures in those regions are agreed as to its foreign origin.1 Old Pallas2 describes it as existing among the Kalmuk on the Volga, and "consisting in Oriental fashion of a net-work of iron or steel rings." According to his investigations, "it arrived there through commerce with the Truch men and Usbek, likewise through wars with China; the finest is of Persian workmanship, wholly from polished steel, and is valued at fifty horses and even more. Such precious armor as well as fine swords and horses receive individual names among the Kalmuk and Tatar tribes. Armor of brass scales is the most common among the Mongols and in China." In various regions of the Altai, chain mail has been discovered which, according to W. Radloff,3 does not come down from the so-called Siberian iron period, but was imported at much later times from other countries, perfectly agreeing in its form, as it does, with chain mail wrought in the southern part of Asia. A. v. Middendorff 4 states that shirts of chain mail are still found in the possession of some Tungusians, reminding them of the valiant deeds of their ancestors. But J. Gmelin 5 in the eighteenth century had already observed that they had fallen into disuse among them, and were shown as mere curiosities. They are now alive only in their heroic tales; nor did I encounter any, despite repeated inquiry, among the Tungusian tribes with which I came in contact in eastern Siberia. The same is the case with the Irtysh-Ostyak, a tribe of the Ugrian stock of peoples, whose princes, judging from the references in their epic songs, were formerly in possession of chain mail. S. Patkanov,6 to whom this observation is due, comments that chain mail was previously known to almost all nations of western, and partially of middle and eastern Siberia, and that it presupposes a culture and manual dexterity superior to any that could be expected from most of these. Although the former inhabitants of those regions were rather well versed in the art of forging iron and weapons, he inclines toward the opinion that the shirts of mail formerly found among them originated from countries whose peoples were further advanced in culture, and that they were imported from the Orient through the medium of the 1 It is widely spread also over northern Africa (Zeitschrift f?r Ethnologie, Vol. XI, 1879, Verhandlungen, p. 34). 2 Sammlungen historischer Nachrichten ?ber die mongolischen V?lkerschaften, Vol. I, p. 145 (St. Petersburg, 1776). 3 Aus Sibirien, Vol. II, p. 130 (Leipzig, 1884). 4 Reise in den ?ussersten Norden und Osten Sibiriens, Vol. IV, p. 1516 (St. Peters? burg, 1875). 5 Reise durch Sibirien, Vol. II, p. 644; and C.

The representation of chain mail on figures in the cave-temples of Turkistan1 might be directly traceable to Iranian influence, which is overwhelmingly manifest in those monuments. But let us first exam? ine the state of affairs in regard to ancient Persia. Specimens of Persian armor of very ancient date, unfortunately, seem not to have survived; and our knowledge of the subject is largely founded upon literary records, and on reconstructions based on the appearance of warriors as often represented in the stone sculpture of the Sassanian period. In regard to the armor of the ancient eastern Iranian tribes, W. Geiger 2 remarks that it possibly consisted of metal scales or of a texture of brazen rings. The fundamental passage for our knowledge of ancient Persian armor remains Herodotus (VII, 61); and A. V. W. Jackson,3 taking it as the starting-point of his study, has made a very valuable contribution to the subject. According to the statement of Herodotus, the ancient Persians wore tunics with sleeves of diverse colors, having upon them iron scales of the shape of fish-scales; and this comparison leaves no doubt that scale armor, and not chain mail, is meant.4 The nobles and commanders seem to have worn breastplates of golden scales, bedecked with a purple tunic (Herodotus, IX, 22). This passage shows that Persian armor was solid enough to 1 A. Gr?nwedel, Altbuddhistische Kultst?tten in Chinesisch-Turkistan, pp. 8, 25 (Berlin, 1912). 2 Ostiranische Kultur im Altertum, p. 444 (Erlangen, 1882). 3 Herodotus vn, 61, or the Arms of the Ancient Persians illustrated from Iranian Sources (Classical Studies in Honor of Henry Drisler, pp. 95-125, 6 figs, and 1 plate, New York, 1894). 4 According to O. Schr?der (Reallexikon, p. 611), chain mail then became known in Europe for the first time.?The Persian shield mentioned by Herodotus under the name gerron, and contrasted with the Greek aspis, in my opinion, has not received full justice from the hands of Professor Jackson (/. c, p. 99). The additional note of Prof. Merriam (p. 124) is very ingenious, but it should not be forgotten that Ammianus Marcellinus (xxiv, 6, 8) describes the Persian shields as oblong and curved (convex), of plaited willow, and covered with rawhide, and as used by the infantry composed of the rural population (quorum in subsidiis manipuli locati sunt peditum, contecti scutis oblongis et curvis, quae texta vimine et coriis crudisgestantes, densius se commovebant). Similar types of shields, in which wood and skin were combined, occurred among the Arabs (G. Jacob, Altarabisches Beduinenleben, p. 136; G. Migeon, Manuel d'art musulman, Vol. II, p. 246, Paris, 1907). Typologi cally, they correspond to the circular Chinese shields plaited from cane or rattan, and painted with the head of a tiger (p. 203). The gerra alluded to by Herodotus were, I am inclined to think, likewise devices of plaited willow. G. Rawlinson translates, "They bore wicker shields for bucklers." Also Xenophon (Anabasis, 1, 8) speaks of Persian troops with wicker shields, and next to them heavy-armed soldiers with long wooden shields reaching down to their feet (the latter were said to be Egyptians). The ancients, according to the testimony of Vegetius (Instituta rei militaris, 1, 11), who lived at the end of the fourth century a.d., availed themselves of round shields, likewise plaited from willow twigs (scuta de vimine in modum cratium corrotundata).</page><page sequence="170">240 Chinese Clay Figures resist the blows of the Greeks, as the blows falling upon the breastplate of Masistius had no effect. Only a certain portion of the Persian army was shielded by armor, for in the battle of Plataea they perished in great numbers owing to their light clothing, contending against the heavily armed Greeks (Herodotus, IX, 63). Ammianus Marcellinus (XXIV, 6; XXV, 1) informs us that the Persians opposed the Romans with such masses of mailed cavalrymen, that the iron scales of their ar? mor suits, following the movements of the body, reflected a glaring splen? dor, and that their helmets, representing in front a human face, covered their heads completely, openings being left only for the eyes and nos? trils,? the only spots where they were vulnerable.1 The iron scale armor of early times was retained in the age of the Arsacides and Sassanians. Then, also, the force of the Persian army was the cavalry, consisting of the nobles. The horsemen occupied the first place in the order of battle, and success depended chiefly on their strength and bravery. On the Sassanian rock-carvings, chain mail appears beside scale armor. A bas-relief, probably from early Sas? sanian times, represents such a Persian horseman clad with chain armor reaching almost down to his knees, and provided with sleeves; his neck-guard is so high as to envelop his head completely; he wears a helmet with floating ribbons, and carries a lance nearly two metres long in his right hand and a small shield in his left, a quiver being attached to his belt. Head, nape, and chest of the horse are likewise protected by chain armor.2 At the time of the Khusrau, the complete 1 Contra haec Persae objecerunt instructas cataphractorum equitum turmas sie confertas, ut laminis coaptati corporum flexus splendore praestringerent occursantes obtutus.?Ubi vero primum dies inclaruit, radiantes lorieae limbis circumdatae ferreis, et corusei thoraees longe prospecti, adesse regis eopias indieabant.?Erant autem oni? nes catervae ferratae, ita per singula membra densis laminis tectae, ut juneturae rigentes compagibus artuum convenirent: humanorumque vultuum simulacra ita capitibus diligenter apta, ut imbracteatis corporibus solidis, ibi tantum incidentia tela possint. haerere, qua per cavernas minutas et orbibus oculorum adfixas parcius visitur, vel per supremitates narium angusti spiritus emittuntur. 2 Christensen (L'empire des Sassanides, p. 60, Copenhague, 1907), who describes this armor, says that it is scale armor. The monument to which he refers seems to be identical with the one illustrated by J. de Morgan (Mission scientifique en Perse, Vol. IV, p. 319) after a bas-relief of Takht-i-Bost?n, and identified with Khos rau II Purwez (591-628). De Morgan, however, interprets this armor as chain mail, which plainly appears on the helmet as reconstructed by him, enveloping the entire face and neck, two almond-shaped openings being left for the eyes; this coif of mail attached to the iron calotte of the helmet, according to de Morgan, is joined to the mail of the armor. Sarre and Herzfeld (Iranische Felsreliefs, p. 203, Berlin, 1910), in their description of this bas-relief, give the same interpretation of chain mail. According to the same authors (p. 74), the costume of a king on a Sassanian relief of Naqsh-i-Rustam consists of scale armor, and ring mail for the protection of arms and legs. On another relief (p. 83) the same kind of armature is pointed out, scale armor reaching down to the hips, while arms and legs seem to be enveloped with ring mail. In two other places (pp. 203, 249), however, chain mail reaching down to the knees is pointed out. I am under the impression that de Morgan and Sarre,</page><page sequence="171">History or Chain Mail and Ring Mail 241 outfit of the horsemen consisted of horse mail, a shirt of mail, a breast? plate, cuishes, a sword, lance, shield, a club attached to the belt, a hatchet, a quiver containing two stringed bows and thirty arrows, and two twisted strings in reserve fastened to the helmet.1 The manufacture of armor was at the height of perfection in the Sassanian epoch. When the Arabs overran the Persian Empire and conquered Ktesiphon, they found in the well-equipped arsenals the king's cuirass with brassards, cuishes, and helmet, the whole wrought in pure gold.2 Chain mail, which doubtless existed under the Sassanians, is dis? tinctly mentioned in the Avesta (Vendidad, XIV, 9) under the name zr?dha. According to Jackson,3 this word is presumed to designate the ringed mail-coat; so called, it is thought, from its rattling. The word is derived from the root zr?d (corresponding to Sanskrit hr?d), which means "to rattle." The Pahlavi version of the Vendidad passage renders the word zr?dha by zr?i, which answers to Firdausi's4 Persian word zirih, already explained by Vullers in his Lexicon Persico Latinum as "vestis militaris ex anulis fereis conserta." The identifica? tion of zirih or zireh with chain mail seems to be certain, for under the in their interpretations of armor on the bas-reliefs, are somewhat influenced by the statement of Herodotus. There can be no doubt, however, that chain mail was known in Persia during the Sassanian epoch, and at the much earlier age of the Avesta (see above). 1 Compare A. Christensen (/. c, p. 60); C. Inostrantsev, Sassanidian Studies, p. 80 (in Russian, St. Petersburg, 1909). 2 Christensen (1. c, p. 106). 3 L. c, p. 117. Bartholomae (Altiranisches W?rterbuch, p. 1703) renders the word only by "Panzerkoller, Panzer." 4 Compare the passage from the Sh?h-n?meh quoted by Jackson (/. c.t p. 107). O. Schr?der (Sprachvergleichung und Urgeschichte, p. 103; and Reallexikon, p. 611) assumes that Avestan zr?dha had the meaning "scale armor," and is identical with the one described by Herodotus. This opinion seems to me unfounded; Persian zirih, which is derived from that word, and the same transmitted to India, have the significance "chain mail;" so that also zr?dha is most likely to have had the same meaning. Schrader's point of view is merely prompted by the desire to make the interpretation of the word conform with the passage of Herodotus. This is naturally one-sided: Ir?n must have possessed various types of armor from ancient times, and chain mail must have pre-existed there before it was propagated from this centre to all parts of the world. From the Chinese account given below, it follows that chain mail held its ground in Sogdiana in the beginning of the eighth century; and if Jackson's identification of the Sino-Persian term ket-li-dang occurring in the Annals of the Sui Dynasty (see this volume, p. 28, note 1) is correct, we should have additional evidence for the employment of chain mail in Sassanian Persia. Of course, I do not mean to say that scale armor was out of commission during the Sassanian period; it may very well have persisted during that time, together with a variety of other kinds of armor. The fact that such were then in existence is brought out by the figure of the Persian grandee hunting a boar and a lion on the famous silver bowl in the Eremitage of St. Petersburg (A. Riedl, Ein orientalischer Teppich vom Jahre 1202, p. 28; and reproduced in many other books). A real history of Persian armor remains to be written.</page><page sequence="172">242 Chinese Clay Figures Fig. 38.

They are instructive from more than one point of view. First, they furnish actual proof of Persian chain mail, as well as helmet, having been transmitted from Persia into India. Second, as regards the manner of drawing, it will be noticed that the coat in Fig. 38 b is striking? ly similar to the Chinese sketch of ring mail in Fig. 41. Both convey the impression of scale armor, but are explained as, and intended for, chain mail and ring mail respectively.3 It is exceedingly difficult to produce a good sketch of either; and it is interesting to note that two draughtsmen, independent of each other, have had recourse to the same mechanical means of representing them. They teach, as many other cases, that caution and criticism are necessary in diagnosing types of armor after pictorial or other designs.4 The helmet (Fig. 38 a) with nasal and coif of mail (mighfar) is the same as that still extant in India, and from there conveyed to Tibet (Plate XXVIII). Irvine (p. 565) describes the zirih as a coat of mail with mail sleeves, composed of steel links, the coat reaching to the knees. There are six specimens in the Indian Museum. Armor in the collection of the Naw?b Wazir at Lakhnau is described in 1785 as follows: "The armor is of two kinds, either of helmets and plates of steel to secure the head, back, breast, and arms, or of steel network, put on like a shirt, to which is attached a 1 W. Irvine, The Army of the Indian Moghuls (Journal Royal As. Soc, 1896, P- 565). 2 Translation of H. Blochmann, Vol. I, Plate XIII (Calcutta, 1873). 3 Irvine (I. c, p. 564) remarks that from this figure it may be inferred that, in a more specific sense, baktar or bagtar was the name for fish-scale armor. Yet Bloch mann's explanation of this figure, according to the Ain I Akbari, is "chain mail with breastplate (bagtar).'' 4 Chinese sketches of defensive armor certainly are far from being good or accu? rate; on the contrary, they are purely conventional in style, a fixed and ready-made motive or model being employed for each type of armor. Yet they are not much worse than corresponding designs from India, Persia, and mediaeval Europe. At all events, they are interesting, and in many respects even instructive. Whatever their defects may be, if we are willing to understand the symbolic language of the draughts? men, their productions allow us in the majority of cases to recognize what type of armor is intended by them, in the same manner as inferences as to the type of armor intended may be deduced from the terminology of the language. In cases where no actual specimens are at our disposal, the Chinese illustrations may still claim a pri? mary importance; where we have specimens to study, as in the case of chain mail and plate armor, the sketches of the Chinese afford opportunity for an instructive com? parison; and for this reason I have drawn upon these sources also. They may render us essential assistance in interpreting the types of armor represented in statuary and painting.</page><page sequence="174">244 Chinese Clay Figures netted hood of the same metal to protect the head, neck, and face. Un? der the network are worn linen garments quilted thick enough to resist a sword. The steel plates are handsomely decorated with gold wreaths and borders, and the network fancifully braided." Thus Persian chain mail spread to India in the Moghul period. W. Egerton 1 observes that Persian arms were generally worn by the upper classes in India, and that the blades of swords were often Persian, even though mounted in India; in fact, as Persian artificers were fre? quently employed at the principal native courts, it is difficult sometimes to say whether a piece of armor is Persian or Indian. Whether ancient pieces of chain mail are still preserved in Persia, I am unable to say.2 Plates XXIII?XXV illustrate a piece of mail com? plete with all paraphernalia, the shirt with long sleeves being open in front. It was obtained at Tiflis by Mr. Charles R. Crane of this city, and is said to have served as the parade armor of a chieftain of the Khew sur.3 It is doubtless of Persian manufacture, as proved principally by the Persian designs on the arm-guard (Plate XXV, Fig. 2). J. Mourier 4 has already observed that the helmets with coifs of mail and the suits of chain mail found among the tribes of the Caucasus seem to be of Persian origin. The rings forming the texture of that mail con? sist of thin iron wire loosely twisted together, being neither welded nor riveted. This rather degenerate style of workmanship testifies to the fact that the suit in question was merely intended for ceremonial or pageant purposes: an energetic sword-blow would probably shatter the whole outfit. The iron casque of the well-known Persian form, called in Persian zirih-kul?h, is provided with a sliding nasal (nose guard), and with a couvre-nuque consisting of a long coif of mail guard? ing forehead, cheeks, neck, and shoulders. On Plate XXV the two-edged sword, arm-guard, hauberk, and gauntlet, completing the set, are shown. The Arabs have undoubtedly derived chain mail from the Persians. All the available historical evidence is decidedly in favor of Persian prior 1 An Illustrated Hand-Book of Indian Arms, p. 142 (London, 1880). 2 According to Egerton (1. c, p. 141), armor is now no longer worn in Persia, except to add to the pageant of their religious processions, held annually in the month of Muharram, to commemorate the death of Hassan and Hussain, the Shiah martyrs. Many that are of modern manufacture have been made for ornament rather than use, and betray in their style the decline of the art. The best period, judging from the examples preserved, seems to have extended from the time of Shah Abbas to that of Nadir Shah. The armor of Shah Abbas is in the British Museum; it is figured in G. Migeon (Manuel d'art musulman, Vol. II, p. 251, Paris, 1907). 31 am under obligation to Dr. Charles B. Cory, the present owner of the armor, for his courtesy in placing it at my disposal. 4 L'art au Caucase, pp. 156, 157 (Paris, 1907).</page><page sequence="175">History of Chain Mail and Ring Mail 245 ity.1 Among the ancient Arabs of the pre-Islamic epoch we meet with leather and iron armor,2 without any clear description of their appear an.ce. The latter seem previously not to have consisted of mail, though th s cannot be stated positively; but according to the descriptions of the poets, chain mail comes into question in the majority of cases.3 Tradi? tion ascribed its invention to King David, and the Koran (S?reXXI, 80; XXXIV, 10) sets forth that God himself taught David how to smelt iron, with which to make the rings, and to join them into a solid armor. This story certainly is devoid of historical value. The place Sal?k in Yemen was of old renowned for its armor consisting of a double row of rings. Also "Persian armor" is mentioned in Arabic records, where? by garments lined with silk and cotton were understood. "Armor from Sogd" (Sogdiana) became known after the foreign conquests of the Arabs.4 Possibly also scale armor was worn.5 Chao Ju-kua narrates that the ruler of Basra, when he shows himself in public, is accompanied by more than a thousand mounted retainers in full iron armor, the officers wearing chain mail.6 During the early middle ages of Europe, the horses of armies were not caparisoned. Only from the beginning of the thirteenth century, probably under the influence of the Crusades, were they pro? tected by chain-mail covers.7 According to Max Jahns,8 the chain mail (Parsen, Barschen), as it first appears during that time in the armature of the horse, is probably of oriental, and more specifically of Persian origin. Dr. Bashford Dean,9 the great authority on armor in this country, offers the following suggestive summary of this subject: "Chain mail marked a distinct epoch in the development of arms and armor: for it was light, flexible, and extremely strong. And it soon, therefore, came to supplant the 1 Compare the notes of C. H. Becker (Der Islam, Vol. IV, 1913, pp. 310-311). 2 F. W.

Jacob, Altarabisches Beduinenleben, p. 136 (Berlin, 1897). Becker (l. c.) mentions also Arabic cotton armor (lubb?da); what he calls ring mail (Ringpanzer), I believe, strictly speaking, is chain mail. In the age of the T'ang (618-906) the soldiers of the Arabs were equipped with bow, arrows, long spears, and metal armor (T*ang shu, Ch. 221 b, p. 8 b). 6 Lien huan so-tse kia, literally, "armor of chains, the links of which are mutually connected" (see Hirth and Rockhill, Chau Ju-kua, p. 137). 7 G.

Some authorities maintain that this form of armor was borrowed from the Orient; and certain it is that its development in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries was largely influenced by oriental models. If, however, this form of armor were derived originally from the East, it is a rather remarkable fact that its early appearance in Europe should be traced so clearly to the northern peoples, and that the 'byrnie' (briinne), or shirt of mail, should have become a characteristic part of the equipment of a Norseman. Never? theless it may still have been derived primitively from the East, since it is well known that the early excursions of the Viking carried them well into the Mediterranean, and that even by the eighth century they were well acquainted with many objects of oriental origin." The Arabs and Byzantines have transmitted chain mail to Europe; and a share in this movement may be attributed to the cultural exchanges between East and West during the crusades. At the time of Mohammed the Arabs had already adopted the Persian practice of protecting horse and man with armor, the armored horsemen and horses being designated mudja?af; that is, clad with the tidjf?f, the Persian felt armor.1 When we come to China, the situation is the same as in Europe and in India. Historical evidence is not lacking for the foreign origin of Chinese chain mail. Indeed, the first record alluding to it, the T'ang shu? in its account of K'ang (Sogdiana, Samarkand), states that in the beginning of the period E?ai-y?an (713-741), Samarkand sent to China chain armor (so-tse k'ai) as tribute.3 The famous poet Tu Fu, who 1 Compare C. H. Becker (Der Islam, Vol. IV, 1913, p. 311). Becker states that the history of defensive armor in the Islamic world still remains to be written; but his remarks render it sufficiently clear that the origin of these things is to be sought in Persia, and that they were transferred to Europe through the medium of the Arabs and Byzantines. The soldiers of the Byzantine army were protected for the most part by scale armor, though, judging from quite early monuments, ring or chain mail was sometimes used (O. M. Dalton, Byzantine Art and Archeology, p. 684, Oxford, 1911). 2 Ch. 221 b, p. 1 b. 3 A tribute of armor from Samarkand is still recorded in the Ming shi under the year 1392 (see Bretschneider, China Review, Vol. V, p. 123). It can of course be presumed only that the chain mail sent by Samarkand was of Persian origin; but this conclusion is most probable, as the culture of Sogdiana, the capital of which was Samarkand, was thoroughly Iranian. Prom what was said above on "armor from Sogd" it seems that among the Arabs Sogdiana was regarded as a famous seat of the manufacture of armor. In view of the fact that chain mail is an Iranian import in China it is curious that in the Persian legend of Alexander's expedition to China, the King of China presents to him among many other things a hundred long coats of mail (H. Zotenberg, Histoire des rois des Perses, p. 440). In T'ang shu (Ch. 220, p. 3 b), where an account of the foreign tribes of the east, including Koreans and Tungusians, is given, mention is made of a so kia ("chain cuirass"); the word k*ai is not used, and the question is probably of a leather corselet with rings attached to its surface.</page><page sequence="177">History of Chain Mail and Ring Mail 247 lived about this time (712-770), alludes in a verse to a "metal-chain cuirass" (kin so kid).1 Chain armor (so-tse kid)2 is distinctly mentioned in the Wan hua ku, a work written at the end of the twelfth century,3 in which are enumerated the designations for thirteen kinds of armor known at that period. Chain armor is there listed as the twelfth in the series; and it is expressly stated that it ranges in the class of iron armor (fie kid). In all probability, however, this passage is taken from the T'ang leu tien (the "Six Statutes of the T'ang Dynasty") drawn up by the Emperor Y?an-tsung in the first part of the eighth century (p. 189); and as the thirteen kinds of armor on record are said to have been made at that time in the Imperial Armory, we may presume that chain mail was turned out by the Chinese as early as the T'ang period, after models first introduced from Samarkand. In the Biography of Han Shi-chung, who died in 115t,4 a "chain connected armor" (lien so kid) capable of resisting bows is credited to this general;5 but it would seem that this newly-coined term does not refer to a real chain mail, but rather to ring mail, in which rows of iron rings are fastened to a foundation of leather (see p. 252). According to the testimony of William of Rubruck, chain mail, which he styles haubergeon, was known to the Mongols.6 In the year 1345, during the reign of the Emperor Shun, Djanibeg (1342-1356), son of Uzbeg,7 sent to China, among other products, swords, bows, and chain mail coming from Egypt (Mi-si-rh).8 Chain armor had no official recognition in China, and was never introduced into the army. It is conspicuously absent in the military regulations of the Ming dynasty, nor is it mentioned in the well-informed military work Wu pei chi. We have to go as far down as in the ICien lung period to renew its acquaintance. We meet it there again as a foreign import. In the Imperial State Handbook of the Manchu 1 P*ei win y?nfu, Ch. 50, p. 70 (under so), or Ch. 106, p. 74 (under kid). There is also a quotation given there to the effect that "the finest of armors are designated chain mail," derived from a poetical work Erh lao Vang shi hua, the date of which is unknown to me. 2 Entered in Giles's Dictionary, p. 1264 c, with the same translation. 3 Bretschneider, Botanicon Sinicum, pt. 1, p. 160, No. 330. 4 Giles, Biographical Dictionary, p. 251.

The collar, as ex</page><page sequence="179">History of Chain Mail and Ring Mail 249 plained in the text, is made of white cotton and tied up by means of a cord. Two specimens of chain mail secured in China are represented on Plate XXVI. Both are jackets with sleeves, having a short slit under? neath the neck, and being tied up by means of a leather band. Though identical in appearance, they are of different technique. The shirt of mail shown in Fig. 1 of the Plate consists of riveted steel rings; the one in Fig. 2, of welded iron rings. The former was obtained at Si-ning, Kan-su Province, with the information that it had previously hailed from Tibet; the latter, at Si-ngan, Shen-si Province. These two coats, accordingly, are technically much superior to the one from the Caucasus, in which the rings are merely of twisted iron wire not welded. It is thus clear that there are coats of mail widely varying in the technical process and in quality. To decide the question as to the locality where the two specimens were manufactured would require a larger compara? tive material than is at my disposal. The Tibetans, as will be seen presently, must be discarded as being unable to produce chain mail. The Chinese, as we noticed, may have themselves made it in the T'ang period; it is certain, however, that none is turned out in China at the present time. Altogether, these specimens are scarce; and modern Chinese accomplishments in iron and steel are so crude and inferior, that it is difficult to believe in the Chinese origin of the two pieces of mail. Particularly the mail in Fig. 1 of Plate XXVI represents such a complex and toilsome technicality, involving so great an amount of time and patience as can be credited only to a highly professional and skilful armorer, who was a specialist in this line; the process of riveting steel rings, moreover, is not practised by the Chinese. My personal impression in the matter, therefore, is that the two mails were fabricated in Persia or Turkistan, and thereupon traded to China. An offensive weapon deserves attention in this connection, because a chain is utilized in it, and its invention is ascribed by the Chinese to a foreign tribe. This is the Vie lien kia (No. 113 2) pang, a weapon con? sisting of two wooden cudgels, the one nearly three times the length of the other, their upper ends being connected by an iron chain (Fig. 40). The longer cudgel is round, and is held by its lower end in the hands of the soldier; the shorter one is square in cut, and provided at the end with a sharp iron point intended to hit the enemy's head. The chain allow? ing it ample freedom of motion, it is swung around in a wide circle, thus making it a fierce and powerful weapon. The Wu pei chi, illustrating and describing this instrument (Ch. 104, p. 14), states that its original home was among the Si Jung (the Western Jung), one of the general designations for the Turkish and Tibetan tribes living north-west</page><page sequence="180">250 Chinese Clay Figures m. #fc $ # A % M W- # # *r * &amp; _h m ? ????] tszAs #? fife P5^ 4 3 ft, Fig. 40. * PU114ikc c?v^rr Weapon (from IT?</page><page sequence="181">History of Chain Mail and Ring Mail 251 from China; that they made use of it, while riding on horseback, in fighting Chinese infantry; and that the Chinese soldiers learned to handle it, and are more clever at it than the Jung.

It is still known in Peking under the name of " threshing-flail,'' and is used in fencing. I saw this sport practised in 1902, and at that time secured a specimen for the American Museum, New York. In the time of the Emperor K'ien-lung it was still employed in the Chinese army.1 1 Huang chxao Ii k*i Vu shiy Ch. 15, p. 25 b. According to this work, the weapon is first mentioned in the T%ung tien of Tu Yu, who died in 812, where it is said that it was manipulated by women on the walls to resist invaders. Ti Ts'ing, the famed general in the wars against the western Liao (biography in Sung shi, Ch. 290), who died in 1057, employed it on horseback.</page><page sequence="182">252 Chinese Clay Figures Different from chain mail, though allied to it, is the ring mail. The Wu pei chi, as far as I know, is the only source to inform us of the existence of this type of armor in China (Fig. 41). The cut of this book is here reproduced, not only because it is unique in the representation of this specimen, but also because it is very instructive in showing us again how difficult it is to draw inferences from oriental illustrations as to the real type of armor intended by the artist. Any expert in armor, casting a glance at this sketch furnished by the Ming edition of the Wu pei chi, could voice no other opinion than that it is meant to represent a type of scale armor. But the author, as plainly stated in the heading, means to represent a ring armor made of steel wire; and the description added by him leaves no doubt of this intention. He states that "armor of connected rings wrought from steel wire was formerly made by the Si K?iang, and that the structure of the rings is identical with the large iron wire rings of his time, with openings as big as in a coin; in shape, it is like a sort of shirt, and it is held together above by a collar; it is not open in front, but put on over the head; spears and arrows can hardly ever pierce it and cause wounds." Unfortunately he omits to state what the foundation is to which the rings are fastened; but from the drawing, in which the rings are arranged in overlapping rows, it is necessary to con? clude that they were attached to a solid garment, in the same manner as our ring mail, which consisted of steel rings sewed edgewise upon leather or strong quilted cloth. The name K'iang (No. 1264) mentioned in this text, as is well known, is a general designation for the multitude of ancient Tibetan tribes, at a time when they were still settled in the western parts of Chinese ter? ritory. A. Wylie 1 has translated from the Annals of the Later Han Dynasty the records pertaining to them. They were exterminated by the Han dynasty.2 The Chinese tradition tracing ring mail to Tibetan tribes is significant, though it is not necessary to adopt the opinion that the latter ever really made it. Yet the fact remains that ring mail still occurs among the Tibetans. There is even a Chinese source of the middle of the eighteenth century alluding to it. In the Si-tsang ki (" Records of Tibet "), a small but interesting work on Tibet in two volumes, published in 1751 by Chu KH-tang (Ch. 1, p. 23), three kinds of armor in use among the Tibetan soldiers are enumerated,?the scale armor (liu ye, "willow-leaves"), the ring armor (lien huan, "connected 1 History of the Western Kiang (Revue de VExtrime-Orient, Vol. I, 1883, pp. 424 478). 2 Chav annes, Les Memoires historiques de Se-ma Ts Hen, Vol. Ill, pp. 591, 595; and Trois generaux chinois (T%oung Paof 1906, pp. 256-258).</page><page sequence="183">History of Chain Mail and Ring Mail 253 rings"), and the chain armor (so-tse).1 This naturally carries us to Tibet and its relations to Persia in the matter of chain mail; but before taking leave of China, it should be emphasized that chain mail remains the only type of armor borrowed and imported by her directly from a foreign country. With this exception, the making of armor, though foreign impulses cannot be denied, is purely indigenous, and also Chinese in its essential characteristics. From a negative point of view, its in? dependence from the west is exhibited by several features that are lack? ing in Chinese, but which occur in western armor: as, for instance, the curious nasal (or nose-guard), characteristic of Persian, Indian, and Turkish helmets (Plates XXV and XXVIII); and gauntlets, absent in China, but met in Persia, India, and Japan. The Persians seem to have had relations with Tibet at an early date. In the " Histoire des Rois des Perses," translated (from an Arabic source composed between 1017 and 1021) by H. Zotenberg (p. 434), Alexander the Great is made to undertake an expedition into Tibet, whose king offers him submission and a tribute of a hundred loads of gold and a thousand ounces of musk. The two products of Tibet most eagerly solicited by the Persians are clearly emphasized in this legend. Among the wonders possessed by King Abarwiz figured the "malleable gold" extracted for him from a mine of Tibet (ibid., p. 700); this was a block of gold five hundred grains in weight, flexible like wax; when pressed in one's hand, it passed through the fingers and could be modelled; figures were fash? ioned from it, and it would then assume its former shape again. The Annals of the Sui Dynasty2 have preserved a most interesting account of a country styled Fu, situated over two thousand li north-west of Sze-ch*uan. As I hope to show in detail on a future occasion, the question here is of a Tibetan tribe with a thoroughly Tibetan culture. The particular point that interests us in this connection is that this tribe of Fu possessed helmets and body armors of varnished hide, and that armor played a significant part in its funeral ceremonies. The corpse was placed on a high couch; it was washed, and dressed with helmet and cuirass; and furs were piled upon it. The sons and grand? sons of the dead man, without wailing, donned their cuirasses, and per? formed a sword-dance, while exclaiming, "Our father has been carried away by a demon! Let us avenge this wrong and slay the demon!" 1 As the Tibetans, even less than the Chinese, can be credited with the manufacture of chain mail, and as Tibetan chain mail is plainly stamped as a Persian import, suspicion is ripe that also Tibetan (and consequently Chinese) ring mails are derived from the same source; but strict evidence for the antiquity of ring mail in Ir?n yet remains to be brought forward. 2 Sui shu, Ch. 83, p. 8.</page><page sequence="184">2S4 Chinese Clay Figures This truly was the burial rite of a militant and valiant people, the dead being believed to continue their lives as warriors, and the survivors combating with their arms the demon who was supposed to have swept him away. A similar idea was symbolically expressed on the burial places of the Tibetan heroes, who during the age of the T'ang had fallen in their bitter strifes with the Chinese. As related in the T'ang Annals, white tigers were painted on the red-plastered walls of the buildings belonging to their sepulchral mounds scattered along the upper course of the Yellow River: when alive, they donned a tiger-skin in battle, so the tiger was the emblem of their bravery after death.1 The Tibetans were a warlike nation in the early period of their history, and at times the terror of their neighbors, even of China. The Annals of the T'ang Dynasty,2 which call them T'u-po (Tibetan Bod), and describe at length their relations with the empire from the seventh to the ninth century, praise their armor and helmets as excellent, covering the entire body, and leaving openings for the eyes only;3 so that power? ful bows and sharp swords cannot wound them very much. This pass? age, however brief, allows the inference that Tibetan armor of that period was of iron (for it is designated with the word k'ai, No. 5798); that it was a complete armor with brassards, cuishes, and greaves; and that the helmet was provided with a visor.4 The "gold" armor,5 which King Srong-btsan sgam-po, according to T'ang shu, is said to have transmitted as a gift to the Emperor T'ai-tsung when he wooed the hand of a Chinese princess, is perhaps not to be taken too literally; the word kin may simply mean "metal."6 Among the eastern Tibetan tribes we have proof for the existence of iron armor as early as the sixth century. The Pei shi7 imparts the interesting news that in the first year of the period Pao-ting of the Pei Chou dynasty (561 a.d.) the Pai-lan, a tribe of the K?iang, who in matters of customs and products agreed with the Tang-erTang,8 sent 1 T*oung Pao, 1914, p. 77. 2 T'ang shut Ch. 216 a, p. 1 b. 3 A striking analogy with the Persian helmet as described by Ammianus Mar cellinus (above, p. 240). 4 Presumably of a similar type as the royal Persian helmet figured by J. de Morgan (Mission scientifique en Perse, Vol. IV, p. 320, Paris, 1897). 5 Thus translated by S. W. Bushell, The Early History of Tibet, p. 10 (reprint from Journal Royal Asiatic Society, 1880). 6 A golden (huang kin) armor, referring to the T'ang period, is mentioned in Ming huang tsa lu (Ch. b, p. 2). 7 Ch. 96, p. 9 b. 8 Regarding these tribes compare S. W. Bushell (The Early History of Tibet, p. gj.), and W. W. Rockhill (The Land of the Lamas, p. 337). Tibetan armor has not infrequently been sent to China; specimens are preserved, and may still be seen</page><page sequence="185">History of Chain Mail and Ring Mail 255 envoys with a tribute of cuirasses made from rhinoceros-hide (si kid) and iron armor (fie kKa%). There is a somewhat vague Tibetan tradition relative to the period of the early legendary kings, to the effect that armor was first introduced into central Tibet from Lower K'ams (Mar K'ams) in the eastern part of the country.1 It is difficult to decide as to what type of armor is to be understood in this passage, in which occurs the general word k*rab, the original meaning of which, as we tried to show (p. 195),2 must have been "scale armor." It may be permissible to think, in this case, of a style of hide armor, as it was in vogue among the Fu and the neighboring Shan and Man; but the tradition which here crops out is somewhat weak and hazy. Coats of mail are frequently alluded to in Tibetan epic literature and historical records. In the History of the Kings of Lad?kh they are mentioned under the reign of the seventeenth king, bLo-gros C'og-ldan, as being brought from Guge, eighteen in number; the most excellent of them receiving individual names, as was the case also with swords, saddles, turquoises, and other precious objects.3 The usual types of armor in Lad?kh were chain or scale armor. The fact that they are recorded as coming from Guge is significant, for Guge must have had ancient relations with Persia;4 and the chain mail of Guge was most probably of Persian origin. The plain fact remains that the Tibetan blacksmiths do not turn out iron chain mail, nor are they capable of making it; so that they are most unlikely ever to have made it at any earlier time. The supposition of an import is therefore the only solu? tion of the problem. The Wei Tsang fu chi, a description of Tibet by Ma Shao-y?n and Mei Si-sh&amp;ng written in 1792, has the following note on the outfits of in many Lama temples. The Ming shi tells of a tribute of armor, swords, and products sent in 1374 by the country of Ngan-ting in the territory of the Kuku-n?r, which was classified among the Si Fan (Bretschneider, China Review, Vol. V, p. 32). 1 Chandra Das, in Journal Asiatic Society of Bengal, 1881, pt. 1, p. 214. 2 B. Houghton (Outlines of Tibeto-Burman Linguistic Palaeontology, Journal Royal Asiatic Society, 1896, p. 41), in pointing out the coincidence of Tibetan k'rab and Burmese klyap, remarks that each word denotes originally a flat, thin thing or scale, and that hence they come to mean scale armor. "It is, of course, possible," he adds, "that this was possessed by the Burmans in Tibet, but on the other hand it is equally probable that the words have been applied independently on the introduc? tion of this particular kind of armor, (? from China)." This view seems forced. The words k%rab and k'yap are not loan-words from Chinese, but on equal footing with Chinese kia and kiai, and speak in favor of scale armor having been a very ancient means of defence in the Indo-Chinese group of peoples. 3 Compare Marx, in Journal Asiatic Society of Bengal, Vol. LX, pt. 1, 1891, pp. 122,123. Also among the ancient Arabs, excellent armors were named (Schwarz lose, Die Waffen der alten Araber, p. 69). 4 Laufer, Toung Pao, 1908, p. 13.</page><page sequence="186">256 Chinese Clay Figures the Tibetan army of that time:1 " When the troops go on an expedition, they wear armor consisting of helmets and cuirasses. The latter are made of iron scales2 or of chains. On the helmet of the cavalry is attached a red crest or a peacock-feather. From their waist hangs a sword, on their back is slung a gun, and in their hand they carry a pike. On the infantry helmet is a cock's feather. They have hanging to their waist a sword, without counting a dirk. Under their arm is a bow and arrow, and in their hand a buckler of rattan or wood. Some also bear a pike in their hand. Their wooden bucklers measure one foot six inches across, and three feet one or two inches in length, and are painted with pictures of tigers, and ornamented with different-colored feathers;3 outside they are covered with sheet iron." If the assumption is correct that Tibetan chain mail is Persian in origin, the scale armor would remain to be looked upon as the national body armor of Tibet, at least as the older type which preceded the in? troduction of chain mail.4 In former times, it seems to me, the latter was traded over a direct route from Persia into Guge in western Tibet, on the same path along which religious ideas of the Zoroastrians poured in and exerted a deep influence on the shaping of the Tibetan Bon re? ligion, while during the last centuries northern India became the mart which supplied Tibet with this much-craved article. The Tibetan and Persian relations in matters of arms are expressed also by the identity of the Tibetan and old-Persian sword. Indeed, the Tibetan sword, as still in use at present, is the same as that re 1 Rockhill, Journal Royal Asiatic Society, 1891, p. 215. 2 Mr. Rockhill has, "made of linked willow-leaf (shaped iron plates)." But the expression liu ye ("willow-leaf"), as we see from the regulations of the Ming dynasty, refers to scale armor, not to plate armor. Mr. Waddell (Lhasa and its Mysteries, p. 168) speaks of cuirasses consisting of small, narrow, willow-like leaves about an inch and a half long, threaded with leather thongs, still worn by Tibetan soldiers, a few of whom also wear coats of chain mail. The Chinese physician Dr. Shaoching H. Chuan, who visited Lhasa with the Chinese Mission to Tibet in 1906 1907 has written a very interesting and well-illustrated article on Lhasa under the title The Most Extraordinary City in the World (Nat. Geogr. Mag., 1912, pp. 959 995); on pp. 978 and 980 are good illustrations of Tibetan soldiers wearing chain mail. 3 In the Tower Armory there is a shield of the Angami-Naga, faced with bear? skin, the side ornamented with tufts of feathers (Hewitt, Official Catalogue of the Tower Armories, p. 100). Compare p. 210. 4 In ancient India, likewise, scale armor seems to represent the older type. The Qukraniti describes solely this type of armor by saying that "armor consists of scales of the breadth of a grain of wheat, is of metal and firm, has a protection for the head, and is ornamented on the upper part of the body " (G. Oppert, On the Weapons, Army Organization, and Political Maxims of the Ancient Hindus, p. 109, Madras, 1880). A suit of Tibetan scale armor is illustrated by A. Georgi (Alphabetum Tibetanum, Rome, 1762, Plate IV) in the figure of a shaman, entitled cio kion (that is, c%os skyong, "protector of religion").</page><page sequence="187">History or Chain Mail and Ring Mail 257 constructed by J. de Morgan1 after a bas-relief of Takht-i-Bost?n, both in its shape and in the style of its decoration, for which inlaid stones were employed. The history of the sword, however, is somewhat dif? ferent from that of chain armor, and is not connected with an importa? tion of swords from Persia into Tibet. The swords of the Turkish tribes of Central Asia, to which the Tibetan swords are related, must be taken equally into consideration; and it seems that this type of sword is a common property of the whole group, of such great antiquity that the accurate history of its distribution can no longer be traced.2 The Tibetans make (or rather, made) use also of the circular and convex rhinoceros-hide shield of Indian manufacture, ornamented with four brass bosses (Plate XXVII, Fig. i).3 This shield is employed like? wise in Burma and Siam. The national Tibetan shield is made from rattan plaited in the basketry style of circular coils (Plate XXVII, Fig. 2). Of what type the shield of the ancient Tibetans (K'iang), adopted by the Chinese, was (p. 188), we do not know. Also the Tibetan helmet (Plate XXVIII), composed of steel sheets incrusted with gold and silver wire, forming floral designs, and with attached coif of mail and sliding nasal, is of Indo-Persian origin (com? pare Plate XXV). 1 Mission scientifique en Perse, Vol. IV, p. 321 (Paris, 1897). Compare this volume, p. 15. 2 The swords represented on the monuments of Turkistan belong to the same type (see A. Gr?nwedel, Altbuddhistische Kultst?tten, pp. 26, 27, and many other examples). 8 For Indian specimens see W. Egerton, An Illustrated Handbook of Indian Arms, pp. 95, in, 118, 134 (London, 1880).

THE PROBLEM OF PLATE ARMOR "The skilful leader subdues the enemy's troops without any fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field. With his forces intact he will dis? pute the mastery of the Empire, and thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete." Sun-tse, Art of War (translation of Lionel Giles). We had occasion to allude to plate armor1 in the chapter on defensive armor of the Han period, stating that in all probability it existed in the China of those days; we referred also to its possible occurrence among the armor worn by the cataphracti of the ancients, and figured a Siberian petroglyph from the Yenisei representing a mounted lancer clad with such mail. We now propose to discuss this problem in detail,? a problem of fundamental historical importance, as it reveals ancient relations between many peoples of Asia, and touches also the question as to the connection of Asiatic with American cultures. Classical and other archaeologists have not yet ventilated this problem, apparently for the only reason that they did not sharply enough discriminate between the various types of body armor. "Scale armor" was the catchword under which everything of this sort was pressed together.2 But plate armor must be strictly differentiated from scale armor as a special type, which sprang up independently. The laminae forming plate armor are rectangular and flat, and mutually lashed together; and in the same manner the parallel horizontal rows are connected one with another. Such connection is absent in scale armor, in which each scale is individ? ually treated and attached to a background; the background is in this case a necessity, while in plate armor it is dispensable. The laminas of scale armor are arranged like roofing-tiles or the scales of a fish, one placed above another; while in plate armor the laminae, as a rule, are disposed one beside another, or but slightly overlapping. Plate 1 The word1 'plate armor'' is used here throughout in the sense adopted by American ethnologists, ? armor consisting of horizontal rows of narrow, rectangular laminae (regardless of the material), the single laminae or plates being mutually lashed to? gether by means of thongs, and the various rows being connected in a similar man? ner. Students of European armor usually take the term "plate armor" to designate armor composed of large sheets of metal closely enveloping chest and back. This type is here styled "sheet armor." 2 In England, plate armor is usually styled1 'scale armor." E.H. Minns (Scythians and Greeks, p. 74, Cambridge, 1913), for instance, speaks of "a system of thongs plaited and intertwined as in Japanese and Tibetan scale armor." This, of course, is plate armor; scales are never intertwined. 258</page><page sequence="189">The Problem of Plate Armor 259 armor is more flexible and lighter in weight, and hence recommended itself to all nations who became acquainted with it. Plate armor can be easily donned over or beneath any garment, and does away with the uncomfortable leather jerkin. For this reason it proved the most fa? vorite and enduring type of armor in China. It was capable of develop? ment and refinement, while scale armor always remained stationary. It is the ethnologists who were the first to place us on the track of this subject; and there are chiefly two scholars, Friedrich Ratzel and Walter Hough, who took the leadership in this research. Our best course will therefore be to begin by reviewing their studies of the subject, and then to see how their results compare with the new material now at our disposal. Friedrich Ratzel1 was the first to make a thorough investigation of the geographical dissemination of plate armor, as far as the material was accessible in his time (1886), among the tribes of north-western America and the Chukchi, also on the Society, Austral, and Gilbert Islands in the South Sea. He was particularly struck by the observa? tion that such armor was lacking in other parts of the world, and that its appearance in the Arctic regions was out of proportion to the general poverty of culture there prevailing. The belief in its independent existence among these peoples conflicted with his axiom that the in? dolence of inventive power is a fundamental law of the primitive stages of ethnic life. In order to explain the phenomenon of plate armor, Ratzel had recourse to Japan, where he deemed armor had reached its greatest development,2 and where the threads of ancient tribal connec? tions indicated by these peculiar productions ran together; and he believed in a direct contact between Japan and the north-west coast of America in the distribution of plate armor, to the exclusion of the Asiatic Continent. Although the result of this investigation is seemingly historical, the methods and the point of view pursued are purely geo? graphical; and an historical mind cannot fail to notice the weak points of this argumentation. The existence of plate armor in Japan, for in? stance, is merely accepted as a fact given in space, without inquiry into its historical foundation and development, and without the knowl? edge of corresponding objects in China and other parts of Asia being much older. 1 ?ber die St?bchenpanzer und ihre Verbreitung im nordpazifischen Gebiet (Sitzungsberichte der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1886, pp. 181-216; 3 plates). 2 H. Schurtz (Urgeschichte der Kultur, p. 355) has adopted the opposite point of view, and interprets that the curious plate armor characteristic of the peoples of the Bering Sea has served as model for the Japanese armor made from lacquered pieces of leather, as certain traditional decorations in the former also seem to prove. This opinion is out of the question, for technical and historical reasons.</page><page sequence="190">2?O Chinese Clay Figures Walter Hough, in his intensely interesting and valuable study "Primitive American Armor,"1 arrives, after a careful survey of the subject, at the conclusion that "plate armor in America is a clear case of the migration of invention, its congeners having been traced from Japan northeastward through the Ainu, Gilyak,2 and Chukchi, across Bering Strait by the intervening islands to the western Eskimo. Here the armor spread southward from the narrowest part of the strait, passing into the slat armor of the North-west Coast, which is possibly a development of the plate idea. The plate armor also may have spread to the eastern coast of North America. Hence, it appears to be con 1 Report of the U. S. National Museum for 1893, pp. 625-651 (Washington, 1895; 22 plates). 2 This is a debatable point. J. Batchelor (The Ainu of Japan, p. 287, London, 1892) says, "The Ainu also wore armor in their wars; but it was of a very light kind, consisting entirely of leather. Some of them, however, wore Japanese armor which they took from the dead in warfare. This is also one way in which they came by their swords and spears." It seems quite certain that the Ainu have never made any plate armor; and what is found among them of this class is plainly derived from the Japanese. Nor can the Gilyak be credited with plate armor. The only specimen of iron plate armor ever discovered in this tribe, and figured and described by L. v. Schrenck (Reisen und Forschungen im Amur-Lande, Vol. III, p. 573), is, as Schrenck says, of Manchu origin; and he adds expressly that the iron armors, according to the unanimous statement of the Gilyak, originate from the Manchu. Dr. Hough, who has reproduced Schrenck's drawing of the helmet and of a piece of the armor, seems to have overlooked the description in Schrenck's text, though also on the plate the attribute "old Manchu" is added to both specimens, in contradistinction to the indigenous real Gilyak armor coat plaited from fibre. The Gilyak, therefore, cannot be cited, as Dr. Hough has done, as a stepping-stone in the migration of plate armor from Japan to the Eskimo. Also Mr. Bogoras (The Chukchee, Jesup North Pacific Expedition, Vol. VII, p. 164), whose exactness and carefulness is other? wise deserving of the highest praise, has fallen into the same error by reproducing and describing Schrenck's drawing as "Gilyak armor," without paying attention to Schrenck's text. If, therefore, the statement of Bogoras should be correct, ? that the shape of the plates, and the manner of connecting them, in an iron armor of the Chukchi, are quite similar to those observed on the remnants of this "Gilyak armor," ? this would seem to say that the Chukchi armor in question would have to be con? nected with Chinese, and not with Japanese culture, as Mr. Bogoras is tempted to believe; it will be seen on the following pages that other weighty reasons militate strongly against this Japanese theory. Schrenck, beyond any doubt, is correct in his statement; and his result agrees with my own inquiries among the Gilyak for armor, and also with my study of Chinese armor. ^ Only Schrenck's definition of "Manchu" must be modified into "Chinese." This error is excusable, as any in? vestigation of Chinese armor had not been made in his time. The Manchu can? not be credited with any original invention in the matter of armor: they adopted it, like so many other things, from the Chinese; and it can be shown step by step, substantiated by official documents, that the Manchu, as in numerous ot^her matters, have also faithfully copied the military equipment established by the Ming dynasty. There is no Manchu type of armor which has not yet existed in, and could not be derived from, the Ming period. Schrenck's Gilyak armor, accordingly, is plainly a modern Chinese specimen, that must forfeit any claim to the historical utilization, to which it has been submitted; it cannot be brought into relation with Japan, nor with the Chukchi, nor with the Eskimo. This ethnographical continuity asserted by Hough cannot be proved, nor does it in fact exist. Ratzel (L c, p. 214) had just? ly emphasized the entire lack of plate armor among the peoples of Yezo, Saghalin, and the adjacent mainland. Thus the Japanese theories of Ratzel and Hough, though reaching the same end, materially differ in point of construction.</page><page sequence="191">The Problem of Plate Armor 261 elusive that plate armor in America had Asiatic origin." On p. 633 Dr. Hough states as follows: "The hoop or band armor mentioned as type 4 is found only on the Siberian side of this area and, as well as the plate armor, recalls well-known forms in Japan. This hoop armor is interesting as showing the reproduction of plate armor types in skin, being made of horizontal bands of sealskin instead of rows of ivory plates, the rings telescoping together when the armor is not in use." In describing Eskimo armor made of five imbricating rows of plates of walrus ivory, Dr. Hough observes that in the form, lashing, and ad? justment of the plates it is identical with certain types of Japanese armor.1 His conclusions are the more remarkable, as the previous investigation of Ratzel was unknown to him, and his result has apparent? ly been attained independently. We are here confronted with the interesting case that two ethnographers of high standing have made a notable and praiseworthy attempt to apply an historical point of view to a purely ethnographical situation, with a result so tempting and seemingly convincing that some of the best representatives of our science have readily accepted it.2 But in the light of a plain historical fact, the position taken by Ratzel and Hough in this question becomes untenable.3 1 Compare also Hough (American Anthropologist, Vol. XIV, 1912, p. 40). 2 Bogoras (/. c.f p. 162), for instance, seems to accept Hough's results; the Chukchi hoop armor is, to him, "evidently an imitation in skin of plate armor" (repeated after Hough, p. 633). R. Andree (Globus, Vol. 69, 1896, p. 82) acceded to the theory of Hough. 3 This case well illustrates the difficulty of historical reconstructions built ex? clusively on the basis of observed data of purely geographical and ethnographical character. As soon as the light of authenticated historical facts is obtained, our preconceived assumptions and conclusions will always be subject to considerable modifications. In my opinion it is therefore impossible to elaborate with assured results historical reconstructions founded on purely ethnological data. Our mind, owing to our scientific training, can evolve only a logical sequence of thoughts, and interpret given data in a highly logical manner only; but history itself is not logical; on the contrary, it is irrational and erratic, moving in zigzag lines, like lightning; it is a labyrinth of dark passages running in all directions; and, above all, it is more imaginative than the boldest flight of our fancy could possibly be. The unexpected, the unforeseen, has always happened; and this is what cannot be supplied or supple? mented by the logic of our rational mind. Reconstructions certainly are justifiable and should be attempted, but must never be taken as a substitute for history, or even as real history; they will always remain more or less subjective and problemat? ical, and may be of value as a working hypothesis. It should never be forgotten, however, that the subjective criterion of conceivableness or plausibility, or of an appeal to our common sense, will but seldom prove before historical facts. The rule may even be laid down that whatever may appear to our conception as quite natural, self-evident, or logical, may hardly ever have happened that way, or need not have happened that way, but otherwise. Our knowledge of most subjects is still too meagre to allow at the present time of culture-historical reconstructions embracing a wide area of the globe. To these belongs also the theme of plate armor, the specific history of which must first be traced in the single culture zones where it occurs, before its general history can be built up with any encouraging result.

They were the Vikings of the East, raiding on several occasions the coasts of northern Japan, and fighting many a sea-battle with the Japanese in the seventh century.1 For a thou? sand years prior to that time, the Chinese were acquainted with this tribe and its peculiar culture: even Confucius is said to have been posted in regard to them, and to have been aware of the fact that they availed themselves of flint arrowheads, usually poisoned, which were then preserved as curiosities in the royal treasury of China. From Chinese records we can establish the fact that the Su-shen lived through a stone age for at least fifteen hundred years down to the middle ages, when they became merged in the great flood of roaming Tungusian tribes. They had also stone axes, which played a role in their religious worship. A mere supposition is that they belonged to the Tungusian stock of peoples; yet this remains to be ascertained. They may as well have been related to one of the numerous groups of tribes occupying ancient Korea, or, which is still more likely, to the so-called Palse Asiatic tribes of the North-Pacific region; but the whole ancient eth? nology of north-eastern Asia remains as yet to be investigated. Under the year 262 a.d. it is on record in the Annals of the Three Kingdoms2 that the Su-shen presented to the Court of China a tribute of a mixed lot of harness, altogether twenty pieces, including armor made of leather or hide, of bone, and of iron, with the addition of four hundred sable-skins.3 On the iron armor, which was foreign to the culture of the certainly is not by any means so rigidly restricted as assumed by Ratzel and Hough;, it will be seen that it takes its place in China, western Asia, ancient Siberia and Turkistan, where it is assuredly much older than in Japan. 1 Compare Jade, p. 59. The Han Annals state that the Yi-lou, another name for the Su-shen, were fond of making piratical raids in boats; the Wo-tsu settled in the north-eastern part of Korea, and bordering in the south on that tribe, "dreaded it so much that every summer they were wont to hide in the precipitous caves until winter, when navigation was impossible, at which time they came down to occupy their settlements " (E. H. Parker, Transactions Asiatic Society of Japan, Vol. XVIII, 1890, p. 201). In the same study of Parker (pp. 173 et seq.) a history of the Su-sh&amp;i will be found. 2 San kuo chi, Wei chi, Ch. 4, p. 13 a (compare T'oung Pao, 1913, p. 347). 31 am inclined to understand this passage in the sense that there were three dis? tinct kinds of armor, made entirely either of leather, or of bone, or of iron. It is impossible to presume that bone was used in connection with iron in the make-up of one and the same suit of armor. The iron armor, we are forced to conclude, must have formed an individual type in itself, and assuredly one alien to the culture of the Su-sh?n, who, we know with certainty, were not acquainted with the technique of metals for an extended period, and availed themselves of flint arrowheads. Before going to press, I notice from the work of R. and K. Torii (St?des archeologiques,,</page><page sequence="193">The Problem of Plate Armor 263 Su-sMn, I shall comment later. Hide armor and bone armor formed the national harness of the Su-sMn, as we may infer from another memorable passage in the Annals of the Tsin Dynasty1 relating to the period 265-419 a.D., where the characteristic arms of the tribe are enumerated as wooden bows, stone crossbows, hide and bone armor.2 It is remarkable that the Chinese do not ascribe bone armor to any other of the numerous tribes, with whom they became familiar during their long history, and whose culture they have described to us. In all likelihood, the term "bone armor" occurs in their records only in those two passages; and it is not at all ambiguous. There is but one thing that can be understood by it, ? the well-known type of bone armor, as it still occurs among the tribes occupying the northern shores of the Pacific on the Asiatic and American sides, particularly among the Chukchi and Eskimo, and in that region exclusively.3 The Eskimo ivory plate armor represented on Plate XXIX will give some idea of what the Su-shen Journal of the College of Science, Vol. 36, T?ky?, March 29, 1914, p. 73), which has just reached me, that the two Japanese authors understand this passage in exactly the same sense. 1 Tsin shu (compiled under the T'ang dynasty by Fang K'iao and others), Ch. 97, p. 2 b. 2 The question in this passage, accordingly, is of the armor, offensive and de? fensive, possessed and made by the Su-shem in the beginning of the middle ages. Hide and bone armor are attributed to them, while iron armor is not mentioned. The text might be construed to mean that the Su-sh&amp;n possessed but a single type of armor, composed of both bone and leather; that is, plates of bone lashed together by means of hide thongs; bone armor is unthinkable without such a ligament, but this consideration need not preclude the assumption that the Su-shen fabricated also pure hide armor. The ethnographical fact that in the culture-area to which this tribe belonged hide and bone armor still occur side by side, must be equally considered in this question; and for this reason we may well understand the passage of the Tsin Annals in the sense that the Su-sh?n had hide or leather armor, and bone armor. But this point of view is of minor importance. The same passage in the Tsin shu indicates a tribute sent by the Su-sh?n toward the end of the period King-yuan (260-264) and consisting of arrows, stone crossbows, armor, and sable-skins. What kind of armor it was on this occasion is not specified; but the general word kia refers to a hide armor or cuirass. J. Klaproth (Tableaux historiques de l'Asie, p. 85) attributes "cuirasses made from skin and covered with bone" to the Yi-lou; the latter are identical with the Su-sh?n, and the text from which Klaproth translated must be the same as that of the Tsin shu referred to above. The text relative to the Yi-lou inserted in Hou Han shu (Ch. 115, p. 2 b) makes no allusion whatever to armor, but I am not inclined to infer from this silence that the Yi-lou or Su-shen lacked armor in the Han period. 3 As stated by me in T'oung Pao (1913, p. 349), the plates of this bone armor were presumably carved from walrus ivory, in the same manner as in the present Eskimo and Chukchi plate armor. Dr. W. Hough of the U. S. National Museum in Washington, to whom I addressed the question as to whether ivory or ordinary bone was utilized to a larger extent in these pieces has been good enough to write me as follows: "The Eskimo armor in the Museum and such suits as I have seen are mostly made of walrus ivory, and so far as I can remember, there are no combinations of ivory and bone in the same piece. On the other hand, there are fragmentary parts of armor from St. Lawrence Island and from the Alaskan mainland which are made of bone; just what bone I cannot say, probably the whale."</page><page sequence="194">2 64 Chinese Clay Figures tribute armor was like.1 The point here at issue, then, is the fact that the entry of the Chinese annalist, under the year 262, regarding the presentation of bone armor on the part of the Su-sh&amp;n, is the earliest recorded reference to bone armor in history, capable of throwing a flashlight on events in the North-Pacific culture area, so glaringly devoid of any records. The date 262 is of far-reaching consequence. Certainly, like all dates where inventions or culture ideas are involved, it is a mere symbol, that requires a certain latitude in its translation. The tribute of 262 indicates that bone armor had been made prior to that date by the Su-sMn, or generally within the culture-zone to which they belonged; and since complex inventions of such character require time to mature, and the laborious efforts of several generations, it is justifiable and reasonable to conclude that the beginnings of the invention go back to a far earlier period. Plate armor of bone must therefore be infinitely older than could heretofore be supposed from the mere circumstantial evidence of present geographical distribution; and it follows also that the geographic area of bone armor must have been much more extended in ancient times, and reached farther south along the shores of Asia. In other words, the culture area under consideration, as it now presents itself to our eyes, must have occupied a larger territory in the times of which we speak,? a conclusion confirmed to me also by other reasons; and the Su-sh&amp;n must have either ranged among the representatives of North-Pacific culture, or have been strongly influenced by it. If as early as 262 the Su-sh&amp;n were in possession of bone plate armor, this type of harness cannot be explained as having been made in imitation of Japanese plate armor ? for the plain reason that Japanese plate armor was at that time not in existence. Metal armor in Japan cannot be pointed out before the close of the eighth century. Fragments of armor consisting of scales of bronze incrusted with gold, and preserved in the Museum of Tokyo, are assigned to about the year 800 a.d. by Basheord Dean,2 our great authority on Japanese armor; while frag? ments of iron plate armor are not older than about 1050 and 1100; that 1 The number of perforations in the plates is not always six, as in the specimen illustrated. A large number of detached Eskimo ivory plates in the Field Museum (Cat. No. 34,154) exhibits on ah average twelve perforations, two and two being close together. Sometimes a third perforation is added to the two in the corners, and some? times an additional perforation is drilled through the centre of the upper or lower side. A very interesting specimen in our collection (Cat. No. 34,153) is a pair of Eskimo cuisses (leg-guards) of mastodon ivory, 16.5 cm long, with rows of perforations along the top and bottom edges. These objects were obtained by A. M. Baber from the Asiatic Eskimo on the Tchukotsk Peninsula. 2 Catalogue of the Loan Collection of Japanese Armor, pp. 20, 28 (New York, 1903).</page><page sequence="195">The Problem of Plate Armor 265 is, they belong to the latter part of the Fuji war a period (900-1100). Before this time, padded coats and hide cuirasses were the usual means of body protection; the latter sometimes assumed the form of scale armor, the scales being cut out of pieces of boiled leather.1 The Chinese Annals of the Sui Dynasty,2 in the interesting account on Japan, state that the Japanese (Wo) make armor of varnished leather (tsi pH wei kid) and arrows of bone. At that time, which, from the standpoint of Japanese development, is designated as the protohistoric or semihistoric period, defensive armor cannot have played any signifi? cant r?le in ancient Japan, as it is conspicuously absent in her two oldest records, the K?jiki (composed in 712 a.d.) and the Nihongi (720 a.d.).3 In the year 780 an order was issued by the government that leather ar? mor should be used, because the kind hitherto worn (that is, padded coats) was continually requiring repair. This order permitted, further, the use of iron instead of leather, and advised that all armor should be gradually changed to metal.4 It is therefore clear that at the time, when our Su-shen account of bone armor' is at stake, the Japanese did not possess any metal or any plate armor, and that it is even question? able whether they then availed themselves of defensive armor at all. We are hence prompted to the conclusion that bone plate armor, being at least from six to eight hundred years older than Japanese plate armor, cannot have been made as a reproduction of the latter, and that Japan cannot be made responsible for it. Thus the whole theory of a con? nection of American and Northeast-Asiatic plate armor with Japan must naturally collapse. If the opinion should be correct of those who believe that American Asiatic plate armor must have been made in imitation of a form of iron 1 Catalogue of the Loan Collection of Japanese Armor, p. 38 (New York, 1903). According to W. Gowland (The Dolmens and Burial Mounds in Japan, p. 47, Westminster, 1897), no bronze armor has as yet been found in the dolmens of Japan; and iron armor, too, is by no means of very common occurrence. 2 Sui shuy Ch. 81, p. 6 b (also Pei shi, Ch. 94, p. 72). It is notable that the account of Japan in the Annals of the Later Han Dynasty (Ch. 115, p. 5 b) makes no mention of body armor, but points out only the shield and the use of offensive weapons, such as spear, wooden bow, and arrows with bamboo shafts and bone heads. Arrows with iron heads employed in Japan are first reported in Tsin shu (Ch. 97, p. 3). 3 O. Nachod, Geschichte von Japan, Vol. I, p. 155 (Gotha, 1906). But shields are several times mentioned as offerings. The Annals of the Later Han Dynasty, as pointed out, confirm the existence of shields. The idea generally entertained that Japan has had a bronze and an iron age, in my opinion, is erroneous. The bronze and iron objects found in the ancient graves have simply been imported from the mainland, and plainly are, in the majority of cases, of Chinese manufacture. Many of these, like metal mirrors, certain helmets and others, have been recognized as such; but through comparison with corresponding Chinese material, the same can be proved for the rest. Ancient bronze objects are so scarce in Japan that, even granted they were indigenous, the establishment of a "bronze age" would not be justified, nor is there in the ancient records any positive evidence of the use of bronze. 4 Bashford Dean, /. c, p. 27.</page><page sequence="196">266 Chinese Clay Figures armor, two other theoretical considerations could be advanced. There remain the Chinese and the ancient Turks of Siberia and Central Asia; and it might be argued that Chinese or Siberian harness of iron plate could have furnished a suitable model for the Arctic harness-maker. To such a point of view, however, serious objections could be raised; and here again, first of all, on purely historical grounds. The utiliza? tion of iron in the making of armor, as we noticed in Chapter III, does not become apparent in ancient China till as late as the first cen? turies of our era, its beginnings being justly laid by the Chinese in the period of the Later Han dynasty (25-220 a.D.; see p. 210), and thus it appears from inward evidence. This primeval iron armor, in all likelihood, was not yet a true iron plate armor, but merely a hide cuirass reinforced by iron laminae; rectangular iron plates may have then existed, but the matter is still problematical. Even presuming that iron plate armor might have obtained during the epoch of the Later Han, for which there is as yet no positive evidence, we should be forced to infer that the developments of the ancient Chinese iron armor and the northern bone armor, in this case, have necessarily been contem? poraneous events. The tribute of the Su-sh?n bone armor in 262 a.D. is separated from the closing year of the Han period in 220 a.d. only by the brief span of forty-two years; that is, the average duration of a generation. If, accordingly, these two developments should have run parallel to each other in point of time in two widely different culture areas which otherwise had not a single point in common, the inference would have to be drawn that these two developments have taken place independently, and may have each been prompted by factors coming from a different quarter. In the present state of our knowledge it is safe to assume that bone armor in north-eastern Asia is as old as, or even older than, any iron plate armor in China or Korea. If an outward impetus to the making of bone armor in that region must be assumed, I am disposed to believe that it came from the interior of Siberia.1 In regard to ancient Siberian armor, our information is exceedingly scanty. Only traces of plates of armor have been dis? covered in graves on the Berel,2 and a famous petroglyph on the Yenisei depicts to us a horseman armed with lance and mail-clad (Fig. 35). The long continuity of the iron age in Siberia renders it impossible at 1 For evidence see below, p. 274. 2 W. Radloff, Aus Sibirien, Vol. II, p. 130. Also in Siberia iron armor may have formed the exception, while hide, as the cheaper material, always maintained its place. Marco Polo (ed. of Yule and Cordier, Vol. I, p. 260) says concerning the Tartar (that is, Mongol) customs of war, "On their backs they wear armor of cuirbouly [boiled leather], prepared from buffalo and other hides, which is very strong."</page><page sequence="197">The Problem of Plate Armor 267 the present time to fix a date for these antiquities with any degree of certainty; but a general deduction may be hazarded. There are good reasons for assuming that the Chinese derived their iron armor from Turkish and Iranian peoples,? first, because their knowledge of smelt? ing and forging iron came from them; and, second, because their own inventiveness in defensive and offensive armor was rather poor, and be? cause others of their weapons, like swords and daggers, were adopted from the same group (p. 215). The sudden appearance of iron armor in the Later Han dynasty speaks in favor of this view; and as only copper plate armor was known in the preceding period of the Former Han dynasty, it seems very likely that iron armor among the Turkish tribes was not much older than in China. As previously stated, the Su-sh?n sent iron armor along with skin and bone armor to China, but only the latter two types formed their national armor, according to the later re? port of the Annals of the Tsin Dynasty. The occasional introduction of iron armor, consequently, did not suppress among them the employment of skin and bone armor; and although iron armor was known to them at ?he end of the third century, they adhered, for several centuries down? ward, to bone and hide, that seem to have represented a more efficient means of defence at that time than iron armor, the making of which must still have been in a primitive and experimental stage. On the other hand, in opposition to this theory of a foreign influence, it must be emphasized that the culture types of north-eastern Asia, on the whole, have strong and pronounced characteristics which have hardly any parallels in the rest of the Asiatic world, and that owing to geograph? ical conditions the entire area has remained purer and more intact from outside currents than any other culture group in Asia. The profound researches of Bogoras and Jochelson have shown us that in language, folk-lore, religion, and material culture, the affinities of the Chukchi, Koryak, Yukagir, and Kamchadal go with Americans, not with Asiatics. In fact, Turkish-Mongol influence on these tribes is exceedingly small; Chinese influence, if any, amounts to a minimum;1 and the alleged Japa 1 While the Chinese, owing to political circumstances, were comparatively well acquainted with the tribes inhabiting Manchuria, Korea, and the Amur region, their knowledge of the tribes beyond has always been very limited. Their first acquaint? ance with the Ainu dates from the year 659 a.d., when some members of this tribe accompanying a Japanese embassy made their appearance at the Court of the Emperor Kao-tsung (650-683) of the T'ang dynasty; they are described on this occasion as "forming a small country on an island in the ocean, having beards four feet long, being clever archers, and sticking arrows through their hair; they have a man hold an arrow (according to another reading, a vessel) which they use as a tar? get at a distance of ten paces, without missing their aim" (T'ang shu, Ch. 220, p. 11; and Yen kien lei han, Ch. 231, p. 47). They are called by their Japanese name Yemishi (Chinese, Hia-i). This embassy is mentioned under the same year also in the Japanese Nihongi (Aston, Nihongi, Vol. II, p. 260), where it is said that the</page><page sequence="198">268 Chinese Clay Figures nese influence is a chimera. Plate armor, if due in that region to a stimulus received from outside, would represent a somewhat isolated instance of historical contact in the line of warfare;1 and whatever the psychology of this first stimulus may have been, ? I venture to deny that it ever operated in the haphazard and purely external manner indicated by Ratzel and Hough,?a certain independent course of development in that area cannot be absolutely denied. While I am very far from contesting that historical interrelations may have been at play in the dissemination of the plate idea in north? eastern Asia, I wish to maintain for the present an attitude of reserve toward this point. The downright failure of the Japanese hypothesis should put us on our guard; and, the imitation theory, I confess, be it formulated with reference to the Japanese, Chinese, or Siberians, does not strike me very favorably. Whatever we may now be inclined to assume in that direction, it will remain mere assumption in our present state of knowledge; and it must be upheld that no imitation theory, with whatever modifications, can be backed up by certain facts. In other words, the problem is not yet susceptible of a definite solution. There is, however, not only an historical, but also a technical side to this question, and we should not entirely lose sight of the technical point. We observe in various culture-groups that plate armor is never a primary type of armor, but occupies a secondary place in point of Japanese took with them a Yemishi man and woman of Michinoku to show to the T'ang Emperor. In the Description of the Tributary Nations of the Ts'ing Dynasty {Huang TsHng chi kung Vu, Ch. 3), published under the patronage of the Emperor K'ien-lung, the Ainu are figured and briefly characterized under the name K'u-ye. This is the Gilyak designation Kuhi for the Ainu, identical with the Huye of Du Halde (Description de l'empire de la Chine, Vol. IV, p. 15; compare also L. v. Schrenck, Reisen und Forschungen, Vol. III, p. 129). On some Chinese maps Saghalin is still designated as " Island of K'u-ye." The Gilyak came to the notice of the Chinese at a very late date; they do not seem to be mentioned earlier than in the Se win Men Vung k'ao (published in 1586) under the name Ki (or KH)4i-mi (Gil?mi), the name given this people by its Tungusian neighbors (compare A. Wylie, Chinese Researches, pt. 3, p. 249, who alludes to this passage without identifying the tribe). In the Chinese work previously quoted, the Gilyak are pictured and described under the term Fei-ya-k'a as inhabiting the country to the extreme east of the Sungari, the littoral of the ocean, and scattered over the islands (compare L. v. Schrenck, I. c, pp. 100-103). 1A very interesting case was established by Franz Boas in his study Property Marks of Alaskan Eskimo (American Anthropologist, 1899, pp. 601-613). Property marks are very frequently used by these tribes on weapons employed in hunting with the object of securing property-right in the animal in whose body the weapon bearing the mark is found. It is a remarkable fact that these m?,rks occur only among the Eskimo tribes of Alaska, but are not known from any other Eskimo tribe. This fact, taken in connection with the form and occurrence of such marks among the north-eastern tribes of Asia, suggests to Boas that this custom, like so many other peculiarities of Alaskan Eskimo life, may be due to contact with Asiatic tribes. This case is very plausible, and would merit a more profound historical investigation in connection with the practice of tamga now disseminated throughout Siberia.</page><page sequence="199">The Problem of Plate Armor 269 time; it is always preceded by plainer types, usually cuirasses of hide or cotton, and scale armor. Cuirasses of rhinoceros-skin were utilized in China for thousands of years, before any metal harness became known. In China as well as in Egypt we clearly recognize the inter? mediary stages of hide and plate armor, the surface of the hide being first reinforced by irregular, scale-like metal pieces (first of copper, later of iron), which gradually assumed the standard rectangular plate shape; and then, by removing the hide foundation, the pure metal plate armor sprang up as a new and independent type. The history of defensive and offensive weapons, moreover, is closely interrelated; the eternal game of modern war industry ? first inventing bullet-proof naval armor-plates, and then the bullets to pierce them ? was in full swing even in the stages of primitive life. The growing perfection of metal weapons constantly forced man to devise new means of increasing the power of his defensive armor, and this accounts for the coming into existence of ever-varying new types. I am certainly not competent on any subject of American ethnology, and must leave it to our Ameri? canists to reason out the case for themselves. But this much may be said. Nearly everywhere in North America, even in the eastern area, we generally find the type of hide armor, the indigenous development of which is admitted by Dr. Hough and cannot seriously be challenged; thus hide armor may have been the oldest form of body protection in war also in this region.1 We meet there also the intermediary stages, as, for instance, the wooden cuirass of the Thompson River Indians, covered with elk-hide, described by James Teit,2 and the application of wooden slats, of reeds, of bone plates to the exterior or interior of the cuirass, to strengthen it more efficiently, ?the secondary development. Finally those materials were exclusively utilized in its construction, leading up to pure plate armor as a tertiary and ultimate stage. No fundamental difference can be found in the employment of wood and bone, or ivory, which simply present purely technical changes of mate? rial; and American-Asiatic bone plate armor, after all, might be con? ceived as quite a natural development, which may have arisen inde? pendently, without the contact of an outside culture. Its coming into existence could be explained by the trend of indigenous thought and the 1 "The American savages were acquainted with body armor when they were first encountered. Wherever the elk, the moose, the buffalo, and other great land mammals abounded, there it was possible to cover the body with an impervious suit of raw-hide" (O. T. Mason, The Origins of Invention, p. 390). 2 The Thompson Indians of British Columbia (Jesup North Pacific Expedition, Vol. II, p. 265). See also A. P. Niblack, The Coast Indians of Southern Alaska (Report U. S. National Museum, 1888, pp. 268-270).</page><page sequence="200">270 Chinese Clay Figures inventiveness of the aborigines, which may have resulted in a large variety of ingenious armor spread over an extensive area.1 There remain other considerations to be made which would seem to confirm this impression. The cut, the style, and the mode of wearing armor in the North-Pacific region are different from those in eastern Asia. The peculiar Chukchi fashion of having the left side covered up and the left arm and hand hidden in the armor, while only the right arm remains free for action,2 is a striking feature, which is entirely lacking in any other part of Asia. At any rate, I am inclined toward the opinion that the type of bone plate armor under consideration is not exclusively due to an impact of foreign influence. In some form unknown to us it may have pre-existed, before any metal plate armor had reached the Far East; while I am quite willing to admit that at some later period the regular, rectangular shapes of the ivory plates, and the peculiar method of lashing them together, may be the outcome of an adaptation to some imported model. The memorable passage in the Chinese Annals concerning the Su shen may elucidate still another problem. Their gifts to China in 262 consisted not only of bone armor, but also of iron armor. Bogoras 3 has shown that ancient iron armor, made of small pieces of iron with fastenings of narrow leather strips, was until recently very common among the Reindeer Chukchi; and he makes it probable that iron was known among them before the arrival of the Russians. And here the Su-sh?n come again to our assistance in dispelling the Japanese spectre; for the question of the origin and manufacture of Chukchi iron armor suggests to Mr. Bogoras "a connection with the Japanese which does not exist at present,"? and which in all probability has never existed. Mr. Bogoras is unable to furnish any evidence for such an alleged inter? course, which is certainly not proved by the occasional occurrence of a modern Japanese article of trade in that region.4 The facts in the case 11 do not mean to say, of course, that the development has actually and ob? jectively taken place that way, but only wish to point out that it may be thus construed in our minds. 2 Hough, Plate V; Bogoras, The Chukchee, p. 163 (shows also a suit of left handed iron armor). 3 The Chukchee (Jesup North Pacific Expedition, Vol. VII, No. 1, p. 54). 4 The statement of Bogoras that the armor and helmet figured on p. 164 are Japanese seems to me to require further proof. It rather conveys the impression of being un-Japanese. Bogoras alludes to the advance of the Japanese to Kamchatka without citing sources in support of this opinion. I presume he must have had in mind the passages of G. W. Steller (Beschreibung von dem Lande Kamtschatka, pp. 3, 249) saying that the Japanese were long known as traders to the inhabitants of the littoral of the Okhotsk Sea (on the Kamchadal name of the Japanese, see L. v. Schrenck, /. c, p. 192). Kamchatka was vaguely known to the Japanese of the eighteenth century, as we see from Klaproth's Apercu general des trois royaumes</page><page sequence="201">The Problem of Plate Armor 271 are that the Japanese never have penetrated much beyond Saghalin Island, where the southern portion inhabited by the Ainu was their main field of exploitation, while the northern part remained a terra incognita to them. The Japanese have exerted no influence on the culture of the Gilyak settled there,1 nor is there any Japanese trace on the mainland in the region of the Amur. Even without such considerations, how? ever, the point of view taken by Bogoras in this matter can no longer be upheld. The fact that the Su-shen possessed knowledge of iron armor in 262 goes to prove that iron armor around that time was within the boundaries of the North-Pacific culture-zone.2 Again, it must be called to mind that the Su-sMn iron armor cannot have been of Japanese origin, as iron armor was not then in existence in Japan; neither can it be set in relation with Chinese iron armor, as it would be absurd to suppose that the Su-sMn should have sent Chinese iron armor as tribute to the Chinese Court. Their tribute certainly consisted of curious and valuable objects which were new and impressive to the Chinese. As the Su-sh?n were not able to make iron armor, not being acquainted with the technique of smelting and forging iron, they con? sequently must have received it in the channel of trade from an iron producing region, such as we find in ancient times in the interior of Siberia, in Central Asia,3 and in the beginning of our era also in (p. 195, Paris, 1832). The Italmen, the ancient Kamchadal, knew the Japanese chiefly as importers of iron needles, and styled these Sis (plural sisin: I. Radlinski, Slownik narzecza Kamczadal?w, p. 72, Cracow, 1892) after Sisam, the Ainu designa? tion of the Japanese. But it is altogether the simple question of a superficial trading relation along the coast by way of the Kuriles; and there is no trace of Japanese influence whatever on the culture of the Kamchadal. 1 Likewise L. v. Schrenck (Reisen und Forschungen im Amur-Lande, Vol. III, P- 570). 2 This chapter, as it now stands, was in substance written in the autumn of 1912, an abstract of it having been read at the meeting of the American Anthropological Association held in Cleveland, December, 1912 (see Science, 1913, p. 342, or Am. Anthr., 1913, p. 960). A confirmation of the above conclusion is now furnished by the highly interesting study of R. and K. Torii (/. c, p. 72), who found in eastern Mon? golia a metal (seemingly iron) plate of an armor (4X2.5 cm) with four apertures in the long sides. It is correctly diagnosed by the two Japanese authors, who remark that such plates are now dispersed among the ruins left by the Tung Hu ["Eastern Hu," a general Chinese designation for the populace of eastern Siberia], especially in the region of the Shira Muren. This archaeological discovery bears out the fact that iron armor anciently did exist in eastern Siberia, and that it was of the type of plate armor. Thus the supposition is gaining ground that the iron harness in the possession of the Su-sh6n was iron plate armor, and existed in that region side by side with bone plate armor. Messrs. Torii, in this connection, remind us of the fact that the Wu-huan, according to the Annals of the Later Han Dynasty, are capable of making their bows and arrows, also saddlery, and turn out their own arms from forged iron. 3 It is known that L. v. Schrenck (/. c, Vol. Ill, p. 569) attributes to Japanese influence the knowledge of iron-forging among the Ainu and Gilyak. This being an affair of recent origin is certainly not a serious case; these tribes purchase Japanese pig-iron, and work it up into blades for knives. Sehrenek's point of view that iron</page><page sequence="202">272 Chinese Clay Figures Korea.1 These considerations are instructive also in that they reveal the baselessness of what might be styled "the Japanese mirage of American ethnology." Not only objects of material culture like plate armor, but also motives of myth and legend, have been traced from America directly to Japan, as, for instance, by the late Paul Ehrenreich.2 This method seems to me inadequate for historical reasons. The primeval culture type of Japan, as we know it, is a comparatively recent production, very recent when contrasted with the great centres of culture developed on the mainland of Asia, and recent even in comparison with all in? digenous cultures found on the American Continent. I mean to say that most phenomena of culture, inclusive of myth and religion, are by far older on this continent, and still preserved in an older form, than any corresponding phenomena in Japanese culture, even if the latter are reduced to their oldest attainable condition. The K?jiki and Nihongi, the main text-books of Japanese mythology, do not present a pure source of genuine Japanese thought, but are retrospective records largely written under Chinese and Korean influence, and echoing in a bewilder? ing medley continental-Asiatic and Malayo-Polynesian traditions. But more than that,?it may be safely stated at the present time that the history of American cultures has never had, and never could have had, any relation with Japan, which always was beyond the pale of American-Asiatic relations, and that American ethnology offers no point of contact with Japan. The threads of historical connection run? ning from America into Asia do not terminate in Japan, but first of all, as far as the times of antiquity are concerned, in a territory which may be defined as the northern parts of modern Manchuria and Korea. From ancient times the varied population of this region has shared to some extent in the cultural elements which go to make up the character forging among the Gold on the Amur is due to the adjoining Manchu-Chinese, how? ever, is entirely erroneous, as this art doubtless is much older in that region than the rule and influence of the Manchu, and points decidedly in the direction of the Turkish Yakut. Many iron objects of an ornamental character in use among the Gold can be plainly recognized as Yakutan in origin, and Yakut are constantly living and trad? ing in their midst. Neither the Japanese nor the Chinese need be invoked to explain iron-forging in eastern and north-eastern Siberia, as it is much older in the interior of Siberia, where there have been at all times better blacksmiths, forging better iron-work than was ever turned out in China. 1 The Annals of the Later Han Dynasty (Hou Han shu, Ch. 115, p. 5 b) relate that the country Shen-han in Korea produced iron, that the Wei, Wo (Japanese) and Ma-han went there to purchase it on the market, and that iron was the means of barter in all business transactions. There was no iron in the country of the Shi wei, and they received it from Korea in exchange for sable-skins [Pei shi, Ch. 94, p. 9 b). The considerable beds of iron ore in Kang-wun Province are still worked by the natives, who scrape it up from the surface of the ground, and smelt it in furnaces by means of charcoal (H. B. Hulbert, The Passing of Korea, p. 274). 2 Die Mythen und Legenden der s?damerikanischen Urv?lker, pp. 77 et seq.

It does not suffice for the study of American-Asiatic relations to take into consideration only the present ethnological conditions, as has been done, but the ancient ethnology of that region must first be reconstructed. From this point, the further contact, if any, may be given, and as our knowledge advances, may eventually be established at a future date (I speak only hypo thetically) with ancient China on the one hand, and ancient Siberia on the other,?relations which would all refer to pre-Japanese times, and move outside of the current of Japan. The early existence of bone armor is one of the examples proving that this view seems to be on the right track, and entitling us to speak of an historic antiquity in North Pacific culture. A pragmatic history of the development of plate armor cannot yet be written, as the subject has not been thoroughly investigated by specialists in the antiquity of western Asia, and as there are doubtless many missing links still unknown to us. Meanwhile the following in? dications which I have been able to trace may be welcome. In Assyria, plate armor is unmistakably represented on monuments of King Sargon (b.c. 722-705) in connection with foot-archers, whose coats consist of six or seven parallel rows of small rectangular plates.1 It seems that in Assyria plate mail sprang up during that period, for in the reign of Salmanassar II (b.c. 860-825) the bowmen sculptured in stone are frequently clad with long coats reaching from the neck to the ankles and girdled below the chest, the coats being covered with an irregular checkered design, but not with rows of rectangles.2 Further, we find metal plate armor in ancient Egypt ;3 there a cuirass of thickly wadded material was covered with metal plates. It is ascribed to the reign of Ramses II, who ruled in the thirteenth century b.c. Also the Shardana armor described by Ohnefalsch-Richter 4 ? consisting of bronze plates, two of which are mutually joined by means x P. S. P. Handcock (Mesopotamian Archaeology, pp. 350-2), who speaks only of coats of mail. 2 Ibid., pp. 260, 350. 3 An illustration of it may be seen in A. Erman's Life in Ancient Egypt (p. 545, London, 1894). As a rule, the helmet and body armor did not consist there of metal, being more probably made, as many of the pictures seem to indicate, of thickly wad? ded material, such as is worn even now in the Sudan, and forms an excellent protec? tion. In rare instances, however, defensive armor may have been covered with metal plates. No special investigation of this subject has as yet been made in regard to the two culture zones of Assyria and Egypt; but these indications, however brief, will suffice to show that plate armor must have been widely distributed in ancient times, and that a mere consideration of present conditions alone, as attempted by Ratzel and Hough, cannot bring about the solution of the problem of its history. 4 Zeitschrift f?r Ethnologie, Vol. XXXI, 1899 (Verhandlungen, p. 360).</page><page sequence="204">274 Chinese Clay Figures of hinges, and sewed to a foundation of linen or leather ? evidently belongs to this category. The most valuable contribution to the question is presented by a number of single bone plates of rectangular shapes, found in barrows about Popovka on the Sula in southern Russia. Five of such plates, are reproduced by E. H. Minns.1 As these have perforations (one, two, or three) only at the top and base, we must suppose that they were sewed on to a foundation of cloth or leather; they could not have been, lashed together freely without such a background, as in the Chukchi and Eskimo plate armors discussed above.2 Those with pointed top and a, single perforation, having the one side curved and the other straight, formed the ends of a plate-row. This find attests the fact that bone plate armor anciently existed in the western part of the Old World, among Scythian tribes; and this case shows that in regard to Northeast Asiatic and American bone plate armor we need not resort to the theory of explaining it as an imitation of iron in bone. If imitation it is, it may have been Scythian (or Siberian) bone armor (a single piece or several), which by trade found its way to north-eastern Asia. In the territory of the Scythians we find plate armor not only of bone and horn, but also of bronze and iron; and it seems to me that the adoption, on the part of the Scythians, of the Iranian tactics of cataphracti (p. 220) gave the impetus to the introduction among them of this type of armor. The rock-carving of the mounted lancer on the Yenisei (Fig. 35) demon? strates that plate armor, presumably of iron, had penetrated into Siberia during the iron age. I suspect the institution of cataphracti of being largely responsible for the wide dissemination of this type of armor; it was peculiarly adapted to fighting on horseback, and the Iranian mode of tactics, as we saw in Chapter III, expanded into the Roman Empire, and was adopted by the Huns, to be continued by the Turks (T'u-kue) under the T*ang dynasty. When tactics and cavalry organization spread over the boundaries of Iran, the armature of the cavaliers was. necessarily bound to migrate along the same path. The fresco paintings discovered in Turkistan furnish many valuable contributions to the history of body armor, and particularly of plate armor. A. Stein 3 was the first to correctly recognize this type of armor in a Buddhist statue excavated by him at Dandan-Uiliq. The figure, standing over the body of a prostrate foe, is clothed with a coat of mail reaching below the knees and elaborately decorated. "The gay colors 1 Scythians and Greeks, p. 188 (Cambridge, 1913). 2 In these, perforations likewise run along the long or vertical sides of the plates. 3 Sand-buried Ruins of Khotan, p. 272 (London, 1904); and Ancient Khotan, Vol I, p. 252, Vol. II, Plate II (Oxford, 1907).</page><page sequence="205">The Problem of Plate Armor 275 of the successive rows of small plates which form the mail, alternately red-blue and red-green, were remarkably well preserved, and not less so all the details of the ornaments which are shown along the front and lower edge of the coat and on the girdle around the waist. Even the arrangement of the rivets which join the plates of mail, and the folds of the garment 'protruding below the armor, are indicated with great accuracy. There can be no doubt that the artist has carefully re? produced here details of armor and dress, with which he was familiar from his own times." 1 A rich material for the study of plate mail in the art of Turkistan is offered by the fascinating work of A. Gr?nwedel,2 who himself has clearly recognized and pointed out this armor type.3 The fact that the plates are painted blue clearly proves that they were wrought from iron. The coats are tight-fitting, and open in front; the sleeves are likewise bedecked with plates, and the shoulders with pauldrons. A further example will be found in the work of A. v. Le Coq.4 The T'ang period (618-906) is responsible in China for a far-reaching innovation in the line of armor, which has persisted at least down to the end of the eighteenth century,? the combination of armor with the military uniform, resulting in a complete armor-costume. Up to that time, armor and garment had been distinct and separate affairs. The ancient hide harnesses were worn over the ordinary clothing or uniform, and were naturally put on only when making ready for battle; while 1 The comparison made by Stein (Ancient Khotan, p. 252) between this armor and that on a Gandh?ra relief figured by Gr?nwedel (Buddhist Art of India, p. 96) is not to the point. The two suits of armor are of entirely different types, the former being plate armor; the latter, as correctly interpreted by Gr?nwedel, scale armor. Stein did not recognize this difference, nor did V. A. Smith (History of Pine Art in India, p. 122), who copied him on this point. Among the finds made by A. Stein (Ancient Khotan, pp. 374, 411) at Niya, there is a single piece of hard, green leather, shaped and perforated very much like the metal plate of an armor. Stein suggests that "it probably belonged to a scale armor" (he means plate armor), and thinks that this supposition is confirmed by the metal plates of an armor coming from Tibet (p. xvi). This is possible; I do not believe, however, that an entire suit of armor was ever made in Turkistan in this manner, but that only certain parts of an armor suit were of this technique. There would be no sense in producing a complete suit by means of such separate leather laminae,?a very toilsome and cumbrous process; any plain hide coat would probably^ present a more enduring protection than such an affair. Indeed, this technique is known to us from Japan: thus a shoulder-guard believed to date from prior to 1100 (Bashford Dean, Catalogue of the Loan Collection of Japanese Armor, Fig. 12 B) is made from bands of laminae of boiled leather interlaced with rawhide. Leather laminae, of course, do not present any original state, but are a secondary development, being the outcome of an imita? tion of metal laminae. 2 Altbuddhistische Kultst?tten in Chinesisch-Turkistan (Berlin, 1912). 3 L. c, p. 201, and Figs. 451, 452, 456, 460, 512, 513, 628. 4 Chotscho, Plate 48 (Berlin, 1913).</page><page sequence="206">276 Chinese Clay Figures during the march they were rolled up and carried.1 Scale, chain, ring, and plate armor were all a great burden on the body owing to their heavy weight, and a serious obstacle to the mobility of troops. The reform is attributed to Ma Sui, who was president of the Board of War under the Emperor T*ai-tsung of the T'ang dynasty, and who died in 796.2 He conceived the idea of combining armor with the costume (styled kKai i, "armor clothing") in three grades differentiated according to length; and the soldiers thus clad were enabled to run, and to advance comfortably. The helmets he made in the form of lions.3 This in? novation is illustrated by an interesting passage in the Ch'u hio ki,4 where some new names for the parts of armor are given, derived from the names of clothing. "The skirt attached to the armor is called shang (No. 9734, "the clothes in the lower parts of the body"); the inner side of an armor is styled lei (No. 6843) ;5 and the coat of the armor (kia i, No. 5385) is termed kao (No. 5949)." 6 The general expression for clothing, i-shang, finds here application to armor: the upper portion of the armor is directly styled i ("upper clothing"), and the term kao used with reference to it plainly indicates that a robe made of some textile material was worn over the mail to cover it all round. This state of affairs is confirmed by the Wan hua ku,7 where, besides cuirasses and six kinds of iron suits, are enumerated armor made from white cotton stuff (pai pu kia), that made of black silk taffeta (tsao chilan kia), and even wooden armor (mu kia)} 1 As expressly stated by Sun-tse (see L. Giles, Sun Tz? on the Art of War, p. 58, London, 1910). 2 Giles, Biographical Dictionary, p. 569. 3 Tang shu, Ch. 155, p. 1 b. 4 Compiled by S?

In the above case, the costume worn over the armor is thus called, because, like a case, it envelops the armor. 7 See above, p. 196. 8 Wooden armor existed perhaps under the Later Han dynasty, though alluded to only in a metaphorical sense. In the Chapter Wu hing chi (Hou Han shu), ice crusts covering trees (mu ping) are likened to wooden armor (mu kiai); and the com? mentary explains kiai as symbolizing military armor (P'ei win yiinfu, Ch. 69, p. 42); thus the existence of wooden armor at that time might be presupposed as being in? strumental in this comparison. "Wooden armor" can be nothing but wooden slat armor, as described by W. Hough (Primitive American Armor, I. c, pp. 632, 636) among the North-American Indians. Another type is presented by the wooden armor of the Thompson Indians described by James Teit (The Thompson Indians of British Columbia, Jesup North Pacific Expedition, Vol. II, p. 265) as consisting of four boards an inch and a half thick, two for the front and two for the back, which reached from the collar-bone to the hip-bone; these boards were laced together with buckskin, and the whole covered with thick elk-hide; while the same tribe made also</page><page sequence="207">The Problem of Plate Armor 277 We do not know from the literary records how the armor credited to Ma Sui was constructed in detail; but it was doubtless the forerunner of the armor-costumes, as we find them duly sanctioned by the emperors of the Sung, Ming, and Manchu dynasties; those, in my opinion, go back to types established in the T'ang period. Ma Sui's invention was a coat of cotton or silk, the exterior or interior of which was covered with rows of small iron or steel plates. Indeed, plate mail is well represented on Chinese clay statuettes of the T'ang period, in accordance with what we find in the art of Turkistan. The nearest approach to Ma Sui's contrivance may be recognized in the clay figure of a soldier (five of these are in our collection) on Plate XXX. These figures coming from graves of Shen-si Province are clad with an ordinary long-sleeved coat; in front and back, over the chest, and along the lower edge, we notice a row of plates emerging.1 Plates, accordingly, strengthen the front and back of the coat, and are covered with the same material as the latter consists of. The whole affair is tightly held together by two bands adorned with bosses. The two clay figures on Plate XXXI represent two identical speci? mens of the same type of warrior, coming from Shen-si Province. The left hand, which is raised as if brandishing a weapon (spear), is unfor? tunately broken off in both pieces. The expression of lively motion and the quality of modelling are remarkable. In the grim faces slightly bent and turned sideways, the demoniacal power of these armored knights watching over the grave is well represented. The helmet mask is formed by a bird's head with a strong flavor of the Indian Garuda; a horn or crest in the centre of the head is broken off. The well-developed eyebrows of the bird's faces terminate in spirals arranged on the foreheads; the beak is strongly curved; the interval between the eyes is filled with a pigment of indigo. The helmet covers the back of the head, nape and chin. A shawl is elegantly draped around the shoulders, and tied in a knot over the chest, the two round iron breast? plates being visible beneath it. An animal head is brought out in relief in the middle, apparently a metal clasp holding the two sheets of the armor together.2 An apron, a sort of undivided braconniere, consisting of three horizontal rows3 of long, rectangular iron plates is worn over corselets from narrow strips of wood from half an inch to an inch in thickness or of rods, going entirely around the body; the strips of wood were placed vertically, and laced together with bark strings; such vests were generally covered with one or two thicknesses of elk-skin. 1 Compare Plate XVIII. 2 Sheet armor is discussed in Chapter VI. 3 It is interesting to compare it with the clay statuette found by Gr?nwedel, I. c, Fig. 460.</page><page sequence="208">278 Chinese Clay Figures the coat (Plate XXXI, Fig. 1); the plates are distinctly represented by parallel rows of lines executed in black ink and continued on the back (Fig. 42); the lines are somewhat rounded at the top, and leave no doubt of the real shape of these armor-plates.

They are protected by iron sheet armor,1 over which a jerkin is thrown, two circular spaces being cut out on the thorax, and exposing the iron plastrons or breastplates. The helmet envelops the occiput, nape, and cheeks, and is held by a broad leather mentonni&amp;re. The baggy trousers are fastened with garters over the upper parts of the thighs. Many of these figurines, as indicated by the remains of pigments, must originally have been well painted, the pig? ments being spread on a background formed by a thick coating of white pipe-clay.2 In the two figures in question, judging from the traces of pigments, the helmet was colored a crimson-red, the face pink, the eye? balls black, and likewise the big mustache with turned-up tips; the breastplates were vermilion, and the garment surrounding them light green. The sleeves on the upper arms are still decorated with parallel black stripes; those on the lower arms are painted a crimson color, the hands pink. Geometric ornaments that are but partially preserved were painted in red on the portion of the coat beneath the girdle. Plate armor is met also on contemporaneous Chinese sculpture in stone. There is in the Museum's collection a marble slab dug up in the environment of the city of Hien-yang, Shen-si Province (Plate XXXIII). It represents a mock-gate which denoted the en? trance to a tomb. The two door-leaves countersunk in the slab are divided by a faint line in the centre, and kept closed by means of a bolt carved in relief. On each leaf is delicately traced the figure of a guardian completely armored with plate mail, and holding a sword. On the lintel two phenixes surrounded by rich foliage are chiselled out in flat relief. Plate armor was officially adopted by the Sung dynasty. In 1134, the Imperial Armory had four model pieces constructed, which were founded on the principle of the plate. The first of these, an armor suit, consisted of 1825 plates (styled yef "leaves," written without the classi? fier 'metal') polished and burnished on both sides; the epaulieres (pauldrons) were protected on the inner side by 504 plates; each of these plates weighed one fifth of an ounce plus six fen. The second, also a coat, was formed of 332 plates, each plate of the weight of two-fifths of an ounce plus seven fin. The third piece, a lower garment, was com? posed of 679 plates of the shape of a tail-feather of a hawk, each plate weighing two-fifths of an ounce plus five fen. The fourth piece was a helmet consisting of 310 plates, each weighing one-fifth of an ounce plus five fen; the total weight of the helmet, inclusive of its appurte 1 See Chapter VI. 2 The same process is applied to T'ang pottery vessels, as will be seen in Part II.</page><page sequence="210">28o Chinese Clay Figures nances sheltering the nape and the forehead, amounted to one catty and one ounce. The leather straps wound around the head weighed five catties, twelve ounces and a trifle more than a half. Each suit had a weight of forty-nine catties and twelve ounces. The weight of an armor naturally depends upon the weight of the individual wearer; in the army, however, concern about the individual would not be feasible, and would incur heavy expense as well as waste of material. It was therefore thought advisable to reach a compromise, and to standardize the weight of the armor at from forty-five to fifty catties, with the strict under? standing that in no case should it exceed fifty catties.1 In regard to the Mongols, we mentioned the employment of hide and hide scale armor in their armies (pp. 190,197). There are also accounts to the effect that plate mail was known to them. In the earliest Euro? pean document regarding the Mongols, written by Matthew Paris under date of 1240, giving the first description of this new people, they are described as "men dressed in ox-hides, armed with plates of iron, . . . their backs unprotected, their breasts covered with armor;" their backs remained unprotected so that they could not flee.2 William of Rubruck, travelling from 1253 to 1255, makes us acquainted with sundry types of armor in use among the Mongols, ? the haubergeon (chain mail), scale hide armor, and iron plate armor, the iron plates being introduced from Persia.3 But the Franciscan Friar John of Pian de Carpine (or Latinized, Piano Carpini), who travelled to the Court of Kuyuk Khan (1245-47) as ambassador of Pope Innocent IV, is that mediaeval writer who has left to us the clearest and most complete description of Mongol plate armor. At the same time he is the first European author to give any description of Eastern plate armor at all. In his "Libellus historicus" (Cap. XVII) 4 he describes the defensive armor of the Mongols, and states that the upper part of their helmet is of iron or steel, while the portion guarding the neck and throat is of leather. Whereas the majority wear leather armor, some have their harness completely wrought from iron, which is made in the following manner. They beat out in large numbers thin iron laminae a finger broad and a full hand long. In each they bore eight small apertures, through which they pull three straight leather thongs. Thereupon they arrange these laminae or plates one above another, as 1 See Sung shi, Ch. 197, p. 6. 2 W. W. Rockhill, The Journey of William of Rubruck, p. xv (London, 1900). 8 Ibid., p. 261.

And in the upper part they fasten a single, small thong, doubled on each side, and sew it on to another, that the plates may be well and tightly connected. Thus a uniform protection is effected by these plates, and such-like armor is made for their horses as well as for their men. It is so highly polished that a man may mirror his face in it. In regard to shields, Carpini observes that they have them made of wickerware or small rods (de mminibus vel de virgulis factum), but that they carry them only in camp and when on guard over the emperor and the princes, and then only at night. The armament of the Mongols was not uniform; and this complex and expensive structure of plate armor was probably within the reach of but few. Their ordinary armor was a cuirass of boiled-leather scales. According to Carpini, the leather was that obtained from an ox or some other animal; and the scales were a hand broad.1 Three or four of these were held together by means of pitch, and connected with one another by means of cords. In double or triple rows they were laid around the trunk. The complete set of armature consisted of four parts,?the front piece, reaching from the neck down to the lower part of the thighs, and well adapted to the form of the body; the back protector, and an apron encompassing the back and abdomen; and the brassards and cuishes. The back of the upper arm was guarded by two iron plates hinged together. The plate idea has remained the basic principle of the officially recognized body armor down to the end of the eighteenth century. The changes were those of style and ornamentation only, while no funda? mental innovations were added in the Ming and Manchu periods. The Statutes of the Ming Dynasty (Ta Ming hui tien) contain the following regulations relative to plate armor: "In 1374 it was ordered that in? stead of the threads, by means of which the armor-plates were held together, leather thongs should be used. In 1376 the General Staff was ordered to make war-suits of cotton (mien hua chan i), and to apply to them four colors, ? red, purple, dark blue, and yellow; for Kiang-si and other places, to make war-coats with different colors on the exterior and interior, and to cause the officers and petty officers to change their uniforms accordingly. In 1383 orders were given for harness, each set to be made as follows: for the colletin (neck-guard) thirty plates, for the body armor two hundred and nine plates, for the plastron (breast? plate) seventeen plates, for the pauldron (epauli^re)2 twenty plates. 1 Pulle's complete text is followed here; this portion is lacking in the former editions of Carpini. 2 In Chinese, "arm-pit plates" (chi wo ye).</page><page sequence="212">282 Chinese Clay Figures Pig. 43.

Along the maritime coast of Ch?-kiang and in Kuang-tung, the guards stationed there have to utilize black-lacquered iron plates perforated and connected by cotton strings; for the rest, however, their armor is made in the style of the 'brilliant armor' (ming kia).1 " In 1435 (tenth year of the period Suan-t?) the ordinance was issued that each coat had to be fixed at a length of four feet and six inches, with a supply of two catties of cotton and velvet; for the making of the trousers, half a catty of cotton and velvet should be used; the wadded boots should be from nine inches and a half up to one foot, or one foot and two inches long. Now, the regulation was provided to make wide coats and trousers, and to employ for these fine, closely woven, broad, and white cotton stuff dyed blue, red, or green; the sleeves should be wide and long; and the materials employed, like cotton and velvet, should be of solid quality. The wadded boots should be fine, thick, and strong. In the finished garment a written entry was to be made by the government officers who inspect the troops and examine their equip? ments; they shall enter the family name and surname of the tailor, the cost-price, the measurements in feet and inches, the weight, the number of strips of cloth used in the skirts, with seal attached. At fixed terms, every year before the seventh month, the uniforms were to be furnished. "In the year 1496 (ninth year of the period Hung-chi under the Emperor Hiao-tsung) it was ordered that for the covers of the armor2 thick and dark blue and white cotton stuff should be employed, that for the 'armor with nails' (ting kia) small studs with lacquered heads should be used. It was further settled that, for each set of a blue cotton stuff iron armor, iron to the quantity of forty catties and eight ounces should be required, and that each set of the finished armor should weigh twenty-four to twenty-five catties. In 1503 order was given that the guards stationed in southern China should exchange their iron armor for that made of water-buffalo skin sewed together by means of cotton ropes." Figs. 43 and 44 are here inserted to illustrate the conventional Chinese style of representing plate mail.3 The Manchu dynasty adopted the military institutions of the Ming in their entire range, and in particular the defensive armor, without making any new additions in the line. Plate XXXIV illustrates a 1A technical term frequently employed in the Annals; it presumably refers to highly varnished and polished plates of iron or steel. 2 In Chinese, "the face of the armor" (kia mien). 3 Compare note 4 on p. 243.</page><page sequence="215">The Problem of Plate Armor 285 horseman's suit of armor, as it was in vogue during the ICien-lung period (1736-1795). It is complete with leggings and helmet. The lower garment is covered by four parallel rows of very thin, light and elastic steel laminae of rectangular shape, 9 cm long and 1 cm wide, rounded at the upper end, perforated at both apex and base, and sewed on to a foundation of cloth, the lower ends being hidden in a fold, where they are riveted by means of studs with broad, gold-plated heads. They are not mutually joined, but one overlaps another to a slight degree. In the upper garment the steel plates are invisible, being inserted as an interlining (between the lining and the silk on the exterior), and fastened by means of rivets, so that their gilt heads appearing on the surface indicate the hiding-places of the plates.1 Dragons, all together six, rising from the sea and standing erect, are embroidered with gold threads on the front and back of the coat, on the two separate shoulder-pieces, and on the two side-pieces underneath the arms. The casque, composed of two steel sheets and surmounted by a black velvet plume, has chased dragons in front, and is provided with silk protectors enveloping occiput, neck, ears, and chin. The uniform of an artillery-man (Plate XXXV) consists of a coat, lower garment, and pair of leggings of wadded black satin lined with light-blue silk, and studded with gold-plated, riveted bosses. These bosses, of a merely decorative character, are the survivals of the iron or steel plates which, as in the preceding harness, are wrapped up in the interior of the garment or are fastened to the lining. The plates are retained in this specimen only for the protection of the shoulders, but have a decorative rather than a positive value. They are arranged in rows of three, two rows being in front and two at the back on each 1 It is singular that the students of plate armor have never turned their atten? tion to China, although it was very clearly described as early as by Gerbillon (in Du Halde, Description of the Empire of China, Vol. II, p. 340, London, 1741): "All the soldiers who were in the camp, headed by their officers, repaired to the place appointed, armed with their casques and cuirasses. The Emperor put on like? wise his cuirass and helmet, being accompanied with his eldest and third sons; but this latter was not armed, being too young to bear the weight of a Tartarian cuirass. This cuirass consists of two pieces; one is a sort of under petticoat which is girt about the body, and reaches below the knee when they are standing, but covers all their limbs when they are on horseback: the other piece is like the coats of armor of the ancients, but the sleeves are longer, reaching to the wrist. The outside of both these pieces is of satin, for the most part purple, embroidered with gold, silver, and silk of various colors. Next to this satin, lined with some pieces of taffety, are ham? mered plates of iron or steel, finely burnished, which are placed like scales on the body of a fish, whence they probably took the notion. Each plate, which is about an inch and half long, and a little more than an inch in breadth, is fastened to the satin by two small nails, the heads, being round and well polished, appearing without. Some few put another piece of taffety within-side, which covers the iron plates. These cuirasses have this conveniency that they do not deprive the body of the liberty of turning and moving easily; but then they are exceeding heavy."</page><page sequence="216">286 Chinese Clay Figures shoulder, and connected by a broad, quadrangular plate resting on the shoulder. Each lamina is of steel and gold-plated, and chased with a four-clawed dragon soaring in clouds. From the lower ends of the plate rows project two gold-plated arms, likewise chased with figures of dragons and encircling a round metal plaque (of white copper or tootnague, with brass rim). A plaque of the same material and size is fastened to the back. Such circular plaques are known as hu sin king (No. 2170), literally "mirror guarding the heart;" that is, a protective amulet. The helmet is identical with the one previously mentioned, and heavily lined with quilted material. The archer's suit of armor (Plates XXXVI, XXXVII) is made of black silk, the interior being covered with broad steel plates, each secured by means of two rivets only, so that the plates are loose and movable. Their disposition on the shoulders is at variance with that in the preceding specimen. There is but one row of three brass plates in front of each shoulder, extending in length as much as the two rows in the previous armor. There are three narrow plates arranged side by side on the surface of the shoulders, and three on the back much shorter than those in front. The three rows covering either shoulder are inter? laced and riveted together. Each of these shoulder-plates is decorated with two rampant dragons playing with a flamed ball. The coat is embroidered with six dragons all together. In 1901 I saw a very interesting and ancient suit of plate mail in the Mah?k?la Temple, which is situated within the walls of the Imperial City of Peking. The suit is of yellow silk, to which iron plates are attached both outside and inside, ? those on the exterior being very nar? row slips, those on the interior being four times broader and occupying the interval left by the outside plates; so that by this alternating process a complete plating is insured. On Plates XXXVIII?XL is represented what may be styled a parade or ceremonial armor. It is the uniform belonging to a guard-officer of the first rank, detailed on duty in the Imperial Palace.1 These military officers were divided into seven ranks, each distinguished by a special coat and helmet, and an equipment with appropriate insignia. Their outfits are minutely described in the State Handbook of the Manchu Dynasty. The cut, the style, and the main characteristics of body armor are well preserved in this costume, which is magnificently em? broidered with heavy gold thread, and studded with gilt bosses. Drag? ons', tigers', and lions' heads are the prevailing motives of ornamenta? tion. The disposition of the shoulder-plates is identical with that 1 This is ascertained from the descriptions and illustrations of the official costumes given in Huang ch%ao li kH txu shi and Ta TsHng hui tien t*u.</page><page sequence="217">The Problem of Plate Armor 287 in the suit of the artillery-man, except that the dragons are here em? bossed, and the clouds are treated in open-work, all metal pieces being heavily gilded. Five similar plates are suspended from the ends of the shoulder-pieces. The steel helmet (Plate XXXIX) is a gaudy and elaborate affair of admirable workmanship. It is surmounted by a high crest terminat? ing in a pair of eagle-feathers painted with dragons in gold, and is adorned with twelve black sable-tails,1 seven of which are preserved. Dragons are lavished on it, being chased in the plated brass mountings, or cut out of the same material in full figure, or represented in inlaid feather-work.2 The bow-case and quiver figured on Plate XL belong to the accoutre? ments of the same official. They are of leather, dressed with red velvet; the upper corners and lower portion of the bow-case are finished with black leather. The metal fittings, of gilt bronze, fastened to the centre and corners of both objects, are of very elegant forms and delicate workmanship. The quiver, in addition to these ornaments, is decorated with three symbols meaning "longevity" (shou). The arrows are stuck into the folds in the interior formed by layers of brown felt. Reference has been made above (p. 272) to the early mining of iron in Korea, and the barter carried on in this metal from there to the neigh? boring tribes. Metal armor (kxai kia) seems to have prevailed in the kingdom of Kokurye (Kao-kii-li) at an early date.3 The Annals of the Sui Dynasty4 state in regard to the kingdom of Sinra in Korea that its defensive and offensive armor is identical with that of China, which would mean that Sinra had derived its armor from China. The Books of the T'ang Dynasty mention a kind of armor, seemingly peculiar to the state of Pek-tsi in Korea, under the name "armor of bright lustre" (kuang ming k'ai), which must have been iron armor. Such a suit was presented in 622 to the Emperor of China, and in 637 iron armor (fie kia), together with carved axes, was sent as tribute to the Emperor T'ai-tsung.5 Metal armor is alluded to likewise in the Annals of Korea.6 When the Japanese plundered the royal palace of Kokurye, in 562, 1 This is the required number according to the official statement. 2 From the blue plumes of the kingfisher, Halcyon smyrnensis (in Chinese, fei-ts'ui). 3 Liang shu, Ch. 54, p. 9 b; Nan shi, Ch. 79, p. 1 b. 4 Sui shu, Ch. 81, p. 4 (also Pei shi, Ch. 94, p. 7). 5 T'ang shu, Ch. 220, pp. 4, 7. 6 See, for instance, Ta lung ki nien (published at Shanghai, 1903), Ch. 1, p. 69 b.

Among these are some of considerable age; that is, ranging within the time of the last two centuries or so. We have two main types of harness from Korea,?padded armor2 and plate mail. A very interesting specimen of the latter type is in the Museum collection (Plates XLI, XLII). It is a rough-looking coat of strong twill, lined with blue cotton, and covered with hemp cloth of loose texture imprinted all over with charms by means of wooden blocks.3 The designs are effaced to such a degree that the details can no longer be recognized: birds' heads, floral designs, trees, arabesques, are con? spicuous; Sanskrit letters, which occur in other specimens, are absent. The buttons in front are of bone; the sides are open, and provided with rows of buttons. Both front and back are strengthened by seven parallel rows of rectangular steel plates (averaging 10.2 X 7.5 cm), very flexible, each coated on both faces with a black varnish. The plates are not mutually connected, but merely imbricated, ? a feature not yet ob? served in Chinese plate mail. Each plate is clinched to the cloth foundation by means of two rivets with flat heads. They are driven through, and appear on the exterior as big iron nail-heads. A number of plates have additional perforations that are not utilized, but which show that the plates could have been tightly sewed on to the back? ground had not the wearer of this armor preferred to have them loose and movable. The shoulders are covered on the interior by two rows of 1 Aston, Nihongi, Vol. II, p. 86. 2 A Korean armor consisting of many thicknesses of coarse cotton cloth is figured by W. Hough (The Corean Collections in the U. S. National Museum, Report U. S. Nat. Mus., 1891, Plate XXVIII, and Primitive American Armor, /. c, p. 645); the sur? face of portions of the coat is printed with prayer formulas (dh?rani) in Sanskrit, and such are inscribed also on the helmet. This practice seems to be derived from China: the helmets used by the imperial house during the Manchu dynasty were chased with Sanskrit characters (see Huang clrCao li kH t%u shi, Ch. 13, or Ta TsHng hut tien Vu, Ch. 61). A modern Korean helmet is illustrated by E. Zimmermann (Koreanische Kunst, Hamburg, no date, Plate VI). It is a leather helmet of conical shape, surmounted by a bunch of horse-hair and a metal ball in open-work, and adorned with dragons and a hydra about to attack, wrought in gilt metal; fur-lined ear warmers covered with metal studs are attached to it, the whole style being that of the Manchu dynasty. The costume on Plate VII, explained as the official robe of a minister, is in fact a pseudo-armor, as shown by the rows of metal bosses and the two applique* dragons playing with balls; it is similar to the one on our Plate XLIII. Generals' and soldiers' helmets are figured and briefly described by P. H. Jenings (Korean Headdresses in the National Museum, Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collec? tions, Vol. 45, 1904, pp. 161-163). Good specimens of these are also in the Field Museum. 3 Much in the style of Tibetan cloth prints which are attached to flag-poles set up on the roofs of houses in order to bring luck to the inmates.</page><page sequence="219">The Problem of Plate Armor 289 plates, and are reinforced on the outside by iron bars, one for either shoulder, each bar consisting of two parts hinged together, so that easy motion is secured. The casque (Plate XLII) consists of two sheets of iron riveted together, with a projecting visor and frontal covering the forehead. The couvre-nuque and the ear-protectors attached to the casque are made from the same hemp cloth as the harness; they are likewise printed with designs, and stuffed with iron plates, which are kept in place by means of the clinches appearing on the surface. The top of the helmet is surmounted by an iron trident and a tuft of red dyed horse-hair. There is no doubt that this Korean armor represents a very primitive type of plate mail, and conveys to us an excellent idea of what the ancient Chinese plate mail may have been like.1 On Plate XLIII is shown the Korean court costume of a high official, which is a pseudo-armor in imitation of Chinese style. The cloak-like robe consists of red cloth trimmed with otter-fur, and lined with light blue Chinese silk. It is strewn with regular rows of brass bosses rep? resenting purely decorative survivals or reminiscences of plate armor. Three globular buttons close the garment in front; the two lower ones are hidden under a broad sash of figured blue silk. Around the neck are laid twelve maple-leaves cut out of brass and riveted to the cloth (in the illustration hidden by the ear-protectors of the helmet). The epaulets are adorned with full figures of gilt, embossed dragons hunting for the flamed jewel; they are worked in sections, which are cleverly connected by hinges, so that the shoulders are not handicapped in any motion. The helmet is an elaborate affair, composed of strong, com? pressed, glazed leather, lined with soft leather. The surface is divided by means of four metal bars into four compartments, two of which are each adorned with a dragon, the two others each with a phenix on the wing,?all of gilt bronze. On the sides, silver phenixes filled with dark blue enamel2 are added. The most interesting point concerning our subject is the fact that the ear-muffs and nape-guard, likewise of red cloth trimmed with otter-fur, have thin copper plates concealed between the outside material and the lining. They are kept in place by copper nails with gilt heads. A quilted cap of blue silk is worn next to the skull, 1W. E. Criffis (Corea, the Hermit Kingdom, p. 101) figures what he calls "a Korean knigl v, of the sixteenth century." I have no judgment on the authenticity and alleged dating of this illustration, but in itself it is interesting in that the laminae forming the plastron and reinforcing the sleeves and brassards are arranged in hori? zontal (not, as usual, vertical) position. "Many of their suits of armor," Griffis says, "were handsomely inlaid, made of iron and leather, but less flexible and more vulnerable than those of the Japan?se, which were of interlaced silk and steel on a background of tough buckskin, with sleeves of chain mail. The foot-soldiers on either side were incased in a combination of iron chain and plate armor." 2 A process still extensively applied in China to silver jewelry.</page><page sequence="220">290 Chinese Clay Figures under this helmet. Below, on the same Plate, is illustrated the black varnished wooden chest in which the suit is stored, with a special conical compartment for the casque. This arrangement is also in imitation of a Chinese practice. Japanese plate armor has so frequently been described1 that it is not necessary to dwell on this subject. What is important for the purpose of our investigation is the fact that it does not arise in Japan earlier than the first part of the ninth century;2 that is, in the T*ang period, when it was perfectly known in China. It is therefore certain that the idea has penetrated into Japan from China and Korea, whatever subsequent developments, changes, and improve? ments plate mail may have undergone in Japan. Armor composed of horizontal rows of small iron plates, presumably of Chinese origin, seems to occur occasionally in Tibet. A specimen recently presented by the Dalai Lama to the King of England is now preserved in the British Museum.3 Looking backward at the remarkably wide distribution of plate armor, we cannot fail to recognize in this fact a certain degree of histori? cal coherence. This coherence, without any doubt, exists in the T'ang period between Turkistan and China on the one hand, and between China, Korea, and Japan on the other hand. But the T'ang epoch de? notes only the culminating point in this development,?that period in which we observe plate mail wrought to its greatest perfection. Metal plate mail is a complex affair of difficult and refined technique, a down? right product of higher civilization, which is witnessed by the fact that it is conspicuously absent among all primitive cultures of Asia, Africa, and ancient Europe. Certainly it did not come into existence all at once as a finished product of industry. It ran through many experi? mental stages, and took time to develop and to mature. The elegant specimens of the T'ang, granting the muscles free motion and aiming at aesthetic qualities, were preceded by those of coarser and cruder work? manship; as we see, for instance, in the Korean specimen on Plates XLI and XLII. There is a great deal of probability in the supposition that such existed, both in China and among the Iranian and Turkish tribes of 1 First by Ph. H. v. Siebold, Nippon, Vol. I, p. 333. 2 J. Conder, The History of Japanese Costume (Transactions Asiatic Society of Japan, Vol. IX, 1881, p. 256). According to this author, the employment of plates and scales of iron in armor was finally established as late as the epoch Tensh? (1573 1592). See chiefly Bashford Dean, Catalogue of the Loan Collection of Japanese Armor. 3 It is figured on Plate III of the Ethnographical Guide published by the British Museum. See also A. Stein, Ancient Khotan, Vol. I, p. xvi. Armor of small steel plates riveted on red velvet appears also in Europe (see, for instance, Bashford Dean, Catalogue of European Arms, p. 48), but this subject is not within the scope of the present investigation.</page><page sequence="221">The Problem of Plate Armor 291 Central Asia, ages before the T*ang, presumably as early as the era of the Han (p. 214). Iranians surely were the mediators between the west and the east in this matter, in the same manner as they acted in the transmission of chain mail, caparisons for horses,1 and the great principles of cavalry tactics. Up to this point the territory is fairly well reconnoitred. But thus far we are entirely ignorant of when and how plate mail may have arisen in Ir?n, nor do we positively know whether it existed there at all; if it did, the possible connection with the plate mail of ancient Egypt and Assyria remains a subject for in? vestigation. Altogether the impression remains that plate armor, the last offshoots of which we encounter in the farthest north-east corner of Asia and the farthest north-west of America, took its origin from western Asia. This field is entirely beyond my competency; and it is the sole object of these notes to point out the existence of the problem, and to leave its final solution to the ambition of others. 1 See Chapter VII.</page><page sequence="222">VI. DEFENSIVE ARMOR OF THE T'ANG PERIOD In the preceding notes we had occasion to refer repeatedly to de? fensive armor of the T'ang period (618-906). Mention has been made of the fact that cuirasses of rhinoceros-hide were then still in existence (p. 189), and also that those of buffalo-hide then came into vogue (p. 162). Plate mail reached its climax at that time (p. 277),and chain mail was introduced from Iranian regions (p. 246). The types of armor utilized under the T'ang must have been of a large variety. The Statutes of the T'ang Dynasty, drawn up by the Emperor YiLan-tsung (713-755),1 enumerate thirteen classes of armor manufactured by the Imperial Armory (wu kru): six of these were of iron, and of the types of plate, scale, and chain armor; others were of white stuffs, black silk, hide, and even of wood (p. 276). How the military uniform was then combined with armor has also been set forth (p. 2 75). Besides the means of protection officially recognized in the army, there were other plain and cheap contrivances for the use of the people, such as are still com? mon in the country. Thus we hear in the Annals of the T'ang Dynasty in regard to a certain Ch'&amp;ig K'ien that he made defensive armor from layers of felt.2 The most curious armor of which we read in that period was a kind made from sheets of paper laid in folds, which could not be pierced by the strongest arrows; this invention is credited to Shang Sui-ting. Under the Sung dynasty, paper armor was officially recognized, for we hear that in the year 1040 the troops stationed in Kiang-nan and Huai-nan (in An-hui Province) were ordered to fabricate thirty thousand suits of paper armor, to be distributed among the garrisons of Shen-si Province. The localities mentioned are celebrated for their paper manufacture, and were accordingly obliged to contribute to a demand which could not be filled in Shen-si. The Wu pei chi (Ch. 105, p. 17) of 1621 has preserved for us an illustration of such paper armor (Fig. 45), arranged in triangular scales slightly rounded at the base. These suits were especially favored under the Ming in southern China by the soldiers fighting the Japanese, who then invaded the Chinese coasts.3 The favorite brand of paper for this purpose in recent times 1 See above, p. 189. 2 P'ei win yiinfu, Ch. 40, p. 86. In 1286, according to Yuan shi, the country of Ma-fa sent a tribute of saddles, bridles, and felt armor. 3 The same work illustrates also armor of plaited rattan; but it is not known at what time this type of armor sprang up in China. 292</page><page sequence="223">Defensive Armor of the Tang Period 293 was the famed Korean paper highly prized in China and Japan for its toughness and durability, and forming part of the annual tribute sent from Korea to Peking. In the treaty of 1637, concluded after the Manchu invasion, the figure was stipulated at five thousand rolls of large and small paper.1 A good deal of Korean paper was utilized by the tailors of the Chinese metropolis as lining for the coats of officials and gentlemen. It served also for the covering of window-frames. A sewed wad of from ten to fifteen thicknesses of it made a protective armor for the troops. It is said to have resisted a musket-ball, but not a rifle-bullet.2 1W. W. Rockhill, China's Intercourse with Korea, p. 25 (London, 1905). A notice on Korean paper is contained in the Wei lio (Ch. 12, p. 1 b). 2 W. E. Griffis, Corea, the Hermit Nation, p. 153 (New York, 1904). Paper and cotton armor still exist in southern China. Consul Bedloe (quoted above, p. 180) offers the following remarks on this subject: "Parallel to this alternating of leather and wool in the north was that of paper and cotton cloth in the south of China. It seems ridiculous to call such combinations armor, and yet they make an armor superior in many instances to steel. Thirty thicknesses of alternate calico and paper will resist a pistol bullet or one from a rifle at a distance of a hundred yards. A spearman who thrusts his weapon into a man clad in this kind of garment</page><page sequence="224">294 Chinese Clay Figures The most interesting source for the study of T'ang defensive armor is naturally offered by the clay figures and figurines; and these reveal to us a new style of armor, that of sheet armor, which is thoroughly characteristic, not of the life, but of the art, of this period. The type of clay image which comes here into question is of the great? est interest, as it originated in the Qivaitic worship of India, and be? came widely diffused over Tibet, Turkistan, China, and Japan. We may in general classify the manifold variations of this type among the so-called Dharmapala ("Protectors of Religion")? guardian deities adopted by Buddhism, and more specifically designate it as Yama, the God of Death, who still plays such a prominent r?le in Tibetan Lamaism. J. Edkins1 holds that he may be pointed to as the most remarkable example of the influence of Hindu mythology on the popular mind of China. Among the clay figures of the T'ang period we find two fundamental types of this Hindu god,? a zo?morphic and an anthropomorphic form. The zo?morphic form is doubtless the older one, and is closely associated with the Lamaist representation of Yama as Dharmar?ja (" King of the Law "), figured with the head of a bull, and dancing on the back of this animal.2 Old Ziegenbalg, who wrote in 1713 at Tran quebar on the coast of Coromandel, gives the following description of his image as found in southern India: "Yama is represented as being quite black, with a horrible face, and a crown on his head, and al? together surrounded by fire. In his mouth he has a lion's teeth, and in his four hands he holds respectively a club, ropes, a trident, and a wine-jug, from which he gives wine to the dying to mitigate the bitter? ness of death. On the whole he is adorned like the king, and rides on a black buffalo. The poets have written many stories about him, which these heathens receive with undoubted credence.''3 On Plate XLIV we see him modelled in clay, with most powerful can neither wound his enemy nor extract his weapon, and if his enemy is an archer or is armed with a long sword or javelin, he is likely to lose his life for his mischance. The suit of a famous Y?n-nan bandit consisted of sixty thicknesses of cotton cloth and paper, and made him practically invulnerable. These suits are comparatively light, are very durable, and of course, extremely cheap." Heavy quilted cotton armors are still occasionally worn by Chinese in this country under their garments, when the members of secret societies are on the war-path. The writer was once shown a wonderful specimen in the Police Department of New York, which weighed so heavily upon the unfortunate Chinaman that he was unable to run, and was easily captured after a shooting-affair. 1 Chinese Buddhism, p. 219 (London, 1893). 2 Pander and Gr?nwedel, Pantheon des Tschangtscha Hutuktu, p. 62; Gr?n? wedel, Mythologie des Buddhismus, pp. 62, 168, 174. 3 B.

The terrific god has the head of a bull, exactly as in the corresponding Tibetan images,?with two curved horns, bushy eyebrows, and protruding eyeballs painted black; his mouth is wide agape, and shows the esopha? gus. Palate and face are coated with a red pigment. Hands and feet are provided with sharp eagle-claws. The head is surrounded by flames.2 A projecting crest is attached to the spine, and there is a tail at the end of it. Another representation (Plate XLV), likewise with horned bull? head, shows him in the same posture, standing over the back of a re? clining bull, a snake winding around his left arm. In another clay figure (Plate XLVI) he is clad with a leopard-skin, and standing in the same attitude as the two preceding ones, but without a bull; the bearded face, though of human traits, bears a grim, demoniacal expression, and is painted red, beard and mustache being in black outlines. The erect ears are animal-like, as are the hands and feet; the head is sur? mounted by a long, slightly twisted horn, somewhat similar to that on the clay figures of sphinxes. Between the animal and the human types, there is an intermediary form with some features borrowed from both. In Fig. i of Plate XLVI I, his head is still modelled in the style of the bull-faced Yama, with horns and flames, but he is equipped with an armor in the same manner as the human forms; and the plume surmounting his head-dress is identical with the one in the figures of knights (Fig. 2 of the same Plate). The statuette on Plate XLVIII, belonging to the same intermediary type, displays all these features brought out still more clearly,?the two horned bull-like head with a certain assimilation to human traits, the high plume and pommels of the elaborate head-dress, animal-heads protruding from the sleeves, breastplates, an apron, and a skirt con? sisting of two flaps; thus he is standing over the figure of a demon.3 A demon of exactly the same type is modelled in the glazed statuette on Plate XLIX. The god, however, is here represented as a purely human form, a knight clothed with heavy armor, pressing his right hand on his hip, and raising his left. The figure, except the head, is coated with 1 Why in this particular case a sowf&gt; and not as usual a cow, is represented, I do not know. The interpretation itself is indubitable, the animal being modelled in a most naturalistic style and thoroughly characterized by the anatomy of the head and the crest on the skull and spine. 2 The tips of two of them are broken off. 8 Compare in Indian art Kubera standing on a Yaksha (Gr?nwedel, Buddhist Art in India, p. 40; and Mythologie des Buddhismus, p. 15).</page><page sequence="226">296 Chinese Clay Figures soft lead glazes in four colors,? green, blue, brown, and yellowish white; the demon is glazed yellowish white with brown hair. The plastron of the knight's armor is blue, the circular portions are white, the knobs in the centre are blue.1 Besides the god in the garb of a knight trampling down a demon, we meet again a similar type of knight standing on the back of a reclin? ing bull (Plate L).2 The positions of feet and hands are quite stereo? typed. The right foot is set on the head of the bull, the left on its croup; the left arm is akimbo, and the right hand is raised as if throw? ing a weapon (Plates LI and LIII, Fig. 1). Or, the left foot rests on the bull's head, the right on its croup, while the left arm is akimbo, and the right hand raised for attack (Plates LIII, Fig. 2, and LIV). It will be noticed how the conventionalization of this type gradually advances. Somewhat more artistic features adhere to the statuette on Plate LI I, which, with the exception of the head, is glazed in three colors,? green, brown, and yellowish white; the bull is lost, and may be supplemented from the preceding figure in Plate LI.3 The bull, as previously pointed out, alternates with the demon (Plate LIII, Fig. 2). In Plate LIV, Fig. 2, a human body is plainly fashioned; so that in this case we have the same motive as in the Lamaist images, in which a human corpse serves as basis for certain Tantrik deities. The flat miniature figure on Plate LV is very curious, in that it is cast from lead; it shows Yama in the same pose as the preceding ones, and standing on a bull. Finally we see the ultimate stage of develop 1 The method of glazing in the Trang figures is very interesting: the idea under? lying the application of glazes, if more than one glaze is enlisted, seems to centre upon the tendency of reproducing the colors of costume or armor. In the majority of cases, probably in all human figures, it is only the costume which receives the col? ored glaze, while head and hands remain uncoated. In the figurines of women it is sometimes merely the central portion which is glazed, the dresses usually being of green and brownish-yellow tinges, while the remaining portion is covered with a white plaster. In the case of monochromes, the glazing as a rule extends to the whole figure. 2 A curious analogy to this type is offered in European mediaeval art by the brasses of English lords in full armor standing on the back of a lion or another animal, and by the monument of Count Otto IV of Henneberg, and other German statues (for illustrations see, for example, Bashford Dean, Catalogue of European Arms and Armor, Figs. 17-22; or Encyclopaedia Britannica, Vol. I, p. 587). 3 A type similar to this one is figured on Plate XIV of the Catalogue of Early Chinese Pottery, published by the Burlington Fine Arts Club (London, 1911), except that in this figure both feet are straight on the same plane. The modelling of the head, the position of the left arm, the armor, and the style and colors of the glazing, are identical in both figufes. The pose of the right arm, however, must have been different in our figure, in accordance with the drawn-up right foot; it doubtless has to be supplemented correspondingly with the left arm in the figure on Plate XLIX; that is, the arm was raised, and the hand either formed into a clenched fist, or the palm stretched outward. Also in the specimen referred to, which is in the possession of Mr. G. Eumorfopoulos of London, the face and hands are unglazed, while the re? mainder is glazed in cream, orange-yellow, and green colors.</page><page sequence="227">Defensive Armor of the T'ang Period 297 merit in clay figures without the mythological attributes of the bull or demon; these are purely armored knights or guardians. But the derivation of this type is unmistakable. The demoniacal expression in the face of the tall figure (Plate LVI)? the mouth is agape, as if he were represented shouting ? reveals his affinity with the group of the God of Death. His style of hair-dressing is the same as that in the figure on Plate L, and he is armored in the same manner as the preceding images. Such a demon-like creature is disclosed also by the warrior on Plate LVI I, with very elaborate body armor consisting of large plas? tron and dossi&amp;re of metal, connected by leather straps running over the shoulders. It is plainly visible how the two breastplates join together in the middle. He wears a high collar and turned-up sleeves, animal heads being brought out on the upper arms; the waist is narrow and tied by leather straps, and an apron of plate mail is hidden under the garment. Finally we come to clay figures which are plainly knights or guardians armored cap-a-pie, without any mythological reminiscence (Plates LVIII-LX). In Japan, types exist which are related to the Chinese clay figures already described. These are of highly artistic qualities, and show us that in the T'ang period a Buddhist school must have flourished, the tradition of which embraced the whole of eastern Asia. Two examples are here selected. The one is a clay figure, originally colored, in the T?dai temple in Nara, founded in the middle of the eighth century (Fig. 46).1 This remarkable statue is justly dated by the Japanese in the eighth century (T'ang period). Head-dress and armor, as well as pose of hands and feet, closely agree with those of the Chinese types; here we observe that the raised hand was indeed grasping a weapon. The Japanese name this figure Dhritar?shtra, one of the four Mah?r?ja or Lokap?la of Hindu mythology guarding the world-mountain Sumeru. Another very similar statue (Fig. 47),2 likewise and justly attributed to the eighth century, is named Vir?p?ksha, the third of the four guardians of the world. Both are posed on the bodies of demons.3 The four Lokap?la are conceived as kings and heroes, and hence represented as 1 The sketch is reproduced from the Kokka, No. 170, 1904. 2 From the Kokka, No. 42. In the same manner Vajrap?ni is represented (Kokka, No. 28, Plate V). 3 The Japanese identifications are doubtless based on correct traditions, but I am not inclined to transfer these interpretations to the Chinese figures standing on demons as those mentioned before. We noticed that in some of these the bull-face of Yama is still preserved, and that consequently this figure is Yarria: hence we may infer that also the anthropomorphic figures standing on demons are derived from the same type. Compare also the four wood-carved Lokap?la posed on crouching demons in Kokka, No. 165,1904.</page><page sequence="228">Chinese Clay Figures Pic. 46.

The metal buckles fixed to the edge of the plastron are plainly visible, and tongues are passed through perforations of the straps. The ends of these straps reach the centre of either breastplate, and are strengthened at this spot by an additional piece of leather. The belt is a broad leather band starting in a rosette from the sternum, the end being turned upward from beneath the girdle. It is of especial interest that similar clay figures representing Loka? p?la (the term is perhaps too narrow, and should rather be Dharmap?la) have been discovered in Turkistan.4 These are likewise enveloped by suits of armor much resembling those of the Chinese and Japanese clay statuettes. It is therefore obvious that in this case the question is not of any national type of armor which the Chinese applied to the clay figures, but that this armor was already peculiar to the latter when they were received in the channel of Buddhist art and reproduced by the potters of China. The art displayed in the caves of Tun-huang on the boundary of Turkistan and China may be made directly responsible for the transmission of this particular type from Turkistan to China; for there we find a statue of a Dharmap?la standing on a demon, and with exactly the same characteristics as our Chinese clay figures.5 Was this armor ever a living reality in China, or did it merely remain an artistic motive? It is not very likely that it ever became of any practical use among the Chinese. It is not described in the official records of the T'ang dynasty; at least, in the records at our disposal no armor is 1 Styled in Sanskrit krodha, in opposition to g??Ua, the mild forms.

Besides the hero and warrior type of Lokap?la, we have in the same period a nude type clad only with an apron, and with fine modelling of strong, well-developed muscles (ibid.., Nos. 358, 359).

Sheet armor, indeed, was never peculiar to China, but is plainly of western origin. Above all, this type of armor, even if it should have sparsely existed here and there in China during the Tang, has left no trace in any later period; it does not survive in any harness of the Ming and Manchu periods; and this is a signal fact, as otherwise the Tang tradition in regard to armor was still alive in that recent age.1 Buddhism, however, may have influenced Chinese armature to a certain degree. A peculiar kind of armor styled " lion-armor " (ni k%ai) is attributed to the Tang period.2 The helmet and the coat are roughly figured in T%u shu tsi ch'eng (Fig. 48); but only the former is explained by a note to the effect that for each single piece five or six catties3 of 1 In Japan, however, specimens of such armor, though very rare, do occur. Bashford Dean (Catalogue of Japanese Armor, p. 52) has figured one exactly corre? sponding to the sheet armor of our clay statuettes. It is said to date about 1500, and "this form simulates the naked body and is known as the Hotoke-d? (saint's breastplate), an Indian saint being often represented with the body naked." This term means "Buddha's breastplate (Hotoke=Chinese Fu, "Buddha"), and clearly indicates that this armor was made in imitation of that represented on Buddhist statues. Among modern Indian armor, a very similar type is still found (W. Eger ton, Illustrated Handbook of Indian Arms, Plate XII, No. 587, and p. 124). A somewhat different type of iron sheet armor is figured by W. Gowland (The Dol? mens and Burial Mounds in Japan, p. 48, Westminster, 1897; the same also in Yagi Sh?zabur?, Nihon K?kogaku, n, p. 153, Tokyo, 1898; and N. G. Munro, Prehistoric Japan, pp. 396, 417, Yokohama, 1908). It is likewise a harness composed of plastron and dossiere which are formed of horizontal plates of iron skilfully forged and clinched together with iron rivets. Gowland makes the interesting and correct observation that both body armor and helmet are entirely different in form and con? struction from those of historical times, but that they agree very closely with the armor represented on the terra-cotta figures called haniwa. It is very interesting that the two Torii, in the publication previously mentioned (Etudes archeologiques, Journal College of Science, 1914, p. 73), figure such a haniwa with the description "cuirasse de style european trouvee en Musashi, Japon." The Japanese authors, accordingly, are struck by the "European" character of this armor. It is now obvious that it has reached the East by way of Turkistan: consequently the haniwa adorned with this style of armor cannot be older than the age of the T'ang dynasty. Again we see in this example that the chronology of Japanese antiquities is in need of revision. 2 Amiot (Supplement ? Tart militaire des Chinois, MSmoires concernant les Chinois, Vol. VIII, p. 373, Paris, 1782) was the first to describe this armor, but from a different source. Amiot styles it "cuirass in imitation of the skin of the animal called ni (resembling, it is said, the lion)." 8 The T%u shu tsi ch'ing, deviating from its ordinary practice, does not state the source of this passage, which is evidently not extracted from a contemporaneous record of the T'ang period, which, however, seems to go back to a tradition of that time. The catty (kin) of the T'ang period is not identical with the present one. In the Museum collection there is a spherical bronze weight of the T'ang period (Cat. No. 116,892) inlaid with gold speckles and engraved with an inscription (the grooves of the characters being laid out with gold foil) yielding the date 672. The weight is stated in this inscription as being 1 pound (catty) 8 ounces, while it is 2 pounds in our weight. According to the present Chinese standard, it weighs 1 pound 11.32 ounces, or 27.32 ounces. Consequently 1 ounce of the T'ang period is equal to 1.138 modern Chinese ounce, and 1 pound of the T'ang period is equal to 18.24 ounces modern.</page><page sequence="232">302 Chinese Clay Figures</page><page sequence="233">Defensive Armor of the T'ang Period 303 pure iron mixed with one catty of steel are required, and that a skin cut in five layers, to the weight of two catties, is laid around this founda? tion.1 The term ni k'uei is not interpreted in this passage; but this word ni occurs only in the combination suan-ni, designating the lion. We noticed above (p. 276) that Ma Sui of the eighth century fashioned helmets in the shape of lions. A lion-helmet (suan-ni mou) is mentioned as having been in the possession of General Han Shi-chung, who died in 1151.2 A similar helmet with the same designation is illustrated also in the Wu pei chi3 (Fig. 49); and the descriptive text there given is identical with that of T*u shu tsi chKtng; nevertheless the illustration of the latter is not derived in this case from that book, as the knob of the helmet and the number of plate-rows in the attached coif of the helmet are different, being six in the TKu shu, and five in the Wu pei chi. It will be noticed that the triangles on the plates are alternately drawn point upward or downward, and that the T%u shu begins with points down? ward, the other book with points upward: the two sketches must there? fore come from different sources. Still more curious is the fact that the Wu pei chi 4 illustrates an armor of a different design under the same name, T'ang nik'ai (Fig. 50). While the two drawings agree fairly well in the upper portions, the breast and sleeve coverings, they are considerably at variance in the middle and lower parts, though notwithstanding both evidently represent the same type of armor. The cut of the Wu pei chi is identical with the one figured by Amiot;5 and the quaint text supplied by him is found there also. It runs thus: "The lion-armor of the T'ang. First, five catties of the ' plant penetrating into the bones'6 and three catties of radish seeds are mixed into a pap which is placed in clear water to the quantity of a hundred catties, and boiled till it bubbles two hundred times. The residue is removed, and five scales of the pangolin7 are added; further, 1 Several designations for other kinds of helmets are added, and it is further said that in the south also old cotton is used in their making. 2 Giles, Biographical Dictionary, p. 251. The passage alluded to above is con? tained in the biography of Han Shi-chung in the Annals of the Sung Dynasty (Sung shi, Ch. 364, p. 6 b).

This mixture is tightly shut up in a kettle, and boiled for a day and night. Then the kettle is opened, and the mass is beaten with a leather ladle to secure various grades of thickness, and formed into the shapes of willow-leaves, fish scales, square leaves, and rectangles. This armor has the advantage of being light in weight, and is much employed in the south." This is apparently an alchemical recipe intended to produce a cut proof body protection. The ingredients like the scales of the pangolin rest on sympathetic notions. Of course, it should not be understood with Amiot that the armor was manufactured from this substance; the illustrations show that the question is that of a substantial metal plate armor, although in the text it is a question of scales, and that the metal plates were covered with this essence. The idea of rendering the wearer invulnerable was perhaps responsible for the title of "lion-armorand this name, which conveys the impression of a rendering of Sanskrit sithhavarrnan, savors of Indian-Buddhist influence. Indeed, on ex? amining closely the two designs of this armor, we cannot fail to notice that it is identical with the one represented in the late Buddhist art of China during the Ming period, especially in the statues of Wei-t'o (Veda) and the Four Heavenly Kings, the guardians of the world and armed defensors of the Buddhist religion. Numerous specimens of these in all dimensions, carved from wood or cast in bronze, are in the Museum's collection; whatever their artistic and scientific interest may be, they have no value for the study of body armor which is mechanically copied in various conventional and stereotyped designs not properly understood by the artists. is an inhabitant of Fukien Province and Formosa, and has its trunk, limbs, and tail covered with large, horny, imbricated scales, which it elevates in rolling itself into a ball when defending itself against an enemy; the scales are medicinally employed (see J.

HORSE ARMOR AND CLAY FIGURES OF HORSES Steeds shielded with armor are alluded to as early as the Shi king. It appears that horses harnessed to the war-chariots were sometimes covered at that period with a means of defence,1 which, judging from the use of the word kiai (compare p. 195) in this connection, seems to have been of the type of scale armor, the scales being cut out of thin strips of hide or leather. During the Ch'un Ts'iu period, the horses of the war-chariots were likewise armored.2 This horse armor of the archaic epoch was a plain caparison, and widely different from the com? plex and composite armor which, as we know with certainty, existed in the Mongol period. As to metal armor for horses (ma k*ai), we hear it mentioned for the first time toward the end of or shortly after the Han, in two small compositions of the famed usurper Ts*ao Ts'ao, who died in 220 a.D., and of his son Ts'ao Chi (192-232). The latter says that the ancient emperors bestowed on their servants certain kinds of armor styled "shining like ink" (mo kuang) and "brilliant lustre" (ming kuang), an armor with double seat in the trousers, an armor with rings and chains, and a set of horse metal armor (ma k'ai). This passage is very sus? picious because of its retrospective character: the metal armor (k'ai), while it existed at the author's time, had not yet appeared in the days of the early emperors; and the word is here used thrice consecutively with reference to them. The "ring and chain armor," as previously 1 Legge, Chinese Classics, Vol. IV, pp. 131, 194. Legge translates in the one case "the chariot with its team in mail," and in the other case "his mail-covered team," explaining that the mail for the horses was made of thin plates of metal, scale-like. This interpretation is erroneous. The same misconception occurs in S. Cotjvreur's translation of the Shi king (p. 136), "les quatre chevaux munis de minces cuirasses de m6tal," and is adopted by Giles (No. 1734); while in the other passage Couvreur (p. 90) is correct in translating "les quatre chevaux munis de cuirasses," provided cuirasses is taken in its literal sense of "hide armor." It is impossible to assume that during a period when metal armor for the protection of the human body was entirely unknown, it should have been utilized in guarding a horse. Man of that age could conceive and employ no other armor for his horse than for himself; and since he was acquainted only with plain hide armor and hide scale armor, these two types must have served likewise for the horse, the term kiai being in favor of scale armor. The translations of the two passages of Shi king have to be corrected accordingly. The frontlets on the foreheads of the horses (yang, No. 12,882), once mentioned in Shi king (Legge, Chinese Classics, Vol. IV, p. 547) and once in Tso chuanf did not form part of an armor, but were metal ornaments which served for purely decorative purposes, and emitted pleasing sounds when the animal moved. 2 Legge, /. c.t Vol. V, p. 345. 3o6</page><page sequence="237">Horse Armor 307 pointed out (p. 174), is an isolated instance in this period, and smacks of anachronism. For this reason also the metal horse mail must be looked upon with diffidence, and I am not inclined to attribute much importance to this text. Fig. 51.

The rebel Kao K'ai-tao, who conquered Y?-yang in 618 and styled himself Prince of Yen, for example, was in possession of several thousand mail-clad horses and ten thousand men.1 Among the types of armor officially established by the T*ang dynasty we find also "horse cuirasses" (ma kia); and a charger caparisoned in this manner appears in a contemporaneous clay figure (Fig. 51) coated with a yellow glaze. The armor covers the war-horse almost down to its knees; and as it appears as a solid mass without any divisions, it may be one of hide (also the rider apparently wears a hide armor); it is possible, however, that the hide is merely the exterior cover, and is placed over an armor of solid plate mail indicated by the row of laminae along the lower edge.2 Under the Sung dynasty the horses received facial masks of copper.3 According to Ts%e fu yuan kuei, Chang Yen-ts&amp;, Governor of King chou,4 presented in 942, on his arrival at the capital, in order to show his gratitude for favors received, nine horses, and again fifty horses to? gether with silver saddles and bridles, and iron armor for the protection of the faces of horses and men; at a later date he presented fifty horses with gold saddles and bridles, with complete armor for the horses and men. The furniture of the horses of the Mongols is described by the Franciscan Piano Carpini in 1246.5 It was of two kinds,? iron plate mail, as described in Chapter V, and leather scale armor. The latter consisted of five parts,? the body armor in two halves extending from the head to the tail, and fastened to the saddle, a protection for the croup, a neck-guard, a breastplate reaching down to the knees, and an iron lamina on the forehead (being the chanfrin). In another passage the same writer says that many of the horses of Kuyuk had bits, breastplates, saddles, and cruppers, quite twenty marks' worth of gold.6 The Armenian historian Haithon states that the horses of the Mongols, like their riders, were clothed with leather armor.7 Interesting illustrations depicting the single pieces making the com? plete furniture of the horse are preserved in the Wu pei chi (Figs. 52-54) 1 Tang shu, Ch. 86, p. 4 b. 2 Also among the Moghuls the horses were first covered with mail, over which was put a decorated quilt (see H.

From what has been set forth above in regard to the relations be? tween Ir?n and China, it appears also that Chinese horse mail might have been influenced from the same direction. This influence is very probable; but the discussion of this matter may be left for the present, as it is preferable to wait until a thorough investigation of Iranian horse mail has been made by a competent specialist; ample material for such study is particularly furnished by the Persian miniatures.1 1 In an illuminated manuscript of the Sh?h-n?meh preserved in the Royal Li? brary of Munich, and representing the costume and arms of the Persians in the seventeenth century, according to Egerton, the combatants generally wear conical helmets with solid guards over the neck and ears. The horses as well as their riders have a complete covering of mail with alternate rows of gold and silver scales (W. . Egerton, 111. Handbook of Indian Arms, p. 142).

Particulars in regard to the history of the burial of such clay figures and their signifi? cance will be given in Part II. The observation of the local differentia? tions is an essential point of view to be pursued in the study of these clay figures. The divergence between the grave-finds of Ho-nan and Shen-si is peculiarly manifest in the horses. Those of Shen-si usually represent the bare horse in a sober and mechanical conception;1 those of Ho-nan illustrate more realistic types, always harnessed, in a variety of poses effected particularly by manifold turns of the neck. Most of the horses are posed on a flat rectangular clay base. Among seven clay horses of miniature size acquired by the writer at Si-ngan fu, six are almost identical, while the seventh is differentiated only in that the mane is coarsely fashioned. The horse on Plate LXII is an exception, being somewhat better shaped, and coated with soft lead glazes in three colors, ? a deep brown, a light yellow, and a plant green; also saddle and sad? dle-cloth are represented (but not the stirrups); the saddle is padded with a textile material gracefully draped on both sides. The horse shown on Plate LXIII excels by its massive dimensions, but is other? wise the outcome of the routine work of an ordinary craftsman. The Ho-nan horses, on the other hand, appeal to us by the gracefulness of their motions, and the variety of actions in which they are represented (Plates LXIV, LXV); also the details of the harness are better and more efficiently worked out. In the horse on Plate LXVI, the trappings with their ornaments in metal, the tinkling bells on the breastband, as well as the lotus-flower designs on the crupper, are neatly moulded in relief. The clay figure of the horse on Plate LXVII, found in fragmentary condition north of the city of Ho-nan fu in 1910, is notable for its un? usual dimensions and its perfect glazing.2 The natural coloration of the animal is reproduced by a light-yellow soft lead glaze; the saddle, of the pilgrim H?an Tsang reports that the Indian war-elephants were covered with strong armature (S. Beal, Buddhist Records of the Western World, Vol. I, p. 82). In Tibet the high officers sometimes clothe their horse with armor, and a set was cap? tured by the British expedition under Colonel Younghusband. A Tibetan cavalry? man whose horse is clad with chanf rin, neck and breast guard, is pictured in Wad dell's Lhasa and its Mysteries (Plate opp. p. 168). 1 Sometimes a mere saddle is represented without any other trappings; such a horse will be figured in Part II as forming part of a complete set of finds from the same grave. 2 The technique and colors of these glazes are identical with those on the statue of the Arhat recently acquired by the British Museum, and ably described by R. L. Hobson (Burlington Magazine, Vol. XXV, 1914, pp. 69-73). The excellent colored plate accompanying this article affords a good view of the Tang potter's glazes.</page><page sequence="244">314 Chinese Clay Figures same form as the one in use at present, is glazed a plant green; the double saddle-cloth underneath it, dark brown intermingled with green. The seat of the saddle is padded with a material arranged in graceful drapery. The mane is brown; the ornamental metal pieces attached to the head? stall, the breastband, and crupper are glazed green. The design which is brought out on these is characteristic of the T'ang period, and found also as relief decoration on coeval pottery vases.1 The horses on which human figures are mounted occupy a special place. Their significance in relation to the dead may be ascertained from their position in the grave: they were found either as preceding or as following the coffin. This seems to allude to the fact that they were regarded as the mounted escorts of the occupant of the grave, in the same manner as the living one, when on an official visit riding in a cart or in a sedan-chair, is accompanied by outriders in front and in the rear. As only persons of rank were granted this privilege, it seems certain that the same rule was observed in the grave, and that the clay statuettes of cavaliers appertain to dignitaries. From Shen-si only figures of male riders are known to me (Plates LXVIII-LXX). The Shen-si horses are of somewhat stronger build, taller, and with more developed chests, than the Ho-nan breed. In the former, the curly hair on the forehead is parted and combed toward the sides, while in the latter it hangs straight downward. The men wear a pompon in the front of their round caps, and are strangely clad in long gowns. The cavalier on Plate LXVIII makes a poor figure as a horse? man, and shows that the Chinese of the T'ang period had as poor a knowledge of the art of riding as at present. The women of Ho-nan are better seated in the saddle than the men of Shen-si. The rider in question has his left foot pushed forward and his right foot backward; his hands come too near to the horse's neck, and seem to be in motion. 1 An illustration of such a vase will be found in Part II. Chinese horse-trappings of the T'ang period may be viewed in T?yei Shuk?, Vol. Ill, Plates 196, 197. In none of the clay figures which have come to my notice is the saddle-girth represented. Judging from the clay figures, saddlery must have been almost the same in the T'ang period as at present. The frame of the modern saddle is carved from wood, frequently covered with shagreen and edged with metal-work, usually iron incrusted with silver wire forming geometric or floral designs. The seat is padded with a blue or red satin or velvet cover. There are, as a rule, two saddle-cloths, the lower one of wadded cotton cloth, the upper either of leather, ornamented with designs in color or applique" patterns, or of wool or silk carpeting. A single bridle of cotton webbing is used. Headpiece, breastband, and crupper are usually decorated with brass work, or sometimes with silver gilt. A neckcollar fitted with small brass bells is occa? sionally added. Two tassels of red-dyed horse-hair are suspended, the one from the breastband, the other from the band under the chin. The stirrups are large and heavy with solid bases ellipsoid in shape, usually of iron damaskeened with silver, more rarely of brass. In Kan-su and north-eastern Tibet, wooden stirrups were also observed and collected by the writer; these are made as substitutes only when iron is lacking. Compare also Plate XXII.</page><page sequence="245">Clay Figures of Horses 315 Whoever has observed Chinese riding will have witnessed such perform? ances; and in this case the potter must be granted all credit for his power of observation. There is another type of mounted soldier from Shen-si, whose left hand appears as if seizing the bridles, while he is pressing his right hand against his chest (Plate LXIX, Fig. 2). The figure on Plate LXX is curious in exhibiting a helmeted soldier rising in the saddle in an upright position, in order to salute by lifting his folded hands to the height of his face. The headstall of the horse is decorated with floral ornaments, probably chased in metal. In the Ho-nan types, the horses prick up their ears; their necks are elegantly curved; the manes are either upright, or falling down to the right side, and are carefully modelled. In all Ho-nan figures of riders known to me, the stirrups are represented.1 Fig. 1 of Plate LXIX illustrates a female rider very well seated; the body of the clay is coated with a yellowish-green glaze, and the mane of the animal is well treated; but the form of the head is bad. In the figure on Plate LXXI the mane of the steed is painted vermilion. The woman2 wears male attire, a girdled coat with triangular lapels (as in our man's clothing), trousers, and boots; she is sitting straight and with arms crossed, the short sleeves rendering the hands visible. The saddle-cloth is painted with small circles in black ink, and thus is presumably intended for a panther's skin. The reins and crupper likewise are so decorated, and there are a few black circles on the neck of the animal. The stirrups are repre? sented. The horse illustrated on Plate LXXII is fairly well modelled. The neck is painted red, and overstrewn with white spots. Headstall and bridle are painted in black outlines, while the crupper is brought out in relief. The muscles of the head, the nostrils, the jaws (agape), teeth, and tongue are carefully modelled. The woman, almost Japanese in expression, wears a flat cap, from which a long ribbon is floating down her back. Her dress is painted a brown-red. Her right arm is hanging down, her left hand is raised to seize the bridles. The saddle-cloth seems to be a cotton quilt. 1 As has already been shown by F. Hirth (Zeitschrift f?r Ethnologie, 1890, Verhandlungen, p. 209), stirrups were in vogue during the Tang period; the people availed themselves of iron stirrups, those of the dignitaries were made from the metal alloy called Vou-shi. 2 Horseback-riding was a common exercise for women in the T'ang period. Female equestrians were represented by pictorial art. Yang Kuei-fei was painted in the act of mounting on horseback (Giles, Introduction to the History of Chinese Pictorial Art, p. 50). In the Gallery of the Sung Emperors there was a picture by Chang S?an, representing a Japanese woman on horseback (S?an ho hua p"u, Ch. 5, p. 6).</page><page sequence="246">?
