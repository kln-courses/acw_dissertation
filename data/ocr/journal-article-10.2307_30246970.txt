<plain_text><page sequence="1">A BRIEF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF THE LOWER GILA RIVER INTRODUCTION During the summer of 1955 the author conducted a brief archaeologi- cal survey of the Gila River between Yuma, Arizona and the Painted Rock Mountains.' The 13 sites reported from the Lower Gila by Schroeder (1952) were for the most part supplemental to investigations along the Lower Colorado River. The survey of Gila Pueblo located sites designated as "Yuman" (Gladwin 1930) but at this later time it was not feasible to re-analyze the ceramic material obtained on that survey in the light of our present knowledge. The bulk of material obtained from extensive surveys within this area by the San Diego Museum of Man is largely unpublished. Site designations are those of the Arizona State Museum Archaeologi- cal Survey and a representative sample of the material is housed at this institution. THE AREA All but one of the 14 sites located are within the drainage of the Lower Gila River. (See Map 1.) The dominant terrain feature of the area is the river valley. At present the Gila River is intermittent. The flood plain bottomlands are generally covered with dense growths of mesquite. Sand dunes cap the edge of the terraces south of the flood plain and this side of the river valley is usually steeper than the north side. Desert pave- ment, dry washes, and creosote bush are the typical features of the terrain north of the river channel. Most of the evidence of human occupation is confined to the river valley while trails and trail camps lead away from the main drainage. These are more apparent to the north where the desert pavement preserves more evidence than the sandy wastes to the south. (For comparison of Lower Gila and Colorado River physiography see Rogers 1939: 3-5 and Schroeder 1952: 3-4.) SITES Site locations are shown on Map 1. Types of sites and ceramic corre- lations are indicated in Table 1. For purposes of presentation sites have been classified as Non-pottery, Pottery and Historic. Within these categories are sites which are character- ized by their location and the material which they produced. NON-POTTERY SITES Three sites are classified as Non-pottery. Arizona Y: 2: 2 did pro- duce five sherds but as the bulk of the human evidence was not ceramic it has been included in this category. TRAIL SITE: Arizona Y: 1: 1, the Roll Trail Site, was followed for approximately three-quarters of a mile across desert pavement and sandy washes. At either end of the portion of the trail traced were two cleared circles on the desert pavement (Figure 1). No stone artifacts or ceramics were found along the trail or in association with the clearings. This com- bination of factors fits the description of the Malpais Industry and is within its area of distribution (Rogers 1939: 6-8). PETROGLYPHS Both petroglyph sites are located on volcanic remnants just north of the Gila River channel. The Texas Hill Site, Arizona Y: 2: 3, is clustered around the south and east end of this prominent landmark. The hot springs previously present at Texas Hill are no longer evident.

THE LOWER GILA RIVER, ARIZONA The local trails around the lower margins of Texas Hill were probably for access to the hot springs. Petroglyphs consist of: "snakes"; a human foot (or bear paw?); lizard-like motifs; square-shouldered, triangular-bodied, round-headed, anthropomorphic figures; series of short parallel lines of dif- fering lengths which run at right angles to a longer, vertical line. All these petroglyphs are on volcanic boulders. Arizona Y: 2: 2 exhibits petroglyphs which are modern as well as aboriginal and the location of Norton's headgates at the base of this vol- canic remnant accounts for this mixture. (See page 3 for a discussion of the historic aspects of the Texas Hill locality.) Again, petroglyphs are on volcanic boulders and the most striking is the complicated "snake" (?) in figure 2. The remainder are combinations of circles, circles and ovals, circles connected by straight lines, and "snakes". One anthropomorphic figure is present. POTTERY SITES Eleven localities are classified as pottery sites. The majority may be loosely termed "campsites". They are located on sand dunes (or sand and rock mesas), in the mesquite flats of the river flood plain, or away from the river. In the latter instance the two sites are termed "Trail Camps". DUNE CAMPSITES Sand dunes located on the margins of the flood plain produced five sites. Material consists mostly of potsherds eroding out of the top and sides of the dune (Figure 1). Their location just above the intense mes- quite growth of the river bottom suggests gathering and processing camp- sites for this food product. Arizona X: 8: 1 of this report coincides with Arizona X: 8: 7 of Schroeder's 1952 survey. This site was revisited as a control and cross check for ceramic material obtained at other sites. MESQUITE FLAT CAMPSITES Arizona Y: 3: 4 may represent a site which was occupied for some period of time, perhaps partially historic. Although there are no surface 2</page><page sequence="3">indications of habitations the amount of material suggests other than tem- porary occupation. All three sites are in the river bottom among prolific mesquite growth and on minor elevations which rise three to six feet above the adjacent flood channels of the river. Arizona Y: 5: 1 is a large occupation area which was collected in the field as two sites. However, the site is now divided by the railroad right- of-way and ceramic similarities indicated that the localities should be con- sidered as one site. TRAIL CAMPS Both sites are away from the river and contain a preponderance of ceramics which are not Lower Colorado Buff Ware. Arizona Y: 3: 5 contained only a small number of sherds but indi- cations are that this concentration of human material represents a camp along one of the trails leading to the Gila River. This site is on the banks of Big Ethel Wash, a dry tributary of the Gila which drains the Palomas Plain. The majority of the sherds are Wingfield Plain. Arizona S: 15: 1 is located 15 miles north of the Gila River in an ecological situation which contains both saguaro and mesquite. At present there are no indications of a spring or any other source of permanent water. It appears to be a gathering site or campsite along the trail from the Gila- Salt Valley to the Moon Mountains. The preponderance of sherds are Hohokam, the decorated type identified as Sacaton Red-on-buff. However, the local name of "Sacaton Flat" has a physiographic rather than a cultural connotation. The site is situated at a level which lies on an eroding strata of red rock and silt. TRAIL One trail produced pottery. It is designated Arizona X: 2: 1 although located in California. From Schroeder's location of a shrine southwest of Picacho, California, it is probable that this site is the lower end of the trail mentioned as passing by the shrine (Schroeder 1952: 45). All the pottery found along the 1.7 miles of the trail which was traced is Palo Verde Series. "Trail breakage" is an excellent term for the sherds recovered. They were localized at four or five points along the margins of the trail, never more than six to eight feet away from the track across the desert pavement. These concentrations have all the appearances of having once been vessels which were dropped while being carried by someone using the trail. There were no cleared stone circles observed in association with this trail. HISTORIC SITE The headgates at the north and east side of the volcanic remnant on which Arizona Y: 2: 2 is located have a bearing on the present condition of the locality. During the 1880's Mr. G. W. Norton blasted footings for these headgates out of the solid rock at the base of the volcanic hill. Water was pumped to the railroad and an irrigation canal dug to develop the river bottom land just west of Texas Hill. The headgates and canal were in operation, trapping water from the channel of the Gila River, until 1916. In this year the gates were left closed during the flood season and water and silt backed up and destroyed the usefulness of the irrigation canal and the headgates. Modern petroglyphs of England and Spanish names are associated with this irrigation project. The 1916 floods also destroyed aboriginal evidence of the use of the 3</page><page sequence="4">NNNNNNNNNNNNNN TYPE OF SITE Non-pottery x . x x Trail Petroglyphs Pottery xxxx x x xx xxx x Compsites x x x x xxx Dunes x x xxx-- Mesquite Flats x x x Trail Cmps" x x Trail CERAMIC ASSOCIATIONS Parker Series d s s d s d s s dr La Paz Series r s r r r Palo Verde Series d s d d sd d r d r s Gila Bend Series _ _ r r . s r s d Lower Gila Series _ _ r r Salton Series _ r r r r r s r Other Socaton Red-on-buff_ - - - - - - - - - - r Gila Plain _ _ r - d Wingfield Plain . . . . d r - s Sells Plain r - s CERAMIC KEY d - Dominant series or type s - Some; more than 10 % r - Rare; less than 10% Blank indicates absence Sites in geographic order as they occur from west to east.

The Indians rocked up areas around these hot springs to facilitate bathing. These "Indian bath tubs" were silted up at the same time the Norton head- gates were rendered useless. Mr. J. A. McGann says that Indians used to travel all the way from Mexico to use the former hot springs at Texas Hill. In an attempt to develop the hot springs as a water source blasting caused the hot springs to cease flowing. POTTERY Table 2 gives a detailed tabulation of the 1,209 sherds from sites which produced pottery. Types are those described by Schroeder (1952). PARKER SERIES: Parker Buff and Parker Stucco are the most nu- mcrous types within this series. This condition was also recorded by Schroe- der (1952: Table 1). From Table 1 it will be seen that the Parker Series is dominant in four sites along the Lower Gila. Parker Red-on-buff is found only as a minor type, except at Arizona Y: 3: 1 where it composes 8.0% of the sherds analyzed. This distribution follows that given by Schroeder (1952: 20) The presence of Colorado Red-on-beige and Colorado Red near Agua Caliente correlates well with the ranges given by Schroeder (1952: 23). LA PAZ SERIES: This series was given tentative status by Schroeder (1952: 32). It is not the dominant series at any of the 12 pottery sites herein. Needles Buff does occur near the Colorado-Gila confluence and near Agua Caliente. Identification of this type was reached only after personal examination of a sample of the sherds by Mr. Schroeder. PALO VERDE SERIES: Palo Verde Series types are dominant in five of the 12 sites collected. Tumco Buff and Tumco Stucco are the prepon- derant types and the series is most abundant at the lower end of the Gila River. The present writer would extend the range of the Palo Verde Series as far up the Gila River as Antelope Peak, which is located approximately six miles northeast of Wellton, Arizona (See Schroeder 1952: 26). Tumco Stucco is found only in association with Tumco Buff. Seventeen sherds of Black Mesa Red were identified. It is a minor type within the series but the presence of this polished variety of Tumco Buff justifies that it be given the status of a type (Schroeder 1952: 28). No sherds of Black Mesa Red were recovered. As Schroeder found only two sherds of this type its status remains questionable until further and more intense investigations are undertaken on the Colorado River north of Yuma, where this series centers. 5</page><page sequence="6">ARIZ.

It is most abundant in the Painted Rock Mountain region and the geologic presence of volcanic materials in the locality probably represents the center for its manufacture. This distribution was noted by Schoeder (1952: 24) and he postulated that the Gila Bend Series represents a late development out of the Parker Series (1952: 24). The genetic relationship of Parker and Gila Bend Series is not apparent to this writer. Schroeder gave the Gila Bend Series a tentative status (1952: 24) but on the basis of numbers of sherds recovered and their locale, which is centered around the Painted Rock Mountains, it appears that the Gila Bend Series is a valid and useful ceramic category. Gila Bend Stucco, as noted by Schroeder (1952: 25), is not common and its identification from the one site is tenuous. Gila Bend Beige and Gila Bend Red are minor types within the series. SALTON SERIES: The most notable addition to our knowledge of the Salton Series is the identification of bowl forms. Figure 2 illustrates the complete Topoc Buff bowl recovered from the Texas Hill Dune Site, Ari- zona Y: 2: 1. Distribution of this series is sporadic and it is not dominant at any of the sites recorded. Sherds of Salton and Parker Series often blend into each other. The varied-color, arroyo sand temper of the Salton Series is the distinguishing criterion for identification. No Topoc Fugitive Red was found. The one polished sherd of the Salton Series has been designated as Topoc Beige. This type was not recognized by Schroeder (1952) but theo- retically it would be expected within the Salton Series. Further work in the Lower Colorado and Gila Valleys will substantiate or refute the validity of Topoc Beige as a type. LOWER GILA SERIES: Palomas Buff has been postulated as the characteristic pottery type of the Sand Papago by Ezell (1955: 371). Its relative rarity from the 12 sites of this is notable. It seems feasible that the center of its manufacture was, as Ezell has suggested, south of the Gila River (Ezell 1954: 19). SHERDS OF TYPES OTHER THAN LOWER COLORADO BUFF WARE: Sacaton Red-on-buff is found at one site, Arizona S: 15: 1. Its association with a preponderance of Gila Plain indicates that the site is Hohokam. As previously stated, this site lies in the zone of both mesquite and saguaro and also on the trail from the Gila-Salt Valley to the Moon Mountains. Gila Plain has been mentioned as the dominant type from Arizona S: 15: 1. The re-collection from Schroeder's Arizona X: 8: 7 (Arizona X: 8: 1 of this survey) duplicated the presence of this type as an intrusive as far west along the Lower Gila River as Antelope Peak. Wingfield Plain occurs at three sites. It is the dominant type at Ari- zona Y: 3: 5. This preponderance possibly represents the breakage of a single vessel and it is not considered to be significant evidence for postu- lations on the center of origin of Wingfield Plain. Ezell found Wingfield Plain as the dominant type at sites within Organ Pipe National Monument (Ezell 1954: 18). Schroeder has suggested the Agua Fria River as the center of manufacture (Schroeder 1954: 106). Its presence at three sites along the Lower Gila is intermediate between the two regions in question and probably represents trail breakage. At Arizona S: 15: 1 Wingfield Plain and Gila Plain sherds showed a blend of characteristics which made them 8</page><page sequence="9">Figure 2. Left, "Snake" petroglyph at Arizona Y:2:2. Trowel is 22 cm. long. Right, Topoc Buff bowl from Texas Hill Dune Site, Arizona Y:2:1. difficult to classify into definite types. Sells Plain is a Sonoran Brown Ware type (Ezell 1954: 16). Its occur- ance at Arizona S: 15: 1 with Sacaton Red-on-buff, Gila Plain and Wingfield Plain reiterates its longevity. Sells Plain is thought to be a Papago pottery type, both pre-historic and historic. Nine sherds of an unknown type were found at Arizona Y: 3: 4. These sherds are slipped. There is some gold mica on the surface. The temper consists of colored, rounded sand grains, some rounded quartz and some clay (?). The combination of these features suggests a blend of Topoc Buff and Needles Buff. DISCUSSION Rim forms for types recovered on the survey are given in Table 3. Underlined types indicate that this rim form was not recorded for this type by Schroeder (1952: Table 3). The occurrence of rim forms for additional types and variations in rim forms complicates instead of clarifies their dis- tribution. This situation probably stems from the recognized fact that the series of Lower Colorado Buff Ware intergrade to such an extent that classi- fication as to type is often difficult. Stucco types of the Parker, Palo Verde and Gila Bend series sometimes appear to have a slip. This "slip", which is often a shiny, vitreous, exterior coating, simply represents the upper portion of stucco vessels. Stucco is confined to the bottom of jars and as the stucco finish begins to grade into the buff neck portions the sherds take on the appearance of having been slipped. These vessels are not polished. "Slipping" and polishing do not occur together in Lower Colorado Buff Ware, except in the case of red slipped and polished types. Harner's recent excavations at the Bouse site gave us much needed stratigraphic information on the sequence of types, shapes and treatments. In this light, it is necessary to record that Harner has without qualification stated that "beige" as a valid type does not exist. He says the "brown-buff" or "grey-brown" polished sherds are simply poorly oxidized portions of polished red slipped vessels. (Harner, personal communication.) Thus, the types designated as "beige" in this paper may be erroneously classified. The most significant result of this study is the lack of clearcut geo- oraphic distribution for the ceramic series of Lower Colorado Buff Ware. The sporadic distribution of series seen in the present survey might be 9</page><page sequence="10">BOWLS - JARS Parker Buff, Colorado Red, Needles Buff, Tumco Buff Tumco Red-on-buff, Gila Bend Plain, Gila Bend Beige.

Types with asso- ciated rim forms listed but not underlined. 10</page><page sequence="11">explained in terms of local inducements of hot springs and abundant mes- quite along the Lower Gila River between the Colorado River and the Painted Rock Mountains. It appears that this region was not occupied by people manufacturing pottery of a single series. Archaeological remains suggest a longtime mixture of different populations. There is no evidence to indicate that any of the decorated sherds recovered on this survey are indigenous to the Lower Gila River. At this stage in our knowledge of the prehistoric inhabitants of the Lower Gila River we have no conclusive evidence to determine tribal designations on the basis of series distributions. This is the result of our incomplete information and it is intensified by our lack of chronological criteria to more accurately segregate the only material left in any abundance by the former residents, or visitors, of the Lower Gila-pottery. There is no evidence, based on both the National Park Service Survey and the present survey, to date any ceramic site along the Lower Gila River prior to 900 A.D. (This latter statement is based on recent unpublished studies at the Bouse site. See page 13 for further details.) NON-CERAMIC ARTIFACTS The scarcity of artifacts other than pottery is a characteristic of sites along the Lower Gila River. Only brief comment on these artifacts is necessary as no generalizations can be made from the limited material available. METATES AND MANO-HANDSTONES: The occurance of basin metates at Arizona S: 15: 1 made from indigenous, vescular basalt boulders is notable. Manos and handstones from this site are sandstone and were carried in for use with the local metates. Trough metates were the char- acteristic grinding implement during the Sacaton Phase, 900-1200 A.D. (Gladwin, et al 1937: Fig. 48.) The presence of only basin metates is evidence towards the postulation of different complexes of tools for different subsistence activities. Trough metates are thought to be for corn grinding. Basin metates, in this case, would be for processing the mesquite beans and saguaro fruit which were available in the immediate vicinity. Unless the cultural connotations of the site, on the basis of the Hohokam pottery present, is incorrect, it is feasible to accept the hypothesis of tool complexes which differ with specialized subsistence activities, at this site. An alterna- tive hypothesis would be to attribute the basin metates to the people who made the Sells Plain found at Arizona S: 15: 1. The bedrock grinding areas at Arizona Y: 2: 2 are shallow and none of the petroglyphs at the site are on boulders which have been used for grinding purposes. River cobbles of quartzite are the common material for mano-hand- stones. These tools are predominantly bifacial and have been shaped. The few unifacial mano-handstones are unshaped. HAMMERSTONE-PESTLES: Six elongated, cylindrical hammerstones with use marks at the ends are termed pestles. The three hammerstones are generally more spherical. Quartzite river cobbles provide the raw ma- terial for these tools. BASALT DISH: A fragment of a ground, vescular basalt dish (?) was found at the mesquite flat campsite near Agua Caliente (Arizona Y: 3: 4). GROUND STONE DISKS: One disk of a schist-like material and a disk fragment of a porous, red volcanic material were found at the same site from which Schroeder recovered a Hohokam cremation (Schroeder 11</page><page sequence="12">1952: Table 6). These "ornaments" are also reminiscent of the Hohokam. CHOPPERS: Unspecialized choppers were observed at the Texas Hill Dune Site and they no doubt occur at other sites along the Lower Gila River. SCRAPERS: Pressure flaked, unifacial, scraping tools are not numerous and were not found at the lower end of the Gila River. KNIVES: Bifacially chipped cutting tools are even less numerous than scrapers. An oval, white chalcedony knife from dune site Arizona Y: 3: 2 is the only specialized, well-made specimen found. PROJECTILE POINT: The one chert projectile point found was broad, shallow side notched. The base is slightly convex and the blade edges straight. No cultural affiliations are apparent. SHELL: A lack of shell is noted for the entire Lower Gila. HISTORIC MATERIAL: Cans, glass and miscellaneous metal were found separately or in combination at five sites. As all material recovered is from the surface it is not possible to accertain whether it is in direct association with the ceramics of any particuar site. Material culture from sItes both with and without historic material is basically indistinguishable. This may indicate that all the material is relatively late, that the historic implements are a subsequent overlay, or that the material culture (other than details of pottery form and treatment) has remained almost unchanged for centuries. This latter proposition deserves consideration in the light of Kroeber and Harner's recent study of Mohave ceramics. (Kroeber and Harner 1955.) It was found that prehistoric and historic Mohave pottery (The Parker Series of Lower Colorado Buff Ware and Parker Red-on-buff, Fort Mohave Variant and Parker Buff, Fort Mohave Variant) are basically thc same (Kroeber and Harner 1955: 15). Parker, Palo Verde and Salton Series types occurred at all of the five sites which produced historic material. (Sites Arizona X: 7: 1, Y: 5: 1, Y: 2: 1, Y: 3: 1, Y: 3: 4.) SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS A total of 14 archaeological sites have been discussed. They include both pottery and non-pottery locations and range from trails, through camp- sites to petroglyph sites. Ceramics were the most abundant material available for study and their analysis has been emphasized. The most significant result of this study concerns the distributions of the various series of Lower Colorado Buff Ware. This writer has not been able to establish any clearcut series distributions along the Lower Gila River. Schroeder has also emphasized this point (1952: 11, 12, 17, 19, 32, 54). Although Schroeder personally collected only 342 sherds from the Lower Gila (Schroeder 1952: Table 1) he studied the material collected from this region by the San Diego Museum of Man. It is proposed that the region of the Lower Gila River does present a picture of mixed ceramic (cultural) relationships. The presence of an abundant and accessible food supply in the form of mesquite beans makes the Lower Gila between Yuma and Agua Caliente extremely conducive to seasonal gathering. The utilization of hot springs in the Texas Hill and Agua Caliente localities would attract additional migrants. (An additional hot spring in the Castle Dome Mountains was not visited.) The Lower Gila River is crossed at various places by trails from the Gulf of California, the Gila-Salt Valley and the Colorado River. These avenues of travel pene- 12</page><page sequence="13">trate ceramic and cultural boundries and tend to make them less distinct. There is no chronological sequence presently acceptable for the Lower Gila River which is in print. However, from the recent unpublished work at the Bouse Site, Michael Harner has kindly offered the following gross chrono- logical criteria as determined from the excavation of a stratified site with a preponderance of Lower Colorado Buff Ware and sufficient trade sherds to adequately "date" the various strata. From sites with more than 100 Lower Colorado Buff Ware sherds the following ordering of sites located during the present survey is possible, using the criteria established by Harner. BOUSE PHASE 1 (Pre 900 A.D.) Criteria: Absence of both red decoration and stuc- co. None BOUSE PHASE 2 (900-ca. 1300) Criteria: Presence of red dec- oration and absence of stucco. X:2:1 PROTOHISTORIC PHASE (ca. 1300-1700) Criteria: Presence of both red decoration and stuc- co; absence of Euro- pean artifacts. Y:3:3 HISTORIC PHASE (ca. 1700 plus) Criteria: Presence of both red decoration and stuc- co as well as Euro- pean artifacts.
