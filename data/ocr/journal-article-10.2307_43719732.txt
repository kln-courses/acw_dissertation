<plain_text><page sequence="1">PAN-SUMERIANISM AND THE VEIL MOTIF Rev. George YVolz, S.T.L. II Now all the foregoing must not be taken to imply that the Mother Goddess - whether Ishtar or any other of her Sumerian or Babylonian representatives - was never pictured in the texts, statues or reliefs with a veil. Indeed the complete absence of this article of dress would have been surprising. In order to see this fact in its proper perspective, it will be necessary to review something of what the texts tell us about the dress of the gods and goddesses. In all periods of Mesopotamian history, clothes were favorite votive offerings to be made to the deities. Already in some of the oldest temple records we hear of male and female weavers whose task it was to spin and make into garments the wool shorn from the temple herds,75 and no doubt some of these products were destined for the statues of the divinities. It is possible that we have the act of offering pictured for us on a seal of the Uruk period found at Tell Billa, whereon one figure bears a string of beads and another a "strip of woven stuff" toward the doors of what appears to be a shrine.76 Gudea, the pious isag of Lagash, speaks of "two bright-colored garments, two undergarments woven of four-fold thread . . . two garments bound with double thread" plus a quantity of wool presented to the "gracious mother" Bau,77 while Ishme Dagan of Isin offered "clothes and wool" in the Ekur of Enlil.78 When temples were founded or restored, devotion often led the kings of Babylonia and Assyria to endow the gods with costly raiment: thus Sargon donates "violet and purple (goods), brightly colored (woolen) garments, and garments of linen" to "Bel, Sarpanit, Nabu, Tashmet, and the gods who dwell in the metropolises of Sumer and Akkad" 75 Cf. the many studies of Deimel and Schneider in this field of ancient Sumerian temple economy; see also Lau, Old Babylonian Temple Records, New York, 1906, pp. 32 sq., 38 sq.

Thus Manishtusu gives to Aia, bride of Shamash, what is probably a "new face ( ?) covering" (panu ( ?) subatu) along with turbans, white and dark clothing, and rings of gold and silver, on the occasion of her husband's festival.86 A Su- merian text contains what is apparently an inventory of veils ( tug sag-ush-bar) for various deities and for the temple of Nine- gal.87 So it is not surprising that Ishtar at times is pictured in the religious texts as veiled ;88 indeed, she and the goddess Nana are called "the veiled among the goddesses."89 to the king on the "dressing of Bel" on the 3d of Elul (Harper No. 496- Pfeiffer.

If the veil is a symbol or perquisite of Ishtar in her role as "Urmutter" of a pretended redeemer myth, one can rightly ask to see Su- merian or Babylonian evidence for such an association. In other words, the veil motif must be shown in a mythic context; there should be given a Sumerian or Babylonian text in which a veiled Ishtar plays a part that stamps her as the mother of the cosmic redeemer. That Ishtar sometimes wears a veil, and that at other times she appears, v.g., as the rescuer of Tammuz from the Underworld is not enough to prove that the Sumerians ever linked the two in such a fashion that the veil became an integral part in a redeemer myth. Until such evidence is presented, the motif as described by Jeremias stands as a gratuitous assertion, a modern combination which, if justified in this one instance, would permit us to join any number of even contrary and con- tradictory statements and beliefs of the Sumerians and Baby- lonians (helped out here and there in the manner beloved of the Pan-Sumerians by Egyptian, Canaanite, Hittite, Persian, Far Eastern, Classical and Late Gnostic material) into a more or less coherent system and then palm off that system as the one and only ancient Oriental world-view. If it is uncertain whether the sages of old Mesopotamia ever combined all their ideas on the nature and structure of the visible universe into one ordered pic- ture,90 it is still more in doubt whether they ever did the same for the scattered details of their mythology.91 Now, of the evidences cited by Jeremias, three might at first sight seem to connect a veiled Ishtar with the Life-Death mystery - the Descent Myth, the Siduri episode in the Gilgamesh Epic, and (because of the gigantomachy carved on its base) the Sphinx of Tell Halaf. We have seen above, however, that the first two have nothing to do with a veiling (resp. unveiling), while the Sphinx emerges as the weakest argument of them all. And so the first - and most important - point in Jeremias' thesis appears to be without foundation. But what of the second point - is the veil a symbol of Ishtar, taking her simply as a goddess and apart from any particular myth? This in no wise follows from the fact that she receives it as a votive offering in her temples and wears it in the texts. 80 Meissner, BuA, II, 107. 91 Of course, attempts were made at systematization; cf. Deimel, Panth. Babylon, pp. 3 sqq.; but how far-reaching these were we do not know.</page><page sequence="4">Pan-Sumerianism and the Veil Motif 411 The garments which the divinities of ancient Sumeria received from their worshippers cannot be isolated from the other gifts which piety dictated, and these were - chiefly - food, drink and cosmetics. If, for example, Manishtusu's gift of a veil to the "Ishtar" Aia should prove that this was her symbol, why should not the dates, lard, milk, honey, wine, oil, etc. given on the same occasion prove that these things too were her symbols? The reason why garments were given to the gods and why they wear them does not lie in any mystical symbolism,92 it lies only in the anthropomorphic character of the Mesopotamian divinities. They were "men writ large," conceived in the image and likeness of their worshippers, with the same needs and the same emotions as their votaries.93 Their requirements were the same as those which the ancient Mesopotamian looked upon as the necessities of civilized living. Now, the latter can be easily summed up : food and drink (especially fermented) , cosmetic oil and clothing. In- deed, it is surprising how these appear over and over again in the texts as the concrete expression of what civilization meant in this culture area. The Old Babylonian recension of Gil- gamesh94 describes the process whereby Enkidu became civilized ; he eats bread, drinks beer, anoints himself with oil, and puts on a garment - so he becomes "like a man . . . like a bridegroom." A Sumerian poem on the beginnings of civilization describes the state ante: Bread and intoxicating drink they knew not (yet), Garments of cloth they knew not (yet).95 Note too how frequently these objects appear in the tribute which the kings exacted from the vanquished.94 The Code of Hammurabi provides that brothers who administer their sister's 92 Naturally the divine symbols were also included at times in the dona- tions-of. the gift of a tiara to Sin by Nabonid (Langdon, NBKI 262 sqq.) - but here we know already that the object is a divine symbol from other sources, not from the mere fact of donation or possession. 93 See Furlani, La religione babilonese e assira , Bologna, 1928, Vol. I, pp. 98 sqq.; Meissner, BuAt II, 126 sqq. 94 Langdon, Epic of Gilgamesh (U PBS X, 3) Tab. II, Col. III (cf. AOTB 187 sq.; and compare with p. 165, D, 10 sqq.). It is interesting to note that in the Adapa myth, Anu orders food and drink, oil and a garment to be brought to Adapa. 95 Barton, Misceli . Bab . Inscr. Pt. I, PI. XVIII, Vs. 20 sq.

In the natural order, qualis popvr lus talis devjs; this, and no elaborate mythical system, explains why the gods received what they did, and therefore why Ishtar received veils." Furthermore, admitting other details in the Pan-Sumerian hypothesis, there is a positive reason why the veil could not be the symbol of Ishtar. This is to be found in the rather detailed regulations of the Old Assyrian law governing the wearing of the veil. The text is unfortunately somewhat mutilated, but it is clear enough that married women and women of the harem (in the company of their mistress, the chief wife) must veil themselves when appearing in public, while the common prosti- tute and the slave are forbidden to do so under pain of the severest penalties. Between these two classes stands the hiero- dule, or ritual prostitute - she must wear the veil if she is mar- ried, but dare not do so if she is not.100 Now this law is some- thing exceedingly strange, not to say impossible, if Pan-Su- merianism be correct. Jeremias declares that, applying the celes- tial = terrestrial formula, the Sumerians saw in the hierodule the chief earthly representative of the Mother Goddess,101 who was herself known as the nugig anna, the kadishtu ilani Par. 178 sq. ( AOTB 399). 98 Luckenbill, op. cit., Vol. I, par. 624. 99 The manner in which the dress of the gods follows human styles is also significant: cf. Meissner, BuA , II, 42 sqq.; Reimpell, W., Geschichte der babylonischen und assyrischen Kleidung , Berlin, 1921, pp. 47 sqq., 53 sqq., 66 sq., 71, 79 sq.; Lutz, Textiles and Costumes among the People of the Ancient Near East. Leipzig, 1923, pp. 142-159 passim. 100 Par. 40 ( AOTB 417 sq.). Jeremias speaks of this law in Schleier 14 and 34 n. 1, but ambiguously, and without drawing the embarrassing con- clusion to which his theory must necessarily lead him. On p. 35, however, without offering the shadow of a proof, he states that already in ancient Assyria the veiling of women had become a Keuschheitssitte . We do not know that it has become anything of the kind; we must let the texts speak for themselves, and for all the evidence shows, it always was that or some- thing similar. And would the Assyrian legislators have allowed the rise of such a custom that contradicted the myth, if there had been such a myth? Cf. HAOG 102, 334; AT AO 789 s.v. Hure.</page><page sequence="6">Pan-Sumerianism and the Veil Motif 413 (harlot of heaven, harlot of the gods). And since the Orient knew no separation between the sacred and the profane, even the common prostitute was endowed with the same mystery.102 Yet the Assyrian law, permeated like all Oriental legislation with the sacred theory of Sumeria,103 forbids the unmarried hierodule and the prostitute, both living symbols of the Mother Goddess, the use of just that article of dress which is declared to be the symbol and perquisite of their prototype. If the veil had really been such a perquisite, this fact would not have been unknown to the lawmakers of Assyria, they would have also known that in for- bidding this garment to the two classes in question, they would in effect be forbidding the Mother Goddess the use of her symbol. Is it possible that the legislators would have made themselves guilty of such a transgression against the sacred theory? The conclusion is obvious - whatever reason inspired the law, whether it was regard for the personal dignity and social status of the woman, or the desire to mark the wife as the property of her husband and keep her charms from others, the dictates of a pre- tended mythical system cannot in any event be reconciled with it.104 And as a result of this, we believe, another point in the Pan-Sumerian position must be rejected. For his last claim - the cosmic character of the veil - Jeremias offers no early evidence, but it seems that a cosmic significance of some sort was attached, if not precisely to the veil, at least in general to the garb of the gods. Thus in a processional hymn to Ishtar, the goddess describes herself as crowned with the heavens, shod with the earth, and wearing "shining" garments.105 The first two phrases of this description would seem to identify parts of the cosmos with Ishtar's shoes and tiara, but there seems to be nothing mythic here; the exuberant imagination of the ancient Sumerian poet who wished to picture the greatness of his goddess (standing on earth, she reaches into the heavens - 102 HAOG 477. 103 HAOG 47 sqq. 104 Cf. Driver and Miles, The Assyrian Laios, 130; de Vaux, RB 44 (1935) 411. In the foregoing, we speak of "Assyrian legislators" in a purely conventional sense, without implying anything as to the origin of the laws or the possible presence of non-Assyrian strata in the Code. 105 So Witzel, Perlen , (K. St. 5) 87= Zimmern, bK No. 199, Ks. ill, 17-¿U. The translation is not certain, however, since an and ki need not necessarily mean "heaven" and "earth" respectively; they may signify sim- ply "above" and "below," and so Zimmern understands them.</page><page sequence="7">414 Pan-Sumerianism and the Veil Motif an expression often met with in the texts) can easily enough ex- plain the metaphor. The "shining garments" of Ishtar, however, are frequently mentioned, and this concept might well be astral in association, if not in origin. In the famous hymn on Ishtar's elevation to the Antuship - a poem strongly astral in tendency, (cf. line 29-36) - she puts on the "garment (tug) in lordship, the brilliance of shining Sin," she receives the sublime jewels and ornaments which "light up like the day" and the crown which shines "like the tip of the moon."104 In another hymn, her fellow goddess Sarpanit, called the "herald of the stars," is pictured dressed in light.107 Indeed, a whole series of gods and goddesses are "garbed in radiance," "dressed in awe-inspiring splendor."108 It would seem that such expressions belonged first and foremost to Shamash, Sin and Ishtar, since they form the original astral triad, and that the bright garments are the concrete expression of the light these deities shed. Whether the other divinities were thought to be clothed in similar style because of some quality of theirs related to light (v.g., Adad, god of storms and lightning; Girru, god of fire; Nergal, god of the burning sun of midday and of midsummer), or because of the progressive astralization of the pantheon is a question that need not concern us here. The point is that the bright garments of Shamash, Sin and Ishtar may be cosmic in the sense that they represent the light of the sun, the moon, and the planet Venus,109 but this does not yet make them symbols of the cosmos itself. Against this might be op- posed the well-known pictures of Marduk and Adad on the seals found by Koldewey in Babylon110 whereon each god is shown in a vestment spangled with stars. Yet, however attractive it might be to speak of a Weltenmantel here, we do not know whether the Babylonians looked upon it that way. It may be that this represents the beginning of an idea which later grew into the 10 «ÄA XI, p. 149 ( AOTB 252). 107 Craig, Assyrian and Babylonian Religiom Texts, Leipzig, 1895, Vol. 1, No. 1, 14. ios Meissner, BuA, II, 120; Tallqvist, Akkad.

We have no proof that these garments were thought by the Babylonians to be symbols of the star-studded sky; for this, Jeremias should have proferred a text speaking of gods clothed with the heavens.111 The most that can be said about them is that they picture the light shed by the gods, or that they mark their wearers as astral deities. ***** And so, to conclude the first portion of this study, we believe that a critical examination of the Sumero-Babylonian material shows that the three points which make up the Pan-Sumerian veil symbolism cannot be maintained at all. The veil is neither the symbol of the Mother Goddess as such, nor does it occur as a motif in any Sumerian redeemer or Life-Death mystery ; and while the garments of the gods may assume an astral (therefore cosmic) character, there is no early evidence that would prove them to be genuine Weltenmaentel. Hence, so far as we know, Sumeria had no veil symbolism to pass on to the writers of the Old Testament, and consequently one would look in vain through the sacred pages for anything of the kind. Yet, since Jeremias devotes 14 pages of Schleie r in addition to numerous references in AT AO to this very task, we shall complete our study with a consideration of at least the most important biblical references. ***** Before we begin, let us understand one fact clearly. In the search for a veil, we must restrict ourselves to the text of the Sacred Scriptures. Medieval legends and modern operas cannot be called upon to establish the presence of a veil in an Old or New Testament episode, if the text of the latter says nothing about such a garment. Since the Book of Jonas, for example, is silent on a veiling and unveiling of the prophet, all speculation on this point is useless, and the illustrations of the Biblia Pauperum tell us nothing about the symbolism in which this book is sup- 111 It is true that Langdon translates the an-gu ( nalbash shame) of Chiera, SRT PL I sqq., III, 12, 14, 16 sq., IV, 23 as "garment of the sky" and makes it an epithet of Ishtar (cf. Tallqvist, op. cit . 117), but the trans- lation is not absolutely certain, cf. Witzel, Perlen, NJ^. (K. St. 6) 7 sqq.: "the mistress of heaven - on the tent of heaven is Innini great."</page><page sequence="9">416 Pan-Sumerianism and the Veil Motif posed to be written.112 Still less will we believe that the dance of the daughter of Herodias (Mt. 14:6; Mk. 6:22) was a veil dance simply because present day romancers have pictured it so.113 This is really the height of absurdity: Oscar Wilde and Richard Strauss as glossators of the Gospels ! We shall also pass over the veil motif as applied to Joseph, Moses, and Juda;114 if the god Tammuz has a veil (or its mas- culine equivalent) only because of his association with Ishtar in the Life-Death mystery, then rightly we ask first for proof of the presence of Ishtar figures in the Old Testament : should none be found, then their male counterparts will also be absent, and not much can be made of the coat of Joseph, the face-covering of Moses, and the Messianic garments in the Juda prophecy of Gen. 49:11. Among the women of the Old Testament for whom Ishtar traits are claimed, two are treated in some detail in Schleier - these are Sarah (with her alleged doublet Rebecca) and Ruth.115 It is said that the account of the former's adventures in Gerar (or Egypt) - to be pieced together from Gen. 12:9 sqq.; 20:1 sqq.; 26:1 sqq.116 - has the Myth of Ishtar's Descent into the Underworld as its background and prototype, and of course the veil plays a significant role in the narrative. Following Gen. 20 :1 sqq. principally, the motifs run as follows : a) Ishtar and Tammuz are at Abraham and Sarah stand in the once brother and sister, hus- same relationship to one another, hand and wife. b) Ishtar descends into the Un- Abraham and Sarah go down to derworld.

We have here before us a device that is the delight of certain students of the comparative history of religion; a device well named by Chesterton "The Illusion of the Parallel Columns." With its help it is possible to emphasize surface resemblances be- tween two unrelated accounts, and at the same time to minimize or even leave out of account essential differences, so that the two appear closely related after all. With this method it is possible to prove anything, and find "mythical contours" in any desired literary account.117 We need spend no time in pointing out the great differences between Ishtar in the Myth and Sarah in Gene- sis, even a cursory reading of the two stories will be enough to make them plain.118 Yet even the resemblances which Jeremias points out prove to be very slight indeed. ad a) Sarah is the wife and half-sister of Abraham ; Ishtar is not only the wife and sister, but also the mother of Tammuz - and this son-mother relationship is essential to the role Tam- muz and Ishtar play in the fertility cycle. Now if the relation- ship of Sarah and Abraham is fact and not fiction, its mention in the Old Testament is sufficiently motivated by the writer's de- sire of recording the fact as history. No Sumerian myth, but the necessity of this detail for the understanding of the episode - to say nothing of the Oriental liking for genealogies - led to the inclusion of the item in the Abraham-Sarah story. But is the relationship a fact? There is no reason for denying it. It can hardly be a fiction invented in the interest of the mythic style. Marriages in this degree of kindred are forbidden in Lev. 18 :11119 11T See the clever parodies by Kugler and Witzel in Im, Bannkreis Babels, Muenster, 1910 and Der Drachenkaempfer Ninib, Fulda, 1920, 259 sqq. re- spectively. 118 Cf. v.g.

Even admitting the hypothesis that Sumerian symbolism played so large a part in the writing of the Old Testa- ment, as Pan-Sumerianism supposes, we should allow to the higher morality of the Hebrews a voice in at least the choice of motifs. If the hagiographers had been entirely indiscriminate in their selection, admitting motifs that were contrary to the divine positive law, it is hard to see wherein lies the "recreation" and "reformation" of the Sumerian doctrine which Jeremias claims was the glory of Israel. Surely a doctrine which divorces morality from the forms of its expression cannot be an advance to something higher.120 We have, then, no reason for doubting the historicity of this detail, and unless the rest of the story prove to have a mythical background, there is no reason to think that the hagiographer added it because he saw in it a point of contact between Ishtar and Tammuz on the one hand, and Sarah and Abraham on the other. ad b) We have seen above (note 28) how the mention of the Southland means anything and everything, that is to say, nothing at all. Where the Pan-Sumerians want to find an Underworld, they will find it, no matter what point of the compass the biblical text may speak of.121 The absurdity of this procedure is plain when we compare Gen. 20 :1 sqq. with 12 :9 sqq. In this latter ac- count, Egypt is supposed to stand for the Underworld.122 But the hagiographer declares (Gen. 13:1) that after leaving Egypt, Abraham and his retinue went into the Southland. Of course, in order to avoid an escape from the Underworld which leads back into the Underworld, the theory would claim that a Gegensinn is at work here, but this is only an arbitrary statement. How do we know that such a Gegensinn actually exists, except by begging the question, by supposing as proved the very thing to be proved, viz., that an Underworld myth has been used in giving the biblical account its present form? ad c) This point brings up the question as to which of the two, Gerar or the palace of Abimelech, is supposed to be the 119 On the early age of this prescription, cf. Heinisch, Das Buch Leviticus, Bonn, 1936, p. 87. 120 This still holds true, even though Jeremias insists that the myth and its symbolism are amoral; see AT AO 333 note 2: 350. 121 Eerdmans, op. cit. 22 rightly says: "Nach dieser Methode geht... jeder Reisebericht auf die Hoellenfahrt der Ishtar zurueck, sobald es sich auf eine Dame bezieht." 122 AT AO 348.</page><page sequence="12">Pan-Sumerianism and the Veil Motif 419 counterpart of the Underworld. Gerar lies in the Southland, yet if we let the Southland motif speak in its favor, how can we reconcile this with the Babylonian myth? Whether we find it in the hymns or in the well-known Epic, the Descent story has for an essential motif the separation of the partners : Tammuz descends, Ishtar bewails her loss, then goes down herself to accomplish (or fail to accomplish) her lover's liberation. Why then do Abraham-Tammuz and Sarah-Ishtar go down to Gerar- Underworld together, in despite of what (to judge from the Mesopotamian sources, our only authentic guide here) consti- tutes an essential element of the Myth? The separation demanded by the Myth does take place when Sarah is carried off to Abimelech's harem, but note how the Southland is thereby again magically transformed. On the analogy of the Babylonian myth, all of Gerar with the exception of the palace must now, in spite of its location in the mythical geography, become a copy in parvo of the Upperworld, for it harbors the bereaved partner Tammuz-Abraham. But at long last we have Ishtar-Sarah safely ensconced in the Underworld - or have we? In the Babylonian account, it is the Upperworld which suffers in consequence of Ishtaťs disappear- ance, it is in the Upperworld that all reproduction comes to an end ; in the biblical account, we have the strange spectacle of a supposed Ishtar bringing a like Fluchzeit into the palace-Under- world, while the representative of the other half of the cosmos remains serenely unaffected. Jeremias declares that verse 18 is a gloss that was added by a writer who knew the story of Ish- tar's descent and the effect her departure had upon all sexual life, but surely a glossator who knew this much would have seen the absurdity of having Ishtar bring a Fluchzeit into the Under- world, and altered the text accordingly. add) The means by which Sarah and Ishtar respectively are set free bear only a superficial likeness to one another. Yahweh, protector of morality and guardian of marriage, afflicts Abime- lech and his household and threatens him with death if he does not let Sarah go free ; the gods create an effeminate to satisfy the lust of Ereshkigal, and even then (apparently) can only hope that their emissary can cajole or (more probably) trick123 the Queen of the Underworld into setting the captive goddess free.

I (1932) 78 sqq.</page><page sequence="13">420 Pan-Sumerianism and the Veil Motif After this great difference is allowed for, whatever similarity remains rests upon the fact that neither goddess nor wife could have been liberated except by divine intervention. Or was the timid Abraham, trembling for his life, expected to storm the palace single-handed, and, like a hero in an old-fashioned melo- drama, snatch Sarah from the clutches of the villain? ad e) On this point both stories are in agreement, but not in the sense understood by Jeremias. They agree in that neither speaks of a veil. With respect to the "covering of the eyes," Jeremias derides the common interpretation, viz., that it repre- sents an atonement for the injury done, a metaphorical "covering for the eyes," and merely seconds in AT AO and Schleier 124 what had been said by Winckler long before.125 This defender of Pan- Babylonianism had argued as follows : The injury that was to be atoned touched Abraham, not Sarah, since one does not insult a woman by taking her as Sarah was taken. According to the Oriental way of thinking, the wife is not custodian of her own honor; Abraham alone was offended by the action, it was his, not Sarah's eyes, that were to be (meta- phorically) covered if satisfaction for an injury had been the in- tention of Abimelech. But there is no need to think of such satisfaction here; the "covering of the eyes" is part of the dowry, namely the bridal veil, since Abimelech sends Sarah back to her husband decked as a bride. But on the contrary there is no doubt that the "covering of the eyes" can be understood in a metaphorical sense. The com- mentators126 point out several places in the Old Testament where the idea of a figurative "covering" is present, and indeed even with a view to making reparation for an injury done. The exact wording of Gen. 20:16, it is true, does not occur elsewhere, yet the verb in Job 9 :24 contains the same root as WDf, arid in any event the idea which underlies the usual interpretation is not 12iATAO 350 n. 1; Schleier 29, n. 1. 125 Altorientalische Forschungen III, Leipzig, 1902, 414 sq. 126 V.g. Driver, The Book of Genesis, London, 1913, (9th ed.), p. 209; Skinner, Genesis (in ICC), New York, 1917, p. 319. The passages in ques- tion are Gen. 32:21; Ex. 23:8; 1 Sam. 12:3; Job 9:24. With regard to the first of these, note that AT AO 757 s.v. 123 state that this verb means first "to cover" and then only "to wipe away." Whatever is to be said in detail, the general meaning is clear; Jacob intends the gifts as atonement and satisfaction for the injury once done Esau.</page><page sequence="14">Pan-Sumerianism and the Veil Motif 421 foreign to Hebrew literature; we do no violence to the genius of the language by understanding the metaphorical sense. Now, does the phrase in Genesis actually bear this meaning? Taking the text as it stands, and making no change merely to suit a preconceived theory, it is hard to see how the "covering of the eyes" could be anything but a metaphor. This and the 1,000 shekels given by Abimelech are not two distinct objects that have nothing to do with each other except in so far as they are parts of a dowry; the silver pieces are the "covering of the eyes" or perhaps (cf. LXX, Vulg.) intended as a "covering of the eyes." However they may explain the passage in detail, the more im- portant commentaries and lexicons which have appeared since Winckler stated his interpretation have failed to follow him, per- haps because the sense he proposes demands an unwarranted tam- pering with the text.127 As for the charge that the usual explanation is not Oriental, how are we to know what is Oriental and what is not, if not from the Oriental sources themselves? Even though Abimelech's ac- tion may show a higher regard for woman than was common in that time and place, we must not forget that we have here an exceptional instance, occurring in extraordinary circumstances. The vision of Yahweh, the affliction of impotence, the threat of death - all tending to show that Sarah was under special divine protection - -could well have led Abimelech to act otherwise than he would have done under normal conditions. And so in the end another parallel to the Descent Myth disappears, for the reason that there was no basis for comparison to begin with. ad f) The Segenszeit that follows Sarah's release is com- posed of the following elements: Yahweh takes away the afflic- tion He had laid upon the king and his household and the ability of begetting and bearing children returns, the king gives rich gifts in cattle, money and servants to the patriarch and his wife, and throws open the land of Gerar to him. Of all these details, only one - the revival of sexual life - has any place at all in the Babylonian epic. Yet even this one point of similarity does not 127 Cf. the commentaries of Hummelauer (1908, p. 424), Hoberg (1908, p. 210 if.), Gunkel (1910, p. 224), Hetzenauer (1910, p. 310 sq.), Driver (1913, p. 209), Procksch (1913, p. 296), Murillo (1914, p. 589), Skinner (1917, p. 319 ff.), Eissfeldt (Hexateuch-Synopse, 1922, p. 33*), Koenig (1925, p. 537), Heinisch (1930, p. 257); and the lexicons of Cassel (1920, p. 150), Gesenius-Buhl (1921, p. 356) and Koenig (1931, p. 183).</page><page sequence="15">422 Pan-Sumerianism and the Veil Motif arise out of dependence but rather out of convergence from dis- similar causes. The impotence of Abimelech and the temporary sterility of the women of his household were punishments in- flicted by Yah weh as guardian of the sanctity of marriage; the cessation of sexual activity on earth as described in the myth is due simply to the fertility goddess' absence from the earth. Thus we see that, even apart from the important details of the Descent Myth which find no echo in Genesis, the asserted parallels prove to be no parallels at all. There is no mythological significance attached to the veil of Sarah, because the account as a whole betrays no mythological background and because a veil for Sarah is not mentioned at all. The story of Ruth is also supposed to have been written largely in the style of the Descent Myth, or more precisely, in the colors of the goddess' ascent out of the Underworld. The following details are called upon to prove the mythic relationship:128 a) The Book of Ruth contains several motif names: Noemi (= the pleasant or lovely one, a word related to the Tammuz cycle, see AT AO 760 s.v. Dyj) ; Mahlon and Kilyon (Drought and Tuberculosis, names indicative of the Fluchzeit) ; Booz (same name as that of one of the Temple pillars, both of which have cosmic significance) ; and finally, the events narrated lead up to the finding of nùD by the chief actors - now this contains the motif word nu. b) The events take place at the time of the barley harvest, i.e., the summer solstice, which is the critical point of time in the Tammuz cycle when the death of the god is lamented. c) Ishtar traits are to be found in both Ruth and Noemi. The latter is Ishtar in her Underworld aspect, representative of the Fluchzeit. As such she is the man-slaying Ishtar, cf., the death of her husband and her two sons. She complains about her barrenness and asks to be called Mara, but now that she comes with Ruth, Noemi announces the coming of a Segenszeit. d) Ruth is a gleaner; this has its prototype in the Ishtar with the ear of grain in Babylonian mythology. e) Ruth-Ishtar veils herself like Thamar before Juda (Gen. 38:12 sqq.) and so attired approaches Booz at midnight, when he had "eaten and drunk and his heart was merry." She uncovers his margeloth, lies down, and the "redeemer" child is con- 128 See also AT AO p. 487 sqq.</page><page sequence="16">Pan-Sumerianism and the Veil Motif 423 ceived. This is the same motif employed in the legend of Lot and his daughters (Gen. 19:30 sqq.). In the morning Booz realizes what he has done, i.e., that he had "spread his wings" over her. f ) When the child is born, Noemi becomes its rijpk. These parallels, declares Jeremias, prove "without possibility of contradiction" ( einwandfrei , so in Schleier , p. 33) the mythical style of the narrative. That such optimism is, however, un- justified will become clear once one examines the pretended parallels in detail. ad a) A highly significant fact about the alleged motif names is the absence of Ruth from the list. Surely she is the central figure in the narrative, and if anyone should bear a name that is indicative of a mythical background, it is she before any one of the others. Now if Ruth's name is historical, why suppose that the names of the rest, or at least of Noemi and Booz, were in- vented in the interests of a myth? And if it is not historical, why was a name so colorless from a mythic point of view chosen for this supposed Ishtar figure? Furthermore, a review of the scriptural passages which speak of nûft will show that the word may mean nothing more mystical than a physical resting place (cf. Gen. 8:9; Isa. 34 :14) ; while in the Book of Ruth it denotes merely the peace and security that comes to the wife in the home of her husband.129 If this should be proof of a redeemer myth background, then one must be prepared to admit that every happy marriage was seen by the Israelite as a type of a cosmic Segenszeit . As for Noemi and Booz, the latter is only one of a common type of Semitic personal names that denote mental and spiritual qualities,130 while it cannot be proved that Noemi has anything to do with (Adonis) at all.131 In spite of the Hebrew predilection for Volksetymologie, there is no evidence that the ancient readers of the Old Testament would think of the Temple pillar in the one case, of the Syrian god in the other.132 129 Cf. Ruth 1:9 (to be readrrbO, according to Jeremias )and 3:1.

The pillar named Booz is</page><page sequence="17">424 Pan-Sumerianism and the Veil Motif Only in Mahlon and Kilyon can one see any connection between the name and the character or fate of the individual who bears it, but even admitting the doubtful meanings Jeremias attributes to them,133 by themselves they are insufficient to prove a mythical style for the entire narrative. ad b) The time of the Palestinian barley harvest is in no way connected with the summer solstice, period of the Tammuz wailings, since in this land the harvest begins in April and barley is the first of the grains to be cut down. The events of chap. 3, it is true, happen after the wheat harvest (cf. 2:23) and that brings us closer to the time mentioned by Jeremias, but we shall see below what part a mythical style played in this section of the narrative. Note, also, that the wailings for Tammuz are part of a Fluch- zeit and it is at this time that the goddess prepares herself for the Descent into the Underworld; yet we are asked to believe that this finds its parallel in the Book of Ruth when Ishtar- Noemi-Ruth ascends from the Underworld and announces the coming of a Segenszeit! A moment's reflection will show that the arrival in Bethlehem at just the time of the harvest is well motivated in the story; the report that Yahweh had visited his people and given them bread induced Noemi to return, and natu- rally she timed her coming to coincide with the harvest. Ob- viously, no myth need be invoked to explain this detail. ode) When Ishtar comes out of the Underworld, the warder gives back the clothing and ornaments that he had taken away from the goddess during her descent; Noemi, having come out of Moab and returned to Bethlehem, declares "I went out full, and Yahweh hath brought me back empty" (1:21). Ishtar's return to the earth is itself the cause of a Segenszeit, the restora- tion of fertility to field and herd; Noemi comes back because Yahweh has supplied a bountiful harvest, she does not announce, much less cause, the Segenszeit and her speech to her neighbors ends on no very hopeful note. These contrasts should make plain how accurately the narrative pictures Noemi in the traits of the explicitly called "the left pillar" 1 Kgs. 7:21; 2 Par. 3:17), but the left is the Underworld side (AT AO p. 794 s.v. Links; p. 801 s.v. Rechts), there- fore, in going to Booz Ruth descends into the Underworld, and in marrying him, she took up her permanent abode there. But what has now happened to our Segensgeit? Or must we call upon the unproved counter-sense again? 13S On the possible meanings of the names cf. Jouon, op. cit., p. &lt;J&lt;5.</page><page sequence="18">Pan-Sumerianism and the Veil Motif 425 goddess returning from the Underworld. But Jeremias also de- clares that she is delineated as the man-slaying Ishtar. Now the Mesopotamian texts speak of a man-slaying Ishtar under two aspects, as goddess of war and as goddess of love. As the former, she is "mistress of war and battle," she "strikes down warriors and makes their blood water the earth," and "casts in heaps upon the field the bodies of fighting-men."134 As man-slaying goddess of love, she is best known from the Sixth Tablet of the Gilgamesh Epic,135 in which place the hero upbraids her for the ruin and death she has brought upon her human and animal paramours. But what has this to do with Noemi? Her husband and her two sons die, it is true, yet if this is sufficient proof of the mythic style, then every widow and bereaved mother in Israel is a man- slaying Ishtar. Essential traits in the Babylonian concept of a slaying goddess seem to be that the goddess herself does the slay- ing, and that her victims are either her lovers or her enemies (resp. the enemies of the kings who stand under her protection) . Neither of these traits is found reproduced in Noemi. add) On the authority of a star list which in its present form dates from the time of Assurbanípal,138 Jeremias points out that the Babylonians knew the constellation Virgo as AB-SHIN (ESH - SHIN )=subvltu= the ear of grain. In addition, a Baby- lonian relief dating from the period of the Seleucidae and pictur- ing constellations lying in the region of Virgo shows the latter as a goddess holding a stalk of grain in her hands.137 The afore- mentioned star list identifies this goddess with Shala, wife of the storm god Adad. Now if it is permissible to look upon her as an Ishtar figure138 and at the same time licit to derive from these late sources the early belief of the Babylonians, the latter certainly knew an Ishtar with the ear of grain. But what ancient reader 134 Code of Hammurabi, Col. XXVIII, 8 sqq. (AOTB p. 409) . See also the references in Deimel, Panth. Babyl. No. 1617; Tallqvist, Epitheta, p. 337 sq.

The reference given there to p. 136 should no doubt read p. 171. 138 Shala is here certainly a goddess of fertility; cf. the time at which the constellation appears (Kugler, op. cit., Vol. I, 35 sqq., Vol. II, 88 sq., and Schaumberger in Ergaenz., 347).</page><page sequence="19">426 Pan-Sumerianism and the Veil Motif would have thought of this goddess when reading about Ruth the gleaner? The Babylonian saw in his divinity the principle of fertility, the "mistress of abundance," a sort of goddess with the cornucopia ;139 what has this picture in common with the poverty- stricken Ruth, dependent upon the generosity of the reapers for the little food which would keep her and Noemi alive? Had there been, let us say, a marvellous increase of grain brought about by Ruth's coming, only then could we begin to draw com- parisons. ad e) In two places only does the Book of Ruth mention the heroine's garments, and in neither is a veil plainly indicated. In chap. 3 :3 the garrulous Noemi, excited over her plan to get Ruth married, gives the girl unnecessary advice about her toilette. This includes putting on the simlah,140 i.e., the wide upper gar- ment which the Oriental, male and female, wears during the day and uses as a covering by night.141 Surely, this is not the mysterious veil ; had the author intended to set up a sign post for the guidance of the initiate reader, he would have chosen something more exotic than the every-day simUth. From chap. 3 : 15 it appears that Ruth wore a nnBDD. The pre- cise nature of this garment cannot be determined with certainty, to judge from the root rista and from the fact that Ruth's held some quantity of grain, it must have been rather large. Whether it was the same as the simlah ,"2 or a kind of shawl,143 or even a head-covering of some sort, it does not follow that Ruth used it to veil herself in the conventional sense. It seems that in the Palestine of the Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages women went unveiled; at least, veiling was far from the usual practice.144 That Ruth veiled her face cannot be argued from Noemi's com- mand "not to make herself known" to Booz until he have finished eating and drinking (3 :3) - there were other means of remaining 139 Kugler, loc . cit. 140 Note that the TM has the plural; if this is correct (cf. LXX), the word may be understood of clothes in a general sense. 141 Bertholet, History of Hebrew Civilization , London, 1926, p. 172 ; Kort- leitner, Archeologia Biblica , Innsbruck, 1917 (2d ed.), p. 466. 142 So Jouon, op. cit., pp. 67, 78: Kortleitner, loc. cit. 148 So Bertholet, op. cit., p. 174.

Certainly, considering the customs of the times, a veiled woman would have attracted more attention than an unveiled one. And so, after all, a veiled Ruth is still an unknown quantity. The Pan-Sumerian interpretation of the Book of Ruth has been arbitrary up to this place, but the worst is now to come. The bland statement that at midnight Ruth conceives a son from Booz, and that this is to be paralleled by the action of Lot's daughters and by Thamar's deception of Juda represents the ultimate in baseless assertion. There is no need for a detailed refutation. To justify the interpretation proposed by Jeremias the book would have to be rewritten in its entirety, Booz' ra- tional midnight conversation with Ruth (3:9 sqq.) turned into drunken mumbling, the text of chap. 4 :13 thrown out bodily, and the character of the man with his fine regard for the prior legal right of another changed into something radically different. Surely if this is the way a thesis is proved einwandfrei , then the rules of historical evidence must also be rewritten.145 ad f) What is so significant in the fact that Noemi takes upon herself the office of Obeďs nurse? Grandmothers were the same then as now, and legally Noemi stood in this relationship to the child. From AT AO, 747, s.v. |dn it would seem that the rook is to be understood of the person who rescues the redeemer child from the dangers to which it is exposed, these dangers be- ing another of the mythical motifs. But there is no reason to suppose that Obed is pictured in the motifs of the redeemer child (cf. note 145). And certainly it was inconsiderate of the hagio- grapher to supply the guardian against the dangers and then say absolutely nothing about the dangers themselves. On the contrary, the child's position is secure and his prospects the 145 The whole purpose of Jeremias* exposition is to show that the child of Booz and Noemi is delineated with the traits of the Sumerian redeemer myth - specifically with the mysterious birth motif of the redeemer child (cf. supra, p. 276 sq.). But nowhere is there any "mystery" in the birth of Obed. As the text clearly shows, he is not born of a kedesha but of an honest wife. He is evidently not àirdTCûp-àfirjTœp. There is no virgin birth; 4:13 excludes it. We cannot speak of humble origins, since Booz was one of the magnates of Bethlehem (2:1). And finally there is no reason to sup- pose that Ruth was unfruitful.</page><page sequence="21">428 Pan-Sumerianism and the Veil Motif brightest: born of a love marriage, his father a rich and in- fluential citizen of Bethlehem, nursed by a doting grandmother, no dangers are in sight for him. $ $ * * And so, neither for Sarah nor for Ruth has a mythic style been proved. Important differences between them and their alleged prototype, the Mesopotamian Mother Goddess, are disregarded by the Pan-Sumerian interpretation, and where parallels are claimed, the resemblances are very superficial indeed. And even if it should be possible to demonstrate a greater likeness, it would be necessary to prove that the sequence of the motifs146 and like- wise their motivation are the same, before one could speak of any dependence upon a Sumero-Babylonian mythic style. We think that this testing of the Sarah and Ruth accounts gives the veil motif a fair trial. Throughout the section in Schleier devoted to the Sacred Scriptures, far-fetched parallels and statements of the ipse dixit kind are scattered about with a lavish hand. For example, p. 30 offers the following. In 2 Kgs. 13:1 sqq., following the style of the Dioscuri legend, Ab- salom avenges his ravished sister Thamar, whose virginal char- acter (Virgo-Ishtar!) is emphasized. Now her garment, like that of Joseph, is called d'ds ruro, to which a glossator adds, "for such is from of old the dress of princesses." This glossator well knew that princesses are fundamentally representatives of the Mother Goddess - voilà tout! To study every case of this type in detail would require far more space than this article, already too long, affords, but in conclusion let us return to the "world-garment" concept and see whether it occurs in the Sacred Scriptures.147 146 One of the boasts of the school has always been its "total" study of related myths: "the establishment of literary borrowings in single cases leads to no result," by this means one can "group phenomena, but the living bond of union remains unrevealed" - So Jeremias in The Hibbert Journal 4 (1905) 217, criticizing Cheyne, Bible Problems ani the New Material for their Solution. The entire myth in one culture must be compared with the entire myth in another, and only when the majority of the component motifs are identical can the identity of the two myths, and consequently the dependence of .the one on the other be affirmed: thus Stucken, Astralmy- then, p. 128. These are certainly excellent principles, but apparently more honored in the breach than in the observance. 147 Schleier, p. 27 sq.</page><page sequence="22">PAN-SUMERIANISM AND THE VEIL MOTIF 429 First of all, the homely likeness in Mk. 2:21 (Mt. 9:16; Lk. 5 :36) plainly based upon the every-day life of the people, is quite arbitrarily paraphrased, "the new world that is come in me . . . is like unto a new world-garment (Weltenkleid.)" Of course, nothing of the kind appears in the text. The comparison of the heavens to a garment which grows old and to a vestment which will be changed (Ps. 102:26 sq.) is simply a figure of speech from which we cannot prove the presence of a Weltenmantel concept in Israel, and even less does it picture the heavens as "the living garment of the godhead" (so Schleier, p. 27). The same is to be said of Isa. 40:22, where Jeremias translates p'! as "veil," though all we can say about the word is that it means thin, fine cloth. Of the two members of Ps. 104:2 the first merely uses the word ncob' as one term of a comparison, while the second likens the creation of the heavens to the spread- ing out and raising of a tent.148 A tent cloth is not a garment, and the tertium comparationis seems to be the ease with which God creates the world. Jeremias himself admits that in poetical passages such as these the symbol only shimmers through, but what must first be proved is the assumption that the Hebrews knew a symbolic cosmic veil at all. What we have set down here does not intend to deny Mesopo- tamian influence upon the language and the modes of expression in which the Old Testament was written, but whatever the nature and extent of that influence, a veil motif in the Pan-Sumerian sense was certainly no part of it.149 College of St. Charles Borromeo Columbus, Ohio 148 It may be noted that in Mesopotamia the heavens probably were also seen as a tent, cf. note 111, supra . 149 Acknowledgements are due to the following publishers for courteous permission to quote from their publications: The Johns Hopkins Press, The Macmillan Company, The Oxford University Press, The Yale Univer- sity Press, The University of Chicago Press.</page></plain_text>
