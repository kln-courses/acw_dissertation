Wylie. Stanford University Press, Stanford, 1980. Continuing the Revolution: The Political Thought of Mao, by John Bryan Starr. Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1979. Mao Zedong and the Cultural Revolution, by Wang Xizhe, translated by Anthony Kwok. Plough Publications, Hong Kong, 1981. In its resolution on questions of Party history adopted in June 1981 the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) Central Committee attempts a definitive evaluation of Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.1 An official history of this kind obviously has aims other than establishing accuracy in the historical record. It is part of the CPC's constant attention to the contemporary relevance of historical interpretation. Evaluation of the Party's own history is especially important and routinely pervades all discussions of current policy. A systematic, inclusive exposition of Party history is, therefore, inseparable from definition and consolidation of a dominant political direction. Its assessment of past failures and successes directly concerns the Party's present and future course. In this respect, the Resolution is compar- able in significance to predecessors such as the official Party history adopted in 1945 or the 'two-line struggle' reinterpretation introduced during the Cultural Revolution. The Resolution's formulations were conditioned by political contention over the treatment of Mao since his death, and by other factors in the political environment; in particular, various Party sources have complained of political cynicism, loss of confidence in the Party and in socialism, and THE AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF CHINESE AFFAIRS NO.9</page><page sequence="2">154 THE AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF CHINESE AFFAIRS general ideological backsliding. The Resolution reflects a perceived connection between evaluation of Mao and maintenance of the Party's political and ideological authority. As Huang Kecheng explains: For many years, Chairman Mao was recognized by the whole world as the leader of our Party and State and the symbol of revolution. This conforms to the actual situation. Defaming and distorting Chairman Mao can only defame and distort the Party and our socialist motherland.2 Rather than denigrating Mao, therefore, the Resolution both provides a positive assessment of his revolutionary activities and insists that Mao Zedong Thought remains the Party's guiding ideology. At the same time, it introduces a number of distinctions allowing carefully focused repudiation of Mao, consistent with reversal of the political direction with which he had become associated. This is easily accomplished with respect to Mao's personal role: Mao's merits are said to outweigh his faults, and the latter arose in his later years. The Resolution's handling of Mao Zedong Thought, however, has to be a little more delicate. First, Mao Zedong Thought is depersonalised: it is seen not as the creation of an individual, but as a collective product of the integration of Marxism-Leninism with Chinese revolutionary practice. Mao was prominent in its articulation, and the extent of his contribution warrants the name; but Mao Zedong Thought had other contributors (most notably leaders such as Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai and Zhu De) and incorporates the wisdom of the whole Party and revolutionary people. Secondly, Mao Zedong Thought is separated from Mao himself: Mao's own views or statements, specifically those of his later years, can be seen as not part of, but actually inconsistent with, Mao Zedong Thought.3 Such distinctions narrow the focus of criticism to Mao's actions and views associated with the Cultural Revolution. The Resolution can thus assert the Party's continued adherence to Mao Zedong Thought untainted by Cultural Revolution aberrations. The three books under consideration, all predating the Resolution, offer differing perspectives on its evaluation of Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Wylie's analysis of the period 1935-45 relates directly to historical reconstruction of the guidance provided by Mao Zedong Thought. According to the Resolution, it was during this period that Mao Zedong Thought 'reached maturity'.4 Wylie's focus is the 'ideological and political process' through which Mao Zedong Thought was adopted as the Party's ideological standard (p.5). He skilfully combines discussions of CPC intellectual debates with analysis of the Party's internal and external political struggles. His work addresses themes of major present relevance, including the meaning and significance attached to Mao Zedong Thought and its relationship to Mao himself. While Wylie is concerned with what the Resolution has since sought to</page><page sequence="3">IDEOLOGY, AUTHORITY AND MAO'S LEGACY 155 affirm, Starr focuses on what it explicitly repudiates, Mao's theory of 'continuing the revolution'. Starr's work clearly ranks high among the best general treatments of Mao's thought. Demonstrating an impressively detailed familiarity with the whole corpus of Mao's works, Starr's analysis is both thorough and consistently insightful. He argues that the theory of continuing the revolution 'offers a view of a wide range of Mao's political ideas', and was regarded by Mao as 'the culmination of his theoretical activity' (pp.x-xi). At the time Starr was writing Mao's successors officially endorsed that assessment, but the situation is now precisely reversed. Starr's use of the theory of continuing the revolution as the focus in analysing Mao's thought challenges fundamentally the Resolution's assertion that Mao's views of his later years were entirely inconsistent with Mao Zedong Thought. Wang's work is obviously of a different order from the scholarly analyses of Wylie and Starr. A member of the Li Yizhe group which put up the famous poster 'On socialist democracy and the legal system' in Guangzhou in 1974, Wang was released from prison in 1978 but continued active publication of his views and was reportedly re-arrested in 1981. His pamphlet is stridently polemical, and there is little or no analytical merit in his assertions concerning Party history in general and Mao in particular. Nevertheless, it is interesting as the expression of a 'dissident' Chinese view which, despite some important features in common, is antithetical to the official position which was being formulated at the time Wang was writing. Wang's total negation of Mao and Mao Zedong Thought contrasts with the far more cautious approach adopted in the Resolution. And that contrast illustrates the way in which these issues are linked to questions of ideology and authority central to the official historical reinterpretation. As Wylie shows, the concept 'sinification of Marxism' provided the key for the initial adoption of Mao Zedong Thought as the Party's guiding thought. He analyses the antecedents of that concept in Party debates, especially in views expressed by Chen Boda which greatly influenced the arguments developed in Mao's writings of the late 1930s. Turning to these writings (pp.55ff), Wylie rplies on the discussion of generality and particu- larity in 'On contradiction' to argue that Mao saw Marxism-Leninism as having both a 'universal character', expressed in its designation as 'Marxism of the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution', and a 'particular character' indicated by its specifically Russian origins.5 Further, Mao says, Stalin explained that the universal character of Leninism (its Marxianness) is contained within its particular character (its Russianness). The implication then, given Mao's belief that the general and the particular character of a thing cannot be separated, is that Leninism as a theory of revolution cannot be separated from its social background.</page><page sequence="4">156 THE AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF CHINESE AFFAIRS Leninism, therefore, is the union of Marxist theory with Russian practice - "'Russified" Marxism'. Wylie further argues that the implication of Mao's position is that Leninism is more than the original form of Marxism put into a Russian idiom. Rather, it is a qualitatively different and superior form. Application of Leninism in China required a similar transformation. By 1937 Mao was 'contemplating an adaptation and development of Leninism in China's particular environment - a new theoretical synthesis, which, he seems to be suggesting, will represent a higher formulation than Leninism itself'. While noting that Mao did not refer to Leninism as 'Russified' Marxism, Wylie suggests that Mao's reasoning led to the notion of sinification articulated in his speech 'On the new stage' in 1938 (pp.89ff.). According to Wylie, Mao saw theory as composed of two distinct elements - 'scientific methodology' and 'national form'. Mao argued that there was 'no such thing as abstract Marxism, but only concrete Marxism', that is, Marxism which had taken on a national form in concrete revolutionary struggle. Wylie reinforces this national location of theory with his discussion of China's historical legacy. He quotes Mao: 'The assimilation of this legacy becomes a methodology [fangfa] that is of substantial help in directing the great movement at the present time'. Wylie interprets this as Mao introducing a second methodology, in addition to Marxism-Leninism, to guide the Chinese revolution. He notes that the two methodologies were not equally impor- tant, since it was the Marxist methodology which was to be used in evaluating China's historical legacy. But the historical legacy itself in turn became a methodology for evaluating Marxism's relevance for guiding concrete revolutionary struggle. In the process, Marxism itself would change, reaching a higher stage with richer content. Sinification, therefore, did not mean simply that Marxist-Leninist content would be 'dressed up in a new Chinese garb': Marxist-Leninist theoretical propositions would be adopted, adapted or rejected, and new theories would be created to deal with new situations in the Chinese revolution. In calling for the Sinification of Marxism-Leninism, [Mao] was rejecting the application in China of both Marxist theory (revolutionary science in a European form) and Leninist theory (revolutionary science in a Russian form), and was instead proposing the creation of a new revolutionary theory adapted to China (revolutionary science in a Chinese form). Sinification involved the same process of theoretical transformation as Marxism had undergone in Russia to produce Marxism-Leninism. Wylie analyses the elaboration of these themes in Party discussions and the further step of identifying Mao with the process of sinification to produce Mao Zedong Thought. According to Wylie's presentation, therefore, in CPC usage by 1945 Mao Zedong Thought implied a high level of</page><page sequence="5">IDEOLOGY, AUTHORITY AND MAO'S LEGACY 157 theoretical novelty: it was seen as a distinctly new theoretical development, rather than as merely the application of Marxism-Leninism in the Chinese context. Certainly Wylie is able to show that sinification was more than simply making Marxism-Leninism more accessible by putting it into a Chinese idiom, and that this involved more significant claims for the status of Mao Zedong Thought. The problem is that his interpretation exaggerates that attributed status. He tends to overstate positions advanced in Party debates, especially through drawing out too tenaciously the 'implications' of various discussions. He also pays too little attention to the notion of 'universality' which the CPC applied to Marxism-Leninism but not, at this time, to Mao Zedong Thought. In the period Wylie considers, Mao clearly focused his attacks on 'dogmatism', both because of the 'bookishness' he saw to be prevalent in the CPC and as a means of discrediting leadership rivals. The Leninist axiom 'Our theory is not dogma but a guide to action' was, therefore, extremely pertinent. But just as important as the anti-dogmatism of that axiom is the aspect of theoretical direction. Mao also condemned 'empiricism', which ignored the guidance provided by Marxist-Leninist theory. He made it clear that revolutionary practice was a special type of activity in that it was explicitly theory-directed. Wylie's suggestion that Chinese practice provided a data base for assessing Marxist-Leninist theory, therefore, misses an integral part of the notion of uniting theory and practice, since it posits a revolutionary practice independent of Marxism-Leninism as guiding theory. This relates to a point which is crucial because of Mao's emphasis on Marxism-Leninism as methodology. Wylie introduces unnecessary confusion in his discussion of China's historical legacy as a 'second methodology'. One objection to his interpretation concerns the translation of fangfa. This word, like the English 'method', may have a more general implication of 'means', or a more specific implication of a scientific analytical system, which can be rendered as 'methodology'. Although the word may have either connotation, I would suggest that, in Mao's argument, Marxism-Leninism is seen as 'methodology' while the more general implication applies in his discussion of historical legacy. In support of this, it should be noted that Wylie slightly misconstrues Mao's statement. Mao says not that the legacy itself, but 'the assimilation of this legacy', provides a method. There is only one methodology, Marxism-Leninism, and the assimilation of the Chinese legacy is an instance of its application. This interpretation receives some negative corroboration from Mao's lack of systematic discussion of Chinese history. His works contain references to critical evaluation of China's past, and frequent references to and brief discussions of Chinese history. But there is nothing approaching the attention to 'historical legacy' surely to be expected if he were suggesting something so central as a 'second methodology'.</page><page sequence="6">158 THE AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF CHINESE AFFAIRS A further problem concerns Wylie's equation between Mao Zedong Thought as 'sinified' Marxism-Leninism and Leninism as 'Russified' Marxism. He is suggesting the imposition of national parameters of revolutionary theory, a position which Marx and Lenin at least surely would have rejected. And the CPC Central Committee itself asserted in 1943 that 'Marxism-Leninism is science, and science has no national boundaries'.6 According to Wylie, Mao Zedong Thought implied creation of a new, indigenous revolutionary theory to replace the foreign Marxism-Leninism. This he links to the CPC's efforts to reinforce its nationalist credentials in competition with the Guomindang. An alternative interpretation, however, is that sinification concerned the nationalisation not of theory but of the sphere of its application. The general point was that revolutionary, theory always had to be integrated with concrete practice. In the specific case facing the CPC, that practice took on a national definition as it involved the activities of a party nationally based and seeking to lead a movement dealing with a range of issues focused within China itself. But this did not imply the necessity of nationally distinct theory. When Mao argued that there was no 'abstract Marxism' but only 'concrete Marxism', he was stressing that regarding theory as an object of contemplation was illegitimate and negated Marxism itself. Theory became significant only when it assumed specific content by integration with a concrete practice, which currently assumed a national form. Rejection of 'abstract Marxism' was not inconsistent with maintaining that Marxism-Leninism provided 'universal truths', valid irrespective of time and place. While Wylie several times notes the universality attributed to Marxism-Leninism, his argument that Leninism was regarded as 'Russified' Marxism focuses on the specificity of its Russian origins. This rests on implications he draws from certain texts. But at least as significant as these potential implications is the fact that the texts did not advance to the conclusions Wylie draws. This might be explained in terms of the CPC's sensitivity to relations with the international communist movement, but it also suggests that Wylie has read too much into Chinese discussions. This again relates to the argument concerning national parameters of theory. If sinification did not mean production of a Chinese revolutionary theory, so, conversely, Leninism was not seen as nationally specific and confined by its Russian origins. As Mao explained, the contributors to Marxism-Leninism did so on the basis of practice, and they formulated 'general conclusions drawn from historical and revolutionary reality'.7 Although Mao was here insisting on the need to study Chinese conditions, he also affirmed the generality of Marxism-Leninism, which transcended its origins. Marxism- Leninism was much more than 'Russified' Marxism, while 'sinification' had a narrower connotation of application of a universally valid theoretical system.</page><page sequence="7">IDEOLOGY, AUTHORITY AND MAO'S LEGACY 159 While Wylie shows how sinification related to CPC ideological and political currents, and especially to the 'nationalist' impetus in Chinese politics, it should also be noted that it was a process reinforced by contemporary trends in the international communist movement. For example, Dimitroff,8 general secretary of the Communist International, strongly advocated integrating theory with national characteristics at the Comintern Congress in 1935. He condemned reliance on 'lifeless formulas and ready-made patterns', and argued for 'national forms' of class struggle. In passages which the CPC later included in its Zhengfeng documents, he emphasised that 'national forms' required more than adaptation to- particular idioms and involved a more creative process of integrating theory and practice. Mao also recognised that such integration was not unique to sinification. In his 'On the new stage', he complained that the CPC lagged behind the parties of other countries in using Marxism-Leninism as a guide to action;9 and in his response to the dissolution of the Comintern in 1943, he spoke of the further 'making national' (minzuhua) of each country's communist party,' 0 indicating that sinification was merely one example of 'making national'. Sinification was also reinforced by one of the principal conclusions of the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This work rejected rote learning of 'isolated conclusions and propositions from the works of Marx, Engels and Lenin' in the hope that they would 'suit each and every situation and occasion'. Rather, Marxist-Leninist theory had to be 'the science of the development of society'. In a passage very similar to Mao's position, the text distinguished the 'letter' and 'substance' of Marxism-Leninism, equating the latter with mastery of theory. And it also urged the need for theoretical modification. Mastering the Marxist-Leninist theory means being able to enrich this theory with the new experience of the revolutionary movement, with new propositions and conclusions, it means being able to develop it and advance it without hesitating to replace - in accordance with the substance of the theory - such of its propositions and conclusions as have become antiquated by new ones corresponding to the new historical situation.1 1 Undoubtedly, any CPC leadership was constrained by necessary recogni- tion of Moscow's ideological preeminence, but such a formulation in a source of impeccable orthodoxy could be used to support the concept 'sinification'. It certainly did not preclude theoretical innovation according to differences in environment and revolutionary practice. Innovation did not require the notion of Mao Zedong Thought as a distinctly new theoretical system, but could be based on creative application of Marxism- Leninism itself. This was enough to justify claims of Mao's theoretical contributions as in the list provided by Liu Shaoqi: New Democracy,</page><page sequence="8">160 THE AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF CHINESE AFFAIRS emancipation of the peasantry, revolutionary united front, revolutionary wars and so on.12 And it was also possible to claim that the 'Mao Zedong road' defined by these contributions might be applicable to similar situations, to national liberation movements in colonial and semi-colonial areas. 1 3But such innovation was at a lower level than, and derivative from, Marxism-Leninism as the universal guiding theory of a whole historical epoch. Wylie's emphasis on theoretical novelty in this early period may obscure the major change which occurred in the 1960s, when Mao Zedong Thought came to be seen as a qualitative advance in revolutionary theory, correspond- ing to a new historical epoch. In the Cultural Revolution, Mao's followers claimed that he had formulated a set of universal truths concerning questions of socialist revolution not confronted or resolved by his predecessors. His theory of continuing the revolution was interpreted as a distinctly new stage in Marxist-Leninist theory, and generally applicable rather than restricted to Chinese conditions. One difficulty in analysing this theory concerns the sources which must be used in discussing Mao's later views. There are problems of how to treat official documents not published under Mao's name but said to express his position, and of what weight should be given to the contents of unofficial compilations of Mao's works released during the Cultural Revolution. While' these compilations may be more revealing of Mao's position because they are free of editorial sanitisation, they may also contain provocative over- statement, advancement of opinions soon abandoned, and general lack of considered reflection. Starr's handling of these sources inspires confidence because of its rigour, relying on a comprehensive reading rather than eclectic use of quotations. Nevertheless, difficulties with sources reflect a more fundamental problem - the extent to which Mao's views might be seen as constituting a 'theory' of continuing the revolution. Chinese sources vigorously affirmed such a theory in the 1960s and 1970s, and have more recently just as vigorously rejected it, but in both cases without explaining what it entailed apart from some general propositions such as the protractedness of class struggle in socialist society. As Starr notes, Mao himself nowhere provides an integrated exposition of his supposed theory. His discussions are, at best, episodic; they rarely go beyond descriptive or assertive comments concerning China or other socialist societies, linked together loosely by a notion of class struggle. Consequently, many students of Chinese political thought, seeking to analyse the theory of continuing the revolution, have adopted a synthetic method: they have mined Mao's tantalising works, attempting to clarify and make coherent his fragmented arguments.'4 Starr's book is the most extended study of this kind. He provides a penetrating analysis of a wide range of Mao's views. But he does not give a</page><page sequence="9">IDEOLOGY, AUTHORITY AND MAO'S LEGACY 161 single statement of the main points of the theory of continuing the revolution. Rather, he analyses 'the political themes, concepts, and ideas on which it is based and from which it proceeds' (p.xi). In effect, by asserting connection between the theory and the political themes he discusses, Starr explains the theory by circumstantial means. Adopting the theory of continuing the revolution as the focus of his work, he links the various substantial discussions to that focus, thereby investing the theory with a perhaps spurious substance. Thus, it might be suggested that he in fact constructs the theory for Mao. The problem here is not merely that this may be too generous to Mao, validating the credentials of what was said to be the 'culmination of his theoretical activity'. It may also disguise the confusion and inconsistencies in Mao's views, and the implications of his failure in theoretical development. This is illustrated with respect to the notion of class struggle which, as Starr shows, is crucial to a theory of continuing the revolution and which is an area where Mao's emphases have been drastically revised by the present leadership. Starr's analysis shows how Mao's views on class changed over time, and especially his concern with class struggle in socialist society from the early 1960s. He suggests that Mao had a multicausal view of class struggle, identifying economic, political and ideological sources of embourgeoisement. Given Starr's sophisticated analysis, I cannot here dispute his interpretation of these various aspects of Mao's views. Suffice it to say that Starr does find warrant in Mao's works for the notions of embourgeoisement he discusses. This might suggest that Mao's views were based on his observations of a complex range of issues in China and other socialist countries, that his theory was derived from revolutionary practice. The various views of class struggle Mao advances, however, are not linked in any systematic fashion. His views on this fundamental aspect of his supposed theory are, moreover, implicitly inconsistent. The claim that Mao had introduced a new stage of revolutionary theory pertained specifically to his handling of formerly unresolved questions concerning continuing the revolution in socialist society. Yet Mao's works contain no coherent analysis of the nature of Chinese society, nor of the process of socialist transition. Indeed, it is possible to construct different analyses on these crucial issues from Mao's writings. One such analysis sees the transformation of the ownership system as establishing a socialist system, with the danger of revolutionary reversal deriving from vestigial elements of overthrown classes and remnant political and ideological influences. Another analysis which may be constructed from Mao's works, however, implicitly rejects the notion of establishment of a distinct socialist system; rather, it sees socialist transition as the process of negation of the capitalist mode of production, with the danger of revolutionary reversal deriving from a material basis allowing regeneration of classes and of class ideology and</page><page sequence="10">162 THE AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF CHINESE AFFAIRS political activity. These conceptions of socialist society entail quite different views of class struggle, and each includes economic, political and ideological dimensions of that struggle. Thus, simply pointing to multi- causality in Mao's views on embourgeoisement disguises the inconsistency among these views arising because he did not attempt to deal adequately with the central question of the nature of socialist society. This is further illustrated in Starr's discussion of Mao's behavioural view of class: ... what he appears to have done is to have abstracted from the historical experience of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie certain characteristic modes of behavior and points of view of members of those two classes. Taking these behavior patterns as modal types, he then contended that the class of an individual can be ascertained by categorizing his or her behavior and outlook as falling within one or the other type. He went beyond that to suggest that there is a universal, human tendency for individuals to move in a retrograde direction between these two behavioral categories if they are left to them- selves ... a universal human tendency toward the reestablishment of political and economic inequality, presumably through the pursuit of individual self- interest. (pp.242-43) Certainly, Starr is not without evidence to support this interpretation; and he does not claim that it exhausts Mao's views. But it shows Mao lapsing into a form of analysis difficult to regard as Marxist. And far from depending upon analysis of the nature of socialist society, it was based on a notion of human nature which Mao himself had explicitly rejected. There are, therefore, serious problems in using Mao's works to construct a theory of continuing revolution. This is not simply because Mao himself did not coherently articulate his position, and 'theory' may be a too elevated term for his fragmentary discussions. More importantly, these discussions show Mao's various positions to be ambiguous and inconsistent. They suggest not that Mao was groping towards a theory which he did not manage to articulate, but that he operated with different implicit theoretical perspectives, the incompatibility of which did not become clearer largely because they remained undeveloped. Mao's supposed new stage in Marxism- Leninism, relating to the socialist revolution, was flawed in the central aspect of analysis of the nature of socialist society. The theory of continuing the revolution may be not so much the culmination of Mao's theoretical activity as camouflage for his theoretical failure. This is not to suggest, of course, that Mao's views did not have a profound political effect in China. They were extremely provocative, especially during the Cultural Revolution. But rather than using the Cultural Revolution to exemplify the theory of continuing the revolution, as Starr does, it is also possible to see it as illustrating the ambiguity inherent in Mao's various statements. This relates most obviously to the different interpretations of class struggle during the movement, differences which were linked to political conflict as competing groups found support in Mao Zedong</page><page sequence="11">IDEOLOGY, AUTHORITY AND MAO'S LEGACY 163 Thought for often mutually antagonistic positions. And the interpretation of the theory of continuing the revolution continued to have immediate political implications during the 1970s. The matter has, of course, been definitively resolved in the recent official repudiation of the theory. It is no longer relevant how Mao's views in the 1960s concerning class struggle in socialist society should be interpreted, since all interpretations are simply rejected as reflecting mistakes Mao made in his later years. Starr's excellent analysis of Mao's views shows that this means abandoning the core aspects of Mao's political thought of that period. Despite the ambiguities inherent in Mao Zedong Thought in different periods, both Wylie and Starr show how its identification as the Party's ideological standard was inextricably connected with Mao's own role. Whether or not Wylie's views on theoretical novelty are accepted, he certainly demonstrates how Mao Zedong Thought became the exclusive expression of Chinese Marxism-Leninism. It was seen as the sole application, rather than one application, of guiding revolutionary theory in China. Wylie argues that this was neither accidental nor inevitable, but a result of conscious effort by Mao, Chen and others. In discussing the reasons for adopting the term Mao Zedong sixiang, he suggests that there was a desire to escape from the foreignness associated with zhuyi ('ism'); sixiang (thought) is a distinctly Chinese term.1 5 Further, sixiang 'is an anthropomorphic term that fully reflects its vital link with a real, live human being, a specific flesh-and-blood individual - in this case Mao Tse-tung - who is engaged in the continuing process of thought' (p.212).1 6 Wylie's analysis of the Party's internal politics documents carefully the manner in which the connections were forged between sinification, Mao Zedong Thought and Mao's leader- ship. Thus, Mao's position was bolstered by personal ideological authority. As Wylie notes, Chen Boda also suggested a type of organic connection between Mao and the Party whereby the Party depended on the role of Mao and vice versa (p.243). Such a view was also evident in Liu Shaoqi's speech on the Party Constitution in 1945, despite his insistence that Mao was a model of propriety in behaving as an ordinary Party member.17 Wylie's study of these political ramifications of sinification demonstrates that the recent official collectivisation of Mao Zedong Thought reverses the implications it had at the time of its first formulation. Mao was able to exert the political force of his own authority by means such as applying labels of ideological deviation which could discredit opponents. But the personalisation of guiding ideology was extended and qualitatively changed during the Cultural Revolution. Starr analyses this change in his chapter 'On authority'. He argues that the distinction Mao drew throughout his career between enemies and friends in revolution was not a dualistic position since it implied a 'revolutionary "we"' - 'an individual or group that has succeeded in becoming an authoritative</page><page sequence="12">164 THE AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF CHINESE AFFAIRS participant in and arbiter of the conflict between friends and enemies in a revolutionary situation' (p.72). Starr's discussion of Mao's criteria of legitimacy in terms of 'stand, viewpoint and method' incorporates factors such as the mass line and direct contact between leaders and led, revolu- tionary and other experience, class identification, absence of selfishness and so on. This is particularly relevant to the role of the Party. Starr argues that Mao accepted the Leninist view of the Party's legitimate authority, but that such acceptance was conditional. He sees the questioning of the legitimacy of the Party's role as an important part of Mao's thinking after the late 1950s, and quite rightly relates this to the development of the Cultural Revolution. It was at this time that Mao drew heavily on his personal authority. While noting that the personality cult conflicted with Mao's own criteria of legitimacy, Starr argues that 'Mao realised the need for a new, temporary locus of legitimacy in the Chinese system if the legitimacy of the Party (or at least of certain of its leaders) were to be called into question and its errors rectified'. The personality cult, therefore, was 'a less than desirable but necessary consequence of launching an attack from the basis of his own personal legitimacy as a leader of the Chinese revolution' (p.94). The Cultural Revolution placed Mao's personal authority over all other forms of political authority, including the Party itself. This was reinforced by the 'two-line struggle' notion, which recreated Party history as a battle between Mao's ever-correct leadership and a whole series of erroneous positions. And however ill-defined and ambiguous, the theory of continuing the revolution was completely stamped with Mao's authority. Since Mao's death, this Cultural Revolution legacy has been handled in different ways. One was the lack-lustre personality cult of Hua Guofeng, since criticised in the Resolution. Like Lin Biao before him, Hua sought to harness Mao's authority, establishing his own position derived from alleged personal and ideological fidelity to Mao and relying on Mao's explicit sanction. At the same time, there was no suggestion that Mao's views could be challenged. The attacks on the 'Gang of Four' emphasised interpretation of Mao's views, and specifically of the theory of continuing the revolution. Mao Zedong Thought was a complete 'scientific system' which had to be used compre- hensively and accurately, in contrast to the tactics of distortion and dogmatic isolation of quotations from context which Lin Biao and the 'Gang of Four' had allegedly used for their nefarious schemes.1 8 The lack of coherence in Mao's theory of continuing the revolution provided ample scope for waging this type of attack on the 'Gang of Four'. By 1978, however, the identification of Party ideology, Mao's authority and the theory of continuing the revolution came under direct attack. The battle between the 'whatever' and 'practice' factions had ramifications beyond immediate policy issues: the manner in which the 'two whatevers' were castigated by their victorious opponents put the focus directly on</page><page sequence="13">IDEOLOGY, AUTHORITY AND MAO'S LEGACY 165 Mao's continuing influence.' 9 The triumphant official formulation, based on 'practice is the sole criterion of truth', rejected consistency with Mao's views as a policy standard. There were increasingly vigorous attacks on Mao's cult of personality. It was emphasised that Party history should not be reduced to the personal history of the leader, let alone be seen as a process of his 'ideological self-expression'.2O Official sources, rather than bothering with questions of interpretation, explicitly repudiated core aspects of the theory of continuing the revolution, especially the centrality of class struggle in socialist society. The Cultural Revolution view that Mao Zedong Thought represented a 'peak', or a distinctly new stage of revolutionary theory, was rejected. While Mao had 'developed' Marxism, that development was not a matter of 'resolving questions not encountered, raised or resolved by Marx, Engels and Lenin', but simply of proceeding according to different historical conditions and practice.21 Further, Mao's theory of continuing the revolution did not involve 'mistakes in just some individual problems'. Rather, its theses were entirely inconsistent with both Marxism-Leninism and Chinese reality, and led to the 'complete mistake' of the Cultural Revolution.22 The Resolution consummated the process of severing Mao's authority and his views from any necessary connection with Party ideology. It performed the task so thoroughly that it went beyond eliminating the Cultural Revolution form of this connection, demonstrated by Starr, to rejection of the earlier form of personalisation of ideology analysed by Wylie. Never- theless, ideological formulae developed in the 1940s have been preserved; thus, Mao Zedong Thought is seen as the integration of universal Marxist- Leninist principles with Chinese practice, and the need for resisting dogmatism and for adaptation to China's particular environment has been re-stressed. Indeed, recent discussions of Mao Zedong Thought suggest an emphasis on theoretical originality (duchuangxing de lilun)23 greater than that implied in the 1940s. Further adherence to Mao Zedong Thought involves the same sort of theoretical initiative, which can be achieved without a figure such as Mao. The Party need not be restricted by anything formerly associated with Mao or Mao Zedong Thought but must 'enrich and develop our Party's theory with new principles and new conclusions conforming to practice'.24 Hence, Mao Zedong Thought is rendered very plastic, more readily suited to present and future policy. Thus, the official historical reinterpretation allows unqualified affirmation of Mao Zedong Thought and selective affirmation of Mao's own merits, according to strict distinctions between Mao and Mao Zedong Thought and between different periods in Mao's career. Wang Xizhe's approach, by contrast, is antagonistic to any such distinctions and completely negates Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. A principal focus of his work is embittered rejection of the Cultural Revolution. But any resemblance this has to the</page><page sequence="14">166 THE AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF CHINESE AFFAIRS official position is superficial since, ironically, Wang's pamphlet in many ways continues the types of arguments used in the Cultural Revolution itself. In particular, Wang maintains a 'two-line struggle' interpretation of Party history. He places Mao prominently in a demonology encompassing the whole international communist movement. The central factor here is Stalinism. Wang condemns Mao as the defender of Stalinism, while praising othlers for opposing it, especially Tito (as a 'hero') and Khrushchev (as a 'dwarf'). In discussing CPC history, he develops a consistent, although very crudely argued, theme of the conflict between 'democracy' and 'bureaucracy'. His two-line struggle interpretation is a simple inversion of that advanced in the Cultural Revolution: it is similarly Mao-centric, but with Mao's always incorrect position being opposed by the Party's genuine Marxists, including Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping and Peng Dehuai. Although he largely avoids use of the term 'class struggle', Wang's position is very similar to one which has recently been strongly repudiated in the Chinese press - that the bureaucracy forms an exploiting class in socialist society. Another Cultural Revolution continuity is striking here, as Wang explicitly recognises when he refers favourably to documents produced in 1967 by the Hunan 'ultra-"leftist"' group, Shengwulian.25 These documents attacked the 'bureaucratic class' allegedly undermining the Cultural Revolution. Although strongly criticised by Cultural Revolution leaders, they presented a variant of the theory of continuing the revolution which found support in some of Mao's statements. Wang acknowledges that Mao made statements of this kind, but dismisses them as simply deceptive. He claims that the Shengwulian was mistaken in focusing attacks on Zhou Enlai, since Mao himself was the chief representative of the bureaucrats. According to Wang, Party history is simply a power struggle through which Mao sought to defend his supreme position against the Party democrats. Mao considered that the Stalinist system of Party and state was not sufficiently autocratic. His disruption of that system in the Cultural Revolution was not anti-bureaucratic but reactionary - a cynical abuse of the mass movement in order to defeat his personal rivals, enhance his own power and set up a 'Mao Zedong fascist party'. The only positive assessment of Mao concerns his role in guiding the revolutionary victory of 1949, especially through resisting Stalin's influence. But this does not imply any theoretical contribution, since Wang goes on to assert that the revolution was no more than a peasant uprising, with Mao as a national hero only in the sense that he was the greatest peasant leader in Chinese history. Like his predecessors, Mao sought to establish himself as the new emperor. The theory and practice of Mao's authoritarian rule after 1949 was what Wang calls 'agro-socialism'.26 Relying on the enthusiasm of ignorant peasants, Mao sought to create a utopia from China's rural</page><page sequence="15">IDEOLOGY, AUTHORITY AND MAO'S LEGACY 167 backwardness. Violating the immutable laws of economic development, which Wang interprets to be the substance of Marxist theory, Mao attempted to direct the economy as if issuing military commands. And this reinforced his personal power as the source of the enthusiastic drive for agro-socialism and of the command decisions which replaced economic laws. For Wang, the question of Mao Zedong Thought's theoretical contributions does not arise, since everything in Mao's career is reduced to his struggle for personal power or his peasant consciousness. Wang's version of the two-line struggle is as ludicrously simplistic as the Cultural Revolution version, and there is little analysis supporting his 2 7 assertions. He remains content with resounding attacks on the bureau- cratic system and maldistribution of power and privilege. A similar analytical poverty applies to his promotion of 'democracy' as the panacea for overcoming the bureaucratic system. He refers constantly to 'the people' as political actors, although it is not clear whether this includes the peasantry, of whom he is rather contemptuous. And 'democracy' becomes a very capacious concept, including inner-Party matters such as collective leadership and proper methods of criticism, the Paris Commune model, all forms of election systems and types of mass movements. In Wang's hands it is no more than a vague symbol of his discontent. But he sees that the two- line struggle has not disappeared with the death of Mao and the purge of the 'Gang of Four', and continues in the present battles between the Party's 'democratic reformers' and 'opportunist bureaucrats'. Wang's position is consistent with official formulations in some aspects, such as emphasis on modernisation according to 'objective economic laws' and rejection of the Cultural Revolution, and he also directly supports those he takes to be the 'democratic reformers' in the Party leadership. But the contrasts are more striking, both in his implicit maintenance of a type of analysis deriving from the Cultural Revolution and in his explicit negation of Mao. While Wang suggests continuing two-line struggle, the Party leadership has stressed political stability. It has advocated administrative reforms and has condemned privileges and 'bureaucratism', but has resisted any notion of a continuing struggle against bureaucracy defined as an antagonistic class, of which the Party would be a principal component. And it has carefully avoided anything which, like Wang's pamphlet, is so broadly dismissive of the Party's revolutionary experience with which Mao was so closely identified. It is difficult to judge whether Wang is representative in the depth of his disillusioned reaction against Mao; indeed, he directs his pamphlet towards young people who still revere Mao's thought, and implies that this failing is widespread. But given Mao's former centrality in Chinese politics, treatment of his legacy must be relevant to the problems of political cynicism and loss of Party authority which Chinese sources have recently admitted. The contrast with Wang emphasises the delicacy of the official</page><page sequence="16">168 THE AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF CHINESE AFFAIRS response to this situation - affirming Mao's merits associated with the Party's achievements while limiting criticism to 'mistakes' which can be associated with causes of present cynicism, and maintaining the authority of Mao Zedong Thought but separating it from Mao himself so that it can depart from much of the content of Mao's views and be adapted to new policy directions. NOTES 1 'Resolution on certain questions of Party history since the founding of the People's Republic of China' (hereafter 'Resolution'), Hongqi, 13 (1981) 3-27. That the Resolution remains the definitive evaluation has been confirmed by Hu Yaobang in his Report to the Twelfth National Party Congress, where he claims that it 'marked the Party successfully completing setting things to rights in guiding ideology'; Renmin ribao, 8 September 1982, p.1. 2 Jiefangjun bao [Liberation Army Daily], 10 April 1981, in BBC Summary of World Broadcasts Part 3 The Far East (hereafter SWB), FE/6699/BII/9. 3 While the emphasis is on Mao's mistakes in his 'later years', a speech Mao delivered to a preparatory meeting before the Seventh Congress in 1945 is used to illustrate his ready admission that he had committed many mistakes in earlier periods; see 'Working principles of the "Seventh Congress"', Hongqi, 14 (1981), 8. Mao's admission is used to reinforce the exclusion of his mistakes from Mao Zedong Thought; see Zhang Bizhi, 'There is an essential difference between Mao Zedong Thought and Comrade Mao Zedong's mistakes of his later years', Beijing ribao, 3 August 1981, in the Chinese People's University's Fuyin baokan ziliao [Reprints of Press Materials] series Zhongguo gongchandang [Chinese Communist Party], 16 (1981), 53-4. Zhang also draws a parallel with Marxism, which was not Marx' individual creation and excluded his mistakes. 4 'Resolution', p.19. The text actually states that Mao Zedong Thought 'reached maturity' in the latter part of the Agrarian Revolutionary War period and the Anti- Japanese War period. 5 The use of 'On contradiction' raises a textual problem significant for Wylie's argument because it deals with the temporal development of Mao's views. Wylie notes that the views of Mao which he is analysing here appeared in the published version of 'On contradiction' in 1952 but may not have been included in the original lectures (p.56). Indeed, a translation of a pre-Liberation text of 'On contradiction' does not contain the passages on which Wylie primarily bases his argument: Nick Night, Mao Zedong's 'On Contradiction': An Annotated Translation of the Pre- Liberation Text (Griffith Asian Papers no.3, Griffith University, Brisbane, 1981), p.24 and n.141. For analysis of this text and discussion of its dating, see also Knight's 'Mao Zedong's On Contradiction and On Practice: pre-Liberation texts', The China Quarterly, 84 (December 1980), 641-60. If the key passages used by Wylie were added in the 1950s, this casts doubt on Wylie's use of them in his discussion of the development of the concept of 'sinification' in the late 1930s.</page><page sequence="17">IDEOLOGY, AUTHORITY AND MAO'S LEGACY 169 6 'Chinese Communist Party Central Committee resolution concerning the motion of the Communist International Executive Committee chairman to dissolve the Communist International', in Takeuchi Minoru (ed.), Mao Zedong ji [Collected Writings of Mao Zedong] (10 vols, Tokyo, 1970-71), vol.

He argues that Schurmann's distinction is based on mistranslation of the formulation concerning guiding ideology at the Seventh Congress. He also argues that in Chinese sources of the 1940s the distinction between 'pure' and 'practical' would be regarded as 'quite arbitrary and a misrepresentation of the integrated unity inherent in Mao's thought' (pp.210-11, 273-74); cf Franz Schurmann, Ideology and Organization in Communist China (rev. edn., University of California Press, Berkeley, 1968), pp.24ff. 16 Wylie uses Hsiung to support this point, although he does not adopt the notion of sixiang as an 'independent variable that bridges consciousness and matter, unifies theory and practice, and extends beyond the human world', absent from the works of Marx and Lenin, with which Hsiung confuses his readers; see James Chieh Hsiung, Ideology and Practice (Praeger, New York, 1970), p.136. 17 'On the Party', Liu Shaoqixuanji, pp.319, 340-41.</page><page sequence="18">170 THE AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF CHINESE AFFAIRS 18 SWB FE/5667/BII/3-5; Party History Research Group of the Chinese Museum of History, 'Develop the Party's fine style of study', Renmin ribao, 2 November 1977, p.2. 1 9 Brantly Womack, 'Politics and epistemology in China since Mao', The China Quarterly, 80 (December 1979), 768-92. 20 Yang Zhenya, 'Correctly reflect the history of Party struggle', Renmin ribao, 27 November 1979, p.3; Li Honglin, 'The leader and the people', Renmin ribao, 18 September 1980, p.5 and 19 September 1980, p.5. 21 Ma Zhongyang, 'Kang Sheng's theory of "development" and modern superstition', Honggi, 18 (1980), 26. It is interesting that this article attributes the notion that Mao had introduced a new stage of revolutionary theory to Kang, and that he had supposedly advanced it since 1957, long preceding its use by Lin Biao in PLA ideological campaigns in the early 1960s. 22 Wu Lu, 'This kind of distinction is completely necessary', Renmin ribao, 24 July 1981, p.4; 'Resolution', pp.12,14. 23 'Resolution', p.19. 24 ibid., p.24. 25 Translations of the documents, and of criticisms of them, are collected in Klaus Mehnert, Peking and the New Left: At Home and A broad (China Research Monographs no.4, University of California, Berkeley, 1968). 26 For a refutation of the view that the CPC had been engaged in 'agrarian socialism' rather than Marxist scientific socialism, see Xue Xin, 'Scientific socialism or agrarian socialism?', Social Sciences in China, III:1 (March 1982), 70-93. But see also the article by Wang Hongzhi, 'Transformation of peasant leaders is an historical certainty', reprinted from Lilun yu shijian in Renmin ribao, 24 March 1981, p.5, which argues that leaders of peasant movements could not escape from feudal influences. 27 The argument in this pamphlet is so crude that it compares badly with the Li Yizhe document 'On socialist democracy and the legal system', Chinese Law and Government, X:3 (Fall, 1977), and also with another essay by Wang in which the handling of political concepts is much more sophisticated: 'For a return to genuine Marxism in China', New Left Review, 121 (May-June 1980), 3 3-48.</page></plain_text>
