<plain_text><page sequence="1">Five Centuries of Religion. By G. G. Coulton. Vol. I. St. Bernard, his predecessors and successors, 1000-1200 a.d. Pp. xliii, 578. 8vo. Cambridge : The University Press. 1923. This is the first instalment of a series of three volumes in which Mr. Coulton aspires to write from the original sources a general account of medieval monasticism. His title page shows that he treats of * religion ' in the medieval sense, that is, monasticism, though he hopes in later volumes to deal with other religious currents during the five centuries, 1000 to 1500, to which he limits his survey. The book is planned on large and compre hensive lines. It need hardly be said how useful a general synthesis of medieval monastic history would be, and what admirable courage in these days of minute specialisation is shown by a single scholar who dares to make such an attempt. Mr. Coulton has many high qualifications for the ambitious scheme which he has envisaged, and which he has, he tells us, nearly carried to completion. He is a man of very wide learning, who has at his fingers' ends many medieval texts, foreign even more than British, and he shows care and accuracy in his use of them. He has concentrated his studies for many years on this particular field, and is not overwhelmed by the mass of material which he has collected. He writes also with immense sincerity and conviction, has something of the fervour of the missionary, and is always thoroughly in earnest. He has the power, too, of combining his texts to form vivid pictures, so that his work is always interesting and alive. Yet despite these high gifts this volume cannot be accepted as a true study either of medieval monasticism or of medieval religion. It is not, to put it bluntly, history at all. It is an able and eloquent anti-clerical pamphlet on a colossal scale. Mr. Coulton has convinced himself that medieval Catholicism is a very evil thing, and that monasticism is even worse, because it is the most characteristic embodiment of the medieval</page><page sequence="2">320 Coulton : Five Centuries of Religion point of view. He is, therefore, out to prove how at all times and at all seasons medieval religion is something hideous, superstitious, and untrue. More than a third of the book has no special relation to monasticism at all. The * popular anthropomorphism and Tritheism,' the i dualism,' the 1 devil worship,' the * doctrine of Transubstantiation,' ' Mariolatry,' and * the low status of medieval woman,' on which Mr. Coulton discourses, were not modes of thought limited to monks and friars, but were widely accepted in non-monastic circles throughout most of the Middle Ages. And it is not fair to treat ignorant travesties of orthodoxy as on the same plane as the doctrine of the Eucharist. When we have worked through this gloomy delineation of medieval faith, we get to ?t. Benedict, St. Bernard, and other matters more nearly related to Mr. Coulton's subject, but the black picture is still drawn with the same indiscriminating pencil. A few perfunctory tributes to the greatness and goodness of St. Bernard, a few remarks that Mr. Coulton is more concerned with the popular manifestations of medieval religion than with its theoretical basis, do little to redress the balance. Inciden tally the discerning historian will gain much valuable information from Mr. Coulton's wide learning and vivid way of putting things, but he who studies medieval history for the first time will be both confused and misled. It is better that history should not be written at all than written in such a spirit. This is a hard thing to say, but Mr. Coulton, who is candour itself, will appreciate candour in others. Mr. Coulton prides himself on his accuracy and scholarship, and challenges his critics to deny any of his specific statements. All medievalists will recognise the dark sides of medieval religion and life, its grimness, its squalor, its violence, its superstitions, and its crudity. They will agree with Mr. Coulton in repudiating the poetic visions of an ideal age of faith whose literary embodiments provoke his wrath and indignation. Even allowing that much of what Mr. Coulton says may well be substantially true, the falseness of the picture drawn by him remains equally glaring. There is another and a better side to medieval life of which Mr. Coulton seems almost unconscious. The first business of an historian is understanding and sympathy. He must, for the time at least, ignore the present and find his spiritual home in the past. He must not trouble himself overmuch about Cardinal Gasquet or Mr. Belloc or Mr. Wells, or any other of Mr. Coulton's favourite aversions. He must try to see how the men of his period thought and felt. He need not share their views. He may loathe the monastic ideal and disbelieve in Catholic theology and in all organised ecclesiastical systems, but, if he would appreciate the Middle Ages rightly, he must understand how it was that at certain periods a common impulse to the cloister profoundly moved the best minds in Europe, and drove them to adopt the life for which Mr. Coulton has such holy horror. He must realise that there was a good as well as a bad side to monasticism. He must appreciate how much of the best of the civilisation that we now enjoy has its roots in the Middle Ages. But to Mr. Coulton sympathy with medieval ideals would be traffic with evil. His burning zeal, his righteous anger, prevent him from seeing more than one side of the question. Accordingly he has in these days, when so</page><page sequence="3">Habakkuk Bisset's Rolment of Courtis 321 much is talked about history as a science, set forth an essentially unscientific work as a contribution to historical learning. It is not easy to condemn so fundamentally a book based on so much knowledge and labour as is Mr. Coulton's study, but it is only right, as our author would be the first to admit, to tell the plain truth. It is lamentable that a man of Mr. Coulton's high character and great powers should feel it a religious duty to publish such a book, and it is much to be desired that his conscience would allow him to desert propaganda and devote his learning to writing real history. But with the didactic motive so strongly expressed in his own book, Mr. Coulton must forgive a review which in the sincere flattery of imitation has dropped into a somewhat homiletic strain. T. F.
