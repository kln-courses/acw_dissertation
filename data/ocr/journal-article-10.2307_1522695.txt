Until re- cently, these conditions threatened to postpone discussion and possible solution of many of the most vital problems of Six Dynasties non-Buddhist art. Fortunately, China's "reopening" in I971 marked a new era, not only in international politics but also in the study of Chinese art. A staggering amount of new archaeological evidence has poured out of China, including a small number of major Six Dynasties finds. These new discoveries, coupled with known materials and recent publications by scholars, promise eventual answers to many key questions of the period. Although familiar to scholars since I959, the importance of the Teng-hsien tomb has been underlined by the recent finds. This monograph, which began as a dissertation in 1974, eval- uates all aspects of the tomb in the context of previously known and newly excavated material. The author has given in to the temptation, often faced by art historians, of categorizing stylistic changes, notably in Chapter II, Construction of the Tomb, and Chapter IV, Pottery Figurines. Such an approach can lead to gross generalizations or oversimplification but can also be a valuable tool in dealing with a period as complex as the Six Dynasties. The use of categories allows some 3 50 years of stylistic evolution to be more accurately recorded and understood. For the convenience of the reader, a glossary of Chinese terms is included at the back. Titles of Chinese and Japanese books and articles have been given in transliteration and translation in the footnotes, and in the original characters, wherever applicable in the bibliography. Fol- lowing Chapter I is a complete list of the tomb's contents, with brief descriptions, in the se- quence of the original excavation report (Teng-hsien ts'ai-se hua-hsiang cbuan-mu, Peking, 195 8). The publication of this monograph was made possible only by the concern and assistance of John M. Crawford, Jr.; John W.

January, 1979 A.J. XVI</page><page sequence="13">INTRODUCTION The Six Dynasties is one of the most complex and provocative periods in China's history.' Beginning with the disintegration of the Han Dynasty, the very fabric of the culture began to unravel. The next 389 years, 200 A. D. to 5 89 A. D., saw civil strife, intermittent warfare, and barbarian invasions. Warlords divided the once stable and prosperous Han empire into Three Kingdoms, Wu in the southeast, Shu Han in the southwest, and Wei in the north. This divi- sion persisted until 265 A.D., when China was briefly united again by the Ssu-ma family under the Western Chin Dynasty. For fifty years, Western Chin attempted to rekindle the glorious achievements of the Han. Attracted by the deterioration of the Western Chin, partially sinicized Turco-Mongolian tribes which had been allowed to settle within the northern borders to supplement the regular Chinese army, struck at the heart of China. In the face of invading hordes, the Chinese court fled South, abandoning the North to the barbarians. In 317, the establishment of the Eastern Chin Dynasty (317-420) on the lower Yangtse marks the beginning of an era often called the Nan-pei-ch'ao, the Northern and Southern Dy- nasties. From 317 to 589, the South saw a succession of short weak dynasties, Liu Sung (420 to 479), Southern Ch'i (479-502), Liang (502-557), and Ch'en (-557-5 87); all had their capitals at Chien-k'ang or modern day Nanking.2 In the South, the Chinese gentry became the standard bearers and preservers of the Han legacy. The North remained at the mercy of contending barbarians until after 386 when a Turkish tribe, the T'o-pa Wei, began unifying the Northern territory from their frontier foot- hold calling themselves the Northern Wei Dynasty. In 535, the Northern Wei Empire split into rival dynasties, Eastern Wei (534-550) succeeded by Northern Ch'i (550-575) and Western Wei (535-556) succeeded by Northern Chou (557-581). Finally the North and South were reunited, first under the shortlived Sui Dynasty (581-617) and then under the T'ang (6i8 to 906).3 I In both Chinese and English, this period has been given a variety of names reflecting parts of the major political upheavals. Common titles are the "Period of Disunity," "Three Kingdoms-Six Dynasties," "Period of Northern and Southern Dynasties," or simply the "Six Dynasties." Because it falls between two of the most brilliant epochs in the history of China, Western historians are also tempted to view this time as a gap or China's "Dark Ages" or "Middle Ages." For a lack of a more precise term and for simplicity, "Six Dynasties" will be used in the text as a generic name for the entire period. 2 According to the Chinese historians, the term "Six Dynasties" applies specifically to those dynasties which ruled from Nanking, Wu, Eastern Chin, Liu Sung, Southern Ch'i, Liang, and Ch'en. 3 For more detailed accounts of the history of the Six Dynasties period, in English see Annette L. Juliano, Art of the Six Dynasties: Centuries of Change and Innovation (New York: The China Institute in America, 1975), pp.6-io; Edwin O.Reischauer and John K.

D. signaled the disintegration not only of a great empire but also of the syncretic Confucian world order which dominated the last 200 years of the Han Empire. Powerful new forces, the vigor of the barbarian invaders, and the Buddhist religion from India, challenged the traditional values of the society. With Confucian ideals powerless to stem the onslaught, a major philosophical revival ensued, bent on finding a new structure for society. This philosophical ferment encouraged the upsurge of Neo-Taoism in the mid- third through fifth centuries and the growth and acceptance of the Buddhist religion. Against this tableau of disorder, the arts, especially sculpture, flourished, inspired by the growth of the Buddhist religion. Buddhism first penetrated China during the Han Dynasty, but it was not until the fourth and fifth centuries that the teachings took firm root and spread throughout the North and South. The fervent devotion of the nomadic conquerors in the North, particularly the T'o-pa Wei, produced a lasting record in the form of several monumental stone cave complexes. Stone was the favored medium for both Buddhist sculpture and mor- tuary art. By contrast, few examples of Buddhist art survive from the South since the more perishable materials, bronze, lacquer, clay, and wood, were preferred for Buddhist sculpture. Stone seems to have been reserved mostly for mortuary art. Besides the copies of paintings and calligraphy attributed to such famous artists of the period as Ku K'ai-chih, Chang Seng-yu, and Wang Hsi-chih, most extant examples of non-Buddhist arts are connected with burial practices: sarcophagi, epitaph covers, tomb decorations, and ming-ch'i.4 Western scholars are more familiar with northern mortuary art since significant numbers of ming-ch'i, a few stone sarcophagi, and some epitaph covers have reached the West, unfortunately without secure provenance. Examples of Southern mortuary art are few and less familiar; most, which were excavated from tombs after I949, remain in China. Excavations have also turned up a group of tombs richly decorated with clay tiles. Until recently, the tombs of Teng-hsien, discovered in Southern Honan in I959, and Hsi-shan-ch'iao, found near Nanking in I960 with its celebrated mural of the "Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove and Jung Ch'i-ch'i" were the only two noteworthy examples. 5 Significant additions were made by the I973 discovery of three tombs at Hu-ch'iao in Tan-yang County near Nanking.6 Scholarship and interest in Six Dynasties art have been uneven. Most attention has been directed towards the surviving Buddhist art from the North, literary sources dealing with the history and aesthetics of painting and calligraphy, and to a lesser degree, ceramic wares. North- ern Buddhist art offers fertile soil for research. For the most part, sculpture from cave complexes as well as smaller stelae and individual images, can be securely dated and the internal stylistic development well established. Both paintings and sculpture from Tun-huang, perhaps the most exotic and provocative Buddhist site, have provided scholars with an endless source of stylistic 4 Non-Buddhist arts are largely related to burial practices. So, the term "non-Buddhist" will be used rather than "secular". 5 For the original excavation report of the Teng-hsien find see Teng-hsien ts'ai-se hua-hsiang chuan-mu (Peking, 19 5 8), and The Nanking Museum and the Nanking Municipal Cultural Monuments Preservation Committee, "The Southern Dynasties Tomb at Hsi-shan-ch'iao, Nanking with Molded Brick Murals," (in Chinese), Wen Wu, I960, nos. 8-9, pp. 36-42. 6 The discovery of the Tan-yang tombs was first briefly mentioned in Wen Wu, 1973, no. 4, p. 4 and subsequently, in a much longer report, The Nanking Museum, "Excavation of a Large Southern Dynasties Tomb with Decorated Tomb Bricks at Hu-ch'iao in Tan-yang County, Kiangsu Province," (in Chinese), Wen Wu, 1974, no. 2, pp.44-56. 2</page><page sequence="15">and iconographic issues. The remaining non-Buddhist or mortuary arts, sarcophagi, epitaph covers, tomb decor, and ming-ch'i have been overlooked. Part of the neglect stems from lack of interest and part from meagre material. New archeological materials excavated from North- ern and Southern tombs, coupled with a growing number of scholarly publications in the West are changing this situation.7 Teng-hsien is a brick, barrel vaulted tomb with a rectangular chamber; originally, painted mould-impressed clay tiles of varying sizes, shapes, and decoration lined the wall surfaces. The style and iconography of these decorated tiles, along with the tomb's ambiguous geographical location, raise major issues for the field of Chinese art and, in particular, for the study of Six Dynasties non-Buddhist art from the Southern Dynasties. This tomb, besides enlarging the scanty remains of Southern non-Buddhist art, significantly increases our knowledge of the evolution of landscape in Chinese art. Some complex compositions found on the tomb tiles provide links between known levels of developmentin in landscape composition in Han and T'ang. Although parts of an unusual inscription found on the edge of a tile in the tomb sug- gestively tie this burial to a high-ranking military figure from the Sout, Teng-hsien's location in a disputed border area complicates the attribution of the of tomb to the Northern or Southern dynasties. This ambiguity, however, renews speculation about one of the most difficult and provocative issues of Six Dynasties art-the relationship between Northern and Southern Dynasties art. If Teng-hsien is a Southern Dynasties product, this tomb, together with the more recent finds from Tan-yang, clarifies te character of the pictorial style prevalent in the South, and during the period. During the fifth and sixth centuries, a variety of competing forces stimulated by political chaos reshaped this pictorial style. Teng-hsien provides an excellent record of this transforma- tion. Subjects depicted on these tiles in a new, intensely linear, and almost painterly style become eclectic, reflecting Buddhist, Neo-Taoist, and Confucian interests. Of the three, Bud- dhism plays a dominant role in changing the tenor of the style. Buddhism introduces new sub- jects and a taste for lush floral motifs. Floral elements, particularly the lotus, develop into a major decorative device and space filler, regardless of subject. Despite its obvious importance, the Teng-hsien find has received curiously little scholarly attention, particularly in English. Only two Chinese publications deal directly with the tomb. The first is a modest monograph published in I959 which includes diagram, measurements, a description of the excavation, and photographs of the contents, but makes no attempt at inter- pretation or dating.8 The second is a ten page article written by a Chinese scholar who discusses 7 In addition to the pioneering work done by Alexander C.

All aspects of the tomb and its contents are examined, including the general physical character and layout, the style and iconography of the decorative motifs, the architecture, the ming-ch'i, the inscription, and the historical circumstances. The final chapter focuses on the ramifications of Teng-hsien in the broader context of Six Dynasties non-Buddhist arts, specifically pictorial or landscape com- position. 9 Liu Han, "Research and Dating of the Decorated Clay Tiles from the Tomb of Teng-hsien," (in Chinese), K'ao-ku, I959, no. 5, pp. 25 5-z26I, 263; a summary of this article can be found in English in Revue Bibliographique de Sinologie, V (1959), .1I75. 1O For example, Yoshito Harada, Kan rikucho nofukusoku (Chinese Dress and Personal Ornaments in the Han and Six Dynasties), in Japanese with an English summary, (Tokyo: The Toyo Bunko Rons6, Series A, Vol. XLIX, I967), pp. 178-184; Bush, "Thunder Monsters, Auspicious Animals," pp. 27-28; "Floral Motifs," pp. 73-74. 4</page><page sequence="17">CHAPTER I DESCRIPTION OF THE TOMB In December of I957 the tomb was discovered by farmers at the town of Hsiieh-chuang in the Teng-hsien District in southwest Honan (Fig.A). During the process of discovery, the main tomb vault was wrecked by inexperienced digging, and parts of the ornamental wall facing and some objects were removed. However, much was recovered by the provincial archeological team, which began systematic excavation in January of I958."I They uncovered the remains of a simple rectangular tomb chamber approximately 32 feet (9.80 m) in length constructed entirely of clay bricks. The tomb entrance faces southeast and had been sealed by a brick wall. The chamber has two parts: a main room Io feet (3.09 m) wide, and a narrower anteroom corridor at the southeast end (Fig. B). The original structure of the tomb included a barrel vaulted roof about IO feet (3.2 m) high, which remains intact only in the anteroom (Fig. 2b).Iz Three layers of wedge-shaped bricks form the vault. The walls are lined with closely set shallow buttresses, four on each wall of the entrance hall, eight on each wall in the main room, and two on the back wall (Figs.C, I-3). Originally, brightly painted molded impressed tiles of varying sizes, shapes, and decora- tion covered the brick wall and ceiling surfaces in the tomb. Although they were closely fitted together and cemented with lime mortar, many of the tiles have fallen off both walls and ceiling, destroying much of the original arrangement. The decorated clay tiles occur in three shapes, rectangular, square, and wedge-shaped. All have mold impressed relief decoration and are further embellished with one or more combina- tions of seven colors, red, yellow, green, blue, purple, light red (pink) and black. The fine quality of the clay creates a smooth hard surface which imparts exceptional clarity and crispness to the relief decoration. Rectangular tiles are most numerous and range in size from about 24 cm. to 57.5 cm. long, from 6 to I9 cm. wide, and from about 4.5 to 6 m. thick. The one square example illustrated, filled with a lotus, is comprised of four separate tiles, 18 cm. square, placed together to form a larger tile, 36 cm. on a side (Fig. 8). Only one set of dimensions is given for the voussoirs, 51 cm. long, 18.5 cm. wide at one end, I 3 cm. wide at the other end, and 6 cm. thick. I Most of the information concerning the tomb structure and its contents is drawn from the original archeological report, Teng-hsien, pp. 1-49. For a more colorful description of the mishaps surrounding the discovery of this tomb see Fontein and Wu, Unearthing China's Past, p. 146, no. 70o. On two recent visits to China, the author saw a reproduction of the painting found on Teng-hsien's doorway in the Historical Museum in Peking and a selection of tiles in the Honan Provincial Museum in Cheng-chou. 2 Unfortunately, the original report provides only the most general dimensions for the tomb chamber and does not give the complete measurements for the entrance corridor. Thus it is unclear whether the height of 3.20 om actually refers to the remaining barrel vault in the entrance corridor or the approximate height of the collapsed main chamber. The main room and entrance corridor may or may not have been the same height. 5</page><page sequence="18">Fig. A Map of southern Honan, Teng-hsien area Basically, the decoration on the tiles divides into two types: floral patterns and pictorial or representational scenes. The floral patterns, mostly rinceaus and lotus medallions, occurred on the ceiling, in filler tiles used as borders between the larger tiles with pictorial scenes, and as space fillers in pictorial scenes (Figs. 5-4, i6 17, I7,19, 22, 24, 27, 28, 30, 5 I, 52, 54, 55, 5 7-59, 68, 69, 73, 74).13 The most interesting tiles are these large panels, approximately 19 cm. by 38 cm. by 6 cm., which depict a rich repertory of animal and human activities (Figs. 14, i6, 17, I9, 22, 23, 24, 27, 28, 30, 32, 34, 35, 37-4I, 43-49, 5I, 52, 54, 57-59, 68, 69, 7I-74). These were spaced on the wall buttresses, one above the other from floor to ceiling, separated only by three rows of narrower filler tiles with floral patterns. It appears from the description, diagrams, and photographs in the original report that five pictorial tiles were placed on each buttress along the east and west walls; three each on the back wall in the main room; and three on each buttress in the entrance hall, for a total of I o tiles. Of the possible I o, thirty-six are 13 There is a complete list of tiles and clay figures found in the tomb at the end of the Chapter. 6</page><page sequence="19">published in the archeological report and about fifty-four remain in what seems to be their original position on the walls.I4 The representational scenes on the tiles fit into four broad categories. The first group con- tains a variety of real, fantastic, and symbolic animals. Four tiles depict the traditional symbolic creatures of the four directions: the "Black Warrior" of the North (a serpent curled around a tortoise), the White Tiger of the West, the Green Dragon of the East, and the Red Bird of the South (Figs. 14, i6, 17, 22).'5 Two other tiles show a pair of confronted dragons and a pair of confronted lions with their paws raised over an illegible Chinese character (Fig. 23, 30).16 Three tiles show other interesting and unusual fantastic creatures. One, which is identified by Chinese characters on the tile, depicts the fabulous auspicious animal, the ch'i-lin often called unicorn in the West (Fig. 24).I7 This ch'i-lin has the body of a horse, with a long single horn projecting from its forehead, and four flame-like forms projecting from its back. According to tradition, the flame-like forms are streamers of variously colored hair. Another tile has a very similar animal except that this one has claws instead of hooves, only three flame-shaped hairs, and a more camel-like face (Fig. 27).I8 The archeological report identifies it as a flying horse. The long horn on its forehead is unmistakeable, and this could also be a kind of ch'i-lin. Perhaps the two represent the male and female animals. The last tile in this group bears an inscription of four characters, two on either side of a pair of curious looking confronted crea- tures (Fig. 28).19 The inscriptions read ch'ien-ch'iu and wan-sui, "one thousand autumns and ten thousand years," a common expression of good luck. Both of these fantastic beings have bird bodies but differing heads: one elf-like with long pointed ears, and the other rodent-like. With one exception, the next group of tiles is homogeneous in character. All show men leading, following, or riding animals (Figs. 32, 34, 35, 37-40).20 One horse wears protective quilted armor (Fig 3)2 The figures wear military or servant uniform with loose fitting trousers tied below the knee and a short tunic belted at the waist, an outfit commonly seen on Nothern Wei pottery figures, in mortuary ar, and in Buddhist art. Other tiles depict male figures leading bullock carts or just a bullock (Figs. 37-40).22 In all, the animals are drawn with agility and spirit. An exceptional tile in this group shows a striding tiger ridden by an elegant lady wearing long robes which trail behind as if briskly blown by a rush of air (Fig. I9).23 Apparently, this combination of a lady riding an animal was quite popular in the Six Dy- nasties, particularly on epitaph covers such as that of Erh-chu Hsi dated 5 29 A. D. under the I4 Even considering the collapsed state of the tomb's ceiling vault, the original archeological report provides vague and somewhat inaccurate descriptions of the tomb's remaining and reconstructed decor. The figures quoted above should only be accepted as estimates. The diagram in the text of the report (Fig. 2, Teng-hsien, p. 2) clearly indicates the position of only the large tiles, but descriptions in the text provide more information. In Chapter III, the discussion of the decorative program tries to clarify some of the questions about the original arrangement of the large pictorial tiles.

On that cover, all of the symbolic directional animals except for the tortoise and snake are ridden by elegant figures with wind-blown scarves (Fig. 78).24 In the third group, figures predominate, some alone, some in pairs, and others in groups. The majority of the tiles show groups of figures in a funerary procession without any addi- tional background (Figs. 41, 43-49, 5I, 52).25 The processions are skillfully and simply exe- cuted with musicians, foot soldiers, and long-robed male and female figures, some moving to the right, others to the left, probably approaching a place of ceremony. Unfortunately, so many tiles fell off the walls that there is no record of their correct sequence. Perhaps foot soldiers, standard bearers, and musicians came first, followed by elegant ladies and gentlemen. Other tiles in this figure group are extraordinary. Three, n particular, have pairs of flying apsarases which swoop through the air trailing scarves (Figs. 57-59). One pair moves toward each other and momentarily hovers over a Buddhist censer in the shape of a lotus (Fig. 57).26 Another pair alights on either side of a vase with a single lotus blossom (Fig. 8).27 The third and most daz.ling pair appears to have been caught in mid-air as they swoop downward, in an exquisite flurry of scarves (Fig. 5 9).8 The movement is further emphasized by the surround- ing swirl of clouds and flowers. At the bottom of the tile, Chinese characters between the two figures identify them as t'ien-jen, heavenly beings, or Buddhist angels. These flying apsarases most effectively demonstrate the sophisticated style of the Teng-hsien find, a style executed at its best with intensely energetic linear forms. The construction of this tomb with its buttresses along the wall divides the wall space into narrow vertical areas which do not permit continuous horizontal scenes such as those found in the earlier Nanking tomb of the Seven Sages (Fig. 75) and the late fifth century tile murals in Hu-ch'iao (Fig. 8).z2 The decoration of the Teng-hsien tiles was largely conceived in terms of individual panels, sometimes connected by a similar theme, i. . the procession. However, in some cases, the long vertical spaces of the buttresses were more fully utilized, and the limita- tions of the individual panel overcome. An example is the figure of a bearded attendant com- posed of two large panels, one above the other, with narrow filler tiles in between (Figs. 54, 5).30 Several distinct rows of large and small tiles combine to project a single coherent image. The head is on the upper tile and the usual floral decoration on the filler tiles is replaced by the central portion of the body from the shoulders to the legs. The lower panel completes the figure. Since it was placed near the bottom of the buttresses, using the lowest two large panels, the figure appears to be standing sentinel on the floor. A severe frontal pose and the strong bila- teral symmetry emphasized by a sword or staff of office placed directly at the center of the body enhance a sense of quiet self-possessed dignity. The costume of trousers and a short tunic suggests that he is probably a guardian, like the armed male figures found painted on the en- trance archway (Fig. 56). 24 The barely visible figure on the back of the hsiian-wu looks cramped and points backward towards a grotesque thunder monster or wind spirit, (Fig. 78) and see Juliano, Art of the Six Dynasties, p. 70. 25 Teng-hsien, Figs. 9, Io, p. 14; Fig.iz, p. 5; Fig. 14, p.I7; Fig.i6, p.i8; Figs. 24-26, pp.23-24; Fig.30, p.26. 26 Ibid., Fig. 33, p. 27. 27 Ibid., Fig. 34, p. 28. 28 Ibid., Fig. 3 5, p.28. 29 Akiyama, Arts of China, Vol.1, P1. 217, p. 22.

These panels illustrate Taoist legends and Confucian moral maxims. The advanced and complex com- position of these scenes which will be treated at length later makes them the most interesting in the tomb. Two tiles illustrate the same Taoist legend about a certain Wang Tzu-ch'iao who played a ch'iu-sheng, Chinese mouth organ, so well that he could bring a phoenix down from heaven to dance for him. Apparently, his playing caused more than a phoenix to appear. The scene shows another figure identified on one of the two tiles as Fou Ch'iu-kung (Figs. 68, 69).3I He is dressed in long, traditional Chinese robes, has long loose hair, and holds an unidentified object in his hand (a flywhisk?). Fou Ch'iu-kung, a mythical being, was said to have obtained the secret of immortality in the reign of Ling Wang of Chou (571-545 B.C.).32 Another tile shows a popular Taoist theme in the Six Dynasties, four old recluses, two playing musical instruments, seated in a mountain landscape setting (Fig. 73). They are identified by an inscrip- tion on the edge of the tile as the Four Greybeards of the South Mountain.33 Akiyama has suggested that the inscription should probably read shang-shan, Shang Mountains, and refers to the Four Greybeard Recluses.34 These four sages retired to the Shang Mountains in despair at the disorder which existed toward the end of the Ch'in Dynasty.35 They returned to govern- ment service after order was reestablished by the Western Han. The theme of retirement was revived with the catastrophic collapse of the Eastern Han, and became a popular literary motif. The most famous example describes a group of seven friends who met regularly and became known as the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove. The story of these friends' meetings rapidly spread through the Southern Dynasties.36 The earliest pictorial representation of this popular literary theme appears in the late fourth century tomb at Hsi-shan-ch'iao, Nanking.37 The last two tiles of thisroup illustrate the lastories of two paragons of filial piety, Kuo Chu and Lao Lai-tzu (Figs. 71, 72, 74).38 Kuo Chu is said to have lived in the second century A.D. Besides his wife and child, he also supported his aging mother. Lacking enough food for everyone, he decided with his wife to bury their infant son to provide for his mother's needs. In the process of digging the grave, he found a pot of gold-ample reward for his filial devotion. The tile shows the moment when Kuo Chti, who is digging while his wife looks on holding the infant, discovers the pot of gold (Figs. 71, 72). The landscape setting of the scene is quite picturesque with variegated details of vegetation. This seems to be the earliest extant represen- tation of this story.39 The other filial piety paragon, Lao Lai-tzu, was said to have lived in the 31 Ibid., Fig. 28, p.25. 32 Morohashi Tetsuji, Dai Kanwajiten (Tokyo: I95 5-I 960) VI, no. 17487, 57; William F.

(Fig. 74).40 He was celebrated for his unfailing devotion to his aged parents. It is said that at the age of seventy, he still dressed and played as a child to distract his parents from awareness of their advanced age.41 The composition of the scene is quite simple. Both aged parents sit sheltered under a kind of baldachino on the right, and Lao Lai-tzu kneels on the left in front of them. This paragon was popular in Han and is represented twice in the Wu Liang-tzu stone reliefs in Shantung.4Z In addition to the four groups of painted tiles, a very interesting painting is preserved on the horseshoe-shaped gateway to the tomb, which is 3 m. high, 2.70 m. wide and 60 cm. across each side panel (Fig. 56).43 Since the entrance had been blocked by a brick wall, the painting retained much of its original freshness. However, the doorway published in the archeological report is a reconstruction, with copies of the paintings, which now stands in the Historical Museum in Peking.44 The design was drawn with red on a gesso-like ground used to cover the surface of the bricks.45 The remaining colors, yellow, green, purple, and light red were added and black lines used as final accents. A grotesque animal mask, teeth clenching a bar draped with a ribbon, looms at the top of the arch.46 Two bearded figures with long black swords or staffs guard either side of the entrance. They wear tunics covered with leather armor strapped over the shoulders, and loose fitting trousers. Above each guardian, two pairs of lotus medallions enclose a floating apsaras. Along with the decorated tiles and the painting on the arched doorway, approximately fifty-five pottery figurines from 9 to 30 cm. high were found in the tomb, along with a few miscellaneous items, a bone hairpin, coffin nails, etc. (Figs. I29-14I). The coffin and its plat- form were completely lost. The fifty-five pottery figurines are rather crudely modeled; many are severely damaged and broken.47 Since they were constructed in two parts, the head and body molded and fired independently, many of the heads and bodies were separated. Only twenty complete figures are published in the report along with ten heads and three headless bodies (Figs. 138, I39).48 During the Six Dynasties, this type of two part construction became characteristic of both Southern and Northern Dynasty ming-ch'i. Each of these figures bears two or three Chinese characters or marks scratched into the top of the head, the back, and sometimes under one foot (Figs. 129-I37). Apparently, the same mark or character appeared on head and body and was used to match the appropriate head and body. The one under the foot, usually a Chinese character, seems to identify the figure's parti- cular function, such as cart driver or swordsman. Some of the marks are numbers which may 40 Chi Cho, Chung-kuo Jen-ming, p. 280, and Mayers, p.

This footnote describes the archway painting as having been first "pricked out" on the gesso ground and then drawn in red. The words "pricked out" suggest the use of some kind of pounce or tracing device. 46 Comparable masks frequently appear above smaller images in Buddhist cave temples. In Lung-men, for example, a row of masks holding garlands in their teeth create a scalloped effect (see Fig. 63). Although highly decorative, these masks, like the Teng-hsien example, perhaps also serve as guardians. 47 The sex of pottery figurines is often difficult to determine. Details of clothing are not always definitive. 48 Teng-hsien, Figs. 5 I-65, pp. 37-49. See list of clay figures at the end of Chapter I.

The ming-ch'i generally wear two types of clothing which are also consistent with those found on the tiles. One is a servant or military costume, with trousers tied below the knee, short tunic, and belt; several are shown without belts and three with loose trousers untied at the knee. The other type, visible only on two figures, is the traditional long Chinese robe worn by attendants and officials (Fig. I35).49 With one exception, the figures display a va- riety of small caps, pointed, lotus petal shape, etc. The wu-kuan type of headdress or hat, accep- table court dress for both the military and courtiers, appears frequently (Fig. I30).50 A musician, carrying a drum, wears an unusual large brimmed hat (Fig. I29). The figures, like the tiles, are embellished with bright colors, traces of which still cling to many. On the top edge of the tile showing two war horses led by a servant, there is a three line inscription, haphazardly handwritten (Fig. I45).5I The archeological report mentions the existence of an inscription and publishes a photograph of it but does not translate or interpret it. Later Chinese and Japanese sources only decipher small bits of the inscription.s2 49 Ibid., Fig. 5 9, p. 44. 50 Many ming-ch'i of both the Northern and Southern Dynasties wear headgear known as the wu-kuan, court dress for both the military and the courtiers. The distinguishing mark of the courtier is a feather, Harada, Chinese Dress and Personal Ornaments, p. 28. Clay figures from the Six Dynasties period frequently have a small hole in the back of the head just below the cap, perhaps to accomodate a feather. Unfortunately, since there are no photographs of the backs of the clay figures in the Teng-hsien tomb, it is impossible to determine if any have these small holes. 51 Teng-hsien, Figs. 7 and 8, p. 13. 52 Liu Han, "Research and Dating," p. 356; Harada, Chinese Dress and Personal Ornaments, pp. I69-170; Lin Shu-chung, "Discussion of the Stamped Clay Tile Murals from the Southern Ch'i Tomb at Tan-yang, Kiangsu," (in Chinese), Wen Wu, I977, no.I, p.73, n.5.

I4</page><page sequence="27">CHAPTER II CONSTRUCTION OF THE TOMB T he structure of the Teng-hsien tomb belongs to the tradition of brick tomb architecture which began in Late Chou.53 Earthenware tiles or bricks first appeared in late Warring States tombs in Honan, especially at Cheng-chou.54 The earliest tiles were hollow in construc- tion, that is earthenware cast in two separate rectangular slabs, joined together and fired, leaving the interior hollow. This method which required advanced techniques in casting and firing, allowed the tiles to be large, some 6 feet long and 2 feet wide, but still relatively light in weight. Rectangular chambers, consisting of hollow-tiled walls, replaced the traditional wooden cham- ber at the bottom of the earth pit. Wooden planks served as the roof. The construction of the chamber usually followed a definite pattern, like the one found at Erh-li-kang, Honan, six or eight tiles for the floor, four for each of the two long walls, and two each for the short walls.ss55 The tiles are usually decorated with stamped geometric patterns or numbers which probably indicated position in the walls of the chamber.56 In Han, the hollow tile chamber became larger and more elaborate. Extra side chambers or entrance corridors were added to the basic rectan- gular form. A simple gabled roof of large slanting tiles replaced the flat wooden plank cover. Decoration was no longer limited to geometric patterns but also included lively and diverse 53 This section in no way pretends to be a definitive survey of brick architecture from its inception through the Six Dynasties. Such a study is severely limited by three conditions: I) the inconsistent quality of the information reported in archeo- logical journals which ranges from very detailed to exceedingly vague, 2) the problem of establishing precise or at least accurate translations of technical architectural terminology, and 3) often drawings of the tomb plan, elevation, and struc- ture are not included in the report. With these limitations in mind, this discussion attempts to place the tomb structure of Teng-hsien into a context. 54 Cheng Te-k'un, Archeology in China, Vol.III: Chou China (Cambridge, 1963), p. 2z0. When discussing brick tomb architecture, a semantic problem arises over the meaning and use of the words brick and tile. A brick is a rectangular solid, usually small, made from moist clay, hardened by heat, and used structurally for walls and ceilings. A tile is often clay but can be made of other materials, and is used for ornamentation. Usually thin, flat, rectan- gular or square shapes, tiles line wall surfaces. These terms, both in English and Chinese publications are inconsistently applied. For example, Richard Rudolph, in Han Tomb Art of West China (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 195 I) classifies the Szechwan clay tiles as tiles in the introduction (p. 18) but in his extensive plate descriptions consistently refers to them as bricks (pp. 32-38). Michael Sullivan in The Birth of Landscape Painting in China (Berkeley and Los Angeles, I962) refers to hollow tiles as "stamped clay bricks" (Figs. 139-42, I44-47), "molded bricks" (Fig. 83), or "clay tiles" (Fig. 20). Part of this confusion stems from the translation since the Chinese often use one term, chuan, for both bricks and tiles. There has never been a complete discussion in Chinese which not only described the types of bricks and tiles but also illustrated them. For clarity in this Chapter and throughout the text, the terms brick and tile will be used as follows: I) Bricks are solid rectangular units used for basic construction of the tomb; this also includes wedgeshaped bricks used for ceilings. These bricks may or may not be decorated or covered by decorated tiles. 2) Hollow tiles serve both structural and decorative functions like the Chin-ts'un tiles. 3) Tiles are used to cover surfaces such as brick walls and not structurally. Such tiles, usually rectangular or square, are frequently decorated. 55 For a description of this Warring States hollow tile tomb see Cheng Te-k'un, Chou China, pp. 108-9 and Wen Wu, I954, no. 6, pp. 57-6I. 56 Cheng Te-k'un, Chou China, p. Io8. X5</page><page sequence="28">scenes from daily life; cooking, hunting, feasting, and acrobatic performances were common. The designs were stamped into the wet clay or painted directly on the tile. From available evidence, the use of hollow tiles continued into early Eastern Han and center- ed largely in Honan. Most of the excavated hollow tile tombs cluster in the central and eastern Honan region around Loyang, Cheng-chou and Hsin-cheng.57 Small bricks began to appear in the second century B.C. and were used in conjunction with hollow tiles. By the end of Western Han and the beginning of Eastern Han, small solid bricks, rectangular and wedge-shaped, repla- ced the hollow tiles as the standard structural material. This period, late Western Han to Early Eastern Han, is often characterized as a transitional phase, since some tombs which can be dated to the period have hybrid constructions, part hollow tiles, part solid bricks; vertical pits with arched entrances of solid bricks; part stone and part bricks.58 In contrast to the hollow tile type, brick tombs during the Eastern Han can be found along with stone tombs in every province of China as well as Korea, Manchuria, and Mongolia. The demand for tomb construction must have sharply increased during the Han Dynasty as burial practices with their attendant social and artistic customs became fully developed. The popularity and spread of this type of brick tomb architecture is understandable. Clay is ideal for this pur- pose. It was and remains the commonest and most accessible material all over China. The talents of Han craftsman, skilled in modeling and firing stoneware and ming-ch'i, could easily be utilized for tomb construction and decoration. Solid brick construction was not only cheaper and easier to decorate than stone but also permitted more flexible plans, as attested to by the large number of structural variations in tomb layouts. Regardless of building material, the elaborateness of the tomb plans depends on the rank and wealth of the deceased, the grandest, of course, reserved for the emperor. Multi-chambered tombs in both brick and stone reflect the living habits of the upper class, a simulated forecourt or front room, a main room for entertaining friends, and back rooms for family. Since Han empe- rors began building their tombs while still living, the more complex tombs with as many as nine rooms were probably imitations of the imperial tombs, built by subordinates.59 Some of the more elaborate tombs in both brick and stone even simulate wooden architectural details such as brackets. Generally, among solid brick tombs, the simple rectangular chamber with or without an entrance corridor remains the most basic plan. More elaborate plans have several rectangular or square chambers combined in different ways. 57 The major sites in Honan where hollow tiles have been found: Cheng-chou area, Erh-li-kang, K'ao-ku, 1963, no. Io, pp. 590-594, 6II and Hsin-t'ung-chiao, Wen Wu, 1972, no. IO, pp.41-48; Loyang area, Lo-yang Shao-kou Han-mu (Peking, I959); Hsiao-yao-ling, Yu-hsien, Pai-sha County, Honan, K'ao-ku hsiieh-pao, I959, no.

At the present time it appears that most of the excavated hollow tiles are from Honan. However, Anneliese Bulling in her article, "Hollow Tomb Tiles," Oriental Art (Spring, I 965), XI, no. I, p. 27 and n. I, notes that some hollow tiles had been found in Shensi in what is believed to be Ch'in Shih Huang T'i's tumulus, K'ao-ku, 1962, no.8, p.407. Several decorated hollow tiles have been discovered during the excavations of the architectural remains of the palace at the Ch'in capital at Hsien-yang, Shensi, The Ch'in Capital Hsien-yang Archeological Team, "Excavation of the Architectural Remains of the Palace No. I at the Ch'in Capital Hsien-yang," (in Chinese), Wen Wu, 1976, no. I I, p. 20. 58 Part solid brick and part hollow tile construction can be found in a tomb excavated near Loyang and published by Jona- than Chaves, "A Painted Tomb in Loyang," Artibus Asiae, XXX, I (1968), pp. 5-27. A vertical pit tomb with a brick barrel vaulted entrance corridor was excavated in Chekiang, Shao-hsing area, K'ao-ku, I957, no. 2, p. 672. Part brick and part stone construction is used in the Eastern Han tombs excavated in northern Shensi, Shen pei T'ung-Han hua-hsiang shih-k'e hsiian-chi (Peking, I959), pp. II5-12I. 59 Cheng Te-k'un, Archeological Studies in Szechwan (Cambridge, I967), pp. 142-3.</page><page sequence="29">The ceilings of rectangular chambers are usually described as arched, actually forming a barrel or tunnel vault. Often the vaults use true voussoir construction. Unfortunately, the exca- vation reports are not always specific about the construction of the ceiling and merely state that the chamber has an "arched" ceiling. Cheng Te-k'un defines at least three ways the vaults were constructed in Hanlar brick tombs in Szechan province: ) large curved bricks with socketed joints, 2) wedge-shaped bricks or true voussoir construction, and 3) gothic arch-type construc- tion in which the arch is supported by a frame of slightly curved or wedge-shaped stone slabs on which elongated bricks with socketed joints are laid.60 Most likely, these techniques were not restricted to Szechwan.61 The ceilings of square chambers are occasionally domed by cloister vaults, and are usually found in combination with rectangular chambers and arched ceilings in the same tomb.62 The interior walls of Han brick tomb chambers are decorated in two ways: designs are stam- ped into the clay or painted onto the surface. In the first method, the tomb is constructed with solid rectangular bricks which may or may not be decorated with stamped designs. Most fre- quently, they are decorated with cord or simple geometric patterns. In a more elaborate version of the first method, the interior brick walls are faced with another layer of decorated tiles. These tiles, square or rectangular, ohave stamped designs executed in raised relief or the less common sunken relief found on the Chin-ts'un tiles.63 The decoration includes the usual range of geome- tric and floral patterns, animals both symbolic and mythological, and genre scenes. Occasionally the designs are further embellished with color. In the second method, decoration is painted either directly onto the surface of square tiles as in the Wang Tu tomb in Hopei or onto a single tile surface prepared with a kind of gesso or plaster.64 Both brick and stone architecture continued into the Three Kingdoms-Six Dynasties period with few discernible changes in spite of the catastrophic collapse of Han and the ensuing period of instability. While basic brick construction does not change significantly from Eastern Han through the Sui Dynasty, three broad phases can be distinguished. First, tombs which date from late Eastern Han to the Three Kingdoms-Chin periods are very similar not only in construction but also in decoration. These tombs share the same repertory of geometric patterns, rope patterns, straight lines, combinations of squares, triangles, circles, semi- circles, diamond shapes, and coin or disc patterns. Floral patterns and occasionally animals are rendered in the standard Han idiom. Unless an inscription or distinctive object is found among the grave contents, it is often difficult to distinguish between Late Eastern Han and Three King- doms-Chin tombs (3-5th centuries). This problem also arises with stone tomb architecture. The 60 Ibid., pp- 143-4- 61 An example of bricks with socketed joints can be found in the Eastern Han tomb of P'ing-lu-hsien, Shansi, K'ao-ku, 1959, no. 9, p. 462. Voussoir construction seems to be the commonest method of ceiling construction and is found all over China, for a few examples see, Honan, K'ao-ku hsiueh-pao, I95 8, no. 4, pp. 51-69; Chekiang, K'ao-ku, 1959, no.9, pp.464-8; Kiangsu, K'ao-ku hsieh-pao, 1957, no.

Soper, Art and Architecture of China (Baltimore, paperback ed., 1971), p. 73 and Wang-tu Han-mu pi-hua (Peking, 195 5). x7</page><page sequence="30">tomb of I-nan in Shantung, which has been attributed to either the Late Eastern Han or Western Chin period, points up the persistence of Han traditions.65 A seco phase occurred during the two halves estern and Eastern) of the Chin Dynasty (265-419) when brick tomb construction underwent a period of experimentation. Modifications appear in the shapes of the chambers, bowed exterior walls, apse-like ends, oval or hexagonal shapes.66 From this experimentation thentie rectangular chamber with bowed walls, an important structural modification and precaution, emerged as a popular alternative to the standard version with straight walls. The simple plan includes a rectangular chamber with barrel vault, bowed or straight walls, and entrance corridor. This plan predominated during the Chin period and was particularly popular around Nanking.67 The second phase brings a definite change in the decorative repertory, particularly in the later part of the Eastern Chin period or just after. The floral patterns undergo a transformation. The available evidence points to a shift from the schematized scrolls and geometric patterns of Han to more naturalistic vines and flowers, most significantly the use of lotus flower and similar broad leaf flowers or leaves. At present, this change can only be noted indirectly. The actual process can not as yet be clearly outlined, due to the nature of the available archeological evidence. The majority of reports describing brick tombs of this period do not publish complete illustrations of the designs on bricks and tiles unless they are very unusual; descriptions are short, often only one or two words. However, specific terms are used to identify the floral patterns, lien-hua for lotus and chiao-yeb for banana leaves. Lotus flowers are mentioned as decorative motifs in reports of Sou- thern Dynasties brick tombs dated to Eastern Chin (3I 7-A.D.ff.) or later.68 They have not appeared in the far fewer Northern tombs discovered as of this date.69 Since the lotus is synonymous with Buddhism its appearance in the decorative repertory of China reveals the growing strength and influence of this new religion. These representations in China are perhaps the earliest appearance of the lotus vines and flowers so freely used as border designs and fillers on the Teng-hsien tiles.70 6s Hsio-yen Shih attributed I-nan to the late third or early fourth century (Western Chin), "I-nan and Related Tombs," Artibus Asiae, XXII, 3 ( 1959), p. 3 I I; while Nagahiro Toshio prefers a late Eastern Han dating, Representational Art of the Han Dynasty (Text in Japanese with English Summary) (Tokyo, 1965), p.4. The question of I-nan's date will undoubtedly be raised again in light of the new paintings and relief carvings recently excavated in Mi-hsien, Honan; a tomb attributed to the late Eastern Han period, VWen Wu, 1972, no. IO, pp. 49-62. 66 For some examples of tombs with bowed walls, apselike ends, oval shapes, and other miscellaneous shapes see, K'ao-ku, 1957, no. i, pp. 37-41; K'ao-ku hsiieh-pao, I957, no.i, pp. I69-I85; Wen Wu, 1972, no.I, pp. 23-41; K'ao-ku hsfieb-pao, I959, nol.3, pp.75-103, Wen Wu, i960, nos.8-9, pp. 37-42. 67 K'ao-ku hsieh-pao, I957, no.i, pp. 87-191. 68 See examples in Fukien, K'ao-ku, 1959, no. i, pp.44-46; Nanking, Wen Wu, I973, no.4, pp. 36-so; and Hunan, K'ao-ku hsbieh-pao, I959, no. 3, pp. 75-I03. The emergence of floral motifs in tomb decor during the fourth century, specifically in the South, has been supported by Susan Bush in her recent article on floral motifs. She notes: "Floral motifs certainly gained a foothold in the Nanking region by the late fourth century, to judge from the stiff, eight-petaled lotus flanked by two axes on a tile from a grave outside Chung-shan gate dated by inscription to 384 A.D., "Floral Motifs," p. 53. 69 According to Susan Bush, the taste for dynamic and calligraphic floral ornament developed first in the Southern Dynasties tombs, matured by the late fifth century and ultimately influenced Northern art by the second decade of the sixth century. "Floral Motifs," pp.49-83. 70 One of the reliefs in I-nan depicts a flower which has been identified as a lotus. Ts'eng Chao-yu, I-nan ku-hua-hsiang shih- mufa-chiehbpao-kao (Nanking, 195 6), PI. 29, Fig. 8. If we accept the earlier date of late Eastern Han for the I-nan tomb, then the earlier appearance of the lotus would be pushed back to before the Chin period. However, the more naturalistic treat- ment of vines and flowers still seems to occur during the Chin, particularly the late Eastern Chin period. The tomb I8</page><page sequence="31">The rest of the repertory of geometric patterns shared with Eastern Han tombs continues unchanged throughout the Chin periods and later Six Dynasties. The simple rope or cord pattern is found everywhere. Its ubiquitousness suggests that such patterns resulted from the actual process of making the bricks or tiles themselves rather than from any special effort towards decoration. The tomb of the Seven Sages near Nanking, dated to the late fourth or early fifth century, reveals another innovation which cropped up in the Chin period.7I Up to this time, when pic- torial scenes were mold impressed in tiles, the size of the tiles defined the limits of the compo- sition; the result is a series of individual scenes along one wall. In the Seven Sages tomb, this limitation is overcome. The tiles lining the two long walls of the main chamber were used like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle to create a large and unified pictorial composition (Fig. I 5). The artisans probably worked from a cartoon which was divided into tile-size sections; the appropriate sec- tions were transferred with molds to numbered tiles, and then re-assembled on the wall of the tomb. This method was undoubtedly inspired by a desire to create a more permanent painting in clay. A comparison of the Han tomb of Wang Tu in Hopei with that of the Seven Sages estab- lishes the clear relationship between this technique and painting. Besides the Seven Sages, two other tombs using this technique have been found in Kiangsu province (Figs. 1i 8, 33, 53, 64).72 The third and last phase encompasses the fifth to late sixth centuries (420-5 89), when the division of China became more clearly characterized as barbarian or non-Chinese rule in the North versus the standard bearers of the Han traditions in the South. During this period, brick and stone tombs continued to be built. Examples of brick architecture can be found in every province. The simple rectangular chamber with barrel vault and entrance corridor, the most common type in the Chin period, remained so throughout the Northern and Southern Dynasties. Of course there are many variations of plans and construction, but no clear or definite pattern emerges between brick tombs built in the North and those in the South. Orly a few generali- zations can be advanced at this time. The plans of Northern tombs appear to be more complex than those in the South. Brick tomb construction also seems to have been far more popular in the South; at least, a substantially larger number of brick tombs have been found there. Floral motifs secured a central role in the decorative vocabulary of both areas. However, up until the late fifth to the sixth century, the North and South evidenced very different tastes in the treat- ment and design of floral motifs.73 Another obvious difference, which has almost become a cliche, is that the larger number of epitaph covers and sarcophagi richly decorated in reliefs by Northern carvers indicate that the North made more use of high quality stone, presumably a more abundant material there. The tomb of Teng-hsien falls into the third phase. Both its plan and location give it an ambi- guous historical position in this post-Chin to Sui period. Teng-hsien, located in southwest recently excavated near Chen-kiang, dated 398 A.D. or Eastern Chin period, shows tiles with simple but sinuous vine borders (see Fig. 1o4), Wen Wu, I973, no.4, pp. 51-58. 71 Soper, "Discovery," pp. 79-86. 72 One tomb, attributed to Emperor Hsuan-ti of Ch'en and dated to 5 82 A. D., was excavated near Hsi-shan-ch'iao in the Nanking area, K'ao-ku, I963, no.6, pp. 291-300; the other, a rather large tomb, recently excavated at Hu-ch'iao in Tan- yang County, is believed to be the grave of the Emperor of Southern Ch'i, Ching-ti or Hsiao Tao-sheng and his wife, ca. 495, Wen Wu, I974, no.2, pp.44-56 and Bush "Floral Motifs," p. 5o. 73 Bush, "Floral Motifs," pp. 82-83. I9</page><page sequence="32">Honan about twenty kilometres north of the Hupei border, latitude 320 46' longitude i I2? o8', occupied an apparently strategic position between the North and the South. Consequently, Teng-hsien was subject to influence from both the North and South. The plan of the tomb, rectangular chamber, vertical walls, tunnel vault, and entrance corridor (Figs. B,i), is the com- monest type, popular in the South but also found in the North. Even the pattern of arranging the tiles on walls, three rows placed horizontally alternating with one vertical row, while popular in the Southern Dynasties tombs, can also be found in some of the Northern brick tombs (Figs. C,I).74 The floor, described by the Chinese as having a brick pattern which is jen shaped (i.e., herringbone), was also found everywhere. Another feature common to brick tombs is present in Teng-hsien; the back wall has small niches which might have contained objects (Fig. 3). The one feature of the construction which can be considered unique is the use of closely spaced buttresses to line the walls (Figs. 2, 3). It is difficult to determine with any certainty if they were a structural necessity or a decorative innovation. But from the brief descriptions and drawings of the tomb, these buttresses were probably an added precaution to support the heavy barrel vaulted ceiling constructed with three layers of bricks. The truly distinctive aspect of Teng-hsien is the program of decoration inside the tomb. The mold impressed tiles which line the interior surfaces and the painting on the entrance archway display unusually fine execution and a rich decorative repertory. Until recently, Teng-hsien, the Seven Sages tomb (Fig. 75), and two tombs in the Nanking area, that of the Southern Ch'i Emperor at Hu-ch'iao (Fig. 36) and one attributed to Emperor Hsiian-ti of Ch'en, were the only examples from all three phases with such elaborate tile decoration. Teng-hsien was the only one which used large clay panels with pictorial scenes surrounded by smaller tiles with lotus vines and flowers from floor to ceiling (Figs. C,2-4).75 The Eastern Chin tomb recently excavated in Kiangsu, near Chen-chiang, and dated to 398 A.D., has a similar arrangement.76 The long walls are lined with large rectangular panels of about the same proportions as those at Teng-hsien, set into the wall at regular intervals and sepa- rated by smaller undecorated rectangular tiles which serve as borders (Figs. 76, 104). The pro- gram of decoration is limited to some ten different motifs, mostly mythological or symbolic animals; there are no pictorial scenes or lotus vines. However, the pressed tiles do show natura- listic vine-like borders. Although the quality is clearly inferior, both the subject matter and the stylistic treatment foreshadow the decorative vocabulary at Teng-hsien and Tan-yang. Besides the Chen-chiang tiles, the only others comparable to Teng-hsien's in format are a group of molded tiles found in Hupei. Brief notes in 195 6 and I972 archeology journals reported 74 The recently excavated tomb of Ssu-ma Chin-lung near Ta-t'ung, Shansi provides an example of a Northern Dynasties brick tomb with the same pattern of arranging tiles. This pattern may be imitative of earlier Southern practices around Loyang. An excavation report of a Southern Dynasties tomb near Ch'ang-sha point out that this method of arranging tiles was very common in Hunan and Southern Dynasties tombs. This alternating pattern gives way in the T'ang Dynasty to one of straight horizontal rows, Wen Wu, I960, no. 2, pp. 49-54. 75 This method of insetting large tile panels with pictorial decoration surrounded by borders of small narrow tiles began as early as Eastern Han. The report of Eastern Han brick tombs found in the Ch'ing-pai District in Szechwan shows this kind of arrangement of decorated tiles on the upper section of the north wall of the chamber, Wen Wi, I 956, no. 6, p. 36. Judging from the large number of tile panels with pictorial scenes from Szechwan published by Rudolph, Nos. 76-I00, this must have been common or popular in this area. 76 See Wen WVu, I973, no.4, p. 56. This tomb is dated by an inscription on tile to the second year of Lung-an or 398 A.D. 20</page><page sequence="33">the excavation of several Six Dynasties tombs located at Wu-ch'ang near Hankow.77 Generally, these brick tombs also have rectangular or oblong chambers with narrower entrance corridors, tunnel vaulted roofs, and some tile decoration with floral motifs. From the several tombs found in 1956 only one published tile closely resembles those from Teng-hsien (Fig. 2). 78 The tile shows an immortal teasing a striding dragon ridden by a figure wearing long robes with trailing scarves; swirling clouds and flowers fill the surrounding space. Unfortunately, the article provi- des no other specifics. The more recent report, about a tomb excavated in I972,79 published six tiles (Fig. ioI) with figures and floral motifs comparable to some in Teng-hsien. The five elaborate brick tombs, Teng-hsien, Seven Sages, Chen-chiang, Hu-ch'iao, Hsiian-ti of Ch'en, plus the tiles from Wu-ch'ang suggest that the Southern Dynasty artists explored the potentials of brick tomb decoration while the North did not. Recent excavations of brick or pit tombs in the North have not yet revealed any highly developed tile decoration. In many ways Teng-hsien still remains a unique production. 77 "Summary of the Preservation and Discovery of Cultural Objects from Wu-Han Municipality," (in Chinese), Wen Wu, I956, no.7, pp. 17-19 and "Discovery of an Ancient Tomb at Wu-chia-wan, Wu-ch'ang," (in Chinese), Wen Wu, 1975, no. 6, pp. 93-94. 78 Ibid., apparently three other tiles from this site were given to the Hermitage Museum in Leningrad as a gesture of Sino- Soviet detente in the late 1950's but unfortunately they remain unpublished and unavailable. 79 Five wu-chu coins found in this grave were of a type initially cast during Liang Wu Ti's reign in 523. According to the report, the possible date of the tomb on the basis of these as well as other coins is no earlier than 5 23 and no later than the third year of Ch'en Wu Ti's reign or 563. Wen Wu, I975, no.6, p.94. The elongation of the figures and the sculptural qualities visible in the poor photographs of ming-ch'i suggest a mid-sixth century date. 21</page><page sequence="34">CHAPTER III DECOR, MOTIFS, AND STYLE DECORATIVE SCHEME T he most distinctive aspect of Teng-hsien is the rich repertory of representational scenes and floral patterns, all unusually well executed.80 Unfortunately, with the collapse of the ceiling vault and the unsystematic removal of tiles from the tomb, the overall decorative scheme has been lost. Few of the large pictorial tiles remain on the wall. A diagram (Fig.C) published in the excavation report shows nine pictorial tiles on the east wall and three on the west wall.81 Photo- graphs of the tomb's interior and descriptions in the text reveal additional tiles not mapped in the diagram. The north wall retains six large tiles. Standing guardian figures, each composed of two large tiles (Figs. 4, 54), occupy the bottom of the north wall and every buttress in the main chamber and entrance passageway as well.82 Many smaller tiles with floral motifs also apparently remained on the wall, (Fig. 4), but their precise positions are not given. In spite of the vague and incomplete descriptions, however, some sense of subject matter and organization survives. The side walls in the main chamber have eight buttresses, each with space for five large tiles; the north wall has two buttresses, each with three spaces (Figs. B, 4). All walls have guardian figures filling the bottom two tiers, creating an honor guard around the chamber. Above the sentinels on the north wall are two bsian-wu (Figs. C, 4, 14). The other three directional symbols (Figs.C, i6, I7, 22) must have stood on the other walls, probably in the fifth tier closest to the ceiling. A number of tiles (Figs.C, 32, 34, 3 5, 43-48, 49, I-5 2), including five in their original positions on the east wall, depict parts of an impressive military escort for the deceased with foot soldiers, musicians, and dignitaries. In the procession an empty palanquin (Fig. 41), an empty ox- cart (Figs. 37-39), and a riderless horse (Fig. 34) are pointed remainders of the deceased, un- questionably a man of rank. Most likely, the first six buttresses, third and fourth tiers, (Fig.C) just above the large guardians on both walls, were devoted to the theme of the procession.83 Since it is unclear whether this escort begins in the main chamber or entrance passageway, the 80 Any discussion or classification of the decorative repertory in Teng-hsien must be qualified by two factors: I) the poor quality of the available photographs and 2) the real possibility that the original publication is not complete; tiles may have been completely destroyed when the ceiling vault collapsed, may have been lost, or may remain unpublished. 81 Teng-hsien, p.z. 82 Ibid., p. I , Figs. I, 3, and 4; p. 20, Fig. 20. The text on page two of the Teng-hsien report and the description under the photograph on p. zo20 state that there is one guardian figure at the bottom on each buttress. 83 All but one of the tiles which depict parts of a procession remain on the east wall; an ox-cart, a common form of trans- portation for dignitaries and aristocrats during this period is on the west wall. There is little question that the procession occupied both walls; the large proportion of tiles devoted to the theme supports this assumption. Furthermore, the tiles can also be divided into groups by the direction in which figures move. Tiles on the east wall show figures marching to the right while the ox-cart on the west wall moves left. 23</page><page sequence="35">Main Chamber Entrance Passageway West Wall r~-'-u-_-u1 bflThF Fig. B Ground plan of Teng-hsien tomb I I qz-l East Wall ~~~I ~~~~ I ommo</page><page sequence="36">East Wall West Wall -- .

Finally, on the seventh buttress, fourth tier, two paragons of filial piety display their virtue, Kuo Chii on the east wall (Fig. 71) and Lao Lai- tzu on the west wall (Fig. 74). The two tiles illustrating the Taoist legends of Wang Tzu-ch'iao (Figs. 68, 69) and another showing the Four Greybeards of Shang Mountain (Fig. 73) would be placed here with the filial piety stories. Although the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove are con- sidered the patron saints of Neo-Taoism and frequently represented in the tombs around Nanking, the Four Greybeards, also recluses from society, would play the same role.84 Given the upsurge of Neo-Taoism in the fourth and fifth centuries, Taoist legends and related subjects like the Seven Sages probably achieved equal stature with the venerable Confucian virtue of filial piety. In the narrow entrance passage, each wall has four buttresses with space for three large tiles (Figs. B, C). As in the main-chamber, guardians fill the bottom of each buttress. Only two other tiles, depicting pairs of lions (Fig. 30), remain in their original positions opposite each other on the first buttress closest to the doorway (Fig.C). Two guardians like those lining the interior tomb walls are elegantly painted on either side of the doorway along with two apsarases and a central grotesque animal mask.85 On the side walls of the main chamber and the entrance passageway in the tiers closest to the ceiling (Fig.C) are spaces which cannot be accounted for. Just above these tiers on the buttresses, the barrel vault ceiling would have begun. A few tiles (Figs. 19, 23, 28, 57, 59) published in the report do not fit into any of the categories of subject matter discussed so far. They show magical, mythological or Buddhist subjects-human-headed bird messengers, dragons, apsarases, etc. Like the directional animals, these would appropriately fit into the celestial realms of the fifth and highest tier. The ceiling was apparently decorated with variegated floral motifs. Many of the subjects and the overall organization found in the Teng-hsien tomb reach back to the Han. Processions of chariots and officials, staples of Han tomb decor, can be found paint- ed, stamped in clay, or carved in stone on innumerable tomb walls.86 Both directional animals and filial piety paragons became popular by the Eastern Han. The arrangement of the decor reflects a concept fundamental to Han tombs - the burial chamber viewed as a microcosm of the universe, literally or symbolically.87 Usually, the side walls of the tomb on the lower levels are reserved for earthly concerns, the upper levels and ceilings for the celestial or spiritual.

Animal masks, as mentioned in Chapter I, n. 46, holding garlands in their teeth or alternating with apsarases are found in early sixth century caves in Lung-men, Yu Hsi-ning, ed. Pei- ei shibh-k'ufou-tiao chib p'ien-hsiian (Peking, I95 8), pp. 34- 6, nos. 8, 19). 86 An elaborate procession containing all the elements represented in Teng-hsien was painted on the wall of a Chinese minister's tomb, Anak, North Korea, dated 357 A.D., K'ao-ku, I959, o. x, pp. 27-3 5. 87 This concept becomes one of the standard formats visible in Han tomb decoration from about the first century B.C. For a few examples see Western Han tomb no. 6 near Loyang which has a ceiling with constellations and lunar mansions; the side walls show elaborate banquets, see Jonathan Chaves, "A Han Painted Tomb at Loyang," pp. 5-27; P'ing-lu Hsien in Shansi Province, K'ao-ku, 1959, no. 9, pp.462-463; 468, Ho-lin-gol, Inner Mongolia, Wen Wu, I 974, no. I, pp. 8-24, 38- 5o; and familiar carved stone reliefs from the sacrificial shrines of the Wu family. 26</page><page sequence="38">cept persists after the fall of Han and is evident in Southern Dynasties tombs like Teng-hsien and the more recently excavated tombs from Tan-yang around Nanking.88 One of the great difficulties with the Teng-hsien tomb has been its "uniqueness." Until recently, no other brick tombs with comparable ornamentation were known. With the discovery of the three large brick tombs at Hu-ch'iao and Chien-shan in Tan-yang County, Kiangsu, Teng- hsien has gained a context. All three tombs share a similar decor which exhibits remarkable parallels with that of Teng-hsien.89 In the Tan-yang tomb chambers, the subjects on the walls divide into three tiers. 90 A marching procession of musicians, armed warriors, attendants with feathered fans and canopies, and bodyguards occupied the lowest level near the floor. Just above, in the middle tier, the directional animals dominated the east and west walls. Here the compo- sitions are more complex than Teng-hsien's. Each animal is "teased" by an immortal or hsien (Figs. 8, ).9 Swirling floral twists float in the background. Although the other directional animals did not survive intact, bits of inscriptions on broken tiles refer to the presence of the Red Bird and the hslan-wu. A tile fragment with a hexagonal tortoise shell pattern further confirms the dark warrior's existence.92 The Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove with Jung Ch'i-ch'i are lined four by four behind the two directional beasts. The uppermost or third tier nearest the ceiling was apparently filled with apsarases or t'ien-jen. At the entrance passage stands a pair of lions, each flanked by a warrior, a combination also found in Teng-hsien's entrance.93 Teng-hsien's decor is consistentwith the Tan-yang tombs andwith what was fashionablearound the Southern capital during the late fifth century at the end of the Southern Ch'i dynasty.94 Both groups of tombs emphasize the tenacity of Han traditions in the South, and at the same time reflect the numerous changes wrought by the collapse of Han and the barbarian invasions. New forces such as Buddhism inspired new subjects like the apsarases. Floral motifs replaced or enriched the typical cloud and geometric patterns of Han in the celestial realm on ceilings and walls.9s 88 Wen Wu, I974, no.2, pp.44-56; Lin Shu-chung, pp.64-73. This concept and program of decoration continues in Southern Dynasties tombs apparently through early T'ang, see a Sui tomb excavated outside Ch'ang-sha, K'ao-ku, I965, no. 5, pp. 226-229 and another found in Chang-chou outside Nanking, Wen Wru, 1979, no. 3, pp. 32-41. 89 The major difference between the Tan-yang tombs and Teng-hsien is the method of decoration. Teng-hsien confines each pictorial scene, except for the guardian figures, to one large tile. This approach is used in many Han tombs and an Eastern Chin tomb in the Nanking area, dated 398, Chen-chiang Municipal Museum, "An Eastern Chin Tomb with Representa- tional Bricks at Chen-chiang," (in Chinese), Wen Wu, I973, no.4, pp. 5 I-58. At Tan-yang and the earlier tomb with the Seven Sages mural at Hsi-shan-ch'iao, tiles are assembled like a puzzle to create a large wall mural. This technique suggests that paintings were transferred to tomb walls. 90 Wen Wu, 1974, no. 2, pp. 48-49. 9' This subject, an immortal teasing tiger or dragon, also finds precedents in Han. An immortal holding a magical plant and teasing a winged horse is visible on the left pillar of P'ing-yang in Szechwan, Victor Segalen, Chine, La Grande Statuaire, (Paris: 197I), p-71 and 74, no.i. Another similar but more complex composition found on a tile from Wu-ch'ang shows an immortal teasing a dragon ridden by a robed figure, Wen Wu, 1956, no. 7, pp.I7-19. 92 Lin Shu-chung, p. 65. From the size of the tile fragment with tortoise shell pattern, 6 cm. long and 3 cm. wide, this hsiian- wu must have been large and dominated the north wall. 93 Susan Bush points out in "Floral Motifs," p. 5I, n. 9, that lions flanked by guardians in the entrance passageway are an arrangement reminiscent of later Buddhist stelae. 94 The decorative vocabulary described for both Teng-hsien and Tan-yang was clearly well established by Southern Ch'i. A descriptive passage from the Southern history recounts the program of decoration in a series of palace halls built to replace those burned in a disastrous fire of 501. Flying immortals, the Seven Sages, supernatural creatures, divine birds, and wind blown clouds covered the walls and ceilling. Soper, Textual Evidence, p. 19, no. 20. 95 For the development of floral motifs during the Six Dynasties, see Susan Bush, "Floral Motifs," pp. 49-83 . She comments on the role of floral motifs in the main composition at the large tomb at Hu-ch'iao, Tan-yang: "Throughout the compo- 27</page><page sequence="39">FLORAL PATTERNS Floral patterns clearly play an important role in the decorative scheme; they are used on the ceil- ing, in corners (Fig. 4) and as fillers or borders between or on the larger pictorial tiles.96 All available spaces contain luxuriant floral ornament. On the Teng-hsien tiles, the floral patterns occur in three basic forms: i) scrolls or vines, 2) large single flowers forming medallions or squares, and 3) single floating or rotating flowers and bouquets. The variation of forms within these three groups further emphasizes the extravagant decorative vocabulary of this tomb. i) Scrolls or Vines Within the first group, variations of single stem vines with flowers or leaves are used as borders to frame representational scenes (Figs. i6, 19, 24, 28, 41, 5 I, 52, 5 8, 71,72, 74) and in one instance a lo- tus medallion (Fig. 6). One frequently used form has an undulating stem with sprigs of leaves reg- ularly spaced above and below the stem. Each sprig has four elegantly tapered leaves which fan out into the curve of the stem. Some, like the borders (Figs. 5 I, 52, 5 8), can be classified as half palmette scrolls. Though this vine has a repetitive and stylized form, it flows with a graceful organic energy intensified by the slender and sharply pointed leaves (Figs. 5 I, 52). Other varia- tions of this vine have more leaves or are less regular (Figs. 6, 24,7 1,72). According to the available archeological evidence, this type of vine first emerges in the South. What seems to be the earliest example appears on impressed bricks from the early to mid-fifth century grave at Hsi-shan-ch'iao (Fig. 77), famous for the Seven Sages composition.97 The thicker stem of this vine makes it far less elegant than the Teng-hsien counterparts.98 Examples become more numerous in the late fifth and early sixth centuries; one comes from the molded bricks in the Liu family tomb dated 499 A.D. by Southern Ch'i reckoning at Ch'ang-sha (Fig. 79).99 A second, on a brick in an un- dated tomb in the suburb of Wu-ch'ang, Hupei, not far from Ch'ang-sha, reflects the lavish floral motifs typical of Southern tastes by the sixth century (Fig. 90).Ioo The third, which the Japanese archeologist Sekino saw in the Nanking museum and dated to the Liang Dynasty, occurs as a sition swirl floral twists reminiscent of the auspicious rains of flowers mentioned in Buddhist texts just as the wind-blown cloud puffs indicate vapor or ch'i associated with the supernatural realm in Han art." p. 5 I. A very early prototype for floral patterns on the ceilings can be found in the 3rd century A.D. tomb of I-nan where lotuses, diamond patterns, and early types of immortals fill the ceiling, Tseng, I-nan, p.6, Fig. 24 7, Fig. 25, Pls. 8 , 29, 2 38, 39, 46, 47, 74, and 8I. 96 Recently excavated material from tomb sites around the former Southern capital has emphasized the importance of floral motifs in understanding not only the development of Southern Dynasties art but also the relationship between the North and South. Susan Bush's recent article provides analysis of the emergence of floral motifs in the South and their subse- quent influence in the North, see "Floral Motifs," pp.49-83. 97 Wen VWu, , , nos. 8-9, p. 39, fig. 8. For a discussion of the date see Soper, "Discovery," pp. 78-86 and Bush, "Floral Motifs," pp. 5 4-5 5. A tomb excavated at Chen-chiang in I972 and dated to 398 also has an undulating vine with alter- nating leaves as borders. However, the leaves are not tapered forms but simple thin curved lines, see Wen Wu, 1973, no. 4, p. 5 7, Figs. 40, 41. 98 Another, similar to a vine at Hsi-shan-ch'iao, frames the standing Buddha's head in the aureole of a gilt bronze in the Musee Guimet from the Liu Sung Dynasty, dated by inscription to 478 A.D. On this piece as well as several others in private collections, unusual floral medallions alternate with flying apsarases along the edge of the aureole.

Another Southern Dynasties tomb from Wu-ch'ang, also undated, has two tiles with borders which look very much like the vine scroll under discussion, but the rubbings included in the report are fuzzy.

In the North, both Buddhist cave temples of Yiin-kang and Lung-men also include vines of this type. Caves 7 and 8 in Yiin-kang, datable to the 470's, display a vine with the same character- istics, particularly the small lentil-shaped leaf or bud where the main stem and small branch meet (Fig. 82).102 The one found around the Buddha's halos in the Lotus Cave in Lung-men from the 520's is similar but not identical; the leaves are thicker and one leaf curls under the stem, adding an extra flourish (Fig. 83).I03 Four tiles have a different vine border, like a series of individual plants growing out from each corner of the tile (Figs. i6, I9, 24, 28). Each plant has an undulating stem dotted with tapered leaves and delicate flowers. In contrast to the rhythmic repetitiveness of the preceding vine, variety and irregularity create fluent naturalistic plant forms. When he found a similar flowering plant on the Liang tiles noted earlier, Sekino identified it as honeysuckle.Io4 Nagahiro notes that both honeysuckle and lotus motifs were prevalent in the Six Dynasties and points to what are perhaps the earliest Far Eastern representations of honeysuckle in a border from the I-nan stone reliefs (Fig. 84).Io05 This naturalistic plant form may have been derived from earlier Han sources. Even though the floral spray on the Han tomb tile from Hsui-chou, Kiangsu, cannot be speci- fically identified as honeysuckle, it certainly shares the general character of the plant on the Teng- hsien tiles (Figs. I4, i6, 19, 28).106 Again, although similar plants occur in Northern Wei Buddhist art, the best comparable examples can be found on the Nanking tiles attributed to the Liang Dynasty (Fig. 85) and on another tile found in the Hsin-ning brick and tile factory, No. i around Nanking datable to the early sixth century (Fig. 86:2).I07 The rubbing from the back of Prince Hsiao Hung's stele of about 5 26 in the Liang Dynasty shows a more sinuous and lush version of this honeysuckle spray as does the side of the stele (Fig. 87).Io8 Three long horizontal tiles are decorated with several different floral motifs (Fig. 13). One shows a motif of four pairs of short S-shaped vines with leaves repeated across the tiles. Curious- ly, one of the four S-shaped pairs is irregular, either from damage or poor execution. Such S-shaped vine scrolls appear in the sides of the inscription plaque on Prince Hsiao Ching's stone pillar of about 523 A.D. and on tiles from the undated tomb in the north east suburb of Wu- ch'ang (Fig. 80).Io9 Both these examples have more visual coherence.

This vine appears in Yiin-kang about twenty years later than the earliest Southern example at Hsi-shan-ch'iao. Susan Bush in her study of floral motifs attributes the origin of this vine to foreign stimulation from objects imported from the West. It is possible that the Yiin-kang example is the result of Southern influence or foreign influence via Buddhism since other floral motifs of the 470's and 480's find their origins in Kizil and other Central Asian sites.

A simi- lar or at least related pattern forms part of the border along two sides of the Buddha's aureole in the Lotus Cave at Lung-men (Fig. 83).IIo This pattern is more stylized; the paired S-vines join at one end creating an oval around a four petalled flower. Although it is difficult to draw any secure conclusions about the relationship of motifs, the formalization of the Lung-men version sug- gests derivation from the freer, less stylized type found in Teng-hsien. On another horizontal tile appears a scroll or rinceau constructed of circular volutes, alter- nately filled with leaves or flowers. The small delicate flowers tucked inside every other volute would make this a honeysuckle rather than lotus scroll. Within this repetitive structure, delight- ful variations emerge from volute to volute. Another tile from the tomb at Lan-ni-ch'ung near Ch'ang-sha dated 499 has a similar but simpler form of this rinceau (Fig. 79; right).III There are similar scrolls in both the Buddhist and secular arts of North China, again raising the question of how these "similar" examples relate to Teng-hsien. The honeysuckle scroll in the central Pin- yang cave, dated ca. 5 5-5 I0, in Lung-men is perhaps the closest in detail (Fig. 88).II2 This scroll is enclosed in a border. Each volute has a single honeysuckle flower with four leaves arranged symmetrically on each side. The top leaf on each side extends outward and curls under and around the encircling stem. Such a flourish is characteristic of all comparable examples from both the Buddhist and the secular arts of North China, Korea, and Manchuria. For examples see the epitaph cover of Hou Kang dated 5 26 (Fig. 89); Cave 4 or Northern Hsiang T'ang-shan (Fig. 90); the Four Spirits tomb, T'ung-kou, nManchuria (Fig.9); and the main chamber of the Sam- myoli tomb No. 2, Korea.II3 2) Large simple flowers forming medallions or squares Within the second group, lotus medallions occur in two types. An eight-petalled lotus within a circular border is the simpler (Figs. 6,7, 8, Io).I4 Broad flat petals radiate from a circular center (stigma), usually detailed with small raised circles. I5 One large lotus medallion consists of four separate tiles (Fig. 8). Sometimes these simple medallions are further embellished at the corners 110 Yu Hsi-ning, ed., Pei Wei shih-k'u, Lung-men, Lotus Cave, p. 50, no. 28.

In some form, the lotus is found in every scene directly or indirectly related to the Buddhist religion. Examples of lotus flowers can be found in later Han Art, particularly in the regions of Hunan and Yiinnan, and into the early Six Dynasties period. Michael Sullivan believes that the arrival of Buddhism in the Han Dynasty is not responsible for the introduction of this flower into Han Art, The Birth of Landscape Painting in China, pp. 140-I. Even so, it was not until the florescence of Buddhist art in the fifth and sixth century that the presence of the lotus in both Buddhist and non-Buddhist arts is really felt. Aside from tiles like those in Teng-hsien and the Nanking area, the lotus is found on pottery vessels, stone epitaph covers, and sarcophagi and in wall paintings in Korea and Manchuria. As Cheng Te-k'un points out, the Six Dynasties artist clearly enjoyed incor- porating this "new" floral motif into his art, "Jade Flowers and Floral Patterns in Chinese Decorative Art," Journal of the Institute of Chinese Studies, II, 2 (Sept., 1969), p. 69. 115 Although more restrained and geometric in character, lotus medallions on the walls of the large brick tomb at Hu-ch'iao are comprised of two tiles; each is divided in half vertically, Wen Wu, I974, no. 2, p. 5 5, Fig. 26. 30</page><page sequence="42">by honeysuckle leaves. These additional leaves either grow out from the lotus or in from the corners and fan out to fill the small triangles left between the circular medallion and the square shape of the tile. Some medallions appear "snow flake-like" and assume a square form; the honeysuckle expands to form a delicate filigree of flowers and leaves around a small central lotus medallion (Figs. 5, 13, 56). The coffered ceiling in Cave 5 at Kung-hsien has a similar "square medallion" (Fig. 92).II6 The arrangement of parts is identical, but the leaves and flowers are sim- plified and less delicate. A circular version also floats just in front of the "Immortal Teasing the Tiger" from Hu-ch'iao, ca.495.117 The second type of medallion can be described as a "rotating" one. A small flower floats in the center, long tapered leaves extending out and curving in one direction, creating a "pinwheel" effect (Figs. i , 12). A similar medallion is found in the coffered ceiling in Cave 5 (ca. 5 20's) at Kung-hsien (Fig. 92).II8 In this example, the curved leaves which rim the central lotus flower are less delicate, and there is no circular border. One tile fragment shows a complicated medallion combining all three elements, simple lotus, rotation, and elaborate honeysuckle (Fig. 9). Some interesting visual effects are created. The central eight petalled lotus medallion is rimmed by a series of curved leaves which seem to rotate around it. Four large clusters of honeysuckle grow out from the corners and the spaces between the leaf clusters are filled with small flowers and vines. Except for the absence of leaf clusters, the medallion found on the tile from the Nanking area is very similar (Fig. 93).19 A double medal- lion from the Hsin-ning Brick and Tile Factory has the same structure but is executed with thin almost spindly forms in contrast to the fullness of Teng-hsien's. (Fig. 86: 8).I2o Except for the example found at Kung-hsien, the floral medallion as such does not seem to occur frequently in the Northern Buddhist cave temples. However, the basic shape and organi- zation of elements in the smaller aureoles behind the Bodhisattvas evoke the medallion form. For example, the one in Cave 5 at Yiun-kang shows a central lotus enclosed in a border rimmed by a pattern of curved leaf shapes also encircled by a border (Fig. 94). The outer border, however, becomes slightly oval, tapering to a point. The effect is different from the rotating lotus medal- lion. Rather than creating a sense of rotation, the curved leaves move upward on each side and join under the point to form a large central leaf.I2 Most of the medallions in Southern brick tombs, Hu-ch'iao, Wu-ch'ang and others, possess elements comparable to the Teng-hsien examples but only in the broadest sense. None approach the diversity and richness of the vocabulary. Other tiles with lotus medallions of this type were found by Sekino in northeast Koshu (old capital of Kudara or Paekche) and at the old tomb in Shozanri, northwest of Koshu. One of these Korean tiles has two corner clusters of honeysuckle leaves and half a central lotus embellished with small dots or circles (Fig. 85).I22 Apparently, since i 6 A good photograph of the coffered ceiling in Cave 4.

One Paekche king sent an envoy to the Liang court requesting sutras, commentaries, professors of poetry, artisans, and painters.123 The request was granted. Similar, less official requests to the Liang court may have often been grant- ed. This cultural link between Paekche and the Southern Court finds further support from the discovery of the brick tombs at Tan-yang. Tiles with decoration identical to those Sekino saw in Korea and at the Nanking Museum are found in the imperial grave at Hu-ch'iao. Sekino further reasons that this type of tomb construction and decoration was introduced from South China in the early sixth century since such decorated pottery tiles are so few in number around Koshu. Furthermore, the tomb found near Koshu (Shozanri) is a rectangular, barrel vaulted chamber constructed entirely out of bricks, unlike the stone normal in North Korean tomb architecture. As at Teng-hsien, these Korean decorated tiles were further embellished with paint, white, black and green.124 3) Single oating or rotatin g flowers and bouquets The third group are scattered in the background of some of the representational scenes. With the exception of the large guardian figures constructed from tiles, the flowers occur in non-military scenes of symbolic animals, filial piety stories, apsarases, Taoist legends, and musical proces- sions (Figs. 14, 17, I9, 22, 24, 27, 28, 30, 51, 52, 54, 55, 57-59, 71, 74)- They are used not only to fill up space but also to emphasize and respond to the intense movement of the major figures or animals depicted. Four or five petalled flowers with or without stems usually float, twirl, or hover in space, reflecting the tenor of the scene. In Fig. 5 I and 52, four petalled flowers float gently in the air above the heads of the dancers and musicians; those in Fig. I7 seem buffeted by the air churned up by the White Tiger of the West. Single six petalled flowers are used similarly in the stone relief panels depicting the symbols of the four directions on the epitaph cover of Ytuan Hui dated 5 20 (Fig. 95).125 Here they are placed to the right and left of the confronted pairs of animals. Similar flowers dot the background of the donor procession on the pedestal of Maitreya dated 5 25 (Fig. 96) and narrative panels of a later Eastern Wei stele dated 543.126 Examples can also be found in Lung-men, particularly caves dating from the 5 20's, Kung-hsien, Cave i, and Tun-huang Caves 285 and 249 (Figs. 97, 98).I27 The only examples from South China of scattered flowers appear around the immortal teasing the tiger at Hu-ch'iao, Tan- yang, with the vase carrying attendant on Hsiao Ching's plague (Fig. 99), and around fantastic figures in panels on the sides of the tombstone of Prince Hsiao Hung of the Liang Dynasty (ca. 123 King Munyong of Paekche, who ruled from 501 I to 5 23, sent embassies to the Southern capital of Chien-k'ang in 5 12 and 521 and was given the title of Grand General of Paekche by Liang Wu Ti.

Cheng Te-k'un believes that such a motif is predominantly Buddhist in concept.I29 A variation of the single flower occurs on four tiles (Figs. i, 17, 30, 57), four to six petalled flowers form a center from which two or four tails of slender waving leaves emerge. This version can be seen swooping alongside the White Tiger of the West, hovering between two lions, or floating as a canopy over two apsarases. Two types of floral bouquets frequently appear in both Buddhist and secular art of North China. One is the simple bouquet composed of several flowers and leaves, honeysuckle and lotus, which are joined at the bases of their stems or placed in vases. One appears on either side of the Dark Warrior of the North (Fig. I4). Several interesting variations fill the space on both sides of the large standing guardian figures on the back wall of the chamber (Figs. 54, 5 5). The only com- parable example found so far from the South occurs on a rectangular tile from Wu-ch'ang near Ch'ang-sha (Fig. IoI :4).130 Even hampered by the blurred rubbing in the report, it is still possible to see a vase with a bunch of slender stems and flowers emerging from a flower much like those in Teng-hsien.131 This simple bouquet commonly appears in Buddhist cave temples, stelae, and epitaph covers."32 The second bouquet is not only a ubiquitous type found at Teng-hsien as well as in Buddhist and secular art but also has an unusual appearance (Figs. 19, 22, 24, 30, 54, 55, 5 8, 59, 69, 74). It is usually tucked into the background spaces on the tiles and appears to hover in the air. At the center is an egg-shaped flower bud with a small cluster of leaves attached to the pointed end and a thick tail of leaves at the rounded end. In Teng-hsien, they are oriented with the pointed end of the center bud always upright. This position and the placement of the leaves at times give the bouquet anthropomorphic overtones (Figs. 54, 74). Moulded tile decoration in the large Southern Dynasties tomb excavated at Hu-ch'iao near Nanking has similar bouquets.133 Variations of this bouquet, usually simplified, are also tucked into reliefs at Kung-hsien, Lung- men, and on Buddhist stelae.134 According to Susan Bush's study, vines played a more important role in northern ornament in the late fifth century while the South preferred floral twists, bouquets and ground filler. Bouquets do not appear in the North until the early sixth century, in the second decade or so.135 Two tiles have half human and half floral motifs which defy classification (Fig. 13).

Scarves and leafy vines float upward around her and scarves also cross in Wei style in front of her body. Her left hand grasps the handle of some unidentified object. Two clusters of leaves sit on top of her head with one leaf hanging down on either side. It is not unlike the headdresses or tied-up hair worn by the attendant figures of the Empress and her court from the Pin-yang cave in Lung-men (Fig. 02o).136 In fact, the long robes also display significant similarities, particularly the broad flat folds of the skirt from which narrow vertical pleats emerge. The other tile shows the upper half of a figure emerging from a small single lotus flower, with scarves and leafy vines floating upward around the figure, suggesting a kind of "lotus birth." Similar "lotus births" also appear on the coffered ceiling of Cave I in Kung-hsien (Fig. 92) and the northwest corner of the Shih-k'u-ssu cave of Lung-men.137 This reflects a purely Buddhist concept of new souls being reborn into the Bud- dhist paradise. The prominence of floral motifs in the decorative scheme of Teng-hsien is characteristic of the fifth and sixth centuries when the taste for floral ornament flourished in both the North and the South. Most of the floral motifs are by no means unique; they are part of a common vocabu- lary which began to emerge in the South in the late fourth century and matured in the early sixth under the Liang Dynasty. By the second decade of the sixth century, this vocabulary apparently penetrated the North. Available evidence from excavations in the South remains meagre but significant. It allows Teng-hsien to be re-evaluated from a new perspective, although any definitive conclusions would be premature at this stage. The intricacy and richness of Teng-hsien's floral patterns clearly fall between the less developed late fifth century motifs from Tan-yang, particularly the imperial grave at Hu-ch'iao, ca. 495 and the Liu family grave at Ch'ang-sha, ca. 499, and the more extravagant and complex examples on Hsiao Hung's stele, ca. 5 26.I38 Clay tiles from Wu-ch'ang (Fig. 80) and Hsin-ning Brick and Tile factory (Fig. 86:2, 3, 7, 8), undated but probably early sixth century, possess comparable floral elements but do not approach the standard achieved at Teng-hsien. In addition, the small number of tiles recovered and published from these sites offers a very limited basis for comparison. These southern excavations not only provide some context for the Teng-hsien material but also emphasize the exceptional quality of its floral vocabulary which in many ways retains a singular character. First, the motifs display unequaled variety and inventiveness. Second, all, even the most stylized, are imbued not only with exuberant movement but also a sense of organic life. Third, allowing for the greater plasticity of clay, the elegant Teng-hsien floral forms have few competitors; they certainly challenge the best examples of the Northern Wei "linear" style, which dominates the second and third decades of the sixth century. The tomb that shows the closest kinship not only in motifs but also in execution is the late Koguryo tomb, Shinpari, No. i (Fig. 103). Even the poor photographs of the ceiling reveal the 136 Sickman and Soper, The Art and Architecture of China, p. Ioo. 137 Akiyama and Matsubara, Arts of China, Vol. 11, Kung-hsien, p. 135, no. 119 and Lung-men, p. 147, no. 136. 138 The floral twists on a guardian lion from an unidentified tomb at Tan-yang investigated in I968 seem most promising. Their complexity and extravagance seem closer to Teng-hsien floral twists than those at Hu-ch'iao, see comments and photo published by Susan Bush, "Floral Motifs, "Fig. 5, p. 55. The study photographs were taken by Professor James Cahill in the Kiangsu Provincial Museum in I973. 34</page><page sequence="46">same crisp and energetic plant forms.139 As mentioned earlier, the strong link between Paekche and the southern Liang Court is unmistakable when comparing floral motifs from Hsiao Hung's stele dated 526 and King Munyong of Paekche's golden cap ornament.140 This latter creation, discussed by Susan Bush, most likely reflects the fashionable trends of the Liang court around 520, the date incised on a silver bracelet found in the King's tomb.I41 Many of the floral motifs from the cave temples of Hsiang T'ang-shan, though later in date (s60o's-5 ), capture similar form and spirit and reflect the complete absorption of the southern floral vocabulary (Fig. 90). For example, the vine around a halo on the right wall of cave 7, in the southern group, and a large lotus and honeysuckle medallion as well as a bouquet of flowers in Cave 5 resemble their earlier counterparts in Teng-hsien, except that they are fuller and more lush. The intense linearism of Teng-hsien is replaced by the slow luxuriance of thick leaves which twist and curl about each other.I42 REPRESENTATIONAL ELEMENTS Besides the floral motifs, the other major subject in Teng-hsien is the representational elements or scenes. These, as indicated in Chapter I, can be divided into four groups: i) animals, whether real, fantastic, or symbolic, 2) human figures leading or riding animals, 3) human figures, alone or in groups, and 4) "story-telling" scenes. i) Animals, real, fantastic or symbolic Four tiles in this first category depict symbols of the directions: Black Warrior of the North (Fig. 14), White Tiger of the West (Fig. I 8), Green Dragon of the East (Fig. 22), and Red Bird of the South (Fig. i6). These four animals, referred to variously as ssu-ling, ssu-shen, and ssu-kung, are regarded as the rulers of the seasons and quadrants.143 Much later, they came to be associated with the twenty-eight "lunar mansions" constellations as well as having other protective and cosmological functions. The conceptual roots of these four directional symbols seem to reach back to the Shang Dynasty. Oracle bone inscriptions refer to categories or groups of four derived from both the 139 Umehara Sueji, "The Newly Discovered Tombs with Wall Paintings of Kao-kou-li Dynasty," Archives of the Chinese Art Society of America, VI (I952), Fig. 6, p.9. Throughout this study, the style and subject matter found on the Teng-hsien tiles have been consistently compared to examples, both wall painting and clay tiles, from Korean tombs found in the Kingdoms of Paekche and Koguryo. The cultural ties between Southern China and Paekche have been established by literary evidence and stylistic parallels. However, the Koguryo examples which also exhibit strong similarities to Teng-hsien present another problem. Given its geographic position the Kingdom of Koguryo maintained ties with North China. The Koguryo tombs with richly painted walls offer no inscriptions to secure their dates. The style exhibited in these late Koguryo tombs either came up through Paekche or spread from North China in the second decades of the sixth century. By then, the style so characteristic of Teng-hsien and Southern Non-Buddhist arts had become strongly entrenched in the North. 140 See p.25, n.ioi; p. 37, n. 122.

I43 The term, ssu-ling, seems to be the most common and is applied to both the four directional animals and a group of four supernatural animals which includes the ch'i-lin (unicorn), the feng-huang (phoenix), the tortoise and the snake, and the dragon.

A most interesting Han example of these creatures is painted on the ceiling of a tomb excavated in P'ing-lu County in Shansi.147 The four symbols are conspicuously absent among the meagre remains of fourth to late fifth century tombs. Only one example exists at this time, an Eastern Chin brick tomb excavated near Chen-chiang in Kiangsu and dated 398 A. D., where the animals play a significant role in the wall decoration (Figs. 76, 104).I48 In contrast, late fifth and early sixth century non-Buddhist arts in the North and South show a resurgence of the directional beasts. In the North, the four animals are used as major decorative motifs on many Northern Wei epitaph covers and in clay tomb sculpture. A description of state carriages in the Wei history mentions these beasts as one of the themes used for embellishment.I49 Recent excavations also confirm the popularity of this theme in the decor of southern tombs. Like Teng-hsien the three brick tombs from Tan-yang County include these familiar creatures.'50 They also recur prominently in mirror decoration in the Liang (?), Sui, and T'ang Dynasties as well as on the painted walls of late Koguryo tombs.I51 144 The various names for the four directional symbols may reflect their early origin.

Extensive wall paintings apparently covered the wall of this part brick, part hollow tile tomb dated to the first century B.C. (86 to 49 B.C.). For the excavation report, see, The Loyang Museum, "Report on the Western Han tomb of Pu Ch'ien-ch'iu with Wall Paintings Found at Loyang," Wen Wu, I977, no. 6, pp. I-i2; The wall and ceiling paintings include three of the four directional animals, red bird, white tiger, and green dragon, among other cosmological symbols. In a subsequent article discussing the interpretation of these paintings, Sun Tso-yun suggests that the animals were originally clan symbols which by the Warring States and Han, became tomb guardians to ward off evil spirits. "Analysis of the Wall Paintings from the Western Han Tomb of Pu Ch'ien-ch'iu," Wen Wu, 1977, no. 6, pp. 17-22. 146 By Han the concept of the four directions became synonymous with an orderly universe. Han emperors created enor- mous imperial hunting parks not only for their amusement but also as microcosms of all that was under Heaven. Animals which stocked these mega parks were placed symbolically according to their appropriate position or direction in the universal scheme. See Edward H. Schafer, "Hunting Parks and Animal Enclosures in Ancient China," Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient, i (I 968), 3 I 8-343.

The chapter on auspicious signs in the Nan Ch'i Shu frequently mentions sightings of these symbolic creatures along with a menagerie of other auspicious creatures, Nan Ch'i Shu, (Peking, 1972), Chapter 18, pp. 349-368. Alexander Soper, in "The Jen-Shou Mirrors, Addendum," Artibus Asiae, XXIX, i (1967), p. 62, attributes the excessive interest of Southern rulers in omens to the precariousness of the South and the succession of weak rulers on the throne. More recently, Lin Shu-chung in his discussion of the Tan-yang material also described the Southern rulers as superstitious where dreams including auspicious omens were used to legitimize claims to the throne, Wen Wu, I977, no. I, p.67. I5I Dr. Soper proposes that the revival of interest in the directional animals for use on mirrors was initiated in the Southern Chinese empire, specifically, the Liang Dynasty, "The Jen-Shou Mirrors, Addendum," pp. 5-66. See a Sui mirror 36</page><page sequence="48">Black Warrior of the North Of the four directional zoomorphs, the Black Warrior of the North is the strangest and most fascinating. It is the only one of the four composed of two animals. Individually, tortoise and snake have acquired various mythological and symbolic connotations through the centuries.I52 Their combination seems to be the result of several legends woven together. The tortoise or kuei may have held a special meaning as early as the Shang when the large sternum was used for divination. It occurs as a pictograph on Shang bone and tortoise shell fragments.5s3 Subse- quently, the tortoise became an emblem of immortality and a powerful guardian of graves. Two symmetrically balanced tortoises inhabit the dark zone at the bottom of the silk banner recently discovered in the Western Han tomb at Ma-wang-tui near Ch'ang-sha.I54 In Chinese folklore, all tortoises are female and, to reproduce, must mate with a serpent. By extension, the snake and tortoise can also be regarded as symbolic of Yin and Yang, the primary creative forces. The snake wrapped around the tortoise reflects a union of two elements, not a struggle. In a recent Chinese article, giving surprising emphasis to anthropological rationalizations, this union was explained as a remnant of a cultural phase in which the turtle and snake clans intermarried under the dictates of exogamy.5ss The Teng-hsien black warrior shows a large tortoise with head turned back to confront the curling tongue and head of a snake whose elongated body loops around the tortoise's (Figs. 4, I4).156 The tortoise strides along on four long powerful legs, two of which have large distinct claws. A repeated hexagonal pattern with a zigzag border describes the texture of the bony cara- pace and parallel lines mark the sternum. The sinuous body of the snake is smooth except for a single raised ridge. On each side of the figures are floating flowers and a single four petalled flower. The combination of snake and tortoise appears in Han art in a much simpler and cruder form. In the Han versions on bronze mirrors and stone reliefs, the snake goes under the tor- toise's body once; the tail emerges toward the rear of the tortoise while the head curls around, confronting the tortoise's head.I57 A variation occurs on a "Shou-tai," animal border mirror in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.s58 The results in both are rather awkward. A more success- ful Han solution occurs on the stone coffin of Wang Hui, dated A.D.21I, Lu-shan, Szechwan (Fig. I05).159 Here, the snake curls around the tortoise's body, emerges behind the shell, and loops up so that the two heads confront. Occasionally, this version turns up in examples as late as the T'ang. excavated from a Ch'ang-sha tomb in K'ao-ku, 195 9, no. 3, p. 98, Fig. I 5 and a T'ang example published in Ars Buddhica, 87 (August, 1972), p. 30, Fig.4. 152 Morohashi, Vol. 2, no.48847, p.

I59 Rudolph, p. 74. 37</page><page sequence="49">It is obvious from these earlier representations that the artist was searching for a satisfying integration of the two animal forms to balance with the other three directional symbols compos- ed of only one animal. The best solution was achieved in the Six Dynasties. The snake encloses the tortoise as its body loops over and interlocks with its own tail. An early example of this type occurs on the tiles in the Chen-chiang tomb, near Nanking (Fig. Io4).160 This form that the black warrior assumes in the Nanking tomb at Chen-chiang (Fig. I04) and later at Teng-hsien survives at least through the Sung Dynasty. The Teng-hsien version has more unity. The confrontation of the two heads inside the enclo- sure creates a strong dramatic effect with movement and elegance emphasized by the curled tapering tail and tongue. Apparently, this form was also translated into pottery sculpture.161 Similar hsian-wu can be found on Northern Wei reliefs of the early sixth century. A close parallel occurs on the Yuian Hui epitaph cover, dated 5 8 (Fig. 95). Several comparable versions can also be found among the wall paintings of later Koguryo tombs, particularly the one on the west wall of Sammyoli, No. i (Fig. io06), and that on the north wall of the burial chamber of Shishinzuka, near T'ung-kou (Fig. Io7).162 Unfortunately, none of the hsiian-wu from the brick tombs from Tan-yang has survived intact. In the largest tomb at Hu-ch'iao, a fragment has a hexagonal tor- toise shell pattern comparable to Teng-hsien's.I63 By T'ang this same form had found its way to Japan as evidenced by the recently excavated wall paintings in Takamatsu tomb outside Nara and by the reliefs on the sides of the rectangular bronze pedestal of the Yakushi Buddha in Yakushi-ji, Nara.164 Red Bird of the South The directional symbol for the South is the red bird, chu-ch'io orfeng-huang, loosely translated in the West as "phoenix" (Fig. I6).165 Phoenix is a generic name applied to both the male and female forms of this auspicious bird. In theory, chu-ch'io and feng-huang are different birds. Richard Rudolph, in describing the elaborate birds in Han tombs from Szechwan, tries to make separate identifications, but in practice this distinction seems not to exist since both often look exactly alike.166 In Han tombs, the distinction is often unclear and probably irrelevant. Ambiguity in this case would be desirable since the symbolic functions of the birds do not conflict; in fact, the mystic power of the birds would be strengthened. 160 Wen Wu, I973, no.4, p. 56, Fig. 6. 161 Anthony Christie, Chinese Mythology (London: 1968), pp. 82-3, an earthenware bsiian-wu with white slip in the Seattle Museum of art.

Cheng Te-k'un suggests that the Red Bird who ruled the Southern quarter of the universe stemmed from Shang beliefs in the seven constellations in the southern firmament known collectively as hsing-niao or "star-birds;" apparently this name signified the god who reigned in the area.

Edward Schafer comments that the phoenix which roosted in the divine trees of the Han imperial parks cannot be assigned any scientific name but its presence was never doubted by the sober historians of the Han Shu, see "Hunting Parks," p. 3 30. 38</page><page sequence="50">This same ambiguity exists in Teng-hsien; both birds appear. Two tiles (Figs. 68, 69) show the feng-huang who has come down from heaven to dance to the music of Wang Tzu-ch'iao's mouth organ, and one tile shows the red bird which completed the group of directional animals in the tomb. However, this tile bears the character feng-huang (Fig. i6). All three birds in Teng-hsien have the same physical characteristics, collected from several different types of fowl. According to Sowerby, the rooster contributed the largest share, combs and wattles, flowing tail feathers, leg spurs, and feathers on neck and lower back. The beak has a hooked shape common to birds of prey. The long neck and legs suggest a crane and the upright wing plumes, a male mandarin teal.I67 These birds are depicted in their fullest glory on the Teng-hsien tiles. The Red Bird of the South stands proudly, dominating the tile with wings, head, and feet, and tail extending over the border of honeysuckle vines. On the left, the remaining space is occupied by two birds; a small one flying inward from the upper left corner and a larger one with an eggplant-shaped tail walk- ing along with upswept wings. On the right, four birds fly above and two walk below. The characters, feng-huang, are on the extreme right next to the border.168 The S-curved body of the red bird rises firmly on four-toed feet; pointed wings stretch up- ward forming a crescent shape on either side of the bird's head. The wings fan out at their base intensifying the sense of uplift. Raised parallel lines describe the feathers of the wings as well as the tail, legs, and neck. The upswept tail is defined as one solid tapered form; the sharply pointed beak grasps a small round bead or pearl.169 The Han representations of this bird vary greatly from simple crude forms to more elegant sophisticated versions, which are closely related to the Teng- hsien birds, such as the examples from the two stone pillars of Shen, in Chu-hsien, Szechwan, dated 121 A.D. (Figs. Io8, Io9).170 All have the same basic shape and identifying features but still I67 Sowerby, p. oi. 168 The Gulbenkian Museum in Durham, England, and the Brooklyn Museum in New York have tiles identical with the reverse composition of the Teng-hsien one (Fig. 16). Except for the absence of the two characters,feng and huang, these tiles appear almost identical to the Teng-hsien red bird. However, careful observation reveals definite but subtle differen- ces in the composition and treatment of individual elements. These differences are significant enough to encourage specu- lation about the origins of these tiles. The British and American tiles probably came from one mould but definitely a different one from Teng-hsien. Were these tiles from the Teng-hsien tomb itself? Or from another closely related one? The Gulbenkian and Brooklyn tiles probably came from a closely related tomb and were produced at a brick and tile factory in the South. Such factories would have moulds which followed set standards or fashions of the day. The dimensions of the three tiles are very close, British tile: I41/2' long x 7/s" wide; American tile: I4 /2' long x 7 3 " wide; Teng-hsien tile: 14.9" long x 71/2 wide x 2.3" thick. 169 Susan Bush refers to this type of raised tail as Southern since its earliest appearance seems to be on the pillar of Shen in Szechwan discussed below, "Thunder Monsters," p. 24. 170 Segalen, Fig. 14. Although the birds of these pillars have the same S-curved body and up-raised wings, the tails differ; one has three separate tail plumes and the other a single solid form with scalloped edge. Both forms persist into the Six Dynasties. In the South, Teng-hsien's birds and the one on Hsiao Hung's stele, ca. 5 26, have single plume tails, whereas the Korean birds often show three plume tails. Such tails are visible on Western Han hollow tiles found in the vicinity of Mou-ling, Western Han Emperor Wu Ti's mausoleum, Hsing-p'ing district, Shensi. Wang Chih-chieh, The Commis- sion for the Preservation of Cultural Monuments in Mou Ling and Chu Chieh-yiian, The Shensi Provincial Museum, "Important Relics Unearthed in the Vicinity of the Mou Ling (Mausoleum of Emperor Han Wu Ti) and its Satellite Tombs of the Western Han Dynasty," (In Chinese), Wen Wu, 1976, no. 7, p. 5 2, Fig. 3. Early sixth century birds carved on epitaph covers in the North seem to favor the three plumed tail. Unfortunately, the birds on the tiles from the Tan-yang tomb did not survive. One of the birds from Chu-hsien (Fig. o08) grasps a bead in its mouth. Recent excavations of the architectural remains of the palace at the Ch'in capital, Hsien-yang, uncovered fragments of hollow tiles. One tile fragment shows the neck and head of a bird; the sharp beak holds a small bead. Wen Wu, 1976, no. I , p. 20, Fig. 12. The remains from this Ch'in capital point to strong stylistic and iconographic links between Ch'in and Han art. 39</page><page sequence="51">display a wide range of variation. Some have more naturalistic details; others have separate tail plumes or lowered wings. Standing in a rain of floating flowers, the pair of birds from the sides of Hsiao Hung's stele, ca. 5 26, show marked similarities, particularly the one on the left (Fig. ioo). The birds closest in spirit and form occur on the south walls of the late Koguryo tombs, Sammyoli No. i and 2 and Shinpari No. i. In Sammyoli No. i, two birds flank the doorway framed by a floral border (Fig. I I ).I7I Except for the three separate tail plumes and comb, they are very simi- lar. Another bird in Sammyoli No. 2 holds a small bead in its sharp beak.172 The one in Shinpari is executed with the same vigorously drawn body with many analogous details (Fig. i IO).I73 The kinship between these tombs and Teng-hsien also extends to the rest of the decorative program including the other symbolic animals and floral patterns. White Tiger of the West The tiger, also one of the twelve animals of the Asiatic zodiac, long occupied an illustrious posi- tion in Chinese art and mythology. The tiger was frequently represented in Shang bone inscrip- tions and at large scale on royal stone chimes; these early pictographs show a striped tiger with fangs. In the Freer Gallery, a pair of hollow bronze images from the Chou Dynasty show an impassive but overwhelmingly powerful animal.I74 Tigers were considered the greatest of all four-footed creatures, the king of beasts, and also represented the female principle of Yin.175 From at least the Chou period, the white tiger has been identified with the Western quadrant. Han art also abounds with examples of tigers in motion on bronze and pottery vessels.I76 A North Korean wall painting from the Tomb of the Wrestlers, at T'ung-kou, shows tigers fleeing from pursuing mounted hunters.177 On the other hand, the protective role of the tiger is clearly indicated on two painted Han bricks from Szechwan which depict fierce stalking tigers with inscriptions: pi-hsieh, to avoid evil, and ch'u-hsiung, to remove evil.I78 The sinuous body of the Teng-hsien tiger strides forward, his long gait extending across the length of the tile (Fig. I7).I79 Raised parallel lines of varying lengths stream out from under the chin, upper neck, and legs, while across the body, pairs of lines form stripes. His motion gene- rates movement around him; floral bouquets and single flowers rush through surrounding space. Additional wavy lines under the rear legs intensify the sense of movement. An elegant S-shaped neck supports an erect head with red tongue and white teeth. Three spine-like projections at the shoulder replace the more explicit wings of Han tigers. The limbs bend with flexibility belying any bone structure. This device, visible in several animals in this tomb, creates a sense of light- ness and fluidity. 171 Ri-o Shoku, Sammyoli, No. I, south wall, P1. 22.

One tsou-yii's appearance, noted in the Nan Ch'i Shu, came in 478 and was considered a sign of the imminent transfer of authority from the last Sung ruler to the So. Ch'i founder. The beast is described as having a lion's head, a tiger's body, and a dragon's legs. Soper, "The Jen-Shou Mirrors: An Addendum," pp.62. 40</page><page sequence="52">In Han, the tiger is depicted in two basic ways, padding along on all fours with head upright or turned backwards alerted for danger, and leaping at or stalking prey. Many tigers are winged. The Teng-hsien tiger is closely related to the first Han type. Such similarities are obvious when the Teng-hsien tiger and a tiger-like animal in the inner medallion of a long familiar Han bronze bowl are compared (Fig. i I2).180 Both have the same walking stance, particularly the articulation of the outstretched back leg. The body of the Six Dynasties version has become more elongated and tapered but less naturalistic. On the west wall of the late fifth century tomb at Hu-ch'iao near Nanking, the magnificent striding tiger possesses a strikingly elongated body with typically flexible boneless limbs (Figs. i8, 20). However, even with all the analogous characteristics, the tiger still lacks the fluent gracefulness of Teng-hsien's style. A rather comparable pair of tigers can be found at Loyang on Yuan Hui's epitaph cover (Fig. 95). Here the legs have definite bone structure, and articulation of the outstretched rear leg works organically as it joins with the body. Clumps of fur at the neck and legs are transformed into solid flame shapes with incised lines. In addition, small flame shapes with incised semicircles are attached to the neck, rump, and tail. Tigers in the late Koguryo tombs are also close in form and intense movement to the Teng-hsien example; but they are far more exaggerated and grotesque.18' Another tile in the tomb shows a similar tiger-like animal being ridden by an elegantly robed lady (Fig. I9). By theme and category this belongs in the next group dealing with human figures and animals, but the tiger is so closely related, it seems appropriate to discuss it here. This tiger has the same basic shape as the preceding one, but the head is shorter, like the one on Yiian Hui's epitaph cover (Fig. 9 5). At the shoulder three spines partially merge into one form which more closely approximates a wing. The rider straddles the animal and holds the reins in her left hand and a bunch of flowers in her right.I82 Drapery flutters behind. The idea of human figures riding strange beasts is certainly not new in Chinese art. On the Wu Liang Tzu stones, to cite the most familiar example, figures in the world of Hsi Wang Mu ride dragon-like creatures.i83 Riders on phoenixes and dragons escort the chariots of Hsi Wang Mu and Tung Wang Kung on the early sixth century ceiling of Cave 249, Tun-huang.84 However, the earliest examples so far of direc- 180 M.Rostovtzeff, Inlaid Bronzes of the Han Dynasty in the Collection of C. T.Loo (Paris and Brussels; 1927), PI.IX, no. 3, details see P1. X. This bowl is presently in the Hosokawa Collection in Japan. The inlaid designs are now believed to have been painted. 18I Ri-o Shoku, Sammyoli II, west wall, P1.45. The tiger from Shinpari No. i is very close in form and in the floral motifs which swoop around it. However, the conception of the body fluctuates between a highly stylized two-dimensional rendition and a more solidly three-dimensional form, resulting in a more grotesque and exaggerated appearance, Umehara, "The Newly Discovered Tombs," Fig. 2, p. 8. I82 Since Teng-hsien has another tile with just a striding tiger (Fig. 17), this one with a rider (Fig. I9) cannot be construed as a directional beast but rather belongs to the Han tradition of feathered hsien riding their steeds, usually dragons or deer, through the heavens. During the Han when cosmology became more coherent, mortals remained separated from Heaven and immortality by a vast ocean of water or space. Immortals on their winged mounts could transverse the two realms. Achieving immortality, in one context, meant riding or ascending to heaven on a beast. An early legend recorded in the Han Fei T&lt;u described Huang Ti ascending to Heaven on the back of a dragon with his entire harem accom- panied by divine birds and dragon birds. Yu Ying-shih, "Life and Immortality in the Mind of Han China," Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies XXV (I964-5), pp.I05-6. Cheng Te-k'un, "Yin Yang Wu-hsing and Han Art," Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies, XX (I 957), pp. 162-186. During the Six Dynasties, this iconography is absorbed into Buddhism, most likely in the South first where Han traditions were more persistent. Buddhism, lacking a developed cosmology of its own, adopted the existing Chinese one. 183 Edouard Chavannes, Mission archeologique Vol.I (Plates) Wu Liang Tzu, Fig. 31. 184 Cheng Chen-to, Tun-huangpi-hua (Peking, 1959), Pls. 42-45, 55. 4I</page><page sequence="53">tional animals with riders seem to occur in the early sixth century, coinciding with the renewed popularity of these four creatures. Such combinations turn up on Northern Wei covers; Erh-chu Hsi's epitaph cover shows not only the tiger and dragon with riders but also the Red Bird of the South and the tortoise and the snake (Fig. 78).185 Besides the Teng-hsien tile, the only other tile decorated with a similar combination is the one excavated at Wu-ch'ang near Hankow in Hupei (Fig. 21). Here, an elegantly robed figure rides a dragon teased by an immortal.186 Trailing robes, swirling clouds, and flowers fill the surrounding space. The entire combination parallels the "Immortal Teasing a Tiger" at Hu-ch'iao (Fig. 18). In the Four Deities tomb near T'ung-kou, the ceiling teems with humans riding animals of all sorts.I87 Green Dragon of the East The dragon is clearly one of the most venerated creatures in Chinese mythology. In art, it is perhaps the commonest of all animal motifs. Last named among the ssu-ling, the dragon, a Yang symbol, eventually became the banner of the empire.188 To the Chinese this creature is benevolent with a multitude of symbolic connotations. As controller of rain, the dragon wields the power of life and death over the earth; it also has the power of transformation and the gift of becoming invisible.I89 Various categories of dragons, such as the Green Dragon, who presides over the Eastern quarter, serve other magical functions. Like the phoenix or Red Bird, the dragon deri- ves from several different animals which eventually are completely merged to create this fan- tastic creature. The Han dragon has parts from a tiger, the barbels of a catfish, horns of a deer, a scaly serpent body with crested body, legs of a lizard, and sometimes the talons of an eagle.19o Occasionally, the dragon is shown with wings. Within these general limits are many variations. The range in Han alone is visible from just three examples: on Wang Hui's coffin, on TLV mirrors, and on inlaid bronze bowls.19I Variety lessens in the Six Dynasties, and the form the dragon assumes in the Teng-hsien tomb becomes the standard version. The Green Dragon of the East fills his tile with a sinuous scaly body, briskly striding along churning up the surrounding air (Fig. 22). The head has a long tapered jaw and sharply pointed lips. Two slightly curled horns with a row of serrated bumps sit on top of the head. From the 185 Wang Tzu-yiin, Pl.9, nos. I-3. This type of directional animal was also translated into pottery. The Nelson Gallery, Kansas City, has a set of directional animals ridden by elegantly robed figures, Juliano, pp. 67-68. It is conceivable as Susan Bush suggests, that Loyang carvers misunderstood the iconography and placed riders on the back of the direc- tional animals as well, "Thunder Monsters," p. 24, n. 24.

What seems to be a wing with three spine-like projections sweeps up from the shoulder. Tufts of parallel lines, attached to legs and neck, intensify the sense of movement. Like the tiger's, the clawed feet curve with amazing flexibility and add the final touch to this supremely elegant beast. It has been suggested that the long tapered jaw and sharply pointed lips of the Teng-hsien dragon are relatively late characteristics which probably occurred at the end of the Six Dynasties or early Sui.I92 From available evidence, however, these features appear as early as Western Han.I93 The Teng-hsien dragon shares similarities of form and spirit with dragons found on Western Han inlaid bronzes as well as other examples. Of course, the best comparisons date from the early sixth century. One is found on the epitaph cover of Yuian Hui (Fig. 95). As mentioned previously, this dragon reveals a bony skeleton in the legs, large ears, flame shapes with incised semicircles attached to the neck, rump, and tail, and more realistically treated hind quarters. The dragon on the tile fromWu-ch'ang possesses many of the same physical character- istics as the Teng-hsien one, particularly the head and curved clawed feet. Like the dragon on Yuan Hui's epitaph cover, there is a flame-shaped form attached to the body near the tail rather than tufts of hair., 4 Liu Han in his article on the Teng-hsien tiles illustrates an earlier or at least simpler form from a tile found in tomb No. i from the Hsin-ning Brick and Tile Factory, Nan- king (Fig. 86:2).195 In Sammyoli No. i, the dragon is treated more grotesquely but still possesses marked similarities, particularly the curved clawed limbs. The Teng-hsien dragon shares the closest kinship with the one painted on the walls of the late Koguryo tomb, Shinpari No. I.I96 Another tile contains two confronted "descending" dragons with a leafy vine emerging from each mouth (Fig. 23). The front legs and floral vines touch in the center creating a roughly sym- metrical composition. The bodies curve back so the rest of the body and one hind leg stretch straight up above their heads while the other hind leg bends to the side; the tail crosses over the body toward the center. Sweeping wavy lines enclose both dragons. Dragons in this position usually occur in pairs on tomb pillars, stelae, Buddhist cave temples, and small shrines. On either side of a niche in the Ku-yang cave at Lung-men are very similar dragon forms (Fig. 114).I97 Except for the tail which cork-screws straight up, the positions are the same. Another pair can be found in Cave 3 at Kung-hsien.Is8 Such pairs are also found in Northern Wei epitaph covers, Prince Chen-ching's and Yuan Chao's, both dated 5 24.99 Neither approaches the extraordinary finesse of Teng-hsien's. The two dragons on Hsiao Hung's stele, ca. 526, from the Nanking area relate very closely to Teng-hsien; although equally as elegant, their forms appear more exaggerated, less clearly articulated and more mannered. Some of the exaggeration in the length of the undulating bodies may have helped fill the available space (Fig. 87).200 192 K'ao-ku, I959, no. 8, p.438. 193 Inlaid bronze bowl, Rostovtzeff, Pls.

Tokiwa and T. Sekino, 43</page><page sequence="55">Other Besides the directional animals, this group also includes other interesting creatures, most stem- ming from pre-Han and Han cosmology and mythology.20z Two tiles depict the fabulous aus- picious animal, the ch'i-lin or unicorn (Figs. 24, 27). Like the termfeg-hang, ch'i-lin has become the generic name for both the male ch'i and the female lin. One of the four supernatural creatures, ss-ling, it has been regarded as a happy portent whose rare appearances augured good govern- ment or the birth of a virtuous ruler.2o2 The first example on the Teng-hsien tile is identified by two characters and fits the traditional description: a body like a deer, bushy tail of an ox, single horn, and streamers of hair at the shoulders (Fig. 24). In contrast to the dragon and tiger, the legs and hooves of the ch'i-lin are rendered with greater sensitivity to anatomical structure. This spirit- ed creature moves swiftly through space, filling the center of its tile. The legs and single horn overlap the floral border. A comparable ch'i-lin flanks the Black Warrior of the North on Yiian Hui's epitaph cover (Fig. 95). In tombs decorated with the four directional animals, the ch'i-lin is often added to the group. The walls of the North Korean and Manchurian tombs provide ample examples of the unicorn. In the main chamber of Buyo-zuka there are at least two which appear to be running with wisps of hair flying back (Fig. 26).203 The second example, mentioned in Chapter I, bears no identification, but the animal has the basic attributes of a unicorn (Fig. 27). The major differences are the body and head which seem more horselike. In Han tombs, particularly stone reliefs from Shensi, horses are transformed into unicorns by adding a single horn to the center of the forehead.204 Sowerby's description of a unicorn refers to a horse-like body and not a deer-like one.205 Perhaps, as suggested earlier, the two tiles represent the complementary male and female forms. Another tile with a honeysuckle border shows two curious looking confronted creatures separated by a small bouquet of flowers (Fig. 28). Both beings are shown in three-quarter view and have bird bodies but different heads. The bodies assume the same basic form as the feng- Shina Bunka Shiseki (Tokyo, 9359-41), Vol. X, p. 77. The dragon on the tile from Wu-ch'ang in Hupei is very similar to the pair on the Liang Dynasty tomb pillar, cf. Wen Wu, I956, no. 7, p. I7, The body displays the same elongation and exaggeration. 201 Fabulous animals constitute a major category in Han art and literature. The Shan Hai Ching, a Han handbook of cosmic geography and ethnology, is a veritable catalogue of bizarre places and their inhabitants. Han imperial parks as described by Edward Shafer not only became a microcosm of all that was under Heaven but also a menagerie suggestive of an earthly paradise - a reflection perhaps of the paradises of the gods. Such parks apparently did not go unrivalled by provincial competitors such as the great park in the State of Ch'u mentioned by Ssu-ma Hsiang-ju; Schafer, "Hunting Parks," pp. 334-6. 202 During the Han, various species of rhinoceroses were given the Han emperor as tribute, and these animals may well be the source of unicorn mythology. Schafer, "Hunting Parks," p. 330. For a summary of the rich lore surrounding ch'i-lin in Chinese mythology see Anneliese Bulling," Notes on Two Unicorns," Oriental Art, n.s.

LXI, no. i. 205 Sowerby, p. 5 z. Unicorns with horse-like bodies can be found in Han. A horse easily can be transformed by adding a horn to its forehead, see Lubor Hajek, Chinesiscbe Kunst in TschechoslowakischenMuseen (Prague, I954), no. 66. Additional exam- ples of unicorns have turned up in other Six Dynasties tombs. A pottery model with hooved legs and a human face was found in the tomb of a high ranking Northern Wei courtier of Southern descent, Ssu-ma Chin-lung and his wife, who died in 484 and 474 respectively, in Shansi near Ta-t'ung, Wen Wu, 72, no,3, 3,o. Fig. 4:4. In Kansu at Wu-wei, a splendid wooden unicorn was uncovered in 1959. This one also has hooves, a long tail and horn, see The Chinese Exhi- bition (Toronto: Royal Ontario Museum, 1974), p. i2o, no. 225. 44</page><page sequence="56">huang previously discussed. One has an elf-like head with long pointed ears and a funny hat; a V-necked garment covers the shoulders and breast. The other has a profiled rodent-like head which appears to be craning upward. There is a very effective transition from the bird's body to the rodent's neck. Two pairs of characters on either side of the creatures read ch'ien-ch'iu and wan-sui, "one thousand autumns" and "ten thousand years," common felicitous expressions of good luck and long life; in the context of the tomb, they imply hope for immortality. During the Han, one of the possible ways to achieve physical immortality besides becoming a feathered immortal was to metamorphose the human body into a bird.206 In Pre-Han and Han mythology, a human-headed bird was considered an auspicious bird or wind spirit, and a deer- headed bird, a wind god.207 These iconographic oddities occur in the C T and the Shan Hai Ching.2z8 Both literature and art in Han are fraught with such creatures making their precise identification difficult if not impossible. The human-headed bird depicted on the pediment of a stone relief from Wu Liang-Tzu illustrates the typical Han form. Body and head are shown in profile.209 On the head sits a wedge- shaped cap. In this example, the creature extends an arm draped with a wide sleeve which further anthropomorphizes it. Nagahiro, in describing Han brick tombs with stone slabs for lintels, also mentions the presence of these human-headed birds in relief on the stone pillars.2o In the Six Dynasties, these human and rodent headed birds appear frequently on Northern. Wei epitaph covers and are particularly prolific in the Manchurian and Korean wall paintings. This same pair exists on tiles in the Nanking tomb near Chen-chiang (Fig. 104) and on the Nor- 206 YU Ying-shih, "Life and Immortality," p. i o. This idea of metamorphosis into a bird may ultimately find its source in earlier Pre-Han shamanistic practices in southwest China or Mongolia. Ping-leung Chan, in his Ph. D. dissertation "Ch'u Tz'u and Shamanism in Ancient China" (unpublished dissertation for Ohio State University, I972), discusses bird sym- bolism in connection with shamanism in several cultures. Altaic and Mongol shamans dressed in birdlike costumes, wings, feathered headdresses, and boots imitating bird legs. "The main function of the ornithomorphosis is to facilitate the shaman in his spiritual flight to heaven," p. 14; see also Mircea Eliade, Le Chamanisme et les techniques archeiques de l'extase (Paris, I95I), pp. I49-51 and Uno Holmberb, The Shaman Costume and its Significance (Annales Universitatis Fennicae Aboensis, Series B, I:2, I922). Bird-men or humans dressed as birds appear on some Eastern Chou pictorial bronze vessels from the fifth century B.C. A fragment of a square hu excavated from Liu-li-ko, Honan and a complete hu in the Lidow Collection in Los Angeles show bird-men alternating with birds. Both were published by Charles D. Weber, Chinese Pictorial Bronzes of the Late Chou Period, Artibus Asiae (Ascona, 1968), Fig.45, a, b and Fig. 75, i. In keeping with the idea of immortality and metamorphosis, Sun Tso-yiin discusses the identification of one of these human-headed bird-bodied creatures which was found painted on the wall of a recently excavated Western Han tomb near Loyang. He identifies this bird, which has a long cap, long ears, and what appears to be a beard, as the immortal or hsien, Wang Tzu-ch'iao.

It is also possible that such human headed bird-bodied creatures entered Pre-Han Chinese mythology from the West, e.g. "harpies." 209 Chavannes, Mission archeologigue, Vol.I (Plates), no. i Io, bottom. 2I0 Nagahiro, The Representational Art of the Han Dynasty, p. 4. 45</page><page sequence="57">thern Wei epitaph covers of Princes Yiian Chao and Chen Chiang, both dated 5 24.211 In form and execution, both are closely related to the Teng-hsien pair. More elaborate versions also occur on the Wei grandee Kou Ching's epitaph cover dated 528 (Fig. I 6). The four directional animals are not present on these three covers. Thunder monsters or pairs of dragons alternate with bird- bodied creatures.212 Apparently, dragons or pi-hsieh, as well as these creatures were considered acceptable substitutes for the protective and auspicious directional animals. The Manchurian tombs near T'ung-kou, particularly the ceiling of Shishinzuka, abound in representations of these animals (Fig. II 7).23 In this tomb, riding a large bird, is an elf-like figure with pointed ears and the same hat worn by the human-headed bird on the Teng-hsien tiles (Fig. Ii8).2I4 The last tile in this group contains a pair of confronted seated lions, each with one front paw raised over an unidentifiable Chinese character (Fig. 30). A flower hangs above the center, and a bouquet above each lion's head. The lion is not indigenous to China and seems never to have occurred there in a wild state even in prehistoric times. Yet this fearsome beast, sent from the West as a gift to the Emperor, is frequently represented in art though more like a pug dog than a real lion and sometimes with a touch of hum.or.21I The pair in Teng-hsien really possess only one identifying lion feature, a mane. Tail, legs, pSws, and claws are interchangeable with several other mythical creatures, feng-huang, ch'i-lin, and dragon. Large stone lions in the round, often winged, were used in pairs as above ground tomb guardians, such as the ones near Kao Yi's grave in Szechwan, those found at Lu Shan, and at the Wu family tombs.216 The felines on Han pottery hu's are often ambiguous. Most are tigers, with an occasional leopard; but many do not ha-ve definitive forms. One which can be specifically identified by its mane occurs on the inlaid bronze bowl in the Hosokawa Collection.217 Han lions apparently evolved before the full impact of Buddhism. Furthermore, Chinese lions are very different from those found in Indian Buddhist art. Later representations of lions take on more Indian characteristcs such as a mane of short spiral curls. Many paired lions are found in Six Dynasties Buddhist art, particularly on stelae. They com- monly occur on the throne beneath the Buddha figure, with paws usually raised toward a lotus- shaped censer. At Teng-hsien, the lions are very similar to a pair engraved on the pedestal of a Maitreya dated 525 in the University of Pennsylvania Museum (Fig. 3 I).2I8 The rubbing of this tile is extremely poor, but there are suggestions of a scalloped pattern on the tail and body, like 211 The pair in this Chen-chiang tomb are somewhat unusual. The human-headed bird has a high hat and is shown from a three-quarter view. Similar human heads with high hats are used for the snakes which drape over the lion monster in this tomb.

I7. 215 Edward Schafer mentions the lion as one among the many animals in Han imperial parks which were new to the Chinese, and had apparently been brought to their attention from Chang Ch'ien's explorations in the far west and the activities of the Han armies there. These animals vividly described in the Han Shu include: "dragon-patterned, fish-eyed, and blood- sweating horses filled the Yellow Gate; hordes of immense elephants, lions, fierce dogs, and great birds were fed in the outer preserves, "Hunting Parks," p. 329. 2I6 Cheng Te-k'un, Archeological Studies in Szechwan, Kao Yi and Lu Shan in Szechwan, P1. 8 I, no. 7 and Sickman and Soper, p. 6i, no. 13. 217 Rostovtzeff, Loo-Hosokawa bowl, PI.IX. 218 Wang Tzu-yiin, P1. .. 46</page><page sequence="58">the incised scroll work on those from the Maitreya's pedestal. The two lions on the Teng-hsien tile may or may not be Buddhist in inspiration. The absence of the censer leaves their conno- tation somewhat ambiguous. To judge from Teng-hsien, the Eastern Chin tomb at Chen-chiang dated 398, the Hu-ch'iao grave at Tan-yang, ca. 49 5, the Northern Wei epitaph covers, and the late Koguryo wall paintings, the four directional animals were clearly in vogue. Until the discovery of the Tan-yang tombs near Nanking, the Northern Wei epitaph cover of Yuan Hui dated I 8 and the late Koguryo tombs cited several times in the preceding discussion manifested the closest stylistic relationship to Teng-hsien; the entire style shares the same spirit. Not only are the animal forms comparable in most details, the use of swirling flowers and sweeping clouds lends to the forms the energy and intensity which are so characteristic of Teng-hsien. However, the surviving mural from Hu-ch'iao, "Immortal Teasing a Tiger" (Fig. i8), offers equally strong stylistic parallels of an earlier date from the South. Tun-huang Caves 249 and 285 (Figs. 97, 98) from the group ascribed to the early sixth cen- tury also provide excellent material for comparison of subject and style.219 The ceilings of both caves are covered with a bevy of celestial beings moving through the heavens at top speed. A dazzling array of floral motifs is strewn across the sky, almost like a Persian carpet. Since these forms are painted all across such a large unbroken surface, the movement appears frantic. 2) Human figures leading or riding animals This group contains six tiles, all depicting men leading or riding animals. Three show figures either riding horses or leading one or two (Figs. 32, 34, 35). Two have single figures guiding bullock carts while a third has a figure walking alongside a bullock (Figs. 37-40). All the figures wear the same V-necked tunic with wide sleeves, belted at the waist, and loose fitting flared trou- sers tied at the knee.2zo There also appears to be an undergarment visible at the neck. Some of the outfits show minor variations, particularly in sleeves or trousers, which are sometimes rolled up or tied at the ankle (Figs. 32, 34). One warrior riding an elaborately caparisoned horse and using stirrups wears the same uniform, but his tunic is covered by short leather armour, liang-tang k'ai, fastened at the shoulders by two straps or braces.22z Both uniform and armour are frequently seen on Northern Wei pottery figures as well as in this tomb, in mortuary, and in Buddhist art. Trousers and tight fitting jackets were associated with nomadic tribes of Central Asia. When the Chinese took to horseback in the late Chou Dynasty, nomadic styles of dress were officially adopted by King Wu-ling (325-299 B.C.) of the far northern State of Chao as more appropriate for horseback and cavalry than the flowing robes and long dangling sleeves of standard cere- 219 Akiyama and Matsubara, Arts of China, Vol.11, Pls. r 8, 22-24; Cheng Chen-to, Cave 285, nos. 55-57 and Cave 249, nos. 44-46. 220 No significant changes occurred in dress from the Han Dynasty to the Six Dynasties except for the k'u-tieh, k'u, trousers, and tieh, a short tunic with loose sleeves. However, as defined by Harada, this term doesn't seem to include the practice of binding the trousers below the knee. Harada, Chinese Dress, p. 29. 221 Harada, Chinese Dress, p. 38. The liang-tang-k'ai became popular in the Northern and Southern Dynasties, replacing the earlier tung-hsiu-k'ai or quarter sleeve armour popular in the Han through Eastern Chin. Liang-tang-k'ai was well suited to cavalry, Yang Hung, "Ancient Chinese Armour," K'ao-ku hsiieh-pao, 1976, no. 2, pp. 62-65. 47</page><page sequence="59">monial dress.222 With the exception of servants and the military, it became customary for the Chinese to wear trousers hidden under their long robes. However, up until the sixth century, this nomadic costume did not include trousers bound below the knee. This fashion turns up during the Six Dynasties in both the North and South. It is prevalent in Northern Wei art from the sixth century onward. Trousers bound below the knee are the distinctive and problematical aspect of this uniform. Harada believes this fashion was from the Northern Tartar invaders and is a distinguishing characteristic of the men of the Northern Court as loose robes with long sleeves are of both men and women of the Southern Court. Recent excavations of pottery figures from the Ta-t'ung area in Shansi, however, cast some doubt on the Northern origins of this fashion. These pottery figures from the grave of Ssu-ma Chin-lung and his wife, who died in 484 and 474 respectively, wear distinctive garb which apparently reflects attire worn by the Hsien-pei ruling class and military before the clothing reforms of Hsiao Wen-ti in 493 (Figs. i 19, IZ).223 The preponderance of figures in this tomb are military and wear straight calf-length garments with narrow sleeves and straight trousers. None of them have trousers bound at the knee or even belt- ed tunics. However, tied trousers were certainly fashionable in the North around the first quar- ter of the sixth century. Another group of ming-ch'i excavated from the tomb of Yuan Shao and his father in the Loyang area (dated by epitaph stones to 520 and 528) also contains military figures dressed in short belted tunics and trousers bound at the knee (Fig. i2I).224 Since the tomb is located near Loyang, the final capital of the Northern Wei empire, perhaps this fashion was introduced as part of Hsiao Wen-ti's clothing reform and sinicization program. In his discussion of the Teng-hsien tiles, Liu Han has not been able to establish the origins of the fashion.225 He quotes several literary sources which mention the adoption of trousers for carriage drivers and the military in the Southern Dynasties.226 This type of dress facilitated mo- vement and made it easier to work. Apparently, the nobles of the South were disdainful of such clothing. The traditional Chinese robe remained a symbol of the continuation of Han aristocra- tic traditions in the South and was officially adopted by the later Northern Wei rulers as a deliberate symbol of sinicization. On the basis of the available evidence, the origin of tying the trousers below the knee cannot yet definitely be established, but a Southern origin is suggested. It is interesting to note that this fashion occurs in at least one Han relief from Szechwan showing archers.227 Another example from Szechwan depicts laborers husking rice. Both show trousers tied below the knee, undoubt- edly a practical action. The date of this tile is not secure and may be late Han or early third century.228 Trousers tied below the knee but wrapped at the calf rather than loosely flared turn up in the late fifth century imperial tomb at Hu-ch'iao, Tan-yang County.229 222 Edouard Chavannes, LesMemoires historiques de Se-ma Ts'ien (Paris: I895-I905), V. pp.42, 69-84. 223 Wen Wu, I972, no. 3, p. 32-3 3, Figs. 15-20, 23-4. The identification of the clothing on these pottery figures in Ssu-ma Chin-lung's tomb as Hsien-pei is suggested by the comparison of the costumes with the donor figures visible in Yiin- kang, Cave 17, the dated embroidery discovered in Tun-huang (Wen Wu, I972, no. 2, p. 5 8-9), and a Northern Wei stele dated 472 from Shansi, Ars Orientalis, IX (I973), Pls. 44 and 45.

Three are handsomely caparisoned with bells, plumes, and leather straps (Figs. 32, 34, 35). The neck has a covering, probably leather, which is attached by straps across the breast. This covering creates an elegantly scalloped pattern down the curve of the neck and is characteristic of sixth century Northern Wei tomb horses. In contrast to the angularity of the human figures, the body of the horse has smooth graceful curves like the sweep of the neck. Disciplined movement and tense energy are transmitted through the thin and sharply articulat- ed legs. A similar proud and confident donor's steed stands on the pedestal of the Maitreya dated 525 (Fig.96).23o This type of horse also translates impressively into pottery. A recently excavated pottery horse from the Loyang tomb of Yuian Shao and his father captures the form and spirit as well as the ornamental details found on the Teng-hsien tiles (Fig. I22).231 The entire body of the fourth horse is covered by mail armour with some ornamental trappings (Fig. 32). The period of disunity between South and North China saw the rapid development of defen- sive armour for both men and horses. Armoured horses greatly increased the power and effec- tiveness of the cavalry. Thus far, the earliest representations of such fully armoured horses occur in the wall paintings from the tomb of a Chinese high official, Tung Shou, in Anak, North Korea, dated to 3 5 7 A. D.; eight fully armoured horses serve as escorts to the elaborate procession (Fig. I24).232 Early sixth century paintings both in Tun-huang Cave 28 (Fig. 97) (dated 5 38-39) and Mai-chi-shan, Cave 127, include heavily armoured horses.233 The Tun-huang example is very close to Teng-hsien in both the position of the horse and the depiction of the mail armour which clearly shows overlapping scales and a wide border along the edge. The armoured horse depicted on a section of the wall in the Southern Dynasties brick tomb at Hu-ch'iao near Nanking shares many similarities with Teng-hsien's, notably the body, the armour, and the plumes (Fig. 3 3).234 It lacks the scalloped pattern along the neck as well as other minor details. Unfortunately, this horse and rider were badly damaged limiting their comparative value. Northern art reflects the dominant position occupied by the military. Both secular and Bud- dhist stone reliefs often include spirited, handsomely dressed horses and soldiers. Northern Wei generals treasured their horses; caparisoned horses without a rider became symbols for their fallen masters. For example, a stone relief from Loyang, probably from a coffin, shows such a riderless horse being led by a servant on the left and protected by an umbrella and fan held by two servants on the right.235 Some fifteen tiles and fifty pottery figures found in Teng-hsien have military subjects. The significant presence of the military not only reflects the tenor of the period but also suggests that this tomb belonged to a military grandee whose horse and empty palanquin are being led in the procession.236 230 Harada, Chinese Dress, P1.

Or, if horses are riderless, they may imply that the deceased had several personal steeds. 49</page><page sequence="61">During the Six Dynasties period, the ox-drawn cart became a common vehicle of peace-time transportation for scholars, nobility, officers, and ladies. This change from horse drawn char- iots began toward the end of the Han Dynasty and probably resulted from the virtual annihi- lation of well-bred horses throughout China as a result of the incessant warfare beginning with the collapse of Han.237 Ox-drawn carts gained currency through the North and South. Official corteges with ox carts must have looked like the one painted on the wall of Tung Shou's tomb at Anak, Korea.238 Foot soldiers, musicians, cavalry, and standard bearers surround the ox cart carrying the Chinese minister in solemn procession (Fig. I24). Two tiles in Teng-hsien show this vehicle;he the ox cart has a curved roof and curtain hanging across the back (Figs. 3 7-39). From the roof, an additional canopy extends out over the ox and is supported by two slender poles attached to the harness. An attendant walks alongside holding the reins and prodding the ox with a stick. This type of cart with additional canopy is often depicted in early sixth century art. Another with a flat roof and canopy is found on the lady's side of the pedestal of the Maitreya from Northern Wei dated to the sixth year of Cheng-Kuang, 525 (Fig. 3 I). In Tun-huang, Cave 257, wall paint- ings ascribed to the mid-fifth century depict a cart with a canopy structure, pulled by a horse.39 During the Six Dynasties, carts and oxen for peacetime use are added to the repertory of pottery ming-ch'i.z4o These pottery models usually show a simple cart with a curved roof pulled by a harnessed ox. While none have elaborate canopies or any indication of a damaged one, some have roofs which extend out modestly over the rear of the ox. The recently excavated tomb of Yuan Shao at Loyang dated to the 520zo's contains an excellent and typical model of an ox cart with all parts intact.241 Single unhitched oxen are also powerfully represented. One tile in Teng-hsien depicts a figure alongside of a large striding ox (Fig. 40). The essential aspects of this animal's physical nature are translated into a vital and harmonious profile form. Unlike the extreme angularity and stylization of the human figures, the solid body of the ox is sensitively and persuasively modelled. This mass and strength are heightened by the linear details; three parallel lines at the shoulder create not only the forward thrust of the shoulders and the rippled hide but also compressed tension between the bent leg and head. Thin, sharply articulated limbs further emphasize the bulk of the body. Many similar models of ox and carts have been excavated from Northern Ch'i tombs of Northeast China and continued to be made in the T'ang.24z Besides pottery models, ox- en and carts can also be found in stone reliefs depicting both secular and Buddhist themes. Figure 41 is a rubbing of a damaged tile showing at least four servants carrying an empty palanquin followed by one figure holding a chang, or circular wooden fan, reserved for proces- sions. Four simple spiral forms decorate the back of the fan. A similar one is visible in the small procession on the University of Pennsylvania Museum base, dated 525 (Fig. 31). The empty palanquin may symbolize the deceased or serve as a gesture of worship. Unlike the ox-carts, 237 Soper, Textual Evidence, p. 54. 238 K'ao-ku, 959, no. I, pp. 27-35. 239 Harada Yoshito and K.

On the screen, the emperor sits in an open high-backed chair sheltered by a canopy and umbrella. 3) Human figures alone or in groups One of the most familiar aspects of Han tomb art is the official procession of chariots, musi- cians, and retainers. Marching soldiers and musicians depicted in the Teng-hsien tiles represent a direct continuation of this theme. While three tiles show pairs of swooping apsarases, the remaining nine depict groups of four to six figures briskly moving in a procession. Six of the nine have servants or military figures dressed in the standard tunic and tied trousers. Two groups play musical instruments, flutes, mouth organ, and long curved horns with feathers or flapping pennants attached to the ends (Figs. 43, 44). An unusual Northern Wei clay figure, excavated from a tomb near Hsi-an, shows a mounted figure blowing the same kind of long curved horn. Kosei Ando identified this horn as a feature of the northern army.245 It also turns up on the walls of the Buyo-zuka tomb played by a strange flying figure. One tile shows four marching musicians, two blowing long horns and two banging drums (Fig. 43). They all wear unusual large brimmed hats identified by Harada as chien-hbua-kuan.246 One of the pottery figures in the tomb, shown holding a drum, also wears the same hat (Fig. 129). Another two groups carry ceremonial equipment. One tile has two figures carrying po- shan-lu or incense burners with half open lids, while two others carry some kind of banner (Fig. 47).247 This rectangular shaped banner with wavy edges and streamers is supported by a handle resting on a square platform; such banners were apparently used at Buddhist cere- monies.248 The other tile also shows four figures, two holding identifiable objects; one has a folded mat, used at feasts, and the o fther, a feathery fan, a standard feature of northern and southern processions (Fig. 48).249 243 Southern Dynasties records mention that palanquins were used by important clan members; Liu Han, K'ao-ku, 1959, no. 5, p.258. 244 Admonitions scroll, Harada, Chinese Dress, P1.

I2. 245 Akiyama, Arts of China, Vol.1, p. 236, nos. 314-5. 246 Harada, Chinese Dress, p. 38. 247 Although the incense burners are identified as po-shan-lu, they are probably not the traditional ones decorated with the mythological and cosmological symbols. It is possible, however, that traditional po-shan-lu decor was maintained even in a Buddhist context. Dr. Soper translated several poems from the South which describe po-shan-lu. At the present time, except for a few miniatures, there are no extant full size examples from the fifth and sixth centuries, even though the technical level of bronze casting displayed by the best Six Dynasties mirrors and miniatures was certainly up to the task. Soper, "Textual Evidence," p. 40. 248 Ibid. 249 This type of feathered fan is also carried in the Empress's procession from the Pin-yang Cave of Lung-men, Sickman and Soper, The Art and Architecture of China, P1. 6i, p. Ioo. It was also carried by the imperial retainers in Hu-ch'iao tomb, Tan-yang, Wen Wu, 1977, no.i, p.67, Fig. 5:2, p. 73, n. 3. 5I</page><page sequence="63">The last two tiles depict foot soldiers. One has four soldiers alternately carrying ring- handled swords with shields and bows and arrows (Fig. 45); on another, four lictors walk each with one arm extended in front and the other hand grasping a tapered staff (Fig. 46). Liu Han describes this staff as an imperial insignia carried before the emperor, which would make these four soldiers imperial body guards.2so Here, however, they most likely merely indicate the high rank of the deceased. Most of the human figures wear the standard uniform, a short tunic and tied trousers. Two tiles with floral borders show figures wearing a modified version of this uniform, which has full loose trousers, long wide sleeves on the tunic and no lapels (Fig. 5I, 52).251 Sharply curved and pointed shoes extend out from beneath the trousers. One of the two tiles contains six figures within a floral border. To the left, four stand in a row; one plays a mouth organ, another an hourglass-shaped hand drum, and one grasps a long fly-whisk-like object (Fig. 5 I).252 To the right, two young girls, hair tied into double knot coiffures, are dancing. The other tile contains four figures (Fig. 52). Three of the figures seem to be following a strangely dressed bearded old man. He wears a pointed cap, long robe, and holds a feather in one hand and a feathered bow in the other hand.253 The original archeological report of Teng-hsien iden- tifies him as a dancing shaman. He certainly does not seem to be the traditional Chinese exor- cist clad in a bearskin and holding a shield. More likely, he fulfills the role of an exorcist or pu- rifier of graves, for which he needs his magical paraphernalia. According to tradition, a shaman or sorcerer leads the funeral procession to the burial ground and descends into the grave touching all four sides with spear or lance to exorcise any demons or evil spirits who could harm the deceased. At the same time, he pays homage to the four celestial directions. When exorcising demons, the shaman is usually accompanied by figures, as he seems to be on this Teng-hsien tile. The only example comparable to this unusual figure is the pottery one in the Nelson Gallery in Kansas City. Exquisitely modelled, the figure wears the same pointed hat and shoes. The positions of the body and hands are also alike. Both hands originally seemed to be holding something, perhaps the same magical instruments pictured on the tile.254 In Teng-hsien, two major styles of clothing are represented, the tunic and trousers and the traditional flowing Chinese robes. The more traditional styles occur in the "story-telling" scenes of the next category and on one tile in this group (Fig. 49). This one tile depicts four fe- males wearing belted tunics with long flowing sleeves over long shirts. Actually, the tunic con- sists of several garments, an undergarment with long sleeves and an overgarment with half sleeves. These are then covered by a sleeveless jacket and belted. Two women on the left side have their hair tied up in a high chignon or kao-chi.2ss Cloud toed shoes curve upward in 250 The sex of many of the figures on the tiles is often impossible to determine. The ambiguous term "figures" will be used when a more specific identification cannot be made. 251 Liu Han, K'ao-ku, I959, no. 5 p. 25 8. An attendant figure holding a lance has similar garments; from the rubbing in the archeological report, it is not clear whether this garment is composed of a tunic and loose trousers or a long flowing robe, Wen W'u, 1974, no. 2, p. 5x, Fig. 17. 252 The same fly whisk-like object is also carried by apsarases in Lung-men, Yu Hsi-ning, ed., Pei-Wei, p. 20, no.7. 253 Fontein and Wu identify this "old man" as holding a fly whisk in his left hand, which during the Six Dynasties was the attribute of the master of ch'ing-t'an or pure discussions, or just spiritual authority, Unearthing, p. 146, no. 70. 254 Ibid., pp. I46-7, no.70. 255 Harada, Chinese Dress, p. 38. 52</page><page sequence="64">front of the skirts. The second figure from the left carries a round wooden ceremonial fan and the fourth one, a folded mat used at feasts. The entire group moves with a grace and ease transmitted through the flowing forms of the robes and scarves. Similar costumes and coiffures can be found in the imperial processions from the central Pin-yang Cave, Lung-men (Fig. Io2) and from Cave I, Kung-hsien, on the base of the Maitreya dated 525 (Fig. 96), and in the Western Wei Cave 285 in Tun-huang (Fig. 97).256 The only figures not found in groups are the large single male guardians standing on the back or north wall of the tomb (Fig. 54) and painted on either side of the entrance archway (Fig. 56).257 As described in Chapter I, these figures of bearded men occupy the tall vertical spaces at the bottoms of the buttresses on all three walls. Each figure is composed of two large panels, one above the other, with narrower filler tiles in between. The head is on the upper tile, the torso on the filler tiles, and the lower panel completes the figure. Since they are placed at the bottom of each buttress, each one appears to be standing on the floor. From the available photographs and reconstructions of one of the figures, it is difficult to determine accurately what the clothing looks like. Each figure appears to be wearing a short tunic, which may be covered with a leather breastplate, a high stand-up collar, loose trousers, and boat-toed shoes. The oval head with wispy beard and moustache rests on an elegantly long neck; the hat is probably the p'ing-shan-ts'e which was worn by military officers or courtiers at court instead of the wu-kuan.2s8 A sword is held vertically at the axis of the body emphasizing its symmetry.259 Two very similar figures are painted on either side of the arched doorway (Fig. 56). Like most of the human figures in Teng-hsien, they are drawn in a three-quarter view. Here the details of clothing are clearer, the tunic being covered by short leather armour attached by straps across the shoulders. These figures also hold a long staff or sword.260 Given the position of these figures on either side of the doorway and on the north wall, they most likely serve a protective function. Both the painted guardians and the tile ones are similar to the mounted soldier in Fig. 35. Except for the tied trousers and boots, the details of dress are the same, suggesting that they all have the same official rank. The last three tiles in this category show pairs of flying apsarases (Figs. 5 7, 5 8, 59). Most of the apsarases are in a basically vertical position with legs scissored and drapery flying freely behind. The direction of the flapping drapery follows the direction of their flight, either hori- 256 Liu Han, p. 2 5 7, Fig. 8, no. 4 and Harada, Chinese Dress, P1. XL; Alexander C. Soper, "Imperial Cave Chapels of the North- ern Dynasties: Donors, Beneficiaries, Dates," Artibus Asiae, XXVII (I967), pp.246-257. 257 According to the original Teng-hsien report, there were other small single figures which were used as filler tiles between or as frames around the larger ones. The report illustrated only two (Fig. i 3). One is a standing warrior holding a shield and the other, an elf-like creature, probably an immortal, holding a flowering vine. But in the general photographs of some of the tomb walls (Fig. 4), many other such figures are barely discernible; they may or may not be the same as the above two. It appears from these photographs that the warriors are used as filler tiles next to the single large guardian figures. Teng-hsien, p. I, Figs. i, 2, p. 32, Fig. 41. 258 Harada, Chinese Dress, pp. 28, 38. 259 A similar figure modeled in high relief can be found on a tile in a Sui Dynasty tomb excavated in the southern outskirts of Ch'ang-sha. Except for the hat which is heart shaped, the position of the figure and the details of clothing are almost identical. The program of decoration in this tomb also includes the directional animals and floral medallions continuing the tradition of Teng-hsien. K'ao-ku, I965, no. 5, pp. 226-229, P1. 8. 260 Harada identifies this staff as a long sword worn only by the upper classes in China and suggests that the artist may have made an error when reconstructing the painting from the original. Chinese Dress, p. 83. However, given the unstable conditions of this period and the dominant role of the military in society, such a distinction may not have had validity. 53</page><page sequence="65">zontally or diagonally. One pair, bearing offerings, float toward the incense burner in the center of the tile (Fig. 57). Enclosed in a floral border, another pair fly diagonally toward a vase of lotus flowers (Fig. 58). The third and most extraordinary pair swoop downward from the left and are caught in mid-air encircled by a flurry of trailing scarves (Fig. 59). In an upright position, the left one plays a drum and moves toward the right; the body of the right one curves back with legs outstretched and arm raised toward the left one. The figures are exquisitely counterposed, one balanced against the movement of the other. Two Chinese characters at the bottom of the tile identify the figures as t'ien-jen. The execution of these flying figures exem- plifies the intense and energetic linear terms of the Teng-hsien style. The most splendid com- parable celestials soar over the tiger's back on the west wall of the southern imperial tomb at Hu-ch'iao, Tan-yang County, dated ca. 495 (Figs. 64, 65). Their thin curved bodies followed by trailing scarves glide with fluid grace and clearly match Teng-hsien in all aspects. Another very similar apsaras form is tucked into the left hand corner on the back of an undated, but early Buddhist stele excavated at Wan-fo-ssu, Szechwan (Fig. 67).261 All of these examples have long thin bodies covered by layers of loose flapping drapery, hallmarks of the Chinese form of these Buddhist celestials. This Chinese version, already fully developed in the late fifth century in the tomb at Tan-yang, makes its appearance in the North about the second decade of the sixth century.262 Ample comparative examples can be found in the rock cut temples of Lung-men, parti- cularly the apsarases in the Ku-yang (Figs. 62, 63), Pin-yang and Lotus Flower Caves (Figs. 60, 6I).263 However, allowing for the differences between media, the apsarases over the niche of the main Buddha in the Lotus Cave begin to approach the sophisticated level of execution found in Teng-shien; the flapping scarves respond with the same fluid and graceful movement. 4) Story-telling scenes Five tiles illustrate traditional Chinese themes of filial piety and Taoist legend (Figs. 68, 69, 71, 73, 74). Four of these are notable for the extensive use of landscape elements to create a setting for each story.264 Given the meagre remains of secular art from this period, these elaborate compositions provide a valuable new source of reliable information about the Six Dynasties pictorial styles. 261 Alexander C. Soper, "South Chinese Influence on the Buddhist Art of the Six Dynasties Period," Bulletin of theMuseum of Far Eastern Antiquities, 32 (I960), P1. i8. 262 Before the adoption of the Chinese version of the apsaras, Northern Buddhist caves displayed more Indian forms, chubby female figures with naked torsoes. For a brief discussion of this difference and comparative drawing see Lin Shu-chung, p. 66, Fig. 14 and Bush, "Floral Motifs," p. 50. 263 Yu Hsi-ning, ed., Pei-Wei, p. 20, no. 7; pp. 32-36, nos. I7-I9. 264 During the Six Dynasties, the growing use of landscape elements reflects the beginning of a new attitude toward nature which affected both art and literature. Along with more complex landscape composition came the first nature poets, writing verse depicting landscape. J.D.Frodsham, "Origin of Nature Poetry," AsiaMajor, n. s. Vol. 8, I960-I, 68-I04, discusses some of the stimuli created during this period, ultimately leading to the emergence of landscape poetry and, of course, painting. 54</page><page sequence="66">Two tiles (Figs. 68, 69) depict the Taoist legend of Wang Tzu-ch'iao, who played the mouth organ so well that he enticed a phoenix down from heaven to dance for him.z65 In this instance, Fou Ch'iu-kung, an immortal, appears along with the phoenix.z66 Only one tile, Fig. 69 has characters identifying the two figures. Both tiles have the same basic composition, with Wang Tzu-ch'iao seated on the left near a tree, Fou Ch'iu-kung standing on the right holding a fly whisk, and a dancing phoenix at the center. The major differences occur in the use and number of landscape elements. In Fig. 69 the entire scene occupies the shallow foreground just above the lower edge of the tile. Two trees with straight trunks and candelabra-like branches enclose the scene like bookends. Some depth is suggested by overlapping, particularly on the left where Wang Tzu- ch'iao is shown seated on a cluster of rocks in front of a tree. Below the phoenix, low undulat- ing curves form overlapping hills and emphasize the ground plane; a clump of grass is tucked behind one of these low hills. In Fig. 68, there are fewer landscape elements but more evocative spatial effects. On the right, Fou Ch'iu-kung and the dancing phoenix stand in the foreground above the lower edge of the tile. On the left, Wang Tzu-ch'iao, perched on a pile of rocks, appears pushed further back in space toward the middle ground. This effect is created by layer- ing flat two-dimensional rock forms one above the other with a tree placed behind the rocks and the figure. A single line which thickens and thins undulates across the top of the tile at the right and creates a striking spatial effect of a distant, partly mist-shrouded mountain range. A similar device evoking a sese of penetration into the far distance is used in various stone reliefs from the first half of the sixth century, such as the Nelson Gallery sarcophagus, and the Eastern Wei stele dated 543.267 However, on this tile, the spatial effects are isolated into three corners of the composition and not integrated so their visual impact is limited. The rocks and trees depicted in these two tiles are common in landscape composition from the early sixth century. A very similar tree emerges from behind flat layered rocks in Cave 28 5 at Tun-huang (Fig. 70: 2).268 Two-dimensional layered rocks of various shapes are frequently used in stone reliefs and Tun-huang paintings. Figures 7I and 73 have far more complex compositions, one more successful than the other. As described in Chapter I, Figures 71 and 72 illustrate the story of that paragon of filial piety, Kuo Chii, who decided to bury his infant son in order to feed his aged mother.269 This tile depicts the dramatic moment when Kuo Chii, digging the grave for his son, discovers a pot of gold, an ample reward for his filial devotion. The action is set in a picturesque landscape 265 Herbert A.Giles, Chinese Biographical Dictionary (Taipei, I97I, reprint ed.), p.847, no.2243. 266 Morohashi, Vol.6, p. I I5 I, no. 17487. Fou Ch'iu-kung is an ancient immortal said to be from the time of the Yellow Emperor. In the Lieh Tzu, he is referred to as Hu Ch'iu-tzu; in the Han Shu as Fou Ch'iu-po: the poem, "Lin-hai-ch'iao," by Hsieh Ling-yun (3 8 5-43 3) mentions Fou Ch'iu-kung. In Eastern Han mirror inscriptions and later, Wang Tzu-ch'iao is coupled with Chih Sung-tzu (Master Red Pine), two famous crane riders, see Soper, Textual Evidence, p. 40. 267 Juliano, Art of the Six Dynasties, Nelson Gallery Sarcophagus, nos. 48 a and b.

Z69 The Kuo Chii scene is identified on the tile by two characters giving his name and identifying the pot of gold. As publish- ed in the original report, these characters appear backwards. It is difficult to say whether the tile was stamped incorrectly or if the photo was printed incorrectly. My description in the text and the photograph included conform to the original publication, Teng-hsien, p. 17, Fig. I 5. When the tile is reversed, see Fig. 72, the compositional problems remain essentially the same. 55</page><page sequence="67">with a rich variety of vegetation reminiscent of both the Seven Sthe Seven Sages tomb and the Nelson Gallery sarcophagus.270 The basic composition resembles that of the Seven Sages in Nanking (Fig. 75). A row of variegated trees stretches across the foreground and extends from the lower border to the top edges of the tile, overlapping the floral border. Three trees are spaced regularly on the left and two sprouts of young bamboo on the right. Most of the scene occupies the foreground. Kuo Chii, his wife, and the pot of gold are placed between, but slightly behind the trees. A naive attempt is made to push back the space to the middle ground by adding more vegetation behind the figures. Relationships between the foreground, the trees, the figures, and the vegetation are misunderstood and inconsistent. For example, although Kuo Chii and his wife are supposed to be behind the trees and bamboo sprouts, his flapping robes and her scarves cross in front of the bamboo and trees. Figure 73, also described in Chapter I, shows the four recluses or sages of South Mountain seated in a mountain landscape. Of the five tiles in this group, this one has the most sophisticated composition. A row of flat overlapping mountains with a variety of vegetation creates a space cell or cubicle; two straight trees on the right and left sides define the limits of this space. The four sages sit inside it. The one on the left is closest to the foreground and sits on the edge of a ledge dangling his feet in what might be a stream. Directly in the center, a small plant grows from this foreground ledge. Two sages sit farther back in the middle ground behind the fore- ground plant and figure. The middle ground is given more emphasis by several parallel lines indicating the horizontal plane of the ground. The fourth sage on the right is seated near the ledge but not on it. This figure is playing a zither, cb'in, which provides a strong horizontal accent. Further to the right and behind the fourth sage, a monkey scratching his back perches on a tall rock. In contrast to the Kuo Chii scene, the position of the foreground and middle ground ele- ments is logical and consistent creating a plausible separation between the foreground and the middle ground. This convincing transition also creates a clearly defined area for the Four Sages. What remain to be resolved are the logical transitions from the middle ground to the far distance suggested by the flying birds in the upper right corner and from the horizontal plane of the ground to the vertical rise of the mountains. Although this scene articulates a convincing spatial depth, its visual impact and clarity are marred by problems of scale. Often the size of objects, particularly the vegetation, belies their position in space. The organization of this composition and the stylistic characteristics of the landscape and figures elicit comparisons with the pottery tiles from Szechwan, the Seven Sages in the Nanking tomb, and the filial piety stories on the Nelson Gallery sarcophagus. The moulded pottery tiles from Yang-tzu-shan, Szechwan, use a similar approach in constructing the mountain setting, overlapping triangular layers.271 Like the Seven Sages, the figures assume relaxed posi- tions, kneeling, sitting, or reclining, and their bodies are articulated by the flow of their long robes. These traditional garments soften the characteristic angularity of the Teng-hsien figure 270 The same dramatic moment is depicted on the sarcophagus, Kuo Chii digging a grave with his wife and child nearby. But an additional scene shows Kuo Chii returning home triumphantly with the gold. Juliano, Art of the Six Dynasties, p. 78, no. 48: IIb and Soper, "Discovery," pp. 70-86. 271 Akiyama, Arts of China, Vol. , p. I20, nos. 212-213. 56</page><page sequence="68">style. The oval heads and dangling sleeves of the Nanking sages betray a similar but more subdued angularity. Like the filial piety scenes on the Nelson Gallery sarcophagus, the four sages landscape exhibits not only a rich repertory of trees, mountains, and animals, but also a lively animation. Trees sway, birds fly, and mountains undulate (Fig. 126). Most of these landscape elements are transformed into highly stylized and somewhat decorative forms. The stylized nature of the landscape is further emphasized by the contrast with more naturalistic forms portrayed in the compositions, e. g. the monkey. Such stylization or studied artificiality dominates the landscape composition of the fifth and sixth centuries and may actually reflect the aristocratic taste for elegantly appointed gardens with artificial lakes, hills, and strangely shaped rocks as a new awareness of nature.272 Such stylization also emphasizes the symbolic and secondary role landscape played at this time. Curiously, the hair on the heads of the Four Sages falls loose about their shoulders. This is also true of both representations of Fou Chiu-kung (Figs. 68, 69) and of one of the Seven Sages, Yuan Ch'i, from the Nanking tomb (Fig. 75 bottom, left).273 The Nanking Sages are the earliest representation of this famous literary theme. A description of Yuan Ch'i quoted by Nagahiro specifically mentions long untied hair.274 Yiian Ch'i and Hsi Kang were leaders of the Seven Sages and the strongest and most violent critics of third century Confucianism, particularly its sometimes hypocritical ritualism.275 Perhaps Yuan Ch'i's audacious rejection of both hat and tied hair as visible badges of one's station in life, symbolized the anti-establishment behavior the Seven Sages came to stand for. The Four Greybeards of South Mountain (Fig. 73) were also protesting political conditions in China at the end of the Ch'in Dynasty and withdrew to Mount Shang until the Han Empire was established and they were recalled to service.276 The theme of the Seven Sages and their way of life strongly appealed to the southern aristocrats whose fates were subject to sudden reversals. The story and fame of the first meet- ings outside Loyang spread rapidly thoughout China and became synonymous with a school of Taoist philosophy and a tradition which survived long after the Seven Sages were gone.277 272 Sickman and Soper, The Art and Architecture of Cina, pp. 376-377. Apparently, these gardens contained both natural and artificial effects. Nagahiro felt this partial artificiality reflected the cultural consciousness of luxury minded nobles, The Representational Arts of The Six Dynasties, p. xix. Edward Schafer in describing the development of hunting parks in China mentions that during the confused centuries of the Six Dynasties, the concept of two kinds of gardens began to take root: i) small natural gardens for writers and scholars to pursue their esthetic interests and feel at home in 2) artificial gardens sometimes very large, where tasteful elegance was sought as a kind of playground for aristocrats, "Hunting Parks," pp. 3 37-8. For a list of parks with very brief descriptions in Loyang and its environs see Han Bielenstein, "Lo-yang in Later Han Times," Bulletin of the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities, 48 (1976), pp. I-I44. 273 Nagahiro, The Representational Art of the Six Dynasties, P1. 4. 274 Ibid., p.52 275 Donald Holzman, "Les Sept Sages de la foret des Bambous et la societe de leur temps," T'oung Pao, XLIV (1956), pp 328-338. 276 Morohashi, Vol.3, p. 287, no. 243 and Mayers, p. 305, no. 84. Apparently in the Six Dynasties period, withdrawal from society assumed two forms. Until the end of the Western Chin, retirement was a form of political protest. This would include both the Seven Sages and the earlier Four Greybeards. In Eastern Chin, retirement was motivated by a desire to escape from the irksome responsibilities of government service in an unstable period and a need for intellectual pursuits, Richard Mather, "The Landscape Buddhism of the Fifth Century Poet Hsieh Ling-yun," Journal of Asian Studies, (I95 8), p.68, n.7. 277 For an excellent discussion of the rise of Neo-Taoism in the early Six Dynasties and its impact on Chinese painting see Laing, "Neo-Taoism," pp. 5-54. 57</page><page sequence="69">Judging from literary sources and meagre artistic remains, the subject apparently was a popular one. As Dr. Soper pointed out, this theme was already familiar in art by the mid-fourth cen- tury.278 K K'ai-chih mentions a painting of the Seven Sages in the Lun Hua.279 This popu- larity was further confirmed with the discovery of the Seven Sages in the Nanking tomb, in the recently excavated tomb at Hu-ch'iao near Nanking, and by the presence of the Four Sages in the Teng-hsien tomb.280 The last tile in this group illustrates another paragon of filial virtue, Lao Lai-tzu (Fig. 74).281 He is frequently represented in the Han Dynasty and remained consistently popular through the Six Dynasties. In Teng-hsien, Lao Lai-tzu is shown on the left dressed as a child playing in front of his aged parents who sit in a kind of baldachino. The entire scene is quite simple with no suggestion of landscape setting. The baldachino structure is particularly interesting since its roof and floor are drawn with the perspective formula used in the Admonitions Scroll (Fig. I27). The floor is tilted up slightly and the side of the roof and floor do not recede along a diagonal but spread out in space. This kind of perspective is frequent in Six Dynasties art and will be considered at greater length later. FIGURAL STYLE The treatment of the human figure in the preceding categories betrays a marked change from the Han dynasty (Fig. 32, 34, 35, 39-4I, 43-49, 5I, 52). Proportions shift dramatically. The head becomes small and egg-shaped while the body elegantly attenuates. With few exceptions, the figures, regardless of activity, are described from a three-quarter view and have highly stylized forms. Those figures wearing the short tunic and tied trousers follow the same pattern whether walking or standing. An oval head sits on a cylindrical neck which recedes into the collar of the tunic. The torso, defined by the belted tunic, thrusts forward at the waist, and both legs are bent at the knee. Head, hands, face, and clothing end in points. The body is constructed with a greater interest in evoking a persuasive sense of rhythmic movement than in the anatomical structure. Although the tiles are moulded in relief, line is the descriptive tool used to achieve most effects. Lines create severely angular forms which are juxtaposed and repeated, infusing the figures with vitality and dynamic movement as in the groups of soldiers who march briskly across tiles (Figs. 43-48). In these processional groups there is no indication of any background or environment. The figures fill three-quarters of the height of the tiles with their feet just above the lower edge, and dominate the shallow foreground space. Their mass is suggested by the layering of two dimensional planes. Spatial interaction is evoked by position, thick and thin raised lines, over- lapping, and diminution of size. In Fig. 44 with five marching musicians, both legs and horns 278 Soper, "Discovery," p. 85. 279 Ibid. 280 EVen VWu, 1974, no. 2, pp 44-5 6. 281 Southern Dynasties literary sources translated by Soper provide ample evidence of the popularity of this Confucian virtue as a standard for behavior and as a favorite subject for decoration, Textual Evidence, pp. 13, I7, 23. 58</page><page sequence="70">overlap and the flute player turns his head and torso to look back creating a sense of twisting in space without breaking the rhythm of the forward movement. In Figure 49 depth is created by moving one of the four figures up from the lower edge to about the middle ground and diminishing her size. However, with all the devices used, any spatial effects achieved remain subordinate to the total two-dimensional linear effects. The figures dressed in more traditional Chinese robes follow the same basic formula. But the loose skirts, trousers, and belted tunics with long wide sleeves modify the angularity and movement. Although the torso is still thrust forward, it flows into the graceful sweeping curve of the skirt or loose trousers culminating at the pointed end of the shoes. The only movement articulated in these figures is that of the drapery itself which seems to respond to currents of air blowing from left to right or vice versa. In Fig. 49, the skirts widen at the bottom and appear to billow out to the left along with the long wide sleeves. This effect is created by lines; vertical lines fan out from the waist and are more widely spaced at the left than the right. The figures seem still and poised yet appear to glide effortlessly through space. The apsarases display the most dazzling use of drapery to evoke movement; the forms of the figures dissolve in the flurry of flapping scarves. Both figures in the Kuo Chii scene (Fig. 71) also wear traditional robes. The wife's robes, with floating scarves and full sleeves, are reminiscent of Ku K'ai-chih's ladies (Fig. I28). How- ever, in the Teng-hsien style, the forms are more tapered, angular, and intense.282 The heavy dependence on line of this figural style emphasizes the close kinship between the Teng-hsien moulded reliefs and the world of the brush. The nature of this dependence is further clarified when a comparison is made between the painted lines of the late Koguryo tombs and the tapered raised lines from the Teng-hsien tiles; their variations in shape, thick- ness, and fluency are just like the painted ones. Teng-hsien tiles are in fact not just moulded reliefs but translations of a painterly style carried even further by the emphatic use of color on the tiles. The color slides of a few of these tiles show color exploited not only for decorative effects but also to heighten the pictorial ones.283 The most dramatic example occurs in one scene illus- trating the story of Wang Tzu-ch'iao. A single undulating line extends across the right top edge of the tile, evoking a sense of a distant mist shrouded mountain range (Fig. 68). In a black and white photograph, this spatial effect is certainly suggestive but not definitive in the context of the entire composition and could possibly be interpreted as something else. Color and the painterly technique applied to this undulating line create a far more powerful visual effect. Two stripes of color are placed just beneath the raised mountain line; the first is very light blue; the second, black, appears to shade down to a lighter grey. The distant mountain range is now either mist-shrouded or snow-capped. Color used in this manner further empha- sizes the kinship between the Teng-hsien moulded reliefs and the brush. 282 The ideal Six Dynasties lady, a slim-waisted beauty, exists during the Late Chou-Han periods and is preserved on silk paintings of the period, see Akiyama, Arts of China, Vol.I, p.

The similarities between this early sixth century figural style and that of Ku K'ai-chih are obvious; its presence at Teng-hsien and on other sixth century examples may be a result of the great master's continuing influence. 6o</page><page sequence="72">CHAPTER IV POTTERY FIGURINES A described in Chapter I, fifty-five pottery figurines, ranging from I9 to 30 cm. in height, were salvaged from this tomb. Many were badly damaged and their original position in the tomb disturbed. Only twenty complete figurines were reproduced in the original archeolo- gical report (Figs. I29-I4I).284 Unfortunately, the poor quality of the photographs and the present state of scholarship in this area hamper an extensive stylistic evaluation of these figu- rines. Although substantial numbers are known from private and museum collections and from excavations, pottery figurines, or ming-ch'i made from the Han through T'ang dynasties, have long been ignored by serious scholarship. Those from the Han and Six Dynasties have been particularly neglected. The cosmopolitan culture of the T'ang dynasty and its mastery of sculp- ture in the round achieved a kind of sophistication which has consistently attracted more atten- tion from Western scholars.285 However, this situation has gradually begun to change as ming- ch'i have achieved recognition as a mainstay of China's non-Buddhist sculptural tradition, and as excavations have provided a continuous stream of new, often unusual material for study.286 At present, the study of Six Dynasties pottery figurines still suffers from this lack of interest and from the complexities endemic to the period. The following discussion will attempt to articulate some of the problems surrounding the Teng-hsien figurines and to place them in some kind of chronological context. From the available evidence, the development of Six Dynasties ming-ch'i separates into three phases, echoing the major political developments of this period.287 The first phase stretch- es from the fall of the Han Dynasty to about the mid to late fifth century, including the Three Kingdoms, Western and Eastern Chin, as well as the early Northern Wei period. During this phase, ming-ch'i largely remain under the shadow of the Han traditions, both in subject matter and style. Even the strong regional styles persist, particularly in South China where the greater 284 See Chapter I for a complete list and description of the pottery figurines found in the tomb. 285 T'ang ming-ch'i, with their varied subject matter including foreigners, three-dimensional modeling, and strong coloring, have always been more appealing to Western tastes, for examples see J. G. Mahler, The Westerners Among the Figurines of the T'ang Dynasty (Rome, I959). Ezekiel Schloss, Foreigners in Ancient Chinese Art (New York: The China Institute in America, I969). 286 Scholarship has significantly advanced with the publication of a major study of ming-ch'i by Ezekiel Schloss, Ancient Chinese Ceramic Sculpture from Han to T'ang (Stamford: I977), 2 vols. 287 The categorization applied to the ming-ch'i and in Chapter II to the tomb architecture reflects the major stylistic evolution of all major art forms of the Six Dynasties. For a broader perspective of the stylistic changes characteristic of the entire Six Dynasties period see the Introduction to the catalogue done by the author, Juliano, Art of the Six Dynasties, pp. i i-i 8. 6i</page><page sequence="73">freedom and expressiveness associated with Han ming-ch'i from Hunan and Szechwan continue to shape pottery figurines during the Six Dynasties period.288 However, the Han style which dominates this first phase reveals marked deterioration in modeling techniques and propor- tions. The bold and well-balanced proportions of Han give way to the lumpy and ill-defined. This deterioration is particularly visible in ming-ch'i excavated from South China.289 In the Han Dynasty, many ming-ch'i were constructed by a "cookie cutter" technique using two molds.29o For figures, the front half was joined to the back half. The seams can be seen running from the top of the head down the sides to the feet. For animals, the right half is joined to the left half and here the mold seam divides the animal into two mirror image halves.291 The majority of Han ming-ch'i were not conceived as truly three-dimensional forms but as molded reliefs which have been doubled. During this first phase, the molding process is modified, particularly for figures. The heads and bodies were molded, fired separately, and then assembled, probably with slip. The head fits into a socket at the neck. This type of two-part construction became characteristic of Six Dynasties up until at least the Sui Dynasty.292 As the Northern Wei empire took shape in North China near the end of the first phase, the differences between Northern and Southern ming-ch'i sharpened. The second phase, which extends from the end of the fifth century to about the middle of the sixth century, is charac- terized by the presence of two styles or traditions, a Northern and a Southern one.293 Due to the increasing amount of archeological evidence from Northern China, the development of the Northern style can be discussed with more confidence than that of the Southern Dynasties. Contrary to the suggestion of Kosei Ando that ming-ch'i showed little development during the Six Dynasties period, a truly innovative style emerged in the North during the early sixth century under the aegis of the Northern Wei.294 Excellent examples of this style are represented in private and museum collections as well as in reports from two recent excavations in Hopei and Honan provinces. One tomb was excavated in the Chii-yang district in Hopei and can be dated by epitaph inscriptions to 524; the other was excavated in the vicinity of Loyang and belonged to the T'o-pa prince Yuan Shao and his father who died in 528 and 520 respectively 288 For a selection of Han examples from Szechwan see Ssu-ch'uan Han-tai t'ao-yung (Peking, I963); and for an enchanting example, two seated scribes dated to the Chin Dynasty and excavated from the Ch'ang-sha area in Hunan, see K'ao-ku hsiieh-pao, I 9 5 9, no. 3, Pl. Io. 289 For examples of Wu Kingdom ming-ch'i excavated in Hupei see K'ao-ku I959, no.4, pp. 189-90, PI. 7 and for a selection from the Nanking area, Nan-cbhing Liu-ch'ao t'ao-yung (Peking, 195 8); for examples from the Loyang area dated to the West- ern Chin Dynasty see K'ao-ku hsiieh pao, 1957, no. i, pp. I69-I85. 290 See Schloss, Ancient Chinese Ceramic Sculpture for the most comprehensive discussion of mold techniques published so far, pp. 47-60. 29I The mold seams on the Han pottery figurines and animals are partially visible on a female figure from T'ung-shan District, Kiangsu (p. I66, no. 289), male figures from Yi-pin Municipality, Szechwan (p. I68, nos. 294-296) and animals from Szechwan (p. I69, no. 300) and from Shensi (p. 171, no. 308), Akiyama, Arts of China, Vol.1. 292 This two part construction is clearly visible in the heads and headless bodies excavated from the Teng-hsien tomb, see Figs. 138, 139, and Teng-hsien, p.48, Fig.64 and p.49, Fig.65. 293 One criterion traditionally applied to separate Northern and Southern ming-ch'i is the color of clay, red in the South and grey in the North. This criterion is no longer viable since graves have been found in both North and South China which have figures made from both types of clay. 294 Akiyama, Arts of China, Vol.I, p. 145. The characteristics of this innovative style are more fully discussed by Schloss, Ancient Chinese Ceramic Sculpture, pp. 23-2 8 and Juliano, Art of the Six Dynasties, pp. I 3-I 5. 62</page><page sequence="74">(Figs. II-I23).295 Stylistically, these Northern Wei ming-c'i, particularly the figurines, break definitively with Han traditions. The proportions of the figures shift dramatically. A small head rests on a slender cylindrical neck and elegantly attenuated body. The majority of figures stand, kneel, or sit stiffly in strongly frontal and symmetical postures. Details are delicately articulated in planes of low relief and incised lines creating flat two-dimensional forms. Most of this modeling is restricted to the front. Except for the head, the back of the figure is flat with few or no incised details (Fig. I2I).296 Seen from the side, this flatness is dramatically apparent; many of the figures are less than one inch thick. The flat frontal concept strongly points to influence from the Northern Wei Buddhist sculpture of the early sixth century. This interaction with Buddhist styles is further evident in facial features which mirror the typical Northern Wei Buddhist face in stone and bronze, elegantly arched eyebrows, small nose, "archaic" smile, oval or squarish face, and long cylindrical neck. Most of the pottery figurines whether male or female, courtier or servant, have this same standardized face. Some of the high ranking military officers wear small hats which from the front almost look like an ushnisha. This change in style is also evident in the treatment of Northern Wei animals.297 The bodies of horses and camels reflect the elegant attenuation of the forms and more two-dimen- sional articulation of details. Bases were introduced, undoubtedly to support the more slender and fragile legs of these animals (Fig. z22). Since the archaeological evidence is so meagre, the development of Southern style in ming- h'i during the second phase is not clear.298 The ming-ch'i remain significantly inferior in quality to the North. Although there is no sharp break between the first and second phases, pottery figurines exhibit changes in proportions and modeling. These changes become obvious when comparing figurines dated Eastern Chin to those later produced around the Nanking area.299 Some have large heads and long necks set in short squat bodies. Female figures have hourglass- shaped robes with arms which are too short and articulated as one U-shaped form across the waist (Fig. I42). Sometimes, two small blobs of clay are attached to the lower edge of the skirt to form the feet. Details are minimal except for elaborate coiffures or hair pieces and softly modeled faces with warm engaging smiles.300 Others display more sophisticated modeling and harmonious proportions. Details of clothing and anatomy are more carefully articulated in low relief (Fig. I43).3o0 Elaborate coiffures and soft smiling faces are also standard features. 295 The Hopei Provincial Museum, "Discovery of the Northern Wei Tomb at Ch'u-yang, Hopei," (in Chinese), K'ao-ku, 1972, no. 5, pp. 33-5 5, pis. 9-11 and The Loyang Museum, "Northern Wei Tomb of Yuan Shao at Loyang," (in Chinese), K'ao-ku, 1973, no.4, pp.218-224, Pls.8-i2. 296 K'ao-ku, I973, no. 4, p. 220, Fig. 5: I-2. 297 This change in Northern Wei can clearly be seen by comparing those excavated from the tomb of Ssu-ma Chin-lung in Ta-t'ung dated to 484, Wen Wu, 1972, no. 3, pp. 3I-33, and those from Hopei and Honan dated to the first quarter of the sixth century, Akiyama, Arts of China, Vol.1, p. I45. This new style coincides with the change of the Northern Wei capital, the sinicization program, and the style of Buddhist sculpture. 298 The meagreness and the inferior quality of Southern ming-ch'i in contrast to the North suggests that the South was not as interested in producing ming-ch'i. This tends to be confirmed by recent finds in the South. The excavation report of Hu- ch'iao find at Tan-yang mentions in passing pottery figures among the ceramic objects found in the grave and implies their relative unimportance, Wen Wu, 1974, no.2, p.46. 299 Nan-ching Liu-ch'ao t'ao-yung. 300 Ibid., nos. I5-I7. 301 Ibid. 63</page><page sequence="75">However, none of the Southern figures becomes elegantly attenuated and two-dimensional in conception. The exquisite grace and precise modeling of their Northern counterparts is absent. They retain Han-like proportions with the body basically conceived as a cone. During the second phase, the ming-ch'i from Southern Dynasties tombs have a more limited range. Although other subjects exist, figures seem to constitute the main subject matter; most are dressed in long robes rather than military garb. In contrast, Northern Wei tombs, following in the Han tradition, yield an amazing variety of subjects, including mounted riders, horses, camels, dogs, ox-carts, chickens, pigs, and guardian monsters. Even the activities of the Northern figures are more varied. Besides the ubiquitous military, there are musicians playing instruments and servants performing household chores. The tomb of Yuan Shao near Loyang has two extraordinary figures, a young boy sitting with his head hidden by his arms, and a burly Westerner with thick curly beard and hair.302 The third and last phase is a transitional one which extends from about the mid-sixth century through the Sui Dynasty. The developments during this third phase prepare the way for the splendid sculptural achievements of the T'ang ming-ch'i. Available archeological evi- dence documents these changes more clearly in the North than the South. Excellent examples of this style haveha been found in the Northern Ch'i tomb of Chang Su in Shansi and the Sui tombs of the Feng family in Hopei.303 Figures assume a more columnar and solid form with modeling becoming softer and more sculptural (Fig. I44). Judging from the pottery figurines excavated from a tomb in Ch'ang-sha attributed to the late Six Dynasties or early Sui, figures in the South also apparently become more solid and three-dimensional during the third phase.304 However, in contrast to the Northern Ch'i examples, they exhibit typical Southern style characteristics, squat proportions and inferior modeling, but more expressive faces and postures. The ming-ch'i found in the Teng-hsien tomb fit somewhere into the second phase and belong to the Southern tradition. From the available information about this tomb, figures seem to be the only kinndof min in the tomb. The proportions and modeling belong to the Southern style discussed in phase two. A rather large head and thick neck rest on a short chunky body. Details are often minimal or indicated by incised lines (Figs. I29-14I). A few figures, particularly those dressed in long traditional robes, exhibit more careful attention to details, such as scalloped sleeves and sashes tied at the waist (Figs. I35, I37). The Teng-hsien figures are not as severely frontal as Northern figurines, and they stand with their legs apart. Several figures are shown in active postures, leaning to one side or bending forward (Figs. I37, 138). Most adopt natural relaxed stances with legs apart and feet angled in different directions (Fig. I 33). Movement belongs more typically to Southern ming-ch'i. This tradition of greater freedom of movement and expressiveness so characteristic of Han ming- ch'i continues to exert its influence through the Chin and later Six Dynasties in the South. Northern figures, Wei through Sui Dynasties, are consistently shown with their legs modeled as one solid unit and rarely with legs apart or modeled separately. 302 K'ao-ku, I973, no.4, p.200, Fig.6, P1.9, Fig. 3. 303 T'ai-yiian K'uang-p'o Pei-Ch'i Chang Su-mu wen-wu-t'u-lu (Peking, I958), and Chang Li, "Discussion of the Feng family tombs, Ching Hsien, Hopei," (in Chinese), K'ao-ku, I957, no.3, pp. 28-37. 304 Wen Wu, I960, no.2, pp. 49-54. 64</page><page sequence="76">Although the Teng-hsien figurines can be placed in the second phase or first half of the sixth century, the limited amount of material available from the Southern Dynasties makes it impossible to be more precise. These figures also raise some other provocative issues which cannot be adequately resolved at the present time. Some characteristics of the Teng-hsien figures, i. e. the facial features, suggest that there was interaction between Northern and Southern styles. Considering the ambiguous geographic position of Teng-hsien, such cross influence could easily have taken place. These pottery figures also display a completely different figural style from that depicted on the tiles in this tomb. The figural style on the tiles not only shares similarities with Northern Wei Buddhist art and mortuary stone art but also with early sixth century ming-ch'i of Northern Wei. The description of Northern Wei ming-ch'i closely parallels the one given for the figural style found on the tiles. The most obvious explanation for the juxtaposition of two such very different styles in the same tomb is that the tiles reflect a painterly style and the figures a sculptural one.305 Or perhaps Teng-hsien reflects a mixture or confluence of stylistic influences. 305 The sharp distinctions in dress and style may also reflect differences in rank or class, the ming-ch'i typical of the lowest in the hierarchy. 65</page><page sequence="77">CHAPTER V THE INSCRIPTION AND RELATED PROBLEMS | ]hree lines of characters written in black ink appear on the top edge of a tile depicting two horses led by attendants (Figs. 32, I45). Unfortunately, parts of these lines remain either difficult to decipher or illegible; characters have been chipped off, have faded with age, or were hastily written. The nature of the inscription is also rather unusual and has excited some spe- culation. One would expect the inscription to have been executed more formally, incised or stamped into clay rather than written haphazardly on the edge of a tile.306 These circumstances suggest that the lines may be a graffito rather than an intentional or formal inscription. At present, the inscription has yielded nothing directly concerning the date or ownership of the tomb. Generally, it seems to be a description of a series of events over a period of several months, or perhaps even longer, jotted down by a high ranking officer in the command. Groups of characters mention a large army amassing, horses coming to the edge of a river, and food supplies. However, a few characters contribute some tantalizing bits of information. Liu Han focuses on two groups of characters from the second and third lines: (i) ... pu-ch'u tsai-lu jih-chiu (2) .. chia-tsai Wu-chzn.30 7 The first group includes the term pu-ch'u or private army.308 Such private armies belonged to powerful aristocratic families during the Six Dynasties period, having arisen initially to supplement the inadequate protection provided by govern- ment troops. When imminent danger subsided, the armies became less defensive in nature and were maintained to increase political power and leverage.309 Many officers concurrently occu- pied posts in both government and private armies. The Teng-hsien tomb could have held a commander of one of these private armies.3Io The other character group literally says "home in Wu-chtin" suggesting that the commander and his army may have come from Wu-chiin, which in the period of the Northern and South- ern Dynasties referred to the Suchow region of Kiangsu.3"' Second only to the capital at Nan- king, this area was a center of wealth and prosperity in the South. The connection suggested by this phrase is further supported by another place name recently identified in the inscription by Lin Shu-chung. He interprets lin-ch'eng, ch-yang which precedes pu-ch'z, discussed above, as 306 In the large imperial grave at Hu-ch'iao, Tan-yang, tile fragments bear brief inscriptions identifying the subjects of some surviving scenes and some lost ones. These inscriptions appear to have been done quickly but incised into the clay. Wen Wu, I974, no. 2, p. 5o, Figs. 8-I 5. 307 Liu Han, K'ao-ku, 1959, no. 5, p. 256. The interpretation of these characters is certainly plausible, but it cannot be accept- ed without some qualification since both phrases are being translated out of context. Some nineteen untranslated charac- ters separate them. 308 Morohashi, Vol. XI, p.257 and Wang Yi-t'ung, "Slaves and Other Comparable Social Groups During the Northern Dynasties," HarvardJournal of Asiatic Studies, XVI (I95 3), p. 352. 309 Wang Yi-t'ung, pp. 35 2-3. 310 Customarily when a person in China dies, every effort is made to return the body to the place of birth or "home town" for burial. If this army originated in Chekiang or Kiangsu, the commander buried at Teng-hsien may have originally come from the southern Honan region. 311 Liu Han, p. 256. The use of the term chia or home in this phrase is puzzling, since in this context it is a highly informal choice. This informality stirs further uneasiness about the original purpose of this inscription. 67</page><page sequence="78">another place within the Chekiang-Wu-hsing district.312 The mention of these Southern regions adds to the weight of stylistic evidence linking this tomb to the Southern Dynasties. There are three other characters which Lao Kan believes confirm the southern origin of this tomb. At the top of the second line (Fig. I45), are two characters, t'ao-chiin, "a special term for the imperial troops of the Southern regions."3I3 Furthermore, Lao associates the cha- racter, hsiian, with the personal name of Hsieh Hsiian and suggests that the commander and chief buried at Teng-hsien may have been a follower or a descendent of the renowned general.314 Even though the inscription such as it is strengthens Teng-hsien's ties with the South, it has so far proven useless in establishing a solid basis for dating the tomb, leaving stylistic analysis and comparison to fill the void. Assuming Teng-hsien is a Southern Dynasties tomb, the stylistic analysis is complicated by several factors. First, although the recent excavations in the South around the Nanking area or Tan-yang County have turned up valuable new com- parative material, the chronological relationship between Teng-hsien and the Tan-yang finds, particularly the large grave at Hu-ch'iao, cannot yet be firmly established.3Is Second, Buddhist and non-Buddhist material from the North still remains more plentiful and datable. Stylistic comparison is certainly helpful but limited since the stylistic relationship between Northern and Southern non-Buddhist arts remains speculative at this time.316 However, the use of Northern Dynasties art as a standard of comparison has additional validity in the case of Teng-hsien largely because of its geographic location between the North and South. Most likely, Teng- hsien was exposed to both traditions. Historical evidence indicates that this area apparently was under the control of the Southern Dynasties until 497-8 when the Northern Wei army launched a successful local assault.3'7 Once in control, the Northern Wei emperor planned to use the Teng-hsien area as a base for launching future incursions into the South; these never seriously materialized.318 As far as can be determined, Teng-hsien remained under northern control until the Sui Dynasty uni- fied China again. So, as a Southern Dynasties tomb, Teng-hsien would have had to have been completed by the end of the fifth century. This late fifth century or Southern Ch'i date for Teng-hsien is also preferred by Lin Shu-chung on the basis of the inscription discussed earlier and stylistic parallels with the recent Tan-yang finds.319 312 Lin Shu-chung further points out that the army from the Chekiang-Wu-hsing area was the main strength of the Southern army. Such large scale troop movements as alluded to in the inscriptions began in the Liu Sung. Some of the characters on the pottery figures, (see Chapt.IV, Figs. 137, I4I), specifically chuo-tao and chuo che, can be found in the Sung Shu and in the Shih Shuo Hsin Yu, a fifth century collection of ch'ing-tan, Wen Wu, 1977, no. i, p. 73, n. 5. 313 Professor Lao Kan, for whose assistance the author is most grateful, suggested these interpretations in two letters dated April I 5 and May 14 of I977.

This reference and the following one were located by Dr. Alexander Soper. 318 Wei Shu, 7B, 24b. Although these inscriptions may suggest a late fifth century date for the Teng-hsien tomb, it cannot be unequivocally established that the Teng-ch'eng mentioned in the inscriptions was located precisely where the tomb was uncovered. 319 If Teng-hsien appears to be later in date on the basis of stylistic evidence, one could speculate that the tomb was built under Northern rule but largely by Southern artisans or that the South retained control of the area. 68</page><page sequence="79">CHAPTER VI IMPACT OF THE TENG-HSIEN TOMB he Teng-hsien tomb significantly affects our knowledge of the development of pictorial art from the Han Dynasty through the T'ang. Pictorial art is a term used by Western scholars to describe the changes in subject matter and style which occur on bronze vessels of the Late Chou and Warring States period. Charles Weber, in his study of Late Chou pictorial bronzes, equates this new pictorial style with the emergence of representational or recognizable animal or human forms.320 However, the most essential ingredient of the pictorial style, the presence of an implicit or explicit ground plane to which animals and humans are oriented, goes beyond Weber's criterion of realism. Regardless of the degree of realism, animals and humans are shown existing in an environment consistent with the law of gravity. At its peak, pictorial style on the Late Chou bronzes depicted rather complex human activities, particularly hunts, warfare, and festivals.321 The subsequent development of pictorial art from Han through T'ang (206 B.C. to 906 A.D.) shows continued interest in human activities, growing realism, and gradual mastery of the third dimension. Architecture, furniture, and landscape elements were among the effective devices increasingly utilized to create backdrops for human interaction. Teng-hsien contributes a crucial link in this development between the Han and T'ang dynasties. In the Six Dynasties, as landscape became an important compositional device to create an environment or stage for human figures and activities, two basic pictorial problems had to be resolved: i) the organization of elements, landscape and figures, in space, and 2) the control of the third dimension. The story-telling tiles from Teng-hsien, particularly the scenes of Kuo Chii (Figs. 71,72), the Four Greybeards (Fig. 73), and Lao Lai-tzu (Fig. 74), provide a link between the level of development achieved in the late fourth-early fifth centuries, visible in the Nanking tomb of the Seven Sages (Fig. 75), and the sixth century level of the Nelson Gallery sarco- phagus (Fig. I26).322 The Teng-hsien tiles clearly show an intermediate stage in the resolution of spatial problems during the intervening one hundred years. One of the primary developments visible at Teng-hsien is the acquisition of means for the artist to show a plausible middle ground for figure action. The first attempts toward representa- tion of a middle ground are evident in the scenes in the Nanking tomb. Discovered in 1960, this tomb contains two large scenes on opposite walls depicting the popular theme of the Seven Sages (Fig. 75).323 Actually, there are eight figures, four on each wall. The eighth, the much earlier hermit, Jung Ch'i-ch'i was undoubtedly added for symmetry as well as theme. 320 Weber, Chinese Pictorial Bronze Vessels of the Late Chou Period. 321 Ibid., Part IV, Fig. 54, Jannings bu and Figs. 68 a-g, detail drawings of the decoration of this bu. 322 Juliano, Art of the Six Dynasties, pp. 74-78. 323 Wen u, I960, nos. 8/9, pp. 37-92. Other tile murals depicting the Seven Sages have been found in one or two tombs at Tan-yang; but unfortunately, to date, remain unpublished. Wen Wu, I974, no. 2, p. 49, Fig. 5. 69</page><page sequence="80">A row of bifurcated trees crosses the foreground of the simple composition. All but two of the trees stretch from top to bottom of the panel. The figures lounging on the ground are placed between the trees, in cubicles of space, each containing a seated sage. Like a shallow apse, the cubicle of space is essentially defined by the body of the sage and his long robes which spread out around him. Some attempt was made to push the space farther back by placing bowls on the ground next to three of the sages; the results are suggestive but not very successful. The composition occupies the pictorial space in the foreground and lacks any convincing middle ground. The crux of the problem is the organization of the landscape and figure elements in space. The Teng-hsien tiles clearly show the next step in the progression. Two tiles attempt to re- present a convincing middle ground, one unsuccessfully and the other successfully. In one, the basic composition of the Kuo Chu scene resembles that of the Seven Sages. As described in Chapter III, the spatial relationship between the landscape elements and the human figures is inconsistent and misunderstood. Kuo Chii and his wife are intended to occupy the middle ground behind the trees, yet their flapping scarves deny this by crossing in front of the trees (Figs. 71,72). Such spatial conflicts negate any sense of a plausible middle ground. In the second tile, with the Four Greybeards (Fig. 73), the relationship between the foreground and middle ground elements is logical, creating a convincing space for the figures. The organization of the composition and the visible advance in the handling of space in the Four Sages are carried to a higher level of sophistication and complexity on the Nelson Gallery sarcophagus (Fig. I26). As Dr. Soper commented: "The illustrative method of the Nelson slabs is first of all a sumptuously executed example of the final stage in an early style."324 The Four Sages composition provides the closest prototype to date to the pictorial style on the Nelson slabs. Many elements in the Four Sages (Fig. 73) scene are also found on the Nelson slabs (Fig. I26): i) birds flapping their wings in the sky, 2) smaller and earlier versions of the vertical rocks with slanted tops (chimney rocks), which are tucked into the larger rounded mountain form, 3) scattered parallel lines indicating the horizontal surface of the ground, and 4) outcroppings of vegetation which probably stand for tree clumps on the tops of mountains. Besides this similarity of elements, the Four Sages composition reveals an earlier stage of the same principle of organization that matures in the Nelson slabs. The artist carves out a single space, defined by various landscape elements which create a stage for the figures. This isolated spatial enclosure forms a key structural unit of the landscape composition on the Nelson slabs. These spatial units are subtly linked into a continuous landscape across the sarcophagus. The Nelson slabs also mark another advance in the control of the third dimension, with bold attempts in some scenes to unify the foreground, middle ground, and far distance. Since the Nelson Gallery sarcophagus was not excavated under controlled conditions, its authenticity has been questioned. Suspicion was also stirred by the advanced level of the illustrative methods and the few comparable Six Dynasties pieces. If any question lingers, these tiles from Teng-hsien should dissipate it. Mortuary art, although a major source of indirect information about the subject matters and pictorial style of Six Dynasties painting, must be used in this capacity with caution given 324 Soper, "Life Motion," p. 181. The landscape composition of the Nelson Gallery sarcophagus has been fully discussed by Soper in "Early Chinese Landscape Painting," pp. 14I-I64. 70</page><page sequence="81">its different materials, techniques, and purposes. Some of the extant examples, however, such as the Nelson slabs and the Seven Sages from Nanking, bear a rather direct relationship to painting. The compositions and subjects of these examples strongly point to scroll paintings as prototypes; the wide variety of subject matter and the use of small individual tiles at Teng- hsien are more in character with what we know of tomb decoration from the Han Dynasty, I-nan, Liaoning and Korea. On the other hand, the link in the evolution of landscape compo- sition preserved in the Teng-hsien tiles provides a fruitful source of information about the pictorial style. Furthermore, an interesting phenomenon occurs in the treatment of the decora- tion on the tiles. Many of the tiles have decorative borders of lotus, vines and flowers. On many of these tiles, the figures, animals, or scenes overlap and extend beyond the borders. This suggests, particularly in the illustrative scenes like the story of Lao Lai-tzu (Fig. 74), that the composition was conceived not in decorative terms but in more painterly ones. Scenes were probably drawn from paintings and translated into a decorative context. As mentioned in Chapter III, this kinship between the tiles and painterly techniques is graphically emphasized by the tapered shapes of the moulded reliefs which imitate brush strokes and by the emphatic use of color. The British Museum Admonitions and the Freer Gallery Nymph of the Lo River, two scrolls linked to the Six Dynasties and the name of the painter Ku K'ai-chih, use distinctly different illustrative methods. Dr. Soper has suggested that the difference between these two scrolls is not merely one of date but rather an indication of two very different pictorial methods of illustration.32s The first method, visible in the Admonitions scroll (Figs. I28, 146) and more recently in the lacquer screen from Ssu-ma Chin-lung's tomb (Fig. 125), emphasizes large, carefully drawn and interrelated figures with little or no setting. This method belongs to a tra- dition apparent from at least the Han Dynasty through to the T'ang paintings attributed to Chou Fang, Chang Hsiian, Yen Li-pen, and preserved in the tomb of the Princess Yung-t'ai. The second method, visible in the Nymph of the Lo River (Fig. I47), has small figures placed in a landscape setting, and developed at the end of Han and early Three Kingdoms-Six Dynasties period. The Teng-hsien tiles also strongly point to the existence of two pictorial styles in the Six Dynasties. Except for the tiles with animal representations, the composition and subject matter fall into the same two categories as the scroll paintings mentioned above. One category has tiles with large figures involved in a variety of activities without any setting or with a minimum of setting as in the Lao Lai-tzu scene. Some of the most interesting figure tiles (Figs. 49-52) show long-robed ladies and gentlemen arranged in varied compositions which are similar in conception to the Admonitions scroll. On these tiles, a convincing sense of foreground and shallow middle ground is achieved by varying the size and position of the figures. The second category of tiles contains the story-telling tiles with landscape figure compositions which have already been discussed in some detail (Figs. 71, 72, 73). There are other significant points of similarity in subject matter and style between the Teng-hsien tiles and the Admonitions scroll. Both show palanquins carried on the shoulders of several servants. The Admonitions palanquin has a passenger section enclosed by curtains 325 Soper, "Life Motion," p. 178. 71</page><page sequence="82">and folding screens (Fig. 42); the Teng-hsien version is left open (Fig. 41). The Teng-hsien palanquin has only four carriers and the other one at least six. More importantly, however, both are drawn using the same perspective. The palanquins are shown tilted slightly up and spread out but are quite convincing. The same kind of perspective appears in the other scenes in both the Admonitions scroll and the tiles. The scroll provides another excellent example; in one scene a woman is seated inside a Chinese tester bed or k'ang-ch'uang talking with a man who is seated halfway in with his legs hanging down (Fig. I27). The divan is spatially con- vincing, but is shown tilted slightly upward, particularly the canopy which spreads out as it recedes. The viewer is apparently looking at the roof from above. On the Teng-shien tiles, this method of perspective is also used in the Lao Lai-tzu scene (Fig. 74). The roof of the baldachino-like structure, where Lao Lai-tzu's parents sit, is rendered in the same way-tilted up and spread out. This kind of perspective achieves several effects. The tilting up of the ground plane and the expansion of the architectural structures as they recede emphatically emphasize the ground plane and the limits of the space.326 The examples described above from Teng-hsien and the Admonitions scroll have minimal settings with little or no landscape; the architectural struc- tures define the space the figures occupy and often the transition between the foreground and the middle ground. Since these structures spread out as they recede, interior spaces can be utilized more effectively, and activities depicted within are more easily perceived by the viewer. This also allows the viewer multiple vantage points and unifies the interior and the exterior spaces, effects not possible with conventional perspective. Both the Nelson slabs and the re- cently excavated lacquer screen from Ssu-ma Chin-lung's tomb in Shansi also have this type of perspective, which is consistently used in Six Dynasties non-Buddhist art and is clearly a characteristic of the pictorial style. The similarities between the pictorial style and subject matter of the Admonitions scroll and the excavated Teng-hsien find establish this scroll as a document which reflects accurately some of the pictorial means available to artists in the Six Dynasties. The questions surrounding its connection with Ku K'ai-chih and its originality do not affect its value as a repository of Six Dynasties pictorial style. The recently excavated lacquer screen (Fig. 25) from Ssu-ma Chin-lung's tomb further confirms the accuracy of the pictorial style preserved in the Admonitions scroll.327 A salient feature of these painted lacquer panels is their stylistic affinity with the scroll and consequently with the Teng-hsien tiles. In specific instances, scroll, screen panels, and tiles share the same subject matter, and in the broadest terms, the same figural style. Two screen panels show a palanquin carried by four servants and an elaborate cart pulled by an ox; both exhibit the same perspective.328 Standing females, the most frequent figural type, also have the animated pro- 326 The characteristics of this perspective create a balance between the three-dimensional and the two-dimensional; that is structures appear spatially convincing but at the same time flattened. As a result three-dimensional effects do not over- whelm the two-dimensional power of the line. This kind of balance or tension is fundamental to Chinese art and is ex- ploited in later landscape painting. 327 Wen Wu, I972, no.3, pp. 20-33, Pls. 12-14, and Wen-hua ta-k'e, pp.143, I44. A tomb recently found at Chang-chou outside Nanking shows the importance of mortuary art as a source of information on pictorial style and painting of the period. Dated late Southern Dynasties to early T'ang, the tomb's stamped tiles depict single servant figures characteristic of early T'ang tomb wall paintings and undoubtedly T'ang figure painting.

Surviving from Han are the Confucian theme of filial piety as depicted in the Kuo Chii and Lao Lai-tzu scenes and a fondness for the representation of pro- cessions. Processions, usually with figures in carriages or on horses, form a major part of Han tomb decoration. The Teng-hsien tiles show mostly figures on foot, playing musical instru- ments, and carrying a variety of objects. As in the I-nan tomb where the front chamber shows a group of figures bearing gifts to celebrate the sacrificial feast, the Teng-hsien processions may lead to a ceremonial place, which appeared on the missing or destroyed tiles.33' Given the military character of Teng-hsien's decor, an elaborate funeral procession or honor guard is more likely, however. Despite the continuity with Han, the Teng-hsien tomb tiles also reflect the new interests of the Six Dynasties. Buddhist motifs reshape the decorative vocabulary while older traditional subjects, such as the directional animals and the Four Sages, achieve a new prominence. One of the difficult questions of the Six Dynasties period is the relationship between the art of the Northern Dynasties and that of the Southern Dynasties. In 1960, Dr. Soper de- monstrated in his article, "Southern Chinese Influence in the Buddhist Art of the Six Dynasties Period," that Southern Dynasties Buddhist art provided the creative force which brought Northern Buddhist art to maturity.332 This influence is visible in the dramatic changes in North- ern Buddhist art in the first decades after 480 A.D. and in the third quarter of the sixth cen- tury.333 The powerful stimulus from the South must have affected the mortuary and non-Buddhist arts. The small amount of extant non-Buddhist art from the Southern Dynasties and the pro- blem of dating surrounding many of the pieces make a definitive statement premature. How- ever, several factors verify the South's key role. The decor found in the Southern tombs in Tan-yang County, specifically the largest royal tomb at Hu-ch'iao, datable to the late fifth cen- tury or 495, is very telling. Both the floral motifs and the forms of the three apsarases in the Hu-ch'iao tomb clearly pre-date similar types in Northern art of the early decades of the sixth century.334 Although the chronological relationship cannot be firmly fixed, Hu-ch'iao and Teng-hsien have many significant stylistic and iconographic affinities. Finally, the South pos- sessed a distinct psychological advantage. The court at Chien-k'ang was the legitimate inheritor 329 Clearly the Ku K'ai-chih-like profile of the figures on the lacquer screen reveals far less skilled hands. Most of the figures are shown from the same monotonous three-quarter view. They appear heavy and cumbersome with rather stiff floating scarves.

Wen Wu, I977, no. i, p. 66. 73</page><page sequence="84">not only of the the throne but also of China's cultural and spiritual identity. With the T'o-pa's deliberate sinification campaign culminating in the relocation of the capital to Loyang in 494, emulation of the South would become even more desirable.335 This effort would further blur the distinction between the cultural entity of the South and the ruder "barbarian" culture of the North. In summary, Teng-hsien is a provocative addition to the small but growing body of non- Buddhist art from the Six Dynasties. The tomb's uniqueness stems from its ambiguous loca- tion on the disputed border between the northern and southern territories and also from the extraordinary richness of its decorated tiles. The presence of these tiles and the absence of other data leave stylistic analysis and comparison as the key tools with which to attack the questions of dating and provenance. Stylistic analysis yields the following conclusions. First, in spite of its borderline geographic position, Teng-hsien belongs to the Southern Dynasties. The weight of archeological and stylistic evidence upholds its southern origin, particularly since brick tomb construction and molded tile decoration seem to have been far more popular in the South during this period. Second, on the basis of strong stylistic affinities between the repertory of floral patterns and representational scenes on the tiles and that found on dated examples of Northern Wei mortuary and Buddhist art, Teng-hsien can be dated to the late fifth or early sixth centuries. The sparser remains of Southern Dynasties art also support this dating. Teng-hsien fits comfortably between the late fifth century (ca.495) material found at Hu-ch'iao near Nanking, and the early sixth century stele (ca. 5 26) of Hsiao Hung. Evidence from Teng-hsien coupled with the new material from Hu-ch'iao makes it possible to formulate a more coherent picture of Southern Dynasties non-Buddhist art. Certainly styl- istic evolution from the earlier Hu-ch'iao finds to the later Hsiao Hung stele broadly outlines the basic development. At the same time, the stylistic and iconographic differences between Teng-hsien and Hu-ch'iao do not yield completely to the dictates of stylistic evolution. Another factor, specifically the geographic locations of Teng-hsien in Honan and Hu-ch'iao in Kiangsu warrants further investigation. For the differences exhibited by these tombs suggest that the regional styles of the Han Dynasty had continuing influence. Many of the motifs found at Teng-hsien ultimately belong to Han style from Szechwan and Hunan. Beyond the immediate concerns of dating and provenance, stylistic analysis defines the impact that this tomb has on our understanding of Six Dynasties pictorial art. The scenes pre- served on the tiles fill a significant gap in the development of space in landscape composition, and add more weight and authority to known but controversial examples of Six Dynasties art. The eclectic subject matter, including Buddhist, Taoist and Confucian themes, not only reflects the intellectual and philosophic ferment of this period but also reveals the various forces af- fecting the character of pictorial art. The Teng-hsien tomb also raises, in microcosm, other issues which are important to the continuing study of the non-Buddhist or mortuary art traditions of the period. Strong stylistic affinities between the late fifth century Southern finds at Hu-ch'iao and the early sixth century 335 Michael C. Rogers in his article, "The Myth of the Battle of the Fei River," discussed the role of the South's "mystique of legitimacy" and its effect on the North in the arena of politics. He also points out that the Sui Emperor Wen Ti who unified China had to prepare for the conquest of the South both militarily and spiritually to claim the mandate to rule that would outweigh the Southern claim of legitimacy, p. 6i, no. 26. T'oung Pao, Vol. LIV, I-3 (1968), pp. 50-72. 74</page><page sequence="85">art of Northern Wei elicit speculation about the relationship between Northern and Southern Dynasties art. From available evidence the subject matter and style visible in Hu-ch'iao, Teng- hsien, and on the Hsiao Hung stele affected mortuary art in and around Loyang during the first thirty years of the sixth century, eventually reaching the far northwest frontier, judging from Cave 285 at Tun-huang. However, these strong stylistic ties between Northern Wei and Teng-hsien also suggest that by the early sixth century a common stylistic vocabulary dominated the eastern central area of China as a result of interaction in and around the border areas. Examples of non-Bud- dhist and Buddhist art from the Northern Wei Dynasty in Honan and southern Hopei and the few shreds from Kiangsu, southern Honan, and Hupei confirm this view. 75</page><page sequence="86">GLOSSARY chang t~ Chang Hsiian M Chang Seng-yu i#ig, Chen-chiang ~IJ: ch'i I ch'i-lmn li9 chia g chia-tsai Wu-chiin n4E chiao-yeh A chien-hua-kuan _fi- Chien-k'ang j ch'ien-ch'iu Rk ch'in * ch'ing-t'an Mt ch'iu-sheng Tf Chou Fang jit Chou Ling Wang (571 B.C.)
