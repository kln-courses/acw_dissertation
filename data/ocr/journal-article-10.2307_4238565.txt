<plain_text><page sequence="1">A NEW INTERPRETATION OF JUPITER ELICIUS. MARION AYER RUBINS. A MONG the many cult titles of Jupiter appears the name Elicius, an epithet which is far from clear in its meaning. The evidence in ancient authors is conflicting, and the theories of modern scholars are at variance. Once the name must have had a definite meaning. But by the end of the Republic, there are only indefinite statements. Jupiter Elicius is mentioned only five times in ancient authors, there is no evidence of any temple or statue of him, although there is mention of an altar dedicated to him on the Aventine Hill; and there have been found no inscriptions which name him. Appar- ently the cult of Jupiter Elicius was not one of the vigorous ones which formed an essen- tial part of the Roman state religion, but had originated during the primitive period and then experienced no further development. Jupiter Elicius may have represented an early nuministic idea, 2 but he apparently never emerged clearly and never as an anthropomorphic god. The literary sources ascribe his worship to Numa, or else intimate that in the Late Republic he was a god of the past. In order to explain his epithet, authors employed aetiological myth, an indication that the really essential meaning of Elicius had become for- gotten and had to be recalled on the basis of logic or legend. It thus appears that we must look for the explanation of Jupiter Elicius in some function which was necessary in the beginning of Roman religion, but which could be dispensed with and was forgotten later. At present there are two theories regarding the meaning and function of Jupiter Elicius : (1) as a god of lightning ; (2) as a god of rain. The explanation as a god of light- ning or lightning omens and interpretation arises from a more or less literal acceptance of the accounts in ancient authors: belief in him as a god of rain is proposed by modern investigators of Roman religion who have not been satisfied with the confusion in the literary sources and have identified the cult of Jupiter Elicius with the rite of the aquaelicium and the use of the lapis manalis to elicit rain. Is either one of these theories correct? VARRO, L.L., vi, 94; LIVY, i, 20, 7; i, 31, 8; OVID, Experience of the Roman People, London, 1911, 118-120; Fasti, iii, 327-392; PLINY, N.H., ii, 140. WM. R.

VARRO (L.L., vi, 94) explains Jupiter Elicius as derived ab eliciendo, but does not define what objects are elicited. In addition to this unsatisfactory explanation, VARRO informs us that Jupiter Elicius had an altar on the Aventine. sic Elicii Iovis ara in Aven- tino ab eliciendo. When we seek an indication of what object was elicited or drawn forth, it appears that PLINY apparently believes it was the lightning, OVID states that it was Jupiter himself, who is asked for information as to expiations for lightning, and LIVY is usually interpreted as stating either lightning or omens. PLINY (N.H., ii, 140) says that one may read in the Annals that lightning was compelled or obtained: in Etruria there was an old story that Porsena had evoked lightning in Vol- sinii, and before him the act had often been performed by Numa, according to the authority of L. PIso. In an effort to imitate Numa, Tullus Hostilius was killed by lightning. PLINY concludes this passage with the generalization : ((we have groves and altars and sacred rites, and among the Stayers and the Thunderers and the Strikers, we have accepted Jupiter Elicius too. lucosque et aras et sacra habemus interque Statores ac Totantes et Feretrios Elicium quoque accepimus lovem. This rather vague statement is apparently PLINY'S effort to establish a relation between the evocation of lightning and the title Jupiter Elicius. OVID gives a different explanation of the term. At first he speaks as though Jupiter Elicius meant Jupiter ((Summoned Forth ,. ((They draw thee from the sky, Jupiter, whence later generations now worship thee, and call thee Elicius)) (Fasti, iii, 327 f.): eliciunt caelo te, Juppiter, unde minores nunc quoque te celebrant Eliciumque vocant. But the purpose of the drawpng forth is to seek expiations for lightning. In the third book of the Fasti, lines 259 f., Ovid asks why the Salii bear the heavenly weapons of Mars and sing of Mamurius. The poet does not give an answer immediately, but creates a special atmosphere and situation. During the reign of Numa, Jupiter terrifies the people by frequent lightning, and Numa is advised by Egeria to seek expiations from Picus and Faunus. The king goes to their haunt on the Aventine, catches them by a trick, but they have no power to give him the information he wishes. So they summon forth Jupiter, by means too mysterious for man to know. After Numa has recovered from his terror he asks Jupiter for expations for lightning, da certa piamina..... fulminis. Jupiter gives the information, but in ambiguous terms, which Numa interprets as he wishes. OVID, Fasti, iii, 333 f. 86 MARION AYER RUBINS</page><page sequence="3">A NEW INTERPRETATION OF JUPITER ELICIUS (( Cut off a head ,, Jupiter said. The king answered, ((We will obey. An onion must be cut, dug from my garden )). The god added, ((A man's )). Numa said, ((Thou wilt get the hair). The god demanded a life, and in answer Numa said, ((Of a fish ). Jupiter laughed, and said, ((See to it that you expiate my bolts by these means, O man not to be kept from conversation with the gods ,,. A much simpler explanation of the effort to learn methods of expiation of lightning occurs in LIVY. Here there is no supernatural element introduced, but the simple state- ment that Numa built an altar to Jupiter Elicius in order to draw forth the needed infor- mation. 2 LIVY again refers to Jupiter Elicius in connection with Tullus Hostilius' change of heart towards religion. The story is told that in the commentaries of Numa, Tullus found certain secret sacrifices made to Jupiter Elicius, but he failed in the ceremony and was killed by lightning. 3 These are the only passages which actually name Jupiter Elicius. Episodes which are mentioned here, however, appear in other authors, with no reference made to Jupiter Elicius. The power of evoking lightning is discussed further by PLINY himself and by SERVIUS, and PLUTARCH and ARNOBIUS relate the conversation of Numa with Jupiter, as told by OVID. In a later book of the Naturalis Historia, 4 PLINY mentions the evocation of lightning and refers the reader to his previous discussion. He uses the word elicere, and again quotes L. PIso for the story about Tullius Hostilius. Here, however, no actual mention is made of Jupiter Elicius. SERVIUS 5 also discussed the power of evoking lightning, although he gives no hint of a relation to Jupiter Elicius. Prometheus 1OVID, Fasti, iii, 339-344: (caede caput , dixit: cui rex ((parebimus ), inquit (( caedenda est hortis eruta caepa meis. ) addidit hic ( hominis ): ( sumes ( ait ille ((capillos. ) postulat hic animam, cui Numa (( piscis ) ait. risit et ( his)) inquit ((facito mea tela procures, o vir conloquio non abigende deum. ) 2 LIVY, i, 20, 7:.... quaeque prodigia fulminibus aliove quo visu missa susciperentur atque curarentur. ad ea elicienda ex mentibus divinis lovi Elicio aram in Aventino dicavit deumque consuluit auguriis, quae suscipienda essent. 3 LIVY, i, 31, 8: ipsum regem tradunt volventem com- mentarios Numae, cum ibi quaedam occulta sollemnia sacri- ficia lovi Elicio facta invenisset, operatum iis sacris se ab- didisse; sed non rite initum aut curatum id sacrum esse, nec solum nullam ei oblatam caelestium speciem, sed ira lovis sollicitati prava religione fulmine ictum cum domo conflagrasse. had discovered the method of calling forth 4 PLINY, N.H., xxviii, 13 f.: Prisci quidem nostri per- petuo talia credidere (al. prodidere), difficillimumque ex his, etiam fulmina elici, ut suo loco docuimus.

But afterwards it proved their own destruction, as witness Tullus Hostilius, who was burned by the lightning. Numa Pompilius, however, had used it without ill effect, but only in the sacred rites of the gods (tantum in sacris deorum). This use of the lightning for religious purposes SERVIUS extends further in explaining that the ancestors did not light the altars, but drew down divine fire by their prayers. In both of these passages SERVIUS uses the verb elicere, but does not refer to Jupiter Elicius. PLINY quotes the story of Tullus Hostilius from L. PIso: SERVIUS from LIVY. The same story as told by Ovid appears in its essential outlines in PLUTARCH and AR- NOBIUS, but neither author mentions Jupiter Elicius. ARNOBIUS 2 quotes VALERIUS ANTIAS as the source of the tale, and he uses the story to show Jupiter as (( dull and stupid, mocked by ambiguous words ,. In the version of ARNOBIUS, Picus and Faunus teach Numa the methods of drawing forth Jupiter, but again for the express purpose of gaining knowledge of the expiation of lightning. (( Since Numa did not possess the science of expiating lightning and was desirous of knowing, he followed the advice of Egeria to trick Picus and Faunus.... And after they had been bound, immediately they taught Numa with what methods and sacrifices Jupiter could be drawn forth. When he had received this knowledge, Numa made a sacrifice on the Aventine, drew down Jupiter to earth and sought the manner of ritual of expiation ). Then follows the same ambiguous dialogue as found in OVID'S ac- count. ARNOBIUS calls this talis fabula. In his life of Numa, 3 PLUTARCH gives alternative versions of the legend: either Picus and Faunus themselves taught Numa the charm against thunder and lightning, or they called Jupiter forth by magic4 and he spoke in person to Numa. PLUTARCH believes the story incredible. ((Nothing can be so strange as what is told about (Numa's) conver- sation with Jupiter)); and PLUTARCH ends: ((these stories, fabulous and ridiculous as they are, show us the attitude which men of that time, from force of custom, took towards the gods )). In these accounts, we find that OVID, ARNOBIUS and PLUTARCH are telling the same myth, characterized as fabula or an incredible story and coming from VALERIUS ANTIAS. Here is an obvious case of an aetiological myth, to explain the primitive expiation for lightning, 1 SERV., Aen., xii, 200:.... vel certe, quia apud maiores Juppiter posset et sacrificiis elici; et accepta regem scientia arae non incendebantur, sed ignem divinum precibus elicie- rem in Aventino fecisse divinam elexisse ad terras Iovem bant, qui incendebat altaria. ab eoque quaesisse fulguritum procurationis morem. lovem 2 ARNOBIUS, v, 1 : In secundo Antiatis libro.... talis diu cunctatum ( expiabis ) dixe ( capite fulgurita.... quoniam perscripta est fabula: Numam illum regem, cum procurandi me tamen tua circumvenit astutia, quem voluisti, habeto fulminis scientiam non haberet essetque illi cupido noscendi, morem et his rebus, quas pactus es, procurationem semper Egeriae monitu castos duodecim iuvenes apud aquam celasse suscipies fulguritorum. ) cum vinculis, ut cum Faunus et Martius Picus ad id locorum3 PLUT., Numa, 15 (transl. by Bernardotte Perrin, venissent haustum - nam illis aquandi sollemne iter huc Loeb.

MARION AYER RUBINS 88</page><page sequence="5">A NEW INTERPRETATION OF JUPITER ELICIUS which PLUTARCH states was still practiced in his day, with onions, hair and sprats. Accord- ing to these authors, Jupiter himself was drawn down from the sky, but the term Elicius cannot answer to that definition. Elicius expresses an active idea: the god who elicits, not the god who is elicited. 2 There exist the following cult titles of Jupiter, exclusive of those merely formed from place names, with the ending ius: Elicius, Feretrius, Fidius, Jurarius, Lucetius, Pluvius. 3 These all attribute to Jupiter a quality as an actor. For instance, Feretrius is defined by FESTUS 4 a ferendo, quod pacem ferre putaretur; and even though we do not accept the definition as the most fundamental, we must agree that an actor is denoted. Lucetius, likewise, points to Jupiter as an active agent. ( They called Jupiter Lucetius, because they believed him to be the cause of light ). 5 Like FESTUS' derivation of Feretrius a ferendo, VARRO derives Elicius ab eliciendo. Note that both the verbal forms thus used in interpretation are gerunds, not gerundives, and are therefore active, not passive. To reiterate, Jupiter Elicius is the Elicitor, not the Elicited. PLINY and LIVY both refer to the story of Tullus Hostilius and his death by lightning, and PLINY cites L. PISO as the source. PLINY tells us that Numa had summoned down lightning often, but that Tullus, imitating him ( too little according to rite ), was struck by the lightning. As opposed to this, LIVY does not say either that Numa drew down the lightning, or that Tullus was attempting to do so; all that he states is that Tullus was practicing secret rites begun by Numa in honor of Jupiter Elicius, and because he failed in ritual he was killed. VARRO does not mention Numa in connection with Jupiter Elicius, but the context of the passage shows that he believed in the antiquity of the cult. For several paragraphs, VARRO has been collecting evidence on the meaning of the word inlicium. 6 He quotes from the Tabulae Censoriae and from the Commentarii Consulares where the word inlicium is an ancient equivalent for contio, 7 and then goes on to draw other parallels, quoting from the tragedy Proserpina and from the Hermiona of PACUVIUs, and adds (thus an altar of Jupiter Elicius on the Aventine, from eliciting,. 8 It seems to me that we are justified PLUT., Numa, 15, 4: xal TOv E'l To xeQavvoT; tEx6iLdSat xaOaQLuov, 0s otelTrai jIuEXQi vVv biad XQOIVtwV xal TQxlCoV xat ,tuavi6cov. 2 Elicius is defined in FORCELLINI, Totius Latinitatis Lex., S.V., as follows: Elicius. Verbale ab elicio, adhi- bitum fere tanquam cognomen lovis, ita dicti quod eum caelo Numae rogatu Picus et Faunus quadam die elicuere, ut doceret ritum piandi fulminis. In the same work: Elicio.

Elicere fulmina est precibus et sacris quibusdam impetrare, ut caelo decidant. WALDE does not define elicius in either the first or second edition of his Lateinisches Etymologisches Wdor terbuch ; the 3d. ed. has not reached this word (May 1931). FESTUS, 66 L. gives as a synomym for electabo the form eliciam. In LEWIS and SHORT, A New Latin Dic- tionary, electo is defined as a Plautine word, a frequenta- tive of elicio, meaning to get out artfully, to worm out a secret. 3 This list is taken from the index to WISSOWA, Re- ligion und Kultus der Romer, 2.

' Returning to his subject, inlicium, his next words are hoc nunc aliter fit atque olim, and he explains the changes in procedure. To summarize this evidence: there was a god Jupiter Elicius to whom an altar was dedicated on the Aventine. The purpose of the god, however, is not at all clear. He appears as a god of the lightning in PLINY; as a god of lightning expiation in OVID; perhaps as a god of lightning expiation and interpretation in LIVY. Two questions occur: can the name Jupiter Elicius be interpreted as a god of lightning; was the science of lightning expiation and interpretation native to the Romans or an introduction from Etruria? The primitive Roman farmer or shepherd must have observed the lightning and have had a natural amount of respect for it. One of the earliest cult titles of Jupiter which tradition gives us is that of Feretrius, 2 Jupiter the Smiter, a recognition of the vivid impres- sion of the lightning. 3 There are some customs in Roman life which must date back to an early sense of awe for lightning: a place struck by lightning was considered religiosus;4 the lightning itself was buried ; a tree struck by lightning was called fanatica;6 a special offering must be made in expiation ;7 the body of a man killed by lightning must be treated in a special manner, 8 or left untouched. 9 These customs are the natural reactions of simple people: lightning does harm to something, which must thereafter be avoided. There seems, however, to be no trace in strictly Roman belief of an effort to interpret lightning or to expiate it by elaborate methods. That was the contribution of Etruscan religion. The science of divination, native to the Romans, was augury, the interpretation of omens particularly by birds. 10 This was an interpretation not for what the future por- tended but to discover the will of the gods for the present. " Although FESTUS lists first signs from heaven,2 i. e., thunder and lightning, 13 as observed by the augurs, we have no 1 There is no verb in the sentence to show whether the altar was still in existence in Varro's own time. 2 LIVY, i, 10, 6; DION. HAL., ii, 34, 4; cf. FESTUS, 82 L.: fulgere prisci pro ferire dicebant, unde fulgus dictum est. 3 In historical times, however, Jupiter Feretrius was not regarded as a god of lightning, but as the god to whom were specially dedicated the spolia opima.

The burial of lightning seems from the evidence to be possibly an Etruscan rite, rather than an original Roman one. The scholia to PERSIUS, ii, 26 speak of the custom of bringing augurs and haruspices from Etruria to bury the lightning. Cf. LUCAN, i, 584-587, 606-609; CELL., N.A., iv, 5, 2.

The weight of evidence emphasizes the belief of the Romans in the superiority of the Etruscans in knowledge of lightning, and in Rome's dependence on them. 1 They looked to the Etruscan haruspices for information as to the proper expiation and ( procuration )) of all portents. 2 The Etruscan haruspices were skilled especially in three types of divination, exta, fulgura, portenta, 3 against which is contrasted the preeminently Roman type, augury. 4 SENECA in his Naturales Quaestiones devotes a whole book to a discussion of lightning. He writes from the point of view of a philosopher, but there are occasional moments when he forgets the teachings of the Greeks and mentions facts about Italy. ( Lightning foretells the future in signs clearer than if written. There is this difference between us and the Tuscans, who have the greatest skill in dealing with lightning.... These beliefs are common to the Etruscans and to the philosophers. In this point they disagree, for the Etruscans say the lightnings are sent by Jupiter and they assign to them three types.... In these matters.... antiquity is wrong. For what is so foolish as to believe that Jupiter sends the lightning from the clouds?.... ))5 I have quoted this passage to show that by ((antiquity)) SENECA does not mean the Romans, but has in mind particularly the Etruscans. The Etruscans had evolved an elaborate system of expiating the appearance of lightning, based on their sixteenfold division of the templum of the sky, 6 and on their belief that there were nine gods who hurled the lightning. 7 Did the Etruscans likewise believe in the evocation of lightning? The point is enigmatical, 8 but bears on the interpretation of Jupiter Elicius. The only evidence that exists of such a power in Etruria in ancient times is PLINY'S report of an ancient myth, when Porsena had summoned lightning to kill the 1 Cic., de Div., i, 35; i, 92; ii, 80; DION.

The statement in DION., Hal., ii, 5 seems to contradict these passages: ((The Romans believe that lightning going from left to right is favorable, either because they take it from the Etruscans or because it was the instruction of their fathers.... and as certain authors report, in the early times before the science of the Etruscans, the ancestors of the Romans considered lightning appearing on the left as favorable.)) But Dionysius is none too certain of his authorities here: he gives a choice of reasons for the belief in favorable direction, and for the ancient Roman origin he uses Or; &amp;5 TtVye; (oca0QOvot to explain a cult of lightning which was usually assigned to the Etruscans. OVID also indicates that lightning was accepted as an augury in Romulus' time, but there are many anachro- nisms in OVID: Fasti, iv, 833-835. 2 CIC., de Harusp.

But there is no motive assigned for the evocation of lightning in Rome. We have seen that the Romans recog- nized lightning as a phenomenon, but one certainly to be feared and not to be summoned. In the same passage with the report of the myth of the evocation of lightning by Porsena in Etruria, PLINY mentions the evocation as practiced by Numa and Tullus Hostilius, but no explanation nor reason for their so doing is given. PLINY refers again to the evocation of lightning in Rome, without reference to the practice in Etruria, but says specifically that of all the strange convictions of our ancestors, this is the most difficult to believe. 3 He then quotes the story from L. PIso about the death of Tullus Hostilius. SERVIUS too men- tions the evocation of lightning, 4 as introduced by Prometheus and followed by Numa and Tullus Hostilius. PLINY hints at a connection with Jupiter Elicius, but SERVIUS does not mention the god. It seem to me that there is in these authors a confusion with a possible practice in ancient Etruria, a practice only legendary, or with a Greek myth, and a wish to ascribe equally mysterious powers to the kings of Rome. PLINY himself puts no cre- dence in the legend, an indication that there was no belief in his own day in the evocation of lightning. On the ground that there is no evidence for an original Roman belief in the evocation of lightning, apart from Etruscan or Greek myths, there seems to be no basis for a theory that Jupiter Elicius was the cult name for a god evoked from the sky in the guise of lightning. Was he the god of lightning expiation and interpretation? The ancient authors seem to agree that Jupiter Elicius was a god of dim antiquity. But the weight of evidence is that the science of lightning interpretation was Etruscan, not Roman, and that the Romans either derived their information from the Etruscans or employed Etruscan haruspices. Therefore Jupiter Elicius is not the god who guides the expiation or inter- pretation of lightning. Was he the god of lightning? Several cult names of a god of lightning existed in Rome, Jupiter Feretrius, 5 Summanus, 6 Jupiter Fulgor, 7 Jupiter Fulgurator, 8 Jupiter Fulmen. 9 These are obvious names. But Elicius means ((the one who draws forth ), which gives 1 PLINY, N.H., ii, 140.

Thunder and lightning were to be feared. No people would clothe them in a colorless name. Several prominent scholars 2 in the field of Roman religion see in the cult of Jupiter Elicius no connection whatsoever with lightning. They link his worship with the ceremony of the aquaelicium and the lapis manalis, and believe that Jupiter Elicius was a rain god invoked in time of drought. Certainly there is a striking parallel in the terms aquaelicium and elicius. 3 FESTUS gives two meanings to the lapis manalis, 4 the second of which fits the theory here discussed. ((They also called manalis lapis a certain stone which was outside the Porta Capena next to the temple of Mars. When they moved it into the city, on account of great drought, rain followed immediately and because it shed (manare) water, they called it manalis lapis ,. He defines aquaelicium5 as occurring ((when rain water is elicited by certain charms, as formerly, if one may trust the story, when the manalis lapis was carried into the city )). Quoting from VARRO, de Vita Populi Romani, lib. i, NONIUS 6 defines urceolum as a ewer for water, aquae manale, whence manalis lapis is named in the rites of the pontiffs, the stone which is moved when rain is prayed for. SERVIUS, 7 too, mentions the pontiffs in his explanation: ( lapis manalis which the pontiffs used to draw, as often as there was drought ). These references emphasize the antiquity of this rite. FESTUS says (( as formerly)) (ut quondam), 8 and VARRO, quoted by NONIUS, refers the usage back to a great age (apud The quotation from VARRO, however, is in the present tense, indicating 1 Occasionally the Romans did not wish to name a god: cf. SERV., Aen., ii, 351. Here the Romans wished to conceal the name of the patron god of Rome. Because they were uncertain of the cause of earthquake, they likewise did not name the god to whom the expiatory sacrifice was made: GELLIUS, N.A., ii, 28. But no motive, either of protection or uncertainty, would lead them to conceal the name of a god of lightning. 2 AUST, WISSOWA, CARTER, MERLIN, THULIN, and on second thoughts, WARDE FOWLER. 3 Thesaurus Linguae Latinae: aquaelicium, .... ab aqua et lacio, -ere derivatum. The derivation of elicius has not yet been published in the Thesaurus, but FOR- CELLINI derives it from elicio, a compound of e and lacio. WALDE does not define. The effort to connect the two by identity of place is not successful. Jupiter Elicius had an altar on the Aventine: the lapis manalis, used in the aquaelicium, was kept outside the Porta Capena, and scholars who try to associate the Porta Capena with the Aventine forget that it could more easily be considered in the vicinity of the Caelian Hill or the Circus Maximus. The Porta Capena in historical times was considered in Region I and given no special relation to any hill. 4 FESTUS, 115 L.: Manalem lapidem putabant esse ostium Orci, per quod animae inferorum ad superos mana- rent, qui dicuntur manes.

There is no mention of any god worshipped, but the ceremony was under the guidance of the pontiffs. In the time of the Empire, PETRONIUS recounts a ceremony formerly used to put an end to drought. A guest at Trimalchio's dinner complains that ((no one believes in heaven any longer, no one keeps the fast day, no one considers Jupiter as amounting to anything. Before this, matrons used to go with bare feet to the Clivus with hair dishev- elled, with pure minds, and used to pray to Jupiter for rain. And so right away it rained pitchersful ; either then or never; and they all used to laugh, although wet as mice )). Whether PETRONIUS intended to describe a ceremony at Rome or not is a disputed question.2 Towns other than Rome had a clivus, just as they had a Capitolium and Forum. But whether at Rome or in Campania, the ceremony was evidently out of date at the time PETRONIUS was writing. He uses the imperfect tense, and specifically says antea. So it is rather strange to find reference to a rain ceremony, similar in many details, as existing years later. TERTULLIAN 3 summarizes the attitude of the pagans in time of drought: (( you offer aquilicia to Jupiter, you announce nudipedalia to the populace, you beseech the sky on the Capitolium, you look for rain-clouds from the ceilings, wholly turned away from God himself and Heaven ). In a later work he again gives details 4 : ( when there is drought, nudipetalia are announced, the magistrates lay aside their purple, they reverse their fasces, they utter a prayer and sacrifice a victim ). TERTULLIAN is apparently using terms which are familiar in his own day, referring to customs still in existence. The nudipedalia are reminiscent of the account in PETRONIUS, which treated the ceremony as of a former period. He also mentions the aquilicia, which I see no reason to doubt as the aquplural of the aquae- licium defined by FESTUS. But there is no necessity for concluding that all the details of both ceremonies should be united and applied to the rite of moving the lapis manalis at Rome. 5 Likewise there is no necessity for concluding that Jupiter Elicius is connected with the aquaelicium and the lapis manalis. The similarity of words is striking. But in no passage concerning aquaelicium or lapis manalis does the name of Jupiter Elicius occur. 1 PETR., 44: nemo enim caelum caelum putat, nemo laquearibus exspectatis, aversi ab ipso et deo et caelo. ieiunium servat, nemo lovem pili facit, sed omnes opertis 4 TERT., de leiunio, 16: cum stupet caelum et aret oculis bona sua computant. antea stolatae ibant nudis annus, nudipedalia denuntiantur, magistratus purpuras pedibus in clivum, passis capillis, mentibus puris, et lovem ponunt, fasces retro avertunt, precem indigitant, hostiam aquam exorabant. itaque statim urceatim plovebat: aut tunc instaurant. aut numquam; et omnes ridebant, udi tanquam mures. 5 Several of the articles in the handbooks link up all 2 MORGAN, op. cit., 100 f.

I think it much more likely that VERRIUS FLACCUS knew of no relation of the lapis manalis to Jupiter Elicius. The fact that a writer of the early Empire did not recognize an association between Ju- piter Elicius and a very old rite does not, of course, destroy the possibility of an earlier connection. There seems to be no cult of Jupiter as a rain god, however, until a late period. 3 APULEIUS lists titles of Jupiter as a weather god: 4 fulgurator et tonitrualis et fulminator, etiam imbricitor et item dicitur serenator. But these epithets seem rather to indicate the functions of Jupiter than to be cult titles, and APULEIUS does not mention the word elicius. No evidence appears that the primitive Roman approached Jupiter as a god of rain: in time of drought, when he needed water for his fields, he went to a place where water was. SERVIUS tells us that a sacrifice is made to the fountain of Juturna when there is a drought. 5 M. H. MORGAN suggests the probability that ((both Greeks and Romans were in the habit of praying to the divinities of the well-springs, fountains, and sources of streams, and of the streams themselves, rather than to Zeus or Jupiter or any other god for rain ,,. 6 The references regarding aquaelicium or use of the lapis manalis whch go back to Republican or Augustan sources 7 give no relation to any god: the ceremony was evidently what we call today ((sympathetic magic )), the summoning of rain by suggestion. In addition to the absence of any positive worship of Jupiter as a rain god, the uncer- tainty of opinion on the association of the aquaelicium with the cult of Jupiter Elicius precludes the acceptance of this ingenious theory. WISSOWA, 8 AUST, 9 CARTER 10 and MERLIN 1 accept the theory unreservedly. SAMTER, 12 just as unreservedly, rejects it. WARDE FOWLER at first rejected the theory.... : ((the Jupiter Elicius wth whom it is 1 This is not a strong argument per se, for there are not many words beginning with E in Festus, and possibly some may have been lost. 2 FESTUS, 81 L.: Feretrius Juppiter dictus a ferendo, quod pacem ferre putaretur; ex cuius templo sumebant sceptrum, per quod iurarent, et lapidem silicem, quo foedus ferirent.

((The Jupiter Elicius of the Aventine had nothing to do with lightning: he took his cult title from the rite of aquaelicium: but as soon as the Romans began to interest themselves in the Etruscan lightning-lore.... they perverted the meaning of the epithet to suit their new studies ,. 2 The article on Jupiter by PERDRIZET in DAREMBERG et SAGLIO identifies Jupiter Elicius with the aquaelicium as a rain god, but the account under (( Aquaelicium )) makes two distinct rituals, one to Jupiter, without assigning any epithet, based on FESTUS, TERTULLIAN and PE- TRONIUS, and a second to Mars, associated with lapis manalis, based on FESTUS, SERVIUS and NONIUS. In sympathy with this second point of view is an article by HOFFMANN, ((Das Aquilicium 3. 3 Because the lapis manalis was next to the shrine of Mars, the stone is sacred to him and has no connection with Jupiter Elicius. Lapis manalis is derived from the Manes and has to do with reconciliation of the spirits of the dead. Hoffmann bases his argument on the first definition of FESTUS : ((they thought the lapis manalis was the mouth of Orcus, through which the spirits of the lower world, called manes, slipped to the gods of the upper world ). 4 The difficulty of deciding which theory fits Jupiter Elicius is illustrated by statements in the commentaries on the passage in OVID'S Fasti. FRAZER says, (( However, the adjective Elicius perhaps refers rather to the rain than to the lightning that was to be elicited from the clouds )). 5 CYRIL BAILEY gives a similar impartial view: ((The ancient authorities connected this title with the practice of Etruscan augurs of 'eliciting' the thunderbolt, and Ovid seems to lean to this view in connecting the legendary origin of the title so closely with the thunderbolt.... But the idea seems to be foreign to genuine Roman religious notions, and it is more probable that we should look for an explanation to the very old rite of the aquae- licium, used in time of great drought to procure rain.... It must, however, be remembered that Juppiter Elicius is never actually mentioned in connection with the aquaelicium ). 6 The evidence against Jupiter Elicius being a god associated with lightning has been given above, pages 90-93, while the difficulty in considering him a god of rain7 was treated on pages 93-96. 1 WARDE FOWLER, Roman Festivals of the Republic, Jupiter Elicius as the god who elicits the flashing light- London 1908, 233. ning and the rain. 2 WARDE FOWLER, Rel.

The name Elicius means (( Caller-forth )), ((Elicitor ,), ((Summoner )). What was the object which Jupiter drew forth and gave to the Roman people ? If we examine the context of the passages which mention Jupiter Elicius we are struck by the emphasis on religious ritual. LIVY assigns to Numa the interest in religious observance which has become almost synonymous with his name, and we read :2 He then turned his attention to the appointing of priests.... a flamen for Jupiter.... one for Mars, another for Quirinus.... he chose maidens for Vesta.... likewise twelve Salii for Mars Gradivus.... Then he appointed a pontifex.... To him he intrusted all the rites of worship, written out and recorded with what victims, on what days, at what temples sacrifices should be made and from what sources money should be demanded for these expenses. And all other public and private sacrifices he also made subject to the decrees of the pontifex, that there might be some one to whom the plebs could come for advice, lest, by neglecting the rites of the fathers and adopting foreign ones, there might be any disturbance of the religious law, and in order that the pontifex might likewise teach not only ceremonies for the gods in heaven, but also proper funeral rites and means of placating the spirits of the dead, and that he might teach what prodigies sent by lightning or some other appearance were to be considered and guarded against. To elicit these matters from the minds of the gods, Numa dedicated an altar on the Aven- tine to Jupiter Elicius, and consulted the god by augury to determine which should be undertaken)). .... Pontificem deinde.... legit, eique sacra omnia exscripta exsignataque attribuit.... Cetera quoque omnia publica privataque sacra pontificis scitis subiecit, ut esset quo consultum plebes veniret, ne quid divini iuris neglegendo patrios ritus peregrinosque adsciscendo turbaretur; nec caelestes modo caerimonias, sed iusta quoque funebria placandosque manes ut idem pontifex edoceret, quaeque prodigia fulminibus aliove quo ea elicienda ex mentibus divinis lovi Elicio aram quae suscipienda essent. 1There is still another explanation of the meaning of Elicius. The account in PLUTARCH gives a hint (Numa, 15). Jupiter had been very angry at being summoned down to earth, but after the amusing conversation with Numa, returns to heaven gracious, 2eoe;. This term is used to explain the statement that thereafter the place was called tlitov. But a Greek word with a smooth breathing is not derived from one with a rough breathing. It is quite evident that PLUTARCH is reproducing in Greek a Latin term. He does not make it masculine, however, or ascribe it to Jupiter, but to the place, that is, the Aventine. If we transliterate into Latin, we have ilicium. This might be related to iliceus, ((belonging to the ilex tree ), and at first this seemed to me to be a cult title for Jupiter which dated far back. Then a series of visu missa susciperentur atque curarentur. Ad in Aventino dicavit deumque consuluit auguris, articles by A. B. COOK were found in Class. Rev., xvii, xviii, 1903, 1904. He had seized with triumph on this interpretation as upholding his theory of the Oak God. After cautiously stating that PLUTARCH'S t' ixov might presuppose a title Ilicius as well as Elicius (Class. Rev., xvii, 1903, 270) he stated in a following article that Elicius is also spelt Ilicius (Class. Rev., xviii, 365). I now believe that PLUTARCH made use of the passage in VARRO, L.L., vi, 94 f., where, in the middle of an expla- nation of inlicium, VARRO quite unexpectedly introduces the name Jupiter Elicius. VARRO himself probably spelt the word illicium. PLUTARCH confused the Latin terms, and instead of using Elicius as applied to Jupiter, used illicium as applied to the place, the Aventine Hill. 2 LIVY, i, 20.  97</page><page sequence="14">98 MARION AYER RUBINS Numa is concerned that the pontifex, the head of the new state priesthoods just orga- nized, should make clear to the Romans what their official conduct should be, not only in strictly religious matters, but in proper funeral services, in the appeasing of the Manes, and in the face of prodigies, appearing either by lightning or some other means. Note the words that precede ad ea elicienda. It is possible to interpret the neuter plural ea as referring only to prodigia, but even so that includes not only lightning but also other manifestations. However, why confine the ea to prodigia? Considering that the sen- tence reads nec.... modo, sed.... quoque.... que, it is much more reasonable to consider that LIVY has written an all-inclusive demonstrative. And I think this is further indicated by the conclusion of the sentence: Numa dedicated an altar on the Aventine to draw forth ((these things)) from the minds of the gods, and consulted the god by means of auguries to determine divine approval of what ((things)) were to be accepted. Here, then, we have one god, Jupiter Elicius, to act as intermediary between the gods (divinis mentibus) and men. During the reign of Tullus Hostilius, the legendary king who follows Numa, there came a rain of stones on the Alban Mount, ' accompanied by a voice apparently issuing from the mountain, advising the Albans to carry on their religious rites as their fathers had done, patrio ritu. The Romans made an expiation for this prodigium, and the noven- diale sacrum remained the proper ritual for such a rain of stones. 2 But a pestilence followed and even the king fell ill. Then he made a complete change of front, and from a warlike king became the most superstitious and the most religious. The story was current that Tullus studied the books of Numa wherein he found certain secret sacrifices to Jupiter Elicius and busied himself in trying them out. But he got no results and was killed by lightning. Why? Because he was trying to draw down the lightning? Not at all. ((The sacrifice was neither begun nor attended with due ritual, and not only did no appearance in the sky become manifest to him, but he was struck by the lightning of Jupiter, who was roused to wrath by the improper ceremony, and he was burned with his household ,. sed non rite initum aut curatum id sacrum esse, nec solum nullam ei oblatam caelestium speciem sed ira lovis sollicitati prava religione fulmine ictum cum domo conflagrasse. There was a religious scruple involved here, and a very satisfactory retribution in the anger of Jupiter at the prava religio of the king, who had not carried out sacrifices with due ritual. Previous to his account of the meeting of Jupiter Elicius and Numa, OVID summarizes the traditional function of Numa. 3 (( At first the Quirites were too ready to take up arms : Numa resolved to soften them by force of law and fear of gods. Hence laws were made... 1 LivY, i, 31. maioribus expiata. 2 Cf. LIVY, xxx, 38, 9: in Palatio lapidibus pluit. 3 OVID, Fasti, iii, 277-282.

Savagery was put aside, justice was more powerful than arms, and it was a shameful thing to fight against a citizen ). This of course is a glorified picture, but the important element for our discussion is the phrase tradita sacra. There is emphasis on a traditional, accepted, not-to-be-changed system of ritual. PLUTARCH also emphasizes this importance of permanent form. (( The chief of the Pontifices, the Pontifex Maximus, had the duty of expounding and interpreting the divine will, or rather of directing sacred rites, not only being in charge of public ceremonies, but also watching over private sacrifices and preventing any departure from established custom, as well as teaching whatever was requisite for the worship or propitiation of the gods )). Because PLINY 2 uses the story of the death of Tullus Hostilius to illustrate the reported ancient belief in evoking lightning, he is usually cited to prove Jupiter Elicius as a god of lightning. But as in LIVY, the emphasis is on Tullus' failure to conform to proper ritual, and Jupiter's anger at the imitatum parum rite. We have here the idea of a god who is displeased at improper rite, because he has himself specified what he desired. I believe that Elicius is the epithet to indicate the ((drawing forth )) of rules, of religious practices which formed the ( custom of the ancestors ). Ancestral custom was a vivid feature of Roman religion. There was a sharp differen- tiation between the ius divinum and the ius humanum, 3 and the basis of the ius divinum rested on the mos maiorum. The Romans placed enormous emphasis on proper rites and ritual. These rites were ancient, having been established as fundamental elements of the relation of a Roman to his gods. Witness LIVY'S emphasis on the early establishment of ritual, 4 and VIRGIL'S constant reference to formalism. CATO quotes the formulae before harvesting certain crops 5 or thinning a wood, or digging, or lustrating the fields before plowing. The farmer must perform the sacrifice in the established way, Romano more, and there are provisions made if he fails. GELLIUS characterizes the Romans as castissimi cautissimique in establishing rites and in regard for the gods. 6 The various types of set formulae and prayers are discussed by PLINY. 7 The statement of GELLIUS that certain comprecationes are done in the Roman manner, ritu Romano, 8 is significant, because it marks these as independent of Greek influence.

But it is very easy to under- stand how just this insistence on ordered method would appeal to the legal mind of the Roman. 1 The Roman respect for established ritual is preserved for us by Cicero. Recurring through his ideal code of religious law, we find: (They shall preserve the rites of the family and the ancestors . (They shall perform the established rites ,. (They shall preserve the best of the ancestral rites . ((The sacred rites of families shall remain forever ,, 2 Quintus Cicero remarks that Marcus' religious system does not differ much from the laws of Numa and Roman customs, to which Marcus rejoins that Rome's early state was the best in the world, and such suggestions as he has made which do not appear in the state would still be found in the customs of their ancestors. 3 The exposition of his meaning is significant: to preserve the ritual of the family and ancestors is to guard the religio, the religious rites which have, as it were, been handed down from the gods them- selves, since ancient times were closest to the gods. 4 Roman tradition assigned the early organization of the state religion to Numa.5 But whence did he obtain his information and knowledge of ritual? We can imagine a conviction that the source of such information was divine, and not human, for we find the myth of Egeria, the goddess who advised and instructed Numa. ST. AUGUSTINE denies any divine origin for the laws of Rome, 6 and particularly for those given by Numa, but by that very negation, indicates that there existed a belief in such a divine origin.7 To return to Cicero's explanation of preserving the ritual of the family and ancestors, we see that he hints at a heavenly origin. Before the state religion developed, the primi- tive Roman had already formed a concept of a source for his ritual. The idea of this source took shape and in the state religion was dignified by a definite epithet, Elicius, which was given to the chief divinity, Jupiter. The great body of religious ceremonial was so formal and so exacting that it seems natural for the Romans to imagine a special definition from the gods themselves as the basis of the ius divinum. Then as time passed, the ritual remained unchanged, but ideas of the gods were profoundly altered and new 1 WARDE FOWLER, Rel.

The meaning of Jupiter Elicius likewise was forgotten, and writers of a later period had no clear conception of his function. The Romans recognized the dim antiquity of the origins of their national religious practices. ((Shall I swear by Jupiter Lapis according to the most ancient Roman rite ? asks APULEIUS. (( Those sacred rites are called municipalia which they have preserved from the very beginning before the establishment of the Roman state: the pontifices wished the people to observe these and to perform them in the same fashion that was customary from antiquity ,,.2 ((Custom is the institution of the fathers : that is, the tradition of the an- cients concerned especially with rites and ceremonies of the past . 3 There was compre- hension of the period before the establishment of the state, as is illustrated by the phrase ante civitatem Romanam acceptam in the passage from FESTUS. The Romans recognized that the life of this period was agricultural and pastoral. ((That augural science of Romulus was pastoral, not urban, nor was it fashioned according to the opinions of the ignorant, but it was received by chosen men and handed down to posterity ). 4 Just as they assigned the organization of the state religion to Numa, the Romans ascribed the first steps of worship to Faunus. ((He was the first to make sacred to chosen numina places and buildings and groves. But he himself is believed to have been received into the number of the gods, and so his oracle is in Albunea. However, there are thought to be a number of Fauns, actually present too. At least that is the belief of the rustic people who dwell in that part of Italy which is suburbana, that they are often seen in the fields ). There had been ancient beliefs, which still persisted among the countly people. The city Roman had forgotten them, but his ancestors had held the same beliefs. This trace of a primitive rustic religion may explain the position of the altar dedicated to Jupiter Elicius. The Aventine Hill was outside the pomerium until the time of Claudius, 6 that is, it was excluded by the religious barrier from an active share in the civil life. There- fore, it has been difficult to explain why there should be a cult of Jupiter on that hill, which was chiefly devoted to foreign deities. Originally the Aventine Hill was an agricultural centre. There is a tradition of rustic deities, of the worship there of Bona Dea, Picus and Faunus, Fons, Ceres, Consus and Laverna. 7 The very name of the hill indicates an agricultural life: it has been given an eponymous hero, Aventinus, variously considered a king of the Albans or of the Aborigines, that is, of the original rustic stock; or the name is 1APUL., de Deo Socr., v, 132: iurabo per lovem la- id est memoria veterum pertinens maxime ad religiones pidem Romano vetustissimo ritu?

The early groping toward a spirit to sanction forms and ritual, to explain and make clear the methods of worship gave rise to a numen of this function, who was worshipped on the Aventine, by an agricultural and pastoral community. This numen was recognized in the state religion by the name and epithet, Jupiter Elicius. The ritual and ceremonies were accepted, but the origin of rites was no longer vital, and Jupiter ((Elicius)) became obscure. We cannot possibly determine all the reasons for the location of the cult on the Aventine, but the grove of Egeria was not far distant, and its location may have been, in part at least, responsible for the preference for this hill. Jupiter Elicius apparently was a god who had no vital share in the religion of the Roman state. He is mentioned only infrequently, and then with an uncertain reference to being drawn forth, or drawing forth lightning, or drawing forth information for lightning expiation. There is emphasis on the etymological association of his name and function, and I believe that the real explanation of his function is given by LIVY, who ascribes to him the drawing forth of rules and ritual from the gods. The primitive Roman had ima- gined a divine origin for the rites and ritual with which he must worship all the numina of his religion. The developed Roman state accepted the rites and ritual, but forgot the numen who was regarded as having formulated them. Jupiter Elicius is the god through whom man could ((draw forth ) from heaven knowledge of his all-important ritual. Jupiter Elicius is an intermediary between man and all the other gods, whose conflicting wishes rendered this service of supreme importance, especially at the beginning of Roman religion, that is, in the days of the organization of ritual, or in the period of Numa. That the conno- tation of the epithet later was obscured, when ritual had become fully established, is not in the least surprising. 1VARRO, L.
