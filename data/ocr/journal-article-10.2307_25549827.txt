<plain_text><page sequence="1">52 Diarmait Mac Murchada and Romanesque Leinster: four twelfth-century churches in context Tadhg O'Keeffe, Member The history and archaeology of four ecclesiastical foundations associated with Diarmait Mac Murchada, the twelfth-century king of Leinster, are discussed in this paper, and their context in the architectural traditions of south-eastern Ireland is assessed. Historical records reveal considerably more about those who provided the patronage for works of architecture in medieval Ireland than about the master masons and other craftsmen who conceived and executed buildings on their behalf. Those whom medieval chroniclers and modern commentators record as 'builders' were those who commissioned buildings, and it is often their preferences in layout and architectural style which we see in the finished works, especially in the case of those buildings on which substantial amounts of money were spent and with which patrons knew they would be identified in the public mind. But the mason was more than merely the technician. Everywhere in medieval Europe the great leaps forward in the engineering of buildings were the achievements of master masons, and it was principally they who transmitted architectural concepts from place of origin to place of imitation. If the greatest monuments of medieval architecture can be construed as theological (Von Simson 1962) or philosophical (Panofsky 1951) expressions, the masons might not have been able to achieve this synthesis of physical form and intellectual construct without first having some understanding of theology and philosophy. The master masons of medieval Ireland remain in obscurity. None of them ascended to the level of public acclaim enjoyed by such European masters as Peter Parler, the fourteenth century architect of Prague Cathedral (Bachmann 1969, 99-106). Indeed, given the apparent propensity of Irish patrons from earliest medieval times to assign more money towards sculpture than towards architecture, it is entirely fitting that Ireland's most celebrated family of stone workers, the O'Tunneys of late medieval Ormond (Rae 1971), excelled in stone sculpture rather than stone construction. Families in which stone-carving skills were passed from generation to generation, as was apparently the case with the O'Tunneys, may have been common in medieval Ireland, even if few benefited from such steady patronage as the Butler earls of Ormond provided the O'Tunneys. There were probably many periods prior to the sixteenth century in Ireland when work within the secular and ecclesiastical environments was relatively scarce for professional builders and craftsmen, but the reform of the Irish Church in the twelfth century provided opportunities for employment in abundance. In return for those opportunities Irish masons were presented with the challenge of executing the motif-rich architectural sculpture of the tradition which modern scholarship describes as Romanesque.

However, Diarmait Mac Murchada, whose regal career in Leinster spanned the four middle decades of the twelfth century, provided considerably more work for masons in south-east Ireland than Cormac had managed in Munster. Diarmait succeeded to the kingship of Ui Chennselaig and to the provincial kingship of Leinster in 1132 (Mac Shamhrain 1996, 102), although the regnal list in the Book of Leinster indicates that he became king six years earlier (Flanagan 1998, 111, n.17). After an eventful career which reached its denouement in 1169 with the Anglo-Norman arrival in Ireland (Martin 1987), Diarmait died in 1171 as king of Leinster, '...without unction, without body of Christ, without penance, without a will, in reparation to Colmcille and Finnian and to the saints besides, whose churches he destroyed' (AU). The author of this obituary gives us a very incomplete picture of Diarmait's involvement with the ecclesiastical world. During his career Diarmait was actively engaged in the foundation and support of churches, and even if many of his acts of ecclesiastical patronage had demonstrable political motivations, his commitment to the reform of the Church can hardly be doubted. Baltinglass Abbey, county Wicklow, is a case in point. Diarmait founded this Cistercian abbey in 1148 as a daughter house of Mellifont, county Louth, Ireland's first Cistercian foundation; evidence that he was the founder is preserved in an 1185 confirmation charter of John (Nicholls 1985). His patronage earned him a certificate of confraternity from St Bernard of Clairvaux (Meerseman 1955). Diarmait's grant to the Cistercians of extensive lands at Baltinglass also had a political purpose: it effectively separated the Ua Tuathail demesne lands in the lordship of Ui Muiredaig from mountain lands which they had recently acquired in Ui Mail (Byrne 1987, 23). Baltinglass was not Diarmait's only involvement with the Cistercians. Between 1162 and 1165 he confirmed by charter a grant made by one of his subordinate kings to the Cistercian abbey of Killenny, county Kilkenny; Lorcan Ua Tuathail, the archbishop of Dublin, was a witness (Flanagan 1989, 97, 238; Mac Shamhrain 1996, 155). Like Baltinglass, Killenny had a strategic location. It was close to the pass of Belach Gabrain, the important north-south access route through which Strongbow was later to march on his way north to Dublin, and by facilitating the settlement there of a reformed monastic community, Diarmait could ensure that his political rivals would not gain easy control of that territory (Flanagan 1998, 117). Prior to his elevation in 1162 to the recently-created archbishopric, Lorcan had been abbot of Glendalough for nine years (Gwynn 1992, 267). Diarmait was certainly behind Lorcan's acquisition of both these senior ecclesiastical offices, having married Lorcan's half-sister Mor about 1153, and having later presided over the actual synod (held at Clane, county Kildare) at which Lorcan was installed as archbishop (Flanagan 1989, 101-3; Duffy 1992, 128-9; Mac Shamhrain 1996, 155). During his time at Glendalough Lorcan founded the priory of St Saviour's for canons regular of St Augustine; those canons followed the Arroasian (or Arrouasian) observance (Mac Shamhrain 1996, 155), although they might not have adopted that observance until after 1162 when Lorcan, as the newly-appointed archbishop, sent two of the regular canons of Dublin's Holy Trinity (Christ Church) Cathedral to Rome to get authorisation for the adoption by the cathedral chapter of the Arroasian custom (Dunning 1945, 308-9). The site occupied by St Saviour's is on a narrow flood plain some distance to the south-east the old monastic core. This relative isolation is surprising, and it may be that a lack of</page><page sequence="3">54 TADHG O'KEEFFE enthusiasm for Augustinians within the long-established monastic community persuaded the reformed clerics to locate at the periphery of the settlement. Whatever the case, one can assume at least that Diarmait was the driving force behind St Saviour's foundation for he allegedly imposed a new abbot on the community after Lorcan moved to the metropolis in 1162 (Mac Shamhrain 1996, 157). Programmes of rebuilding and refurbishment in the centre of Glendalough, necessitated perhaps by disturbances which followed Lorcan's departure and which left several structures - 'Cro Coemgin', 'Cro Ciarain', and 'Reccles an da Sinchell' - in ruins (AFM s.a. 1163), may have been at Diarmait's instigation. Diarmait certainly had a special attachment to monastic groupings following the Rule of St Augustine. An active supporter of nuns following the Rule, he founded the abbey of St Mary de Hogges in Dublin for Arroasian canonesses around 1146, and about five years later he founded - allegedly as its cells - the convents of Aghade, county Carlow, and Kilculliheen, county Kilkenny (Gwynn and Hadcock 1970, 312, 316-7, 319). If his support for the canonesses was in part reparation for his violation of the abbess of Kildare in his crech rig in 1132 (Byrne 1987, 45), his principal motivation may have been his family connection with the Arroasian nuns: his niece had served as abbess at Clonard, the mother house of the community in Ireland (Flanagan 1981, 9). By 1162 Diarmait had also 'founded' an abbey (St Mary's) at Ferns, county Wexford, for Augustinian canons regular of the Arroasian congregation (Mac Shamhrain 1996, 155, 166, n.4). It was probably not a new foundation in the strictest sense of the term; rather, Diarmait probably had the new monastic rule - the Rule of St Augustine - installed in what was an older, secularised, monastic community (Flanagan 1998, 114). Kilmakilloge Church, located in Clonattin Upper townland, county Wexford, may have been a cell of Ferns (Gwynn and Hadcock 1970, 198), and it is not inconceivable that the early site of Clone, located several miles to the west of Ferns, also became a cell. Arroasian canons were also introduced by Diarmait to All Hallows Priory in Dublin about 1162, and land was granted to them in Baldoyle on the north side of the city (Mac Shamhrain 1996, 157; Flanagan 1989, 75, n.84, 235, n.20). Diarmait's acts of patronage also extended to churches which were not the possessions of reformed clerics or nuns. Killeshin, county Laois, the principal monastery of Ui Bairrche, is an example. After a purge of Leinster noblemen in 1141, Diarmait appears to have annexed Ui Bairrche and to have imposed on it the family of Ua Gairbid who had been dispossessed of the kingdom of Ui Felmeda further to the east. The endowment of Killeshin with a new church, or at least with a new portal on its church, was evidently part of his strategy for Ui Bairrche's annexation (Bhreathnach 1994, 45-6). Two other sites which may have benefited from Diarmait's patronage are Aghowle, county Wicklow, and Kilteel, county Kildare. The former belonged within the federation of monasteries associated with St Finnian, but it rivalled Clonard for seniority within that federation. Marriage alliances between Diarmait's sister, Dubchablach, and successive kings of Ui Felmeda, the district in which Aghowle is located, may have been intended to defuse tensions between the two church-sites (Flanagan 1981, 8-9). Aghowle's church, newly-built in the twelfth century, may have been an expression of Diarmait's desire to pacify the Aghowle community. Kilteel, a site appropriated by the Knights' Hospitallers as a frontier preceptory in the colonial era, was located within Ui Mael Ruba, a territory of the Fothairt Airthir Life among whom numbered Diarmait's mother (Byrne 1987, 27). Manning has suggested (1997) that those stones decorated with figure sculpture which have been reconstructed as parts of a chancel arch in the ruined church at Kilteel may originally have been parts of a doorway and a chancel arch in a church built under Diarmait's patronage.</page><page sequence="4">DIARMAIT MAC MURCHADA AND ROMANESQUE LEINSTER 55 /-?-~^J ^~/^ )-V^Baldoyle Q^s/ cf U^Y Dublin0 \^ fS Diocese of Kildare pO V'.;. \ / Diocese of Dublin I Glendalough \\ J r^^^^ GLENDALOUGH k \ / \ L BALTINGLASS \ /' A ^'^^^ \^ O KILLESHIN ?^{ /-' ' j \ Diocese of Ossory ) Aghade J \.

Several of the religious establishments associated with Diarmait have disappeared, but there are significant remains of those churches known for certain to have been built at his behest, or at very least with his acquiescence, at Killeshin, Baltinglass, Glendalough (St Saviour's), and Ferns (Fig. 8). These buildings are examined in this paper. Three of these four buildings - Killeshin, Ferns, St Saviour's - are regarded as belonging within the tradition known as 'Irish Romanesque' (Henry 1970, 176, 177-8, 181-3; Leask 1955, 96-100, 102-7, 163-4). Baltinglass, like Mellifont, Jerpoint, county Kilkenny, and Boyle, county Roscommon, is Romanesque architecture of a peculiarly Cistercian type. The 'Cistercian Romanesque' and 'Irish Romanesque' traditions are strikingly different in their macro-scale architectural conceptions, but some overlap or cross-fertilisation between them is apparent, especially at the level of architectural sculpture, and these matters are explored here also. The Augustinian Churches at Ferns and Glendalough Ferns was the capital of Diarmait's kingdom. It was here that he had his longphort (AT s.a. 1166), and it was here that he died in 1171 having initiated and participated in the creation of the Anglo-Norman colony in Ireland. Ferns had been chosen as the diocesan centre of Ui Chennsalaig in 1111, a status which it retained in 1152. A new cathedral church may well have been built at Ferns in the early 1100s, but whatever structure stood there while Diarmait was king has not survived programmes of rebuilding in the thirteenth century and later. The remains of the abbey church of the community of Augustinian canons regular, dedicated to St Mary, are located to the south-east of the cathedral and the ancient ecclesiastical site which it occupies. All that remains is the northern half of a nave and chancel church, the former 14m by 6.4m internally, and the latter 4.47m by 5.3m internally; the axis of the chancel is skewed slightly to the north of that of the nave (Fig. 9). Entry into the nave was through a two-ordered portal in the west wall, of which only the north-side bases (of bulbous form) remain in situ; the chancel arch, which may have had comparable sculpture, no longer remains. A small square turret projects from the north side of the west facade of the church and flanks the portal. Once the turret clears the original roof level of the nave it changes shape, becoming cylindrical; it sufficiently resembles Ireland's free-standing Round Towers of the tenth, eleventh and twelfth centuries to be regarded as an example of that type of monument. Restoration of the masonry makes assessment difficult, but it appears that this building was added to the original west wall of the church and is later than the portal; it might be noted in this context that the Round Tower which formerly existed at the west end of Trinity church, Glendalough, was also an addition to an older building. The present north wall of the nave stands to a considerable height, but its lower part, comprised of thin, slate-like stones, may be contemporary with the portal in the west wall, while much of its upper fabric may be contemporary with the Round Tower. A two-storeyed building, almost square in plan with a barrel-vaulted lower chamber, projects from the north side of the junction of the nave and chancel; access to its interior is from the nave, while a spiral stair gave access to its upper chamber as well as to a room above the chancel. The original roof of the nave at Ferns was probably of timber, but the chancel was barrel vaulted, and that vault was supported by three flat-sectioned transverse arches (Fig. 10). Unlike the arches in the nave of Cormac's Chapel in Cashel (1127-34), the only other Irish church</page><page sequence="7">58 TADHG O'KEEFFE IffliPlllBiMfll^^ ?,- , /71 Fig. 10 The north wall of the chancel of St Mary's Abbey church, Ferns, showing the remains of the barrel-vault and tranverse ribs</page><page sequence="8">DIARMAIT MAC MURCHADA AND ROMANESQUE LEINSTER 59 ._n 110m I I .I Fig. 11 A plan of the church and the site of the cloister at St Mary's Abbey, Ferns; the fragments of the cloister no longer survive (based on Cochrane 1910)</page><page sequence="9">60 TADHG O'KEEFFE where these features are found, the Ferns arches spring from neither horizontal nor vertical members. Instead, their chamfered springers simply project from a narrow set-back along the line of springing of the vault. Small holes perforate these springers, and these probably accommodated structural tie-rods of metal (see Wilcox 1981 for example). A single, splaying window, now blocked, provided lighting for the chancel from the north. Its rear-arch is uninterrupted and has finely-wrought stones. Flanking it on its east and west, and set at the same horizontal level, are niches - Henry incorrectly illustrated them as windows (1970, Fig. 27) - with roll-moulded jambs, imposts, and unmoulded arches. While these resemble in miniature the church doors at Myshall, county Carlow, and Sheepstown, county Kilkenny, the stones of which they are formed appear to have been reused. Foundations indicating a walled area measuring about 22m east-west and about 20m north south, and adjacent to the south wall of the church, were surveyed early this century (Cochrane 1910; Fig. 4). It was clearly the remains of a claustral area. Nothing survives of it today. The presence of canons regular of St Augustine at Ferns from c. 1160 certainly explains the cloister, and if it was laid out at the time that the Rule of St Augustine was introduced to Ferns we can regard it as one of the very earliest examples in Ireland of a cloister outside of the Cistercian order. The cloister appears from Cochrane's plan to be later than the church, and this supports the suggestion made by Flanagan (1998,114) that the Augustinian abbey at Ferns was not a new foundation but an existing monastery with a new set of regulations. Furthermore, it allows us to date the church to the pre-1160 period, which in turn allows us to consider the possibility that the church is a near-contemporary of, or at least within a generation of, Cormac's Chapel. The priory church of St Saviour's at Glendalough, erected during the abbacy of Lorcan Ua Tuathail between 1153 and 1162, is a more elaborately decorated structure than the Ferns church. Heavily restored using original stonework, it is comprised of a nave and chancel, the former measuring 12.5m by 6.2m internally, and the latter 5.27m by 3.5m internally; a rectangular building, 5.8m wide and originally divided into two rooms, is attached to the north side of the nave (Cochrane 1912; Fig. 5). The church itself was entered through two doorways at either end of the south wall of the nave, both reconstructed with plain round arches; that to the east had foundations of a projecting porch discovered in the 1870s when the church was taken into State care and the site cleared of rubble. Between the two doors are two windows, each round-arched with external hood-mouldings. There was apparently no entry to the building which is adjacent to the north side of the nave except through a door at the east end of the north wall of the nave, but the whole centre of the building's north wall has been rebuilt above foundation level so it is possible that there was originally a door here. At least two windows provided lighting for the eastern part of this curious structure, and one of these is sufficiently high in the wall to suggest that there was an upper floor; that upper floor may have served as both dormitory and refectory. An opening in this building's east wall led to a flight of steps which then led to the space above the chancel arch, and from there one could turn left into a room above the chancel itself (Fig. 13a). The chancel, which is not on the same axis as the nave but is skewed slightly to the north, was barrel-vaulted originally, with the springing of the vault marked by a ledge of chamfered stone. Given that barrel-vaulted churches generally have external stone roofs in twelfth-century Ireland, it is probable that the room above the chancel originally had an external stone roof. The reconstructed chancel arch itself has three orders, but the inner order broadens to form a wide arch over the western part of the chancel. The outer order of the arch - that facing onto the nave, in other words - is plain, while the central order has saw-tooth chevron, and the inner order has voussoirs carved with a remarkable assortment of small motifs set within lozenges; one voussoir</page><page sequence="10">^^^*l &gt; W l-___ &amp; r?=======ZSZ?n 1 &gt; _^ n _m Original masonry ?

The chancel arch bases are the most richly decorated in Ireland. The decorative stonework on the reconstructed east wall of the chancel is even more remarkable (Fig. 13b). A twin-light window with a monolithic head carved in mica-schist is set within an external, round-arched recess with small angle-shafts supporting a decorated arch and hood moulding. Inside the chancel, the window has an exceptionally elaborate surround using different types of chevron, small marigolds, interlace patterns, and small triangular panels which contains zoomorphic and anthropomorphic motifs. As Leask noted (1955, 158-60), there are parallels for the sculpture of St Saviour's in the so called 'Priest's House' in the old monastic core of Glendalough. Long has suggested that this little structure was built later than 1186 (1994, 250-1). It is likely, however, that the stonework which is visible at the eastern end of the 'Priest's House' was carved around the time - the 1150s - that St Saviour's was being constructed. The other example of twelfth-century Romanesque architecture at Glendalough is the chancel of the cathedral, and the fact that this has little in common with the Romanesque work at St Saviour's may be significant. The rear-arch of its east window has a type of chevron which is comparable with that on the north door of the nave, dating from the 1160s, at Baltinglass. It is possible, therefore, that the chancel of Glendalough cathedral was constructed (or heavily reconstructed) immediately after those disruptions which were recorded at Glendalough in 1163 (AFM). St Saviour's was already in existence at this time, and the bishop seems not to have employed its masons in the building-work at his cathedral. A final point to be made here about the cathedral concerns its chancel arch and the north portal of its nave: these have filleted rolls of a type generally indicative of a date in the thirteenth century, and even though fillets are found in the middle of the twelfth century at Killeshin (discussed below), it is possible that the chancel arch and north portal were added to the cathedral towards the end of the 1100s. Ferns and St Saviour's have two particular features in common, and these allow us discuss the two churches as a pair. First, their chancels were barrel-vaulted. They share this feature with the chancels of other Irish churches, including the largest of the twelfth-century Rahan churches in county Offaly, and Cormac's Chapel at Cashel. The superstructures of all these chancels look back to that early, non-decorated Romanesque tradition (O'Keeffe 1998, 122-3) of the later 1000s and early 1100s of which St Kevin's church at Glendalough is a product. Secondly, the axes of both chancels are skewed slightly (and inexplicably) to the north of the axes of the naves. These parallels of plan and superstructure suggest that Ferns and St Saviour's are roughly contemporary, and the involvement of Diarmait in both foundations reinforces that conclusion. St Saviour's is securely dated to between 1153 and 1162. Given that it was apparently a new monastic foundation on a new site, a date at the start rather than at the end of that range seems likely. This suggestion is supported by the sculptural motifs which it shares with the earliest, c. 1150, phases of Baltinglass Abbey (discussed below). It is reasonable to suggest that Ferns, a less elaborately-decorated building located at the heart of Diarmait's kingdom, and a building which was not intended for a reformed monastic community, is slightly older. It is also reasonable to suggest a date for it in the 1140s, or at latest in the early 1150s. The loss of the chancel arch at Ferns is to be regretted since it would provide some measure of the development of sculptural embellishment across a short span of time in the middle of the twelfth century.</page><page sequence="13">64 tadhg o'keeffe Killeshin Church Church portals with elaborate sculptural decoration are characteristic of the Irish Romanesque tradition in its mid-twelfth-century floruit, and examples are found in Leinster at Killeshin, Aghowle, and Clone, all sites with which Diarmait had, or is likely to have had, some association; the doorway at Aghowle is unusual in combining a roll moulding and pellet ornament with a lintel, while the doorway at Clone, now repaired as a lintelled opening, originally had a series of stone heads associated with it (Hore 1911, 584-87); four of these heads remain at the site, including one which wears a crown, while the fifth head was removed to St Edan's Well in Ferns (Proceedings 1895, 406-7). Fragments of a once-fine doorway (Hore 1911, 655-58) lie scattered at the neglected site of Kilmakilloge Church, a possible cell of Ferns. Other exceptional doorways in south-east Leinster survive in Wicklow (Hickey 1972) and in Timahoe Round Tower, county Laois (Crawford 1924). The masterpiece is undoubtedly the Killeshin portal (Fig. 14). The church at Killeshin stands inside a small oval enclosure sited on a low eminence, its elevation exaggerated somewhat by the deep cut of the modern road which flanks the site on the Fig. 14 The west facade and portal of Killeshin church</page><page sequence="14">DIARMAIT MAC MURCHADA AND ROMANESQUE LEINSTER 65 south side. Two saints are associated with Killeshin, Diarmait (or Modimoc) Mac Siabairr of the Ui Bairrche, who is named in the Leinster genealogies and may be the founder-saint, and St Comgan, whose intrusion into Killeshin's history in eleventh and twelfth-century sources may be attributable to the Dal Cais involvement in the place's affairs after the turn of the millennium (Bhreathnach 1994, 35-7). Killeshin was quite an important monastery: the Leinster genealogies which are preserved in the early twelfth-century codex Oxford, Bodleian Library, Rawlinson B 502, may have been compiled there, even if the manuscript was actually written in Glendalough (6 Riain 1981; Bhreathnach 1994, 43; Breatnach 1997). A twelfth-century church is the only extant building at Killeshin, but it stands on the site of a stone church 'broken' in the mid-eleventh century (AT s.a. 1041), and that church, in turn, presumably stood on the site of one or more older churches. A Round Tower also stood at Killeshin. In 1709 local informants told Dr Thomas Molyneux, who visited Killeshin on his way to Kilkenny, that the tower had recently been demolished and that it had fallen to the ground quite intact (Graves 1861, 302); Molyneux's information is confirmed by an independent source which recorded that the afternoon of March 8, 1703 was the time of demolition, that a certain Bambrick, an employee of one Captain Woolsely, was the culprit, and that the fallen tower measured 105 feet in length (Proceedings 1865, 303). The evidence that Killeshin church was erected under Diarmait's patronage is based on the recordings made by earlier scholars of the portal's now incomplete inscription. Molyneux noted the inscription in 1709, and while he appears to have made a record of the letters, he unfortunately left empty the space in his journal into which he had intended transcribing what he had recorded (Graves 1861, 302). John O'Donovan of the Ordnance Survey visited Killeshin in 1838, and he too recognised the inscription, recording that it ran horizontally above the capitals from one side of the portal to the other. He recorded the two parts of the inscription as OR DO... ART RILAGEN... DON AIRCHINDECH... LENA..., and [OR] DO... TOISECH HUA NDUACH, and these he translated as A PRAYER FOR ART KING OF LEINSTER... FOR THE AIRCHINDECH... LENA..., and [A PRAYER] FOR THE CHIEF OF UI DUACH (O'Donovan 1838, 72-108). Graves had used this version as a substitute for the missing 1709 transcription in his publication of Molyneux's account of Killeshin (1861, 302, n.2), but in 1872 he took his own rubbings of the two parts of the inscription and transcribed them as [+ OR DO] ART... RIG LAGEN... ACUS DO ONAERCINNECH... CH, and OR DO..^ LENA... UAMEL... DUACH. He also transcribed a further inscription which he noticed running vertically up one of the portal jambs on the north side, and this he read as + OR DO CELLACAMI. The decay of letters between 1838 and 1872 probably does not explain the inconsistencies between the readings of O'Donovan and Graves, and it is probable that O'Donovan's version was simply incorrect (Fitzgerald 1911, 191; Macalister 1949, 27). Graves himself did not publish this inscription, but drawings based on his rubbings were made by Margaret Stokes and were published several years later (Petrie 1878, pl.xli). Lord Walter Fitzgerald made new rubbings in 1911, more than two centuries after Molyneux had visited Killeshin, but he was unable to discern several of the words and letters recorded by Gravels. He suggested that the incomplete inscriptions could be translated as [PRAY FOR]... KING OF LEINSTER... AND FOR... ON ERENAGH... LENA... O'MEL..., and PRAY FOR CELLAC [or KELLY] AMI... (Fitzgerald 1911, 194). Macalister brought the Killeshin inscriptions into focus again in his Corpus of half a century ago, retrieving the letters OR DO [?C]... AD[?]AR[?]... ILAGEN... GNEIN... AD...

UAMEL as the only legible letters still extant (1994, 45). Maire and Liam de Paor suggested that the 'king of Leinster' referred to in the portal inscription was Diarmait Mac Murchada (1958, 182) and, given both the style of the portal and Diarmait's involvement in Killeshin affairs, the identification seems secure. Leask suggested that Cellachan might have been the mason (1955, 105). If this is correct, and if the inscription contained no more than the invitation to us to remember him, we must assume that the two inscriptions are original and contemporary. Patrons' and craftsmens' names were recorded on major items of Romanesque metal work in Ireland, and it is improbable that a mason would be allowed record his own name but not that of his patron. The present church at Killeshin has a much-ruined nave and chancel (Fig. 15). It is a building of several phases. The earliest extant fabric is clearly on the north and south sides of the nave (although considerably less remains of the south wall than of the north wall), and on the north side of the west facade. The north window, set within a gabled surround on the exterior and with a roll-molded rear-arch, indicates a date of construction in the twelfth century for this wall. The great portal is contemporary, but it was not originally in the position which it now occupies. The west facade of the church, except for the north anta, has seen two phases of rebuilding, first with the re-erection of the portal a little to the south of its original position, and then with the replacement of the original south anta with a plain corner, buttressed from the south by a plinth. Significantly, the fifteenth-century east window of the chancel is slightly off-centre in the east wall of the chancel, but it is aligned with the rebuilt west portal, and that suggests that the west portal had been rebuilt in its present position by the fifteenth century. Crawford and Leask, who provided a fold-out drawing of the portal in this Journal three quarters of a century ago, observed that the great portal had been rebuilt (1925, 90). This conclusion they drew from evidence of 'disturbance' on the soffit of the outer arch, from the off-centre position of the key-stone of the outer arch, from the 'reversal' of the second stone below the capital on the north pilaster, and from the observation that the portal's upright members are perpendicular to ground-level rather than battered as might be expected in a twelfth-century work. They did not observe the lack of symmetry in the west facade, nor the unequivocal evidence, particularly visible on the interior of the wall, that the whole centre of the west facade was not original. The rebuilt portal at Killeshin is probably faithful to the original configuration, if only to judge by the geometrical regularity which the rebuilding exhibits (Fig. 16). The height from ground level to the springing of the arch is equal to the vertical distance between the crown of the arch and the tip of the pediment. The arch, being semi-circular, can be inscribed within a rectangle of a ratio of 1:2, but the areas around the door jambs and the pediment can each be inscribed within rectangles laid out according to the Golden ratio, 1:1.618 (see Coldstream 1991, 37-8). Given the accuracy with which the Killeshin portal conforms to this proportional system, it seem likely that the stones were measured, dressed and assembled in the mason's yard, and were installed only after the mason had achieved the proportions with accuracy. The Killeshin portal is one of the key monuments of the Irish Romanesque, and many of its structural and decorative features are characteristic of the tradition.

The pediment at Killeshin is without sculpture, but this might not always have been the case: part of the hood-moulding above the head at the crown of the outer archivolt is missing, and it is possible that some work of sculpture, possibly a statuesque figure, occupied the interior of the pediment and rested on this head. The hood moulding itself is decorated with a type of billet work, an ornamental device which was used rarely in twelfth-century Ireland. The roll-moulding on the corners of the doorway jambs are also typical of mid-twelfth century Irish Romanesque work; cylindrical or three-quarter cylindrical columns in the return angles of jambs were used in Ireland in the period 1130-1150 in Ireland (as at Cormac's Chapel, for example) as well as in virtually all English Romanesque work. The use of rolls on the jambs at Killeshin is mirrored in the portal's archivolts where small rolls mark the convergence of the flat extrados and soffit faces; these small archivolt rolls at Killeshin are filleted, a device frequently encountered in Gothic architecture in thirteenth-century Ireland. The roll mouldings on the Killeshin jambs terminate with bulbous bases; comparable bases are found elsewhere in south-east Leinster (Ferns, for example), in the midlands (as at the Nuns' Church at Clonmacnois and the largest of the three churches at Rahan, both in county Offaly), and west of the Shannon (as at Annaghdown, county Galway). The square and rectangular capitals on the Killeshin portal form a continuous frieze, visually separating the jambs from the archivolts; comparable frieze-like capitals are as widely distributed as bulbous bases, with Timahoe Round Tower, county Laois, and Inchagoill, county Galway, having particularly striking parallels. Most of the decoration on the portal is lightly-incised, and the use of stones of different colour on the portal suggests that paint was applied in the twelfth century to the carved surfaces. Fig. 17 (a) The keystone on the outer arch of the Killeshin portal; (b) a detail from the interior of the east window of St Saviour's church, Glendalough (not to scale)</page><page sequence="19">70 TADHG O'KEEFFE Much of the decoration is comprised of abstract shapes, and of both zoomorphic and vegetal motifs; in some cases the same motif is used on both sides of the portal but in a mirror-image configuration. Human heads are used on the corners of the capitals and a single human head is carved, as was noted, on the off-centre keystone of the outer archivolt; these heads are three dimensional in their sculptured form, while two-dimensional human masks are discretely positioned among the carvings on the jambs. The use of a human head on the keystone of an arch can be paralleled at St Caimin's church, Inishcealtra, county Clare, and at Clonkeen, county Limerick. The Killeshin head is quite elongated, is bearded and moustachioed, and has curling locks. Two inverted birds peck at the beard (Fig. 17a). Found also at St Saviour's (Fig. 17b), this is a common Romanesque variation on a universal motif of a man flanked by, and sometimes visibly being attacked by, beasts (Bousquet 1983). Notwithstanding the evidence of rebuilding, the Killeshin version was clearly the centrepiece of a set of archivolts which had no other figural content. The configuration and the relative proportions of the elements of both the Killeshin and St Saviour's sculptures appear to have been determined by the shapes of the stones on which they are carved; departures from realism caused by the settings in which sculpture was displayed are common in Romanesque art, and Henri Focillon even regarded this phenomenon, which he described as the hi du cadre, the 'law of the frame' (Focillon 1931), as one of the art's guiding principles. Despite their thematic similarities, the St Saviour's and Killeshin sculptures are clearly not by the same hand, and the iconographic reasoning behind their use at both sites is lost. In the case of the St Saviour's example, the small curving surfaces on which one of the two birds stands suggest clouds, indicating that the image relates to celestial events; the use of three disks in the composition of the image may represent the Trinity. Animal interlace in the Urnes fashion is woven into the hair of the heads on the Killeshin capitals; capitals with pairs of heads and sometimes with flanking interlace are widely distributed, but the best parallels for the Killeshin capitals are at Timahoe and Kilteel. Chevron is used on all Killeshin archivolts except the outermost; that archivolt has an unusual strap-like device arranged in a chevron-like configuration, and although it is interrupted by the head at the crown of the arch, the triangular shape of the head does seem somewhat integrated with it. Some of the spandrels of the second-largest archivolt have small animals carved within them, including a dog chasing a stag; Crawford identified these as animals from the bestiary (1918). These small figures reveal the strong influence of manuscript art on the portal's decoration, and one can imagine that they were painted in the same limited range of colours as is found in twelfth-century manuscripts. Step patterns on the plinths of the portal and on the soffit of the outer archivolt can be paralleled on other portals (among them Kilmore, formerly Trinity Island, county Cavan, and Freshford, county Kilkenny), and they strongly suggest the influence of contemporary metalwork (see, for example, the Breac Maodhog, the Soiscel Molaise, the Shrine of the Stowe Missal, and St Patrick's Bell-shrine). The probability is that the name recorded in the inscription on this portal is that of Diarmait Mac Murchada, and the most likely date at which he would have involved himself in the patronage of a church (or part of a church) at Killeshin is after 1141. The presence at both St Saviour's (probably built in the early 1150s) and Killeshin of the motif of a human head flanked by biting birds, and the presence (discussed below) at Baltinglass in c.1150 of bulbous bases very similar to those at Killeshin, allow us suggest a date in the late 1140s or, more likely, the early 1150s for this great portal. Is it possible that the portal was made after the diocese of Leighlin (Lethglenn), possibly under Diarmait's influence, consumed the traditional boundary between Ui Chennselaig and Uf Bairrche in 1152?</page><page sequence="20">DIARMAIT MAC MURCHADA AND ROMANESQUE LEINSTER 71 nononoDfl Eh _20m I ^^H -==-= \?=z_^ Fig. 18 A plan of Baltinglass Abbey church (based on Stalley 1987) BALTINGLASS ABBEY Founded by Diarmait in 1148, Baltinglass Abbey is roughly contemporary with St Saviour's and Ferns, and possibly also with Killeshin, but it is a radically different type of building. Founded during the lifetime of St Bernard of Clairvaux, the great spiritual leader of the Cistercian Order, its principal design features were largely predetermined by its Cistercian affiliation. Not only were Cistercian monasteries claustral in plan, with the church customarily on the north side of the cloister, and the domestic and business buildings arranged around the other three sides of the square cloister, but Cistercian architecture was appropriately austere, given the circumstances of the Order's foundation in Burgundy in the late 1000s (Lawrence 1984, 146-56). The church alone survives above ground at Baltinglass, and despite considerable change in its fabric - the northern nave arcade is destroyed, an unsightly nineteenth-century tower stands in the second bay to the west of the crossing, and the east wall has been substantially rebuilt - it retains more than a modicum of elegance. It was an aisled building with transepts and a flat ended presbytery (Fig. 18), and the claustral buildings were attached to its south side. The eastern end of Baltinglass, certainly the earliest part of the church to have been built, departs from normal Cistercian practice in the arrangement of its transeptal chapels. These projected independently of each other rather than share a common east wall as is the system</page><page sequence="21">Fig. 19 The junction of the presbytery and transepts in Baltinglass Abbey church: (a) the north-east; (b) the south east 3</page><page sequence="22">DIARMAIT MAC MURCHADA AND ROMANESQUE LEINSTER 73 Fig. 20 The transept arches of Baltinglass Abbey church looking northwards; the two structural phases in the south-western crossing pier (on the left) are visible elsewhere, and only two were built on each transept. Mellifont, the mother house of Baltinglass, was not the source of this design, but it too was unique in having pairs of apsidal rather than flat-ended chapels on each transept (Stalley 1987, 57). The entrances into the transeptal chapels at Baltinglass survive at foundation level only, and even at that level they are largely restored, but the quoins at their entrances were embellished with roll mouldings flanked by pairs of narrow quirks. Larger rolls, executed in warm, yellow coloured granite, mark the junctions of the long transept arms and the presbytery (Fig. 19 a, b). These have bulbous bases, beneath which are semi-circular panels containing decoration, that on the south having a floral design on its north face and a spiral device on its west face, and that on the north having a lion and a floral device on its west face. The south-west crossing pier has two affronted animals carved on its lower stones, their heads meeting at the north-west corner. The rebuilt east wall of the presbytery has three tall lancets, and carved stonework, including part of an elaborately carved jamb base, is reused in them; the original east wall would probably also have had three windows, but comparative evidence suggests they would have been short and round-arched.</page><page sequence="23">74 TADHG O'KEEFFE Stalley has identified the 'low' transepts as evidence of Burgundian influence at Baltinglass (1987, 79-80). The relative height of those transepts is indicated by the wide, round arches which survive on the north and south sides of the crossing (Fig. 20). Those arches spring from rectangular piers (with chamfers) where the crossing adjoins the nave, but the junction of the crossing and the presbytery are, as was noted above, simple returns marked by a roll-moulded quoins. Stalley implies contemporaneity between the transept arches, their supports, and the presbytery, but there are indications of a complex structural chronology, and these are complicated by late medieval or post-medieval alterations. The layout of the eastern end of the church does indeed suggest that the presbytery, transept and chapels were planned in one stage - the presbytery is square in plan, and each transept is twice its length - but it is in the superstructure that problems of relative chronology become apparent. The arches over the entrances into the transepts do not sit squarely on the imposts from which they rise; their diametrical centres are a little to the west of the central, north-south axis of the crossing (Fig. 20), suggesting that they are not contemporary with the walls which support them. The fact that the arches themselves contain some reused masonry (visible in Fig. 19b) suggest that they were simply rebuilt and that, notwithstanding the asymmetry of the reconstruction, they preserve their original character. The roll mouldings on the responds on the east side of the crossing also show signs of later rebuilding: some of the rolls have pairs of flanking quirks or grooves, and others simply have a v-profiled incision where the roll meets the face of the stone. Here too we might suggest that rebuilding is faithful to the original. There is, however, an alternative and more complex explanation. Despite some evidence of reconstruction, the bases and the lower parts of the roll mouldings are unquestionably original to the c.1150 east end of Baltinglass. These roll mouldings provide continuous vertical articulation where the presbytery returns from the transepts, but they are not structurally reconciled with the imposts which crown them, nor are they properly aligned with the springers of the arches, as can be seen in Figure 19. Moreover, the bulbous bases create the expectation that capitals, not imposts, will mark the termination of the roll mouldings. The likelihood is, then, that the partially-reconstructed transept arches which we see today are not those intended by the builders in c.1150. Instead, they are probably contemporary with the nave of the church (Fig. 14), dated by Stalley (1987, 84-6) to the 1160s. We cannot claim, however, that they must have replaced older transept arches: it is possible that the transepts were simpy left unfinished during the building campaign of the late 1140s and early 1150s. There is also evidence of a complex structural chronology at the west side of the crossing where it opens onto the nave. There are clearly two phases of construction in the piers here, with the earlier phase possibly corresponding to the same, c.1150, building campaign as the presbytery, and the later phase corresponding to the building campaign of the 1160s which gave Baltinglass its present nave. On the southern pier - the south-western corner of the crossing - one can see clearly that the respond for the first arch in the nave is added to an original pier, transforming an almost square pier into a rectangular one (Fig. 20). On the surface it appears that much of the new fabric is not bonded into the older fabric, although there may be bonding at the core of the enlarged pier; the original chamfered plinth was also retained. The capital of the arch associated with the new respond is decorated with a variation of the motif which appears further along the nave. Thus it seems that the original crossing pier is quite different from the later piers of the nave. On the north side it is evident that the respond for the nave arch is also added to an earlier pier, but here the later respond is narrower than the original pier, resulting in an L-shaped pier today. The arch that springs northwards from the original pier to cross the north aisle is not contemporary with it but is of the same generation as the nave arcades.</page><page sequence="24">DIARMAIT MAC MURCHADA AND ROMANESQUE LEINSTER 75 Fig. 21 The ruined south aisle of the nave of Baltinglass Abbey church looking eastwards towards the south transept arch</page><page sequence="25">76 TADHG O'KEEFFE It is not easy to reconstruct the original appearance of the crossing at Baltinglass. Stalley has suggested that Baltinglass conformed to the so-called 'Bernardine' plan-type in having its transepts and presbytery roofed at a lower level than its nave (1987, 79), and the fact that Jerpoint, its daughter house, seems to have that arrangement supports his suggestion. If this is correct, we must envisage the roof of the nave of Baltinglass continuing past the crossing and terminating as a gable directly above the west end of the presbytery. Indeed, the term 'crossing' might not be strictly accurate in such a reconstruction: from the perspective of elevation, the openings into the transepts would be part of the nave rather than part of a separately-constituted bay separating the nave and presbytery. Notwithstanding the evidence that the east end of Baltinglass has a more complex structural history than Stalley concedes, this is a convincing reconstruction. As a caveat, however, we must recognise that those original, square piers at the east end of the nave may have carried - or have been designed to carry - a north-south arch across the end of the nave. If this was the case, each of the four arms of the Baltinglass church of c.l 150 was intended to have a separate roof, with all four roofs terminating above the crossing arches. Viewed from the exterior, Baltinglass, in this reconstruction, would have had a low crossing tower. In 1157 crossing towers were prohibited among Cistercian communities by a statute of the General Chapter (Stalley 1987, 141), but low towers did exist in some of the Order's churches, and these can be explained not as a deliberate violation of a Cistercian canon but as a simple by-product of the need to support separate roofs over the naves, presbyteries, and transepts of cruciform churches (Fergusson 1970). As has been remarked, the present nave of Baltinglass was probably begun in the 1160s; a simple nave, possibly of wood, may have served the church's presbytery and transepts as they were being constructed during the 1150s. Stalley has remarked that the English parallels for the scalloped capitals on the nave piers are appropriate given that Diarmait, 'the most anglophile of Irish kings' (1987, 86), was its patron. The metaphor is apt, and it makes us wonder if Diarmait had an interest (or felt encouraged to develop an interest) in the design of Baltinglass at any stage between the late 1140s and the mid-1160s, but the Cistercians were accomplished builders with a clear, even dogmatic, notion of what was appropriate as an architectural environment, and it is unlikely that Diarmait's opinions were solicited. Nonetheless, some of the motifs at Baltinglass can be paralleled on other churches with which Diarmait is associated. The bases of the roll mouldings on the eastern crossing returns at Baltinglass are bulbous, and can be paralleled with those at Killeshin. The bulbous base on the north side of the crossing at Baltinglass has an animal - a lion? - within a D-shaped frame, and a band of flat disks, both of which can be paralleled at St Saviour's at Glendalough. The bulbous base on the south side at Baltinglass has a band of zig-zag ornament which can be paralleled in that window which is now in the south wall of St Peter's Church, a post-medieval building in Ferns, but which may have been carved originally for use in the nearby St Mary's Abbey (Cochrane 1910) or in Clone. There are also parallels on the reconstructed external recess of the so-called Priest's House at Glendalough, and on the narrow jamb columns of the portals at Clone and Wicklow. It is interesting that any of these motifs, and particularly the small animal, should appear at all in a Cistercian context as early as c.1150, given St Bernard's concern that money should not be foolishly spent on elaborate works of architecture (Brooke 1987, 21), as well as the Order's early prohibitions against churches having such items as crosses of precious metal, opulent liturgical garments and vessels, expensive bindings for books, and coloured and figurative glass, and illuminated manuscripts (Holdsworth 1987, 54). The placement of the carved stonework at Baltinglass gives the impression that here, distant from the Burgundian homeland, was a discrete but knowing violation of the spirit of Order's early architecture, and</page><page sequence="26">DIARMAIT MAC MURCHADA AND ROMANESQUE LEINSTER 77 there is no doubt that it was a violation executed by native Irish hands. The mason, or masons, responsible for these shared motifs no longer had employment at Baltinglass when the nave was being built in the 1160s. As for Diarmait, having launched the Baltinglass Cistercian colony and having received his certificate of confraternity, it is unlikely that he had any involvement in building work at Baltinglass in the 1160s. By the middle of that decade he had other things on his mind. Conclusion Grouping the churches of Killeshin, Ferns, and St Saviour's at Glendalough under the heading 'Irish Romanesque' implies, first, that they are expressions of a single stylistic concept, and secondly, that they reflect a peculiarly national vision of the international Romanesque style. While Clapham's description of the Irish Romanesque tradition as a 'remote and local adaptation of Romanesque forms, combined with features which are of purely native origin' (1936, 155) misses the point that every regional or national Romanesque variant in Europe reflects the influence of local pre-Romanesque tradition, it does adequately express the consensus, then and now, that 'Irish Romanesque' means something quite different from 'Romanesque in Ireland'. Therefore, the description of these three churches as Irish Romanesque is, within the terms of Clapham's characterisation, a valid one. Baltinglass, however, can be regarded as an example of 'Romanesque in Ireland' since it belongs within the Cistercian architectural tradition, but the presence of Irish Romanesque motifs, both architectural and sculptural, in its earliest 1148-C.1160 phase reminds us that the distinction between the two Romanesque traditions is a construct of modern art history and archaeology rather than a reality which exercised the minds of medieval patrons and builders. The four churches discussed in this paper were probably erected within a decade of each other, and that decade can be framed by the years 1145 and 1155. They share a sufficient number of sculptural motifs for us to believe that they may have shared the services of a pool of masons specialising in stone sculpture, and this conclusion is supported by the association of each structure with Diarmait Mac Murchada. The buildings were, however, designed by different men. Killeshin's master mason adhered very closely to the Irish Romanesque canon in erecting a simple church with a complex portal, and he ensured that the form and sculpture of the portal were designed and executed with great skill and assurance. His background is unknown, and even if we cannot be certain that we see his work at any other site (apart, perhaps, from Timahoe, county Laois), we may witness unknowingly the influence of his genius at many other elaborate Irish portals of the middle and later years of the twelfth century. Ferns and St Saviour's share three design features - off-centre chancel arches, barrel-vaults over their chancels, and habitable rooms above their chancels - which suggest that they shared a master mason, but such are their differences in execution and aesthetic that both are unlikely to be the product of one man's imagination and direction. The master mason at Baltinglass, finally, must have been from within the Cistercian Order, but among his fellow-builders at the Wicklow site were men who had worked at Mellifont and had some experience of major-span vaulting in the Burgundian Cistercian manner, and men - or perhaps even a single man - whose sculptured imprint is also be seen in the other churches associated with twelfth-century Ireland's most notorious king.</page><page sequence="27">78 TADHG O'KEEFFE References AFM Annals of the Kingdom of the Ireland by the Four Masters, ed.
