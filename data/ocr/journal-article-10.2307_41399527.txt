I see in them something very close to theism or natural religion, which Christians profess to equate with atheism or irreligion, though it is actually the exact opposite" (p. боб*). It is indeed well known that even Voltaire, despite many reservations, expressed agree- ment with the doctrine of the Profession de foi and that William Blake could, with some justice, link Voltaire and Rousseau to- gether as promoters of the natural religion he despised.

[533]</page><page sequence="2">534 THE GEORGIA REVIEW ably a straightforward theistic document, basing religious con- viction on the manifestation of innate and natural moral feelings: "Let us limit ourselves to the first feelings we find within us, since inquiry always brings us back to them, when it has not led us astray. Conscience! Conscience! Divine instinct, immortal and celestial voice! You are the sure guide of a being who is ignorant and confined, but intelligent and free. You are the infallible judge of good and evil and it is through you that man resembles God ..." (600-01). As for understanding what this voice is telling and where this guide is leading us, there seems to be no serious difficulty: "It is not enough to know that this guide exists: we must also be able to recognize and follow it. If it speaks to all hearts, why are there so few who understand it? It is because it speaks to us in the language of nature . . . " (601). This is presumably the same language in which the Book of Nature has been written: "I was never able to believe that God had ordered me, under penalty of damnation, to be so learned. I therefore closed all books. There is only one that is open to all eyes: the book of nature" (624). Hence the sublime natural setting chosen for the vicar's discourse: "Nature seemed to display all its magnificence to our eyes, as if to offer it as the text of our dialogue" (565). The text of nature has its equivalence in the "inner image" ( effigie intérieure) whose voice speaks clearly enough if only we are willing to silence the distracting noises of worldliness: "Let us look into ourselves, my young friend! . . . There is within our souls an innate principle of justice and virtue by which, in spite of our maxims, we judge our acts and those of others as good or bad, and it is this principle that I call conscience" (598). To the vain teaching of philosophy, the vicar opposes the innate wisdom of "inner light" (569). The affirmation of belief in a natural religion, founded in the transcendental valorization of such concepts as inwardness, in- nateness ( inéité ), voice, natural language, conscience, conscious- ness, selfhood, etc., represents, of course, a considerable deviation from the epistemological and rhetorical critiques that are to be found elsewhere throughout the work of Rousseau. No such considerations play a part in the historical and political arguments of anthropological texts such as the Second, Discourse', when God</page><page sequence="3">PAUL DE MAN 535 is mentioned in the Discourse it is primarily to demonstrate that there is no such thing as a natural language. The conflict emerges perhaps most dramatically when one juxtaposes the vicar's natural piety with the pre-Nietzschean denunciations of Christianity, as a political force, in the chapter on civil religion (Book IV, chapter 8) of the Social Contract: "It was in these circumstances (paganism having become the universal religion of the Roman empire) that Jesus came to establish a spiritual kingdom on earth. By separating the theological system from the political system, this destroyed the unity of the state, and caused the internal divisions that have never ceased to agitate Christian nations. . . . What the pagans feared finally happened. Everything then be- came different; the humble Christians changed their tone, and the supposedly otherworldly kingdom, under a visible ruler, soon became the most violent despotism in this world" (Pléiade Edition, III, 462). "The (religion of the priests) (which includes Roman catholicism as a major instance) is (considered politically) so obviously bad that amusing myself by demonstrating its draw- backs would be a waste of time. Anything that breaks social unity is worthless. All institutions that place man in contradiction with himself are worthless" (464). Jean-Robert Tronchin, the Procureur général of the City of Geneva, whose report led the Petit Conseil to order the burning of Entile and the Social Con- tract (as "tending to destroy the Christian religion and all gov- ernments") was certainly justified in referring to these texts in his cogent attack on Rousseau published under the title Lettres de la Campagne . The gap between the theophany of the Profession de foi and the political writings, especially the Social Contract ( Julie being an intermediate case, too complex for summary discussion), is too obvious to have escaped notice and remains one of the main cruxes in Rousseau interpretation. The critical rigor of the po- litical texts contrasted with the piety of religious sentiment in the Profession de foi always again forces commentators, depend- ing on their temperament and convictions, to daemonize the former or to condescend to the latter. Thus Pierre Burgelin, in his in- troduction to the fourth volume of the Complete Works says of the discrepancies between statement and tone in the Profession that "these disparities stem from the distance between intellectual</page><page sequence="4">53&lt;5 THE GEORGIA REVIEW analysis and the impulses of the heart" (CXLIII)- always and again the Schillerian dichotomy between Rousseau's Denkkraft and his Empfindlichkeit. The usual temptation arises to account for the contradictions in various empirical and thematic ways. One can argue, with all pious readings of Rousseau from Pierre- Maurice Masson to Henri Gouhier, that the movement of Rous- seau's thought tends towards religious conversion, a hypothesis that receives some support from biographical data as well as from the fact that the Nouvelle Heloise can be read so as to make conversion the central statement of the book. Or one can simply accuse Rousseau of inconsistency and dismiss the one or the other half of his schizophrenic speculations. More productively, one can consider the religious aspect of his work as an ideological superstructure resulting from the repression or sublimation of psychological or political contradictions, in a movement that runs parallel to Althusser's diagnosis of the literary sublimation of Rousseau's political confusions. Before following any of these suggestions, one should begin by establishing if, on the basis of the existing texts, the discrepancies indeed occur in such philo- sophically uninteresting ways. In the main texts, Julie, Emile and The Social Contract , religious and political elements are closely intertwined, but their relationship is far from being either peaceful or simply comprehensible. On the somewhat more specific issue of the source of legal and moral authority, the discrepancy between the Profession de foi and the Social Contract is not less striking. In political decisions having to do with conflicts between the general will and indi- vidual interests, the "inner voice" of conscience, which the Vicar held up as the source of all truth, is of no avail: "When the general will has to be consulted on a particular act . . . what will (common man) do to shelter himself from error? Will he listen to the inner voice? But this voice is said to be merely the result of judgments and feelings within the sphere of an existing society and according to the laws of this society. It can there- fore not be used to establish these laws. Moreover, if it is to be audible, none of the passions that speak louder than conscience, that cover up its timid voice and allow philosophers to claim that this voice does not exist, should have arisen in the heart of man" ( Social Contract, first version, Pléiade, III, 287). This</page><page sequence="5">PAUL DE MAN 537 same "shyness" of conscience (although it is the voice of God) is stressed in the Profession de foi (and in the letters to Sophie d'Houdetot which are closely connected to the Profession ): "Consciousness is shy, it loves retreat and peace. . and, in the long run, it can even fall silent altogether: "It no longer speaks to us or answers us, and when we have despised it so long, it becomes as difficult for us to call it back as it was to banish it" (601). At other times, however, the same voice can be so loud that only the deaf fail to hear it: "(The materialists) are deaf to the inner voice that cries out to them in a tone that is difficult to ignore: A machine does not think. . (585). A great deal of ambivalence, historical, metaphorical and logical, thus blurs a point that, according to all students of Rousseau, is crucially important in the interpretation of his thought. Indeed, the entire question of the relationship between the general will and particular volition, between public and private morality ( Letter to Franquières) , between public and private well-being ( Du bonheur public ), between the theological and the political order, hinges upon the uncanny timidity of the divine voice. Is God timid because he is so exquisitely sensitive or because he is not himself quite certain of what he has to say? There certainly is nothing timid about the laws which are sup- posed to be dictated by this voice and which confer, for example, the right of life and death over individuals ( Social Contract , II, chapter 5). It is difficult to see how Pierre Burgelin, as one instance among others, can slide so easily over the difficulties. Having to account for a similar discrepancy between the first and the second version of the Social Contract on the source of legal authority, he writes: "These two texts seem to contradict each other. But this is not the case: universal justice originates in reason enlightened by God (by conscience), and it only be- comes applicable in the law. Thus the law changes from being a celestial voice to the condition of its applicability; the celestial voice is transferred to moral consciousness and finally to God" (1562). Burgelin moves from God to "voice," from divine voice to human conscience, from human conscience to practical moral- ity, from morality to political law, in a sequence of mediations threatened at all points by numberless aberrations. For a mind as distrustful as Rousseau's, little inclined to have faith in any</page><page sequence="6">538 THE GEORGIA REVIEW voice including his own, it seems unlikely that such a chain of displacements could be mastered without further complications. The mere juxtaposition of explicit statements or the recourse to extra-textual causal explanations does nothing to resolve the difficulties. Since the question focuses precisely on the possible understanding or misunderstanding of voices that restate other voices, meanings that reread or rewrite other meanings, the reading of the Profession de foi should be less monological than has been the case, with very few exceptions, in the interpretation of Rousseau's religious and political writings. It is obvious, for example, that none of the passages so frequently quoted from the Profession as evidence for Rousseau's theistic convictions are spoken by Rousseau himself, but by a fictional character, whose "voice" does not necessarily coincide with the author's; the same is true, of course, in Julie's letters. In the case of a so-called work of fiction, the observation is almost too self-evident to be necessary; no one will, without further question, simply equate Proust with Marcel or Flaubert with Emma Bovary. But in a discursive text like the Profession de foi, the use of a fictional spokesman, if it is noticed at all, is explained empirically as an alibi to shelter the writer from reprisals for his subversive opinions, a real enough problem in the case of Emile. Yet the presence of a fictional narrator is also a rhetorical necessity in any dis- course that puts the truth or falsehood of its own statement in question. More still than epics or novels, discursive texts are necessarily dialogical- which implies, among other things, that they cannot be quoted without first having been read. The unwarranted separation between the way of reading and inter- preting "literary" as opposed to "philosophical" or discursive texts- a separation due in large measure to ideologies derived from the misuse of aesthetic categories- deprives the reading of philosophical texts of elementary refinements that are taken for granted in literary interpretation. Paradoxically enough, this seems to happen even more clearly in the case of rhetorically self-conscious writers like Plato, Rousseau, or Nietzsche than in that of more formally technical philosophers. The quotations that support the reading of the Profession de foi as a defense of natural religion frame an extended argument, one of the most sustained philosophical developments in the</page><page sequence="7">PAUL DE MAN 539 entire Rousseau corpus (567-606). The argument is in part polemical and primarily directed, as is well known, against Helvetius's De l'esprit, the article "Evidence" in the Encyclopédie, and, beyond that, the orthodoxy of a materialistic interpretation of nature associated with the works of Buffon, d'Holbach, Maupertuis, la Mettrie and certain aspects of Diderot. The place of the Profession de foi in the intellectual history of the eighteenth century, as a belated Cartesian text that resists both the Spinozistic and experiential trends of the times, has been well documented and concerns us here only on the first level of understanding. Indispensable as they are, such historical considerations have been an obstacle to the reading of the Profession, if only because they promote a tendency to oppose the sentimentalism of the pious passages to the rigor of enlightened rationalism and thus impose upon the text a binary system of valorization that is alien to its structure. The argument of the Profession de foi begins (567) in Mon- taigne rather than in Descartes, in a condition of radical doubt that is more empirical than epistemological. As is consistently the case in Rousseau, the reduction to a condition of mere self- presence, be it as an individual consciousness or, as in the Essai sur Vorigine des langues, as a political society, does not result in a constitutive cogito. It is a moment of genuine and intolerable confusion that allows for no statement other than its own in- tolerability. Consequently, it is more likely than any other moment to lead astray: tortured by doubt "(the human mind) would rather be mistaken than believe nothing" (568). But since the original confusion is itself caused by error, by the inaccessibility of truth ("I love truth, I search for it but fail to recognize it . . ." [567]), the addition of more error to an existing state of aberration is not likely to improve things. The invocation of Descartes' name (567) has from the outset placed upon the argument an epistemological burden that makes it im- possible to valorize such terms as "error" or "illusion" in a positive way. Rousseau can then reiterate the classical gesture of a tabula rasa and reject all existing wisdom as the product of mere conceit. But whereas this gesture should traditionally be a preliminary to the counterassertive integrity of self-reflection, it fails to lead, in this case, to any such assurance. The only</page><page sequence="8">540 THE GEORGIA REVIEW claim made for the "inner light" that the mind is able to throw upon its powers is a dubious, unfounded hope for a lesser evil, entirely unable to resolve the condition of uncertainty that en- gendered the mental activity in the first place: "... I must follow the inner light, it will mislead me less than (the philoso- phers) do, or at least my error will be my own, and I shall be less perverted if I follow my illusions than if I believe their lies" (569). The shift to ethical valorization (" me dépraver"), suggesting that the distinction between "illusion" and "lie" is primarily a question of Rousseau's good faith as opposed to the false pride of the "philosophes," is at the very least premature since, at this point, the question at issue is one of truth and falsehood and not of good and evil. Rousseau never claimed that good faith suffices to give authority of truth to a statement or a knowledge. Neither does he claim it here. Still guided by the same valori- zation that privileges inside conviction over outside opinion, a polarity that has been introduced by the conventional rejection of all received knowledge as coming from "outside," we glide without discontinuity from sight to sound (from light to voice) and are told to follow иГ assentiment intérieur " (569) in accepting or rejecting the results of our attempts at understanding. Does this "inner assent" then acquire the paradigmatic quality of a Cartesian cogito as the foundation of judgment? This is hardly the case, for the description of its workings indicates that the "inner assent" operates only with regard to "ideas" that have themselves been identified (i. е., understood) by means of an act of judgment that has nothing to do with an immanent assent: "Then, turning over in my mind the various opinions that had successively swayed me since my birth, I saw that. . . my inner assent was given to them or withheld from them in varying degrees. Having made this observation, I compared all those different ideas without prejudice and found that the first and most common was also the simplest and most sensible. . ." (569). To compare is, for Rousseau, the distinctive quality of judgment, thus making it clear that the inner assent is itself dependent on a prior act of judgment which it does not control. The structure of the argument is in fact more deceptive, for the "first and most common idea" is identified as being precisely the theistic</page><page sequence="9">PAULDEMAN 541 claim for the immanent authority of conscience, an article of faith here stated allusively by reference to the name of Samuel Clarke. The only thing to which the "inner assent" assents is itself; it sets up a tautological structure devoid of the deductive power inherent in a Cartesian copto. It is true that we are being advised, in the next paragraph (570), to decide upon the truth of further units of knowledge deductively, by ascertaining their "necessary link" with the original evidence of the inner assent. But this apparent deduction is an illusion, since the necessity of the link can only be verified by means of the same rule of evidence that established the validity of the original principle and thus infinitely repeats itself without modification: assentio ergo as- sentio, etc.- unless one makes the principle of verification into an independent act of judgment (as was already the case in postulating the possibility of comparing ideas), but then the evidence of immanence is no longer the "first." Regardless of how one construes the passage, it indicates that the principle of immanence is in fact being superseded by an act of judgment which does not necessarily claim to possess the constitutive or generative power of a copto. In this respect, the Profession de foi may well be a pre-Kantian rather than a neo-Cartesian text. For, despite the apparent confusion of its point of departure, it is not in fact confused by its own inconsistencies. It immediately draws the correct inferences from difficulties that could well have paralyzed the argument from the outset. The problem now becomes, not how to construe an interpretation of existence by means of a rule of inner assent, but to account, by a critical act of judgment, for the occurrence of such an assent and to establish its epistemologica! status. Rousseau acknowledges at once the indeterminacy of his own self-reflection by moving into a critical vocabulary: "But who am I? What right do I have to judge things and what determines my judgments? If they are forced upon me by the impressions I receive, it is futile for me to expend my energy in such inquiry, because they will not occur, or will occur on their own, without any effort on my part to control them. First, therefore, I must examine myself to come to know the instrument I intend to use and learn the extent to which I can rely on it" (570). The main informing concept of this text is that of judgment, not inner light or inner assent. The</page><page sequence="10">542 THE GEORGIA REVIEW argument of the Profession de foi serves to reveal the structure of judgment in Rousseau and to establish its relationship to other key concepts such as will, freedom, reason, etc. The structure of judgment, in this text, is established by opposition to that of sensation or perception. Moreover, what will be said about judgment will apply, albeit with a different and independently interesting thematic content, to three con- cepts shown to be correlatives of judgment: will, reason or intelligence, and freedom. No inherent priority or genetic link exists between the four terms (judgment, will, reason, and free- dom) and it seems that the decision to start out the argument in terms of judgment is to a large extent arbitrary. They form a coherent conceptual chain in which each term can be derived from the other at will: "If I am asked what cause determines my i vili, I ask in turn what cause determines my judgment-. for it is clear that those two causes are one. If we realize that man is active in his judgment and that his intelligence is only the power of comparing and judging, we see that his freedom is only a similar power, or one derived from it. He chooses good as he chooses truth; if his judgment is false, his choice is wrong. What, then, is the cause that determines his will? It is his judg- ment. And what is the cause that determines his judgment? It is his faculty of intelligence, his power to judge. . ." (586, my italics) . Rousseau's theory of judgment restates, though in a less oblique and bewildering manner, the critical theory of metaphor that underlies the argument of the Second Discourse. Judgment is described as the deconstruction of sensation, a model that divides the world into a binary system of oppositions organized along an inside/outside axis and then proceeds to exchange the proper- ties on both sides of this axis on the basis of analogies and potential identities. The systems conceived by the contemporaries against whom Rousseau polemicizes are all structured according to this fundamentally metaphorical pattern: by means of empirical con- siderations on the nature of perception, they oppose body to soul, sensation to judgment, nature to mind (or art), res extensa to res cogito, outside to inside, death to life, and then reconcile the antinomies with varying degrees of dialectical rigor. For example, in the hylozoistic vision of a biologically alive matter,</page><page sequence="11">PAUL DE MAN 543 even death and life can be reconciled: to see the natural world as a live animal is to push to its limit, as Diderot will ironically suggest in De Г interprétation de la nature (LVIII), the meta- phorical model of an inside/outside correspondence. Rousseau, in the discussion of judgment, categorically rejects the unwar- ranted totalization of metaphorized synecdoches: "Yet this visible universe consists of matter, scattered and dead matter, which as a whole has none of the cohesion, organization or the common feeling of the parts of a living body, for it is certain that we, who are parts, have no feeling of ourselves in the whole" (575, my italics). Sensation unadulterated by judgment is in fact incon- ceivable, but if it is posited hypothetically (as the state of nature is posited in the Second Discourse), it is totally incapable of setting up any relationship between entities or of setting up entities in the first place. It would not be adequate to call the rhetorical structure of such a world of pure sensation métonymie rather than metaphorical, since such a structure could not even conceive of contiguity, let alone of resemblance. Rousseau writes as if he admitted the existence of an inside /outside polarity ("I therefore clearly understand that a sensation, which is inside me, and its cause or object, which is outside me, are not the same thing" [571]), but this " hors de mo i" is then so entirely devoid of any semblance of coherence or signification as to be nothing at all, for us or in itself. To a pure sensation, it would appear entirely chaotic, contingent and unpredictable, much more so even than the picture of the organic world gone awry that Diderot conjures up in the Lettre sur les aveugles. A universe of pure sensation would be unable to conceive of ratio or of number: "Such comparative ideas as 'larger' or 'smaller' and the numerical ideas of 'one,' 'two',' etc., are certainly not sensa- tions, even though they are always accompanied by sensations when my mind produces them" (572). Pure "outsideness" is the only discontinuity that articulates even the smoothest appear- ance of identity, since it cannot be said that the sensation of a given entity in X is identical with the sensation of the same entity in Y: "When the sensations are different, the sentient being distinguishes them by their differences; when they are alike, it distinguishes them because it feels that the one is outside the other ( hors des autres)" (572, my italics). Spatial models-</page><page sequence="12">544 THE GEORGIA REVIEW and the same would have to apply to temporal models- are meta- phorical conceptualizations of differential structures, which is why they engender such redoubtably effective and misleading powers of unification and categorization. Rousseau, however, in- troduces outsideness (with its implicit train of spatial and temporal correlatives) as a principle of differentiation that could never legitimately be made to function in the opposite direction: the "outside" in the sentence just quoted is not the outside of a cor- responding inside. In the mode of pure sensation, everything is "outside" everything else; there is nothing but outside differences and no in-tegration is possible. This version of differentiation is similar to the distinction made in the Second Discourse, also on the basis of difference and re- semblance, between denomination and conceptualization. The act of judgment coincides with the ability to postulate relationships, the possibility of elaborating systems based on the correlation of differential with integrative moments. This activity is called "to compare" or, more explicitly, "to place one (object) over another to pronounce on their difference or on their similarity" (571). The process is a manipulation, a displacement that upsets the "truth" of things as they are, for sensation, unlike judgment, is truthful to the extent that it leaves things in their proper places and does not even conceive of making what is distinct identical: "By sensation, objects are presented to me as separate, isolated, as they are in nature. . ." (571) and therefore "I know only that truth is in things, not in the mind that judges them, and that the less of myself I put into my judgments of them, the surer I am to approach truth. . ." (573). Since judgment is also associated with what, in this same paragraph, is called "the honor of thinking," it follows that thought and truth are not necessarily coextensive notions. Judgment, also called "attention," "meditation," "reflection," or "thought" {pensée), and always described by verbs of motion such as to move, to transport, to fold (replier), neither reveals things for what they are nor leaves them undisturbed. It moves them around, thus mimicking the etymology of the very term metaphor, of the Aristotelian epiphora : "in comparing (objects), I move and transpose them, so to speak, I place one over another. . (571). Judgment does this in order to create systems</page><page sequence="13">PAULDEMAN 545 of relationship that are not substantial but merely structural; from a formal point of view, these systems are by no means arbitrary but since they are devoid of ontological authority, they are not controlled by considerations of truth and falsehood. Therefore, they are capable of errors which they make pos- sible by their very existence: "Why then am I mistaken about the relation between these two sticks, especially when they are not parallel?. . . Why is the image, which is the sensation, unlike its model, which is the object? Because I am active when I judge, and the operation of comparison is faulty; in judging relations, my understanding mingles its errors with the truth of sensations, which show only objects" (572). The falsehood does not have a contingent cause that could be corrected by trial and error, by experimental or methodological refinements, since the act of thought is itself, by its very manifestation, a falsification. The pattern of this falsification is the same as that of the concept in the Second Discourse : it uses structural resemblances in order to conceal the differences that permit the very articulations of structure. The consistency, or repetitiveness, of Rousseau's thought on this point, reduces the polemics of the Profession de foi against the philosophes to a secondary function. The disagreement with Helvetius, la Mettrie, and to a lesser extent, Diderot, repeats the earlier disagreement with Condillac and the tradition of Locke on the origin of language. It is a central insight of Rousseau that never varies throughout the work and that finds its first sys- tematic expression in the section on language in the Second Discourse and in the Essay on the Origins of Language. The same rhetorical deconstruction determines the disjunction between judg- ment and sensation in the Profession de foi and that between the noun and the concept in the earlier texts. And the equation of judgment with language is hardly less clear in the later theologi- cal than in the earlier political text: it is asserted in a single sentence, when it is said of judgment that "In my opinion, the distinctive faculty of an active or intelligent being is the ability to give meaning to the word 'to be'" (571). The ambivalence of judgment stands fully revealed in this sentence. The stability of the natural world is by itself devoid of meaning and cannot become a source of knowledge. Being is</page><page sequence="14">546 THE GEORGIA REVIEW for us only "the word 'to be' and the copula has no transcen- dental referent by natural or divine right. This negative insight, achieved in the differentiation between judgment and sensation, is itself an act of judgment and this act is verbal. Terms such as "to move" or "to fold" are replaced by such verbs as "to pro- nounce" or "to give meaning," thus implying that the verb "to be," as matrix of all referential language, has no proper meaning by itself. The scene of judgment is that of a verbal pronounce- ment and that of an oracular verdict. But after having thus un- done any possible association between relation and necessity, the same judgment then proceeds to do, in its own name, what it had undone in the name of sensation, and to set up structures, such as concepts, which lay claim to meaning in the same way that sensation could lay claim to the existence of matter and reality: "Thus not only do I exist, but other entities exist also, namely, the objects of my sensations. . . (which) I call matter. . ." (571). Like language, judgment engenders the same possibility of reference that it also excises. Its error can therefore not be localized or identified in any way; one could not, for example, say that the error stems from language, as if language were an entity that existed independently of judgment or judgment a faculty that could exercize its activity in a non-linguistic mode. To the extent that judgment is a structure of relationships capable of error, it is also language. As such, it is bound to consist of the very figurai structures that can only be put in question by means of the language that produces them. What is then called "language" clearly has to extend well beyond what is empirically understood as articulated verbal utterance and subsumes, for in- stance, what is traditionally referred to as perception. This becomes apparent in Rousseau's treatment of the Lockean problem of Molyneux and the sensus communion, a recurrent question in eighteenth-century philosophy of perception. The Profession de foi distinguishes between sensation and perception as Rousseau distinguishes elsewhere between verbal and non- verbal drives ("passions" and "besoins"): "If we were purely passive in the use of our senses, there would be no communication among them; it would be impossible for us to know that the object we touch and the object we see are the same. Either we would never be aware of anything outside ourselves, or there</page><page sequence="15">PAUL DE MAN 547 would be for us five perceptible substances whose identity we would have no means of perceiving" (573). The unity of per- ception is an act of judgment which, as such, denies that the totalization of perception could be rooted in an exchange of properties held in common by mind and matter. While denying therefore that perception could ever be an access to true know- ledge, the passage acknowledges that it is structured like a metaphor and thus must be considered as an act of judgment or a language. The term "language" thus includes that of per- ception or sensation, implying that understanding can no longer be modeled on or derived from the experience of the senses; in this respect, the Profession de foi occupies a pivotal position in the complex history of the relationships between empirical psy- chology and theories of language in the eighteenth century. We can conclude that the vicar describes judgment as the power to set up potentially aberrant referential systems that deconstruct the referentiality of their own elaboration. This description war- rants the equation of judgment with figurai language, extensively conceived. Different versions of the same aporia organize the description of the related concepts of will, mind, and freedom. In the dis- cussion of the will (576-578), the polemical argument against Toland and la Mettrie denying the immanence of motion within matter and defining the will as the transcendental cause of all motion, reintroduces the inside/outside structure that was also adopted at the beginning of the description of judgment. Just as the vicar begins by sounding like an orthodox disciple of Locke when he asserts the truth-value of sensation, he sounds like an orthodox disciple of Fénelon in asserting the need to postulate a transcendental primwn mobile. The transcendental outside structure becomes productive however (and potentially aberrant) only when it is conceived as a polarity rather than a mere positional relationship, that is, from the moment that a principle of articulation connects an inside with this outside in a way that allows for the exchange of properties. In the midst of so many borrowed arguments and philosophical commonplaces about the transcendental will, the specificity of Rousseau's thought manifests itself in the sudden refusal to grant intelli- gibility to the principle of articulation on which the possibility</page><page sequence="16">548 THE GEORGIA REVIEW of understanding depends: "It is no more possible for me to conceive how my will moves my body than how my sensations affect my soul. I do not even know why one of those mysteries has seemed more explainable than the other. As for me, either when I am passive or when I am active, the means of uniting the two substances seems completely incomprehensible to me. It is strange that others take that very incomprehensibility as their point of departure for combining the two substances, as though operations so different in nature could be better explained in one subject than in two" (576). What are here called incom- prehensible are precisely such notions as analogy, resemblance, sympathy, or even proximity which are the ground of under- standing and which the rationalistic and theistic eighteenth century was trying to reclaim. Far from clarifying the obscure link between will and motion by means of the apparently more verifiable (because easier to observe and to quantify) link between matter and mind (or body and soul), the vicar lets the darkness of the former encroach upon the latter. We know as little about the (outside) sensation becoming (inside) affect or consciousness as about the (inside) will becoming (outside) motion. As a mat- ter of fact, the individual will is unable ever to get outside itself and to establish a corresponding principle of exteriority: "I know the will only through the feeling of my own will, and intelligence {entendement) is not better known to me" (586). This does not imply that judgment is enigmatic because, like the will, it can be metaphorically represented in the guise of a self; it merely states that judgment is as enigmatic as the will, though the mode of indeterminacy or undecidability may vary depending on whether one considers the aporia from a voluntaristic or from an epistemological point of view. The patterns of error engen- dered by the will are not the same as those engendered by judgment, since both produce their own referential systems, and are commonly in error only to the extent that referentiality is itself their error. The referent produced specifically by the will is that of selfhood, which is open to the same deconstructive ambivalence as the more general meaning derived from judgment. The explicit linkage of judgment with error thus extends to the idea of selfhood, product of the same metaphorical illusion of proper meaning as the relational constructs of judgment.</page><page sequence="17">PAUL DE MAN 549 The combination of judgment with the will engenders in turn the mental activity here called intelligence. But the more we advance in the degree of conceptualization associated with each of these terms- the text being set up in such a way that, as we move from judgment to will to intelligence and finally to free- dom, we are further and further removed from the critical deconstruction that established the epistemological ambivalence of judgment at the outset- the more the aporia, still quite clearly thematized in the analysis of judgment, becomes embedded within the texture of the narrative, to the point of making the text into the dramatization of its own confusions. Examples abound, especially in the closely linked discussions of intelligence, as the systematic assertion of the power to will, and of freedom. It is in these pages (from 577 to 606) that the strongest statements in support of Rousseau's theistic orthodoxy occur: the awe ex- pressed before the deity as a principle of natural harmony and order, pietistic statements about the innate virtue of a divine omnipresence, the definition of moral conscience as innate: "There is thus within our souls an innate principle of justice and virtue by which, in spite of our maxims, we judge our acts and those of others as good or bad, and it is this principle that I call con- science" (598). One should bear in mind that these assertions occur within a context in which the concepts that are being described are consistently equated with acts of judgment (as when it is said, in the above quotation, that "we judge our acts and those of others. . .") which have been shown to be consti- tutively associated with aberrant totalization. And one should also notice that each of these affirmations of piety and trust is always coupled, sometimes explicitly, sometimes by im- plication, with a statement that puts it in question. For instance, when the vicar wishes to oppose intelligence to sheer random chance, he chooses a literary text as a model for analogy. Such a text could never be the contingent result of infinitely combining the letters of the alphabet: "If I were told that printer's type had been thrown at random and the letters fallen in such a way as to spell out the entire Aeneid, I would not deign to take one step to investigate that falsehood" (579). The statement comes in fact a lot closer to the sentence of Mallarmé which seems to be saying the reverse ( Jamais un coup de dés n'abolira le hasard ),</page><page sequence="18">550 THE GEORGIA REVIEW if one takes into account that, for the "author" of the Preface to the Nouvelle Héloise, the intentionality ("imité ďintention," 580) of a literary text is so undecidable that no writer can be certain of his own authorship. If God is to be present to his own creation in the same manner that a writer is present to his text, this leaves very little authority to the divine intelligence. The Profession de foi can therefore posit itself, so to speak, on both sides of the position taken by Diderot in the Lettre sur les aveugles with regard to the element of chance involved in the creation of the organic world: the natural world is here much more radically contingent, disjointed, and inarticulated than the floating organs Diderot and la Mettrie are so fond of evoking, but, on the other hand, the model of a combinatory system with a very large number of elements seems equally inadequate as an analogy for the workings of the mind. The ability of the mind to set up, by means of acts of judgment, formally coherent structures is never denied, but the ontological or epistemological authority of the resulting systems, like that of texts, escapes determination. More explicit instances of controlled contradiction also ap- pear in this section of the Profession de foi. They are dramatically emphasized in the contrast between the harmony of a universe conceived as a teleological system without known endpoint (580), or the glorification of man as "king of the earth" (582) and on the other hand the utter misery of the human mind incapable of understanding the principles of its own working and torn apart by the contradictions of its condition: "Feeling myself swayed and torn by those two conflicting tendencies, I said to myself, 'No, man is not one; I both exert my will and fail to exert it; I feel both enslaved and free; I see what is good, I love it, and I do evil, etc.'" (583). The contradiction comes fully into view in the way the vicar conceives of God. Since he rejects any idea of unmediated revelation, the idea of God is derived, by analogical extension, from the attributes of human judgment, and not of nature (for whenever he considers the possibility of patterning the relationship between God and man on that between man and nature, or subject and object, he rejects the possibility by means of arguments derived from the distinction between judgment and sensation). Therefore divine</page><page sequence="19">PAUL DE MAN 5 5 1 activity is described by the same terms that were used to define judgment: "Acting, comparing, and choosing are operations of an active and thinking being; therefore that being exists. . ." (578); "The being who has both will and power, who is active of himself, who moves the universe and orders all things, that being, whatever he may be, I call God. I add to that name the ideas of intelligence, power, and will. . ." (581). The mind of God and the mind of man resemble each other; man and God are each other's metaphor. Hence the fact that they can be sub- stituted at will: God can be said, for example, to want man's good in his stead, and man's freedom to err is accounted for as his opportunity to prove himself equal to a divine principle that shares this freedom with him (587). Hence also that the relation- ship between man and God can be called love: "I worship (adore) this supreme power and I am touched by his kindness. ... Is it not a natural consequence of our self-love to honor what pro- tects us and to love what wants our good?" (583). Like the wild metaphor "giant" which, in the Essay on the Origins of Language , becomes "man," the spontaneous metaphor "God" can then be institutionalized and quantified into a contractual relationship in which God is said to owe something to man, and to pay him for the price of the labors accomplished in his behalf. The pro- or regression from love to economic dependence is a constant characteristic of all moral or social systems based on the authority of non-contested metaphorical systems. On the other hand, however, this God who is so much like us turns out to be as completely alien, unknowable, and "outside" as a pure sensation is before it has been organized by judgment: ". . . as soon as I try to contemplate (God) in himself, as soon as I try to discover where he is, what he is, what his substance is, he eludes me and my troubled mind no longer perceives anything" (581). When combined with all the previous passages on the indeterminacy of judgment and on its irresistible ten- dency to see seductive similarities where they do not exist, this passage is not at all similar to the kind of theological humility one would find, for example, in Malebranche. The manner in which God is said to be incomprehensible in his relation to his own being is precisely the same as that in which he is made all too comprehensible in his relation to man; the mystery of the</page><page sequence="20">552 THE GEORGIA REVIEW parousia is not compatible with that of a divine presence showing itself providentially concerned as the voice of an individual moral conscience. One is reminded of Kant in the Critique of Judgment-. "If one can call a mere representation a cognition, then all our knowledge of God is symbolical and whoever schematizes this knowledge by means of properties such as judgment, will, etc., which demonstrate only the objective reality of earthly creatures, lapses into anthropomorphism, just as he lapses into deism if he omits all elements of intuition" (59 [257]). The logical pattern of these developments is always the same and repeats the aporia of judgment. A concept such as judgment, will, or freedom operates deconstructively as a principle of differ- entiation but then, because of the referentiality inherent in the linguistic model, reintegrates by an act of the mind what it had taken apart on the level of intuition. The correlative of this second operation, regardless of whether it be called the meaning of a judgment, the self that wills, or the God that freely invents, re- covers in its turn the attributes of (natural) existence, and can therefore again be deconstructed by the same system. The origi- nal metaphor is shown to be based on a misleading assumption of identity, but the utterance of this negative insight is itself a new metaphor that engenders its own semantic correlative, its own proper meaning: we move from sensation to judgment, for example, or from nature to God, but what appears to be a hypostasis is in fact even more vulnerable, logically speaking, than the entity it claims to supersede. A system of this type is bound to produce bewildering patterns of valorization. The text of the Profession de foi becomes indeed increasingly saturated with value judgments. It starts out (570 ff.) in a rela- tively detached and analytical mode but, as the argument progresses, it modulates towards highly theatrical oratorical effects. There is a corresponding shift from the relatively "cold" values of truth and falsehood (which become values only because of the possibility of error) to the more turgid values of good and evil. The dynamic emphasis was present from the start, since judgment is consistently being described as an act and as a power ( puissance ). From the moment, however, that one reaches such metaphors as the will, that allow for the localization of the active principle within par- ticular entities (such as the self), the tension is bound to increase:</page><page sequence="21">PAUL DE MAN 553 the incomprehensibility of the link between will and motion problematizes the relationship between the intent and the direction of the movement, and the solipsistic immanence of the will ("I know the will only through the feeling of my own will. . .") threatens the very possibility of motion with paralysis. The binary inside/outside pattern, which could be considered as a merely spatial organization without implying valorization, is now acti- vated by a play of resistances and impulses; from being epistemo- logical, the language of the Profession de foi becomes ethical. But since the "prime mover" of judgment is aberrant and represents as a deliberate movement what is, in fact, a suspended inability to know whether or where it should go (and is thus, in truth neither "prime" nor "mover"), the system of valorization that links the modalities of judgment to the values of the will can never be consistent. Aberrations of moral judgment are a consequence of epistemological and rhetorical indéterminations. The Profession de foi acts out this inconsistent transformation of structures into values. The referentiality inherent in judgment becomes more and more manifest and moves the text closer and closer to a world of practical reason which will finally end up in political realities. The theistic orthodoxy always associated the structures of inwardness and exteriority with the values of good and evil by linking inside with good and outside with evil. The positive valorization of inwardness is part of the historical tradition of pietism out of which Rousseau is writing. One remembers the vicar's exhortation: "Let us look into ourselves ( Rentrons en nous- mêmes ), my young friend. . . ." Inwardness is the metaphor of virtue, and vice-versa. But the text fails to respect the necessity of this linkage and it crosses and uncrosses the system established by the inside/outside and the good/evil polarities at will. We are told, for instance, that "As I meditated on the nature of man, I seemed to discover two distinct principles in him. The first elevated him to the study of eternal truths, to love of justice and moral beauty, to those realms of the intellectual world that the wise delight in contemplating. The second drew him downward into himself, subjected him to the power of his senses and the pas- sions that are their ministers, and counteracted, through them, everything inspired in him by the first principle" (583, my italics). More explicitly still, a few pages later, evil is again directly</page><page sequence="22">554 THE GEORGIA REVIEW associated with inwardness and, by implication, the love of beauty and of virtue directed towards the outside: "If you take away from our hearts that love of what is beautiful, you will take away all the charm of life. A man whose vile passions have stifled those exquisite feelings in his narrow soul, and who, by focussing all his attention within himself (au dedans de lui), has come to love no one but himself, is no longer enraptured by anything, . . . such a wretched man no longer feels or lives; he is already dead" (596, my italics). Yet, separated from this passage by only one para- graph, the following statement again reverses the pattern: "The wicked man fears and avoids himself; he lifts his spirits by going outside himself; he looks around him with anxiety, seeking some- thing that will divert him . . . derisive laughter is his only pleasure. The virtuous man, however, finds serenity within himself; there is no malice in his laughter, but only joy, and the source of that joy is in himself ; he is as cheerful alone as in company; he does not draw his contentment from those around him: he communi- cates it to them" (597, my italics). One can argue, of course, that, psychologically speaking, there can just as well be a "bad" as a "good" inwardness. But this has little bearing upon a text that is not set up along psychological lines but structured by means of a differential inside/outside axis; in such a text, the values associated with these two dimensions will necessarily carry a deci- sive exegetic weight. The occurrence of such systematic value-displacements thus acquires central importance in the reading of the Profession de foi. They are not simply chiasmic reversals allowing the (inside) good to be called "evil" and the (outside) evil to be called "good." The system is not symmetrical, since it postulated, from the start, the non-identity of inside and outside, the "supplementarity" of the one with regard to the other. On the level of judgment, the asymmetry leads to the play of contradictions and paradoxes, the logical tensions that have earned Rousseau the frequent accusa- tion of sophistry. Deconstructive readings can point out the unwarranted identifications achieved by substitution, but they are powerless to prevent their recurrence even in their own discourse, and to uncross, so to speak, the aberrant exchanges that have taken place. Their gesture merely reiterates the rhetorical defiguration that caused the error in the first place. They leave a margin of</page><page sequence="23">PAUL DE MAN 555 error, a residue of logical tension that prevents the closure of the deconstructive discourse and accounts for its narrative and alle- gorical mode. When this process is described in terms of will or freedom and thus transferred to the level of reference, the differ- ential residue is bound to become manifest as an empirical awareness that affects and indeed constitutes a world in which it now appears to be "taking place"; a mind, a consciousness, a self. The abstract attributes of truth and falsehood grow more and more concrete and find themselves a place, a stage on which to act out the temporal sequence of their occurrence. Judgment becomes a "spectacle" (596), a pathetic action that affects us like a theatrical representation. Trying to persuade his interlocutor of the quality of virtue, the vicar resorts as by instinct to analogies from the theatre: "When you see a play, which characters win your sym- pathy?" (596), he asks. As the confusion between structure and value increases, the tone and the terminology of the text glide almost imperceptibly from the language of judgement to the language of the affections, and judgment finally openly declares itself to be another name for " sentiment " (still distinct, at this point, from " sensation against which, it will be remembered, judgment was originally defined). The ambiguously valorized "inner" world of consciousness, of which it can no longer be said whether it is the seat of good or evil, becomes the affective space engendered by this ethical indecisiveness: "The acts of our conscience are not judgments, but feelings. Although all our ideas come from outside us, the feelings that evaluate them are inside ourselves, and it is solely by those feelings that we know the fitness or unfitness that exists between us and those things which we must respect or shun" (599). The principle of valorization according to which this evaluation can be carried out has itself to become increasingly literal. The eudaemonic polarity of pleasure and pain replaces the moral polar- ity of good and evil. The text behaves as if, at this point (599), the question that had opened up its entire inquiry had been decisively answered. We are now supposed to know the answer to the critical "But who am I?" (570) that was to sanction the re- course to immanent evidence in the understanding of our being- in-the-world. What has in fact been established is the gradual loss of authority of any immanent judgment or any immanent</page><page sequence="24">556 THE GEORGIA REVIEW value whatsoever. At the same time, and by means of the same argument, the alternative recourse to a transcendental source of authority, such as nature, or God, has also been definitively foreclosed. The aporia of truth and falsehood has turned into the confusion of good and evil and ended up in an entirely arbitrary valorization in terms of pain and pleasure. Virtue be- comes finally justified in terms of an erotic pleasure principle, a moral libido that seems not easily compatible with the piety of the inner voice of conscience but that consistently acts out the rhetorical system of the text. The turn towards eudaemonic valorization is more apparent, for obvious reasons, in the so called Lettres morales addressed by Rousseau to Sophie d'Houdetot, a text that is ancillary to the Profession de foi and that dates from 1757. In this text, virtue is spoken of in terms of a narcissistic economy of personal well-being, accessible only to those who can afford a great deal of leisure: "Every month, take a span of two or three days away from your pleasures and your business, and devote it to the most important task of all. ... I don't expect you to concentrate from the start on profound meditations, I only insist that you keep your soul in a state of quiet languor that will allow it to turn inward upon itself and to exclude whatever is alien to its own being. In that state, you may ask, what will I do? Nothing at all. Just let natural unrest take over; in solitude, it will not take long to manifest itself, whether we want it or not. . . . Just as one rewarms a numbed part of the body by rubbing it delicately, so the soul, numbed by a long state of inaction, revives in the gentle warmth of a well-tempered motion. . . . One must remind it of the affections that have caused it pleasure, but not by ways of the senses; it must happen by the proper feelings and by intellec- tual pleasures. . . . Whatever state the soul may be in, a feeling of pleasure at doing the right thing remains and serves as a foothold for all other virtues. It is by cultivating this feeling that one comes to love and to find pleasure in one's own com- pany" (11 15-16). The language of self-seduction is less obvious in the mouth of the vicar, but he is saying nothing else when virtue is called "the charm of life" (596) or "the pure volup- tuousness born from self-satisfaction" (591). The point is not that the foundation of moral judgment in</page><page sequence="25">PAUL DE MAN 557 the pleasure principle is in any way ethically or psychologically wrong. Such returns to the physiological foundations of the notions of right and wrong are not at all surprising in the century of morale sensitive , nor for that matter in any other century; without even having recourse to Freud, we can refer, for in- stance, to the importance given by Nietzsche to the pleasure/ pain polarity in his critique of metaphysical concepts. What matters here is that the reintroduction of these notions, at this point in the Profession de foi, illustrates the viciously circular (in the Nietzschean sense) structure of Rousseau's theological discourse. For he has no illusions about the consistency of eudae- monic systems of valorization. The association of virtue with pleasure (as in the text from the Lettres morales that has just been quoted) can at once be reversed and the self-love turn into the amour-propre which is at the base of bad faith and of bad judgment: "The practice of virtue naturally flatters our vanity ( amour-propre ) by an idea of superiority. We remember good deeds as proof that we have the strength to satisfy even the needs of others after our own needs have been fulfilled. This feeling of power ( puissance ) makes life more pleasant and makes us co-habitate more easily with ourselves" (11 16). But the ambivalence of this will-to-power morality is not the main complication of our text. The sliding pro- or regression from judgment to feeling, from epistemology to eudaemony, a motion which takes place entirely within the conceptual system that constitutes the text of the Profession de foi and is therefore accounted for, at all times, by its logic, requires, as a thematic assertion, the necessary reintroduction of the rhetorical struc- ture that was explicitly banned at the start. The serpent bites its own tail. The vicar has to reaffirm, at the end of his argument, the priority of the category against which his argument has been consistently directed. He has to restate his belief in the metaphorical analogy between mind and nature: ". . . we feel before we know, and just as we do not learn to will our own good and avoid what is harmful to us, but receive that will from nature, love of good and hatred of evil are as natural to us as self-love" (599). The equation of will with nature is precisely what the vicar's judgment persistently puts in question. Within the context of this deconstruction, the final part of this quotation</page><page sequence="26">558 THE GEORGIA REVIEW can be read ironically, since nothing could be more problematic than the naturalness of self-love, a passion which, like all passions, merely repeats the aberrations of figurai language. Nothing there- fore prevents the deconstructive labor that has brought us to this point from starting all over again. The naive historical question from which we started out- should the Profession de foi be called a theistic text?- must remain unanswerable. The text both is and is not the theistic document it is assumed to be. It is not the simple negation of the faith it seems to proclaim, since it ends up by accounting in a manner that cannot be refuted for the necessary occurrence of this faith. But it also denounces it as aberrant. A text such as the Profession de foi can literally be called "unreadable" in that it leads to a set of assertions that radically exclude each other. Nor are these assertions mere neutral constatations; they are exhortative performatives that require the passage from sheer enunciation to action. They compel us to choose while destroying the foundations of any choice. They tell the allegory of a judi- cial decision that can be neither judicious nor just. As in the plays of Kleist, the verdict repeats the crime it condemns. If, after reading the Profession de foi, we are tempted to convert ourselves to "theism," we stand convicted of foolishness in the court of the intellect. But if we decide that belief, in the most extensive use of the term (which must include all possible forms of idolatry and ideology) can once and forever be overcome by the enlightened mind, then this twilight of the idols will be all the more foolish in not recognizing itself as the first victim of its occurrence. One sees from this that the impossibility of reading should not be taken too lightly.</page></plain_text>
