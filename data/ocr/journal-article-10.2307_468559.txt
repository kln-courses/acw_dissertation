<plain_text><page sequence="1">Images and Words Michel Rio INTERPRETATIONS OF PAINTINGS are multiple and totally contradictory, just like the phraseologies used to express them." 1 A. Zemsz is allud- ing here to contemporary Western painting, which he opposes to the "intelligible figures" of certain other peoples; the latter figures differ from the former in that they refer to a system of signification which is unani- mously understood in the culture that produced them. We believe that it is this more or less fluctuating, more or less systematized, relationship between the image (we will not deal with sculpture here; it would require special treatment, since it is inscribed in a three-dimensional space) and the culture which gave it birth that we must first investigate in order to establish an analysis of the pictorial phenomenon. The difficulty comes later, with the hierarchization and systematization of these questions so as to posit different levels of reading (formal, his- torical, symbolic, etc.) in order to arrive at semiological analysis. In other words, one must first envisage the relationship of the linguistic and the iconic, of that which is painted and then seen (the image) with that which is said (language), whether it is a matter of language as that which constitutes thought (and thus the view of the organized world, culture), or of language as that which offers itself as a complement to or substitute for a particular image (this in turn raising the problem of difference and equivalence). One can imagine at least three general types of relationships between image and language (though these do not by any means exhaust all the possibilities). The first, fundamental type of relationship is situated at the level of cosmology, of a world view, of the culture of a society and of the iconic representations (on the optic and thematic levels) that this set of articulated concepts elaborates (this, of course, in the case where a given culture engenders an iconography). One can envision a second type of relationships in which image and language coexist in a message, are the constitutive parts of this message. A third type arises when lan- guage tries to describe, to analyze an image, to substitute itself for it (as in the case of the descriptive and critical discourse); or, on the contrary, when the image attempts to make an entire discourse visible all at once (as in the case of the illustration of a narrative). In this last case, the relationship can become related to the first type of relationship that we defined. In this third type, however, we will stress instead the first aspect</page><page sequence="2">506 NEW LITERARY HISTORY (language substituted for an image) because it brings into question, among other issues, the status of pictorial analysis. I. Constructed Space, Empirical Space "The pictorial surface is a point of contact where the spontaneous, empirical vision and the coded, 'topological' optic meet.... Painting puts signifying, cultural, mythical visibles in opposition to the natural visibles." 2 It is not a question here of determining whether certain prehistoric non- representational graphisms already delimited a metaphoric space. We can simply suspect these signs themselves of having had a symbolic signification. It does, however, seem very difficult to say whether the surface on which they were drawn was already contaminated by the sign (thereby becom- ing a symbolic space), or whether it was regarded as a simple object of the "real" (supporting a conceived, abstract, and therefore intentional sign). One can, however, suggest that, once a culture has discovered the possibility of systematizing the empirical perception of the world so as to reconstruct this world on a two-dimensional limited space (i.e., has really created symbolic, or metaphoric, space), the phenomenon of the meeting of "the empirical vision and the coded optic" (Zemsz) has taken place; the pictorial act has been manifested in its most complete expression. We say "the most complete" because there can be no value judgment (with regard to that which one calls the "work of art"--here the image) based on a logical hierarchy born of our own codes. Coherence is not located in ethnocentric definitions, but rather in the relationship between a particular work and the particular culture that created it at a given moment of its history. As soon as one speaks of pictorial reconstruction according to a coded optic, one immediately thinks of a previous decon- struction, i.e., an operation capable of decomposing a continuous universe into optic elements (a perfectly abstract, conceptual, "cultural" opera- tion). This deconstruction permits the representation (in a symbolic, or metaphoric, space) of forms delimited by line and/or color. It is the possibility of representing by means of a coded optic that gives birth and signification to the space in which this representation is inscribed (even if the virgin canvas, as an object of the world, carries within itself, already, the virtualities of metaphor, and, in a certain sense, calls for the symboliza- tion of space). This intervention of a conceptualized space naturally introduces lan- guage. Not that language, to the extent that it formulates the coded optic in a coherent and preliminary way, completely accounts for the pictorial act. Far from it.3 But it is indispensable. Therefore, it is here that a culture organizes its own coded optic through its specific way of perceiv- ing and conceiving the world, the produced image being a particular actualization of a gigantic labor of interpretation and codification of empirical perception.4 One can suggest that the relationship of the</page><page sequence="3">IMAGES AND WORDS 507 empirical vision and the coded optic, of the given space and the con- structed space, is a logical manifestation (when this manifestation occurs) of a specific culture. In all cultures with a pictorial tradition (if it is not a question of pure abstract forms), the nose or the eyes, for example, can be spotted in anthropomorphic representations. This is most likely a result of the influence on all these cultures of empirical sight. If for the moment one considers only the coded optic, the pure pictorial form, the differences are enormous and innumerable; if one excludes even the reference to the objects "nose" and "eyes" (which, for example, can be spotted by their situation in the representation), one can say that there is hardly any relationship between all these forms (although they all posit a relationship with an identical object). It is evident that culture, a community's vision of the world at a moment of its history, does not intervene just in the image in order to treat the only perceivable objects of the world systematically. Gods, monsters, figures, and scenes drawn from myths and religions, are all themes existing in representation and not in nature. The general relationship of the optics always presides to a greater or lesser extent over pictorial elaboration: the line that serves to outline on the surface the form of the horse will also serve .(as creator of the discontinuous) to isolate the form of the monster derived from the social phantasm. But the horse, even if it be approximated, idealized, or stylized to the extreme in its pictorial form, belongs simultaneously to empirical space (as an object of the real) and to constructed space (as a figuration of the horse). The monster belongs only to constructed space; it can be nothing other than its own pictorial form. It is the pure product of a particular culture, and can be identified and understood only from within that culture. It is a generally widespread error to believe that the historical develop- ment of Western painting proceeds linearly from representation of exist- ing objects, "possible" and "natural" scenes, to the monstrous distortions of forms that one "no longer recognizes." It is not because forms are no longer "natural" that one no longer recognizes these forms (they were never "natural"), however; it is because, little by little, these forms escaped from the social consensus. There has been a progressive loss of the general optic code that permitted one immediately to identify a form, while at the same time, this form has become individualized; it is linked less and less to the coherent world vision of a hierarchized, unanimous society, and more and more to that original (i.e., different within a same culture) vision of the school and of the isolated painter.5 Pictorial creation has exploded on the optic and thematic levels. During the Middle Ages, for example, themes and their expression via a coded optic were foreign to no individual who participated in the culture in which these themes developed. In such a case, artisanry (or, if you wish, the work of art) was assimilated with expression: the evidence of the representation was a guarantee of its aesthetic quality. And we know that the evidence of the optic code was not founded on its "na- turalness" or on a relationship of duplication between constructed space</page><page sequence="4">508 NEW LITERARY HISTORY and empirical real space. After the explosion of theocratic values and structures (which was also an explosion of culture, of language, the rise of individualism, the decentering of the world, the beginning of the "hidden God," to use Lucien Goldmann's term), the individual felt isolated even within his own culture. The coded optic did not change brutally and radically, but the themes expanded, varied, became unlimited. In other words, they were no longer understood by everyone. In this new Tower of Babel the code itself must inevitably be drawn into question, and constructed space also changes. The image tends to observe the world for itself, to make the coded optic and the empirical vision coincide even further. This can be seen, for example, in the rigorous fixing of the laws of perspective, which was, perhaps, a way of reconstituting an intelligible code for the collectivity after the explosion of the system on whose coherence rested the clarity of representation. Pictorial representation stressed less and less the didacticism of the themes and the way of making this didacticism enter into the image, and more and more the forms themselves, the code. When the coded optic arrived at the point where it took into consideration only its own fundamental elements (line and color) in order to construct form, thereby cutting itself off from the empirical perception of the world, the result was abstract art. This phenomenon consecrated the collectivity's loss of the keys to the pictorial code (or rather codes), the reading of which became problematic, or im- possible. This is not to say that one cannot still (relatively) spot its elements (one can always detect line and color), but the very function- ing of the code, space and form, what one could call pictorial syntax, becomes obscure. One can see the consequences at the level of criticism. Culture, good taste, historical and literary references, the notion of the beautiful and of the work of art (all things upon which the discourse on the image was based) became incapable of rendering account of this new phenomenon (abstract art) without falling into the most complete subjective arbitrari- ness. Those who believed that the image was only a simple mediator-- albeit stylized, but transparent-between the individual and the -world, had to surrender to the evidence: the image was a constructed, opaque object that must be analyzed as such, and whose codes and syntax must be discovered. As a result, there arose the necessity for a new type of systematized analysis that entered into the field of semiology. We will return to this later. II. The Message Text/Image Another possibility of relationship between the linguistic and the iconic, between language and image, is their coexistence in the same message. In an article devoted to the analysis of an advertising image,6 Roland Barthes treated this problem; he defined two functions of the linguistic</page><page sequence="5">IMAGES AND WORDS 509 with the relation to the iconic: (1) that of anchoring, and (2) that of relay. The linguistic message's anchoring function has a "repressive" value. Language is there to fix the always polysemic image's signifieds.7 It answers the question: what is it?8 A painting's title is an excellent example of anchoring. In reference to what we have said previously, the title became effectively necessary when the explosion of the image on the thematic and/or optic levels caused this image to escape to a greater or lesser extent from the collective understanding. When one looks at El Greco's portrait of Cardinal Tavera, one knows that it deals with a man, an ecclesiastic, perhaps more exactly a cardinal (from the costume), but one does not know that it deals with Tavera. When one looks at Matthieu's "Battle of Bouvines," one has no idea at all with what it deals (not Bouvines, nor even a battle). In this respect, titles have an anchoring function that is indispensable to situating the work, unless one is interested only in forms, in the coded optic. The relay function implies that the image and language are in a com- plementary relationship: language says what the image does not express. Language's relay function exists in an exemplary fashion in the cartoon, for example. P. Fresnault-Deruelle has studied this relationship of com- plementarity in his essay on the cartoon.9 The message's unity occurs at the level of the development of the syntagm: image + language = nar- rative. What is peculiar to the cartoon is that the linguistic message and the iconic message intervene in the same symbolic space. There is an absurdity, a contradiction here that only convention can overcome. The signifiers of language are integrated with the signifiers of the image, even though by nature they are radically different. The linguistic code and the optic code cohabit a space governed by the optic code alone. Yet the intruder must be admitted unless one wants to lose a large part of the message. The earliest cartoons resolved this question by placing a con- siderable linguistic message outside the image; this message constituted in itself a perfectly intelligible narrative, however, resulting in extreme redundancy with respect to the image. Finally, it sometimes happens that the linguistic message has the double function of anchoring and of relay with respect to the image. Let us take an example that has been stylized to the absurd. Let us imagine a simple point in a white quadrilateral. If we dispose of only these elements, we can say that it is a question of a point in a quadrilateral, or else (if we pretend that the surface delimited by the quadrilateral is a pictorial symbolic space), that the polysemia of the image thereby obtained is practically unlimited. Now let us introduce language: the point says something (the text being included inside the quadrilateral). First case: the point says, "I am a lone cowboy in the immensity of the wide prairie." Language ob- viously has an anchoring function here: the point is an isolated character (cowboy) seen from far away and from high above, and the homogeneous space that surrounds him represents the flat monotony of the prairie. The</page><page sequence="6">510 NEW LITERARY HISTORY image is elucidated. Second case: the point says, "the silence of this infinite space horrifies me." Language now has partially an anchoring function (an indefinite character finds himself in an indefinite, but quite vast, space-) and partially a relay function (he is horrified by the silence, something that the image could not express, even if it were not as cari- catural as the one we have chosen for our example). Third case: the point says, "I am afraid." Here it is only a question of a relay function. The information provided by the linguistic message in no way char- acterizes the iconic message, whose polysemia remains unlimited. On the other hand, the information given by the language is precise and calls for a sequel. This coexistence of the image and language and the defini- tion of their reciprocal functions logically provokes the question: is it possible to substitute one for the other? III. Language/Image, Image/Language Substitution If one posits a priori the possibility of a substitution, one immediately runs up against two major obstacles: (1) Certain signifieds of language are impossible to "translate" into the pictorial act (for example, this last sentence: "Certain signifieds of language are impossible to 'translate' into the pictorial act"). (2) An image, on the level of its form (coded optic), is never reducible to a word, a complex sentence, or even a long discourse. If it were, one could exactly re-create an image solely from the communication of its description through language. A painter, for example, could reconstitute an already existing pictorial form without having seen it. Yet we know that it is extremely difficult to reproduce an image exactly even when one has the initial form before one's eyes. We will leave aside the instance in which the image tries to substitute itself for language so as to visualize all at once the information given by a discourse.10 This would require a separate study, and we would prefer to deal with the second instance, in which language wants to render account of the image (this implying pictorial analysis and criticism). As a first step, language can have (with regard to the image of which it wishes to render account) the anchoring function of which we spoke earlier: i.e., it can locate what Barthes calls "the letter of the image" (e.g., "this painting represents a horse grazing in a field strewn with yellow flowers"). It is an operation similar to the task of delimiting and organizing that speech performs on the world in order to make it signify. "The letter of the image corresponds to the first degree of the intelligible (short of this degree, the reader would perceive only lines, forms, and colors), but this intelligible remains virtual because of its very poverty, since anyone born of a real society always disposes of a knowledge greater than anthropological knowledge and perceives more than the letter."11 This "more than the letter" is the image's connotation.</page><page sequence="7">IMAGES AND WORDS 511 But it is here that an essential problem arises: is the connotation that of language identifying the image with regard to the world (in our example, that which is connoted is "horse," "field," "yellow," "flowers") or that of the particular forms and colors that constitute the image? In other words, cannot the pictorial elements that Barthes set apart (lines, forms, colors) have a connotation that is more or less free from the lan- guage that organizes them as a function of the world and its objects? The question is important, for if the optic elements combined in a particular image cannot create their own connotation without passing through an anthropological identification, language no longer has anything to say about abstract art. All that it can do is to render account of the denota- tion of the pictorial elements: for "line" and "color" are also denotations (e.g., "the curved line X encloses red-colored surface Y"). The analysis of the functioning of these denotated elements and of their signification is connotation. Pictorial criticism almost always tries, even in dealing with abstract art, to pass through anthropological interpretation: it hunts down figurations of nonexistant objects, upon which it can base its discourse. Yet the abstract image is only the functioning of the different pictorial elements combined so as to obtain an effect of meaning, just like any other image, but without passing through the representation of an "objec- tive" world, one organized by language.12 Therefore, if one admits the principle of signification in abstract art, one can, beginning with the functioning (a kind of syntax) of the pictorial elements, extend this type of analysis to so-called "figurative" images, these latter also constituted of lines, colors, and forms. From these few reflections, one could therefore isolate a sort of methodological direction for pictorial analysis. The latter would have to take charge of a double level of denotation and connotation: a first level (which one could call anthropological and cultural) that takes account of the relationship of the figurative image and the world organized by the language of a given culture; a second level (which one could call semiological) that takes account of the pictorial elements and their func- tioning-in short, of that which constitutes the image as constructed object. With regard to the figurative image, these two levels should constantly be articulated one in relation to the other. One can also imagine the extreme case of a perfectly abstract image in which one would find only the semiological level-the only one capable of carrying on a coherent discourse about such an image. Therefore language, though unable to substitute itself for the image (all of whose aspects it cannot render account of), is indispensable in the simple act of looking. One must be careful not to deny a purely optic pleasure, the effect of the image on the senses, the pleasure of seeing. But it is indispensable that language, surpassing the simple exercise of erudition and good taste, become more</page><page sequence="8">512 NEW LITERARY HISTORY systematic in order to reduce to the minimum what has often con- veniently been called the "ineffable aspect" of the pictorial message. ECOLE PRATIQUE DES HAUTES ETUDES EN SCIENCES SOCIALES, PARIS (Translated by Richard M. Berrong) NOTES 1 A. Zemsz, "Les optiques coh6rentes," Revue d'esthdtique (1967), p. 40. 2 Ibid., p. 73. 3 This formulation cannot account for all the particularities of an individual painting. The pictorial form obviously refers to an initial "coherent optic" (Zemsz), but within this optic its variations can be infinite, which makes the painting in question a unique object whose analysis remains to be done. 4 This "particular actualization" does not imply any equivalence of the image with other systems of expression or communication, or any possibility of indif- ferent substitution of the text for the image (for example), as if one and the other were only the manifestation of a disincarnated initial thought-God. This would amount to re-establishing on a large scale the form/content differentiation, to denying the signifying opacity of the image as constructed object. 5 By this we do not mean to say that, in his practice, the painter is totally isolated from his social, ideological, and historical context, but one must admit that artistic creation has become more fragmentary, that form has passed more for an individual treatment (of which the painter possesses intellectual ownership- a new development). 6 "Rhetorique de l'image," Communications, 6 (1964), 4. 7 This polysemia does not necessarily exist in all cultures and at all times. 8 Barthes, p. 44. 9 La bande dessinie (Paris, 1972). 10 In this field of ideas, one can refer, for example, to the work of M.
