<plain_text><page sequence="1">Two Modes in the Poetry of Makhdum Mohiyuddin Carlo Coppola On November 24, 1934, a group of Indian students from various British colleges and universities met in the back room of the Nanking Restaurant near the University of London. Organized by Mulk Raj Anand (b. 1905) and Sajjad Zaheer (1905-1973), this coterie sought to unite Indian writers in Eng land with the increasing numbers of European intellectuals who were voicing strong concern over the rise of fascism, and to speak to the matter of Indian independence from Britain. The group eventually produced a manifesto, which was published in two versions: the first appeared in India in the October 1935 issue of Hans, the prestigious literary journal edited by Prem chand (1880-1936), the great doyen of Hindi and Urdu litera tures, and the second in the February 1936 number of the Left Review, London, the newly-established, Marxist-oriented journal of literature, politics and the art?. While the two versions of the manifesto differ markedly in tone—that published in India being more sedate and less incendiary than its London counterpart—the main intent of both was essentially the same. "It is the object of our associa tion," wrote the authors, to rescue literature and other arts from the priestly, acade mic and decadent classes in whose hands they have degene 43</page><page sequence="2">INDIAN LITERATURE rated so long; to bring the arts into the closest touch with the people; and to make them the vital organ which will register the actualities of life, as well as lead us to the future.2 In addition, the group pledged to . . . criticise ruthlessly, in all its political, economic and cultural aspects, the spirit of reaction in our country; and we shall foster through interpretative and creative works (both native and Foreign resources) everything that will lead our country to the new life for which it is striving.3 The new literature which this group wished to establish in India . . . must deal with the basic problems of our existence to day—the problems of hunger and poverty, social backward ness and political subjugation, so that it may help us to understand these problems and through such understanding help us act.4 The group, called the Indian Progressive Writers Associa tion, met with as much success as could be expected in England. Its members soon realized that the movement had to be taken to India. When the group held its first Indian meeting in Lucknow on 9-10 April 1936, it set into motion what was destined to become probably the most powerful and wide-spread literary movement in India during the first half of the twentieth century. Known by various terms in the different language areas of the subcontinent, the name of the movement usually translates into English as "progressivism," which shares a number of common features with socialist realism, the official literary doctrine for mulated and espoused by the Stalinist regime in the late 1920's and early 1930's. The progressive movement in all of the major literatures of India was coordinated and encouraged by the All-India Progres sive Writers' Association (AIPWA), the movement's organiza tional arm, which has been described as the 'most important front organization created for specific professional groups ..." by the Communist Party of India (CPI).5 While the officers of 44</page><page sequence="3">TWO MODES IN THE POETRY OF MAKHDUM MOHlYUDDlN the association have steadfastly maintained that their organiza tion has never been affilated with any political party, its various pronouncements have consistently mirrored CPI policies and its fortunes and misfortunes have risen and fallen with those of the CPI as well. The officers of the A1PWA have been, in a number of cases, Urdu writers, and the influences of this movement have been particularly important in Urdu literature. Many of the major writers in this language have been at one time or another associated informally with the larger progressive movement, or more formally with the AIPWA itself. One such writer was the late Makhdum Mohiyuddin, an author whose poetry exemplifies the duality of modes in which many the poetes engages of the period wrote. His poems are divided between ones with political themes and others with love motifs, as well as with still others which present a combination of the two modes. Many of his works are among the foremost produced in the progressive movement and are among the best to be found in modern Urdu lyric poetry. Makhdum was born in Hyderabad, Deccan, in 1910. He was educated there, completing his M.A. degree in Urdu at Osmania University in 1932. He then divided his time among the tasks of seriously writing poetry, teaching Urdu as a lecturer at City College, Hyderabad, and actively engaging in leftist political activities. By 1942 he abandoned teaching and became a full-time CPI worker and organizer in the railway unions, as a result of which he eventually became vice-president of the Nizam's State Railwaymen's Union. His first of two collections of poems, Surkh sawera (Red Dawn), containing many of his best-known works, was published in 1944. During the Telangana Revolt in Hyderabad Makhdum agitated against both the Muslim conservative forces and the Nehru regime. Such activities forced him underground, but he was eventually arrested and jailed in 1951. A year later he stood for election in the Lok Sabha (lower house of the Indian Parlia ment) but was defeated. In 1954 he served as assistant secretary 45</page><page sequence="4">INDIAN LITERATURE for the Calcutta meeting of the powerful, CPI-backed All-India Trade Union Congress and during the latter part of his life served as a CPI member of the Andhra Pradesh legislature. His second collection of poems, Gul-e-tar (New Flower), containing mostly gazals and other romantic lyrics, was published in 1966. He died in 1969. Makhdum's political credo has been delineated with inten sity in one of his most famous poems, "Bigi" (Rebel), probably inspired by the poem of the same name written by Kazi Nazrul Islam (b. 1899), the Bengali revolutionary poet whose versest ran slated into English and Urdu had a profound effect on many of the young progressive writers of. the early 1930's. In his works Makhdum sets forth in poetic terms his self-image in light of the tenets of progressive literature. Here he states in poetry what had previously been expressed in manifestoes and ideologi cal tracts: I am thunder, lightning; Í am unrest, quicksilver: I worship myself, self-confident, proud; I am the knife which can cut the throat of oppression. The spark which can burn the harvest of cruelty. At my cry the rich stuff their fingers in their ears; Bring the axe! Let me bathe in a blood river. 1 am fire; yes, leaping fire. I am fire. Now let me everything ablaze.8 As a result of his defiance, the rebel poet must face a number of policial, social and economic realities. One such reality is war—spacifically World War II—which was treated by many progressive poets in their verse. The attitude which these writers —Makhdum among them—expressed towards the war was highly colored by the ambivalence the CP! showed toward this event. When War broke out between Britain and Germany in Septem ber 1939, the CPI considered it an "imperialist war," for only two weeks earlier Russia and Germany had signed a nonaggres sion and neutrality treaty. In fact, the CPI "demanded that the war be converted into a revolution" against the British,7 and 46</page><page sequence="5">TWO MODES IN THE POETRY OF MAKHDUM MOHIYUDDIN that the task of the Indian people was the "revolutionary utilization of the war crisis for the achievement of National Freedom,"8 a notion not entirely unlike that upheld by the Indian National Congress Party and Mahatma Gandhi. Accordingly, various poets wrote works reflecting this basic line of thinking. Among the many such poems written in Urdu, Makhdum's "Sipahi" (Soldier) is one of the most famous. A note added to later editions of this piece indicates that "This poem was written during the imperialist, period of World War II": Ask the departing soldier Where he is going. Who is this distraught woman singing To console her hungry children? The smell of burning corpses — Life shrieks. The landscape curls up in fear; The stars slink off in fright. The time of youth murdered, The sari's edges dipped in blood. The tent of darkness falling — My love, dawn is near. O you who are leaving our country, The banner of revolution has been unfurled! Ask the departing soldier Where he is going.8 This poem is simple both in terms of its language and structure, an important set of prerequisites for a good progressive poem. There is relatively little bombast here, particularly when one compares this poem to the effusions and fulminations written by less restrained progressives on this subject.10 The anti-British sentiment of the poem is implied, for, indeed, the departing soldier does not know where he is going, but the reader does: he is off to Europe or Africa, as was the case in World War I, to fight once again the white man's battles. 47</page><page sequence="6">INDIAN LITERA 1 URB The CPI's attitude towards the war underwent a profound change after 22 June 1941, the date on which Hitler launched his Operation Barbarossa, code name for the invasion of Russia. With the Soviet Union now in the war and an ally of Britain, the Communist International required that the CPI now sup port the British war effort. Appropriately, the CPI leadership, including Sajjad Zaheer, who had been jailed in the Deoli Detention Camp in Ajmer for their anti-British agitation, set forth the Deoli Thesis, in which support for the ally war effort was required and the slogan of the "people's war" was espous ed. This shift in attitude eventually clashed head-on with Gandhi's "Quit India" movement. However, the CPI offered "unflinching support to the cause of victory over fascism. . . . We declare that with every ounce of energy, with every drop of our blood, we shall fight and rest not till victory is won."11 Makhdum's response to this new attitude is reflected in his poem "Jang-e-azadi" (War of Freedom): This war is a war of freedom— Under the banner of freedom Of us, the Indian masses, Of those condemned and the helpless, Of those drunk with freedom, Of the peasant and worker. This war is a war of freedom Under the banner of freedom The whole world is ours, East, west, north and south; We Europeans, we Americans, We Chinese, risking our lives for our country, We Red soldiers destroying tyranny With bodies of steel. Of freedom! See, there comes the red dawn Of freedom! It sings the roseate song Of freedom! See, it waves the banner 48</page><page sequence="7">Two modes in the poetry Of Makhdum móhiyüddin This is a war of freedom Under the banner of freedom.12 This poem, in spite of its immediate enthusiastic reception when it appeared, is one of Makhdum's least convincing pieces. How ever, to dismiss it now as merely a bad poem would be to render a dis-service to the requisite simplicity of diction and structure, a "sing-ability" and refrains which would appeal to people at .public meetings, political processions and poetry symposia. But surely, given the general political tenor in India at this time, the inclusion of the line "We Europeans, we Ame ricans" in such a piece must have been difficult for the poet to write with conviction. Consider too the ambiguity of the title. The freedom (azadi) being fought for in this war is ostensibly that of the forces of good (the Allies) against those of evil (the fascists). But by the same token, the jang-e azadi (war of free - dom) is of course, the Indian struggle against Britain. The repeti tion of the word azadi no less than twenty-one times through out the poem is certainly not accidental, and would at the very least evoke some subliminal feelings of nationalism among even the most obtuse reader or listener. Thus on one level the poem conforms to the requisite ideology imposed by the CPI; on ano ther the poem rebels against this ideology and reaffirms the poet's basic notions with regard to the war. It not a good poem, then it is certainly a clever one. These two poems, "Sipahi" and "Jang-e-azadi," are occa sional pieces; they bear the obvious traces of being written on demand, something that a party hack would be expected to fabricate when the occasion arose, a view which is perhaps best substantiated with hindsight. Clearly the poet's "public voice" chimes through the pieces loudly, and if these poems were the only one Makhdum wrote on the subject, one could justifiably assert that he was something less than a good poet. But in those few instances when he successfully combines this "public voice" with his "private voice" as well, he has been able to produce political poems which rise above the single event and whi ch possess a lasting quality called "art." One such poem is his 49</page><page sequence="8">ÍN0IAN LlÍERAfURfe "Andhera" (Darkness), an empassioned plea against all war, an exposition of its horror and futility: A begger's bowl in the hand of night. Bright stars, shining moon glad with light received as alms. a borrowed glow, This, their bridal dress, their shroud. And in this darkness the dying groan, The place of ambush for the dogs of the Angel Death, Those wounds of culture, Trenches, Barbed wire Entangling men's bodies, Vultures feasiing, Heads split asunder, Corpses reft of hands and legs. From one end of the skeleton to the other A cold wind Mourning, lamenting, crying. Weeping in dead-of-night silence; Sometimes children, sometimes mothers, Lamentation from moon and stars; Heaps of distressed stars uppn Night's forehead Last only till the rising sun. Night offers nothing but darkness. Night offers nothing but darkness.13 Here images are heaped one upon the other resembling the massive piles of barbed wire and dismembered corpses evoked in the poem. Images of light are transformed into blackness; things of beauty are rendered ugly and horrid; a time for rest or love is decomposed into lamentation and weeping. Night, here an epithet for war, offers man nothing whole, nothing beautiful, nothing healthy—only darkness. "Andhera" marks a highpoint in Makhdum's pre-indepen dence poetry. A cursory look at many of his other poems written before 1947 shows that he was unable to match "An dhera" for sincerity of sentiment, depth of insight, and com plexity of structure. In comparison to "Andhera" these other poems merely seem like slogan-mongering, exercises in which 50</page><page sequence="9">TWO MODES IN THE POETRY OF MAKHDUM MOH1YUDÖIN nearly all Urdu poets of the period indulged. These poems sound in Makhdum's "public voice", pat pieces formulistically written more as progressive literary drills than as genuinely felt literary statements. Among such pieces are "Jang" (War), "Mashriq" (The East), "Haweli" (The Mansion), "Maut ka git" (The Song of Death), "Zulf-e calipa" (The Ringlet), and "Inqi lab" (Revolution). In each poem the author opens with a state ment regarding a particular aspect of the capitalist system which must be destroyed. In "Jang" the aspect is, of course, war;14 in "Mashriq" capitalism is pictured as the force which has re duced the East to a "house of ignorance, starvation, begging, disease and filth."'5 In "Haweli" capitalism is called "a dilapi dated mansion";in "Maut ka git" it is "the beast [which! has played enough with the blood of man."17 In "Zulf-e calipa" capitalism is addressed by name and is sarcastically praised for "making so many preparations for your own destruction with your own hands";l;( and finally in "Inqilab" the reader is pre sented with "a world [which] has been unhappy for so long" due to capitalism.'9 Next, the poet lists more specific capitalist atrocities, de lineating in detail the basic theme suggested in the opening lines. Such lists are sometimes sprinkled with allusions associated with the capitalist system and then denounced: "An earth breed ing the dreams of the 'people of the cave' " ("Mashriq");2" "The doors of the palace of Shaddid are closed to the hungry" ("Maut ka git);21 "The holy spirit [i.e., Gabriel| cannot extin guish the flames of hunger" ("Haweli");'- and "Still the next of the afterlife has been set upon the shoulders of the Kaaba; Still the unripe madness of religion seeths in the people's head" ("Inqilab").23 While these religious and literary allusions are used here to denigrate the capitalist system, there are other in stances in which such images are exploited in a totally opposite manner. For example, in "Haweli" religious allusions are offer ed to enhance the sense of power and revolt: "Your heart shatters Khaybar; your glance is the arrow of Arjuna."24 In "Zulf-e calipa" the ravages of capitalism are pictured in terms 51</page><page sequence="10">INDIAN LITERATURfe of their effects on the earth which, ironically, is made more sacred in the poem through association with religious figures from Hinduism, Christianity and Islam: The entire creation is being ravaged; the universe is afire, The earth from which the prophets of evolution arise, The earth from which was brought forth the gods of knowledge and wisdom. The earth of Rama and Lakshman, the earth of Gautama, The earth of Muhammad and of the son of Mary.25 Finally, each of these types of poems ends with a look to the future and to the new system which Marxism will provide. Usually the final lines are stated in cliched "onward and up ward" sentiments: "Arise, O sun of munificience,/0 star of divine zeal" ("Jang"); "This earth, reared by death, will be destroyed/And a new world, a new man, will be made" ("Mash riq"j; "Come, let us unfurl the banner of freedom upon these ruins" ("Haweli"); "Come, let us burn to ashes this unholy sphere/And fill the cup of the world with kindness" ("Maut ka git"); "May the determination for freedom survive! May life live on forever!/May the red banner rise still higher! Long live insurrection!" ("Zulf-e calipa"); and finally, "Let the streets and bazaars turn fragrant with the breeze of justice" ("Inqilab"). At best, each of these poems is a string of state ments and allusions which, because of Makhdum's elegant Persianate diction, dazzle one on first reading or hearing. But subsequent reading shows that these verses written in this public mode are superficial and lack true poetic substance, especially comparison to "Andhera". One wonders, then, why Makhdum wrote such pieces. It would seem that he, like his other progressive brethren, were asked to do so. Given the frequency with which he produced such works, one gets the impression that he did so gladly and without resentment. That he either knew or cared whether he was writing verse with evanescent value is merely a point of speculation. All that one can say with certainty is that he was a committed political writer. What followed in the form of these 52</page><page sequence="11">TWO MODES IN IHE POETRY OF MAKHDUM MOHIYUDDlN set pieces was the logical outcome of such a commitment. The year 1947 marked an important point in Makhdum's development as a poet as well as in his political career. This was the year of India's independence from Britain, and to the citizens of the princely state of Hyderabad, it was the era of the Telangana movement. Briefly, this movement was the out come of a number of political power plays at the time of inde pendence. The- fabulously wealthy and powerful Nizam of Hyderabad, the Muslim ruler of a state whose population was overwhelmingly Hindu, refused to accede to the newly-formed Indian Union and sought to establish his own autonomous state. Military action was taken against him and he finally sub mitted to the central authority in Delhi. Throughout this period of time various political and religio-political groups in cluding the communists, engaged in guerilla warfare against the Nehru regime, which, for various reasons, became markedly anti-communist. While Makhdum's personal involvement in the Telangana movement is somewhat ambiguous, it is known that he was forced to go underground for several years and was eventually arrested for his participation in it. His personal reactions to this event are documented in his famous poem "Telangana," where he looks upon the movement as a "guide for India," the "mes senger of revolutions": Telangana, the guide for India, Is making a new dawn, calling people to different directions; Telangana, the messenger of revolutions. Leader of the thirty, the Guide the path to the Water of Life, In the breasts of dark night a bridal procession of torches, My stability, my universe, my life! Greetings to you, O sun of revolt! Greetings, O moon of salvation.26 In a stanza which bears a close resemblance to "Andhera" he continues: The night harboring crime, carrying tyrannies; In the dark night evildoers drinking; 53</page><page sequence="12">INDIAN LITtRATURE In the dark niaht tue shrieks of violated chastity: In the dark night the rebellious masses carrying lightning upon their shoulders. 7 In the final stanza Makhdum bolsters the image of this revolt by associating it with that of China, which was going on at the same time: "O land of red martyrs, greetings to you!... I Greetings to you, O Chinese land, beloved of India."18 "Telangana" marks an important transition in Makhdum's poetry, for one notes in his post-indendence poetry a major shift from highly political verse to poetry which is more per sonalized and individualistic in its expression. The "public voice" receds and, eventually, the "private voice" dominates. In fact, one could postulate that this change in Makhdum's poetry reflects in microcosm the larger situation which existed during the late 1940's in the CPI, where there was considerable internal iissension which eventually left the party in disarry. The even tual collapse of the Telangana movement itself may have also contributed significantly to the change in Makhdum's poetry. Exact and specific causes are difficult to isolate. What is more interesting is to trace the course of this shift. Makhdum's poetry written after 1947 and published in Gul e-tar shows a gradual shift from direct and highly rhetorical verse so favored by the progressives to a poetry which is subtler in texture, more oblique in statement, and dependent more heavily on traditional gazal (lyric) imagery than the pre-1947 poetry. The operative word here is gradual, for this transforma tion took place over a period of almost twenty years. This does not mean to suggest that the poet abandoned progressive content in his poetry, for certainly there are a number of obviously political poems written during the 1950's. While serving a sentence in Central Jail, Hyderabad, for his affiliation with the Telangana movement, Makhdum wrote "Qaid" (Prison), in which he denounces the tyranny of the Nehru regime and laments: "I am sorry that my life's treasure/Became an offering to prison./Why did it not become an offering to free my country, a prison?"-9 Interestingly enough, even though the poet ex 54</page><page sequence="13">TWO MODES IN THE POETRY OF MAKHDUM MOHIYUDDIN presses bitter hostility towards the Nehru regime in this poem, he wrote a touching elegy to Nehru in 1964 when the prime minister died,30 Other poems express similar political sentiment. Solidarity with China is offered in the quatrain "Naya ein" (New China [1951]).31 The poem "Masko" (Moscow [1953]), written by the poet "On disembarking at Moscow Airport," is a greeting to Russia "from the suffering people of India."3-' "Cup na raho" (Don't Keep Silent [1961] treats the murder of Patrice Lamumba, who is pictured as a "star" who "broke away in the darkness of night," crushing his people's chains of bondage, with the result that "The conscience of Man/Began to shine like a cut diamond.""3 However, "in the darkness a dagger flashed in someone's hand [and]/Again the rivers of blood shone in the silence of night." As a result, "Thanks to the sovereignty of the United Nations,/Thanks to Truth, to Power,/One more drop of blood fell from the eyes of Dawn."34 The poet then sets aside his sarcasm and urges men of conscience to celebrate "the festi val of the martyrs of fidelity" and to confront the murderers of such martyrs with their evil deeds. Beyond these occasional pieces, Makhdum wrote one poli tical poem during the 1950's which could be called exceptional, primarily because of a distancing of subject and restraint of emotion the author builds into the poem. "Gand taron ka ban" (Moon-and-Star Forest) is not an occasional piece as such, though the subtitle indicated its subject matter: "Freedom (i.e., from Britain], before, after, and beyond": Our martyred bodies, melting wax-like; The candle of our country's dawn sputtered through the night; Through the night the moon-and-star forest shone. There was thirst but Even in thirst men and women Were intoxicated, waiting With the empty cups of thirsty eyes. All drunkenness ended; no ecstasy. The night's dazzling, flaming bodies 55</page><page sequence="14">INDIAN LITERATURE Became at daybreak sorrow's wait, Grief's field of thorns. And the throbbing blood in night's veins Turned into a blood stream. Some adept in deceit and cunning Have hissing snakes for breath, Black-hatred smoke for hearts; From an ambush They unfurl their tongue-tips And suck away morning's light-blood. The dregs of night. Those of darkness too. Faint dawn light. Friends, Hold one another's hands; Take the road to your destination, The destination of love, The destination of the gallows, The destinatation of the beloved's lane. Go carrying your crosses on your shoulders.35 Except for the subtitle and the allusions to "our country's dawn," there is little else to suggest that this poem is political in an India-specific sense. Theme is much broader, for it deals with suffering, exploitation, hope and perseverence in very general human terms, which; of course, are also applicable to India of the 1950's. Throughout such images as "thirst" (tas han gi) and "intoxicated" (sarsha•), so often used in gazal poetry, describe the pursuit of justice and righteousness, the attainment of which is referred to as the "destination" (manzil), mentioned not less than four times in the poem. However, the destination as viewed in this poem is less the abode of justice and righteousness than it is a place of frustration and further suffering, here alluded to as "the gallows" {dar) and the "be loved's lane" (ku-e dildar). Obstacles along the path of this journey are also described in classical gazal terms: "thorns" (.xar), "ambush" (kamin ga), and "darkness" (andhera). To meet such obstacles and to withstand such frustration, the poet urges continued struggle and dedication. Here the politics of the 56</page><page sequence="15">TWO MODES IN THE POETRY OF MAKHDUM MOHIYUDDIN poem is taken beyond the limits of individual or particular circumstances and is universalized to encompass all people—not just Indians in 1958—who are suffering at the hands of those "adept in deceit and cunning" (imaman-e sad makr-o fan). Notable too is the lack of bombast and fustian. There is a sense of quiet determination which suggests that, instead of wasting time with slogan-mongering, people (and poets) should devote their energies to forging ahead with their struggle, symbolized in the last line as a cross. Such relative understatement is also a distinguishing feature in much of Makhdum's later verse, es pecially that written in his "private voice." The image of the cross as a symbol for struggle is also central to the poem "Laxt-e jigar" (A Piece of the Heart).38 Interest ingly, the poem bears the dedication "To Christ". The "heart" referred to in the title is that of Mary, the "piece of hea heart," of course, is Christ, who is further described twice as an "unwanted, father-less child" (na xwasta tiflak-e bepadar). Through suffering, as symbolized by the cross, this child "Be came the guide of mankind/And afterwards God.' Through suffering, then, man achieves his goals, or redemption, just as Christ achieved godliness through his passion and death. In these two poems, which are typical of the general tone of his post-independence political verse, Makdhum seems to have broadened his definition of "political" poetry much the same way that progressives after the late 1940's seemed to espouse a cautious, rather than radical, humanism. The reason for this prudence may be found in the problems which beset the CPI, which, in turn, took their toll in the All-India Progressive Writers' Association. The Cold War strategy of the Stalin regime after World War II as engineered by Andrei Zhdanov (1896-1948), Secretary of the Central Committee of the Soviet government, had its repercussions in all of the communist par ties throughout the world. In India, moderate CPI leader P.C. Joshi (b. 1908) was replaced by the radical B.T. Ranadive (b. 1904). This, in turn, produced shock waves within the AIPWA such that in 1949 at a meeting in the Bombay suburb 57</page><page sequence="16">INDIAN LITERATURE of Bhimri (the group was not allowed by the city officials, to meet in Bombay itself, a manifesto was presented which set down very highly regimented and stringent rules for Indian writers. As a result, many members were expelled from the movement while others rather gladly left of their own accord. In a short time what was once the most powerful literary organization in Urdu was a mere shell, and its membership included only a few writers over and above the group's officers. The death of Stalin in 1953 and the ensuing "thaw" further discredited the organization, which, to this day, has never fully recovered from this blow. Ths works of many progressive poets, including that of Makhdum, reflect an understated, restrained sense of commitment to progressivism during this period. Many such poets, again including Makhdum, started to write increas ing amounts of highly personal, romantic poetry, works which sing in the poets' "private voice". It would be incorrect to assume that Makhdum had not composed poetry in his "private voice" early in his career. Indeed, he had written such poetry dealing with amorous themes throughout his career. However, such poems were, until the end of his life, overshadowed by his political poems. The first poem in Surkh Sawera is in fact a love poem curi ously entitled "Tur" (Mount .Sinai). "Tur" is usually associated with Moses and the giving of the commandments. As used in Makhdum's poem, however, the image takes on sensuous, erotic overtones, for just as Moses received the commandments on Sinai, the poet has received the gift of love "in the fields lying by the water," here recalled with a sense of nostalgia ("a faint trace of that bygone pleasure"): Jt is here that I began my education in love, That I took courage to express my purpose, That t saw coquetries and blandishments of modesty, That I first heard the sound of my throbbing heart. I still remember that it was here, in the fields lying by the water. 58</page><page sequence="17">TWO MODES IN THE POETRY OF MAKHDUM MOHIYUDDIN We sailed forth sitting in the golden barge of love. The flood, the desire surged in our breast; Whenever I touched her, she was bathed in perspiration, The taste of the strong wine of life. I still remember that it was here, in the fields lying by the water. The misery of life's worries were miles from us; Our life was filled with an eternal ecstasy; Cur innocent solitude was Mount Sinai's envy; The angels rocked us; houris sang us gazals. I still remember that it was here, in the fields lying by the water. Today neither those fields nor the flowing waters remain. But a faint trace of that bygone pleasure still abides.37 In "Intizar" (Waiting), another early piece, Makhdum elaborates on the image of the beloved, here recalled in dream like terms similar to the nostalgia of the preceding poem: You kept on dancing the whole night in my tearful eyes; You kept coming and going like a wisp of breath; I was joyous that my desire's dream would come With veil uplifted, Slyly, eyes lowered, Her hair scattered about her face.38 One of the fullest descriptions of the beloved, here equated with poetic inspiration, and of the poet's feelings towards her are expressed in "Ñau ras" (The Nine rasas).™ The poem also speaks of the author's ambivalence about admitting his love for her, perhaps out of fear of being rebuffed: That first song of spring, That longing of the moon and stars, The sound of unsung songs From Gabriel's lips, The rouge of new-awakened youth On the face of innocent maidenhood— She is a melody made Out of the heavenly music of the houris; She is like fire From which Moses acquired his place of honor; 59</page><page sequence="18">INDIAN LITERATURE Descending from the assembly of stars She sleeps in flower buds, Loosens herself in the cluster, Of bright moonbeams. I never had the courage to say "I love you." I could not express my longing: Nor possess the courage to express myself. Come into the heart of the poet. O, come into your nest. Read on another level, the poem could also be addressing not a person but poetic inspiration itself, thus adding an additional dimension to the poem through the artful use of ambiguity, an aspect of Makhdum's creativity which is only sometimes found in the early political poems. Another poem from Surkh sawera which treats a phenomenon, in this instance sleep, in female anthropomorphic terms is "Nind". Sleep is pictured as a seductive woman who lulls the lonely poet into what seems to be post-orgasmic slumber: What form is this beauty which takes shape, enters my heart And enlivens my bland loneliness? Whose fluttering eyelashes are these which touch the rebel of my heart? Whose garment is this which rustles with such hums? Whose playful lips are these I think I feel upon my eyes, My intoxicated-to-sleepiness eyes? At every step she reigns flowers of peace and tranquility: She makes me the captive of her night-dark hair, her smiles; She dissolves in my eyes as exhilaration from a glance; She makes me sleep for hours in rainbow shade; She claps me to her heart till dawn; A ray of the sun comes with muted steps to awaken me.40 Two poems dating from 1954 also show a similar sensuality, but also an ambivalence on the part of the poet to accept the pain which accompanies the joy of love. In "Cara gar" (He Who Cures), Makhdum as a casual observer describes two lovers who, as the poem opens, are "consumed in the fire of love," but who, as the poem progresses, are universalized as lovers who have loved from time immemorial and who will 60</page><page sequence="19">Twö MODES IN TtiE POETRY OF MABvHDÜM MÓHIYüDDIM continue to do so through eternity. The poet is of two minds about such feelings, for while he empathizes with their ecstasy and joy, he seems reluctant to allow himself to experience such feelings. He seems concerned about the pleasure of love than with the grief and sorrow that invariably accompany it: Under a jasmine arbour A little way off from the tavern at the turn in the road, Two bodies Were consumed in the fire of love. Love, their word for fidelity, Love, their god, Love, their funeral pyre. Two bydies Wet with dew, bathing in moonlight Like two fresh, joyous flowers in the afternoon; The cool, swift garden breeze Mourned And embracing her black tresses Stopped for a moment on her warm cheeks. We saw them At day, at night, In light, in darkness. The mosque minarets saw them, The temple gates saw them, The tavern doors, ajar, saw them From eternity to eternity. Tell me, O he who cures, Is there a prescription for love's alchemy Jn your bag? Is there a cure, a remedy for love? Is there any cure Beneath the jasmine arbour? A little way off from the tavern at the turn in the road Two bodies, O he who cures!41 The poem "Aj ki rat na ja" (Do Not Leave Tonight) depicts the situation after tne poet relinquishes the stand taken in "Cara gar" and shows the poet after he has agreed to love. The poet comments on the dichotomy he feels is inherent in amorous 61</page><page sequence="20">Indian litErature interpersonal relationships. He is happy with life and love, yet sad at the prospect of separation and, as the title suggests, he is reduced to beg his beloved to stay the night with him: Tonight has come after many nights, After much delay and from far off-but it has come. The overflowing cup will reach the marble hand of dawn; Night will break; the message of light will come. Do not leave tonight. Life is pleasure as well as suffering; Jt is a musical instrument, a melody, even ihe rattling of chains, The object of sight as well as the yearning for sight, Poison, as well as the life-water of lips and cheeks, The gibbet, as well as the beloved. Do not leave tonight Tonight has come after many nights. How joyous this night! Now auspicious the dawn! The glance of your love is for me. Do not leave tonights Night and its accompanying images, especially the moon and moonlight, are of course dominant images in much of Makhdum's poetry, both that written in the "public" and that written in the "private voice". His attitude towards night in his love poetry contrasts significantly with his feelings towards night in the political verse. In the latter night is a time of suffering and sadness, usually equated with the present circumstances in which the poet—and mankind—lind themselves. For Makhdum morning, as in nearly all progressive poetry, is the symbol of the new order. Both of these images, then, are rather standard in progressive poetry. However, Makhdum's attitude towards night in his love poetry and in some of the later political poems where he combines both voices, where the distinctions of "political" and "romantic" are often blurred, is one of ambi valence, as we have seen in "Aj ki rat na ja". Similarly in "Qamar" (Moon), an early poem, "the moon brings together madness and beauty" and "is telling the same sweet story [of 62</page><page sequence="21">TWO MODES IN THE POETRY OF MAKHDUM MÓHIYUDÜIN love]" which the poet "was trying to forget by deceiving" himself.43 In two later poems, "Pyar ki candni" (Moonlight of Love [1959]) and "Ihsas ki rat" (Night of Feeling [I960]), Makhdum continues in a similar vein.41 One of the most interesting poems written on the subject of night is "Sanata" (Deep Silence [1961]) where, with unadorned, simple phrases and negations, the poet conjures up a feeling of profound silence at night. Such silence seems to frighten him, for while he is aware of his contradictory feelings towards night as both a time of union with the beloved and a time of sorrow when separated from her, he views this complete silence as an obliteration of all feeling, good or bad, and as such represents the ultimate negation of man's basic nature to feel and to ex perience. It is not surprising that the poem ends with a plea for even the merest glance at the beloved's cheeks or for lightning. Both of these will ultimately bring the poet joy and sorrow, but will at least allow him to react, to feel once again. As such, these symbols become reaffirmations of the poet's basic humanity: No throb Nor footfall No noise Nor wave No tumult Nor the warmth of someone's breath Nobody. Let a solitary leaf rustle in this deep silence. No melted pearl Nor tear No heart Nothing. How desolate this street. Let someone's cheeks shine. Let lightning fall45. Silence is also a central image in the last poems published in Bisat-e raqs, "Billaur" (Crystals), which dates from 4 December 1966. "This poem conveys the sense of silence through a string of oxymoranic images. Significantly, the poem is not political 63</page><page sequence="22">Indian litéraíürE but romantic, and uses classical imagery, most notably the beloved's cheeks and the tavern, to elicit the many sensations of light, colour and sound which the poet wishes to convey. The final two lines—two questions—show that the poets feels he is in many ways incapable of conveying these sensations, referred to as "this story," for to convey them to the reader is as delicate an operation as transporting crystal. The poem ends after the questions are asked, the poet offers no answers, only silence. Thus the poem is about feelings of doubt, uncertainty and sus picion which the poet has towards himself relative to his abilities as an artist: The crystal of bright silence shone; A beam of light shattered upon a marble floor; Blossoms voice-dowers—exuded fragrance; A Milky Why of colours and laughing chords have fallen into my lap; From the depths of sea-silence Some mermaid seems to call me. A rustle in the darkness-curtain; the musical instrument stirred. Fingers of several lights glittered; Twilight within twilight, colour within colour; Her cheeks, chambers holding surprises, That smiling tavern, The rainbow—all appeared before me. How should I tell this story to someone? How should I take one step further?16 It is curious, if not ironic, that "Billaur," written late in the poet's life, is a work by the same once-cocksure, self-confident author of "Bagi". Makhdum Mohiyuddin, it would seem, is difficult to label as just another "progressive" poet. There is no question that he was a Marxist, and his work for the CPI bears out the quality of his commitment to this doctrine. However, in the literary sphere this commitment is not as clearly defined nor as stead fastly maintained. In fact, when one considers the entire corpus of Makhdum's work, he appears to be less than fully committed 64</page><page sequence="23">TWO MODES IN THE POETRY OF MAKHÜUM MOHlYUDÖiN to progressivism than a look at selected, isolate pieces might indicate, especially those progressive poems for which he is famous. This does not mean to suggest that he was forced into being a progressive writer, nor that his occassional pieces with progressive content were written under psychological duress. Rather, by referring to him as a progressive poet with qualifi cations about Marxist esthetics, one may suggest that his basic literary penchant, his essentially poetic orientation, ran counter to the tenets of progressivism and that his progressive poems were produced with what could be termed a subconscious mental reservation. Because of certain other-than-literary beliefs (i.e., commitment to the social and economic aspects of Marxism), because of the times in which he lived and because of the general tenor of Urdu poetry—in fact, of all Urdu literature— during this period, Makhdum accepted with qualification the literary and esthetic dicta of Marxism. However, this accept ance seems reluctant and it resulted in a dichotomy in his verse, which is manifested by the clear delineation between a "public" (i.e., progressive) voice and the "private" (i.e., personal, roman tic) voice in his poetry. Makhdum did not seem to be able to combine these two voices as fully, as seamlessly, and as frequently as other pro gressive poets, notably Faiz Ahmed Faiz (b. 1911).47 Perhaps the highly rhetorical style of the political poetry is, in fact, a facade of hyperbole which, because it was so favoured by the progressive establishment, allowed the poet the luxury to write verse in his other voice with impunity. Clearly, Makhdum's best poems are those written in this "other" voice. The fault of the "public voice" poems is their overstatement, their for mulistic structure, and their evanescence. Substance, comple xity, and above all, sincerity of sentiment are all hallmarks of Makhdum's "personal voice" poetry. If Makhdum is to be remembered by future generations of Urdu readers (and, of course, he will be remembered), it will be because of the poetry from this "private voice". The rest will be remembered as samples of a reluctant Makhdum's "public," or progressive, verse. 65</page><page sequence="24">ÍN0IAN LITERATURE NOTES 1.
