<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS qui sont passes loin de la terre sainte. L'auteur est moins porte qu'autrefois aux nouveautes, aux discussions erudites, a ces broutilles de la science historique. Mais il est difficile d'ecrire sur la Palestine de l'age talmudique ne se referant qu'a GRAETZ, et au livre admirable, mais paru sous le Second Empire, de DERENBOURG. Les livres de S. LIEBERMAN (Greek in Jewish Palestine, Hellenism inJewish Palestine), ses articles sur les martyrs de Cesaree, sur la Palestine au III-eme et au IV-eme s. etc. auraient permis a l'auteur de preciser bien de points qui sont restes obscurs dans sa narration. Mais on saura gre au P. ABEL d'avoir mentionne souvent les monuments archeologiques a leur place chronologique. Seulement on voudrait voir les materiaux archeologiques utilises systematiquement. Pourrait on esperer que 1'Ecole Biblique et Archeologique Francaise a Jerusalem nous donnera bient6t une histoire archeologique de la Terre Sainte? Columbia University, New York E. J. BICKERMAN W. B. STEVENSON, Critical Notes on the Hebrem Text of the Poem ofJob, Aberdeen 1951. viii + 170 pp. In his Schweich lectures of 1947 the emeritus professor of Semitic langua- ges at the University of Glasgow dealt with the Book of Job, primarily from a textual and literary point of view. In his new book he aims at com- pleting his lectures, treating the very same problems, and by means of the same methods. STEVENSON'S attitude to the Massoretic text is not very respectful. His book abounds in corrections and emendations. He regards literary and metrical inconsistencies as quite acceptable criteria of textual corruptions. Very often he replaces single verses into their presumed original position. Single passages are regarded as intrusions on account of their disagreement with the known views of the speaker to whom they are assigned. A similar bold optimism is to be found in the author's opinion as to the metre and our capacity to emend the text on the basis of metrical indications. Concerning emendations of this kind the author says: "The gain accruing from these corrections is more often literary than material or logical", p. 3. Undoubtedly, when corrected in this way the Book of Job has a new literary shape. But I am far from convinced that the change is entirely a gain. In particular, the use made by STEVENSON of the ancient versions as a means of correcting the Hebrew text is hard to accept. STEVENSON regards his corrections as quite convincing only when sup- ported by the ancient versions, and he consults them very often, first and foremost the Septuagint. As to the Septuagint of Job, however, its value as a help in correcting the Hebrew text is very dubious. From the point of view of both form and contents the Septuagint Job has a strong Helle- nistic colour, being not a literal, but rather a free rendering, paying due consideration to Greek usage and Greek style. The rich Oriental imagery of the original has very often been recast by the translator into a sober and straightforward account. Its numerous semi-independent poetical di- gressions have been placed into more immediate connection with the actual theme of the dialogue. Many proofs of ancient mythology are to be 110</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS found in the version. As to theological ideas there are also, in the Greek Job, certain modifications when compared with the Hebrew text. The debate between Job and his friends is obscured; there is no sharp difference between Job's attitude to the retribution and that of his friends, as they are depicted in the Septuagint. Particularly there is a tendency to suppress the picture of Job as the Defier and, instead, to stress his role as the patient martyr. And his friends, according to the Septuagint, regard the corres- pondence between sin and punishment as an ideal state rather than an inflexible law. Further, the translator's aversion to describing God in human terms differs strongly from the Hebrew poet's unreflectingly anthropomorphic view of God 1). These differences between the Hebrew Book of Job and the Greek version should be taken into consideration by a critic before correcting the Massoretic text with the help of the Septuagint. Evidently the trans- lator has created a book with a character of its own. These critical remarks are aimed at STEVENSON'S general attitude to the textual problems. I should like finally, however, to emphasize that his book often provides new and plausible interpretations of difficult passages.
