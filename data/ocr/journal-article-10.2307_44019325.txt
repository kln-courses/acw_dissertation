<plain_text><page sequence="1">Envisioning a Community of Survivors in Distance and Air Doll Je Cheol Park Introduction All across the world today the sense of a national community has been eroded. This is especially true of Japan, which was cast into recession in the early 1990s and reacted to globalization with neoliberal policies that advocated an unregulated market as the means to increase economic growth, regardless of social consequences. Catastrophic incidents, such as the Hanshin earthquake and the Aum Shinrikyo sarin gas attack, which both occurred in 1995, attest to the crisis of what Michel Foucault calls "the apparatus of security," a governmental mechanism for regulating dangers that threaten the lives of citizens (4-23). The main disciplinary mechanisms, such as educational institutions, are also in crisis, given the frequent occurrence of male teenagers' violent crimes and female teenagers' prostitution. Indeed, nearly the entire population - a particularly vulnerable one - has been virtually abandoned by the government's market-driven policies and reduced to what Giorgio Agamben calls "bare lives" - those that are "situated at the intersection of a capacity to be killed and yet not sacrificed" (73). The kind of imagination of a national community that can elevate the killed into the sacrificed by mourning for them seems to have been lost. As a response to this decline in the imagined national community, neonationalism emerged, 166</page><page sequence="2">insisting on the restoration of the senses of the past communities such as the family or nation. And yet, this seemingly critical power of neonationalists turns out to co-opt the anxiety and fear provoked by neoliberal policies, thereby shutting down "domestic resistance against new economic and political configurations that are taking shape" (Yoda 28).' This political economy gives us a new perspective from which to view Japanese national and transnational films made from the 1990s onward. Those films can be seen as a variety of attempts to imagine a new community in response to the decline of the national one. In this respect Kore-eda Hirokazu's feature films are especially illustrative. First, they mainly address survivors' continued lives in limbo rather than their recollection of the dead, focusing on how the survivors begin to build new relationships that no longer rely on the past communal bonds. Indeed, through these relationships, the films provide new imaginings of a community irreducible to the notions of community neonationalism evokes. Second, the films illustrate a significant change that has occurred in the way of imagining a new community. Air Doll (Kuki ningyo, 2009), Kore-eda's most recent film, best illustrates this change. On the one hand, the film extends the range of a community to cover the posthuman and the postnational beyond the confines of the human and the national. On the other hand, it provides much more didactic and explicit ways of imagining a community in terms of theme and style as compared with his earlier films that appropriated documentary filmmaking strategies. This essay offers a comparison of Kore-eda's two quite different films, Distance ( Disutansu , 2001) and Air Doll, exploring how their narrative and stylistic differences affect the way to imagine a new community. This essay also will briefly consider the implications of these differences in the present political climate of neoliberalism and neonationalism. From the Dead to the Community of Survivors Critics have a tendency to think that Kore-eda's films focus only on the questions of death, trauma, and memory, given that the bulk of scholarship is dedicated to his first two feature films, Maborosi {Maborosi no hikari, 1995) and After Life ( Wandafuru raifu, 1998), which are deeply obsessed with the deceased and memories of them.2 As he asserts in an interview, however, Kore-eda appears to be more interested in survivors and their continued lives than in the dead and 167</page><page sequence="3">the recollection of them: I'm not so interested in death itself, as the survivors of a loss who face what remains. To me, the image of people confronting the death of loved ones can be beautiful. They have to face death in order to continue living. They have to decide whether to keep memories once shared, or to erase the past (Paletz 55). In this way, he claims that his primary interest lies in survivors' lives, implying that the dead and the recollection of them matter only insofar as they affect these lives. Apart from his documentaries, all of Kore-eda's feature films from Maborosi to Air Doll focus more on the question of survivors' precarious lives than on that of their recollection of the dead. Maborosi, for instance, touches more on a widow's life that continues after her husband's death than on hidden motives or reasons behind his death, which remain inscrutable until the end of the film. Obviously, After Life listens in more detail to memories of the deceased than Maborosi does. And yet, the film centers on the ««dead, who have not decided which one memory to choose as memorable and eventually have to remain in limbo, working as counselors in the half-way house. Those who hesitate about making such decisions can also be seen as survivors in the sense that they survived complete death by refusing to give symbolic meaning to their deaths. Distance makes additional efforts to portray surviving family members' lives rather than expose secrets surrounding the dead Aum Shinrikyo members. From Nobody Knows ( Dare mo shiranai, 2004) to Air Doll, Kore-eda gives even more weight to survivors' struggles for life than the questions of who the dead or lost are, or what they left behind. For instance, the children in Nobody Knows have no idea about who their fathers are and show no interest in finding them. In Hana ( Hana yori mo naho , 2006), a samurai's attempt to avenge his killed father is abandoned as futile, even though the film is set in the Edo period, in which such fidelity was supposed to be a matter of course. Still Walking ( Aruitemo aruitemo, 2008), one of Kore-eda's most recent films, instead of focusing on the memory of the dead family member, highlights inherent conflicts among the surviving members of the family. Finally, in Air Doll, the main focus is on the lack of the connection or communication between people who feel deeply lonely rather than on the question of who they have lost. 168</page><page sequence="4">The key aspect of these survivors' lives Kore-eda's films focus on is arguably a variety of ways that survivors try to form new relationships with other survivors - i.e., new communities of survivors. Here it is crucial to see how the films no longer appeal to the past communal bonds for such new communities. The films' veiy little concern with the recollection of the dead indicates that there is no need to make reference to the past communities for a community of survivors. Indeed, for Kore-eda's films, such a new relationship or community has to be imagined entirely anew rather than being recognized as a restoration of the lost one. Films such as Maborosi, Nobody Knows , or Still Walking illustrate how people who are abandoned by their dead or lost family members get into new relationships with one another instead of accepting one another as a substitute for the lost loved one. Consider, for instance, the new family formed through remarriage in Maborosi and Still Walking or the alternative family formed in Nobody Knows. These films similarly underscore how the new (quasi-) family members, far from substituting the lost loved ones, remain somewhat alien or enigmatic in the eyes of the existing members. Nevertheless, since these communities are still imagined through the notion of a family, they risk reproducing chronic problems inherent in a family relationship, such as its patriarchal centralization and coerced homogeneity. By envisioning communities of survivors that traverse the notion of a family, however, films such as After Life, Distance, Hana, and Air Doll attempt to overcome these drawbacks. Distance and Air Doll, among others, are notable since, unlike After Life and Hana, which uncritically presume the existence of post- familial communities, they explore in greater detail how survivors can form a new post- familial community, starting from the loss of the existing notions of a community. But as will be clear in what follows, it is also important to see how there are still distinctions between the two films' ostensibly similar imaginings of such a community. These distinctions are mostly caused by the stark differences in their narrative and stylistic strategies: Distance is characterized by its improvisational style, its aesthetics of distance, and its plot twist, while Air Doll, one of Kore-eda's most fantastic films, is marked by its didactic, fairy tale-like narrative and sensational audio-visual style. The following comparative examination of the two films reveals how these differences decisively affect the way to imagine a community of survivors. 169</page><page sequence="5">Community in Repetition of Chances Even though Distance makes reference to Aum Shinrikyo's notorious 1995 Tokyo subway sarin gas attack, it is far from sensational. The focus of the film is not on the tragic incident itself, nor is it on Aum members' daily lives, as are Mori Tatsuya's two documentaries A (1998) and A2 (2001). Instead, the film mainly follows the four ordinary people who have familial connections to the cult perpetrators. Moreover, rather than modeling itself on the real incident, the film makes some changes as if to distance itself from most of the official representations of the incident in the mass media. The attack of poisoning a water supply replaces the real sarin gas attack, and the perpetrators, unlike those in real life, are here shown to have committed suicide after the attack. To an extent, the film appears sympathetic to the cult perpetrators and their vision of community. This sympathy seems justified, given the way in which the narrative opposes the cult members' intimacy to the survivors' isolation. The isolation of each survivor from the others is deeply felt, especially during the first fifteen minutes or so. During this time, the survivors' daily lives are shown in sequence through parallel editing. Since their relationship with one another is not known until they gather at the same place, this editing technique profoundly reinforces the survivors' feelings of isolation and loneliness. In contrast, when the cult members talk to their family members in a series of flashbacks, they appear greatly delighted by, and confident of, the cult's new community life. A more detailed examination of the film, however, demonstrates that such an impression is at best one-sided. Apart from the fact that their attack is unforgivable, the film presents a few signs that call into question the sense of a community in the Group. First and foremost, it turns out that the Group's intimacy does not transcend a family relationship, but rather bases itself on such a relationship. Sakata (Asano Tadanobu), one of the Group's former members, tells the survivors that the Group looked like a family when he joined it. By saying so, he suggests that the Group substituted for the members' real families. The problem here is that where only the replacement of family members occurs, all the limitations inherent in the family remain intact, including its patriarchal power structure and its tendency to develop an exclusionary attitude toward others. These limitations are found in several portrayals of the Group. Consider, for 170</page><page sequence="6">instance, how Sakata describes the Group leader as a paternal figure. And, as can be seen in fragmentary flashbacks, the Group members display a somewhat condescending and didactic attitude toward their family members. Furthermore, there is another aspect that undercuts the Group's seemingly Utopian quality: unlike the Group members' firm political convictions, distrust and anxiety lurk within the Group. Sakata's departure from the Group illustrates this. In a flashback, he is so suspicious of an elite member that he can no longer maintain the cult community life, but flees from it. In these respects, the ambivalent portrayal of the Group community life embodies a failed attempt to build a post-familial community rather than a successfully realized one. However, Distance does not simply stop at this point of failure, presenting a hopeless vision of a Utopian community. Rather, the film allows a real breakthrough to unfold elsewhere, on the side of the isolated survivors. The bulk of the film consists of what happens while the survivors and the surviving ex-member of the cult are making their pilgrimage together to an isolated lake within a forest to mourn for the dead. When they are ready to return home after a short ceremony, they find their car stolen and have to spend the night together in a hut in which the dead cult members previously lived a community life before carrying out the attack and subsequently committing suicide. In this place, the survivors contemplate and talk to each other about the reasons why the dead abandoned them and what the dead really wanted. Significantly, this setting can draw our attention to the fact that the survivors found themselves by chance under the same circumstances as the dead had. Thus, the survivors seem to begin to develop relationships with one another in the same way and in the same place. However, the resultant relationships the survivors develop are qualitatively different from those developed by the dead. The survivors do not share the same strong sense of familiarity, empathy, or homogeneity that the dead presumably did. Instead, they come to have an indeterminate feeling for one another, which is neither one of familiarity nor one of estrangement but one that is in-between. This contradictory relation of the survivors to the dead can be best understood as one of "repetition," to employ one of Jacques Lacan's terms. Thus, the survivors "repeat" what the dead did. Lacan clearly distinguishes the notion of repetition from that of reproduction. Unlike the notion of reproduction, which presupposes the existence of 171</page><page sequence="7">a common trait that can be copied over and over again, the notion of repetition involves "something that occurs ... as if by chance " (Seminar XI 54), so that it surprises, disconcerts, or stupefies the subject. To put it another way, repetition, far from being the recurrence of something familiar pertaining to existing concepts or order, is defined as the unexpected recurrence of something unfamiliar. To be more precise, as Lacan further remarks, "Repetition demands the new" (61), repetition in itself constitutes "the most radical diversity" (61); what is repeated is chance, difference, or unexpectedness itself rather than the original incident that occurred by chance. Indeed, as Heraclitus's famous aphorism says, "You cannot step into the same river twice." Thus, what emerges in repetition is potential itself that can generate infinite new possibilities, regardless of what actually occurs by chance. This elaboration accounts for what the survivors in Distance really do when they repeat what their dead loved ones did: the kinds of relationship they develop with respect to one another are not what the dead did - i.e., substitute family relationships - but are what the dead might have done by chance - i.e., permeate relationships with all kinds of contingencies. In this way, Distance allows new indeterminate possibilities to emerge through the survivors' repetition of the dead.3 But if the survivors' relationships with one another are at the mercy of chance, is it even possible to imagine a community starting from such relationships? The answer would be no if one only considers the restricted notion of a community characterized as homogeneity, essence, or intimacy, as can be seen in Benedict Anderson's notion of the nation. But an alternative notion of community Jean-Luc Nancy proposes is precisely predicated on these unpredictable or indeterminate relationships. For Nancy, what makes a community is not a common being but "being-in-common," which "has nothing to do with communion, with fusion into a body, into a unique and ultimate identity" but with "finitude, or the infinite lack of infinite identity" (xxxviii). Indeed, to the extent that this notion of a community does not presuppose any common substance or essence, such a community is open to unexpected, indeterminate possibilities. This notion of a community is also characterized as exteriority or alterity rather than as intimacy or empathy. In other words, this notion of a community implies a relationship based on one's encounter with the alterities of others, rather than on one's recognition of something 172</page><page sequence="8">one has in common with others. Thus, far from an obstacle to forming a community, one's unexpected encounter with the alterities of others constitutes an alternative Utopian community. Significantly, Distance involves even more contingencies than any other feature film by Kore-eda. This is made possible by some of its stylistic and narrative strategies. The three most important features include (a) its improvisational acting and shooting style, (b) its aesthetics of distance, and (c) its significant plot twist. First, as Kore- eda himself tells, the actors had to improvise more on this feature than on any of his other films: "I started out on Distance with just the actors from After Life and no script. I would give them a situation and a kind of character background, and then the emotions, the response and the language would emerge from the actors" (qtd. in Mes and Sharp 2 1 0). To maximize unpredictability, Kore-eda sometimes did not even tell his actors the motivations and direction he had given to other actors. In this way, the improvisational performances in Distance permitted the actors a great deal of freedom from a preplanned direction and consequently enabled more unexpected situations to emerge (Mes and Sharp 210). Moreover, as its exclusive use of hand-held cameras suggests, the film's cinematography is mostly improvised. This shooting style is obviously reminiscent of what Edgar Morin calls cinéma vérité. Challenging the observational mode of documentary, Morin advocates this style as that which can capture "the authenticity of life as it is lived" (229). But given the film's great deal of emphasis on contingencies, this style opens up the film to new indeterminate possibilities rather than capturing what is presumably authentic. For this reason, while the survivors are staying at the same place where their loved ones were, there is nothing that can be predicted for sure. To put it another way, the shooting style ensures that this place loses its specificity and becomes what Deleuze calls "any-space-whatever" - "a singular space, which has merely lost its homogeneity, that is, the principle of its metric relations or the connection of its own parts, so that the linkages can be made in an infinite number of ways" (109). Second, employing an aesthetics of distance, the film expresses the potential itself of a situation that can generate infinite possibilities rather than capturing a specific situation or incident itself. One might wonder why the spatial and emotional distance between the survivors does not diminish during, and even after, the night they spend together, communicating with each other. But, although in appearance they 173</page><page sequence="9">still keep their distance from one another, the nature of the distance between them qualitatively changes while they spend the night together. As mentioned earlier, during the first fifteen minutes of the film, the distance between them indicates their complete isolation or lack of communication. The parallel editing used here reinforces this sense of isolation as if to materialize barriers to their communication. Significantly, there occurs a change in the way of visualizing the distance while they are staying in the same hut. It is in turn within its mise-en-scène that the film mostly visualizes such a distance. Indeed, this visualized distance materializes the very kind of personal relationship Nancy calls exposition. As such, this distance embodies neither the survivors' isolation nor their realized interaction, but the in-between - i.e., each survivor's encounter with the alterities of the others. Put differently, given the indeterminacy or in-betweenness inherent in this encounter, this distance visualized within the mise-en- scène expresses a germ or potential that can generate infinite possible relationships among the survivors. One of the most remarkable images that visualizes this distance so as to open up a possibility for a new community is the static shot in which the survivors are waiting for a train at a platform to return home. Here, in appearance, everybody seems to think for himself or herself, independent of each other. Yet, this distance, which is neither too long nor too short, visualizes neither their isolation nor their actual communications, but expresses an indeterminate germinal state that can generate infinite possible relationships. In other words, this distance does not simply mean that nothing happens among these survivors, but rather visualizes a sense that an unexpected incident might yet occur. 174</page><page sequence="10">Furthermore, distance also matters separating the diegetic characters and the audience. Just like the distance separating the survivors, that between them and the audience will not be diminished until the end of the film. This seeming distance is obviously one of the main reasons the film received mixed to poor reviews.4 But it is this very distance, it should be noted, that at the end of the film gives the audience a chance to imagine a new community in all its possibilities. In this sense, the film's spectating distance serves as a signal for seducing the audience into this act of imagining a community. Finally, there occurs a significant plot twist near the end of the film. Sakata begins to have doubts about the identity of Atsushi (Arata), the survivor who is supposed to have lost his sister. He finally asks Atsushi, "Who are you, really?" adding that his putative sister said that her brother had died three years before. Atsushi retorts that she might have lied. As in plot twists frequently employed by many recent films, including The Sixth Sense (1999), this twist invites the audience to look back on the entire narrative from a radically different angle. But, unlike most of the twists, which eventually bring unexpected closures to narratives, the twist in Distance never reassures the audience by offering a rearrangement of plot elements. Rather, it awakens the audience to a number of fragmentary details that might have been missed. Indeed, through this process, the film repeatedly leads the audience to the same key question, "In what ways do the survivors repeat their dead family members while they form a relationship with one another?", or more specifically, "In what ways does Atsushi (or Sakata) repeat the dead Aum Group members' attempt to build a community while he is developing relationships with other survivors?" In a way, the plot twist itself, that is, Sakata's suspicion, constitutes an example of such a repetition. Given Sakata's past suspicion about the dead elite member, he repeats his relationship with that elite member through his new relationship with Atsushi. But what exactly does he repeat through this new relationship? Someone might think that he once again alerts other people to the cult's secret plots. People who think like this would, then, have doubts about all the details regarding Atsushi. Eventually, they might conclude that Atsushi, who is a son of the Aum leader not seen in the film, has indoctrinated his neighbors, including his putative sister and a hospitalized old man. They might further think that by disguising himself as a survivor 175</page><page sequence="11">who lost his sister, Atsushi has just embarked on a new project of indoctrinating other survivors. In fact, this interpretation came from a debate about Atsushi's identity that occurred on the IMDb (The Internet Movie Database) website. Of course, reading the film in this way presupposes that the film belongs to the thriller or horror genre. But, aside from the fact that the film employs veiy few conventions of those genres, the biggest problem with this reading strategy is that it ends up making the audience blind to infinite indeterminate possibilities the film's enigmatic fragments or gaps open up. Thus, given that Sakata's repeated suspicions are never confirmed, one of the best conclusions we can make about them is that what is repeated in his suspicions is the alterity as such of the others. In other words, far from signaling that others might be evil plotters, the repeated alterity indicates that unexpectedness has, and will have, occurred in relationships between him and others. In this sense, Sakata's repetition allows the audience to imagine a new community defined by alterity or being-in-common. The plot twist can also lead the audience to ask how Atsushi repeats the Aum cult's failed attempt to form a community. If the audience is no longer obsessed with finding out Atsushi's real identity, the twist might turn to a different direction, spurring the audience to contemplate in greater detail what he has been doing in his relationships with others. In the flashback in which he is asked by a policeman if he is influenced by the cult, Atsushi simply responds, "I don't think I'm influenced. But I just love the smell of lilies." This statement best epitomizes how he repeats the cult's community building. Given that lilies are a symbol of the Aum Shinrikyo, his statement indicates that he no longer treats lilies as a symbol but as fragrant objects. What is crucial here is chance, unfamiliarity, or difference itself that he might encounter when lilies take him by surprise through their smell rather than through their symbolic meaning. Thus, even though he still appears to be under the influence of the cult, the cult no longer remains, for him, the same community with which he has been associated. Instead the cult's attempt to form a community has now become open to infinite, indeterminate possibilities. Significantly, this account can explain the surprise or embarrassment his final enigmatic act - that of burning a photograph of his family and the dock - might arouse among most of the audience. This act also illustrates the way in which he repeats the cult's actions. Just as the other cult members 176</page><page sequence="12">burned the bodies of the deceased, so Atsushi burns the photograph and the dock. But, as the surprise his act arouses suggests, what is repeated here is also the chance, difference, or alterity of the act itself. The first act of burning by the cult is possibly a ritual for the dead, in which they are purified and elevated to a spiritual realm. As he does with lilies, Atsushi's repeated act of burning no longer serves as a symbol but as a sign, indicating that there occurred a difference or change in him. Since the film ends here, the audience, far from being able to fix this difference or change, cannot but accept it as a moment that opens up infinite new possibilities. In this way, the plot twist of Distance does not retroactively fix otherwise vague relationships among the survivors, but rather amplifies this vagueness much more, which results in offering all new kinds of chance encounters to these relationships. Community in Certainty of Enjoyment Air Doll similarly provides an imagining of a community of survivors beyond the confines of family, but the way in which the film does this is somewhat different from Distance. First of all - and this is one of the biggest changes in Kore-eda's career - the protagonist of the film is a non-human character: an inflatable sex doll named Nozomi. This premise allows the film to imagine a community that includes non-human entities. It is also significant that the sex doll, played by Bae Doona, a Korean actress, is seen to learn Japanese ways of life, including the Japanese language. This learning process is reminiscent of a foreigner or an immigrant who has just migrated to Japan. In this sense, for the first time in Kore-eda's career, the postnational comes to the fore, unlike his earlier films, which portray only Japanese people and locations. Second, as in Distance , the film problematizes loneliness and isolation as obstacles to forming a community, but it also correlates them with another social problem. Neither humans nor things are considered unique or singular but instead are seen as substitutes for other humans and things, disposable when they become worthless. The film illustrates this problem in a variety of ways. Sex dolls, among other things, are made for men who want substitutes for their sex partners. For Hideo (Itao Itsuji), Nozomi's owner, she is only a substitute for his ex-lover. Later in the film, he brings in a new sex doll to replace Nozomi. He even names this new doll Nozomi. However, it turns out that Hideo, may also be supplanted in his workplace, by numerous people who need his job. Indeed, most of Kore-eda's 177</page><page sequence="13">characters are in the same situation and thus feel lonely and "empty," as a lonely old man in the film stresses. In this way, the film imputes the impossibility of community to this economic logic of substitution. It is thus for a new imagination of a community that Kore- eda chooses an improbable character, one which is not properly a human nor just a dead object. Through this character, the film asks if there is any possibility of imagining different relationships from those based on the logic of substitution. Nozomi, who comes to life one day, attempts to challenge conventional relationships. Unsatisfied with her role as a substitute for a female sex partner, she attempts to become something more. She tries to play with children at the playground, she tries to provide better service in the video rental shop, etc., but her efforts, which nonetheless appear awkward or weird to people, are mostly rejected as worthless. However, there are at least two decisive moments when she does something singular rather than work as a substitute. First, when she visits the lonely old man's house to take care of him, he asks her to touch him. As a response, she tries to reach her hand toward his penis, as she is usually asked to do. But the old man indicates his forehead with his finger, saying, "Here." When she places her "cold" hand on his forehead, he expresses his sincere gratitude to her, saying that, according to a proverb, those who have cold hands have "warm" hearts. The other moment is the one when Junichi (Arata), her co-worker and boyfriend, asks her if she will allow him to deflate her, saying that this is what none other than she can do. She lets him do that, and the film shows how he deflates and re-inflates her with his breath over and over again. The sexual connotation of this act is unmistakable, given that they are naked while the process occurs. Like the mystery surrounding Atsushi in Distance, Nozomi's alterity here changes usual relationships based on the logic of substitution. In the two previously mentioned instances, her traits that thus far have been considered worthless become valorized, offering a certain kind of satisfaction to others. This satisfaction can be conceived as what Lacan calls "enjoyment" (or jouissance in French). For Lacan, enjoyment refers to something different from pleasure. Pleasure refers to the satisfaction one gets when one fulfills one's needs or purpose - i.e., when one achieves something one considers valuable. Enjoyment, on the other hand, refers to the paradoxical satisfaction one gets when one unexpectedly happens to do something one considers worthless. 178</page><page sequence="14">This satisfaction is deemed worthless because it deviates from one's needs or purpose. As Lacan claims, "jouissance serves no purpose" (Seminar XX 3). The unexpected occurrence of enjoyment thus exposes one's tendency to restrict the potential of life to utilitarian needs. More significantly, if one decides to embrace a certain kind of enjoyment rather than reject it, one has to speculate about, or reinvent, a new purpose that such an enjoyment might serve. This is how several instances of enjoyment that unexpectedly come from Nozomi might awaken her neighbors to other possibilities of leading their lives, ones that are inconceivable from the perspective of socially-given goals. Indeed, enjoyment plays the role of the medium or interface that might link every being with another unexpectedly, allowing us to imagine a community of being-in-common. However, as a tragic incident implies, the film does not seem entirely optimistic about a Utopian community mediated by enjoyment. Nozomi tries to do the same thing as Junichi did to her, to deflate him by making a hole in him, but this unfortunately kills him. In other words, she fails to elicit the same enjoyment from Junichi. To be more precise, even if her attempt had been successful, it could not have produced any enjoyment (jouissance ) for her because she purposely attempts to obtain it rather than being open to something unexpected. Significantly enough, however, the ending of the film optimistically suggests how even this seeming catastrophe might be transformed by chance into a germ of enjoyment for someone.5 After Junichi dies, Nozomi commits suicide by deflating herself. The air from her body and her last breath become a part of the wind, which carries pollen to her lonely neighbors and finally, as the last scene suggests, affects a reclusive girl who has withdrawn into a cramped room throughout the film. When she gets up and opens the window, she breathes in deeply and exclaims, "Beautiful!" And the following last shot from the girl's point of view shows Nozomi's dead body surrounded by empty bottles and apples. This conclusion is hopeful in two respects. First, the girl, who has been impassive throughout the film, is now affected by the seemingly useless kind of enjoyment provided by air, a wasted plastic body, and the same empty bottles and apples that she has thrown away. Second, this scene repeats a few features of the moment when Nozomi comes to life, resonating with the same sound of breath as the audience earlier heard. And just as Nozomi opens a window (or is open to the alterity 179</page><page sequence="15">of the outside) immediately after she comes to life, the reclusive girl opens a window immediately after she wakes up (or is awakened to enjoyment). This repetition seems optimistic because what is repeated is the very indeterminate moment that potentially evokes infinite new possibilities. In other words, this repetition is open to all contingencies, as is the case with the survivors in Distance. Thus, if this scene seems to repeat Nozomi's rebirth, it is because, rather than reproducing Nozomi's failure, the girl's changed life might succeed in eliciting new kinds of enjoyment from others that Nozomi might have accomplished, but did not. Thus, just as Distance does, Air Doll imagines a new community through the notion of repetition that occurs as if by chance. In this way, if we compare Air Doll with Distance in terms of their narrative framework, the notions of a community the two films imagine seem very similar. But a closer examination of Air Doll's narrative and stylistic features reveals significant differences between the two imaginings. First, there are two salient narrative features which make Air Doll didactic or moralistic, unlike Distance, which includes a number of details whose meanings remain ambiguous. As compared with his earlier feature films from Maborosi to Nobody Knows, which tend to employ documentary techniques, Kore-eda makes reference to fantastic cultural forms and incorporates these forms into the film. The exaggerated and unreal aspects of the story clearly come from the original manga, but, as he claims in an interview, the stoiy also reminds us of Anderson's Little Mermaid and Pinocchio (Harzheim). 180</page><page sequence="16">These influences finally make this film seem like a fairy tale or fable. And just as fables serve a didactic purpose through metaphorical or anthropomorphic figures, the film shares such a purpose particularly through a quasi-anthropomorphic figure like the living air doll. Her innocence, for instance, makes the audience rethink its notions about contemporary sophisticated humans. What makes this film further didactic is its ecological and/ or pantheistic worldview, which the lonely old man tells Nozomi about through a poem called "Life," recited by her voiceover. This poem describes how a living being is itself empty and thus has to be filled by another. What is even more striking is that the poem shows how a supposedly non-living being like wind plays a crucial role. In other words, the poem claims that every being can produce enjoyment that inspires other beings with vitality. Beautiful and moving as it is, the poem functions, within the film, as what Colin McCabe calls a metalanguage. Discussing the features of the classical realist text, he argues that this kind of text is characterized by the existence of a privileged and omniscient discourse that "can state all the truths in the object language" (35), that is, the portion of a text that requires explanation or interpretation. The scene in which the poem is recited best illustrates this feature. When the poem is recited by Nozomi's voiceover, the audience sees several isolated shots through parallel editing, much like the earlier part of Distance. Every shot shows one person who is alone eating, shopping, watching TV, and so on. Here, as the metalanguage, the content of the poem fixes the potentially indeterminate meanings of these shots. Singing about the need to overcome isolation, the poem states the truth about the feeling of the people shown in those shots. But it also does more. Describing the isolation of people, the need for them to complement each other, and the co-dependence of all species, the poem offers the audience a key to the entire film, clarifying the meanings of most of the otherwise vague elements. Just as Air Doll's thematic elements bring a didacticism to the imagining of a community, its style offers a perceptive certainty to this imagining. It also shows a significant contrast with Distance, whose aesthetics of distance or "in-betweenness" is dedicated to making the image faintly perceived. It is important to know that in Air Doll Kore-eda collaborated for the first time with cinematographer Mark Lee Ping-Bing and production designer Taneda Yohei, both of 181</page><page sequence="17">whom are famous for their highly sensitive techniques. Kore-eda's decision to work with Taneda is especially noteworthy, considering that Taneda has worked in very unrealistic, sensational works, such as Swallowtail Butterfly ( Suwaroteiru , 1996), Kill Bill (2003) and Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence (2004). For Kore-eda, who has so far made films closer to documentaries, this decision clearly marks a big change. Junichi, who seems to know the importance of enjoyment as a medium for a new community, teaches Nozomi that there are numerous beings that cannot be seen or heard but nevertheless "are," such as air, the moon, or stars in the daytime. The film makes these unnoticeable beings clearly perceptible for the audience. While these beings tend to be captured or perceived within the frame as if by chance in Distance, they are very often made perceptible as if on purpose in Air Doll.6 Consider, for instance, how the film makes clearly perceptible usually unnoticeable air, breath, or wind. The audience can hear the exaggerated sound of breath both in the beginning and in the ending. Moreover, in addition to this amplified sound, the audience can clearly see the breath in an indirect way, for instance, through the images of pollen carried along by it or the images of weather vanes turned by it. The images of pollen, in particular, appear so artificial that one cannot help but notice that they are digitally synthesized in the post- production stage. Conclusion: Community in the Era of Lingering Neoliberalism Like a number of Japanese films that have appeared since the recessionary 1990s, Distance and Air Doll can be seen as different attempts to imagine a new community in an era of lingering neoliberalism and the neonational backlash against it. Given the emphasis on contingencies and unpredictability, the community imagined by Distance arguably emancipates possible new relationships among people foreclosed by both neoliberalism and neonationalism. At first, the film seems to embrace the Aum Group's practices as a protest against the devastation of the national community by neoliberal policies. But by depicting the Group as nothing but a substitute family that maintains all the problems of a family, the film develops a suspicion that its practices are variations of the neonational backlash. These practices are not so far from the ways in which neonationalism tries to restore, at any cost, the traditional values of the family and the samurai founded on hierarchy or authoritarianism. Yet, Distance 182</page><page sequence="18">avoids this trap by imagining an alternative notion of community informed by the potential of alterity. In a slightly different way, underscoring how the economic logic of substitution has already penetrated presumably intimate relationships, Air Doll sees neoliberalism as especially problematic. The relationship between Hideo and his (foreign) sex dolls in the film indicates how neoliberalism even regulates relationships beyond the boundaries of the nation and the human. The kinds of enjoyment that Nozomi unexpectedly produces against the grain, from her cold hand to the deflation/re-flation game, clearly rupture the logic of substitution. And as the enjoyment that takes the reclusive girl by surprise indicates, the last enjoyment Nozomi leaves behind through her final breath and her wasted body enables the audience to imagine a new community open to all kinds of enjoyment, regardless of whether they seem valuable. In sum, both Distance and Air Doll, confronted with the situation in which neoliberalism has eroded the national community, attempt to imagine new communities of survivors. Indeed, one of their great achievements is the way in which they struggle to imagine different communities from the existing notions of a community such as the family or nation. However, as is demonstrated by the different ways that the two films imagine such alternative communities, there is always a risk that the potential of a new imagination will be once again co-opted by the neoliberal marketing strategy of regulating, if not prohibiting, alterities or contingencies. Air Doll is a good example that illustrates such a risk. Though it extends the range of imagination to include the postnational and posthuman, it nonetheless considers the new possibilities these fields open up only within the limit of marketability and efficiency, according to the tenets of neoliberalism. Thus, while the reclusive girl sees Nozomi's wasted body and the arranged objects surrounding her as "Beautiful!" the pile of rubbish that also surrounds Nozomi is still seen as trash by a society that considers this kind of "enjoyment" to have no economic value. Indeed, the community founded on such values cannot but dismiss other kinds of waste as inefficient, unmarketable, or even dangerous. Air Doll fails to address this issue; nevertheless, Kore-eda's employment of new ways to express the potential of postnational and posthuman encounters marks a significant change in his career, one that deserves both welcoming and worrying about. 183</page><page sequence="19">Notes 1 Yoda Tomiko notes that some of the neonational ideologues of the 1990s, such as Marxist-turned-nationalist Nishibe Susumu, critique "the unprincipled capitalism and bureaucratic rationality of its own leaders" (26). This neonational critique illustrates how neonationalism emerged as a backlash against neoliberalism. However, as David Harvey rightly points out, neonationalism eventually forms a paradoxical alliance with neoliberalism rather than challenging it: "[T]he neoliberal state needs nationalism of a certain sort to survive. Forced to operate as a competitive agent in the world market and seeking to establish the best possible business climate, it mobilizes nationalism in its effort to succeed" (85). 2 See, for example, Desser, McDonald, and McKim. 3 Kore-eda says about Maborosi, "Everything in the film is repeated twice. And it starts with a dream, so it should end with one" (Paletz 57). In fact, he employs this narrative technique of repetition quite consciously in nearly all his feature films, especially when he is to portray relationships between the lost loved one and his or her survivor's continued life. 4 One report made by Susan Morrison about its press screening at the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival bears witness to this mixed to poor reception: "The Film Festival's press screening of Distance that I attended was perhaps two-thirds full, an auspicious beginning given the universal praise given to After Life. By the film's end the theater had emptied out considerably, the press tending to vote with their feet. [. . .] [M]any of the negative reviews referred to it as too long and too unengaging [...]'distanced' as it were" (58). 5 Kore-eda similarly remarks about the ending: "The death of the air doll has a special meaning. The last breath that comes out of her body is a symbol of hope and rebirth" (see Lin). 6 Kore-eda tells us about an interesting production episode that clearly illustrates this feature of the film: "I wanted the apartment to have a telescope, because I thought the guy living with Nozomi had a romantic streak and liked looking at the stars. I told Taneda this, and he painted the whole room a sort of sky blue and hung a solar system decoration from the ceiling" (Harzheim). 184</page><page sequence="20">Works Cited Agamben, Giorgio.
