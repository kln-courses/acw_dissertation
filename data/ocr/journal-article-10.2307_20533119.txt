<plain_text><page sequence="1">Literary Ecology and the Ethics of Texts Hubert Zapf I. Ecology and Ethics Among the various "turns" in recent literary and cultural stud ies, the ecological turn and the ethical turn are perhaps the most conspicuous. They have both opened up promising new areas of transdisciplinary inquiry and are, in many ways, at the heart of current trends in the humanities. In my paper, I would like to look more closely at the relationship between ecology and ethics, with particular attention to the ways in which literature and literary studies can contribute in significant ways to that transdisciplinary dialogue. If one tried to point out some of the convergences and common tendencies within recent ecology and ethics, one could name the fol lowing: (1) Both of them newly focus on the relationship between text and life that has been reduced to only one pole in the pantextual and pansemiotic universe of postmodernism. (2) Both of them deal not only with facts but with values, that is, with a critical attitude to a given state of things and with the necessity to think beyond it and imagine possible alternatives. (3) For both of them, the relationship between culture and nature and thus between the natural sciences and the humanities seems to have special significance, even if they approach this relationship from different angles. (4) Both of them share the assumption of an intercon nection between local and global issues and are, therefore, transcultural and transnational in orientation. At the same time, it is helpful to approach any such transdisciplinary dialogue from an awareness not only of the affinities, but also of the differences and indeed the tensions between the disciplines involved, which cannot simply be subsumed under each other's premises. After all, ethics has been that discipline within traditional Western philoso phy in which the opposition between culture and nature, human and nonhuman life provided the foundational terms and concepts. Human consciousness and conscience, the freedom of the will, the autonomy of the subject, the moral sense of good and evil, the hierarchy of values between the spiritual, intellectual, psychological, and physical spheres New Literary History, 2009, 39: 847-868</page><page sequence="2">848 NEW LITERARY HISTORY have been characteristic axioms of ethical thinking from Aristotle to Kant and into the twentieth century. Ethics appears, therefore, as an expression of precisely that logocentric and anthropocentric ideology that modern ecological thought tries to overcome. What is more, ecology, from its origin in biology, has been an empirical descriptive rather than a normative-philosophical form of knowledge; it favors a collective and objectifying rather than a decision- and subject oriented approach; it posits an ecocentric instead of an anthropocentric orientation; it assumes the priority of nature over culture and, by ex tension, of the natural sciences over the humanities. Thus the bringing together of scientific and humanist-culturalist versions of ecology, which some ecocritics so emphatically advocate, is not as unproblematic and self-evident as it may seem. Let me illustrate this point by briefly discuss ing the relationship between ecology and ethics as formulated from the viewpoint of the natural sciences by Edward Wilson in his book Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge (1998). II. The Unity and Diversity of Knowledge Wilson is one of the foremost scientists and ecological voices in the world today, and apart from his role as environmental expert and public representative of a global conservation ethics, his aim is to overcome the division of modern knowledge into the "two cultures" already deplored in the 1950s by C. P. Snow, and to achieve a new "unity of knowledge" on the basis of interdisciplinary work. In his book Consilience, Wilson argues for a concept of knowledge that is fundamentally the same throughout the various fields of science. Consilience is not synonymous with coherence but is "literally a 'jumping together' of knowledge by the linking of facts and fact-based theory across disciplines to create a common groundwork of explanation."1 While Wilson in his earlier Sociobiology (1975) had still described ethics as a mere strategic function of selfish genes and "an illusion fobbed off on us by our genes to get us to cooperate" (that is, in the all-governing biological purpose of species reproduction),2 he provided a more productive concept for connecting biological ecology with ethical considerations in his books Biophilia (1984) and TheBiophilia Hypothesis (1993, coedited with Stephen Kellert) by postulating a kind of inborn human "love of life "and asserting "the innately emotional affilia tion of human beings to other living organisms."3 In Consilience, Wilson goes one step further in trying to establish a common epistemological ground for the various forms of human knowledge, including environ mental policy and ethics. Wilson assumes a relationship between natural history and human history characterized by "gene-culture coevolution,"</page><page sequence="3">LITERARY ECOLOGY AND THE ETHICS OF TEXTS 849 according to which culture has evolved in constant interaction with na ture, and, though accelerated and highly diversified in its processes, is governed essentially by analogous laws. The basic relations among the "great branches of learning," as Wilson calls them, are expressed in the following diagram ( C 9) : environmental policy social science ethics biology To indicate his intention of bringing these areas of learning closer together, he draws a series of concentric circles around the point of intersection (C10): environmental policy ethics social science biology Wilson goes on to say: "The ring closest to the intersection, where most real-world problems exist, is the one in which fundamental analysis is most needed" (C 10). In this model, the various domains of human knowledge are presumed to influence mutually and complement each other, with biology, however, quite clearly being the foundational disci pline. If one reads the model clockwise, starting with biology, one could construct the following example of "consilience": On the basis of the laws of nature in biology, and of their role in the functioning of human</page><page sequence="4">850 NEW LITERARY HISTORY societies in terms of the "gene-culture-coevolution," the impact of human civilization on the earth under the conditions of a "global free-market economy" can be studied in the social sciences, from which a specific environmental policy can be derived that is based on "the ethic of sus tainable development" (C289). Nevertheless, there are unresolved problems in Wilson's approach that cannot be solved by a merely causal-empirical concept of knowledge. Wilson is right, of course, when he argues for the necessity of sufficient and competent information about the findings of the natural sciences for any responsible environmental policy and contemporary ethics. Yet looking again at the diagram above, one might first of all ask whether all important branches of knowledge are adequately represented. Literary culture, for one, is not mentioned and is presumably simply subsumed under the social sciences, even though it probably has a special potential for the r?int?gration of different areas of cultural knowledge that are kept separate in other forms of discourse.4 Moreover, Wilson identifies "real-world problems" with the intersections of academic disciplines, all of which are clearly marked as cultural projects and practices. The principles of an environmental ethics that he postulates cannot really be based on and derived from "facts and fact-based theory" alone. The need to "think globally" requires not only empirical information, but reflection and imagination, a capacity and readiness to think beyond oneself and one's own immediate interests and life-world (C 10). Even though "biophilia" may be considered as an instinctual basis for a species transcending empathetic disposition of humans, it provides no sufficient foundation for ethics. Any ethical stance involves intellectual, moral, and emotional decisions by the individual subject as a culturally embedded agent. And such decisions are neither merely conditioned by objective natural laws, genetic dispositions, or cultural contexts, nor do they take place in an ahistorical vacuum of free subjective self-determination. Instead, they are mediated and ultimately made possible by the com municative medium of language and of texts. The dialogue between ecology and ethics, and the dialogue between the natural sciences and cultural and literary studies, is thus not possible in any unmediated way but requires the recognition of different cultures of knowledge, which are interdependent with but cannot be reduced to each other. Even though the unity of knowledge may be a desirable aim and indeed a necessary project of reconnecting the separate branches of contemporary sci ence, the ecological principle of evolutionary diversity should also be recognized for the different forms of knowledge as they have evolved historically, both between and within cultures. If science has become the master discourse of contemporary knowl edge, other forms of knowledge, nevertheless, continue to claim their</page><page sequence="5">LITERARY ECOLOGY AND THE ETHICS OF TEXTS 851 own unique, though by no means totally separate and isolated ways of exploring and interpreting the culture-nature relationship. In this sense, I would like to focus here on the question of how literary and textual knowledge can specifically contribute to illuminating this culture-nature relationship in ways that are different yet productive to the more general ecology and ethics debate. III. Ecology, Cultural Ecology, Literary Ecology As has been indicated at the outset, there have been significant changes in both fields in the past few decades that point in the direction of such a nonreductive transdisciplinary dialogue. On the one hand, ecology has branched out from a purely biological into a multidisciplinary project, with ramifications for human ecology, for psychological, social, and, more recently, cultural ecology, a process in which former deterministic assumptions about the culture-nature relationship gradually have been superseded by more complex views of interdependence-yet-difference.5 This is especially true of the relatively new branch of "cultural ecology," which considers the sphere of human culture not as separate from but as interdependent with and transfused by ecological processes and natural energy cycles. At the same time, it recognizes the relative independence and self-reflexive dynamics of cultural processes. Even as the dependence of culture on nature and the ineradicable presence of nature in culture gain ever more interdisciplinary attention, the difference between cultural evolution and natural evolution is increasingly acknowledged by cultural ecologists. Rather than genetic laws, information and communication have become major driving forces of cultural evolution.6 While causal deterministic laws are therefore not applicable in the sphere of culture, there are nevertheless productive analogies that can be drawn between ecological and cultural processes. Gregory Bateson was the first to draw such analogies in his project for an Ecology of Mind (1973), which was based on general principles of complex, dynamic life processes, such as the concept of feedback loops, which he saw as operating both between the mind and the world and within the mind itself. Foregrounded in this view were the processual, interactional, and self-reflexive qualities of mental, psychological, and communicational phenomena. Bateson's methodological move opened up an innovative, new area of research in which cultural processes could be investigated in their structural coevolution with natural processes, while at the same time their irreducible complexity, flexibility, and creativity were brought out in even greater force. In Peter Finke's wide-ranging, transdisciplinary project for an evolution ary cultural ecology, Bateson's ideas are fused with concepts from systems</page><page sequence="6">852 NEW LITERARY HISTORY theory.7 The various sections and subsystems of society are described as "cultural ecosystems" with their own processes of production, reduction, and consumption of energy?involving physical as well as psychic energy. This also applies to the cultural ecosystems of art and of literature, which follow their own internal forces of selection and self-renewal, but also have an important function within the cultural system as a whole. From the perspective of this kind of cultural ecology, the internal landscapes produced by modern culture and consciousness are equally important for human beings as their external environments. Human beings are, as it were, by their very nature not only instinctual but also cultural beings. Literature and other forms of cultural imagination and cultural creativity are necessary in this view to restore continually the richness, diversity, and complexity of those inner landscapes of the mind, the imagination, the emotions, and interpersonal communication that make up the cultural ecosystems of modern humans, but are threatened by impoverishment from an increasingly overeconomized, standardized, and depersonalized contemporary world. Bateson's cultural ecology of the mind was complemented by philoso phers such as Gernot and Hartmut B?hme by a cultural ecology of the body, which focused on the ways in which human experiences are ex pressed in language and discourse through elemental images, metaphors, and symbols derived from the sensory intimacy of the human body's exchange and interaction with the environment.8 The linguistic descrip tion and textual representation of mental and emotional phenomena has to rely on concrete bodily perceptions and experiences of being in the world (hot/cold, hard/soft, fluid/solid, dark/light, painful/pleasant, and so forth), which in turn are based on elemental forces and cycles of nature (the seasons, the elements of fire, water, earth, air).9 Gernot B?hme has developed this approach into what he calls an "ecological aesthetics of nature," which at the same time has an ethical dimension in the revaluation of the body and of bodily perception and emotion as opposed to the dominant rationalistic, utilitarian program of moderniza tion that marginalizes such values and experiences. Viewed in this context, literature itself appears as the symbolic medium of a particularly powerful form of "cultural ecology" in the sense that it has staged and explored, in ever new scenarios, the complex feedback relationship of prevailing cultural systems with the needs and manifes tations of human and nonhuman "nature," and from this paradoxical act of creative regression has drawn its specific power of innovation and cultural self-renewal.10 Literature in this view acts like an ecological force within language and the larger system of cultural discourses, transform ing logocentric structures into energetic processes, and opening up the logical space of linear conceptual thought into the "ecological space"</page><page sequence="7">LITERARY ECOLOGY AND THE ETHICS OF TEXTS 853 of nonlinear complex feedback relationships.11 This function, as has been seen, implicitly involves an ecological ethics as well since it posits the interconnectedness of mind and body, text and life, man and the nonhuman world as a necessary context of human responsibility, which in its fundamental "dialogical" rather than monological orientation is relevant in the spheres of general culture and science as well.12 Ecology, and especially cultural ecology, has thus evolved in recent decades in such a way that it has become a particularly promising and innovative field of interdisciplinary literary and cultural studies. IV. Ethics, Ecology, and Literature At the same time, there have been equally significant shifts within recent ethical theory, which have brought it closer to ecology. There seems to be a symmetrical dynamics at work here: while ecology is developing a new awareness of culture, ethics is developing a new awareness of nature. Moreover, it is interesting to observe that the opening of traditional eth ics to ecological issues seems to go hand in hand with a shift of focus from the paradigm of philosophy to the paradigm of literature in recent discussions of ethics. The new attention to ethical questions in literary studies coincides with a new attention to literary texts in contemporary discussions of ethics. In these recent debates, the following points have found special atten tion: (1) the ways in which the narrative mode is necessary to provide a medium for the concrete exemplification of ethical issues that cannot adequately be explored on a merely systematic-theoretical level; (2) the ways in which literature, as a form of knowledge that is always mediated through personal perspectives, reflects the indissoluble connection between ethics and the human subject, a subject, however, not under stood as a mere cognitive ego but a concrete, bodily self implicated in multiple interrelationships; (3) the ways in which the imaginative staging of other lives in fictional texts provides a forum for the enactment of the dialogical interdependence between self and other, and beyond that of the irreducible difference and alterity of the other which is central to ethics; and, (4) the ways in which literature and art are not merely illustrations of moral ideologies but also symbolic representations of complex dynamical life processes, whose ethical force consists precisely of their resistance to easy interpretation and appropriation. As theorists such as J. Hillis Miller, Paul Ricoeur, and Martha Nussbaum have pointed out in their different ways, ethical issues seem to require the fictional mode of narrative, because the ethical is a category that resists abstract systematization and needs instead concrete exemplification of</page><page sequence="8">854 NEW LITERARY HISTORY lived experience in the form of stories, which allow for the imaginative transcendence of the individual self toward other selves.13 Ethics, in this sense, is not the same as morality; on the contrary, it involves precisely a critique of moral systems as far as they imply fixed, conventionalized, and impersonal rules of thought and behavior. On the other hand, and for this very reason, an ethics of literature also involves a resistance to moralistic storytelling, which would subsume the other under one's own categories, and instead requires a "new ethical sense,"14 an awareness of the potential violence of even well-intentioned acts of "understanding the other." In the German-speaking world, Edgar Platen and Mathias Mayer have worked in this direction of linking the narrative, fictionalizing, and metaphorical power of texts to their ethical potential. Mayer speaks of an "ethics of textual cultures," in which both the textual mediatedness and the plurality of ethical approaches to the contemporary world are expressed and in which the aesthetic mode provides a specific means of communicating ethical issues in such a way that it simultaneously resists conventional moralizing.15 The awareness and recognition of the alterity of the other can be seen as an essential characteristic of the re cent discourse of ethics, and narrative seems to be a form in which this discourse can find a specifically instructive, because complex, medium of (self-) exploration.16 These tendencies within ethical theory have challenged and radi cally transformed the universalist, subject-centered, and exclusionary anthropocentric bias of traditional ethics. Instead of unified systems of knowledge and belief, plurality, diversity, and dialogicity have been foregrounded as new ethical orientations.17 In what has perhaps been the most influential version of recent ethics, Emmanuel L?vinas radicalized traditional ethics into an existential dialogical process in which the obliga tion toward the other becomes the highest possible value that manifests itself only in moments of concrete face-to-face encounters. More than ever before, this ethical reorientation includes ecological issues. This is also true of leading philosophers of postmodernism whose writings had long been interpreted as purely self-referential theories of culture. Jean-Fran?ois Lyotard's critique of totalizing assumptions and coercive grand narratives already contains such references when he links up this critique with a form of "ecology," which aims at discursively empowering the concrete, manifold forms of human life that are overshadowed or even silenced by those dominant grand narratives. Ecology, to Lyotard, is the "discourse of the secluded," and this "ecological" dimension of discourse is a kind of para- or counterdiscursive power that he locates in language, the text, and, indeed, in literature.18 In the later Jacques Derrida, the critique of logocentrism comes to involve a critique of an thropocentrism as well, and the attempt of deconstruction to include</page><page sequence="9">LITERARY ECOLOGY AND THE ETHICS OF TEXTS 855 the excluded in its discourse is explicitly extended to the nonhuman, animal world, notably in his 1999 essay, "L'animal que donc je suis (? suivre)" (translated in 2002 as "The Animal That Therefore I am [More to Follow]"), where Derrida, as he says, moves "from 'the ends of man,' that is the confines of man, to 'the crossing of borders' between man and animal."19 To think and speak in such a nonanthropocentric way, according to Derrida, becomes possible less in a philosophical than in a literary mode because the latter offers the possibility of opening the text to the perspective of "the animal" while remaining aware of its incommensurability.20 "For thinking concerning the animal, if there is such a thing, derives from poetry. There you have a thesis: it is what philosophy has, essentially, had to deprive itself of. It is the difference between philosophical knowledge and poetic thinking."21 This fusion of ethics, ecology, and literature as transdisciplinary frames of the humanities increasingly has become a focus of contemporary contributions to this debate. Thus Serenella Iovino's ecological rethink ing of philosophical ethics leads her to formulate a position in which philosophy combines its systemic, conceptual approach with the imagina tive potential of literature in a new ethical stance of what Iovino calls a "non-anthropocentric humanism."22 Thomas Claviez, taking up L?vinas's ideas, has demonstrated how L?vinas's ethics of radical otherness can be extended to include the nonhuman world and thereby contribute to an ecologically inspired ethics. Claviez points out the special power of literature and the aesthetic in representing this ecological ethics. Com bining Lyotard and L?vinas, Claviez sees the aesthetic mode in which this ethics of the unrepresentable other can be realized in literary texts, in a particular mode of the sublime, an "undomesticated sublime ... in which the traces of obligation, irreciprocity, and the disintegration of the self are kept alive."23 It is in such contributions that the intersections between the recent discourses of ethics and of ecology become especially apparent and in which the paradigm of textual and literary knowledge emerges as an important medium and connecting frame for the dialogue between these discourses. IV. Literary Ecology and the Ethics of Texts: The Example of Emily Dickinson In Lawrence Buell's influential book on literary ecology, The Environ mental Imagination, he proposes the following criteria for a definition of what constitutes an environmental text: "1. The nonhuman environment is present not merely as a framing device but as a presence that begins to suggest that human history is implicated in natural history. 2. The</page><page sequence="10">856 NEW LITERARY HISTORY human interest is not understood to be the only legitimate interest. 3. Human accountability to the environment is part of the text's ethical orientation. 4. Some sense of the environment as a process rather than as a constant or a given is at least implicit in the text."24 Let me juxtapose these criteria with three texts by an author who, at first sight, hardly comes to mind when one thinks of environmental litera ture but rather is known for her highly self-reflexive, language-conscious, formally innovative, and experimental poetry?Emily Dickinson.25 668 "Nature" is what we see - The Hill - the Afternoon - Squirrel - Eclipse - the Bumble bee - Nay - Nature is Heaven - Nature is what we hear - The Bobolink - the Sea - Thunder - the Cricket - Nay - Nature is Harmony - Nature is what we know - Yet have no art to say - So impotent Our Wisdom is To her Simplicity (515) 986 A narrow Fellow in the Grass Occasionally rides - You may have met Him - did you not His notice sudden is - The Grass divides as with a Comb - A spotted shaft is seen - And then it closes at your feet And opens further on - He likes a Boggy Acre A floor too cool for Corn - \fet when a Boy, and Barefoot - I more than once at Noon Have passed, I thought, a Whip lash Unbraiding in the Sun When stopping to secure it It wrinkled, and was gone - Several of Nature's People I know, and they know me -</page><page sequence="11">LITERARY ECOLOGY AND THE ETHICS OF TEXTS 857 I feel for them a transport Of cordiality - But never met this Fellow Attended, or alone Without a tighter breathing And Zero at the Bone - (711) 1068 Further in Summer than the Birds Pathetic from the Grass A minor Nation celebrates Its unobtrusive Mass. No Ordinance be seen So gradual the Grace A pensive Custom it becomes Enlarging Loneliness. Antiquest felt at Noon When August burning low Arise this spectral Canticle Repose to typify Remit as yet no Grace No Furrow on the Glow Yet a Druidic Difference Enhances Nature now (752) If we first of all look in these poems for Buell's criteria for an envi ronmental text, we find some surprising correspondences. In the first poem, manifold phenomena of nonhuman nature from small to large, from the banal to the sublime, are brought together as shaping forces of the speaker's concrete environment in an attempt at making them commensurate with human perception, language, and understanding, an attempt that ends in a gesture of failure and an awareness of the limits of conscious versus unconscious forms of knowledge. In the second, the snake is presented both as a closely observed phenomenon of everyday experience and as an independent, fascinating, yet uncanny presence that seems strongly intertwined with the speaker's biography and innermost life, but which again eludes her anthropocentric control. In the third, the hum of crickets in the August sun is the focus of attention of an observing consciousness that almost seems to merge into the observed microworld</page><page sequence="12">858 NEW LITERARY HISTORY of nature, which is perceived in the imagery of an ancient, highly ritual ized culture. In all three poems, then, the nonhuman environment is a presence in its own right, is closely interconnected with human life, and even if they contain no explicit ecocentric ethic, something like an ecoethical attitude of coevolution and partnership between the human and the nonhuman world is clearly recognizable?for example, in the staging of nature as an enigmatic source of knowledge in 668, in the personification of the snake as "narrow Fellow," and of other animals, as "Nature's People" in 986, or in the anthropomorphic presentation of crickets as agents of a sacred magic ritual. At the same time, it is also clear that, even if the referential content seems to be more easily identifiable here than in some of Dickinson's other poems, they are nevertheless not cases of realistic nature writing; on the contrary, their "ecological" quality results precisely from their semantic indeterminacy and from their metaphoric, narrative, and aes thetic dimensions. Let us look more closely at the example of the snake poem. The referential content seems obvious enough?it is the presence of a snake as a special creature in a certain natural environment. The grass, a boggy acre, cool, and unfit for human cultivation, is mentioned as the snake's habitat, along with the personal encounter of the child with this creature, which continues to exert its shock-like, at once fas cinating and paralyzing effect on the adult speaker. But, of course, the text only begins to unfold its rich semantic potential when we look at the ways in which this primary experience is conveyed. The poem lives from the strangeness of the familiar?a "fellow" is someone with whom one shares a familiar code and life-world, and yet this particular fellow is also characterized by strangeness, by the unexpected and unpredictable, by breaking out of habitual patterns of feeling, behavior, and percep tion. What is conveyed here, therefore, is the vital interconnection of the human subject with a symbolic life force that is nevertheless unavail able, with an "other" that is radically alien yet also affects the innermost core of the self. What the poem thus unfolds in its formal composition and its interfusion of metaphor and narrative is an uncanny dialectic of familiarity and strangeness, of the visible and the invisible (second stanza), of presence and absence (third stanza), of communication and isolation, of life and death (third and fourth stanzas) as basic forms of being in the world. The snake, as Wilson mentions, is one of the most frequently recurring archetypes of the human imagination, occurring in Western and non-Western literature alike throughout the ages as a powerful image of danger inspiring both fear and fascination.26 This is one level of significance for interpreting Dickinson's text, on which the interconnection between an evolutionary-biological and a literary form of knowledge becomes apparent.</page><page sequence="13">LITERARY ECOLOGY AND THE ETHICS OF TEXTS 859 Beyond this archetypal, transhistorical level, however, the snake also has special significance within the context of American culture. On this level, it represents a counterforce to the pastoral interpretation of America as a new garden of Eden, a colonial project in which the presence of the alien and unavailable is already implicated in its very conception of order, mastery, and control over the human and nonhuman world, as American literature again and again illustrates. The image in which the boy at first perceives the snake, the "whip lash," is a sign of this cultural illusion of mastery and control over a brightly visible, passive and literally "graspable" nature, which, however, at the attempt of "securing it" turns into something ungraspable, active, shape-changing, and absent?"It wrinkled and was gone." The whip as an icon of master-slave relations, of dominance and domestication, which in the context of mid-nineteenth century America has additional overtones, is transformed here into a subversive counterforce, and it is no accident that the third stanza, which relates this uncanny encounter, breaks out of and overthrows the regular pattern of the poem, comprising not as the other stanzas just four but eight lines. Also, in this third stanza, we have a further alienat ing effect in that the identity of the human subject, too, breaks out of conventional patterns such as gender roles when Dickinson's poetic self surprises the reader by turning herself into a "boy," thereby imaginatively changing her place and perspective on life, in fact participating in the shape-changing process and resistance to any fixed notion of knowledge and identity that the poem enacts. Yet even the attitude of what could be described as "biophilic mutuality" between human and nonhuman nature in stanza four, and which corresponds in quite an exemplary way to an ecological ethics, finds its counterpoint in the fifth stanza in the biophobic, paralyzing experience of potential threat and annihilation.27 The /z/ or /s/ sound, which occurs irregularly throughout and appears once more in the "Zero at the bone" at the poem's end, signifies the negative climax of a series of unexpected changes that run as if in ir regular serpentine waves through the text, making the snake not only the theme but a shaping image of the text's semiotic movement. Thus the poem lives both from its relational, dialogical ethos and from its internal tensions and contradictions. The narrative that is necessary for conveying the text's ecoethical attitude of biophilia encounters an other which resists narrative representation. And the comforting reciproc ity of the human-nonhuman relationship as it appears in stanza four is confronted with the experience of "irreciprocity" that Claviez, applying L?vinas's ethics of the other to the nonhuman world, considers crucial for an ecological ethics.28 As Rebecca Raglon and Marian Scholtmeijer have pointed out in their essay on "Nature's Resistance to Narrative," the best literary texts about nature "are those that have sensed the power of</page><page sequence="14">860 NEW LITERARY HISTORY nature to resist, or question, or evade the meanings we attempt to impose on the natural world."29 Dickinson's poems clearly are examples of this resistance?not only, as has been seen, in the snake poem but in the repeated, futile attempt at a definition of nature in number 668, which results in a stammering series of intertwined assertions and negations, or in the "Druidic Difference," which remains as an open enigmatic signifier at the end of the cricket poem. Dickinson's poems are examples here of a more general function of literature, which is a self-reflexive form of knowledge staging complex life processes at the boundary line of the culture-nature interaction. It is a form of cultural ecology in which the discourses available in the cultural world are confronted with their prediscursive or transdiscursive other, which is made symbolically accessible through the narrative, metaphoric, and aesthetic power of texts. Dickinson, as every great writer, is unique but by no means untypical in this respect. From her own time, Henry David Thoreau or Walt Whitman would certainly be prime examples, and, indeed, much of the best American poetry in the twentieth century, too, can be interpreted from this angle.30 With remarkable intensity, poets have focused on the boundary of the culture-nature relationship as a source of their poetic creativity and as the textual site where eco logical concerns and the ethical self-reflection of the human species are brought together. VI. The Local and the Global: Some Recent American Novels In Buell's and other versions of ecocriticism, the focus of literary ecol ogy has been very much on the concept of place, for example, on the regional and the local as the real material basis of the interaction between humans and their environment as it is reflected in the text. Indeed, the concept of place has been one of the most emphatically propagated categories of ecocriticism, with which it tried to counteract anthropo centric abstractions and the alienating forces of a purely economic form of globalization that was indifferent to the concrete ecosystems of par ticular places and regions. With the shift from such a regional-realist to a cultural-ecological concept of the text and of the literary imagination, however, and particularly in the context of its dialogue with recent ethics, the relationship between the local and the global in texts appears in a somewhat different light. Ursula Heise, for one, has persuasively argued that ecocriticism's narrow focus on place is problematic and one-sided and needs to be complemented by and extended into an "environmental imagination of the global."31 On the one hand, the ecological axiom that</page><page sequence="15">LITERARY ECOLOGY AND THE ETHICS OF TEXTS 861 "everything is connected to everything else" makes a global perspective mandatory in a sufficiently complex interpretation of any phenomenon in the modern life-world.32 In a parallel evolution of ethical theory in the twentieth century, a local, ethnocentric ethics has been expanded toward a transnational, global ethics. Literary aesthetics and storytelling, in particular, live from the double impulse and the productive tension of regionalization anduniversalization, from the exploration of concrete life in the local here and now, on the one hand, and the transgression of all internal and external boundaries toward a potentially worldwide significance and audience, on the other. In the poetry of Dickinson and of the other American writers mentioned above, their attention to phe nomena of local nature and their ecoethical attitude of biophilia implicitly include and metonymically extend to all forms of life on earth. This interconnection becomes even more conspicuous when we move from the literary microform of poetry to the narrative macroform of the novel. The three novels I will discuss here are taken from recent American literature, and they illustrate the interdependence of the lo cal and the global as an ecoethical focus of contemporary literature. All three of them deal with the worldwide impact of military technology in its most destructive form, the nuclear bomb, and with its implications for and effect on local natures and personal life-worlds. Leslie Marmon Silko's Ceremony (1977) is set in the historical context of World War II and blends traditional and modern polyphonic narration in forms which are unique yet also characteristic of much of postcolonial writing within and beyond North America. The novel tells the story of the homecom ing of the protagonist Tayo, who has been traumatized by the war and feels responsible for a drought that has haunted his tribal homeland since he killed a Japanese enemy who looked exactly like his uncle. In this Native American version of magical realism, the opposition between Americans and their Japanese enemies is dissolved from a transcultural perspective, and the exploitation of local nature in the uranium mines of New Mexico is connected with the destructive power of modern tech nology in the shape of the atomic bomb. This monstrous aberration of modern civilization can only be symbolically healed, in the mythopoetic logic of the text, by the revival of ancient Native American rituals, among them, first and foremost, the ritual and ceremony of storytelling itself. Tayo can heal himself, his land, and his community only by enacting a regenerative ceremony that leads him to the place where the ethical and ecological catastrophe of his experiences began: "He walked to the mine shaft slowly, and the feeling became overwhelming: the pattern of the ceremony was completed there. He knelt and found an ore rock. The gray stone was streaked with powdery yellow uranium, bright and alive as pollen; veins of sooty black formed lines with the yellow, making</page><page sequence="16">862 NEW LITERARY HISTORY mountain ranges and rivers across the stone. But they had taken these beautiful rocks from deep within the earth and they had laid them in a monstrous design, realizing destruction on a scale only they could have dreamed."33 What is emphasized in the rich and conflicting imagery of this descrip tion is the "liveliness" of this apparently dead piece of rock excavated from deep within the desert earth. There are contrasts on this rock be tween light and dark colors, regular and irregular forms, a microworld corresponding to the forms of mountains, rivers, veins, and living organ isms in the larger ecosystem. Local nature and global responsibility are clearly connected here since the lack of respect for the one, as the novel shows, ultimately leads to unforeseeable consequences for the world as a whole. This notion of ecological and ethical interconnectedness is presented here within a magical ritual worldview and a deliberately premodern, shamanistic form of storytelling in which Silko's second self, spider woman, fabricates and weaves the world of the text and the text of the world from her own imagination. Yet it is simultaneously presented with specific reference to the historical conditions and catastrophes of the modern world and has, therefore, potentially global contemporary significance. Don DeLillo's Underworld (1997) examines the global implications of nuclear power in an age of computer and information technology, and particularly of nuclear and other civilizational waste. The threat of nuclear war that overshadowed the period of the cold war is like a death-in-life motif that runs through the text and is emphasized in the intermedial reference to Pie ter Breugel's painting The Triumph of Death. The fantasies of power manifested in the atomic bomb not only produced reductive binary worldviews, but also a growing amount of military and technologi cal waste. Indeed, the real and symbolic wastelands of civilization that the novel describes seem to have moved out of F. Scott Fitzgerald's "val ley of ashes" and to have become an omnipresent symptom of modern society's social and ecological underside, of its "underworld" in many different senses. The text of Underworld is organized on the principle that "everything is connected," which corresponds to the growing inter dependence and interconnection of public events and private lives in a virtual space of globalized information circuits. At the same time, the radically nonlinear and fragmented form of narration reflects the chaotic arbitrariness of the waste that is the novel's theme?historical, social, personal, commercial, technological waste. From this double perspective, the interconnections of global processes and events with local places and personal forms of experience are explored. This is highlighted in the land art/was te art project of Klara Sax, the central artist figure in the novel, who paints nuclear warplanes that had been circling the globe</page><page sequence="17">LITERARY ECOLOGY AND THE ETHICS OF TEXTS 863 during the years of the cold war and are now deposited as waste in the Arizona desert, thereby foregrounding the tension and interaction of this technological war machinery with the concrete individuality of the artists and with the local natural environment. "See, we are painting, hand-painting in some cases, putting our puny hands to great weapons systems, to systems that came out of the factories and assembly halls as near alike as possible, millions of components stamped out, repeated endlessly, and we're trying to unrepeat, to find an element of felt life."54 To Nick Shay, the narrator, who views the project from a plane, it conveys the following experience: The painted aircraft took on sunlight and pulse. .. . The air was color-scrubbed, coppers and ochers burning off the metal skin of the aircraft to exchange with the framing desert. But these colors did not simply draw down power from the sky or lift it from the landforms around us. They pushed and pulled. They were in conflict with each other, to be read emotionally, skin pigments and industrial grays and a rampant red appearing repeatedly through the piece?the red of something released, a burst sac, all blood-pus thickness and runny underyellow. And the other planes, decolored, still wearing spooky fabric over the windscreen panels and engines, dead-souled, waiting to be primed.35 Clearly, art here becomes a force of returning life to a death culture symbolized by the planes and their cold war past. The apparently dead material is transformed into a living energy field in which the exchange between technological civilization and the natural environment becomes the focus of aesthetic experience. In an excessive imagery of wildness, color, conflict, sickness, and the grotesque, the artistic transformation of the waste products of a life-threatening technology is staged as a mon strous form of birth. Klara Sax's project is an intermedial representation of that postmodern waste art which characterizes DeLillo's novel as a whole. The transforming power of art that reconnects culture to nature, civilizational structures to vital energies of life, is an ecological force within culture which simultaneously acts as an ethical force of cultural criticism and self-renewal. Finally, Jewish-American writer Marc Estrin's Insect Dreams (2002) is a political novel in which Gregor Samsa from Franz Kafka's Metamorphosis, who has turned into a human-sized cockroach, does not die as in Kafka's story but survives and, separated from his family, lives on as a half-human, half-animal being. By this double identity, he has intimate knowledge of both cultural and natural phenomena and is, therefore, an exemplary narrative medium for a cultural-ecological diagnosis of modern civiliza tion. After some years as an exhibit in a freak show in Vienna, Gregor escapes the rising threat of anti-Semitism and emigrates to America in the 1920s, where, from humble beginnings as a liftboy, he rapidly moves</page><page sequence="18">864 NEW LITERARY HISTORY up the social ladder and, in the 1930s, becomes a member of Franklin D. Roosevelt's kitchen cabinet and advisor of the president. Because of his competence as a risk manager, he is engaged to collaborate on the Manhattan Project, the project that developed the atomic bomb in response to Einstein's warning that Nazi Germany was working toward this goal. Gregor moves to Los Alamos and initially participates in the project, but distances himself from it when it is continued even though the Germans have abandoned their nuclear plans. In his double perspective as outsider and insider, in his exceptional intellectual talents and in his equally exceptional ecoethical sensibility symbolized by his never-healing wound, this human-animal hybrid comes to represent an unsuccessful but eloquent and highly moving oppositional voice to the preparations for the nuclear bomb. For his views, he enlists the support of the major cultural achievements in world history in the fields of philosophy, litera ture, music, and science, which are interspersed with a wealth of histori cal material and with detailed descriptions of social milieus and natural environments, turning his narrative into a powerful counterdiscourse to the actual military and political developments of the era. In its fusion of history and fiction, serious philosophical reflection and playful bricolage, political satire and deeply felt sympathy with all living beings, the novel assumes a consciously unstable shifting tone from which the contradictory developments of Western civilization in the first half of the twentieth century, between the forces of democratization and dehumanization, are traced. In a truly cosmopolitan manner, the novel incorporates all sorts of different sources, modes, and genres. It not only fuses scientific and literary culture, but also makes reference to texts and artifacts from Western and non-Western cultures alike, particularly to Japanese culture as the culture of the enemies against whom the bombs are to be used. At the end of the novel, the plot escalates to its grotesque fantastic climax when a nuclear test is conducted in Alamog ordo, New Mexico, on July 16, 1945, a few days before the dropping of the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Gregor, who feels helpless against the inexorable course of events, performs a final, self-sacrificing act of protest by hiding at the explosion site and letting himself be blown up with the bomb. The concrete locality of the test site in the Jornada del Muerto desert becomes the focal point of a global message of protest, and the destructive technological use of the powers of nature is symboli cally staged as an act of human self-destruction. This "most expensive assisted suicide in history" represents, however, not a purely fatalistic conclusion to the novel.36 As a symptom of the death culture in which Gregor has become imprisoned, it simultaneously marks the final stage and culmination point of his ongoing "metamorphosis" and thus main tains, against all odds, the life-affirming, counterdiscursive energy flow</page><page sequence="19">LITERARY ECOLOGY AND THE ETHICS OF TEXTS 865 of the text. "Tief und tausendfach zu leben" ("?o live deeply?thousand fold") is the quotation from Richard Strauss with which Gregor's friend, Dr. Bernard, many decades later at the beginning of the new millenium and confronted with his own approaching death, interprets the secret meaning of Gregor's subversive use of the Manhattan Project.37 It is an imaginative fullness of life that is envisioned here as a counterfantasy to the human-made catastrophes of the twentieth century, and that is opened up by the novel itself for the reader, who can share Gregor's story as a testament of unrealized alternatives to the actual course of history that are still relevant for us today. As I have tried to argue in my paper, literature is a form of cultural knowledge which stages, in the medium of language and discourse itself, complex dynamical processes of life on the boundary of the culture-nature interaction. It is a "reintegrative interdiscourse" in which the dichotomies of mind and body, intellect and emotion, culture and nature are overcome, and different areas of knowledge such as politics, history, science, art, philosophy, religion, music, and literature are brought together in ecosemiotic networks of signs that transgress the separation between disciplines and cultures.38 If literature in this sense is the self-reflexive staging of complex life processes, then literary studies are, as Ottmar Ette has recently argued, not only a textual science but a form of "life science" as well, though a form of life science different from the biological or neurological sciences.39 Their disadvantage from a currently dominant utilitarian perspective may be that the kind of knowledge they produce is depragmatized; in other words, that it can not be translated into political, social, or economic practice as easily as other forms of knowledge. But their advantage is that their models of life specifically focus on those interrelated dimensions of ecology and ethics that other forms of knowledge tend to neglect but which are es sential for the evolution of that new global consciousness that we need to meet the challenges of the future.

WTiat animal? The other. I often ask myself, just to see, who I am?and which I am (following) at the moment when, caught naked, in silence, by the gaze of an animal, for example the eyes of a cat, I have trouble, yes, a bad time overcoming my embarrassment" (Derrida, 'The Animal," 372). Later he continues, "Although time prevents it, I would of course have liked to inscribe my whole talk within a reading of Lewis Carroll. In fact you can't be certain that I am not doing that, for better or worse, silently, unconsciously, or without your knowing. You can't be certain that I didn't already do it one day when, ten years ago, I let speak or let pass a little hedgehog, a suckling hedgehog {un nourrisson h?risson) perhaps, before the question 'W^hat Is Poetry?' For thinking concerning the animal, if there is such a thing, derives from poetry. There you have a hypothesis: it is what philosophy has, essentially, had to deprive itself of.
