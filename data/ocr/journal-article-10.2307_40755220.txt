<plain_text><page sequence="1">PAUL McBREARTY Wallace Stevens's "Like Decorations in a Nigger Cemetery": Notes toward an Explication The major subject of "Decorations" is death and dying- how to think about them and face them now that death means, not a passage to a better world, but a passage to nothingness, the end of everything. Interwoven with the theme of death and dissolution is the countertheme so often, if not always, present in Stevens's poetry: the relation between reality and the imagination, between the phenomenal world and the created world of the artist. The themes are not unrelated: it is the imagination, the full power of which man can turn upon the objects of the external world and upon himself, which makes it possible to contemplate death with something like calmness and resignation. Though unified by elements of setting (time of day, late afternoon; season, autumn; place, a cemetery; weather, frost and snow) and theme, the poem does create an impression of disunity. (The latter defect may be only apparent and in our reading. However, the difficulty of reading lies by no means entirely with the reader. There is certainly significance in the fact that virtually no full-scale explications of this poem have been attempted.)1 The 1 Of all Stevens's long poems this one seems to have been dealt with least. I have found no treatments of considerable length prior to 1960 and only two written since that year. The latter are by Ardyth Bradley, "Wallace Stevens' Decorations," Twentieth Century Literature, 7 (October, 1961 ), 1 14-1 17; and Helen Hennessy Vendler, ''Stevens' 'Like Decorations in a Nigger Cemetery,' " Massachusetts Review, 1 (Winter, 1966), 136-146, substantially reprinted in Helen Hennessy Vendler, On Extended Wings: Wal- lace Stevens' Longer Poems (Cambridge, Mass., 1969), pp. 65-78. Neither is a complete reading, though Mrs. Vendler's brilliant essay approaches one. Stevens critics commonly allude to the poem tangentially, typically selecting a line or two for quotation but rarely passing beyond general remarks about the poem's apparent disunity or obscurity. Ronald Sukenick, for example, in a work devoted to readings of Stevens' poems- Wallace Ste- vens: Musing the Obscure (New York, 1967)-allots this long poem only a few lines. Using a term by which Stevens had once referred to it, he calls the poem "a 'litter' of observations dealing with the conditions of life on Stevens' naturalistic assumptions" (p. 220). The dearth of attention to "Decorations" has been noted before. John J. Enck, in Wallace Stevens: Images and Judgments (Carbondale, 111., 1964), observing that "books which scrutinize Stevens' work intently, . . . ignore or slight this one," hypothesizes that "The Idea of Order at Key West" "fits more neatly into schemes." Nevertheless, Enck believes that "for [Stevens's] full growth in terms of practice, this poem becomes almost crucial" (p. 111). Enck sees the poem as staging "almost a rehearsal for the long poems Texas Studies in Literature and Language XV.2 (Summer, 1973)</page><page sequence="2">342 PAUL McBREARTY fifty sections of the poem are, for the most part, discontinuous;2 there are no transitions between them; many make no grammatically complete assertions; many lack verbs. The poem is a series of pensées, meditations. We know that Stevens read Pascal3 and de la Rochefoucauld4 and that he was given to aphoristic expres- sion in prose, as evidenced in the Adagia. But the poem is also a series of pictures, scenes, still lifes, tableaux. It is full of metaphors drawn from painting and the theater. Here, too, as in so many of Stevens's poems, "poetry is the subject of the poem," but it is not the only one. In a letter to Morton Dauwen Zabel, Stevens said that the title refers to "the litter that one usually finds in a nigger cemetery and is a phrase used by Judge Powell last winter in Key West" (Letters, p. 272), perhaps in this way likening these interior ruminations to the odd bits and pieces of trash and leaves which scatter and drift before the dry, cold wind of November, pos- sibly recalling the "littering leaves" which death, "the mother of beauty," had strewn before us in "Sunday Morning." And, of course, these fifty frag- mentary poems stand like the stylized angels and broken tablets in the shabby later" (p. 112). "Never easy, often obscure, the whole work predicts his maturing prac- tice." Despite his reservations that the work is "too special, too fully absorbed into Stevens' most elusive language-and then limited to aspects ofthat," Enck notes that "it looms like a rugged apex of style" (p. 1 1 3). Mrs. Vendler agrees that the poem is "a token of things to come" and calls it "perversely experimental": indeed, she says, "the discontinuity will never again be so arrogant as in this example." Whether the poem has unity and form is, of course, a problem, but "if," as Mrs. Vendler rightly stipulates, "we believe in Stevens' good faith we must assume he thought it a viable whole" (On Extended Wings, pp. 65-66). It seems probable that "Decorations" has suffered from neglect not because the poem is bad or unimportant but at least partly because its apparent incoherence and disunity and the fragmentary character of many of its sections present formidable obsta- cles to comprehension and interpretation. Despite the difficulties presented in its obsti- nate obscurities, however, surely the poem, if only by virtue of its length, its position in the canon, and its bare existence as the work of a major poet, deserves closer scrutiny than it has so far received. When one considers the quantity of attention devoted to "Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird," in my opinion a lesser poem but one with many similarities to "Decorations" -as indeed both Mrs. Vendler and Mr. Sukenick have observed-the reluctance to examine "Decorations" seems inexplicable. 2 William Burney, Wallace Stevens (New York, 1968), pp. 77-79, gives an extremely compressed capsule summary of the poem, dividing it into ten parts of five stanzas, each part dealing with a theme. However, Burney offers no support for his summarizing statements, and some of them do not make much sense. For example, "The realism of modern poetry is neither sentimental nor cynical (21-25) because the summer that satisfies our yearning begets the winter of our desire (26-30)." Emphasis is mine. 3 See Max I. Baym, "Three Moths and a Candle: A Study of the Impact of Pascal on Walter Pater, Henry Adams and Wallace Stevens," Comparative Literature: Proceedings of the Second Congress (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1959), II, 336-348. 4 In his journal, February 21, 1906, Stevens wrote: "Have just finished Leopardi's 'Pensieri.' . . . They are paragraphs on human nature, like Schopenhauer's psychological observations, Paschal's [sic] "Pensées," [de la] Rochefoucauld's 'Maximes' etc. How true they all are! I should like to have a library of such things." Letters of Wallace Stevens, ed.

The first section sets the scene of the speaker's meditations (Stevens's friend, Arthur Powell, to whom the poem is dedicated, lived in Georgia) and introduces the subject of them: "the worlds that were and will be, death and day." The sun, often a symbol of the life-force in Stevens, blends with the figure of Walt Whitman, the brawling, lusty singer and chanter, the celebrator of life and all that is alive. But Whitman had sung of death, too, and of the lesson learned from the "dark mother." The Jovian prophet-figure sings that life will not end in blankness but will merge into "the ubiquitous will of things." "Nothing is final, he chants. No man shall see the end."5 The speaker responds to the prophet-figure in the remaining sections. In section II, lacking the prophet's fiery energy and his faith in a transcendental union with an absolute, he is fatally weary, afflicted with a debilitating ennui, a crippling Weltschmerz. Too weary for sleep, he calls upon nature to sigh and shout for him. He does so in the slow-moving hexameters and heptameters reminiscent of parts of Song of Myself (11. 716-717, 733, 763-764, and others). The dead branches of autumn in section III can be "read." They are black and their shapes are crooked, irregular, skewed, eccentric. Their blackness suggests that death is an integral part of the pattern, and the irregularity and eccentricity of their design suggests complexity, even randomness. The pat- tern is not simple, not harmonious, as in a circle or triangle. Their apparent disorder is the order; there is no other. The pattern first became apparent "in November." The speaker (Stevens was about 57 years old when this poem was published), middle-aged, has been obliged, by advancing years, to con- template the problem of death and its relation to "reality" or life. In section IV the speaker reflects that he is confined to a narrow strip between earth and sky. Above lies a "mat of clouds," below a "mat of frost," both impenetrable. The philosophers or "rabbis," those who are concerned with discovering truth through intellection, find their happiness in scanning the meaning of frost and clouds, that is, of death and the afterdeath. It seems unlikely that their efforts will yield useful results. The "rule of the rabbis," said Stevens in a letter to Hi Simons, is an "allusion to regulations of the spirit" (Letters, p. 348). 5 Joseph N. Riddel, "Wait Whitman and Wallace Stevens: Functions of a 'Literatus,' " South Atlantic Quarterly, 61 (Autumn, 1962), 506-520, observes that Stevens calls Whitman "the oracle of vitalism" in "Decorations." Stevens, says Riddel, thinks "all is process, nothing final, and man's spirit, neither divine nor eternal ... is returned at death with the body's sensorium into the fundamental energy of the cosmos" (p. 507). Per- haps. This view seems to fit Whitman (Song of Myself, 11. 1336-1340) much better than Stevens, who in section I of "Decorations" put these words into the mouth of his prophet-figure.</page><page sequence="4">344 PAUL McBREARTY Nevertheless, the poet says in section V, it is the "search for a tranquil belief" that keeps men going. Lose it, we lose the future. If the search for a tranquil belief is the poet's unceasing attempt, by writing poetry, to impose order upon the chaos of the phenomenal world, it must never stop, for it is the uniquely human activity, carried on since antiquity. The search and the future are one because the poet, in his struggles to dominate language, is a maker of the culture, and the latter is the only future we have. Stevens glosses section VI as follows: VI consists of the statement of two unrelated ideas: the first is that we do not die simply; we are attended by a figure. It might be easier for us to turn away from that figure. The second is that we should not die like a poor parishioner; a man should meet death for what it is. (Letters, p. 349) Were it not for all that is connoted by Death in uppercase- the fuss, the false pomp, the mourning, the display, but also the fearfulness, pain, and terror associated with it-we should be quite willing to die-or at least we should simply go out like a candle flame. The institution of Death, however, makes it impossible for us to enjoy a quiet passage. On the other hand, one does not want a shabby passage in some remote backwater of time and history: one wants one's life to have had some meaning and one's death to have some kind of nobility. A statement like "It is too cold for work, now, in the fields" (section VII)-meaning, perhaps, "It is too late in life now to accomplish work of signifìcance"-is so easily said that it does not engage the emotions. The "feelings flow easily" over it. But they ought not to; such a statement should engage the emotions because it is an important one; it reminds us that the season of death is approaching for all; that is, it should remind us of that. The tombs in classical style which one can see throughout the cemetery (in the "far South" the dead are often placed in tombs above ground rather than buried) resemble "holy temples" and suggest the ancient beliefs, once gran- diose, now empty, of Greece and Rome. The original temples arose, however, out of a genuine religious impulse. Let us seize that impulse and put it to the service of something genuine: a lovesong, perhaps- and one sung in secret, for hymns sung in public were typical of the old false forms of belief. In the world toward which we are heading (section IX), which will be one devoid of universally understood ideas and universally accepted values, the philosophers will find plenty of work to do, plenty of grist for their mills. They will be "fat against the autumn winds" as cattle and wild things are fat with the fat stored up in summer against the long lean season. The lean season to come looks to be perpetual, too, for its leanness will never be alleviated by anything that the philosophers can do. Section X is an important one in the economy of the poem, for it treats of dying and loss and finality. The speaker meditates upon that moment be-</page><page sequence="5">Wallace Stevens's "Like Decorations in a Nigger Cemetery" 345 tween being and unbeing, between is and is-not. The moment "between fare- well and the absence of farewell" is that just after life has ended and before infinity begins, as the dying subject's goodbye itself dies into silence, the still point between something and nothing. The "final mercy" is release for the one escaping from life; the "final loss" is the loss of life itself for the dying one and loss of the dying one for those left behind. "The wind" is being; the "sudden falling of the wind" is nothingness. The sensation felt here resembles that described in "Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird": I do not know which to prefer, The beauty of inflections Or the beauty of innuendoes, The blackbird whistling Or just after. "Farewell," "the final mercy," and "the wind" all appear to be describing a single state as "the absence of farewell," "the final loss," and "the sudden falling of the wind" describe a single moment. The diction here recalls that of Eliot in "The Hollow Men": "Between the idea and the reality falls the shadow."6 If, as Stevens said of section XI, "these lines concern the ubiquitous 'will' of things" {Letters, p. 349), the poet seems to be trying to impute some sort of blind "will to be" to the phenomena of nature. Thus the cloud ascends because it somehow wills it; the sky or water changes color, not through haphazard chance, but because the inner nature of the sky requires it to do so. It is, of course, quite possible that Stevens alludes to the power which the imagination has to ignore the physical boundaries of things, to make light that which is heavy, to paint the world's objects in colors of its own formu- lating. But it seems more likely, from the plain sense of the gloss, that the poet is skirting the edge of something like animism. Prolonged contemplation of the quiddity of the object in an effort to comprehend the Ding an sich can easily lead one to posit something like a will in the object itself which causes it to hold together and thus makes it what it is. In section XII the speaker walks with Ananke, or Necessity, mother of the Moirai, or Fates. He seems to sense that there is about her something of the "serpent," something of evil. But this sense of evil and the fact that she proceeds with "averted stride," that is, deviously and by indirection, cannot make worse that which is worst: the sense of the inevitability of life's end. This is horror enough without taking account of the sense of the serpent. It is the ultimate horror as death is the ultimate evil. 6 Mrs. Vendler, in the article cited in note 1 (p. 144), also alludes to the same stanza in "Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird" and to "The Hollow Men." She does not relate these to a specific passage in "Decorations. " However, it seems probable that it is section X in which she finds these echoes.</page><page sequence="6">346 PAUL McBREARTY In language which recalls, though only faintly, the lush diction of Har- monium, Stevens observes that the rinds of fruit which the birds eat have more of the real joy of living than these our rinds. The birds peck and sing because the joy of life bubbles out of them. They do not think about it. They are perfectly in harmony with nature. They are happy being themselves. They are snug, cosy, comfortable with a complacent middle-class self-satisfaction in "things as they are" because it is enough for them to sing and eat in a sunny yellow patio. They do not question why they are there, nor what it all means. One should note, alternatively, that "our rinds" may well be these products of the poet, which can never possess half the life of the real fruits of nature. "The plum," as Stevens had written in "The Comedian as the Letter C," "survives its poems." The leaden pigeon of section XIV- an abrupt and harsh contrast to the singing birds in their yellow patios-is a man-made thing, a work of art if you will, but one which, unlike the birds of the patios, lacks a mate (and thus recalls Whitman's despairing, mateless bird in "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking"). The symmetry of art may try to mimic that of nature but must result in a lesser thing. The leaden pigeon must get its satisfaction from contemplating the undulations of its fans of silver. The work of art cannot duplicate the object in nature, nor should it try to. It is of the essence of art that it be artificial and that it be dead. The "rouged fruits" which recur in Stevens under various names as an image of the delights of the senses seem in section XV to refer to these poems, and this assumption is strengthened by the comparison of the fruits to "a page of Toulet." The aphoristic style of Paul Jean Toulet has been called dandyish, elliptical, elegant, and cynical-all epithets which fit Stevens even more neatly and which have been applied to him as well. Stevens seems to be affirming the value of poetry for one faced with the prospect of death and nothingness ("early snow"), at least the value of a particular kind of poetry, one which satisfies a need, but to which the world and the times are clearly hostile. Section XVI is one of the poem's many fragmentary utterances, here expressing a longing for the annihilation of thought, for the reduction of sensation and the sense of self to a "sense of simple space." Alternatively, the poet longs for a world in which thought did not control the actions of men; if only, he seems to say, this were a world in which one could simply coexist with the rest of nature without the necessity of thinking about it. The sense of reality, the very life-force itself, the majestic figure of sec- tion I, is reduced in section XVII to a crippled animal. The regal tiger "lamed by frost" is blighted by the fact of death. The very life-urge shrivels as before an icy wind by the mere awareness of death and nothingness, as indeed the poetic impulse withers before this knowledge. The "sun of Asia" seems to evoke Whitman's "Passage to India."</page><page sequence="7">Wallace Stevens's "Like Decorations in a Nigger Cemetery" 347 When queried as to the identity of the "destroyers" of section XVIII, Stevens replied, "I am afraid I did not focus any more closely than 'my destroyers': everything inimical" {Letters, p. 349). Certainly the destroyers may well be death and dissolution and eventual nothingness. More probably here they are the vulgarity, the shabbiness, the insensitivity of much of modern life. Should one struggle with these nobly as in the Laocoön sculp- ture? Whether one does or not, one's destroyers, one can be sure, would not recognize the reference. They are devoid of any sense of the past; they "avoid the museums." Section XIX is a tiny vignette, a scene which is perhaps supposed to represent the Christian concept of the resurrection, "an opening of portals when night ends." But the scene appears to be one from a rather bad and banal play; the actors are wooden and artificial, behaving as coached, and the drama itself is being performed, probably, in some dreary, provincial German town. The whole affair is tasteless and absurd. The effect is ironic, cynical. As a creation of the imagination the old myth lacked elegance. Section XX deals with art and the imagination. The image made in slavish imitation of nature is without meaning. The artist must give it some distinc- tive mark to set it apart, identify it, that is, to give it meaning. And, of course, the image must be seen for meaning to occur. The rabbit can be evoked or suggested in his agate eye or in his "tufted ear," or he can be seen whole, "fat, at last, in glassy grass." The parade of hard "a" sounds calls attention to the artifice with which the poet/painter captures the essence of rabbit in his "agate eye" or the whole rabbit in the "glassy grass." Stevens seems to be affirming, again, the value of a kind of poetry he had often favored in Harmonium: consciously contrived, intentionally artificial, lapi- dary, witty, and bizarre. The "she" of section XXI may refer to the imagination but more likely refers to no specific antecedent. The subject of the section would seem to be, not "she," but the memory itself which, when called upon, can summon up an image of no more substance than has an old autumn lying, like one of many geological strata, buried beneath the layers deposited by subsequent seasons/ages of cold. The analogy concerns not merely the thinness of the layer of autumn but the thinness of the layer as it is recalled later under very distracting, very ordinary, very urban, and mundane circumstances. Thus memory is seen to be a feeble instrument, capable of evoking only the most pallid reflection of the thing as it was. The hollow laughter heard in section XXII is occasioned by the spectacle of the human comedy, and its source lies, not in the disparity between what we see and some sort of implied norm, but in the norm itself. The norm, of course, is what we see- the comedy, life itself. There is no norm outside the actual. Then why do we laugh? Probably out of fear and uncertainty and</page><page sequence="8">348 PAUL McBREARTY perhaps out of Schadenfreude at the sight of mankind taking endless pratfalls. But the laughter is hollow, not really amused. Having stated his proposition ("There is no norm outside the actual"), the poet concludes, "Clog, there- fore, purple Jack and crimson Jill." Go on with the clumsy, wooden-shoe dance; climb endlessly up, fall endlessly down, men and women, though you be out of breath from your exertions and bruised by your falls. Go on doing all this because that is what you are for.7 Similarly, any accurate representa- tion of human behavior, any art, must have about it a touch of the comic because its subject is, at least partly, comic. Section XXIII presents three genre paintings, two still lifes, and one hunting scene, all of which seem to add up to speculation on process, on shifting states of being. The speaker asks us to consider the "odd morphology of regret." In biology, morphology is the study of forms as distinct from physiology, the study of life processes. Thus, there may be paradox here. In any event, this section offers three images of life ended, of beings entering another form-class after undergoing the death process. That from which the sun's rays once glinted on sandy bottoms is now Friday's main course. That which once rippled in the wind and gazed back at the sun ripples and gazes no more but awaits the icing-tube or the butter-knife. The iridescent bird is caught at the moment of change from one form-class to another. It falls, but its fall is not unimportant or nearly unnoticed like that of Breughel's Icarus as seen by Auden. The pheasant falls, and the hunter calls out something, probably, like "Yayyyy!" or "How 'bout that!" Somehow these three images of death and conversion from the living into food for the living seem more important as images than the subjects they represent. Section XXIV could be a piece of chaste calendar art: a bridge scene painted in summer and in winter. Here we seem to have a commentary on reality as seen in different guises. Is the bridge in winter the same bridge that spanned the river in summer? Probably not. The bridges are so nearly iden- tical (like Tweedledum and Tweedledee) as not to matter. But doesn't it matter? Rich and poor are exterior, accidental, transitory characteristics, much like the weather. They do not change the nature of the man. Do they? Whether the bridge has under it water or ice, the essential nature of the bridge has not changed. Has it? The ontological problem is not solved, merely stated. As one descends the scale "from oriole to crow" in section XXV numerous 7 In 1908 Stevens quoted to Elsie Moll a piece of doggerel he had written: Jack and Jill went up the hill To fetch a pail of water. Says Jack, "I think we ought have beer/' Says Jill, "Why so we oughter." (Letters, p. Ill)</page><page sequence="9">Wallace Stevens's "Like Decorations in a Nigger Cemetery" 349 conflicts, or at least dichotomies, are suggested: reality -imagination, life-art, drab-golden, pragmatism-idealism. Crow is drab, sedate, practical, realistic. Oriole is gaudy, joyous, impractical, idealistic. But cannot beauty be realistic, too? Obviously, it is as real, objectively, as ugliness, but is it realistic? If by realistic is meant merely utilitarian, then probably not. But if by realistic is meant clear of vision, unfooled, free of illusion, then probably yes. There appears to be no reason why art cannot be useful, especially if one believes that art can help man to live, let us say, with the idea of death. The statement of section XXVI is once again made in painters' terms. It seems to be contained in a dialogue between master and student. The student avers that the picture of Belgian grapes is superior to this grouping of saints (auburn aureoles). Master replies, shocked, "You pig!" Student protests that the grapes, after all, refer to something which actually exists, while halos never were. There is another paradox here, if not an especially subtle one: the Qne subject is humble, ordinary, everyday; the other is sublime, perhaps divine. In the poet's view (if we assume that he agrees with the student), the order is reversed. The grapes have the ultimate advantage because they exist. Continuing the metaphors of painting, section XXVII notes that Con- stable's landscapes were unique. It is a fact that, although many tried to imitate them, even to forge them, none succeeded for long, perhaps because Constable believed in working directly from nature, departing in this way abruptly from the formalism and Vergilianism of neoclassic painters. Stevens seems to say that there has never been in this country an academy equivalent in power and influence to the Royal Academy (against whose influence Con- stable at first worked). While we seem not to have absorbed the best of British art, we have seized upon another (the early Celtic and Pictish pen- chant for working in metal), but what have we produced? The iron dogs and deer one can see on suburban lawns (and presumably similar objects in the cemetery). These seem to represent some kind of debasement of taste and value, at least the decided American preference for representational art. The pear "popped with juice" of section XXVIII is a product of autumn, of course. And it is a sort of perfection; it is itself fully realized, in one of the senses in which "ripeness is all." The poet describes the ultimate in pear-ness, a state not to be reached in midsummer. Thus, with its promise of fulfillment and perfection, does autumn deceive the fatalist into forgetting that autumn presages winter; thus are we fatalists beguiled by the striving toward comple- tion, realization, perfection, into forgetting that beyond perfection there lies only dissolution. As maturity implies senescence, life implies death. In another view, the luscious pear, so beautiful, so delicious, can help one to forget, for a little while anyway, the nearness of death. In section XXIX the poet inveighs, not against death, but against the refusal to accept it represented by ghosts, the symbols of our unwillingness to</page><page sequence="10">350 PAUL McBREARTY relinquish life. A man must fight savagely, furiously, against his natural ten- dency to invent phantasms and religions which keep him from the truth, which help delude/assure him that he will not die. In the yielding to this tendency there is an old sickness, an old corruption of the spirit worse than any real death. The heavy bells toll, not to signal the passage to a better world, for they have no such meaning. They make "rowdy-dow"-just noise. The androgynous hen-cock of section XXX is sterile and does not know what it is. So ambiguous is its own identity, as is that of the cock-hen, that it cannot even place itself in time, does not know the distinction between the crudest realities, cannot tell dark from day. But the true cockerel knows itself and is true to its own nature, as is the true hen. Cockerel is potent, hen is fertile, and between them they produce an object, something presumably of value. Stevens may be commenting upon the sterility of contemporary cul- ture, its inability to place itself in time and history. If so, the image chosen to communicate this not very startling idea is boldly chosen, perhaps too boldly, because hen and cock clearly have comic overtones. But is the comic in place here? To my mind the brainless hen-cock/cock -hen is neither more nor less amusing in its crowing impotence/sterility than the cockerel and hen in their shrieking and shuddering potency and fertility. Considered apart from their effects (and Stevens might argue that this is what we should not try to do), there is little to choose between them. Possibly Stevens poses some contrast between imagination and reality, but if so, the terms of the analogy do not work very well. The rather violent scene of section XXXI affirms that absorption in and by the concrete and actual saves us. The mind boiling furiously in response to the stimuli impinging from the phenomenal world is a possession of positive value. The theme here appears to be something like "the therapy of the real and tangible," linked, perhaps, with the idea of "nature as healer." Stevens, however, does not, like the transcendentalists, stress the serenity of nature and contrast it to the moiling, petty confusions of human affairs, but stresses instead the vividness and vitality of nature. Note the diction: teeming/ fu - rious/rolling/windily/bristling/spinning. Where Thoreau's pond was a place of meditation and contemplation by the side of which one realized the pointless- ness of much frenzied human activity, Stevens's pond is no slack backwater but an extension of the millrace, its roaring life shared by the unquiet trees of the bank and the restless grasses of the meadow. Stevens sees in nature, not an escape from confusion and anxiety, but a compensation for, if not a denial of, the debilitating angst of the man for whom faith is no longer possible. Once again we are confronted with paradox, for the "beneficence" of the actual world would ordinarily seem to imply some benefactor. It is inconceiv- able, however, that Stevens wishes us to infer a suprahuman anthropomorphic agent. Beneficence here is not the result of doing, but of being, hence its</page><page sequence="11">Wallace Stevens's "Like Decorations in a Nigger Cemetery" 35 1 supremely light touch. The trees and grasses and rushing water "do" nothing to or for us; they merely are, and herein lies their deftness- that they "do" good by being themselves. Section XXXII offers a variation upon the often-noted paradox that poetry, founded upon and made out of the very air, as insubstantial as the breath, yet has a life of its own which, stubborn, will not easily die (though die it finally must). Here Stevens chooses to emphasize, not the immortality of poetry (for it is not immortal), nor even its durability, but the interior effects of poetry which are, presumably, its reason for existence at all. The effects of poetry are mortal, indeed, transitory and evanescent, but radiant while they last. The fair creature of an hour far excels in clarity and brilliance (and perhaps in illumination) more lasting but more diffuse experiences. The characteristic, faintly deprecatory note is present here in "finikin" with its overtones of fussiness, fragility, and general incompetence to survive in a red-blood world. Section XXXIII consists of observations on the condition of being a poet. Poetry, even for the poet, cannot be all. The hard, gemlike flame must often burn low. The poet must have some other motives for living besides purely poetic ones. He must be human, have practical, ordinary connections with the world of every day. The high, thin atmosphere through which the poet moves while creating is insufficient to sustain life. Too much perfection or near- perfection must pall at last. Mark Twain's remarks on the "gross tedium" of paradise are apt here. The mood of section XXXIV is one of calmness, tranquillity, ceased motion, even of stagnation. Yet, the poet seems to say, beneath this calm exterior ... ! How close to a romantic cliché this statement is, we see. The "invisible currents" may be merely life, awaiting the awakening of spring, or they may be the already-begun process of decay and dissolution. The para- doxical statement that the "invisible currents clearly circulate" may allude to the poet's special powers of perception. If so, Stevens's poet is remarkably Wordsworthian, able to "see into the life of things." Although the identity of "this pundit of the weather" of section XXXV can never be established with certainty, it is clear that none of the usual "predictors" of weather or seasonal change- the groundhogs, the migrating birds, the nut-gathering squirrels, and so on- seem capable of thinking of "man the abstraction." The poet, however, is of course capable of doing so, especially this particular poet. His qualifications as a pundit of weather are not immediately apparent, except that throughout the poem he has made a number of observations on weather, both inner and outer. And surely few poets have shown themselves less concerned with "men and the affairs of men" in the quotidian sense than Stevens. His refusal (failure in some eyes) to deal with the pressing issues of the day (especially those of the decade in</page><page sequence="12">352 PAUL McBREARTY which this poem was written) is obvious throughout most of his poetry, through which one will look long for a clear acknowledgment that worldwide depressions and social upheavals are even possible, much less taking place. Men living, acting, moving through and dealing with the political, economic, and social world do not greatly interest Stevens as subject matter for poetry. Man, the abstraction, does. (This is not to say, of course, that Stevens is unaware of, or indifferent to, the larger turbulent world: "Owl's Clover" and the "hoard of destructions" passage of "The Man with the Blue Guitar," "Martial Cadenza" and "Examination of the Hero in a Time of War" are among the testimonies to his sharp awareness of the maladies of the times. Nevertheless, wars and social-political concerns are clearly not at the center of a significant part of his work.) This stanza alludes to what was to become an important element in Stevens's poetic theory, later elaborated in "Notes toward a Supreme Fiction": poetry "must be abstract." Stevens is the an- tithesis of, say, Chaucer, quite unconcerned to present a cross section of humanity or to depict man as human, weak, noble, sinning, or sublime. There are very few people at all in Stevens's poetry. And, of course, there is very little of what we think of as compassion for individual men. Such untidy emotions seem almost out of place in a Stevens poem. (By way of exception, again, one is obliged to recall-as Enck has reminded us8- the acutely felt empathy of Stevens's address to Santayana in "To an Old Philosopher in Rome," but the basic point is, I think, valid.) We usually find instead of sympathy with the private man an absorption in the predicament of hu- manity in the large. Man then is not laughable as one might laugh at the antics of a person, but is a "comic sum." He adds up, not to a barrel of laughs, but to comedy, to the idea of being amusing. Section XXXVI concerns premature and sudden death. Stevens said of this section: "Death is like this: A child will die halfway to bed. The phrase is voice of death' the voluptuary is the child in heaven" {Letters, p. 349). Here the poet is concerned with the capriciousness and arbitrariness of death-that is, that death does not wait until we are old and ready for it. It may even interrupt tears. Section XXXVII deals with transience. Only yesterday there was life and beauty and vitality, thriving in the autumn season (in the midst of change and beginning decay), and it was good; it had something like nobility. Life and living have nobility- more than death and dying. Once more the poet affirms the absolute value of life. While a noble death is of some interest to this poet (see section VI), the value of life is infinitely greater. Corot's "ability to transform pure contemplation into a poetic image without literal description or psychological devices" and his "profound, 8Enck, pp. 31-32.</page><page sequence="13">Wallace Stevens's "Like Decorations in a Nigger Cemetery" 353 though detached vitality"9 again are qualities resembling those of Stevens. Stevens said of section XXXVII: Do not show me Corot while it is still summer; do not show me pictures of summer while it is still summer; even the mist is golden; wait until a little later. {Letters, p. 349) As an additional gloss on this section, Stevens mentions simply the word "despair." This appears to be the man of early middle years speaking, saying that for the alive and vital, reality is the supreme value. Art should not be used as a mere surrogate for reality by those who can no longer respond adequately to the phenomenal world. It is something like sinful to become absorbed in illusion when the objectively real is so glorious. There will be time enough for that when objective reality turns dark, as it will. The "golden mist" seems to allude to what art does to reality. It can shape and transform it, but in doing so changes it in very important ways. A mist which is golden may be very beautiful, but it is no longer cold and wet, invigorating and thrilling and all the other important things that mist is. In his great interest in, and admiration for, the French Impressionists as well as in the statement of this section, Stevens resembles Henry James. One recalls the young American aesthete in "A Bundle of Letters" who exclaims that "it is a real Corot day" but apparently never sees the sky at all except through a windowpane. The negative predication (or nonpredication) of section XXXIX again con- cerns death. Death is not a merging back into the primal waters. We cannot encompass the idea of death with images of an almost benevolent Mother Sea as Whitman (presumably one of the virtuosi) does. Rather death is an "ugly alien," ugly because it negates life and beauty, alien because coming from another metaphysical country, from another dimension. And one can never "get to know" death as one can "get to know" a person or even an ocean, because to know death is to cease to know anything at all. Hence, there is paradox and wit here, though of a grim sort. Death wears a mask because one can never see it for what it really is (because, as before, to see death is not to see at all). Death speaks to us. Its message is understood because we know, secretly, what death really means, that is, finish, blotto, nada. It is unintel- ligible because we cannot truly take this idea in. Again there is paradox here because death is comprehensible intellectually. What it is not is understand- able. We cannot really encompass the idea of death emotionally, where it counts. Section XL seems to refer to the progress or procession of humanity. Mankind is seen as a long chain stretching back to prehistory and forward to infinity. There seems to be also an allusion to the ancient concept of the 9 Encyclopedia of World Art (New York, 1959-69), III, 814.</page><page sequence="14">354 PAUL McBREARTY chain of being which began in the mire and ended in perfection, in God. If each new human being really did incorporate all the knowledge- in the broadest possible sense- of him who had just preceded him out of life, man would fairly soon reach perfection. But, of course, with each new human being, man starts all over from scratch to repeat the "standard repertoire," the same old thing over and over. The fragrance of the autumn chrysanthemums of section XLI (which is not an astringent fragrance really, but rather bitter and earthy) hides the unpleasant fact that the organization and structure of the universe is a matter of mechanics and more mechanics, a rationalist nightmare. That the chrysan- themum "comes each year" with clockwork regularity merely emphasizes the mechanistic nature of the universe. Once again we see paradox, because what seems to us to be the beauty of the flower is merely the result of mechanical processes. The attitude here seems to be a Victorian one, still strongly influ- enced by Newtonian physics. Stevens said of section XLII: An anthropomorphic god is simply a projection of itself by a race of egoists, which it is natural for them to treat as sacred {Letters, p. 349) Clearly, the god of the sausage-makers can be no very noble conception. The god is themselves, banded together in a sacred guild which they worship, or perhaps merely a single representative specimen elevated to sainthood. Man's religions, and probably Christianity in particular, are a form of narcissism. What we sausage -makers worship is an exalted image of ourselves, not as we are "but as a god might be." We are sausage-makers because we produce only more beings like ourselves in an endless chain like links of a sausage. The occupation is rather ugly and pointless. The observation in section XLIII is very reminiscent of old jokes like the one about the man who was a rapid calculator. While riding on a high-speed train, he was observed at a window counting the cows in a field as the train flashed past at seventy miles per hour. When asked by an intrigued observer how he could count all of the cows so fast, he replied that it was very simple: he merely counted the teats and divided by four. In this section the poet seems to be commenting on quantity vs. quality in human life and upon man's tendency, becoming more and more exaggerated in this century, to take the one for the other. Stevens's whole life asserts the opposite value. At age twenty-nine Stevens wrote to Elsie Moll (later his wife): don't you agree with me that if we could get the Michael Angeloes out of our heads-Shakespeare, Titian, Goethe-all the phenomenal men, we should find a multitude of lesser things ... to occupy us? It would be like withdrawing the sun and bringing out innumerable stars. I do not mean that the Michael</page><page sequence="15">Wallace Stevens's "Like Decorations in a Nigger Cemetery" 355 Angeloes are not what they are- but I like Dr. Campion, I like Verlaine- water-colors, little statues, small thoughts. Let us leave the great things to the professors-substitute for majestic organs, sylvan reeds-such as the shepherds played on under cottage windows. (Letters, p. 110) This poet is aristocratic in his tastes, intensely individualistic. He distrusts size and sprawl. He is a connoisseur (not only of chaos), an appreciator of the best, and hence almost by definition one who recoils from sheer number and mass. The poet speaks in section XLIV not merely of the freshness without but that within. Innocence is an impossible state in one arrived at middle age. Or perhaps in the presence of and awareness of death there can be no innocence. This seems to be another way of saying that earth is not Eden, that with knowledge comes the loss of innocence and the sentence of death. Stevens may see us as in our autumn and hence no longer capable of spontaneity or of seeing the world as though for the first time. Of course, innocence, which can mean simply not knowing- or something like ignorance- can never be wholly lost, because we can never gain full knowledge of anything. The French phrase of section XLV, "Yet one moment of happiness!" Stevens seems to suggest, is the sort of falsely emotional utterance one might expect to hear at a matinee. A true connoisseur of the pain of the human condition, even a relatively naive one, would never stoop to such easy emo- tionalism and self-pity. The theme of section XLVI is time- man's mad impulse to control time. The clock is an obvious symbol of this need. The "cabinet" here is the archaic word for room, used in this sense probably more in French than in English ("Scene: Cabinet of the Marquise de Villefranche"), and its use here reintro- duces the metaphor of the theatre. In the present situation the cabinet is the speaker's mind- it is where he lives, after all- and the speaker is nearly mad with the knowledge that time cannot be controlled. "Everything ticking like a clock" suggests Joseph Priestly's well-known metaphor of the universe as watch or clock. The cuckoos of this section remind us of the orioles and birds in yellow patios of earlier sections and would appear to be symbolic of art or the imagination. The sun of section XLVII, which is "seeking something bright to shine on," appears to be an image of the creative imagination or illuminating intelli- gence. Sometimes the data of the world are inadequate or inappropriate to the purposes of art ("wooden, yellow, thin"). Sometimes they are ugly- because ugliness is real, too. Sometimes they may provide a mere reflection of the mind of the imaginer. The creative imagination may have to create its own data. In section XLVIII Stevens is talking about his nearly lifelong concern, the need to create a new poetry, one which can say things never said before in</page><page sequence="16">356 PAUL McBREARTY poetry, perhaps never before even thought of or imagined. In writing of this section to Hi Simons, Stevens said: What is true of music is obviously, not to say violently true of poetry. These arts which are so often regarded as exhausted are only in their inception. What keeps one alive is the fury of the desire to get somewhere with all this, in the midst of all the other things that one has to do. {Letters, p. 350) This sort of art is not yet but will come, the poem continues. It takes a long and rigorous training to produce an art which will be able to do things even its creators cannot envision. Drawing near the end of his meditations, the speaker in section XLIX now turns from the cemetery and from his solitary thoughts on mortality and human fate. The long cold wet nights of autumn have driven him to seek out the company of others. What he finds, however, in human associations, is not very noble nor especially uplifting. And it is what he finds when alone anyway: "a pleasure, an indulgence, an infatuation." These are really what keep one going; they are, as James might say, what one, after all, has: 3. carefully printed book, a dish of ripe pears, a painting. Stevens concludes his poem on a note of resigned stoicism. All the human societies since time was have not, for all their great influence, been able to solve any of the really important problems, especially the primordial prob- lem-death. All human ingenuity cannot make death give back one fallen leaf, nor do a thing about it. How can one, then, cope with the fact of death? Does one cultivate a kind of interior deadness, freeze certain parts of his nature? If one builds his city in snow, does he embrace the coldest sort of rationalism? Induce a state like suspended animation? Or does he simply learn to live with the snow, learn to live with "Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is"? I don't believe that one builds in winter simply in anticipation of the spring on the romantic grounds that if Winter comes Spring cannot be far behind. Rather, I believe Stevens is merely counseling acceptance, an accep- tance first of the idea of nothingness, and then of going on from there to build the city. It is a counsel, not of despair, nor of craven submission to fate, nor of self-pity, nor of romanticizing of any kind. It is ultimately a sort of optimism, the optimism of an impersonal, abstract, and rather frigid sort which holds that the world is often ugly and always incomprehensible, but that there are advantages to being alive, and one had better seize them: enjoyment of the good things we find along the way, of course, but also the creation and appreciation of art. The latter is open-ended. We may yet arrive at a "supreme fiction." Meramec Community College St. Louis, Missouri</page></plain_text>
