<plain_text><page sequence="1">REFLECTIONS ON THE NATURAL PHILOSOPHY OF GOETHE DR. WOLFGANG YOURGRAU LICHTENBERG, the German philosopher and physicist, once remarked: "It is almost impossible to carry the torch of truth through a crowd without singeing someone's beard." Goethe, coeval with Lichtenberg, possessed by the conviction that he too was the bearer of truth, recked not whose beard was singed. Between his scientific attitude and his philosophic insight, however, a contradiction was patent, as revealed in his maxim that truth is a torch and that it is only with blinking eyes that we try to get past it, whilst in actual terror of being burnt. It is a feature of our time that we abhor any form of dilettantism. Some scholars are not averse to Einstein's theory of relativity; they do however object to his playing the violin. And to this very day many critics have not become reconciled to the fact that Goethe, the poet, was both natural philosopher and scientist. The sage of Weimar regarded all events of the phenomenal world from a universal standpoint. Such was always the case during periods of spiritual well-being, as in the day of the Greek poets and thinkers, or the uomini universali of the Renaissance (Morris). Scholasticism referred solely to dogma; the scientific and direct approach to the kingdoms of plants and animals was either despised or proscribed. Not until the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries did a few great scientists dare to liberate themselves from this contempt of the physical universe. Goethe was one who was entirely free from this prejudice; he was "in love with reality." But one should remember that the spirit of scholasticism still prevailed in his day. For instance, there was in Jena a professor who remarked in a lecture that mummies originated from the Egyptian habit of wrap- ping their dead in white linen soaked in balsam, and so tightly that the dead could not move a limb. Goethe was a Spinozist for his fundamental creed was Spinoza's deus sive natura. He once wrote in a letter: "Spinoza does not prove the existence or being of God; existence or being is God. And when others for this label him an Atheum, then I feel tempted to pronounce him Theissimum, or better still, Christianissimum." And in another portion of this letter: "All effects in nature that we perceive depend upon one another.... From the brick that falls from the roof, to the lightning brain-wave, ... all these events are interdependent." We can therefore call Goethe a determinist in the Spinozistic sense of the word. 69</page><page sequence="2">PHILOSOPHY It is evident that his Spinozistic creed excluded, as a matter of course, the teleological view which prevailed at that time in natural science as well. Throughout his life, Goethe fought against the teleological tradition of Aristotle. He was violently opposed to any attempt at interpreting nature in terms of usefulness or finalism, and thus refused to accept the hypothesis of a first creator or prime mover. It was his practice to consider an event in nature per se, i.e. without any relation to purposiveness, but merely as a living entity which perforce includes cause and effect within itself. In a letter to Zelter he vouchsafes nature the right of manifesting through great principles though not with finality. And whereas he usually scorned an appeal to authority in support of his Weltanschauung-"since I have myself thought about most of these questions"-yet, when he rejected the teleological approach to life, he invoked the views of Kant as expounded in the Critique of Judgement. Young Goethe had toyed with physics, chemistry, anatomy and gynaecology in Leipzig and in Strasbourg. It was in fact in his early youth that the two facets of his creative genius, the artistic and the scientific, became apparent. It might be appropriate at this juncture to pass in review certain of Goethe's remarkable contributions to natural science. Through gardening he was led to the intensive study of botany. In this sub- ject his magnum opus was the Metamorphosis of Plants, which may thus be crystallized: all parts of a plant, with the exception of the stem and the root, are leaves; even the stamen and the carpel, too, are leaves. Other investigations included the effects of coloured light upon the growth of plants. And although his views on physiology as expressed in the related treatise are now certainly obsolete, Goethe's idea of the existence of a plant prototype, of the Urpflanze, is as original this day as it was in his. He sought the very TYPUS of the plant, the plant prototype that was the model, the pattern of all plants, though he offered no definite suggestion as to the structure, the Gestalt of the Urpfianze. In consequence, and since it was re- stricted to flowering plants, the scientific value of his bold concept has suffered. Nevertheless, his notion of Gestalt, of dynamic struc- ture, breaks through the inflexible system of Linnaeus' botany with its emphasis on numbering, classification and labelling. The expression "metamorphosis of plants" was originated by Linnaeus yet it differs from the conception of Goethe in that the theory of Linnaeus por- trays a systematic construction, while that of Goethe embodies an evolutionary concept based upon direct intuitive knowledge. Goethe's researches on the spiral tendency of plants, it is admitted today, have lent considerable impetus to botanical studies. But in the poet's day Goeschen, the renowned publisher, deemed Goethe's views far too heterodox, so much so, that he refused to publish the 70</page><page sequence="3">REFLECTIONS ON NATURAL PHILOSOPHY OF GOETHE poet's Metamorphosis of Plants, successfully resisting the temptation of being publicly ridiculed. With his studies in anatomy, the so-called "layman scientist" was more fortunate. Accidentally, he discovered that the inter- maxillary bone of apes and other vertebrates was present, though in rudimentary form, also in man (I784). The "learned" professors had for long maintained that the human being is without an os inter- maxillare and had advanced this apparent difference as a critical distinction between man and other mammals. When his patient observations in the realm of comparative anatomy rewarded him by this great discovery, he wrote to Frau von Stein: "I am so excited about this bone that my intestines are revolving." Later he learned that the French anatomist Vicq d'Azyr had preceded him and had already published in the Me'moires de l'Academie (I780) proof of the existence of the human intermaxillary bone. Reminiscing, one is reminded of the simultaneous invention of the calculus by Newton and by Leibniz, and of Descartes' and Fermat's entirely independent creation of analytic geometry. Progressing, Goethe long before Darwin, postulated that man is closely related to the animal. And, Charles Darwin himself emphasized the point that Goethe in Ger- many, Erasmus Darwin in England, and Etienne Geoffroy Saint- Hilaire in France almost simultaneously reached identical con- clusions regarding the origin of species. Until the middle of the nineteenth century, the Goethe-Oken theory contending that the skull bones of vertebrates are derived from vertebrae, largely pre- dominated. Goethe and Oken beheld in the skull a continuation of the vertebral column. To date, the hypothesis of the segmentation of the skull is still under discussion. Continuing, Goethe's manifold investigations into botany and anatomy automatically involved him in profound morphological studies, whereof the sequel is, I venture to suggest, that Goethe the dilettante founded the science of morphology. The very term "mor- phology" was coined by him, as witness the testimony of no less an authority than D'Arcy Thompson, pre-eminent biologist. In morpho- logy Goethe perceived an auxiliary branch of physiology; in it he envisaged the doctrine of Gestalt, the formation and transformation of organic bodies. It belonged to the natural sciences. It was the prototype of plant and animal, the Urphaenomen, the very proto- type around which his dreams and aspirations revolved. There are aspects of this work which indicate that the amateur had forestalled the theory of cell structure in his hypothesis of vital units, to each of which is attributed the full character of life. His contributions to morphology will be appreciated even more when it is learned that his Urphaenomen, referring to the organic structure or Gestalt of the animal, became the subsequent basis for the theory of descent. And 71</page><page sequence="4">PHILOSOPHY Haeckel's biogenetic law, that "ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny," also was anticipated by the lay-student of Weimar, while the whole genetic approach to organic problems, described by Kant as an "audacious adventure of reason," dates back to Goethe. In one essential conception, however, he lacked prophetic vision: he be- lieved, with Fournier, in the continuous and steady evolution of all processes in nature-natura non facit saltus. In refutation of this claim the theoretical physicist Planck, once and for all demonstrated through his quantum theory, that nature does make leaps. The learned fraternity, the professionals, the experts objected to the dilettante's intrusion into their domain. What ailed their mecha- nistic interpretation of natural processes? How could this "master of all trades" venture to defy principles generally accepted by God's finest creation, professors? No wonder that Goethe in time became bitter. In a letter to Merck he acrimoniously remarked: "I believe that a professional scholar is capable of denying his five senses." All the mortification he had experienced was, however, as naught compared with the hostility he encountered upon the release of a new theory regarding the nature of colours, his famous Zur Farben- lehre. According to this thory, colours originate from an interplay of light and shade; they are effects of light both in the active and passive sense. In Goethe's view all phenomena of colour derived from a medium which he called "dimness." Newton had demon- strated that white light consists of rays, of waves which excite in the eye the various sensations of colour. Light rays of different wave- lengths, when merged, appear to our sense perception as white, whereas Goethe held that white light is something indivisible and uniform. Colours, he averred, materialize through the dimming of white light. His differentiation of colours into physiological, physical and chemical colours, although scientifically unacceptable today, has still a certain fascination even for the modern physicist. Among the physical colours, according to Goethe, are included prismatic colours, those obtained through refraction. Helmholtz rightly emphasized that Goethe was at all times faithful to the sensory impression and consequently dealt with a geometrical locus as if it were a solid object. For instance, he treated an image in a mirror as if it were something real, not understanding at all that it is only the geo- metrical locus at which the light rays meet when they are prolonged backwards. In brief, Goethe always considered an ideal point as though it were a real object. On the other hand, his remarks con- cerning the sensory-ethical effect of colours suggested an entirely new branch of psychology which had hitherto been ignored. Upon the doctrine of colours is centred Goethe's most monumental work; to its elaboration is devoted a treatise comprising 1,400 pages, and 72</page><page sequence="5">REFLECTIONS ON NATURAL PHILOSOPHY OF GOETHE in its interest the best years of his life. Unfortunately, the adversary whom he dared defy was a giant in this particular field, one of the greatest scientists marking the history of human thought: Newton. Goethe was driven to despair; he utterly failed to comprehend the Englishman's physical theory of science. Moreover, he eschewed mathematical theory even when contemplating the polarization of light (Malus). To this inability to appreciate abstract reasoning should be attri- buted his polemic. In a diatribe against Newton he employed such expressions as "nasty lawyer's tricks; what a gentleman; sheer rubbish," and so forth. Not having learned fas est et ab hoste doceri, he anathematized Newton. What was the underlying motive for this passionate hatred? Was it merely the disillusionment of a vain "pseudo-scholar"? No, and I think it is not too ambitious an under- taking to survey the grounds for Goethe's violent resentment against Newton. Goethe approached every natural phenomenon, the world of appearance, with the intuition of an artist. His conception of the cosmos was restricted to forms, colours, sounds, thoughts, feelings and passions. But this subjective poetic world, colourful and rever- berant, is unfortunately for Goethe annihilated by objective mathe- matical physics. He would appeal to our senses which have little respect for scientific enlightenment. "If the eye were not of the nature of the sun How could we see the light?" Do we not still speak of sunrise and sunset ? Do we not behave as if the earth be motionless, as though it be quiescent (Morris)? When- ever a physicist or mathematician deals with his fellow-men-does he record their voices as sounds consisting of a certain number of waves per second? Does the scientist regard his rival or colleague as a chemical compound containing about IoI3 cells and a plenitude of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen and iron, etc. ? Any mathematico-physical, analytic approach was intolerable to this synoptic and eidetic type of creative mind, for Goethe was unable to appreciate the poetic beauty and enchantment of a mathe- matical axiom or theorem. Failing to understand Newton, he ridi- culed him, as witness the following: "Mathematicians are a sort of Frenchmen-when one talks to them, they immediately translate it into their own language, and then the whole thing takes on a different meaning." The antithesis between Newton's view and that of Goethe lay, according to Planck, in Goethe's concentration on the event in its totality and on immediate sensation, whereas Newton strove to grasp the mathematical pattern underlying the world of phenomena. Hence the distinction between the organ of sight and the source of light was incomprehensible to the universalist. 73</page><page sequence="6">PHILOSOPHY Goethe's omnivorous curiosity directed his attention to geological and meteorological studies. He made certain interesting observa- tions, but was without any particular influence in these fields, the discovery that the Bologna-stone (lithophospor) is luminous only in the violet part of the spectrum, notwithstanding. In meteorology he did not single out for attack any physical theory as was his procedure in theory of colour. He simply ignored physical theories in this realm and viewed matter anthropomorphically, by endowing it with some kind of soul and rhythmical action characteristic of a living being. It is evident that Goethe's notion of entelechy has a certain affinity with Driesch's concept and not with the Aristotelian prin- ciple. But as almost nonsensical must be described his doctrine of increase and decrease in gravitation and his comparison of this rhythm with the inspiratory and expiratory phases of respiration. His conception of "pulsatile" gravitation as the reason for atmo- spheric phenomena is, to say the least, untenable. Somewhere Goethe opines: "The Greeks-they brought the great truths to the world in the form of gods; we, on the contrary, state these truths in more abstract terms." Alas! his mind was ill-attuned to the tenets of abstract reasoning. In his views on natural science the Greek undercurrent was still manifest, the ancient unity between the mythical and the scientific, the characteristic of the Ionian natural philosophers. Heracleitus' 7ravra peL had already disap- peared as a principle of philosophic contemplation. His emphasis on the Becoming, on the ever-changing development was, however, reasserted by Goethe, who possessed the rare gift of an exact sensory imagination (eine exakte sinnliche Phantasie) which did not seek anything behind phenomena, the factual world, since the phenomena themselves were the interpretation, the theory. Curiously enough, in a most significant contradition to this view, he condemned the Greeks for having committed the error of being overhasty, of passing directly from the phenomenon to the explanation thereof, to the abstraction. However, he condoned this tendency as a fault common to all times. He projected Protagoras' maxim avOpwrros cETpov a7cavrcv into his theory of nature, though under his aegis it was transmuted into the rather sententious dictum which proclaimed that "the senses mirror the world" was the very foundation of our knowledge (Gundolf). In his biological studies he displayed fierce opposition to an ultra- mechanistic interpretation of processes in nature. One might desig- nate him an early apostle of the modern concept of integration; the life of the organism exceeds the collective properties of the cells composing it (D'Arcy Thompson; v. Bertalanffy). He went even further and expressed belief in a formative power that executed the idea of the organism (E. S. Russell). Similar, although not identical 74</page><page sequence="7">REFLECTIONS ON NATURAL PHILOSOPHY OF GOETHE conceptions, are held today by many theoretical biologists. They affirm that the character pervading the science of living organisms bears no analogy to the exact sciences, in contrast with Loeb's mechanistic attitude towards living phenomena wherein solely physico-chemical agencies are paramount. There seems to be a certain affinity between Goethe's Urphaenomen and the genotype of Johannsen who first distinguished between the final form of an organism, the phenotype, and its rudiment-type, or genotype. To- day we regard morphology as a discipline of the signs of genesis devoted to the comparative analysis of homologous structures, rather than to the elucidation of the functions of organs (v. Uexkiill). Huxley refers to Goethe as one of the pre-Darwinian nineteenth- century biologists who in classifying organisms, utilized as the supreme criterion likeness in fundamental structure rather than mere superficial similarity. With Buffon, Lamarck, Treviranus and Goethe, we approach the modem conception of organic evolution (Weyl). This new idea Goethe for his part derived, according to v. Uexkiill, from the careful study of a single instance-a procedure only for the naturalist highly gifted with intuition. However, one should realize that to Goethe evolution was a conceptual term rather than a factual series of changes. Some authors hold that had Goethe contributed nothing else to science, his theory of colour alone would have assured him a place in the pantheon of natural scientists. Does he merit this exalted position? When Goethe repeated certain of Newton's experiments in optics, he resolved that he would not accept Newton's interpretation of complex phenomena as the foundation of a theory of light. How could the British scholar venture to explain the elementary, the simple through the medium of the complex, the compound? His German antagonist had gained his whole insight into nature from the realm of perception and therefore opposed any mathematical system of axioms, especially mathematical physics which seeks the abstract law or equation beneath the real appearance. His clash with Newton was not an antinomy between two theories, but one between two irreconcilable Weltanschauungen. The universalist of Weimar sought truth in the world of appearance, the mathematician of Cambridge in the realm of number and ratio. Goethe's aversion to microscope and telescope completely dissociated him from the newly risen mathematico-technical approach to natural science. Newton endea- voured to eliminate, as far as possible, any psychological or even physiological considerations. Goethe, per contra, discoursed upon the sensory-ethical effects of colours! It may seem strange, though it is fact, that the great physiologists Johannes Miiller and Purkinje inspired by this original concept, were upon their own admission stimulated in their investigations of sense-physiology. 75</page><page sequence="8">PHILOSOPHY Goethe probably assumed that one would know little of colours, unless one proceeded ab initio from subjective sensibility to colours. Hence, the physical investigation of colours could not but lead to a result that was at odds with colour sensibility and its perceptual characteristic. Bavink, whose recent death removed from our midst perhaps one of the profoundest of natural philosophers, demon- strated how incorrect was this conclusion. Goethe was not aware that mathematics employs a deductive method, whereas physics proceeds by induction, i.e. the science of physics is at any moment susceptible to augmentation of its data and thus to new formulation of its conceptual systems. The foregoing truism finds corroboration in Planck's masterly exposition of Goethe's doctrine of colours. The author of this doctrine was prone to err through his inability to appreciate the epochal progress that had been made in physical optics. He was totally unable to discriminate between the ray of light as analysed in an objective scientific manner and the conscious sensation it engendered. True, Goethe endeavoured to reconcile the eternal antagonism between metaphysical and positivistic views in science. But can one follow Planck, Bavink and Jaspers who recog- nize in certain modern trends of physics a confirmation of Goethe's all-embracing idea of totality? In his brilliant study on The Goethean and Newtonian Theories of Colour in the Light of Modern Physics the theoretical physicist Heisenberg has produced an illuminating analytical treatise, far more profound than any I have yet en- countered. The theories of Newton and Goethe, he avers, deal with a fundamentally different universe of discourse. Whereas the physi- cist's first requirement is to separate the subjective from the objec- tive-a conditio sine qua non for his research-Goethe defied that necessity by pleading for a more alive, dynamic natural science. Newtonian optics became an exact science whereby physicists were enabled to enter a realm which was beyond the reach of immediate sense perception. It attempted to order the world of colours mathe- matically as successfully as it ordered mechanics. Goethe approached his doctrine of colours actuated by the desire to furnish a systematic description of colour phenomena in art. In mathematics, Newton found the one and only instrument for scientific cognition of real nature, the only means for the concatenation of the varied facts observable in the physical universe. Without such a mathematical theory of light, mankind would have had to forgo such aids as the telescope and microscope. Natural science in the Newtonian sense counts, measures and endeavours by strict laws to bind even chance and accident. There could not be any greater divergence of paths of experience, of degrees of reality! Natural science in the Goethean sense does claim to interpret events, not to analyse them. The primacy of the senses postulates not any mathematization, but the 76</page><page sequence="9">REFLECTIONS ON NATURAL PHILOSOPHY OF GOETHE coherence of events in the inner self. By positing a mathematico- axiomatic system, the theoretical physicist reduces the multiplicity of natural phenomena to an abstract configuration. Goethe's objec- tion was that the results of such investigations, physical or mathe- matical, were no longer of the same nature as the phenomena origi- nally subjected to inquiry. It is conceivable that even a modern physicist might not share the foible common to "exact" scientists of refusing to pursue the Goethean approach. Does any proof, however, exist for the assump- tion that Goethe's doctrine of colours contains mathematical notions in their purest forms analogous to the theories of symmetries and numbers (Heisenberg)? Can Kepler's harmony of the spheres which he envisaged while calculating his planetary laws be likened to the eidetic, subjective, almost poetic presentation of Goethe's colour theory? Further penetration into exact natural science, for instance atomic physics, would entail the renunciation of that immediate contact with nature which, to the mind of the German universalist, was a sine qua non for the understanding of nature. Today our experiments alter the object of our research, whereas originally the aim of all exploration into nature was to depict it in as true a light as possible. Could an extreme phenomenalist like Goethe ever be a competent physicist? Contemporary thinkers would, I suggest, regard the poet's phenomenalistic conception as inimical to their mode of research, for the postulates of simplicity and economy could not be applied systematically nor to their fullest extent (Stohr; Frank). The great Unamuno once remarked that if a man never contradicted himself, the reason was that he virtually never said anything at all. If this paradox is not entirely preposterous, then the supreme phenomenalist would be a fitting illustration of its truth. In his Maxims and Reflections Goethe compares hypotheses with the scaffolding erected before a building and removed upon completion of that structure; at the same time, however, he warns that the scaffolding should not be confused with the building. Is this quasi-positivistic metaphor compatible with the epitheton "And what in fluctuating appearance hovers, Ye shall fix by lasting thoughts" ? At least Schr6dinger, one of the most distinguished of theoretical physicists, seems to have identified himself with this metaphysical- realistic view. Goethe's interpretation of the totality of nature shows a certain affinity with the modern conception of integration in biology and psychology. But is this idea in accordance with the belief that polarity and the power of intensification and acceleration (Steigerung) are the main governing forces of nature? This cannot be-for the contradiction is not merely a verbal one, it actually illuminates the almost tragic conflict between two irreconcilable approaches to 77</page><page sequence="10">PHILOSOPHY nature. Exact natural science has in Goethe its opponent. He not only failed to understand the fundamental concepts of science; he categorically refused to accept them! These scientific fundamentals -were they not based solely upon logical abstraction from the given universe of man and nature? Goethe, the passionate observer of nature, was chained to the testimony of the senses, and never could contemplate nature in abstract fashion ("nature has neither kernel nor husk"). Incidentally, it has been maintained that Helm- holtz and even Kirchhoff treated of physics in a manner not utterly dissimilar to that of Goethe. Like the philosophers of the Milesian School the poet tried to reason from the general to the particular, whereas the modern research worker has adopted the reverse pro- cedure. Goethe knew full well that his power of synthesis eclipsed his power of analysis. There can be few this day who would likewise completely jettison a causal-mechanistic exploration and trust themselves entirely to intuitive synthesis. On the other hand, many scholars might welcome his suggestion of the need for a categorical imperative in the natural sciences, just as it is warranted in the realm of ethics. And yet, when he enthuses over the spiral tendency as the actual life-principle, one is reluctant to accept so sweeping an assertion, nay, one is almost revolted by this anthropomorphism and reminded of Driesch and Lecomte du Noiiy. However, it should not be forgotten that until this era of the mathematization of natural science, concepts like "affinity" in chemistry and "forces" in physics permeated the whole realm of Philosophia Naturalis. Hence one should not marvel that his "pictural" attitude led him to describe the highest achievement to which the human mind could attain, as a state of wonder before the elemental phenomena of nature. Alas for philosophy! He had read-perhaps-Plato, Spinoza, Kant and Schelling. It is evident that he had appropriated those ideas which attracted him, though he re-fashioned them in accor- dance with his own views, until they emerged as an original part of his work. Thus his Spinozism and Kantianism are creative trans- formations. To this tendency should be attributed his manifold contradictions, as for instance "Everything must decay into void" (I82I) and later "No being can decay into void" (I829). He saw no reason to conceal the fact that Kant's Critique of Pure Reason was entirely outside his sphere; and notwithstanding that he deemed himself a Kantian he esteemed only the Critique of Judgement. But this self-styled non-philosopher nevertheless augmented the treasury of philosophic thought by propounding the maxim that notion is the sum, idea the result of experience (idea understood in its original Greek sense, C8os-, meaning image). Furthermore, in his brief essay on Roger Bacon he was responsible for an exemplary philosophic contribution. Is it not strange that a man who repeatedly referred 78</page><page sequence="11">REFLECTIONS ON NATURAL PHILOSOPHY OF GOETHE to himself as a Spinozist, whose tribute to that rationalist amounted to adoration, did not even begin to understand him (B. Russell)? Need we wonder that the hierarchy of philosophers with the exception of Hegel, Schelling and Schopenhauer, ignored him? His doctrine of colours was taught at the University of Berlin only and for but a few years. Even Lichtenberg, ardent admirer of the poet, showed a polite but distinct aloofness towards Goethe the scientific thinker. His pontifical manner, his conviction of intuitively pos- sessing the answer to many essential questions in natural philosophy, antagonized the guild of professional thinkers. When he described to Schiller his vision of the Urpflanze, the poet-thinker remarked that one could hardly accept it as a perceived fact of experience, but merely as a figment of imagination, an idea. He did not realize that this was precisely what Goethe had intended. Goethe's entire response to the universe stemmed from his Naturgefiihl, just as Plato's philo- sophy had its source in a deep sense of wonder. To epitomize, a student who confessed that he could not learn anything from books, who admitted that he had never steeped himself in systematic philosophy-such a mind could never expect recognition from con- temporary academic circles. In this ambition he was doomed to fail. One recalls Hume's disillusionment when his first philosophic work, as he said, "fell dead-born from the press . . ." Goethe followed the philosophers and scientists only in so far as it did not disturb his urge to unite concept and percept, the abstract and the pictural, which fusion was the quintessence of his "concrete thinking," of his gegenstandliches Denken. It is true he had never "thought about thinking," which is after all the province of epistemology, of philo- sophy in general. He could but wreck any philosophic concept of theory by proclaiming that theory is in itself of no value, except in so far as it stimulates belief in the connection of phenomena. Herein lies perhaps the only point of contact between Goethe's own views and certain modern trends in natural philosophy, as for instance, the positivism of Mach and his school, albeit it is highly improbable that the spiritual ancestor of the Vienna Circle would have agreed that hypotheses are but cradle songs whereby the teacher lulled his scholars to sleep. On the contrary, it is not a matter for conjecture but of certainty that Goethe blazed the trail by introducing the concept of Gestalt as it is encountered in modern psychology and biology. The classical definition of Gestalttheorie reads thus: wherever a process dynami- cally distributes and regulates itself, determined by the actual situation in a whole field, this process is said to follow principles of Gestalttheorie (K6hler). The great exponent of Gestalt psychology, Wolfgang K6hler, corroborates this claim when he refers to Goethe's own papers on natural science. There is found the original use of the 79</page><page sequence="12">PHILOSOPHY word "Gestalt" in its modern sense, to wit that the same type of dynamic process that engenders the formation and segregation of extended wholes will also expound their specific properties. Before Goethe, "Gestalt" possessed only the connotation of shape or form as a quality of things. Gestalttheorie undoubtedly represents a re- action against the old atomistic tendency in psychology and biology (Woodger). The "Gestalt" concept was the logical consequence of a mental disposition which could not even grasp, much less apply, the method of dissection in any field of knowledge. The conviction that the living organism has dynamic properties not evinced by the dead organism is generally accepted today. And now the most essential question automatically arises: how does Goethe's approach to natural science appear in the light of contributions made by theoretical physicists whose activities in- augurated a new era in science and in epistemology? Goethe pre- supposed the existence of eternal, unchanging laws in nature, of a strict determinism prevailing in the molar as well as in the micro- scopic universe. But through Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, v. Neumann's consummate revelation of the intricacies of quantum mechanics, Born's exposition of indeterministic physics and the role of chance therein, the classical views of causality and determinism have been abandoned. And when one considers that though scientists like Eddington and Schrodinger differ, for instance, in their inter- pretation of the second law of thermodynamics and its implications, yet almost all theoretical physicists do agree that not alone in subatomic processes, but in large aggregates as well are the laws of chance, of probability, i.e. statistical laws, verifiable; then it is rather difficult to understand how certain thinkers could arrive at the conclusion that Goethe's ideas in any way display a closer affinity with modern physics and its revolutionary notions of causality and determinism, than with the classical tradition. Scholars like Bavink anticipate a creatio continua in nature for which the new physics furnishes an overwhelmingly appropriate background. Pro- vided this is true, and an inkling of this belief may be found in some remarks of Goethe, how could such a creed ever be reconciled with his repeatedly affirmed Spinozistic determinism? Likewise, when B. Russell foresees that a certain type of physical theory like that of Eddington is destined to destroy faith in science, surely there can be no parallel between the contemporary decay of scientific faith and Goethe's abnegation of Newtonian science. If one is, however, pre- pared to stretch a point in order to effect a relationship between the phenomenalist from Weimar and the exponents of modern science, one might refer to his remark that the greatest art in theoretical life consists in transforming a problem into a postulate; in this way one might succeed. The emphasis on an entirely axiomatic treatment of 80</page><page sequence="13">REFLECTIONS ON NATURAL PHILOSOPHY OF GOETHE mathematics as adopted by more and more followers of Hilbert can be, very remotely indeed, construed as an indication of such a link. Moreover, towards the end of his days Goethe had finally come to terms with mathematics proper: "I have heard myself accused of being an opponent, an enemy of mathematics which no one can value more highly than I, for it accomplishes the very thing whose achievement has been denied me." However, it cannot be too greatly stressed that these haphazardly selected utterances represent in no way any fundamental change in his approach to nature! It is little wonder that modem commentators are prone to misconstrue the many aspects of his natural philosophy, since he did not teach doctrine like a professor, but pontificated revelation like a priest, better still, a seer. Kant once referred to chemistry as a science but not Science, for the criterion of true science lay in its relation to mathematics. If one approves of this definition as the most signi- ficant trend of natural philosophy today-and one has to face the progressive mathematization of science-then could Goethe not survive this acid test? He was a dilettante, but so were Leonardo da Vinci, Fermat and Faraday. Posterity has elevated him to the position of one of the foremost amateurs in the history of natural philosophy. His work was done for sheer love of it, bearing out Rodin's bon mot that tra- vailler c'est reposer. Does science owe him a debt of gratitude? Have his maxims or his numerous contributions enriched the store of scientific knowledge? Would science have been the poorer if he had never lived ? The dualism of his phenomenalistic and the mathematico- physical approach to natural science has been abolished. Any attempt at returning to a Goethean state of scientific innocence is for ever lost. The development of scientific thought has finally proved to be an irresistible process. Retour a la nature, the watchword of Rousseau, is no longer a stimulus to the advance of verifiable knowledge. On the other hand, there is ample evidence for dissenting from Andrade's depreciation of Goethe's value in the history of science. This British physicist rather gratuitously states-whence the sources of his information ?-that science would have taken the course it did, had the German naturalist never made any contribu- tion. Criticism of this sort is meaningless, because it presupposes that the critic is omniscient. Perhaps no less a mind than Whitehead has refuted this suggestion once and for all: "A new idea introduces a new alternative; and we are not less indebted to a thinker when we adopt the alternative which he discarded. Philosophy never reverts to its old position after the shock of a great philosopher." Although Goethe was not a philosopher in the true sense, Whitehead's dictum can nevertheless be applied to anyone who added even one new idea to the treasury of human knowledge. 8I F</page><page sequence="14">PHILOSOPHY If one is ready to accept that there is also knowledge by intuition -knowledge without the mediation of scientific reasoning-then Goethe is assured a position in the assembly of great scientists. "The finest achievement for a man of thought is to have fathomed what may be fathomed, and quietly to revere the unfathomable." This reflection of Goethe, rightly understood, makes transparently clear the present impasse in natural philosophy; it reveals the melancholy insight that scientific thought has to confront boundaries, limits beyond which lurks the unfathomable. The inevitable truth of this maxim has been recognized by diverse minds. Science has not yet found the solution to the ever present problem: to disclose the regulative device which would enable us to maintain an equilibrium between empirico-phenomenalistic reality and the logico-mathema- tical consequences of abstract inquiry. Our pride in the flawless elegance of an equation, the triumph of carrying abstraction to an undreamt-of degree of perfection, the whole abstractness of exact science, is apt to lead us to the summit of a crystal mountain beyond the reach of human perceptibility where the truth we would capture might appear as a phantom-nothingness. Goethe's love of nature might save our sanity-will it still the ardour of scientific inquiry? "Nature! We are surrounded by her and locked in her clasp-powerless to leave her, and powerless to come closer to her. Unasked and unwarned she takes us up into the whirl of her dance, and hurries on with us till we are weary and fall from her arms... Each of her works has an essence of its own; every shape that she takes is an idea utterly isolated; and yet all forms one... She has placed me in this world; she will also lead me out of it. I trust myself to her. She may do with me as she pleases. She will not hate her work. I did not speak of her. No! What is true and what is false, she has spoken it all. Everything is her fault, everything is her merit." Not only as a poet, but also a natural philosopher Johann Wolfgang von Goethe foreshadowed his immortality in the last lines of Faust: "Nor can the traces of my earthly day Through ages from the world depart!"
