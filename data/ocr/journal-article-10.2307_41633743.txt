Peter Gow and Margherita Margiotti Abstract: In this article, the authors explore the meanings of fortune among two peoples of Greater Amazonia. Luck, chance, and destiny play little role in the ethnographic record of this extensive region, and it is worth asking why this should be so. TWo ethnographic cases are presented- the Kuna of Panama and the indigenous people of the Bajo Urubamba River in Peruvian Amazonia. The first describes what the eth- nographer finds instead of elaborated discourses of luck and destiny in the Kuna conception of the person, while the second examines why the people of the Bajo Urubamba do not make use of such notions, which they are aware of from neighboring Andean people. The article concludes by looking at wider correlates of the Greater Amazonian concept of luck and the person in forms of social transmission and subsistence choices. Keywords: destiny, fortune, Greater Amazonia, Kuna people, luck, Piro people, subsistence Is there fortune in Greater Amazonia, the humid tropical lowlands of northern South America? The answer to this question, as reflected in the scant coverage that fortune and luck have received in the ethnographies of the region, appears to be negative. This dearth portrays quite reasonably a general lack of interest on the part of the Amazonian people themselves in such notions and, broadly speaking, in any superior principles or divinities specifically involved in appor- tioning luck and endowing human beings with their destinies or their common condition as humans. The very fact that Amazonian languages rarely possess fortune terms and relative metaphors concerning the division, apportion, and allotment of luck, as in Chinese or ancient Greek traditions (Raphals 2003: 560-562), is noteworthy. Among Amazonians, fortune concepts receive no particular cosmological elaborations, and we would therefore cast doubt upon their inclusion within a spectrum of societies that incorporate such concepts.

The first case, presented by Margherita Margiotti, describes how the Kuna people invoke misfortune when they talk about sickness and troubles. However, they do not characterize the opposite state as one of good fortune, nor do they seek good luck through rituals that aim to control or summon fate and destiny. Concepts of the person are explored to show that sickness and troubles form part of what the Kuna elaborate as a general cosmic precondition of life across which humans must create a viable space for themselves to exist. Yet Kuna cosmological elaborations lie somewhere else than in the concepts of good fortune and luck. The second case, presented by Peter Gow, is that of the Piro people of the Bajo Urubamba of Peru. Spanish terms of fortune, fate, and luck are available to the Piro, and they are often used, but only to talk about things that have little resonance with their own everyday lives. Instead, these notions are used to describe matters - such as cattle or productive property transmissions- that involve the life of their white neighbors. When the Piro talk about their subsistence activities, such as fishing or hunting, the available Spanish fortune terms are not used. In their place, the words that Piro people employ refer to predicaments decidedly other than notions of good or bad luck. After analyzing these ethnographic cases, the article concludes by examining two wider correlates of the Greater Amazonian concept of the person and of fortune in relation to social transmission and subsistence choices. The Kuna Case The Kuna living on the inshore atolls of the San Bias Archipelago do not pos- sess fortune terms in their indigenous language. In Okopsukkun, the village where I conducted fieldwork, people do not use Spanish terms such as suerte (luck) or destino (destiny) to talk about good or bad luck and fate. Fortune terms are also remarkably absent from the Kuna dictionary compiled by the Jesuit missionary Jesús Erice (1985: 57), the only exception being the Spanish fortuna, which is translated in Kuna as 'one's money' ( tuie e mani ) and refers to the accumulation of wealth. Indeed, I was repeatedly told, "Merki mani nikka" (North Americans have money). The Kuna have become well aware of the wealth of North Americans, having worked as cooks on the US military bases in the Panama Canal Zone. But the accumulation of wealth and money in North America has no correlate in Kuna village life. Despite the cash circu- lating in their villages, derived from wage work and the commercialization of women's designed blouses ( mola ), Kuna people do not accumulate money. In relation to their livelihood as farmers and fishermen, Kuna life is perceived as much harder than that of people who accumulate possessions. Getting food is difficult, sometimes exhausting, as one has to paddle for at least half an hour to get to the adjacent coastline and then reach one's gardens, which might be located up to several hours away. Despite the hardships, the Kuna value the</page><page sequence="3">Is There Fortune in Greater Amazonia? | 45 food produced through these subsistence activities. In this context, as we shall see below, no cosmological elaboration is left to fortune, luck, or fate. Instead, the Kuna pose an interesting alternative. On the one hand, troubles, misfortune, prédation, and sickness are part of their cosmological elabora- tions, constituting what could be labeled as the cosmic preconditions or the cosmological 'given' of the Kuna world. On the other hand, while misfortune matters, alternative notions such as luck, chance, and fortune are remarkably poorly elaborated in Kuna discourse. This is indeed a false paradox and can be resolved by considering where Kuna elaborations are instead directed- that is, not on misfortune but on what causes it. Malevolent Intentions Broadly speaking, the Kuna hold that a range of occurrences that might seem to be tragically accidental are caused either by malevolent demons ( niakana ) and spirits or by a person's own ignorance, inexperience, or underestimation of those forces. A word that addresses these maleficent beings is poni (pl. ponikanà). It is a generic term and applies to various types of invisible spir- its and also to some animals and objects termed as ponikana in relation to humans (cf. Chapin 1983; Nordenskiöld 1938; Severi 1993). This accords with the notion that they 'give ponV (poni ukke , or poni nasikke, 'to hang ponV) to the latter. People translate the expression poni nikka with the Spanish tener enfermedad or estar enfermo (to be sick) or tener problemas (to be in trouble) . Living with the Kuna, one quickly realizes that poni designates troubles, peril- ous matters, and sicknesses. Indeed, it signifies a multiplicity of intentional beings populating the world alongside Kuna humans and, due to the attributes malevolently passed on to these spirits, connotes relational modes that are conducive to illness. Therefore, some forest and marine animals, such as snakes, anteaters, jag- uars, sea turtles, and sharks, can be termed ponikana for cosmological and experiential reasons based on their predatory modes. But invisible ponikana can appear to a person in dreams or occasionally in the forest as an animal, in anthropomorphic form or as a monstrously gigantic or hybrid figure. Among the Emberá- neighbors and former enemies of the Kuna- the Kuna term poni finds a cognate in the term hai (spirit, devil), described by Kane (1994: 90) as a transparent moving principle that ignores biological limits and borrows several forms for appearance's sake. This is similar to the way that Amazoni- ans describe their world as being populated by entities defined not by specific and permanent biological attributes but rather by their metamorphic capacity, uncanny nature, and intentional malevolence toward humans. Whether the phenomenal experience of poni occurs by chance, by illusion, or by design, it is difficult to say. It is acknowledged that ponikana can be somehow randomly encountered in the land near the village, where a man does his gardening, fishing, or occasional hunting. Narratives and gossip about uncanny encounters fill up the evenings of male kin and friends who gather together before sleep. A man is mocked for what he just experienced in the</page><page sequence="4">46 I Peter Gow and Margherita Margiotti forest at dusk. He tells that he looked over his shoulder and saw a poni. The fright transformed his body and his perceptions of parts of it. His head was expanding when he gathered up his courage and shouted loudly, otherwise his soul could have fled off. He realized that the intense fear that he had just experienced was an illusion. A branch seemed to take on a human shape, or maybe it was the wind moving its leaves. The world of appearances is decep- tive, and "what you see is not necessarily what you get" (Rivière 1994: 256). Indeed, as reported in other accounts, ponikana are disguised and appear to the person in various anthropomorphic and animal forms, either frightening him or her or giving a spectrum of diseases when encounters- particularly in dreams- turn from being sporadic into habitual. More often, ponikana remain invisible, and a person discovers only afterward that she or he bumped into one of them. For instance, Kuna men hold that majestic trees might be poni- kana's dwellings and will avoid cutting them. But ponikana leave invisible tracks on the forest floor or hang invisible vines on the trees. Whether or not a man has touched them depends on the malaise and sickness that he feels when he is back home. This is because ponikana ensnare people in a spectrum of serious sicknesses (fever, blood and fluid letting, madness) and sudden depletion of strength and vitality. Poni is thus felt intensely in the perceptual transformations of the suf- fering body that are caused, as people say, by the vicinity between a person's soul and that of a poni. In the words of a Kuna man, "Ponikana came into the world before us, and they are the forefathers of maladies. We all have poni. It is just that we cannot see them" - unless one is a shaman. The sick body is the phenomenal register or mirror of what is actually happening in the invisible world ( ney purpalet ) of spirits, doubles, shad- ows, images, and souls. Kuna elders and specialists say that the soul of a sick person is stuck to a specific poni and is being transported by canoe to its underworld dwelling. Whether one experiences malaise or acute pain depends on how far away the soul is moving. In shamanic accounts, what the physical body registers is the forced space-time movement of the soul from its usual material container - the body - to another invisible container- a canoe (uZu)- as it is being transported to the dwelling of a specific poni. In line with this, Kuna people usually describe their perceptual experience of maladies in terms of seasickness, which fits with the image of the soul moving far away from the here and now of the material body. This knowledge is available in visual terms only to the shaman, called seer (nele), who is able to see the internal scenario of polymorphic spirits affecting the patient. The Kuna imag- ine the seer to be partly shut off from the world of Kuna humans (cf. Fortis 2010) as he or she is attached to ponikana via marriage and affinal relations. Along with maintaining a daily life in the village, the seer marries underworld and learns from his or her poni father-in-law of the spectrum of ponikana that affect Kuna humans, resulting in malaise and sickness. Vision is fundamental in explaining the causes of human suffering. But the shaman does not reveal what brings about one's misfortune; rather, she or he tells who has malignant intentions and causes one to suffer. Illnesses are cosmologica! principles, the</page><page sequence="5">Is There Fortune in Greater Amazonia? | 47 given of Kuna ontology, and indeed are inextricable from what makes life per- manently dangerous for the Kuna. The Hardship of Life In resonance with the contemporary non-anthropocentric or post-human emphasis of some scientists, such as Margulis and Sagan (1995), the Kuna do not imagine their world as being made solely for humans, nor do they see humans as occupying a privileged position in the cosmos. Instead, their world is understood as being created for a range of different and polymorphous beings not defined by species distinctions. It is a world that is open to transfor- mation and to symbiotic and epigenetic merging. In this world, there are two interrelated means to defy ponikana. The first concerns the mastery of relations with them, which is essential to turn the merging potential in favor of Kuna humans. The shamanic complex offers the technology for accomplishing this. The second involves appropriating personal potency or attributes from other beings that, in turn, possess their own preda- tory modes. If characteristics that we would normally define as human are not, this has several implications for notions of selfhood. The self lives in a potentially symbiotic world wherein characteristics can be stolen, acquired, or exchanged by means of shamanic and specialist knowledge practices. The problem here is viewing and mastering the invisible (purpalet ) reality of ani- mals, plants, and objects, which is immanent and can be perceived only in particular states or through specific events. If the dreaming layperson can do so to some degree, it is the shaman who par excellence has visual access to and mastery of this world. Much ethnography from Amazonia makes reference to vision as the sensory aspect through which the difference and vicinity among beings are manifested. Aligning with Amazonian people's formulations, the perspectivai scheme proposed by Viveiros de Castro (1998) and Lima (1999) describes what one sees as an ontological question and the consequence of what type of being one is. Humans see manioc beer as their beer, whereas jag- uars see human blood as their beer. The difference here is not in possessing a particular point of view; rather, it is in the bodies, which determine how beings appear and how they know differently. Therefore, to ensure hunting success, Amazonians attempt to cover their human bodies and look like animals so that their prey will not see the threat. In turn, jaguars can go around as humans. Specification is not defined in the Aristotelian 'nature and culture' distinctions, and characteristics that we would label as uniquely human are not seen by the Kuna as applying solely to the domain of the human. This begs, of course, the more general question about the extent to which cosmologies that posit the nature of individuals as stable, bounded, and divided off from the 'real world' outside them allow us to grasp these Amerindian ontologies. In the face of the malevolent intentions of ponikana , Kuna people look to other beings (e.g., plants, trees, animals, white people) in order to appropri- ate their powers, characteristics, and abilities and thus become strong, coura- geous, and intelligent selves. In terms resembling Amazonian discussions on</page><page sequence="6">48 I Peter Gow and Margherita Margiotti the theme, the Kuna would say that any incipient existence is intentionally brought into being and takes on its specific singularity by manipulating the web of relations with different beings, acquiring from them characteristics that people are pleased with. This includes physical strength and courage, which are seen as essential attributes to resist the potency of ponikana whenever a person encounters them by chance. There are no innate qualities that make a person strong and potent. These traits must be acquired through forest medicines pre- pared by elderly specialists. Appropriated characteristics include oratory capac- ities, good memory for shamanic chants, courage, endurance, and physical strength applied to one's own gendered productive and reproductive activities (hunting, horticulture, cooking, and producing artifacts, clothes, and babies). They are indispensable in a world where pathogenic beings are in its very fab- ric and where their outcomes - illnesses - are in the phenomenal experiences of the person. These characteristics- in particular, fearlessness, strength, and courage- must be achieved along with the recognition and reinforcement of specific kin ties, lest one becomes greedy and violent toward one's own kin. In a wider sense, people talk about particular affective modes as ' poni conducive', that is, as conducive to the hostility and enmity ( istar takke) that characterize relations between different beings and result in major troubles ( poni pippi suli). For example, hostility in domestic disputes and quarrels is typically described as shark-like behavior. When a woman bursts into anger and is about to quarrel, she will draw closer, facing her opponent as if to 'eat it like a shark'. A man who does not attend to his wife with daily food provisions or money - or who is engaged in love affairs instead of committing himself responsibly to his dependents and, by extension, his in-laws - is described as acting 'monkey-like' or 'jaguarly'. Jealous inclinations, also seen as poni con- ducive, are tempered through forest medicines and long oratory performances, which are intended to emphasize to younger kin the mastery of emotions. Countering hostile inclinations is deemed essential for proper socialization and is a lengthy job that begins with any incipient form of existence. Expectant women will avoid consuming some marine species (octopus and shellfish) to prevent animal behaviors in babies during gestation. A baby that acts octopus- like will hold tightly to the womb and, by means of deferring parturition, kill the woman. Potential animal-like inclinations are seen as enduring. Their tempering comes about with the volitional production of personhood, which merges with that of kinship. However, there is acknowledgment among the Kuna that poni remains an ongoing risk and that human sociability might turn into enmity and fail. This circumstance receives an ontological explanation from specialists among the Kuna. According to them, ponikana inhabited the world prior to the arrival of Kuna persons, and this explains why suffering, hostility, and enmity are present in their daily lives. Myths recount the long history of inimical relations between ponikana and the ancestors of contemporary Kuna people, who fought to carve out a space in which to make life viable and prosperous for their offspring. The results of this ancestral volition and determination are visible in the contemporary nature of Kuna villages, which are large, densely</page><page sequence="7">Is There Fortune in Greater Amazonia ? | 49 populated, and geographically set apart from the forest (Margiotti 2010). How- ever, this geographical separateness is by no means considered a guarantee of freedom from problems. Ponikana remain within the very fabric of Kuna existence, resulting in sicknesses and troubles. This understanding is further symbolically elaborated in the Kuna people's compulsive fear that their islands will turn upside down. As they put it, if villagers act malevolently toward one another and fail to keep their sociality focused on a proper, human kinship point of view, the island will capsize into the underworld. This already happened long ago, Kuna grandfathers tell their grandchildren. While the village today might be the space where persons and multiple kin ties prosper, tomorrow it could become the space for generalized enmity, in the same way that a body carefully nurtured according to kinship can become affected by ponikana. Day and night alternate, Kuna elders say, without much explanation. For them, the alternative to ponikana is akkar akkar suli, which literally means 'not different' or 'nothing changing'. This is a common expression used by the elders when they meet a fellow villager (distant kin or friend, ai) on the village pathways. The form is often drastically abbreviated to suli , the negative answer 'no'. In its shortness, the statement communicates something that for the Kuna is of the utmost importance. 'No' means that a person is not in trouble, that there are no illnesses and problems affecting one's here-and-now life in relation to oneself and one's closest kin. It means that nothing has changed from yesterday, signifying that the relentless flow of daily life has not been interrupted by ponikana. The Bajo Urubamba Indigenous people living along the Bajo Urubamba River habitually talk in terms that suggest a concern for fortune and luck. "Así ha sido mi suerte!" (Such was my luck!) is a common conclusion to a narrative of personal misfor- tune. "Eso habrá sido su destino" (That would have been his destiny) is said of some uncanny event that foretold a person's fate. Although these people talk of luck and fate, none of their social practices correspond to such ideas. There is no sense that fortune or fate is amenable to human intervention, nor is there much interest in trying to manipulate the future. People say, "Cómo será, quizás?" (How might it be, perhaps?), in stoic resignation toward a world that they do not fully know. Such statements, however, can be made only when speaking the local dia- lect of Spanish, since the local indigenous languages, such as Piro (Yine) or Asháninka, do not have obvious words for 'luck' or 'fate'. Instead, these lan- guages have a verbal aspect that linguists call a 'frustrative', which is an infix that indicates that the action never achieved its object. Gerald Weiss (1970), who studied Asháninka (Campa) people in the 1960s, translated this verbal aspect as 'in vain', for example, 'he set off in vain' or 'he went there in vain', and so on. The frustrative aspect of the verb focuses attention on the delusional nature of the subject's relationship with the world from the perspective of the</page><page sequence="8">50 I Peter Gow and Margherita Margiotti speaker. The subject acted as if the world was ordered differently from how it actually turned out to be. As Peter Rivière (pers. comm.) pithily pointed out, the frustrative verbal aspect of Amazonian languages would render translations of detective stories entirely without drama: the very mise en scène would alert the reader to the solution. Of course, the frustrative has its own powerful narrative tension, as it focuses attention on the subject's delusional but apparently reason- able relationship to a world that is not ordered to his or her convenience. There is one apparent exception to this pattern - the phenomenon that eth- nographers have termed 'bad hunting luck'. Called msho in Piro and afase in local Spanish (panema in Brazil), this state, exclusive to men, takes the form of persistent failure to find game animals during hunting attempts. A man who is msho goes hunting but consistently fails to encounter prey animals or, if he encounters them, is unable to kill them. He habitually returns home empty- handed, to the scorn of his wife and others. The state of msho has nothing to do with the hunter's skill or knowledge, for a boy learning to hunt would not be considered msho when unsuccessful. To be msho is to be a skilled hunter who cannot encounter or kill game. The agency lies with the animals. "The game animals do not like [or want or desire] him," it is said, with the idiom being one of desire between humans, both the sexual desire between men and women and the solicitude of kinfolk. There are standard techniques for curing msho and hence causing the game animals to desire the hunter. Cured, the man begins to bring home game to his wife, who is thereby made happy. The cures for msho also make the man irresistibly attractive to other women, which may present his wife, now plentifully supplied with game, with a new problem. Being a good hunter is seldom described as 'being lucky' ( temendo suerte) in local Spanish, and msho is used only to refer to relations between men and game animals or women. It is questionable whether msho is best translated as 'bad luck' at all. The state of msho lies with the lack of desire of the game animals for the hunter. The desire that game animals show for good hunters is, however, delusional. The game animals show themselves to the good hunter because they are tame and friendly to him. They solicit his company, like will- ing women. This solicitation is lethally delusional, because the good hunter responds by killing them. As one very successful hunter told me, "You must never feel pity for the game animals. If you feel pity for them, you shouldn't hunt." The force of this statement is the existential predicament of the success- ful hunter, as he treats the solicitude of the game animals- this assertion of co-humanity- with pitilessness. When people talk seriously of destino (fate), they invariably do so in rela- tion to death. A person's fate refers to the specific circumstances of his or her death and, more generally, its untimeliness. One woman told me how her mother had awakened one night to find a snake curled up on her stomach, a premonition of the illness that would later kill her. "This must have been her fate," the daughter said. An uncanny event gains its meaning through the subsequent death of the experiencer, becoming her or his fate. But the key event here is the death, not the uncanny event, for uncanny events are rela- tively common in life, while death is unique. Nothing is done about uncanny</page><page sequence="9">Is There Fortune in Greater Amazonia? | 51 events, other than speculation about their meaning. The deaths that are never discussed in terms of destiny are deaths that occur due to extreme old age, those of people who are considered "far too old." Such people have dodged their destinies by exhausting all of their life possibilities within their own lives. Extreme longevity is evidence of being a 'good person', one who has lived well and has dodged all the lethal vicissitudes of life. Such longevity is valued in the abstract, but the extremely old are alternately ridiculed or pitied. In 1995, Don Mauricio was describing in numbing detail the death of his oldest son, Artemio, from cholera. He filled in the ensuing silence with a speculation on the difference between his son's fate and his own, saying, "I am an old man, but what do I have to show for my life? I have no cattle. " Don Mauricio's free association was significant. The accumulation of valuable domestic animals is a key marker of wealth among local white people, whose model of life is the amassing of possessions. Indigenous people, while envying such wealth, find valuable domestic animals to be too much trouble: they are destructive, messy, and too vulnerable to mishap. Typically, they eat poisonous plants and then die to no purpose at all. Wild animals are much better, for they raise themselves and only need to be hunted. Quite spontaneously, Don Maurico's talk then turned to the problem of the white-lipped peccaries, a kind of wild pig. He told me how, during his birthday party many years before, a large herd of these animals entered the village while his guests were eating the food that he had bought for them. He said, "Every- one just stood in the houses and shot at the peccaries. Man, so much meat! We spent the rest of the day butchering and salting the meat. That was the end of the party!" White-lipped peccaries are large prey animals by local standards, and because they travel in large herds, they represent the biggest potential hunt- ing success. They are an image of good luck. However, presumably because they live in large herds, they also have immense territories, so that they can be absent locally for years. In Piro mythology (Gow 2001), these animals stand for chance, especially the chance element in human longevity. Encounters between white-lipped peccaries and hunters are relatively rare, but when they do occur, there is the potential for massive quantities of food. So there was a distinct logic to Don Mauricio's thoughts in that conversa- tion, as he shifted from his son's short life to his own long life, to his lack of cattle, and then to that fortunate birthday when the white-lipped peccaries entered the village. All of these themes were linked by notions of destiny, for- tune, luck, and chance. Don Mauricio was well aware that local white people subscribe to an ideology that values the accumulation of cattle and intergen- erational transfers of accumulated wealth from fathers to sons. This ideology is false, since most local money comes from hardwood lumbering and cocaine, commodities that effectively subsidize the cattle. Also, the most important pat- rimony that a rich man leaves to his sons (and daughters) is his surname- that of a rich father - which is in fact more useful for the marital strategies of his daughters than for the careers of his sons. But the ideology is potent, for beef is the image of the most prestigious food in class terms. Rich white people will apologize for not serving it to a honored guest, while local restaurant owners</page><page sequence="10">52 I Peter Gow and Margherita Margiotti apologize that it is almost never available, despite its prominence on their menus. In fact, most indigenous people do not eat beef, or, like Don Mauricio, they eat it only with circumspection. In fact, I suspect that the same is true of most local rich white people. When they speak Spanish, people on the Bajo Urubamba talk a lot about for- tune, luck, and destiny, but such talk has little resonance with their immediate lives. They also talk a lot about cattle and beef, although most have no cattle and many will not eat beef. They live in a world in which cattle and beef are sat- urated with positive value, a value associated with a patriarchal kinship system that may be largely illusory locally but plays an important role in wider nation- alist ideological frames in Peru, as elsewhere in the Americas. The Urubamba River rises in the southern Peruvian Andes, and local people are well aware that livestock rearing, and especially cattle rearing, plays a very important role in the Andean economy. As among other pastoralists, notions of fortune, luck, and destiny are attached to domestic animals in the Andes, and much ritual attention is directed toward these animals, their health, and their reproduction. Indeed, throughout the Andes and coastal Peru, one can buy huayruro, small seeds colored an intense black and scarlet, which, if kept carefully hidden away, can cause cattle to proliferate. The parent vine grows commonly on the Bajo Urubamba, and the seeds are sometimes collected by children as toys. Local people are aware that Andean people will pay a lot of money for these seeds, but they are so incredulous about why this should be so that they let the oppor- tunity pass by. Huayruro seeds are certainly pretty and worthy of regard, but the idea that they could influence cattle fecundity is treated as laughable. Local people thus have available to them a neighboring social world where fortune, luck, and destiny matter and are bound up in the riskiness of treating living creatures like cattle as capital. The idea of linking one's own life-course to that of such creatures is logically available to local indigenous people, and indeed is thought about by them, but it is largely rejected as a real possibil- ity. Don Mauricio, who thought a lot about such issues, once told me that the problem with cattle is that their numbers increase very slowly, as they seldom produce more than one calf at a time. Pigs, he told me, are much better because they give birth to many young. Of course, he explained, pigs have their own problems: they destroy other people's gardens and spread disease with their urine and excrement. In fact, the only domestic animals of commercial value raised by almost all local indigenous households are domestic fowl. Easy to raise, prolific, and of consistent economic value, chickens and ducks present no apparent existential dilemmas. Local people do not project themselves onto their domestic fowl, and it would be unimaginable that such creatures could operate as metaphors for the human condition. Beyond the domestic world of people, chickens, and ducks lies the wild domain of the river and the forest. This is the realm of the powerful beings; it is their village, their domestic world. The domestic animals of the powerful beings of the river and of the forest are what Piro speakers call nikchi potu (real food), that is, wild fish and forest animals. Between people and game animals, there is a ceaseless series of approaches and avoidances, as fishermen and hunters</page><page sequence="11">Is There Fortune in Greater Amazonia? | 53 daily seek to intersect with the game animals and kill them, and as the animals in turn seek to avoid that lethal intersection and live. It is a perfectly simple balancing of fortunes, and whether those fortunes are good or bad depends on the perspective one chooses to view them from (Lima 1999; Viveiros de Castro 1998). Fortune is simple, and hence cosmological elaboration lies elsewhere. Some Reflections In Asian and African examples, fortune is assigned to the extra-human (ances- tral, divine, or otherwise) for the apportioning of luck and the consequent problematic of displaying fortune potency and of discerning what can and cannot be changed in people's destinies (Fortes 1987; Raphals 2003). In the argument of Raphals (2003), fate is the given of ancient Greek and Chinese ontologies, open to divination, control, and reallotment. Allotted or appor- tioned by divine command, fortune is a mobile force that can be divined, while bad luck can be curbed. A question here concerns the fact that fortune, luck, and destiny seem to concern vertical relations between humans and gods, ancestors, or, generally, protectors of the human species, upon which notions of persona and the circula- tion of prosperity and fecundity depend. Our Judeo-Christian cosmology offers examples of how destiny concepts carry a theological content that defines the human condition in relation to the extra-human divine. In the world of the Tal- lensi described by Meyer Fortes (1987), personal destiny is conceptualized in relation to ancestor worship and lineage membership. Fortes captures the false paradox between a notion of destiny as mystically inevitable and the actual ritual attempting to summon and control its manifestations. Kinship solves the paradox in that a person's destiny is "part and parcel of the Destiny of his family and lineage" (ibid.: 146) and can therefore be summoned and controlled through divination and sacrifice as a primary family and lineage responsibility. Divination offers the means to connect a person to his or her ancestors and to the prenatal destiny whose course she or he has unwarily chosen to change. Divination changes transcendence into immanence, causing destiny and ances- tral protection to descend through sacrifice. Sacrifice reaffirms control over destiny and misfortune to change what has been already chosen. Moving to the Greater Amazonian landscape, Descola (1992; 1997: 367, 406) has observed that identities and destinies are far from been shaped by some superior principle that dominates major aspects of social life. As evidenced in the ethnographies of the region, Amazonian ontologies do not rely on concepts of descent and ancestor recognition that posit the constitution of the self in relation to overarching supra-local identities that endow the person with his or her own identities and singularities. From a sociological perspective, the region is characterized by a significant lack of interest in descent as the means to pass productive property from generation to generation. Parents should love and care for their children, and they should receive love and care in return. But that is the sum of the transaction: love and care are not bargaining chips in a more</page><page sequence="12">54 I Peter Gow and Margherita Margiotti important game of productive property. Even where descent constructs appar- ently do matter, as in northwest Amazonia, the issue is much less one of the projection of parent-child relations onto the cosmos than of the projection of the cosmos onto parent-child relations. In Amazonia, disputes over inheritance involve names and ritual paraphernalia (Hugh-Jones 1979), not that field over there or those cattle over here. This can be viewed in the absence of elaborate theories of social grouping related to conception and rendered through idioms of differential substances endowed to the incipient person that determine his or her affiliation to groups or classes. For experienced ethnographers, it is always unsatisfying to characterize human societies by what they lack, even when what is missing, such as class stratification or the state, seems rather desirable. What other people lack always seems to be judged in an entirely negative way, like faint praise for a backward child. It is better to look at the positivities of such differences. Seen in this way, one of the remarkable features of the peoples of Greater Amazonia is their curious combination of agriculture and foraging. Greater Amazonian vegetable staples are very high in starch and very low in proteins. They are also very low risk. Indigenous Greater Amazonian crops like manioc or sweet potatoes are remarkably reliable and do not have to be harvested and stored in any given season. The people of Greater Amazonia have specialized in crops that provide a consistent daily return, albeit of low nutritional quality. Their high subsistence risk is located in their sources of protein and fat, which are overwhelmingly wild and largely beyond their control. There is no obvious environmental pressure for this pattern, and the region's people have available to them the resources for a quite different subsistence strategy, such the maize-beans-squash triumvirate of Central America, with its remarkably different social implications. Instead, the peoples of Greater Amazonia have chosen a basic subsistence strategy that pushes risk outside of the cultivated domestic zone into the wild and, in doing so, have freed them- selves from having to worry about fortune, luck, and destiny. Why they have made this choice is unknown, but the question, raised in this form, may not be unanswerable.

He is currently engaged in a project on the concept of acculturation in Amazonia and the transformational relations among neighboring peoples in the region and a long- term comparative study on social transformation in the Highlands of Scotland since the eighteenth century. Margherita Margiotti obtained her PhD from the University of St Andrews and currently teaches Social Anthropology at the University of Bristol. Her area of regional interest is Lowland Central and South America, and her ethnographic research focuses on kinship, sociality, reproduction, notions of the person, and daily life among the San Bias Kuna indigenous people of Panama. She is currently working on a number of publications from her doctoral dissertation, including a monograph provisionally titled Living in Density: Kinship , Intimacy , and the Per- son in San Bias.
