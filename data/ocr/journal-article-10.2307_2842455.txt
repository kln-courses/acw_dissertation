<plain_text><page sequence="1">1.88 Anthropological Misccllanea and New Books. Anthropology at the British Association (1893). By GEORGE W. BLOXAM, M.A., Recorder of the AnYthropological Section. THE proceedings of the Anthropological Section of the Bribish Association at Nottingham this year were marked by the attend- ance of a more than usually large number of distinguisbed anthro- pologists, and although the principal papers were chiefly of an archeological character, physical anthropology and ethnograplhy were by nao means neglected. The work of the Section commenced as usual with an Address delivered by the President, Dr. R. Munro, who spoke on the advaiutages which the erect position bad conferred upon man.3 There was a large audience, and the vote of thanks, moved by Sir John Evans, and seconded by Professor Hans Hildebrand, was enthusiastically accorded.

Several of these papers will be read before the Institute in the course of the ensuing session, and will be printed at length in the Journal. Abstracts of a few of the more important of the others are appended: Professor Hildebrand's paper " On Anglo-Saxon Remains and Coeval Relics from Scandinavia," was a valuable contribution to comparative archaeology, and was illustrated by a beautiful series of engravings of ancient implements and ornaments of Swedish type earlier than, and coeval with, Anglo-Saxon Pagandom, together with examples of later developments. The author explained how some of the ornaments differed in design from those of Roman and French origin, and said that the question proposed was to determine the relations which existed between the civilisation of Scandinavia and that of England durino the period between the arrival of the Saxons on the English coast, and the time of their conversion to Christianity; that was roughly from the middle of the fifth to the middle of the seventh century of our era. These limits were not exactly determinable, because both ths Anglo-Saxon immigration and the spread of Christianity among the newcomers were not the work of a few years only; and pro-</page><page sequence="3">190 Anthropological Miscellanea and New Books. gressed with very different rapidityin different parts of the country. Daring this period Sweden had no chronological record, and Christianity had no hold on the country until the eleventh cen- tury. The criterions of date therefore in the Scandinavian side were of a purely archaeological kind. There were a few instances of Romani and Byzantine coins found associated with Scandi- navian antiquities, and as these could hardly have fournd their way northward before the downfall of the Hunnic Empire in Central Europe, they gave some indication of the date of the objects with which they were lost or interred. In England, of course, similar date evidence occurred, but was vitiated by the fact that, the coins had often evidently been long in circulation before they were buried. The practice of burial also, while it entirely superseded cremation when Christianity became predominant, appeared to have coexisted with the older method during the later Pagan period, and could not be taken as affording an accurate criterion of age. And there was the further difficulty in comparing English and Scandinavian objects, that in England the Teutonic peoples found the British and Roman-British culture already existing on their arrival, while there was no parallel itfluence to modify the style of Scandinavian art. Referring to the magnificent series of illustrations of Swedish antiquities which had been distributed among the audience, Prof. Hildebrand pointed out first the examples which by their style appeared to be of earlier date than the Saxon migration into England, and proceeded to discuss the Scandinavian types of sword and spear, which presented both remarkable likenesses and differences when compared with those which give their name to the Saxons ("sword-men"), and the Angles (" spear- men "). The boar-crest on the helmet also appeared to be a point of similarity. Numerous examples were then adduced to show how designs borrowed from existing art were modified to suit Tentonic taste in the English series, which herein came nearer to the French and Belgian than to the Scandinavian. As illustrations of the develop- menit of style the ornamental fibula or brooches were of especial importance, and a number of types were cited to emphasise both the fundamental likeness and the differences in detail of the Teutonic taste in each side of the North Sea; and the gold " brac- teate " ornaments, copied from Roman medals or coins, were ex- amined in a similar way, showing how when the supply of models was cut short by the interposition of the H:unnic barrier between North and South Europe, the Teutonic craftsmen modified the Roman designs in the spirit of their native style. While the Scandinavian clay vessels present only partial likenesses with those from English sites, the glass vase,i which were occasionially found were almost identical in type, and seemed to have been exported from a single place of manufacture in the Rhine valley or the North of Gaul, and it was probable that the garnets which were</page><page sequence="4">Anthropological fiscellanea and .New Books. 191 commonly used in the northern jewellery were similarly derived from a common source in the C-arpathians. Summing up his results, Professor Hildebrand concluded that a common Teutonic taste was the source of the art styles both of Scandinavia and of Saxon England; that the Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon races were of closely-allied Teutonic descent, but that in the incessant movements characteristic of that stock the two branches were separated from one another, and developed independently; that the Kentish Jutes and the Saxons of England came not from Scandinavia, but from Germany; but that the case was not clear with regard to the Angles, who might possibly not be of German origin, but may have been settled at one time in the south-west corner of Scandinavia. The object of the paper by Mr. J. Romilly Allen, " On the Origin and Development of Early Christian Art in Great Britain and Ireland," was to trace the various decorative elements founid in early Christian art in Great Britain to their source, and to show in what way the native styles of art existing in this country at the time of the introduction of Christianity (circa A.D. 450) were influenced, first by the Italo-Byzantine art which came in with the importation of the illuminated MSS. used in the service of the Church, and subsequently by the coming in contact of the Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian conquering races with the Celtic and other populations already inhabiting the British Isles. Early Christian art in this country is essentially decorative, and to a lesser extent symbolic. The conventional grouping and general treatment of the figure-subjects show that they are obviously bar- barous copies of Byzantine originals. If any definite conclusions are to be arrived at with regard to the evolution of early Christian art in Great Britain, it must be by a careful examination and com- parison of the minute details of the ornament. The ornament consists of the following elements (1) Interlaced work (2) Key patterns G (3) Step patterns trical. (4) Spirals (5) Zoomorphic designs 1 Suggested by animal, (6) Anthropomorphic designs human, and vege- (7) Phyllomorphic designs J table forms. The possible sources whence each of these different patterns was derived are next to be considered. These are divided into the native or imported styles of decorative art existing in Great Britaiin previous to the introduction of Christianity-namely, the art of the ages of stone, bronze, and iron, and Romano-British art; and the external sources, made accessible after A.D. 450-namely, the Italo-Byzantine, Anglo-Saxon, and Scandinavian styles. The spirals are to be traced to a " late Celtic " source in the late iron age, the interlaced work and phyllomorphic designs to an Italo- Byzantine source, the step patterns possibly to a Saxon source, the</page><page sequence="5">192 Anthropological Miscellanea and New Books. zoomorphic designs perhaps to a Scandinavian source, and the key patterns to the classical fret adapted to suit the diagonal setting- out lines ussually employed in drawing early Christian ornament in Great Britain. In the first part, of his paper on "Ancient MetaZ Implements from Jigypt and Lachish," Dr. Gladstone traced the gradual transition from the flint to the bronze age. He then described the composi- tion of a number of implements found in Egypt, during the ex- cavations conducted by Prof. Flinders Petrie, and at Ijachish, an ancient Ammonite town in Syria. Some of these implements were of almost pure copper, but others were much harder and more like bronze. The question was, from whence did the ancient Egyptians get their tin? Their knowledge of its existence was pretty well established by Prof. Petrie's discovery of a ring dlating back to the 18th dynasty, or 1400 B.C., undoubtedly composed of this metal. At Lachish there was a very high mound consisting of the ruins of successive towns. The date of the earliest (probably an Ammonite town) couild not be determined, but after a series of similar towns they came to an Israelite town, and we know that the Ammonites were displaced by the Israelites, and that, in the time of Hezekiah, the Lachish of that day endured a long series of sieges by Sennacherib, and was probably destroyed by him. Right from the bottom to the top of this mound were found implements, those in the lower strata were of copper, or of copper mixed with a copper sub-oxide, while higher up in the moun4d were a number of bronze articles, especiallv arrow-heads. Not only was there a gradual cthange from copper to bronze, but the bronze itself gradually disappeared as the remains of the Israelite town were approached, and iron implements were found. Dr. Gladstone thought that the copper implements were hardened by allowing the oxide to be formed. In his communication " On the Structure of Lake Dwellings," Dr. Munro described the various methods adopted by the lake- dwellers in the construction of the under-structures and platforms on which their huts had been placed:- (1) Pfahlbauten, or pile-structures proper. (2) Solid basements of wood, or islands made of mixed materials, crannogs, fascine structures, &amp;c. (3) Cellular basements of beams arranged like a log-house. After noticing the fragmentary indications of huts collected from time to time on the sites of lake-dwellings, the author went on to describe the ruins of a cottage exposed a few years ago by peat- cutters at the Schussenried, Wiirtemberg. It was of a rectangular shape, measuring 33 feet long by 23 feet broad, and its walls were constructed of wooden beams plastered over with clay. Its interior was divided into two compartments, one of which contained a hearth. Dr. Munro then gave a description of an</page><page sequence="6">Anlh4opological Miscellamea and New Books. 193 equally important discovery recently made in Argyllshire. This was a crannog showing foundations of a circular house 32 feet in diameter, and also divided into two compartments, one of which contained a hearth and the remains of a doorwvay. Mr. Arthur Bulleid described " A British Village of Lake Dwell- ings " discovered by him in March, 1892. It is situated a little more than a mile north of the town of Glastonbury, in the iupper part of one of the moorland levels of Central Somerset found to the south of the Mendip Hills. The site is fourteen miles from the coast of the Bristol Channel, but only about 15 feet above high-water level. As late as 1540 the neighbouring lands were occupied either by areas of water or swamp, one mere being five miles round. The village is bounded on its east side by a natural watercourse. There is little on the surface to indicate the site of a village, but on careful inspection between sixty and seventy low circular mounds may be seen, varying from 15 to 35 feet in diameter, and from 6 inches to 2 feet 6 inches high at the centre. These form the foundations or floors of separate dwellings, which are con- structed in the following way:-On the surface of the peat is a layer or platform of timber and brushwood kept in place by numerous small piles at the margin. On this a layer of clay is placed, slightly raised at the centre, where the remains of a hearth are generally found. The dwelling itself was composed of timber filled in with wattle and daub. Not only have the wall-posts been found in situ, but also the entrance threshold anid doorstep. The extent of the ground covered by the sixty or seventy mounds measures more than 400 feet north and south, by 300 feet east and west. The east border of the settlement has been met with, and is well defined by a thick line of piles and timber. This side of the village was undoubtedly, to begin with, protected by water, which in course of time was replaced by an accumulation of a peaty nature. It is in and on this formation outside the settlement that many interesting structures entering into the construction of the village have been unearthed, such as banks of clay and stone, morticed timber aud hurdlework. Among other things that have been discovered is a boat 17 feet long, quantities of wheel and hand-made pottery, sling stones, anid bones of animals, and a great nnmber of objects of bronze and iron, horn, bone and stone, such as fibulea and rings, knives, saws and weapons, combs, needles, pottery stamps, and querns. Only one pot had as yet been dug- up whole, but it had been found possible to reconstruct several others from the fragments that had been discovered. From one mound alone portions of as many as ten distinct pots had been recovered. The wheel-made pottery was frequently decorated with circles, curved and flowing lines, and also with straight lines and cross hatching, the designs being in many cases beautiful and elaborate. There were distinct signs that this pottery was made by the inhabitants of the settle- ment, for pieces of horn had been dug up with cup-shaped VOL.

Up to the present time nothing in the shape of a coin had been found, nor had one single fragment of Samian or Roman pottery been met with. Whatever might be the ultimate conclusion arrived at as to the probable date of the village, and who the occupants of these dwel- lings might have been, they had already gained some considerable amount of knowledge of the life they lived, the discoveries proving them to have been skilful workers in metals and carpentry, and also manufactures of pottery. They also knew that they were basket makers, and acquaiinted with the lathe. It was obvious also from the wheat and beans, the bones of sheep and cattle, that they had tilled and farmed the adjoining highlands, and that they used the horse and dog, and lastly they were makers of fabrics, the texture of which, in some cases, they could not do otherwise than assume was in harmony with the fine anid delicate fibule used for fastening them. In his paper on " Pin-wells and Rag-bushes," Mr. E. Sidney Hartland suggested that the object of throwing pins into the water, or tying rags upon trees, was to effect union with the divinity by the perpetual contact with the god of some article identified with the worshipper. Mr. Hartland did not question the accuracy of Professor Rhys' explanation that, in certain cases, the pins were looked upon as offerings and the rags as vehicles for 'the transfer of disease; but he contended that the original intention was different, and that these ideas only arose after the real motive was forgotten. In a paper " On Anthropometric Work in Large Schools," by Professor Windle, the author gave the results obtained in answer to a circular sent to the head masters of one hundred of the largest schools in England, Scotland, and Ireland, inquiring whether any, and if so what, anthropometric investi- gations were carried on in their institutions, anid the methods adopted in taking the various measurements. The replies show that some form of measurement is, or has been, carried on in twenty-five schools (Table I); but they also show that the methods adopted differ considerably (Table II), a fact which greatly detracts from the value of the observations for compara- tive purposes. The advantages of systematic measurements of boys from the scholastic and the scientific points of view were alluded to, and it was suggested that an endeavour should be made to encourage and systematise such work in large schools.

The Canon of the proportions of the body is also given, anid the report enables anyone who has been measured in the laboratory to find his place with respect to the corrected mean of each measurement. The Committee appointed to promote an Ethnographical Survey of the United Kingdom presented their First Report. The Report is purely preliminary, but gives evidence of a vast amount of work having already been done. The Committee propose to record for certain typical villages, parishes, or places, and their vicinity: (1) Physical types of the inhabitants. (2) Current traditions and beliefs. (3) Peculiarities of dialect. (4) Moniuments and other remains of anicienit culture. (5) Historical evidence as to continuity of race. At the end of the Report, Forms of Schedule are giver vlwhiell are supplied to correspondents and upon which they are requested to record their observations. The Committee appointed to consider the questioii of Uniformity in the Spelling Qf Barbaric and Savage Languages aiid Race na,mes, recommend that the system of orthography already adopted bv the Royal Geographical Society, the Admiralty, the Foreigni Office, the Colonial Office, the War Office, and the Governimeiit of the United States of America should be generally used in the titles of papers. Reports were also presented by the Committee appointed to investigate the Physical Characters, Languages, and Industrial and Social Condition of the North-Western Tribes of the Dominion of Canada; the Committee for the Exploration of Ancient Remailns at Aksum in Abyssinia; and the Committee on the Physical IJeviations from the Normal among Children in Elementary and other Schools. New Committees were appointed for " Anthropometric Work in Schools " and for carrying on the operations at Glasto nbury.</page></plain_text>
