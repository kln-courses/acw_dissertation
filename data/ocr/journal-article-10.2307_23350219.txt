<plain_text><page sequence="1">OBITUARY ROGER GOEPPER (1925-2011) In 2005, Roger Goepper's colleagues, friends, and students celebrated his eightieth birthday by presenting him with a Festschrift entitled Long Life.1 Meishou, the Chinese ren dition of the title on the front cover, alludes to his posses sion of the "Eyebrows of Longevity." He did indeed enjoy a long life, but his final years were overshadowed by a fatal ill ness that slowly drowned the light of his brilliant mind in sullen darkness. He closed his eyes forever on 18 December 2011. " Eyebrows of Longevity "is also a fine metaphor for the enduring quality of his lifelong dialogue with science and art. Through his uncompromising scholarship, intellectual originality, artistic acumen, generosity, and human sensi tivity, he gained unprecedented recognition for our field, both in Germany and abroad. Diversity and abundance characterize his life's work. Not only did he share his appre ciation of East Asian art with his students, collectors, and the public at large, but his exhibitions and research projects consistently broke new ground, encompassing fields as diverse as ancient China and Korea, classical East Asian cal ligraphy and painting, and the art of Esoteric Buddhism in Japan and Tibet. Roger Goepp'er served as Director of the Museums ofEast Asian Art in Berlin (1959-66) and Cologne (1966—89) and taught as Professor ofEast Asian Art at the University of Cologne from 1966 to 2002. The Beginnings It is fitting to Roger Goepper's character that he was born on 9 March 1925, the last year of the era of "Great Right eousness" (Taishö). Growing up in his native Pforzheim, he matured into an artistically gifted, classically educated per son, feeling equally at ease with both words and images. At first his interests were directed especially toward drawing, pottery, and the theater arts. While still in high school, he authored a classicizing play entitled Pbaethon, in which he performed as the son of the Greek god Helios. After his return from war service (1943—45) he lived, like so many, by working odd jobs. He eventually found employment as a gardener and librarian for the Countess of Toerring-Jetten bach at Lake Pilsen in Bavaria. This position gave him suffi cient time not only to earn a side income as a painter of Rheinisches Bildarchiv Köln alpine scenery, but also to apprentice as a potter. To his great despair, his master died unexpectedly. Perhaps it was this stroke of fate that rescued the ambitious craftsman for aca demia, for soon thereafter, in 1951, he enrolled at the Uni versity of Munich where he studied Art History, Sinology, and Japanology, as well as Sanskrit and Tibetan. The Ori ent had intrigued him even before the war, and he began compiling his first Sanskrit vocabulary booklet while still a schoolboy, inspired in part by the travel and adventure nov els of Karl May. In Munich, his professors included Hans Sedlmayr (1896-1984), Max Loehr (1903—1988), Walter Fuchs (1902-1979), Herbert Franke (1914—2011), and Horst I Jeong-hee Lee-Kalisch, Antje Papist-Matsuo, and Willibald Veit, eds., Long Life, Meishou.

Almost overnight, so to speak — while working as a night guard in the State Museum of Ethnology in Munich - he was introduced to the Asian art collection ofEmil Preetorius (1883-1973), the famous stage designer and book illustrator. He became deeply immersed in the collection, first as a research fellow (1952-56) and sub sequently as its curator (1957-59).2 In the early 1950s he was also one of several research assistants - among them James Cahill — who collaborated with Osvald Sirén on the seven volume publication Chinese Painting: Leading Masters and Principles (1956-58). Chinese Painting Inspired by the works in the Preetorius collection, Goepper was initially drawn to the study of Chinese painting. Right away he embraced context-seeking art-historical methods (such as Sedlmayr's structure analysis) and ventured to com bine these with a careful reading of traditional Chinese painting theory and other literary sources on China's cul tural history. A talented draftsman and painter in his own right, Goepper sought to understand Chinese paintings as if from the inside, exploring their "essence" by analyzing underlying "design forces" and "artistic means" (bildnerische Kräfte und Mittel), as he called them. Identifying technical nuances of the artists' brushwork and compositional prin ciples was as relevant to him as interpreting a painting's subject matter within the context of its cultural climate. The earliest fruits of his studies matured in the form of his dissertation of 1956, T'ang-tai, ein Hofmaler der Ch'ing-Zeit (Tangdai: A Court Painter of the Qing Era).3 Based on Tangdai's (1673-after 1752) treatise on painting, Huishi fawei, written in 1716, he produced a wide-ranging mono graph on the life and work of this Manchu court artist. An extensive appendix of annotated technical terms on Chinese aesthetics and painting theory, with Chinese characters in 2 Roger Goepper, "Die Sammlung Preetorius," in Kunst des Ostens: Sammlung Preetorius, ed.

Studien zur ostasiatischen Schriftkunst 2 (Wiesbaden: F. Steiner Verlag, 1974). the author's own hand, provided a new working basis for specialists and students. Years later he remained intent on finding the most accurate translations and definitions of fundamental Chinese terminology. He made clear, for instance, that the term feibai should not be translated as "flying white, " but as " over-flown white " (iiberflogenes Weiss), because, after all, it was not the white that was flying over the paper, but the inked brush with its spread bristles. In Qin Zuyong's (1825-1884) brief treatise Tongyin huajue, Goepper discovered "a summation of all Chinese thinking on pictorial art, and landscape painting in partic ular. " He translated this text into German and published it in 1959 under the title Im Schatten des Wu-t'ung-Baumes (In the Shade of the Wutong Tree).4 The same year, he was entrusted with the production of the scholarly catalogue for the loan exhibition 1000Jahre chinesische Malerei (1,000 Years of Chinese Painting), which presented a large selection of first-rate paintings from American and European collec tions.' The works were on view in Munich, The Hague, and Zurich and gave him the opportunity to discuss what were then much debated issues of authenticity and attribution with a great number of specialists. Inspired by this discourse in front of the originals, Goepper summarized his views and insights in 1962 in his ground-breaking book Vom Wesen chi nesischer Malerei/The Essence of Chinese Painting,6 It remains one of the most eminent contributions to Chinese painting scholarship in a Western language. Calligraphy Roger Goepper was among the pioneering western scholars who tackled the difficult field of Chinese and Japanese cal ligraphy. In his first, "exemplary attempt" he focused on a key work of the early Tang period, Sun Guoting's Shupu (Treatise on Writing), written in 687.7 Because this text survives in Sun's original manuscript in the National Palace Museum in Taipei, it offered the unique possibility to eval uate Sun's theories firsthand, by examining them through his own handwriting. Goepper cogently embedded his translation of the treatise and his detailed formal analysis of Sun's scroll within a wider discussion of the history, appre ciation, theory, and practice of Chinese calligraphy. The massive oeuvre, comprising 512 pages and 66 illustrations, was completed in 1971 and was accepted as a habilitation (post-doctoral) thesis by the University of Cologne the fol lowing year. In 1975, the government of Japan sent its first calligra phy exhibition abroad. Sho: Pinselschrift und Malerei in Japan vom 7.-19. Jahrhundert (Sho: Brush Writing and Painting in Japan, 7th-i9th Century) was daunting and at the same 336</page><page sequence="3">time an extraordinary expression of trust in Goepper. Not even in Japan had anyone ever attempted such an ambitious and wide-ranging calligraphy show. All of the loans came from Buddhist monasteries, museums, and eminent private collections in Japan and numerous registered art treasures were included. It was therefore only appropriate that the exhibition was first presented to the Japanese public at the Tokyo National Museum before traveling to its only other venue, the Kunsthalle in Cologne, for which it was origi nally conceived. The detailed catalogue, which Goepper co authored with Hiroko Yoshikawa, gives translations of almost all of the n6 artworks, and offers a representative overview of a field that has remained difficult for Western viewers to access.8 In the great exhibition Kunstschätze aus Japan (Art Treasures from Japan), shown in Cologne and Zurich in 1969 and 1970, Goepper had earlier introduced a small number of calligraphies.9 He was convinced that "a deeper Western understanding of East Asian culture... must not capitulate in front of this writing barrier." Buddhist Art When studying Buddhist art Roger Goepper knew no geo graphic boundaries. His interests ranged from India, Ladakh, Thailand, and Cambodia, to Tibet, China, Korea, and Japan. For many years he worked on an annotated trans lation of the Hizöki (The Transmission of the Secret Treas ure), a foundational text of Esoteric Buddhism. The trans lation has been completed but not yet published. Goepper offered his readers a first taste of it in the 1995 Festschrift for his friend Wolfgang Bauer (1930-1997).10 The Hizöki is tra ditionally considered to be a work by the Shingon founder Kükai (774-835), who is said to have recorded here the oral instructions of his Chinese master, Huiguo (746-80 5 ). Kü kai had been a starting point multiple times for Goepper's studies." Goepper never considered Buddhist paintings and sculptures as isolated works of art, but always explained them as mediators of religious messages and components of living rituals. Many of his essays bear impressive testimony to his sensitive and respectful penetration of Buddhist spir ituality.12 Among his many enlightening studies, his mono graph Aizen-myöö: The Esoteric King of Lust holds pride of place for setting new standards in Western scholarship on Japanese Buddhist art.13 With great wisdom and painstak ing attention to detail, Goepper made this fierce, seemingly untouchable protector and savior deity accessible to special ists in all its many forms and historical incarnations. His profound knowledge of Esoteric Buddhism proved to be of great value when he undertook several seasons of fieldwork i n Ladakh between 1982 and 1989 in order to study the temples of Alchi, especially their colorful and well-pre served monumental sculptures and brilliant murals. The Buddhist iconographie programs of Kashmir are detailed and highly differentiated. The ceiling paintings, Goepper found, were adaptations of contemporary textiles. In the Sumtsek temple, he discovered inscriptions that identified a monk by the name of Tshulthim Ö (thsul-khrims 'od) as the man who commissioned the "pile of jewels" (rin-chen brt segs-pa), i.e. the Alchi temple group and its paintings, which could now be dated to between 1200 and 1220. Goepper, who was accompanied on his Ladakh trips by photographer Jaroslav Poncar, presented the results of this research in 1996 in a luxury edition from Serindia Publications London: Alchi: Ladakh's Hidden Buddhist Sanctuary - The Sumtsek. Exhibitions When organizing his many internationally acclaimed exhi bitions, Roger Goepper always strove for fruitful collabora tion with other institutions, colleagues, and students. His often daring projects required careful didactic treatment and ranged from presentations of new archaeological dis coveries in China to Die Mandatas der Zwei Welten: Medi tationsbilder des 9.

Kunstschätze aus Korea /Treasures from Korea, shown in 1984 and 1985 in Cologne, Hamburg, and London, united no fewer than 265 works characteristic of Korean art production of the previous five thousand years. It included artworks in all the major media, among them numerous registered national treasures and recently excavated cultural relics. Goepper produced the thorough catalogue with Ji Hyun Whang and Roderick Whitfield.15 In 1999 and 2000 he and Jeong-hee Lee-Kalisch presented a similarly ambi tious and splendid follow-up exhibition, Korea: Die Alten Königreiche (Korea: The Old Kingdoms), which traveled from Essen to Munich and Zurich.16 The pioneering loan exhibition Kunstschätze aus China (Art Treasures from China) displayed ninety-seven recent archaeological discoveries from the Neolithic to the Tang era.17 This show was one of the first to examine Chinese antiquities in light of their archaeological context and the first in Europe to present terracotta soldiers discovered at the tomb of the First Emperor as well as Tang Buddhist sculptures that had once belonged to the Anguo Temple in Chang'an. I had the pleasure of co-organizing this exhibi tion with Roger. The rapid development of archaeology in the People's Republic of China allowed for a second travel ing exhibition with new masterpieces fifteen years later, touring Europe under the title Das Alte China: Menschen und 14 Roger Goepper and Ursula Lienert, Die Mandatas ckr Zwei Welten: Meditationsbilder des 9.

Götter im Reich der Mitte (Ancient China: People and Gods in the Middle Kingdom).18 Goepper did everything in his power to include treasures from the tomb of the royal con sort Fu Hao (13th c. BCE ) and bronzes from the Sanxingdui site in Sichuan (13th—10th c. BCE), especially the singular, life-size statue of a man, the bizarre human heads, and the large masks. The exhibit caused excitement among the gen eral public as well as specialists because Goepper selected the works with a focus on the human image. The venues were Essen, Munich, Zurich, Copenhagen, and finally, Lon don, where Jessica Rawson re-conceptualized Goepper's show and redacted his catalogue (which he had done in col laboration with Jeong-hee Lee-Kalisch and Peter Wiede hage) under the title Mysteries of Ancient China: New Dis coveries from the Early Dynasties (1996). The exhibit Shingon: Die Kunst des Geheimen Buddhismus in Japan (Shingon: The Art of Esoteric Buddhism in Japan) was produced in 1988 exclusively for Cologne. Although the show presented exquisite paintings, sculptures, and medieval ritual paraphernalia, Goepper himself admitted in the pref ace to his catalogue that this exhibition would "surely be difficult for the uninitiated visitor. " Goepper's profound learning made initiation possible. His erudite catalogue continues to be an essential handbook on the art and iconog raphy of esoteric Buddhism.1' In 2006 the last exhibition project he was engaged in came to fruition, Tibet: Klöster öff nen ihre Schatzkammern (Tibet: Monasteries Open Their Treasuries).20 None of these many extraordinary exhibition projects would have been conceived and presented to the German public had it not been for Goepper's personal con tacts and the respect he enjoyed among his colleagues in Europe, East Asia, and America. Museum Director As museum director, Roger Goepper reliably offered a cor dial welcome to his guests, generously hosted them (usu ally out of his own pocket), and willingly opened his exhi bition halls and storage rooms. At the museums for East Asian art in Berlin and Cologne he took the decisive initia tives leading to the construction of the present buildings, which had become necessary after the war. It is also due to his wise refurbishing and expansion of the collections and to his innovative exhibitions that the two museums regained world renown. When he arrived in Berlin in 1959, he found the museum totally destroyed and the collection reduced to fewer than three hundred objects. He coordinated the plan ning of the new museum in Dahlem, but oversight of the final phases of construction was left to his successor, Bea trix von Ragué (1921-2006), when he relocated to Cologne 338</page><page sequence="5">in 1966. There, he immersed himself in the construction of the new museum designed by the great modernist architect Maekawa Kunio (1905-1986). The old building had been destroyed in one of the last air raids in 1944; fortunately, most of the collection had been sheltered elsewhere. On 2 December 1977, Goepper was finally able to celebrate the opening of one of the most sterling museum buildings in postwar Germany. Always the prudent director, he expanded the museum collections with purpose and an unfailing sense for artistic quality. He not only knew how to enthuse and advise patrons and collectors - among them Hans-Jürgen von Lochow (1902-1989) and Hans Wilhelm Siegel (1903-1997) - but he also motivated them to tie their interests into the museum's activities in the broadest sense.11 Among Goep per's exceptional acquisitions are the Chinese bronze axe (yue) with stylized anthropomorphic design from the twelfth or eleventh century BCE obtained for Berlin,22 and a simi lar ceremonial axe of the Shang era,1' which was donated to the Cologne museum along with other ancient ritual bronzes from the von Lochow and Siegel collections.24 Goepper's friendship with Siegel also resulted in the creation of the Orientstiftung zur Förderung der Ostasiatischen Kunst (Orient Foundation for the Advancement of East Asian Art), hosted by the museum in Cologne. It was with the help of this foundation that the museum could acquire one of its most valuable treasures, a rare Tang-era silver bowl (late 7th—early 8th century), adding a new highlight to the collection.25 It was also Goepper's great good fortune to make a chance discovery that most curators can only dream of. In May 1983, when he and conservator Barbara Piert-Borgers examined a wooden statue that had been safeguarded by the museum for over seven decades, they discovered what they called "Jizö's soul. " The hollow bodhisattva figure had been crammed full with devotional gifts. These included sacred texts, votive prints, a handwritten dedicatory document, two small gilt-bronze Buddha statues with traces of human blood — likely remnants from the consecration ceremony — a tiny colorful wooden figure of Jizö Bosatsu, and a tightly closed bag of silk brocade that remains unopened, for it pre sumably contains a holy relic. This restraint of scientific curiosity bears testimony to Goepper's sensitivity and respect for the sacred when dealing with religious art. His study of the dedicatory manuscript, meanwhile, revealed the impor tance of this hitherto little-noticed icon. It turned out to be the earliest dated work by the sculptor Köen (1207-after 1275), who carved it in 1249 at the age of forty-two as a copy of an older image that had been dedicated around the year iooo on Mount Hi'ei. Goepper summed up his epochal dis covery modestly: "If we consider all the data and facts that result from an analysis of the 'soul' of our bodhisattva, we gain a rather concrete image of the intellectual and religious climate that led to the making of a Buddhist figure in Japan's imperial capital of the thirteenth century. And what seemed like a strange, impersonal icon now suddenly obtains a very human context which, after all, also carried Köen dur ing the creation of his sculpture."3-6 Honors In recognition of his outstanding academic achievements, the Academy of Sciences of Nordrhein-Westfalen in Düs seldorf made him a regular member in 1979. In 1985 he received the Order of Cultural Merits, Bo-Gwan, from the government of the Republic of Korea and, in 1991, both the Order of Merit of the State of Nordrhein-Westfalen and the Order of the Sacred Treasure, Zuihöshö, from the govern ment of Japan. In 1997 he was awarded the Order of Merit (First Class) of the Federal Republic of Germany and the renowned Japan Foundation Award. Despite such high national and international honors, Roger Goepper always remained a modest man who lacked even the slightest streak of vanity. Due to his character, his knowledge, and his work this extraordinary scholar will be remembered with grati tude and respect far beyond the boundaries of the field.
