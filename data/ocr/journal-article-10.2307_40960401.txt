<plain_text><page sequence="1">10 The Cult Centre at Mycenae1 and the duality of life and death Lyvia Morgan Shaft Grave Circle A at Mycenae, with its rich burials of the 1 6th century BC filled with gold and images of the masculine pursuits of warfare and the hunt, lay outside the original citadel wall when it was built in the mid 14th century (c. 1340, LH IIIA2). A century later (c. 1250, LH IIIB) those walls were extended, curving around to neatly enclose the circular area of the Shaft Graves (FIG. 10. i).2 This careful en- closure of one of the most important burial sites (Circle B lying further from the palace) suggests a degree of reverence for their most esteemed, probably royal, an- cestors. It effectively included them permanently in the current environment of the ruling class. Simultaneously, a new, grand gateway to the citadel was built - the Lion Gate - apparently unrelated to the orientation of the previous entrance and permitting (at that time) immediate sight of the Shaft Grave Circle upon entry.3 Guarding this gateway were leonine beasts carved in permanent stone, and recalling the lion im- agery so prevalent in the Shaft Graves themselves. Leading from this gateway in a south-easterly direction, a Great Ramp was built, passing directly by the Shaft Grave Circle before giving access by turning north- wards to the palace. Parallel to this, the Little Ramp led southwards to a terrace, while the Causeway led south from the Ramp House into a corridor which led up the Processional Way towards the palace, and down to the area now known as the Cult Centre, itself the focus of building activity either at the same time or immediately afterwards. During all these major changes to the walls and en- trance to the citadel, careful attention was paid to the area of the Shaft Grave Circle itself.4 The surface was raised in order to make it level with the entrance slope. A new retaining wall was built on the west side and fill brought in for this purpose. A new circular parapet was erected on top of the retaining wall and on the bedrock of the east side of the Grave Circle, with two concen- tric rings of sandstone slabs, more or less on the old line of the peribolos, extending it right round. The entrance to the Grave Circle on the north side now faced the new Lion Gate. Inside the Circle, earth fill was heaped over the graves (fragments of LH IIIB pottery being found within it). Over Grave IV, a circular well-like structure, which had functioned as a pit for libations, was covered with fill. Tsountas and, later, Mylonas suggested it had been used in funerary rites; Ingrid Strom, however, suggested that its purpose was 'a sacrificial closing of the cult of the dead' in LH IIIB.5 A small cave-like hollow between Graves IV and I contained a scatter of sherds and human figurines (the latest being LH IIIB, including a psi-type figurine which fell into Grave I). Some of the grave stelae were re-erected, facing west. Around the same time, extensive building took place to the south of the Grave Circle and adjacent to the new citadel wall. This is the area now known as the Cult Centre of Mycenae (FIG. 10.2).

At least two build- ings are known to have been present during the use of this cemetery: one below the later Ramp House, and one higher up the slope to the south (beyond Tsountas' House). The latter - a storeroom - dates to the end of the MH period. The Ramp House lies immediately adjacent to the south-east edge of Shaft Grave Circle A, and next to the LH IIIB Little Ramp.

Elizabeth French and Ken Wardle are of the opinion that the lower two shrines were built just prior to the construction of the new fortification wall. There can, however, have been no great time between the two constructions, regardless of which was built first. If the buildings preceded the walls, then clearly originally the main access to the lower shrines would have been from the west, presumably north-west, along the side of the Shaft Grave Circle.</page><page sequence="3">CULT CENTRE AT MYCENAE AND THE DUALITY OF LIFE AND DEATH 161 s i 1 I "I 0 5 J CO d</page><page sequence="4">1 62 LYVIA MORGAN and the 'Bull Sports' paintings were found (PLATES 40.3, 41. 3X7 including a miniature fragment of a man with arm raised before an object, who, if he is before an altar rather than a bull, may be involved in a rite connected with the bull sports. These are thought to date to LH II/IIIA. Also found in the area were frag- ments of life-size women, probably from a procession. It appears, therefore, that there was already a painted building in the earlier part of the Late Helladic period directly adjacent to the Shaft Grave Circle and overlying part of the Prehistoric Cemetery.8 It is hard to imagine that such a building in such a setting could have been anything but a shrine. (It is also interesting to note that on one of the Tanagra larnakes, bull-leaping is associated with funerary rites).9 We must, therefore, imagine an area with relatively little in the way of buildings - with the notable excep- tion of the earlier Ramp House shrine - adjacent to the Shaft Grave Circle when the new citadel wall was built. What was associated with this, was a period of intense building activity, directly over the Prehistoric Cemetery but carefully protecting the royal Shaft Grave Circle, resulting in a complex of cult buildings sand- wiched between two houses - the South House and Tsountas' House - the latter, at least, presumably having been used by the priestly personnel.10 A processional way was formed between the Cult Centre and the palace at the top of the acropolis. The beginning of the ascent was roofed, with steps leading up and the walls plastered and painted. A chariot scene was found partially in situ on the south-east wall.11 The horses, chariot and two men echo the palatial scenes of the entrance to the palace (the Western Portal) and the palace Megaron, both of which were painted with men, horses and chariots, accompanied in the Megaron, only, by an actual battle scene. Such images seem to be entirely palatial in character and the repetition of such a scene (without the battle) at the juncture of the lower, cult area with the rise to the upper palace seems appropriate. The approach to the Processional Way is from a Causeway, which forked east into the Processional Way leading to the palace, and west into a walkway through to the upper shrine area along the eastern wall of the Megaron, which ended in a small forecourt in front of the shrine to the east of Tsountas' House. It was in the southern room of this shrine that the so-called 'Palladion' plaster plaque (recently discussed by Hooker (1996)) was discovered. The northern room faces onto the open forecourt. Near the southern end of this room was a horse-shoe hearth next to the wooden threshold of the door connecting the two rooms (not shown on the plan). The hearth had a projection with a hollow, probably for libations. A stone block in front of the hearth served as a sacrificial table. According to the recent publication on the Temple (Moore and Taylour 1999), there were two routes of access from this upper area to the lower Cult Area. One was via five steps leading down to a corridor running westwards between the Megaron and Room IV (the southern attachment to the Megaron on older plans). This corridor had a plaster floor so was probably cov- ered and may have contained the Procession Fresco whose fragments were found in the fill just to the west. The other route was via a plastered ramp leading from the south-west corner of the forecourt of Tsountas' Shrine down between Tsountas' House and Room IV. Both routes would give access to the other two shrines: the eastern Shrine of the Idols (known as the Temple) and the western Shrine of the Fresco (known as the Room of the Fresco). Access to the lower shrines was also possible from the courtyard itself which in turn was probably accessible via passages along the inside of the citadel wall. It is these two lower shrines, particularly the latter, which form the focus of this article (FIG. 10.3). What is important to remember here, is that there was access in mid-LH IIIB (c. 1250), when these two lower shrines were in use, with the upper shrine, known as 'Tsountas' Shrine', and hence ultimately with the Causeway and the Processional Way. Access down via the ramp from the forecourt of Tsountas' Shrine was later blocked by a retaining wall in the latter part of LH IIIB, when the floor of the shrine had been filled in with earth, covering the hearth and sacrificial table, which were replaced by an altar-like structure against the door-post of the entrance.12 All this is likely to have been associated with changes to the lower shrines. The initial building of the Shrine of the Fresco, con- structed in LH IIIB 1 , consisted of the main shrine (east) and a subsidiary room (west). There were two door- ways to the main shrine room, one from an anteroom on the north-west corner of the room and one on the east wall. Initially, the east door would have permitted communication with the Shrine of the Idols (Temple) which was built at the same time. The position of the wall painting next to the doorway on this east wall in- dicates that there was a door at the time the painting was made. The painting would have been seen upon entry from the north-west, but is clearly closely associ- ated with the doorway to the east.

The South House appears to have been built in mature LH IIIB 1 and may originally have been a free-standing, external structure (Taylour 1981, 9). 11 Kritseli-Providi 1982, 90-1 (Delta-i), pl. 27. 12 Praktika (1972) 122; Taylour 1981, 15; Iakovides 1983, 45/47.</page><page sequence="5">CULT CENTRE ATM YCENAE AND THE DUALITY OF LIFE AND DEA TH 1 63 ' *x v* ' ' •• j^p!

Its ico- nography is, I believe, closely associated with its position by the doorway which initially led to the Shrine of the Idols. After the construction of this eastern compart- ment, the wall painting was plastered over. This suggests that the Shrine of the Ivories took over from the paint- ing as the focal emphasis of the shrine. The Shrine complex went out of use in mid-LH IIIB. At the same time, statues in the Shrine of the Idols were haphaz- ardly stored in the small upper room (19), which was then closed, though the cult continued in the room with the platforms (18). Both shrines were covered by de- bris from fire destruction at the end of LH IIIB. Even before the destruction, there was no longer a need for access between the three shrines and that access, previ- ously a part of the overall design, had become difficult. At the time that access was blocked, there were no more wall paintings in this part of the Cult Centre. Having outlined the chronological and situational history of the area, I shall now concentrate on the mid- 13th century relationships within the complex, focusing on the Shrine of the Fresco and the Shrine of the Idols in an attempt to interpret the meanings of the wall painting within its spatial context. First let me reiterate that there was at this time access between the three shrines. Interestingly, each is positioned differently in relation to the cardinal points. Yet each of the shrines had a central hearth or altar and each had an open air court for outdoor rituals associ- ated with the cult. In the case of the two lower shrines, the open air areas were shared. The court lying between and immediately south of the Shrine of the Idols and 13 Taylour 1981, 9, 17. Elizabeth French believes that the posi- tioning of the fresco next to the door indicates that it was painted in stage two, when the access was changed from west- east to east-west by the addition of the Room of the Ivories. The positioning of the fresco, however, merely proves that there was a doorway at the time the painting was made, not that the small room had already been added.</page><page sequence="6">164 LYVIA MORGAN the Shrine of the Fresco (at its eastern entrance) had a circular altar, which was found with much ash and was surrounded by walls.14 Passing between the two shrines one came to a secluded area, which apparently served as a store or service area associated with this lower shrine complex. The patterning of these shrines - two or more temples, open-air courtyard, located next to the fortification wall - is repeated at Phylakopi and Kition, and in the Lower Citadel at Tiryns a shrine with terracotta figures was surrounded by houses, a court- yard, and also burials, near the fortification wall.15 As we have seen, access to the shrine complex was either from the west, a somewhat difficult route along the line of the fortification wall which curved past the Shaft Grave Circle, past the South House, before reach- ing the entrance lobby of the Shrine of the Fresco,16 or from the east, more directly, leading either along the side of the Megaron, or from the forecourt of the upper shrine with its sacrificial table and hearth, de- scending to the two lower shrines and their associated open-air temenos with altar. That there was access between the upper shrine and the lower two shrines, indicates that worship was not restricted to one or the other areas. However, given the proximity of the upper shrine to the Processional Way and to the entrance to the Megaron of the Cult Centre, it may be that this was associated more closely with palatial cult. Taylour was under the impression that the two lower shrines were different from one another in architec- tural concept and drew the conclusion that the Shrine with the Idols represented a Mycenaean, official cult, and the Shrine with the Fresco a Minoan centre for private worship.17 I would argue, instead, for a close integral relationship between the two, as representing related aspects of the same cult. This cult was, I believe, Mycenaean in character and closely connected with the construction of the fortification wall and its enclosure of the Shaft Grave Circle. The Shrine of the Idols faces north, towards the Grave Circle and the entrance to the citadel. Entrance is from the south through a vestibule. Taylour refers to another entrance in the south-east corner, but further excavation here was not possible owing to previous clearance of this area by Tsountas.18 A second entrance in the south-east could have afforded direct access between this shrine and the Megaron. Steps probably led up to an upper level from the south-west corner, perhaps affording controlled, priestly access to the upper Room of the Idols and the alcove. The main room (FIG. 10.4) had a central platform suggestive of a hearth, though there was no evidence of burning. Along the north and west walls was a unique series of stepped platforms, and in the north-east cor- ner there was a staircase leading up to a tiny room, now known as the Room of the Idols. Flanking the staircase were three columns, evidenced by a stone base and two impressions. In the upper room was found a mass of clay figures and large clay snakes, broken pottery - mainly small bowls, cups and kylikes, suggestive of a drinking ritual - a lamp, two braziers, three tables of offerings, and large numbers of beads and ornaments. In the north-west corner of the room was a natural, unhewn rock, which formed an alcove that had been carefully incorporated into the shrine by building an oblique wall at the back. More figures and snakes were found in this alcove. Altogether, there were some fifteen snakes, many fragmentary. The figures as found had been stored haphazardly when the Room with the Idols was closed in mid LH IIIB. They were often broken, and had been placed facing the wall. Only one was found in situ: next to one of the three columns on the eastern side, on a platform in front of a clay table of offerings.19 Twenty-eight figures were found. Taylour was of the opinion that those with breasts represented females, while those with barrel-shaped bodies and bald heads were male, two being, under those criteria, hermaph- rodite. He identified them as deities. Andrew Moore identifies two 'Type A' figures which he considers may have been cult images, but he has demonstrated that, despite differences, the majority of figures conform to 'Type B' of Elizabeth French's classification, a type which is only known at Mycenae.20 He considers gen- der difference to be of less consequence than pose, identifying three basic poses: (1) both arms raised; (2) one arm raised, one across the chest; (3) both arms across the chest. The latter two types carried some- thing, and judging by the preservation of a shaft ending in what looks like an axe-hammer in the hands of one, a separately modelled axe-hammer found in the main room, and remains of shafts in the hands of two other 14 This altar went out of use shortly after mid-LH IIIB and the area was filled in with earth.

Thus he identifies all the 'Type B' figures as cult officiants, those with raised arms perhaps holding strings of beads as offerings.21 Elizabeth French suggested that the fig- ures may have been a series of dedications, such as might have been left at an annual festival.22 Around the neck and chest and elsewhere on the fig- ures are numerous small holes. According to Moore these were firing holes. Yet not all appear to be haphazardly placed and some may have had a second function. Taylour's idea that they were used for adorn- ment, probably with some of the numerous beads found in a bowl near the figures carries conviction. They might also have been used to attach garments onto the figures. The presentation of jewellery is a ritual act known from iconography and archaeology in the Aegean (as else- where in the ancient world) as, indeed, is the presentation of sculpted figures. From an earlier date, a woman in the Xeste 3 paintings carries a necklace (PLATE 21.1) presumably destined for the goddess on the upper floor of the mural scheme (PLATE 22.2).23 Closer in date and site, at Mycenae itself, in the area immediately south of the shrines, excavated by Mylonas, the so-called Mykenaia both wears and carries a neck- lace (PLATE 21.2),24 while interestingly, a second (very fragmentary) female figure holds a figurine which is presented to a seated figure (surviving only in footstool and feet).25 Beads from necklaces were a part of the vo- tive offerings found in the Phylakopi sanctuary26 and 21 Moore 19880, 263 ff; 1988^ 221. 22 E.

There is nothing to preclude a large group of figures such as this occupying more than one of these categories. Nor is there anything to preclude votive offerings being in the form of deities, ancestral or supernatural beings. The issue - given that the majority of figures were not found in situ - is complex. The figures have a number of distinctive features. Moore draws attention to the curious hairstyles of some, with apparently shaved heads and hairlocks, pointing out that the much earlier paint- ings from Akrotiri, Thera, use such a convention to indicate youth.29 The analogy (cautiously given, owing to the chronological difference) is taken to indicate the cultic significance of the figures, though, judging by contemporary Egyptian parallels, youth is the main criterion for the style.30 But the most striking, and re- cently least commented on, aspect of these figures is their unusual paint-work. Broad bands of contrasting slip (dark on light) create mask-like faces with what, to the modern eye at least, looks like a menacing stare (PLATE 46.3). A gentler version could be said to adorn the face of the 'Lady of Phylakopi,'31 but there are no near parallels for the ferocity, with a solitary exception of a stray figure said to have been found on Cyprus.32 The figures are striking, unusual, similar only to one another yet not identical. Some have raised arms - a gesture which in Egyptian art is clearly identifiable as adoration,33 but which in Aegean art of Late Bronze III often appears to be associated with divinity.34 Some have arms across the chest or one raised and one across the chest, and these figures appear to have held something with a shaft, possibly an axe-hammer. Some may be representative of youths, given their hairlocks. But all have distinctive face paint, with a demeanour which hardly looks benign. And what, in this discussion of these figures, seems frequently to be overlooked, is that they were found not in isolation but in association with numerous large clay snakes - almost as many as the figures themselves. This shrine is characterised not just by 'idols' (which give it its modern name) but by a par- ticular complex of unusual moveable and immoveable features: the columns, platforms, staircase, upper room, rock alcove, snakes and human figures. Taylour's suggestion was that there was a chthonic aspect to the cult - the snakes presumably thought to be slithering in and out of the crevices of rocks between the under- world and the ritual sphere of the shrine, the figures evoking divinities of the underworld. Similarly, Sarah Morris, comparing the figures with clay statuettes found in funerary contexts in Egypt, the Near East and later Punic West, and considering their context near the Shaft Graves, suggests that they are both votive and funerary, representative either of mourners or of ancestors.35 Clearly the detailed study of the figures by Moore has revealed some of the difficulties in interpreting the figures as divine, yet much recent discussion has lost sight of the larger context of the figures as part of a wider shrine complex. So, too, it may have focused on too narrow a definition of the supernatural world. It is perhaps time to re-examine the issue in relation to the shrine complex as a whole, rather than viewing each shrine and each element of that shrine in isolation. Main access to the Shrine of the Frescoes was via an anteroom with a large stone threshold situated on the western side, near the citadel wall (FIG. 10.3). Unlike the other two shrines, the approach is not linear, megaron-style, but comes from the side of the shrine, entering directly into the centre where the focus of the cult lay. The western room may have been a storeroom. The eastern room had a large central hearth, oval in shape, and traces of post-holes suggesting columns supporting the roof around it with an opening for smoke. The bench-like construction of slabs on the south side is later, like the end Room of the Ivories. It is unclear from the publications whether the undecorated larnax of bath-tub type, with associated jug, kylik, miniature jug, hydria and alabastron, evi- dently for ritual washing, belong to the earlier or later phase of the shrine's use. The focus of the cult in the mid-i3th century lay on the southern half of the east wall. Here, above a curved step was a platform with three raised discs on the upper surface. The platform was plastered and on the side was painted a row of so-called 'beam-ends' topped by horns of consecration, indicating the sanctity of the structure (PLATE 24 b). The platform presumably acted as a permanent offering table, the raised circles, found with traces of ash, having possibly served as miniature hearths.36 On the east wall behind and immediately to the side of the platform was the wall painting. Uniquely, directly to the side (north) of this painting, in the middle of the wall, there was a doorway. The painting clearly stops at the doorway, rather than continuing over the entire wall, taking account of the passage interrupt- ing the space. It was this doorway which originally, before the addition of the Room of the Ivories, provided 26 Renfrew 1985, 317-22. 27 Boulotis 1979; Immerwahr 19900, fig. 33b. 28 Praktika (1974) pl. 10a; Ergon (1974) 15, fig. 10; Immerwahr 1995, fig. 7.5b, p. 116. 29 Moore 19880, 230; 1988^, 224. 30 Janssen 1990, 37-41; W.

The painting is on two levels, intersected over half of the lower level by the projecting platform (FIG. 10.5). On the left (northern) side, little has survived of the upper level, but what remains shows two vertical rows of rosettes flanking an apparently blank area. Below there are three horizontal strips, which might suggest steps. Underneath this is a scene of a female figure with a column behind her, facing towards the right and therefore towards the horns of consecration and 'beam- ends' painted on the platform (PLATE 24 b). Only her upper part and one foot with fringed hem survive. She wears a garment which is knotted over one shoulder over another garment with short sleeves. On her head is a hat with a plume. Both the knotted, fringed garment and the plumed hat suggest that she is a priestess. She has - like many of the terracotta figures - raised arms, and in each hand she holds sheaths of grain. The gesture, as previously discussed, can be either votive or divine, but as here it is directed towards the sacred III 111 II 1 ' 1 1 '~^ 1 Fig. 10.5. Reconstructed drawing of the paintings.

Unfortu- nately the rest of this animal is missing, save for two clawed paws towards the lower right of the picture. It has been plausibly drawn in Nanno Marinatos's reconstruction (FIG. 10.5) as a griffin and by Paul Rehak as a lion.37 This causes ambivalence over the interpre- tation, since the presence of a griffin or even a lion in such a pose would more reasonably suggest a goddess rather than a priestess. Griffins, in Aegean iconography, are associated with the hunt and, through analogy, with warfare.38 They are also protective - those that are fearsome being the best guards. Their role of guardianship is clear from the paintings of the Throne Rooms of Knossos and Pylos, the Xeste 3 painting of the goddess, and from sealstones. Perhaps this figure represents the priestess as goddess impersonator. Presumably actual officiants placed their offerings onto the discs on the platform towards which she faces. The painted figure could then be a permanent reminder of the bringing of offerings - in this case grain - as well as a manifestation of the goddess associated with the griffin. She is life-giving, holding grain. It is interesting to recall that a Linear B tablet mentioning, according to Chadwick's interpreta- tion, 'the Mistress of grains', was found by Taylour fallen from a building to the east of the Cult Centre.39 Another factor in considering whether this figure might actually be a goddess, is the existence of three offering discs on the platform, which correspond in number to the three female figures painted on the walls. In the upper zone of the painting, standing on two rows of painted brick- or stone- work, immediately above the projecting platform, are two female figures flanked by two columns (PLATE 24 a, FIG. 10.5). These col- umns - one on the lower level, two on the upper, three in all just as there are three women - provide an architectural setting for the action. Whatever is happening is thought of as happening somewhere spe- cific. Standing, as they do, over the platform, these figures are presumably recipients of the offerings. The setting is architectural; there are three columns; the action is on two levels; the painting and the plat- form are on the east wall. Next to the painting was a doorway which led, originally, outside, to the Shrine of the Idols. In the Shrine of the Idols there were three actual columns, two actual levels, and the columns and staircase to the upper level ran along the east wall. Nor do the correspondences end there. The main room of both shrines had a central hearth. In the west- ern shrine, a platform for offerings projected below the upper level of the painting with a painted figure with raised arms beside it, a column behind her. In the east- ern shrine a series of platforms ended in a platform next to a column below the upper level with the 'idols', and on this stood a terracotta figure with raised arms before a table of offerings. She faced towards the west, in the direction of the platforms before the alcove with unhewn rock, but also in the direction of the western shrine. In the paintings, straight lines are distinguished from brick or stone in the strip that separates the two levels. Above the lines is (so it seems) a blank area. It is conceivable that this was meant to evoke the upper room with the figures and snakes (the 'Room of the Idols'), the lines being indicative of the stairs. Though not a one-to-one correlation, it is more than one might expect. Columns, levels, platforms, offerings, figures - surely these correspondences are more than coincidence. What then is the significance of these correspondences and what does the action of the painting imply? Let us look more closely at the painting on the upper level (PLATE 24 #, FIG. 10.5). The two ladies face one another. They are on a larger scale than the figure on the lower level and are distinguished from one another by their clothing. One wears a flounced skirt, derived from Minoan sources, but quite at home in procession scenes of the Mycenaeans. The other wears a straight fringed garment, of a type usually associated with priestesses (cf. in particular the Priestess from the West House at Thera). Only their lower halves have survived. The woman on the right, in flounced skirt, holds out a staff (pole or spear?) towards the other woman. The woman on the left holds a gigantic sword, but it is not held out to the other woman, rather kept relatively close to her body, the blade passing in front of her foot, point- ing down towards the platform. The clothing does not permit us to speculate on the divine versus mortal status of these women. Both types can be worn by officiants of cult or by goddesses. They serve here to distinguish the two, but given their balanced position in relation to columns and platform, it is perhaps more likely that both figures belong to the divine sphere.40 Between the two women, facing to the left, are two tiny figures hovering in mid-space. One (above) is painted red, the other (below) is painted black. They have no distinguishing features, appear to be naked and are probably male. They stretch out their arms, 37 Marinatos 1988, fig. 2; Rehak 1992, pl. XVIII a. In one of Diana Wardle's reconstruction drawings the animal is of inde- terminate species (Cunliffe 1994, 236; Wardle 1997, in, fig. 34), in another it is a griffin (Tzedakis and Martlew 1999, 193). 38 Morgan 1988, 49-54; chap. 4 in Marinatos and Morgan forthcoming. 39 Chadwick 1962, 58; Ventris and Chadwick 1973, 506-7 and van Leuven 1979, 1 16-18 regarding a connection between the title and the wall painting. 40 'Jt.

The addition of a new fragment in the reconstruction drawing in FIG. 10.5 shows the upper figure to be almost reaching the hilt, the other reaches to the blade. What is the significance of the sword? Who are the tiny figures? Both the scene and the small figures are unique in the Aegean so that in answering the questions speculation is inevitable. However, an answer that fits the contextual pattern of the sanctuary area would seem to have more validity than any other. The small figures could be representations of figurines - but they are unlike any known, are distinct in colour, and most importantly are not held by either woman. They could be votaries before the deity - but they are idiosyn- cratically small, are again distinct in colour, and do not hold their arms in any known votive gesture. In my opinion, the only interpretation which fits the evidence is that also suggested by Nanno Marinatos:41 that these are unique representations of souls. They are tiny in comparison with the women; they are naked; one is red the other black; they stretch their hands towards the sword, as though, perhaps, as warriors their death (or triumph) was by the sword. Though the scene is unique, oblique light may be thrown on the most significant (and idiosyncratic) details from contemporary iconographic sources from the neighbouring Egyptian and Hittite cultures. Though such sources may by some be considered dangerously arcane, in the context of international re- lations so prevalent in the LBA,42 the interplay of images and ideas between cultures can be subtle and complex. A scarab of Queen Tiye was amongst the offerings in the Shrine of the Idols, and though this was clearly an heirloom, no one could doubt the continued (even in- creased) importance of trading between Egypt and Mycenae, in particular, in the 13th century. Conversely, the closeness in concept between the lion gates of Mycenae and the Hittite citadel of Bogazkoy amply demonstrates the international standing of certain iconographic components even where direct contact appears to have been minimal. Such interconnections were, I believe, of deeper significance than is often granted; witness the astonishing discoveries of Minoan wall paintings at the sites of Tell el Dabca in Egypt and Tel Kabri in Israel, which have forced Aegean archaeologists to radically revise their views on the degree and importance of contacts for that (earlier) period.43 These particular images, viewed cautiously within the context of the international exchange of ideas, may serve to throw unexpected light on the iconogra- phy of this painting. In one of the two rock-cut Hittite sanctuaries at Yazilikaya (the main sanctuary for Bogazkoy), is a relief sculpture of a massive sword with the head of a god emerging from the top (PLATE 46.1). All around these sanctuaries, in the surrounding rocks, are burials. In an earlier Hittite ritual text, reference is made to a priest making images of underworld gods in the shape of swords and fixing them into the ground.44 In the colour symbolism of New Kingdom Egypt, red signified living (and sometimes bleeding), black sig- nified non-being. On the 19th dynasty papyrus in PLATE 46.2, the ba (one of the spiritual forms of the deceased) unites the shadow of the deceased - which is shown black - with the body - which is shown red since it has now entered the afterlife. A black sun indicates that the action takes place in the underworld.45 The Mycenaean painting in this shrine is linked with the neighbouring Shrine of the Idols through architec- tural and iconographic features. The terracotta figures from that shrine are anthropomorphic (rather than human) and have a uniquely fearsome expression to their painted faces. They were associated with snakes and with a natural rock incorporated into the shrine. These features most plausibly suggest a chthonic cult. Were the figures thought of as masked worshippers? as deities of the underworld? or perhaps as ancestors? Were the painted 'souls' thought of as ancestors? Is the goddess with the sword a deity of war and therefore protector over the warrior aristocracy, whether of the current or past generations? Let us reconsider these suggestions in the context of the date and setting of the shrines. They were built next to the fortification wall, at the same time as or immedi- ately after the new construction which incorporated Shaft Grave Circle A within the walls and was accom- panied by careful preservational changes to the Circle itself. Although there is no evidence for respect for graves outside Circle A, the open area between the two lower shrines clearly contained burials of earlier date. In fact, the whole of the Cult Centre was built over the Prehistoric Cemetery of Mycenae. But there is fertility as well as death in the painting, in the grain, promisingly held. Such duality is expressed in other paintings, excavated by Mylonas in the area immediately to the south of Tsountas' House. Whether this was part of the same Cult Centre remains unclear, as does the exact location of the paintings, but their 41 Marinatos 1988, 247-8. Cf.

Some of these paintings may have originated from the upper shrine, east of Tsountas' House, others may have decorated the walls of buildings to the south. In the former category are the paintings of so-called genii (daemons) holding a rope, a helmeted woman with a griffin (PLATE 47.5), fragments of a building, a palm tree, and fragments of female dress.46 These were found in Mylonas' Area A, though a fragment of a genius was discovered in the earlier excavations by Tsountas (PLATE 47.4), and clearly belongs to the same composition.47 These pieces could have been washed down from the upper slope. They may be contemporary with the painting from the Shrine of the Fresco. The other paintings - the Mykenaia holding her necklace (PLATE 21.2), the woman offering a figurine to a seated goddess, fragments of a female procession, an architectural fragment, and figure-of- eight shields (PLATE 48.4) - came from Area B, the South- West Building which lies south of Tsountas' House by the Citadel wall.48 They are thought to date to later in LH IIIB, perhaps after the whitewashing of the painting in the Shrine of the Fresco, and were de- stroyed at the end of that period. They might, therefore, have replaced the images of the earlier cult, though the possibility of overlap remains. Another fragment of a woman holding a lily, therefore presumably part of a procession, was found in Area Gamma. Mylonas dated it to LH IIIC but this seems unlikely.49 The duality inherent in the Shrine with the Fresco is mainly contained within the juxtaposition of scenes - the upper and the lower zones. Another type of duality is that in which each image making up the scene contains duality within itself. This is the case in the programme of paintings from Area A, which may have decorated the Tsountas House Shrine on the upper level. If it did, and if the dating of those paintings pre- dates the building of the wall which separated the upper shrine from the lower ones, then there would have been an even closer relationship between the three shrines than hitherto realised. The overall programme of the Cult Centre consists of a complex of interlocking iconographic elements in which the duality or multiplicity of symbolic meaning is acquired through the different contexts in which each image is placed. When an image has acquired a 'sym- bolic package' (as it does when used in different media in different contexts) and is placed in juxtaposition with other images of different appearance but with a similar range of symbolic meaning, each reflects meaning onto the other, creating an overall pattern through the pro- cess of accumulation. Both the new fragments of genii holding rope, found in Mylonas' excavations of Area A, and the fragment found by Tsountas have a blue background. In one case they face to the left, in the other to the right, but clearly they are from the same composition. In glyptic art the genius has a dual role: i) of fertility, watering a branch, holding libation jugs; ii) of death, carrying a dead bull or goat - the sacrificial animal - or a lion, or (uniquely on a seal from Kakovatos) giving protection to the scabbard of a lion-hunting hero.50 Most frequently, the genius waters palm branches. These painted genii were, therefore, probably related to the image of the palm, which has a blue background and was found in the same place. Yet they carry a rope over their shoulders, which might also be suggestive of their sacrificial role. Palm trees themselves have a dual function in the icono- graphic sphere: besides signifying life in the green branches which are watered, they also mark the place of death, as on seals from Mycenae and Crete showing a goat and a bull respectively.51 Found with the genii and the palm was a white- skinned figure holding a griffin (PLATE 47.5). The colour conventions of male and female skin are currently being challenged by new discoveries and debates in Aegean art,52 but it remains likely that this particular figure is female. That she holds a miniature griffin is interesting, given the image from the lower zone of the Shrine with the Fresco. Griffins - also iconographically associated with palm trees - are another creature with dual symbolic power, in this case not only in Aegean art, but throughout the ancient world. They may be protectors (of rulers, deities and priests); or they may be killers (of animals, in the hunt and (uniquely) of sacrifice). It is probably no coinci- dence that in the Shrine of the Fresco the female figure with attendant griffin is juxtaposed with a female figure with sword. We may imagine a programme for the Area A and open-air altar fragments - perhaps decorating the upper shrine - in which the genii approach (from left and right) a shrine (the architectural fragments) next to a palm tree, in the presence of a female warrior deity holding her emblem, the griffin. 46 Kritseli-Providi 1982, 21-36, pls.

A fragment of wall painting from Thebes shows a white, hence probably (though not conclusively) female fig- ure at a window (frequently a female architectural context) wearing a helmet.53 At Mycenae, all from the same area, the Cult Centre, came the woman with the sword of the Shrine with the Fresco (PLATE 24 a); the helmeted woman with griffin from Area A (PLATE 47.5) (perhaps from the Tsountas' House Shrine); the painted limestone plaque from the adyton of Tsountas' House Shrine; and from Area B of Mylonas' excavations, large figure-of-eight shields (PLATE 48.4) in association with a procession of women and offerings of a figurine to a seated female (goddess), jewellery (held by the Mykenaia, PLATE 21.2) and a vase. Throughout the iconography of the Cult Centre we see associations between female figures whose context would suggest goddesses, their votaries or priestesses, and certain repeated imagery: vegetation (grain, palm tree, flower); accoutrements of war (sword, helmet, shield); protective beasts (griffin, genius). The 'sym- bolic package' of this combination of imagery encompasses a life/death duality. Added to these repeated iconographic elements (from the slightly later (LH IIIB) paintings) are offerings of jewellery, figurine and vessel - precisely those offerings which were found in the Shrine of the Idols - and the architectural features, which in one case (from the Shrine of the Fresco) is clearly suggestive of the Shrine of the Idols itself. The themes of death - implied by the chthonic elements of snakes, unhewn rock, the anthropomorphic ferocity of the terracotta figures, the siting of the Cult Centre over the prehistoric cemetery, the synchronicity of the building of the shrines with the extension of the citadel wall and attendant reverence for the Shaft Grave Circle, and the iconography of the accoutrements of war associated with a goddess or goddesses - are accompanied by the fecundity of life, expressed through the plants. Such duality is wholly applicable to a cult centre within the context of a cemetery. It also has more widespread significance for Mycenaean religious thought as a whole. Such duality is not restricted to Mycenaean thought. Indeed, the existence of a female deity whose sphere of action encompasses both war and fecundity is a wide- spread phenomenon in the ancient Near East.54 Yet it is clearly a dominant theme of certain Mycenaean imagery. Although I have discussed the Mycenae Acropolis ring in PLATE 46.4 elsewhere (in a different context but in relation to duality)55 1 would like again to end with it as it so clearly expresses the characteristic patterning of symbolic images and is relevant to the study of the Cult Centre where, significantly, it was found (south of Shaft Grave Circle A, near the ruins of the Ramp House). The difference between the two sides (left and right of the women) has caused commentators to think in terms of a Minoan/Mycenaean dichotomy. The duality, how- ever, lies not in cultural diversity - Minoan versus Mycenaean - but in the structure of Mycenaean reli- gious thought as expressed in symbolic images. The pattern appears thus: left = life: sun, fruit tree, children, goddess right = death: moon, figure-of-eight shield, skulls centre: sacrificial axe, which kills to give life; procession of women, from death to life, towards the goddess. This image - significantly found in the same general area of Mycenae - reflects that basic duality which is expressed in the shrines of the Cult Centre at Mycenae: the duality of life and death. By this I mean not a polar- ity, but the constituents of the continuum of being. 53 Morgan 1988, pl. 156. 54 Inanna, Istar, Astarte, Asthoreth. 55 Morgan 1995^ 148-9.
