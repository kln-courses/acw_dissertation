This paper describes the preliminary results of a place-name project being conducted in the Sikusilarmiut land use area of southwest Baffin Island, Canada. Specifically, I explore how Sikusilarmiut toponymy can help inform broader scientific narratives about changing Arctic en- vironments. I discuss how Sikusilarmiut place names reflect Inuit multisensory notions of place and provide insight into the changing movements of people across the land, sea, and ice on a seasonal basis. Many Sikusilarmiut place names and routes also serve as important spatial and temporal reference points that can help integrate multiple ways of understanding and identify- ing environmental change through time. I discuss how the incorporation of Inuit place names into a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) database represents one way scientific knowledge and Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit can be used together to identify environmental indicators of climate change. I conclude, however, that these documentation efforts must be combined with more experiential and practical knowledge. Acting in the world is the practitioner's way of knowing it, thus the acquisition of environmental knowledge is inseparable from productive practice. Perceptual skills and technical skills are therefore two sides of the same coin. (Ingold 1992: 53) In the eastern Canadian Arctic, Inuit ways of knowing their world come to life through an ac- tive engagement with their surrounding environ- ment, informed by experience, observation, and language. Place names or toponyms represent one cultural manifestation through which Inuit express such an engagement. The names, naming, and narratives associated with specific places are part of what Tim Ingold (2004) has described as "story- based" knowledge that defines, in part, Inuit oral tradition. In this sense, toponymy represents a "descriptive force" (Hunn 1996:5) that forms an important component of a "memoryscape" where stories and myths unfold against a geographi- cal backdrop (Nuttall 1992:54). It is these unique understandings of place, together with Inuit con- structs of time that represent a unique means for documenting the temporal dimensions of changing relationships between people and environments. In this paper I describe the results of an ongoing project documenting Inuit place names amongst the Sikusilarmiut living in the commu- nity of Kinngait (Cape Dorset) on the southwest part of Baffin Island in the Qikiqtaaluk region of Nunavut, Canada. Specifically, I explore how Sikusilarmiut toponymy provides insight into belief systems and cultural practices and how such insights can help inform broader scientific Anne Henshaw, Coastal Studies Center and Department of Sociology and Anthropology, Bowdoin College, Brunswick, Maine 0401 1 ARCTIC ANTHROPOLOGY, Vol. 43, No. 1, pp. 52-66, 2006 ISSN 0066-6939 © 2006 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System</page><page sequence="2">Place-Name Research in the North Sikusilarmiut Place-Name Project Henshaw: Toponymy amongst the Sikusilarmiut 53 studies about changing Arctic environments. I discuss how Sikusilarmiut toponyms reflect Inuit multisensory notions of place, and when evoked in Inuit life-history narratives, place names pro- vide insight into the changing movements of people across the land, sea, and ice on a seasonal basis. Many Sikusilarmiut place names and routes have persisted through time and serve as impor- tant spatial and temporal reference points of climate-sensitive features such as sea ice and bird nesting areas. Such reference points are crucial for integrating multiple ways of understanding and identifying environmental change through time (Henshaw 2003a, 2003b). Inuit toponymy contains a rich corpus of knowl- edge relating to language, history, beliefs and the environment. Although toponym research has a long history in the field of anthropology,1 it has experienced something of a renaissance in recent decades with the work of Keith Basso (1984, 1988} among the Apache, Eugene Hunn (1994, 1996) among the Sahaptin language speakers on the Northwest Plateau of North America, Julie Crui- kshank (1990, 2001) in the Yukon, Mark Nuttall (1992) in northwest Greenland, Dennis Gaffin (1996) in the Faeroe Islands, and Tuija Rankama (1993) amongst the Sàmi. Much of this recent work emphasizes how "toponyms, both by them- selves and in the context of narratives, songs, and everyday speech, provide valuable insights into the ways humans experience the world and ap- propriate images of the landscape to interpret and communicate their experiences" (Thorton 1997:2). Over the last 20 years, communities in north- ern Canada working in partnership with academic researchers have undertaken comprehensive projects documenting place names in Nunavut, Nunavik, and the Northwest Territories. While initially this work focused on how place names could represent an important means for Inuit to assert their territorial rights (Müller Wille 1987, 1989/90), efforts now focus on giving greater recognition to Inuit geographic knowledge and in- clude locating Inuit place names on Canadian car- tographic maps (Collignon 2004). 2 Other research has emphasized the importance of place names as records of linguistic heritage, land use history, and as oral repositories of environmental knowl- edge, spatial orientation, and travel routes (Aporta 2003, 2004; Collignon 2002; Keith 2004; Müller Wille 2004; Peplinski 1990). Place names are also featured as a distinct program within the Depart- ment of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth in the Nunavut government especially because they form an important component of Inuit Qaujima- jatuqangit (IQ) or Inuit "traditional" knowledge that "encompasses all aspects of traditional Inuit culture including values, world view, language, social organization, knowledge, life skills, percep- tions and explanation" (Department of Culture, Language, Elder and Youth 2005).3 Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have become the standard tool for documenting the geo- graphic location of place names and the corpus of knowledge they reflect. This mapping technology has become an important development, as some Inuit are increasingly using paper maps and Global Positioning Systems (GPS) to help travel safely on the land (Aporta 2003). While GIS is a powerful tool, the maps produced by this technology tend to portray a very static view of what place names mean and how people who live in the region use them. Once researchers attempt to fix place names in geographic space in the form of maps, topon- ymy becomes almost timeless and the temporal dimension of any landscape is lost. For example, place-names in a single locale can change through time and once they are fixed to a map it is difficult to capture the dynamic and multidimensional characteristics of place naming. Increasingly, community-based place-name projects are coming to life through electronic web- based media that move the research beyond fixing names on maps. Projects such as the Kitikmeot Atlas Project4 have been incorporating sound and text through geographically referenced hyperlinks. In the western Arctic, Project Jukebox's Nunivak Island Place Names Project at the University of Alaska5 has taken similar multimedia approaches. While this work has been important for mobilizing northern communities to document place names, the anthropological significance of these studies, especially in relationship to the growing body of theoretical literature on "place" and "landscape," has not been fully explored. Below I describe pre- liminary results of the Sikusilarmiut Place-Name Project within a theoretical framework that links Inuit concepts of place and time to show how such knowledge can inform broader discussions of human-environmental interaction in the north. The Sikusilarmiut Place-Name Project evolved from an investigation of Inuit perceptions of changing climate initiated in 2000 and is part of an ongoing effort to document Inuit toponyms in the southwest area of Baffin Island. Franz Boas trans- lated the Inuktitut term "Sikusilarmiut" as "the inhabitants of the shore without an ice floe" (Boas 1964: 13); more recently Norman Hallendy has translated the name "Seekuseelak" to mean "where there is open water in winter" (Hallendy 2000:26). It also describes a land-use area that included three main regional settlement locals identified by William Kemp in the 1970s as part of the Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project (Kemp 1976).</page><page sequence="3">Methods 54 Arctic Anthropology 43:1 As Kemp (1976:125) describes, "In the northwest, at Cape Dorchester, there were three major camps Noovoojuak [Nuvujjuaq] and Nuwata [Nurata]; there was a second group in the Andrew Gordon Bay Area, including the camps that are still used, Iggalalik [Igalaalik], Ittidliajuk [Itilliarjuk], Ikirasak [Ikirasak] and Akatolaolavik [Aqiattulaullavik]; and the third group was in the Amadjuak Bay [Qa- rmaarjuit] area" (Kemp 1976:125}.6 Figure 1 shows the location of the camps identified by Kemp and reconfirmed by the current project, however most are no longer in use today. The Sikusilarmiut Place-Name Project draws from the expertise of Inuit living in the present- day community of Kinngait, meaning "mountains or high hill." Kinngait is a medium sized hamlet with approximately 1,200 residents. The region has a rich archaeological record dating back at least 3,000 years with Pre Dorset, Dorset, and Thule sites scattered across the historical land- scape. The Hudson's Bay Company opened a post at the location of the present-day community in 1913. A Roman Catholic mission that operated from 1938-1960 and an RCMP attachment that opened in 1965 followed. People began perma- nently settling in the community in the 1960s with the advent of government housing, health, educational programs, and the West Baffin Coop- erative, which is the main distributor of soapstone carvings, prints, drawings, and engravings (Kemp 1976:125). Many of the eldest members of the com- munity interviewed as part of this study grew up in outpost camps located along the coastline. They moved regularly across vast areas of the land and sea to hunt and trap. To date 420 place names have been recorded on six 1:250,000 scale topographic maps. This represents the first phase of research involving fieldwork in the community and surrounding areas as well as database development working with GIS. The second phase will record Inuit life his- tory narratives and will map biographies to help connect activities and features associated with certain environmentally sensitive places within a temporal framework. The methods employed in this project involve a combination of 1) community-wide workshops, 2) one-on-one interviews with Inuit elders, 3) participant observation, and 4) computer data- base development, all of which follow the basic guidelines outlined in the Guide to the Field Collection of Native Geographic Names (CPCGN 1992). In each context I worked with interpreter and collaborator Aksatungua Ashoona. The basic methodology of recording a name and its meaning (or related explanation) and locating the area on a paper map provides the basic framework for the initial investigation. Mapping workshops typically involved 10-15 individuals in Kinngait's Com- munity Hall. Individual maps were laid out on tables where people could add names or verify the location, spelling and pronunciation of existing ones. Workshops were most productive in the be- ginning phases of the project when we first started gathering toponyms. As the project has evolved and the process of verification moves forward, working with individuals and families familiar with specific areas has proved the most produc- tive methodology. This is because Inuit who lived in specific settlements gained specialized knowl- edge related to surrounding areas. In the passage below, Kinngait elder Ashevak Ezekiel (Ashevak Ezekiel, interviewed 2005; Aksatungua Ashoona, trans.) describes, through an interpreter, how Inuit acquired place-name knowledge, ... in the past when Inuit camped at certain spots . . . they were familiar with the area only so each camp had its own knowledgeable information and names and they exchanged [information about routes and place-names] if you passed through [they would say] "this is the route" and "it's safer" [to go this way], etc. During one-on-one interviews, we would bring maps of the areas most familiar to the indi- vidual being interviewed. We recorded toponyms in syllabics directly on the maps and information pertaining to individual places in an associated table. This information sometimes represented a direct translation of a place name such as "Imiq," a place where you can find water, or an explana- tion related to a place that was described in the form of a story or event. Stories could be elaborate, such as the one told to me about a place known as "Iqsauti." While the name refers to the side of a face, the story of what unfolded there involved the illicit love affair of two people who would secretly meet inside a sea ice cave at low tide. Eventually, the two lovers were discovered and caused the break up of a family who camped there. A common challenge in employing this meth- odology was translating experiential and historical knowledge transmitted orally into written form. To capture this dynamic element, most inter- views were audio taped. An additional challenge involved standardizing the spelling of Inuktitut words into Roman Orthography and Syllabics, which is not a straightforward process. With the aid of my interpreter, Aksatungia Ashoona, names were recorded according to Inuit Cultural Institute (ICI) Roman Orthographic standards. If places were associated with more than one name, all the names were recorded. For example, elders often indicated what they considered to be the "original" name of a place - sometimes different from names provided by younger Inuit experts. The identification of additional place names and</page><page sequence="4">Henshaw: Toponymy amongst the Sikusilarmiut 55 Figure 1.

Sikusilarmiut toponym typology and classifications definitions. routes, and their verifications (spelling, location) is part of an on-going effort I am conducting in col- laboration with the Hamlet of Cape Dorset. Participant observation took place during the summer of 2003 while traveling in Andrew Gordon Bay with Timun and Kristiina Alariaq. This fieldwork was valuable for gaining a sense of the important role place names play in navigation and spatial orientation. This first-hand experience of visiting named places and documenting them through video and photographs also helped dem- onstrate the multisensory perception Inuit have of the land and sea. GIS Database Development All the content derived from the workshops, interviews and fieldwork were entered into a GIS database using ArcGIS 9, an ESRI software prod- uct. Six l:250,000-scale digital topographic maps purchased through the Canadian Topographic Ser- vice served as base maps for the project. Polygons from the original paper topographic maps were digitized on a computer screen using Didger 3, a digitizing software that creates shape files7 that can be imported into ArcMap. The database fields con- sist of a unique site number for each place name, geographic coordinates, the toponym transcribed in Roman Orthography, the toponym transcribed in Syllabics, associated explanations and transla- tions, additional names given to the place, the names of Inuit experts who identified individual place names, the interpreter, and the typology code described below. The power of GIS lies in its flexibility and the possibility of accommodat- ing many fields and incorporating sound, images (moving and still), and text. One longer-term goal of this project is to incorporate these multimedia elements into the database in order to better com- municate the many and varied associations Inuit have with place names. Typology The place-name typology created for this proj- ect closely parallels the work of Eugene Hunn (1996) amongst Sahaptin language speakers on the Northwest Plateau of North America and Darren Keith (2000) in his work with the Harvaqtuurmiut in Kitikmeot Region of Nunavut. In these studies, place names were classified and grouped together based on certain attributes (environmental, histori- cal, etc.) associated with each name. Table 1 shows the definitions for the different classifications used in the present study. The purpose of this scheme is to quantify and categorize the descriptive nature of Sikusilarmiut toponyms. Each place name was assigned to one or more of these classifications, as often the names would pertain to more than one type of feature. Names describing topographic fea- tures such as mountaintops, cliffs, and peninsulas comprise a majority of the references (176 cases) and reveal the important role toponyms have in spatial orientation and navigation (Fig. 2). Other place names also fall into distinct categories such as those that serve as metaphors for animal and human body parts (55 cases), ecological features that make reference to the presence and/or behav- iors of specific plants and animals or harvesting activities (78 cases), and climate-sensitive features that include references to seasonal camping areas, sea ice, ocean currents, snow conditions, bird nest- ing areas, animal migratory behavior, temperature, and wind conditions (59 cases). Specific examples related to each of these categories are described in the following sections. This type of classification coupled with GIS not only reveals the unique way Inuit experience place and perceive the landscape Classification Definition Climate sensitive features Sea ice conditions, ocean currents, seasonal camping locations, snow conditions, nesting areas, temperature conditions, animal migrations, wind directions Ecological features Presence of specific plants and animals, animal products, signs of animal presence, animal behavior Topographic features Terrestrial (mountains, cliffs, hills, peninsula), hydrographic (shorelines, passages), aquatic (lakes and rivers) Metaphorical features Mythic associations, zoomorphic, and anthropomorphic Harvesting activities Hunting, processing, caching areas Routes Travel, resting spots, safe anchorages Camps Camp sites Other Archaeological sites, historic events, Inuksuit</page><page sequence="6">Henshaw: Toponymy amongst the Sikusilarmiut 57 Figure 2.

Place Names in a Multisensory World Toponyms bring to light the unique way Inuit ex- perience place. Inuit understandings of place can be compared to Sàmi understandings of weather as described by Tim Ingold and Terhi Kurttila (2000). Ingold and Kurttila argue that Saami as "inhabitants" engage in the practical experience of the world that surrounds them and build up their knowledge of the weather through a lifetime of experience moving from place to place. Knowl- edge of weather, like culture itself, does not come ready-made, but people grow into their under- standings of it through the experience of inhabit- ing an environment. Ingold further argues that the perception of the weather is multisensory, serving as an important reference for spatial orientation and coordinating activities. Multisensory perceptions of place are also conveyed through Inuit toponymy. Sikusilarm- iut place names are rich with visual imagery and metaphorical references that illuminate Inuit un- derstandings of the world that surrounds them. For example toponyms such as: Aiviqqat, islands that resemble walruses swimming in a group; Qiniit, a place that resembles layers of seal fat when cut open; and Nalluujalik, a place that resembles the hind leg of a caribou. In addition to this visual ele- ment, many of the place names describe features of place that make references to other senses includ- ing smell, touch, and sound. For example, names including: Aluqpaluk, a place where you can hear the sound of footsteps because there are many eider ducks taking flight off the water; Miaggujuq- talik, an island where you can hear something howling; Tatsiumajuq, a place where you feel your surroundings through touch; or Kauktuut, a place where you eat the skin of walrus. In many ways, multisensory examples such as these communi- cate an animistic worldview found in so many dif- ferent cultural contexts across the Arctic in which the environment is perceived as alive. Such multisensory aspects of place are not limited to Inuit. Dennis Gaffin (1996) reported sim- ilar perceptions by the Faeroe islanders. As Gaffin states (1996:106), "Like the places they represent, names often emanate moods and feelings. They all contribute to the dominant aesthetic of place. Particular visual, auditory, olfactory, and tactile experiences affix to locations. In some places the sea air fills your nostrils, or the spray wets your 200 -| : 1 150 ^^M llllilil Climate sensitive Ecological features Topographic Metaphorical Harvesting activities Route Camp Other</page><page sequence="7">Toponyms, Movement and the Temporality of Landscape Place Names and the Mapping of Environmental Change: The Challenge of Integration 58 Arctic Anthropology 43:1 face. Even flavor sensations can adhere to place- names - some sheep graze on certain guano- enriched pastures near bird cliffs and provide the consumer with sought after tastes." Similar types of taste aesthetic were reported to me by Inuit who preferred the taste of certain char that came from specific rivers such as Sapujjuat, a place name referring to a big fish weir, at a place where fish are still caught today. In the context of environmental change, the multisensory perceptions could also represent perhaps more subtle environmental cues or indicators and offer new ways of exploring the full breadth of Inuit knowledge particularly sensi- tive to changing environmental conditions. I know for sure, as I am from Cape Dorset, that we never just sat still. Peter Pitseolak (Pitseolak and Eber 1993:141) Archaeology, together with Inuit oral history, has been the principle tool anthropologists use to discover the rich temporal dimension of north- ern landscapes. I would argue that place-names, far from being static locations on maps, also can provide important insights into mobility and temporality. For Inuit, like other groups that live through an active and direct engagement with the environment, places are brought to life through the experiences of each successive generation who inhabit them (Ingold 1993). Place names evoked in the context of narrative also serve as referential markers that are used to describe peoples' move- ments across that land and sea on a seasonal basis. In narrative, the element of time and place most often come together within the nine temporal frameworks recognized by Inuit and documented by Norman Hallendy (2000:60) in his study of Inuksuit in southwest Baffin Island. I would argue these same frames of reference can be important indicators of how we integrate temporality into place-name research. Although the time frames range from decades to thousands of years, they can help situate the characteristics and activities of specific places in time. For the purposes of this paper, it is in the context of Iqaumaluga taimag- nanituqaluk or "living memory" that events and details about a place are most vividly revealed through toponymy. As an example, I turn to the oral biography and life story of Peter Pitseolak (Pitseolak and Eber 1993). Peter Pitseolak was a prominent leader and renowned for his photographic practice amongst the Sikusilarmiut. Over the course of the biogra- phy, Pitseolak makes reference to over 60 place names. Many of the names are used to document the course of his life and his movements between different camps and places on a seasonal basis. A place name invoked throughout the story is Pit- seolak's main winter camp, Itidliarjuk (spelled by Pitseolak "Etidliajuk"). Much of his life revolved around this camp and the people who lived there. From Itidliarjuk, Pitseolak moved considerable distances on a seasonal basis between Kimmirut, Kinngait, and Nurata on the northern tip of Foxe Peninsula. Figure 3 plots 40 place names refer- enced by Pitseolak in his oral biography that were identified in the project study area. In many ways, the significance of place names for Pitseolak were not the names them- selves but how they served as a temporal and spatial mnemonic markers for telling his lifestory. Table 2 lists the toponyms identified during Pit- seolak's oral biography together with the specific years and seasons he visited specific places. Place names, in this sense, become a vehicle for under- standing Inuit mobility and travel, and underscore the fundamental part they play in Inuit lives. As Claudio Aporta (2004:13) describes in his recent study of routes, trails, and tracks in the Igloolik area, traveling, "...was not a transitional activity between one place and another, but a way of be- ing." In this sense, Inuit mobility is more than just part of a "seasonal round" related to subsistence, but movement itself constituted an important part of Inuit culture and memory especially relating to ways that Inuit "learn the landscape." Similar types of mobility were described in the "map biographies" recording by the Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project in the 1970s (Freeman 1976). In this comprehensive project, individual hunters were asked to track their movement across the landscape in relation to the specific animals they hunted. Although this 1976 study did not link individual life histories to specific place names, the idea of using "map biographies" in a systematic way offers an important direction for future toponym research. In addition to providing insight into Inuit multi- sensory notions of place and mobility, place names themselves make reference to a host of environ- mentally sensitive areas that can serve as a point of intersection with many ongoing studies explor- ing northern peoples' perceptions of weather and changing climate (Fox 2003; Hassol 2004; Laidler and Gough 2003; MacDonald, Arragutainaq, and Novalinga 1997; Ooseva, Alowa, and Krupnik 2004; Riedlington 2001). Much of the research being undertaken on climate change collects data in the form of Inuit narratives, notations on maps,</page><page sequence="8">Henshaw: Toponymy amongst the Sikusilarmiut 59 Figure 3.

The location of place names with a question mark have not been verified. or most recently by making reference to satellite imagery (George et al., 2004; Norton and Gaylord 2004). Place names offer a point of convergence between these varied methodological approaches. As Hunn (1996:19) has pointed out, top- onyms indicate where things happen and by definition those happenings occur not once but over the course of seasons, years, or even genera- tions. Even place names that may refer to an event, take on new meanings as successive generations of Inuit traverse the land. When the nature of activi- ties or meanings associated with certain named places change, toponyms provide an important benchmark for understanding and documenting changing people and landscapes through time. For example, Avalirut [a place located near the floe edge where people built snowhouses in March and April], Igluvigaqtalik [a place where there were always snowhouses], Ungujaqtalik [a place where many people lived in snowhouses], Inugiav- vik [a gathering spot in winter without houses], and Illuvigaqtulliq [a place where snowhouses are built, the snow is good for iglu building] are all places located in proximity to the floe edge where Sikusilarmiut gathered in winter or once built snowhouse villages (Fig. 4). The location of the floe edge is dynamic and may be an important indicator of instability in the marine environ- ment particularly during earlier spring break ups (Henshaw 2003a). During the severe ice year of 1983 maps show that Illuvigaqtulliq was located in the land-fast ice zone, but during a less severe year it is located past the floe edge in less stable ice conditions, which may not have been suitable for building such villages. In Figure 5, the location of three snowhouse village sites are plotted in rela-</page><page sequence="9">60 Arctic Anthropology 43:1 Table 2. Place names referenced by Peter Pitseolak that overlap with the present study, together with seasonal and temporal associations Pitseolak recounted during the course of his oral biography (Pitseolak and Eber 1993).

Two of the three sites are located outside the land-fast ice, perhaps suggesting receding ice con- ditions during recent decades, although ice data would be needed to confirm this hypothesis. In all of these examples, the places serve as historical markers of past activities (building snowhouses) and environmental features (location of the floe edge) that may be sensitive to changing environ- ments through time. Routes themselves are also important en- vironmental indicators of changing conditions related to weather and climate. When describ- ing a specific route shown in Figure 6, Kinngait elder Iqallluq Nungusuituq indicated through an interpreter how specific routes vary depending on weather conditions: "when the sea is calm we go this way, these are shallow areas too that you have to go around to avoid from getting stuck" and "when it's high tide they use this [route] when it's windy, but when it's low tide they can't go through the route because it is too shallow ... if I'm travel- Pitseolak Place Name Alternate Spelling Map Number Seasonal Reference Year Kinguk Qingua (?) 1 Eteenapik Itinnaapik 2 Taseejuakjuak Tasiujarjuaq 3 summer, spring Tikerak Tikiraq 4 winter, spring 1908 Newleejutalik Niulijuqtalik 5 Edlojuat, Edloojuak Illurjuaq 6 Satoretok Saattuqittuq 7 Kamadjuak Qarmaajuit 8 Eemeeleegajut Imiligaaluk 9 Ikirassak Ikirasak 10 winter 1930 or 1931 Sahrok Saarru 11 spring Shabuk Sarva 12 Eesaotet Iqsauti 13 Egalalik Igalaalik 14 winter 1922 Sasukrauk Saksukain (?) 15 Toolukat, Toolookat Tulukkat 16 spring 1909 Kageak Kangia 17 Sabarosek Sarvarusiup Qingua 18 1909 Teekot Tikkuut 19 Khreemeetook Qimmiqtuuq 20 spring 1911 Etidliajuk Itilliarjuk 21 winter 1910, 1917 Keekeetajook Qiqiqtaarjuk 22 Odlee Ulliit 23 winter Nowjakudluk Naujakallait 24 Toonikjuak Tunirjuat 25 spring 1909 Sapotit Sapujjuat 26 Eemik Imiq 27 Ooleejuak Ullirjuat 28 Kageeshooreetuk Kangiqsujuap nuvua 29 Inaroolik Inaarulik 30 winter, spring, fall 1918 Alaveetook Alarvittuq 31 Ejureetuk Ijjurittuq 32 winter 1922 Inukshuk Point Inuksugasalik 33 Nuvoojuak Nuvujjuaq 34 Nurata Nurata 35 spring, summer 1915 Eeekalogajoet Iqalugaarjuk 36 Tooneen Tuniit 37 Akeatolaolabek Aqiattulaullavik 38 Kagesoajok Kangiqsuarjuk 39 Kalosebek Kallusirvik 40</page><page sequence="10">Henshaw: Toponymy amongst the Sikusilarmiut 61 Figure 4.

Specific routes traveled in winter are also sensitive to changing ice conditions. As Iqalluq states, "this is where the ice never freezes [forms], Sarvaaluk, so they would travel through another route because it is dangerous through there, the ice doesn't freeze [form]" (Nungusuituq 2005). It is this kind of specificity that can lead to detailed knowledge about how people respond to changes in their environment. Similarly, toponyms describing bird-nesting areas provide very specific knowledge about ani- mal behavior that is sensitive to changing envi- ronmental conditions. Figure 7 shows the location of various bird nesting grounds in relation to the wildfowl land use described by Inuit hunters in the Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project (Free- man 1976). While the area east of Cape Dorset is protected as a National Bird Sanctuary, the specific location of nesting areas is not well documented. This gap in information points to the important role Inuit knowledge can play in monitoring spe- cies migrations and behavior. Discussion and Conclusion For the future generations they have to realize and know the names because Inuit are hunters ... be- cause this is our land, our life. (Ashevak Ezekiel, translated by Aksatungua Ashoona 2005) Ultimately the places Inuit inhabit represent more information than anyone can capture through car- tography or databases, and researchers need to be careful not to take the knowledge gleaned through toponymy out of context. Although representing place names on maps does not fully convey the rich and multisensory notions of time and place in the names, the maps do represent a common refer- ence point and offer the potential for scientists and Inuit to share knowledge about a landscape important to both. A combined approach focusing on names and the way they are evoked through life histories represents one way that toponymy can be used for tracking changing land use and environ- ments through time. Together with archaeology, toponymy and life histories help create a temporal framework for discovering the deep sense of time that is embedded in any landscape.</page><page sequence="13">64 Arctic Anthropology 43:1 Figure 7. Distribution of bird nesting areas identified through toponyms in relation to wildfowl land use (1960-1974) documented by the Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project (Freeman 1976). However, the younger generations face chal- lenges in gaining experience on the land and in "learning the names" so important to the cultural heritage and safety. Inuit modes of transportation have changed dramatically over the last half-cen- tury and with the increase speeds associated with boats and snowmobiles, time spent traveling and getting to know an area is reduced. As Ashevak Ezekiel (personal communication 2005) explains, "snow mobiles and dogs are totally different to use to go hunting so with dogs it was perfect to learn the land ... by gathering information more slowly and pausing along the journey." "Pausing along the journey" can still take place but requires a concerted, intentional effort that involves community-wide intergenerational participation. Such efforts are beginning to take place with land-based programs like the Junior Rangers and within some educational contexts where "traditional" skills are increasingly being recognized as important ingredients to sustainabil- ity and resiliency amidst growing social and envi- ronmental uncertainty. Maliqattarnikkut iliniarniq, the process by which Inuit learn the names, is just one aspect of Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, but one that underscores the important role accumulated and experiential knowledge play in adapting to northern environments. Without such knowledge the risks of traveling in unpredictable and ever changing conditions make individuals and groups that much more vulnerable to the extreme climate change currently being forecasted for the Arctic. The project also has implications for under- standing how historical landscapes unfold and how place names, as mnemonic devices, bring to life a unique history of land use and environmen- tal perception. As the northern landscapes become home to new generations of people inhabiting the Arctic, toponyms can provide the "memoryscapes" that will help Inuit and other groups not only navi- gate the physicality of the land, ice, and sea but will also keep alive the cultural heritage of places layered with meaning.
