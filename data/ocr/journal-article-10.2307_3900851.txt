<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANTHROPOMORPHISM: You should know what it is Cliff Hamilton The dictionary defines anthropomorphism as the "ascrib- ing of human characteristics to nonhuman things." Humans have probably been doing this as long as there has been a developed form of communication. Film animation and development of cartoons, however, caused a real boom in anthropomorphism. Disney was the first to extensively por- tray all kinds of wildlife with human characteristics. The three little pigs walked on their hind legs, danced and sang in the street and built human-style houses. The big bad wolf also walked upright in human fashion. So did Mickey Mouse, Yogi Bear and the rest of the cartoon gang. We regularly see or read material portraying animals in human terms with feelings such as love, anger, disappointment and desire. Animals are seen to converse among themselves, to work at jobs such as policemen orfiremen, and to socialize in various manners. Anthropomorphic treatment of animals makes much more appealing cartoon material and printed stories. It certainly sells more copies, too, but there are other prices that society pays for such seemingly harmless portrayals. As the urbani- zation of this country continues, huge portions of our popu- lation have increasingly less contact with wildlife and the natural world. To many people, these cuddly bears, crafty foxes and wise old owls are more real than the animal itself. Anthropomorphic approaches to wildlife constitute little more than false advertising. The resulting impressions of animals as somehow "human" have led to somevery ecologi- cally unsound actions both legislative and legal. Court actions and legislation aimed at "saving all the animals" are a familiar and distressing result of a nation long fed a diet of anthropomorphic creatures. Protectionist groups regularly clash with wildlife managers over the need to scientifically manage some wild population. Many of these groups are made up of and financed by well-meaning urbanites who have little knowledge of the real nature of nature. Wildlife is another form of life with which we share this The above reprint from Oregon Wildlife, December 1981, was contributed by E. William Anderson, Certified Range Management Consultant, Lake Oswego, Ore. The author is at Oregon Department of Fish and Wi Idlife, Box 3503, Portland 97208. Comment from Anderson: This article is highly appropriate information for all resource workers because it deals with a special kind of psychology that is evident in non-hunters, preservationist, wildlife defenders, and others who make up a strong segment of the group of environmental extremists we have to deal with today. planet. Wild creatures are not human and have few human characteristics beyond the basic instincts and requirements to sustain life. Their portrayal as being otherwise is more than harmless "kid" stuff. One would reason that any adult would clearly accept that animals do not dress up in human clothes, "talk" among themselves, or apply logic and reason to their daily activities. In view of the pressures on wildlife programs by misguided citizens it would appear that such is not necessarily the case. This letter to the editor of the Courier (Prescott, Ariz.) is along the same lines. Teach both sides of issue EDITOR: I read with interest the letters from the 9-year-olds regard- ing kind treatment of their pets and animals sponsored by the Yavapai Humane Society in the May 8 issue. The letter that attracted my attention is the one declaring that animals have the same rights as people. That concerns me that a youngster that age would initiate that philosophy without being prompted or at least it being suggested to him. What lies behind the fundamental issue here is a typical case of animal protection by the public whether they be dogs, cats, cows, lambs or rabbits. Considerable attention has been given by the press to the animal welfare and animal rights movements. The animal welfare movement is not as negative toward animal livestock production as the animal rights groups. "Animal Welfare" recognizes the need for livestock produc- tion, but has considerable problems with intensive manage- ment systems that may produce stress in the animal. Animal rights is a moral and philosophical belief that all animals have an inherent right to the "pursuit of happiness." That there are questionable practices in animal production is not to be disputed, but we must try to correct them hon- estly. Companion animals do serve a very worthwhile func- tion in improving the quality of life for a large segment of the population. Where we run into problems is when we transfer our affections unintentionally to the meat animal production field. The image of a poor calf or lamb going to slaughter sends chills up the spine of many. What I am saying is, to teach the youngsters to be kind to animals, but also teach them where beef steak and fried chicken comes from.-Carlton L. Camp, Yavapai County Ag.
