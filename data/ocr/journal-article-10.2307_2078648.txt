<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bureaucratic Politics J. Garry Clifford In the mid-1960s, when members of the Harvard Faculty Study Group on Bureau- cracy, Politics, and Policy began to write their scholarly tomes, their sometime col- league in the mathematics department, the folk singer Tom Lehrer, inadvertently gave song to what came to be called the "bureaucratic politics" approach to the study of United States foreign policy. In his ballad about a certain German emigre rocket scientist, Lehrer wrote: "Once the rockets are up/ Who cares where they come down?/ That's not my department!/ Said Wernher von Braun."1 Lehrer's ditty, by suggesting that government is a complex, compartmentalized machine and that those running the machine do not always intend what results, anticipated the lan- guage of bureaucratic politics. The dark humor also hinted that the perspective might sometimes excuse as much as it explains about the foreign policy of the United States. The formal academic version of bureaucratic politics came a few years later with the publication of Graham T. Allison's Essence of Decision. Building on works by Warner R. Schilling, Roger Hilsman, Richard E. Neustadt, and other political scien- tists who emphasized internal bargaining within the foreign policy process, and adding insights from organizational theorists such as James G. March and Herbert A. Simon, Allison examined the Cuban missile crisis to refute the traditional as- sumption that foreign policy is produced by the purposeful acts of unified national governments. Allison argued that instead of resembling the behavior of a "rational actor," the Kennedy administration's behavior during the crisis was best explained as the "outcomes" of the standard operating procedures followed by separate organi- zations (the navy's blockade, the Central Intelligence Agency's U-2 overflights, and the air force's scenarios for a surgical air strike) and as the result of compromise and competition among hawks and doves seeking to advance individual and organiza- tional versions of the national interest. Allison soon collaborated with Morton H. Halperin to formalize the bureaucratic politics paradigm.2 Other scholars followed J.

The John E Kennedy School of Government at Harvard made bureaucratic politics the centerpiece of its new public policy program, and Allison became its dean. By the 1980s his framework was being hailed as "one of the most widely disseminated concepts in all of social science."3 The Allisonian message holds that United States foreign policy has become in- creasingly political and cumbersome with the growth of bureaucracy after World War II. Diversity and conflict permeate the policy process. There is no single "maker" of foreign policy. Policy flows instead from an amalgam of large organiza- tions and political actors who differ substantially on any particular issue and who compete to advance their own personal and organizational interests as they try to influence decisions. The president, while powerful, is not omnipotent; he is one chief among many. Even when a direct presidential decision is reached, the game does not end because decisions are often ignored or reversed. Jimmy Carter may have thought he had killed the B-1 bomber, but a decade later the weapon was still being produced and its utility still being debated. Because organizations rely on routines and plans derived from experience with familiar problems, those standard routines usually form the basis for options furnished the president. Ask an organiza- tion to do what it has not done previously, and it will usually do what the United States military did in Vietnam: It will follow existing doctrines and procedures, modifying them only slightly in deference to different conditions. Final decisions are also "political resultants," the product of compromise and bar- gaining among the various participants. As Allison puts it, policies are "resultants in the sense that what happens is not chosen . . . but rather results from com- promise, conflict, and confusion of officials with diverse interests and unequal influ- ence; political in the sense [of] . . . bargaining along regularized channels among individual members of government." Similarly, once a decision is made, consider- able slippage can occur in implementing it. What follows is hostage to standard R.

Even when a president personally monitors performance, as John E Kennedy tried to do with the navy's blockade during the missile crisis, organizational repertoires and hierarchies are so rigid and complex that the president cannot micromanage all that happens. Kennedy's own naval background notwithstanding, he did not know that antisub- marine warfare units were routinely forcing Soviet submarines to the surface, thus precipitating the very confrontations he so painstakingly tried to avoid.4 The bureaucratic politics perspective also suggests that intramural struggles over policy can consume so much time and attention that dealing effectively with ex- ternal realities becomes secondary. Strobe Talbott's extraordinarily well informed ac- counts of arms control policy during the Carter and Reagan years confirm the truism that arriving at a consensus among the various players and agencies within the government is more complicated, if not more difficult, than negotiating with the Soviets. Ironically, officials who are finely attuned to the conflict and compartmen- talism within the American government often see unitary, purposive behavior on the part of other governments. Recall the rush to judgment about the Soviet shooting down of a Korean airliner in 1983 as compared to the tortured ("rules of engagement") justifications that followed the destruction of an Iranian aircraft by the American naval cruiser Vincennes in 1988. Wallace Thies has shown that Wash- ington's protracted efforts in the 1960s to coerce North Vietnam by calibrating mili- tary pressure and diplomatic signals were doomed from the outset; not only did senior officials assume that the messages received in North Vietnam would be the same as those sent, never realizing that everyday "noise" created by ongoing military operations might drown out the intended signals, but they were oblivious to the fact that Hanoi's revolutionary goals made negotiations on the terms Washington meant to convey impossible.5 Several criticisms have been leveled at the bureaucratic politics approach. Some critics contend that ideological core values shared by those whom Richard J. Barnet has called "national security managers" weigh more in determining policy than do differences attributable to bureaucratic position. The axiom "where you stand de- pends on where you sit" has had less influence, they argue, than the generational mind-set of such individuals as Paul Nitze, John J. McCloy, and Clark Clifford, whose participation in the foreign policy establishment spanned decades and cut across bureaucratic and partisan boundaries. Similarly, the perspective underesti- mates the extent to which the president can dominate the bureaucracy by selecting key players and setting the rules of the game. The Tower Commission report exposed the flaws of instant bureaucratic analysis when it simplistically blamed the Iran- Contra affair on a loose cannon in the White House basement and exonerated a detached president who was allegedly cut out of the policy "loop."6 The historian 4Allison, Essence of Decision, 138, 162. 5 Strobe Talbott, Endgame: The Inside Story of Salt II (New York, 1979); Strobe Talbott, Deadly Gambits: The Reagan Administration and the Stalemate in Nuclear Arms Control (New York, 1984); Wallace J.

There is also the problem of evidence. Given the pitfalls in getting access to recent government documents, analysts of bureaucratic politics have relied heavily on per- sonal interviews. Indeed, one scholar has stated that if "forced to choose between the documents on the one hand, and late, limited, partial interviews on the other, I would be forced to discard the documents." In addition to using available docu- ments, James G. Blight and David A. Welch have pioneered a "critical oral history" method whereby participants and scholars meet to reexamine past events such as the Cuban missile crisis.7 Despite the value of having Robert McNamara, Dean Rusk, McGeorge Bundy, and others review their roles and answer hard questions for the record, many historians would prefer that the current guardians of national secu- rity declassify and transcribe all tape recordings of meetings held by the Executive Committee of the National Security Council during the October 1962 crisis. Just as bureaucratic processes can shape policy, so too can scholarly interpretations be skewed by a research method that permits participants to put excessive spin on the past. Yet those defects in the bureaucratk politics approach may not hamper histo- rians, who do not need models that predict perfectly. Unlike political scientists, they do not seek to build better theories or to propose more effective management tech- niques. Because the bureaucratic politics approach emphasizes state-level analysis, it cannot fully answer such cosmic questions as why the United States has opposed revolutions or why East-West issues have predominated over North-South issues. It is better at explaining the timing and mechanics of particular episodes, illuminating proximate as opposed to deeper causes, and showing why outcomes were not what was intended. The bureaucratic details of debacles like Pearl Harbor and the Bay of Pigs invasion are thus better understood than the long-term dynamics of war and peace. As such, to borrow Isaiah Berlin's anthropomorphic analogy, bureaucratic politics provides one of many truths the fox must know as he competes with the single-minded hedgehog.8 Whether one studies nuclear strategy, the rise of the military-industrial complex, or the United States alliance with Britain, bureaucratic history provides pertinent pieces to the jigsaw puzzle.

One of the few efforts to test Allison's model systematically, Lucien S. Vandenbroucke's analysis of the Bay of Pigs affair places much of the blame on officials in the Central Intelligence Agency who planned, organized, and sold the operation as a fail-safe version of the 1954 Guatemalan intervention; Vandenbroucke nonetheless concludes that Presi- dent Kennedy, in his visceral Cold War values, wishful thinking, and discourage- ment of dissenters from "speaking up in church," was the real father of the fiasco. Jonathan G. Utley and Irvine H. Anderson, in separate accounts of the 1941 deci- sion by the United States government to freezeJapanese assets, argue that organiza- tional momentum and excessive zeal by second-echelon officials, most notably As- sistant Secretary of State Dean Acheson, transformed the freezing order into a de facto embargo against Japan that neither Franklin D. Roosevelt nor Cordell Hull had intended when he signed it. In a recent study of the end of World War II in the Pacific, Leon V. Sigal demonstrates that both Washington and Tokyo behaved as if "each of their pieces on the board -armies, navies, air forces, diplomats -was acting on its own volition, moving according to its own program. There was, in short, no Pacific Endgame."9 Ernest R. May, chairman of the Harvard seminar that inaugurated the bureau- cratic politics approach, has utilized it artfully and often. Because "one cannot run the facts of political history through a computer and test whether the outcome would have been different if one variable was changed and the others remained con- stant," May has been suggestive rather than definitive in studying historical lessons used and misused by bureaucrats and presidents. He has compared Harry S. Truman's decision not to intervene in China with that of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson to do so in Vietnam, and, in a recent collaboration, he and Richard E. Neustadt have shown how decision makers can better use history to "think in time," to "dodge bothersome analogues," and to "place" particular organi- zations within their own parochial understanding of the past.10 Greater application of the bureaucratic politics framework presupposes solid 9 Randall Bennett Woods, The Roosevelt Foreign Policy andthe "Good Neighbor".

May's study of the Monroe Doctrine, which stressed the primacy of ambition and electoral politics in ex- plaining the actions of PresidentJames Monroe and his cabinet in 1823, did not elicit universal acceptance from historians.

Indeed, May has urged "quasi-anthropological research just to establish who ought to be the personae in our narratives.""1 Thus far the historical literature, as might be expected, is fullest on the period before 1945. Building on the organiza- tional synthesis of Robert H. Wiebe and Louis Galambos, historians have done fine work in charting the growth of the State Department and United States Foreign Service, analyzing the collective world view at State, and studying its regional ex- perts. Philip Baram is particularly effective in combining the bureaucratic politics approach and an understanding of Open Door ideology to account for State's pro- Arab policies during World War 11.12 Similar studies of the State Department and other agencies after 1945 have perforce been more impressionistic, as the prolifera- tion of documentary sources and interagency vagaries regarding declassification have compartmentalized much of the historical writing on post-World War II foreign policy. Recent efforts to integrate national security themes and to rescue intelligence history from the espionage buffs should, however, encourage more rigorous bureau- cratic analysis of Cold War policy making.13 When can the perspective be most helpful? Because organizations function most predictably in a familiar environment, major transformations in the international system (wars and their aftermaths, economic crises, the Sino-Soviet split) require the analyst to study how institutional adjustments in United States policies resulted from the changes. Similarly propitious are transitions that bring in new players pledged to reverse the priorities of their predecessors, and particularly administra- tions in which the president, deliberately or not, encourages competition and initia- tive from strong-willed subordinates. Fiascos like the American failure to fend off the attack on Pearl Harbor and the Iran-Contra affair not only force agencies to reassess procedures and programs but also, even better, often spawn official investi- gations that provide scholars with abundant evidence for bureaucratic analysis. Budget battles, weapons procurement, coordination of intelligence, war terinina- tion, alliance politics -in short, any foreign policy that engages the separate atten- tions of multiple agencies and agents should alert the historian to the bureaucratic politics perspective. 11 Ernest R.

Looking at the period through the lens of bureaucratic politics reveals that FDR may have had more than Congress and public opinion in mind when making his famous remark: "it's a terrible thing to look over your shoulder when you are trying to lead - and to find no one there." The institutional aversion to giving commis- sioned naval vessels to a foreign power delayed the destroyers-for-bases deal for sev- eral weeks in the summer of 1940, and only by getting eight British bases in direct exchange for the destroyers could Roosevelt persuade the chief of naval operations, Adm. Harold Stark, to certify, as required by statute, that the destroyers were no longer essential to national defense. According to navy scuttlebutt, the president threatened to fire Stark if he did not support what virtually every naval officer op- posed and the admiral agonized before acquiescing.14 Similarly, the army's initial opposition to peacetime conscription, FDR's dramatic appointment of Henry L. Stimson and Frank Knox to head the War and Navy departments in June 1940, his firing of Adm. James 0. Richardson for his opposition to basing the Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbor, the refusal of the army and navy to mount expeditions to the Azores and Dakar in the spring of 1941, the unvarying strategic advice not to risk war until the armed forces were better prepared -all suggest an environment in which the president had to push hard to get the bureaucracy to accept his policy of supporting the Allies by steps short of war. Even the navy's eagerness to begin Atlantic convoys in the spring of 1941 and the subsequent Army Air Corps strategy of reinforcing the Philippines with B-17s were aimed in part at deploying ships and planes that FDR might otherwise have given to the British and Russians.15 Bureaucratic opposition also revealed itself in leaks. Col. Truman Smith, an intel- ligence officer on the General Staff with close ties to Charles Lindbergh and other isolationists, told former president Herbert Hoover in June 1941 that "no member of the General Staff wants to go to war. . . . Out of fifteen members in his section of the General Staff . . . no one could see any point of our going to war." When the chairman of the America First Committee made a speech the following July predicting the occupation of Iceland while American forces were still at sea, War Department lawyers considered the leak a violation of the Espionage Act of 1917 (even though the landing took place without incident). The more notorious leak of theJoint Army-Navy Board's RAINBOW-5 war plans to the Chicago Tribune just a few days before Pearl Harbor led the Federal Bureau of Investigation to trace the source to someone close to Army Air Corps chief Gen. Henry H. ("Hap") Arnold, 14 For Franklin D. Roosevelt's remark, see John E.

It does affirm, however, that in steering the country toward war in 1940-1941, President Roosevelt could not move any faster than the armed forces were prepared to go. A zigzag course became inevitable. In sum, this essay should be read as a modest plea for greater attention to bureau- cratic politics. The perspective can enrich and complement other approaches. By focusing on internal political processes we become aware of the conflict within government before arriving at the cooperative core values posited by the corporatists or the neo-realists. In its emphasis on individual values and tugging and hauling by key players, bureaucratic politics makes personality and cognitive processes cru- cial to understanding who wins and why.17 Although bureaucratic struggles may be over tactics more than strategy, over pace rather than direction, those distinctions may matter greatly when the outcome is a divided Berlin and Korea, a second atomic bomb, an ABM system that no one really wanted, or the failure of last- minute efforts to avert war in the Pacific. Too easily dismissed as a primer for managing crises that should be avoided, the bureaucratic politics perspective also warns national security managers that when "governments collide," the machines cannot do what they are not programmed to do. Rather than press "delete" and con- ceptualize policy only as rational action, it is incumbent on historians to know how the machines work, their repertoires, the institutional rules of the game, and how the box score is kept. The processes are peculiarly American. The British ambassador Edward Lord Halifax once observed that the foreign policy establishment in Washington was "rather like a disorderly line of beaters out shooting; they do put the rabbits out of the bracken, but they don't come out where you would expect."'18 As historians of American foreign relations, we need to identify the beaters and follow them into the bureaucratic forest because the game is much bigger than rabbit. 16 Hoover, memorandum of conversation with Truman Smith, June 1, 1941, post-presidential individuals files, box 509A, Herbert Hoover Papers (Herbert Hoover Presidential Library, West Branch, Iowa); Grenville Clark to Henry L.
