<plain_text><page sequence="1">791027 Biodynamics of the Living Human Spine During -G Impact Acceleration R. Cheng, N. K. Mital, R. S. Levine, and A. I. King Bioengineering Center Wayne State University Detroit, Ml SPINAL RESPONSE TO -G IMPACT ACCELERATION was quantified by Mital e£ al (1)* recently. Ca- daveric data were provided to demonstrate the relative motion of the spinal segments and the flexibility of the thoracic and lumbar spine. A surrogate spine in the form of a rigid link pinned at both ends was designed for use in a current anthropomorphic test device (ATD) , the Part 572 dummy. The basis for a rigid link was the dual requirement of repeatability and reproducibility in an ATD. These conditions would be difficult to satisfy if a multi-seg- ment spine were used. A preliminary physical model of this surrogate spine was fabricated and tested by Mital et al (2). It was found to perform satisfactorily. Its T1 kinematics relative to the pelvis fell within the corridor of cadaveric data upon which the spine was designed. In this paper, human volunteer data on spinal kinematics are reported. Both male and female subjects participated in this experi- mental test series. It describes the experi- mental instrumentation packages applied to these subjects for consistent data without ^Numbers in parentheses designate References at the end of the paper. discomfort. The data are compared with those obtained from cadaveric tests. METHODS OF PROCEDURE INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD APPROVAL - All procedures involving the use of human subjects were submitted to the Wayne State University Committee on Human and Animal Investigation (the Institutional Review Board for the University) for review and approval. Detailed protocols and assurances were sub- mitted along with the appropriate forms for informed consent. All experiments were carried out within the limitations of the approved procedures and additional tests of procedures required separate approvals from the same board. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN - The objective of this study is to acquire data for the design of an ATD spine which has human-like responses. To achieve this, it is necessary to quantify Living spinal response to -Gx acceleration in terms of the kinematics of selected spinal segments and the kinetics of resistance to flexion and extension. Moreover, a restraint system needs to be specified to protect the ABSTRACT Spinal kinematics of the living human volunteers undergoing -G impact acceleration are described along with the experimental pro- cedures followed to acquire such data. There were 4 male and 3 female volunteers who were subjected to impacts in the tensed and relaxed mode from 2 - 8 g, in 1-g increments. Their lower extremities were tightly clamped to the impact seat and the pelvis was restrained by a lapbelt. The biodynamic response of the living spine is quite similar to that of the cadaveric spine, particularly in terms of T1 displacement, acceleration at T1 and flexural resistance. Female volunteers tend to with- draw from the test program at lower g-levels than males due to transient neck pain. 3557 0096-736X/80/8804-3557$02.50 Copyright © 1980 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">3558 R. CHENG, ET AL. test subject during the impact test. The experimental plan called for 2 modes of restraint. The first is called the clamped mode in which the lower extremities are tightly clamped to the impact seat and the pelvis is restrained by a lap belt. The upper torso is free to flex forward but is protected from impacting the thighs by a cushion placed across the lap. This mode permitted substan- tial flexion of the spine without inordinate risk to the test subject. The second mode utilizes the standard three-point belt system which yields a set of norms for spinal kine- matics that the ATD spine is expected to match. The deceleration pulse shape should be representative of an automotive collision. However, the measurement of spinal resistance to bending requires the sled to be brought to rest as quickly as possible, in this way, a static analysis of seat pan loads and moments results in a resisting moment which can be expressed as a function of spinal flexion. The magnitude of peak deceleration ex- posure is set at 8 g. It can be lower if the volunteer refuses to go on with the test or if it is deemed by the medical officer that the subject should not go on. The first run is to be made at a level of 2 g to acclimate the subject to the acceleration environment. The incremental level is 1 g and at each g-level, the subject makes 2 runs, first with the muscles tensed and then relaxed. SUBJECT SELECTION - All subjects were recruited from a pool of over 50,000 students at Wayne State University. Their age range is from 18 to 25. The primary requirement is good health. Individuals with a history of bone fractures or other injuries are dis- qualified. They can also be disqualified by the examining physician for a variety of pre- existing conditions. The medical examination is scheduled for each volunteer to minimize unnecessary tests in the event that the sub- ject is disqualified during the process. Thus, the x-ray exam is taken last. The medical evaluation consists of the following: 1. Complete history 2. Complete physical 3 . ECG 4. Stress ECG 5. Laboratory tests, including a) SMA 1260 b) Electrolytes c) Complete hemogram d) Urinanalysis 6. Ophthalmologic exam with fundus photography 7. Orthopedic exam 8. X-rays of the skull, spine and chest The subjects were covered by workmen's compensation as they were hired as student assitants and performed other laboratory tasks in addition to volunteering for the sled runs. A medical insurance policy was purchased for the group from the Continental Casualty Insurance Co. as additional protection. INSTRUMENTATION - Accelerometer clusters were mounted on the spinous process of T1 and T12 and on the pelvis. Each cluster consisted of 9 uni-axial accelerometers arranged in the configuration described by Padgaonkar et al (3) for the purpose of measuring three-dimensional linear and angular acceleration. The mounts were custom-made to fit the spinal contours at each vertebral level. They were held onto the spinous process by means of a series of elastic straps and belts. Figure 1 shows the T1 mount which is most complex in design. A cubic photographic target is attached rigidly to the mount. Although it is a 7.6 mm cube, it is extremely lightweight, being made out of Fig. 1 - T1 accelerometer mount for human volunteers</page><page sequence="3">-Gx IMPACT ACCELERATION 3559 urethane foam. Figure 2 shows an instrumented volunteer subject with all mounts attached to his spine. There was photographic coverage from three high-speed cameras placed along 3 orthogonal axes. Other instrumentation included a sled accelerometer and velocity transducer, a six- axis seat pan load cell, an on-board ECG monitor and a time synchronization indicator to match film and transducer data. Belt load cells were used during runs involving the three-point belt restraint system. SLED FACILITY - All runs were carried out on WHAM III (Wayne Horizontal Accelerator Mechanism), a flat bed sled which was slowly accelerated to a speed of 16 to 17 km/h and was made to impact a programmable hydraulic snubber. The deceleration distance varied from 240 mm to 585 mm. Figure 3 shows a sub- ject seated upright in the impact seat and restrained in the clamped mode. The thighs and legs were held firmly to the seat by clamps which could be released rapidly for emergency egress from the sled. A lapbelt was used to prevent excessive lifting of the pelvis. It was found during the cadaveric experiments that femoral fractures occurred without a lapbelt and were prevented by means of a lapbelt. A piece of 140 mm thick urethane foam was placed over the lap as a cushion to prevent excessive spinal flexion and to protect the rib cage. Head contact with the cushion did not occur. Because of the accelerometer mounts on the back of the subject, two pieces of seat belt webbing were used as a seat back. They were positioned to avoid interaction with the tar- gets and mounts. Before each run, at least two responsible investigators, including a physician go through a detailed check-list, as required by the test protocol. An ambulance and crew are required to stand-by for transport of the test subject to a predesignated nearby hospital, in the event of an injury. The emergency ward of the hospital was also notified in advance of the scheduled tests. The snubber length, accumu- lator pressure and all on-board equipment were checked by at least two people. The subject's blood pressure and pulse rate were measured im- mediately before and after each run and at regular intervals. After each series of runs, the subject was asked to report any pain or discomfort to the physician. Such reports were usually received on the following day but they were all minor and short-lived. RESULTS ANTHROPOMETRIC DATA - Table 1 shows the weight, age, sex and sitting height of the seven subjects who participated in this study. There were 3 female subjects and 4 male sub- jects. Data used for the computation of per- centiles were taken from 1962 HEW data (3) . Anthropometric data of interest consist of the Length of the thoracic and lumbo-sacral spines.

CHENG, ET AL. and spinous process of T12 and C7. The volun- teers were measured in a standing position. These dimensions were required to compare the length of the spine of volunteers to the length of the spines of cadavers reported by Mital et al (1). As shown in Table 2, the spine length of volunteers ranged from 440 mm to 592 mm. The mean and standard deviation were 497.7 and 51.3 mm respectively. A normaliza- tion factor was computed by dividing the aver- age length of cadaveric spines by the spine length of the individual volunteers as shown in the last column of Table 2. EXPERIMENTAL RUNS - The volunteer runs were divided in 4 broad groups according to mode and g-level. Runs at 2-4 g (2-3 g for females) were placed in the low-g category and those at 5-8 g (4-8 g for females) were con- sidered as the high-g group. Table 3 sum- marizes the number of runs conducted on each volunteer in different modes and g-levels. The total number of runs was 88 (25 female runs and 63 male runs). There were a total of 36 belted runs (24 male and 12 female) and 52 clamped runs (39 male and 13 female). Approxi- mately half of the clamped runs were conducted with muscles tensed and the other half with muscles relaxed. The data presented in this paper are taken from the clamped runs during which there is substantial spinal flexion and extension and with which cadaveric data from (1) can be com- pared . ACCELEROMETER DATA - During each run, the acceleration of TI , T12 and the pelvis was measured by a nine-accelerometer module. Witłi these data, the acceleration at the origin of a body-fixed anatomical system can be computed. Using the coordinate system defined by Ewing et al (4) for Tl, the resultant acceleration of T1 for runs made at 4-7 g by a male subjecc is shown in Figure 4. A peak acceleration of approximately 20 g is recorded. The angular acceleration and velocity about the lateral or Y-axis at T1 are shown in Figures 5 and 6 re- spectively for these runs by the same volunteer. The axis is normal to the mid-sagittal plane and is positive towards the left. The accelera- tion values are largest about this axis due to the predominately two dimensional motion of the clamped mode. The peak angular accelera- tion is of the order to 700-900 rad/s2 for the 7-g case. Figures 7, 8 and 9 show the data from a parallel sequence of tests for a female volunteer . In terms of data reproducibility, it was found that the corridors for X-axis and Z- axis acceleration (relative to the mount) were quite narrow for each group of runs. The X- axis acceleration at T1 is shown in Figures 10 and 11 for male high-g runs and female low-g runs respectively. There is a similarity in the two negative peaks between these two sets of runs. The Z-axis accelerations are shown in Figures 12 and 13 for the same groups of volunteers. There is again good reproducibil- ity and a characteristic positive peak fol- Tablc 1 - Pertinent Data on Volunteers Body Sitting Volunteer Weight Age Height Bo- (Ktt) (yr«) Sex (- ) Percentile 1454 40.8 22 F 840 30 1156 50.0 24 F 820 U 1760 45.8 18 F 878 60 2953 59.0 23 M 880 30 1555 60.1 21 M 880 30 0159 71.2 19 M 960 92 0252 61.2 24 M 920 55 Table 2 - Anthropometric Data on Volunteer Spines Spinal Length (mm) Volunteer Thoracic Lunbo-sacral Normaliration Bo» C7-T12 T12-Coccyx Total Factor F 1454 245 220 465 1.28 F 1156 280 200 480 1.24 F 1760 300 185 485 1.24 M 2953 265 175 440 1.36 M 1555 321 161 482 1.24 M 0159 370 222 592 1.01 M 0252 280 260 540 1.10 Average Total Length + S.D. ■ 497.9 + 51.3 sn Normalizing Fšctor - *v«rāļ.

FILM DATA - The rotation and displacement of the cubic film target were measured from high-speed film using a Vanguard film analyzer. A computer program analyzed the data and plot- ted the position and rotation ot T 1 , T12 and pelvic target with respect to an inertially- fixed frame or with respect to each other. The data can also be transformed to a speci- fied body fixed reference frame. Figure 16 shows target motion of TI, T12 and the pelvis relative to the inertia! reference frame for a high-g male volunteer run in the tensed mode. Relative displacement data for the same run are shown in Figure 17. Figures 18 and 19 show the data for the same volunteer in the relaxed mode. The motion in the relaxed mode is usually larger than that in the tensed mode for the same g-level.

LOAD CELL DATA - A six axis load cell was used to measure seat pan forces and moments. A typical output of load cell for a high-g female volunteer run is shown in Figures 22 and 23 € The sled-fixed coordinate system was used to define the components of forces and moments measured by this lead cell. Since the impacts were principally 2-dimensional , Fx and F„ in Figure 22 and My in Figure 23 were used in data analysis. It can be seen from these figures that Fy, and are all small. DATA ANALYSIS SPINAL FLEXIBILITY - In order to design a surrogate spine which simulates the kinema- tics of cadaveric spines and volunteer spines, it is necessary to delineate the principal characteristics of vertebral motion during impact. One of the obvious parameters is relative rotation of the targeted vertebra with respect to each other and to the pelvis. The total relative rotation of T1 with respect to T12 was taken to be the algebraic sum of maximum extension and maximum flexion. This represented the total bending of the thoracic spine. A similar rotation was also computed for the lumbar spine; that is the rotation of T12 with respect to the pelvis. A unit rota- tion is defined as the average rotation of each joint required to attain the total rela- tive rotation and is computed by dividing the total rotation by the number of joints in- volved, 6 for the lumbar segment and 11 for the thoracic spine. Data for male volunteer run (stensed and relaxed) are listed in Table 4 and for female volunteer runs in Table 5. RELATIVE ROTATION - Volunteer data of the motion of T1 relative to the pelvis can be com- pared with cadaveric data reported by Mitai et al (1). The corridors in Figure 24 envelope the cadaveric data reported previously. The position plots within the corridors are repre- sentative data taken from a large pool of data. RESISTANCE TO FLEXION - The mathematical formulation to compute the resistance of the spine to flexion was given by Mital et al (1). The free body diagram from computing the re- sisting moment of the spine at the hip joint is reproduced in Figure 25. The expression for the resultant hip joint moment is given by: Mr = My - Fz XL- Fx Z L where , My = seat pan moment about the sled fixed Z-axis Fy and F„ = seat pan loads along the sled fixed X- and Z-axis FL and ZL = moment arms as shown in Fig. 25 Figure 26 shows the resisting moment and its components for a high-g female volunteer run. The corresponding rotation of T1 with respect to pelvis (Angle 0) as a function of time is generated from the film data. A cubic spline</page><page sequence="12">3568 R. CHENG, ET AL.

This cross plot of Mß against 0 shows a curve defining the stifrness of spine and in most cases is a hysteresis Loop which is indicative of energy dissipation. Figure 27 shows several - 0 curves for male volunteer data at different g-levels in the tensed and relaxed modes. Figure 28 shows - 0 curves for female data. The volunteer K curves are all within the unembalmed cadaver curve reported by Mital et al (1). DISCUSSION The Z-axis acceleration corridors shown in Figures 12, 13 and 14 match well with ca- daver data (1). There is similarity in the first positive peak and the second negative peak which occur approximately at the same time. Beyond this time the cadaver torso interacts with the lap cushion and more varia- tion is observed in the cadaver data as com- pared to volunteer data. In most cases, volunteer data showed only 1 or 2 negative peaks. Load cell data for cadaver and volun-</page><page sequence="16">3572 R. CHENG, ET AL.

F„ and My are the major components for force ana moment and are in the order of 6000 N and 700 N-m, as shown in Figures 27 and 28, are comparable to those plotted from cadaver data. The energy dissipated is less due to the lower g-level of impact. In general, it can be observed from these figures that there is more dissipation with increased g-level and in the relaxed mode in comparison with that for the tensed mode. The total relative rotation of the thoracic spine appeared to be generally larger than that of the lumbar spine. However, in terms of the flexibility of the two segments, defined as an average or unit rotation at each vertebral joint (Tables 4 and 5) the lumbar spine is apparently more flexible than the thoracic spine for both male and female sub- jects. As far as cadaver data are concerned, the unit rotation for the thoracic and lumbar segments is comparable for embalmed cadavers. That for the unembalmed cadaver is similar to the data reported for volunteers in this paper. In the relaxed mode, the unit rotation is Larger than that in the tensed mode. Male and female unit rotations are comparable. It should be noted, however, that none of the observed differences were found to be statis- tically significant as determined by the t- cest . The use of a lapbelt to prevent excessive rotation and lifting of the pelvis was the result of cadaveric tests made prior to the human volunteer runs. Bilateral femoral fractures were observed at relatively low g-levels in cadavers due to the excessively high moments applied to the femurs. These moments were reduced by the lapbelt which eliminated femoral fractures up to 20 g. The value of cadaver testing as a prelude to volun- teer testing cannot be overemphasized and should be incorporated in all protocols invol- ving human experiments of this type. Female subjects were more likely to with- draw from the test program than males. Only one of the three females completed an entire sequence of runs up to 8 g. The other two stopped at 4 or 5 g because of transient neck pain. One of the five male subjects was dis- qualified by the medical officer after 2 runs at 2 g. He had a precipitous rise in blood pressure and pulse rate and was visibly in fear. The data from these 2 runs were not reported and he was not considered as one of the sub- jects for this experiment. CONCLUSIONS 1. Spinal kinematics of living human subjects during -G acceleration have been quantified up to 8 g. 2. Displacement data of T1 relative to the pelvis are comparable to those of cadaver runs . 3. There is also a qualitative similar- ity in T1 acceleration between volunteer and cadaver dataã</page><page sequence="19">-Gx IMPACT ACCELERATION 3575 4. Flexural resistance of the spine in human subjects exhibit similar characteristics to that of unembalmed cadavers. There is ap- preciable dissipation of energy. 5. Cadavers are a valuable tool in human volunteer experiments of this kind. They point out possible sources of injury to the volunteer and should be used, if available. 6. Female subjects have a weaker neck musculature and are likely to withdraw from the program before reaching the maximum level of 8 g. the principal reason is transient neck pain.
