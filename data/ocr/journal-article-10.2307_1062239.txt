<plain_text><page sequence="1">David Shulman THE MURDEROUS BRIDE: TAMIL VERSIONS OF THE MYTH OF DEVI AND THE BUFFALO-DEMON The myth of the slaying of the buffalo-demon Mahisasura is the archetypal myth of the goddess in India. Medieval and modern icons of the myth vary in their depiction of the demon: sometimes he is entirely theriomorphic, as in the earliest images we have;' at other times he appears as a human-buffalo hybrid (usually with a human body but the head or horns of a buffalo) or as a man emerging from the neck of a slain buffalo; and at times he is entirely human. Among the first wholly anthropomorphic repre- sentations of Mahisasura is an eighth-century sandstone relief from Kiancipuram (now in the National Museum, New Delhi) in which the demon is shown standing, leaning away from the two- armed goddess who is about to strike him.2 Later the "human" Mahisa becomes quite common; in a Cola bronze from Turaikkatu, for example, Devi is shown seated with her foot resting on the head The author wishes to acknowledge the help received through the British Friends of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem from the Michael and Anna Wix Trust, the Barnett Shine Fellowship, and the John Goodenday Trust.

The closest iconographic analogues to these and similar images are the well-known Tantric icons of Devi dancing on the corpse of her husband, Siva.4 How are we to explain this correspondence? Is it simply by chance that one of the first anthropomorphic figures of Mahisa comes from the Tamil area? D. D. Kosambi has shown that the buffalo-god Mhasoba (Mhatoba) appears in some villages in Maharashtra as the victim of the goddess, while in others he is her consort.5 Parallels to this pattern, felt Kosambi, should exist in other parts of India.6 Such a parallel, which may be relevant to iconographic developments, can be found in the traditions of the Tamil area. Like other areas of India, the south produced its own versions of the classical Hindu myths. The single most important source for these versions is the enormous corpus of literature in Sanskrit and Tamil attached to local shrines. No major shrine is without its mahdtmya or sthalapurana, in which traditions which have grown up around the shrine and its locale have been recorded. Often several such works exist for a single site: for example, Tiruvan- namalai (North Arcot District), the home of one of the most important Tamil versions of the buffalo myth, can claim both a Sanskrit mahdtmya which found its way into the printed editions-of the Skanda Purana7 and a sixteenth-century Tamil work, the Arunacalapuranam of Ellappanayinar. They correspond fairly closely, but such similarity is not always the case. Most Tamil Puranas claim to be based on Sanskrit originals, and in many cases the claim is demonstrably true; but the Tamil versions, like the folk mythology which still exists orally in the area, sometimes preserve ancient elements and motifs more faithfully than the more self-conscious Sanskrit renderings. 3 C.

From the energy (sakti) born from the anger of the gods, Devi became incarnate. The gods bestowed their divine weapons upon her and sent her to do battle with Mahisa. Riding on a lion, she fought with the demon and finally placed her foot on his neck and pierced him with a spear; he half came forth from his own mouth, and the goddess cut off his head and killed him.8 In many of the Sanskrit accounts, the war is preceded by an episode in which Mahisa lusts for the goddess and tries to seduce her; she encourages his desire as a means of weakening him-a classic ploy in Hindu myths.9 Sometimes the battle is described by Devi as a suitor's test: "Hear, 0 Daitya, the bride-price (sulka) in our family.... Whoever conquers a daughter of our family in battle becomes her husband." 10 As we shall see, trial by battle does indeed precede the marriage of Siva and Devi in the myths of several Tamil shrines; but in the case of the classical accounts of the Mahisa myth, Devi uses the idea of a suitor's test simply to lure the demon to his doom. Tamil mythology, however, carries further these hints of an erotic link between Devi and her victim: Siva and Devi quarrelled, made up, then started a game of dice. Suddenly Devi covered the two eyes of her husband with her hands, and the universe was plunged into darkness. 8iva opened his third eye and drenched the worlds with light. Because she had brought untimely disaster on the universe and inter- rupted the rites of sages and ascetics, Devi was afflicted by sin. To expiate her sin the goddess was sent to Kaficipuram. There she made a lihga of sand and worshipped it. To test her, Siva sent a flood, and she embraced the liniga to keep it from being washed away. Siva, pleased with the goddess, directed her to Arunacala, where she continued her tapas in a hut in the forest. The gods found her there and complained to her of the mischief caused by the demon Mahisa: "He takes hold of Adisesa by the head and tail and flings the sleeping Visnu like a rock from a sling; he has stolen Agni's ram; he rides around on Indra's elephant Airavata...." The goddess angrily instructed Durga to kill Mahisa in battle. The war raged around the hut of the goddess at Arunacala; Durga, aided by Arunanayaki, the four saktis, the eight Bhairavas, and the Seven 8 Markandeya Purana, Bibliotheca Indica, vol. 29 (Calcutta, 1862) 82.1-68, 83.1-41 (I have summarized rather than translated myths throughout). 9 Devibhagavata Purana (Benares, 1960) 5.9-11; Brahmavaivarta Purana, Anandasrama Sanskrit Series, no. 102 (Poona, 1935) 2.16-20; Vamana Purana (Benares, 1968) 20.1-36; Devi Purana 13, cited Rajendra Chandra Hazra, Studies in the Upapurdnas, II: iakta and Non-sectarian Upapurdnas (Calcutta, 1963), p. 45. 10 Vamana Purana 20.34. 122</page><page sequence="4">History of Religions Mothers, defeated the demon armies and cut off the head of Mahisa. To her horror and amazement, upon the severed neck of Mahisa she discovered a bright [or, according to the commentary, crystal] linga. Durga brought this linga back to the goddess, but when Devi took it it stuck to her hand. To expiate the sin of killing a devotee of Siva, the god- dess commanded Durga to strike the mountain with her sword; water gushed forth, and Devi bathed in it for a month. Finally the linga dropped from her hand. The goddess then circumambulated the holy mountain, and Siva appeared and granted her request to become the left half of his body.l1 This version makes several radical changes in the myth, trans- forming the characters of Mahisa and the goddess and imparting new values to the mythic action. The killing of Mahisa has become a sin, indeed a sin of a particularly serious kind. In one version Devi is taught by the sage Gautama that it is wrong to harm any living being (jivahimsd na kartavyd)12-an injunction thoroughly exotic in the context of a myth wholly devoted to the violent encounter between the goddess and the demon. The introduction of this strain into the Arunacala myth attests to the enduring influence of Buddhist and Jain ethics on South Indian Hinduism. But there is a more specific reason for Devi's affliction: the heinous nature of her crime stems from the transformation of Mahisa into a devotee (bhakta) of Siva, as shown by the lihga on his neck. At first glance, our version of the myth would seem to fall into the category of myths of dvesabhakti, the "devotion of hate"- the extension of the bhakti idea to include any violent mani- festation of emotion toward the god.13 Thus Sisupala, because he so hated Krsna that he could never keep him from his thoughts whether walking, sitting, eating, or sleeping, wins salvation when killed by the god.14 Similarly, the ogress Piitana, who attempts to poison the infant Krsna, attains heaven after Krsna drains her of life;15 and a host of other demons or enemies of the gods- Gajasura, Taraka, Andhaka, Ravana, Hiranyakasipu, Paundraka, anikhacuda, etc.-are saved and blessed in their death. That love and hatred are intimately related was well known to the creators of Hindu myth. Another Tamil Purana makes it clear that Mahisa benefits from his defeat and death: Devi trod on his head which 1 Arunacalapuranam of Ellappanayinar (Madras, 1907) 4.1-77, 5.1-67; cf. Skanda Purana 1.3.1.3, 1.3. 1.10-13.

If one but thinks of her feet in his heart, all impurity departs and the sorrow of everlasting rebirth comes to an end.16 Elsewhere the salvation of the demon remains implicit: The gods were winning in their war with the demons, so Diti sent her daughter to the forest to give birth to a champion of the demons. The girl took the form of a buffalo and seduced the sage Suparsva, and from their union a son with a buffalo's head was born. He conquered the worlds. Siva, hearing of the distress of the gods, fashioned from the fire of his anger and the anger of the other gods a woman of terrifying splendour. They gave her weapons and a lion to ride and sent her to fight Mahisa in the pdlai forest. After a long battle, the goddess jumped on the demon's head. At this the demon screamed and ran south as fast as he could, with Devi in hot pursuit on her lion. Seeing he could not escape, Mahisa hid in the cakratirtha at Ramesvaram. Devi could not find the demon, try as she might; she was looking back over the path she had taken, facing north, when a voice said, "He is hiding in the tank." Immediately she jumped in with her lion, leaving Mahisa no room to hide. She put one foot on his body and one on his head, and then she cut off his head. With a cry the demon died. Her hosts feasted on his blood, and because her lion had dried up the tank, the goddess caused it to be filled with ambrosia (cutai).17 The sanctity of the tank is marked by both blood (of the demon) and the nectar of the gods-a recurrent symbolic pair in theo origin myths of South Indian shrines. The drying up of the water recalls Agastya's drinking the ocean in order to deny the demons a refuge.18 Yet simply by entering the tank Mahisa may be presumed to have gained what anyone who bathes there is promised- release from sin, the fulfillment of desires, freedom from the cycle of rebirth.19 Seduction by a buffalo-cow explains the birth of Mahisa in Sanskrit Puranas as well,20 but other Tamil versions agree on a different explanation: Varamuni was cursed by other sages, angered by his lack of courtesy, to become a buffalo and to be freed by dying at the hands of the goddess. While wandering in the forest in the form of a buffalo, he once swallowed a sage who carried a liiga in his hand; that liitga remained attached to his neck.21 Death at the hands of his enemy is thus the condition for Mahisa's liberation. Yet this myth does not belong to the classic 16 Tirunelvelittalapuranam of Nellaiyappapillai (Tirunelveli, 1869) 52.110. 17 Cetupuranam of Nirampavalakiyatecikar (Madras, 1932) 6.1-78; Skanda Purana 3.1.6.8-77, 3.1.7.1-48. 18 Mahabharata 3.102.16-23, 3.103.1-28. 19 Cetupuranam 6.82; Skanda Purana 3.1.7.47-48, 63-64. 20 Vamana Purana 18.41-72; Devibhagavata Purana 5.2.17-50; Kalika Purana (Bombay, 1891) 62.136-57. 21 Arunacalapuranam 5.46-49; Tirunelvelittalapuranam 52.112-16. 124</page><page sequence="6">History of Religions type of dvesabhakti myths, for Mahisa is freed not because he obsessively hates the god or goddess, as in the cases of Piitana and Sisupala, but simply by virtue of being killed by Devi. If anything, Mahisa appears to feel devotion for Siva, and the horror felt by Durga at the discovery of the linga stems from the sense of having killed not an enemy but an ally. In fact, this idea goes con- siderably deeper. Mahisa as bearer of the liiga is said to partake of Siva's own form (iraiyuruvam;22 annon meyyum accivan ran rapam23), and it is the murder of Siva himself which is implicitly attributed to Devi. This is perhaps the most suggestive strand of myth in the Tamil versions and the one most closely linked with the religious prehistory of the area. Truly ancient material has been preserved in a more modern guise: the buffalo-god has become a demon, while his essential identity with the male consort of the goddess is affirmed. Another Tamil myth transfers Devi's attack on her husband to a later stage: Mahisa was granted a boon by Brahma to the effect that no god could kill him. He destroyed the sacrifices of the sages, injured temples and tanks, and committed other misdeeds. King Ciiriyavanni pleaded with Siva to help, so Siva looked at Devi and said: "Take the form of Durga and go down to earth with the Seven Maidens in order to destroy Mahisa." Devi went to Arunacala and challenged the demon to a fight. He at first refused to fight a woman. "If you are a man, come and show your mettle," she said. After a long battle, she stood on his head and cut it off with her sword. After the death of the demon, the goddess was followed by Brahminicide. She worshipped Siva at Ratnagiri (Tiruvatpokki), and Siva gave her a sword with which to rid herself of the sin, but she did not know how to use it. "Split the mountain in two," said Siva. She struck the mountain with the sword; it split in two, and her sin departed. The goddess lives there still as Khadga (Tam. Katkai-"The Sword").24 Although Mahisa is portrayed as wholly sinful, killing him is still a sin. Precisely the same idea is developed in the myths of Indra's slaying of the denion Vrtra and subsequent torture by Brahmini- cide;25 like Vrtra, the demon Mahisa has become a Brahmin. The water which cleanses sin is missing in the myth from Tiruvatpokki, but the redemptive act remains the same as at Arunacala- cleaving the mountain with a sword. Yet here the image is more complex: splitting the mountain unites the divine couple, for Devi is the sword (khadga), and the mountain, as we are told 22 Arunacalapuranam 5.49. 23 Tirunelvelittalapuranam 52.116. 24 Tiruvatpokkippuranam of Kamalainakar Vaittinatatecikar (Madras, 1911) 10.1-45. 25 Cf.

Note the reversal of roles: usually it is Devi who must split in two before marriage, casting off her dark "sheath" (Kausiki or Kali) in order to emerge as the golden Gauri;27 here the god is divided, while the goddess rather than Siva has the form of the phallic sword. The split goddess is evident in the first version we have cited, from Tiruvannamalai, where Devi sends Durg&amp; along with other forms of herself to perform the killing-although Devi must still pay the price of expiation herself. Devi's sinfulness is symbolized by the liiga which sticks to her hand, an image obviously derived from the story of Siva's Brahminicide: Siva cut off one of Brahma's five heads; the skull (kapala) stuck to his hand as he wandered over the earth pursued by Brahminicide, until he reached the Kapala- mocana shrine in Benares.28 At Arunacala Devi is released from the liiga in order to marry Siva, thus creating the androgyne; the conjunction of episodes is not accidental, for the goddess in fact marries twice-first, symbolically, the dead demon and then, officially, the living god. The myth has distributed aspects of a single event between two male protagonists. The underlying tendency is to suppress the murderous aspect of Devi's marriage; and in yet another version, the dark murderess remains chaste so that the golden goddess can wed: The goddess killed Durga29 and was followed by sin. Siva said to her: "It seems you do not realize that you have acquired a new form by killing the wicked demon. Go, Nili, and perform tapas." Painniili went to Vimal- aranya and worshipped Siva in her fierce, dark form. Suddenly the Vimalaranya River rose like the sea and surged towards the mountain where Siva dwells. The goddess blocked its path. She pressed her foot against the earth, and at her command the river entered the nether world at that spot. The gods and sages then complained that no river was present at the shrine. Paififiili shot an arrow to the north of the golden shrine of Uma; the arrow pierced the mountain and a river-the Nilivan- anadi-poured forth. The goddess created the town of Tiruppainnili with its ramparts and palaces, and with a shrine where Siva and Uma could happily dwell.30 26 In carukkam 11, for example, a puranikar recites to a king, stressing that the mountain is the body of the Lord. The king is ordered to climb the mountain, but fears to tread on the body of the god. 27 ~iva Purana (Benares, 1964) 7.1.24.24-58; 7.1.25.1-48; 7.1.27.1-37; Skanda Pura.na 1.2.29.45-52; cf.

He is, of course, to be distinguished from the goddess Durga. 30 Tiruppaiiiiilipuranam (Madras, 1927) 4.1-23. 126</page><page sequence="8">History of Religions Like nearly all South Indian shrines, Tiruppaififiili is said to have survived a flood; here this ancient cosmogonic motif is associated with the dark goddess Paififiili (Green-Dark Blue), to whom we shall return later. The goddess first saves the god by diverting the flood, then wounds him by piercing his mountain with an arrow, just as she cleaves the body of the god at Tiruvatpokki. The sacred water of the river substitutes for the blood of the slain god, which other myths retain as the fertilizing blood of the demon. The tapas of Paiiiiili creates a home for 8iva and Uma; the killing of Mahisa is thus the prerequisite for the local marriage of the peaceful aspect of the goddess. The identification of Siva and Mahisa is-at its most explicit in a myth from the Kalika Purina: Ugracanda killed Mahisasura in one of his births, and Bhadrakali killed him in a second. In his third birth as a buffalo, he had a dream in which he saw the goddess drinking his blood after cleaving his head with her sword. When he woke, he worshipped the goddess and told her of his dream, and he also told her that he had been cursed by Katyayana to be killed by a woman, since he had distracted a pupil of that sage with a beautiful image of a woman. Mahisa asked the goddess for two boons: a share in the sacrifice, and the joy of never departing from her feet. She said: "The sacrifice has already been divided among the gods, and there is no portion left; but I grant you your second wish." Then she struck him and cut off his head. When he beheld his own buffalo-body pierced by the trident and spurting forth blood, he was very frightened, and he cried to her: "If the portions of the sacrifice have already been assigned, let me be killed at another time, and may I never quarrel with the gods." She replied: "I granted your former wish, and now you must be killed. You will not quarrel with the gods, and since you have touched my feet, your body will not be shattered and you will have a share of the sacrifice." 31 The exclusion from the sacrifice and the struggle to obtain a share are classic Saiva themes, the underlying basis of the Daksa myth (along with the associated theme of punishment of incest). But the Purana then proceeds to make the implicit correspondence of 8iva and Mahisa explicit, for the listener (Sagara) asks: Many demons have been killed by the goddess Maya without receiving boons; why did this demon receive a boon? The narrator (Aurva) replies: Mahisa was granted his wish because he was giva. The demon Rambha propitiated Siva, and the god promised that he would become his son in three births. Rambha saw a buffalo-cow (mahisi) and made love to it; that buffalo-cow was Siva, who gave birth to himself as Mahisa. This happened in three separate births. Therefore the goddess accepted Mahisa, who was Mahadeva himself.32 31 Kalika Purana 62.84-164. 32 Ibid., 62.136-57. 127</page><page sequence="9">The Murderous Bride Siva as the buffalo is also said to have become the vdhana of the goddess, for Visnu as lion was incapable of carrying her.33 Van Kooij rightly notes that the point of this statement is to stress the fierce character of the goddess, for the buffalo is usually the vehicle of Yama, who rules the dead.34 For the same reason, the myth of Devi's killing of Mahisa has been interpreted as a Sikta parallel to Siva's destruction of Death (Siva as Kalantaka, Mrtyufijaya).35 This interpretation finds no support in the myth. It is not enough, however, merely to document the correspon- dence between Siva and the buffalo-demon Mahisa in a number of localized versions of the myth. Difficult questions remain: Why the buffalo? What does the myth mean? Note that a striking reversal occurs in Devi's role: we are accustomed to think of the goddess as providing the god with power (sakti); but, if our reading is correct, in the buffalo myth she drains the god of his strength. Surely this is the significance of the closely related (though later) icons which show K&amp;li treading on the corpse of Siva, her tongue thrust out to receive his blood.36 In the village rituals of the south, the blood of the sacrificial victim-often a buffalo-is drunk precisely in order to transfer its strength to the participants. The ritual of buffalo sacrifice is undoubtedly an underlying force in the Mahisa myth. In village sacrifices a special role is reserved for the buffalo's severed head, which may be offered to the goddess, carried in procession, or utilized in connection with boundary rites;37 in the Tamil myths, Devi stands on the demon's head as she decapitates him, and she discovers the crystal linga on his neck. Let us recall that in the Devimdhdtmya the demon is said to have been killed while half-emerging from his own mouth.38 The liiga on the neck appears in the southern versions as a symbol of Mahisa's life and power, just as it suggests his true identity; similarly, in a myth from Andhra Skanda is able to overcome Taraka only by smashing the liga the demon wears upon his throat.39 By taking the liiga Devi thus draws to herself the 33 Ibid., 62.153. 34 K.

Moreover, the buffalo is itself a symbol of power in the earliest Tamil sources. Attached to the poetry of war we find the theme of erumaimaram, Buffalo's Valor, exemplified by the hero who takes a bold stand in battle against a flood of enemies and weapons which threatens to overwhelm him.40 Village and tribal rituals, and the myths which grew up around them, would thus appear to have preserved a more ancient image of the buffalo-which Brahminism has demoted in favor of the present "great-tradition" focus on the cow and the bull.41 The male god in many South Indian villages is still often a Buffalo King (Potu Raja in the Telugu area and parts of Tamil Natu). Sometimes he is the husband of the goddess.42 In the sacrificial rituals a buffalo is married to the goddess, and after the sacrifice the wedding ceremony is repeated with a new buffalo, lest she be left a widow.43 The sacrifice of the goddess's consort then has to be explained by a myth: A Paraiyan passed himself off as a Brahmin in a foreign village and was given the daughter of a blind karnam (accountant) as his wife. The Brahmin wife discovered by chance that her husband was an Outcaste, so she burned herself alive by setting fire to her house. After her death she appeared as a goddess to the villagers and instructed them to behead her husband, put one of his legs in his mouth, the fat of his stomach on his head, and a lighted lamp on top. After being sacrificed in this manner, the husband was reborn as a buffalo, and therefore a buffalo is sacrificed to the village goddess at ceremonies in which the descendants of the couple play a part.44 Unlike the Puranic accounts, this myth attaches sin not to the goddess but to her husband-victim, whose murder is thereby rationalized. The blindness which causes Devi's descent to earth in the first place in the Tamil Mahisa myths is here ascribed not to her husband but to her father. This plot motif is the final element of the Mahisa myths which calls for comment in this context. It is by no means limited to these myths-in fact, the blinding of the god is seemingly the most frequently encountered cause for Devi's avatdra in South 40 See Purapp6rul venpamalai of Aiyanaritanar (Madras, 1955) 139 (tumpaip- patalam 13); Purananuru, ed.

Given the phallic symbolism of eyes in Saivism-especially of the third eye, which, as we shall see, is linked with the South Indian motif of the third breast-blindness may be regarded as substituting for castra- tion in some of these stories.54 The myth of Cyavana and Sukanya lends support to this correspondence: Cyavana was performing tapas in an anthill; Sukanya, the daughter of king Saryati, saw his eyes glowing from within the anthill and pierced them with a thorn.

The Asvins tried to make her leave her old, blind husband for one of them, but when she stood fast by her husband they took him into the water, and he emerged young- his sight and his virility simultaneously restored.55 Elsewhere blindness is linked with death: devotees of Bhagavati walk to her temple in Kallil with their eyes shut tight, for they die if they see anything before they see the goddess.56 More common is the reverse: all who beheld the carving of the goddess in the K6lli hills were certain to die.57 A myth from Assam applies this motif to the head sacrifice, a characteristic feature of Devi-myths:58 At the time of the evening prayer, the goddess danced within the closed doors of her temple. A king desired to see her dance and asked the chief priest to help him. The priest made a hole in the wall, and the king peeped through. His eyes caught the eyes of the goddess, and she became furious and tore off the head of the priest. Ever since the king and his descendants never look even at the hill of the goddess; if they must pass by it, they cover themselves with umbrellas.59 The penalty is transferred from the king to the priest, but it retains its force as a threat to the king's offspring. The punishment is incurred by the king's attempt to overcome a form of blindness- his inability to see the goddess-and to achieve this he must destroy the wholeness of the goddess's protective enclosure. Why does seeing the goddess entail punishment? The motif may be linked to the prohibition on witnessing the sexual act, a theme of considerable importance in Hindu mythology. Thus Ila (Sudyumna) is transformed from a man into a woman (i.e., castrated) for stepping into a grove in which Siva had been making love to Parvati. The real cause of this transformation is put back in time and transferred to a group of sages: Sanaka and other sages came upon Siva and Parvati while they were making love in that grove; Parvati was ashamed and hastily covered her nakedness, and Siva promised that from then on any man who entered the grove would become a woman.60 There are many 55 Mahabharata 3.122.1-27, 3.123.1-23; Devibhagavata Purana 7.2.30-65, 7.3.1-64, 7.4.1-56, 7.5.1-57. 56 N.

While he was supervising the completion of the kalydnamandapa, the king returned and found his treasury empty. The king ordered that the treasurer be blinded in punish- ment, and, being a loyal servant, the man dashed out his eyes on the spot. The stains from his eyes are still evident on the wall near the unfinished kalydnamandapa; hence the village is known as Lepaksi-"Blinded Eye" (literally, "eyes of the staining").66 The appropriation of a king's treasures by a devotee of the god who uses them for pious purposes is a common motif.67 Yet it is hardly by chance that the treasurer is blinded while constructing the kalydnamandapa, the site of the wedding of the god and his consort. The union of the divine couple is not to be witnessed, even by their devotees.68 61 Abbe J. A. Dubois, Hindu Manners, Customs and Ceremonies, trans. and ed. Henry K. Beauchamp, 3d ed.

Here physical blindness punishes failure to perceive the sanctity of union (of men and women rather than of gods); the reversal of human and divine is sustained by Bil'am's attempt to project blindness on to God. 132</page><page sequence="14">History of Religions The myth from Assam has taken this idea a step further, for here it is the erotic goddess alone who must not be seen. She dances without a consort within the confines of her shrine; and, although our version of the myth fails to state this plainly, we may deduce that here, as in several South Indian shrines,69 the source of her attraction-and her power-is her virginity, which must not be defiled even by sight. One way to safeguard her virginity and at the same time to circumscribe the terrible energy she derives from it is to lock her in an invulnerable enclosure. The bolted doors of the sanctuary may themselves symbolize her virginity, as in the earliest Tamil love poetry, where the lover must break down the locked door of his beloved.70 For it is the virgin goddess who is the true siren, seductive, powerful, dangerous. The god who desires her must face the threat of death at her hands; in the end, either he dies-as in the myth of Mahisa and in several of the folk variants from other shrines-or he tames his fearful bride.71 The choice of the motif of blinding as the introduction to the Mahisa myth now seems more intelligible. There is no reason to believe its use here was an accident; in effect, the Tamil versions have prefixed a weakened multiform of the myth to a rendering characterized by the survival of archaic elements. It remains to outline the permutations of the components of the myth as isolated in our analysis. In particular we will briefly trace the theme of the locked sanctuary of the goddess, which the folk tradition knows as the sealed shrine of the dangerous Kali. This image provides an important clue to understanding the myths of the main goddess of Maturai, Minaksi, who, as we shall see, may be directly linked with the murderess of Mahisa from Tiruvannamalai. The image of the locked shrine may be traced back in Tamil to the classical epic, the Cilappatikaram: A Brahmin was unjustly thrown into prison in the Pantiya land, so the goddess Aiyai would not open the doors of her temple. The king investigated the matter and made amends, and the heavy doors of the shrine 69 Cf.

Song of Songs 4:12. 71 Note that Kamakhya, the erotic goddess who dances within the closed doors of her shrine in Assam, is pictured standing on the corpse of Siva when it is time for love (kama) (Kalika Purana 60.58, and cf. the buffalo-myth from this text above). 133</page><page sequence="15">The Murderous Bride opened with a noise heard throughout the streets of ancient Kutal (Maturai).72 The closing of the shrine is also associated with a miscarriage of justice in the story of one of the most violent of all Tamil goddesses: A Brahmin squandered his wealth on a dancing girl in KSnici, neglecting his wife. When he ran out of funds, he coveted the ornaments belonging to his wife; he coaxed her to come with him from her parents' home to Kanici, and on the way he killed her and the child in her womb by pushing her into a well. On his way to hide the jewels he had taken from her, a serpent bit him and he died. The Brahmin was reborn as a merchant with a magic sword to protect him from all evil. Parvati took the form of Nili, a demoness roaming the forest of Alaiikatu, in order to take revenge for the murder of his wife. Although advised never to go north, the merchant went to Palaiyanur to buy jewelry, leaving his wife in the forest when she grew tired on the way. Nili made his wife reveal the name of her husband and, armed with this information, appeared before a court of seventy Velalas in Palaiyanur to lay claim to the man as her husband. She convinced them of her identity by uttering his name, but the merchant knew her for a demoness determined to take his life. "No wife of mine would thus utter my name," he cried in despair to the Velalas; and, since the sun was setting and no decision had yet been reached, they locked the couple up in the temple of Kali for the night, having first made the merchant relinquish his magic sword to Nili, and having signed a document giving their own lives as surety for his. Nili killed the merchant and escaped by way of the gopura. When the Velalas came to the temple in the morning, they were unable to open the door. They prayed to Kali; suddenly the door opened, and inside they found the disembowelled body of the merchant. Nili took the form of an old woman claiming to be the merchant's mother; the Velalas were forced to produce the document they had signed, and, true to their word, all seventy entered the fire.73 Nili, a dark goddess like Paiiniili of the Mahisa myth, is locked in her temple by the community rather than locking herself in, although the Velalas are unable to open the door in the morning without the aid of Kali/Nili. The stimulus is an act of injustice, and the closing of the doors brings revenge-at the distance of a generation from the crime. There is a link with the appearance of this theme in the Cilappatikaram, for mention there of the closing of the temple of Aiyai is immediately followed by the story of the curse of Nili, the wife of a man unjustly killed in the presence of the king of Kaliiga; Nili cursed the perpetrator of the deed to suffer the same fate in a future birth.74 Hence, according to this passage, the events narrated in the Cilappatikaram: 72 Cilappatikaram 23.99-125. 73 Priyapuranam of Cekkilar (Madras, 1916) 4.5.3; Cekkilarpuranam of Um&amp;pati Civacariyar (in the same volume) verse 15; Tirufiianacampantar- tevaram (Tarumapuram, 1953) 1.45.1 (with commentary); cf. the modern retellings by Cnici Ekamparamutaliyar, Nilikatai (Madras, 1922), passim; and Aru.

After a quarrel with Matavi, Kovalan returned penniless to his wife. Together they set out for Maturai, where Kovalan hoped to sell Kannaki's anklet (cilampu). A goldsmith who had stolen a similar anklet belonging to the Pantiya queen accused Kovalan of the theft; the Pantiya king believed his false testimony and ordered Kovalan's execution. Kannaki, learning of his death, came to the court of the king and proved his innocence. The king died of grief at the injustice he had committed. Then the furious Kannaki tore off her left breast and hurled it at the ancient city of Maturai, and the city was destroyed by fire. Kovalan is identified by the epic with the murderer of Cafikaman, the husband of Nili, by whose curse he was forced to undergo the same punishment. There are other close similarities between the story of the epic and the myth of Palaiyanur Nili: both share the motif of a husband's impoverishment by a prostitute; in both the husband dies as he is disposing of his wife's jewelry, and false accusations are believed with fatal consequences.75 There is also a Jain story about yet another Nili, again in a South Indian source. Here Nili is a chaste wife falsely accused by her (Buddhist) husband; she proves her chastity with the help of a friendly devatd, who closes the gates of the city and informs the king in a dream that only a chaste woman will be able to cause them to open; Nili, alone among the women of the city, is able to pass through the gates.76 The locking of the temple of the goddess is replaced in the Jain story by the sealing of the city gates. Nili, or Nilakeci,77 was the ancient goddess of Palaiyanur near Tiruvalafikatu. Her shrine is still referred to as the milasthdna, the original center of worship, by the priests of the Siva temple there. Her name was apparently so closely linked with violence that the tenth-century Jain author of the book Nilakeci chose her to represent an extreme example of successful conversion: When a Jain sage persuaded people to stop offering blood sacrifices to Kali, that goddess called upon Nilakeci of the south to act against him-but Nilakeci was herself converted to ahimsd! 78 The Jain polemical poet clearly wanted to present as striking a success story as possible. For our purposes here it is important to note that it is as 75 For a discussion of the parallels between the two stories, see K. P. S.

In other myths from this site, the conflict is between Nili and Siva, who overcomes the dangerous, destructive goddess by challenging her to a dance contest; Siva wins by the unfair trick of thrusting one leg straight into the sky while continuing to dance-a position which Nili is supposedly too modest to imitate.79 The fierce goddess of Palaiyanur must be tamed by her husband.80 In a hagiographical variant of this myth, the ancient demoness (pey) of this region is identified with Karaikkalammaiyar who, as a withered, skeletal devotee of Siva, is the eternal witness to his dance.81 The closing of the Kali shrine is one variety of a basic type of myth in which the dangerous goddess or woman is shut into a container. Thus the goddess Kulumayiyamman committed such atrocities that her worshipers put her in a box and dropped her in the Kaveri;82 Saflkara is said to have thrown the goddess of Tiruvorriyuir into a well;83 Durga was set adrift on the river in an iron box which miraculously did not sink;84 a Brahmin caused a Paraiya girl he was fated to marry to be shut in a box and floated down the river after having a nail driven into her head.85 Alli, the Amazon Queen of Maturai, was caught in a tiger's cage by Sahadeva during her war against the Pandavas; thus trapped, she was forced to become Arjuna's bride.86 According to a Telugu folk version of the Rdmdyana, Sita was born in a lotus pond in Lanka and discovered by Ravana; the astrologers predicted that the city would be destroyed if Sita remained there, so the child-goddess was locked in a box and pushed into the sea.87 Shutting the goddess in a container is one solution to the 79 Tiruvalankattuppuranam (Madras, 1864) 10-14. The dance contest forms the central episode of this Purana. See also Tirukkfvappuranam of Turaimaikalam Civappirakacacuvamikal (Madras, 1908), 7:242-75; Arthur F. Cox (rev. Harold A.

Often, however, the motif is reversed, as in the following folktale from Ramnad District: The king of Tevai had a son named Subuddhi and his minister had a son named Durbuddhi. The two boys were close friends, although the prince believed that "Virtue alone conquers," while the minister's son's motto was "Evil alone conquers." While they were still boys, Durbuddhi exacted a promise from his friend that if he ever married, Durbuddhi would have the right to spend a night with his wife. One day the lads followed a deer deep into the forest. There, by the side of a tank, Durbuddhi tore out his friend's eyes, filled the sockets with sand, and ran away. Subuddhi crawled to the far side of the tank, where he discovered by touch the entrance to a temple of Kali. He entered the shrine and locked the door behind him. When KSli returned to find herself locked out of her own temple, she threatened to kill the usurper. Subuddhi refilsed to allow her entrance until she restored his sight; having no choice, she finally agreed. After some months Kali sent the prince to the kingdom of the KSveri, whose princess she had stricken with smallpox and blinded because the king had lapsed in his devotion to the goddess. With KSli's aid Subuddhi cured the princess and married her. Years later Durbuddhi happened to come to the Kaveri kingdom; the prince forgave him and made him his minister, but Durbuddhi once again plotted against him, slandering him to the old king. The king believed Durbuddhi and ordered the execution of his son-in-law and his daughter. Learning of this, Durbuddhi hastened to claim his right to spend a night with his friend's wife, before the opportunity passed forever; but the princess substituted her foster-sister for herself, and by mistake the king's executioners killed Durbuddhi and the surrogate- bride.88 Kali is locked out of rather than into her shrine, but the opening of the doors still leads to the restoration of vision and the consum- mation of a marriage-and thus our interpretation of the sym- bolism is supported. Note the doubling of the blinding/restoration sequence, which applies to both Subuddhi and his bride. Note, too, the motif of the Liebestod: Durbuddhi dies through satisfying his lust. In another tale, a prince wins the Pomegranate Maiden by the same device used by Subuddhi: he enters Kali's shrine by night, while the goddess is out wandering in the forests, and locks the door; when she returns at sunrise, she has to promise to help him before he will let her in.89 The dark, virgin goddess is forced to provide her devotee with a bride. Yet in one crucial point the folktale deviates from the myth- by failing to identify the dark goddess herself as the bride. The 88 S. M.

Where, then, do the archaic strands of myth survive? Sometimes the hints retained in the Puranic versions can be elucidated with the help of the remarkably conservative substratum of popular variants-the living, usually unexplored folk versions of the myths. Let us look, for example, at one such version of the goddess myth from Maturai: Once the wicked, arrogant Pant.iya king closed the temple of Minatciyam- man, the local goddess. Enraged, the goddess took the form of a child wearing a bracelet exactly like one which belonged to the queen. The king found the child in the palace and wished to adopt her, but the astrologers warned that evil would result, so she was put in a basket and cast into the river. She was fished out by a merchant, who named her Kannaki and brought her up. Siva became incarnate as a merchant from Kavirippumpat- tinam; hearing of the girl's mysterious origin, he married her. He became poor and, ignoring his wife's pleas, went to Maturai to sell her bracelet; some days before this, the queen had lost her bracelet, and the merchant was therefore accused of stealing it, brought before the king and executed. Kannaki learned of his fate and came to Maturai to take revenge; assuming the form of Durga, she killed the king. "Since then she has been wor- shipped by the people. The slaughter of the Pandian created in her a desire for bloodshed, and she is now a deity whom it is thought prudent to propitiate." 90 The locked enclosure of the goddess appears twice, first as the closed temple of Minaksi, then as the basket in which the infant is sent down the river; other versions substitute a golden box for the basket, possibly through the influence of the important motif of the golden seed in a pot.91 The locking of the shrine has become a prelude to a truncated version of the Cilappatikaram story 92--and Minaksi, the goddess of Maturai, is equated with the epic heroine Kannaki, who takes the form of Durga.93 The first victim of Minaksi-Kannaki's plan of revenge is none other than Siva, who has become Kannaki's earthly husband (Kovalan). So, indirectly, the goddess kills her consort-but let us go a step at a time. The slaying of Kovalan-Siva is doubled in other folk versions. In addition to his execution for allegedly stealing the anklet (or 90 Whitehead, pp. 112-13 (my summary). 91 M. Frere, Old Deccan Days (London, 1870), pp. 252-53; cf. Brenda E. F.

For the golden-seed motif (which is an important element of the origin myths of many Tamil shrines), see O'Flaherty, pp. 107-8. 92 See summary above. 93 Kannaki is identified with Durga already in the Arumpatavurai on Cilap- patikaram 12.47-48 (referring to her description as konka ccelvi). 138</page><page sequence="20">History of Religions bracelet), there is a similar episode which serves to introduce the story: An oil merchant vowed to light a lamp for Kali with a pot of oil if he managed to sell 999 pots of oil. He succeeded in selling the required number, but he discovered the Kali temple locked by the king because his wife had been childless for twelve years. The doors were not to be opened, on pain of death. Because of his vow, the merchant went in anyway to light the lamp; consequently, both he and his wife were beheaded before the goddess by royal command. The king's wife then became pregnant-Kali herself placed the seed in her womb. The oil merchant was reborn as Kovalan, and his wife was born as Matavi.94 Once again death (by beheading!) is the penalty for opening the shrine of the goddess and for lighting her lamp (i.e., for conquering blindness/darkness). The slain oil merchant is identified with Kovalan, the next victim, whom these versions also associate with 8iva.95 This episode, built around the pattern of the intrusion into the inviolable sanctuary, thus strengthens our suspicion that an older level of myth is involved. But this is not all. The king locks the goddess out for a reason other than simple pride or jealousy (which explains his action in Whitehead's account): Kali has refused him offspring from his wife.96 Although the king's act is ostensibly hostile to the goddess, in effect he overcomes the curse of barrenness by sacrificing the oil merchant to Kali. There is a precedent for his action in the uraiperukatturai, which was prefixed to the Cilappatikaram by an anonymous editor. There sacrifice to Kannaki releases not seed but rain: The Pantiya kingdom was stricken by drought, famine, fever and plague; King Verriverceliyan pacified (cdnti ceyya) the Lady (nankai, i.e. Kannaki) with the sacrifice of a thousand goldsmiths, and rain came.97 The Pantiya king is clearly a pivotal figure in the folk versions of the Maturai myth; it is by his orders that the oil merchant and Kovalan are killed, while he himself remains the final and principal victim of the goddess's revenge. It is in this light that we must note the myth of Minaksl's marriage as recorded in the "official" Puranic accounts from Maturai: The king of Maturai had no children. He performed 99 horse-sacrifices, and Indra, alarmed lest he be driven from heaven, advised the king to 94 Beck, pp. 26-27; Kovalankatai, ascribed to Pukalenti (Madras, 1914), pp. 4-7. 95 Specifically with C6kkecar, Siva as worshipped at Maturai, the husband of Minaksi (Kovalankatai, pp. 7 and 8; Beck, p. 27). 96 See the destruction of Ganesa's shrine for the same reason by Divodasa, King of Kasi: Brahmanda Purana (Delhi, 1973) 3.67.28-64. 97 Cilappatikaram, uraiperukatturai 1; cf. 27.127-30. 139</page><page sequence="21">The Murderous Bride perform a sacrifice to obtain a son. The sacrifice was carefully executed according to the rules, but to the amazement of all a girl with three breasts appeared instead of the longed-for son. "What have I done wrong?" cried the king; "all my enemies will laugh when they hear of the third breast on this girl." A voice from heaven reassured him: "Perform all the ceremonies as if she were a son. Her breast will disappear when she finds her husband." The girl was brought up as if she were a boy and, when her father died, she ascended the throne, to the delight of the fierce goddess whose spear seeks the flesh of enemies. She set out to conquer the world. Having over- come several armies, she came with her troops to Kailasa. The army of giva fought with her and began to lose. Siva himself took the field of battle. As soon as she caught sight of him, her third breast disappeared and, overcome with modesty, innocence and shyness, she began to scrape the ground shyly with her toe. One of the attendants who remembered the voice from heaven which had spoken at her birth approached her and said: "Lady, this man is your bridegroom." The princess took Siva to Maturai and married him there, and they reigned as Minaksi and Cuntarapa.ntiyan.98 The goddess is emphatically said to have preceded the god in Maturai; indeed, she attracts him to the site, which is her home and kingdom. Here, as in the traditions of other Tamil shrines, the chthonic, ancient character of the goddess is proclaimed. It is significant that Minaksi discovers her husband in battle. By marriage she is transformed from a violent multiform of Korravai, the goddess of war, into a gentle wife, just as Nili of Tiruvalaikatu is tamed by the dance.99 And it is as the Pdntiya king that Siva is the husband of Minaksi. Here, then, is the missing link with the folk versions of the myth, which have conflated Siva's role as Pantiyan with his identification with Kovalan, the slain protagonist of the epic. Siva as Pantiyan dies for locking the sanctuary, while as oil merchant he dies for entering it. Again the male is split and his role distributed, as in the buffalo myth from Tiruvannamalai- but here all suffer the same fate. Still we may ask why the folk variants never explicitly identify the king with Siva, since after all the Pantiyan remains the direct object of Kali's wrath. Two partial answers may be suggested. In the first place, the Puranic myths of Minaksi and Siva-Cuntarapantiyan, which supply Siva's role as king of Maturai, always end with the defeat of the goddess by her divine spouse; historically this description may be 98 Tiruvilaiyatarpuranam 4.1-42, 5.1-44. 99 See above. The process of transformation from violent goddess to docile wife or mother is attested at other shrines; sometimes the goddess is known as Santa- nayaki or Santagunanayaki (as at Tiruvettakkuti, Tirumayilatuturai, etc.). The change may be effected by adorning her with golden earrings (Tiruvanaikka), drawing the sricakra at her feet (Kfaci), stationing her sons in her sight (Bhagavati of Kerala), shading her with trees (Kannaki-Pattini [cf. Cilappatikaram 28.218- 21]), or, perhaps most frequently, by the dance. 140</page><page sequence="22">History of Religions accurate, but the folk versions of the myth prefer the older image of the slaying of the god, as in the Mahisa cycle. Hence the identity of Siva and the king remains implicit; the Puranic reworking of the myth has itself affected the folk versions. In addition, the popular accounts have drawn from the recorded tradition that Minaksi was the anomalous daughter of the Pantiya king. However we may interpret the insertion of a local goddess into the royal lineage of Maturai, the result in the folk tradition is that Minaksi murders her father, not her husband. One distant offshoot of the Minaksi myth in fact describes the anomalous princess as threatening both father and husband: In Madhupura on the northern trade-route, there was born to a king a daughter with three breasts. The Brahmins warned the king never to look at the child, lest he die an early death. The king avoided the sight of his daughter, and he offered 100,000 gold coins to anyone who would marry her and take her out of the country. A blind man and his friend, a hunchback, decided to take up the offer; the king married his daughter to the blind man on the river bank and sent the couple together with the hunchback down the river in a boat. The three set up house together in a foreign land, and after some time the princess began to deceive her husband with the hunchback. She asked her lover to find a means of poisoning her husband. One day the hunchback brought a dead black snake to the princess to cook and feed to the blind man. She cut it up, put it in a pot to cook, and asked her husband to stir it, telling him it was his favorite fish dish. As he was stirring it, the poisonous vapor caused the film over his eyes to peel away, and he regained his vision. Seeing a snake cooking in the pot, he became suspicious and hid his re- covery from his wife. Soon the hunchback came and embraced the princess. At this, the husband took hold of the hunchback and threw him at the princess. From the force of the collision, the hunchback's body became straight, and the lady's third breast was forced in.100 The blindness of the husband is duplicated by the self-imposed blindness of the father, who knows death will follow a vision of the three-breasted princess. The bride coolly premeditates the murder of her husband, but her poison is transformed into medicine, and her restored husband restores his murderous wife to normalcy by an act of violence. Similarly, in the Minaksi myth the goddess is subdued and her third breast made to disappear in the course of a war. The container which carries the dangerous goddess down the river in several of the folk versions has here become a ship (ydna- pdtra) which takes the princess to exile with her sightless husband. Although the text places the story in the north (uttardpathe), there can be no doubt that we have here a development of the Minaksi myth from Maturai. The softened dental of the Tamil name is 100 The Pancatantra (Pirnabhadra's recension), Harvard Oriental Series, no. 11 (Cambridge, Mass., 1908), 5:10 (pp. 285-89). 141</page><page sequence="23">The Murderous Bride preserved in the name Madhupura, and we should recall that the Maturai tradition itself explains the city's name as deriving from madhurd, "sweet"-because serpent's poison was converted there to nectar, as it is, in a sense, in the Paicatantra story.101 There is another direct link between Minaksi of the Maturai Puranas and Kannaki of the epic and its folk retellings-both lose a breast. Kannaki burns the city of Maturai with her wrenched- off left breast; Minaksi's transformation from warrior-queen to wife is symbolized by her loss of the anomalous third breast. The motif of the lost breast appears elsewhere in the south: at Kotunikoluir (Cranganore, on the west coast) Bhagavati has only one breast;102 at Nakapattinam the serpent-goddess originally had three, and one vanished when she caught sight of her husband, Nagaraja-Siva.103 The oldest examples of the motif, however, say nothing of a third breast: in Purananuru 278, a mother threatens to cut off her breasts if her son has shown cowardice in battle. Narrinai 216.9 refers to tirumdvunni, who cut off one breast; this is probably a reference to Kannaki-or to her ancient prototype!- since similar terms (orumdmani, tirumdmani, and tirumdpattini) are attached to her in the Cilappatikaram, usually in connection with her casting off her breast.104 And suddenly we are returned to our starting point-for the phrase tirumdmani ("the great jewel") appears in the first verse of Tiruinnacampantar's first patikam on Tiruvannamalai, the home of the Tamil buffalo myth, in which the fierce goddess is joined to Siva in the androgyne after killing the demon. Now the goddess of Tiruvannamalai is known as apitakucd, which has become in Tamil unndmulaiyammai, "the lady whose 101 Tiruvilaiyatarpuranam 28.1-23. The correspondence of the Paicatantra story with the Minaksi myth was first noticed by Theodore Benfey, Pantschat- antra (Leipzig, 1859), 1:511. The story is first found in the Jain recensions of the Paicatantra (Pfirnabhadra and the Vulgate) but is missing from the Southern Recension, the Kashmiri, and even from the late, much-contaminated southern "Amplior." Did the ancient and important Jain community of Maturai preserve the story and transmit it to the Jains of western India? The nineteenth-century Tamil version of Tianavaraya Mutaliyar, Paicatantiram, 3d ed. (Madras, 1862), pp. 176-79, substitutes a third eye for the anomalous third breast; we will return to this association in a moment. Folk etymology notwithstanding, the name Maturai is presumably a Tamil form of Mathura. 102 Kamil Zvelebil, The Smile of Murugan: On Tamil Literature of South India (Leiden, 1973), p. 173, n. 4. 103 Multiple-breasted goddesses appear elsewhere as well: Artemis at Ephesus has "a multitude of protuding breasts" (James G. Frazer, The Golden Bough [London, 1936], 1:37). The Mexican goddess Coatlicue-who is both benign and fierce, the nourishing earth-mother who slays her lovers-has 400 breasts (see Lewis Spence, The Gods of Mexico [London, 1923], pp. 14, 16, 183-87; I am indebted to Dr. J. R. Marr for this reference). On Nakapattinam, see R. K. Das, Temples of Tamilnad (Bombay, 1964), p. 166; Tirunakaikk&amp;ronappur&amp;nam of Minatci- cuntarampillai (Tiruvavatutarai, 1970) 19.1-147. 104 Cilappatik5ram, patikam 5; 12.49-50; 15.93; 23.14; 27.129. 142</page><page sequence="24">History of Religions breasts have not been sucked." There is a considerable mythology capable of explaining why Parvati, the wife of the yogi-Siva, should be considered unwilling or incapable of nursing her children;'05 but apitakucd can also mean "woman whose breast has disappeared" (from api-/i-), and the androgyne, whose origin is now put at Tiruvannamalai, has only one breast. Has the iconography of this shrine, supported by local myth, retained in the androgyne the ancient image of the goddess who casts her breast-the seat of her sacred power106-at her enemy (i.e., her husband)? As a head rhyme with Annamalai, unndmulai seems too good to be true, and one cannot help feeling that the older term, apitakucd,l07 was Tamilized in this way for purely metrical considerations. Let us return for a moment to the verse on Tiruvan- namalai in Tiruiinanacampantar's Tevdram. This verse begins with a reference to the androgyne but then seems to stray from the usual image: "This is the mountain of the great lord, the One who, joined with Uma whose breasts have not been sucked, became wholly woman; the mountain where the Great Jewel [of chastity- tirumdmani] is resplendent..." (unndmulaiy umaiydlo.tum utan dkiya oruvan/ p?nndkiya perumdn malai tirumdmani tikala . . .).108 The commentator struggles vainly to explain how the androgyne can become "wholly woman." Of course the text of Tiruiinacampantar's poem could be corrupt, and the appearance of tirumdmani there a coincidence. There would still appear to be ample reason to infer that the androgyne at Tiruvannamalai is another example of "icono- trophy"-the misreading of ancient pictures 09-or of the sanskritization of a purely local motif. The murderous goddess has been neutralized through the myth of the androgyne. But how did the myths of Maturai and Nakapattinam arrive at the idea of a third breast, which the goddess loses at the sight of her husband? Precisely, we would suggest, through the same process, and because of the same wish to suppress the stark image of the Murderous Bride. First, one must note the relation of the third 105 See O'Flaherty, pp. 265-70; to these examples one may add the folk myths about Cutsalaimatan, the son of Parvati, who took to eating corpses because he was unsatisfied by his mother's milk (Cutalaimditacuvdmi vilpdttu of M. Muttucamipillai [Maturai, n.d.]), pp. 1-6. 106 On breast symbolism in early Tamil literature see George L. Hart, "Woman and the Sacred in Early Tamilnad," Journal of Asian Studies 32 (1973): 238-41. 107 Cf. Skanda Purana 1.3.2.21.25-26. 108Tirufinnacampantar Tevaram 1.10.1, lines 1-2. This poem is probably the oldest piece of literature connected with this shrine (seventh century?). 109 See Robert Graves, The Greek Myths (reprint ed., Harmondsworth, Middle- sex, 1973), 1:21. 143</page><page sequence="25">The Murderous Bride breast to the third eye. Eyes and breasts are often associated in the myths: a crow-demon drew blood from the breast of Sita and was half-blinded by Rama in punishment.ll0 Visnu worshiped Siva with a thousand lotuses each day; when one was missing, he offered one of his eyes instead and was given the discus Sudarsana as a reward (a pun on the name Sudarsana may be intended);1l the same story is told of Laksmi, who offers not an eye but her breast, which becomes the bilva.1l2 The nipple is called mulaikkan ("breast-eye") in Tamil.113 Minaksi loses her violent nature when she loses her breast at the sight of her spouse, just as the village goddess ]llamman is drained of menacing energy when deprived of her third eye by Siva.ll4 Note that it is seeing her husband that causes Minaksi's breast to disappear (kantav ellaiyil oru mulai maraintatu).ll5 Both the third eye and the third breast, however, may be related to the phallus."6 Breast milk and the seed of the phallus are equated in the origin myths of many shrines, and there are exten- sive links in the mythology between the breast (often of the cow) and the phallus. The Minaksi myth has been interpreted in this light: the loss of the breast represents castration (i.e., the trans- formation from a man into a woman)."7 The same motif leads to a reversal of sex in a story from the Divyavadana: Riupavati cut off her breasts in order to feed a woman reduced by starvation to the point of eating her own child; Rupavati's breasts were restored, and Indra came to test her; "if it is true," she declared, "that I abandoned my breasts for the sake of the child, not to attain sovereignty, heaven or pleasure or to become Indra, then let my female nature disappear and let me become a man"-and at once she became Prince Rupavata! The prince is eventually reborn as a child who lets a bird pluck out his eyes.118 Riipvati loses two breasts and becomes a man; Minaksi loses the anomalous third 110 Valmikiramayana (Baroda, 1960-71), 5.36.12-32; Stanley Rice, Occasional Essays on Native South Indian Life (London, 1901), pp. 211-12; cf.

That the three-breasted goddess is a male-female hybrid we also learn from the popular ballads on Arjuna's marriage to the Queen of Maturai. The Southern Recen- sion of the Mahabharata tells us that Arjuna married Citrinigada, the daughter of the king of "Manaliiru" in the south; there is no mention of a third breast, but the girl is regarded by her father as a son (putro mameyam iti me), and it is through her that the dynasty must be perpetuated.119 In the folk ballads from Maturai, Citrangada has become Alli, the Amazon Queen: Siva withheld offspring from the Pantiyas for twelve years. On the death of the king, the throne was inherited by a slave-girl's son, Ninmukan. The Pantiyas paid him 6000 pots of milk in tribute each year. They performed tapas to overcome the curse of barrenness, and Parvati had mercy on them; she tore a piece of flesh from her shoulder and threw it on to the leaf of a water-lily (alli) in a tank and then called to the P5antiyas: "This is a male and a female." They found a child in the tank and took it home, crying "The Piantiyas have given birth." The child grew into a girl named Alli. When she was seven, she noticed the pots of milk collected for Ninmukan; she spilled the milk and had snakes put in the pots, which were then delivered to the king. Ninmukan came with an army against her, but she fought with him and killed him, thus assuming the crown of Nili and the throne of Maturai.l20 The slaying of Ninmukan-whose name ("Blue-Face") and history suggest that like Kovalan (&gt; Gopala) he may be an allotrope of Krsna-is but the start of Alli's career. The rest of the story is devoted to Arjuna's wooing of the queen, who tries several times to kill her suitor-by having him rolled in burning sand, hanged from a tree, sacrified to Kali, etc. In the end she is captured in a tiger's cage and subdued.l21 Alli is regarded as an incarnation of Minaksi, and her story is an obvious multiform of the Minaksi myths. Indeed, the Alli ballads dwell in detail on the theme of the goddess slaying her consort, expanding what is compressed in the Minnksi cycle. The link with Nili is thus natural, a further rein- forcement of the relationship noted above between the traditions of Maturai and Tiruvalankatu. Moreover, color sustains the link: although Alli is sometimes said to be light except for her black hair, she is a multiform of the dark Kannaki /Kali/ and of Minaksi, who even today is usually painted green. From birth Alli is an 119 The Mahabhdrata (Southern Recension), ed. P. P. S. Sastri (Madras, 1931) 1.203.15-30. The "critical" edition from Poona adopts the southern reading (Manalifra) in 1.207.14-23 but, with better judgment, rejects it in favor of the northern Manipura in 14.78-82 (the story of Babhruvahana, the son of this union, who slays his father in battle). The southern tradition appears to have conflated two separate stories. 120 Alliyaracanimalai, pp. 20-38 (condensed). 121 Ibid., pp. 39-120. This summary hardly does justice to this rich and neglected source of the folk tradition of Maturai. I hope to discuss the myths of Alli at length in a separate study. 145</page><page sequence="27">The Murderous Bride Amazon, physically female but masculine in instinct and action; her double nature is clearly stated by Parvati at her birth, and the Pantiyas at first mistake her for a son. Here, then, is direct confirmation of Minaksi's bisexual character as symbolized by her three breasts. In the case of Alli, even marriage fails to sup- press the masculine component of the androgyne; in the sequel to the Alliyaracdnimdlai, after her marriage to Arjuna, we again find her setting out to slay her spouse.122 Thus the Puranic myths of Tiruvannamalai and Maturai represent nearly identical solutions to the problem of the Murder- ous Bride. Only the sequence is reversed. In Tiruvannamalai the goddess joins the androgyne after slaying Mahisa-Siva; at Maturai she begins as the androgyne and is made a woman in the course of the battle. The terrifying, one-breasted goddess is in one shrine assimilated to the single-breasted ardhandri icon; in the other she goes down in defeat, and her husband survives. Let us note in conclusion the irony of this resolution-for it must be emphasized that the god, far from fleeing the deadly encounter, seeks a Death- in-Love at the hands of his bride. Siva knows the price of entering the sanctuary; if the lover's sacrifice is averted, it is because the god's devotees refuse to allow him to die. Paradoxically, only as a demon can the god achieve union and self-effacement. Small wonder, then, that later poets sing to the goddess of Siva's jealousy: "Feet that Siva longs for, these in your fear you have given to Mahisasura." 23 The Hebrew University of Jerusalem 122 Pavalakkotimalai, wrongly ascribed to Pukalenti (Madras, 1912), passim. In the light of the Tamil myths, the etymologizing myth of the Amazons who cut off one breast "in order to shoot better" may seem less fantastic; so is the tradition that it was the Amazons who set up the image of the many-breasted Artemis at Ephesus (Graves, 1:355 and 2:125, 130-31). 123 Ramprasadsen, cited in Thompson and Spencer, p. 34. 146</page></plain_text>
