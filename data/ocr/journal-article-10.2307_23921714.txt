<plain_text><page sequence="1">Theology that Matters: Ecology, Economy, and God. Edited by Darby Kathleen Ray. Minneapolis, Minn.: Fortress Press, 2006. 245 pp. $22.00 paper. This volume emerges from a symposium gathered out of the conviction that theology must make earthly sense if it is to make any sense at all in an increasingly secular and globalized world, whose language is mainly economics, not traditional god-talk, and whose context includes an ecological crisis that it largely ignores. And so, the book is organized according to the topics God, economy, and ecology—with four essays devoted to each topic. All respond distinctly to the eco-theology of Sally McFague. In Part one: God, David H. Jensen ("Whose Conversation: Theology and its Audience") reminds us that theologians need to be clear about their audience—church, the culture, or fellow advocates. Jensen concludes by elaborating four observations: (1) the disestablishment of the Christian church should be viewed as an opportunity for faithfulness and fuller dialogue; (2) the co-optation of Christian speech by empire is a clear and present danger; (3) modesty, reverence, and imagination are theological virtues; and (4) the centrality of others is indispensable to Christian confession of Christ as Savior. Jay McDaniel's essay, "In the Beginning is the Listening," aims to complement McFague's emphasis on the loving eye by advocating the listening heart and a perception of God as Deep Listening. This development of process theology leads to hearing a fivefold call to live lovingly, self critically, simply, ecologically, and to welcome religious diversity. "Toward an Elemental Theology: A Constructive Proposal," by Ellen Armour, moves beyond the projections of anthropomorphism by advocating the use of the pre-Socratic elements (earth, air, fire, water) as "sensible transcendental" for figuring God. In "God and Power, Prophets, and Native Lands," Joerg Rieger draws a parallel between the story of Ahab, Naboth, and Elijah and the history of European expropriation of Native American lands to critique the readiness of U.S. Christians to identify with the prophet rather than the king. In Part two: Ecology, Nancy Victorin-Vangerug's essay, "From Metaphors and Models to Maps," draws on her experience of living in Perth, Western Australia, and advocates "thinking theology with an archipelagic imagination" as a way of imaging (mapping) the God-world relationship, i.e. a sea joining and nurturing islands. Catherine Keller, "The Flesh of God: A Metaphor in the Wild," meditates on ways of imagining how God is "in" the universe, the "en" in panentheism, and finds an analogy between how she is in her body (as</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 149 other and distinct) and how God is in the world. In "The Human Niche in Earth's Ecological order," Gordon Kaufman argues that we will best find our place in the evolutionary context when we acknowledge that our niche is biohistorical—i.e. that we are animals who (uniquely) require specific cultures for completion and who freely collaborate with serendipitous cosmic creativity, Kaufman's name for God. Mark Wallace, in "Crum Creek Spirituality," meditates on his own eco-neighborhood of Crum Creek at the edge of Swarthmore College, and elaborates McFague's theology of panentheism to celebrate Crum Creek as a sacred place of divine presence. In "The Globalization of Notion [the title of a book] and Creatio ex Nihilo," Marcia Riggs draws on the poetry of James Weldon Johnson, and the treatments of globalization by Ritzer, Schweiker, and McFague, and argues that "responsive moral agency means... that we acknowledge that creation is the context of our being and doing as consumers in global reality" (p. 152). The volume's editor, Darby Kathleen Ray, offers "It's About Time," a reflection on the theology of rest. She advocates a retrieval of Sabbath practices as a way of resisting the dark side of the market values of productivity, efficiency, competition, growth, innovation, and profit and fostering loyalty, mutuality, long-term connection and commitment, workmanship, patience, and honesty. To re-imagine the church in the context of global economics, Eleazar Fernandez explores "The Church as a Household of Life Abundant." He portrays the culture of global economics as a counter religion, "economism," which the church is called to counter the god of endless growth and its priestly advertisers with a conspiracy of round-table eucharist that liberates from commodity addiction and models life abundant in its community life. Sharon Welch meditates on the implications of McFague's theology of metaphor and urges that we embrace an ecological understanding of self and world to become "Artisans of Hope, Artisans of Wonder," crafting together "flourishing communities of honesty, inclusion, self-critique and hope." Finally, Sally McFague offers her "Epilogue: Human Dignity and the Integrity of Creation," which, in form, is a homily aimed at motivating an orthopraxy that knows its place, dares to imagine Isaiah's "new heavens and new earth," and perseveres in collaborating with the kingdom dream of God.
