<plain_text><page sequence="1">WILLIAM G. BOLTZ: The origin and early development of the Chinese writing system. (American Oriental Series, 78.) ix, 205pp. Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 1994. $47.50. In a eulogy of Peter A. Boodberg (1903-72), Edward Schafer wrote that 'virtually the only beneficiaries of his later creative work [e.g., paronomastic definitions as valuable guides to etymology] were a few of his superior students. Probably most of his discoveries [including lexicographical restorations of vanishing initial consonant clusters spelled out in bisyllabic form] will ultimately appear only as remnants filtered through their minds' (Alvin P. Cohen, comp., Selected works of Peter A. Boodberg, Berkeley, 1979, xiv-xv). William Boltz, a dedic- ated student of Boodberg, presents his efforts to recover and refine those filtered remnants in his study of the Chinese writing system. Embedded in a clear but somewhat didactic proof of Boodberg's definition of the logo- graphic nature of Chinese script (see 'Some proleptical remarks on the evolution of archaic Chinese', Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies, 2, 1937, 329-72), Boltz's discussion of the multivalence of graphs represents a bold step towards solving many of the mysteries pre- sented by incomplete xiesheng 11 lists (lists of graphs that share a single primary graph which represents the phonetic or 'shared phon- ophoric', Boltz, 72, 90), published by Bernhard Karlgren in Grammata Serica Recensa (Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities, 1972). After a prolegomenon discussing the defini- tion of writing-the graphic representation of language (not ideas)-the book shows how the evolution of Chinese writing followed the same rules found in other ancient scripts such as Egyptian and Sumerian scripts. The last section of the book explores why Chinese script, for linguistic, cultural, and political reasons, did not evolve into a syllabic system. Scholars of texts written in Old Chinese, as Boltz terms the language reconstructed from the Shijing rhyme groups and the paronomastic glosses of Shuowen jiezi i., may find Boltz's understanding of graphic evolution useful when working with unknown graphs in paleographical documents or with loanwords in transmitted texts. He claims that all graphs developed before the Qin-Han reformation of the script represent different stages of graphic development. First, he explains, in order for a graph to represent writing, as, for example, already evident in the Shang oracle bone script, the graph must have a phonetic value (+ P); it may or may not have also a semantic value (+S) (pp. 18-21). A graph that came to represent a sound may have initially evolved from a sign that simply represented a concept (or an object as in a pictograph). Boltz terms this kind of sign-graph a zodiograph and claims the clear association of a P-value with a zodiograph represents the first stage in the development of a writing system. He does not accept the Chinese claim that Neolithic pottery marks of several millennia earlier represent writing; he claims that real evidence for the first stage of writing in China is still missing. Not included in his text is the recently disco- vered 11-graph, 15-line inscription on a pottery fragment from the late Neolithic site Dingongcun T -t in Zoupingxian *]# ,, Shandong (see Kaogu, 1993, 4: 344-54, 375). The anthropomorphic nature of the graphs is suggestive of zodiographic origins. The excava- tion site also supports Boltz's theory (derived from the unpublished hypothesis of David Keightley) that the 'inventor' of writing belonged to the craft-oriented eastern coastal</page><page sequence="2">404 REVIEWS culture (pp. 41-52), a notion that otherwise seems premature. Although Boltz claims Shang oracle bone graphs 'preserve little or no discernible iconic resemblance to the things or acts they presum- ably depicted in origin' (p. 57), he does not analyse Shang script in any detail. Providing just a few examples, he notes that Shang script had already progressed to Stage Two, a stage of graphic multivalence, and to Stage Three, the stage of adding determinatives. In Stage Two, two techniques are employed. One is the use of rebus or paronomastic writing: 'separat- ing [the graph] from its original semantic association and attaching it, on the basis of its phonetic value alone, to an independent and in many cases unrelated word that happens to be homophonous, or nearly so, with the word that the graph originally represented' (p. 61). The second technique is the use of homeosemous or parasemantic writing: 'a given graph could be applied to different words that were semant- ically congruent enough for the same graph to be pictorially suggestive, even though the phonetic values may have been entirely differ- ent' (p. 62). The first method results in a polyphonic graph (Po-Ps) and the second in a polysemic graph (So-S). To resolve the grow- ing instances of ambiguity inherent in Stage Two, the third stage evolves whereby a second- ary graph-a semantic classifier or phonetic determinative-is appended to the ambiguous graph (pp. 67-8). Boltz's study of multivalent graphs depends primarily on post-Qin materials. He analyses 17 partial xiesheng sets involving such basic zodiographs as A , , If, I, H, and 4 representing words for 'woman', 'child', 'fire ', ' ear ', ' skein of threads', ' eye' and ' thumb'. In each case, he shows how the original zodiograph came to represent more than one word (semantically or, more likely, phonetic- ally) and was 'disambiguated' with a semantic classifier and/or phonetic determinative. By understanding the polyphonic nature of zodiog- raphs, he shows how elusive xiesheng series can be recovered and graphic incongruities explained (pp. 106-25). What were understood simply as semantic classifiers, for example, may in fact have functioned as phonetic determinat- ives (see an I, pp. 107-10). While this method is an enticing way to figure out the odd word in a shared phonetic series, one problem with the concept of multivalency for modern etymo- logists is the increased ambiguity of recon- structing root words without imposing the very subjectivity that led to the folk etymology of 'ideographs' in the first place. In Boltz's analysis of the graph 4, for example, we are to understand that the word sun &lt; *swan 'grand- child, descendant' may have been composed of two polyphonic graphs: - with the readings *tsjogx 'child', *grjokw 'childbirth', *gswan 'descendant' and , with the readings *sjog ' silk', *sjans ' thread', *gin ' string', and *gswan 'lineage' (pp. 111, 123-25). He claims that since both graphs were also 'semantically suggestive' (p. 125), they helped to reinforce the intended reading, probably *gswan, and reduce the ambiguity surrounding the original phonophoric, either f or . In other words, this graph is made up of two P +/S + zodiog- raphs. Does this redundancy imply that the ancient Chinese were sensitive to the iconic representation of a graph as well as its purely linguistic function? Can a graph be both logograph in evolutionary derivation and ideo- graph in contemporary cultural interpretation (so that it is not just Western investigators who were 'dazzled by the apparently exotic nature of the Chinese script', p. 106)? Could this sensitivity to the art of script also be a variable in the preservation over time of the logographic system over the development of a syllabary (see Boltz's review of Han interest in representation, xiang ,, in script classification, pp. 143-8)? These and other questions arise as one pores through Boltz's xiesheng lists and reads about the 'logical way to write' a particular concept (idea?), such as childbirth (p. 112). Boltz's theory of multivalence also means that etymologists must now view every element of a multicomponent graph (presumably one would trace the pre-reformation form and use of each element) as a suspect phonophoric with or without semantic overtones. Once released from the earlier constriction of simple phonetic + signific digraphs, one could theoret- ically feed endless multiples of multivalences, word series, and root words into a computer and hope for significant fields of correspond- ence. This freedom of exploration may in fact be precisely what the field of historical linguist- ics needs to break through the earlier reliance on Han period texts or Han period transmitted texts which restricted the reconstruction of Old Chinese to a very late stratum, leaving the phonetics of the Shang and early Zhou period language essentially a mystery. Unfortunately, while Boltz's examples are intriguing, to truly discover the rules and limits of his theory would require 'an exhaustive examination of the script seen in all of the recently discovered manuscripts' (p. 158), precisely what Boltz could not provide within the limits of this book. The analysis of paleographical sources, and not simply the early Han manuscripts from Mawangdui with which Boltz is most familiar, is one serious lacuna in this otherwise worthy book. He dismisses bronze inscriptions, for example, which cover the period from the late Shang up to the Qin reformation (2000-221 B.c.), as not being 'typical of the general nature of language and writing' because their inscrip- tions were 'commemorative rewards' inscribed on ritual objects (p. 158). If by commemorative he wishes to imply that they were written in a religious code not reflective of language, then he is mistaken. Many Zhou inscriptions include long narratives that can be compared with the early strata of transmitted texts, including the Shijing and the Shujing. Other inscriptions may be short, but a linguistically coherent message is still the intent. Boltz does not find the ritual nature of the silk manuscripts discovered in late Warring States and early Han tombs an obstacle, presumably because many of them can be linked more directly to transmitted texts. Boltz is clearly only comfortable with the post Qin-Han reformation standardized script. He relegates paleographic texts for use as mere tools for the comparison of local graphic variants and not as primary linguistic material (see his brief exploration of graphic variation for the Mawangdui Laozi manuscripts, pp. 161-7). While Boltz's avoidance of in-depth</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 405 analyses of paleographic materials is under- standable given the limits of an introductory text on Chinese script, their lack represents the potential theoretical limits of his work, depend- ent as it is on post-unification materials. In the last section of the book, Boltz examines how the Qin-Han reformation of script enforced 'the predominant isomorphism between words and syllables', repressing any tendency of the Chinese writing system to enter a fourth stage, the evolution of a syllabary (p. 71). He shows how the concerns for unifica- tion at the Qin and Han courts led to political suppression of syllabic tendencies initiated during the Warring States period, a time when diverse scribal practices were used to represent bisyllabic words (pp. 170-73). Boltz notes that legends during the reformation period associ- ated the creation of writing with other technical inventions symbolic of social order (pp. 129-38). The concern to control writing, Boltz suggests, was related to the magical efficacy of the written word to name (ming 1) and communicate with the demons and spirits. Control of names, the ming or the wen ) 'signs/ordered markings/culture', may have been the motivation of the earliest studies of Chinese, such as by Xu Shen (c. 55-c. 149), compiler of the Shuowen jiezi, 'talking about wen and analyzing zi' (pp. 137-43). Boltz explains how Han analysis of script, while fundamentally flawed (see his discussion of Xu's six forms of script, liushu A~, pp. 143-9), reflects some sense of the true nature of script: the term zi I was used to designate multicomponent characters, and wen, according to Boltz, referred to 'single, unanalyzable graphic elements' (p. 141). The ultimate goal of Han scholarly efforts, however, was to enforce moral order through a 'proper meaning' (_$) for each graph, putting a stop to further desemanticization (pp. 174-7). While the limits of the text may be frustrating to those familiar with Shang and Zhou paleo- graphic documents-one hopes that Boltz will continue to expand his studies eventually to replace the Grammata Serica Recensa-the introductory nature of it will be useful to students of Chinese language and of early Chinese texts.
