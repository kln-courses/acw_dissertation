<plain_text><page sequence="1">SIR PERCY NUNN: 1870-1944 By J. W. TIBBLE, Professor of Education, University of Leicester Thomas Percy Nunn was born at Bristol in I870, with, so to speak, a stick of chalk in his hand. His grandfather and father were schoolmasters; the proprietary school which they kept was trans- ferred to Weston-super-Mare in I873. There T. P. Nunn was educated and at the age of sixteen was helping with the teaching and was pro- ducing school plays some of which he had written. Another of his boy- hood hobbies was the making of mathematical instruments, and in later years he recalled his delight in taking readings with a sextant of his own making. After matriculating at Bristol University College, he continued to help in the school and on his father's death in 189o he inherited the responsibility for its management. But feeling that he was too young to gain the confidence of the parents, he resigned and went to teach first in Halifax, then at grammar schools in London. He had taken the London B.Sc. degree in 1890 and followed this with a B.A. in 1895. In 1903, when he was Mathematics and Physics Master at the William Ellis School, Haverstock Hill, his services were secured by the College Com- mittee of the recently founded London Day Training College to de- monstrate methods of teaching science and mathematics to students who met on Saturday mornings at the Shoreditch Technical Institute. Nunn was a brilliant teacher of science and mathematics, and a pioneer in these subjects of the 'new' methods which he was to advocate in general terms during the rest of his career. His lectures and demonstra- tions continued to be an inspiration to generations of apprentice science teachers. In 1905 he was appointed Vice-Principal of the London Day Training College and in 1922 he succeeded SirJohn Adams as Principal. From 1913 he was also Professor of Education of London University, thus becoming the second professor in the College. The connection of the College with the University had been strengthened in 1909 when, owing to its growing importance as a graduate school, it became a School of the University. The London County Council retained financial control, but a College Council, on which the L.C.C. and the Senate were equally represented, was responsible for its educational management; the staff became eligible for appointment as Teachers in the University. In its early years, the School had many difficulties to face. At first it had no home of its own; this was remedied when, in 1907, the L.C.C. provided a building in Southampton Row. It was a tall, solid building, part of a block, 'grim, grey building with the nasty stairs' as the In- stitute song had it. 'As time went on the building became old, cramped and shabby, but, like some ageing and eccentric personality, it grew to 58</page><page sequence="2">SIR PERCY NUNN: 1870-1944 have individuality and character. By the nineteen-thirties it was ripe with tradition, legend, custom.'l This building, from 1907 to his retire- ment in 1936, was the centre of Nunn's (from 1930 Sir Percy Nunn's) working life; he contributed richly to the tradition and became part of it. Other early problems arose from the nature of the course-problems faced at this time by all the universities and university colleges with teacher-training departments. Most of the students took their profes- sional training courses concurrently with courses for a B.A. or B.Sc. degree. Time-tabling problems were a nightmare, and the opposing pressures on students excessive. As a student of the time comments, 'We regarded the two or three half-days a week at London Day as a neces- sary and inevitable price to pay for the opportunity of graduating, seeing that a university course would otherwise have been financially im- possible.'2 By insisting on the fundamental importance of the profes- sional training, the London Day Training College played an important part in bringing about the change, in 1911, to the Four Year Course. This gave all the graduate students an extra year for their professional studies (previously there had been only a few in this category) and made the Teachers' Diploma a postgraduate study. There was also in the early days a group of students pursuing a two-year non-graduate course, and these, in contrast with the three-year students, were enthusiastic students of education, with a high level of professional motivation. One of them records that Dr. Nunn made science a delight to them. The conditions, indeed, during the whole period of Nunn's office as a Vice-Principal, called for teachers of exceptional enthusiasm and skill. There is a vivid picture of Nunn during this period by a student of the L.D.T.C. in 1911-12 who, some thirty-two years later, was to receive Nunn's congratulations on his appointment to the Directorship of the London Institute of Education. In his account Dr. Jeffery had just commented on the aloofness of Sir John Adams from the students' point of view. 'My contacts with Nunn were much more intimate and personal, perhaps because we had so much in common. We were both mathematicians with strong interests in philosophy and music. We were both fundamentally teachers. We both loved a good argument. He had a remarkable power of marshalling facts and arguments in a plain and clear cut pattern. At a later stage we were both regular attenders at the meetings of the Aristotelian Society. It was an almost regular procedure, after someone had discoursed with more learning than clarity of thought or diction, for Nunn to get up and re-present the case in ten minutes of crystal clarity. So many of the difficulties of the pupil arise from unnecessary complication and obscurity that simplicity and clarity of exposition are one half of the art of teaching. Nunn had the other half too. He never talked down to you. He put himself by your 1 Studies and Impressions 1902-52.

You were learning and he was learning; you were learning together. The remarkable thing is that it was perfectly true. In teaching you, his vivid and adventurous mind was sure to see some new light and you shared the discovery together.'" Under Nunn's guidance and inspiration as Principal from 1922 the College expanded steadily, not only in numbers but in the scope and variety of the work. The M.A. degree in Education had been esta- blished in 1914 and the Ph.D. degree in Education was instituted after the First World War. Some years later the Special Department of Higher Degrees and Research was set up under the charge of Dr. Hamley, who became a professor in 1932. This was attended by many senior students from this country and overseas. Even from the beginning experienced teachers from the Dominions and Colonies had attended the College, and in 1927 a Colonial (to begin with, African-Colonial) Department was instituted, under James Fairgrieve, who added this to his many other enthusiasms. He testified to the support and active help of Nunn in the development of the course. These deeper and wider developments of the work were recognised by the formal transfer in 1932 of the London Day Training College to the Senate of the Uni- versity and the College became the London University Institute of Education. The transfer was accompanied by a gift of C150,000 for the erection of a building worthy of these wider purposes. Another development during Nunn's tenure of office was the estab- lishment of the Training College Delegacy in 1928, charged with re- sponsibility for syllabuses of instruction and the examination of students in some fifteen training colleges in the London area, with the admission of new colleges into the scheme and the grouping and regrouping of colleges round schools of the University. This foreshadowed the trans- formation, twenty years later, of the Institute in the unique sense into the largest of the modern type Institutes of Education. Writing in 1928, Nunn anticipated this further development. 'The ideal solution of the problem of training would seem to involve an institution of University rank-a centre of educational criticism and inspiration, and a clearing house of educational ideas-with schools working in such close relations with it as to be true organs of its spirit.' He hoped these 'would also function as "staff colleges" for the refreshment and further education of practising teachers, for this was an aspect of the question of training no less important than the one ordinarily suggested by the term.'2 Brief reference should also be made, because of their wide influence in the world of education, to the institution in 1924 of a course of training for teachers in art under Marion Richardson, to the setting up of the department of Child Development under Susan Isaacs in I933 and to the formation of a Division of Overseas Students to which Professor 1 Studies and Impressions, p. 14. 2 Report of the Mathematical Association Committee 1928. Appendix C. 60</page><page sequence="4">SIR PERCY NUNN: I87O-I944 Fred Clarke was appointed as Adviser. In 1936 he succeeded Sir Percy as Director of the Institute. To Dr. Jeffery's picture of Nunn as the inspiring teacher may be added one or two other impressions of him from the recollections of his colleagues. 'T. P. Nunn's outstanding intellectual capacity and wisdom made him the leader under whom the staff made so notable a contribu- tion to modern educational thought, both on the theoretical and philosophical side and in the production of material for use in schools. He himself, philosopher, mathematician, scientist, musician, with his great gifts of organization and ability to manage men, carried a tremen- dous burden of work. The speed with which he coped with it and the amount he got through was amazing. Not only was he Principal and Professor of Education, he was also responsible for the methods courses in mathematics and science, and he directed and took a large part in the work of the higher degree courses. He was a brilliant teacher and his discussion lessons were something to be remembered. His knowledge seemed encyclopaedic. ... But his occupations were not all serious, and many college songs bore witness to his sense of humour and gift for parody. Then, for very busy people always seem to find time for more, he got a small printing press and took great pride in replacing the typed foolscap sheets of songs with his neat little printed pages.'1 'Developed as it has with the years, the present structure of life and work in the Institute is of his building. It was he who introduced the tutorial system, a landmark in the development of the college, bringing as it did the close contact of student and lecturer. The lecture had been the central point under Sir John Adams and he had himself read and returned the ter- minal essays of all the students !'2 Another colleague refers to the staff's ' realisation of his supreme position as thinker, organiser, mathematician and teacher,' and says of his lectures 'we found his marshalling of ideas, illustrations and evidence, a masterly exhibition of skill and persuasive art. It was difficult not to accept everything he said.' The writer goes on to refer to Nunn's unfeigned delight in a large number of varied activities, including the printing press and a catholic appreciation of music. 'He was never tired of discussing the principles of aesthetics with us; his searching and enquiring mind enjoyed probing such problems as the artist's concentration during creative work being unselfconscious yet subjective.'3 But his special delight was in mathematical problems, especially those which offered opportunities for framing solutions which had some aesthetic qualities. There are many tributes to Nunn's modesty, his quiet, gracious and courteous manner, his accessibility to students and staff and the contagion of his enthusiasms. 'He was so frank and open in his enthusiasms, and he always assumed in his audience an equal interest and an equal understanding, not without 1 Studies and Impressions, pp. 37-8. 2 Ibid., p. 42. 3 Ibid., p. 47. 61</page><page sequence="5">SIR PERCY NUNN: 1870-1944 some justification, for his expressive tones and emphasis, the force and clarity of his presentation, his ardent convictions and his happy excite- ment in his guests.. . were irresistible.'1 C. H. Judd, writing in 1914, noted with surprise that in England even professors in university train- ing colleges devoted much time to demonstration lessons given to children from a neighbouring elementary school. Nunn was one of these professors; but he was also equally concerned to correct the deficiency which Judd goes on to note. 'In striking contrast with this emphasis on practical education is the relative neglect of educational theory. One is very much impressed by the fact that in the English training colleges the whole theoretical side of pedagogy has a very meager and abstract treatment.. .'2 Nunn's interest in philosophy stemmed directly from his interests in science and mathematics and his preoccupation with the teaching of these subjects. On the theoretical side he kept abreast of the latest de- velopments in physics and mathematics at a particularly exciting stage in their history when the work of Einstein, Whitehead, Russell, J. J. Thomson, Rutherford, Bragg, Planck, Niels Bohr, Sommerfeld (the selection is Nunn's own) were opening new horizons in a variety of fields. He was especially interested in bridging the gap between the work of the specialist innovators in science and the understanding of teachers and others who might be concerned with the implications and applications of the new theories. His Relativity and Gravitation, published in 1923, is sub-titled 'An Elementary Treatise upon Einstein's Theory' and was, he says 'written by a layman for other laymen who are, so to speak, a few lessons behind him.' It is based on Einstein's own papers, Eddington's Report, Jean Bequerel's treatise, and Whitehead's recently published Theory of Relativity. The book comes somewhere between a popular exposition for non-mathematical readers and a serious treatise for students with considerable technical equipment. The mathematics in it is equivalent to the standard of pass B.Sc. and one of its features is that it arrives at an explanation of the eclipse effect and the anomalous behaviour of Mercury without bringing in the more difficult tensor calculus. He also expressed his interest in relativity theory in his con- tribution to a symposium at an Aristotelian Society meeting in the session i921-2. It was on 'The Idealist Interpretation of Einstein's Theory', and Nunn and Whitehead read papers rebutting the claim that Einstein's theory gave support to the neo-idealist view. Nunn's case is that Einstein's physics takes no more account of the 'subjective' in ex- perience than did the physics of Newton. The references to the 'ob- server' had been misunderstood; he figures in the scheme merely as a reference point, not as a person, and is a device for combating the belief of the older physicists that all observations could be referred to a single space-time framework. 1 Studies and Impressions, p. 48. 2 The Training of Teachers in England, Scotland &amp; Germany, 19 14- 62</page><page sequence="6">SIR PERCY NUNN: I870-I944 Nunn's practical teaching interests were embodied in a number of text books published just before the First World War. He was general editor of Black's Elementary Science Series and with E. Barrett produced A First Class Book of Chemistry in 1912. Exercises in Algebra appeared in Longman's Modern Mathematical Series in 1913 and in the following year The Teaching of Algebra, a book for the teacher to be used in conjunction with the Exercises. This is a full scale treatment of the subject, embody- ing his lectures to schoolmasters and schoolmistresses in 19o9-o0, and, as he says, including all the useful things he had learned during fifteen years of work as a mathematics master and ten years of discussion with teachers, actual and prospective. In the Chapter on 'Method and Curriculum' he sets out his confession of faith as a teacher of mathe- matics. Mathematical truths have two aspects: with one they have contact with the world of outer relations in space and time: in the other aspect, they face and have relations with one another. The history of mathematics shows an ever widening development on both sides with some mathematicians like Lagrange and Clerk-Maxwell developing the outer connections while others like Gauss or Cantor develop the inner realm. But the two aspects are necessarily connected and the view that they represent distinct forms of intellectual activity is a pernicious one. Pupils should be led to realize this two-fold significance in an elementary way. Thus algebra should be introduced as a symbolic language specially adapted for making concise statements of a numerical kind and the pupils should feel from the first that the formulae refer to realities beyond themselves. This would open up a number of problems of importance from a theoretical point of view, like the meaning and use of negative numbers, fractional indices, etc. It also becomes apparent that 'variables' of widely differing character are often bound to each other by identical quantitative laws and this would lead to the study of functions. He makes out a strong case for including trigonometry and calculus as part of all this, not as separate subjects. In this book Nunn is applying the ideas behind the 'new teaching' of mathematics and helping, by his particular blend of reforming enthusiasm and practical commonsense, to erode the sterile debris of the centuries, the rote learn- ing of Euclidean theorems and the mechanical manipulation of alge- braic formulae. He insisted that pupils should understand what they were doing and realize its applications. Meanwhile, as a development of his scientific interests, Nunn had clarified his ideas on what was to be for the next twenty years his central concern in the field of philosophy. These ideas were set out in a paper read to the Aristotelian Society in February 1906 and this was expanded into a thesis presented for the degree of Doctor of Science of the Uni- versity of London. This was published in I9O6, The Aims and Achieve- ments of Scientific Method. The views there set out and illustrated were re-stated in a series of papers and contributions to Symposia of the Aristotelian Society between 1905 and 1925. The context and slant of 63</page><page sequence="7">SIR PERCY NUNN: 1870-1944 the papers varied but there was no substantial change of position on the central topic. His main concern lay in the field of epistemology (in one way or another this has been the main concern of most twentieth century philosophers) and in particular with the nature of scientific knowledge, and the relation between scientific 'objects' and the 'things' of everyday life. To the idealist schools of philosophy which had flourished in the second half of the nineteenth century, everyday aware- ness and the empirical methods of the scientist could give but a relative, particular and partial knowledge of true reality, which could be grasped only by means of philosophical speculation which soars into realms transcending the physical. For all these idealists the objects of human knowledge were thought to be changed in the act of knowing them, so that men could never know what they were like independent of their being known. At the beginning of the twentieth century in several countries there were developed philosophic systems which refuted the idealist view and insisted that things are not significantly changed by our knowing them. These movements-neo-Thomism in France, Phenomenology in Germany, the 'Cambridge school' in England, Henry James and the 'neo-realists' in America were all realist in this sense. Nunn was an uncompromising realist; he acknowledged his indebtedness to G. E. Moore, Samuel Alexander, Bertrand Russell and A. N. Whitehead in this country and he was familiar with the current trends in American philosophy. In Nunn's view the data given us by our senses have an objective reality in nature. This view is based on two considerations '(I) That sense-experience contains as an integral element a direct announcement that its objects are outside and independent of the mental act; (2) that analysis can discover in things nothing except sensa and their forms of connexion.'1 The things we are aware of in everyday life are structures embracing and actually consisting of all the 'sense-data', 'sensibilia', 'sensa' or 'sense objects' which commonsense regards as appearances or qualities of the thing. Science he regards as a conative process, 'which aims at rendering objective facts intelligible to an individual conscious- ness, and reaches that end by building up those primary facts into secondary constructions or apperceptive systems, by means of ideas drawn from other contexts of experience.'2 The biological sciences and geology had remained on the whole on the plane of commonsense things and observable events. But the great achievement of the physical sciences was generally held to be their discovery behind the veil of commonsense things and observable events of a world of 'scientific objects' and un- observable events-heat, electricity, ether, atoms, electrons, and their movements and interactions. These had come to be accepted as 'facts' 1 'Scientific Objects and Common Sense Things,' Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society. Vol. 24, p. 7- 2 The Aims and Achievements of Scientific Method, p. 123. 64</page><page sequence="8">SIR PERCY NUNN: 1870- 1944 (Nunn quotes Rutherford 'We are certain that the existence of the atom is no longer an hypothesis, but a verified fact')I and this had led to the 'bifurcation of Nature' against which Whitehead had protested. So Nunn was led to enquire into the characteristics of these scientific entities and transactions which displace the things and events of the plain man. He comes out with the conclusion 'that scientific objects are always modelled after the things of commonsense and are, in truth, nothing but commonsense things stripped conceptually of any pro- perties that happen in a given case to be irrelevant or inconvenient. In short, the typical 'explanations' of physics consist in taking things and events from some context of commonsense experience and reading them into some other context for the purpose of making the second context more intelligible.'l Thus Nunn holds, with Whitehead, that there are three main types of object-sense objects, physical or commonsense objects and scientific objects, forming an ascending hierarchy. But he differs from Whitehead, who gives the three types an equal right to be considered denizens of nature, by feeling that there is between physical objects and scientific objects a difference of character which makes it impossible to locate them in the same world. If scientific objects were genuine elements of the world, additional to commonsense things, they ought, he thinks, to exhibit commonsense things worked up in forms not already exemplified in the way commonsense things are constructed from sensa. There are no such new forms. Scientific objects are always modelled on familiar types of perceptual experience. There is further- .more an element of fashion and mutability about them-he refers to outmoded entities and remarks that ether seems to be going the same way. To summarize from his Presidential Address to the Aristotelian Society in 1925, where he restates his conclusions of 1906, 'Common- sense things, I argued, are primary syntheses or constructions of sense data; scientific objects are secondary syntheses or constructions of the same data. And, as I have already said, I laid great stress upon the fact that the materials worked up into the secondary constructions include not merely the sensa but also the forms of association which make sensa into things.'2 'Scientific objects are not a new order of things, but are merely commonsense things drawn, with relevant simplifications, from familiar contexts of perceptual experience and employed to make more refractory contexts intelligible. In short a scientific object is more than a formula only because it presents a formula by means of a myth.'3 In his papers read to the Society, Nunn deals with the difficulties to which his central thesis gives rise and elaborates the different types of secondary construction found in science; there is space here only to follow up one or two points which make a link with his later writings on 1 Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society. Vol. 24, p. 3- 2 Ibid., p. 14. 3 Ibid., p. i8. 5 65</page><page sequence="9">SIR PERCY NUNN: I87o-I944 Education. It is a corollary of his view of the scientific process that 'to understand the genesis of a physical theory we must often take into account the investigator's psychology as well as his logic.'1 He develops this with reference to the controversy in physics between atomic or pro- jectile type theories and hydrodynamic or wave type theories. In an earlier paper,2 he developed another application of this, suggesting that the recent development of psychology as a positive science had pro- foundly affected the course of recent philosophical studies, transforming the logician ever more completely into an epistemologist. As long as knowledge was regarded as the special product of the activity of an intellectual 'faculty' (as in the Aristotelian and Cartesian systems), functioning independently of the mind's other 'faculties', the subject matter of logic was the determination of the general relations between one piece of knowledge and others, and any reference to non- intellectual mental elements would be excluded. 'But now that know- ledge and feelings and will are recognised to be distinguishable yet not separable features of a continuous individual experience, it seems no longer permissible to the logician to assume that an account may be given of the processes of knowledge in terms of the cognitive elements of experience alone.'3 Conative and emotional factors must also be taken into account. Consideration of the conative process also links human behaviour with that of other living creatures. 'A series of acts of be- haviour, at any biological level, is not merely a succession; it breaks up into parts which form real unities of ends and means: such a unity is a conative process.'4 At some biological level the contents of the conative process become conscious contents and at the human level the process includes the subject's knowledge, infra-perceptual, perceptual and con- ceptual, of the other entities of the universe. The initiation of a conative process is determined by the subject's entrance into a cognitive relation with one or more of these 'objects of knowledge', provided that this is accompanied by the appearance of other conscious contents of the ' affective' type. 'It is in these affective elements that the conative force is felt to reside, which determines the succession of the cognative elements within the process'. He goes on to describe the progressive development of conative systems in their two aspects-the development of cognitive elements and of affective elements. 'But though distinguish- able as aspects, these are inseparable in fact. Here we have a point of the utmost importance, vital, it seems to me, to an adequate epistemological theory. Thus as the cognitive content of a simple conative process be- comes fuller and richer, its affective content shows corresponding changes in character, though these will not necessarily be so great as to make it impossible to describe the emotion or appetite by the same 1 Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society.

Here is Nunn's first statement of what was to be- come a central theme in Education: Its Data and First Principles; and it shows the close link between his epistemological and psychological interests. Later in this same paper he develops a theory of epistemological levels which is similar to the description of the three phases of learning developed by Whitehead in his Aims of Education. At every epistemo- logical level, attempts to reach knowledge exhibit a rhythm, the alternate phases of which may generally be recognized as having an in- ductive and a deductive character. He describes the inductive and deductive aspects for each of the three levels-the 'wonder' level, the intermediate or utilitarian level, and the scientific level. These levels correspond to the three stages or classes of hypothesis' which Nunn had worked out in his paper on 'Causal Explanation'. He used this notion, indeed, in the same year (1907) in a chapter on Natural Science which he contributed to The Practice of Instruction edited by J. W. Adamson, as well as an exposition of his views on primary and secondary elements. He developed his views on the teaching of science more fully and eloquently in the chapter he contributed to The New Teaching, edited by John Adams, 1918. He tilts against the teacher's proneness to think that the educational virtue of a subject lies in some essence to be distilled from it and administered in regular doses as a mental tonic-the classical teacher's faith in laborious construing or mechanical verse- making, the mathematician's in the talismanic virtues of Euclid, or the science teacher's in cultivating observation or inculcating scientific method. 'Our proper aim, then, is to make our pupils feel, so far as they may, what it is to be, so to speak, inside the skin of the man of science, looking out through his eyes as well as using his tools, experiencing not only something of his labours but also something of his sense of joyous intellectual adventure.'2 'Habits of exact thought and interest in scientific theory must be regarded as goals marking the end of the course, not entrance gates into it.'3 He asks for more variability in learning and teaching, guiding the pupil's development with a looser rein. 'The ideal of a course laid down in advance for all pupils, with their achievements mapped out ahead for each session, term and hour, must give place to an ideal of progress more elastic and more closely related to the ways of mental growth.'4 He would exploit the pupils' interest in (a) the thaumaturgic side of science-the wondrous powers and magical transformations, the curious ways and the beauty and mystery, and (b) the utilitarian and practical side, how this is made, how it works; and so lead on to a study of theoretical principles. 'The great need in science teaching is still to clear academic lumber out of the 1 Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society. Vol. 7. 2 The New Teaching, p.

The ideas expressed in these contributions prior to 1920 were more fully worked out and related in the lectures on the Principles of Education which he delivered in the College and in his method courses on the teaching of science and mathematics. Education: Its Data and First Principles was first published in I920. It was reprinted yearly, in some years more than once, down to 1930 when a second edition with some expansion and revision appeared. There were eight reprints between 1930 and 1941. A third edition appeared in i945 with further revision and the addition of a new chapter on Mental Measurement. But as he says in the preface to the third edition, the central thesis of the book remains unchanged. This thesis is set out in the first chapter. 'We shall stand throughout on the position that nothing good enters into the human world except in and through the free activities of individual men and women and that educational practice must be shaped to accord with that truth. This view does not deny or minimize the responsibilities of a man to his fellows; for the individual life can develop only in terms of its own nature, and that is social as truly as it is "self-regarding". Nor does it deny the value of tradition and discipline or exclude the influences of religion. But it does deny the reality of any super-personal entity of which the single life, taken by itself, is but an insignificant element. It reaffirms the infinite value of the individual person; it reasserts his ultimate responsibility for his own destiny; and it accepts all the practical corollaries that assertion implies.'2 Nunn then deals with the objection that this doctrine may seem to permit no discrimination between good and bad ideals of life-between forms of individuality that ought to be discouraged and forms that ought to be suppressed. Clearly the child's extreme dependence in his early years imposes on the adult the responsibility for guidance and control. This involves judge- ments-they may be faulty and mistaken judgements-'limiting the abstract freedom of his self creative growth. But such limitations are part of the inevitable conditions of life.' This necessary guidance of the parent and teacher, and the studies and discipline of a school, represent- ing the cultural and moral traditions which authority deems to be of vital value, 'should yet leave abundant room for the free development of individuality.' 3 A generation, later than Nunn's, made wary by the prodding goad of semantic analysis, will already be clamorous with questions. What is the status of such terms as 'good', 'free', 'value', 'responsibility', 'creative', and so on in Nunn's argument? Has he not, 1 Ibid., p. 165. 2 Education: its Data and First Principles, pp. 12-13. Quotations are from the third edition, unless otherwise stated. 3 Ibid., p. 14. 68</page><page sequence="12">SIR PERCY NUNN: 1870-1944 by the end of this chapter, in fact reversed his argument and should he not be considering, as a first principle, the nature of those social factors and values which decide, on the human level, what forms of indivi- duality are to be allowed or encouraged and what suppressed or dis- couraged? But before we attempt an evaluation of Nunn's central thesis, it is desirable to consider the way he supports his argument in the rest of the book. The data which Nunn educes in support of his central position are mainly drawn from the fields of biology and psychology, in particular the 'hormic' psychology developed by William McDougall in his very popular Introduction to Social Psychology, 1908. Nunn, following McDougall, sees, as the basic characteristic of human and animal be- haviour, an intrinsic power of self determination, the striving to achieve an end or goal; we are aware of this on the conscious level as conation; Nunn uses the term 'horme' to cover both conscious and unconscious manifestations of this tendency. It is what differentiates the living animal from dead matter, is the basis of the animal's characteristic attitude of independence towards its world. It expresses itself in two forms, conservative and creative. Hormic processes, in these two forms, not only exist at different 'levels', they tend to fuse with each other in hormic processes of wider scope, forming systems and hierarchies. In any living creature horme interacts with another basic tendency for which Nunn borrows the term 'mneme' from the German biologist Semon, to cover the 'unconscious memory' referred to by Samuel Butler, as well as conscious remembering. 'Every act of self-assertion is both hormic and mnemic: hormic in so far as it is an instance of the conservative or creative activity which is the essence of life, mnemic in so far as its form is at least partly shaped by the organism's individual or racial history.'l The 'engram-complexes' through which mneme operates are not dead deposits in the organism, but the vehicles in which the conservative and creative functions appear and are exercised. In his discussion of the relations between horme and mneme, Nunn brings in some of the 'findings' and case studies of the psycho-analysts to stress the active and purposive nature of complexes operating below the conscious level. The rest of the book follows a spiral course. There are chapters on 'Routine and Ritual' and on 'Play' to illustrate the functioning of the creative and conservative tendencies on the cultural level. A chapter on 'Freedom in Education' deals with the applications of the 'play-way' in education-Montessori, the heuristic method, the 'Dalton plan', Homer Lane-and the questions raised concerning school organization and the function of the teacher. He then considers the influences of environment and endowment on the child's develop- ment, and deals with the latter more fully in the third edition in the chapter on 'Mental Measurement', based mainly on the work of Spearman. A chapter, with the title 'Mimesis' in the second and third editions, deals with the 'general tendency shown by an individual to 1 Education, p. 50. 69</page><page sequence="13">SIR PERCY NUNN: 1870--1944 take over from others their modes of action, feeling and thought'. He draws on Graham Wallas, McDougall (The Group Mind) and Freud and goes on to consider the uses and abuses of suggestion by politicians and teachers. Chapter 12 poses the question, 'Are there, apart from mimesis, forces in human nature which determine fixed lines along which our activities must flow and which even free creation must follow?'1 The chapter deals with the theory of instincts-mainly McDougall, with some reference to his later modifications in the third edition and to Drever's criticism of the primacy of emotions. Nunn is careful to rebut the view of the organism as a bundle of instincts. 'We must insist that the organism comes before the instincts and that these are but special modes of self assertion that have developed and become "canalised" in the course of its racial history...'2 The next chapter 'The Growth of the Self', following Shand and McDougall, but with a wealth of illustra- tion and application, traces the path by which instinctive tendencies become organized into sentiments, 'the foundations of character', and how the sentiments themselves are organized within the control of the 'self-regarding sentiment' which acts, with varying efficiency, as a kind of gyroscopic wheel. Nunn then considers in more detail the factors concerned in cognition and action, stressing the relation between these (Learn by Doing) via an account of the structure and function of the nervous system. 'The Development of Intellect' deals with perception, reasoning and the process of abstraction (embodying Nunn's earlier notion of 'secondary constructions'); it includes in the later editions an account of Gestalt-psychology and of Spearman's noe-genetic principles. The aim of cognitive activity is seen as 'the intellectual control of the world in face of which the individual maintains his creative indepen- dence.' 3 It operates in three modes, practical, aesthetic and ethical- in his discussion of these Nunn draws on the philosophers Croce, Samuel Alexander and Bergson. The final chapter, 'The School and the Individual', restates the original theme in the context of the school society, and deals with such topics as discipline (self-discipline is the goal), education for citizenship (not enough to have a special subject), co-education (an equally intractable question), vocational education (permissible if conducted in a liberal spirit), multilateral v. tripartite or bi-partite (all these solutions have a place), and the curriculum (all branches to be taught as activities). It will be clear from the above account that the case for Nunn's main thesis, as he presents it, rests on the validity of the 'doctrine of instincts' as developed by McDougall. As it happened Nunn wrote his book at 1 The words 'forces', 'determine', 'must', raise again the questions noted with regard to Chapter I. If they 'must follow' in what sense are they 'free'?

In the next twenty years criticism of the doctrine-particularly from the Behaviourists but also implicit in the findings of Cultural Anthropology-rose to a crescendo. The British Journal of Educational Psychology ran a Symposium in 1941-43, 'Is the Doctrine, of Instincts Dead?' But in fact this re- presented in turn the peak of the reaction and since then the pendulum has swung a considerable way back in favour of instinct theory, granted in a revised form. A very full account of this is given in Ronald Fletcher's book Instinct in Man, 1957. His conclusion on the early instinct doctrine is as follows: 'This review of the criticisms which emerged against the doctrine of instincts shows that none of them was seriously damaging. Many were directed against the work of McDougall alone, and this concentration of attention on McDougall was unfortunate, since other writers on the subject avoided some of the careless statements which are to be found in his work and which give impressions which, almost cer- tainly, he did not want to give.' 1 However, even McDougall is largely vindicated, and if this is a just estimate Nunn's stock also rises as com- pared with an assessment of twenty years ago.2 Fletcher goes on to demonstrate the support given to instinct theory by the recent work of Lorenz, Tinbergen and others in Comparative Ethology, and also by the developments of psycho-analytical theory since Freud. Fletcher then attempts a statement of the contemporary theory of instincts which substantiates the early doctrine in large measure but does modify and amend it at certain points which happen to be crucial ones for our current evaluation of Nunn's work. Nunn's concern, like McDougall's and Fletcher's, is to provide an adequate psychological base for the social 'sciences'-education being considered as an application of social science. Nunn's treatment, as was hinted earlier, of the nature of the relationship between individual and society is therefore crucial. Now the fundamental factors for Nunn the theorist, as distinct from Nunn the teacher and man of practical affairs, are biological factors. It is indeed, as he says, 'profitable to seek help from the "biological view" of human life.' But as R. R. Rusk points out,3 he not only derives help from but allows himself to be dominated by biological conceptions, not recognising any change of gear in passing from animal to conscious life and regarding cultural facts and values as belonging to the same order as the biological. Nunn does indeed, both in his epistemological dis- cussions and in Education, at various points indicate his awareness of this problem; but he prefers to insist that there is no difference 'in principle' but only in richness, variety and subtlety of detail between the lives of 1 Instinct in Man. London, 1957, p. Io7. 2 Nunn was aware of the behaviourist line, mainly as presented by Watson. He thought, typically, that it gave 'strong and welcome support to the position taken up in these pages' but cannot go all the way, etc. There is no reference to the work of Ruth Benedict or Margaret Mead in the I945 edition: Nunn was ill and living in Madeira in the years following his retirement in 1936. 3 Philosophical Bases of Education.

The 'only' here certainly weakens his case. 'Society' appears in Nunn's scheme in two contexts. In the first it is something outside the scope of his basic theory. It certainly cannot be said that Nunn undervalued social influences and the claims of society on the individual. He gives these full weight at many points and with many illuminating examples in his book. But for the most part he seems to be speaking here as a man of commonsense and a practical teacher, and outside the context of his main thesis. Social factors provide the necessary limiting conditions within which man's assertion of his in- dividuality must operate. In terms of commonsense we shall not quarrel with this; on the practical side Nunn's book is an eloquent and useful exposition of how the basic assumptions of the 'progressive' or 'new' education can be applied in sensible and eminently practical ways. As a protest against many of the sterile and mechanical practices of 'traditional' education, whether in the elementary or public and grammar school contexts, it was timely in 1920 and contributed in no small measure to the changes in the social climate and atmosphere, in the relations between teachers and pupils, as well as in content and methods of teaching which have taken place in the last forty years. But we cannot account for these very changes without giving a priority to social factors, to changes in social conditions and the attitudes and values associated with these. In his practical comments, as in his own practices, Nunn implicitly acknowledges this priority; but it is not derived from his basic theory. Society does, however, appear, in another context in his thinking, as a derivation from his biological assumptions. Society is seen as a result of the operation of the herd-instinct or gregarious tendency. 'Social life, created and sustained by the gregarious instinct, is thus the primary school of morals in which all men are formed.'1 'The social instinct, we have said, begins its finer work as adolescence approaches.'2 Now it happens that the social instinct is one of the concepts of early instinct theory which has stood up least well in the light of later investigations. Tinbergen asserts there is no such thing, in the sense in which it is usu- ally found in psychological literature. There are no special activities that can be called 'social' that are not part of some other instinct. Certain instincts can be said to have their social aspect when another member of the same species is part of the adequate stimulus situation which the animal tries to seek through its appetitive behaviour. Freud's view is in support of this. He sees the genesis of social feeling in the early family situation, in sibling jealousy and the need to minimize the danger 1 Education, p. 195. 2 Ibid., p. 197.

On the human level then, if we wish to account for the behaviour which is most distinctively human, and this certainly includes education, we are forced to the conclusion that social factors, both logically and psychologically, are prior to the individuation factors. This certainly does not invalidate Nunn's claim that 'the primary aim of all educa- tional effort should be to help boys and girls to achieve the highest degree of individual development of which they are capable.' 1 But if the claim is sound, it is because it can be validated in terms of the system of values which are seen as fundamental in a particular society. Nunn cannot state this explicitly because it would have meant a radical modi- fication of the naturalistic theory to which he had committed himself. His implicit awareness of it is in evidence at many points in the develop- ment of his argument in Education, and most fully in one of his last public lectures, delivered at Birkbeck College in June, 1939.2 This will repay study; not only for its succinct relating of his epistemological theory to his psychological assumptions, but also because he goes on to develop his views on university education. He notes the ambiguity in the term 'individual', and resolves it by defining individuality as 'creative self- assertion, seeking its way into reality and laying hold upon it... the belief which justifies university education as we practise it is that the activities contributing the highest values to individuality are those that in the long course of civilisation, have carried men farthest into the heart of reality.'3 The use of the term 'highest values' here surely implies equal status, if not priority, for social factors. The qualities of Nunn's mind which so impressed his colleagues are epitomized in this lecture; the easy and lucid management of ideas, the urbanity, the occasional flashing metaphor, the breadth of his interests and references, the wide ranging over the field of 'the activities which have carried men furthest into the heart of reality', the intellectual zest and enthusiasm, the practical commonsense. Like all men, he also had the defects of his qualities and as it happens these show most clearly in his best known work which, because of its missionary nature perhaps, encouraged their expression. In Education, he is more concerned with synthesis than analysis, with finding support for his main thesis rather than with subjecting it to negative testing. It would be unfair, of course, to criticize him for not bringing in data which were not available at the time of writing of the first two editions; and it would be unkind to criticize him for not making more use of what was certainly available by the time of the third edition: for he was then ill and in retirement abroad. But it is fair, I think, to wish that more of Nunn's undoubted capacity for original thinking and rigorous analysis had gone into this book. As it is, his most original work is now buried in the relative 1 Education, p. 5. 2 The Tenth Haldane Memorial Lecture, 1939. 3 The Tenth Haldane Memorial Lecture, I939, pp. 1i8-9. 73</page><page sequence="17">SIR PERCY NUNN: 187O-I 944 obscurity of the proceedings of learned societies.1 These qualities were also expressed in his teaching, particularly in his methods courses. One reminiscence, indeed, suggests student awareness of the defects in his Principles lectures. 'A present member of staff, then a student, suggests that fundamental philosophy was absent from these lectures, that the personal challenge of contrasting views was not presented. The students accepted what they understood, and were not prepared to discuss. It is certainly true that an early attempt to organize regular principles dis- cussions died on the second meeting. For most students Nunn's lectures on the teaching of science and mathematics were far more stimulating than his handling of educational principles.'2 This seems to suggest that any effective 'discussion' of educational principles must arise from a direct consideration, in a philosophical and social context, of systems of values. The attempt to derive educational principles from biological and psychological data alone is doomed to failure; the values on which the principles rest will either appear as extraneous to the system or else they will be 'smuggled in'; Fletcher, in his restatement of the case for in- stinct theory, writes: 'The social facts to which we are referring, whilst exerting a constraining influence upon individual personalities, cannot themselves be adequately explained in terms of being 'derived from' individual personalities. Whilst having their psychological effect, social facts cannot wholly be explained in psychological terms and require a different kind of investigation at the sociological level.' 3 To put this another way, we might say that the basic concept of 'development' being biologically derived, though a valuable corrective to the traditional educational notions of 'moulding' or 'training', is an inadequate description of the basic process involved in education. It is open-ended as far as the social factors are concerned. The notion which succeeded it, that of 'adjustment' does emphasize the shaping influence of society but suggests a society that is static and rigid; we need a term which can give equal weight to the individual's influence on society and society's on the individual, which reflects the interpenetration of one by the other. The term 'assimilation' might serve; it suggests an active process and faces both ways; a society has to 'assimilate' the individuals born into it as helpless, dependent infants; equally, the individual, as he grows up, has to 'assimilate' the society, or those aspects of it which come his way or which he can reach. Arriving at the 'First Principles' of Education involves, then, an equal consideration of psychological, sociological and philosophical 'data'. The problem of relating the data from these three fields is no 1 'The first, in England, to formulate the characteristic doctrines of the New Realism was T. P. Nunn.
