<plain_text><page sequence="1">Qualia CLAUDE IMBERT Translated from the French by Neil Landers From within the shelter of a juridical and formalist rationalism, we similarly construct ourselves an image of the world and of society where all difficulties are subject to an artificial logic, and we do not realize that the universe is no longer composed of the objects of which we speak. Claude L?vi-Strauss, Tristes Tropiques Upon returning from New York, L?vi-Strauss hesitated. Would he choose a new field? Oceania was conceivable. Would he provide a sequel to The Elementary Structures of Kinship (1949) that could contend with some of the more complex structures evoked in the dissertation? Such a project would have been a link in a chain ca pable of connecting to our own civil organizations, and its aim would have been sociological. Elaborated over a dozen years, his choice was entirely different, and the nature and consequences of this decision are still poorly understood today. It is true that there was no place for it in the geography of fieldwork, nor was there one to be found on the map of acquired knowledges and disciplin ary practices. The moments of his decision were decided in several steps, wherein new questions and means of reaching their solution were</page><page sequence="2">42 QUI PARLE FALL/WINTER 20 8 VOL.17, NO.I mutually implicated. And all of this was carried out as a funda mental experiment of thought (exp?rience fondamentale de la pen s?e), whose tone and formula Cavaill?s, speaking of mathematics, had set in 1938.1 We hear from L?vi-Strauss the same diagnosis, that of an intellectual decline in Europe, its incapacity to locate new places of knowledge, and nonetheless the certainty that there is still time to take up other virtual or available paths and that it is urgent to do so. After a "Picture of French Sociology in the 20th Century" focusing on the Durkheimian school, L?vi-Strauss analyzes the work of Mauss. There is a clear distinction between the latter's fidelity to a kind of critical thinking and those little known writings?scattered, troubling, and audacious?in which he deals with magic, psychology, and the most everyday behaviors and gestures. L?vi-Strauss reflects on the specificity of the human sciences when they are solicited by ethnographic findings. A semi nar held at the ?cole pratique des hautes ?tudes drew its lesson from the obstacle Mauss had run up against. Totemism Today and The Savage Mind, both published in the same year (1962), were its first results. Proust said that Flaubert's use of conjunctions and the imperfect and preterit tenses had done more to transform our vision of the world than Kant and his categories. We could transpose the same conclusion to what L?vi-Strauss accomplishes, beginning with The Savage Mind. But the comparison also can bring out the whole of the difference. Regarding the grammatical transformations experi mented with by Flaubert, Proust could conclude that they had vic toriously defied the ambition of a critical phenomenology and the logical a priori formulas of experience.2 He himself obtained new syntactical dimensions through grammatical deformation in open ing up atemporal figures of "involuntary" memory from the nar rative and by interrupting the discursive chain through embedding and sequencing adjectives extravagant enough to brave the rhe torical economy. But the figures of quality in which L?vi-Strauss is interested are not to be inscribed at any point in grammatical chains of propositional statements. He does not rival Kantianism but ignores and moves past it. Quality ceases to be a category, at once, that is, a form of assertion annexed to verbal syntax and</page><page sequence="3">Imbert: Qualia 43 a predicate for the object, delivering a phenomenological introit to some reassuring ontology.3 It was enough to touch upon a sin gle but essential link in the transcendental logical system?its first category?in order to suspend its habitus and liberate clusters of differential qualia, where a wholly other mental economy is artic ulated. This widened perspective, unexpected and decisive, liber ated another logical possibility, rehabilitating a way of constituting with consistency other sch?mas of intelligibility and varying them according to other syntagmatic chains. This other logic would be opposable to the one Kant called classical, which had entrusted its descriptions, inferences, and causalities to a predicative syntax subjected to propositional diseursivity. Was a logic necessary? There were negative reasons for one, namely, to liberate the human sciences from the Kantian vulgate. And there were positive reasons?those due to the establishment, in place of experience, of another contract with reality, and which were slowly refined between The Savage Mind and The Way of the Masks. At the same time that it would be able to dissolve eth nographic enigmas, this logic suddenly reopened certain intellec tual options, none of which are today unwarranted for welcoming these mediations of the real and the mental whose absence nour ishes, if not defines, barbarity?an absence that could no longer be masked by the philosophical alibi of the crisis of knowledge. The postwar situation had redoubled the opportunity to understand our destitution, of which L?vi-Strauss's generation had the most acute awareness.4 The negative reasons can be stated quickly enough. They are the result of conclusions through which the Durkheimian school had shown its own gains and hindrances?the two faces, in fact, of its project. Durkheim and his school had given sociology a con ceptual apparatus that made it the rival of philosophy and earned it a hard-won recognition in the university. In this, Durkheim's so cial philosophy laid claim to the same Kantian meta-language of experience and its conditions as did its rivals and peers. To treat social facts as things was still to frame the social through facts and statements; this description was implicitly lined with a predicative analytic linking the thing to the conceptuality applied to it and</page><page sequence="4">QUI PARLE FALL/WINTER 20 8 VOL.17, NO.I to a subject that assumes its representation. Whether this was an individual or collective subject was a secondary debate. An epis temologica! position was being challenged: Observation, which was supposed to be as transparent as a clear glass, was revealed to be most often, in ethnographic fieldwork, the convention of a dis play window. Mauss had attempted to circumvent a difficulty he had doubtlessly perceived. All of his personal works and projects brought to light modalities that factuality could not account for and that identified the social: hence prayer, sacrifice, and then The Gift, in which Mauss reconfigures the formulas of Kantian moral ity with the triple obligation of exchange?to give, to receive, and to return. He drew this from the paradigm of the laws of nature, which the Kantian architectonic had never denied. These primor dial modalities indeed structure exchange as a total social phe nomenon, and this configuration is attested by archaic law. It was through the latter that an account could be given of the transition between those societies?the proper object of ethnography?that have no codified formulations of it (but only practices) and mod ern societies. The chain was fragile in that, lacking an avowed law or just a suggested one, Mauss had to borrow from an indigenous theory the controversial notion of mana, which seemed to him to inscribe the modality in the exchanged thing itself. In this there op erated, in accordance with a long-trivial Copernican turn, a com mutation between the modality of the thing and the modality of judgment. The sources and informants may have been called into question, but Mauss nonetheless retorted with a criticist analytic, but he took to the letter its juridical terminology and returned it to its anthropological origins. Ten years later, he had inscribed the notion of the "person" along the same trajectory. Drawing away from the philosophical absolute of a subject, the person touched at one extreme the practices of rites and masks and at another the sober grammatical economy of a transcendental subject (moi) in which the person pronounces itself in a situation of exchange and is declined in modalities. In this anthropological series, Alexandrian Stoicism was a mediator as much as Roman law. These recurring modalities lend their unity to Mauss's research, from his work on prayer and the essay co-written with Hubert on "Sacrifice" to The</page><page sequence="5">Imbert: Qualia 4 5 Gift, and up to the anthropology of an obliged subject. But just as much as The Gift, which had both earned French anthropology its notoriety at that time and brought Mauss invitations to speak in its name, this lecture retained the husk of his method. The obstacle indeed lay in the acceptance of a framework of experience that had been imposed as a universal epistemological meta-language and well identified in its juridical protocol. At this price, the human sciences had won recognition as such, without renouncing what they were banking on in the practical ends and juridical exposition of Kantianism. However, The Elementary Structures of Kinship also left a remainder: not what L?vi-Strauss called a development of the structures (and that was in fact given by Fran?oise H?ritier) but what he had in the last resort systematized and exposited by means of a transformational algebra that had been requested of Andr? Weil. An anthropological finding was au thenticated by a mathematization that dealt efficaciously with the data even while making itself foreign to the very thing the anthro pologist had hoped to understand in its knowledge and practice. Veiling it, though, was an external conceptualization comparable to the symbolic forms through which Cassirer arranged Kantian conceptuality. But general epistemology had not been affected by it. L?vi-Strauss might not have discerned in Mauss and Durkheim the accepted limits of their Kantianism, had he not himself suffered its effects. Briefly stated, the concept had yielded to the structure, and its capacity to cover an empirical field was sought in the cy cle of a transformation group. Were we to give up on recognizing therein a Kantian conceptualization and the invariant logic from which it derives, it would then be necessary to admit of some still misunderstood affinity between a transformation group and the way in which the circulation of sisters and spouses is thought and represented. Other obscure shores are evoked in Tristes Tropiques, where there is mention neither of the New York years nor The Elementary Structures of Kinship, as if, in 1955, this particular laboratory still remained open. It was more urgent, and certainly good methodol ogy in this book, to take up what had proved an obstacle to ethno graphic work, and to put off until later determining how to remove</page><page sequence="6">46 QUI PARLE FALL/WINTER 2008 VOL.17, NO.I it. Certainly, a first difficulty lies in the deterioration of the field, insofar as ethnography approaches populations whose integrity is more severely affected and who are more deprived and stripped of their culture. But this did not prevent the pursuit of Amerindian ethnography, albeit for populations better armed for survival and sufficiently able to borrow from the techniques of the colonizers. Rather more serious, the ethnographer's field notes seem to be missing something that is de facto refused, just as the best photo graph always lacks what is excluded by the very nature of the sen sitive plate on which it emerges. Something that was not even to be found among the basic tenets of the ethnographer's manual, whose limits L?vi-Strauss had felt as a challenge from his first contacts with the Indian populations. Thus the fact that the photograph, a document in itself complete and produced by the best available device, could not dissociate any more than the ethnographer's eye a face painting from the provocative seduction of a visage whose charm is accentuated by it. Whereas a Caduveo woman masters this graphism as easily as she does perfectly. In no way subjugated by the icon of a face that she has known since childhood how to make up, unmake, and remake, she reproduces on the flat surface of a sheet of paper these spirals for which L?vi-Strauss solicits an other sensory experience and other memories?cosmetics or the personages on playing cards?without ever putting his finger on what he vainly sought in the outskirts of heraldry, symmetry, spec ular images, and resemblance. This doubt about representation will be as powerful as the eschewal of narrative and its descriptive manners. Reciprocal elements of the same system, they will give way together. As for the positive reasons that would in the last resort decide for a logic of the sensible, they would be specified as they were tested throughout the four volumes of Mythologiques and The Way of the Masks (1975). (Is there any need to recall that no logic has ever had legitimacy other than in verifying its pertinence and refining its sch?mas and rules, albeit through as many theorems and axioms as needed?) But the determining motifs are to be found in Tristes Tropiques, and the principles are sufficiently explored in The Savage Mind.</page><page sequence="7">Imbert: Qualia Departure and Return Tristes Tropiques weaves together two voyages to better bring out, as though by double exposure, the purely mental itinerary whose opportunities, recoveries, and necessity are found with in them. Without this, the book would have been an admirable narrative?exceptional in its substance and astonishingly com plex?but of a genre exorcized more than once over the pages. The paradox it upholds is declared on the first page: "I detest voyages and explorers." So it is not a matter of these, but of the reasons for this distaste. The reader is not long fooled. Just like Malebranche reading Descartes and L?vi-Strauss reading Mauss, a generation?mine?had its hearts pounding while learning through this careful confusion of the narrative, and by reading at the same time his scientific texts, that it was still possible, and how, to think otherwise. The two departures merge two moments in a European history that was brutally reversed in less than ten years, and that perhaps released its truth in its final episode. In 1935 L?vi-Strauss leaves for the Americas on a scheduled transatlantic line; in 1941 he takes one of the last boats for the United States. The first departure had its figureheads. The philosophy agr?g? heads for the United States, sure of escaping the intellectual stagnations of Europe by draw ing directly on resources that are his own, but that can no longer be valued there. He commemorates an event, as if an event were enough to break through a mental confinement cemented into his tory. On the boat he defies a culture that has become colonialist and petty with this nonprayer on the Acropolis: The deck of a ship bound for the Americas offers modern man a finer acropolis for his prayer than Athens did to Renan. No lon ger can we worship, as he did, the anemic goddess of a confined civilization. Over and above those heroes?navigators, explor ers and conquerors of the New World?who (before the era of journeys to the moon) undertook the only total adventure open to man, my thoughts turn to the survivors of a rearguard which paid so cruelly for the honor of keeping the gates wide open. I mean the Indians, whose example, through Montaigne, Rous</page><page sequence="8">QUI PARLE FALL/WINTER 20 8 VOL.17, NO.I seau, Voltaire and Diderot, enriched the substance of what I was taught at school. Hurons, Iroquois, Caribs and Tupi?I was now on my way to them!5 He espouses Montaigne's regrets: things could have gone entire ly differently if, instead of opening the way for the conquistadors, Columbus had embarked with some Themosticles or Chrysippus, men of justice and integrity, trustees of the reason planted in the nature of things. Stoicism kept intact its power of protest and its virtue as norm. Reactualized by Rousseau and a few others, it held a promise of civilization that Montaigne and Mauss had certified. This first voyage concludes with an unfinished Stoico-Corneillian tragedy, "The Apotheosis of Augustus." The protagonists, Augus tus and Cinna, represent the two branches of an apparently clear choice. In Weberian terms, the savant and the political are opposed in it. But the choice loses its obviousness as soon as the political displays affect as well as reasons of state. Augustus waivers, but then retracts everything at the last minute, because no one resists the supreme drug, apotheosis, even if this is an exaltation by the sole rituals of power. This view, entirely Baudelairian, was already the lesson of modernity's Artificial Paradises. The characters have lost their conviction. Augustus is as disabused as he is cunning; Cinna, the explorer hermit, rigs his choice the moment he realizes that a situation he thought to be Cornelian simply turns out to be Sartrean. Stoicism begins taking on water. He had conceded two essential points: his pretense of being able to formulate the choices imposed upon him and to hold to his decision, but also his ca pacity to channel this intoxication with the world over which the two protagonists in fact challenge each other. A sobered Cinna is threatened with taking to the dreariness of Parisian salons, or with being obliged to pay the price of returning?an officium in some provincial lyceum, the very kind from which L?vi-Strauss will be expelled in 1941. The second departure occurs after L?vi-Strauss escapes the Nazis, and follows a boat of emigrants, a sordid cargo, and its lot of both physical and moral humiliations: packets of notes and a few books, including von den Steinen's, fill up his trunk.6 We know the peripatetic route up to New York. The return road, however,</page><page sequence="9">Imbert: Qualia 49 ran west, through Asia and India. L?vi-Strauss stops in Taxila, at the place where Alexander concluded his march toward the East. A Greek city was founded there that was important enough to have established the equivalent of a university. Later Apollonius visited a temple of Zoroaster there, bearing witness to a Persian presence. Buddhism had been established a bit further up the valley. The site, which bears a Sanskrit name, still holds the site of Muslim worship. With the exception of Christianity, all the influences which molded the Old World come together here. Distant springs have mingled their waters. I myself, a European visitor meditating on the ruins, represent the missing tradition. Where better than on this site, which offers him a microcosm of his culture, could an inhabitant of the Old World, renewing the link with his past, meditate on his destiny? (TT, 396) The prayer on the Acropolis gives way to a questioning, be fore a puzzle whose pieces do not fit together. History confirmed the limits of Hellenism. There is conflict, or mutual ignorance at best, between a Muslim intransigence "incapable of tolerating the existence of others," the ascetic benevolence of Buddhism, and the Christian desire for dialogue. L?vi-Strauss meditates on the Buddhist mastery of sensibility and the missionary exhaustion of Europe, both arrested by the brusque hardening of Muslim reli gious dogma. This paralysis won in return a Europe caught up in the provocation: crusades or Reconquista. If the smile of Alexander was indeed advanced all the way into Asia, having been carried by Buddhist sculpture (which L?vi-Strauss grants Malraux) while changing mediums, it inverted its meaning. L?vi-Strauss attempts to understand India and its exceptional history without the aid of texts and languages he neither reads nor speaks. While he visits Delhi, India slips away from him and reconfigures under Mogul architecture the villages where the old city and the new city are distributed, the temples, and English-style urbanism. Nearby, the Taj Mahal submits a stone architecture as light as a nomad tent to a decorative overstatement. In the most admirable of sites, L?vi Strauss detects, as though constrained by the tourist's roaming</page><page sequence="10">5&lt;D QUI PARLE FALL/WINTER 20 8 VOL. I'7, NO. I gaze (which is also his lot) the origins of the Orientalism that fed European kitsch sensibilities around 1900?"the West's Hindu pe riod" (TT, 398). India reveals to him what she had imposed in return upon her last conquerors: an Orientalism overdone for a European sensibility that masters neither its tastes nor aversions, in the manner of the Esseintes: In formulating this thought, I was not blaming India for building temples that looked like brothels, but rather blaming our civili zation for not providing any other place where we could assert our freedom and explore the limits of our sensuality, which are the very functions of a temple. (TT, 398; trans, mod.) Taxila was the conclusion of Apollonius of Tyana's march to ward the East, whose story was written by Philostratus two cen turies later. Apollonius, conversing with an Indian sage, had been astonished by the polymorphous and animal representations of divinity. In this narrative, filtered by Philostratus, the obstacle is not languages?Apollonius having the gift of understanding them all?but the representation of the gods, the pact struck between nature and men, which Greek anthropomorphism strictly offered. The conversation is reported in the sumptuous Stoic language of Philostratus, which had grammaticalized its naturalism so well that it always expressed it without ever speaking of it. It opposes to Hellenism another limit. The Greek West had missed its chance, not to diffuse its statements?that happened later?but to vary its regimes of representation and at the very least to understand the singularity of its own management of the sensible. If languages and civilizations encyst over their statements, images work the other way around. They sow doubt, rivaling each other in intensity, playing the heads and tails of their meaning with an enviable liber ty, having no scruples in rewriting themselves over each other and ranging through every degree, from the vulgar to the exquisite. The sojourn in India concludes on a visit to a kyong, an age less Buddhist sanctuary, on the outskirts of a Mogul village in Chittagong: "[A]ll these things helped to bring me closer than I had ever been before to my idea of what a sanctuary should be like. 'You need not do what I am doing,' my companion said to</page><page sequence="11">Imbert: Qualia 51 me as he prostrated himself on the ground four times before the altar, and I followed his advice. However, I did so less through self consciousness than discretion" (TT, 411). This missing India?covered over by so many incompatible im ages, abundant and rival styles, so many superimposed civiliza tions?elicits from L?vi-Strauss a sensory acuity that puts him on guard. If the texts are not accessible to him, the temple, street, clothing, and market allow new conjunctions and new commerces to filter through, indexed by sensory contrasts that the West mis understands, annuls, or deflects. It congratulates itself for having entrusted all its intellectual capital to a regime of monotone ex perience that is, as Kant took pride in saying, closed and finished. The kyong confirms, after Taxila and Delhi, what the unfinished Stoico-Corneillian tragedy had said. The choices are no longer evi dent. Buddhism only reaches our culture under the most impover ished compromises, like exoticism and nihilist asceticism. But this time L?vi-Strauss concludes. A project emerges of not letting oneself be carried to extremes. At the kyong, he did not bow, even though he had gladly "paid homage to the decisive wis dom [of] a thinker ... to which my civilization could contribute only by confirming it" (TT, 411). Just as he does not give in to the razing of differences or the sensory asceticism this involves, nor would he repeat the nihilist lesson of the West, whose terms he knows quite well: "What is the use of action, if the thought guid ing it leads to the discovery of the absence of meaning" (TT, 413)? Admittedly, each renunciation is proud to abandon one meaning to find another. This is true of Buddhism as much as of material ism, which equally ends up abolishing the reasons for acting. What was seductive in Buddhism turned into its opposite: the renuncia tion of any quality that stops meditation, the abolition of sexual difference through shaved heads and uniformly flamboyant frocks, and even the uprooted pineapple plants seen on the side of the road?just as the communities of bonzes, nourished by the village, found themselves confined by ritual exercise and an asceticism that incessantly abolishes difference. As for analytical equations of knowledge, they are by nature devoted to entropie reduction. Anthropology will be its accomplice unless it maintains the plural</page><page sequence="12">52 QUI PARLE FALL/WINTER 20 8 VOL.17, NO.I ity of human cultures, intervening precisely in those areas where the extrapolation of extremes is fomented. The median position is not only our own, the human psyche; it is also the proper place of a fabrication of the intelligible, which alone is opposable to nihilist convergences. The choice this time is between us and nothing. What remains?"adieu sauvages, adieu voyages"?is to detach from oneself (se d?prendre). This unusual term comes from seven teenth-century spirituality; in that diverted sense it is a hapax until it is taken up by Michel Foucault. In other words: to reteach the self (se r?apprendre), through the shared fabrication of meaning. This conclusion, and the work it implies, should have preceded the specific question that stemmed from the residual opacity of Amerindian ethnography, and that was punctuated with this re buff: You do not understand. Hence, The Savage Mind has a uni versal version, and another in waiting, reserved for a few insistent Amerindian singularities. Second Best?Deuteron Ploun So I thought I must take refuge in propositions [en tois logois] and investigate the truth of things by means of words Plato, Phaedo7 Since he had to turn to a few good shadows to get what the sun re fuses, Plato had detached himself (s'?tait d?pris) from the Socratic myth that one can leave the cave. He appeals to the images traced upon water by a geometry of solar eclipses. It is through this that the deuteron ploun is determined, this second best, and a logic that, continuing the same transfer, constrained the sensible to intelligi ble figures, in sch?mas, words, and discursive figures. The Savage Mind is another of these second bests, an experimental text like Phaedo but exploring precisely what Platonism had brushed aside. It is here that L?vi-Strauss leaves the periodization of European history folded back upon itself, where Tristes Tropiques stood. Anthropology had learned a lot from comparative grammar and from the archives of archaic law, enough to dispel any illu sions about the Naturv?lker. Nothing, however, that could not</page><page sequence="13">Imbert: Qualia 53 be thought within a history enlarged with Montesquieu's consid erations, human geography, and what was promised by Mauss's temporal series. The satellite figures did nothing to shake the central schema. Biblical and New Testament hermeneutics and a learned Orientalism had provided sufficient resources for inter pretation, and archaic testimony offered a genealogical buttress. Mauss had brought the paradigm of exchange and its modalities to anthropological comparativism. And still nothing in it could reckon with such incommensurate pronouncements as von den Steinen's formula, which had tried L?vy-Bruhl's philosophical acu men. Enunciative transcription carried the hypothesis of a minimal experience, of an incontestable factuality on which the informer and the ethnographer supposedly agree. It was no less a source of scandal. L?vi-Strauss treats in all its breadth a question he places under the general problem of totemic names. The reframing of the problem (in Totemism) combines a principle of method with a first location of the difficulty. The methodologi cal principle recalls that the social does not precede any symbolic activity without which it would neither be singularized as such nor expressible. It excludes treating totemism first and foremost as an institution?which it may be by way of consequence?or inscrib ing what is forbidden or permitted on the register of modalities of exchange, even if they lend it a mnemonic. The constraint is an effect, one that results from applying to a tacit social injunction an order that it greatly needs but is unable to anticipate or even to conceive. Transcribing totemic symbolism into statements misses and masks what is at stake: a relation to animals, plants, and oth er nonhuman beings.8 A predicative statement imports a typical (typique) analytic, via things and predicated features. It does not allow for retaining differential traits and characters that introduce into the language noun-qualifications that are sufficient in them selves, irreducible to predications, and independent of any other syntax. These noun-qualifications are all the more subject to the domain of another syntax, a cognitive system with which they are in total solidarity. This organization?and this is what a syntax signifies?connects two lives through a homology: the first fixes a finite collection of traits carrying the differential evidence of things</page><page sequence="14">54 QUI PARLE FALL/WINTER 20C)8 VOL.17, NO.I from nature; the second receives by transfer a capacity of distinc tive distribution without the adhesion of marks particular to their first support. The process might be compared to stamping, or to vaccination, which keeps and imports a memory of the virus with out its virulence. The quality, or the qualifying use of what is not classified as a quality in our enunciative habits, functions first by its eminently distinctive and objectifying capacity. And it is a quali fying operation, because it renders visible what otherwise would not be seen. Thus, L?vi-Strauss brings to light a logical principle whose syntax is not inscribed on any discursive form; it is simply tied to a regime of naming, which is no small thing. He devel ops without further ado a system of ethnographic transcription, another means of uptake (relever) that circumvented, at least in principle, the predicative figures held as transparent until von den Steinen's paradox. The question is not to decide if this logical pre caution does or does not respond to the range of ethnographically analyzable totemic customs. At best, it is put to its service. Once the enunciative unity had been discarded, it was still nec essary to produce the right unities under which to regroup the find ings of fieldwork, and that nothing predestines for the Kantian syntheses of apperception. This extension is the proper object of The Savage Mind. L?vi-Strauss applies a comparative method, un der the banner of a concrete science. Here, the indigenous concep tualises evident in the classifications of plants, animals, or natural phenomena bear being compared with European conceptual us ages manifest in botanical classifications or collectors' practices. Thus, the universal categorizations are excluded; those trees used to divide a genus into subordinate species are doubtful and unsta ble; the discursivities are secondary and easily explained. Another comparison confirms a kinship between indigenous practices and our own; it too introduces organizations foreign to our discursive syntagmatizations. If, as Boas notes, it seems myths are only con stituted to be decomposed and formed into other myths, there is nothing here of a discursive coherence resting on sequences pre empted through a predicative protocol. These unstable assemblag es, undone and redone with limited resources, intended to attenu ate existing variations, recall the activity of bricolage. A nobler</page><page sequence="15">Imbert: Qualia 5 5 comparison would not betray L?vi-Strauss's thought. Spinoza refers (in Treatise on Emendation of the Intellect) to humanity's first con ceptual achievements as tools that forge themselves. They improve their performance without ceasing to be at once tools for another use and articles of the immediate. And if it is fitting to emphasize those operations, the comparison in The Savage Mind of art and the scale model will be pertinent. It is more easily admitted that scale models, being opposed to the abundance of sensible dimensions of every order, favor a structural intelligence; in other words, the priv ileging of dimensions that are called intelligible exactly to the ex tent that they are transposable. The elements of a logic have come together, from which the discursive/syntactical operation will have been excluded in favor of unities bringing out other syntheses. Reexamining the homologous sequences that the case of to temism proposes, L?vi-Strauss completes its hypothesis in two ways. He first enriches the minimal, but non-null, semantic that governs homologous series the moment there is a transfer of dis tinctive marks by the use of names.9 Again, an evident fact im poses itself that once again cuts across all societies, including our own: the analogy between culinary consumption and sexual con sumption. This completes and confirms the minimal totemic prin ciple, whose hypothesis would be developed in The Savage Mind. Totemism is not in itself a system of prohibition. Occasionally the totemic animal can be consumed. Its function is to produce a rule by which the prohibitions and preferences (endo/exogamic) may be indexed without any ambiguity. This illustration is particularly seductive when L?vi-Strauss draws a parallel between the sharing of game and kinship relations between those to whom various por tions are preferentially assigned or prohibited. The inedible parts? beak, feathers, horns, etc.?are set aside as emblems of a system of which they are the mainstay. Once again, there are no phenom enologically or ontologically distinguished qualities as such, but a distinctive usage of what, for this reason, would have a qualifying and above all discriminating function. This is why the neuter plu ral qualia was preferred over adhering characteristics, which only acquire their differential character by intervening in series where they function as elements of a palette or as markers of difference.</page><page sequence="16">QUI PARLE FALL/WINTER 20 8 VOL.17, NO.I One more step concludes the definition of the logical function of the homologous series. Once it is admitted that this homology is confirmed by analogy when "culinary" differences encode endo/ exogamic rules, L?vi-Strauss proposes one last refinement of the choice of signs that function by a homology of opposed proper ties, citing the laws of Manu. Here the repeated distinctive trait reveals a primary logical function: a conjunction by complimentar ity: "Those that do not move are the food of those that move, and those that have no fangs are food for those with fangs; those that have no hands are food for those with hands, and cowards are the food of the brave."10 Undoubtedly an ironic quotation: These laws, from an archaic code Mauss often cited, promulgate without any modality the ir refragable reality of a complimentarity. The enumeration indicates in its final step the transfer of this complimentarity to the social, to which it transmits a cruel clarity. The Other Prayer In 1943 L?vi-Strauss, in New York now for two years, publish es in the Gazette des Beaux-Arts an account of his visit to the American Museum of Natural History. He was greeted there by the collection of Amerindian objects assembled by Boas and exhibited according to his instructions. Unlike his visit to the kyong, where the ritual gesture did not take place, L?vi-Strauss experienced an emotion that allies him with the totemic beavers and their imploring gestures?"animals of a superhuman kind ness, joining together like hands their little paws."11 Baudelaire breathes him his words: Stroll for an hour or two across this hall so thick with "living pil lars." By way of another correspondence the words of the poet translate exactly the native term designating the sculptured posts used to support house beams: posts that are not so much things as living beings "with friendly eyes," since in days of doubt and torment, they too let out "confused words," guide the dweller of the house, advise and comfort him, and show him a way out of his difficulties.12</page><page sequence="17">Imbert: Qualia 57 Another correspondence, since it runs deeper, forces the doors of Occidental sensibility and attains the exactitude of successful translation. Outside predication, it induces a syntagm that illus trates a contract with nature under a double propitiatory figure: the totemic pillar that adorns the entryway, both inviting and pro tecting, and the animal figure that spreads its benevolence through disjointed traits, each of which may be associated in diverse ways in other ensembles, introducing in them differences for novel ar rangements. L?vi-Strauss recognizes here "a dithyrambic gift of synthesis." This "other correspondence" revitalizes a Baudelaire liberated of any boudoir Baudelairism, and a syntagmation run ning on another economy of the sensible, a little noticed conse quence of the correspondences, and which the sonnet itself does not neglect to mention in its final tercet.13 The 1943 text where this logic is tested out sees its opening reappear in The Way of the Masks (1975). This Baudelaire, anonymous as an inventor of language and whose name goes uncited, finds himself immersed in another context: "Sharing among ourselves, depending on our available funds at the time, the pieces for sale in New York antique shops?at a time that itself also seems mythical, when these works hardly sparked any interest?Max Ernst, Andr? Breton, Georges Duthuit and I constituted more modest collections."14 This "Boolean" crossing of Baudelaire and surrealism allows a differential objectification of qualities to be obtained; qualities that are liberally redistributed according to the use imposed upon them by each mask. Their uses were so ill-suited to the contours of imi tation that they opened up onto other maps and emblematic ar rangements. If, in doing this, the recent New York emigrants found comfort in this, as well as the elements of other collections, there was a catalogue of syntagms being formed in the process that was as abundant and free as Max Ernst's assemblages. L?vi-Strauss en tered into the generativity of a language and art where the elimi nation of certain grammatical figures called for others capable of being compared to structural substitutions and transformations. There is a dissipation of the strangeness elicited, long before his visit to the Boas collection, by the face paintings of Caduveo wom en, which were at that time intercepted by two indissociable filters:</page><page sequence="18">58 QUI PARLE FALL/WINTER 2008 VOL.17, NO.I the erotic filter and the fascination for the face?precisely what the mask is not unaware of, but rather uses altogether differently, and which it mobilizes as a support for its essential messages. Twenty years after Tristes Tropiques, after the experiment (exp?rience) conducted throughout the four volumes of Mythologiques, which indexed the rules of kinship by way of mythical structures that from their network overshadow a discursive appearance that oblit erates them, L?vi-Strauss had accomplished the task of unlearning himself (se d?sapprendre). He had restored to the sensible its func tion of intensity and commerce with places, objects, animals, and other humans, which, save for an ever-menacing entropie destruc tion, declares these languages foreign enough from our own for Merleau-Ponty to call them "indirect." This time the "you don't understand" is directed toward our behaviors and knowledges that, by so many epistemological revolutions and ruptures, lost trace not of origins?an anxiety proper to anyone who would dis engage from the process of modernity?but of the sensible strata from which they draw their inventions and, by continual symbolic production, maintain their vitality. The intelligence of Northwest Coast masks (which operated as maps, messages, and mediators) was the conclusion of the path of the Amerindian universe, until the moment of its preservation in mu seums and artisanry. The book pauses on the copper plates, where one can still make out the emblematic system presiding over masks and the exchange of complementary goods and alliances. The mar kets and the copper plates struck like coins allow a possible entry into the market universe?our own. Nonetheless, should the myths involute into their impoverished emblems, these latter will resist. A mnemonic affirms its rights in a still living artistic production. They still belong to a universe of traits and meanings, none of which are mere carriers like minted money. They respond to each other as im ages do, holding a dialogue that never disappears into things. Pre- and Postfigurative New York L?vi-Strauss later came back to his stay in New York, stressing the continuity of experience between ethnographic knowledge?</page><page sequence="19">Imbert: Qualia 59 renounced as voyage?and the way he appropriated New York. Here is the major ethnographic trial, in which the ethnographer most literally detaches (from himself) (se d?prend). New situations and place configurations are the very substance of modern life, an other Baudelairian syntagm, whose process is by its very defini tion, and not accidentally, irreducible to experience. New York, its avenues, skyscrapers, updrafts, and parks, all of this is for the im migrant primarily only a landscape, or rather what he must take as one relatable to the landscape economy of his memory. It is there where he has laid down and will modify his overlapping maps of the visible and of movement and learns to orient himself,15 just as Boas's informers appropriated the city by indexing new things with familiar references: brass knobs posted on staircase ramps and fig ures from their pantheon sighted on Broadway. The knowledge that an exiled researcher will seize from New York obviously bor rows other references: the museum, the libraries, and the journeys in search of masks that advantageously replace the purchases made in the Sentier to prepare his first Brazilian expedition. The mask collection, in this case essential for present survival and a labor underway, weighs in more than the exchange of goods or fabrics negotiated with the indigenous populations. All of these detours, voyages, and savages were only preparation for learning an ethno graphic capacity as badly needed for unraveling Amerindian enig mas as for living the present (l'actualit?). Modern life, essentially urban, and the place of the highest values and the strongest emo tions, imposes itself while at the same time being fled from and desired. Neither could it be avoided?except by endlessly repeating neo-Stoic tragicomedies?nor confronted without displacing atten tion and intelligence toward its anthropological threshold: the na ked man is also the man called upon both to unmake and remake himself according to a mobility practiced and taught by the mythic combinatory, as well as by the arts and sciences. This other departure, toward the still-disappearing Americas, is carried out in place, in this city where for a time there reigned an exceptional situation, a world-miniaturization in which knowledge could not help but be cosmopolitan, and which managed to in state what had not been achieved at Taxila. The intersections?of</page><page sequence="20">6o QUI PARLE FALL/WINTER 20 8 VOL. 17, NO. I Shannon, Jakobson, Andr? Weil, museums, and antique dealers? made for an entirely different fabric of civil life, villages, and pub lic places; it has perhaps not yet been grasped that such a tapestry brings together neither the banality of mores nor the civil life that Hegel promised the small German cities, but the effervescence of a process of modernity. To be sure, Claude L?vi-Strauss had made use of very different styles?and their extreme variety is reflected in Tristes Tropiques? but his doubts were only stronger as to the limits of ethnographic narrative. It was worthwhile, but only "provisionally." The intro duction of mathematical structures, at once irreducible to the or der of conceptuality and far from serving effectively as a media tor of indigenous thought, had laid bare the difficulty. Of course, without abandoning mathematical modeling, L?vi-Strauss had sought another logic able to traverse ethnographic findings, grasp ing more, and identifying the Amerindian cycle. But above all, he drew attention to the unrecognized subjacency of our languages, while working against a syntax of experience?that ultimate gram matical negotiation between the mathematical and the discursive, a pale shadow of what Hellenism had accomplished at a lesser cost. Working in opposition, these regimes of differential intensity, insis tent and irremovable, transmit something of psychic effervescence and its codes to the forms of intelligence in which that commerce between the real and our affect is incessantly reinvented?like those tectonic plates that draw the energy they redistribute by floating on an incandescent plasma. We largely owe them the fact that the earth is not a dead planet incapable of drawing on solar energy. Noncontradiction had no place here. It is a syntactic trait linked to the way every demonstration must be linearizable, avoid circu larity, and utilize trees for its decision-making process?all incon testable objectives but bound up with both the administration of proofs that are no longer just signs and to inferences able to link causalities and brave the discontinuities of time. The conscription of qualities was its price and was paid twice over: first through the imposition upon them of a predicative function by which they could enter syllogistic arrangements, and then again when Kant associated with them an intensive magnitude while annulling their</page><page sequence="21">Imbert: Qualia 61 first property of differentiation. Inversely however, a regime of knowledge articulation that proceeds by series?a finite number of repeatable and variable clusters of difference?actualizes another option, which is somehow akin to mathematical processes. Since every intelligence adheres to some symbolic support, it always im plies some transformation of the sensible into intelligible dimen sions. Proust did not deny himself its use for deploying involuntary memory; therein is a reminder of the real's potential, which is re calcitrant to discursive linearity and analytic entropy. L?vi-Strauss's last notes and remarks pointed out other reasons in our cultural history not to neglect (m?conna?tre) this in-between (entre-deux) of qualities, structures, and transformations.16 Hence Poussin's transfigurations, which kept alive a network of myths and images, P?re Castel's harpsichord of colors, Rimbaud's col ored vowels, and Klee's painting. Nothing is made, is invented, or liberates an intelligence adhering to its case without having at tempted, and devoted itself to, the transformation of the sensible into the intelligible. Wittgenstein gave up on making a grammar of colors, since they impose a simultaneity of oppositions and degrees that discursive linearity denies. Do we need further evidence that the regime of psychic differentiations is objectified and maintains structure and simultaneity under the discursive economy? The distaste for filth will not be resolved through the analytic of filth (Plato demanded a bit more from his apprentice, adding mud and hair for good measure). Nor shall we move past it via the in sensibility that the apotheosis was supposed to procure Augustus. The deterioration of sensible qualities that ends in repulsion, the leprous scab that covers, in the words of their last ethnographer, the bodies of the last of the Tupi Kawahib and annuls even the memory of corporeal paintings, the rotting eagles, recurrent in L?vi-Strauss's ethnographic experience to the point of tormenting the cast of his Corneillian project, the nauseating cities, and even the "stench of hides": it all recalls a threat far more immediate than that of an energetic entropy millions of years away, and even more ruinous for intelligence?qualitative entropy. It would be a loss of sensibility through the obfuscation of differences and cul tural leveling.</page><page sequence="22">6Z QUI PARLE FALL/WINTER 20 8 VOL. 17, NO. I Notes .
