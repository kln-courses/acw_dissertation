<plain_text><page sequence="1">JULY, I954 AlIan No. i58 A TROBRIAND MEDUSA?* by E. R. LEACH, M.A., PH.D. Faculty of Archaology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge 158 Objects of the type illustrated in fig. i are to be found in a number of museum ethno- graphical collections where they are variously listed as dance shields, shields and war shields. The type is exclu- sively Trobriand. Published variations include: Finsch (I888), Plate XII; Ratzel (I896-8), Vol. I, p. 236; Edge Partington and Heape (I890-8), Part i, Plate 345; Webster (I900), figs. I3, I7 (the latter also shown in Chauvet (I930), Plate LIII, fig. I9I); British Museum Handbook (I9I0), p. I33; Linton and Wingert (I946), p. I48. Finsch (I888), p. I3, describes the type as already rare; elsewhere (I89I, p. 35) he makes it clear that these shields were at least sometimes used for warlike purposes, as he mentions a specimen in which were embedded a number of spear points. Malinowski (I920) explains these circum- stances: 'Very seldom, and only in the case of very brave and distinguished warriors, were the shields painted. Thus during the last serious war between Omarakana and Kabuaku, in i899, only two or three men had their shields painted.. . . To have one's shield painted was a challenge, since it was a great honour to split such a shield or to kill such a man. Therefore a painted shield attracted many more spears than a plain one, and it was distinctly dangerous to use this form of bravado. One of such shields used in the above-mentioned war showed as many as fifty-six spear marks. The warriors were decorated with exactly the same feather headdress as is used in dancing.... 'One very important factor of warfare [was] . . . war magic.... In each belligerent district there was a family of experts in war magic, whose members handed down from generation to generation the sacred formulx. When all the men were assembled at the chief's bidding in the main village the magician coram publico chanted over the shields so as to impart to them the power of warding off all spears....' Given this social context it seems intrinsically probable that the design painted on the shields was itself of symbolic magical significance, and it becomes a legitimate question to enquire why the design shown on fig. I should in fact be deemed by the Trobrianders to have these magical properties. The design has on several occasions evoked comment, sometimes favourable and sometimes unfavourable, but, so far as I can discover, it has always been taken for granted that the pattern as a whole is an abstraction and non-representational. The following comments may be noted: Finsch (i888), p. I3: 'These rare Trobriand shields are remarkable for the artistic painting (red and black on a white ground) and for the altogether singular design. These shields perhaps represent the most perfect works of painting made anywhere by Papuans.' Haddon (1894), p. 240: 'The shape of the Trobriand shield is very characteristic, sometimes the surface is quite plain. When ornamented the design is simply painted on the smooth and whitened surface of the shield, with black and red pig- ments.' Haddon, in this same reference, states that shields of this type were known as vai ova, but this cannot have been first- * With two text figures hanld information. Mr. H. A. Powell, an expert in the Kiri- winan language, informs me that this expression has no obvious significance. He has never heard it used in any context in present-day Kiriwina. Linton and Wingert (I946), pp. I44f.: 'The shields are ovoid in shape with marked convex longitudinal curvature. On the background of white a strictly symmetrical design composed of curvilinear geometric elements is painted in red, black and yellow. This has the characteristic fineness of all Trobriand work, but although the patterns show considerable variety within a basic design they are generally highly formal- ized and ornate and lack the vitality and verve of other objects from this area.' In what follows two distinct hypotheses are advanced concerning the nature of this design, the second being dependent upon the validity of the first. The hypotheses are: (i) that the seemingly abstract design on the shield is in fact a rationally ordered representation of a winged anthropomorphic figure; (2) that the figure represents a flying witch (Trobriand mulukuausi) and that the reported mythology concerning these beings is consistent with the observable character of the shield design and also the magical function of the design suggested in the above- quoted report by Malinowski. I will discuss these two hypotheses separately. If we exclude the seemingly debased example of Edge Partington's Album all published illustrations of Trobriand vai ova shields conform to the same general design, though details vary. Thus all examples include the feature d in fig. 2, comprising several parallel lines arranged sym- metrically on each side of the shield, but the number of lines varies from two on each side to four on each side. Again, all specimens include a motif a in fig. 2, but whereas in some examples this is a clearly defined face, in others it is featureless. I shall proceed therefore to analyse fig. 2 as if it were representative of all particular examples of vai ova shields. In the key to fig. 2, left, the various design features are listed a-k and interpreted as anatomical details, e.g. a-face, b ears, breasts. At first sight some of these inter- pretations are likely to strike the reader as surprising and arbitrary but the analysis will be found more convincing if reference is made to the more obviously anthropo- morphic figure shown in fig. 2, right. It will then be seen that fig. 2, left, can be derived directly from fig. 2, right, by, as it were, 'folding the paper.' The indications are self-explanatory, but perhaps it should be added that the creature is supposed to have the wings and legs of a flying fox, a creature resembling a bat. Whether this interpretation will be found convincing or not will presumably depend to some extent upon the individual temperament of the reader. It is n6t, I think, a matter capable of proof one way or another. It may be noted, however, that the design in its revised form (fig. 2, right) has a certain resemblance to certain other Melanesian designs, for example Trobriand clubs of the type figured in Firth (I936), p. 96, British Museum Handbook (I925), I03</page><page sequence="2">No. i8 Man JUTLY, I954 Plate VIc (facing p. I26), and Chauvet (I930), fig. I92, and the Solomon Islands shields shown in Leenhardt (I947), p. 44, and in Traditional Art of the British Colonies (I949), Plate XX. If this interpretation of the Trobriand design be accepted, we may proceed to enquire what the figure represents and why it should be an appropriate decoration for a shield. My hypothesis is that the figure is a 'flying witch' and that it is a shield decoration because of the poisonous emana- tions that are believed to be emitted by the vulva and anus of such witches. If this suggestion is correct, the witch design on Trobriand shields had the same logic behind it as the story that Perseus carried on his shield the petrifyingly beautiful head of the witch-dragon Medusa. Our main source of informationl concerning Trobriand ideas about flying witches (mulukuausi) is, as might be expected, Malinowski. The principal references are Malinowski (I9I6), and Malinowski (I922), Pp. 237ff. In both cases he stresses that the Trobriand belief closely resembles that reported by Seligman (I9Io), Chapter XLVII, for Bartle Bay. As a result of his Mailu researches Malinowski (I9I5), p. 648, was at first critical of Seligman's analysis, but for the Trobriand data he seems to have accepted the correctness of Seligman's views. Fortune, who reported oni very similar beliefs current in Dobu, also stresses the close parallels between the Dobuan data observed by himself, the Trobriand data reported by Malinowski and the Bartle Bay data reported by Seligman (Fortune (I932), P. 297).

AN INTERPRETATION OF DESIGNS ON THE TROBRIAND SHIELD Malinowski's report (I922, P. 238) is as follows: 'The orthodox belief is that a woman who is a yoyova can send forth a double which is invisible at will, but may appear in the form of a flying fox, or of a night bird or a firefly. There is also a belief that the yoyova develops within her a something, shaped like an egg, or like a young unripe coconut. This something is called as a matter of fact kapuwana, which is the word for a small coconut. This idea remains in the native's mind in a vague, indefinite, undifferentiated form.... The kapuwana is anyhow believed to be something which in the nightly flights leaves the body of the yoyova and assumes the various forms in which the mulukuausi appears....' The parallel Dobuan belief is that 'if one sleeps touching the legs of a witch a gigantic testicle within her body will FIG. I.

The gigantic testicle emerges at night and is seen, a ball of fire, as the witch flies in mid air'; '. . . the kaiana fire of witchcraft issues from the pubes of flying witches as they go through the night' (Fortune (I932), pp. 297 and 296). The corresponding Bartle Bay belief is in a witchcraft substance called labuni which the witches send forth at night (Seligman (I9Io), p. 640): 'it was said that the labuni existed in and was derived from, an organ called ipona situated in the flank and literally meaning egg or eggs. The labuni was said actually to leave the body and afterwards to re-enter it per rectum. Although labuni resemble shadows they wear a petticoat which is shorter than that worn by the women in this part of the country.' The Trobrianders, like the Dobuans, believe that the flying witches can be seen as fire flying through the night, but the precise source of the fire is not specified and the clothing of the witch is uncertain. Malinowski says (I922, pp. 24If): 'According to some versions, the mulukuausi, that is the witch in her flying state, moves about naked, leaving her skirt round the body which remains asleep in the hut. Other versions depict her as tying her skirt tightly round her when flying and beating her buttocks with a magical pandanus streamer.' If we accept the general hypothesis that our fig. 2 represents a Trobriand flying witch, and that, as a shield design, the pattern is intended as a source of dangerous emanation, it will be seen that the design and the mythology fit very nicely. The exaggerated emphasis given to the anal and vaginal orifices becomes meaningful, and also the fiery red colour of the pubes, and the claw-like character of the arms and legs. The two curious egg-like objects (fig. 2j) are clearly the witchcraft testicles or 'coconuts' (kapuwana). My interpretation of the upper half of the design is perhaps much more doubtful, especially the curious design identification between the 'ears' and the 'breasts' of the creature. It is, however, logically correct that the ears should be strongly emphasized in any representation of a mulukuausi. According to Malinowski (1922, p. 24I): 'By a special sense... 'a mulukuausi' can hear, as the natives say, that a man has died at such and such a place, or that a canoe is in danger. Even a young apprenticed yoyova will have her sense of hearing so sharpened that she will tell her mother: "Mother, I hear, they cry."' Conclusion The interpretation which I have given to an apparently abstract Trobriand design, though highly hypothetical, seems to me to raise a number of points of theoretical interest. In contradistinction to writers such as Boas and Haddon, I hold that the designs of primitive peoples are seldom abstract in any genuine sense. Designs, both as wholes and as parts, usually have a definite functional significance for the artist who makes them. Frequently of course the design element has moved very far indeed from anything that might be described as photographic realism, but nevertheless the 'realistic' element remains. Primitive designs are mostly representational. Given this hypothesis, it is a reasonable proposition to attempt to interpret as func- tionally meaningful designs, such as that of fig. 2, which at first sight seem to be total abstractions. In this case the evidence that can be adduced is wholly circumstantial, since the objects are no longer made and memory of them no longer survives in their place of origin; in other cases, however, investigation of 'abstract' designs for their contemporary functional significance might prove very rewarding. This is certainly an aspect of material culture to which social anthropologists might usefully pay greater attention. The second point of interest is that, so far as I know, no one has previously recognized the 'folding-up' of the human figure (as here postulated) as an esthetic device. It is, however, only the logical opposite of the extremely important xsthetic device of 'unfolding,' which figures so prominently in the art of the American North-West Coast (see Boas (I927), pp. 224f) and which has had a powerful influence on many twentieth-century European artists, including Picasso. The Trobriand technique of 'folding-up' has interesting psychological implications since it permits a graphical representation of the association of ideas. Thus in this case there is a graphical association: ears=breasts; anus== navel; hands-feet; headcheart; vagina womb-afolded flower, etc. The whole seems to provide a sort of Melane- sian Rorschach test which, at the very least, should be of interest to Kleinian psycho-analysts interested in the 'introjection' of 'good' and 'bad' objects through the medium of the witch-mother's breast!
