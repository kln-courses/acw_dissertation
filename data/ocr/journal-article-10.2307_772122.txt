The journey was originally undertaken in order to obtain a check on the curriculum and methods of the Department of Fine Art in the University of Toronto, with particular regard to practical courses and their relation to other parts of an academic program. The curriculum of the Toronto department has been organized during the past six years in response to obvious needs in the cultural and educa- tional life of Ontario, and with little reference to specific prece- dent. Circumistances differed so largely from those of the Eng- lish institutions with which I was previously familiar, that their example would have been quite inadequate as a guide to what might appropriately be undertaken in Canada. It was only in course of time that it became apparent that the Toronto system was approximating a pattern prevalent in the United States. The pattern consists in general of the following elements: (1) A series of historical courses of a more or less critical nature, designed to acquaint the student with the place of the Fine Arts in the history of civilization, and to develop, em- pirically rather than systematically, a refined standard of aes- thetic judgment. (2) A general introductory course, calculated to familiarize the student with the characteristics of a work of art, and fre- quently associated with some form of practice. Though prob- ably a Freshman course (as it is at Toronto), I name it after the historical courses because it is much less well-established in kind, less universal and less stereotyped, and because it is, I be- lieve, of more recent development in the teaching of Fine Art in American colleges, as it is definitely younger in the history of the Toronto department. Courses of this kind have com- monly come into being in response to the need of the majority of students for a more general initiation into the field of aesthetic experience than is provided by the typical historical course. They are distinct from courses in Aesthetics given by Departments of Philosophy, though such courses are usually available (at Toronto they are obligatory) to students majoring in Fine Art. As hybrids of theory and practice, I shall have more to say about some of these introductory courses in a con- sideration of the next and last general element. (3) A variety of practical courses about which it is impossible to generalize inclusively. Such courses not only differ greatly in content and method but, unlike the historical and the intro- ductory courses, they also differ greatly in academic purpose and in their relation to other parts of the academic curriculum. They subserve, in fact, three distinct principal purposes, which I propose to distinguish as the Professional, the Cultural, and the Pedagogic. The Professional Purpose implies that the con- tent and method of the course are determined by a prospective professional practice of the art concerned. The Cultural Pur- pose has immediate aesthetic insight as its aim, without thought of the ultimate continuation of practice in any form or connec- tion. The Pedagogic Purpose is that of teacher-training, content and method being determined by whatever pedagogic theory is held by the staff; usually now by some form of fused educa- tional and aesthetic expressionism. These differences of purpose are generally recognized in theory, though one course may in practice be intended to serve more than one purpose, and though insufficient analysis has as yet been made of the procedures appropriate to each. Of the three, the Professional Purpose, which I shall discuss in this article, is much the rarest. Few colleges of liberal arts undertake the training of professional painters, sculptors or de- signers, or even provide courses which are specifically prevoca- tional, though more is done in this way for architects than for figurative artists. On the face of it, there seems little reason why colleges should add this to their traditional responsibilities, ELEVEN</page><page sequence="2">provided that other means are available for the intending artist to become also a knowledgable miember of society. But facili- ties for general education are rarely provided by professional colleges of art, whose students are considered fully equipped by high school graduation at most, followed by three, four, or five years of purely technical study. At Toronto, the provincial College of Art, which undertakes these professional responsi- bilities without operative relations with the University, has no statutory entrance requirements. Even in the Yale School of Fine Arts the degree of Bachelor of Fine Arts is granted for courses in the Departments of Painting and Sculpture with substantially the conditions I have outlined. At the same time, Yale College recognizes certain elementary practical courses in the School as electives for the B. A. degree, and students who have elected these courses while undergraduates of the College may be granted one year's standing in the School in the event of their proceeding for professional training. They may thus ob- tain both the B. A. and B. F. A. degrees in eight years instead of nine. It is not surprising to find that a very small proportion of students in the Department of Painting and Sculpture are graduates of Yale College, though I am told that some of the foremost painters produced by the School have been of this class. Students of Architecture, on the other hand, can obtain both degrees in six years, a much larger number of courses being recognized in their case by both the College and the School, and here the great majority of students avail themselves of the dis- pensation, graduating with both degrees. The matter of importance is, of course, the availability not of a double degree, but of a liberal education combined with and illuminating a full technical training. Of institutions I have visited, the Department of Art of the State University of Iowa is making by far the most determined and systematic effort to supply this need for painters and sculptors; it does not under- take the training of architects. The department is a constituent of the College of Liberal Arts, and the B. A. degree may be taken with a major in the History of Art or in Practical Art. In neither of these cases is the curriculum primarily devised for RICHARD GATES Miners: fresco in art building of University of Iowa.

But the Department also provides training for the degree of Bachelor of Fine Arts, in a four-year "semi-pro- fessional course . . . primarily intended for talented artists with a professional interest in fine arts, or design and commer- cial arts." The total curriculum consists of Practical Art, 58 semester hours; History of Art, 12 semester hours; courses in other departments, 50 semester hours, including 6 of History, 12 of English, and 12 of a foreign language. This semi-profes- sional course can be followed by graduate courses leading to the M. F. A. and Ph. D. degrees in which principal credit is given for technical and professional excellence, though additional studies in the history and theory of art, in languages and other subjects outside the Department of Art, are variously required. Once more, the matter of concern is less in the detail of the regulations governing the granting of degrees than in the estab- lishment of curricula calculated to provide both technical com- petence and breadth of organized knowledge. The importance of the system appears to me to lie much more in the curricula for the B. F. A. and M. F. A. degrees than in the admission of excellence in technical and creative art as grounds of claim to a doctorate, though the latter provision has roused the greater public interest. It is a commonplace of art schools that only technique, not art, can be taught, and it is no doubt true that the essential artist, in the restricted sense of the word, acts by virtue of a psychic integration and tension the genesis of which is obscure. But it should also be a commonplace that he does not and cannot act in a mental vacuum, but on the common sensory and ideational material of human experience. This material he cannot but re- ceive, as a member of a more or less civilized community, in a more or less organized form; we live by relatively common knowledge, common ideas and common sentiments, and art, in the broader sense of the term, has reflected these throughout recorded history. The general neglect to provide a suitable lib- eral education for intending artists, during the enormous educa- tional expansion of the past hundred years, has apparently been due, in the main, to two independent but cumulatively effective causes: the survival of intellectual contempt for a material technique whose purpose was estimated as a combination of factual record and sensual pleasure; and the prevalence of a romantic conception of art as a process of emotional and emotive self-expression controlled only by innate genius. Though this is not a context in which to discuss aesthetic theory, it is impos- sible not to notice the relation between the newer developments in artistic education and the revival both of a popular didactic purpose in the figurative arts, and of that search for a symbolic, ordinative idiom, which has characterized the urge to abstrac- tion from the time of Cezanne-I might write, "from pre-his- toric times"-onwards. There is little in kinds of organized knowledge or speculation which has not nourished the contem- porary creative spirit in the material arts. The problem of curriculum-makers, as much in regard to practitioners as to his- torians and critics, is, in fact, to find place for all the intellectual relevants, and to co-ordinate them in an organic educational system. It is interesting to notice that whereas the regulations for the B. F. A. degree at Iowa stress (over and beyond the essential practical courses) the literary, linguistic and historical studies usually attached to courses in the history of art, Mr. Moholy-Nagy's independent School of Design in Chicago ("the American Bauhaus") completely abandons this nexus of the older humanistic tradition and substitutes courses in Physical Sciences, Life Sciences, Social Sciences, and Intellectual Inte- gration by visiting lecturers who are respectively Professors of Physics, Physiology, Sociology and Philosophy in the Univer- sity of Chicago. The difference is in part between; on the one hand, a school of figurative art in which, among other trends, there is exemplified the current revival of interest in the picto- rial quality of events (fig. 1); and on the other, a school of design of functional objects (fig. 2) as parts of an organized environment serving both the material and the aesthetic needs of humanity, as architecture does. But it is also symptomatic of two current types of figurative imagination; the one governed by the anthropomorphic drama common to all phases of the humanistic cultural tradition (fig. 3); the other by the imper- sonal drama of the younger mathematical and physical sciences (figs. 4 and 5). For my present purposes this mutual exclusive- THIRTEEN</page><page sequence="4">ness is less significant than the representative inclusiveness of the intellectual relevants. As I have already remarked, there is little in kinds of organized knowledge that has not nourished the contemporary creative spirit in the arts. The initial point at issue is, in fact, not whether but how the concerted knowledge of contemporary culture can best be related to the developing artist's public and private needs. The two obvious methods are to develop ade- quate cultural machinery in the technical art schools, and to organize technical art schools within the nexus of the liberal arts college. The School of Design in Chicago provides an example of the former procedure, the University of Iowa an example of the latter. Notwithstanding the success of the School of Design, I have little doubt that the example of Iowa will be more generally followed, either by the establishment of new schools or (more probably) by the incorporation of exist- ing schools within an academic framework. For it will gener- ally be easier to organize a new technical unit, or embody an old one, within an existing cultural system, than to attract the necessary number, variety and quality of "liberal" teachers to an autonomous technical unit. But varying circumstances will doubtless determine the nature of future associations as they have those of the institutions we have discussed. One final word of qualification and caution. Though I believe the successful functioning of the arts as an integrative factor in the development of a balanced and organic social culture de- pends on a closer relation between the intellective and aesthetic modes, I do not think it follows that graduation from a college is to be regarded as an essential process or passport either for the ordinary technical designer or professional imagist, or for the rarer creative artist. The integrative function must neces- sarily be fostered at the centres of higher education. But the call for technical designers and figurative technicians will con- tinue to fill the art departments of secondary technical schools. As for the individually creative artist, the professional imagist may be, and usually is, simply a technical practitioner. But once in a while he is a Giotto, a Raphael, or a Rubens; a Daumier or a Blake. For the first three of these, the Church and the courts of princes fulfilled the function for which we now look to a university. But neither of the last two would have been likely to be at home in either a courtly or an aca- demic atmosphere-not even, perhaps, in those of the Univer- sity of Iowa or the School of Design in Chicago. History pro- vides no rule for the production of the strongly creative artist, in either the material or the literary arts. Though the future Poussin or Piero della Francesca may well become, like Milton, a Master of Arts, or even a Doctor of Philosophy, it may ap- propriately be remembered that both Coleridge and Poe were too intractable to graduate, and that Robert Burns, like van Gogh, enriched the world without prospect of matriculation. What we should envisage, in the organization of a closer rela- tion between technical and cultural training, is a means of which the creative spirit may avail itself, not a professional discipline through which every practitioner shall be required or St. Christopher: fresco at S. U. I. Figure 3 expected to pass. Another article by Professor Alford, entitled Practical Art Courses Designed for a Cultural Purpose, will shortly appear in PARNASSUS.
