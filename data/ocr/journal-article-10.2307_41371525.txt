The need for speed is a common desire. Most of us balance our safety with our desires, each determining our own behaviors according to what makes life worthwhile. - Gregg Bordowitz, "The Effort to Survive AIDS Considered from the Point of View of a Race-Car Driver"1 The aesthetics of auto-destruction so prevalent in silent slapstick both reflect the parallel standardization of the automobile and cin- ema, and explore the new urban, familial, visual, and affective struc- tures these technological revolutions ushered in.

Does the generative relationship between film and the automobile accident disappear between the 1930s and the 1960s, or does it migrate to less visible spaces? Working to expand our understanding of the cinematic acci- dent beyond the familiar high points in the visualization of the tech- nological accident - the twenties and thirties (in slapstick) , the risky sixties (think of Abraham Zapruder's film of the Kennedy assassina- tion) ; Ralph Nader's Unsafe at Any Speed: The Designed-in Dangers of the American Automobile (1966) ; the media coverage of the Vietnam War; the release of auto-apocalyptic films like Jean-Luc Godard 's Weekend (1967); and the post-9/11 period - this essay explores how, where, and with what consequence accidents intersect with the media of film and photography between the 1930s and the 1960s, focusing in particular on the complex ways in which the films and the discourses surrounding them within this interstitial period engage and shape the concepts of risk, responsibility, and citizenship in relation to the technological accident. Neither embracing nor condemning speed per se, I go in search of a hybrid auto-cinematic space that includes scientific research, as well as industry-sponsored safety films, to explore how the private car becomes a figure though which to engage the complex question of individual and collective responsibility in the face of uncontrol- lable and sometimes antisocial drives, addiction, and sexual desire. Cinema, Citizenship, and the Technologies of Speed and Safety Paul Virilio has engaged the contemporary accident more exten- sively than perhaps any other theorist. Yet, blind both to the com-</page><page sequence="3">Doing Death Over 319 plexity of the paradigms opened up by the industrial encounter with the enigmatic consequences of unconscious human drives, and to the capacity of cinema and the automobile to forge, as well as destroy, time, spaces, and communities, he completely and reduc- tively aligns speed and cinema first with each other and then with the straight line of progress, with violence, war, "desocialization," and the disappearance of neighbors and citizens.4 In Negative Hori- zon, he writes, "between the audiovisual media and the automobile (that is, the dromovisual) , there is no difference; speed machines , they both give rise to mediation through the production of speed, both are as one since the functions of the eye and the weapon have come to be confused, linked up, since the transportation revolution."5 "The progress of speed," for Virilio, is "nothing other than the unleashing of violence"; speed is only "an extermination."6 Polemi- cally, he links the "liquidation of the world" and the "extermination of the passenger" to the "violence of the first camera dollies,"7 and presents the urban motorway as not "a pathway of transmission, but the concentration camp of speed," a space in which Time is admin- istered and speed comes to replace invasion as "the foundation of the law."8 Technology emerges completely outside Virilio 's concep- tion of "the human," and the intersection of the two seems capable only of a producing a fascist manifestation.9 In the midst of this critique of the violence of speed and move- ment, encapsulated by technologies of transportation and cinema, the collision emerges in two slightly contradictory formations. On the one hand, Virilio employs the French term télescopage to portray collision as "the disappearance of one vehicle into another." Playing on the two meanings of the term - to "examine what is at a distance" and to "mix indiscriminately," Virilio offers the crash as a "mirror of speeds that reflects back the violence of the trajectory on the object and the subjects of the movement." Here the crash functions as a vengeful return of violence to its perpetrators; gradually, the dis- tinction between speed and its termination (the collision, the téles- copage) .between the car and téléscopage as collision, disappears: "The optical illusion of the telescope consists of approaching what is dis- tant in order to examine it, and that of the automobile of mixing indiscriminately what is close and what is distant."10 Eventually, both are folded into the image of the "contraction-collision."11 Prior to this conflation of the crash, the speeding automobile, and telescopic vision, however, Virilio offers another version of the collision in which the crash emerges as a brief (because potentially fatal) movement from passivity to activity, a laying bare of the ideo- logical operations of the apparatus of security, an apparatus</page><page sequence="4">320 Karen Beckman designed less to keep traveling bodies safe than to hide from the pas- sengers' senses the violence of speed: So long as the dromoscopic simulation continues, the comfort of the pas- sengers is assured; on the other hand, when the illusion comes to its bru- tally violent cessation in a collision, it is as if the voyeurs-voyagers are projected like Alice through the looking-glass windshield, a death jump but above all a jump into the truth of their trajectory where the gap between theater hall and the stage collapses, the spectators become actors: it is this fleeting insurrection that the seat belt is designed to prevent.12 The local security that begins with the "corporeal 'packaging' [Vem- ballage ] of the passenger," the mummifying effects of car safety design, result, for Virilio, in a loss of the sense of touch and local- ization, a hiding of "solid reality" under the padding of surfaces.13 And, as the ideology of speed permeates every aspect of life, the dis- course of security that begins with transportation replaces all con- crete "enemies," so that opacification replaces nationalism , the final citizen becoming less active than passive," leaving the new citizen as "a kind of 'zombie' inhabiting the limbs of a devalued public life."14 Undoubtedly Virilio captures the contemporary sense of a col- lective "crash" and disorientation that persisted in the wake of the euphoric liberation movements and antiwar protests of the 1960s and 1970s. Furthermore, he astutely pinpoints the politically para- lyzing effect of the contemporary ideology of security, usefully trac- ing it back to a safety measure as seemingly harmless, or even harm preventing, as the seatbelt, identifying the collision as one poten- tial, if neither permanent nor guaranteed, rupture in the state's security blanket. The relationship he highlights here between car safety and the cultivation of certain modes of citizenship, and his interest in the potential of the crash for emerging theories of sub- jectivity, citizenship, and visual technology at a time of great hybrid- ity and rapid, potentially destructive, change, make Virilio's work an important and suggestive starting point for my own inquiries. Yet, his line of thought can productively be explored and developed only if we begin by highlighting four fundamental limitations of his critical paradigm. First, Virilio's reduction of "cinema" to a singular and homoge- nous ideology drastically underestimates cinema's capacity, as a complex system of sounds, images, and institutional structures, to create, as well as annihilate, time and space, to function in critical opposition to, as well as in collaboration with, the war machine Vir- ilio describes. Though his 2002 exhibition of disaster images, Unknown Quantity , does attempt to mobilize the aesthetic of the</page><page sequence="5">Doing Death Over 321 crash for critical purposes, his Goldilocks-like paradigm of too much, too little, just right, is built upon vast generalizations both about how images have functioned within particular ideological contexts and about how they will function in the present, claiming that liberalism "overexpose [d] the viewer to the incessant repetition of tragedies"; that totalitarianism "opted for underexposure and the radical occultation of any singularity"; and that, in "these early years of the twenty-first century," we will be able, through an idealized notion of "exhibition," "to take what is happening, . . . and analyse it wisely."15 Second, Virilio's teleological and nihilistic narrative pro- ceeds from the assumption that human subjectivity is separable, rather than fully intertwined with, technology.16 His is a narrative of loss: of lost senses, lost citizens, lost agency, lost touch, and lost bod- ies; his nostalgic story tells of the ever-deepening disorientation of a once whole, active, and fully present, and located, man. Whereas, for Virilio, the separation of the subject from the world on screen, or through the car window, is fully alienating and negative, David Rodowick's recent work serves as a useful counter- point to this position. Through his readings of Stanley Cavell, Rodowick insists that the virtual quality of film constitutes one of the essential aspects of the medium's ethical possibilities through the unfulfilled desire for touch and presence that it provokes: "[F]ilm presents to me a world from which I am absent, from which I am nec- essarily screened by its temporal absence, yet with which I hope to reconnect or join."17 Furthermore, within Virilio's nostalgic narra- tive, there is, of course, no Eve in Eden, for Virilio's woman is, from the moment of man's birth, part of the problem, being "the first means of transportation for the species, its very first vehicle."18 And finally, though the translator's introduction to Negative Horizon iron- ically opens with an epigraph from Nietzsche - "We are unknown to ourselves"19 - the inherent human opacity and ontological blind- ness and dislocatedness suggested here is nowhere to be found in Virilio's writing. Women-as-technology and technology-as-woman bear the burden of man's blindness, and, having located in these two figures an essential violence (in which both cinema and the automobile participate), Virilio stretches backward in search of the responsible, located, active, and fully present man. Although Vir- ilio's passionate fear of the total annihilation of the species may work effectively as a call to responsibility, in refusing to allow the opacity and absence of the self as inherently human, rather than as a tech- nologically enforced disappearance, he ultimately negates the very space that makes responsibility and citizenship both necessary and possible in the first place.</page><page sequence="6">322 Karen Beckman Responsibility, Blindness, and Passivity Judith Butler's remarkable rethinking of the concept of responsibil- ity through her creatively intertwined readings of Emmanuel Lév- inas, Jean Laplanche, Theodor W. Adorno, and Michel Foucault, provides us with a useful place from which to start rethinking Vir- ilio's paradigm, for it begins with the assumption that "the very meaning of responsibility . . . cannot be tied to the conceit of a self fully transparent to itself. "20 In contrast to Virilio, for whom the once oriented and actively responsible citizen has gradually been ren- dered disoriented, foreign, and passive by the violence of a speed that Virilio locates in transportation, women, and audiovisual tech- nologies, all of which gradually converge, Butler (following Lévinas) detaches responsibility from the concept of agency altogether and suggests instead that ethical interpellation derives not from an active but rather from a "passive relation to other beings [that] precedes the formation of the ego,"21 a relation that is inflicted upon us by the Other. For Virilio, the crisis of the contemporary moment emerges as a result of the disappearance or disorientation of citizens who are rendered passive by visual and transportation technologies; yet, for Butler, agency and the possibility of responsibility arise precisely out of an ontological space of passivity: "Something drives me that is not me, and the 4 me' arises precisely in the experience of, and as the effect of, being driven in this way."22 Within this formulation, respon- sibility for the Other is not something we choose to enact, against violence, but is rather a condition into which we are unwillingly, pas- sively, enigmatically, and indeed violently born. Yet, in what seems like a paradox, passivity functions in multiple ways. So, for example, to acknowledge the passivity at the heart of responsibility would still involve refusing earlier models of citizenship founded upon the expectation of what Etienne Balibar describes as "the passive enjoy- ment of formal rights" by individuals belonging to members of exclusively entitled historical communities.23 Responsibility here emerges not as a given, but as a zone of ongoing translation, a borderline between self and other, a space of constant encounter between the familiar and the foreign. To live the self as such is constantly to put the known self at risk, but, in doing so, to participate in the forging of a space for a community "of a nonexclusive belonging,"24 a space that demands of its participants an endless engagement with the work of translation and mediation, and in which the existence of conflicting and foreign values, desires and beliefs, is perceived not as a threat to, but as the condition of, collective freedom and security.</page><page sequence="7">Doing Death Over 323 It is for this reason that responsibility, born of passivity but with- out producing passive citizenship, also cannot be understood as a banal and moralistic trait of the one Maurice Blanchot calls "the suc- cessful man of action."25 Rather than countering a technologically imposed disappearance and disorientation of the human, responsi- bility, Blanchot suggests, "separates me from myself . . . and reveals the other in place of me, requires that I answer for the impossibility of being responsible."26 1 am foreign to myself not because the body has been denied by the technologically enforced disappearance of space, but rather because I was never, and can never be, fully pres- ent or accessible to myself in the first place. Driven, occupied, by the Other, a condition experienced by the subject in the form of enig- matic drives,27 the responsible subject does not set out to redeem its losses, but rather recognizes that the work of ethics begins by acknowledging that the responsible subject "has not made the map it reads, does not have all the language it needs to read the map, and sometimes cannot find the map itself."28 For Butler, desire and responsibility emerge from the same unidentifiable place, with the pulsations of the drive alerting us to our enigmatic and "unwilled susceptibility" to the Other, even, or perhaps especially, in those moments when, enthralled or over- whelmed by desires and drives, we act "irresponsibly."29 Yet, for Vir- ilio, who has exiled speed and drive from the heart of the human, desire - always accident prone - must also be banished. The "woman-of-burden" embodies "all the desires of conquest and pen- etration."30 The spool of film, the prostitute, the highway, desire: each of these, for Virilio, constitute "fossils of violence" in the way they drive the subject to movement and confusion.31 Though Virilio is not wrong to identify a relationship between violence and desire, his error, perhaps, lies in attempting to build an ethical system around a subject whom he views as solely threatened by, rather than also forged out of and enabled by, these primary violences. Displac- ing sexuality onto a technologized realm of violence, cinema, and transportation in his efforts to maintain the integrity of the self, Vir- ilio is left not only without cinema and technology, but also, nihilis- tically, without sexuality, too. Auto Safety and the Industrial Sponsored Film The increased prominence of car safety as a topic for public discus- sion in the 1930s, provoked by the publication of popular and grue- some articles like that of historian J. C. Furnas entitled " - And</page><page sequence="8">324 Karen Beckman Sudden Death," which would become the most reprinted Reader's Digest article ever,32 is preceded both by international conversations about modernity and risk, particularly in regard to the question of who would be responsible for the safety of the modern industrial worker, and by the rapid increase in automobile ownership in the United States, which was facilitated by extensively expanded adver- tising and credit campaigns.33 Yet, both the car and cinema seemed to offer alternative, albeit related, modes of engagement with tech- nology to the factory, modes largely framed by consumption and pleasure rather than production and labor. From the early 1930s, acutely aware of cinema's capacity to influence the public's recep- tion of the automobile and of the affinities between the two tech- nologies within the landscape of modernity, car manufacturers funded a variety of film shorts - cartoons, travelogues, newsreels, and educational films about engine design, the search for oil, driver safety, and other car-related matters - and these neglected films become rich sites for exploring the emerging relationship between these technologies and the way their relationship forges modern conceptions of responsibility, risk, pleasure, and safety.34 The gory aesthetic of the driver education films produced by the Highway Safety Institute of Mansfield, Ohio, in the 1960s, which now circulate as cult films through the distributor Something Weird Video - films like Signal 30 (1959), Mechanized Death (1961), Wheels of Tragedy (1963) , and Highways of Agony (1969) - had no place in the highway safety films of the period between the 1930s and the 1960s.35 Yet, in 1935, perhaps in response to the publication of Fur- nas's Reader's Digest article, the question of safety explicitly entered the promotional film genre even though car manufacturers throughout the first half of the century had argued vociferously that "safety doesn't sell." The industrial safety films produced between 1935 and 1959 seem caught between the industry's need to assuage consumers' growing anxieties about danger of the automobile acci- dent and the playful aesthetic that can be traced back to the inter- section of the car accident and the camera in cinema's early years, an aesthetic that demonstrates greater affinities with slapstick, experimental film practice, animation, and fantasy than with the combination of documentary realism and melodrama that will later dominate safety education films. Though we might expect these sponsored works to reflect an oversimplified company line, in the films I consider here, the stated goal of using motion pictures to advocate against contingent, irregular, irresponsible, and thrill- seeking behavior works in tension both with a playful auto-visual aes- thetic, and with the underlying goal of these films - to sell the</page><page sequence="9">Doing Death Over 325 fantasy of the car, in which speed, risk, and the contingency exem- plified by the accident are all central ingredients. The Safest Place ( 1 935 ) In 1935, Chevrolet offers a counterpoint to Furnas's nightmare vision of auto death with a six-minute film, The Safest Place , pro- duced by the Detroit-based Jam Handy Organization, which was founded in 191 7. 36 The film opens by constructing not the car, but the home, as the preeminent space of danger, reminding viewers that four million accidents took place in American homes during the previous year, a statistic that is visually complemented by three comic scenes of domestic near-mishaps caused by a bar of soap on the bathroom floor, toys on the stairs, and a missing step on a lad- der. While the domestic space is established as accident ridden, Chevrolet pronounces the car to be "the safest place on earth": a "solid steel" living room with a "turret-top roof and a rigid steel foundation . . . dependable brakes . . . and . . . safety glass all around." Yet, having established the car as a space of safety and invulnerability, the film goes on to lament the car's real weakness: the fallibility of the driver. Even as The Safest Place constructs a fantasy-mobile that liberates the driver from domestic space, rendering that driver free to enact his or her desires through a technologically enabled impenetrable shield, it simultaneously eradicates the desiring human agent through the introduction of what the film calls the "automatic driv- ing mechanism." As the camera shoots from the car's backseat, we see a steering wheel moving of its own accord, and empty cars mov- ing in an orderly manner through the streets, while a voice-over cel- ebrates the automatic driving mechanism's obedient adherence to the rules of the road at stoplights, road signs, and corners. Prefig- uring the newly secure space of Washington, DC today, the film constructs safety as the disappearance of the human in a landscape populated by machines that never, unlike the human drivers the film bemoans, "make secrets of what [they're] going to do." Attempting to straddle the competing consumer desires for safety and danger, these advertising films make visible the struggle to for- mulate psychologically compelling and commercially effective auto-film fantasies. Made at a moment before the cinematic fantasy of the road had yet to find its generic form, these films oscillate between complex and at times contradictory fantasies that include the male subject's escape from both domestic and industrial space, his subsequent domination of the private technology of the car, and</page><page sequence="10">326 Karen Beckman his complete submission to, or even disappearance within, the tech- nological superiority of the impenetrable car-cocoon. The Other Fellow (1937) Two years after the production of The Safest Place , Chevrolet returns explicitly to the problem of the illegible or split subject as driver in another Jam Handy short entitled The Other Fellow (1937), a visually complex engagement with the permeability of the self and other to which driving, like cinema, seems to give rise. The Other Fellow announces its explicit affinity with slapstick from the outset by cast- ing Laurel and Hardy's slow-burn sidekick Edgar Kennedy (a noto- rious on-screen car wrecker) as the film's only actor. Kennedy plays the part, as the opening titles tell us, of five different drivers: "Edgar Kennedy (played by . . . Edgar Kennedy); Farmer Driver (the same Edgar Kennedy) ; Sport Driver (Edgar Kennedy again) ; Truck Driver (and again Edgar Kennedy) ; and Newlywed Driver (Edgar Kennedy again). During the film, Kennedy has near run-ins with the four other drivers, and each time he blames "The Other Fellow." The film's didactic message is earnestly stated in authoritative tones on a number of occasions - as the philosophical pronouncement of the judge who will ultimately sentence Kennedy declares, "We will all only improve driving conditions when we see in ourselves the other fellow." Yet, this film is most interesting for the way it makes visible the difficulties and sites of confusion embedded within the film's central proposition of rendering the Other legible. First, The Other Fellow makes explicit, in ways that later driver safety films won't, that safety exceeds the control of the self in that safety is always intricately bound to the way we negotiate the relationship of self and other. Furthermore, the film seems to respond to the problem of the Other's illegibility by attempting to erase the Other completely. By casting Kennedy in all roles, The Other Fellow posits safety as synony- mous with sameness and presumes the total transparency of the self. While the film stages examples of the problems that arise from the Other's illegibility in slapstick scenarios, an earnest voice-over instructs viewers on how to use hand signals developed to enable drivers to signal their intentions to one another. Yet, even as The Other Fellow works to eradicate the difference and obscurity of the Other in the name of safety, contradictory impulses persistently interrupt these efforts. Rather than emphasizing the sameness of Kennedy's multiplied selves, as the didactic voice-over would have us do, The Other Fellow ultimately contradicts its own verbal message at the visual level by adopting an increasingly kaleidoscopic, almost surrealist, aesthetic</page><page sequence="11">Doing Death Over 327 that further fragments the drivers' subjectivities and bodies, and elicits in viewers the kind of fractured and multiplicitous vision that analyst L. Pierce Clark identified in 1907 as one of the pathological effects of driving. Clark writes, "The constant glancing by of objects, the sub-conscious dread of accidents, the manipulation of the machinery, conversation with the rest of the party, and a hundred other things make the automobilist's mind a regular kaleidoscope, and he may soon find that all his thoughts come in asjumbled a state as do the colors in a childish toy."37 Counteracting the film's stated goal of avoiding the disastrous effects of driving by rendering visible the Other's every move, the car's intersection with cinema produces bodies and modes of vision that are decentered, abstract, illegible, and polysemous. As the single, signing hand proliferates into multi- ple hands, each one demonstrating a different sign, the viewer's attempt to learn the language of the road is overtaken by a fascina- tion with the visual montage. This interest in form over content and distraction over didacticism is further encouraged when the hands are subsequently superimposed over layered street scenes depicting cars moving in various directions across the screen. Throughout The Other Fellow, the absence of a clear point of view is emphasized through the use of fractured screen space. The film's opening traveling shot emphasizes the driver's divided vision as the camera shoots through Kennedy's windshield, which is split in two by a vertical bar. The film further reinforces a sense of the driver's multiple vision in a later scene where the divided windshield forms the backdrop for the rear-view mirror in which we view the car behind (figure 1). After a three-car collision in which Kennedy shouts at alternative versions of himself, his face appears inside the frame of a General Motors service and travel-record plaque and is then subsequently surrounded by four other faces (figure 2). Fol- lowing this kaleidoscopic image of five superimposed faces, the film cuts back to a close-up through his windscreen of Kennedy, who stresses the accident's fragmenting impact upon his identity by whistling and muttering, "Well I'll be a. . . ." After Kennedy is arrested, he promises the judge that he will put himself in "the other fellow's place," and, as he returns to his car, the split identity to which he has committed himself as a driver is visually registered in a pronounced shadow on the side of the car. Once Kennedy returns to his car, a voice-over articulates the problem of safe driving as a problem of internal foreignness and obscurity, announcing in a formulation that confounds subject- object distinctions, "All of us are the other fellow. And when we all realize that we are the other fellow to everybody else, we'll all keep out of trouble by letting him know what we're going to do next."</page><page sequence="12">328 Karen Beckman Figures 1, 2, and 3. Screen captures from The Other Fellow (dir. Jam Handy, 1937). The subsequent shots illustrate a series of hand signals, yet the clar- ity of each signal, demonstrated by a single hand stretched out of a window, exists in tension with the complex geometric wipes that overlay each individual signal with diamonds, rectangles, and other signals. This abstract series of framed hands gives way to a montage of four free-floating hands, all moving slightly differently in differ- ent parts of the frame, devoid, in their multiplicity, of their sym-</page><page sequence="13">Doing Death Over 329 Figure 4. Screen capture from Hot Water (dir. Fred C. Newmeyer and Sam Taylor, 1924). bolic meaning. Eventually these hands are superimposed both together and individually over a series of shots of cars in the street (figure 3). Just as The Other Fellows proliferation of selves can't help but recall the slapstick multiplicity of a film like Laurel and Hardy's Brats (dir. James Parrott, 1930) , in which the comedy duo play both them- selves and their own children, so the film's central safety message of seeing oneself in the Other leads to a kind of visual schizophrenia in which the unified body of Kennedy fragments not only into a series of roles, but also into a series of parts that act independently of the body to which they belong and seem utterly unaware of the other parts around them. The strangely detached movements of the film's severed hands evoke nothing so much as the mouse-filled glove that crawls before Harold Lloyd's eyes in Hot Water (dir. Fred C. Newmeyer and Sam Taylor, 1924) (figure 4), and the surreal sev- ered hand in the street that attracts the attention of passersby shortly before another car accident in Buñuel and Dali's Un Chien Andalón (1929). While the film's didactic voice-over works to eradicate the elements of risk, difference, and illegibility, The Other Fellows visual landscape offers a divided and fragmented self, one whose right hand seems literally not to know what the left hand is doing. And, as such, the film stages driving and responsibility as a double prob- lem - that of regulating drivers who are at times not in the driver's seat, opaque to themselves and not always capable of signaling what they will do next; and of interpellating consumers under the banner of a safety that is not always desired. Live and Let Live (1947) Continuing the logic of The Other Fellow, Aetna Casualty and Surety Company's postwar safety film, Live and Let Live (1947) similarly</page><page sequence="14">330 Karen Beckman engages the contradictions of automobile safety, again through a disjunction between word and image, and through an equally light- hearted approach to form. While the film's voice-over condemns the careless, the impatient, the reckless, the illegible, and the thrill seekers, and aligns virtue with a state of permanent awareness ('You must never, not even for a moment, relax your vigilance while at the wheel"), at the visual level, it employs stop-motion animation and toy cars and figures to present the road as a scene of play, imagina- tion, and mechanical experimentation, a scene devoid of all human life. Prefiguring the experimental auto-aesthetics of Ernie Gehr's Shift (1972-74) by a couple of decades, Live and Let Live offers views of the road from a variety of angles that distract our attention from the question of road safety. Instead, Live and Let Live employs an aes- thetic more familiar to us from the early years of cinema, inviting viewers, like W. R. Booth's The "?" Motorist (1906), to participate in the topographic approach to film spectatorship celebrated by Noël Burch and, from a feminist perspective, by Guiliana Bruno; that is, to participate in less hierarchized and more decentered modes of viewing.38 Although Live and Let Live attempts to direct our viewing through the use of a didactic and repetitive voice-over, the pleasure and suspense of this film, as with Gehr's Shift , lie in the random mechanical movements of automated vehicles around the space of the screen, in the deviations from predictable movements - the acci- dents - and in the juxtaposition of seemingly proximate sound effects (screeching tires, horns, etc.), which seem to place us inside of one of the toy vehicles, with distant and high-angle images of mov- ing vehicles that appear remote, thereby creating multiple potential viewing positions for the spectator (figure 5). Because the camera captures the miniature vehicles' frantic movements from various positions, the film refuses to establish a stable relationship among the plane of the screen, the plane of the road, and the viewing sub- ject's position. Instead, it offers viewers a series of shots that trace, in a manner evocative of early cinema's fascination with moving objects for their own sake, changing pathways of brightly colored toy cars across the space of the screen - vertical, curved, diagonal, horizon- tal, circular. As toy cars and trains careen around the miniature roads on which only a single humanoid toy driver is visible (a drunk driver leaving a toy bar) , the sounds of real collisions accompany scenes of miniature disaster to comic effect, and the question of crash prevention gives way to a cinematic exploration of crash aes- thetics, including juxtapositions of speed and stasis, variations of camera distance and the direction of movement, and contrasts</page><page sequence="15">Doing Death Over 331 Figure 5. Screen capture from Live and Let Live (Aetna Casualty and Surety Company, 1947). between the linearity of the road and the (supposedly) contingent movement of colliding vehicles. Passive Safety: Hugh De Haven and the Cornell Injury Research Project While the sponsored films I have discussed so far grapple with the problem of the irresponsible drivers and their unpredictable drives, Hugh De Haven (1895-1980), an engineer who headed the Crash Injury Research Project at the Cornell Medical School from 1942 to 1954, and the primary collaborator with Ben Kelley on the produc- tion of almost twenty car safety films Kelley made between 1968 and the late 1980s, disregarded the problem of human subjectivity alto- gether in his accidental motion studies in order to focus exclusively on how to render the human body invulnerable. Although De Haven is almost unknown today, we live today more than ever in the wake of the paradigm of human safety he developed. As Robert Lindsay wrote in a 1970 New York Times article about the effect of Ralph Nader's Unsafe at Any Speed , "Nader did it. He was the catalyst . . . but the real hero of this story is a guy few people have heard of, Hugh De Haven."39 The Hugh De Haven archive of letters, newspa- per cuttings, research reports, press and police photographs, and films reveals the extent to which the automobile accident func- tioned in the twentieth century as a figure of escalating importance for the United States as it grappled with questions of individual and collective rights, public and private space, passive and active security, risk and desire, deviance and agency, freedom, responsibility, and citizenship, and the limits of human tolerance.</page><page sequence="16">332 Karen Beckman Within the field of crash injury research, De Haven is largely notable for shifting the emphasis of research from accident preven- tion to accident survival, an emphasis that he traces back to 1917, when, after enrolling as a cadet pilot in the Canadian Royal Flying Corps, he emerged as the only survivor of a midair collision in Texas.40 Although De Haven had retired at the age of thirty-eight in 1933 to live off income from his patents and inventions, his interest in transportation safety was reigni ted in 1936, when some casual domestic experiments with eggs became the catalyst for the foun- dation of the Cornell Crash Injury Research (CIR) center, dedicated to rendering Americans in motion "deathproof." As a letter to his mother from 2 June 1936 explains, "Dear Mother, While fooling around with one thing and another having bearing on the general thought, I took an egg and dropped it in a series of tests onto a soft sponge rubber mat. . . . Imagine my surprise when I found the height could be increased to ten feet without fracture/41 By 1942, De Haven's research on the human body's capacity to sustain force had attracted the interest and support of the military, the National Research Council, the Civil Aeronautics Board, Cor- nell University College, and the Office of Scientific Research and Development; by 1947, his egg dropping had become a topic of national, notjust maternal, interest. In a front-page article entitled, "Eggs Just Bounce in 100-Foot Drop," the New York Times reports on De Haven's public display of ovular invulnerability: It all seemed very foolish at first. A perfectly sane man with two perfectly sane assistants went to the top of a building 100 feet above the street yes- terday and began dropping eggs off the roof. . . . Passersby stood agape as the fresh eggs came plummeting down, struck the mat, and went bound- ing up above the third floor of the eleven-story building. ... A research group that is studying the mechanical factors that cause injuries in aviation accidents took part in the show. The group is headed by Hugh De Haven.42 The research De Haven and his ironically named collaborator Edward Dye pursued under the title "body kinematics"43 constitutes a continuation both of the early motion studies of Etienne-Jules Marey and Eadweard J. Muybridge and of the self-inscribing appa- ratus of Charles Babbage, an early precursor of the black box designed to graphically record the events preceding the train acci- dent.44 Yet, while Babbage 's apparatus, as Greg Siegel has recently argued, was designed to protect "passengers of the future"45 by recording what Babbage described as the "immediate antecedents of any catastrophe,"46 De Haven's crash tests are not interested in addressing the question of technological failure. Rather, the films and photographs produced in his laboratory document and mea-</page><page sequence="17">Doing Death Over 333 sure a series of staged propulsions of the living but passive body by using a variety of "actors" in an effort to render select bodies not actively but "passively safe" under ever more disastrous conditions. Whereas Marey and Muybridge measured, recorded, and rep- resented active, animate bodies - the walking, running, and jump- ing bodies of animals and humans - De Haven and Dye were interested in measuring the inert body as it was involuntarily moved or thrown by technology; but, as with Muybridge and Marey, the drive to measure the body's involuntary motion led to technological innovation.47 Researchers in De Haven's lab developed high-speed film (of up to 1,500 frames per second48), as well as increasingly sophisticated and automatic high-speed film analysis technology, to measure the displacement-versus-time relationship of thrown bod- ies in technological collisions. In addition, crash test researchers called on cinematic Stuntmen to learn from them how best to film high-speed collisions and how to help the body withstand the colli- sion's force, creating the impression that real disasters were being rehearsed, choreographed, and filmed by the anonymous showmen of Hollywood.49 These filmic traces found in the Weill Cornell Med- ical Center Archives in various states - mostly film stills in scientific reports and some fragments of reels - constitute an important and relatively unexplored component of film's involvement not just in representing, but also in imagining and enabling, the acceleration of the human body and the construction of a newly expanded frame of safety for American citizens on the move, an acceleration that was exacerbated by the military needs of both the Korean War and the Vietnam War. As they trace the development of a visual and linguistic rhetoric of what came to be called passive safety , the apparently benevolent safety studies, films, and press releases relating to Dye's and De Haven's investigations project into the future an image of U.S. citi- zens as high-speed projectiles that, rather than being slowed down, have the right to be carefully packaged so that they can move unin- hibited throughout the world at their desired velocity without sus- taining any personal injury. Although this vision of physical invulnerability resonates with the individual automobile consumer's fantasies of unlimited personal freedom, it is important to remem- ber that Cornell's CIR project was funded primarily by the military interested in preventing its soldiers' peacetime death by automobile so that they would be available to fight.50 The images that measure the thrown body, therefore, bear witness to the rise of a society in which power would increasingly be determined by the uneven dis- tribution of access to technologies of invulnerability.</page><page sequence="18">334 Karen Beckman Figure 6. "The Thin Man," Cornell Crash Injury Research Project. From the Hugh De Haven (1895-1980) papers. Courtesy of the Medical Center Archives of New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell. Though these scientific tests or preenactments of disaster to come seem inextricably bound to a temporality of futurity, the crash test films and stills that document and measure the movement of the technologically thrown body bring the insistently deferred tempo- rality of the test into contact with the complex qualities of past and presentness that we associate with photographically based media. As if these contradictions are not already complex enough in the way they document "past performances" of accidents yet to come, our temporal sense of these strange technical films is thrown into fur- ther crisis by some of the actors who are cast in the role of driver. Though variations on the inorganic crash test dummy we know today were developed at least as early as the 1920s, including sand- bag dummies, the two-dimensional Thin Man (from the 1940s, whose name references the eponymous 1934 film) (figure 6), and early humanoid models (figures 7 and 8), these dummy actors ulti- mately failed to satisfy the needs of the crash test directors because of their inability to register the subjective experience of pain. While some of the crash test researchers who followed in De Haven's wake, such as Colonel J. P. Stapp, chief medical officer of the National Highway Safety Bureau, and Lawrence Patrick of Wayne State Uni-</page><page sequence="19">Doing Death Over 335 Figure 7.

Surprisingly unable to recruit human volunteers, De Haven and Dye went in search of what De Haven called "involuntary vol- unteers,"52 which took four forms: (1) the dead and injured from</page><page sequence="20">336 Karen Beckman Figure 8.

These "involuntary volunteers" would be subject to collisions at up to 50 miles an hour that would be recorded with high-speed film (figure II).55</page><page sequence="21">Doing Death Over 337 Figure 9.

What is the status of the information that is contained within these macabre scientific rehearsals that, like veritable ballets mécaniques, reanimate the dead on film as passively driven drivers, forcing them to undergo a second death, one more traumatic than their first, for the first must have left no mark on the body if the cadavers are to be useful for the purpose of measuring the injury inflicted by the test collision. As these crashes are rehearsed and recorded within the walls of the laboratory on specially constructed rapid deceleration tracks, these preenactments show no trace of the source of the other victims; indeed, these films conjure up a world in which there are no human consequences to the creation of indestructible bodies, as though we crashed only with ourselves. As Avi tal Ronell argues in The Test Drive (2005), in the no-place of the laboratory, outside of legible geo- graphic and political space, the test exceeds the temporal and geo- graphic coordinates we need to be able to register anything like a sense of place or history, and this evasion of our epistemological frame contributes to the crash test's ability to register a kind of moral neutrality. The true experiment is slippery, belonging, as Ronell argues, "to the future of its elaboration and, being wed to novelty, cannot be said to fall on this or that side of a divide deter- mining good or evil."56 In recent years, the safety test has arisen as an increasingly important figure in contemporary art and films that engage the escalating prominence of the discourse of risk, safety, and security. This rise is not simply a response to a specific event, such as the attack on the World Trade Center, but is rather a symptom of broader insecurities that emerge within the context of globaliza- tion, marked by a new awareness of what Ulrich Beck calls the "world risk society."57 Yet, although the perception of world risk has the potential to forge new paradigms of global citizenship that exceed nation-based paradigms and hierarchies, the self-reflexive and future-oriented paradigms of a risk society, as Beck argues, also put pressure on the frame of realism. Beck writes, The definitional power of realism rests upon exclusion of questions that speak more for the interpretive superiority of constructivist approaches. How, for example, is the borrowed "self-evidence" of "realistic" dangers actually produced? Which actors, institutions, strategies and resources are decisive in its fabrication? These questions can be meaningfully asked and understood only within an anti-realist, constructivist perspective.58</page><page sequence="24">340 Karen Beckman What makes risk particularly resistant to ideological critique, and difficult to engage by using the documentary form of filmmaking, is the speculative dimension of the concept. Film scholars have long recognized that the reenactment of an event after the fact may not always appear 21s a diversion from the truth, and that such dramatic instances can play an important and politicized role in documentary practice. But if dramatic reenactment offers documentary filmmakers a means to represent elusive or repressed historical events, how can documentary theory and practice begin to grapple with those catas- trophes imagined by the discourse of risk that, though they have not yet, and may never, come, potently shape the reality of the present? What is the status of (p)reenactments such as those that occur within the context of the crash test not as past but as future-oriented per- formances, repetitions of events in advance of their occurrence; and how might such performances bear on our understanding of docu- mentary film's relation to the concept of truth? Though the speculative performance of imagined catastrophes may seem to belong squarely in the space of science fiction, not doc- umentary, we might begin to read the scientific safety test film as a future-oriented documentary film paradigm that enables us to con- template the political and ideological consequences of the discourse of risk before disaster strikes and therefore as images to which we need to pay greater attention. Whereas television, as Mary Ann Doane argues in "Information, Crisis, Catastrophe," shifts the tem- porality of the catastrophe from the photographic time of "that has been" to the instantaneous time of "this is going on," a time in which it is always too late to intervene, the scientific safety test film consti- tutes a temporally oracular, but still documentary, form, catching on film not the catastrophe itself, but the ideological fictions that, through repeated rehearsal and performance, shape the form of the disasters to come: the technical test film tells us, "This will be."59 Avi tal Ronell reminds us, through her readings of Nietzsche, of the long-standing affinity that exists between testing and torturing. Testing both reveals a desire for total knowledge and prohibits it through the interminability of the possibility of further experi- mentation, and it is this insatiable desire for more knowledge that produces the conditions of torture. Yet, if, for Nietzsche, the exper- iment, with its commitment to the not yet known, liberates us from the constraints of referential truth, how can we begin to articulate the implications of the test for documentary and for indexical media like film and photography more generally, which are so very invested in precisely that which the test leaves behind? For, whereas docu- mentary photography and film rely in part on the witnessing effect</page><page sequence="25">Doing Death Over 341 of the this-has-been, made to work in tandem with other signs of authenticity, the scientific test or experiment is, as Ronell argues, "monopolized by non-presence" and "runs on deferral."60 Conclusion Although the timing of our political attunement to the social and political violence of the test may, perhaps by necessity, always be belated, contemporary video artists and filmmakers are increasingly turning to the figure of the crash test in particular as they explore what it is that has been preenacted for us that has led us into the sit- uation we're now in, as well as what we're currently rehearsing for the future. In 2006, the intricately intertwined ideologies and indus- tries of testing, security, citizenship, and globalization were brought into sharp focus by a series of performances, happenings, film screenings, and video installations that took place in Munich, Budapest, Prague, and Ljubljana between May and July under the title "Crash Test Dummy: The New European 'Self' in a Bio-political Crash Test."61 This "test" featured a wide range of film and video works, including a screening of the Austrian filmmaker Jörg Kalt's Crash Test Dummies (2005), which follows the fate of Eastern Euro- pean migrant workers and socially anonymous bodies in Austria, some of whom make livings as human crash test dummies (figure 12) ; Alexandra Weltz's video installation Munich Express (2006) , fea- turing interviews with asylum seekers cast in the role of "crash test dummies" by the regulations governing their existence in Munich (figure 13); and Du Zhenjun's spectacular public video installation, Crash (China/France, 2006), depicting a car crashing through a Figure 12.

We see the widespread penetration of the article in that when Charles Barton remade Cecil B. DeMille's 1922 film Manslaughter in 1936, he renamed it And Sudden Death and attributed screenplay credits to Furnas. Manslaughter (dir. Cecil B. DeMille, 1922) was adapted by Jeanie Macpherson from Alice Duer Miller's sensational eponymous 1921 novel about Lydia Thorne (Leatrice Joy), a high-society and masochistically inclined speed fiend who accidentally runs over a traffic cop. The film was remade by Paramount on at least four other occasions: Manslaughter (dir. George Abbott, USA, 1930), starring Claudette Colbert and Frederic March; Leichtsinnige Jugend (dir.

Spencer's influential Saturday Evening Post article "How to Avoid Sudden Death" (16 July 1955, 88) ends by describing the prizewinning project of eighth-grader George Sitt s (from Ilion, New York) that consisted of two miniature cars containing eggshells filled with different colored dyes, which would then be propelled into head-on colli- sions with each other. Only half of the egg-passengers would be equipped with belts.
