<plain_text><page sequence="1">Epistemological TV RICHARD LORBER It now seems that this phase in our cultural evolution will be ever more shaped by new communications media. Appropri- ately enough for "antennae of the race," our artists are responding to electronic technologies. Just now, video in particular is orbiting the arts. But only a few visual artists have as yet developed the synergistic resources of the medium in the making of video art. Understandably, it was the visual artist who awakened early to the fructifying possibilities of video as an art medium. It has already been a decade since half-inch portable videotape recorders were first available and immediately purchased by a handful of artists. Considering the aesthetic impass then of Ab- stract Expressionist conventions, it's not surprising that some of these individuals saw the canvas ultimately replaced by the cathode ray tube; others expected (and still do) that film and the traditional materials of sculpture would be similarly supplanted. And now manv latter-day Pop, Minimal, Environ- mental, and Conceptual artists, most of whom already had done awav with the canvas and other traditional material supports by other means, have also opted to work in video. There were practical and in some cases cynically commercial reasons for this. Nevertheless, as these artists began seeking support structures for their work in systems of ideas outside of formal aesthetics, the instrumentality of video became ever more amenable. The dematerialized immediacy of the video monitor image and the medium's reflexive properties in live feedback systems have tended to make video art something of a "final solution" for handling all the epistemological ironies (harking back to Duchamp) in the art of the last 10 years. In this electronic phase of aesthetic retooling, some artists have concentrated on the technological development of the medium in the interests of expanded sensory effects. Nam June Paik, Woody and Steina Vasulka, Bill and Louise Etra, among others, have built and used synthesizers, colorizers, and other impressively conceived machines to induce new octaves of visual phenomena, heightening the sensuosity of the video image and warming up a decidedly cool medium. Other artists have collaborated with television stations using available technology in experimental broadcasts (usually closed circuit) and in live two-way feedback projects reaching a wider public (Douglas Davis, James Seawright, Jackie Cassen, to mention a few). Their work seems intended to stimulate and rehabilitate the advanced technology that has generally lain dormant in the conventions of commercial TV. Both groupings of artists seem committed to closing the gap between the aesthetic possibil- ities inherent in the hardware of commercial TV and the modes of thinking prevalent in the software of video art. By far the greatest number of video artists are, in a sense, poachers to the medium, though welcome ones. To scratch the surface of a list of diversely prominent artists, one could cite Robert Morris, Bruce Nauman, Les Levine, Lynda Benglis, Keith Sonnier, Richard Serra, Joan Jonas, Dennis Oppenheim, Vito Acconci, John Baldessari, as artists also working in video, though the mode is becoming all consuming in several cases. As Douglas Davis has noted, these artists tend to use video as "another studio tool to impose upon video ideas generated in other conditions." Camera/monitor systems may serve as responsive feedback components activated by the viewers' perception and presence in an environmental event. Or, camera/monitor relationships may add an unpredictable experiential dimension to a live performance piece. In many ways recent video work has been an integrating catalyst for holistic intermedia art forms. Alternately or additionally, many of the same artists make "closed" videotapes where the processes of the medium are less apparent. Unfortunately, a specific accounting of who in the above group does what, and what that is, is beyond the scope of this article. And this collation intentionally excludes those individuals who have emerged preeminently as video artists- seemingly born to the medium. Here the barest sampling would have to recognize Douglas Davis, John Randolph Carter, William Wegman, and Peter Campus. This last artist-though typical of the group only in terms of his ecumenical originality-is perhaps the most versatile and interesting in all aspects of the medium, and thus bears exemplary scrutiny. Of all the video artists here discussed, Campus is, incidentally or significantly, the only one who abandoned a burgeoning career in commercial television (assistant producer of two TV series) to work as a professional video artist, beginning only in 1970. Nor did Campus come to TV with an art background, but rather as a student of psychology with some work in film. Curiously, Campus is equally at home with the environmental uses of live video as well as the making of very finished videotapes of a high order of technical and aesthetic sophistication. Two of his earliest works point up a consistency of intention within contrasting modalities. In the videotapes collectively labeled Dynamic Field Series (1971) Campus systematically investigates the relativism of perception. For one segment he has attached a portable video camera to a rope hung from a pulley on the ceiling of a gymnasium. By first hoisting, then lowering the camera and keeping himself within the focus, the artist recedes and grows nearer, diminishes and enlarges, in a vertiginouslv vertical space.

Campus' other manipulations of and operations upon the video camera create similarly self-regulating "dynamic fields." These videotapes exteriorize ambiguous visual and kinaesthetic relationships, synthesizing an objective perception of the artist's subjective experience. The viewer's vision of space is transformed relative to the artist's actions in that space. What might be thought of as an environmental incarnation of the same concept, Kiva (also from 1971) consisted of a live video camera mounted atop a connected monitor with rotating mirrors suspended in front of the camera eye. Campus described the piece as "an extension of the room, an object defined in space, acting on the space. It generates a continuously changing perspective, a sum of views from points fixed in space and time." At the Whitney Biennial this work did, indeed, fascinate spectators who saw themselves cubistic- ally knitted into the room. Their intermittent, fragmented screen appearances were determined by the orbit and eclipse of mirrors in relation to the viewers' place in the flux of space and time. Inclusion and exclusion by the camera eye became a dynamic warp and woof on the monitor field. With this simple contrivance Campus transcended video gimmickry: Kiva involved the viewer in a temporal continuity between two-dimensional pictorial perception and the tactile awareness of three-dimensional space. In a more recent color videotape, Campus encapsulates his earlier live and taped perceptual investigations in rather more of a philosophical paradox. Like a trio of visual koans, the Three Transitions (1973) confront the viewer with a svs- tematic inversion of the expectation of video as an objectively realistic, truth-telling medium. In the first and most startling "transition," Campus stands with his back to the viewer, facing close up to a wall. In a sudden constricted action, he jabs a knife through the wall. Tearing into it as though it were cardboard, the knife also miraculously stabs out through his back.

He ducks under the flap, stepping into the opening in the wall while also pushing his way forward toward the viewer through the flap in his own back-literally going inside-out of himself. The illusionistic use of the medium is highly convincing, suggesting a kind of anthropomorphic palindrome. (The illusion is created through the carefully registered superimposition of video images recorded on both sides of the wall.) In his equally magical second "transition," Campus erases his face to reveal the same nose, chin, lips, forehead-the identical image, slightly off-register, under the original. A mask is thus peeled away to expose an ironic "reality" beneath. For the third "transition," Campus totally annihilates his face; we see its living features burn up in a flaming mirror held in his hand at a remove from his actual off-camera face. Three Transitions dramatizes the essential nature and central paradox of the video medium. The viewer's awareness of the process and texture of the medium itself is heightened and concretized the more the verisimilitude of the subject is transformed and dematerialized. Campus uses the "convincing- ness" of the medium against itself to perpetrate a kind of double reverse on the real. Such realistic presentation of a triad of impossibilities aims at an irony that transcends subjective perception. The artist exploits the video technology of unique illusion to generate inescapable contradictions of perception and belief, vision and thought. A final word: while some other video work rivals the inventiveness of the Campus oeuvre, and other artists come to other terms with the meta-aesthetic reflexiveness and immedi- acy of the medium, the majority are locked in the Peter Campus, Three Transitions (Transition #3), Videotape, 1973. "rear-view-mirror thinking" that contents itself with the expediency of video to document projects conceived in other modes. Perhaps for this reason video art as such is still in incubation. Only the video anomaly today will exacerbate the viewer's consciousness to the point of admitting a vision of the future for this very visionary art.
