<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> EPILOGUE A funerary inscription found in Termessos (Pisidia) records that a lady  by the name of Rhodope “has here buried her dog ὡς ἄνθρωπον” (“as a  human being”).1 That means that she made ritually explicit the implicit  anthropomorphism that man cannot avoid even if he wishes to, as we  have discussed in the opening section of Chapter V. Incidentally, we  have quite a few funerary inscriptions and epigrammatic poems for  animals, including pigs. Pigs are men.2 In a famous passage Herodotus 2.44 (cf. Pausanias 2.10.1) praises  those Greeks, especially the inhabitants of Thasos, who maintain a  double cult of Herakles, with two sanctuaries, in one of which they  make sacrifices (θύουσι) to him as Olympian and divine, and in the  other pay him such sacrificial honour (ἐναγίζουσι) as due to a hero.  The two Greek terms, used alternatively, refer to different practices,  one connected with βωμοὶ θεῶν (high, square altars for food sacrifices)  for the Olympian gods, and the other with ἐσχάραι ἡρώων (low, cir- cular altars for holocaustic burnt offerings) to heroes and chthonian  gods. This is stated most explicitly in a note by Porphyry (third cen- tury AD), but already in references long before his time.3 What we see  1 B.

In a funerary epigram  (EG 627,2) the passer-by is asked not to laugh “if he finds this to be the grave of  a dog.” Cf. also SGO, Register s.v. ‘Hund’. As to pigs, the idea that a piglet can be  cherished to the degree that its master has a funerary epigram placed on its grave has  elicited a fierce discussion on an inscription from Edessa (P.M. Petsas, AAA 2 [1969]  189–191; SEG 25.711). A choiros has been killed in a traffic accident with a chariot  and is being mourned over by its owner. Even though a pig is pictured on the stone,  some scholars assume that Choiros is the name of a slave infant. For that matter, pigs  were considered to be intelligent animals, and the Testamentum Porcelli, in its own  satirical manner, testifies to that: E. Champlin, The Testament of the Piglet, Phoenix  41 (1987) 174–183.  3 On this text and some others by Porphyry see recently: S.I.

Pausanias 8.34 tells us that, when Orestes was stricken by a fit of  madness, the Eumenides appeared to him black, whence he offered a  holocaust sacrifice to turn away their wrath. After he had bitten off his  finger, they appeared white, he was cured at the sight, and he brought  normal sacrifices to them. In the now famous Lex Sacra of Selinous4  first a sacrifice to the Tritopatores is prescribed ‘as to the impure’ and  immediately thereafter to the Tritopatores ‘as to the pure’. Purification  before and after: the circumstances have changed, hence the rites, but  also the gods. Man can make a hero into a god by treating him as a  god (and vice versa). The malleability and indeed multiperspectiveness of the question  whether a supernatural being was a god or a hero finds a most salient  illustration in the following example. When the inhabitants of Oro- pos argued that their local hero Amphiaraos was a god, Sulla accepted  their plea and granted them privileges accordingly. But since land of  the gods was exempt from taxation, the Roman tax-farmers contested  this decision, declaring in the manner of the Epicureans that those  who had been men could not be immortal. The consuls of 73 BC, their  advisers and the Senate decided against them and confirmed Sulla’s  verdict. We have the inscription to that effect: Syll.3 747. Cicero ND  3.49, however, who was one of the advisers, later quoted the view of  the tax-farmers with approval.5 Time and again it appears that in mat- ters of religious classification it is man who decides. Just as it is the  Pope who, instructed by his ‘senate’ and advisers, determines whether  a dead person is just a dead person or a saint. Gods and heroes have  small say in these matters. A fable of Babrios (no. 30, above p. 330) tells us that a sculptor was  trying to sell a marble statue of Hermes. One man wanted it for a  gravestone, another wanted to set it up as an image of the god himself  (ȯς μὲν εἰς στήλην, ὁ δὲ ὡς θεὸν καθιδρύσων). In his sleep the sculp- 4 See above Ch.

III, also on the territory of the Amphiaraos sanctuary at Oropos. This was not  the first controversy with relation to Amphiaraos. See: Hyp.

One of the  functions of satirical genres such as comedy and fable is to reveal and  problematize tensions, contradictions and inconsistencies in a culture  through a process of literary alienation. The present fable shows, two  millennia before Jonathan Z. Smith, the truth of his statement that:  There is nothing that is inherently sacred or profane. These are not sub- stantive categories, but rather situational or relational categories, mobile  boundaries which shift according to the map being employed. (. . . . . . . . . .)  The sacra are sacred solely because they are used in a sacred place; there  is no inherent difference between a sacred vessel and an ordinary one.6 So it appears that in Greek culture it is up to man’s decision what to  make of an animal, a human, a hero, a god. Within the boundaries  drawn by their culture Greeks could play, define, classify, in short cre- ate according to their will. They can make a dog into a human being, a  mortal into a god, a hero into a god, and a god into a corpse. Greeks,  as we have seen throughout this book, were practically omnipotent in  playing with the divine. Divinity and the forms in which it manifests  itself are exclusively and totally dependent on human cultural readi- ness to join the play, that is, to its cultural acceptability. Pericles (Plut.  Per. 8.9) says about the gods:  We don’t see them but on account of the honours which they receive  and the good things they bestow on us we judge them to be immortal  (οὐ γὰρ ἐκείνους αὐτοɞς ὁρῶμεν, ἀλλὰ ταῖς τιμαῖς dzς ἔχουσι, καὶ τοῖς  ἀγαθοῖς dz παρέχουσιν, ἀθανάτους εȢναι τεκμαιρόμεθα).  His context requires emphasis on ‘immortality’, but with just a lit- tle variation pretty much the same could be—and as we have seen  often was—said about the divinity of human rulers: “they are gods on  account of the honours they receive and the good things they bestow  on us.”7 All this is equally valid as an illustration of the precarious  6 Smith 1982, 55. 7 In Xen. Mem. 4.3.13 Socrates tells Euthydemus not to hang around ‘waiting for  the gods to appear to you in bodily presence’ but rather to infer their presence and  active intervention in human affairs from their works (μὴ ἀναμένʤς ἕως Dzν τὰς μορφὰς  τῶν θεῶν ἴδʤς, ἀλλ’ ἐξαρκʧ σοι τὰ ἔργα αὐτῶν ὁρῶντι σέβεσθαι καὶ τιμᾶν τοɞς θεούς).  He concludes (4.3.14): “For these reasons it behooves us not to despise the things that  are unseen, but, realising their power in their manifestations, to honour the godhead”  (χρὴ . . . . μὴ καταφρονεῖν τῶν ἀοράτων, ἀλλ’ ἐκ τῶν γιγνομένων τὴν δύναμιν αὐτῶν  </page> <page sequence="4"> 496 epilogue reciprocal relationship of gods and men. Each of the two parties is, for  his existence, dependent on the other.  Extraordinary mortals are not alone in playing a god or the god.  Gods do the same, they ‘play god’ on the religious stage. And in both  plays man—in his cultural setting—is the stage manager and director.  Each chapter of this book offered a new and often baffling illustration  of Greeks’ ingenious and creative versatility in this field of religious  play. It is man who decides that ‘our mother of the gods’ is from right  here, not the one from Asia Minor and that ‘our Demeter’ is black and  married to Poseidon. Man, too, decides at which moment Herakles or  Amphiaraos is a god and at which a hero, when Zeus is Olympian and  when Chthonian, and whether the one Zeus is identical with or differ- ent from the other. Man determines that ‘the gods’ may be arbitrary  and whimsical in their interferences in human life and that they may  represent the principle of justice. He may proclaim that “this god is  one” while at the same time acknowledging the many. He may claim  Hermes, albeit a god, as a near-human comrade, inter alia by admin- istering the appropriate diets. He may assert that Asklepios can do  whatever he wants and yet may fail in immediate professional assis- tance, that gods are omnipotent and that their power is restricted. And  he may define a mortal as a god and play the sincere hypocritical play  that goes with it. Playing the god—playing with gods: the two appear  to have more in common than we might have imagined, and to both  of them the selfsame iron law applies: that is not to mix up the differ- ent registers of this divina commedia. Culinary notions played a revealing role in various chapters. “Are  you a goddess or a mortal woman?” asked hungry Odysseus. The inhab- itants of Lystra did not ask whether Paul and Barnabas were gods, but  defined them as such and brought oxen to make a sacrifice. Greeks  made Hermes play the human by making him share their own mortal  dinner. The Athenians made Demetrios play the god by providing him  καταμανθάνοντα τιμᾶν τὸ δαιμόνιον). Cf. Galenus in the recently found Greek version  of De propriis placitis, 2 (V. Boudon-Millot &amp; A. Pietrobelli, Édition princeps du de  propriis placitis, REG 118 [2005] 168–213): After having confessed that like Protago- ras he was ignorant of the substance/essence (οὐσία) of the gods, Galenus continues:  “but that they exist I know from their works” (ὅτι δ’εἰσὶν ἐκ τῶν ἔργων γιγνώσκειν).  After mentioning the miracles of Asklepios of Pergamon and the Dioskouroi at sea  he concludes: “So I believe it does no harm that people do not know the ousia of the  gods, but I have decided to honour them according to ancient custom.” Which comes  very close to the little poem by Philemon, quoted above. p. 473. </page> <page sequence="5">  epilogue 497 with a theoxenion à la Dionysos, and with, inter alia, thumiamata in  291 BC (Demochares 75 F.2). Philippos made Menekrates lose his  divinity by forcing him to share such divine foodstuffs. Strange bits and  pieces which only reveal their relevance by first deconstructing and next  reconstructing—always by means of contextualizing—the picture in  which they belong. It is in my view the only way to protect our Greeks  against those late modern monolithical and  mono-paradigmatic dog- mas which I realize cannot always be avoided but which—as I hope to  have shown—too often impose on the gods and their world a lapidar- ity of such an unbearable heaviness that even (Greek) gods could not  lift it up. It was about time, so I thought, to give the gods of the Greeks  the theological treatment which I saw announced as a psychotherapy  in the book of the New York psychotherapist Mark Epstein: “Going to  pieces without falling apart.” </page> </plain_text>
