<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Note on Two Ganesa Statues from Afghanistan by M. K. Dhavalikar Sometime ago Prof. Tucci published in an early issue of this journal a small note on a statue of Ganesa found at Gardez some years ago {*). It was subsequently removed to Kabul where it is presently worshipped by the Hindu residents of Kabul in Dargah Pir Rattan Nath near the Pamir Cinema. This statue has also been noticed by T. N. Ramachan dran and Y. D. Sharma who led the Indian Archaeological Delegation to Afghanistan in 1956 (2). The statue bears an inscription in two lines in Sanskrit on its pedestal. This epigraph was again edited by D. C. Sircar who, on the basis of palaeography, assigned the statue to 6th-7th cent. A.D. (3). Very recently R. C. Agrawala has brought to light the ?rdhvamedhra aspect of this image (4). The Indian Archaeological Mission has also referred to yet another statue of Ganesa (5). It was found at Sakar Dhar (Shankar Dhar), ten miles north of Kabul, from where are reported very interesting images of S?rya and Siva. Even though T. N. Ramachandran and Y. D. Sharma have referred to this statue, it appears that it has as yet remained un? published. R. C. Agrawala has referred only to the ?rdhvamedhra aspect of this statue (6). It will thus be seen that both the statues of Ganesa are now noticed even though the latter from Sakar Dhar has not received the attention it merits. Both the statues are of great importance not only on account of their artistic merits but also because of their iconogra phical peculiarities. It should also be specially emphasized that they are among the early representations of the elephant-headed god. It is therefore proposed to discuss in the fol? lowing pages the significance of the statues which has not so far been appreciated by scholars. It is necessary at the outset to describe the statues in brief so as to emphasize their uniqueness. The statue, which is now in the Dargah Pir Rattan Nath locality of Kabul, is a typical product of the Indo-Afghan school (fig. 1). It is made of inferior quality of marble and represents the elephant-headed Ganesa. It is about 24 inches high and 14 inches wide, and on its pedestal is carved an inscription in two lines which records that ? This great and beautiful Mah?-Vin?yaka was consecrated by the renowned S?ht king, the illus? trious S?hl Khingala, who was Parama-bhatt?raka-mah?r?j?dhir?ja, in the eighth year (of i1) G.

On the basis of the palaeography of the record, it can be assigned to early 6th cent. Sircar, however, is of the opinion that the record should be dated to the 7th cent, for the reason that the letter ya has been shown in the tripartite form (7). The more complicated issue is of the identification of the king Khingala. It is interest? ing to note in this connexion that a very ancient king named Narendr?ditya of Kashmir also bore the name of Khinkhila (8). He was a successor of Mihirakula, apparently the Huna king of that name, who ruled from 510-535 A.D. But Narendr?ditya who bore this title was a late king and as such cannot be identified with Khingala of the inscription who, as the record explicitely states, was a S?hi king. He was probably an early king and in that case may be identified as the issuer of those coins bearing the legend Khinga or Khingi on them. One such coin is in the Indian Museum, Calcutta and nine other similar coins are said to have been in the possession of Mrs J.P.T. Rawlins who is reported to have found them in Punjab. According to Vincent Smith, the Indian Museum specimen is ascribable to the end of the 5th cent. (9). Another coin is also known to bear the legend Devas?hi Khin gila (10). However, we must agree with Prof. Tucci who rightly observes that the date of this king is still subject to doubt ("). The numismatic evidence cited above tends to show that the statue of Ganesa in question can, with reasonable amount of certitude, be assigned to the latter half of 5th cent, or at best to the early 6th cent. This is also supported by the stylistic peculiarities of the image. The elephant-headed god is shown standing in the ?lidha posture; his hands, legs and chest are muscular, suggesting a strong Hellenistic influence. The trunk which is broken, was turned to the left while the broken tusk is clearly seen on the left. The god is shown wearing a bejewelled tiara {ardha-mukuta) and a necklet (kanthi) composed of what look like collared beads. The ornaments are noteworthy and are reminiscent of those met with in Gupta sculptures. The ears, carved at the back, are more or less stylized and look more like wings than ears. The god originally had four hands, all of which are now broken. He wears a snake as his sacred thread (n?ga-yajnopavlta) and another band (udara bandha) is tied to the belly. The ?rdhvamedhra aspect of the statue was already noted by Agrawala (12). His lower garment (antariya) is a short dhoti (ardhoruka) on which are seen motifs like lion's head (kirtimukha) and claws. Thus the costume and the jewellery show that the inspiration is from Magadha whereas the physical features are clearly betoken of a strong Hellenistic influence. The statue therefore can be dated, on stylistic grounds, to the latter half of 5th cent, or early 6th cent.

The elephant-headed god is shown standing with two of his four hands resting over the heads of two dwarf atten? dants (ganas), one each on either side. His lower garment (antariya) is a short dhoti (ardho rukd) with tassel-like drapery in front arranged in such a manner as to show the god as ?rdhvamedhra. The bulging belly is not, however, of huge proportions. He wears a naga yajnopavita. The muscular chest at once reminds us of the Gandharan statuary. The trunk rests sufficiently high above the left shoulder. The right tusk is intact but the left is broken. The ears are stylized and give the impression of wings. The god has four arms of which the upper left is broken. The two lower arms are spread down in a highly symmetrical pose and are seen resting over the heads of two ganas who are looking up at Ganesa with devotion. The ganas have curly hair and wear sparse jewellery. Stylistically, the statue resembles the early Gupta sculptures, and can be dated to the 4th cent, when the Gupta influence had begun to appear and the Hellenistic was lingering. It may therefore be as? signed to the transitional period between the Kushan and Gupta. It is interesting indeed that the Hindus of Kabul are now worshipping this image in the Shore Bazaar locality (Nar singhdwara). This Ganesa statue from Sakar Dhar is important in many respects. First and fore? most, it is evident from the attributes in his hands and also the absence of the v?hana that the iconography of the elephant-headed deity is not yet standardized, but on the other hand, is in the process of formation. This would only show that the statue was fashioned long before Var?hamihira prescribed the iconography in his Brhat-samhit?. The dwarf attendants [ganas) are not usually to be met with in the icons of Ganesa; in the present specimen they are shown only to emphasize the status of the god who was the leader of the ganas, which function justifies his appellation Ganesa on Ganapati, that is, the Lord of the ganas. It should be specifically noted that the physical features of the deity are not of ponderous proportions as they usually are shown in later examples. This is undoubtedly due to the lingering Hel? lenistic influence. He does not wear any jewellery worth the name; only the bangles and the arm-bands are to be seen. The crown also is not the elaborate kirita-mukuta which is to be seen in the later images of the god but a modest tiara (ardha-mukuta) (13) which is reminiscent of the headgear of the Sassanian kings of Iran. As already noted, the belly is not protruding and therefore no band for belly (udarabandha) is necessary. The ?rdhva? medhra aspect of the statue has already been noticed by other scholars, and nothing can be said about its significance in the present state of our knowledge. The foregoing analysis of the stylistic and iconographical peculiarities of the statue amply show that it can be assigned to the transitional period between the Kushan and the Gupta, that is, sometime about the middle of the 4th cent. If we are not off the mark so (13) Bharata in his N?tya-s?stra prescribes that sen?patis and army leaders and lesser chiefs should wear an ardha-mukuta. This may then show that Ganesa has not yet reached the exalted position in the hierarchy of Brahmanical deities. See N?tya s?stra (ed. M.M. Ghosh), Calcutta, 1950, XXX 134-35, p. 430. 333</page><page sequence="4">far as the age of the statue is concerned, then we can easily take it to be one of the very early representations, nay even the earliest of all the images of the god so far known (14). It is indeed curious and interesting, but equally significant, that the images of the elephant headed god of such an early date should be found not in the country where the Brahma nical religion flourished and still does but in a region where it did not survive. But it should be noted in this connexion that Afghanistan was at least culturally a part of the Indian sub-continent. As a matter of fact parts of eastern Afghanistan formed a part of the Kushan empire. The images of a number of Brahmanical gods and goddesses found in Afghanistan also amply testify to the patronage of the Hindu kings of Afghanistan. It is not therefore at all surprising that some of the early representations of Ganesa should have been found in Afghanistan. In India, although a number of images of Ganesa have been found, most of them are datable to the post-Gupta period while those belonging to the Gupta period are only a few. This has led some scholars to infer that in point of time the god is a late addition to the Brahmanical pantheon (15). But it is nevertheless noteworthy that he achieves a very ex halted position in the hierarchy of gods and goddesses within a very short space of time. The general opinion seems to favour the view that his worship began sometime in the 6th cent, and during the following two or three centuries we witness his rapid rise to promi? nence, so much so, that by the 10th cent, an independent sect ? albeit within the fold of Hinduism ? commonly known as the G?napatya, comes into being. Ganesa was also borrowed by other religious systems such as Buddhism and Jainism and his worship spread almost all over Asia where Hinduism and Buddhism flourished. Even today Ganesa is ac? corded a very high position by Hindus and it is one of the most important deities wor? shipped in India. The discovery of a statue of Ganesa belonging to the 4th cent. A.D. throws important light on the antiquity of the elephant-headed god. First and foremost, it shows that the general view that his worship began sometime in the 6th cent, is no longer tenable. It also demonstrates that the deity was worshipped in Afghanistan as early as the 4th cent. The worship of the elephant-headed god in Afghanistan in ancient times is also attested by the testimony of that most celebrated Chinese traveller, Hsiian-tsang, who visited India during 629-645 A.D. He travelled through Central Asia and Afghanistan on his way to India in 630. During his prolonged journey he spent considerable time in visiting the Buddhistic monastic establishments in Afghanistan where he spent a whole summer in the ancient city of Kapisl. We can do no better than quote the words of the pilgrim: ? To the south-west of the capital [Kapisl] was the Pi-lo-sho-lo Mountain. This name was given to the moun (14) The Mathura Museum Ganesa image from Salempur (No. 758) which is dated to the Kushan period is actually a late specimen of the Gupta period and has to be assigned to ca. 5th-6th cent.

(16). The pilgrim's testimony amply demonstrates that during the 6th-7th centuries the peoples of Kapisa were worshipping their tutelary god who had the form of an elephant. It is necessary to emphasize that Hsiian-tsang merely records a tradition which was in vogue long before he visited Kapisa. This tradition is confirmed by the evidence furnished by an important coin type of Eukratides, an Indo-Greek king, who ruled over a part of the Asiatic possessions of Alexander the Great. This type has been described thus: ? Zeus sitting on throne to front, holds wreath and palm to the right of throne; forepart of ele? phant and to left a pilos (mountain); above his indistinct monogram; the Kharoshti legend ? ~Kavi(pi)shiye nagara devata* ? (17). Of these, the symbols, viz. the head of the elephant and the mountain accompanying the central device as well as the Kharosthi legend are of especial interest inasmuch as they can be explained with the help of the account of Hsiian-tsang. Rapson was the first to connect the two symbols and the legend recorded by the pilgrim and explain these two symbols, one as the mountain Pilus?ra ? ? Pi-lo-sho-lo ? of Hsiian-tsang ? and the other as the elephant god of the mountain as also of Kapisi (18). Eukratides ruled from about 171-150 B.C. and his respect for the god of his subjects is evident from his portrayal on the coin type issued by him. In fact, the coin is taken to be a proof of the conquest of the Kabul valley by Eukratides. It is again interesting to find the peculiar elephant head on some of the copper coins of Demetrius and other Indo-Greek and Saka rulers like Maues and it can also be associated with this deity peculiar to Kapisi and its environs. This points to the existence of the elephant god of Kapisi well before the 2nd cent. B.C. The repre? sentations of elephants are quite common in the early series of Indian coinage; it even occurs on the earliest punch-marked coins. It is realistically represented as full-bodied animal and not by its head only. As against this persistent tradition, only the head of the elephant is represented on the early coin devices of foreign rulers in India. This can be taken to represent a stage between the theriomorphic and the anthropomorphic form of the ele? phant god. It may incidentally be noted that this association of Ganesa with mountains continued in South-east Asia where he was worshipped in the later period. In the region of Kom pong Thorn in Indo-China an inscription of the 9th cent, was discovered. It contains a refer? ence to a donation given to Ganes'a of Chandanagiri, that is, Ganesa of the ? Sandal moun? tain ?. Barth identifies this mountain as the Chocung Prey near which on a hill in the vicinity of Prah Pada are the ruins of a temple that is believed to have been dedicated to Ganesa (19). This inscription is important because it refers to Ganesa as an independent (16) T. Watters, On Yuan Chwang's Travels in India, 1st Indian ed., Delhi, 1961, I, p. 129. (17) R.B. Whitehead, Catalogue of the Coins in the Punjab Museum, Lahore, I, Oxford, 1914, p. 26. (18) CHI, I, p. 556. (19) L. Palmer Briggs, The Ancient Khmer Empire, Philadelphia, 1951, p. 193. 335</page><page sequence="8">and locally important deity and emphasizes the tradition which followed him from India to Japan of being worshipped in connexion with mountains. In Japan, he was supposed to be seated on a mountain and was referred to as the ? King of Elephants ? (20). Another factor that merits a very careful attention is the name of the deity as given by Hsiian-tsang which is ? Pilus?ra ?. Literally it can be taken to mean ? elephant essence ?. It is remarkable that Ganesa has been referred to in the Kung-hsien statue inscription as ? the Spirit King of Elephants ? (21). It is highly probable that the name ? Pilus?ra ? was connected with that of the city of Kapisl. Kapisl can be explained as ? a city endowed with elephants ?; for kapi also means celephant5 in Sanskrit. However, the name ? Pilus?ra ? can also be compared with ? Pillaiy?r ? which is the Dravidian name for Ganesa and is current in South India even today. The latter is supposed to be a corrupt form of his ancient Dravidian title and is obviously derived from the Dravidian words pallu or pella, both signifying ? tooth ?, that is, ? the tusk of the elephant ?, although in the present form there is no meaning of tusk. Villa is a Tamil word for ? child ? and pillaiy?r means ? noble child ?. But according to V?i-sadda-mah?nnava, pille meant ? the young of an elephant ? and the Pali word pillaka has the significance of ? young elephant ? (22). Even in Sanskrit the word pila or pilu means ? elephant ?. The Dravidian name ? Pillaiy?r ? therefore, in all probability, might have derived from the ancient Sanskrit ? Pilus?ra ?, for linguistically also the derivation is feasible. There are a number of examples in which we find that when a word was borrowed from Sanskrit into Tamil, Sanskrit sa or sa was changed into ya in Tamil (23). It should therefore be amply clear that the concept of the elephant headed god originated in Afghanistan and that his ancient name ? Pilus?ra ? still survives in ? Pillaiy?r ? in South India where incidentally several Hindu traditions still persist in their purest form. (20) A. Getty, Ganesa, Oxford, 1936, p. 80. (21) Ibid., p. 68. (22) According to R. Caldwell, Comparative Grammar of Dravidian Languages, 3rd ed., Madras, 1961, p. 599, it is a word of Scythian origin to be compared with Latin pullus, ? young of an animal ?. (23) M.R.
