GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS BIBLIOGRAPHY.--The magnificent project of the International Association for Classical Archae- ology in Florence for annual Fasti archaeologici is one which will be invaluable to all workers in the field. The first volume is announced for 1948. The handsome and extensive Bulletin analy- tique de bibliographie hellinique of the Institut Frangais d'Athenes, Fascicules I and II/III of 1946, published in Athens under the date of 1947, con- tains among other things many archaeological titles. The Bolletino delle pubblicazioni italiane of the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Firenze, no. 558 (1947), contains twenty-eight titles under the heading "Archaeologia -Belle Arti" (nos. 4186- 4213), but only one, Carlo Anti's volume on the Teatri greci arcaici da Minosse a Pericle, with five reconstructions by Italo Gismondi, falls within the range of this Digest. YALE PUBLICATIONS IN THE MIDDLE-EAST FIELD.--Readers of the Journal may be interested in the inauguration of the Yale Judaica Series, of which the first volume, Samuel Rosenblatt's transla- tion of Saadia Gaon's The Book of Beliefs and Opin- ions, is announced for May 1948. Of more imme- diate archaeological interest is Julian Obermann's Ugaritic Mythology, of the same publication date. HELLENISTIC MOSAICS.--In the REA, xlii (1940), pp. 508-514, M. Rostovtzeff discusses two large mosaics, one from Antioch and one from Lep- tis Magna. The latter shows a variant on the com- mon fertility theme of Egypt, a river god, women representing the land, and putti engaged in various pursuits but representing the cubits of the river's flood; in this instance they are leading by a garland a crocodile upon which the god sits. Similar in gen- eral style, but differing in conception, the Antioch mosaic calls the putti karpoi, and represents them as busy with making an enormous harvest wreath. The same conception, apparently, occurs in the hymns of Isidorus, from Medinet Madi in the Fayum. GREECE General SMALL OBJECTS FROM DELPHI.--P. Amandry publishes in BCH, lxviii-lxix (1944-5), pp. 36-74, a group of miscellaneous bronze, terracotta and stone objects. I. Deposit of the Geometric period, found under the Sacred Way between the base of the Boeotians and the exedra opposite. Ceramic finds, all of Geometric style, include fragments of a crater and a pyxis. Bronzes, mostly of the late eighth cen- tury B.C., include a statuette of a warrior, possibly Ares or Zeus, the triangular head recalling Syrian and Mycenaean art; statuette of a bull with a tri- angle hollowed out in the forehead for incrustation; two fibulae with engraved plaques, belonging to the continental Greek type found over a wide area. Par- ticularly interesting are the fragments of a shield, decorated with a central rosette and with two zones of sphinxes and deer, important because it is the first of its series found outside Crete and shows the close relation between Crete and Delphi in the ripe archaic period. The sphinx here appears for the first time in a walking file, and shows a modifica- tion of the Oriental type. Stone finds include a plaque engraved with compass-drawn circles and a crude outline drawing of a warrior; and a scarab engraved with a bull and wild goat walking through a papyrus grove; a Cyprian provenance is suggested by the style and by the combination of a plant mo- 382</page><page sequence="2">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIGEST 383 tif from Egypt or the Aegean with Geometric ani- mal style. II. Vases from the eastern necropolis, from two different tombs include a Mycenaean ala- bastron, the first Mycenaean vase found in this ne- cropolis, probably Late Helladic III; five aryballoi, Protocorinthian in type, midway between the globular and ovoid shapes; Protocorinthian kala- thos with two rows of pierced "windows." III. Bronzes of diverse provenance. Openwork bronze plaque, consisting of rectangular compartments each enframing an animal, probably in antithetical pairs at each side of a sacred tree; this formed part of a square support, dated in the late eighth or possibly early seventh century; possibly of Cyprian, Syrian or Cretan provenance. Male statuette of Ge- ometric style; a headless figure wearing a large fibula; four helmets, three of which are Corinthian of the seventh century. IV. Bronzes from an old excavation. Among pieces already published and re- cently cleaned, the author cites a helmet, part of an appliqu6, and a fragment of a tripod foot.-In an addendum is noted the forepart (protome) of a grif- fin, one of a class made of a thin layer of bronze hammered over a wooden core and then filled with a blackish substance. The date is in the Geometric period. Of eastern (Assyrian) origin, the type may have been introduced by the Cretans into Greece where it then underwent an independent develop- ment. (W. K. P.) Excavations CORINTH.--In Hesperia, xvi, 4 (Oct.-Dec., 1947) Oscar Broneer publishes the results of "Inves- tigations at Corinth, 1946-1947" (pp. 233-247). Six small temples on the west end of the Agora are identified provisionally as those of Tyche-Aphro- dite, a Pantheon, Heracles, Poseidon, Apollo, and Hermes. An apsidal building in the middle of the Agora is perhaps a cult-house of Dionysus. A build- ing to the southeast may be the tabularium. Archi- tectural members have been replaced on the exist- ing foundations in the South Stoa, adding much to the interest and intelligibility of the site. Most of the shops in the South Stoa have been identified as taverns, equipped with an elaborate system of wells for the refrigeration of wine, and containing stamped jars from Rhodes and Knidos, lamps, gam- ing-boards, knuckle-bones (including some loaded ones), and some pieces of flutes. A number of terra- cotta tubes have been tentatively conjectured to be containers for colors, from an artist's studio or a beauty-shop. From the same area come a silver- plated bronze plaque of Hermes, a number of ante- fixes, and several lion's head spouts, the lions realis- tically painted. A trial trench in the church lot 75 meters southeast of the Agora yielded pottery of the fifth and fourth centuries B.c., two types of Aphrodite statuettes, possibly reflecting two succes- sive cult statues from Acrocorinthus, and a couple of crude Egyptian terracottas. A plan of the Corin- thian Agora in the second century after Christ, by John Travlos, accompanies the report (p. 234). (P. L. MacK.) THASos.-E. Will reviews in BCH, lxviii-lxix, (1944-5), pp. 129-154, the results of the 1939 cam- paign (for the second part of the article, pp. 154- 162, by R. Martin, see below). A. The Prytaneion. A square building of the archaic period, rebuilt and enlarged in the fourth century. It was impossible to establish the entire ground-plan. The monumental entrance was the most prominent feature. Finds in- cluded fragments of black-figured lekythoi and the head of a Roman emperor. B. The new sanctuary. A square terrace; the central part could not be exca- vated because of the presence of a modem house; the monument may have been important. Pieces of a terracotta gutter with a row of riding figures in relief were found, as well as a fragment of a painted terracotta metope. The wall resembles that of the Poseideion and more especially the small al- tar of Hera. This building had no connection with the Prytaneion. C. Edifice consecrated to the So- teira. Square plan; poros foundation, marble su- perstructure. Good workmanship; the date cannot be much later than mid fifth century. An inscrip- tion bearing a dedication by the polemarchs, in which the word Soteira is here restored, might in- dicate that this is a monument dedicated to the divinity who freed the island from Persian domina- tion. D. Sanctuary of foreign gods. Remains of two small sanctuaries, of different periods, only par- tially excavated. (W. K. P.) Architecture THEATER OF DIONYSUS AT ATHENS.--In a de- tailed study of the blocks of the proscenium and of the parascenia of the Period X of the Theater, R. Vallois comes to the conclusion that this period is not that of Lycurgus, but rather of a reconstruction in the second century B.c. (REA, xlii [1940], pp. 365-376). DELPHI.--J. Jannoray in BCH, Ixviii-lxix (1944-5), pp. 75-93, discusses a group of six in- scribed marble blocks found under the house of the French School at Delphi, to which a seventh, pre- viously discovered, may be added. They join to form a cornice of two elements, with a moulded band at the top, immediately beneath which is an inscription of unusual length, running the whole</page><page sequence="3">384 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY width of the cornice. The inscription, of secondary importance in the present study, is a decree passed by the Delphians at the instigation of the Roman consul Aemilius lunius, concerning the division of land. This cornice is closely paralleled by other simi- larly inscribed and moulded fragments from Delphi, which the author reconstructs to form four more cornices. The inscriptions of the entire group con- cern the intervention of Rome in Delphian affairs in the time of Domitian and Hadrian. The question of the original location arises. Bourguet has proposed that all came from a single ensemble inserted in the long south wall of the Temple of Apollo, above the orthostates, at the time of its remodelling by Do- mitian. Such an hypothesis is supported by the similar nature of the inscriptions on the orthostates, which are of bluish limestone. A group of in- scribed limestone blocks was in fact found at the same place as the marble cornice under discussion. But the Bourguet theory is demolished by the fact that our original cornice is found to join with a group of limestone pieces in the Epigraphical Mu- seum, to form a real "stele," the upper part of marble, the lower limestone, of dimensions impos- sible for an orthostate of the Apollo temple, or, in fact, for any orthostate. The author concludes that all these cornice fragments formed a sort of facing to some wall, and were set up at some prominent place in the sanctuary, probably the terrace; he sug- gests the retaining wall on the north side. (W. K. P.) EAST PEDIMENT OF THE TEMPLE OF APOLLO AT DELPHI.-Referring to the prologue of the Eu- menides and the Mediceus scholiast, A. Plassart ex- plains the scene of Apollo in a chariot flanked by three korai and three kouroi as that of the god es- corted from Athens by the sons and daughters of Erechtheus, the former being armed with axes for the purpose of clearing the land (REA, xlii [1940], pp. 293-299). TIRYNS.--R. Demangel offers in BCH, lxviii- lxix (1944-5), pp. 404-410, a new reconstruction of the alabaster frieze which decorated the vestibule of the great megaron at Tiryns. An important docu- ment for the origin of the future Doric order, the frieze must also be considered in the light of the long Creto-Oriental tradition from which it stems. The unit of the frieze as here restored consists of two half-ellipses filled with floral palmettes (half- rosettes), separated by a "triglyph" decorated with a central vertical band of five connected spirals with a row of four rosettes on either side and framed by square insets of blue glass paste. The Tiryns frieze is the most elaborate in a series of some twenty known Creto-Mycenaean examples. (W. K. P.) IONIC CAPITALS FROM THE ASKLEPIEION AT ATHENS.--R. Martin in BCH, lxviii-lxix (1944-5), pp. 340-374, divides the capitals into four groups: I, a rare type in Attica, has convex canal and vol- utes; II, characterized by sobriety of decoration and harmony of lines; notable is the structure of the spirals, wider toward the outside giving greater volume and solidity; all details are executed with great care, and the best period of Athenian archi- tecture is indicated; III, more careless work of a later period; the volutes are irregular, the echinus has three ova; straight lines tend to replace curves; IV, the decoration is in a dry style; the center of the volutes is marked; in the baluster, the astragal mouldings are developed at the expense of the sco- tia. While the destination of three of the capitals can be determined only hypothetically, type II as- suredly belongs to the same edifice as the base that remains in situ at the southwest corner of the west- ern portico. This base cannot be later than the fourth century; its mouldings and general propor- tions come close to those of the Erechtheum. Base and capital belong together, and can be dated in the late fifth or early fourth century. There follows a lengthy analysis of the structure of the volutes fol- lowing the Vitruvian system for determining the centers of the successive quadrants from which they were drawn. These data cannot be expressed mathe- matically, but they can be graphically portrayed for purposes of restoration and comparison. In all analyses, Capital II is found to be closely similar to the Erechtheum capitals. -The article concludes with an examination of the general development of the Ionic capital in Greece, the Asklepieion ex- amples being then located within this framework. It is shown that no. I, with its Ionic convexity, be- longs to a type in which the proportions are squat, the eye of the volute falling inside the point of in- tersection of the lower bed of the echinus and the line of the column shaft. With the help of tables giving the numerical relations of the vertical and horizontal dimensions in some twenty capitals, no. I may be dated early in the second quarter of the fifth century. A second group of capitals shows more elongated and harmonious proportions, with the vo- lute center falling outside the line of the shaft. To this type, which includes the finest Periclean Ionic buildings, belong capital II (second half of the fifth century), III, somewhat later, and IV, a Hellenistic- Roman descendant. Puchstein has argued that this group represents a complete break with the preced- ing one, and was invented by Mnesikles borrowing from Asiatic sources; but the two types have many features in common, and Mnesikles' contribution</page><page sequence="4">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIGEST 385 seems rather to have been the reviving and perfect- ing of ancient native forms. (W. K. P.) Sculpture EARLY WORK IN BRONZE.-In Mnemosyne, Bibliotheca Classica Batava, 3d ser., xii, 4 (1945), pp. 318-320, A. W. Byvanck discusses briefly Rhoe- cus, Telecles, and Theodorus, who imported to Sa- mos Egyptian methods of bronze sculpture, and whose work may be known through the bronze statuette of Cheramyes, from Olympia, and some marble pieces. In a second note, Byvanck finds sup- port for an anecdote of Phidias told by Tzetzes, that he introduced the element of perspective in statuary intended to be seen from below, in the right-hand group on the east pediment of the Par- thenon. SATYRUS SON OF ISOTIMUS.--In the REA, xliv (1942), pp. 5-24, Ch. Picard considers the career of this neglected artist of the fourth century, architect of the Mausoleum, sculptor, didactic poet, a predecessor of the versatile artists of the Renais- sance. THE ALTAR OF DREROS AND THE CULT OF APH- RODITE.-A remarkable discovery at Dreros was that of a hollow altar in the temple of Apollo, Leto, and Artemis, originally fitted with a wooden cover, and containing two iron knives and a large number of left horns of she-goats (W. Deonna in REA, xlii, 1940, pp. 111-126). This suggests the altar at Delos described by Callimachus, built by Apollo out of similar horns supplied by Artemis, and other traditional elements of the cult going back to My- cenaean times. THE MEDICI ATHENA.--Frangois Chamoux publishes in BCH, lxviii-lxix (1944-5), pp. 206-239, a long article on the "Type of the Ingres Minerva" (the Medici Athena). Found in the Medici garden in Rome, sent to Paris and in 1913 installed in the Louvre, this large and impressive marble statue has been the object of numerous studies and conflict- ing opinions. The author begins with a careful analysis of the attitude and drapery; he reconstructs the figure with head turned slightly to the right, right arm lowered holding a lance, and left arm bearing a shield. Certain crudities of treatment lead him to conclude that the statue is not a Greek original, but a Roman copy, probably of the Hadri- anic period. He draws up a list of twelve replicas, in whole or part, in full size, and six reduced copies of the common prototype; these form a coherent group and permit the reconstruction of the head and arms, missing in the Medici figure. All features point to Phidias of the late period, and it is con- cluded that the prototype was a cult statue by him or from his atelier. There is a close stylistic simi- larity to the Athena Parthenos. A study of the coins of the period leads to the negative conclusion that the Medici type cannot be identified with the Athe- na Promachos. Rejecting other identifications with types described in literature, proposed by Thiersch (Athena Areia), Amelung (Lemnia), and others, the author concludes that the Medici Athena does not correspond to any work mentioned in literary tradi- tion. (W. K. P.) A BRONZE STATUETTE FROM EPIDAURUS is published by R. Martin in BCH, lxviii-lxix (1944-5), pp. 375-390. The statuette, representing an ephebe standing in the conventional attitude of the archaic kouros, was found in the sanctuary of Asklepios. Noticeable are the broad shoulders, nar- row waist and flat stomach, and the general im- pression of vitality and suppleness. The anatomy shows consummate skill in modelling. The only gar- ment is a wool shawl or chlamidion thrown over the shoulders, and treated stylistically with folds in- cised. Comparisons with Argive and Athenian works lead to the conclusion that the Epidaurus statuette originated in neither of these schools. Parallels in full-sized sculpture (the Apollo of Agrigentum, two kouroi from Ptoion) and small bronzes (figurine from Abae, one from the Athenian Acropolis, and a num- ber from Olympia), all with similar characteristics, suggest an origin in some center of the northeast Peloponnesus, most likely Corinth or Aegina; the author rather leans toward the latter. The date is around 500-490, when the kouros type was under- going modification from the archaic to the fully de- veloped fifth century type. The nearest parallel in vase painting is Euthymides. The prototype, if any, remains a moot point. (W. K. P.) THE SIPHNIAN FRIEZES.-P. de la Coste-Mes- seliere in BCH, lxviii-lxix (1944-5), pp. 5-35, pre- sents under three headings notes on some problems relating to the friezes of the Treasury of the Siph- nians at Delphi. I. Painted inscriptions (north and east friezes). Some of the painted inscriptions ac- companying the friezes were published in FD, iv, 2, pp. 94 and 109; others are additional notes made from the copies of Fonseca, and unpublished sketches of Homolle, as well as direct observation. Of interest are the following: on the east frieze, in the name Athena, there has been substitution of an A for an E; traces of an inscription ( -OR), part of Hector; the name of the figure next to "Hector" is probably to be read as Menelaos rather than Mem-</page><page sequence="5">386 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY non; Nestor is certain.--II. Interpretation of the eastern frieze: a synthesis of the Iliad. By an ex- amination of the figures in the Gigantomachy of the north frieze, the author establishes that the inscrip- tions were written wherever space allowed, fol- lowing no rigid rule as to their relation to the fig- ures they apply to. The identification of Menelaos is assured. The author maintains 1) that the dying figure in the combat scene is a Trojan, Antilochus, in the traditional position with his feet turned toward his adversaries; 2) the Trojans are shown in "good position," the Achaeans in unfavorable, fol- lowing the law of dexterality according to which a figure or group standing at the left and facing toward the right is inherently superior to one facing toward the left. This negative aspect does not de- note a defeat of the Achaeans, but a trial or proof which they are undergoing. The author notes in this connection that total victories are rare in Greek art, while sharply-disputed combats are the rule. Even archaic art has its "pathetic" aspect. But the Siphnian frieze shows a serene and moderate scene. -III. Discussions and details. The figure accom- panying the chariot of Cybele on the north frieze has been identified by Lippold as Dionysos; the au- thor shows that it might as easily be Herakles; it remains a moot point.-The Master of the Siphnian horses. The interpretation of the west frieze is diffi- cult because of the complete lack of parallels for the scene. Going to mythology one might call it the Judgment of Paris. Neither its artistic antecedents nor posterior iconography show any similarity to the representation. The Master of the Siphnian horses was one of the most original creative artists of the Greco-Oriental world.--The frieze is separated from the architrave by a row of Ionic ova. Certain minor anomalies of workmanship in this molding have led Lippold to believe that the frieze was originally in- tended for another, larger, building, and afterward changed to conform to the Siphnian treasury, sev- eral figures being omitted in the process. The pres- ent author disproves this theory on architectural grounds. In any case, the addition of other figures to the scene of Assembly and Combat would only underline the separateness of the two elements of the scene. (W. K. P.) STATUES AND Ex-VOTOS FROM THE DIONYSIAc "STIBADEION" OF DELOS are dispussed by Ch. Picard in BCH, lxviii-lxix (1944-5), pp. 240-270. The same author has already considered elsewhere the iden- tification and architectural type of this small De- lian sanctuary. The sculptures have also been pre- viously published, but were not fully interpreted in relation to their surroundings. The most important is the cult statue of Dionysos, of Parian marble, nude, seated in the theater chair. The author cites as parallels the seated draped Dionysos of the monument of Thrasyllos and Thrasykles in Athens, a small bronze from Manol6 in Bulgaria, which shows the god with right arm upraised crowning himself (a motive borrowed from the "Lycian" Apollo), and the Dionysos on the frieze of the the- ater at Athens. The connection with the theater is emphasized. Attitude and style are post-classical, and show an eclectic combination of Praxitelean and Lysippic traits; the origin of this style, it is sug- gested, may have been Pergamum. The object be- side the god's left leg is doubtless a snake, naturally associated with Dionysos in his chthonian aspect. Dionysos was flanked by two figures of actors dressed as silens, with himation, ivy wreath, tym- panum and wine-skin. In connection with the re- ligious aspect of this group, Picard studies a stuc- coed poros relief found near the Stibadeion, show- ing Dionysos dressed as Artemis; he concludes that the Stibadeion may have been the site of the cere- mony of investing Artemis periodically with a new chiton, while the discarded one was draped over Dionysos. This quasi-hermaphroditic aspect of Di- onysos is seen also in a relief from Chalkis, showing the god in the garb of the Thracian Artemis, Ben- dis. Lastly Picard considers an ex-voto from the Stibadeion with an enormous serpent (Dionysos?) flanked by two figures, here identified as Agathe Tyche and Agathodaimon, holding cornucopias. Taken together, this group of sculptures affords a rare insight into the cult practiced in this modest but by no means insignicant sanctuary. (W. K. P.) THE AMAZONOMACHY ON THE SHIELD OF THE ATHENA PARTHENOS.--Suzanne Ras restudies in BCH, lxviii-lxix (1944-5), pp. 163-205, the Ama- zonomachy depicted on the exterior of the shield of the Athena Parthenos. Indirect witnesses (ancient texts) and direct (copies of the shield) are first ana- lysed. The author draws up a table in which each figure in the composition is listed with initials indi- cating which copy or copies it occurs on, and these are equated with the tables published by Michaelis and Schrader. There follows a description of the five copies, of which the Strangford Shield is the most nearly complete. An analysis of the shield based on the combined evidence of the copies re- veals that there was a tripartite composition in which the lapse of time was suggested by the de- picting of successive stages of the combat. It seems certain that Pericles and Phidias formed the central group in the upper part. The Amazonomachy had been previously depicted by Polygnotus and Micon</page><page sequence="6">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIGEST 887 in the Poikile and the Theseion, but these works ap- parently pictured the scene at the height of the ac- tion, and had little in common with our shield. However, another work by Micon, the battle of Marathon, in the Poikile, employed a tripartite com- position which may have influenced Phidias. Some details were borrowed from earlier works (the Peri- cles-Phidias group from the west pediment at Olym- pia). Phidias' originality comes out most clearly in the rendition of violent movement in some of the Amazon figures. The pictorial background is prob- ably meant to represent the Acropolis. The compo- sition of the shield is echoed in several vases; single figures recur more widely. The article concludes with a brief consideration of the neo-Attic bas-re- liefs recently found at the Peiraeus, and the conclu- sion is reached that these too show the influence of the shield, though they cannot be considered actual copies. (W. K. P.) Vases ANDOKIDES PAINTER.--Writing in Mnemosyne, Bibliotheca Classica Batava, 3d ser., xiii, 3 (1947), pp. 237 f., A. W. Byvanck would date the work of the Andokides painter according to the principle that the earliest are those with identical scenes in red and black-figure technique, and next those with both red and black-figure, but different scenes on the two sides. PROTOCORINTHIAN ALABASTRON IN CRETE.-- REA, xlii (1940), pp. 106-110, Pierre Demargne dis- cusses an alabastron recently acquired by the Mu- seum of Candia from a native of the village of Vrachasi. In respect to its rounded bottom and small mouth, the alabastron is similar to the usual Proto- corinthian types, but its almost spherical belly sug- gests that it is either a hybrid combination of the slender Protocorinthian type with a round vase or that it is nearer the spherical Egyptian alabastra in inspiration. If the latter alternative is accepted, it serves as an intermediary beween the Oriental and Greek types; the fact that it comes from a pro- vincial area in Crete would not necessitate dating it as far back as if it were from Cnossos. The sil- houette design, incised at the edges and in internal detail, also suggests early Protocorinthian origin as does the large, naively designed lion which covers most of the belly of the alabastron. The fact re- mains, however, that the Protocorinthian chronol- ogy cannot be applied exactly to provincial Crete and that it is idle to attempt to date the alabastron precisely within the seventh century. VASES IN MARSEILLES.--In the REA, xlii (1940), pp. 127-180, pls. I-I, Charles Dugas dis- cusses several interesting Attic vases in the Museum of Marseilles, and published summarily by Dumont in 1884 and noticed occasionally later. Two are good examples of red-figure from the later fifth century, and one the work of the Eretria Painter. CRETAN COMMON POTTERY.--In REA, xliii (1941), pp. 5-15, Fernand Chapouthier discusses the relation of plain pottery to daily life of the Minoan period. He points out the difficulty which has always been experienced in determining the use of various practical containers and utensils and sug- gests two ways of approaching the problem. Direct deduction is possible when remains of the materials held are found in the container; deduction by anal- ogy is made by comparing vessels of one area with similar vessels of known use in a nearby area. This second method depends on the similarity between the climate and resources of the various Mediter- ranean lands and the similarity of the resulting prac- tical utensils. Interesting examples are given of each method of investigation. The first method shows the enigmatical "fire boxes" to be incense burners in which coals in the upper portion cause the seeds in the lower portion to give off fragrant odors. The second method is illustrated in the identification of a rack for meat skewers. The author concludes with the recommendation that these common practical objects receive more emphasis in the museums and that they be studied in closer relation to the rooms in which they are found. CHTHONAN DIONYsos.-H. Metzger in BCH, lxviii-lxix (1944-5), pp. 296-339, studies the sub- ject of the Chthonian Dionysos in the figural monu- ments of the classical period. The study is based mostly on Attic black- and red-figured vases. Three different divinities are distinguished: Dionysos as the god of growing vegetation, as underworld di- vinity, and as an Eleusinian god.-I. The two key examples of Dionysos as divinity of growing vege- tation are the Hope crater in the British Museum, of the early fourth century, in which a youthful male figure emerges from the earth, greeted by a small Nike and surrounded by other figures; and a leky- thos in the Athenian market, late sixth or early fifth century and belonging to the best period of black- figured while lekythoi. It shows the bust of a bearded man emerging from the ground, flanked by a maenad and a silen. This scene is interpreted as an anodos, by analogy with a somewhat similar rep- resentation on a later lekythos in the Bibliotheque Nationale. Buschor's theory, that representations of the anodos theme in fifth century vase-painting owe their origin to contemporary satyric drama, while in the fourth century there is a new symbolic em-</page><page sequence="7">888 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY phasis traceable to religious sources, is examined and rejected; it seems likely that the fifth century satyric drama was itself derived from the same popular mythology that is reflected in the vase- paintings. Moreover, the action of the maenad and the silen on the Athens lekythos does not accord with the usual formula for the anodos, and must have had a different origin. The difference between fifth and fourth century representations of this theme is simply that between the general concep- tions of vase decoration in the two centuries. In any event, the Athens vase demonstrates that the Attic ceramists of the early fifth century were familiar with the terrestrial epiphany of Dionysos, which took place in spring. There is a parallel tradition by which the god came from the sea. Dionysos in this aspect as a god of growing vegetation must be distinguished from the Thracian Dionysos whose rites were celebrated in winter. --II. Dionysos as un- derworld divinity. There is but slender textual evi- dence that Dionysos was considered a god of the underworld. Figural monuments, however, fre- quently show him associated or confounded with infernal deities, appearing with Pluto and Perse- phone in a "sacra conversazione." On some monu- ments, Persephone becomes the wife or mother of Dionysos; on others, Dionysos is identified with Pluto. Representations of this fusion of types in- clude a group of funerary busts from Boeotia and Locris, a large number of terracottas from Taren- tum, a cup by the Codros painter in the British Museum, and three vases showing Herakles bearing a bearded figure (Dionysos-Pluto) on his back through the water. The general conclusion is drawn that from at least the fourth century on, Dionysos was popularly given the attributes of an under- world divinity.-III. Dionysos as an Eleusinian di- vinity. Opinion has been divided as to how im- portant a r6le Dionysos played in the rites of Eleu- sis. Metzger adduces eleven monuments (nine vase paintings, two reliefs) of which the majority belong to the fourth century and seem to show the in- creased importance of Dionysos at this time, as a co-recipient of homage with Demeter and Perse- phone. On a second series of monuments (three vases, one relief), the figure of an infant is shown being presented by one female figure to another; after discussing the identity of the infant, the author arrives at the conclusion that these vases attest a fusion of the myths of the births of Dionysos and Pluto, and suggests that this scene may prove the penetration of Dionysiac elements into the Eleu- sinian tradition, in the second half of the fourth century. Dionysos may also have been substituted for Pluto in the formula announced by the hiero- phant in the Eleusinian rites. We may conclude that from the fourth century on, Dionysos occupied an important place at Eleusis both as an adult and as an infant divinity, a fact which may help explain the richer symbolism of the treatment of the Dio- nysos theme at this time. The frequent representa- tions of the Dionysiac thiasos are probably to be interpreted as expressions of immortality. (W. K. P.) Inscriptions THE DECREES OF KALLIAS, by H. T. Wade- Gery and Benjamin D. Meritt (Hesperia, xvi, 4 [Oct.-Dec., 1947], pp. 279-286) is a defense against Dinsmoor (AJA, li, [1947], pp. 109-151) of the traditional date 434/3 (as against 438/7) for the well-known decrees of financial reform and the re- habilitation of the Acropolis. (1) To Dinsmoor's ar- gument that the Athenian treasury was too depleted by 434/3 to permit the rehabilitation of the Acropo- lis so late, the authors rejoin that dating the Kallias decrees in 438 does not solve the problem of Thu- cydides, ii, 13.3. (2) Dinsmoor argues that it is senseless to assume authorization as late as 434 for carving already done in 438. The rejoinder is that the Kallias decrees provide for the completion, not the inception, of the Parthenon pediments, the golden Nikai, and the Propylaia, all three nearly finished. Indeed the Parthenon pediments were planned and authorized before 438. (3) According to Dinsmoor, since the general reorganization of the Acropolis authorized in the Kallias decrees is con- firmed in the Propylaia accounts of 437/6 and 434/3, the Kallias decrees are therefore at least as early as 437. But the Propylaia decrees provide for "wages," not "work," and the wages were in pay- ment for landscaping, which did not begin with Kallias; he is simply systematizing, getting rid of commitments as soon as he decently can; again there is no need to antedate. This reasoning is sup- ported by a new text of ATL, i (1939), pp. 160-161, D2, lines 1-15. (4) Dinsmoor, to avoid the hiatus, on his dating, between the Kallias decrees and the extant inventories which they sanctioned, is forced to assume that inventories for 438-434 were drawn up on paper but not cut on stone. This, it is ar- gued, is not economy of hypothesis. Further, the extant series of inventories of the Treasurers of Athena begin in 434, are continued on two other stones to 422, and then further continued on the reverse of the 434 stone, which was therefore the earliest. (5) Dinsmoor's final argument for the 438/7 dating is that the two small archaic temples which he alleges were pulled down in 438 under the terms of the Kallias decree were reused as early as 487 in the foundations of the Propylaia. But the Kallias</page><page sequence="8">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIGEST 389 decrees do not mention these temples, nor do the decrees prove that Athena's treasure was housed in them in the mid fifth century B.c. In fact, the tem- ples are mentioned for the first and last time in 485, and may (for all Kallias tells us) have remained stacked as building material on the Acropolis since 479. On these grounds Wade-Gery and Meritt ar- gue that there is little room to doubt the now gen- erally accepted assignment of the Kallias decrees to 434 B.C. (P. L. MacK.) INSCRIPTIONS FROM ATHENS.--In Hesperia xvi, 4 (1947), pp. 262-266, Markellos Th. Mitsos publishes 22 fragments from south of the Olym- pieion and from the Epigraphic Museum, which help to locate more accurately the shrine of the Pythian Apollo; indicate a settlement of metics in the Olympieion area; provide a list of votive offer- ings dedicated to Athena Polias or Artemis Brau- ronia; and join four pairs of inscriptions now pub- lished separately in IG, ii2. (P. L. MacK.) ATTIC EPIGRAMS.-In Hesperia, xvi, 4 (1947), pp. 287-289, Benjamin D. Meritt publishes two Attic epigrams. One presents from the manuscript notes of Sir George Wheler (1676) a new reading of IG, ii2, 4321; the other, from the same notes, is new: a mother's inscription for the tombstone of her child. (P. L. MacK.) INSCRIPTIONS FROM ARcos.-W. Vollgraff pub- lishes in BCH, lxviii-lxix (1944-5), pp. 391-403, a group of inscriptions from Argos. The more im- portant include a new text of IG, iv, 555, which is identified as a decree of the Argive people from the fifth century; a stele dedicated to the three Eumenides, who are also represented in the relief above the inscribed text; and eight small fragments of a text which deals with the expropriation of land for the construction of a Roman aqueduct. Brief notices are given of three funerary inscriptions, a terracotta theater tessara, a Rhodian amphora handle, and two Byzantine inscriptions. (W.K.P.) INSCRIPTIONS FROM DELPHI.-G. Daux pub- lishes in BCH, lxviii-lxix (1944-5), pp. 94-128, a lengthy series of unedited inscriptions, new joins, and corrections. Many of these fragments have re- mained unpublished as long as thirty years, and in some cases Daux relies on the earlier transcriptions of Haussoulier and Homolle. The more important items include no. 11, a fragment of SIG3, 608, dated 178 B.C. (published from a squeeze made thirty years ago), which praises a Greek of Elea in Lucania, who is named as both proxenos and theo- rodochos, two privileges which the editor discusses; and no. 18, in honor of Philonikos son of Diodoros, a member of an important Delphic family of the period of the XXVIth priesthood. On the basis of a hitherto unnoticed monogram, Daux identifies (no. 8) the Orchomenians named in GDI, 2661, as natives of Arcadia. Of the twelve manumissions, the earliest (no. 19) is dated in 177/6. No. 23 (145 B.c.) names as witnesses two sculptors of Thebes, father and son, who were already known in numer- ous Delphic documents which the editor lists. Of the miscellaneous inscriptions, two are funerary, and one (no. 35) contains a dedication beneath an imperial statue of either Titus or Domitian. No. 36 is a dedication which lists the agonistic victories of Zosimos, of the end of the first century A.D., hitherto known only by a copy of Cyriac of Ancona (CIG, 1719). Daux marshals the evidence in favor of the restoration of the ethnic Kovre6aG instead of KoLdxeca in GDI, 1529. (W. K. P.) DELPHI.-P. Amandry in BCH, lxviii-lxix (1944-5), pp. 411-416, in a note concerning a religious covenant between Delphi and Skiathos, defends against Bousquet a restoration referring to the granting of sacrificial portions on the day of the Theoxenia. (W. K. P.) STUDIES IN DELIAN EPIGRAPHY are published by J. Tr6heux in BCH, lxviii-lxix (1944-5), pp. 271- 295. In the first part of this article, the author studies the Delian texts which list the vases con- secrated from the revenue of a foundation called the Mikytheion. This foundation permitted the annual dedication of a silver vase valued at one hundred drachmae. For the first time the author connects the lengthy list of vases in IG, xi, 2, 124, lines 24-60, with this foundation. These vases contain the names of all archons between 307 and 225; Tr6heux shows that certain items of this list recur in other inventories. On the basis of this new interpretation, the author concludes that the series of vases from the fund of Mikythos began not in 246, as previous interpreters had supposed, but about 310. This in turn enables Mikythos to be identified with a previously known homonymous wood-merchant of the period before 300. The author also concludes that all the archons of the list must be fixed after 310. The single vases which bear the names of many archons result from the melting down into one of several silver objects already dedicated. Tr6heux offers restorations of other inventories on the basis of his conclusions. -In the second part of the article, he discusses the phrase b havag6r0t v in the Delian account IG, xi, 2, 142, and reaffirms the conclusion of Lacroix that the payments which are listed after this phrase do not represent any portion of the rental for that</page><page sequence="9">890 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY particular financial year, but refer to the preceding year. This deferment of rent, which occurs in the accounts of one year only, was granted to all farmers as a result, Treheux believes, of a disastrous agricultural year, which may have fallen between 308 and 306. He rejects the hypothesis that the conditions of these deferred payments are reflected in certain clauses of the Hiera Syngraphe. Further- more, he reexamines the evidence for the date of the Hiera Syngraphe (Inscriptions de Delos, no. 503) and concludes that it must have preceded by a very short time the reestablishment of decennial leases which occurred in Hekatombaion of 300 B.C. (W. K. P.) HELLENICA.-In the Rev. Phil., xviii (1944), pp. 5-54, L. Robert continues his series of epi- graphical notes entitled "Hellenica," numbers xx- xxvii. They consist of corrections of inscriptions by supplement, reading, understanding, or by tracing their provenience. As usual, there is much of inter- est to the lexicographer or student of the Greek language: so the discovery of pC?'hi in the sense of "booty" in I. Priene, 11 (no. xx), the identification of a number of additional professional nouns in -ig (apaea g, "fennel-dealer"; az9avaig, "wreath- dealer"; xopqupiq "purple-merchant"; no. xxvii), and the claim of =uXuWptov with the meaning "guard- post," based on uWo'p6q, "gate-guard" (which seems a little doubtful). Formulae play a large part in the identification of origins; so xpocPkg in Thasos, valieiov in Cantanus in Crete, ha66cov in Perinthus, &amp; p4l6e in Thera, 6 0N?o r v eitva in Smyrna (corrections of the IG, especially the volume of epitaphs of IG, ii' which I have not seen, and M. Guarducci's Cretan Inscriptions, no. xxvi). In one instance, the verb &amp;7re in an Ana- tolian inscription is recognized as a Pagan survival (like ra~ra) in a Christian inscription ("Observe" that life is like "this"). On the agonistic side, there are notes on the Roman Games at Chalcis (no. xxiii), and on the giving of baskets (xava) as prizes at Ephesus. Interesting is a defense of the Abbe Fourmont, whose reputation has been so blackened by Larfeld and others (p. 19, n. 2). THASIAN EPIGRAPHY.-R. Martin publishes in BCH, lxviii-lxix (1944-45), pp. 154-162, a group of inscriptions found in the 1939 campaign at Thasos. No. 1 is a dedication made by five Thasian pole- marchs in the latter half of the third century B.c. No. 2 is a list containing the names of twelve theoroi from the first half of the third century. Nos. 8 and 4 are dedications to Aphrodite by gyne- conomoi. This board of "regulators of women" is here attested for the first time at Thasos. The author discusses the size and duties of similar boards in other places. No. 5 is a dedication to a Roman emperor, perhaps Hadrian. Martin announces (no. 9) the rediscovery of the statue base published as IG, xii, 8, 435. (W. K. P.) CALYMNOS.-In the REA, xliv (1942), pp. 217- 223, Pierre Roussel discusses an inscription from Calymnos, published by Mario Segre in the Mem- orie del Istituto stor.-arch. of Rhodes, iii (1938), p. 52. It is a manumission of the early Imperial period, dated by the magistrate-god (monarchos) Apollon Kalymnios, and consisting of the simple statement of the manumission with the obligation of life-long paramone. Between the verb nhku06poae6v and the clause xa' xapaave occurs the curious statement, 1'0X e (a lVaog Oi= 0u6pou Wap&amp; 'AppoW0ou o l Nixyg, which Roussel would under- stand to mean, "whom she (the manumittor) took at birth from (the parents) Aphrodius and Nice on the undertaking to make her free." Upon the death of the manumittor, the slave was to be aueourcog, and not to be held for any &amp;'kuepecvpt &amp;-lTaywyY1. THERMOS.-In Hesperia xvi, 4 (Oct.-Dec., 1947), pp. 256-261, Markellos Th. Mitsos discusses "Thermika and Panaitolika," demonstrating that the terms refer, not to the regular meetings of the Aetolian League, but to the magnificent festivals at Thermos described in Polybius 5.8.5. (P. L. MacK.) INSCRIPTIONS IN THE LOUVRE.-In REA, xlii (1940), pp. 89-92, A. Dain reexamines the inter- pretations of two inscriptions in the Louvre. The first (Kaibel, Epigr.Gr., 858), from Miletus, is the dedication for a statue of Posidonios, the prophet of Apollo. The author would keep and interpret literally two words which previous editors have altered, tXya and elev, noting that their use in games of chance makes them appropriate to the selection of a priest by lot. The second inscription (CIG, 7022) is an epitaph of unknown origin. Previous editors have overlooked the play on words between the de- ceased's name, Agathon, the first word of the poem, and the acrostic. The play on words and the literary tone is compared to Plato's Banquet, and an interesting translation in free verse is of- fered in which the acrostic is maintained. Numismatics In "Numismatic Comments," F. M. Heichel- helm (Hesperia, xvi, 4 [Oct.-Dec., 1947], pp. 272- 278, establishes the provenience of about 1500 coins from the W. M. Leake collection in the</page><page sequence="10">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIGEST 891 Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge University. Also in the Fitzwilliam Collection is a Syrian provincial tetradrachm with the head of the Roman emperor Trebonianus Gallus, defaced by three strokes on the obverse and on the reverse by five marks in something like a regular pattern, which may or may not be a sign of value; perhaps the coin represents an official Sassanian issue, an overstrike over the Roman provincial coinage, current during the Persian occupation of Antioch on the Orontes, which began in A.D. 253. (P. L. MacK.) TURKEY INSCRIPTIONS.-In REA, xlii (1940), pp. 302- 322, Louis Robert reconstructs a journey made through Bithynia in 1886 by Georges Radet. Radet copied 142 inscriptions at that time but never published them. Although many have been dis- covered by subsequent archaeologists, Robert is able to cite several which have not been published before and is also able to supplement several later readings made under less favorable circumstances. A text found by G. Mendel at Aricaklar leads to a discussion of emporiarchs in Bithynia in the third century. Observing that the dates on the inscrip- tions are all small numbers (not larger than 23) and finding no reason to suppose that a city was founded which might mark the beginning of an era, the author suggests that these numbers may refer to the reigns of the contemporary emperors (none of which exceeded 23 years after Augustus) although the emperors' names are not mentioned in the inscriptions. This suggestion, however, the author withdraws in an addendum, finding a text published by Wiegand in 1911 dated in the year 50. An unpublished inscription from Narzannar proves that L. Catilius Severus Julianus was legatus pro praetore in Bithynia under Trajan or Hadrian. INSCRIPTIONS.-In the REA, xlii (1940), pp. 136-141, Michel Feyel returns to the fragmentary inscription concerning the sanctuary, or festival, of Apollo Tarsenus in the Pergamene Kingdom (last published, Welles, Royal Correspondence in the Hellenistic Period [1934], no. 47). COMMENT He interprets the letter as a grant of tax- exemption to the sheep-sellers at the festival of the god, similar to the Baitocaece text (Royal Corre- spondence, no. 70), and restores somewhat dif- ferently, without perhaps succeeding in removing all difficulties. In particular, I doubt that it is acceptable Greek to read iviowm ,v . . . v oi eu opsu6'pevoc 7ms -rvopb[va; vt'6prvP ee x'I~0oxo[c], and to understand it as meaning, "those who (regularly) attend the festival." Whether the people be xY]0oxomc or rep]Ilomoc, the genitive should go with them, rather than with the participle crupopeu6uevot, "people of the impending" some- thing. Anything short of a really satisfactory solu- tion leaves so fragmentary a document obscure. (C. B. W.) SYRIA SCULPTURE.-In the REA, xlii (1940), pp. 340- 344, Henri Seyrig publishes a sculptured panel from a capital, found on the Syrian coast north of Latakiah, and finds it of extraordinary interest. Although it is poor work of the third century of our era, the scene may be recognized unquestion- ably as that when Seleucus Nicator, after Ipsus, guided to Mt. Silpius from Antigonea by an eagle, was performing the foundation sacrifice for the city of Antioch, in the presence of the city's Tyche who bears the Apollo of Daphne on her left hand. PALESTINE RocK-CUT TOMBS.-N. Avigad writing in the PEQ, 79th year, July-October 1947, pp. 112-122, comments on three of the tombs near Jerusalem. He discovers that the Monolith at Silwan, the so- called "Tomb of Pharaoh's Daughter," was com- pleted with a pyramidal roof in masonry, and dates from an early, pre-Exilic, period of Egyptian in- fluence. The Umm-al-'Amad Cave north of the city shows interesting architectural features, including an imitation of drafted masonry in the rock face, and a Doric frieze supported by two Ionic columns. The distyle feature of this tomb of late Hellenistic times is repeated in a simpler, unnamed tomb near the "Tomb of the Judges," recently cleared as part of a Jewish subdivision, which the author dates to the beginning of the first century of the Christian Era. BURIAL CUSTOMS.-Writing in the PEQ, 79th year, July-October 1947, pp. 102-111, Samuel Krauss examines the tradition and the archae- ological evidence for the "Sepulchres of the Davidic Dynasty," showing that they were, in fact, buried not only within the city of Jerusalem, but even, when possible, below the Temple area itself. TRANSJORDAN TOPOGRAPHY.-J. Simons reexamines the He- brew nomenclature of the River Zerka, the northern boundary of the Amorite kingdom, and confirms that the historical writers of the Old Testament mean by "Yabboq" in every case the main east-</page><page sequence="11">392 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY west course of this stream (PEQ, 79th year, July- October, 1947, pp. 87-101). EGYPT COPTIC SOLAR ECLIPSE RECORD.-Edwin Brown Allen, in the JAOS, 1xvii (1947), pp. 267- 269, dates an eclipse recorded in a Coptic ostracon from Turin to 10 March, A.D. 601. COPTIC ANTIQUrrmES.-In the JAOS, lxvii, 1947, pp. 323-326, John D. Cooney describes the Coptic Section of the Byzantine Exhibition of the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, taking occasion to correct the attribution and date of certain ivory and bone objects, pointing out the extreme rarity of these materials in early Coptic art. MAGICAL WANDS.-The Egyptian talismans known as magical wands, or more properly knives, which are to be found in most collections of Egyptian art, are discussed by George Steindorff in The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery, ix (1946), pp. 41-51. Several typical specimens from the Walters and elsewhere are illustrated and described in detail. The knives, which were carved from the tusks of the hippopotamus, were decorated with representations of the fantastic creatures believed by the ancient Egyptians to be possessed of magic powers. Little is known about the actual use of the knives. Though most of the known specimens were found in tombs, they were undoubtedly used by the living, chiefly the women and children, as protective amulets. (S. E. F.) KARANIS.-In Hesperia, xvi, 4 (Oct.-Dec., 1947), Verne B. Schuman prints (pp. 267-271) "Two Unpublished Inscriptions from the South Temple Area of Karanis" in the Fayum. One is the dedication of a propylon on behalf of Ptolemy Alexander (95 B.c.); the other a dedication to the crocodile gods on behalf of Commodus (A.D. 180). (P. L. MacK.) IRAQ EXCAVATIONS.-A "Bibliography of Excavations in Iraq (1939-1946)" has been compiled by Gurgis Awad (Sumer, iii, 1 [1947], pp. 30-35). ERmDu.-The important excavations of the Iraq Department of Antiquities at Eridu, announced by the Director-General Naji Al-Asil in Sumer, iii, 1 (Jan. 1947), p. 3, are described ibid., 2 (July 1947), pp. 84-111 by Seton Lloyd and Fuad Safar. In a first season of work, substantial results were obtained, although the hoped-for archives of the Temple of Enki were not found. The ziggurat was discovered to belong to the Third Dynasty of Ur, and under its southern corner was found a series of temples, of which Temples VI and VII belong to the Al-'Ubaid period. An ancient pit below them indicated that there may be five earlier temples still to be explored, carrying the history and the continuity of temple architecture back to the times of the earliest temples of Tepe Gawra. The only discovery in the field of sculpture was that of a stone lion, which has been taken to the Baghdad Museum. The excavations will be continued. ScLPTURE.--In REA, xlii (1940), pp. 323-329, Anna Roes reopens the discussion of the bronze head discovered at Nineveh in 1931 and first pub- lished by Campbell Thompson. Thompson, noting the similarities between the head and the golden casque of Mes-kalam-dug found at Ur, dated the head as far back as 3000; Mallowan, in a more detailed comparison, and noting the excellence of design in the head, moved the date up to the period of Sargon (2500 B.c.). He even suggested with admitted doubts that it might represent Sargon himself and constitute a memorial to him dedicated by his son Maniitusi in the temple at Nineveh. Miss Roes, while admitting the attraction of such a hypothesis, points out the relatively inferior metal work of the Sargonid Period occasioned by lack of tin. A further examination of the details leads her to favor the Gudean Period (2300 B.c.). She cites a remarkably similar head in diorite found at Tello by Sarzec and suggests the existence of a brief but highly developed school of sculpture in the Gudean Period. These two examples indicate that the products of this school included the most beautiful portraits which Mesopotamian Art pro- duced. VOTIVE VASE FROM WARKA.-In Sumer, iii (1947), pp. 118-127 (pp. 193-201 of the Arabic section), Faraj Basmachi publishes a stone vase from Level III at Warka, which had been mended in antiquity and which must go back to the period of Level IV. It contains relief decoration in a series of registers, recording offerings of a prince to the goddess In-anna. KASSITE FIGURINES.-In the same journal, pp. 19-22, Mohammed Ali Mustafa lists thirty-nine figurines from a find at 'Aqar Quf of the Kassite Period. They consist of crude human representa- tions, and rather better figures of animals. CUNEIFORM STUoIES.-In Sumer, iii (1947), pp. 112-117, Taha Baqir, Curator of the Iraq Museum in Baghdad, describes the unpublished texts in the</page><page sequence="12">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIGEST 893 Museum, with a Foreword by S. N. Kramer. In- cluding the 16,000 from Warka returned from Berlin just before the War, the grand total is nearly 20,000, with the Old Babylonian Period best repre- sented. GEOGRAPHICAL LIsTs.-In Sumer, iii (1947), pp. 48-83, Selim J. Levy publishes, with an intro- duction by S. N. Kramer, a new geographical list from Tel Harmal, containing, with a duplicate list, 210 geographical names. For comparison is included a new collation (by Kramer) of the Nippur list of the University Museum in Philadelphia. BUILDING OF THE "MEDIAN WALL."-The forti- fications of Babylon in the days of the New King- dom are illuminated by two tablets of Nebuchad- nezzar published in Sumer, iii (1947), pp. 4-18, by Selim J. Levy. THE WATER SUPPLY OF ERBmIL.-Fuad Safar reports in Sumer, iii (1947), pp. 23-28, on the discovery of an inscription and traces of construc- tion north of Erbil which explain Sennacherib's measures to supply the city with water from the hills. The account is repeated in the Arabic section of the journal with several plates and drawings, pp. 77-86. CALLIGRAPHY AND ORTHOGRAPHY.-The latest volume of Sumer, iii (1947), in its Arabic section, contains three interesting studies. Raphail Babu Ishaq discusses, with illustrations, pp. 318-327, the Aramaic script, Nasir Naqshabandi (pp. 129-142), the origins of Arabic lettering, and the same scholar (below, pp. 312-317) the calligraphy of the Mirjan Mosque. ARYAN PROPER NAMEs.-Writing in the JAOS, lxvii (1947), pp. 251-253, P.-E. Dumont calls at- tention to the recent investigation of Aryan names in Mitanni, Nuzi, and Syrian cuneiform documents of the second millennium B.c., and adds some identifications of his own. The language spoken by the bearers of these names was more like Old Indic than Old Iranian, their worship included Indra, the Wind God, the God of Heaven, Soma, the Devas, and Rta or Divine Law, and their interests centered upon horses and horse racing, with chariots. IRAN PARTHIAN SCULPTURE.--(From a Baghdad newspaper in English, date not included, forwarded by A. Goetze.) A French archaeological expedition which has been working for a good many years at Susa, recently unearthed a bas-relief of con- siderable historic and artistic interest. It is in the form of a tablet, some three feet square, and shows Artabanus V, last of the Parthian rulers, who was defeated and killed by Ardashir, founder of the Sassanid Empire, in 224 A.D. The King is seated on his throne, a sword in his left hand, presenting a ring to a satrap, believed to be the Governor of Susa. The clothes, crown and jewels of Artabanus and his minion are shown in remarkable detail, as are the designs on the throne. An inscription in Pahlevi recounts the battles and victories of the King. INDIA CHRONOLOGY.-"The Chronology of Prehistoric North-West India" is surveyed by Stuart Piggott in Ancient India, i (Jan. 1946), pp. 8-26, with a series of very illuminating maps, tables, and illustra- tions. The ten recognized cultures divide into Red and Buff Ware groups, and both are related to divisions based on a similar characteristic in Meso- potamia and Iran. In general, the five major Indian groups, Quetta-Amri-Nal, Zhob, Kulli-Shahi Tump, Chanhu Daro, and Mohenjo Daro, fit into a chrono- logical scheme, in this order from earlier to later, and the earliest contemporary with the later Ubaid period. Some, at least, notably the Kulli of Baluchi- stan, seem to be direct imports from the West, and this culture may reflect early trade from Elam to the East. The origins of the Harappa culture, con- temporary with and in many ways similar to Early Dynastic Sumer, remain still obscure. PREHISTORY.-K. R. Srinivasan in Ancient India, ii (July 1946), pp. 9-16, considers the mega- lithic burials and the urn-fields of southern India in the light of Tamil literature, and comes to the conclusion that the burial practices originated as early as the third century B.c., and were gradually modified under "Aryan" influence in the first Chris- tian centuries, bringing in Vedic sacrifice and cremation. PREHISTORY.-Writing in the American Anthro- pologist, 1, no. 1, part 1 (Jan.-March 1948), pp. 173 f., Eugene C. Worman, Jr., calls attention to the important work of Dr. Hakmukh D. Sankalia of Deccan College in Poona. In Baroda, he has worked out a stratigraphic sequence in the valley of the Sabarmati river. Above bedrock occur 10-15 ft. of river gravels containing palaeolithic instruments, and above that, 15-20 ft. of silt with better hand- axes. Above this occurs 80-40 ft. of "loessic silt" of a perhaps post-Pleistocene date, toward the top of which has been found the first truly microlithic culture complex in India.</page><page sequence="13">894 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY TAXILA.-In Ancient India, i (Jan. 1946), pp. 27-36, G. M. Young publishes a number of items found in a context datable to the last quarter of the fourth century B.c. A hoard of 33 "bent-bar" silver coins dated by one of Philip Aridaeus to about 317 B.c. suggests that it was in this native form that was made the present of 80 talents to Alex- ander by Omphis in 326 B.c. Other finds included gold beads, silver ornaments, and a number of interesting intaglios with animal scenes, somewhat archaic work of an Ionian Greek continuing a style known to him before he came to this distant out- post. ROMAN TRADING STATION AT ARKIAMEDU.-- This, one of the most interesting archaeological events to have been reported from India, at any rate from the Classical point of view, in recent years, finds an adequate publication by a group of Indian archaeologists, particularly A. Ghosh and Krishna Deva, under the direction of R. E. M. Wheeler, in Ancient India, ii (June 1946), pp. 17-124, with numerous plates, plans and sections, and drawings. Lying on a lagoon or estuary two miles south of Pondichery, the site may tentatively be identified with Ptolemy's Podouke, perhaps like Pondichery itself an attempt to render a Tamil name meaning "Newtown." It was certainly one of the treaty-ports of which Ptolemy writes, and which were known from Tamil writers as "the abodes of the Yavanas whose prosperity never waned." While the estuary has now silted up, the site must have been an excellent harbor in antiquity, and the remains of its buildings, lying little above high-water level along the water-front, together with the finds, in- dicate that the town manufactured as well as dealt in muslin and beads. Its general date is furnished by the Arretine ware which occurs in stratification. From the West came also numerous amphorae with oil or wine and a kind of rouletted ware. Local ware, earlier, contemporary, or later, is plentiful and gives occasion for an extended catalogue occupying over forty pages; it shows no real simi- larity to the contemporary pottery of the north (Ahichchhatra). Some Chinese celadon ware occurs on the surface, and testifies to activity on the site five or six centuries later. Numerous sherds contain texts in Tamil, of considerable palaeographical in- terest. Apparently, the Roman occupation extended roughly through the first two centuries of our era. No Roman coins have been found there, but the author adds a "Coin List," giving, with reference to a map, Roman coins found elsewhere in India. It is noteworthy that the hoards of the first and second centuries cluster about the southern end of the peninsula, or stretch up along the east coast. They range in date from the late Republic (in the Punjab) and Augustus (Madras) to Constantine and Theodosius, although the finds in Ceylon are a little later. POTTERY.-The work of the Archaeological Survey of India at Ahichchhatra, on the upper Ganges in north-central India, is the basis of a series of studies in Ancient India, i (Jan. 1946), pp. 87-59. In an introduction, A. Ghosh presents the chronology of the site, the nine strata extending from before 300 B.c. to about A.D. 1100. The pottery itself is described with an admirable set of drawings by K. C. Panigrahi, while an Appendix on the "Northern Black Polished Ware" by Krishna Deva lists the other sites where this occurs. THE NAME OF KUSHA IN CHINESE SOURCES.- Under the title "Linguistics in History," Robert Shafer in the JAOS, lxvii (1947), pp. 296-305, re- views from the points of view of chronology and linguistics the possibility of the equation Yiieh- chih=Kusha, as recently argued in the same journal (lxv, 1945, pp. 71-81) by Otto Maenchen-Helfen, and finds it in the negative on all counts. ITALY GENERAL.-Of interest to archaeologists are recent publications of the Reale Istituto di Studi Romani. The series entitled Italia Romana: Muni- cipi e Colonie has added two of its useful local volumes, Ancona (ser. 1, vol. viii; regio v, Picenum) by Mario Moretti (pp. 112 and pls. xvI; 1945) and Interamna Lirenas vel Sucasina (ser. 2, vol. ii; regio i, Latium et Campania, by Michelangelo Cagiano de Azevedo (pp. 53 and pls. ii; 1947). The organization of both is the same, consisting of his- tory, monuments, territory, and literary and epi- graphical sources. Of a more technical character are the Quaderni dell'Impero, La Scienza e la tecnica ai tempi di Roma imperiale, of which we have xix, Scienza e tecnica di Roma docu- mentate dall'Impresa di Nemi by Guido Ucelli (1946, pp. 15 and pls. vii) and xx, La Metallurgia ai tempi dell'Impero romano by Rinaldo Binaghi (1946, pp. 21 and pls. Iv). REALISTIC PORTRAITS.-Berta Segall con- tributes an outline of the development of realism in sculptured portraits during the Hellenistic period to The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery, ix (1946), pp. 53-67, in connection with the publication of a little bronze bust of Ptolemy I, from the Walters Collection. This piece, which depicts the ruler</page><page sequence="14">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIGEST 895 wearing the head-dress of Dionysus, may once have ornamented a funerary couch. It was found in a grave near Tarentum. Realism in portraiture was obtained by the Egyptians through the use of plaster masks taken from life. This technique was adopted by Greek artists during the fourth century. (S. E. F.) THE "GRAND CAMEE DE FRANCE."--Writing in Mnemosyne, Bibliotheca Classica Batava, 3d ser., xiii, 3 (1947), pp. 239 f., A. W. Byvanck offers an interpretation of this cameo, important for Roman art and Roman history. He would explain the figure being borne aloft on a winged horse as Germanicus, dead in A.D. 19, represented as a poet and being presented with a celestial sphere by a Chaldean as the translater of Aratus. Below, Tiberius sits with his family, and the author would see the cameo as the gift of Livia, her daughter-in-law Antonia, and her grandson's wife Agrippina, re- minding the Emperor that while his sons were dead, there remained the three grandsons, Nero, Drusus, and Gaius. TERRACOTTA Disc.-In REA, xliv (1942), pp. 191-216, Pierre Boyanc6 discusses at some length the significance and use of a terracotta disc now at the Museum of Brindisi. An examination of the eleven-figure zodiacal band and of the subject of the relief leads the author to date it in the third century B.c. He finds in it a combination of Pythagorean astronomy and the Dionysian myth of the apotheosis of Semele. The two elements are combined in the presence both of Dionysus to lead his mother heavenward and of the lightning of Zeus, a divine agent more suggestive of Pythagorean thought and of the Romulus legend. The author suggests that the disc was made to glorify a sacer matratus and that two discs, made to fit one against the other, might have served as a means of identi- fication. POLYCHROME VASES.-Two polychrome pastel and relief vases from the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore supply Dorothy Kent Hill ("Bacchic Erotes at Tarentum," Hesperia, xvi, 4 [Oct.-Dec., 1947], pp. 248-255) with evidence to push back into the mid third century B.c. the well-known motif of Cupids engaged in the tasks and pleasures of men, as seen in the wall paintings of the House of the Vettii at Pompeii. These tasks and pleasures are so often connected with the vintage as to suggest a connection of Erotes with the Bacchic cult. The vases also suggest that the Romans copied Hellenistic art as enthusiastically as Hellenistic literature. (P. L. MacK.) BARBOTINE WARE OF THE AUGUSTAN PERIOD. -A superb jug with barbotine decoration from the Walters Collection, said to be from Samsoun, Pon- tus, is published in The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery, ix (1946), pp. 69-79, by Dorothy Kent Hill. This vase bears a charming scene of two rather fanciful birds feeding from a stylized plant. Somewhat similar designs occur on other specimens of the ware, which are re-studied by the author, and on silver cups. These pieces bear witness to the high quality of the minor arts in the Augustan period. (S. E. F.) TERRACOTTA.-In the REA, xlii (1940), pp. 408-411, Franz Cumont recognizes in a fragmentary terracotta plaque now in the Louvre a presentation of the apotheosis of Trajan as Kosmokrator, es- corted in the chariot of the Sun and surrounded by the signs of the zodiac. INSCRIPTIONS.-In the REA, xliv (1942), pp. 135-138, H. I. Marrou and J. Meyerovitch discuss an opisthograph marble plaque found at Hercu- laneum by Maiuri. It was attached to the outside of a wall, which had thereby been declared to be the private and perpetual property of two different individuals in succession. The authors conclude that the persons named held successive perpetual leases on the wall by right of "superficies." The plaque thus proves that this right was transferable and that it extended at least as far back as A.D. 42, the date of the death of the last of the three princesses to which the "Julia" who was the last lease-holder may apply. NORTH AFRICA DISCOVERIES AT ELLES.-In BCTH, May 1943, pp. xv-xvii, Gilbert Picard reports on archaeological activities in Tunisia in 1942; part of his report is devoted to the discoveries at Elles. The discoveries include a mosaic floor of uneven workmanship, combining geometric design with a Venus, flanked by two centauresses, stallions, wreaths, and fish; a Christian lamp, almost intact; a fragment of a lamp; and fragments of the bottom of a dish in red earthenware decorated with Latin crosses. DISCOVERIES AT THELEPTE.-In BCTH, June 1943, pp. ix-xii, the report of Gilbert Picard on Tunisian archaeology includes a mosaic discovered at Thelepte. It is intact for only two meters, but it once filled the entire floor of the oecus with a scene from the amphitheater. The extant area shows an armed gladiator in combat with a lion while other combatants around the edge arouse the beast with cloths. The technique, the materials,</page><page sequence="15">396 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY and the figures lead Picard to date the mosaic about A.D. 250. Picard also describes two statues found in the square mausoleum at Thelepte: one a well executed, acephalous woman dressed in a tunic; the other, more crudely worked, a man in a tunic with a skin cloak hung from his right shoulder. Both statues are now at the museum of Bardo. EXCAVATIONS IN SPANISH MOROCCO.-In BCTH, March 1944, pp. vii-x, R. Lantier sum- marizes Pelayo Quintero Atauri's report on the archaeological activities in Spanish Morocco during the last forty years. Discoveries range in time from the Palaeolithic to the Carthaginian and Roman periods. THE UTERE FELIX FOUNTAIN AT CARTHAGE.- In BCTH, Jan. 1948, pp. xvi-xxii, Raymond Lantier describes an early third century fountain which formed part of a luxurious house at Carthage. The fountain is surrounded with mosaics and decorated with paintings depicting still-life and marine scenes and human figures, especially babies. The author concludes with reflections on the luxury and taste of the rich Romans at Carthage. A marked similarity is noted between the designs of mosaics and paint- ings with reference to the Maison de la Voliere, with its significant atrium, fountains, mosaics, and columns. STELE FROM THE SANCTUARY OF SATURN AT THUGGA.-In BCTH, Feb. 1942, pp. xii-xxviii, Louis Poinssot describes a find of 249 stelae in a pit in the temple of Saturn at Thugga. They are cut in native limestone, none exceeding 80-90 cm. in height. Of the total number, 6 depict human beings, 82 animals, and 156 various floral or other symbols. The crescent moon, sometimes with a star, is a typical feature. Animals are shown approaching altars; worshippers are represented with raised hands. The sacred tree or branch brings out the agricultural nature of the cult. In one case (no. 28) the panelled door of the temple is shown with a triangular window above it. All date before A.D, 195, and while crude, testify to the character of the cult. SCULPTURE.-In BCTH, Feb. 1941, pp. xv- xxii, Alfred Merlin describes a small statue, of the Roman period, representing Leda reclining nude with the divine swan mounted on her thighs. In studying the history of the group in Greek sculp- ture, he finds the origin of this type in the Hellen- istic period, and points out that it is later than that of the standing Leda. RELIEF FROM KEF.-In BCTH, Jan. 1944, pp. xii-xviii, A. Merlin publishes a marble fragment found at Kef, ancient Sicca Veneria, in Tunis, de- picting the upper part of a male torso attempting to control a rearing horse: perhaps a Triton with a hippocampus. The marble dates from the second century and may have been used on a fountain. The workmanship is excellent and is remarkable for the incised grooves marking the outlines of the figures. Merlin feels that this technique cannot belong only to Romano-Provengal art. RELIEF OF VOLUBILIS.-In BCTH, March 1942, pp. xiv-xvii, and pl. I, Louis Chatelain describes a bas-relief found at Volubilis, in Morocco, represent- ing three persons, two lacking heads, who may be non-Roman soldiers, perhaps Dacian. The fragment is of mediocre workmanship and may date from the late second century. It does not belong to the arch of Caracalla, but poor as it is, it adds to the small stock of Roman sculpture from Volubilis. IBERIAN VASES.-In BCTH, Feb. 1944, pp. xi-xv, R. Lantier calls attention to an article by A. Garcia y Bellido (Archivo espaniol de arqueologia, no. 43, 1941, pp. 347-349) concerning the clandes- tine excavation of seventy burials near Oran. They included ceramics of various sorts, coins, and baskets of the third century B.C. and are taken to be burials of the Iberian mercenaries recruited by Hannibal (219-218 B.C.) to police African territory. Lantier also cites the findings of the Tamuda excavation near Tetouan containing Iberian coins and inscrip- tions as well as imitations of Iberian pottery, all of the second century B.C. OENOCHOE FROM THE NECROPOLIS OF AL AUJA.-In BCTH, May 1944, pp. x-xviii, A. Merlin publishes an oenochoe, now at the Louvre, with neck in the form of a woman's head. It is decorated by a band of eight human and mythological figures in stamped relief, with very little connection with each other. Similarities with several motifs on oenochoes at the Bardo Museum lead Merlin to attribute the oenochoe to the atelier of Navigius. TERRACOTTA AMPHORAS FROM AUJA.-In BCTH, Nov. 1943, pp. xvii-xxv, A. Merlin publishes an example at the Louvre of the moulded amphoras from the workshop of Navigius. This jar bears the mark of its maker, and its cylindrical body is divided into two tiers of three zones each. The decorations deal with Satyrs, Maenads, Venus, and several hunt scenes; many of the details are similar to those in other stamped amphoras from the same shop. The work is hasty and gross and has little artistic</page><page sequence="16">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIGEST 397 composition; the execution is much more careless than that of Italian or Gallic workshops of the same period. MOSAIC AT SOUSSE.-In BCTH, Nov. 1941, pp. xi-xix, A. Truillot describes the mosaics decorating the floor of a room at Sousse. The decoration in- cludes scenes of animals: a hare, a gazelle, a fawn seen in rear perspective, a parrot, and a partridge, and four medallions representing the four seasons. The mosaic contains the word MACARI, which the author takes as the name of the Greek mosaicist. CHRISTIAN MOSAICS AT SOUSSE.-In BCTH, Nov. 1940, pp. v-viii, Jacques Zeiller presents an abstract of the report of A. Truillot and Major Martingnon on Christian mosaics found at Sousse in 1939. The mosaics are in a pavement in which were sunk twelve tombs. The mosaic continues over these, and contains geometrical designs, traditional Christian symbols, and funerary inscriptions of the traditional Christian form. The mosaics date from the late fourth or early fifth centuries and fill a gap between those of catacombs at S6vbre and those of the basilica of Uppenna. AMULETS.-A. Merlin in REA, xlii (1940) pp. 486-493, discusses a lead amulet found in Haidra (ancient Ammaodara). The charm is small and round, and bears on the obverse an owl within a border and on the reverse an inscription in re- lief. The author compares seven other amulets with the owl design, all large and executed in bronze or copper. In general, the owl, representing "in- vidia," is addressed first with various plays on the word and then ordered not to enter the pure and spotless heart of the wearer. INSCRIPTIONS.-In BCTH, Dec. 1944, pp. xiii- xxii, Louis Leschi publishes an inscription concern- ing land assignment which was found in 1943 in the region of Guelalia. Dating from A.D. 198, it records the fact that a three-man commission has appraised an area of land with respect to its agri- cultural, pastural, and water facilities, and has as- signed it certain colonists (whose names have been effaced). Dating from a period when the expansion of Rome was almost at a peak, it shows that the legate had not only military duties, but also duties of evaluating, organizing, and assigning the new territories as well. The colonization of the border lands of Africa thus began under Septimius Severus and not under his successors as has been frequently maintained. INSCRIPTION OF PETITJEAN.-In BCTH, Jan. 1944, pp. xviii-xxiv, Louis Chatelain mentions an inscription set up in honor of Severus Alexander by the fourth cohort of Gauls. The importance of the inscription lies in the fact that it testifies to the existence of Roman ruins near Petitjean. The road from Volubilis to Tangiers followed the valley of the Redom and the station Aquae Daciae can be identified with a sulfurous spring near Bab Tiouka about 3 kilometers from Petitjean. This leads him to identify "Gilda" with the Biarnay farm in the K6michet area. Although no systematic excavations have been made at this location, large numbers of Roman sherds and fragments have been dis- covered. HOARD FROM SMINJA.-In BCTH, May 1942, pp. ix-xiii, Louis Poinssot reports a hoard of 949 coins discovered in 1938 at Sminja, in Tunisia. The earliest coins go back to the third century B.c., but most of them are Republican asses of the period 89-42 B.c. ROMAN COINS FOUND AT SOUSSE.-In BCTH, May 1940, pp. ix-xi, J. Farrugia catalogues a hoard of coins discovered near Souesse. They were buried during the reign of Gallienus (A.D. 253-268) and go back as far as Claudius Albinus. Of the 603 coins recovered, several represent interesting variations on those listed in Cohen's Monnaies imperiales and one, of Julia Domna, is not in that collection. HOARD OF ROMAN COINs.-In BCTH, June 1941, pp. xv-xxii, J. Farrugia describes a hoard of 1,253 coins found in 1935 at El-Hamadi near Zaris in Tunisia. The coins appear to have been buried during the last years of the reign of Gallienus and extend back to the period of Septimius Severus. SPAIN GENERAL.-As part of the series of studies sponsored by the Reale Istituto di Studi Romani entitled Quaderni deli' Impero, Orme di Roma nel Mondo, a pamphlet has appeared recently (1946) by Juan Serra Vilaro entitled Scavi e ritrovamenti in Spagna (vol. vii, pp. 27 and pls. xii). While the main body of the pamphlet is concerned only with the author's own investigations in Tarragona, with the "cyclopean" walls, the sigillata, and the funerary basilica, an appendix lists the principal Spanish sites where Roman remains have been found in the last three decades, with the essential bibliogra- phy. PREHISTORIC NECROPOLIS OF MOLk (TARRA- GONA).-In Acta arqueologica hispanica (Ministerio de Educacion Nacional, Comisaria General de Ex- cavaciones Arqueologicas), i, Madrid, 1948, 73 pp.,</page><page sequence="17">398 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY 18 figs., xxI pls., Salvador Vilaseca describes the contents of 172 biconical cinerary urns, some with corded geometric decoration on the neck. Bronze bracelets, beautifully engraved, ear-rings, rings, fibulae, needles, and arrow-heads are very numer- ous. Some iron objects, a ring, two clasp knives, and three straight knives, are the oldest of this kind yet discovered in Catalonia. The urn field dates to the VIII-VII centuries B.c. (G. M.) EXCAVATIONS AT ASTA REGIA (MESAS DE ASTA, JEREz).-In Acta arquelogica hispanica, iii, Madrid, 1945, 67 pp., 8 figs., xxvii pls., Manuel Esteve Guerrero discusses the presence in this reign of a population of Ibero-Saharan culture at the beginning of the Mediterranean Bronze Age, with strong cen- tral Mediterranean elements. The pottery, coarse, polished, painted, and reticulated, bone and shell utensils, and metal implements, are typical. Be- tween the Bronze and the Arabic levels there was found varied archaeological material, including Greek pottery, terra sigillata, and Republican and Imperial Roman coins. (G. M.) EXCAVATIONS AT ALBACETE.-In Informes y Memorias, (Ministerio de Educacion Nacional, Comisaria General de Excavaciones Arqueologicas), no. 3, Madrid, 1944, 28 pp., 3 figs., xxxv pls., Joaquin Sanchez Jimenez gives notice of the initial excavation at Albacete, where 200 sq. m. yielded 108 burials: 4, inhumation; 50, cremation "in situ"; and 54, incineration. Burial furniture is very poor. Some of the pottery has parallels for shape and decoration in the impasto italico and the Italo-geo- metric of Southern Etruria. (G. M.) Los BAIALES DE SADABA.-In Informes y Memorias, no. 4, Madrid, 1944, 28 pp., xxI pls., Jose Galiay Sarafiana describes extensive architec- tural remains of a Roman aqueduct and thermae at Los Bafiales de Sadaba (Saragossa). (G. M.) MONTE BERNORIO.-In Informes y Memorias, no. 5, Madrid, 1944, 51 pp., 16 figs., xI pls., Julian San Valero Aparisi illustrates some remains of Roman fortifications at Monte Bernorio (Palencia). (G. M.) PREHISTORIC CAVE.-In Informes y Memorias, no. 6, Madrid, 1944, 35 pp., 2 figs., ix pls., Juan Uria Riu describes a prehistoric cave at "El Cuetu" Lledias (Asturias). The cave, 42.25 m. long, con- tains 42 paintings of animals averaging 18-30 cm. in length. The largest figure is an 82 cm. goat. There are portrayed 12 bison, 7 deer, 4 does, 4 horses, 18 goats, a horse head, and an animal which might be a badger. The colors, excellently preserved, con- sist of black, brownish-yellow, sepia, and dark green. (G. M.) CASTRO DE YECLA.-In Informes y Memorias, no. 7, Madrid, 1945, 32 pp., 13 figs., xxxii pls., Saturio Gonzales Salas describes the excavation at Castro de Yecla, Santo Domingo de Silos (Burgos), which yielded pottery of the Second Iron Age. Especially interesting are some Celtiberic vases and local Visigoth chattels little known up to now. (G. M.) PLATA DE DRmEVES.-In Informes y Memorias, no. 9, Madrid, 1945, 91 pp., 14 figs., xvI pls., Julian San Valero Aparisi gives notice of an excavation at Plata de Drieves (Guadalajara) which yielded fragments of fibulae, rings, ear-rings, bracelets, etc., belonging typologically to the Second Peninsular Iron Age. (G. M.) INSCRIPTIONS.-R. Thouvenot, in REA, xlii (1940), pp. 529-531, publishes three Latin inscrip- tions from Lusitania, two epitaphs from Coria and the establishment of an Aqua Augusta ex testimento from Capara. FRANCE GENERAL.--In REA, xliv (1942), pp. 100-108, A. Grenier presents an outline of the recent legisla- tion concerning archaeological excavations in France. GENERAL.-In REA, xlii (1940), pp. 645-652, Georges Matherat examines various technical terms used by Hirtius (Caes. BG, viii, 9, 3) in connection with the actual fortifications at Bois-des-C6tes. The twelve-foot vallum was measured from the bottom of the ditch to the top of the palisade. The palisade is made of six-foot stakes, two feet of which are seated in the agger. The agger itself takes various forms; it is usually about five feet high and is made of crushed stone and other outside material, not the dirt removed from the fossa. The fossa was generally three feet in depth and six in width, but its dirt was heaped before it, giving an added 18 inches of effective depth. The ditches all had wooden pegs or stakes of some sort. The fossam duplicem pedum quinum denum was found to con- sist of two parallel ditches, together taking up fifteen feet. The fossa lateribus derectis is not a ditch with vertical sides, but one of triangular cross- section with straight, slanting sides. Such fossae were equipped with small metal-tipped pegs and were used in conjunction with the agger against infantry attacks. The fossa curvis lateribus has curv- ing sides, producing a flower-shaped cross-section.</page><page sequence="18">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIGEST 899 This was fitted with large stakes and was used alone against enemy cavalry. TOPOGRAPHY.-In REA, xliv (1942), pp. 234- 245, Emile Th6venot discusses the stations of the Roman road between Briangon and Grenoble. Fol- lowing Ferrand, he adds Fines to the table of Peutin- ger, and he identifies this as Lavorant; Fines is a translation of Equoranda which denotes a limit or border. This locating of Fines agrees with the presence of a natural boundary (the Romanche River) and permits the writer to reaffirm Ferrand's placing of the other stations. Fines, he concludes, marked the western limit of the Ucenni, now Oisans, the eastern border of this people being at Lautaret, a name derived from "altaretum," the re- ligious monument placed at borders and where roads crossed important hills. ROMAN ROAD FROM LUTETIA TO ROTOMAGUS. -In BCTH, June 1944, pp. v-xvii, J. Toutain traces this Norman road from Paris to Saint-Clair-sur- Epte. Crossing the Oise near Pontoise (ancient Briva Isarae) where a paved ford is recorded, the road proceeded in a straight line to Magny-en- Vexin. This section of the road is still called "Chauss6e de Jules CGsar," and remains of the ori- ginal road are recorded. PREHISTORY.-In BCTH, June 1941, pp. vii-xi, Armand Calliat describes a Gallic station at Marloux dating from La Thne III, and where two Roman roads later crossed, and (ibid., pp. xi-xiv) a small cremation cemetery of the Gallo-Roman Period at the neighboring Chalon-sur-Sa6ne. VAISON-LA-ROMAINE.-In REA, xlii (1940), pp. 660-670, F. Sautel describes with a plan the excavation between 1936 and 1938 of an elaborate Gallo-Roman house at Vaison-la-Romaine called the "House of the Silver Bust," after the bust found there in 1924. Among the finds were altars, frag- ments of statues, terracotta, and various household implements. The form of the silver bust places the construction of the building in the first century or early second century, this date being confirmed by the architectural details and altars. It seems to have been destroyed in the second half of the second century, possibly by the invasions in 258. The house was rebuilt with alterations but abandoned in subse- quent centuries when the people of Vaison sought refuge in fortified areas outside the city. ARCHITECTURE.-In the REA, xlii (1940), pp. 580-592, A. Bon discusses the fountain area at Nimes, with a plea for further excavation. AvTU N.-In REA, xlii (1940), pp. 699-706, Pierre Wuilleumier describes the excavations at the Roman theater at Autun. The largest theater in Gaul, it has a diameter of 148 meters. The cavea is turned towards the east and is backed against a hill in the Greek manner. The cavea includes three maeniana including about forty rows altogether, and seated about 14,000. It was served by seven staircases on the outside and eight within. An in- teresting feature is the separation of the first maenianum from the orchestra, making it possible to stage gladiatorial combats in the orchestra with- out danger to the spectators. The theater was well adapted for dramatic productions also. The orches- tra is 50 meters in diameter, but its red marble pavement, indicated by nineteenth century sound- ings, has not been located. A bronze of Vespasian and several fragments of inscriptions including his name help to place its date in the first century, perhaps towards the end. The theater was later restored, perhaps in the second century and cer- tainly again about A.D. 811. EXCAVATIONS AT LYoNs.-In REA, xliii (1941), pp. 56-62, Pierre Wuilleumier discusses the still unsolved problem of the amphitheater in which Christian martyrs were thrown to the beasts in 177. Search for information on this structure on the hill of Fourvibre has led, however, to the discovery of a Roman theater 108.5 m. in diameter. The cavea, divided into two maeniana, is turned toward the east and is built against a hillside. Separated from the cavea by a balteus is the orchestra, 27 m. in diameter and containing four low tiers of portable seats for spectators of senatorial rank. The curtain mechanism and the northern entrance are particu- larly well preserved. The latter shows evidences of having been faced with re-worked marble slabs at first, but was subsequently covered over with stucco. The theater cannot be dated more precisely than the first century or early second, but it shows signs of fire and rebuilding. LOGEION OF THE THEATER AT ALESIA.-In BCTH, Jan. 1941, pp. v-x, J. Toutain discusses the meaning of the term Logeion in the literary and epigraphical sources and in connection with the theater at Alesia. He takes it to be a rectangular speaking platform, of which the foundations still exist there, a rectangular mass stretching north- south. SCULPTURE.-In BCTH, March 1941, pp. iii- vi, J. Toutain describes a small bronze statuette of a Gaul, resting on one knee and with his arms tied behind him. The fineness of the execution as well</page><page sequence="19">400 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY as the kneeling pose leads Toutain to attribute it to a sculptor residing in Italy or the East, or to a Greek sculptor living in southern Gaul. The style, he concludes, is Gallic or Gallo-Roman. PERGAMENE MOTIF ON THE ARCH AT ORANGE. -In BCTH, Nov. 1943, pp. ix-xvi, J. Charbonneaux reopens the question of the connection between the sculpture on the arch at Orange and Pergamene prototypes. He concludes by denying the direct reflection of a Hellenistic composition at Orange; the forms used by Roman artists were rather a series of types borrowed from various Greek models and adaptable, through modification in detail, to any ends. TERRACOTTAS OF THE PRE-ROMAN PERIOD.- In the REA, xlii (1940), pp. 553-559, A. Audollent examines a number of andirons in the form of rams' heads from the region of Auvergne, of which two bear graffiti, presumably the signatures of the manufacturer. GRAUFESENQUE POTTERY.-In the REA, xlii (1940), pp. 613-621, R.-E. Doranlo comments on the Collection Plique, made late in the nineteenth century, of sherds from the ancient Lusianum, and now largely scattered. From that part which found its way to the Mus6e de Saint-Germain, the author prepares a list of potters' names, of which about a quarter are known in the Graufesenque. POTTERY KILN AT ESTOUBLON.-In REA, xliv (1942), pp. 87-99, Jean Marion discusses a Gallo- Roman pottery kiln which he discovered in 1935 at Estoublon (ancient Stabulum) in the Basses- Alpes. The furnace is similar to that found by Charles Fabre at Lezoux; its original vaulting has fallen in, but the various sections are easily recog- nizable. The author notes that a local unit of meas- urement of the foot is employed, the unit being .85 meters rather than the Roman .295. The pottery found in the debris covers a wide range; some may have been carried to the site by streams. Two skeletons were discovered in the excavation; the earlier of these appears to be a Christian burial, and it is concluded that the furnace had fallen into ruins by the Merovingian Period. CROSS GRAFFITI ON A GALLO-BELGIAN URN. -In REA, xlii (1940), pp. 593-599, G. Chenet dis- cusses a globular urn which he discovered in 1920 at Lavoye (Meuse). The urn was located in a special niche at the bottom of a third century cre- mation burial; a knife, an iron hook or key, a coin of Vespasian, and a capsa or box were also found in the burial. The urn, broken by the surrounding stones, is of gray earth and is decorated about the middle with a band of irregularly placed vertical lines. Its interest lies in the seven crosses marked on its surface after the firing, the one on the bottom being of the form of the cross of Lorraine. Citing examples of swastikas, magic alphabets, x's, and "phalli," the author shows that the crosses may be merely protection against evil influences. Although there is no proof of the Christianization of Argonne in the third century, the marks may also be those of a Christian faith. The bishoprics of Reims, Treves, and Soissons may well extend back to the third century. Such symbols as doves or fish would be more conclusive, but simple crosses would be easier for the novice to draw. He suggests that the de- ceased person may have been a Christian who, despite the Christian opposition to cremation, was too early in his conversion to dare to change the prevailing custom. It is even suggested, though with hesitation, that the capsa may have contained some Christian relics. PIERCED BONE CYLINDERS.-In BCTH, Dec. 1944, pp. iii-xii, J. Toutain discusses the use of the pierced bone fragments which have been found in widely scattered localities. Rejecting the hypotheses that they served as images, beads, flutes, or whistles, the author supports the suggestion of Vic- tor Pernet and Matruchot that they were loom weights. NvMISMATICS.-Discussing the enigmatic for- mula PP on the asses struck at Nemausus (Nimes) from 27 B.c. on, with the jugate heads of Augustus and Agrippa, Adrien Blanchet rallies to the support of an earlier interpretation, patroni parentes (REA, xlii [1940], pp. 573-579). ENGLAND ROMAN FORT AT CLAUSENTUM.-This interest- ing site in a bend of the River Itchen has been known from the eighteenth century, and was the object of systematic excavations in the summer of 1937 and 1938 (D. M. Waterman, AJ, xxvii, 3/4 [1947], pp. 151-171). The sumptuous publication, with a wealth of plans and drawings, distinguishes a pre-Wall occupation, consisting of a circular hut with sunken floor, replaced in the middle of the second century by half-timbered building, enlarged about A.D. 200. The town wall was built after this had been destroyed and buried beneath an occupa- tion layer, dated to the late fourth century by Late Period New Forest pottery and a coin of Valens. Features of the wall are a large drain and sump beneath it, and a "Water Gate." Later, another</page><page sequence="20">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIGEST 401 frame building was built on the site, before it was abandoned except for possible occupation in post- Roman times. The finds consisted mainly of pottery of all the expected varieties; the "Samian" sherds are drawn and discussed by T. Davies Pryce. THE LOW COUNTRIES THE ENGINEERING WORKS OF DRUSUS ON THE LOWER RHINE.-Discovery at Herwen of a tufa dike and two inscriptions, one the epitaph of a soldier of the First Legion buried Carvio ad molem, to- gether with the investigations along the Lower Rhine of the engineer Ramaer, enable W. Vollgraff in the REA, xlii (1940), pp. 686-698, to conclude that the object of Drusus was to make the right fork of the river navigable to the sea. CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF A BRONZE AXE.-Writ- ing in the Revue belge d'archeologie et d'histoire de l'art, xvi, 3/4 (1946), pp. 101-108, S. J. De Laet presents the results of a chemical analysis of a bronze axe from Eename by J. Eeckhout. POLAND WOLYN.-In several issues of the two Polish scientific publications, Otchlani Wiekdw and Prze- glad Zachodni, Professor J6zef Kostrzewski, the head of the faculty of Prehistory of Poznan Uni- versity, made the 1946 reports of recent investiga- tions. Research is still in progress on the small Baltic island of Wolyn, across the straights from Stettin, a part of Poland's recovered territories. The University expects to resume work there this summer. Professor Kostrzewski was first called to the island and town of Wolyn by his German col- leagues in 1934, when the driveway of the market- place caved in, disclosing a curious substratum of wooden construction extending beneath the Town Hall and apparently for a considerable distance be- yond. The investigations of the last two years have confirmed his belief that these old timbers covered the mediaeval city of Wolyn, known to the Ger- mans as the legendary Vineta. From the tenth to the twelfth century, the town of Wolyn was the largest port on the Baltic and probably the greatest of all Slavonic settle- ments. It was so renowned as a center of trade and commerce that chroniclers spoke of it as "The Troy of the North." It was situated at the confluence of three rivers, the Oder, the Dziwna, and the Peena. Above the site of the buried city rises a hill called Silver Mountain because of the coins and silver treasure frequently found there, dating from the eleventh and twelfth centuries. The excavators first identified the remains of a wooden fortress on Silver Mountain with the Viking stronghold from which the Norwegian Trygweson made the historic raids on England and Scotland; but this is now questioned by Labude and other historians. The discovery closes a heated discussion that has been going on for nearly a century between Eu- ropean historians as to the exact location of this stronghold and port, once known from the Black Sea to the Pacific. Some time before World War II the German Professor Kunkel announced his opinion that the ruins lying three layers beneath the little island town-for the site of the city had been twice built upon-was none other than the lost Vineta or Wolyn, its original Slavonic name; the first, how- ever, to reach this conclusion were Professors Hof- meister and Widajewicz. The ruins of the city, several times destroyed by fire and rebuilt, were discovered under the wooden conduits of an aqueduct of the end of the twelfth and the beginning of the thirteenth century, and under the remnants of small houses with stone fireplaces in wooden frames set in narrow streets. Excavations on Silver Mountain, conducted by Ger- man scholars, revealed remains similar to those of other Slavonic strongholds which had been un- covered. There were Viking influences and certain links with Scandinavian culture on both hill and city levels, but the ceramics and other artifacts which indicate the way of life were distinctly Slavonic. Sometimes pieces of old boats had been used for the walls of houses, as the Cassubian fishermen on the Hel peninsula use them today; and between the houses there were all sorts of objects betraying the habits and interests of the inhabitants. The stronghold had been thrice destroyed and each time built higher and stronger. It had been deserted earlier than the town. Signs of iron forges are in evidence, as well as factories for ivory dice and for stone weights used on fishing nets; and two cemeteries have been found. Parts of the old warehouses, mentioned by an Arabian traveller of the tenth century as belonging to the "opulentissima urbs sclavorum," have been found. In what had been a storage chamber for amber, eight meters long, were many finished ornaments and toys lying ready for shipment for 800 years. Amber was the chief export of the region. Fragments of woven textiles were found, spinnning wheels, beautiful drinking cups of horn, elaborately carved knife handles and other household equip- ment, toilet articles and personal adornments, as well as much unfinished work in raw materials testifying to the crafts and skills, such as cobblers' bodkins, goldsmiths' crucibles, and enamelers' tools. There were sea shells from the Red Sea and the</page><page sequence="21">402 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY Pacific, indicating commercial ties with distant peoples. Bones of wild boar, deer, and domestic animals were scattered about. All the man-made articles corresponded in character and facture with those found in 1938 by Professor Kostrzewski and his associates in the excavations at Gniezno, the ancient capital of Poland, at Poznan, and at Opole in Silesia. They were in a remarkable state of preservation, partly due to the dampness of the earth. For two hundred years Wolyn was a capital of Polish possessions, though it was said to have been one of several Slavonic cities founded by a sister of Julius Caesar, wife of a legendary slavic chief- tain. Wolyn and its fortress were overcome and destroyed in the latter part of the twelfth century by Saxons and Danes. The inhabitants fled to other Baltic towns. In a recent summary, Professor Kostrzewski declares that the principal Wolyn disclosures, the port, stronghold, town and cemeteries, serve to support his thesis, based upon other excavations during the last decade, that there existed in the Slavonic world, apart from the strongholds, cities established many centuries before the appearance of the "Magdeburg Law." Moreover he states that the Wolyn excavations and those conducted on prewar Polish territory yield evidence of a very ancient Lusatian culture, which should be regarded as one with the pre-Slavonic and Slavonic cultures, and which derives without a break in continuity from the culture of the Third Bronze Period.

RUSSIA SARMATIAN GOLD COLLECTED BY PETER THE GREAT.-In GBA, vi series, xxxi (Jan.-Feb., 1947), pp. 5-14, Alfred Salmony writes on Peter's collec- tion, the nucleus of the Hermitage, as it came to be called, which was begun in 1715. The sources of the treasure cannot be deduced. Some scholars have held that all the gold work is contemporary, but in the opinion of Salmony there is considerable variation in date. The earliest group is discussed in part II of this article under the heading, "The Early Sarmatian Group with Allover Cloisonn6." Three items belong in this class: a statuette of a falcon grasping a swan or goose, to be connected with Hallstatt work by the stylization of the swan or goose, but with Iranian art, and in particular with the Oxus treasure, by the cloisonn6 decoration of the bird, and to be dated in the fifth or fourth century B.c.; a torque with finials in the form of lion-griffons, also in cloisonn6 like the Oxus treasure, and also belonging to the fifth or fourth century B.C.; and a pair of aigrettes with spread wings, probably ornaments for headdresses, decorated with the same technique less well applied, to be dated between the third and the first centuries B.c.

SOUTH AMERICA GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS.--It is appropri- ate to welcome the new journal of the Ministro de Educaci6n Nacional de Colombia, of the Director del Instituto Etnol6gico y de Arqueologia, and of the Presidente de la Comisi6n Nal. de Folklore, Revista de Folklore (i, Nov. 1947), which promises to contain archaeological as well as more purely ethnological articles. CEMETERY OF SAN AGUSTIN TYPE IN COLOM- BIA.-In Revista de las Indias, n. s., no. 96, 1947, pp. 387-418 (31 illus.) Luis Duque G. presents a preliminary report on his 1946 excavations in a cemetery of San Agustin type at Quinchana (head- waters of the R. Magdalena, Dept. of Huila). The cemetery was found on a flat wooded terrace called the Planada of San Francisco, on the left bank of the Magdalena; the part excavated was on a low mound ("Meseta A") apparently artificial. 29 burials were dug and 8 more, previously looted, were examined. The tombs are of several types, the commonest being a rectangular cist lined and covered with stone slabs; four burials in earth pits are marked on the plan. The bodies show con- siderable variety in position: extended, flexed, and seated flexed burials were all found, as well as one secondary urn burial. The only two tombs shown in detail in the plan have the head to the north. Grave goods were rare and when they occurred were sometime beside the body and some- times in a special niche in the cist. In spite of poor preservation conditions, bone remains were found in 18 of the tombs; four skeletons were sufficiently well preserved to furnish length measurements and two skulls were recovered. Two new statues of San Agustin type were found in the cemetery, one being an exceptionally fine figure of a crouching woman in the midst of a group of children's tombs, apparently deliberately buried. Two gold nose pendants were found and abundant pottery of San Agustin type. A full report of this excavation is in preparation. On p. 395 Duque summarizes briefly his 1943-44 excavations of tombs at San Agustin itself, work of which no report has yet appeared. (J. H. R.) CAVE SrrITES IN SANTANDER.-In Boletin de Arqueologia, ii, 1 (1946), pp. 33-41 (3 plates) Eliecer Silva C. describes the exploration of 88</page><page sequence="22">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIGEST 403 limestone caves, together with house sites and middens, near La Belleza, Dept. of Santander, in 1943-44. Great quantities of crude anthropomorphic figurines were found in the caves, some executed in a soapy clay ("soft stone") of varying colors and some in the spongy root of a local palm tree. Frag- ments of crude painted pottery and bone were mixed with the figurines in shallow deposits on the cave floor. In one cave, 6 km. from La Belleza, 52 shallow tombs were dug. The bodies were flexed, wrapped in textiles and palm leaves, and buried on back or side. Many had bundles of ashes wrapped in leaves at the foot, and some had used cooking pots near the head. In general, the cemetery gave an impression of great poverty. A fuller report on the collections is promised. (J. H. R.) THE SCULPTURE FROM LA BELLENZA is de- scribed by Josep de Recasens in Revista del Instituto ethnol6gico nacional, ii, 1 (1945; actually published in 1947), pp. 117-152 (13 plates). A total of 974 "soft stone" sculptures were recovered, of which 342 were in good enough condition to be studied. The sculptures are all small, running from 5 to 19 cm. in height. All but two of the figures are human, the other two representing crouching animals. The workmanship is very crude; most of the figures are little more than lumps which have had a background gouged out leaving arms, legs and face in low relief. Recasens attempts to establish a typological chronology, but the effort is very forced and unconvincing. La Belleza is on the edge of the Chibcha territory and the closest parallels of its figurines are with finds in the Lake of Fuquene (see Gregorio Hernandez de Alba in American Antiquity, xi, 2 [1945], pp. 80-83). Seven figures carved in spongy root were found in a single cave; they are larger than the "stone" ones (30 to 36 cm. high) but identical in style. (J. H. R.) SCHOTTELIUS AND THE MESA DE LOS SANTOS.- The Boletin de Arqueologia, iii, 1 (1946), pp. 201- 225 (5 plates) reprints two important articles by the late J. W. Schottelius, originally published in Educaci6n (Bogota) in 1'941. The first is a brief summary of the state of Colombian archaeology with an interesting map showing the amount of work done in various areas up to 1941. It is marred by preoccupation with speculations over origins and a tendency to confuse cultural diffusion with migration. The second article is a preliminary re- port on Schottelius' investigations of two dry burial caves at La Mesa de los Santos (Dept. of Santander), one of the most important sites ever found in Colombia because of its exceptional preservation conditions and the quality of the grave-goods it contains. The first include: dried bodies of the dead, pottery, textiles, wooden weaving tools and sword clubs, two baskets, part of a pan-pipe and a few gold ornaments. One of the textiles, a large painted mantle with very sophisticated geometric design, is illustrated in the report. Los Santos is in the territory occupied in historic times by the Guan6, a tribe related to the Chibcha. This site was discovered by pot-hunters in 1939 and was very badly sacked. Schottelius made only one small excavation but collected a lot of descriptive data and bought and picked up an extensive collection now in the Museum in Bogota. He believed he had found two cultural periods in his cut. Further exploration of this site is urgent. (J. H. R.) FAR EAST PHILIPPINE ARCHAEOLOGY.-Writing in the Smithsonian Report for 1946, Publication 3883, pp. 345-360, Olov R. T. Janse deplores the lack of any Archaeological Service in the islands, and recommends that one be set up by the new govern- ment. With the support of the late President Quezon, the writer was engaged before the war in an archaeological survey, which yielded sub- stantial returns. The Stone Age is now known through a large number of artifacts, and the author has excavated a large cemetery at Calatagan, the graves of which regularly included Ming pottery, and which he would date to the fifteenth century, somewhat earlier than the cemeteries at Pulong Bacao and Kay Tomas. Among the major un- solved problems raised by the author is the source of the knowledge of metals in the islands, whether from China or elsewhere. JAPAN.-A report on archaeological progress in Japan from 15 August 1945 to the date of writ- ing is given by the Rev. Gerard Groot, S.V.D. (President, Archaeological Institute of Ichikawa- Konodai, Japan) in the American Archaeologist, i, no. 1, part 1 (Jan.-March 1948), pp. 165-171. The major recent publications are listed and the activi- ties of the two Institutes, that of the writer, founded in September 1946, and of the older Institute of Kashiwabara. The latter explored a large Stone Age site of the Jomon Period near Kinki, and a number of burials in the Nara prefecture, the most interesting being of the Iron Period, with the characteristic Sueki pottery. The author has ex- cavated a number of early settlements, going back to about 1000 B.c., characterized by pointed- bottomed pots decorated by incisions made with a thin stick. At Hanawadai in the prefecture of</page><page sequence="23">404 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY Ibaragi a shell-mound of the Tumuli Period yielded a pit dwelling with bone implements and a primi- tive female clay image. The stone circles of Oyu, in Akita prefecture, were further explored. Some of these are up to fifty meters in diameter, with the huge stones of which they are composed facing to the cardinal points of the compass. It is possible that these circles are as late as the seventh Christian century. CHINA: PREHISTORIC KANSU.-In the Hua Pei Jih Pao ("North China Daily News") of November 14, 1947, Dr. P'ei Wen-chung gave an account of an archaeological tour in Kansu, undertaken under the Chinese Central Geological Survey from June to November 1947. His aim was to take up the work there begun by J. G. Andersson twenty years ago. The areas visited and preliminarily surveyed to locate sites were the following: (1) Upper Wei River from T'ien-shui to Lung-hsi: West Han River region, particularly the upper course of the Chia- ling chiang; (3) the T'ao-ho region; and (4) the Ta-hsia River region. Owing to lack of time and means, many important places could not be visited. However, more than ninety prehistoric sites were discovered, including ten whose speedy excavation Dr. P'ei urges. The following is a summary of P'ei's observa- tions listed in geographical order. However, as he stresses, definite results will depend on further, large-scale excavations. The Upper Wei River, which runs partly through Kansu, cuts through a mountainous region not favoured by nature for habitation. In the course of the millennia, however, waters have created terraces where people could settle. The present- day flood-plain has been occupied from the Ch'in and Han dynasties onwards. Two higher terraces, 20-30 feet and 30-40 feet higher up, show remains of prehistoric dwellings.' Everywhere along the Wei River and its tributaries, sites were found, yielding stone tools, bone implements, and ceramics. Three cultural stages can be recognized in these remains, for which no names have yet been pro- posed: Earliest Stage: Flourishing time of finely ex- ecuted painted wares, corresponding to Andersson's Yang-shao. Second Stage: More crudely made ceramics. Painted pottery becoming rarer in actual use. Third Stage: Painted wares very scarce. The reason for the deterioration of the Painted Pottery is, in Dr. P'ei's opinion, contact with a Primitive Chinese Culture (about which we have no exact knowledge as yet), represented by three- legged clay vessels such as the Ting and the Li. Conditions found in the Han River valley were similar to those of the Wei valley, although there is a certain distinction in the fashioning of vessels, the mouth-rims of which are very broad. The Han River region indicates a southward spread of the Painted Pottery Culture within Kansu's confines, beyond which our knowledge does not now extend. The T'ao River region, connected with the Upper Wei through the source area of the latter, shows the Painted Pottery Culture no less well developed. Still, it is not definitely known whether it came originally from the West or from the.East. The First Stage is best represented in the Pan-shan cemeteries and in the dwelling-places of Machia-yao and Ssu-wa-shan. The wares of that time display an amazingly fine finish. Here, too, deterioration began, though more slowly than in the Wei Valley. This stage corre- sponds to Andersson's Ma-ch'ang Period. It is less discernible in the T'ao-ho region than in the Ta- hsia-ho and Huang-ho (Huang-shui, not the Yellow River) regions. The people of that stage still used mostly painted wares, and they are still of excellent craftsmanship. Dr. P'ei's explanation of the com- parative slowness of decline is that owing to their geographical situation the T'ao-ho and Ta-hsia-ho valleys were less exposed to the influence of the Primitive Chinese Culture. During the subsequent period, that is, the Hsin-tien Stage, the T'ao River region was the scene of a vivid development that left no traces in other localities. Painted wares still widely occur, but they show a recrudescence probably resulting from a shift toward crafts other than pottery-mak- ing, e.g., metal work. The Hsin-tien culture like- wise underwent influences from the side of the Primitive Chinese Culture. There are many Chinese motifs found in the ornamentation of those wares. Andersson's Ch'i-chia Stage is also found in the T'ao River region, with only a little painted pottery. 'Contributor's Comment. Nothing is said as to probably existing differences of artifacts found on the higher terraces and the highest terraces of the Wei River. Such differences might be-with the conditions of the classic Somme terraces in mind-expected to exist; and in fact it was ob- served earlier somewhere in Kansu that, according to C. W. Bishop, on the higher and therefore older river-terraces occur Neolithic remains with- out painted pottery, while the latter appears on the lower and younger terraces. Cf. C. W. Bishop, "The Neolithic Age in Northern China," Antiquity, Dec. 1933, p. 403.</page><page sequence="24">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIGEST 405 Contrary to Andersson's view, many were convinced that Ch'i-chia rather is of later date than the other stages. However, there occur a great many chipped stone tools but no polished ones among the artifacts of Ch'i-chia localities, bespeaking earliness. Dr. P'ei thinks that Ch'i-chia reveals a different cultural facies, the age of which agrees on the whole with that of the Painted Pottery Cultures (not especially Yang-shao), while its distribution is not the same. Ch'i-chia was under the influence of the Micro- lithic culture to the north of the Great Wall, as is shown by the occurrence of microliths and Kamm- Keramik. If the truth be told, the investigations carried out by Dr. P'ei and his companion, Prof. Mi T'ai- heng, resulted in bringing to light new problems rather than in solving problems. The more out- standing of these problems which cannot be solved without further work are the following: Distribution and Evolution of the Painted Pottery Culture. Cultures identical with those reach- ing an apogee in the Wei and T'ao valleys existed farther east in Honan and Shansi, in the south as far as the West Han River, and in the west as far as the T'ao and Ta-hsia rivers. Not taking into account similar or heterogeneous cultures, nothing more is known regarding distribution. Wider areas will have to be surveyed. What has become appar- ent at present is the influence by a Primitive Chinese Culture on the Painted Pottery Culture in the Upper Wei Valley, causing the disintegration of the latter. This influence was felt less in the T'ao River region, where the painted pottery survived longer, and where the Ma-ch'ang and Hsin-tien stages came into being. Future research must be devoted to the painted ceramics of China proper, and to what has been discovered in Central Asia, European Russia, and Eastern Europe. Only then can we arrive at a definite conclusion with regard to antecedence of East or West. Origin of the Chinese Culture. The Painted Pottery Culture and the Lung-shan Culture (= Black Pottery Culture) met in Northern Honan, where they mixed to create the primeval Chinese culture. From this primeval culture, the Yin culture (Hsiao-t'un culture) grew, which, of course, ex- hibits new accomplishments such as its character- istic bronze vessels, about whose origins we still know nothing. During the Chou and Han dynasties which followed the Yin culture, specific Chinese features developed fully. It is only under the Han Dynasty that Chinese culture replaced all the more ancient cultures in Kansu. Still obscure, however, is the origin of the above-mentioned Primitive Chinese Culture. Only its influence can be per- ceived in certain wares connected with painted pottery of the 2nd and 3rd stages. The task remains to discover that Primitive Culture itself. Culture of the Chou People. According to our historical traditions, what is called "Chou" rose in the West, developed at the Lower Wei River, and destroyed the Yin. We generally think that the culture of the Chous was merely inherited from the Yin culture, ignoring what the genuine culture of the Chou people (not the dynasty) was like. Since the Chous migrated toward the lower Wei River from the West, it may be assumed that they were originally settled along the Upper Wei. What we now know is that the utter decline of the Painted Pottery occurred around the beginning of the Chou Dynasty. Thus the conclusion is possible that the third stage of the Painted Pottery Culture may represent the culture of the Chou people. This can be definitely established only by future re- search. "Plaster Floor Dwellings." In many localities in Kansu, there were discovered layers of plaster, thinly spread over a layer of mud or clay and rubbed smooth. After digging, it became clear that they were the floors of ancient dwellings. The plan is square, measuring 3 x 3 feet2 and laid out exactly facing the four directions. In the center, there is a round hole without plaster but ashes only: the fireplace. The lower parts of the walls are also covered with plaster. As to the upper part of these houses, we have not the faintest idea as yet. Many of the dwellings, often well preserved, are waiting for excavation. Human bones, bone implements, and pottery were found in them, suggesting that these living quarters belonged to the third stage, the time of sharpest decline. At any rate, they underlie the stratum containing Han period arti- facts. The true age of these "plaster dwellings," however, has still to be ascertained, as well as their relation to the cultures along the Lower Wei River. Concerning the Stages proposed by Andersson. As was said above, Dr. P'ei inclines to regard Andersson's Ch'i-chia Stage as a cultural facies apart, which he terms the Ch'i-chia Culture. It spread over the Ta-hsia region, whence it reached the T'ao-ho region. Its real age is still uncertain; it is not even clear whether it ranks before or after the Painted Pottery Culture. Andersson's so-called Ssu-wa Stage was en- 2 Contributor's Comment. The measurement given for the "Plaster Floor Dwellings" should in all probability read 30 x 30 feet instead of 3 x 3 feet.</page><page sequence="25">406 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY countered only in tombs and never in dwelling places during the explorations of 1947. It remains doubtful whether it is linked with the Painted Pottery Culture or the Ch'i-chia Culture. The explorers cannot tell at present whether there was any connection between Ssu-wa and the Plaster Floor Dwellings. Geographical Properties of the T'ao-ho Region. It is a known fact that the T'ao River area was inhabited by Chinese, Mohammedans,3 and Tibet- ans (Han, Hui, Tsang). From Han times onwards, these three groups struggled there with one another with changing luck. It is probable that it was similar in prehistoric times: the three cultures- Painted Pottery Culture, Chinese Primitive Culture, Ch'i-chia Culture-competed with each other. In other words, one may speak of three peoples with different cultures who were "see-sawing" there. The reason why they did is given in the particular geographical aspect of that region. The home of the Chinese people's great development is the wide eastern plains and the seashore. In the west, we find a multitude of peoples in Hsinkiang, Cen- tral Asia, Tibet, and Tsinghai. Communications between East and West led inevitably through the Wei Basin. From the east, the Han people pressed through the Wei Valley to the T'ao River to become involved with Tibetans, Mongols, and others. The Han people in turn were exposed to incursions by them, along the same road. Culture, too, spread along that road. With this condition in mind, we shall be able to solve many problems connected with the history of that region, and we shall have to depart from it when proceeding to explore Hsinkiang, Tsinghai (Kukunor), and Tibet. (Max Loehr). 3 Contributor's Comment. "Mohammedans" is the translation of Chinese "Hui," conveniently used to designate Central Asian peoples, and should therefore not be counted as an anachronism.</page></plain_text>
