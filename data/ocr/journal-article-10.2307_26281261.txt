<plain_text><page sequence="1">BECKETT'S VERBAL SLAPSTICK rrfr Frederik N. Smith HUMOR IN BECKETT'S NOVELS (his plays are another matter) is not so much situational as it is linguistic.1 Indeed the situations in his novels are simplistic in the extreme. A servant attempts to meet his reclusive employer. A dying man makes an inventory of his few remaining posses sions and memories. A man with a sack crawls through the mud toward another man with a sack who is crawling toward him. But such situations in Beckett are typically overshadowed—as they are in Joyce—by the lexical drama occurring simultaneously on the same page. Verbal interplay is the source of a great deal of humor in Beckett's fiction. Of course, it should surprise no one that it is the source of many of Beckett's more serious meanings as well. Beckett's affinity for the slapstick comedy of the silent film is a critical cliché. Keaton. Chaplin. But let me propose—the analogy is at least a seductive one—that Beckett's humor has more in common with the prat falls of silent film than simply the exchange of bowlers in Waiting for Godot. Beckett writes a kind of verbal slapstick. His syntax typically tries to con tain words that resist violently the rational attempt to bring them together 'Thus Beckett is effectively discussed within the context of Fred Miller Robinson's The Comedy of Language: Studies in Modern Comic Literature (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1980). Robin son's notion of a peculiarly modern "metaphysical comedy" is assumed in everything I have to say here.

Of course the notion that incongruity is funny is not new. Chaplin himself mentions it. Freud and Bergson analyze it. Cervantes and Swift and Lewis Carroll do it. But that Beckett's peculiar brand of incongruity is a sort of verbal slapstick is perhaps a paradox worth pursuing. "As in a dream," wrote Richard Boston some years back in the Times Literary Supplement—that's the same TLS Molloy found impermeable to farts— "As in a dream, the world of silent comedy is one in which the normal laws of the universe have been suspended. Inanimate objects take on a life of their own: cars, garden rakes, ladders, wardrobes, folding beds, boots, pianos, planks of wood, hose-pipes, brick walls, and of course custard pies exist only to bring about man's downfall. . . . Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world."3 Much the same thing occurs in Beckett's fiction, where rocking chairs, bicycles, crutches, hats, pencils, windows, doors, pots, and sacks seem to take on a life of their own. But in this fiction words themselves become objects to grope for, to fondle, to collect, to attempt to possess—and yet always to succumb to. The normal laws of lexical and tonal consistency have been suspended. Words take on a life of their own and seem to exist only to bring about the downfall of the speaker's or writer's self-confident syntax. The anarchy of objects in silent film becomes the "unbridled gibberish" (Malone's term) or "wordy gurdy" (the Unnamable's term) of Beckett's relentless verbal comedy that his personae quite understandably seek to make silent.4 Like the dapper gentleman who slips on a banana peel, Beckett's sentences repeatedly go splat\ A major wellspring of comedy in Beckett's fiction—and I shall restrict myself to his novels in English—is his keen sensitivity to the peculiar "feel" of individual words. Much of Joyce's humor depends on his fascination with etymology. Much of Beckett's depends on his awareness of what I call "lexical field"—a word's complex of related words, level of usage, social register, age, and tone.5 He seems little concerned for stylistic and narrative consistency and far more interested in the bold shifting of lexical 2Here I echo Hugh Kenner's statement in "Shades of Syntax," in Samuel Beckett: A Collection oj Criticism, ed. Ruby Cohn (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1975), p. 28: "The official business of the Beckett sentence is to affirm a tidy control it cannot quite achieve." I should add that my essay is in no way intended to qualify Kenner's emphasis on the importance of syntax in Beckett. I want only to comple ment this emphasis. 3"The Rise and Fall of the Custard Pie," in the Times Literary Supplement, 18 June 1971, p. 713. *Malone Dies, in Three Novels by Samuel Beckett (New York: Grove Press, 1958), p. 207; The Un namable, in Three Novels by Samuel Beckett, p. 399. Further references to The Unnamable will be made paren thetically in the text as TU. 5I have borrowed the term from Stephen Ullmann, Language and Style (New York: Barnes &amp; Noble, 1964), p. 12: "A lexical field is a closely organized sector of the vocabulary, whose elements fit together and delimit each other like pieces in a mosaic. In each field some sphere of experience is analyzed, divided up and classified in a unique way." Winifred Nowottny, in The Language Poets Use (London: The Athlone Press, 1962), p. 39, seems to mean much the same thing by her term "linguistic field." 44 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="3">field in order to demonstrate the potential incongruities inherent within this various vocabulary we have conveniently labeled "English." One of Beckett's typical stylistic techniques is to establish an immediate lexical context—and set of expectations in his reader—and then to insert within it a few words that do not jibe in meaning or tone with their lexical environment. These words, though in the minority, shockingly and humorously alter the significance of their context. Beckett's comic style, with remarkable consistency, can be traced to this device of shifting lexical field; it is his special application of Bergson's rule: "A comic effect is always obtainable by transposing the natural expression of an idea into another key."6 Such sudden transpositions in key are common in Chaplin. Thus in The Tramp Charlie is forced to dine on grass but must first polish his fingernails. And he heroically rescues the farmer's daughter from a band of robbers but is shown to be inept at his chores on the farm. We laugh at Chaplin one moment and pity him the next and then laugh at him again. In reading Beckett we are asked to be equally as flexible. An example. Although there are isolated instances of such scrambled styles and voices in the stories in More Pricks than Kicks, Beckett's characteristic verbal slapstick begins first to appear in Murphy. "Love requited," said Neary, "is a short circuit," a ball that gave rise to a sparkling rally. "The love that lifts up its eyes," said Neary, "being in torments; that craves for the tip of her little finger, dipped in lacquer, to cool its tongue—is foreign to you, Murphy, I take it." "Greek," said Murphy. "Or put it another way," said Neary; "the single, brilliant, organised, compact blotch in the tumult of heterogeneous stimulation." "Blotch is the word," said Murphy. "Just so," said Neary.7 Notice that the passage is itself about language. Neary is attempting to define "love requited," and he tries out three very different kinds of expressions in attempting to do so. He first uses an electrical metaphor ("short circuit"), then abandons this in favor of a more lyrical style ("being in torments, that craves for the tip of her little finger"), and turns at last to an academic description of the same thing ("the tumult of heterogeneous stimulation"). But all the while this feeling as well as Neary's array of definitions escapes Murphy, who views them as so much Greek. He plays second banana here. At least he fails to comprehend until Neary, unwittingly, lets drop a single word from a fourth linguistic register—the colloquial "blotch"—at which point Murphy seems to know precisely what he means. Electronics, poetry, and academese are shoved rudely aside in favor of a good old Anglo-Saxonism. "Blotch" Murphy 6Henri Bergson, "Laughter," in Comedy, ed. Wylie Sypher (New York: Doubleday Anchor Books, 1956), p. 140. ''Murphy (New York: Grove Press, 1957), pp. 5-6. VERBAL SLAPSTICK 45</page><page sequence="4">understands. That one word seems to lead to a momentary communica tion between the two men. For Beckett and his attentive reader, however, the moment seems less important than the humor of Neary's cavalier donning and doffing of verbal descriptions—"almost as a woman hats," somebody says in Watt.s In this case we watch as language itself has dif ficulty catching its balance, teeters, and does a pratfall. Much of the humor in Beckett's fiction depends upon such rapid shifts from one sort of diction to another. Writing in a century in which language itself is radically split into the diction of everyday and the jargon of hun dreds of separate disciplines, Beckett utilizes this fractured English for his own purposes. He has opened up his fiction to language in all its many garbs, has precluded no style or jargon, and has exploited the multifariousness of modern English for the sake of humor as well as of serious meaning. As did Joyce. It's not surprising that Beckett's 1929 essay on Joyce's Work in Progress stresses throughout a concept of language based on an opposition between the abstractions of metaphysics and the particulars of poetry. Repeatedly, he praises Joyce's willingness, like Dante's, to open up his writing to a full range of linguistic possibilities. "The language is drunk," Beckett says of Work in Progress.9 But so is his own English. If anything, a little drunker. In Wait Beckett's reader comes across such aloof, Greco-Roman, polysyllabic diction as the following: "irrefragable," "obnubilated," "tardigrade," "dianoetic," "contunded," "equidependency," "subaxil lary," "funambulistic," "pneumogastric," and "anathematisation." OED words. But in the same novel Beckett's reader also stumbles onto earthy, Anglo-Saxon, primarily monosyllabic diction like "turd," "scum," "snug," "puke," "prog," "dung," "bugger," "muck," "suckers," and "pissabed." Words out of Partridge. The style of the novel is a disorienting mix of high and low, proper and vulgar, intellectual and physical. Watt, we are told, is "a very fair linguist" (W, p. 208)—but how can one nar rator be held responsible for two such diverse vocabularies? The bifur cated style of Watt is less a reflection of a singular consciousness than it is a debate between two diametrically opposed vocabularies, each sporadically gaining prominence. But as Lucky says, "Not so fast." In Watt and in Beckett's other fiction there is a third vocabulary that throws the other two into even greater relief. I refer here to the admittedly sparse lyricism of the novel, the brief moments when Beckett seems to be reaching yet further into another lexical field—the romantic diction of nature poetry—rhythmical, pleasant-sounding, but often tinged with melancholy, and often hinting 9Watt (New York: Grove Press, 1959), p. 83. Further references will be made parenthetically in the text as W. 9"Dante . . . Bruno. Vico . . Joyce," in Our Exagmination Round his Fortification for Incamination oj Work in Progress (London: Faber and Faber, 1929), p. 14. 46 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="5">at an anthropomorphic connection between man and his environment. It is language in the key of Gray's Elegy. One of my own favorite examples of this style occurs near the end of Watt: "The flies, of skeleton thinness, excited to new efforts by yet another dawn, left the walls, and the ceiling, and even the floor, and hastened in great numbers to the window. Here, pressed against the impenetrable panes, they would enjoy the light, and warmth, of the long summer's day" (W, pp. 236-237). Of course the charm of this poetry is qualified by "skeleton thinness," "yet another dawn," and the Joycean pun on "impenetrable pane." Yet the poetry is there nonetheless. And, despite its spareness, this lyrical style is impor tant to Beckett in supplying another context for his academic and collo quial styles. Each vocabulary serves as a touchstone for the other two. My point is the extreme subtlety with which Beckett interweaves his learned, colloquial, and poetic dictions into a style poised uneasily be tween high seriousness and bufoonery. All three come together in this passage in which Watt describes the almost imperceptible but quite pro found transformations which have begun to occur upon his arrival at Mr. Knott's house: At the same time my tobacco-pipe, since I was not eating a banana, ceased so completely from the solace to which I was inured, that I took it out of my mouth to make sure it was not a thermometer, or an epileptic's dental wedge. And my breast, on which I could almost feel the feathers stirring, in the charming way breast feathers have, relapsed into the void and bony concavity which my dear tutor used to say reminded him of Crécy. For my spine and sternum have always been concentric, ever since I was a little nipper. It was then in my distress that I had the baseness to call to my aid recent costiveness and want of stomach. ( W, p. 44) Like Watt's world itself, the language of this passage appears to be cut loose from any identifiable moorings. Beckett is playing Lewis Car roll's game: "Why is a raven like a writing-desk?" Although the passage is dominated by real objects and known anatomical parts, and although the vocabulary of the intellect ("inured," "concavity," "concentric," "costiveness") is quantitatively in control here, a few words are out of sync with the rest. The lyricism of "stirring," "charming," and "breast feathers," like the child-slang of "little nipper" and the archaism "want of stomach," tends to disturb the complacency implied in the learned diction. Vocabularies humorously slam into one another. If Watt is as existentially disoriented as he says he is, then the lexical leapfrogging seems decidedly inappropriate to the situation itself. In another sense, however, the fracturing of style in this passage duplicates the dislocation of Watt's world. Form is content, as Beckett is fond of saying. Watt's "personal system" (his term on the previous page) has been existentially distorted by what he has seen and heard in Knott's house; like Watt, the reader of Beckett's novel has his own personal system of narrative expectations disoriented by the comically distorted style of the book he is holding in VERBAL SLAPSTICK 47</page><page sequence="6">his hands. And distortion itself—as we know from the speeded-up chase scenes in silent films or the reversal of ordinary grammatical order in this very novel—can be hilariously funny. In the trilogy the comic shifting of lexical fields is somewhat different. A plainer style predominates. Although it is true that words like "floc cillate," "eudemonistic," "fulgurating," "equinoctial," "hypomaniacal," "prestidigitation," "infundibuliform," "helicoidal," "hippophagist," and "circumvolutionisation" appear in these three novels, Beckett has in writing the trilogy left his OED for the most part on the shelf. Colloquial phraseology abounds. Furthermore, the interplay of vocabularies is here subsumed in the drama of speakers. Words in the trilogy seem to have become now a means of establishing scraps of various antiphonal voices, each vying for predominance. "Unfortunately," says the Unnamable, "it's a question of words, of voices, one must not forget that" (W, p. 384). Of course Beckett won't let us. A good example of this new approach to the comic mixing of vocabularies is the following from Molloy. Like most of Beckett's sparse accounts of sexual intercourse, the romance of the situation is qualified by the words used to describe it. I would have preferred it seems to me an orifice less arid and roomy, that would have given me a higher opinion of love it seems to me. However, Twixt finger and thumb tis heaven in comparison. But love is no doubt above such base contingencies. And not when you are comfortable, but when your frantic member casts about for a rubbing-place, and the unction of a little mucous membrane, and meeting with none does not beat in retreat, but retains its tumefaction, it is then no doubt that true love comes to pass, and wings away, high above the tight fit and the loose. And when you add a little pedicure and massage, having nothing to do with the instant of bliss strictly speaking, then I feel no further doubt is justified, in this connexion.10 The academic-sounding "that would have given me a higher opinion," "no doubt above such base contingencies," and "strictly speaking," plus the scientific terms "orifice," "unction," "mucous membrane," and "tumefaction"—all of this lends the passage a decidedly aloof tone. It is as if the act of love between Molloy and Lousse is being reported by a scientific observer. But the diction of uninvolved observation is contra dicted by a couple of romantic phrases that are, under the circumstances, perhaps equally out of place. The archaic "tis heaven," the euphemistic (even biblical) "true love comes to pass," and that lyrical "instant of bliss"—this phraseology suggests the very human need to fantasize inter course into more than a glandular occurrence, and surely more than the interlocking of two aroused animals. But as usual Beckett won't permit the human mind to ignore the human body. Although Lousse's "orifice" seems a "heaven" to Molloy, it is in fact a mere "rubbing-place" for his "frantic member." And "true love" is demoted—in a fine pun—to 10Molloy, in Three Novels, p. 58, 48 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="7">"this connexion." Beckett's disparate vocabulary serves in this passage to develop a predominantly serious, aloof, even academic voice, which shatters at odd moments into a more romantic or a more earthy someone. The scientific distance won't hold. And the sudden interruptions are downright funny, as when the poetical winging of love descends abruptly to "the tight fit and the loose."11 True romance is as short-lived in Beckett as it is in Chaplin. As he moves through the trilogy, Beckett's interest in words per se is overshadowed by his increased interest in words and phrases as fragments of echoing, debating, barely humanized voices. Thus in The Unnamable we find such a "sentence" as this: And would it not suffice, without any change in the structure of the thing as it now stands, as it always stood, without a mouth being opened at the place which even pain could never line, would it not suffice to, to what, the thread is lost, no matter, here's another, would not a little stir suffice, some tiny subsidence or upheaval, that would start things off, the whole fabric would be infected, the ball would start a-rolling, the disturbance would spread to every part, locomotion itself would soon appear, trips properly so called, business trips, pleasure trips, research expeditions, sabbatical leaves, jaunts and rambles, honeymoons at home and abroad and long sad solitary tramps in the rain, I indicate the main trends, athletics, tossing in bed, physical jerks, locomotor ataxy, death throes, rigor and rigor mortis, emergal of the bony structure, that should suffice. (TU, p. 384) The subject of this passage is motion, and indeed the rush of words and phrases itself ends up like a fast-motion scene from a silent film. The overt speeding up of a sentence can be as funny as the speeding up of a series of visual images. Here the learned words are practically forced off the page, although "subsidence," "locomotor ataxy," and "emergal of the bony structure" stand out from the rest. "Would it not suffice?" asks some professorial voice, falters, then lets slip away the thought it never seems to have really grasped in the first place. Another voice—the voice of the writer himself? —attempts to cover up: "the thread is lost, no matter, here's another, would not a little stir suffice ... ?" Then this minimal "stir" begins to generate a rhythm of its own that builds to a series of loosely connected words and phrases, linked for the most part by the rhythm alone. But the diction and thus the scraps of voices one hears are incongruous to one another. "The whole fabric would be infected" sounds like something from a doom-saying politician. "The ball would start a-rolling" is from a coach's pep-talk. "The disturbance would spread to every part" sounds again like our politician. "Trips properly so-called" is acadamese, and is in keeping with "research expeditions" and "sabbatical leaves." The colloquial "jaunts," "rambles," and "tramps," however, are someone else's words, and "tossing in bed" suggests we are now in the presence of someone who is making fun of the ponderous list-maker who got this "Beckett is punning here on "Lousse." Note also the mock-poetic rhyme of "beat in retreat." VERBAL SLAPSTICK 49</page><page sequence="8">damned thing started in the first place. And if we doubt the irony here, the juxtaposition of the synonymous "physical jerks" and "locomotor ataxy"—from two ridiculously disparate lexical fields—hints at a parodist behind all this who is, once again, looking in a mirror, trying on words like hats. Finally, breathes that parodist with a wink that mocks his own pseudoserious endeavor, "that should suffice!" Indeed it does. We've had all we can take of this "pidgin bullskrit," as the Unnamable calls his own writing {TU, p. 378). But of course Beckett's quick-cutting from one vocabulary to another has served to expose the arbitrariness of any verbal formulation. The scrambled voices of the professor, the politician, and the parodist come at us too fast and two briefly to be comprehended as separate characters. Which is the true voice of the text? Which is Beckett himself? In How It Is, in spite of Beckett's radical experimentations with form, there is a somewhat surprising return to the learned vocabulary of Watt. The OED comes off the shelf again. In How It Is we run across lexical rarities like the following: "subprefecture," "imbrication," "lubricious," "acervation," "exactitudes," "infinitudes," "inexistence," "hypo," "introrse," "malar," "thenar," "bo," "meatus," "procumbency," "capillarity," "agglutinated," "piriform," "sinistra," "untorturable," "unbutcherable," "prepensely," "scissiparous," "buccinators," and "revictuallings." Indeed many of these words are not to be found in the OED, or only in different forms, or are listed as "rare" or "obsolete." Many date from the seventeenth century. Some are coinages. Most demonstrate Beckett's games with prefixes and suffixes. And the fact that a large percentage of these difficult words can be found in the concordances to Ulysses and Finnegans Wake suggests that Beckett has never, really, moved permanently out from the shadow of James Joyce, author of our cen tury's two-volume OED.n In any case, even in How It Is, where he seems more than ever interested in dramatizing the very early stages of the com posing process (as in Genesis, an author attempting to locate a voice and create a book out of all that primeval mud), Beckett finds the learned vocabulary incredibly seductive. But although words from this lexical field are scattered throughout How It Is, they once again are not permitted to go unchallenged. The phrase "bits and scraps" is used numerous times in reference to the author's manner of composition, and the novel is truly made up of bits and scraps from various vocabularies and voices. "My whole life a gibberish garbled six-fold."13 Yet the form of How It Is tends to obscure Beckett's comic style, which is as usual dependent upon the juxtaposition of words from several lexical fields. ,2Words from the above list found (in some form) also in Joyce are the following: "lubricious," "exactitudes," "bo," "meatus," "aggutinated," "sinistro," "prepensely," and "buccinators." x%How It Is (New York: Grove Press, 1964), p. 134. Further references will be made parenthetically in the text as HII. 50 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="9">Here Beckett has compressed his style even more than in his earlier novels. By abandoning almost any semblance of traditional sentence struc ture, he has freed up his style, has made it possible for words and phrases and voices to be laid down next to one another without the rationalized neatness and separateness inherent in conventional syntax and punctuation. question why a leash in this immensity of verdure and emergence little by litde of grey and white spots lambs little by little among their dams what else the bluey bulk closing the scene three miles four miles of a mountain of modest elevation our heads overtop the crest (HII, p. 29) This stanza is dominated by a pastoral prospect described in the language of nature poetry ("verdure," "lambs," "bluey"), and such an impres sion is intensified by the repetition of the childish "little by little," by rhymes ("lambs"-"dams"), and by alliteration ("bluey bulk"). On the other hand, the voice of intellectual analysis opens the stanza ("question why a leash"?) and continually and humorously interrupts the poetry; "immensity," "emergence," and "a mountain of modest elevation" seem to be spoken by someone else, a geologist perhaps. Indeed the phrases "immensity of verdure" and "bluey bulk" (each pair combining a poetic word with an analytical word) fight against themselves. And the stanza as a whole both describes an image poetically and, in another vocabulary and another voice, humorously undermines that poetic description. While the poet paints the "lambs little by little among their dams," the skeptic says, "what else"? Brilliantly, Beckett has created a sort of stylistic routine out of vaudeville. Verbal slapstick. In spite of the author's lament early in How It Is that there has been a "deterioriation of the sense of humour" (HII, p. 18), the book shows no evidence of such a thing. Stanzas controlled by the comic interplay of lexical fields literally abound. awful moment in any case if there ever was one what vistas that closes the first phase of our life in common and unlatches the second and for that matter last more fertile in vicissitudes and peripeteias the best in my life perhaps best moment I mean it is difficult to choose (HII, p. 56) Tellingly, the next stanza begins: "a human voice there. . . And it is a fact that amidst the bits and scraps of phrases and styles, several momentary but unmistakable voices can be made out. The by-now-familiar learnedness is still present: "the second and for that matter last more fertile in vicissitudes and peripeteias." The poetical "vistas" and the Anglo-Saxon "unlatches" are imported from elsewhere. More importantly, however, Beckett has carefully framed his aloof academese by voices decidedly colloquial. The "awful moment in any case if there ever was one" sounds like a conversational bit blown in from a nineteenth-century drawing room; "the best in my life perhaps best moment" sounds like a hyperbolic scrap from someone's diary. The colloquial frame throws VERBAL SLAPSTICK 51</page><page sequence="10">the intellectualism into ironic relief. But at the same time the academese throws the preceding aristocratic voice and the subsequent intimacy into relief. And Beckett, as always exhibiting a keen ear for anticlimax, tops all three voices with that closing "I mean it is difficult to choose." Perhaps he hints here at the problem of choosing one voice from the many. Or perhaps Beckett the self-parodist merely intends an ironic joke concern ing the choice of "best moments" from all those happy happy days in this and his other works. In Beckett's fiction of the last decade, lexical juxtaposition is still found at the heart of his comic style but in somewhat different form. In The Lost Ones, contrary to How It Is, he seems to be attempting to refine voice absolutely out of his style, and the result is an almost mechanical laying down of words and phrases, a book written by an unfeeling sociologist or even by a computer. There is reference at one point to "the thinking being coldly intent on all these data," which would seem to be an apt description of the narrator himself;14 but what we have here is more a style—again the technique of irony—than a narrator in the novelistic sense. And not surprisingly, the language of poetry is very nearly squeezed out altogether; what poetic words there are seem unwitting slips in the style's cold façade, and are on one occasion parenthetically apologized for: "One school swears by a secret passage branching from one of the tunnels and leading in the words of the poet to nature's sanctuaries" (7X0, p. 18). So too the typically learned polysyllables like "fluctuant," "desiccation," "vertiginous," "stridulence," "resurrectable," and "quincuncially" serve to emphasize an insensitive superiority to the society being described. In addition, the novel is almost overcome by clichés; Beckett means thereby to stress the lack of vividness and uniqueness in the style's perceptions, and as in many of his plays, he stops just short of inanity. "From time immemorial rumour has it or better still the notion is abroad that there exists a way out" (TLO, pp. 17-18). Beckett's aim here is to compose a sociological report and to pass it off as a novel, and his diction must therefore be kept as refrigerated as possible. What humor there is in this book thus depends upon the momentary and of course quite unexpected use of a single word that sud denly melts the ice. Terms such as "fury," "fancy," "ferment," "preco cious," "mite," "famished," "throbbing," "buckle to," "murk," "devoured," "vacation," "succulence," "frenzies," and most certainly "goose bumps" are in the context of this detached diction decidedly out of place. These words come as thunderbolts to this otherwise intellec tualized description of some Godot Figure's no-exit cylinder. An instance of the profound effect of such a momentary heating-up of the novel's uninflected, uninvolved style is the following: l*The Lost Ones (New York: Grove Press, 1972), p. 39. Further references will be made paren thetically in the text as 7X0. 52 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="11">For each climber has a fondness for certain niches and refrains as far as possible from the others. A certain number are connected by tunnels opened in the thickness of the wall and attaining in some cases no fewer than fifty metres in length. But most have no other way out than the way in. It is thought at a certain stage discouragement had prevailed. To be noted in support of this wild surmise the existence of a long tunnel abandoned blind. (7X0, p. 12) Although avoiding the Latinate polysyllables, almost every word in this passage is chosen from a lexical field characterized by an insistence on the superiority of mind over body and soul and the implicit negation of human feeling both among the inhabitants of the cylinder and also in the attitude assumed toward those human beings trapped in the cylinder. This is the language of scientific explanation. Of spatial relationships. Of measurement. It is odd, however, to come across the word "fond ness" used in reference to an individual climber's pitiful intimacy with a niche in the wall. This is not funny. But when we reach the apology for "this wild surmise"—surely it is not "wild" at all—we must smile at the sudden chink in the intellectualized prose. Although the shift is admittedly miniscule, the single word "wild," in the context of such a consistently frigid vocabulary, is as good as a pie in the face. The unex pected loss of distance so meticulously maintained is indeed funny. In fact I delight in having the opportunity to laugh at this inhuman style, which seems to resemble all too closely the flawlessly engineered cylinder itself. The same sort of verbal comedy—although the elegaic mood prevails here—occurs in Beckett's recent novel Company. The distinct vocabularies that can be located in all of his novels from Murphy on are identifiable again, and are competing again, in spite of the "same flat tone" (our attention is more than once drawn to this feature of the style) that tends to obscure the clash of diction. But even here Beckett is lured into at least an occasional lexicographical oddity: "revocable," "saltation," "rhomboid," "hemispherical," "homologous," and "companionably" date from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; "farness," "wither shins," "bourneless," and "alacrious" are listed in the OED as obsolete or rare; and "unformulable," "unstillable," "unscratchable," and "philogenitiveness" don't appear in the OED at all. The style of analysis that dominated Watt some forty years ago is still present: "A rustic hexa hedron. Entirely of logs. Both larch and fir. Six feet across. Eight from floor to vertex. Area twenty-four square feet to furthest decimal."15 But as usual this style is contradicted by one far more lyrical, as in these lines which appear on the same page: "You press your little nose against the pane and all without is rosy. The years have flown and there at the same place as then you sit in the bloom of adulthood bathed in rainbow 15Company (New York: Grove Press, 1980), pp. 38-39. Further references will be made paren thetically in the text as C. VERBAL SLAPSTICK 53</page><page sequence="12">light gazing before you" (C, p. 39). The gentle humor of this novel stems entirely from the subtle juxta position of terms from different lexical fields. Thus in this example a single colloquialism (my italics) jars the framing academese: "All the way from calcaneum to bump of philogenitiveness" (C, p. 51). In this a single academic word disturbs the surrounding poetry: "Out no more to walk the little winding back roads and interjacent pastures now alive with flocks and now deserted" (C, pp. 60-61). In this an odd blank halts the seem ing start to a series of abstractions: "Hope and despair and suchlike barely felt" (C, p. 45). And in this sentence a repulsive image corrupts a beautiful run of poetic diction: "Next thing you are on your way across the white pasture afrolic with lambs in the spring and strewn with red sheep placen tae" (C, p. 35).16 The verbal slapstick of Company is in essence the same as that of Beckett's earlier novels; only here the effects have become yet more subtle and the tone more pervasively lyrical. The appropriate analogy would be with the later, melancholy Chaplin. I trust I've made my point. The comic in Beckett's fiction is the English language itself. Joyce exploited its etymological depth with brilliance; Beckett has exploited its breadth with an equal brilliance. Whereas his personae are typically defeated by words, their creator is never defeated by them. Admittedly, the delicacy of his lexical comedy, particularly in the later works, is at times insufficient to make itself heard above the existential anguish—yet it is always there. And the subtle balance between language used for comic purposes and language used for con veying serious meaning is one of the most characteristic traits of Beckett's prose. Each subsequent phrase threatens to push the tone irrevocably into the realm of either the comic or the tragic. Of course in opposing lexical fields Beckett is also opposing values and points of view. It is here that he parts company with the satirist. Rather than using one vocabulary to belie another—the way Swift and Pope do, for example—Beckett sets one vocabulary over against another simply as a way of showing that both value systems are viable as well as arbitrary. Both are equally false, or, to put it another way, equally true. Similarly, in City Lights Charlie's persistent infatuation with the beautiful blind girl who sells flowers on the sidewalk is perhaps tainted but cer tainly never destroyed by his buffoonery; but neither does his tenderness toward the blind girl destroy the vaudevillian slapstick. The two tones manage to coexist. Détente. In the comedy of silent film as well as in Watt and Beckett's other novels, human intelligence, sentiment, and dignity are not permitted to go unqualified for very long. Man's higher aspira tions are always fastened to his animal body. But when Charlie gets kicked in the pants by the millionaire's butler or when Watt gets hit on the head 16Compare this last example with the following from Watt, p. 47: "The crocuses and the larch turning green every year a week before the others and the pastures red with uneaten sheep placentas. ..." 54 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="13">with a rock thrown by Lady McCann, their aspirations are only bruised. "I can't go on, I'll go on." Charlie and Watt get up again. Human beings are intellectually superior, emotionally needy, and physically no less awkward than a ladder or a bicycle or an automobile. They are all of these at once. Beckett—like Chaplin—understands this. The inclusive ness of his diction dramatizes his willing acceptance of seemingly contra dictory definitions of what it means to be human. Only Watt and the other personae can't accept such complexity. Beckett can. And he asks us to accept it in ourselves. VERBAL SLAPSTICK 55</page></plain_text>
