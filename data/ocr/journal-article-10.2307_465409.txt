With the publication of Wartime Journalism, Critical Writings, and Aesthetic Ideology, the oeuvre of Paul de Man becomes for the first time readily available in near entirety.' Secondary literature on de Man, mean- while, has been accumulating at an even more impressive pace over the last ten years. There is a sense in which the scandal provided by the wartime journalism is little more than another, particularly lurid turn in an ongoing history of institutional fascination with Paul de Man. The products of obsession are necessarily ambiguous; but in this case at least, and perhaps despite appearances, the results have been as positive as one might reasonably hope. Substantial progress has been made in the interpretation of de Man's work: a number of incisive recent essays have advanced our understanding both of the technicalities of de Man's discourse and of the rhetorical or political performance of his texts.2 The opacities of the late essays seem to be yielding to persistent inquiry, and the relation between earlier and later phases of de Man's career is being accorded increasingly complex and nuanced representation. It is certainly no longer possible to rehearse facile characterizations of his thought without sounding dated or naive. When Jeffrey Mehlman, for instance, writes in a recent article that in 1966 de Man got Derrida's interpretation of Rousseau "precisely backwards" [331], one recognizes an idee revue that has outlived the possibility of posing as anything else. Notions of de Man as a "disciple" or "domesticator" of Derrida, as an "ahistorical" "Americanizer" of deconstruction, etc., are no longer able to I thank Cynthia Chase and KevinNewmarkfor their thoughtful andfar-reaching comments on earlier drafts of this essay. 1. Wartime Journalism (U of Nebraska P, 1989); Critical Writings, 1953-1978 (U of Minnesota P, 1989); Aesthetic Ideology (U of Minnesota P, 1990). A final volume, which will collect unpublished essays and lecturesfrom the '50s and late '60s, is forthcoming from Johns Hopkins UP. Unfortunately, no provision has yet been made for republishing a handful of brief but significant texts that de Man wrote after 1978: his "Introduction" to Studies in Romanticism 18.4 (1979); "A LetterfromPaul de Man" in Critical Inquiry 8.3 (1982); his contribution to "Hommage a Georges Poulet," MLN 97.5 (1982); a substantial interview with Robert Moynihan, taped in 1980, and first published in Yale Review 73.4 (1984): 576-602.

It is becoming feasible to claim that, at least in certain quarters, de Man's work is being systematically understood and profitably interrogated. At the same time, of course, an increasing fascination with de Man has meant an increasing number of badly informed, sometimes malicious accounts of "de Manian" theory. And consequently, when writing seriously on de Man, one slips with ease into confrontational postures, often to the detriment of the less polemical, more fundamental question of what motivates our obsession with this writer in the first place. The mystery is not that de Man's complex, densely intertextual work is misunderstood and misrepre- sented but that so much seems to be at stake whenever critics write about this author, whether positively or negatively, and whatever their degree of familiarity with the actual texts. Studies of de Man take place in the shadow of a hostility so pervasive and spectacular that the analysis of such resistance forms part of any genuine analysis of the de Manian text. But it would be misleading to represent this predicament as a crisis, or as simply yet another occasion for intellectual or institutional combat. If, as de Man theorizes, resistance to theory inheres in the theoretical enterprise itself, then the predicament of theory is more complex-and less bleak, though perhaps also less comforting-than the confrontational scenario implies. A certain institutional resistance to de Man's work seems inseparable from its real, though limited, institutional success. Judging from present phenomena, de Man would appear to be winning his wager that only the "classically didactic" can be "really and effectively subversive" [RT 117]. However, the corollary to the proposition that "the more [theory] is resisted, the more it flourishes" is the difficult thesis that "the language it speaks is the language of self-resistance" [RT 20]. Obsession, in other words, might turn out to be the enabling disease of theory. And the proper name of Paul de Man would then be serving as theory's "psychological and therefore intelligible equivalent" [RR 259] of aprocess in which psychological entities are only contingently involved. These considerations in no way mitigate the obligation to negotiate one's obsession with de Man's text with as much scrupulousness as possible. If literary or "de Manian" theory never fully achieves a state of crisis, this is due to theory's excess of instability rather than the reverse; and the violence of which institutions and ideologies are capable in the service of stabilization should not be underestimated. Furthermore, theory, for reasons I examine later in this essay, also necessarily presents itself as a value. The misrepresentation of a text is cause for concer to the precise extent that one is capable of reading it at all. Well-intentioned misreadings signal more urgently than mere displays of hostility the particular difficulties of interpreting a text like de Man's. J. Hillis Miller and ChristopherNorris deserve credit for emphasizing dimensions of de Man's thought- the ethical, in Miller's case; the political, in Norris's-that have suffered grievous misrepresentation in the wider academic press. Both critics, however, misread de Man in symptomatic and similar ways. And as we shall see, a question of ethics proves inseparable from, though not identical to, that of the "symptomatic" or "ideological," since the ethical valences of these two misreadings are not equivalent. The scale and nature of Norris's errors and the fact that his text has the added responsibility of being a book "on" de Man-a book marketed as "the first extended analysis" and "the first full- length introduction" to this critic-impose upon us a predominantly negative task of evaluation. Miller is certainly justified in claiming that, for de Man, readers "must take responsibility" for their interpretations [59]. The difficulty of de Man's thought in this regard, however, consists in its articulation of this ethical imperative with the possibility that misreading is not simply, or even primarily, an ethical problem. 36</page><page sequence="3">?- bi i: - )i II I Q ?1.

Its presentation of de Man's late work as a "critique of aesthetic ideology" constitutes-or at least ought to have constituted-a laudable contribution to the literature on this writer. Norris's particular understanding of aesthetic ideology leads him to emphasize the role of Kant's Critique of Judgment in de Man's thought and in Western intellectual history; and though problems afflict his account from the outset, Norris can claim to have provided an adequate and accessible representation of certain relevant portions of Kant's treatise, and a few well-focused summations of Schillerian ideology: "Aesthetic education" is the process of learning how the mind can and should take pleasure in a jointly sensuous and intellectual exercise which brings the variousfaculties into a state of ideally reciprocal interdependence. In other words, it takesfor granted that organic continuity ofperceptual, cognitive, and linguistic structures which Kant (according to de Man) attempted but signifi- cantly failed to articulate. [116] Remarks such as these and a persistent characterization of de Man's late work as "Ideologiekritik" compose Norris's presentation of the "political" dimension of de Man's thought. There is little more to add on this score: the inadequacy of this book manifests itself from the moment one puts any pressure on the text at all. Norris has correctly identified the aesthetic as the locus of the political but is unable to assess the consequences of his own insight. Periodically a strong claim will emerge but will remain unexplained: What distinguishes Kantian aestheticsfrom the subsequent misreading of Kant by Schiller and others is the blurring of these properly critical lines of demarcation between art, epistemology, history, and ethics. And the fact that such errors may have worldly consequences beyond the specialized sphere of textual hermeneutics is exemplified plainly enough by the aftermath of German idealist metaphysics. [63] If Norris had developed and substantiated this or similar statements, he would indeed have written the study of "deconstruction and the critique of aesthetic ideology" promised in his book's subtitle. Since, however, Norris has not worked through the relationships among the categories he invokes, he is not in a position to deploy the understanding he has achieved. The deficiencies of this book go very deep and manifest themselves on both profound and superficial levels. Norris's understanding of post-Kantian German philosophy, for instance-presumably the tradition of "German idealist metaphysics" that a politicized criticism ought to read and demystify-seems to derive from the scholarly equivalent of hearsay. We are presented with a Hegel whose dialectic originates in "a kind of rich but confused harmony with nature" [30]; a Nietzsche given to "immoderate or downright nonsensical claims" [43]; a Heidegger who forsakes Husserlian rigor for "an existentialist brooding on mortality, finitude, Being, and time" [172]. Such caricatures call into question Norris's acquaintance not only with the oeuvre of Hegel or Heidegger but also with that of Paul de Man. De Man's numerous reflections on these texts, for the record, include a quite accessible account of Heidegger's rigor ["Heidegger Reconsidered," now CW 102-06] and more than one emphatic reminder that Hegelian thought neither begins 38</page><page sequence="5">nor closes in a state of "harmony," let alone a "rich but confused harmony with nature" ("If there ever was a philosophy of necessary separation, it is Hegel's; to assimilate the notion of Absolute Spirit with idealist reconciliation is to simplify all the way into misprision" [BI 265]). Norris is occasionally given to quoting Adomo: he would have done well to have recalled Adoro's remark that "Hegel sought to free aesthetics from absolute idealism, a task which is still with us today" [237]. But if in one sense the inadequacy of Norris's book must be ascribed to carelessness and judged accordingly, in another sense the text's weakness must be understood as programmatic: as the result of the mechanical ideological operations that the notion of "aesthetic ideology," in fact, seeks to name. The overriding though often tacit goal of Norris's Paul de Man is to ground de Man's texts in a humanist, occasionally overtly psychobiographical narrative, thereby suspend- ing, by aestheticizing, their critical thrust. In what follows I shall be most interested in Norris's rendering of the late essays: their claim on our attention is urgent, and furthermore the late work is what Norris both valorizes and most saliently, even imaginatively, misunderstands. But first let me provide an account of this book's alternatively tacit and explicit narrative structure, together with an example of the kind of distortion that de Man's earlier work suffers in being inserted into the storyline. Norris has organized his text around the venerable cliche that de Man's oeuvre divides into a bad early, existential part and a good late, deconstructive one. Roughly until Allegories of Reading, the essays are prey to Lentricchian charges of quietism; subse- quently they compose a hardheaded critique of totalizing ideologies. During the fifteen years or so that de Man's work has been an object of debate, no figurative pattern has proved more tenacious than this teleological, often unambiguously Augustinian narra- tive. Ever since the publication of Richard Klein's "The Blindness of Hyperboles" (1973), or, in a negative mode, Frank Lentricchia's After the New Criticism (1980), discussions of de Man have tended to be organized around the narrative alternatives of continuity and conversion, with the former negatively and the latter positively valorized. The early work is flawed, and the question is whether or not the late work has repented and changed its ways.3 Since the Augustinian narrative of conversion is only a more complex version of the narrative of continuity that it pretends to oppose, this interpretative model offers high rewards at low hermeneutic risk, and in the wake of the discovery of the wartime journalism it has necessarily acquired even greater appeal. For it strings into a familiar and comforting narrative facts that no one has any interest in denying. De Man' s wartime journalism is unquestionably inhabited by the most dangerous of Western ideologies, and his postwar criticism certainly at least seeks to offer a critique of such ideologies. The binary pairings of before and after, bad and good (or bad and less bad) have now become visibly indispensable. The event of the wartime journalism thus tests a critic's understanding of de Man's critique of religious humanism. If one has not grasped the rationale and hence the urgency of the de Manian project, one will understandably regress to the psychological models of unity, agency, and change that underwrite classical ethical causality. So it is unsurprising that Norris, in his postscript on the wartime journalism, should tell us that "we cannot any longer" read de Manian passages on the inhumanity of language "as they ask to be read" 3. Critics like Lentricchia and Gearhart, for all their differences, arraign de Man on nearly identical charges: "a metaphysical complacency" that is "never fully expurgated in the later essays" [Lentricchia 287]; "an implicit theory of literary self-reflexivity" that produces a "profound continuity" in de Man's work [Gearhart 70, 74]. Apologists for de Man, meanwhile, will speak of "a strange conversion"; of the "expunging" of "metaphysical categories" [Klein 34, 39]; or, more prosaically, of a progression from formalist misconceptions to genuine decon- struction [Gasche, "Deconstruction" 208]. diacritics / summer 1989 39</page><page sequence="6">[191]; or that he should subordinate theoretical issues to confessional consolations: "de Man's own experience had left so deep and lasting an impression on his work that one simply cannot separate (in T. S. Eliot's phrase) the 'man who suffers' from 'the mind that creates"' [192].4 Such remarks encapsulate the aestheticizing gesture with which Norris, in his own words, "blurs the critical lines of demarcation" of de Man's thought, taking for granted, like Schiller, the "organic continuity of perceptual, cognitive, and linguistic structures."5 And though de Man's wartime journalism spurs Norris to particularly uncompromising figures of assimilation and containment, a recourse to empirical psy- chology occurs throughout the book. One moment Norris will claim that "no critic has done more than de Man to discourage the kind of lazy or short-cut 'reading' that passes clean through the complexities of textual understanding to arrive at some putative psycho- biographical content" [169]; then, a sentence later, he will turn toward psychobiography anyway: "Nevertheless I would argue that the two approaches are not incompatible" [170]. He does not "argue"; he asserts and proffers. Norris knows that he is supposed to debunk psychobiography, but it holds an irresistible attraction for him. We understand these inconsistencies better when we understand the force of the aestheticizing-that is, humanizing-ideological patterns that are conditioning what might otherwise seem mere insouciance. Later in this essay I shall be seeking to locate the place of a certain humanism in de Man's text-a humanism de Man can be read as warning us to preserve-but for the moment we need to assess the hidden costs of humanism as ideology, as a principle of closure. The exemplary value of Norris's book, as we shall see, lies in its demonstration that the price of obtaining the human can amount, among other things, to a "literal" failure to read. Consider first Norris's account of a rich essay published in 1966, "Wordsworth and Holderlin." Norris examines this essay in his opening chapter in order to prove that de Man, prior to his conversion to Ideologiekritik sometime in the 1970s, writes in the service of "political quietism" [17]. The banality of the charge hardly diminishes its reductive 4. Norris insists that this remark does not prejudice our ability to "accept the validity andforce of [de Man's] arguments" [192], but he never explains how he proposes to articulate those arguments with Eliotic religious humanism. On the contrary, whenever a decisive gesture becomes necessary, Norris's reaction is either to admit bewilderment ("It is hard to know what to make of such claims" [xix]) or to strip de Man's texts of authority ("we cannot any longer" read them "as they ask to be read"). As de Man, of course, never tired of pointing out, such gestures need not be overtly naive or sentimental and are in fact very difficult to avoid. One of the ironies legible in Richard Klein's sophisticated early essay on Blindness and Insight is that a text setting out to critique the "metaphysical tradition" that supposedly rides herd on de Man's pre-deconstructive work [34] should conclude under the metaphysical sign of resurrection and return: "The result of[de Man's Oedipal encounter with Derrida] is a loss of control, a breakdown of language, that allows [de Man] to recover his own problem transformed by what it had repressed" [43]. 5. In a moment I shall examine what I take to be the most specific and original element in de Man's critique of humanism, but it might be worth recalling here another passage in Adorno's Aesthetic Theory that speaks with peremptory relevance to Norris's text: Schiller was potentially the first Kantian to have been openly inimical to works of art, for he considers the human being behind them more essential than the works themselves. In Schiller's concept of genius, modelled as it is on the person of Goethe, idealistic hubris transfers the idea of creation from the transcendental to the empirical subject, i.e., the productive artist. This is in harmony with vulgar bourgeois consciousness for two reasons: one, it glorifies pure creation by the human being without regard to purpose and thus feeds into the bourgeois work ethic; and, two, it relieves the viewer of the task of understanding the artistic object before him, giving him instead a surrogate-the personality of the artist or, worse, trashy biographies of him. [245] 40</page><page sequence="7">absurdity. One need only skim through the essays written between 1955 and 1970 to appreciate the near-obsessional dimensions, in fact, of de Man's antagonism toward what one very early piece calls the "nihilism" and "conservatism" of "antihistoricism" ["The Inward Generation" [1955], CW 15].6 When Norris tells us that "if history remains an operative term in de Man's writing, it is a history entirely given over to [a] sense of Hamlet-like ironic detachment from the world of practical affairs" [16], his distance from the de Manian oeuvre attains grimly empirical proportions.7 But even when he has clearly, in the empirical sense, "read"-and worked on-a de Manian text, Norris will misread "empirically" in the sense that one's refutation can take the form of simply quoting from the text in question. We are told that, in the early work, "what [de Man] always sets up in opposition to history is a certain idea of the poetic, of poetry as a deeper, more authentic knowledge undeluded by the claims of merely secular understanding" [5]. As a case in point, the essay "Wordsworth and Holderlin" is "an allegory of poetic consciousness in its progress beyond the perils and the pressures of active political involvement" [ 14]. Thus "Lentricchia and Eagleton are right to detect a mood of profound political disenchantment in de Man's early writings" [26]. But it is simply not the case that poetry and political- historical action oppose each other in "Wordsworth and Holderlin"-or in any postwar text by de Man. The complex relation between poetry and history that de Man proposes in "Wordsworth and Holderlin" does not lend itself to single-sentence summary, but one would have to begin with the observation that action-revolutionary, unmediated action-makes poetry, or at least a certain kind of poetry, possible; poetry, on the other hand, makes possible our understanding of the action as historical action: as a meaningful, memorable event. In the Wordsworth text de Man is reading, both the poet, seeking to cross the Alps, and the revolutionary insurgents, seeking to destroy the cloister of the Grande Chartreuse, "stand under the influence of the poetic faculty" [RR 58]. Poetry partakes of both action and reflection, being "an act of the mind which allows it to turn from one to the other" [RR 59]. The price of poetry, in fact, is an imbrication in history: "this consciousness can be had only by one who has very extensively partaken of the danger and failure [of action]" [RR 58]. Norris, like so many hasty readers of de Man, hears in a term like "failure" a call to quietism; but "success" in such a context would mean not history but apocalypse, and de Man is urging us to "achieve a historical significance" [RR 65]. The politics of this piece are complex and contextual, perhaps even ambiguous; but they do not reduce to "quietism," and above all they do not translate into an aestheticism that would divorce "poetry" from "active political involvement." The essay's most salient purpose, in fact, is to dispute a "commonplace of Holderlin criticism" that posits a "direct opposition between Titanism [i.e., action] and poetry" [RR 61]. What makes Norris's account particularly unfortunate is the pseudo-objective rhetoric of a book "on" de Man: with Lentricchia or Eagleton one at least knows one is in the presence of 6. Compare "The Temptation of Permanence," or de Man's review of Joseph Frank and J. Hillis Miller, who, according to de Man, write "very disparagingly about history," forgetting that poetic language, being temporal, "can never beplastically 'closed"' or "so loftily disengagedfrom actual exegesis or history" ["Spacecritics" (1964), CW 112, 114]. 1 thank Cynthia Chase for bringing de Mafi's remarks in "The Inward Generation" to my attention and for suggesting the critique of Norris's rendering of "Wordsworth and Holderlin" that I am sketching here. 7. "History" as an "operative term" recurs constantly throughout the de Manian oeuvre, from the early essays mentioned above to thefinal line of "Anthropomorphism and Trope" ("True mourning is less deluded. The most it can do is to... enumerate... historical modes of language power" [RR 262, de Man's emphasis]). Farfrom signifying "ironic detachment," history signifies the disruptive event of meaning. I return to this point a little later in the present essay. For a discussion of de Man's complex notion of history, see Newmark; see also Chase, "Trappings," and my forthcoming "De Man, Schiller, and the Politics of Reception," in William Flesch, ed., Ascetic Ideology: De Man and Politics (Detroit: Wayne State UP, 1990). diacritics / summer 1989 41</page><page sequence="8">a polemicist, whereas Norris would have us believe that he has weighed various perspectives and found a compromise. It says a good deal about this book that Norris's narrative of conversion, for all its omnipresent coerciveness, does not even have a rationale. "One can only conjecture as to the reasons-circumstantial or otherwise-for the clearly marked shift in de Man's ideological stance" [156].8 But as noted earlier, it does not suffice to convict the author of carelessness. We should try to understand why the text responds so eagerly, at certain points, to the temptation of superficiality. If we fail to articulate such carelessness with an ideological drive, we merely repeat, without displacing, the ideological gesture that would freeze and totalize discourse within the incomprehensibility of human freedom. And it is exactly this gesture that bears the name "aesthetic ideology" in de Man's late writings. De Man's work also famously teaches that reading repeats the error it sets out to analyze; and if we examine a little more closely Norris's construal of "aesthetic ideology," we shall be better placed to formulate the intersection, both in de Man's work and in Norris's representation of it, between inevitable and unnecessary error. For "aesthetic ideology" names the transformation of undecidability (between, above all, the inevitable and the unnecessary) into an aesthetic inextricable from, in Derrida's phrase, a "pragmatic anthropology" ["Parergon" 108]: [Man] is the only subject of this Critique ofjudgment. Only he is capable of an ideal of beauty and, from this ideal, capable of letting the sans of the pure cut present itself. He is capable of this ideal of the imagination as to the things of nature because he is endowed with reason, which means, in Kantian language, able to fix his own ends. ["Parergon" 111] "Man" as noumenon, as moral being, figures the closure of Kantian discourse. Man embodies and insures, within the totality of a final purpose (Endzweck), the concord of the faculties (subjective finality) and that between the faculties and nature (objective finality): of man "it can no longer be asked why he exists. His existence involves the highest purpose .. ." [Kant 285]. Man thus repeats on a higher level the possibility of aesthetic judgment: of the free and indeterminate accord among reason, understanding, and imagination, upon which the operations of pure and practical reason implicitly depend.9 In other words, the concept of man insures the articulation that the aesthetic seeks between phenomenal and noumenal realms-or more prosaically, between perception and cogni- tion; or more prosaically yet, between a sign and a meaning. De Man's work achieves its critique of ideology by way of a critique of language. All signification, de Man claims, hangs upon an aesthetic moment, a presumption of legibility 8. Norris's most prominent criterion, infact, for distinguishing between de Man's early and late work is tonal. The early work is couched in "a language heavy with existential overtones" [6]; then with Allegories of Reading comes the "decisive change" [17]: de Man's arguments "are conducted now in a language of much greater restraint and analytical precision" [54]. The late work has "adopted a more chastened and self-denying style, one that admits only occasional unguarded hints of this earlier existential ethos" [54], its language having been for the most part "purged of such existential residues" [96]. For all this persistent attention to tone, we are never told why one ought to write in a chastened and self-denying style; what it means to write one way rather than another way; why "existential overtones" are bad, etc. Norris never asks whatpathos might mean in de Man, and, worse, he has not taken his topic seriously enough to listen to the tone of the late essays, which, while certainly differentfrom that of de Man's early work, is anything but restrained or chastened. I will briefly discuss pathos in de Man in connection with his notion of ethics later; see also note 13. 9. For a lucid summary of the role of aesthetic judgment and the figure of "man" in Kant's critical philosophy, see Deleuze, esp. 68-75. 42</page><page sequence="9">closely de Man's technical elaboration of this issue; for now, let me recall the burden acquired by a discourse that identifies "man" as a coercive-though possibly inevitable- trope, and the "aesthetic" as a dimension of language's constitutive error. Theory, as noted at the outset of this essay, becomes a volatile, difficult enterprise, constantly participating in the error it demystifies. If an aesthetic, ideological moment simultane- ously enables and destabilizes all discourse, we cannot avoid "blurring [the] ... lines between [sic] art, epistemology, history, and ethics" [Norris 63]; to the extent that we read at all, we repeat language's error. Such is the trap (into which) de Man springs, for example, in the closing sentence of "Aesthetic Formalization in Kleist": "the trap of an aesthetic education which inevitably confuses dismemberment of language by the power of the letter with the gracefulness of a dance," and which is "as unavoidable as it is deadly" [RR 290]. The unavoidability of this trap, as we shall see, in no way authorizes the banal misconception of deconstruction as ethically vitiated-quite the contrary. But for the moment let me continue to emphasize error's inevitability, since Norris's text intervenes at precisely this juncture in order to safeguard its ideological project. It is no coincidence that the book's most systematic misrepresentation of de Manian thought should occur in the proximity of the philosopher whose work Norris understands most thoroughly. With varying degrees of subtlety, Norris renders de Man's work as a philosophy of limits. "(I)t is de Man's conviction that one of [Kant's] categories-the aesthetic-has indeed very often overreached itself, to the detriment of clear thinking about issues of epistemology, ethics, and politics" [53]. De Man "like Kant is concerned to set limits to the play of seductive metaphors and analogies that characterize aesthetic understanding; ... he sees a real danger in the various moves to extend or annul those limits, to apply aesthetic notions directly to other domains of knowledge" [48, Norris's emphasis]. Norris's discussion repeatedly hints that "seductive metaphors" could discover and remain within "proper limits," that there could be such a thing as a controlled and properly mediated aesthetic notion. In semi-tacitly construing de Man as a champion of epistemological and aesthetic decorum, Norris undoubtedly performs one of the more surprising misreadings in the history of de Man's reception.10 The misreading, however, is perfectly consistent with the humanist project that inhabits Norris's text. For the point of erecting the human as ideal and as "empirical" fact is to shelter discourse within the humane space of a ratio, with the random and the erroneous distinguished from the determined and the true. Norris is left with a problem of impressive dimensions, however, since this rather bizarre Enlightenment de Man will clearly experience some difficulty shouldering the texts attributed to him. One of Norris's solutions is to quote sparingly from de Man's essays. For all the attention and importance Norris grants Kant, for instance, he refers to de Man's sole published essay on this author, "Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant," as infrequently as possible. During his brief and rare close encounters with this essay, he resorts to the secondary tactic of quoting de Man without explaining what the quotation says. But the lacunae are revealing, and by way of supplementing them we can examine more closely and technically de Man's critique of aesthetic ideology. "Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant" constitutes de Man's most extended thematization of linguistic materialism. Here is Norris on what de Man's late essays call the "materiality of the letter": This resistance [to the seductive power of the aesthetic] is there to be read in the letter of Kant's texts, in variousproblematic turns of metaphor and analogy that don't make their point with quite the intended force. "The critique of the aesthetic ends up, in Kant, in aformal materialism that runs counter to all values 10. For a careful characterization of de Man's discourse as a principled refusal of the delimitations of philosophical thought, see Gasche, "In-Difference." diacritics / summer 1989 43</page><page sequence="10">aesthetic ends up, inKant, in aformal materialism that runs counter to all values and characteristics associated with aesthetic experience, including the aes- thetic categories of the beautiful and the sublime" (PMK, p. 136). [58] Here Norris's text dodges off toward greener pastures ["As in his reading of Proust, de Man finds fault not so much with Kant.. ." etc.]; but the question of materiality recurs a few sentences later: But there is also... a subtext of argument in Kant that resists this aestheticizing drive, maintains the distinction between orders ofjudgment, and thus holds out against ideological confusion. The very title of[de Man's] essay announces this theme by pointedly contrasting the "phenomenal" and the "material" as disjunct modes of understanding. And the theme is taken up in his closing sentence, which effectively condenses the entire critical project of de Man's late writings. "The bottom line, in Kant as well as in Hegel, is the prosaic materiality of the letter and no degree of obfuscation or ideology can transform this materiality into the phenomenal cognition of aesthetic judgment" (PMK, p. 144). [59] This time the quotation ends the paragraph. What we see here is pretty much all Norris's reader gets. One may well wonder what "mode of understanding" could so dispense with phenomenality as to merit the appellation "material"; but if we track the word material's occurrence in Norris's text, we rediscover the same pattern of distortion that we have encountered elsewhere. Norris will characterize the "difference between whata text says" and "what the various critics have made it say" in terms of"the stubborn materiality of the words on the page" [42]; at another point we are told that materiality denotes "what actually occurs in the process of reading": in other words, a "resistance to received or canonical forms of understanding" [71]. Materiality has become another name for objectivity, the cognitively stable product of right reading. And since such rationalism is inseparable, within a certain post-Kantian discourse, from an empiricizing anthropol- ogy, Norris will also understand the "starkly material force" of de Man's wartime journalism in terms of its power to "return to haunt the writer" [191]. De Man's notion of materiality is closely related to his notion of the positional power of language-another issue that Norris significantly omits to negotiate, for all its unique prominence in de Man's late work. The materiality of the letter indicates the prephenome- nal conditions of signification that make phenomenal cognition-that is to say, signifi- cation-possible. Rapidly put, the condition of signification for de Man is that significa- tion be undecidable. The materiality of the letter consists in the necessary though impossible possibility that a sign may not be a sign. De Man's most accessible example of linguistic materiality, as Jonathan Culler notes, is Saussure's inability to decide whether the anagrammatic patterns he is discovering in Latin poetry are random or determined-that is, whether or not the patterns are significant [RT 37-38]. As Culler remarks, this predicament shows that "to perceive the signifier at all is to confer on some patterns but not on others the status of meaningful articulations" [104]. This act of conferral, however, is not primarily subjective or empirical. It is built into language as the trope of language. This trope of language is what de Man conceptualizes as positional power. Language must posit itself, in a radically incoherent performative catachresis, and with the same gesture it must erase that performance's incoherence-which is to say, it must erase its own positing act. "[L]anguage posits and language means (since it articulates), but language cannot posit meaning; it can only reiterate (or reflect) it in its reconfirmed falsehood" [RR 117-18]. The blankness of the inscription-of the sign that may not be one-is, de Man says, "the only thing we actually get" [RT 42]. What this 44</page><page sequence="11">means is that, as Cynthia Chase says, "the process of signification, which has a material element, is made to serve as an example and guarantee of the phenomenality of experience" ["Giving a Face" 105]; however, it does not mean that this material element is present to itself and to us as an empirical fact, as Norris's text, for want of a proper understanding of de Manian discourse, is forced to imply. What we "actually get" is a necessary precondition of experience that is not only impossible to "experience" but is also "impossible" tout court, insofar as the determined is being derived from the possibility of the random. De Man will call what we "actually get" "formal materialism" in "Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant." Formal because, in contradistinction to a classical materialism that would oppose matter and form, potentiality and presence, de Manian materialism is a materialism of the sign. The (impossible) Kantian eye, the Augenschein that de Man evokes at the end of this essay, sees the sign non-teleologically or "formally," and under this "stony gaze" the sign fragments into the mere possibility of signification: "meaning-producing tropes are replaced by the fragmentation of sentences and propositions into discrete words, or the fragmentation of words into syllables or finally letters" [PMK 144]. And to "see" a "letter" non-teleologically would be to see it in its materiality: not as part of an alphabet, or as the instrument of a sign, but as the blank, contradictory, necessary impossibility of meaningless form. We may seem to have drifted away from the topic of aesthetic ideology, but we have in fact arrived at its heart. When de Man speaks of the "materiality of actual history" [RR 262], and of the aesthetic as "one of the most powerful ideological drives to act upon the reality of history" [RR 264], he summarizes in compressed form the political burden of rhetorical critique: The aesthetic, as is clearfrom Schiller's formulation, is primarily a social and political model, ethically grounded in an assumedly Kantian notion offreedom; despite repeated attempts by commentators, alarmed by its possible implica- tions, to relativise and soften the idea of the aesthetic state (Aesthetischer Staat) that figures so prominently at the end of the Letters on Aesthetic Education, it should be preserved as the radical assertion that it is. The "state" that is here being advocated is not just a state of mind or of soul, but a principle of political value and authority that has its own claim on the shape and the limits of our freedom. It would lose all interest if this were not the case. For it is as apolitical force that the aesthetic still concerns us as one of the most powerful ideological drives to act upon the reality of history. [RR 264] De Man's work gives us to think a difficult understanding of "actual history" or the "reality of history" as material in the sense just outlined. History is "what we actually get": it is that dimension of the production of meaning which is not a trope, being the very condition of the distinction between "literal" and "figurative." History thus "as such is purely a linguistic complication" [RT 92], but not in the sense of being distinguished from a "real" world of events; history names rather the event of meaning: the occurrence of a constitutive disruption within a tropological field. The materiality-the (potential) randomness or singularity-of every meaning-event is what the aesthetic seeks to efface, by naturalizing the principle of meaning's production. Such naturalization can occur only as a violent, obsessional gesture; and while an initial naturalizing aberrancy, as we have seen, is built into language as the principle of language's (im)possibility, the systematic valorization of the aesthetic, de Man suggests, is potentially totalitarian in its implications. If aesthetic education is an unavoidable trap, the scale of its deadliness depends upon the degree to which the aesthetic instance is empiricized into a pedagogical and political program: into theBildung of individual and nation. Since the composition and sustenance of such aBildungsroman depend upon the mistaking of "formal materialism" asform, the diacritics / summer 1989 45</page><page sequence="12">system will be controlled by the need to exorcise the principle of its own production: a mechanical, infinite, and hence potentially infinitely cruel task. As Chase writes: "Once the aesthetification of the mechanical, technical processes or devices of production and signification has taken place-once they are conceived as the vital surplus ofform, in the sense of originality or model-nothing checks their performative power" ["Trappings" 63]. De Man's work grants rigor and necessity to the seemingly paradoxical continuity of aesthetic humanism with technocracy, with the worship of machines, and finally with the most inhuman historical facts and possibilities." Norris's Paul de Man would have been a valuable book, and a very different one, if it had pursued its own topic to the end. Instead it must take second honors as an eloquent, if unselfconscious, testimonial to the power of de Man's thought to disturb. The difficulty with which Norris reads the early work becomes more legible in retrospect; his encounter with the late work has made more salient the coercive force of the very ideological structure that his subtitle names. Where de Man's discourse thematizes a passage beyond the thematic, Norris becomes blind to de Man's theme. Curious, occasionally comical side effects result. Norris's rationalist-humanist narrative, for instance, which, as we have seen, takes the form of valorizing Kant over a nebulous and nefarious "German idealism," severely troubles his ability to read de Man on Hegel. As noted earlier, Norris's acquaintance with Hegelian thought appears slender, but this did not allow one to predict that he would credit de Man with statements about Hegel that are exactly contrary to what de Man actually says. We are told that the Hegelian dictum "the beautiful is the sensory manifestation of the idea" is "a claim that clearly represents for de Man a considerable slackening of philosophic rigor when compared with Kant's more complex, circuitous, and endlessly self-qualifying treatment of cognate themes" [60]. Norris offers no proof for this remark, which is hardly surprising: there is none. Adducing another Hegelian claim that de Man discusses, "art is for us a thing of the past," Norris then writes: De Man'spoint is that these two propositions should be taken together and read as symptomatic of the errors and confusions that overtake aesthetic theory after Kant. What makes art "a thing of the past" for Hegel is not, as he would have us think, its belonging to an earlier, relatively undeveloped stage in the history of culture and thought. Rather, it resultsfrom the impossible demand that Hegel himself places on art, his retreat into a form of aesthetic ideology which seeks to bypass the antinomies of critical reason. [61] Norris has gotten de Man's argument backwards. For our purposes we need only recall that, in "Sign and Symbol in Hegel's Aesthetics," the mind or the "I," the subject of utterance, turns out to be structured according to the linguistic paradox we sketched earlier. Just as (or because) language must turn away from its own impossibility, the mind must "shelter itself from self-erasure" [SS 770]; and one mode of shelter is the aesthetic: the "ideology of the symbol which Hegel both espouses and undoes" [SS 771]. This undoing occurs, in de Man's reading, precisely at the intersection of the claims "the beautiful is the sensory appearance of the idea" and "art is for us a thing of the past"-this last claim being, in fact, one of "the enigmatic statements that have troubled Hegel's readers" [SS 773]. The sensory manifestation of the ideaoccurs viaroutine memorization [Geddchtnis], which, unlike recollection [Erinnerung], mustbe figured as the inscription, the violent imposition, of meaning: 11. Lacoue-Labarthe's study of what he calls "national aestheticism" provides an account, in many respects congruent with de Man's, of the "continuity between the ideology of organicism and thecommitmenttomechanicalformationsand technologicalpower" [Chase, "Trappings" 62; see also 49-53, 62-63; Lacoue-Labarthe 82-149]. 46</page><page sequence="13">We can now assert that the two statements, "art isfor us a thing of the past" and "the beautiful is the sensory manifestation of the idea" are in fact one and the same .... Art is "of the past" in a radical sense, in that, like memorization, it leaves the interiorization of experience forever behind. It is of the past to the extent that it materially inscribes, and thusforeverforgets, its ideal content. The reconciliation of the two main theses of the Aesthetics occurs at the expense of the aesthetic as a stable philosophical category. [SS 773-74] It is thus Hegel's critical rigor, not a "retreat into a form of aesthetic ideology," that motivates his affirmation of art's pastness; like Kant's Augenschein, this figure makes legible the material conditions of signification. Norris's most curious, and telling, mistake, however, concerns neither Hegel nor Kant, nor the technically difficult theme of linguistic materiality. As his book gets underway Norris tells us: "In his later work de Man will insist that misreadings can be either 'errors' or 'mistakes,' the latter attributable to mere incompetence or carelessness, but the former responding to some deep necessity in the encounter between text and commentary" [13]. Lest we imagine that Norris's mistake is simply a mistake, he repeats it in the middle of his book: "Hence the distinction-crucial to de Man-between errors of reading induced by perplexities genuinely there in the text and mistakes which come about through lapses of attention or mere inability to read" [105]. Finally, closer to the end, we are told once again of the "distinction" de Man makes between "mere 'mistakes' and significant 'errors"' [149]. There is only one very short text in the entire de Manian corpus to footnote on this issue, and Norris footnotes it; he does not quote from it, understandably, since that would scatter the house of cards. Here is the relevant paragraph: I am grateful to Stanley Corngoldfor having pointed out a polarity (errorl mistake) that I have not explicitly thematized in these terms. If "mistake" is random and contingent (of the order of "can" or "may") and "error" is systemic and compulsive (of the order of "must"), then I have stated, in a variety ofterminologies, the impossibility of ever coming to rest on one or the other side of this distinction.... I can therefore only agree with Corngold when he says that "it is not possible to discriminate between these categories" in my writings. ["Letter" 509, my emphasis] So is Norris's misreading a mistake? Yes, perhaps: it might as well be attributed to "mere incompetence or carelessness," "coming about through lapses of attention or mere inability to read." And is Norris's misreading an error? Yes, perhaps: it takes its place in a systemic misprision of de Man, a misreading determined to discover at all costs in his texts a stable difference between the random and the meaningful; to retrieve his thought as the pathos of an intentionality, the self-expression of a psychological entity. Norris's Paul de Man pursues its error with impressive consistency, a fact that cannot, however, repress the possibility that this text might have its origins in a mere, contingent-if massive-mistake. 2 De Manian theory can be reductively but usefully summed up as the narrative of a disruptive collusion between the undecidable and the imperative. We have examined the thematic of linguistic materialism, which, as the narrative of aperformed cognition, marks diacritics / summer 1989 47</page><page sequence="14">the limit of a conception of language as cognition or trope and consequently figures the outer limit of theory. Such is "history" in its non-cognitive, performative materiality. The "ethical" burden of theory might then be characterized as the pursuit of the "historical." The problematic of the ethical belongs to cognition: it is controlled by the paradox of tropological language, which manifests itself as the imperative undecidability of referen- tiality.l2 Referentiality is undecidable because literal meaning exists only within the possibility of being read as a trope; it is imperative because, as the telos of literal meaning, it constitutes the possibility of language as cognition. De Man's "radical critique of referential meaning never implie[s] that the referential function of language [can] in any way be avoided, bracketed, or reduced to being just one contingent linguistic property among others" [AR 207]. The referent cannot be determined and cannot be bracketed: the fantasy of an escape from language's epistemological paradox into a stable condition of "ambiguity" is the dream of aesthetic ideology. The radical impossibility of distinguish- ing between mistakenness and error, in other words, incites rather than prevents the recurrence of such distinctions. Theory can be said to bear the name "allegory" in Allegories of Reading: The paradigmfor all texts consists of afigure (or a system offigures) and its de- construction. But since this model cannot be closed off by a final reading, it engenders, in its turn, a supplementaryfigural superposition which narrates the unreadability of the prior narration.... [W]e can call such narratives to the second (or third) degree allegories. [AR 205] Allegories figure the critique of language produced by the initial imbalance of "figura- tion": by the fact that a figure, in order to be read, must be read from the perspective of a literal meaning that the figure itself cannot guarantee. As in de Man's famous reading of Rousseau's Essay on the Origin of Language, the initial wild metaphor produced by one primitive man upon seeing another primitive man ("giant") must be misread as possessing a literal meaning (in this case that of subjectivity or pathos: "I feel fear") and subsequently domesticated into a concept ("man") [AR 149-59]. Since these literalizing transformations are always possibly ungrounded, a deconstructive critique is generated in tandem with them. However, since the critique is participating in the error it denounces, allegory is generated as the narrative of the impossibility of reading. And as J. Hillis Miller writes, "one form that repetition of the first error takes is the mode of referentiality that de Man calls 'ethicity"' [45]. For, having achieved his definition of allegory, de Man characterizes allegories as "ethical": [I]n the allegory of unreadability, the imperatives of truth andfalsehood oppose the narrative syntax and manifest themselves at its expense. The concatenation of the categories of truth andfalsehood with the values of right and wrong is disrupted, affecting the economy of the narration in decisive ways. We can call this shift in economy ethical, since it indeed involves a displacementfrom pathos to ethos. Allegories are always ethical, the term ethical designating the structural interference of two distinct value systems. In this sense, ethics has nothing to do with the will (thwarted or free) of a subject, nor a fortiori, with a relationship between subjects. The ethical category is imperative (i.e., a category rather than a value) to the extent that it is linguistic and not subjective. Morality is a version of the same language aporia that gave rise to such concepts as "man" or "love" or "self," and not the cause or consequence of such 12. For a powerful discussion ofAllegories of Reading in terms ofits "referential imperative," see Hamacher. 48</page><page sequence="15">concepts. The passage to an ethical tonality does not resultfrom a transcenden- tal imperative but is the referential (and therefore unreliable) version of a linguistic confusion. Ethics (or, one should say, ethicity) is a discursive mode among others. [AR 206] This dense, seductively iconoclastic passage merits close examination. The terms "category" and "categorical" obtain a Kantian burden here, indicating the condition of possibility of discourse or cognition. And de Man's use of the term "value" may become clearer if we adduce a remark from a subsequent chapter ofAllegories ofReading: "values of truth and falsehood" "become values only because of the possibility of error" [AR 240]. The epistemological predicament of trope is categorical or imperative but immediately becomes a value system, with truth valorized over falsehood, because truth can be generated only within a field of undecidability. If truth, Wahrheit, were "simply" true, wahr, it would be neither valuable nor valueless, neither bad nor good. Valuation is attendant on binary oppositions because of the asymmetry of radical figuration and derives from the categorical necessity to decide the undecidable difference between literal and figurative meaning. Under the terms of the pseudonarrative of Allegories of Reading, a first-order deconstruction, propelled by the categorical imperative of reference, serves the value of truth by discovering the impossibility of reference in the mode of pathos. Pathos, be it "terror" or "prophetic exultation," stems from "referential indeterminacy" [AR 197] and works to "stabilize the semantics of the figur; by making it 'mean' the pathos of its undoing" [AR 199]. It thus produces the illusion of an author "as far beyond pleasure and pain as he is beyond good and evil," "a single voice"-Paul de Man's, say-"that, by the rigor of its negativity, finally coincides with what it asserts" [AR 173, 172]. But since this recuperative phantasm is in contradiction with its principle of production, the allegorical mode asserts itself by way of the abdication of the author as a principle of control: an abdication that must be "thematized as a sacrifice" [AR 206]-and that consequently, of course, carries its own pathetic charge. This gesture of renunciation is in fact central to the phenomenon of de Man's own charisma.3 But for the moment consider the thematic purchase of this scenario within de Manian theory. Though inevitably misread as the pathetic gesture of a subject, this renunciation of pathos is in fact the figure of an insight achieved at the expense of its own narrative. The categories of truth and falsehood necessarily appear as values, but now they appear as moral values-Julie's interminable preaching, Rousseau's boring moralistic digressions-disrupting the seductively rigor- ous and self-aggrandizing narrative controlled by the values of truth and falsehood. Two value systems now oppose each other, and the category of the epistemological has mutated into the category of the ethical precisely to the extent that the production of "value"- including the value of subjectivity-is being rendered visibly incoherent as well as necessary. The most remarkable aspect of this development is that the manifestation of the greatest impersonal, theoretical rigor-the ethical category, "ethicity"-occurs in the production of a divergence between theoretical statement and pragmatic advice. Rather than dwelling within its negative knowledge, the allegory "speaks out with the referential efficacity of a praxis" [AR 208-09]. And this is because of the "persistence of the referential moment," which is constitutive of the narrative of unreadability: incoherently, 13. See my "De Man, Schiller, and the Politics of Reception." Neil Hertz's "Lurid Figures" constitutes a sustained reading of this problematic in the de Manian text, which, as Hertz suggests and as I remark in passing near the end of the present essay, may be examinedfrom the perspective of the discourse of the sublime. A useful exchange between de Man and Hertz on the temptations of the sublime and the "inhuman" may befound in RT 95-97. See also Krueger and Mizumurafor excellent discussions of what Norris calls de Man's "self-denying style." diacritics / summer 1989 49</page><page sequence="16">but necessarily, the allegory deploys an "ethical language of persuasion... upon a world that it no longer considers structured like a linguistic system but consists of a system of needs" [AR 209, de Man's emphasis]. Practical suggestions can be shrewd or, like Rousseau's boring digressions, banal, and often enough are the latter ("silliness being deeply associated with reference" [AR 209]), but the important point is that they "have to be uttered, despite the structural discrepancy between their intellectual simplicity and the complexity of the considerations on which they are predicated" [AR 207, de Man's emphasis]. Theory, in other words, manifests itself as an ethical and practical interven- tion.'4 J. Hillis Miller emphasizes this pragmatic dimension of de Man's work in The Ethics of Reading, and his forceful assertion that under the terms of de Manian theory readers "must take responsibility for [their readings] and for [the] consequences [of their readings] in the personal, social, and political world" [59] comes as a welcome clarifica- tion in the wake of countless misrepresentations of de Man's work as nihilistic or paralyzing. Miller is careful to note that, for de Man, ethical necessity is "linguistic rather than subjective" [49], having nothing in essence to do with "subjectivity, or with freedom as a feature of selfhood, or with interpersonal relations, or with a categorical imperative coming from some transcendent source" [46]. But Miller's real interest lies in what he sees as the humanist consequences of these meditations, their import for "the real situation of a man or woman reading a book, teaching a class, writing a critical essay" [4]. And it is precisely here that one must remark Miller's resistance to the theory he so admirably controls: the very gesture that lends his text strength also constitutes its greatest weakness. In correctly delineating the practical imperative of de Manian thought, Miller, like Norris, aestheticizes de Man's text-though under the terms of this practical, moralizing imperative one must hasten to distinguish Miller's reading from Norris's: unlike Norris, Miller has read de Man with exemplary patience and care, and when he refers to or summarizes de Man's work he does so accurately. His resistance to theory is thus all the less easy to naturalize into "lapses of attention" or into that "mere inability to read" [Norris 105] that we think we so easily understand. Naturalization, however, describes the trajectory of Miller's interpretations, which in general pursue a curious pattern of incorporation and disavowal. Though his overtly expository remarks about de Man's text are in no way open to reproach, strange things will happen as quotation and commentary recede in the paragraph, and the explication acquires momentum and mass. The adjective "human" will begin to insist saliently, rather like the pastoral language of"Lycidas" creeping back once "the dread voice is past." For no particular reason except that the topic is ethics, we hear of "the human world" [53]; "human existence" [57]; "human life generally" [58]. In the wake of the paragraph in which Miller recalls that "ethicity" has nothing fundamentally to do with "subjectivity, or with freedom as a feature of selfhood, or with interpersonal relations," he answers the question "What is ethics?" with the claim that "ethical judgment and command is a necessary feature of human language. We cannot help making judgments of right and wrong .. ." [46, my emphasis]. A few pages later we are told outright that "[e]thicity is a region of human life" [51]. 14. A morepopularformulation ofthispointwould take theform of the assertion that discourse is "always political"-which indeed it is, but not because intentionality or context grounds language. In his "Afterword" to the recent re-edition of Limited Inc, Jacques Derrida comments lucidly on the misconception that deconstructive narrative suspends judgment: "the value of truth [and all those values associated with it] is never contested or destroyed in my writings, but only reinscribed in more powerful, larger, more stratified contexts." Thus "it should be possible to invoke rules of competence, criteria of discussion and of consensus, good faith, lucidity, rigor, criticism, and pedagogy" [Limited 146]. On the ethics and politics of deconstruction, see also Readings. 50</page><page sequence="17">In themselves, these formulations are not inevitably misleading or precritical. De Manian theory has narrated the production of the "true," the "ethical," the "human," etc. out of a linguistic complication and has established the necessity, as well as the aberrancy, of epistemological and ethical judgment. In this sense one is fully justified in speaking of a certain de Manian humanism. Language is not exhausted by the thought of the human, but as we have seen-and despite widespread opinion to the contrary-de Man never valorizes the "inhumanness" of language. No doubt his text participates, inevitably and knowingly, but no less aberrantly for all that, in a rhetoric of the sublime that reaps pleasure from the specter of inhumanness. Like Rousseau, de Man may be caught "lingering" over "the description of the machine that seduces him into dangerously close contact" [AR 298], thereby causing the prosaic non-humanness of language to acquire the Gothic proportions of an inhuman (or "machinelike," etc.) instance. Such pathos, as mentioned earlier, is an inevitable by-product of the critique of pathos. But to valorize this pathos-to grant it the monumentality of an ethos-is the very mistake made by aesthetic humanism. Parodying de Man's famous redefinition of "mouring" at the end of "Anthropomorphism and Trope," one might say that true "humanism" is less deluded: the most it can do is to unfold as an unrelenting critique of the grounds of its own possibility and being: "To the extent that [Benjamin's] text is human, all too human in the appeal it makes to you, and its messianic overtones to name something which is essentially non-human, it displaces our sense of what is human, both in ourselves and in our relation to other humans" [RT 96]. Closing a shrewd and unsentimental discussion of ethics in de Man, S. Heidi Krueger cites this passage and remarks that "despite the current tendency to polarize deconstruction and humanism, the rejection of pathos in passages like these is still being made on essentially human, and humanist, grounds" [310-11]. Only the word "essentially" risks rendering imprecise this admirable formu- lation. In de Man, the ethical is simultaneously necessary and impossible, since, like the "human" itself, it is "rooted in the quicksands" of language [AR 170]. And Miller's recourse to the "human" obeys the Schillerian trajectory that we discovered in Norris. Language is figured as a property of the human, rather than vice versa; and this reversal serves the purpose of foreclosing the material and performative dimensions of language. For de Man, the tropological or cognitive aspect of language, when pushed to the limit, reveals its inadequacy and forces a shift to a notion of language as performance. In Miller's The Ethics ofReading, language as trope reveals the space of human freedom. Linguistic undecidability becomes "a secret equivalent... which might be defined by saying that any number multiplied by zero is zero, any number divided by zero is infinity" [78]. This "groundlessness" is thus the stable, generative groundlessness of integral calculus: of a "zero base" in which "extremes meet in their common baselessness" [79]. Miller's zero is exactly what the "zero" of de Man's "Pascal's Allegory of Persuasion" is not: a figure of totalizing negativity.5 And what Miller then calls the "performative" in The Ethics of Reading turns out to be the imposition of qualitative, ethical value by the ethical subject upon its own essential negativity: "like a plus or minus sign before a zero," where the plus sign, for all its mathematical inefficacity, "makes all the difference" [79]. The performative becomes indistinguishable from subjectivity as a capable fiction of qualitative power. And this is as much as to say that Miller has banished the performative into "the affective area of perlocution," emptying rhetoric of its "epistemological impact" [RT 18]. Miller, in short, covertly rescues epistemology from rhetoric, which then allows him to resuscitate a classical ethical subject. He will be able to shuttle between de Manian propositions and a Schillerian world of pragmatism and "spiritual power" [116] because he has, against the grain of his own knowledge, produced an ideological notion of 15. For a discussion of the critical significance of de Man's "zero," see Warminski. diacritics / summer 1989 51</page><page sequence="18">tivity are "functions of the text," and then in (literally) the next sentence praise criticism as "life-giving, productive, inaugural" [120] because the text has been given a human face: language has assumed the comfort of a house made for, and by, man. Obviously under these circumstances it makes very little difference whether or not we are "functions of the text." The result is a universe saturated by the binary oppositions of trope, where reading is an empirical, phenomenal activity. We are repeatedly directed toward a"real situation" where the text is reified into the book, "reading" into the reader, and the reader into the ground of all "historical, economic, and political 'contexts,"' which "begin with and return to the man or woman face to face with the words on the page" [4]. At once hyperbolically empirical and ideal, this claim summarizes the resistance to reading that inhabits Miller's text. Miller does not forget to ask us to read the trace of the forgotten prosopopeia ["face to face"] that underwrites the phenomenality of reading. But in his haste to produce a "real situation," he runs the danger of transforming de Manian theory into the pragmatic idealism that de Man's work so urgently resists. The paradoxical result of humanizing de Man is that one risks losing sight of the "humanist" element that de Man's texts do in fact provide. Norris, all too eager for aesthetic consolations, is unable to render the genuine political urgency of de Man's work. And Miller, out of what might be called a certain misplaced humanist generosity, risks the dissolution of the categorical imperative upon which his project depends. There is no intrinsic reason why a plus or a minus must be appended to a zero. The must belongs to language, which is why de Man's work is not just more bleak and more extravagant but also more ethical than any pragmatism. Language-and one should never forget the uncontrollable figurativeness of this term, signifying as it does "a structure of relation- ships capable of error" [AR 234]-is "non-human" in its potential randomness, its final, formal indifference to our mortality or desire. But since, by the same token, we must consider ourselves its "product" [RR 122], the impossible imperative of language reasserts itself at all levels of the system. The ethical can never be determinately ethical but must nonetheless pursue its course. What we call consciousness, or, in an analogous register, thematic comprehension or misunderstanding, is a restatement of this linguistic predicament. These two studies of Paul de Man, in other words, are not any less responsible for their error because it happens to be in origin that of reading. WORKS CITED Adorno, Theodor W. Aesthetic Theory.
