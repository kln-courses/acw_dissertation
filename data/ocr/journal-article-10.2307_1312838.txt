<plain_text><page sequence="1">so often true of the converted she is now an enthusiastic admirer of what others might find threatening and strange. Angier now writes about cockroaches and their spiritual kin- "the golems and creeps and ogres of the world...the bloodsuckers, the lowlifes, and the brutes." However, in the interests of equal time, she exposes the beastliness of the seem- ingly beautiful-"the sins of the anointed saints, the Jekylls beneath the hides," the unseemly behavior of some of nature's most endearing creatures. Thus, she exposes cheat- ing chickadees, lazy bees, un-Flip- per-like dolphins cavorting like "sailors at Tailhook," and a variety of other stereotype-busting crea- tures. The essays are organized into seven sections-Loving (insights into sex and reproduction), Dancing (es- says about molecular processes), Slithering (the facts on ostensibly noisome creatures), Adapting (be- havioral biology and conservation issues), Healing (matters relating to human physiology), Creating (biog- raphies of scientists and artists), and Dying (the end of life, as it affects cells, tissues, organs, and close rela- tives). In general, the groupings are logical, and essays within each sec- tion complement each other nicely. Angier's writing is enormously entertaining; she makes no apolo- gies for anthropomorphism and uses analogies, stories, figures of speech, and wonderful word play to explain a breathtaking range of phenom- ena. She has a gift for finding the exact turn of phrase to convey a complex idea-her gorgeous analo- gies instantly clarify and illuminate at the same time as they entertain. The collection has just the right touch of humor-I laughed out loud in places (a healthy reaction; as An- gier points out on page 196, "sus- tained hilarity is among the more agreeable forms of aerobics"). For example, in describing the structure of a cell, Angier marvels how effi- ciently three-foot-long strands of DNA are packed into a space only a hundred-thousandth of an inch across-"too tiny to qualify even as a Manhattan closet" (p. 60). Refer- ences to popular culture abound- scorpions are so nasty, for example, they "make the Borgias look like the Brady Brunch." Scientists in all disciplines can learn from this book; I was fasci- nated in particular to discover the etymological origins of many of the terms that are the stock in trade of molecular biologists (the myc gene, which encodes a protein that is criti- cal in determining cell fate, comes from myeloma in chickens; its part- ner gene, max, owes its name to its alliterative attractiveness and not to its experimental origin). In fact, Angier's journalistic gifts are show- cased to greatest effect when they are applied to the generally inacces- sible arena of molecular biology. Never has this field had such an engaging expositor; remarkably, she is also fluent in the language of ecology and evolutionary biology (more often the subject of popular science books). If there is any cause for a carp (more of a minnow, actu- ally), it is that, in many cases, not enough information is provided to allow a curious reader access to the primary literature. Even a short bib- liography would have been invalu- able. Although the writing in this book is excellent throughout, it is most effective, and most affecting, when it is at its most personal. The unex- pected death of a friend from undi- agnosed AIDS, and Angier's grand- mother's slow and terrifying decline into senility, are more than just fram- ing devices for essays about disease and death-they are in themselves deeply moving and profoundly memorable stories. That is a good thing in a book of essays about biol- ogy. After all, biology is one field of science that is universally acknowl- edged to be most directly relevant to people's everyday lives-it is liter- ally the "science of life." Animal mating behavior is fascinating be- cause of the insights it offers into our own romantic habits; pro- grammed cell death in the thoracic muscles of a hornworm moth is of interest because it is eerily similar to the death of cells in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. Angier convincingly and unapolo- getically argues for the merits of anthropomorphism and even in- cludes an essay on an ongoing dis- cussion of its merits in scientific circles. Although there is certainly a need among people to feel special- after all, the notion that the earth is ours is peculiarly human-this per- spective serves to highlight the com- monalities among species, "what we share with the other inhabitants of the planet." Understanding these commonalities is the surest and fast- est route to understanding these (other) inhabitants as well as re- specting and appreciating them- even if they happen to have a few more legs than would seem digni- fied.

William K. Smith and Tho- mas M. Hinckley, eds. Academic Press, San Diego, CA, 1995. 396 pp., illus. $74.95 (ISBN 0-12- 652870-5 cloth). As the world's oldest (up to 5000 years for bristlecone pine) and larg- est (up to 300-feet tall) living things, conifers are unique objects for bio- logical studies. Their enormous im- portance lies not only in providing useful wood products, but also in maintaining biodiversity and sus- tainability of forest ecosystems. The nine chapters in this book clearly lay out the differences be- tween conifers and broadleaved trees. The basic rationale for this book is that, because conifer forests differ from broadleaf deciduous for- ests in leaf, canopy, and structural characteristics (e.g., leaf longevity, leaf litterfall, nitrogen content, rate of litter decomposition, soil nitro- gen availability, and nitrogen up- take rate), the methodologies devel- oped for studying the ecophysiology of broadleaved trees often are un- suitable for conifers. Several unique features influence the capacity of conifers to harvest light: a deep canopy and small needles, creating a penumbral ef- fect, and the clustering of needles, which creates a discontinuous dis- tribution of needle area. Hence, at a BioScience Vol. 46 No. 4 298</page><page sequence="2">fixed leaf area index (the ratio of projected leaf area surface of a plant or stand to ground surface area), less radiation is intercepted in conif- erous than in broadleaved canopies. However, the vertical gradient of light in conifers is less steep, and the light reaching the lower canopy is diffuse. Furthermore, the light gra- dient within a coniferous shoot may be as large as within a whole canopy (chapter 1). The book contains a wealth of quantitative information on the physiological attributes of conifers. Approximately one-third of the book is devoted to acquisition of resources (carbohydrates, minerals, water, and hormones) and two-thirds to their allocation and utilization. Several unique features influence the water relations of conifers. Al- though conifer tracheids are rela- tively inefficient in water transport, they allow for water storage and resistance to freeze-induced embo- lism. Whereas transpiration of coni- fer stands is controlled largely by stomatal conductance, in dense canopies of broadleaved trees (espe- cially in tropical forests with little air mixing) transpiration is regu- lated by radiation rather than by stomatal conductance. Transpira- tion rates of conifer foliage often are lower than those of broadleaved trees, probably because of the lower capacity of tracheids than vessels to transport water. There are also physiological varia- tions among species of conifers (chapter 6). For example, in areas with low mean annual temperatures, growth rates and photosynthesis tend to be independent. By compari- son, in warmer regions photosyn- thesis of conifers tends to be high in the spring, when the requirement for carbohydrates for growth is high. R. D. Yanai and colleagues (chap- ter 3) relate root longevity to nutri- ent uptake and water uptake, and discuss the efficiency of mycorrhizal fungi in nutrient uptake. A solute uptake model is used together with calculated carbon costs to evaluate the efficiency of carbon expendi- tures in acquiring soil nutrients. The authors admit that the usefulness of their steady-state model is limited because it does not account for spa- tial heterogeneity and temporal variations in root and soil proper- ties, including aging of roots and patchiness of soil fertility. D. W. Sheriff and colleagues (chapter 5) point out the complexity of mineral uptake by conifers: the supply of some nutrients affects the capacity of plants to absorb others, both by changing the availability of other elements in the soil and by various interactions during uptake. Absorption of one mineral element may influence acquisition of others by regulating growth; allocation of photosynthate to roots; root perme- ability, morphology, and distribu- tion; and association with mycor- rhizae. Integrative process models of pho- tosynthesis are preferred by R. O. Teskey and colleagues (chapter 4) because measurement techniques provide only limited information on temporal and spatial variability in trees or forests. The major advan- tages of process modeling are its potential for increasing understand- ing of the mechanisms that regulate tree growth and its potential for prediction. Unfortunately, the value of process modeling is constrained by an incomplete understanding of the processes involved, interactions of environmental stresses, control of carbohydrate allocation, the role of regulation of photosynthesis by source-sink relations and hormonal signals, inadequate sampling, and extrapolation of data across the size and age of trees. R. J. Luxmoore and colleagues (chapter 6) expertly address feed- back regulation of photosynthesis. Feedback effects of sink activity oc- cur over several scales, some within the leaf, others through sink activity at distant growth centers. Feedback regulation within a leaf may be at- tributed to depletion of the mineral phosphate supply, deactivation of Rubisco (the carboxylating enzyme in photosynthesis), sucrose accumu- lation, and/or a decrease in the rate of phloem loading. S. T. Gower and colleagues con- tribute a splendid chapter on alloca- tion and accumulation of carbohy- drates in conifers (chapter 7). They quantify allocation of carbohydrates to foliage, branches, stems, roots, and cones, as well as to respiration, defense, leaching, and exudation. They give examples of nonlinear re- sponses of physiological processes controlling carbohydrate budgets because of multiple resource limita- tions (e.g., minerals and water, air pollutants and nutrients, carbon di- oxide and temperature). The authors advocate the use of controlled envi- ronment facilities for evaluating environmental interactions on re- sponses of seedlings and the use of physiological process models, to- gether with field research, for un- derstanding carbohydrate allocation in large trees. Methods of scaling respiration to the stand level that do not rely on extrapolation from small-scale samples were not available until re- cently (D. G. Sprugel and colleagues, chapter 8). Unfortunately, there is a real problem in identifying an index that is easily measured on both large and small scales and is closely tied to respiration of some important stand component. Some promising methods are outlined for estimating instantaneous fluxes and annual car- bon dioxide budgets from respira- tion for entire ecosystems. Proxy measurements (e.g., litterfall and nitrogen concentration) can be used to estimate respiration of whole stands. However, such techniques require more testing before they are likely to be acceptable. Chapter 9, on water transport dynamics of coniferous trees and stands, is the most informative. Its 88 pages and 410 literature cita- tions address the most relevant as- pects of the water relations of coni- fers, including water absorption mechanisms, internal transport and storage of water (tracheid charac- teristics, cavitation, capacitance, conducting efficiency, and water stress problems), transpiration of trees and stands, and physiological and growth responses to water defi- cits. Any investigator of plant and soil water relations would do well to read this chapter by S. G. Pal- lardy and colleagues. The thorough and expert analy- ses of the most important aspects of conifer physiology clearly establish the central message of Resource Physiology of Conifers: that with- out an understanding of the adap- tive responses of individual species of conifers, neither response capa- April 1996 299</page><page sequence="3">bilities nor impacts of environmen- tal changes at the ecosystem level can be evaluated. The writing is com- prehensive and up to date because of the combined efforts of 28 lead- ing researchers of plant ecophysiol- ogy-no chapter was written by a single author. The book is likely to be welcomed by investigators at- tempting to unravel the complexi- ties inherent in biological diversity, global warming, and responses of forest ecosystems to abiotic and bi- otic stresses.

As a fundamentally interdisciplinary field (Saffo 1992), symbiosis em- braces a complex array of some- times isolated, sometimes intercon- necting, biological specialities. It is thus a subject that is peculiarly dif- ficult to integrate, even for special- ists. Three recent books on symbio- sis address some of the historical and contemporary complexity of this field. The older historical text, Liya N. Khakina's Concepts of Symbiogen- esis, focuses on the work of four Russian botanists-A. S. Famintsyn (1835-1918), K. S. Merezhkovsky (1855-1921), A. A. Elenkin (1875-1942), and B. M. Kozo-Poly- ansky (1890-1957). By bringing the work of these Russian biologists to Western attention through the trans- lation and publication of this mono- graph, editors Lynn Margulis and Mark McMenamin have helped cor- rect our often culturally imbalanced perspective of science. Khakina presents evidence that Russian ideas on the role of symbio- sis in eukaryote evolution were de- veloped independently of, and in several cases also preceded, the per- haps more widely known work of Western biologists. For this lesson alone, Concepts of Symbiogenesis is worthwhile reading.
