<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANTS, INDIANS, AND LITTLE DINOSAURS. A Celebration of Man and Nature for the 75th Anniversary of Natural History Magazine. Selected from Natural History and edited by Alan Ternes. Published for the American Museum of Natural History by Charles Scribner's Sons, New York. $8.95. vi + 386 p.; index. 1975. This book is a selection of articles which have appeared during the 75 years of publication of the American Museum of Natural History's magazine Natural History. The editor wisely decided not to try for a complete sampling of the magazine's diversity, but restricted himself to the general topic of "man and nature". To me the most appealing articles, perhaps because they were less tied to particular falsifiable theories or supersedible observations, were those which were basically personal documents and which presented natural historians doing things not necessarily includ- ed in the "John Wesley Powell down the Colorado" stereotype. Outstanding among these were Beck's account of observing stray dogs in downtown Balti- more; Archie Carr recording what he learned about Costa Rican folklore and the defensive behavior of vipers on the occasion of being unfatally bitten by a fer-de-lance; Simpson living in an antebellum man- sion while digging Pleistocene peccary bones out of a cave once used to store the products of a St. Louis brewery; von Koenigswald finding the bones of "Java Man" and bringing them safely through World War II and a Philadelphia picket line; Bohannan and Lee encountering parallel enlightening failures in at- tempting to transmit Hamlet and Christmas gift-giving customs to groups of African tribesmen; Momaday, with his father and his daughters, passing comfortably from the world of freeways and airports to that of the Kiowa Gourd Dance. Also enjoyable were several articles recounting observations on the behavior of individual animal species-especially Dobie on the coyote, Tinbergen on the herring gull, and Schaller on the cheetah. Nearly all the good articles are in the first three- fourths of the book. There are interspersed a few potboilers, evidently added in most cases to justify putting a certain author's name in the dust jacket design, but these are generally mercifully brief. The fourth and final, or Ecological Doomsday, section of the book does not measure up to the standards of the rest. A shrill preachiness descends and facile ironies about ecologists encased in the plastic world of airplanes replace the personal tone and the sense of unsentimental humor which pervaded the earlier sections. (Galston's report on life in a Chinese com- mune could have been an exception, but the author is so smug about his accomplishments and so deter- mined to make the good outweigh the bad in China- would you believe the trains run on time ?-that the intrinsic interest of his topic is vitiated.) Brown and Wray's proposed solution to the population problem, albeit doubtless an oversimplification, stands out somewhat in this group of articles if only because it is a bit less trite than the oversimplifications in the others, and because it appears to have been based in personal experience with particular individuals than in diffuse concern with humanity in general. Thomas's article on symbiosis in the sea could have been quite good if an anthropomorphic moralizing which would have probably embarrassed Beatrix Potter had been excluded. The last two articles, the obligatory celebrations of human diversity (by Ken- neth Watt and Marston Bates) are about as bad as such things usually are. What is particularly unfortu-</page><page sequence="2">102 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY [VOLUME 51 nate is that their inclusion, which ends the book on a sloppy Moral Rearmament tone, was unnecessary. If a point needed to be made about the value of diversity, the existence of the good articles in this book would have sufficed. SARA S.
