WALLACE ABSTRACT An unusual cache of unfired-clay basketry effigies and human figurines was uncovered by a windstorm near Stovepipe Wells in Death Valley National Monument. These specimens and others from nearby archaeological sites demonstrate a more extensive use of sun-dried arti- cles in the Death Valley region than hitherto suspected. The unbaked-clay industry appears to come into the area by way of the Great Basin extension of Anasazi culture around A.D. 900-1100 and to have persisted into the second half of the 19th century. A FEW YEARS ago an exceptionally violent windstorm brought to view near Stovepipe Wells in Death Valley National Monument, California, a remarkable group of unfired, min- iature clay vessels and figurines. The articles were discovered high up on a sand dune (Fig. 1) by a nine-year-old boy, who had the un- common good sense not to touch or to pick up any of the uncovered items. Instead, he re- ported his find to Monument personnel, who guarded the objects until a field party from the University of Southern California, which was excavating an archaeological site elsewhere in Death Valley, could be summoned to remove them. Originally the clay articles must have been only a few inches below the surface. Their preservation can be attributed to the general dryness and good drainage provided by the loose surrounding sand. But it is remarkable that such fragile artifacts could have escaped destruction because the find-spot, located only a few hun- dred yards from a well-traveled road, is tramped over by hundreds of Monument visitors each year. Concentrated in an area measuring only 12 by 12 in., some of the vessels had been placed inside one another (Fig. 2). The figurines lay nearby. Sand in the immediate vicinity of the exposed items was thoroughly examined by being troweled and then passed through a small- mesh hand screen. This work revealed that nearly the complete contents of the cache had been exposed by the wind. The only additional clay objects that turned up consisted of two com- pletely crushed vessels. These lay 18 in. south of the original finds and 3 in. below ground level. A few glass and shell beads comprised the only other archaeological materials unearthed in the immediate vicinity. However, abundant camp debris littered the ground at the edge of the dune about 75 ft. away. The delicate clay specimens, most already in a broken condition, were removed with extreme care and buried in a sand-filled wooden box to protect them during transit to the University of Southern California Anthropology Laboratory. This precaution resulted in their arriving at the Laboratory in reasonably good condition. It proved possible to restore some of the fragments of vessels and figurines to their proper position. Finding the articles in a restricted area, with no less than 30 to 35 specimens massed together, suggests that they had been made here and then buried. It is well within reason to assume that their maker.had intended to pick them up later but for some reason never did. The hiding away for safety of objects at or near the top of sand dunes seems to have been a well-established and long-standing custom among the aboriginal in- habitants of Death Valley. Of course, the whole collection might have been deliberately placed at the spot as a votive offering. The clay used in the manufacture of the ob- jects is of a better quality than that regularly utilized by the local Indians in making earthen- ware cooking pots. A finer material may have been selected because large particles would have been a hindrance in modeling such small-sized articles. Apparently no tempering has been added to the paste, though it contains a natural admixture of extremely fine-grained sand, as well as a few tiny flecks of mica. The clay has a tannish-buff color, similar to that of dried mud in nearby washes. Though none of the articles has been fired, at least two show slight discolor- ation from exposure to fire or smoke. Perhaps they had been placed close to an open campfire while drying. CLAY VESSELS Clay vessels in the cache obviously represent attempts to duplicate or copy closely the form and ornamentation of baskets. The basketry effigies fall into three classes: (1) Most numerous are replicas of conical burden baskets with broad flaring tops and 434</page><page sequence="2">CACHE FROM DEATH VALLEY, CALIFORNIA FIG. 1. Locality in Death Valley National Monument where cache of unfired clay objects was found. nearly pointed bases. They have been built up by a spiral coiling process, and the coils are still visible on the exterior and interior surfaces of some specimens. The largest effigy stands 7.8 cm. high and has a top diameter of 11 cm. Its walls consist of flattened coils, each 7 mm. wide and clearly discernible (Fig. 3). The walls are quite thin, averaging 5.5 mm. in thickness. A painted black band, into which have been cut with some sharp instrument two zigzag lines, runs around the vessel 7 mm. below the lip. Approximately 1.5 mm. below this is another incised zigzag filled with black pigment. A row of short vertical lines, pressed into the clay while it was still plastic, ornaments the inside border of the specimen. Constructed in precisely the same manner is a second miniature burden basket (Fig. 4). Decoration on this specimen consists of two horizontal black stripes. Into the first has been cut a row of short slanting lines; the other bears a zigzag. Smaller than the first, this basketry copy has a height of 7.3 cm. and a top diameter of 9.3 cm. Its walls are 6 mm. thick. A third specimen, which may have been in an unfinished state when stored away, lacks any form of design. It is 6.9 cm. high, measures 6.7 cm. across at the top, and has a wall thickness of 5 mm. The bases and body fragments of at least five additional copies of carrying baskets were recovered. Many of the latter bear painted and grooved markings. One piece has been pierced, presumably to provide a hole for the insertion of a miniature tumpline. (2) A second group consists of specimens that take the form of shallow, traylike winnow- ing baskets. Each has been fabricated by adding two coils of clay to a slightly concave, oval piece that forms the bottom. The first representation measures 8.3 by 6.7 cm. and is 1.7 cm. deep (Fig. 5 a). Both of its carefully smoothed sur- faces have been decorated. The interior bears three concentric black bands with a zigzag in- cised into the center of each. Three black stripes have been painted on the underside. Two of these have slanting lines cut into them; the other is marked with a zigzag. The second miniature winnowing basket is smaller, with dimensions of 6.5 by 5.5 cm. and a depth of 1.0 cm. (Fig. 5 b). Like the other, it is ornamented inside and out. Three solid, black bands containing slanting incisions cross its con- cavity. On the reverse surface are four rows of irregularly spaced splotches of black paint. A section of another (Fig. 5 c) shows two black bands with zigzags on each side. Its exterior bor- der has been ornamented with tiny incisions. Two plain oval specimens, one a fragment, prob- ably represent unfinished effigies. Also in the collection are two oval bases. (3) Two bowl-shaped basketry representa- tions exhibit a diversity in form. Like the other copies, they have been constructed by coiling. The best preserved bowl has a rounded, nearly conical base and sides which flare out (Fig. 6). Three coils remain visible on the upper part of the vessel, and around its outer surface, just be- low the lip, runs a wavy black line. The speci- men stands 2.7 cm. high and has a maximum diameter of 5 cm. Its walls average 6 mm. in thickness. FIG. 2. Unfired clay vessels exposed. WALLACE ] 435</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY FIG. 3. Clay replica of burden basket. Height 7.8 cm. A smaller bowl, devoid of decoration, seems not to have been completed. Its base consists of a flattened disc to which five rows of coiling have been added. The coils are still evident on the vessel's interior, but its outer surface has been carefully smoothed. It has a height of 2.9 cm., a diameter of 4.2 cm., and walls which are 6 mm. thick. No certain knowledge of the use or purpose of the little clay copies of baskets exists. Ob- viously, they are too small and much too deli- cate to have served any utilitarian purpose. Likewise, the clay baskets can hardly have been toys, since they would have been at best fragile and easily broken playthings. The artifacts, rep- licas of equipment essential for the gathering and preparing of wild seeds for food, could represent offerings for or symbols of a plenteous harvest. That they are ritual objects seems an unavoidable conclusion. Additional basketry effigies or parts thereof have been found in Death Valley. Tiny, sun- dried sherds collected from the surface of two campsites just north of Stovepipe Wells pre- sumably are parts of basket models. Two coni- cal pieces, both fired, from the same general area appear to be bases of burden baskets. An intact, unbaked carrying basket, smaller in size than those contained in the Stovepipe Wells cache, came from an encampment on the Furnace Creek fan at the eastern edge of Death Valley (Hunt 1960: 226, Fig. 58 c). The Furnace Creek district also yielded another effigy and a coiled, cone-shaped object which also may be a basketry model (Hunt 1960, Fig. 58 d, e). So far as is known, the Death Valley speci- mens represent the only examples of their kind found in California. Though they cannot be exactly matched, the miniature clay copies are not without parallels elsewhere. Tiny basketry replicas of unburned earthenware occur among Basketmaker III remains in the Southwest (Mor- ris and Burgh 1941: 54). The making of similar models in fired form continued until Pueblo III times (Byers and Morss 1957: 82). Representa- tives of this kind also have been discovered in the Great Basin, and examples are reported from Lost City (Harrington 1937: 138) and Etna Cave in Nevada (Wheeler 1942, Fig. 34 g) and from Utah (Steward 1936, Fig. 8 g). HUMAN FIGURINES It is not possible to compute accurately the total number of human figurines in the Stove- pipe Wells cache because nearly every one has been broken and some have been too badly fragmented to be reconstructed. A conservative guess would be that they amount in all to at least a dozen separate specimens. As a group, the figurines share certain features. All are solid, hand-modeled images, regularly fashioned from a single piece of clay. The basic body shape consists of an elongated cylinder, flattish in cross section, which tapers to a narrow wedge-shaped base at one end. The opposite extremity has FIG. 4.

Length of a, 8.3 cm. been modeled into a head. It seems possible that the heads of one or two may have been molded separately and then attached to the torsos. The front of each figure has been well smoothed, the back less thoroughly. Clearly their maker did not strive for a lifelike representation but fol- lowed a rigid, highly stylized tradition, because all specimens are extremely schematic and de- void of detail. Limbs have been entirely dis- pensed with; facial features - eyes, ears, nose, and mouth - as well as other anatomical char- acteristics are only rarely indicated; and no direct or indirect evidence of clothing exists on any of the images. Decoration, which occurs only rarely, consists of punctates or short incised strokes. Two styles of figurines can be distin- guished: Style 1. Each of the four images in this cate- gory has a flat-ridged or arched head, formed by pinching upward at right angles to the torso a portion of the body mass. Viewed from the side, this gives an aquiline, almost birdlike pro- file. The head is not marked off from the torso by a neck but extends down to the sloping shoulders. One has eyes indicated by slits, but other than these, no physiognomic details are apparent. The upper border of the simplified head on two specimens has been adorned with numerous slanting lines (Fig. 7 a, b). A similar row runs across the face of one of these. Addi- tional ornamentation on three effigies takes the form of a double row of punctations arranged in a V that extends from the shoulders to the chest (Fig. 7 a, c, d). Evidently these marks depict bead necklaces. Since they lack breasts or other distinguishing sex characteristics, no clue exists as to whether the images have been intended to portray males or females. They are well- matched in size. Lengths range from 8.3 to 9.1 cm. Greatest width is regularly 1.4 cm., and they vary in thickness from 1 to 1.1 cm. Style 2. The second group of statuettes is dis- tinguished by a head that expands upward to produce a hoodlike effect with a broad, flat top. On the first example (Fig. 7 e), complete ex- cept for its base, the head is marked off from FIG. 6. Clay replica of bowl-shaped basket. Height 2.7 cm.

Facial features have been entirely dispensed with, but this image, unlike the rest, bears sex characteristics. Two tiny breasts, formed by pinching up the clay or by binding bits of it to the torso, identify it as a female. Another pellet of clay farther down the body suggests a navel. A carelessly executed row of punctures crosses the facial region, per- haps indicating facial painting or tattooing. Tiny pits also encircle the left breast. The underside of the head is lightly incised. Since the base is broken, an accurate length measurement cannot be given, but it must have been about 8.5 cm. Its greatest breadth (just below the shoulders) is 1.8 cm. The torso has a maximum thickness slightly in excess of 1.5 cm. A second faceless example, represented by the head and upper- sholder region, must have been much like the above. It has suffered considerably from weath- ering. Twenty-two fragments, none of which fit to- gether, are all that remain of other figurines. Since they consist of headless torsos and termini, they cannot be classified. One torso bears a double row of punctates. Archaeologists hold differing views about the meaning of little clay images of this sort. Most commonly such images have been interpreted as connoting fertility and forming part of a set of ideas associated with increase rites. It has also been suggested that some may have been fash- ioned with intent to commit black magic (Mor- ris 1951: 33; True 1957: 296). The representa- tions are so highly standardized and so unrealis- tic that they do give a definite impression of cult objects to be held in special reverence. They have also been regarded as nothing more than children's toys. Ethnographic evidence demon- strates that several Great Basin Shoshonean peoples made unbaked human and animal fig- ures with straw legs for this purpose (Steward 1941: 242). Death Valley has yielded a reasonably large number of other human figurines. Six torso fragments and a base have been collected from 438 [ VOL. 30, No. 4, 1965</page><page sequence="6">CACHE FROM DEATH VALLEY, CALIFORNIA archaeological sites in Mesquite Flat north of Stovepipe Wells. One of the torsos has been fired or partially fired. Two incised pieces of unbaked clay from the same locality may also represent parts of anthropomorphic images. A series of whole and partial specimens has been recovered farther south in the Furnace Creek district (Hunt 1960: 229-32), and an intact example was unearthed during the excavation of a rock shelter in the Panamint Range to the west of Death Valley (Wallace 1957). Un- doubtedly, many more of these soft and friable figures have perished. Conventionalized clay statuettes in a very similar style occur in the Anasazi section of the Southwest. Here the making of sun-dried human effigies may have begun during Basket- maker II times (Morss 1954: 10), and they formed an integral part of the succeeding Basket- maker III culture (Morris 1951: 39). The fash- ioning of clay figurines, baked and unbaked, be- came well-established in the Pueblo-influenced sections of the Great Basin, where they con- tinued to be manufactured into the Pueblo II and III periods, long after they had disappeared in the central Anasazi region. Various localities in Utah have produced examples (Steward 1936: 22-9, Figs. 8-10; Morss 1954: 4-7, 12-26). Several crudely modeled pieces of unfired clay obtained in the later deposits of Danger Cave may also represent anthropomorphic effigies (Jennings 1957: 207-08). In southern Nevada, figurines have been reported from Lost City (Harrington 1937: 138; Shutler 1961: 41) and Mesa House (Hayden 1930: 81). Examples have also come from the Karlo site in the Great Basin part of northern California, a location well outside the sphere of direct Pueblo influ- ence (Riddell 1960: 58-61). The Karlo speci- mens may antedate considerably any of the Ana- sazi effigies. It can be supposed that many more figurines will be unearthed in the Great Basin as a result of the active and systematic work now taking place. Human figurines following a somewhat simi- lar line of schematic representation have a wide though scattered distribution in California. The number of reported finds has increased marked- ly in recent years, and examples are now known from the central, northwestern, and southern parts of the state (Elsasser 1963; Heizer and Beardsley 1943; Heizer and Pendergast 1955; Pendergast 1957; Davis 1959; McCown 1955: 39; True 1957; Wallace and Taylor 1960: 15, Fig. 4). The California effigies, which are regu- larly fired, by no means form a homogeneous group, though all bear some "family resem- blances" to one another. They appear to cover a wide temporal span. Some effigies go well back into the prehistoric past and others date from recent times. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS The Stovepipe Wells cache, along with clay objects from other archaeological sites in Death Valley, offers evidence of an interesting plastic art and demonstrates a more extensive use of sun-dried clay articles in this region than previ- ously suspected. It now remains to determine the place of origin and age of the unbaked clay industry. The toy-sized copies of baskets and the figurines bear a striking resemblance to simi- lar objects made during Basketmaker III times in the Southwest and in later times on the Pueb- loan fringe. These resemblances, as well as the direct association of the two classes of articles, strongly imply that the original inspiration for modeling sun-dried items reached Death Valley through the western extension of Anasazi cul- ture into the Great Basin. Though the source of the industry can be determined with some certainty, it is not so easy to establish the time of its first entrance into Death Valley. Knowledge of the making of sun-dried effigies may have reached the region as early as A.D. 900-1100, since some of the speci- mens have been recovered from campsites that produced cultural materials assignable to this time span as well as later types of artifacts. Southwestern sherds, painted and corrugated, found at various localities in Death Valley, pro- vide convincing proof of contacts with Pueblo peoples during this period. If its beginnings stretch back to A.D. 900-1100, clay modeling has had a long history in Death Valley, since there is good archaeological evi- dence which shows that the practice continued into very recent times. The Stovepipe Wells cache site yielded potsherds, projectile points, and other artifacts typical of the last (Death Valley IV or Shoshonean) period of aboriginal occupation. Commercially manufactured arti- cles, such as glass beads and bits of rusted metal, indicate that the encampment has seen habita- tion in historic (post-1850) times. A glass bead was found lying inside one of the clay vessels and others were obtained nearby. Several adja- WALLACE ] 439</page><page sequence="7">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY cent postcontact sites and others in the Furnace Creek district (Hunt 1960: 224) yielded sun- dried objects. The recurrent presence of trade goods with clay items argues strongly for the fabrication of the latter well into the second half of the 19th century. This survival of modeling implies considerable cultural conservatism. The final reconstruction of the history of Death Valley's unfired clay industry cannot be satisfactorily resolved until a more detailed analysis of this specialized and as yet not fully studied art is undertaken in adjoining regions. Although knowledge of the craft has increased enormously in recent years, information is still sketchy for some areas. Particularly needed are stylistic and distributional studies of speci- mens recovered from archaeological sites in Nevada. Acknowledgments. A number of persons contributed to the recovery and preservation of these interesting finds. The first acknowledgment must go to their discoverer, Rick Griffin. Thanks are also due to Fred Binnewies, former Monument superintendent, Ranger Bob Sellers, and Alice Hunt, who guarded the exposed materials. Charles B. Hunt drove many miles to bring news of the discovery to the University of Southern California field party. The latter group consisted of George Kritzman, Edith S. Taylor, and William Wallace. Laura Brown and Rosemary Ryan assisted in the exposure and removal of other artifacts from the site. George Kritzman performed the tedious task of restoring the delicate objects in the laboratory, and Edith S. Taylor took and prepared the photographs. BYERS, DOUGLAS S.
