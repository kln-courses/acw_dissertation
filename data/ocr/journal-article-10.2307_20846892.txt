<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SYSTEM OF ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY IN DETAIL (Continued from September Issue) MAX HORTEN Translated from the German by V. June Hager 2. Metaphysics The most important doctrines of this metaphysics are those concern ing being, the categories, and causes. Being is synonymous with the One; it is therefore only an adjunct to the individual. The existence of the Platonic ideas is thus excluded. Being and individuality are identical (Farabi). This being approaches and attaches to essence; for even a cur sory glance shows that both are totally different. No definite essence is contained in the concept of being, and no definite being in essence. Only in God do both coincide. Thus the things of the world are contingent; that is, they may be or they may not be, and therefore must receive their existence from an external agent, when they become real. Creation is accordingly a bestowing of being, an emanation of being from the essential and necessary Being to the possible and in itself only potentially being that is - the essences. In themselves these are potential, they receive exis tence, and thereby become real. To clarify these ideas philosophers often use the image of shadowy outlines projected upon a dark wall; these re main imperceptible until a ray of light falls upon them and renders them visible, "conferring existence on them in the optical order". But in the evolution of these concepts a serious difficulty arose. An essence in itself unreal is to become the carrier of existence, although something unreal can never be the support of what is real. This problem did not present itself to Farabi. According to him existence comes from without to the essences; technically however it is identical with individua tion, that is, with the modification of a universal to an individual thing. For Farabi individuality and existence are identical. This identity dis</page><page sequence="2">232 MAX HORTEN appears in time. In Avicenna the two are distinct. Individuality is ushered in by determining modifications, particularly matter, and these bestow existence from God. Existence thereby becomes inherent, and the bearer of this is essence. Since this interpretation was soon recognized as contradictory (SuhrawardI, Shirazi-d. 1640), imperious necessity impel led a reidentification of both. A disparity between the two leads to con tradictions; therefore they must both be identical. And thus the picture of the world changes; essences contain within them reality; they "shine forth" from God and eternity and represent the ascending ladder of world phenomena (SuhrawardI); or ? there exist only modifications of Being, pieces of this, which evolve from God, the source of all being (Shirazi). According to the first view existence is a purely logical abstraction: accord ing to the second, this is true of essence. The concepts of both views develop progressively from Greek dualism to monism. Dualism is deeply embedded in the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle (God - uncreated matter; forms - primary matter; the universals, ideas - the individual ele ment). In Neo-Platonism the first pair of opposites is reconciled: matter also proceeds (indirectly) from God. In Islam this development progresses even further, in that form and matter in their union are preceived as essence and confront individuality (FarabI) or existence (Avicenna). This now sole remaining antithesis is later eliminated by the Platonizing trend (SuhrawardI), so that step by step the world-view progresses to an ever greater uniformity. Averroes did not wish to stand in the way of this development. The critic in him suppressed the philosopher. As critic he did not re cognize in Aristotle's works the doctrines of this later philosophy. There fore as a philosopher he would not tolerate them either, although these represent a refinement of thephilosophical world-view. First, therefore, he felt obligated to reject the concept of contingency which he misunder stood, and to replace this fundamental idea with that of potency vs. act, allying himself intimately with the Stagirite: only necessary things exist and these are a necessarium a se (God) and necessaria ab alio (creatures). The concept of contingency is a contradiction, since it would also have to be a necessity (necessarium ab alio), therefore combining possibility and necessity. The problem which appears most frequently in formal discussions and which to a certain extent is most immediately apparent is that of existence and essence and of the substantial difference between them (the</page><page sequence="3">ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY 233 contingency concept is another side of this problem). The analysis of the first (essence) immediately reveals the second (existence). The conceptual analysis of anything in the created world never discovers the moment of existence as a component of being. We can probe and analyse in every detail the definition of, let us say - man; we will never find present therein the concept of existence. Both are accordingly things of different species (diverse), of different levels of being, which cannot come out of themselves into contact with one another, and which must be joined by another superior agent (proof of contingency). This dualism in levels of being first appears to us as essence and individuality and this pair proves itself identical to essence and existence. With unsurpassed skill FarabI illustrated this in the first of his "Gems of Wisdom". Things in themselves are unindivi dualized realities, of which each is a realization of a complete species - i.e. they are universal (compare Plato's ideas). This "universal" has next reduced and crystallized, forming things into a "this there" (huwiya ? "this ness"). Thereby phenomena receive their concrete form of being, whereas formerly in God's knowledge they only possessed a universal form. Things emerge from God, become realities outside of God_ clothe themselves with existence. Individuality and existence (outside God) are therefore one and the same. God's bestowal of existence is rendering things individual. In this way FarabI carried the discussion beyond Plato and articulated it in the form which was in Islam the basis for further explanations. "Concretion of ideas" becomes "bestowal of existence" upon possible, contingent essences. This metaphysical phase is confronted by the idea of a world of non-existence, of shadowy, illusory essences (traceable to Indian thought-currents already apparent in the theological schools of Basra and Baghdad around 850). Being attaches to these essences (world origin, genesis of things ? around 1010 Ahdab27 incorporated this Indian concept in its original form), and then retreats from them (world annihilation, death). These ideas, so totally different in substance, find their way in Islam to a harmonious union, so that one could be tempted, after a cursory study lacking exact idea-analysis, to mis take the Indian trend as Platonic. This is fresh proof that Islamic philo sophy is no illogical aggregation and syncretism; it must be recognized as a successful, internally uniform synthesis - reflecting its own homogeneous and original world-experience. Theologians often consider28 as a Greek doctrine the view that essences are not formed arbitrarily or artificially, but that they are necessary. This view was also called the doctrine of eternal essences, which gave</page><page sequence="4">234 MAX HORTEN rise to many misunderstandings; for according to theological terminology eternity can only be attributed to God. TusI explains to the theologians that this Greek thesis does not represent atheism,but only a conceptually logical clarification. Essences are partially real ideal forms, partially logical (conceptual forms). The second are not called forms; they are "contours" (definitions) of the real essences. Laboriously and slowly achieved comprehension must fill in the picture suggested by these contours. Therefore Avicenna's efforts are directed towards that experience which alone can provide adequate understanding of essence, experience which can fill in the lacuna of the mahiya or logical essences. The collective "natural sciences" of Avicenna prove this empirical tendency of his.29 The real universal form of the phenomenal world reaches our mind as a cognitive form; both (sura = form) are however defined by the mind in vague outlines only (mahiya = logical concept). Could we not suspect here that Avicenna had reservations about participating in the illusion of an adequate knowledge of phenomena. His metaphysical a priori theory of cognition, on the other hand, suggests an adequate knowledge of things. From this it is obvious, which questions the philosophers of this school asked of reality, what seemed to them contradictory and in need of explanation, and what was the final goal of their efforts. They were not so much seeking the infinite, (that was the mystics' idea of the ultimate goal and supreme bliss), but rather the everlasting The world appears to them ephemeral ? thus of less value, incapable of providing man with happiness ? therefore to be shunned or despised. According to this view of ultimate happiness, God is the Everlasting, (baqi). The Eternal, and the transitory, "fleeting" (fdni ? a popular description of the world) is only comprehensible, if their exists something permanent and eternal. The mystery of the world lies in its ephemerality, whereas man is seeking permanence. This mystical, world-escapist current in the philosophical stream is inherent in the underlying belief and in the heart of the world view; it shows that different trends in Islamic intellectual life are not separa ted by gaping chasms, but rather are felt to be intimately related. An essentially similar experience of the world is common to these, and this experience presents itself in different categories and forms, according to the different predominant influences. This mentality is foreign to the down to-earth character and joie de vivre of Greek thought.</page><page sequence="5">ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY 235 The basic idea of Greek (philosophical) thought is the concept of contingency. This was established by FarabI, the great intuitive genius of the school, and developed by Avicenna,the universal spirit who possessed both inductive and deductive skills. If phenomena are observed concern ing their essence it is evident that no one of them is testimony of being. This tangible man who stands before me hie et nunc is an animal rationale. He himself is no evidence that he is, or that he is not. His essence says nothing either positive or negative about his being. Thus the idea sequence of modes of being is obtained: necessity - possibility - impossibility. A thing is "necessary" when being is united with it in the conceptual deter mination (per definitionum), a thing is "impossible" when it is excluded by the conceptual determination; and something is "possible" when it is neutrally related to its conceptual determination. The last case charac terizes all world phenomena. These enter into and then depart from being, without thereby becoming inconsistent with their essence. Things become and pass away. That is a fact of the world's variability (of kaun wa'l-fasad ? becoming and passing away) which would be incom prehensible without the concept of contingency (imkari). It is the transitoriness of the world which most deeply stirs the contemplative Oriental soul; and philosophy seeks to articulate this every day experience in innumberable forms. What is ephemeral receives existence from a principle of emanation (fayd?Plotinus). since in itself and from itself it cannot by necessity possess or retain being. Existence and phenomenon are joined in a totally external and accidental relation ship, and one cannot deduce from a phenomenon that it partakes of exis tence. This analysis of the transitory nature of the phenomenal world conspicuously reveals a fact of Islamic philosophy: in this philosophy formulated proofs of God are extremely rare. We have endeavored here to throw some light on this particular philosophical attitude towards the problem of the phenomenal world. For such a frame of mind it would be superfluous labor to carry out the detailed proof of God. That which no reasonable man cannot deny is not in need of laborious demons tration. This is an intuition experienced by the philosopher in his con templation of impermanence. He realizes that being must interpenetrate phenomena; these do not possess being within themselves; therefore it must come to them from outside. A being, that "is" in itself, operates upon the transitory thing, bestowing on it every second that which is "real" in it.30 Understandably this idea has also influenced mysticism; the being flowing into things is God's very essence, since God represents being</page><page sequence="6">236 MAX HORTEN (God is in phenomena ? theocentric conception). But an intuition is not first demonstrated. It is thus the very paucity of formal proofs of God which reveals to us how deeply Muslims experience the Divine. Thus we come to the doctrines of further modifications of being, among which the concept of act and potency is to be mentioned as most important. The processes of the physical and mental world take place in that something merely possible becomes real, that is a potentiality becomes an actuality. The stock example is the process of heating: wool has the potential of being burned; the fire, by its own nature hot, makes this potentiality an actuality, in that it transmits the "form" of heat (i.e. the essence) to the wool-matter. This contains in itself (per se) no heat; it must therefore receive this, and from an agent which is hot per se. From this it is apparent that something per se actual is the cause of a potential's receiving its corresponding actuality. This actuality is not attained per se, therefore per accidens (not from inherent essence, but from without). From this results the rule; everything which possesses any quality per accidens, has received this from an agent in which this quality resides per se. This is true of all individual categories of reality, but also of actuality itself. This is contained in essence (per se) in God; in matter it resides per accidens. Matter therefore represents an absolute potential, which is actualized by God. Averroes expresses the process of creation in this formula, since he rejects the contingency concept and therefore emanation of being. For Averroes the law of potency and act, per se and per accidens, is the most fundamental natural law; for Avicenna this law is subordinate to the idea of emanation of being. The substance?question is developed logically, and in its conceptual framework all things find their place. Things can be divided into those in substrata (accidents and forms) and those which exist without a substra tum. Some of these are substrata for other things (accidents the created substances existing in themselves), some of them are not (God). The substances form different species and accordingly operate in different manners; for activity comes about according to being. "Some of the substances operate upon bodies (we call these souls); some operate upon souls (we call these mind or intellect). The things in substrata, the accidents, originate in time from causes operating in time, the chain of which leads to a principle of the spheres; in a certain respect this principle is temporal, in another eternal". The cause must be adequate. Ac</page><page sequence="7">ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY 237 cordingly a transitory cause must be provided for a transitory effect. The substance of the spheres, the quinta essentia is without beginning and im mutable. It cannot therefore be the cause of the temporal (that is begin ning after non-being) and variable things. The motion of the spheres is also, taken as a whole, without beginning and immutable. It is the most perfect motion, circular motion. Where therefore can we find that cause which operates from the imperishable and eternal spheres upon the transi toriness of the lower world? The cause is to be found in individual parts of the system of the spheres. Although as a whole this is eternal,the parts begin and end in time, possess the perishable nature of lower phenomena, and can bring these forth with their imperfections. The lowest form of substances are the bodies. They react passively. The intermediate forms are the souls. They are both active (operating upon bodies or impressed in them as universal forms) and passive (operated upon by spirits?minds). The highest forms of substances are the spirits, intelligences which have no contact with bodies, neither as effective nor as "impressions" of universal forms. They are in essence active. The remaining metaphysical concepts are taken from Artistotle and serve as the indispensable building blocks of philosophizing. These are the doctrines of substance and accidents, etc. The theory of causality is particularly emphasized and carefully demonstrated. Knowledge of a thing depends on comprehension of the cause. Since knowledge of things is the passionately pursued goal of the intellect, its attention must be primarily directed to causes. The absolute (adequate) cause (causa efficiens, operative cause) is one that produces its effect by necessity; its essence is such that it must carry out this function; this cause is often accompanied by conditions, avails itself of an instruement, and may possibly encounter obstacles. Its function is to introduce form (causa formalies) into matter (causa materialisY therefore consciously or unconsciously pursuing a goal (causa finalis). These basic concepts, frequently exemplified by the acti vity of the artists as he forms a statue, serve as explanations of both psychic and physical proceedings, the activity of God and of his creatures. 3. God In Islam the great battle of the intellects revolved around the question of God. Averroes never tired of contesting the "naivetes" as he said, of theologians who made anthropomorphic pronouncements about God. He claimed to have found the real meaning of the revelation in philosophical</page><page sequence="8">238 MAX HORTEN truth, (jrhazali attacked Avicenna and with him the whole Greek intel lectual movement. Averroes proclaimed himself a defender of that move ment. Hoja-Zade (d. 1488) found the golden mean between the two. The lively drama fittingly shows us the intellectual peak achieved by this age and culture. God is Absolute Being, Necessary Being (Farabf, Avicenna), the First Mover, Pure Act unmixed with potentiality,the Purest Reality (Aver roes), the Most Perfect Being. From such formulations the theologians merely inferred: God is the adequate, that is dependent, necessarily opera tive cause of the world, as its "first" Mover. Averroes thoroughly subs tantiates God's freedom, which can in no way be compared to human freedom; God knows no wavering of choice and no potentiality; his free dom is that of complete actuality, of actus purus. To characterize God as "not free" would be impossible. Where God is concerned there can be no question of necessity in the sense of determination or subordination to a law or a force. According to this particular attitude towards the world of sense perception (that is, the independent reality of this world is seen to be ques tionable and otherworldly ultimate Being is recognized as true reality), it is understandable that proofs of God are not as much in evidence as they might be in an environment in which believers had to defend their views against sceptics. One has the feeling: that which is not challenged is not in need of careful and attentive demonstration. Nevertheless, the philosophers also come forward to prove God's existence, in answer to the resulting demands of the systematic world-view. Their classic proof is that of contingency, which Farabi develops master fully in his "Gem of Wisdom" No. 1. The fundamental questions of essence and existence are based upon his philosophy (see above). Con tingency ("chance") is that element to which existence relates neutrally. If a thing partakes of existence, it must have received this from a donor of existence, which by its nature (essence) possesses existence. The world however is contingent. It follows that the world must obtain its existence from something necessarily and in itself "being". Another formulation of this though ("Gem". No. 2) brings the con cepts of the "possible", "impossible", and "necessary" harmoniously and correlatively into play. The causal proof is also to be found ("Gem" No' 3). A group of three proofs of essence, individuality, type and species</page><page sequence="9">ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY 239 is peculiar to FarabI ("Gem" No. 6). They reveal a pronouncedly realistic thought. Shirazi31 comprehensively summarized these speculations. An ontological proof of God has, apparently, not yet been formula ted in the Orient. This seems to be more consistent with the temperament of northern peoples (Anselmus, Descartes, Leibniz, Mendelssohn) although it was absolutely rejected by the leading spirits of Christian Scholasticism. Another equally important issue of controversy was that of know ledge in God. The things of the lower world are individual and material. They can only be known via sense perception and imagination. From this Ghazall demonstrated, that according to the philosophers God must be ignorant of world phenomena. If God knows, then He comprehends Himself as emanation-principle, "of that which emanates directly from Him", of the Nous. Other things He knows not individually, but uni versally. "God beholds things in a universal species intelligibilis". How ever even Ghazall had to recognize in his "Inconsistencies"32 that Muslim philosophers also admit God's knowledge of individual things. They take pains to make this knowledge understandable in the light of God's absolute unity and incorporeality, just as they admit His freedom of will.33 God, of course, knows infinite things, that is all possible and actual indivi duals.34 He also determines in his providence the eternal world-plan of all particular things. He fashions the real universe according to His world plan. He appoints time, place, and form for all things. The realization of this plan proceeds, not because of physical necessity, but rather accord ing to the will and wisdom of God, yet in such a manner that the result cannot possibly fail or go astray. Here is an attempt to reconcile neces sity and freedom. The outcome is that God's knowledge of individual things is to be understood in the light of His role as Ultimate Cause, per ceiving the individual objects of His activity. God directly brings about being in all things. As dispenser of being He suffuses and permeates the entire universe. He is directly joined to all individuals and can therefore know them. A dramatic dispute concerning knowledge in God stirred the Muslim scholars to activity, and this was depicted in a Gloss to Suhrawardl35: Avicenna and other disciples of the Peripatetics taught: God knows things outside Himself through forms of knowledge inherent in His essence. The later philosophers opposed this and even JusI contested this particular doctrine, although he especially esteemed the Master (Avicenna was always called Shaykh ? the Master, a term of special pre-eminence) and had the</page><page sequence="10">240 MAX HORTEN firm intention, not to contradict him. Yet TusI concludes that according to this theory God must be one and the same substance, receiving and operating upon at the same time, active and passive, and as a matter of fact secundem idem, in the same respect. Furthermore the Godhead would then have real attributes distinct from His essence. Others denied knowledge in God in order to avoid including any plurality in His essence. Avicenna is to be distinguished from such philosophers who deny knowledge in God. He taught that God knows real things, i.e. individual phenomena, through forms of knowledge present in Him. If God's forms of knowledge were not capable of revealing concrete things to Him, Avi cenna would have taught God's ignorance of the world, and this is univer sally contested. God's effect (activity) on things is another heatedly contested issue. For Muslim philosophers the Godhead is the adequate cause of the world. After the concept of cause had been elucidated in metaphysics, the trans ference of this concept to God could not be avoided. However the neces sity and eternity of creation necessarily follows. God is "not free" in His outwardly directed activity?not in His essence; that is, He cannot fail to create the world. In the intellectual sphere all problems are eliminated, and God is conceived according to clear metaphysical theories. The Greek movement, because of its intellectual bent, could not decide other wise. The principal objections, however, came from Semitism, from Islam, which emphasized the voluntary aspect of God. The Logos (Nous) is the intermediary between God's activity and the world. For unlimited plurality cannot proceed directly from absolute oneness. This must gradually prepare the way and establish itself. The Nous is still one, but in its nature there is a combination of existence and essence. This, because of its oneness, can proceed from the sole ultimate principle; yet because of its inherent plurality, it can be the starting point for plurality. A chain of emanation phases of the heavenly spirits issues from the Logos, and this culminates in the spirits of the lunar sphere, the Active Intelligence (see below). However, it should be noted here, that the bestowal of being can only issue directly and actually from being per se, so that God alone is the actual effective initiator of creation. The secondary causes can constitute only an illusory mediating agent. They operate in the transformation of real things, not, however, in the emana tion of being, that is in the creation from nothing. Farabl's36 commen tator throws light on this problem. In each thing God is nearer than its</page><page sequence="11">ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY 241 very existence, since He joins this existence with its essence. God is thus nearer to each thing than the "instrument" with which He seems to operate. The "instrument" is only contributed for the sake of the systematic struc ture of the world; it cannot bestow being or effect things in their being. The mediating causes are illusory causes. The ubiquitousness of Ultimate Being (al-wujud al-muflaq ? of absolute Being) in the entire universe is not called into question by the mediating causes. God operates immanently in all things. FarabFs school coined the formula of docta ignorantia in close agree ment with the Master's teaching and with Plotinus; "The most perfect path to God is the realization, that no path leads to Him". God can only be known according to His external attributes and relationships. His essence remains incomprehensible for us. Islam readily incorporated this idea, which has become selfevident and can be found at every level and in every movement. In Scholasticism and in the Renaissance (Nicholas of Cusa) the identical conviction again surfaced. The designation of God as "infinite" is also considered not charac teristically Greek. This is taken to be a product of Renaissance mentality and a reflection of the "Faustian" man. However the idea most probably also derives from ancient Greece and is truly Oriental (ghayr mabdud). As the "infinite" God remains ineffable, since definition (badd = circums scription) means a setting of limitations (tabdid), and this can only embrace and perceive the limitable (ex definitione). That this thesis at its deeper roots may be related to the idea of a "hidden" God was incidentally sug gested in the above description of the Oriental Light-myth. 4. The World The struggle against Greek philosophy was directed primarily against the doctrine of a creation without beginning. This implies that this issue had been a focal point of Greek thought. The Oriental was not familiar with this idea as the doctrine of an uncreated substance; but even as "eternal creation" it seemed to the theologians, as a dogma, much too suspicious, since it threatened to nullify God's freedom (Averroes took pains to uphold God's freedom along with an eternal creation) and reduce Him to a causa adequata, operating from natural necessity. This doctrine could also undermine the foundations of human morality, since God Him self would no longer be morally active. So this issue agitates the inner most strata of philosophy,37 and it is understandable that the issue was</page><page sequence="12">242 MAX HORTEN and is even today treated without compromise by theologians. Although much has been written about this problem,38 often stark misunderstand ings are still to be found. In circles unschooled in philosophy it was consi dered a forgone conclusion that creation also meant the beginning of the world in time and that an "eternal world" (that was the insidious term in Islam) also implied a denial of creation. The Latin translations of Aver roes' works aided and abetted this naive confusion; for the Latin Averroes appeared to the West as an unbeliever and an adversary of religion, whereas the original Arabic Averroes was not only a pious Muslim, but even an apologist for Islam, who directed his entire striving towards a reconcilia tion of Islam with the knowledge of his time.39 The Qur'anic dogma40 has a neutral relationship vis a vis the concepts of a temporal or eternal world, since in both cases this world must be created by an absolute prin ciple. For "eternal" does not mean "uncreated", subsisting in and of itself" (esse a se\ but can at the same time signify "subsisting through another", even though this subsistence is without beginning. An aeternum ab alio is no logical contradiction, when the Eternal Agent is beyond time and His activity not conditional upon time. It is therefore more useful for modern comprehension of these unfamiliar questions, to speak of a "creation without beginning" rather than of an "eternal world", for the shocking idea of an uncreated world, inconceivable for Islam, must be avoided at all costs. The doctrine of the "eternity" of the world is for Islam itself a source of unending controversies and misunderstandings,similiar to those in the West. One spoke of "eternity" (qidam) and characterized this condition as pertaining exclusively to God, which would mean the disavowal of an eternal world. Greek-leaning intellectuals however understood by "eternity" "without beginning" (azal) - namely in the sense of being derived from a superior principle of being. Being can derive ab alio and at the same time be without beginning. The esse ab alio does not mean begin ning, above all in circumstances such as those of the act of creation in which time does not yet exist. If the principle of Being is eternal and the act of creation timeless, then creatures can be conceived as without beginning or even, if one wishes, "eternal", Thus eternity, however, does not in any way signify as esse a se, which pertains uniquely to God. Even the later mystics, for instance Jill, perpetuated the old confu sion by designating eternity, in the sense of being without beginning, as a characteristic pertaining solely to God. The theologians saw God's unique role threatened by a creation without beginning. The created</page><page sequence="13">ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY 243 could thereby too closely resemble the Creator. Those untrained in philo sophy were even of the opinion that the "eternity" of creation meant an esse a se of creation. In that case the creature would be uncreated and identical with God. The fact that the broad mass of the partially educated misunderstood this doctrine of philosophy probably accounts for the far reaching indignation against it. Basically the philosophical thesis was completely harmless; at most it conflicted with the literal meaning of some Qur'anic passages, which could easily be interpreted in a different manner. We can easily imagine the philosophers' proud feeling of superiority, as they realized in discussions with the theologians, that these constantly confused the most fundamental philosophical concepts (i.e. aeternum and esse a se\ and for this reason perhaps even considered the idea of a "creation without beginning" as a contradiction. Disdain for such ignorance of philosophy is occasionally very evident in Averroes'. The heart of the concept of God as the eternally operating causa adequata of the world is, according to such thorough going Neo-Platonists as the Islamic philosophers, naturally not the Aristotelian doctrine of the causa, but rather the doctrine of emanation. In the theories of evolution propoun ded by Indian and Persian thought this idea was transformed into a concept of necessary and eternally renewed manifestation of God in the forms and configurations of the Maya-world. In a monistic system such as Babism, there can no longer be any question of God as the "cause" of the world; for cause and effect are always separate and distinct. If God and world form one and only one reality, a cause-effect relationship between them is impossible, and the world-process is an evolution of God's ultimate essence. So the Babis were not attempting, as was falsely assumed, to reconcile the emanation-concept with the concept of creation, by tracing "God's pre-existence before the world in time to the logical pre-existence of the causal relationship". They recognize neither creation through emanation nor through cause and effect, but rather only through mani festation. In the Orient many theories about the origin of the world flow together. Often what is basically a concept of manifestation is charac terized as emanation. In the use of terms agitation and confusion reign. Therefore fundamentally different views should always be identified and distinguished. Emanation (fayd) is the system of, for example, Avicenna: plurality issues forth from God as the One, as the spirits of the spheres emerge hier</page><page sequence="14">244 MAX HORTEN archically from him. The "creature" issues from God and, outside of God, establishes itself as an independent substance; a system of such substances constitutes the world outside God. Manifestation is no effluence from God, and through manifestation no world "outside" God is established. It is rather God's revealing of Himself (tajalll ? becoming clear and visible). God discloses Himself, since he exists as the concealed Light, self-contained, spiritual, in a world inaccessible to creatures. "I was a bidden treasure and wished to be known that is why I created the world", God says of Himself, God must therefore clothe Himself in forms, in diffuse and material aspects perceptible to His creatures. As Farabl's commentator says, God must veil Himself, so that men's weak eyes will not be blinded by the divine brilliance. For God becomes visible by disguising Himself, as the sun becomes visible only when a light cloud screens it. In this view of the world God is perceived as the core, around which the veils of the Maya-world are drawn. In the emanation-system God is perceived as outside of the world, so that men must find their way back to Him, accomplishing as it were a long and distant journey. The manifestaion-system was thus able to incorporate Indian pantheism, according to which there is only one essence?substance; the phenomena of the world of illusions relinquish their individuality, entering once again into the primary substance. Of course Neo-Platonism also has a Maya-world and a pantheism. But it does not have Nirvana (fand?annhiliation) as its fundamental idea. In the doctrine of the origin of the world the three great intellectual trends of the Orient - Hellenism, Parsism, and Brahminism-Buddhism - merge into an almost indivisible unity. This intermingling and harmoniza tion is also found in the doctrine of the world structure. The general structure appears thus: God-Logos-World Spirit World-Soul - spheres - sublunary world. These terms do not uniquely determine the nature of the system. The presence of these terms does not always signify pure Neo-Platonism. In Platonizing systems we find a Logos which contains in it the archetypes. He is the Demiurge. The manifestation systems stress in the Logos his luminous nature and his shining forth from God; at the same time they emphasize his similarity in essence with God, who is conceived as "the hidden". Often the Logos</page><page sequence="15">ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY 245 is also carrier and primary substance of all creatures, and the perfect Man, the "great man", the macrocosm. The great systems contain traits of the most diverse world-views. Therefore we should emphasize the complexity of these systems and not try to label them according to a particular trend. The manifestation system of Persia has been described as simple Neo-Platonism. Certainly it exhibits many Neo-Platonic traits and elements; but its characteristic and fundamental idea content is the Light-philosophy of the ancient Orient; to this are joined Greek and Indian ideas. Natural laws establish the entire universe according to a uniform principle. They introduce a unified system, and the world structure be comes through these a harmonious cosmos. There is a parallelism between the worlds. Although the conceptual representations of these differ, their origins can be traced to the astral view of the world. Heaven is a model for the earth. Whatever happens in heaven must repeat itself on earth. The position and the course of the stars are symbols, archetypes and causes of events on earth, and from these earthly events can be calcu lated (astrology). One particular form of world-parallelism is the macrocosm-micro cosm idea: man is himself a miniature world and this miniature world is identical to the greater world. The parts of both are parallel, identical in essence, following the same harmonious laws. Another idea of the ancient Orient is that of the kingdom patterned on the great cosmos. The king therefore wears sun-motifs (crown as a wreath of sunrays, compare the halo; long hair of the Persian Kings, compare Simson motif; the throne as a baldachin of the spheres or a lofty seat over the earth-sphere, etc.). Therefore we find this outgrowth; man is a well-ordered kingdom. The soul is the king, residing in the body, and the subordinate powers serve this as army and administration.41 The idea of monumentally conceived world-laws also is found at different levels of Islam, in cultivated circles and among the people, and confers on Islam a certain liberality.42 A great unity in outlook underlies the whole. The idea of world-parallelism is readily elaborated; generally it is also latently at the root of the philosophical thought-processes (see discus sion of the Perfect Man below). We find the sequence: God, (1) spirits, (2) souls, (3) shadows of the intermediate world (barzakft), (4) spheres, (5) bodies. A microcosmic sequence is parallel to the macrocosmic, repre</page><page sequence="16">246 MAX HORTEN senting various human parts (1) intellect, human spirit (2) animal soul furnished with sense perception, (3) vegetable soul, (4) body. (5) primary matter as last substratum of the body. God, as a being of superior nature, is above and beyond these parallel sequences. The difficulties suggested by No. 2 and No. 3 above are very evident and were solved by the subsequent re-ordering:43 (1) intellect, (2) aestima tiva = instinct == wahm?specialized intellect, of the same order as the heavenly souls, (3) representative imagination (to be differentiated from asso ciative imagination) comparable to the world of shadows, (4) external perception, symbol of the live body (the spheres are animalia?live bodies,) (5) inamiate bodies, the body as a mass of matter, equivalent to the sub lunary bodies. 5. The Worlds of Spirits, Souls, and Spheres It was his treatment of the cosmos-question which drew attention to Avicenna in the Middle Ages and which attracted the attacks of the Scholastics. Avicenna conceived spirits of the spheres as the mediating agents in the act of creation, whereas Thomas demonstrated that no created causes could intervene in creation, since this activity was absolute, an extension of Being itself. The Neo-Platonic basic principle is as follows: from the One only one thing can issue. One absolute primary cause can only produce a single effect. For there must be a commensurate relationship between the two. Accordingly, from God only?one effect can directly result?the Nous. God is distinguished by absolute simplicity. The first Intelligence which emanates from God is, in a certain sense, One; it contains, on the other hand, a multiplicity, and because of this it can become the cause of multiple world phenomena. The aspect of multiplicitly becomes even greater with increasing distance from God and increasing proximity to matter, so that the limitless plurality of the lower world phenomena can be understood and, in the last analysis, derived from the First Cause. The Nous?World Spirit is to be found above the environmental sphere. Tt contains within it a triad: (1) its contingency, (2) its knowledge of God, (3) its knowledge of self. From this triad the triad of the en vironmental spheres can be understood, although the Nous itself is a unity produced by God's unity. Plurality in the Nous is not directly "caused",</page><page sequence="17">ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY 247 but results because the Nous is contingent and must necessarily enter into a relationship with God and with itself. God created the Nous as a unity. The emanation process is logically developed according to these fundamentals. From the Nous' knowledge of God results an intelligence, from its knowledge of self a soul, and from its contingency a body which is the matter of the environmental sphere, animated by that second spirit and the soul. From the second spirit thus emanate (1) a spirit, (2) a soul, (3) the bodies of the fixed star sphere, which merge into one organism. From this third spirit results spirit, soul, and body of the saturn sphere and so on to the lunar sphere, which the "Active Intelligence" provides with the appropriate soul. From this, in union with the natures of the spheres, everything comprising the lunar sphere issues forth: transitory matter in the forms of(l) elements, (2) plants, (3) animals, (4) man; at the same time the forms of cognition reach man's passive intellect. The passive intellect is, in the inttellectual realm, the primary matter. And so two parallel developments result: the emanation of universal forms (1) as forms of being into primary matter, and (2) as forms of cognition into the material that is passive - human mind.Since both forms - the "real" forms of the external world and the cognitive forms of the internal world- are identical, our knowledge is true, that is, it is congruent with things and their essences. The emanation principle was transformed in the most conservative of Avicenna's schools, since there was general dissatisfaction with the Master's formulation, Tusi44 has (1) the second intelligence originating from the necessity of the Nous (2) the first soul deriving from the existence of the Nous and (3) the body of the spheres from the contingency of the Nous. Others introduce new modifications from the Nous' existence an intelligence results, from its contingency a sphere; or - from the Nous' necessity ab alio (from God) and from the knowledge of God an intellect is produced, from its existence a soul, and from its contingency a body. The theory of the spirit-world is based on Plato's ideas. Each type of spirit corresponds to the type of a form of lower creatures. In the genesis of things spirits "incarnate" themselves, as it were, in matter, in that their universal form shines forth and penetrates matter. Each "angel", that is spirit, represents a species of sublunary things.</page><page sequence="18">248 MAX HORTEN 6. Man The question of the souls' substance was a great issue of controversy for both the Orient and the Occident (i.e. controversy concerning Averroes). Avicenna himself relates that he came to know, during his youth in his father's house, of the Isma'ili's Brahmanic teachings?through wandering Shl'a preachers and proselytizers who came to his family, spreading the doctrine of the one World-Spirit. 'All and the twelve Imams were parti cular manifestation forms of the World-Spirit; and each man is a ray of the same, as the light of the sun falls upon a wall. In death the ray of light withdraws again to the Original Sun of spiritual being, the World-Spirit. Early in his career Avicenna tackled this problem which was a burn ing issue for the Muslim world of his time. He soon became convinced that each man was in possession of an individual soul, and that this soul must be a self-subsisting substance. Averroes proceeded from Aristo telian hypotheses to arrive at the opposite conviction, which in substance resembles the Brahmanic view. An individual results only through and in matter. Matter is the principium individuationis. The human Spirit (mind) is not of matter. Accordingly there can only be one unique example of its species. Therefore all men partake of one and the same spiritual substance. Following the same principle, the Scholastics arrived at the theory that each angel represents a particular type. The angels cannot be differentiated individually but only by species. Averroes could also have concluded that each man represented a species for himself. How ever, since we consider the entire human race one species, his conclusion was closer to our view. Nevertheless Averroes firmly adhered to the idea of the life of the individual after death; at least he considered this a possibility, since each man receives an ostensible body. The problem of soul vs. body was solved by Avicenna in a Neo-Pla tonizing sense. The soul is created in time in the supernal world and des cends to the lower created world to take up residence in a body; at death the soul again deserts this body, to return to the super-terrestrial world, there, where its true home is to be found. According to Averroes the radiation of the world-soul becomes individual in the body. In death the world-soul relinquishes its individua</page><page sequence="19">ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY 249 lization once more and, no longer maintaining a spiritualized body, is only a species and the identical substance for all men. Thus, according to Avi cenna a substance can originate in time, un-burdened with Hyle (primary matter), and this is challenged by Averroes. Avicenna recognized eight instead of the usual five senses, and in this was in agreement with modern psychology, a singularity of no small significance. He divided the sense of touch into four senses, classifying these according to objects i.e. (1) damp and dry, (2) hot and cold, (3) hard and soft, (4) adhesive and pulverized or elastic and inelastic. Later philosophy also incorporated this division. ShlrazI45 further added: "Others also include a fifth type ? light and heavy", so that we attain a series of nine senses. In our (Shlrazfs) discussion of 'the First Principle and the Return we have demonstrated the reasons for this arrangement. Farani in his commentary on Farabl's "Gems of Science" agrees almost word for word. There is still the controversial question as to whether Avicenna considers the soul to have a true pre-existence in the heavenly world (as the poem about the soul seems to suggest), or whether the soul, although coming from the supernal world, only originates with and at the same time as the body. This last is clearly Avicenna's teaching in his discussion of the soul and of the first principle and the "return". Body and soul are destined for each other. The soul for this particular body, and the body for this particular soul, and these come into being simultaneously with one another. While the body forms and combines in physical-animal fashion, the soul, allotted to this individual body, comes into being through the Active Intelligence of the lunar sphere in time and simultaneously with the body, descending into and joining with it. The soul is thus an incomplete substance, a part, containing its own substantiality, which develops and strengthens itself in earthly life, "according to the materials, times, and forms of the body". Thus after its separation from the body, the soul can endure without this as an individual substance. The body is not neces sary for the continuous existence of the soul's essence; in earthly life it was only joined to the body into an individual being, to lead an individual existence. ShlrazI46 gives a fantastic explanation of our perceptions. It is worthy of mention as an example of the typical manner in which psycho* logical questions are drawn into cosmic relationships. Beneath the spirit</page><page sequence="20">250 MAX HORTEN world and above the sublunary domain is to be found the intermediate world, the world of phantoms, shadowy images, half-physical pneuma-like forms (Mtaydlat ? phantoms). This shadowy world, is, in the macrocosm, the equivalent of imagination in the microcosm, it represents the abode of the departed souls until the Last Judgement?at least according to one view. From this world the images of our imagination and sense - percep tions must descend, since they are related in essence. "Each sense percep tion is accomplished when the corresponding sensory image originates in heaven (where sov\s?not the pure intelligences abide); there it is free from all matter, although not from its relation to matter, and it is inherent in the human soul as a thing is inherent in its operative agent, not as in the receptive principle". Our soul is not simply a passive substratum; it is also active, in that it, in its, turn also transforms the images of perception, after having received these from the heavenly world. ShirazI must now clarify, how these images of perception from above are congruent with the phenomena of our environment, which present themselves to our sense perceptions. Yet Avicenna had already established this parallelism for the forms of cogni tion; knowledge from the sense posed no unusual or insoluble difficulties. In the domain of intention and behavior the question of freedom arose. By its nature freedom cannot be admitted by the philosophers. For the theory of cause shows that all contingent things and all things just coming into being must have an adequate cause. Yet the inner act of will and the exterior action of the body members are constantly beginning anew; therefore they must have a cause outside man himself. How ever every created cause is dependent on another, until arriving at the first cause of the universe, which is the cause of itself, any further questioning must be suspended. Thus all actions of will are to begin with determined by natural (secondary) causes and finally by God. There is no conflict here between the preceding view and our consciouness of freedom of will and moral responsibility, which our daily experience seems to certify. Therefore the problem of freedom is not discussed as passionately as in Christian Scholasticism. Freedom from causal determination is not a requisite for moral responsibility. Avicenna states: "All resolutions of will come about after they have not existed. Therefore these also must have causes, and these causes succeed one another and necessarily produce the act". The chain of these causes</page><page sequence="21">ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY 251 cannot however continue to infinity. Consequently God is the First Cause of all our positive actions.47 7. The World of Bodies The infinite multiplicity of the sublunary world of bodies derives from the eternal succession of the planetary movements and of the heavenly spirits. With this the astrological principle is recognized. Avicenna, however, contests the application of astronomy. Man's knowledge is not capable of predicting the future from the stars. A characteristically Greek concept within the domain of natural sciences is that of natural force, of "physis", which operates outwards from itself. After the doctrines of form (essence) and cause, this idea was necessarily bound to result. "Physis" is a form which acts as a causa adequata. This activity however does not proceed uniquely from natural force, it is also dependent on the operative power of the sphere-spirits. Spatial dimension is an inherency, a corporeal attribute, Suhrawardi perceives this as the essence of body.48 In alchemy49 Avicenna developed a doctrine in opposition to FarabI: The seven malleable metals?gold, silver, lead, tin, zinc, copper, iron are not convertible into each other; for they are different types of a species. The types and essences are however imperishable. "In the Muslim Orient this theory was accepted and followed", Avicenna undertakes the most thoroughgoing investigations con cerning motion, which is formally the subject of the natural sciences (the ens mobile). He also thoroughly studies time, in which he clearly em phasizes the subjective moment. In Avicenna's works matter is considered according to both Aris totelian forms?as absolutely without modifications and as furnished with qualifications - metaphysical and physical. Practical Philosophy (Ethics) Ethics, as philosophta practica, is contrasted to the rest of philosophy in its totality, called (according to our encyclopedic survey) speculative philosophy. Mystical tendencies in FarabI and Avicenna are evidence that the Muslim intellectuals of the Greek movement considered ethics absolutely essential to philosophy. Avicenna recognizes Justice50 as the</page><page sequence="22">252 MAX HORTEN crown of philosophy and desired union of all virtues with moral life. The realization of Justice embraces intelligence, moderation, and courage. The Socratic idea, that basically there is only one virute, may possibly be detected behind this thesis. Social life as a whole is also treated within the sphere of philosophy - as an addendum of metaphysics.51 This social life is conceived purely according to Islamic precepts, which clearly suggests that Avicenna was a faithful Muslim. This must be emphasized to offset erroneous repre sentations, probably deriving from medieval Latin translations. We must generally acknowledge as characteristic the fact that the intellectuals influenced by the Greek movement are not especially fascina ted by ethical problems. One can read through entire works of Avicenna without coming up against ethical issues. Only at the end of his "Theses" (ishdrat) and "Metaphysics" does he touch upon ethics. Here, however, we have evidence of the depth of his moral concern. Real life must be ordered according to theory; only in the union of theory and practice is perfection to be found. This is an idea which reigns at every level of Muslim culture. Of course the Greek movement primarily accentuates the rational element. This typically Hellenic trait is shared by the Persians, but is completely alien to the Semitic nature. According to Farabf52 happiness is realized in perception of the Highest Object, and in contrast, life's actions lose their significance. In Averroes'53 view union with the Divine is only accomplished through the consummation in knowledge, which becomes the contemplation of God. The practical performance of virtue does not lead to this end. All the slumbering potentiality of our intellect must be activated, provided with the appropriate "forms" of perception; then the perfection of the human essence is accomplished. In this thought-current it is evident that virtue is a form of knowledge and that a moral act is subordinate to the cognitive realization of the Most High. Theologians and practical conservative mystics approach ethics with the antithetical attitude, while speculative mystics identify with the philosophers. This issue is the cause of a wide cleavage in Muslim culture, although there were constant attempts to reconcile the adversary positions, attempts which succeeded in the treatement of many fundamental questions. Concerning man's final goal and destination, philosophical dogma reveals many uncertainties. The general view of educated Muslims main</page><page sequence="23">ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY 253 tains (perhaps because of Chiristian influences) the beholding of God as man's ultimate goal. In "the First Principle and the Return"54 Avi* cenna professes that eternal happiness consists in the union of our soul with the Active Intelligence. Yet he argues against this idea in other writings. For Averroes man's final phase is a substantial fusion with the World Spirit (mind), which is of spiritual substance. However, Averroes does not oppose the Qur'anic formulation because of these views. He cer tainly accepts the idea of enduring consciousness. In their concern with Qur'anic dogma and the mystery of the Resurrection of the Body, the philosophers had to oppose the prevalent idea of transmigration of souls. They were familiar with the mystics' total rejection of resurrection (dating from 850). The philosophical inter pretation seems to be a middle way between this denial and the orthodox affirmation. It is obvious that the Neo-Platonic thought system of the Muslim philosophers (particularly the mystically inclined FarabI) tended towards the denial of a physical after life and a recognition of the "deeper meaning" of the Qur'an - in the idea of the eternally existing soul. In any case Qur'anic revelation is the ultimate standard and must be observed; that is the general position. The disavowal which we might expect from these philosophers is never clearly articulated,55 on the contrary - the mysterious aspect of the other world is emphasized and the possibility of a physical life after death is left open. There is however an unmistakeable glimmer of the view that the essence of Qur'anic dogma must not be sought in the physical eternity, but in the eternal endurance of the spiritual principle in us - and no one will challenge this. Concern ing this SuhrawardFs Gloss is noteworthy:56 "FarabI and Avicenna teach that only the purely spiritual content of the soul endures after death, not, however the animal or vegetable element". For this reason Avicenna recommends the funeral-cult and the invocation of the souls of the dead.5 7 Concerning this problem (controversial and as yet not satisfactorily clarified) we could summarize: although it has been claimed that Avicenna radically denied the Resurrection of the Body, in his metaphysics there is no hint of this extreme position.5 8 Avicenna leaves open the philosophical question of the enigmas of Qur'anic faith; he accepts these as mysteries and facts of faith, as does Averroes. A Gloss of ShlrazI59 concerning Suhrawardi reports the following as his teaching: "The human soul can receive a body in the afterlife (an ethereal body ,considered a possibility by Averroes as well). Thus the soul is capable of sense perception. In</page><page sequence="24">254 MAX HORTEN the 'Recovery' and in the 'Deliverance' he teaches: earthly bodies cannot enter the heavenly world; but the spheres can serve human souls as sense organs (compare the doctrine of the Brethren of Basra). Suhraward! sanctions this in his "Explanations", although he rejects it in the "Enlighten ment". The purging of the soul from matter is, of course, the ideal of mystical ethics. The views of the Brethren of Basra, which progress along the same lines as those of the Neo-Platonists (Avicenna, etc.) are significant. They show that their entire striving was directed towards grasping the "true essence" of Muslim faith, abstracting this essence from the abundance of externalities in order to defend Qur'anic belief. "Whosoever60 supposes that man is nothing more than this sensibly perceptible combination of flesh, blood, bones, veins (these components are all three-dimensional bodies) and the accidents inherent in these - that is the formed and indivi dual structure, man's outer shell - he does not comprehend the true meaning of the Resurrection or of the Last Judgement. He would imagine only a return of individual particular bodies once again whole, a restoration of the individual corporeal substance with their accidents in their identical forms. Then gathered together before the tribunal of Justice, these would be called to account and rewarded or punished for their works - good as well as bad deeds, knowledge of God as well as ignorance or denial of God. Know, my brothers that this belief is only suitable for women, children, the ignorant, and the ill-bred, and for those who neither observe nor com prehend the fundamental idea of the sciences. Whosoever, however, is superior in science to these groups, is convinced that other substances are joined to these concrete bodies. These substances are more refined and pure and are called spirits and souls. By Resurrection those more per ceptive understand that these spirits and souls return to the same or other (ethereal) bodies (which replace the former)".61 "Whosoever, however, is even more advanced and enlightened, (that is - true philosophers) knows that the soul resides in the body as if in a prison. Then Resurrection is understood as a separation of the soul from the body (after the soul has become self-sufficient in substance and independent in its enduring existence) and the entrance into its (spiritual) world. The enlightened then ask of God nothing more than to be reunited with their own kind among the departed, that is with the prophets, the just, the martyrs, and the pious". The belief that the bodies of the Blessed endure in flesh and blood</page><page sequence="25">ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY 255 as in this life is likewise considered a placebo for the ingorant.62 The assumption that in the afterlife we will possess transfigured bodies of a different type than in earthy life is not completely rejected and is allowed to continue among groups of the less educated. The Brethren of Ba?ra were represented as free-thinkers, rationalists, and enemies of Islam. Such subjective and emotional views must neces sarily retreat before objective research. The Brethren wish to defend Islam; They are irrevocably convinced of the supernatural Qur'anic truth and seek to accomplish the available apology of their faith by explaining the deeper meaning (haqiqa) of the holy texts. At this deeper level the complete harmony of faith and knowledge is established. This is the end and aim of all their literary attempts. To consider these Brethren repre sentatives of a natural religion or even unbelievers is a misconstruing of the most obvious facts. Averroes agrees with them in essential points includ ing their concept of the ostensible body. When conservative theologians such as Razi (d. 1210) suspect a threat to religion63 in the allegories of philosophers and msytics re-in terpretations of the crassly physical Qur'anic texts) this represents the theo logical disapproval of those doctrines, not however of the attitude which prompted them or even of their meaning. The liberal theological group does not share these apprehensions (really quite unfounded) to the same extent. RSzi himself sanctions this allegorical interpretation when he explains (concerning Qur'an II, 262)6 4 that the life of the heart consists in the invocation to God and that "the perfect spiritual life begins only after the soul is separated from this (earthly) body". Then the only possibilities are those of a incorporeal afterlife of the soul or of eternal life in an ethereal body?that is the philosophical - mystical thesis. If one recognizes the mystical frame of mind, which FarabI expressed so brilliantly, it is obvious that the ultimate goal of man can only be con ceived as union with God. The "return of the soul to its home" consists in this union. IbnBajja (d. 1138) and Ibn Jufayl (d. 1185) teach the same. And Renan is basically justified in emphasizing that Averroes, with his doctrine of union with the Active Intelligence, was not propound ing anything essentially original or shocking. Thus we have indicated points of contact with Muslim mystics. And it is apparent to what a great extent Islamic culture evidences common basic trends and directions in spite of some of its starkly antagonistic positions. A fusion of Indian</page><page sequence="26">256 MAX HORTEN Islamic Nirvana strivings with Greek thought appears, in this context, not so impossible. The idea of the structural unity of the intellectual civili zation is, then, for Islam no longer simply an illusion.65 NO TES: 27.

Farabf s "Gems of Science" (See Max Horten's "Das Buck der Ringsteine Farabis", Munster, 1906) provide us with valuable information concerning his philosophy. Avicenna's great encyclopedias merited a translation, since they had, and in some respects today still have, a powerful influence in the world of Muslim culture. The "Theses" (Ishardt, Forget, Leyden, 1892; compare Revue Nto-Scholastique 894; Nehren, Trait *s Mystiques II, fascicule 1891) enjoyed great esteem until very recently. When Jamal al-din al-Afgbfini gave lectures on these at A|har University in Cairo around 1875, Muhammad *Abduh was inspired to compose the essay "Art" (his Td'ri II, 30 ff). Until now only the metaphysics of the "Healing" (ZDMG, pp. 66,753) could be printed due to the subject matter. Unrestricted use of the Latin translations, without consultation of the original Arabic, should be avoided. Be cause of these translations old errors maintain themselves with astounding stubbor ness. This can be demonstrated in some more recent works, which, even by the choice of their sources, reveal themselves to be worthless. Much data is taken from Ghazalis Tahafut (Contradictions of the Philosophers, Cairo, 1321 ? 1903), a source which still holds much undisclosed material. A work which appeared about 20 years ago, teeming with the most extravagent absur dities, obscures rather than clarifies this material. The author is ignorant even of</page><page sequence="28">258 MAX HORTEN the simple and clear concept of substance, which of course belongs in the first semes ter of philosophy; In the "refutation" through Averroes (see Max Horten, Die Hauptlehren des Averroes nach seiner Schrift: Die Wederlegung des Ghazali, Bonn, 1913) basic ideas such as the denial of contingency (p. 328) and the principle of the "per se" as cause of the "per accidens" come to light. This is especially kept in view in Max Horten, Die Metaphysik des Averroes, Halle, 1912, p. XIII. The accessibi lity of commentaries of Razi and Tssi on the "Theses" would make us acutely con scious (I am judging here according to random tests) of how unprepared we are in the face of Muslim intellectual civilization. Occasional quotes of the philosophers in Glosses to earlier works (often from the lost writings of Avicenna) are very instructive. These show us how active the Greek-Scholastic intellectual world remained even in later periods. They also reveal the image of that early period of philosophy (990-100) preserved in the minds of Oriental experts, who have a completely different insight into the sources than we have. In Muhammad *Abduh (d. 1905?See Max Horten's "Muhammad 'Abduh, Sein Leben und seine theologisch - philosophische Gedankenwelt" in Beitrige zur Kenntnis des Orients XIII) brought about a valid Renaissance movement in philosophy. Sanusi (d. 1490?see Max Horten, "SanUsi und die griechische Phi losophic", Der Islam, VI, pp. 178-188) und Lahiji (died around 1670?See Horten "Die philosophischen und theologischen Ansichten von Lahigi", Der Islam III, pp* 91-131 exhibit the influence of the Hellenic idea-world, which even penetrated into the folk catechisms. Islamic philosophy as a whole testifies to the authority exercised by the Greek movement on the religion of the learned - up to and including Fudali (d. 1821 - see Max Horten, Muhammedanische Glaubenslehre, die Katechis men des Fudali und Sanusi, Bonn, 1916) and Bajuri (d. 1860 - See Max Horten, Die religiose Gedankenwelt der gebildeten Muslime im heutigen Islam, Halle, 1916). If BajQri's work had been written in Greek, it could easily have passed for a Hel enic product of Plotinus' era. My work Texte zu dem Streite Zwischen Glauben und Wissen in Islam, Bonn, 1913, corrects some misconceptions especially about Averroes, from texts available as early as 1859 (Mailer, Philosophic und Theologie von Averroes, Munich); that is, these texts appeared before Renan's Averroes (Paris 2nd edition 1861), yet were not utilized by him. The translation of these appeared in 1875, yet until this day has not been shown any consideration by non-Oriental scholarship. The "main question of Islamic philosophy", the discussion of essence and existence, essentia et existentia, characterizes the deeper strata of this intellectual civilization (Max Horten, "tJber Wesenheit und Dasein in der islamischen Philo sophies Archiv f ar systematische Philosophic XXII, pp. 187-190; Der Islam pp. 295-297) and this concern penetrates deep into mysticism (see Note 30 above). Carra de Vaux: Avicenne, Paris, 1900 may be compared to ZDMG pp. 66, 236 f. The gloss to Suhrawardi (see Note 10b, Sept. Issue, therein Note 45) is very informative about the dispute concerning knowledge in God. This gloss distinguishes</page><page sequence="29">ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY 259 a universal and a particular knowledge in God. The last concerns the individua. However differences in interpretations of Avicenna endured, and one of these denied God's knowledge of individual things. Qhaz&amp;li's attack, which purports this, should be reckoned among this group. The gloss strikingly emphasized that know ledge in God is the cause of individual things. This presupposition is contained in the term "proceeding from". Then, according to Avicenna each particular thing must be adequately known by God The text concerning the docta ignorantia is to be found in "Gem of Wisdom" Nr. 45. The commentaries to the actual original text begin from "Gem" Nr. 43. They appear to have been appended at different levels. Thus Nr. 46 begins a dif ferent stratum; again Nr. 53 in the middle does the same. Nr. 45 still belongs to the older level. Farani (1486) did not differentiate between original text and com mentary. Both were fused into one and form a spiritual unity as well. Our example can be considered as belonging to the more narrowly defined school, to the actual doctrine of the Master, since it is in agreement with Nr. 41 and other remarks. The doctrine of Heinrich of Gent (d. 1293): "individua proprias ideas in deo non habent" is also the general view of the Muslim Neo-Platonists. According to this God perceives the individua in the type-concepts contained in Him, in that His guidance of the world is directed to these individua. A voluntarist-oriented Logos-doctrine is the solution among many liberal theologians, mystics such as Hallaj (mashi'a) and the teachings of Bab (Nicholas) Seyyid 'Aly Mohammed, Paris, 1905, 12 Note 1). Whoever seeks the current misconceptions about Islamic philo sophy will find in De Boer (Geschichte der Philosophie im Islam, 1901) those con cerning medieval thought. Avicenna's real conviction was supposedly articulated in his philosophy of illumination (incorrectly termed philosophia orientalis), that is, his mysticism. This was considered to represent a certain pantheism (denial of all substances out side of God; Maya - and Nirvana ideas). The mystics wanted to claim Avicenna's great authority for themselves, However the question remains open. Ibn Tufayl raised this issue and Averroes accepted the challenge (Renan, Averroes, p. 96, Note 2). In our day the legend of Averroes* alleged heresy does not call for any further refutation. Renan himself allows naive preconceptions of the Middle Ages as the source of this error. However he cannot free himself from the general opinion. Avicenna supposedly even denied "creation"! He only denied creation "in time" (ihdathu not however creation as such (jchalq). It is not possible to render both terms with "creatio". The claim: "God and matter are eternal. A creation from nothing, the favored idea of Oriental mysticism, is inconceivable", was attributed to the teaching of Avicenna (Dannemann, Die Naturwtssenschaften, pp. 2; 1, 313, 11). Matter here is perceived as something equally eternal with God. Materia Prima is an absolute potency and a metaphysical possibility. Averroes' thesis is the concept, formulated by Aristotelian methods, of a creation out of true nothingness from nothing real outside God. Creation but of nothing is not only not inconceivable,</page><page sequence="30">260 MAX HORTEN it is the only conceivable possibility in the question concerning the genesis of things, resulting from potency and act. Renan postulates (Averroes, p. 145 f) that Averroes denied immortality. At the same time he admits that Averroes claims the opposite in his refutation of Ghazali. According to Renan all philosophers (pp. 157, 2 etc.) have treated the Resurrection as a fable and thus denied it. However he allows (pp. 158,10) that Averroes taught: "The human soul in the afterlife takes on a body different from that which it occupied on earth, a body similar in species, but individually dis similar". It follows that Averroes believed in a continuation of personal life after death. The discussion revolved around the question as to whether the otherworldly body was numerically (thesis of the theologians) or only by species (thesis of the philosophers) the same as the earthly body. Man, inspite of the unity of the intel lectual substance of all men, represents an individual because of his earthly body so, after death he will represent just such an individual because of his other worldly body. Thus the personality endures after death. ssss</page></plain_text>
