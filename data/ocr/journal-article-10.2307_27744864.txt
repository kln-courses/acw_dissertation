<plain_text><page sequence="1">History of Philosophy Quarterly Volume 17, Number 4, October 2000 DESCARTES, THE DIVINE WILL AND THE IDEAL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL STABILITY Tom Sorell There is probably nothing more central to Descartes's philoso phy than his doctrine concerning God's will. It is central to his metaphysics. It is central also to his moral theory, with which his whole philosophy?the whole structure of metaphysics, physics, and the derivative sciences?is supposed to culminate. I shall be con cerned with the tensions in this doctrine. Many of these, perhaps most, arise from Descartes's attempt to formulate a metaphysics that would impress, or at least pacify, theologians, while at the same time quietly laying foundations for a physics that they would have disapproved of. Descartes's metaphysics was supposed to agree with such orthodoxies as that God was all-powerful, all good, the source of truth, the creator of the earth and the heavens. It was also intended to free the understanding of God's nature from the anthropomorphism of scripture, and the confining empiricism of the Thomists. It was supposed to put God beyond all analogies with the deities of the Greeks and Romans. It was supposed to do all of that while cohering with a mechanistic account of most of the cre ation, that is, with a mechanistic account of the heavens, the earth, and animals that was already complete in the form of the sup pressed le Monde. Finally, the account of God was supposed to cohere with what might respectably be said about the right ethical ends of human life, and the morally proper cultivation of the will and understanding. Descartes's ideas about how human beings might perfect themselves ethically and scientifically were all geared to the ideal constituted by God. In God, according to Descartes, the will and understanding are indistinguishable, and so are never at odds with one another. God constitutes reality by willing a certain order of what is true and 361</page><page sequence="2">362 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY what is good. This is "creation" in a sense wider than one finds in Genesis. What God creates is perfectly stable and never needs to be corrected or improved upon. Although God might have created any order, the one he actually creates is willed immutably. Human beings are supposed to try and suit their theoretical understanding and their practical choices to this order: when they succeed, they confine their theoretical judgments to what is intellectually evident rather than to what the senses make plausible, and they confine their practical choices to what reason permits or recommends?not to the promptings of appetite. This lessens the conflict between the human judgment and the human will, and undoes the subordina tion of the judgment to sensory impulse, leaving a judgment that grasps the true and a will that chooses the good to the fullest extent possible for human beings. Subjects who develop a judgment and a will along these lines are supposed to enjoy an ideally stable knowledge and contentment. It is this ideal of stability of mind, inherited from Descartes's theory of God's nature, that I want to suggest is suspect when transferred to human beings. Descartes believed that at its best?that is, when guided by Car tesian methods of controlling attention and arranging considerations in enquiry?the human grasp of truth was unshakeable. What he calls scientia excludes changes of mind, sudden doubts, belief now and disbelief later. Scientia, the state at which enquiry aims, is a steady, synoptic vision of an order of causes and effects. It con trasts with momentary, highly specific flashes of intuition both by being lasting and by unifying a lot of individually knowable things. To acquire scientia is to acquire stability of mind. Something simi lar is possible in the sphere of practical reason. There, too, stability is an ideal. In particular, a certain kind of firmness of will is essen tial to achieving the beatitude at which morality aims. So is a narrowing down of objects of desire to ones that are for the highest genuine goods and that are within one's power to attain. To the extent human beings succeed in disciplining the judgment in order to acquire scientia, and in disciplining the will in order to gain contentment, they develop a semblance of the immutable will and understanding of God. But this ideal of a mind that after the devel opment of an inner discipline never has to reconsider what is true or what it is aiming at by its actions, that overcomes its inclina tions to assent to the false and to pursue evil, competes in Descartes with another: the ideal of an enquirer who is helped to correct his mistakes by his readers, who does not close his mind to new expe rience, and who makes sure he weds himself to no one time or place or opinion without first sampling many others. The one ideal</page><page sequence="3">DESCARTES, DIVINE WILL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STABILITY 363 is represented by the subject of Descartes's autobiography in the Discours; the other by the subjects of Descartes's metaphysics and morals in the Meditations and later writings. I The main sources for Descartes's views about the divine will are some letters to Mersenne from 1630, the Meditations, the Replies to the First and Sixth Objections, the letters to Mesland (1644), and the Conversation with Burman.1 If there is one thesis that sums up everything he says in these places, it is that there is nothing independent of the divine will. This thesis has a compli cated sense. It bears first on God's nature as far as Descartes claims to understand it. That nature is, above all, simple and indis soluble (AT I 153; CSM III 25-26): this is crucial to God's being perfect (AT VII 50; CSM II 34). God's nature does not divide up into a will on the one hand and an understanding on the other. So there is no divine faculty that can be distinguished from the will. Nor are the effects of the divine will different from the truths the divine understanding grasps. Even the eternal truths are the ef fects of God's will (AT I 145; CSM III 23). Again, there is nothing distinct and external to the will that acts upon it or guides it (ibid.). God is causally self-sustaining (AT VII 109; CSM II 78). Nor does He act in the light of preexisting reasons or an order of rea sons (AT VII 432; CSM II 291). That would suggest that his will was subject to something. But it is not, not even in the sense that there are reasons for whatever God does that are decisive and that exclude the force of all reasons against whatever he omits to do.2 God enjoys a complete liberty of indifference, which is the leading indicator of his omnipotence (AT VII 432; CSM II 292). The most discussed element of the doctrine just summarized is God's relation to the eternal truths. This was one of the earliest products of Descartes's metaphysical reflection, and was clearly unorthodox as theology. Traditionally, that is, in Thomism, the eter nal truths were thought to have an existence in the divine understanding and were not subject to God's will. But for a doc trine to put anything outside God's power was, in Descartes's view, to belittle God, to turn him into one more merely powerful being such as one found in the Roman or Greek pantheon?certainly not the incomparably powerful being He was supposed to be. An order of truths apart from God was an order of truths to which God was subject, as if to the Fates (AT I 145; CSM III 23). The theological oddity of assigning the eternal truths to God's creation rather than</page><page sequence="4">364 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY God's essence, although it seemed to have disturbed Mersenne, on whom Descartes first tried it out, does not appear to have worried Descartes. On the contrary, he had found a way of connecting more orthodox Thomist doctrines about the eternal truths to pagan the ology, and his own views, apart from having some claim to be more pious than the orthodox ones, sat well with his project for a geo metrical physics. As Descartes explained in a letter of 1630 to Mersenne, the eternal truths just were the essences of created things (AT I 152; CSM III 25); so the created things-apart from minds?were mathematical as well as material. The creation itself? apart from minds?was physico-mathematical. The material simple natures and the natures of the triangle and circle were not worlds apart, as the forms of substances and geometrical abstractions were for Aristotle: they were equal members of the natural order. It was one thing for Descartes to put forward a highly revision ary doctrine of the eternal truths in his letters to Mersenne in 1630. It was another to keep the doctrine from having untoward consequences in the context of the Meditations, ten years later. Between 1630, when he briefly took up and then abandoned the idea of a metaphysical treatise, corresponding with Mersenne about its ideas, and 1640, when he was working in earnest on the book that would become the Meditations, Descartes was fully occupied first with writing a physics treatise?Le Monde?and then, after 1633, with the task of creating a friendly audience to receive it when it was published.3 As is well known, Le Monde contained a doctrine about the movement of the earth similar to the one that had led to Galileo's condemnation, and Descartes decided to hold back its publication. The Discours and Essais was intended to cre ate a demand for the release of Le Monde, or at least to raise questions from readers that would give Descartes a pretext for releasing it. Throughout the Essais, but especially in la Dioptrique and the Discours, there are hints about a comprehensive doctrine of the nature of light, as well as findings in physiology and medi cine, that Descartes might reasonably have expected questions about from his scientific readers, questions he could have answered by releasing Le Monde. For theologians and scientifically minded teach ers at Catholic schools?Descartes personally sent copies of the Discours and Essais to teachers at La Fleche and other colleges?he told a story in the Discours about how his studies in the sciences began with and depended on some metaphysical reflections that included a proof of God's existence. But the Discours and Essais did not have quite the reception that Descartes hoped for. Theolo gians would not endorse Descartes's doctrines until they had heard</page><page sequence="5">DESCARTES, DIVINE WILL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STABILITY 365 more about its metaphysics, and his findings in optics, meteorol ogy, and geometry attracted more objections than requests for elaboration. The Meditations was Descartes's attempt to enlarge on Part Four of the Discours. Up to a point, it imitated treatises that Mersenne had published in the 1620s. From Mersenne Descartes seems to have borrowed the general strategy of responding to a general skepticism about the sciences. But the Meditations also continued Descartes's project of reforming the sciences, and it in cluded, between the lines, would-be demonstrations of the principles of a new, radically anti-Aristotelian physics. The doctrine of God's will makes an early appearance in the Meditations, but not in the form of a theory specifically about God's relation to the eternal truths. It surfaces as the long-standing opinion that there is an omnipotent God who made me the kind of creature that I am. How do I know that he has not brought it about that there is no earth, no sky, no shape, no size, no place, while at the same time ensuring that all these things appear to me to exist just as they do now? What is more, since I sometimes believe that others go astray in cases where they think they have the most perfect knowledge, may I not similarly go wrong every time I add two and three or count the sides of a square, or in some even simpler matter, if that is imaginable? (AT VII 21; CSM II 14) The supposition of a God who would allow me to be deceived is at first sight strengthened by Descartes's views about the eternal truths. For if the eternal truths are subject to God's will, why can God not decide to make it false whenever he pleases that 2+3=5? It is clear why Descartes cannot welcome this possibility: the human mind cannot help assenting to the proposition that 2+3=5; if it suddenly became false, the human mind would unavoidably go wrong even in what it could not help believing?precisely what God's existence is supposed to rule out in the Meditations. How, if at all, does Descartes rule out this unwanted possibility without taking back the claim that God has power even over the truth-values of mathematical truths? Will it get him out of trouble simply to insist on the immu tability of the will? It seems not, and for a reason that is suggested by recent controversies over rule following and Wittgenstein. For God to make it true at one time that 2+3=5 and false later is not necessarily for God to will two different things, and so change his mind. Instead, he can will one complicated thing?from the begin ning. Thus, if God was free at the beginning to create any order of the true and the good, then he was free at the beginning to set an order that began with giving his creatures everything and that ended by taking it all away. This order is hard to distinguish from</page><page sequence="6">366 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY one in which God starts by giving everything and then changes his mind entirely. In the same way, God could have decreed at the beginning that 2 and 3 add up to 5 for the first two millennia and add up to 6 thereafter, without ever changing his mind. So immu tability does not necessarily do the work Descartes expects of it, even if?and Descartes does not really prove it?God's will is immu table. The game is up when Descartes compares the creation of the eternal truths to laying down a law or rule, for there is an indeter minacy in the concept of following the same rule. The immutability of God's will is not Descartes's only line of defense against error in beliefs that are self-evident. There is also the idea that a God who was perfect would not allow us to go wrong in what seemed most evident to our minds. Or, to come at the same conclusion from a different direction, standing highest on the scale of being, God would not be the author of any nonbeing or tend toward any (AT VII 428; CSM II 289), and so would have no hand in making arithmetical falsehood (cf. AT VII 144; CSM II 103). In appealing to these considerations, Descartes tried to make his doc trine of created eternal truths mesh with the assumptions and jargon of his theologian contemporaries. But it is doubtful that the strategy works, and for two reasons. First, Descartes's own claims about God's nature were hedged about with pious professions of God's incomprehensibility and incomparability. God's incomprehen sibility was supposed to be consistent with God's intelligibility, but the distinction between incomprehensibility and intelligibility is open to opportunistic redrawing. By the incomprehensibility of God Descartes meant a human inability to have a synoptic and compre hensive understanding. It was something else to have no purchase at all on God's nature: Descartes believed that human beings had some grasp of the nature of God. But how much authority did this denial have? Certainly only as much as Descartes's fragile distinc tion between intelligibility and comprehensibility. Secondly, the supposedly intelligible attributes of God were sometimes at odds with things attributed to the Almighty by stories in scripture. Descartes no doubt believed that a priori theology stood apart from the scriptural tradition and overrode it where there was a conflict (AT VII 142; CSM II 102); but there was no reason for his theolo gian contemporaries to think the same, and it was naive of Descartes to suppose that he could pick and choose elements of the theologi cal rhetoric available to him and still carry conviction. Divine deception seemed a possibility to several sets of objectors to the Meditations, including objectors who were theologians. Thus the authors of the Second Objections:</page><page sequence="7">DESCARTES, DIVINE WILL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STABILITY 367 [Y]ou say that God cannot lie or deceive. Yet there are some schoolmen who say he can. Gabriel, for example, and Ariminensis, among others, think that in the absolute sense God does lie, that is, communicate to men things which are opposed to his intentions and decrees. Thus he unconditionally said to the people of Nineveh, through the prophet, 'Yet forty days and Nineveh shall be destroyed/ And he said many other things which certainly did not occur, be cause he did not mean his words to correspond to his intentions and decrees. Now if God hardened Pharaoh's heart and blinded his eyes, and if he sent upon his prophets the spirit of untruthfulness, how do you conclude that we cannot be deceived by him? Cannot God treat men as a doctor treats the sick, or a father his children? In both cases there is frequent deception though it is always em ployed beneficially and with wisdom. (AT VII 125; CSM II 89-90) In the Sixth Objections, there is similarly a doubt based on your uncompromising assertion that no deception is to be found in God. Now very many theologians believe that the damned, both angels and men, are continually deceived by the idea of a tormenting fire which God has implanted in them; thus they most firmly believe, and think they see and perceive very clearly, that they are really being tormented by the fire, even though there is no such fire. May not God, then, deceive us with similar ideas and continually delude us by sending such semblances or ideas into our souls? . . . God can do this without any wrong or injustice, since he is the supreme Lord of all things and has the absolute power to deal with creatures as he wishes, especially when his actions may serve to humble the pride of men and punish them for their sins, either because of original sin or because of other causes which are hidden from us. (AT VII 415; CSM II 280) Descartes had hoped to avoid having to clash openly with the schoolmen in the Meditations. He hoped that by adopting those pieces of their apparatus that he could turn to his own purposes, he would be taken for a holder of orthodox views himself. Certainly he does not throw into prominence in the argument of the Medita tions his views about God's power over the eternal truths. But it seems to me that he did not anticipate opposition to the idea that God could not be a deceiver. And when the doctrine was called into question, he could only counterbalance, not refute, the claims of his critics. For example, in his Replies to the First Objections, he first dis tinguishes the scriptural account of God (which is relative to the human understanding) from a philosophical account such as his own (which is not relative), and then reinterprets the passages of scripture on which his critics relied (AT VII 142-143; CSM II 102). The most this does is to show that scripture can be interpreted so</page><page sequence="8">368 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY that God is cleared of deception. It does not show that such decep tion is impossible, or that a wise purpose couldn't justify it if it were possible. The same can be said about the replies to the Sixth Objections, where the bulk of Descartes's response to the point about God and deception is taken up with scriptural interpretation, and the remainder traces the impossibility of God's deceiving to his never tending to nonbeing. Although the point about nonbeing would have been intended to appear as a scholastic truism, it would have had no great force, given the existence of so many commonplaces to the contrary, including those cited by the authors of the Sixth Objections. Descartes does not seem to have realized that his replies might seem inconclusive. On the contrary, in the same self-confident tones in which he announced to Mersenne in 1630 that he had found how to prove metaphysical truths with more certainty than the truths of geometry, he proclaimed that in the Meditations and Replies to Objections he had demonstrated that his own philosophy was bet ter adapted than Aristotelianism to be the official philosophy of Catholicism. As he wrote to Mersenne on 31 March 1641, You will see that in [my reply to M. Arnauld's objections! I recon cile the doctrine of the Councils about the Sacrament with my own philosophy?so much so that I maintain that it is impossible to give a satisfactory explanation of the doctrine by means of the tradi tional philosophy. Indeed, I think that the latter would have been rejected as clashing with the Faith if mine had been known first. I swear to you in all seriousness that it is as I say. So I have decided not to keep silent on the matter, and to fight with their own weap ons the people who confound Aristotle with the Bible and abuse the authority of the Church in order to vent their passions?I mean the people who had Galileo condemned. They would have my views condemned likewise if they had the power; but if there is ever any question of that, I am confident that I can show that none of the tenets of their philosophy accords with the Faith so well as my doctrines. (AT III 349-50; CSM III 177) And a few years later he was writing to Mesland that "if people were a little more used to my way of philosophising, they could be shown a way of explaining this mystery [of the extension of Jesus Christ in the sacrament] which would stop the mouths of the en emies of our religion so that they could say nothing against it" ( AT IV 120; CSM III 235-36). I think that in order to understand Descartes's confidence in 1630 concerning the acceptability of his doctrine of the divine will, and his confidence in the 1640s in the consistency of Cartesianism with Ca</page><page sequence="9">DESCARTES, DIVINE WILL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STABILITY 369 tholicism, we need to consider what he supposed was wrong with the traditional philosophy in relation to God's nature, and by what stan dards he himself was judging the orthodoxy of his own philosophy. The short answer to the question of what Descartes thought was wrong with traditional philosophy?Thomism?in relation to God's nature, was that it had to make that nature accessible to an empiri cist theory of understanding. It had to rely on the human imagination to extrapolate God's attributes from the attributes of human be ings. It therefore impiously anthropomorphized God. Descartes's theory avoids anthropomorphism in a particularly thoroughgoing way. Not only does it deny that a grasp of human attributes is a sound basis for an inference to God's attributes; it denies that God's attributes are even separable. God's nature, whatever it is, is perfectly simple, while human nature is composite. Indeed, in or der for us to raise our idea of God to consciousness we have in a sense to neutralize part of that composite nature, and therefore detach ourselves from the idea of human nature We have to doubt away our body and our senses and bring into operation an autono mous mind and the ideas available to it when sense-based ideas, including the ideas delivered by the internal senses, are subtracted. The autonomous mind and its innate ideas are the basis for getting in touch with God's nature, and this is what we get when we go from human nature to the res cogitans latent in the human being. The autonomous mind is not specifically human, which is why it can stand in the same scale of being as God. But though it stands in the same scale of being, it is rather lowly in that scale. By contrast with God, it is both finite and less than simple, being a composite of faculties of intellect and will. Nevertheless, its will is made in the image of God's. We are created in the image of God not in the sense that our attributes resemble God's but that we and he can be located in a single scale with a perfect substance at the top and us as finite minds somewhere below it. Now this radically non-anthropomorphic framework for understanding God turns out to be intelligible in exactly the way that it is possible to get beyond sensible qualities and forms of material things to the variety of extension and motion. The ideas of the material and mathematical natures are not sensory but innate, and they are raised to con sciousness by the very same means as the idea of God is. In the traditional philosophy the senses are the crucial conduit for the materials of natural explanation. And this is the very thing that makes them dubitable. A sense-based philosophy of God's nature could not fail to be dubitable in its turn. Dubitable as well as impi ous, since it modeled God on man.</page><page sequence="10">370 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY Turning now to the standards by which Descartes judged the religious orthodoxy of his own philosophy, we have already seen from the letters to Mersenne and Mesland that the ability of his metaphysics to deal with puzzles over the sacraments was an im portant reason for thinking that it could be made the official philosophy of Catholicism. Beyond this, there is the way in which God stands first in the order of causes; the way in which knowl edge of God is a condition of scientific knowledge of anything else; the way in which knowledge of the hierarchy of perfections, and therefore of goods, depends on knowledge of God; and the way in which Descartes is able to recover the ideas that we are made in the image of God and are put here to worship him. In what remains of this paper I am going to argue that Descartes's success in placing God at the center of nature, knowledge, and life was mixed, for two reasons. First, he presented versions of his philosophy?in the Discours for example?in which so little is said about God that the role of God in the system seems marginal. This raises the question of whether God really is central to Descartes's system. Second, and to come to what I will be concentrating upon? when God is center-stage, the concepts of human knowledge and of the human pursuit of the good that God underpins seem artificial. The kind of knowledge that depends on God and on knowledge of God is scientia. But Descartes admits that there is a lesser knowl edge and that this is open even to the atheist. Why is not this lesser knowledge sufficient for a kind of science, even if it is not Cartesian scientia? A similar question arises about the provisional morality that Descartes is able to adopt independently of meta physical investigation. Evidently this is a prescientific form of morality, and probably heavily reliant on the anthropomorphized vi sion of God in scripture and ordinary religious teaching. If this suffices for right action, and if there are virtuous people who conduct them selves admirably without knowing Descartes's science of morals, why should a metaphysically informed moral science be necessary? II The Meditations provides a proof, in the face of skepticism about all of learning, that scientia is possible for human beings (see esp. AT VII 69, 71 ; CSM II 48, 49). Scientia is a special kind of knowl edge. It is systematic knowledge of a lot of related truths. So it contrasts with intuitions of single truths. Intuitions of single truths are knowledge; and so long as the attention is fixed, intuitions do not depend for their certainty on knowledge of God; but the atten tion naturally wanders, and the certainty of any one truth can be</page><page sequence="11">DESCARTES, DIVINE WILL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STABILITY 371 shaken by the principles for calling into question whole classes of belief that Descartes introduces in Meditation One (AT VII 18; CSM II 12). So intuition needs to be backed up by something that can overturn those principles: namely the certainty that God exists and is no deceiver. Scientia is knowledge of a system of physico mathematico truths that incorporates this assurance against general uncertainty. And crucially, once it is arrived at, it is not open to reconsideration through doubt, not even through the doubt that our minds might be defective.4 Scientia is an unshakeable vision of a system of truth because it is a vision that includes scientia that God exists and is no deceiver. Being unshakeable and true it re sembles divine knowledge itself. God could not know now and later lose his knowledge, for he wills all that is eternally true all at once and for all time and cannot fail to know what is therefore willed to be true for all time. In other words, God's knowledge is unshakeable. Of course human scientia and divine scientia differ much more than they resemble one another. To the extent we have scientia it is by disciplining the attention, ordering its objects from simple to complex, and getting used to seeing totalities in the light of the simple. God's purchase on the objects of scientia is entirely differ ent. For one thing, those objects are his creations, and he knows the natures of things by deciding what they will be, not by fixing his attention on them. If God's immutability is both a model for human scientia and something we have to be aware of in order to acquire scientia, cannot Descartes claim with justice to have made knowledge of God essential to the knowledge of nature, just as the theologians would have wanted him to do? The claim has some, but only some, plausibility in the context of the Meditations, as we shall see. But it is much weaker in connection with the Discours and Essais and even weaker in Le Monde. Let us stick to the Discours. Not only does Descartes pass very quickly over metaphysical truths in Part Four of the Discours, allowing the reader to infer from the brevity of his treatment that they do not matter much, but he also makes the very striking claim that the evident adequacy of the explana tions of things in la Dioptrique and the M?t?ores is on its own a proof of the principles of Cartesian natural science put forward in at least the two first Essais. This is how we might understand the following famous passage from the end of the Discours. Should anyone be shocked at first by some of the statements I make at the beginning of the Optics and Meteorology because I call them "suppositions" and do not seem to care about proving them, let him have the patience to read the whole book attentively, and I</page><page sequence="12">372 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY trust that he will be satisfied. For I take my reasonings to be so closely interconnected that just as the last are proved by the first, so the first are proved by the last, which are their effects. It must not be supposed that I am here committing the fallacy that the logicians call "arguing in a circle." For as experience makes most of these effects quite certain, the causes from which I deduce them serve not so much to prove them as to explain them; indeed, quite to the contrary, it is the causes which are proved by the effects. (AT VI 76; CSM I 150) In the same vein, there is this passage from the letter to Mersenne of 27 May 1638: You ask if I regard what I have written about refraction as a dem onstration. I think it is, in so far as one can be given in a field without a previous demonstration of the principles of physics by metaphysics?which is something I hope to do some day but which has not yet been done?and so far as it has ever been possible to demonstrate the solution to any problem of mechanics, or optics, or astronomy, or anything else which is not pure geometry or arith metic. But to require me to give geometrical demonstrations on a topic that depends on physics is to ask me to do the impossible. And if you will not call anything demonstrations except geometers' proofs, then you must say that Archimides never demonstrated anything in mechanics, or Vitellio in optics, or Ptolemy in astronomy. But of course nobody says this. In such matters people are satisfied if the authors' assumptions are not obviously contrary to experi ence and if their discussion is coherent and free from logical error, even though their assumptions may not be strictly true. I could demonstrate, for instance, that even the definition of the centre of gravity given by Archimedes is false, and that there is no such centre; and the other assumptions he makes elsewhere are not strictly true either . . . but that is not a sufficient reason for rejecting the demonstrations. (AT II 141-142; CSM III 103) Demonstrations can be demonstrative, that is, if they meet condi tions far less exacting than those for metaphysical certainty. Or, in other words, there can be science without scientia. Now it might be thought that whatever concessions are made to science lacking in metaphysical certainty in the Discours and Essais, these concessions would be withdrawn in the Meditations. But this is not quite what one finds. If anyone lacks metaphysical certainty, according to the principles in the Meditations, it is someone who is ignorant of God's existence, or someone who denies it: an atheist. But does the atheist necessarily lack knowledge or science? More than one set of objectors thought this was implausible (cf. AT VII 124; CSM II 89; AT VII 414; CSM II 279), and the replies do not entirely disagree. Just as there can be a genuine demonstration</page><page sequence="13">DESCARTES, DIVINE WILL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STABILITY 373 that involves some incidental falsehood and that lacks metaphysi cal grounding, so there can be a kind of grasp of truth available even to those who think there is no God. Descartes never even denied that in some sense of "knowledge" the atheist could have knowledge; what he denied was that the atheist could have the preferred kind of knowledge called scientia: The fact that an atheist can be "clearly aware that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles" is something I do not dispute. But I maintain that this awareness of his is not true knowl edge, since no act of awareness that can be rendered doubtful seems fit to be called knowledge. (AT VII 141; CSM II 101) As for the kind of knowledge possessed by the atheist, it is easy to demonstrate that it is not immutable and certain. (AT VII 428; CSM II 289) As if knowledge that was not immutable or incapable of being re considered critically could not really be knowledge. All we need interpret Descartes as saying is that the atheist is bound to lack scientia?the ideal kind of knowledge. We do not need to interpret him as saying that scientia is the only knowledge there is. The category of non-ideal knowledge has an interesting range of application. Apart from the atheist, it extends to the scientifically open-minded believer who does not know Descartes's metaphysics, including churchmen who were instructed in optics and meteorol ogy by the Essais and would have been instructed by Le Monde in physics. More important, it applies to Descartes himself before he discovered his proofs of metaphysical truths in 1630. The fact that Descartes himself had only imperfect knowledge before 1630 may show that the scientific discoveries he made before 1630 were not scientia in the sense of the Meditations. But surely they counted as science. The fact that these discoveries might have been rendered doubtful or disputed by critics does not seem to make them count any less as science, just as the fact that the demonstrations of Archimedes might be corrected does not show that they were not demonstrations. On the contrary it is the honorific sense of "sci ence"?science in the sense of scientia?and the honorific sense of "demonstration"?"demonstration" in the sense of geometrical dem onstration?that seems unduly narrow or stipulative?even, at times, from Descartes's own point of view as scientist. Up to a point this narrowness is the direct result of the grounding of Descartes's science in the doctrine of God's nature.5 The point can be made in a different way, which helps to intro duce a parallel between the development of Descartes's views about</page><page sequence="14">374 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY the theoretical and practical sciences. Before 1630?before science was metaphysically grounded?Descartes may be said to have devel oped a merely provisional philosophy of science broadly analogous to the morale par provision of the Discours. The provisional phi losophy of science is permissive about what to include as science. It includes the imperfect demonstrations of Archimides and Ptolemy. The official or strict philosophy of science is the theologically correct one in which scientia is the human counterpart of divine knowledge. It excludes discoveries that can be rendered doubtful or that contain elements of falsehood and probably only contains the Cartesian sci ences. The more restrictive philosophy of science is not necessarily a better or even more authentically Cartesian philosophy of science. Ill If scientia is the ideal in the sphere of theoretical knowledge in spired by the divine mind, then beatitude is the corresponding ideal in the practical sphere. Descartes's views about beatitude and about the highest good emerge in a series of letters to royal corre spondents. Princess Elizabeth was one of these. Descartes wrote to her about morals several times in the late summer and autumn of 1645, and a very important letter of 20 November 1647 to Queen Christina of Sweden enlarges on the nature of the highest good. Some of the theses sketched in these letters are taken up in The Passions of the Soul. All of this material contributes to Descartes's scientific presentation of morals, though there is no definitive or even finished formulation of a Cartesian moral philosophy. The morale par provision, on the other hand, is sketched in the Discours. It is prescientific or provisional partly because its precepts raise ques tions that only a metaphysics could answer. In this respect the precepts of morality are like the precepts of Descartes's "method" in Part Two of the Discours, and the assumptions it makes about demonstration. There were four rules in Descartes's provisional morality (AT VI 23-27; CSM I 122-124). The first was to follow the laws and cus toms of his country and to practice his religion, and to be guided in other matters according to the most moderate opinions of the most sensible people with which he would be living. The second was to be firm and decisive in his actions and not to reconsider opinions once they were adopted. The third was to try to become master over what was really in his control, treating things that could not be changed or that had failed to be changed after his best efforts as impossible. The fourth was to choose the best of human occupations for himself.</page><page sequence="15">DESCARTES, DIVINE WILL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STABILITY 375 The rules of Descartes's mature moral philosophy were formu lated for Princess Elizabeth in a letter from 4 August 1645: The first is that [each person] should always apply his mind as well as he can to discover what he should do or should not do in all of the circumstances of life. The second is that he should have a firm and constant resolution to carry out whatever reason recommends without being diverted by his passions or appetites. Virtue, I believe, consists precisely in sticking firmly to this resolution. The third is that he should bear in mind that while he thus guides himself as far as he can, by reason, all the good things which he does not possess are one and all entirely outside his power. (AT IV 265-266; CSM III 257-58) Laporte has suggested that the difference between the two sets of precepts is obvious once they are compared: it is the role assigned to reason.6 But it could equally reasonably be said that in the more mature formulation a whole range of terms?"mind," "passion," "good," as well as the phrase "carry out a resolution"?are endowed with senses heavily influenced by the Meditations. In particular, the doctrine of God's nature plays a role. This emerges in a letter to Elizabeth written only a couple of weeks after the one just quoted, and also in the important letter to Queen Christina of 1647. Let us consider these letters in turn. Writing to Elizabeth on 18 August 1645, Descartes comments on a book of Seneca's that he has got Elizabeth to read. He expresses dissatisfaction with many of Seneca's formulations, and when he tries to supply a sense for the important claim in Seneca that "a happy life is one that ac cords with nature" he hits on an interpretation that is very plainly Cartesian: For undoubtedly by "nature" [Seneca] does not mean our natural inclinations, seeing that they ordinarily lead us to pursue pleasure, which he is against; but the rest of his discussion makes me think that by "nature" he means the order established by God in all the things that are in the world. Considering this order to be infallible and independent of our will, he says that "wisdom consists in agree ing with the nature of things and in conforming to the law and example of nature" that is to say, wisdom is acquiescing in the order of things, and doing those things for which we believe our selves to be born; or rather, to use a Christian way of speaking, wisdom is a submission to the will of God, and following it in all our actions. ( AT IV 273; CSM II 260)</page><page sequence="16">376 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY It is Descartes rather than Seneca who identifies nature with an infallible order laid down by God; and though the idea of submis sion to the will of God is not distinctively Cartesian, Descartes's explication of it?which I take to be given by his third rule?cer tainly is. The third rule says that people should be content with the goods they have, and treat all others as entirely outside their power. This is submitting to the will of God since it is He who decides the distribution of goods, as He decides everything else that is given to us.7 But there is more to the idea of being content with the goods one has than the idea of submission. There is also the idea of a good that really belongs to one, which belongs to Descartes's metaphysics. As the letter of 1647 to Christina shows, Descartes has a whole theory of the different goods and which are worth more than oth ers, and this theory implies that the greatest good we have is free will itself, which we have only to use well to have beatitude. I observe also that the greatness of a good should not be measured only by the value of the thing which constitutes it but principally also by the manner in which it is related to us. Now free will is in itself the noblest thing we can have, since it makes us in a way equal to God and seems to exempt us from being his subjects; and so its correct use is the greatest of all the goods we possess; indeed there is nothing that is more our own or that matters more to us. From all of this it follows that nothing but free will can produce our greatest happiness. Moreover, the peace of mind and inner satisfaction felt by those who always do their best to discover what is good and to acquire it is, we see, a pleasure incomparably sweeter, more lasting and more solid than all those which come from else where. (AT V 85; CSM III 326) The good use of the free will is to discipline choice by reason, and the effect of it is supposed to be to deliver the agent from regret or avoidable desire. Or to put it another way, the good human use of the free will is like God's use of his own will: Like God, the human agent who uses his free will properly never has a reason to recon sider his choices; and the discipline or habit of gearing choice to what one has reason to do is the closest that human beings come to fusing the will and judgment and reproducing in themselves the simplicity of God's nature. I am trying to suggest that the rules of Descartes's moral sci ence are rules for submitting to God's order in things that are independent of the human will and for imitating God in things that are dependent on the human will. But the idea that most or every thing that is required for morality can be worked out by reason alone, in the light of Descartes's metaphysics of God's nature, human</page><page sequence="17">DESCARTES, DIVINE WILL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STABILITY 377 nature, and the goods each can possess, while clearly having some claim to be theologically impressive, seems wildly implausible. No wonder that Princess Elizabeth was skeptical about the applicabil ity of Descartes's rules, even when Descartes had supplemented these with "useful truths." In the end Descartes admitted that, after examination, local customs (AT IV 295; CSM III 267) might provide guidance, and the consultation of conscience was neces sary in practice for deciding how to strike the balance between personal and social obligations (AT IV 316; CSM III 273). At this point the scientific morals reverts to a considerable extent to con tent of the prescientific morals. How far is the artificiality of Descartes's highly rationalist ac count of morality aggravated by his modeling the good free will on the divine will? Descartes seems to me to exaggerate the value of resoluteness to morality and to underestimate the moral value of public criticism of one's actions. If the main aim of the precepts of morality were to deliver one from regret or indecision, then the habits of decision making that Descartes wants people to develop would indeed be invaluable. But it seems that delivering people from regret or indecision is secondary in a moral science to telling people what it is right or wrong to do. After all, freedom from indecision or regret could be enjoyed by someone who was morally very complacent or nihilistic. If freedom from indecision or regret is to be valuable, it must be a freedom owed to having done the right thing or to having done one's best to do the right thing, not to nihilism or complacency. But it seems a criterion of trying to do the right thing that one be willing to question one's motives and that one be willing to defend one's practical reasoning if what one does is questioned. Being open to criticism is precisely being open to the possibility of feeling regret if a good criticism is made. If it is desirable to leave oneself open to regret, it is not desirable to have a moral science that tells one to make one's decisions and then move on, confident that one has done one's best. Modeling human moral decision making on God's irrevisable decision mak ing is likely to put healthy openness to criticism in a bad light?making it look like the indecision of someone who does not know which goods are real and which are not. People who gear their decisions to a scale of perfections of mind and body, who develop a habit of judging according to that scale, and who succeed in avoiding any regrets might be imitating God in trying to reach decisions they never have to reconsider, but, by the same token, they may lack the moral humility that we admire in</page><page sequence="18">378 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY confessional writing and self-critical autobiography. This alterna tive to Cartesian rationalistic resoluteness would not have struck even his contemporaries as impious, and indeed it may have more of a claim to piety, since it does not encourage an unbecoming overconfidence in knowing right from wrong, and since it does not privatize moral judgment too much, inviting correction from the church and from the wider community. There are worse things than being uncertain in morals, or in seeing that one has to change one's opinions. The same is true in the theoretical sciences. Unshakeable certainty in physics or math ematics is intelligible as an ideal, of course, especially if divine scientia sets the pattern for human cognitive perfection. But open ness to the opinions of others at least as intent as oneself on the truth is also consistent with a program of enlarging knowledge. In the Discours Descartes seems to have been keen to display such an open-mindedness, since he invited objections to his doctrines and promised to respond to them. This open-mindedness seems to have been more than a pose, moreover, as Descartes does seem to have seen the value of the work of his contemporaries?Harvey, for ex ample, or Galileo, even Hobbes when it came to civil science. A different emphasis on unshakeable certainty, privately arrived at, seems to have started with the composition of the Meditations. I have tried to trace the change of emphasis to a theory of God's nature introduced to please the theologians. Philosophically, I have been arguing, it was a change for the worse.

It is true that in the passages just quoted, as at the very end of Meditation 5, Descartes is under the influence of the Platonic idea that while true beliefs can come and go, knowledge has got to be stable and fixed, tied down by the reasons for it. The idea is given a distinctively Cartesian gloss when stability is understood in terms of immutability of mind, and where the ideal mind is the immutable mind par excellence God's. To the extent that Descartes's scientific practice requires a less metaphysically grounded philosophy of science than he constructed to please the theologians, to that extent, and I would say it is a considerable extent, Descartes can be said to have failed to make Cartesianism a better ally of Catholicism than Thomism. 6.
