<plain_text><page sequence="1">PLUTARCH'S DE ANIMAE PROCREATIONE IN TIMAEO : MANIPULATION OR SEARCH FOR CONSISTENCY? JAN OPSOMER I. Introduction Different kinds of prejudice have come into play when scholars have assessed Plutarch as a philosopher. There have been those who in their hearts were Neoplatonists and stigmatised the Chaeronean for the heresy of immanentism.1 Not only is this criticism based on an anachronistic and dogmatic approach to the history of Platonism, it also stems from an uncritical acceptance of doxographic reports by Proclus and his ilk on the philosophy of the Chaeronean and other so-called Middle Platonists.2 Some would rather believe the damaging remarks by Neoplatonists than attempt a careful interpretation of Plutarch's extant philosophical works. Eclecticism is another label that has stuck for a long time to the philosophy of Plutarch.3 Several of Plutarch's moral precepts can easily be mistaken for Stoic teaching and he frequently borrows metaphors, arguments and examples from other schools (though rarely without giving them a Platonic twist). One should not underestimate, however, the influence of Hegelians such as E. Zeller, who for a long time dominated the historiography of ancient philosophy. Eclecticism happened to occupy a specific position in a dialectical template: thesis and antithesis had to be followed by a synthesis - in this case, dogmatism, scepticism, and eclecticism, respectively. Later the Hegelian colouring was forgotten, but the idea that Plutarch was an eclectic remained.4 A third kind of prejudice is mainly due to the man who, more than anyone, has advanced our understanding of the exegetical texts of Plutarch. It is H. Cherniss who depicts Plutarch as a Platonic interpreter manipulating the texts so as to make them suit his own interests.5 Measuring Plutarch's against his own interpretation, Cherniss claims 1 Cf. Dorne 1957, 217; 1971, 53, and the reply by De Vogel 1983, 283-287, which is based, however, on a partial misunderstanding of Plutarch's position. For accurate and fair assessments of this issue, see Donini 1992, 103; Ferrari 2002. 2 Cf. Opsomer 2001. 3 Cf., eg. Ziegler 1951, col. 938, 64-939, 4. 4 On this label see Donini 1988, 23. 5 Cherniss 1976, 137-138 (This theory of his, despite all narrow literalism and despite his protest against interpreting Plato for the promotion of one's own doctrines (1013b), was not the consequence of his literal interpretation of the Timaeus , but was the formulation of his own theology and theodicy, which [...] required the 'creation' in the Timaeus to be taken literally. This is indicated by the very reasons that he here gives for adopting this interpretation (1013e-f and 1015a-e) and even more clearly by his way of manipulating Platonic texts to support it.'); 147 ('His motive was not strict fidelity to Plato's words but concern to enlist Plato's GREEK, ARABIC, AND LATIN COMMENTARIES 137</page><page sequence="2">138 GREEK, ARABIC, AND LATIN COMMENTARIES that Plutarch quite often draws illicit inferences from the Platonic texts. Plutarch's interpretation allegedly contradicts the text of Plato on crucial points. And what is worse, Plutarch is said to offend against his own hermeneutic principles. The picture that emerges of Plutarch as a commentator, is that of a manipulator promoting his own doctrines6 while presenting them as literal interpretations of Plato. It is these charges that I shall examine here. In order to do so, I shall first explain the main lines of Plutarch's interpretation of the Timaeus , and clarify the hermeneutic principles on which it is based. My reading of Plutarch's essay will be more favourable to Plutarch than that of Cherniss. I will show that Plutarch's reading can be seen as an attempt to establish consistency between those doctrinal elements that he holds to be the most essential tenets of Plato's cosmogony. II. Hermeneutic principles In order to get an idea of some of the assumptions underlying Plutarch's reading of the Timaeus I suggest that we take a look at the conclusions of a work that examines exactly this, and has the further advantage of antedating Cherniss' preoccupation with Plutarch's exegetical works. This is J. Helmer's dissertation on the De animae procreatione from 1937, a monograph that has been unduly ignored and that starts from the question: 4 How did Plutarch arrive at his interpretation?' Against the prevailing trend of scholarship of his day, Helmer emphasises Plutarch's acumen. The Chaeronean was a master at combining passages and exploiting the Wortlaut of Plato's text. This brings us to two important characteristics of Plutarch's interpretations: (1) it is assumed that Plato's works express (different parts of) the same doctrinal system;7 (2) Plutarch displays an extraordinary literal-mindedness when interpreting specific phrases, passages, and dialogues.8 I would like to point out that in both of these respects Plutarch was far from unique among his contemporaries. The two assumptions mentioned are actually at the root of most if not all Middle and Neoplatonic readings of Plato. Plutarch's interpretation of the Timaeus is no exception. I intend to show that, given these hermeneutic principles, Plutarch's interpretation is not so far-fetched as it may seem at first sight. His claims are never without some basis in the text. Before I address the arguments put forward by Cherniss and repeated by others in order to show that Plutarch's reading lacks consistency and is manipulative, I shall sketch authority for the proposition that the universe was brought into being by god'); 149 ('it shows how Plutarch could manipulate for his own purpose philosophical texts still available for comparison with his treatment of them and what arbitrariness and contradictions are involved in an attempt to prove Platonic the dogma of 'creation' as an historical beginning'). It is for this view that Cherniss is quoted in, eg., Donini's survey of Middle Platonism (1994, 5069, n. 160). Donini himself gives a carefully balanced assessment of Plutarch's exegetical merits {ibid.). 6 Compare Ferrari 2000a, 155; 158; yet see also his valuable observations in Ferrari and Baldi 2002, 30-31. 7 See also Baltes 1976, 39-45; Donini 1994, 5069; Ferrari 2000a, 169. 8 Helmer 1937, esp. 66-70. Additionally (71-73), Helmer points to some ideological assumptions of Plutarch, alleging that they determined the latter' s interpretation of Plato: (1) because of his belief in a personal God Plutarch was predisposed to take the talk of a demiurge literally; (2) he shared the 'typically Greek' conviction that matter is uncreated and eternal; (3) he had to assume an evil soul, as, because of his awareness of evil inherent in the world, he needed a primordial evil being (p. 73). It should be said that in this list some of Helmer's own assumptions shine through: not to understand the Timaeus literally and not to assume the uncreatedness of matter seem to be the default views. Plutarch's need for an evil soul may not be due to existential anxiety, but could be attributable purely to his understanding of specific passages, as I hope to show. Plutarch's propensity towards dualist views is another matter, of course, yet here, too, his familiarity with specific trends in Platonic scholarship may be as important as his affinity with the Zeitgeist.</page><page sequence="3">OPSOMER: PLUTARCH 139 the outline of Plutarch's overall interpretation in De animae procreatione , not, however, without first having said a few words about the type of text that we are dealing with. III. Literary genre and formal characteristics The work is presented as a letter addressed to two of Plutarch's sons. It is headed by the address 'To Autobulus and Plutarch from their Father with his Wishes for their Welfare'9 (ó TTctTTip AÜToßouXto Kai TTXoirrápxa) eī) TrpcxTT6iv). In an elaborate and ornate opening sentence, Plutarch explains his reason for writing this exposé: his sons thought 4 that he ought to bring together in a separate treatise (Lôiaç avaypa&lt;ļ&gt;7ļS') what he had frequently said and had here and there written of the way he understood Plato's doctrine of the soul, since this interpretation of his was not easy to manage otherwise and was in need of vindication.'10 Plutarch refers to his own work as an àv&lt;rypac|&gt;f|, a term which may have connotations of 'setting out in public', 'placing on record'.11 De animae procreatione is not, then, presented as a hasty attempt at interpreting a difficult passage, but as a carefully written statement of his considered views, on a passage that is somehow at the centre of his philosophy.12 The work takes the form of a commentary13 on Timaeus 35al-36b5 and comprises two parts: the first section is a discussion of 35al-b4, where Timaeus describes the composition of the world-soul, in the second three problems (iTļirpaTci)14 are examined that are related to the subsequent division of the soul into harmonic intervals, explained in Tim. 35b4-36b5. Both of the main sections of Plutarch's essay begin with the full quotation of the passage he is about to discuss. Within the sections there is no particular conceptual order: Plutarch just explains different aspects of his interpretation, referring to texts of Plato in support of his theses and developing arguments against alternative interpretations.15 The De animae procreatione , then, is not a running commentary on the Timaeus , but an essay in two parts dealing with two contiguous passages. By means of offering a commentary on these passages, Plutarch develops his interpretation of what he sees as the core of Plato's cosmology, namely the construction of the world soul. So let us first take a brief look at the crucial passage and Plutarch's interpretation of it. IV. Plutarch's understanding of Timaeus 35ab Plutarch announces that before explaining his interpretation, he will first set out the literal words of the Timaeus (7Tpo£K0f|&lt;JO[jLai tt'v 'ć£iv, cos* è v Ti|iaio) yéypcrnTai). This is how he quotes Tim. 35al-b4: 9 Translations are those of Cherniss, with modifications, however, where my understanding of a passage differs from his. 10 As paraphrased by Cherniss 1976, 133. 11 Hershbell 1987, 238. Cf. Cherniss 108-109; Ferrari 2000b, 180, n. 24. 12 The interpretation of Timaeus 35a plays a crucial role in Plutarch's views on psychology, ethics, cosmology, and metaphysics. Cf. Opsomer 1994. 13 For a detailed structure see Appendix 2. On the formal aspects of middle platonie commentaries see Ferrari 2000b, and for De anim. procr. especially 177-181; 204-209. 14 Cf. Ferrari 2000a, 159-160; 2000b, 204-208; Ferrari and Baldi 2002, 25-28. 15 He starts off the discussion with a refutation of some erroneous interpretations (Xenocrates' and Crantor's), which he offers as a kind of évÔóaiiiov (1012d), literally a 'key-note'. This metaphor can be seen as setting the tone for the discussion of harmonic intervals that makes up the second part of the work.</page><page sequence="4">140 GREEK, ARABIC, AND LATIN COMMENTARIES (1) TT1S* à'l€p PUC Kal del KaTa1 ravrà èxovar'ç ovaíaç Kal rf'ç aí) TTepl Ta acofiaTa yf/voiieyr^ ^piarns1 TpÍTov d[i&lt;f&gt;oiv èv [léaco ovveKepáaaro2 ouatas" £i8os' (2) rf'ç re Tairrou (frvaeœç aï) Trépi Kal rf'ç rov erèpov3 Kal KaTa Tairra4 auveaTTļaev èv |jl6cto) tou t' à[i€povç aÙTTiv5 Kal tou KaTa Ta aco^iaTa iiepicrroû.

A2 We do not have to worry here about how Plato understood the mixing process described in these lines. G.M.A. Grube (1932) has solved the main difficulties surrounding this passage and his interpretation has been accepted by the main scholars on the Timaeus , including H. Cherniss (and F.M. Cornford as well as L. Brisson, to name but the most important). Today's standard reading happens to coincide with that of Proclus,17 at least as 16 See also Thévenaz 1938, 37-39. 17 Phillips 2002, 321, deviates from the modern orthodoxy and adopts an interpretation like that of Plutarch. Other exceptions are Margel 1995, 82, and Sallis 1999, 65-70, who basically revert to the general schema proposed by Taylor 1928, 109: Thus the operation the Demiurge is pictured as performing is clear enough. He first takes two ingredients A and B and by blending them produces an 'intermediate' C. He then makes a single uniform whole by blending A, B , and C and finally he divides that whole into a number of 'portions'.'</page><page sequence="5">OPSOMER: PLUTARCH 141 far as the interpretation of the syntax is concerned.18 According to this interpretation, the composition of the world soul involves two steps: first the craftsman mixes indivisible existence and divisible existence into an intermediate form of existence. He does the same for sameness and difference. Then he takes the three products' that result from this first operation of mixture - intermediate existence, intermediate sameness, and intermediate difference - and mixes the three of them together into the soul.19 Not all of the differences between the passage as quoted by Plutarch and the text of our Plato manuscripts matter for this interpretation. Some of the variants are quite innocent - 35al afiepoOę for aļiepicrrou for instance,20 or KaTà TaOTa for KaTà TaÙTa21 - but there is one variant that makes a crucial difference, to wit avrr'v instead of avrûv,22 as it makes Plutarch's text incompatible with the standard interpretation. According to the standard interpretation, the text of lines a4-6 means that: again in the case of sameness and in that of difference, he also on the same principle made a compound intermediate between that kind of them (aÚTcov) which is indivisible and the kind that is divisible in bodies. The genitive avrûv clearly refers to the indivisible and the divisible kinds of sameness and difference , which makes their mixture analogous to the mixture of Existence (ouaiaç, a2). But if one reads airrf|v, divisible sameness, divisible difference, indivisible sameness, and indivisible difference have altogether disappeared from the text. Instead, atJTiļv has become the object of 0vvé0rr)0€v. How then, does Plutarch read the text? In (1) Timaeus describes the mixture of a 'substance' or 'being' (ouaia) between indivisible being and the being that becomes divisible around bodies: 18 Cornford has made some improvements to the punctuation of the OCT text: cf. Cornford 1937, 60 n. 1. For more details see Brisson 1974, 270-275. The majority of Plato scholars reject Burnet's athetesis of aft Tré pi in line a4. 19 This is the structure of the mixing process (as implied by reading ainw): (step 1) indivisible ousia + divisible ousia -&gt; intermediate ousia indivisible sameness + indivisible sameness -+ intermediate sameness indivisible difference + divisible difference -+ intermediate difference (step 2) intermediate ousia + intermediate sameness + intermediate difference world soul. 20 Cf. Cherniss 1976, 159 n. c. F. Ferrari thinks that Plutarch has deliberately changed áp.epí&lt;JTou into ¿ļiepoDs1 in order to facilitate the equation of this entity with the diiepoOs* of 35a5 (1999, 333-334; Ferrari and Baldi 2002, 217 n. 5). Since this is not the only case in which he suspects Plutarch of tampering with the text and nothing much hangs on this variant - the equation is still possible even if one reads àp.epícjTou - 1 shall not focus on this variant, but only on the one without which Plutarch's interpretation would not be possible: cf. infra , Appendix 1. 21 KaTà Tcúmi, 'in this way' goes slightly better with Plutarch's interpretation than KaTà Taťrrá, 'in like manner' (on this varia lectio see Taylor 1928, 108), as according to him the mixture of sameness and difference is not really analogous to that of indivisible and divisible being. To the modern standard interpretation this would not really make a difference, as 'in this way' can mean 'in the same way'. For Plutarch 'in this way' would be equivalent rather to 'in the following way'. See also Festugière - Mugler 1967, 197(-198) n. 4. aft TTĆpi makes the text easier to read. Without the preposition, Tfļs' re tclvtov &lt;1&gt;vc€oíç Kal rf'ç tov èTépou is best interpreted as a genitive of material. For the philosophical interpretation this makes no difference. On aft iT€pi at 35b4 see Taylor 1928, 107-108, concluding that this corruption is older than Plutarch, but probably later than Cicero. Brisson 1974, 270-271, however, suggests that this may not be a corruption at all. See also Brisson and Patillon 1995, n. 163, 234. 22 Only two late manuscripts of Plutarch's work read aÙTÛv, but this is probably the result of a contamination with the textual tradition of the Timaeus. The reading aîrrr|v is attested nowhere else (Proclus, in Tim. 2,155,2, has ainw).</page><page sequence="6">142 GREEK, ARABIC, AND LATIN COMMENTARIES (1) Of the indivisible and ever invariable being and of the being, on the other hand, that becomes divisible around bodies, he blended together out of both a third kind of being in the middle. Phrase (2), on Plutarch's reading, describes in more detail the very process mentioned in (1). Now Timaeus says that the demiurge compounded it (aÜTf|v), that is, the 'substance' (ouaia) mentioned previously. This is done 'with regard to' - one could almost say, 'for the sake of' - sameness and difference. As Cherniss (1976, 160 n. a) rightly remarked, Plutarch probably took toü t£ d|i£poí)s'.. Kal tou... p.€pi&lt;jTo0 as a genitive of material with aw€cnT|a£v airrfjv, instead of letting ev piéao) govern the genitive. 'In the middle' then does not refer to the middle between divisible and indivisible being, as in (1), but to the middle between sameness and difference. Indeed, as we will see shortly, Plutarch considers sameness and difference as extreme terms, which can only be blended because between them is placed as a receptacle the mixture of the indivisible and the divisible. This results in the following translation: (2) And with regard to the nature of sameness again and that of difference he also in this way compounded it, in the middle, out of the indivisible and what is divisible among bodies. With the intermediate mixture of 'substance/being' in place, the demiurge can then (3) force sameness and difference into the final mixture. Three ingredients go into this final blend: substance, sameness, and difference: (3) And he took them, three as they were, and blended them all together into a single entity, forcibly fitting into sameness the nature of difference, which is refractory to mixture, and mixing them together with being. In fact, four ingredients go into the mixture: sameness, difference, divisible being and indivisible being, but since the latter two had already been blended, Plutarch can say that the ingredients of the final mixture are only three,23 and thus do justice to the letter of the text. Once the mixture is accomplished, the demiurge can start to divide it up again (4 and 5): (4) And when out of three he had made one, he again distributed the whole of this into fractions that were appropriate and each of these a blend of sameness and difference and being; (5) and he began the division in the following way. V. Plutarch's interpretation of the composition of the world soul If this is how Plutarch understands the Wortlaut of Timaeus 35ab, it remains to be seen what he thinks are the entities that Timaeus is talking about. As Plutarch understands it, the demiurge first mixes indivisible being (fļ ¿liepas1 / ajiepiaToę Kal àel KaTa Táirrà exouaa ouata) with 'the kind of being that becomes divisible around bodies' (fļ TTepl Ta acójiaTa yiyvo'iévT[ fiepiaTT)). These two entities are related as form to matter, whereby divisible being is, as it were, the matter that receives the form that is the indivisible being (21, 1022f). The formula 'indivisible and ever invariable being' stands for the intelligible, 23 Sec also Ferrari and Baldi 2002, 219 n. 7.</page><page sequence="7">OPSOMER: PLUTARCH 143 the realm of the Platonic ideas to which the demiurge himself belongs.24 That is why Plutarch can say that the demiurge imparts something of himself to the world-soul: The soul, however, when it has partaken of intelligence and reason and concord, is not merely a product but also a part of god and has come to be not (only) by his agency but both from him as source and out of his substance. ( Quaest . Plat. 2, 1001c) f] ôè iļsv)(T)f voû ļjL€TaaxoOaa Kal Xoyia|±o0 Kal apiioi/iaç, oùk epyov è ari tou 06 oü [lóvov àWà Kal ļi£pos' où8' úit' airroû aXX' om*' aírroO Kal aírroD yéyovev. Nowhere in the texts that have come down to us does Plutarch explain the exact relation between the demiurge and the forms.25 Contrary to many of his contemporaries, he may have been reluctant to say that the forms are the thoughts of the divine craftsman. At this point there seems to be no justification for any claims beyond the general remark that Plutarch's forms and demiurge belong to the same realm, that of 'indivisible', i.e. intelligible being. Plutarch does not think that the intelligible realm gets completely immersed in the world-soul. While keeping its transcendence, it somehow becomes present in the world-soul. How this is to be understood remains unexplained.26 Plutarch resorts to a metaphor also used in the Timaeus : the demiurge is to the soul as a father to its child.27 The second component of the mixture is 'the divisible being that comes to pass in the realm of bodies'. The originality of Plutarch lies in the fact that he identifies this entity with soul itself.28 'Divisible being' by itself is the precosmic, disorderly soul that becomes the world-soul when it receives the intelligible forms. In the world-soul it is the psychic substrate (it is a non-material substrate, which is why the word 'matter' can only be applied homonymously, 21, 1022f). It is therefore misleading to speak of Plutarch's 'two world souls', as he is in fact defending a theory of two stages: in the precosmic stage soul exists by itself; then, in the so-called ývx oyovia, this entity receives (a share of) indivisible being and thereby becomes a world- soul. The 'ancient nature', i.e. 'soul itself', 24 Baltes 2000, 261, claims that for Plutarch 'indivisible being' is a rational soul too, but this is surely wrong. In the passage that he quotes in support of his view, 1015e, àyaÔoupyòs1 does not stand for indivisible being as an ingredient of the mixture, but for the result of the mixture, i.e. the world soul. By 'indivisible being' Plutarch clearly refers to a higher reality, that of intellect or the intelligible. See Opsomer 2001, 195-197. 25 He does say, at 1023c, that god's relation to the idea is that of imitator to pattern, but his relation to the soul is that of artificer to finished product (ó Qeòç Tils' [lèv ISéas a)?

See also Thévenaz 1938, 1; Cherniss 1976, 143. 26 1024cd is the most explicit text (from a passage on the precosmic state): 'But the intellect, while it was abiding and immobile all by itself, upon having got into the soul and taken control, makes her turn around to himself, and with her accomplishes the circular motion most closely in contact with real existence, revolving around that which always remains fixed', ó 8è voi»? abròg [lèv è&lt;f&gt;' èavrov ^óvi^os* fy Kal áKÍi/r)TOS' èyyeyófievos- 8è TT) Kal KpaTTļCTas' els* èairròv émcrrp€&lt;í&gt;ei Kai auim-epaivei ttìv éyKÚicXiov &lt;f&gt;opàu TTepl tò [Lévov del iiáXicjTa ýavovoav toö ovtos. TlepC clearly has a local meaning (cf. also 1024a, Třepí Tity del 'iévovoav iSpi^vov oúaíav - in the case of the intelligible this local aspect should be understood metaphorically, however, but that is another matter), and this is also how Plutarch understands this preposition in the formula |±epicrnr) TTepí Td acojiaTa. Taylor 1928, 108, claims that in the Timaeus the preposition with the accusative is equivalent to a simple genitive: 'divisible corporeal being'. 27 Cf. Quaest. Plat. 2. For the turn of the soul towards the intelligible Plutarch already uses the verb èmcrrpécjxo, which prefigures the Neoplatonic use, without being as yet a technical term (1024d; 1026f). The closest parallel in Plutarch is De Isid. 376b; see also Quaest. conv. 746c; Defac. 924d (of the sun that turns everything that is akin towards it); De def. 432c (for the opposite turn of the soul towards the irrational); De virt. 443f (id.). ^avTTļ ydp fy ývxf) Ka0' łairrfy (1014e).</page><page sequence="8">144 GREEK, ARABIC, AND LATIN COMMENTARIES is identified with the 'limitlessness' of the Philebus , with the 'divisible nature' and the 'necessity' of the Timaeus , and with the disordered soul in the Laws (ch. 6). 29 Already before it has been made harmonious and orderly by the demiurge, it causes motion, but a motion that is disorderly. And even within the world-soul, it sometimes makes its ancient influence felt. Therefore it can be considered a principle of evil (ch. 7). In the human soul, it shows up as the irrational faculty. The composition of the human soul is analogous to that of the world soul, but with the irrational element being relatively stronger than it is in the world-soul. The soul puts forth of herself the affective part, having received intelligence from outside (1026c-e). The generation of the world-soul consists in the fact that the precosmic soul receives a participation in the intelligible so that it becomes ordered. The soul is ordered according to numerical ratios, the same ratios that define the musical intervals. Therefore it can be said that the world-soul becomes harmonious, in the true sense of the word (ch. 33). This also explains the importance of the second part of Plutarch's essay, where the function of the numbers and numerical ratios is explained and related to the harmonious intervals. In the final chapter of the treatise, Plutarch recapitulates and explains that the demiurge uses the soul ordered by numbers to create order and harmony in the entire world, down to the level of senseless bodies. For the artificer, having taken over a jangling disorder in the motions of the discordant and stupid soul which was at odds with herself (TTapaXaßcov yàp ó ÔTiiiiovpyòs' ch~a£iav Kai TT'r|[i|ié'£iav èv rais Kivf|aeai rf'ç avapļioaTou Kal àvoriTou 8ia(ļ)6po[i6VT|S' Trpòç èairrf|v), distinguished and separated some parts and brought others together with one another and organized them, using concords and numbers by which when blended and fitted together even the most senseless bodies, stones and logs and the bark of plants and bones and beestings of animals, provide statuary of wonderful appearance and medicines and instruments of wonderful potency. (33, 1029e) The soul then becomes as it were a second demiurge as it starts organising the world. Indeed, the last word of the treatise is 8iaK€K0aļir|K6v, said of the soul (1030c). The composition of the world-soul is not finished with the blending of the indivisible and the divisible nature. This blend, which has a hylemorphic structure, now serves as the substrate for the admixture of the two other entities mentioned in the Timaeus : sameness and otherness. Again Plutarch remains very vague as to the nature of these entities: they are clearly immaterial principles of some sort, and of the four entities mentioned they are the more extreme principles. Because of their extreme character they were difficult to combine (which is mainly due to the nature of difference, whose function it is to divide, 25, 1025c). That is why the first mixture, that of the indivisible and the divisible nature, was needed as a substrate for the admixture of the two extreme principles. This substrate for the final mixture is called substance, as in 35a4. Thus many considerations make it clear to us that the soul is not god's work entirely (to 'ir' -nâv €pyov eivai 06 ou tt'v i/wx1!1')30 but that with the portion of evil inherent in her (exouaav èv eairrf] tt'v toü KaKoû ļioīpav) she has been arranged 29 Baltes 2000, 248-250 gives a nice overview of what Plutarch says about 'soul itself'. 30 The world soul is in part the product of the demiurge, and even more than that, it is a part of him. Cf. Quaest. Plat. 2, 1001c. The part that is not god's work (nor a part of him) is 'soul itself', or as it is called in the present text, the 'ancient nature', 'the part of evil inherent in the world soul.'</page><page sequence="9">OPSOMER: PLUTARCH 145 by god (i&gt; TT* èicelvou 8iaK£KoaļJLTļcr0ai), who with the one bounded her infinitude that by participation in limit it might become substance (oíkjicl) and through the agency of sameness and of difference (rrj Se ravrov Kal tt' été pou 8uvdļi6i) commingled order and change and differentiation and similarity and in all these produced, so far as was feasible, amity and union with one another by means of numbers and concord. (28, 1027a) Plutarch explicitly draws the analogy with the composition of the body of the world: in order to be able to bring fire and earth together, the demiurge had to set water and air between them, and bind the extremes together using two middle terms: what fire is to air, air is to water, and what air is to water, water is to earth (Tim. 32a7-b7). Likewise, in the case of the soul, sameness and otherness were utterly recalcitrant and so could not engage in communion; but since sameness was closer to the indivisible, and otherness more akin to the divisible nature, the demiurge succeeded in bringing them together by tying them to the first blend. [...] He united sameness and difference, contrary forces and antagonistic extremes, not just by themselves; but by first interposing other beings, the indivisible in front of sameness and in front of difference the divisible, as each of the one pair is in a way akin to one of the other, and by then making an additional blend with those between after they had been commingled he thus fabricated the whole structure of the soul. (1025b) Plutarch does not explain what sameness and otherness themselves are; he merely explains how the cosmological and epistemic activities of the soul show these principles at work, in various combinations (1024d- 1025a). Sameness and difference are not the ultimate principles of reality. In a brief but crucial passage Plutarch claims that these principles are themselves dependent on the One and the dyad: In fact, each of the two derives from another of two principles, sameness from the One and difference from the dyad.

It is remarkable that Plutarch seems to let us down every time we want to find out more about the ontological status he assigns to the various entities discussed. The reason for this may be an academic caution restraining him from making bold assertions about divine realities.32 An additional reason may be that this is simply not the main purpose of this treatise. He seems much more interested in an accurate description of the composition of the world soul (the exegesis of Tim. 35al-b4), and in the general role of harmonious intervals for the working of the soul (the exegesis of 35b4-36b5). The two parts of the treatise are intimately linked, for the harmonic intervals turn out to be related to the composition of the soul and its cosmological function. It is through these numbers that the soul is ordered. As a harmonically regimented soul it governs the world in an orderly way. 31 Cf. Ferrari and Baldi 2002, 297-298, n. 173.

See also Donini 1994, 5075-5082; Ferrari 1995, 74-80; Dillon 2002, 229-234. 32 For 'academic' themes in De an. procr. see Opsomer 1998, 183, n. 264.</page><page sequence="10">146 GREEK, ARABIC, AND LATIN COMMENTARIES The governance of the world is indeed a recurring theme in Plutarch's text.33 The soul can govern the world only because it is itself harmonious, and because it has a position of authority vis-à-vis body. It has this authority because it is older.34 VI. Creation of the world and its soul as an actual and singular event This brings us to one of the main theses of the treatise. Plutarch is one of the few Platonists to have believed that the composition of the world-soul and the creation of the world was something that actually had a first moment of time.35 Yet this seems the natural reading of the Timaeus , and this is indeed how Aristotle understood it36 and one of the reasons why he criticised the work. The early Platonists were quick to defend Plato by claiming that he had described the generation of the world only 8i8a&lt;jKa'íaç, or öecopias-, Xapif, 'for the sake of teaching' or 'of examination',37 that is, in order to explain the complex matter of the composition of the soul by way of a fictional story about how it was built.38 Plutarch does not think highly of this view: In any case, what frightens and embarrasses these men in common with most of those who study Plato so that they manipulate and force and twist everything in the belief that they must conceal and deny it as something dreadful and unspeakable (&lt;J&gt;oßoiJ|aevoi Kal 7Tapa|iu0oú|i€voi iráura |ir|xavwTai Kai 7Tapaßia£ovTai Kai crrpécfxttKJiv, ti òeivòv Kai dppTļTov oiófiÉVoi 8eiv TTepiKaXimreiv Kai àpveicrôai) is the generation and composition of the universe and of its soul which have not been compounded from everlasting or in their present state for infinite time. (1013de) To me it seems that Plutarch has a point: Timaeus' account is a tale about the origin of the world. And if we want to understand it, we will have to look at what the story, as it is told by a character in a dialogue, literally means. But for Plutarch much more is at stake: it is not about understanding some story correctly, but about having an accurate view of the origin of the world. Should we think that the world has existed forever, or did it begin at some point? A 'literal' reading of the Timaeus could mean various things. Let it be defined as an interpretation that takes the following key elements literally: the world has been constructed out of certain pre-existing entities (eg., matter, 'divisible being'); these have been ordered into a beautiful whole by a divine craftsman, the demiurge; and the creation of the world out of pre-existing elements was an actual event that can be situated in time, in the minimal sense that there was a state of things before the intervention of the demiurge, and a different state after his intervention.39 On this account it is not necessary 33 eg. 1013f (citing Leg. 896a); 1016c; 1017ab, and the entire final chapter. 34 Plato Tim. 34bl0-35al and Leg. 896a5-c8, quoted at De an. procr. 1016ab and 1013ef, respectively. Quaest. Plat. 4, 1002e. 35 Atti cus was another Platonist who took the creation literally. Cf. fragm. 4 Des Places = Eus. Praep. ev. 15,6,4; Cherniss 1976, 176 n. a. See also Baltes 1976, 38-45; 93. 36 Cf. De cáelo 280a28-32; 300bl6-18; Phys. 251M7-19; Metaph. 1071b37-1072a3 37 Cf. 1017b. 38 Cf. Baltes 1976, 5-22. 39 For the sake of convenience I ignore the Platonic argument that time itself was created together with the world. Cf. Baltes 1976, 43-44; Zambón 2002, 89. According to the Platonic conception of time (time structured according to regular intervals: days, months, seasons, years; cf. Quaest. Plat. 8, 1007d), the creation of the world could not have happened in time. But even a Platonist might grant that before the coming to be of time, there</page><page sequence="11">OPSOMER: PLUTARCH 147 that the champions of the literal reading take every single element of Timaeus' story literally; they do not have to believe, for instance, that the demiurge actually looked at eternal being (29a3), of which it was previously denied that it is of a perceptible nature (27d5-28a4). Neither do they have to endow the demiurge with all the anthropomorphic traits with which Timaeus depicts him. I take it that a literal reading in the sense outlined above does not turn out to be fraught with insurmountable inconsistencies.40 If Plutarch then adopts an interpretation that is literal in this sense - and he does - this should not in itself be a problem. On the contrary, it has considerable advantages. In addition to securing the soul's leadership over the world and refuting the views of the godless,41 the literal interpretation has another advantage according to the Chaeronean: it resolves a blatant contradiction in the works of Plato. For in the Phaedrus Plato argues that the soul is ungenerated, whereas in the Timaeus he describes it as coming into being. Plutarch's interpretation solves the difficulty: in the Phaedrus?2 Plato is speaking about the soul as such, which is indeed ungenerated (the precosmic soul before it became the world soul), whereas in the Timaeus he is describing the composition of the world- soul.43 A first proof of it is that it resolves what is called and seems to be his inconsistency and self-contradiction. For one would not attribute even to a drunken sophist, and it is nonsense then to attribute to Plato in regard to the doctrines about which he had been most seriously concerned, such confusion and capriciousness as to declare of the same entity both that it is unsubject to generation and that it did come to be, in the Phaedrus that the soul is not subject to generation and in the Timaeus that it came to be. (1015f-1016a) Here we see at work one of the guiding principles of Plutarch's hermeneutics: the search for consistency.44 I believe that this, in general, was also one of his reasons for writing the treatise:45 Plutarch wanted to make sense of the text, to resolve difficulties and remove contradictions. must have been a rudimentary temporal structure so that events can in principle be ordered according to before and after, at least with respect to such a drastic change as the creation of the world itself. Plutarch for one allowed for this rudimentary temporal structure - without however calling this structure itself temporal - when he declared that before the generation of the heaven (TTpò tt's toû oüpavoö yeveaecosO there was an indeterminate motion that was the amorphous and unwrought matter, as it were, of time (kl i/riais* dópiaTOS* üXJTTep áiiopťfjos' vXt) xpóvou Kal àaxTjM-úTLCTTOs1, Quaest. Plat. 8, 1007c). 40 I fully subscribe to the arguments put forward by Vallejo 1997. See also Vlastos 1939; Scheffel, 1976, 52-53. Baltes 2000 makes a strong case for a non-literal reading, but his arguments are not as decisive as he believes them to be. His arguments do show that it is difficult to understand Timaeus' account literally as an ordered series of successive events. But he does not show in an equally convincing, and surely not in a decisive, manner that the act of creation cannot be understood as an actual single event (happening in a flash, as it were). I hope to discuss Baltes' arguments at some other occasion. 41 Cf. 1013e. Plutarch refers to the argument of book 10 of the Laws , where Plato's argument from motion is based on the premise of the priority of the soul {Leges 891e-899d) and the world soul is called divine as it is responsible for the orderly motion of the universe. Atticus makes Plutarch's reasoning somewhat more explicit by stating that true providence exists only between a maker and its creation, which is why the world could not be ungenerated: [...] Xoyiaáp.evos' ötl tco 'it' yevo^ievQ) oijTe tivòç ttoltítoô oíjtc tlwos* KriSeiióvos1 TTpóę to yevéaSai raXus" XP^^a, Iva p.f) àTTO&lt;JTepT|crQ tòv kócj|±ov tt'ç TTpovoias* à&lt;f&gt;eiXe tò àyévnr|Tov aÙTOû (fragm. 4,2 des Places).

The majority of commentators, ancient and modern, refuse to interpret the generation of the soul and the world literally, and understand Plato's talk of precosmic entities as metaphorical: through a cosmogonie story, it is believed, he explains logical distinctions. This understanding is rejected by Plutarch, which is why he has to explain the behaviour of these entities - precosmic soul, precosmic matter - as that of real entities. He could no longer say, for instance, that precosmic matter is matter thought of as existing in separation from soul. He had to treat precosmic matter as something that really existed as such, and that, as a real entity, differs from matter as it exists after the intervention of the demiurge. He then also has to explain the relation between those precosmic entities. Rather surprisingly, these relations bear a dangerously close resemblance to those of their cosmic counterparts. Precosmic matter never exists without the precosmic soul and also somehow participates in the intelligible, through that soul.46 Plutarch now faces the task of explaining how these relations of participation differ from those in the world as we know it. The precosmic soul was not ordered, and therefore imparted an essentially erratic motion to matter. Matter's participation in the intelligible can only be imperfect and fleeting, and is the result of chance (the famous 'traces of the forms'47). Plutarch's understanding of the precosmic condition as a real state of affairs leads to interesting problems,48 which do not concern us here.49 Suffice it to say that they provide a challenge to his acumen and that Plutarch's solutions are sometimes attractive to modern scholars who, like Plutarch, take the story told by Timaeus literally.50 VII. Evidence for a precosmic soul in Plato? Although some aspects of Plutarch's interpretation mentioned so far may seem to be unorthodox and will not meet with everyone's agreement, they hardly warrant the view that Plutarch willfully and surreptitiously distorts the meaning of the texts on which he is commenting. The latter allegation has been made by Cherniss with respect to a number of passages that it is now time to examine more closely. A first series of manipulations has to do, allegedly, with Plutarch's evidence, gathered across various dialogues, for the existence of a disordered soul. Plutarch equates the irrational psychic principle with the 'divisible nature', the 'necessity' of the Timaeus , and even the precosmic becoming (yé veáis*) of 52d, with the maleficent soul of the Laws (1014d-1015a), with infinitude (a7T6ipia) in the Philebus , and with the 'congenital desire' and the 'inbred nature' of the Politicus. Some of these equations are highly questionable and even amount to outright manipulation, says Cherniss.51 While I would not be willing to defend these equations as my own, I would not go as far as to claim that Plutarch 46 This is why in the De Iside one goddess, Isis, can stand for soul and matter combined. Cf. Ferrari 1996a, 48-54. 47 Tim. 53a8-b5, cited at 1016ef. 48 There is a curious consequence to taking the precosmic state literally: if it is no longer considered to be a metaphor that is meant to reveal particular logical distinctions, the logical analysis is pushed back one level, as can be seen in Thévenaz's worthy attempt to reconstruct Plutarch's views on matter and body (1938, 108-1 13). 49 Good discussions of these problems can be found in Deuse 1983, 236-239, and Ferrari 1996a. 50 See von Perger 1997, 124; 148. For von Perger's hermeneutic principles cf. ibid. 36-38. 51 Cherniss 1976, 136-138. By way of contrast one may cite Thévenaz, who, after his survey of Plutarch's evidence, says (1938, 69): 'Il faut reconnaître d'ailleurs que cette théorie des deux âmes n'était pas à proprement parler anti-platonicienne. C'est un prolongement du platonisme vers lequel Platon lui-même semble parfois attiré, mais qu'il laisse incertain. Plutarque, pour les raisons dites, a pu donc penser en toute bonne foi qu'il ne faisait que rendre explicites des vues authentiquement platoniciennes.'</page><page sequence="13">OPSOMER: PLUTARCH 149 deliberately distorted Plato. As I shall try to show, he may have thought that they were perfectly defensible against the kind of objections made by Cherniss. In chapter 6 (1015a)52, Plutarch claims to be able to detect a reference to the disordered soul in the Politicus , where Plato speaks of the 'congenital desire' (cxij|i&lt;f&gt;uToç em0u|iia, 272e6) whereby the heaven is reversed and rolled back in the opposite direction, and of 'its ancient nature's inbred character, which had a large share of disorder before reaching the state of the present universe' (273b4-c2). The Eleatic Visitor indeed says that the one who put the world together bestowed all fine things upon it, whereas from its previous condition it has everything that is bad and unjust (273b7-c2). When the world is left to itself, the condition of its original disharmony gradually takes over (273c7-dl). Cherniss (139; 191, n. f)53 points out that Plutarch deliberately suppresses Plato's phrase to aco^aToeiôèç Tfjç airyKpacreios', 'the bodily element of its mixture', which would have been embarrassing for his interpretation. It is true, I think, that Plutarch omitted these words because it was more convenient to do so. They would have required an explanation. However, I do not think that they would have been fatal to his interpretation.54 tò Gbò'iaro€iS€ç tt'ç auyKpáaecos is often translated as 'the bodily element in its mixture', but sensu stricto , it does not have to mean this. The acoļiaToeiSes- can be understood as that which is like body,55 and therefore the translation 'the element in its mixture that has an affinity with body' is to be preferred. Now, closeness to body is indeed a hallmark of the (precosmic) soul, as the formula used in the Timaeus shows: 'that which [= the kind of being that] becomes divisible around bodies' (tt'ç au TTepl Ta acoļiaTa 7171^010.61^19 ^piaTTÍs' &lt;oùaias&gt; Tim. 35a2-3; toO KaTà Ta acajiaTa jiepiaToO, Tim. 35a6, both cited at 1012c as part of the passage that is the object of the first part of Plutarch's essay).56 That it is not necessary to understand tò aajjiaToeiòèç rf'ç au7Kpaa6(09 as a 52 ctúii^utos1 émSupIa Kal tò Tfję náXai ttoté &lt;t&gt;v&lt;J€(ùç ovv Tpo&lt;ļ&gt;ov ttoXá.t's 'ieréxov ¿Tafias', TTpìv elç tòv v')v KÓ(j|±ov à&lt;f&gt;iKé&lt;J0ai.

In this paraphrase of the Politicus passage he seems to substitute aūļia for aa)|±aToeiÔés'. The context is, however, different from the argument in De an. procr. In the final part of this table conversation, the character Plutarch explains how the demiurge solved a geometrical prbblem by creating something that is quantitativily equal to matter, and qualitatively similar to the model. What we have here is a traditional Middle Platonic 'three principles doctrine', which is loosely based on the Timaeus (cf. Dörrie 1957, 206-219; Dörrie and Baltes 1996, Baustein 113; 387-389) Philop. in Phys. 23,31-24,1), rather than an exegetical effort by Plutarch. There is no room for the soul in this neat scheme of things (I will not go into the other exegetical difficulties raised by this passage, the main one being that the traditional three principles doctrine cannot be read into the passage to which Plutarch here refers - 48e - but is based instead on 28a-c). Plutarch here uses a piece of traditional school teaching that does not go well with his own doctrine of the precosmic soul (cf. Dörrie - Baltes 1996, Baustein 114, 399: 'Eine andere Form der Dreiprinzipienlehre findet man bei Plutarch.'). Nevertheless, it is not altogether incompatible with the interpretation of De an. procr. If one applies the arguments from De an. procr. to Quaest. conv. 720bc it follows from Plutarch's description that there must have been a soul present as well, as there is mention of disorderly motions (cf. èv yevéoei Kal |±CTaTpoTrrj Kal TTd0eai TTavTOÔairoîç). Moreover, the word aūjia is not the only substitution: Plutarch has replaced łmSi^iCa by áváyKTi, which according to the very same passage from De an. procr. (1015a) stands for the disorderly soul. What we would have is a syncopated version of the doctrine, not unlike that of the De Iside , where precosmic matter and soul are treated as one entity. 55 That is not to say that I agree with Plutarch. My sympathies here lie with an interpretation such as that put forward by Vlastos 1939, 79, Mohr 1985, 154, or indeed Cherniss. However, not everyone that disagrees with them is a fraud. 56 Tf)v KivT|TiKf)v TT1S" üXt)?

According to the latter the expression refers to the traces of the forms that have an influence on matter, but not yet in an orderly way.57 These traces, which are the cause of the disorder, are in no way to be equated with matter, and are not body either,58 but rather entities that are somewhat like bodies (proto-bodies, one might say). This interpretation is possible only if to ato[j.aT0€i8£ç does not simply mean 'body', but denotes some relation, or a closeness, to body.59 Another equation that is suspect according to Cherniss is that of the precosmic soul and the 'infinitude' (aTT£ip'ia) of the Philebus : As for the substance of soul, in the Philebus he has called it infinitude (ttiv 8è rf'ç èv 4&gt;i'riß(i) [lèv àiTÉipiav k6kXt|K6) as being privation of number and ratio and having in itself no limit or measure of deficiency and excess and difference and 1023b.

From 1022e and 1014d (see the translations by Cherniss, 1976, 213, and Ferrari and Baldi 2002, 109) it is clear that Plutarch understands the formula TiļS' TTepl Ta ac6|iaTa yiyvoiiei/ris' p-epicm^ as (1) 'the kind of being (oúaía) that becomes divisible around bodies', and not (2) 'the kind of being that comes to be around bodies and is divisible'. Whereas (2) is favoured by most modern interpreters (Cornford 1937, 59, 'the divisible Existence that becomes in bodies'; Brisson and Patillon 1995, 124: 'l'être divisible qui devient dans les corps'; von Perger 1997, 93: 'das Teilbare, das bei den Körpern wird'), Plotinus would have agreed more with Plutarch's understanding of the syntax of this phrase (= reading 1; Plotinus rejects, though, the idea that 'soul itself is that which is divisible). Cf. 4,2 [4], 1,32-35; 55-57; 73-75; 4,3 [27], 19,6-8; 6,4 [22], 1,2-3; 4,27-32. See also Schwyzer 1935, 364-365, Halfwassen 2000, 43, and Proci, in Tim. 2,150,21-24 (the soul is here contrasted with the ļiepia-rf) oúala - Diehl's conjecture in 1. 21 &lt;Tfjs&gt; is to be rejected). The main difference between the two interpretations is that according to (1) the divisibility of this kind of being is related to the presence of body, whereas according to (2) this kind of being is intrinsically divisible. While it is true that for Plutarch the soul is always in the proximity of body and is thus always becoming divisible, to say that it is divisible as such would probably make it sound, for his liking, too much as if the soul itself were bodily. Cherniss' translation of Tim. 35ab as quoted by Plutarch ('and of the divisible on the other hand that comes to pass in the case of bodies', 159-61) does not reflect Plutarch's understanding of the passage in this respect. Ferrari's (p. 95) is more accurate. Cf. 1023a, where Plutarch points out that Plato never called the receptacle Tre pi Tà aaj[iaTa ^lepLCTTTÍv, but rather aūļia p.epi£óiievov etę tò Ka0 ' ČKaaTov ('body that is being divided into particularity'). In this respect too the soul is intermediate between that which is inherently fragmented - body - and that which is truly indivisible - the intelligible (cf. 1022e). At 1024c Plutarch explicitly links the divisibility of soul (Ôiá Te ÔT1 TaÛTa ļiepiCTTf) TTpocnyyopeú0T|) to its intermediate character, more specifically to the fact that, as that which perceives and forms mental images, it is required to follow the perceptible and that which is imagined, and become divided accordingly.

The occasional case where Plutarch uses 'divisible being' as a short-hand for 'the being that becomes divisible around bodies' (eg. 1025a; 1024d) is no sign of carelessness or inconsistency on his part, but is merely a matter of convenience. Plutarch does use the more accurate expression in those passages where the distinction is important for the argument (1012e reflects the use of the term by Xenocrates). 57 Cf. in Tim. 1,387,8-30; in Parm. 844,24-6. Plotinus, on the contrary, glosses 'the world's ancient nature' from the Politicus as 'the underlying matter, not yet set in order by some god' (1,8 [51], 7,6-7). According to Phillips 2002, 203-205, Proclus accepts Plutarch's idea that the disordered motion of Timaeus 30a is the source of evil in the world. This is simply not true. For Proclus' views on evil see Opsomer and Steel 2003, 23-31; 121 n. 244. 58 For Plutarch's interpretation this distinction is not useful, as he equates body and matter. That, however, is another story. Cf. Reydams-Schils 1999, 193-196. 59 Similarly, at De sera num. 566a, tò 6' dXoyov Kai aajjiaToeióćs' denotes the 'irrational and bodylike', not 'bodily', part of the soul. I do not claim that in Plutarch the word acūiiaToeiSes1 never refers to bodies as such.

As for those, however, who attribute to matter and not to the soul what in the Timaeus is called necessity and in the Philebus measurelessness and infinitude in the varying degrees of deficiency and excess ( kv 8è $i'f|ßco iTepl tò 'ia''ov Kal Í)ttov êWe'upecùç Kal ÚTT€pßoXfìs, ctļi£Tpiav Kal àiTeipiav), what will they make of the fact that by Plato matter is said always to be amorphous and shapeless and devoid of all quality and potency of its own [. . .]? (1014ef) According to Cherniss, nothing in the Philebus warrants this identification, not even [by] Philebus 26b6-10 (the limitless appetites of wantonness and vice) or 27el-28a4 and 52c (pleasures and pains in the class of the dìreipov), for the nature of soul is not in question there and such psychic infinitude' is expressly just one example among many of the aTTeipia in the world (cf. Philebus 16c9-10, 24a-25a, 25c5-dl).60 I think, however, that Plutarch could in all honesty detect a psychic entity in the Philebus passage61 where Socrates explains the relation between the indefinite and the things that admit of a more and a less (24a-25a; 25c-e). In order to understand Plutarch's reasoning, we have to be willing to adopt, momentarily, his hermeneutical principles.62 If we accept that where there is motion (becoming), there is soul,63 the text delivers exactly what we need: The hotter and equally the colder are always in flux and never remain (TTpoxcopeî yap Kal ov (ievel), while definite quantity means standstill and the end of all progression (6cttt| Kal TTpoiòv ènavoaro).64 The upshot of this argument is that the hotter, together with its opposite, turn out to be unlimited (aiTeipov ylyvoiT' ãv - literally, 'become unlimited').65 (24d4-7) Whatever seems to us to become 4 more and less' ( '±a''óv re Kal fjTTOv yiyvó|±€va) [...] all that we ought to subsume under the genus of the unlimited (tò toû àTTcipou yévoç) as its unity. (24e7-25al) Somewhat further down, Socrates describes the arrival of limit in terms that remind us of Plutarch's account of the composition of the world-soul: 60 Cherniss 1976, 185 n. d. See also 138. 61 Cf. Helmer 1937, 24. There is indeed no explicit mention of an evil or disordered world soul. But a world soul turns up at Phil. 30a. There is no mention of diTeipia in this soul, but limit and unlimitedness are discussed throughout as fundamental principles of the world. 62 1 am not saying that Plutarch interprets the Philebus correctly. Cf. Ferrari and Baldi 2002, 247 n. 73: 'Per Platone si tratta, con la possibile eccezione proprio di 16c9, della classe comprendente gli enti e gli eventi privi di misura e ordine, mentre in Plut, diventa un singolo principio cosmologico identificato con l'anima precosmica irrazionale.' 63 See also Helmer 1937, 25, referring to Phaedr. 245c and Leg. 896b. 64 Plutarch may even have had this passage in mind when describing the effects of tò dļiepicrrov: § Kal tûv ctuv0ćto)v Kal (lepiaTŪv Kal Ôia&lt;f&gt;epop.évcov á^coayeTTcoç öiyoöcra Trauet tò TrXfļ0os&gt; Kal Ka0taTT|aiv el? |itav 8l' ÓIIOIÓTT1TOS' (1022ef).

(25dll-e2) Plutarch indeed holds that the indivisible substance, when it enters the precosmic soul, makes the latter orderly and harmonious by means of numerical ratios.66 In the final chapter of his essay, Plutarch claims that the soul has become harmonious and just by reason of the concordant ratios (1029a). The demiurge 'takes over a jangling disorder in the motions of the discordant and stupid soul (TTapa'aßo)v yap ó Srnjuoupyos- crra£iav Kal TT'Tì[i[ié'£iav Łv Tatę Kivrjaeai) which was at odds with herself, distinguished and separated some parts and brought others together with one another and organized them, using concords and numbers (àpiioviaiç Kal api^p-oi? xP^áiievosO' (1029e). Regularity and order in things are due to their participation in number and harmony (api0ļioD Kal àpiioviaç ļi6Taaxo0aiv, 1030a). The product of those ratios and numbers used by the demiurge is the soul's own harmony and concord with itself, whereby she has filled the heaven, into which she has come, with countless goods' (1030c). Take away the ratios and numbers and what you are left with is the psychic principle as such, the entity which is characterised by deficiency and excess and according to Phil. 24d4-7 is linked to disorderly motions. Limits are associated with rest, the unlimited with motion. The most problematic piece of evidence produced by Plutarch (ch. 24, 1024bc) for his theory of a precosmic soul is Tim. 52d, where it is said that 'being and space and becoming (ov t£ Kal x^pav Kal yêveoiv) were three and distinct even before heaven came to be'. Plutarch glosses these three precosmic natures as the intelligible (tò voTļTov), the receptacle (body/matter) and the soul, respectively. The identification of the intelligible is not the real problem, nor is that of the receptacle (Plutarch thinks the receptacle is bodily67). The problem is rather his interpretation of 'becoming' (yéveais-) as the psychic principle. This is indeed said to be identical with the divisible being of Tim. 35a, as it is involved in changes and motions and disperses in this world the semblances from the higher world. For this very reason it was called divisible, and also because it is necessary for that which is perceiving and that which is forming mental images to be divided in correspondence with what is perceptible and with what is imaginable and to be coextensive with them. This may be a good explanation of why the soul is called 'divisible around bodies'68 - the soul is not the bodies themselves, but a power (ôuva^iç) concerned with them; Plutarch also repeatedly explains that this power is twofold: it is both a moving and an image-forming capacity (kivtjtlkt) and &lt;f&gt;avTaaTiKf|), even in the precosmic condition of the soul. In both capacities it is always in contact with body. The precosmic soul too cognizes bodily nature and sometimes even catches glimpses of the intelligible by chance, and haphazardly transmits reflections from there. That is why, so Plutarch now suggests (1024bc), Plato describes it as intermediate. The problem, however, is that at Tim. 52d 66 Plutarch may even have taken the mentioning of the 'double' at Phil. 25dll as a reference to the 'double intervals' of the Timaeus. 67 Cf. n. 58. 68 Cf. n. 26.</page><page sequence="17">OPSOMER: PLUTARCH 153 becoming' (yeveaiç) obviously stands for 'the 'offspring' of the intelligible and the receptacle and only in this sense' is 'something 'between' them'.69 In other words, 'becoming' is the copy of the intelligible that comes to be in the receptacle, and not some power transmitting the images. Elsewhere70 Plutarch seems to recognize that this is the natural interpretation of this passage, as Cherniss does not fail to point out. But there Plutarch is rather referring to different phrases from the entire section 48e2-52dl. Only at Tim. 52d2-3 does Plato explicitly mention the precosmic stage, and this is the crucial phrase, because Timaeus here sums up the precosmic entities. If there is no trace of soul here, then Plutarch is in trouble. That is why he had to perform a tour de force and interpret 'becoming' (yéveaiç) as the precosmic soul. But he will have found some justification for this move, as in the following passage Plato talks about the motions present in the receptacle (52d4-53a7). And again the same rule applies: where there is motion, there is soul. Now Cherniss denies that the precosmic soul has access to the ideas and can be described as intermediate; this, he claims, is only true for the cosmic soul. Plutarch is said to be inconsistent, because of his attempt to interpret the precosmic chaos literally. Therefore he was constrained to contradict himself, by ascribing to the precosmic soul characteristics proper to the created soul.71 As I have pointed out above, the literal interpretation of the precosmic condition indeed gives rise to interesting problems and makes the role of the precosmic soul remarkably similar to that of the cosmic soul. This, however, does not so much contradict Plutarch's own interpretation72 as render it more complex. The incompatibility is only between Plutarch's account and Cherniss' own interpretation. As I have explained above, Plutarch believes that the literal interpretation of the Timaeus and the assumption of a precosmic soul reconciles the Phaedrus and the Timaeus. He claims that Plato's description of the generation of the soul refers to the world-soul, whereas the soul that is said to be ungenerated in the Phaedrus is the precosmic soul (1016a; 1016c; 1017ab). Cherniss accuses Plutarch73 of concealing that Plato in the Phaedrus expressly says that his argument refers to every soul and more particularly to the mover that sustains the universe. The words Trdaa (245c5), however, hardly constitute a problem for Plutarch. For the world soul is not really a numerically different soul from the precosmic soul, but merely the same soul in a harmonised condition. Qua soul it is ungenerated, yet it has not always been orderly. It is qua soul that it is the perpetual moving cause of the sensible realm (cf. 245d8-e2). So Plutarch's interpretation does not contradict the argument of the Phaedrus , although he could have expressed himself more accurately and avoided the impression that he is speaking of two numerically different souls (eg. at 1016c). This would also have prevented another of Cherniss' objections:74 in the Laws Plato does not treat the maleficent soul as being precosmic or antecedent to beneficent soul, but as an entity that in the present universe coexists with the good soul. Plutarch thinks of course that Plato does not really mean that there are two distinct souls, but that the maleficent soul is merely the ancient nature of the soul that sometimes makes its presence felt (cf. ch. 7). A 69 Cherniss 1976, 232 n. c. 70 De Isid. 373 e ; 372f. 71 Cherniss 1976, 230-231 n. e; 232-233, n. c and d. 72 It is consistent with his understanding of the 'traces'. The difference between the two stages is the lack of order (Tim. 53a8), not the absence of motion. This is cited at 1016ef, and the same reasoning is applied to the soul at 1017a. 73 Cherniss 1976, 139. 74 Cherniss 1976, 140.</page><page sequence="18">154 GREEK, ARABIC, AND LATIN COMMENTARIES charitable interpretation allowing for what could be called sloppiness of expression solves both objections.75 Ironically, the principle of charity should be applied to the words of both Plato and his commentator in an almost identical way: although Plato in the Laws talks of two souls, he could mean two conditions, states, or aspects of the same soul (assuming that he is using metaphorical language), and the same is true for Plutarch's words at 1016c (for Plutarch, at least, there can be no doubt that what he really wants to designate are two different conditions of the same soul76). VIII. A separate intellect Cherniss also upbraids Plutarch for obscuring the fact that vouç at 37c2 does not denote a separate entity but merely the understanding or intelligence in the soul: By reducing Plato's voOç €maTf||ir| re to èmoTT''jiT' alone Plutarch suppresses the embarrassing fact that vouç here is clearly treated as a state of soul and not a transcendent entity made an ingredient of it.77 It may be not insignificant that this exegetical point is crucial to Cherniss' own, controversial interpretation of the Timaeus. According to Cherniss, Plato would reject the possibility of an independently existing intellect. NoOç for Plato would not be an 'entity' but just 'the soul's ability [...] to 'see' the ideas or the state in the soul [...] produced by sight of them.'78 If there is no such thing as a separate intellect, the demiurge cannot of course be such an intellect. When the 'cause' is called crocia Kal vous* in the Philebus (30cd), this cause is not a god but 'a logical abstraction, intelligent causation in general'. And the demiurge in the Timaeus is just a personification of this abstraction.79 In favor of his claim Cherniss cites Tim. 30b3 and Phil. 30c9-10, where it is said that vovç cannot be present in anything without a soul: 'it is impossible for anything to come to possess intelligence apart from soul' (vovv 8' av x^pW àôwcrrov TTapayeveaöai to), Tim. 30b3); 'but there could be no wisdom and intelligence without a soul' (a o&lt;j)ia 'ù'v Kal voûç ãvev oùk âv ttoté yevoi ctötjv, Phil. 30c9-10). This view of Cherniss' has not found general acceptance. R. Hackforth, L. Brisson, and more recently, S. Menn distinguish voDç as it exists in the soul from vovç existing in itself: the soul has vovç , whereas the demiurge (or god) is voOç.80 The texts cited by Cherniss do not exclude the existence of a separate voftç. They merely state that nothing can possess intellect or intelligence without a soul, in other words, that intellect cannot be present in anything apart from soul.81 75 Compare Mansfeld 1992, 287, on the Politicus , and Scheffel 1976, 20, on the 'evil soul' in the Laws. 76 See, eg., 1014e; 1016b; Quaest. Plat . 2, 1001c; 4, 1003a. 77 Cherniss 1976, 227 n. c (commenting on 1023f). See also Gioè 1996, 304. Ferrari and Baldi 2002, 288 n. 159 echoes Cherniss' view, but is more careful. 78 Cherniss 1944, 607. 79 Cherniss 1944, 425; 607; 1950, 207. 80 Hackforth 1936, 4-9; Brisson 1974, 84. Cherniss grants that their interpretation of these two passages is at least possible (Cherniss 1944, 608; but see also 425). See also Menn 1995, 7; 14-24; Baltes 1996, 90; Frede 1997, 220 n. 195; von Perger 1997, 37; Halfwassen 2000. 81 A third passage used by Hackforth, Soph. 248e6-249a4, may seem more problematic. Hackforth's interpretation was criticised by Cherniss 1944, 608-609, but convincingly vindicated by Brisson 1974, 80-81, Mohr 1985, 178-188, and Menn 1995, 21-24.</page><page sequence="19">OPSOMER: PLUTARCH 155 At Quaest. Plat. 4, 1002f- 1003a, Plutarch quotes Plato more accurately than Cherniss does, as far as the relation between soul and intellect is concerned: the former cites him as saying that intellect cannot come to be without a soul (oùk av yevéoQai [...] vovv ávev ^uX"nsO&gt; whereas Cherniss (1976, 48, n. b) claims that Plato says, at Tim. 34bl0-35al and elsewhere, that intellect cannot exist without a soul. It is clear that for Plutarch Plato's words merely refer to the condition for the appearance of intellect in the world,82 for he explains that at first soul was without intellect (ávouç), but later partook of intellect (e-rrel 8' fļ iJwxTÌ voi» |i6TeXaß€). This it could not have done if intellect had not existed prior to this act of participation.83 In many other texts Plutarch refers to an independently existing intellect or an intellect that transcends the level of the soul.84 Cherniss denies that the demiurge is just a mythical double of the world-soul,85 but when he says that the demiurge is nothing but the personification of intelligent causation in the world, he is in fact claiming that the demiurge is the vous* of the world soul.86 This view seems rather far-fetched, and is at odds with what is said in the Timaeus. The demiurge cannot be the voOç of the soul; it, or rather he, makes the soul (how could it create the condition for its own existence?) and introduces intellect into the soul (30b 1- 5 ).87 On this point Plutarch is true to the letter of the Timaeus™ and Cherniss is not. Cherniss' touchiness, leading to the accusation that Plutarch is a manipulator, may be due to the circumstance that here and elsewhere he treats Plutarch as a rival interpreter. In this respect Cherniss' intuition was right, for his and Plutarch's overall approaches are remarkably similar: both are looking for doctrinal consistency across dialogues and both are rigorous in their interpretations while insisting that there is only one right way of reading Plato. But they do not always arrive at the same conclusions. In the previous pages I have discussed Cherniss' main evidence89 for the accusation that Plutarch was a manipulator of texts. I do not think that this image of Plutarch can be upheld. What has become clear, I hope, is the difference between an ancient commentary and the contemporary literary genre that is its far descendent. Universität zu Köln 82 Compare Corp. Herm. 10, Kleis, 17-18. 83 Cf. Opsomcr 2001, 195-196. 84 Eg., De facie 943a; De genio 59 Ide. Cf. Thévenaz 1938, 70-74. 85 Cherniss 1950, 207. 86 This is the position attributed to him by Brisson (1974, 76) - rightly so, I believe. Cf. Cherniss 1944, 606: 'Deity, then, as voûs* is not causally independent and so cannot be 'the ultimate reality.' It must, in fact, since it is vous*, exist in soul [...].' A similar view is taken by Cornford, 1937, 38-39; 197. 87 See also 36d8-9: the world soul has been constructed Kara vow of its maker. Cf. Thein, 2001, 222. 88 See De an. procr. 1016c; Quaest. Plat. 2, lOOlbc; De sera 559d. 89 Cherniss cites some other, circumstantial evidence. The erroneous inference mentioned at the end of note a on p. 139 (cf. 48, n. a) makes no difference to Plutarch's doctrine of the precosmic soul; it is a typical case of an assumption that was current among ancient Platonists, and again not a proof of manipulation. The omissions or curtailments mentioned in the same note do not impugn his overall interpretation: the omission of the words ópaTÒv Kal àiTTÓv after the phrase owe om^c ar o ovpavôv (101 6f , Tim. 38b7-8; cf. p. 207 n. d) is innocent, as these words do not have to mean that the body of the world was not ópaTÒv Kal cìtttóv before this operation. The omission in the citation of Tim. 37a5-b3 (1023ef) is again harmless. The reduction of vous* €Ttiott^11T) Te to ¿ ļjLTļ is discussed above. Other inconsistencies may have been occasioned by polemics with rival commentators: the misinterpretation of Posidonius' definition of the soul (1023c) may be intentional.</page><page sequence="20">156 GREEK, ARABIC, AND LATIN COMMENTARIES Bibliography Baltes 1976 = Baltes, M.

A rather extreme form of manipulative behaviour on the part of a commentator consists in changing the text to be commented so as to make it fit one's own views. Of this, too, Plutarch has been accused - not, however, by H. Cherniss,90 although his overall depiction of Plutarch as an unfaithful exegete may have inspired this accusation (another source of inspiration will have been J. Dillon, who made the concept of 'ideological emendations' famous,91 yet wisely refrained from including the case to be discussed below). The suggestion was made by F. Ferrari in an article from 1999, and repeated in his splendid new edition of Plutarch's treatise.92 It is indeed true that the passage as quoted by Plutarch in some respects deviates from Plato's text as it has come down to us in the manuscript tradition (cf. supra), but most of these little differences do not matter for the interpretation. I shall not discuss Plutarch's à|i£poí&gt;ç and KaTa TauTa (corresponding to lines al and a5, respectively), which according to Ferrari were surreptitiously introduced by Plutarch in order to facilitate his interpretation. They are compatible with the standard reading of the passage.93 The change of aÚTwv (a6) to airrf|v, however, makes all the difference. Plutarch allegedly changed the text because airrœv was incompatible with his own views on the matter. I think this is unlikely for a number of reasons. It is much more plausible that he simply reproduced the text that was at his disposal. In itself there is nothing strange about the possibility that Plutarch's text of Plato differs from ours. C. Hubert has pointed out that in other places, too, Plutarch's copy of Plato belongs to a tradition that is different from that of the majority of our manuscripts.94 Moreover, the other variants in the two passages quoted by Plutarch - those that are without any significance for the interpretation - show that Plutarch's Timaeus belonged to a different branch of the tradition. As I shall try to show, the corruption of auTÛv (a6) to auTiļv most probably antedates Plutarch. Against the idea that Plutarch silently tampered with the text of Plato in order to have it support his own doctrines, there is the fact that this course of action would have made him extremely vulnerable to criticism. If Plutarch had thought the text was unsound and needed emendation, or if he had known two versions between which he had to choose, he would probably have stated this explicitly. This would be in line with the procedure he followed in the eighth Platonic Question. There he mentions (1006d) the interpretation of some95 who want to read xpwu instead of xpóvou at Tim. 42d5, where Plato speaks of the earth and the moon and 'the other instruments of time'. Plutarch refutes their view with 90 1976, 160 n. a: 'Plato wrote Kcrrà TaÚTà ... aîrrûv ; but instead of the former Plutarch probably read KaTà TaOTa, and instead of the latter he certainly read Cherniss also gives a plausible reason for the change: it may have been occasioned by the desire for an expressed object of auvćcrrr|&lt;jev, which according to him is not strictly necessary {ibid.). Nowhere, however, does he imply that Plutarch is the culprit. 91 Dillon 1989. 1 do not wish to cast doubt on the applicability of the concept of ideological emendation as such - I consider it to be a very valuable tool indeed for the scholar of Middle Platonism - but merely contest its application to Plutarch's reading of Tim. 35a6. 1 would like to add that, for reasons outlined in the text, Plutarch is less likely to have used this trick than some other authors. Plutarch indeed appears to be more scrupulous than most of his contemporaries. 92 Ferrari 1999, 336; Ferrari and Baldi 2002, 28-30; 219 n. 7. See also Ferrari 2000a, 167; 2001, 547 (and 541), and already Schoppe 1994, 91 ('Gravierend ist, daß Plutarch das aírrwv der Vorlage durch aírrr|v ersetzt'). 93 Cf. supra , n. 20 and 21. 94 Hubert 1954, 144 app. crit. One further example from the De an. procr. may suffice: at 1015c, Plutarch cites Politicus 273b and according to the unanimous manuscript tradition reads TTdvxa Tà KaXá. Three Plato manuscripts and Clemens of Alexandria have the same reading; all other Plato manuscripts, Theodoretus, Proclus, Philoponus, and Simplicius read Trávra KaXá. Cf. Cherniss, 1976, 194 n. 2. 95 This is obviously not his own interpretation.</page><page sequence="24">160 GREEK, ARABIC, AND LATIN COMMENTARIES the argument that elsewhere Plato uses the same expression, öpyava xpóvou, for the stars. The underlying concern of both the anonymous interpreters and Plutarch is to reach consistency between the doctrine expressed in the passage at hand and other, undisputed, views of Plato's: the anonymous commentators wanted to change the text so as to bring it in line with the uncontested views of Plato, thereby avoiding the speculations of still others who make the highly controversial claim that Plato believed the earth to be in motion, or even that Plato changed his mind (1006cd). Plutarch, on the other hand, keeps the received text and explains how it is consistent with the views that Plato admittedly held (1006e). It seems unnatural to use Quaest. Plat. 8 as an indication for Plutarch's alleged willingness to tamper with texts,96 just because he knew of the practice of [ieTdypa&lt;(&gt;eiv. In fact, it rather goes to show his conservatism in textual matters. Plutarch refuses to take the easy way out by changing the text, opting instead to bring the received text in line, through careful interpretation, with established Platonic doctrine. Whereas the previous considerations are merely indicative, the following argument is decisive, I believe. It can be shown that at least one of Plutarch's predecessors interpreted the syntax of Tim. 35al-bl in a way identical to Plutarch's, one that is possible if one reads atJTfļv, but excluded by atJTcov. Indeed, in chapter 2 Plutarch criticises Xenocrates' interpretation of the composition of the soul. It is remarkable that, although Xenocrates assigns a different function and ontological value to the various components, the double mixture as he understands it consists of exactly the same steps:97 first indivisible and divisible essence are mixed; next sameness and difference are added to the mixture. Let us take a closer look at Xenocrates' view, as it is described by Plutarch (1012de). According to Xenocrates, the mixture of the indivisible and the divisible constitutes the generation of number, whereby the one imposes a limit on multiplicity (the indefinite dyad). But this is not yet soul (toDtov 8e |if|TTü) (¡jvxt)v tòv àpi0[iòv eivai), for it lacks the capacity to move and be moved (tò yàp klvt|tikòv Kal tò kivt|TÒv èvSeiv airrQ), until sameness and otherness are added: [A]fter the commingling of sameness and difference, the latter of which is the principle of motion and change while the former is that of rest, then the product is soul. (1012d) Xenocrates indeed defines soul as 'number itself being moved by itself' ( rf'ç tt)v oùaiav ápi0|iòv aírròv ùcf&gt;' èauToO kivov'±€vov aTro^Tļvdļievos', 1012d = frg. 68 Heinze). The operation performed by Xenocrates' demiurge is identical in structure to that described by Plutarch: indivisible being and divisible being are mixed first; this serves as a substrate to which sameness and otherness are added. We do not need to worry, for our purposes, about the value that Xenocrates assigns to the ingredients. What is important is that the structure of the mixture that he reads into the text is the same as Plutarch's: two entities are mixed together, and then two others are added to the previous blend. This 96 Cf. Gioè 1996, 303. Ferrari 2000a, 168, is careful enough to distinguish the two cases: in Quaest. Plat. 8 we have an 'emendatici dichiarata', whereas the alleged substitution of aťnr|v for aÚTíSv would be an ' emendatio surrettizia. ' Still he argues that by merely considering the emendation Plutarch shows his general willingness to adopt such strategies. What should be taken into account, however, is that in this section of the quaestio Plutarch is not presenting his own view and not even developing an argument of his own, but is just echoing an argument put forward by others (pace Froidefond 1987, 196-197). It is a typical feature of the C^nuia genre that a series of options are considered that have been suggested at some point in the history of exegesis (marked by particles such as f' - cf. 1006c), before the author develops his own view. Cf. Opsomer 1996. 97 The similarity has already been noticed by Cherniss, 262-263 n. a.</page><page sequence="25">OPSOMER: PLUTARCH 161 structure is excluded if one reads olvtlùv at Tim. 35a6.98 It is not unlikely, then, that Xenocrates' text, too, had ainrļv." Appendix 2: Outline of De animae procreatione in Timaeo In the manuscripts there is a transposition of a section that corresponds to the chapters 11- 20. The correct order of the text was restored by Andreas M. Maurommates in 1848 (p. 8 ' and 0 ' -iç ') and, independently, by Berthold Müller in 1870. Cf. Tannery 1894 (explains the function of chapters 11-20 in their restored context); Helmer 1937, 13; Thévenaz 1939, 358-359; Hubert - Drexler 1959, ad loc.; Cherniss 1976a, ad loc. and p. 134 with note b; Hershbell 1987, 238 note 23; 243. The most accurate and detailed description of the transposition is to be found in Decorps-Foulquier 1985.

One would have to explain how precisely the 'real' interpretation of Xenocrates was distorted by Plutarch.
