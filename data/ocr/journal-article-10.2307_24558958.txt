This winter, • the Zurich-based Galerie Nathan offered a comprehensive overview of the artists ^ work, accompanied by a catalogue con taining 45 large, full-color illustrations. The exhibition, which was organized chronologically, began with ink drawings from 1940 depicting humanoid shapes rendered in geometric strokes with refer ences to both Cubism and Surrealism. Shortly thereafter, the artist introduced watercolor, gouache, and, most signifi cantly for his aesthetic development, collage and found objects. Chaissac was guided by elements of chance as much as by creative inspiration, and in such images as Paysage anime (1941), anthropomorphic shapes and free forms roam in bizarre landscapes that appear to anticipate French Tachisme. His later works are increasingly dominated by forms reminis cent of the early Dubuffet (though some predate the work of this artist). In Composition (1947), for example, Chaissac breaks up the picture plane and renders it in a quasi naive, gestural style with pastose brushstrokes. Chaissac adopted various elements of Surrealism and Dada in his art, but closer scrutiny also reveals the recurring use of a rather more conventional cross motif.

Despite the authenticity of his work, it is the ingredient of doubt in Chaissac— who in essence remained an outcast— that determined his nearly life-long lack of recognition and commercial success. Although hailed early on among New York's Abstract Expressionists as a hero and an uncompromising voice, his work is only now being recognized for its sense of aesthetic purpose and its visually com pelling qualities. —Daniel Kletke Mario Ceroli: Carte. Istituto Nazionale per la Grafica, Rome. An exhibition on view at the Istituto Nazionale per la Grafica in Rome (through July 30) is the first in 40 years dedicated to the art on paper of Mario Ceroli. When it first appeared on the Italian art scene in the early 1960s, Ceroli s work immediately achieved considerable popularity. Along with the painter Mario Schifano, he worked in a style that was at first referred to as Italian Pop Art, but that effectively introduced the Arte Povera movement.
