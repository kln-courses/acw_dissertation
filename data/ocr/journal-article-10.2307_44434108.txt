Car Control by a Central Electronic System. Kurt Binder, Uwe Kiencke and Martin Zech- nall, Robert Bosch GmbH (West Germany). Coordination and concentration of different electronic functions within a car with the objective of functional cooperation and, if possible, incorporation into a single package to reduce costs and improve reliability is discussed. The alternatives of a Special Purpose Computer or a General Purpose Realtime Computer are described with regard to available sensor technology. 770002. Microprocessor Systems for On-Board Automo- tive Applications. M. David Freedman, Bendix Research Labs. In examining the alternatives for a cost-effective system design for an on-board automotive microprocessor, standard and specialized architectures must be compared. The architectures are examined as to their ability to perform basic control functions at low cost while retaining the ability for system expansion to handle additional control functions cost-effectively. In all cases, the real- time system requirements must be met despite the computational load on the microprocessor. A philosophy is presented so that the reader can gain an insight into the different possible design approaches. 770004. Microprocessors in the Automobile. E. Floyd Kvamme and Jerry R. Crowley, National Semi- conductor Corp. Engineers faced with the problem of designing automotive digital processors and control units with microprocessor chips must select from standard or custom designs. A new type of microprocessor which can be uniquely modified to tailor its performance to the specific needs of the automotive control system is presented. Examples of performance improvement are given for spark timing and dwell computations. Trade-offs in cost, performance, risk and development time for standard, modified standard, and custom micro- processors are discussed. Various development ap- proaches are reviewed and conclusions reached for future applications. 770005. Microprocessors Perform Engine Control Func- tions. G. Novis and J. Bryant, Texas Instruments Incorporated Semiconductor Group. An overview of Digital Engine Controls is presented in light of the various phases required to develop an engine control, microcomputer system. Topics include bread- boarding techniques, vehicle mounted hardware, pre- production circuit sets, custom LSI circuit development and advanced integration. A brief review of depletion mode NMOS technology is presented along with details of a suitable family of 16 bit microprocessors, memories, and digital/analog input/out- put functions that can be implemented with LSI ICs to perform real time engine control. Finally, a development time table is presented which highlights program milestones in a two year development cycle. 770006. Air-Fuel Ratio Control Using a Simple Micro- Processor. J. B. Russell and R. G. Nedbal, Essex Group - United Technology. A control system is described which uses a simple micro-processor in conjunction with a control algorithm which utilizes engine speed and mass air flow to result in air/fuel ratio control of Â± .5 A/F for the federal driving schedule. A comparison is made to the conventional speed/ density approach and the described micro-processor complexity is reduced; the memory requirements are halved; and the execution time is faster resulting in the possibility of assigning additional control task. 770008. Microprocessor Control of the Automobile En- gine. A. D. Toelle, Bendix Electronics and Engine Control Systems Group. This paper addresses the advantages and constraints associated with microprocessor control of the automotive engine. The advantages center around the power of the microprocessor to compute virtually any complex control law, and the ease with which it permits the development of new calibrations and new control laws. The constraints relate to the speed of computation and the fact that the digital concept provides input/output relationships in finite increments rather than as continuous functions. We examine here in some detail the functional power of a digital controller to manipulate these input/output rela- tionships, whether in the form of closed-form mathe- matical expressions, polynomial-series approximations, or multidimensional tables for linear interpolation. 770009. A Microprocessor Based Vehicular Engine Con- trol System Testbed. Allan J. Kotwicki, John M. Farrell, Norman W. Laursen and James E. Stevens, General Motors Research Labs. A microprocessor based vehicular engine control system testbed has been developed to make possible complex, interactive engine control experiments in the vehicle environment. Designed for flexibility, the on-board vehicle system incorporates two microprocessors, a variety of engine instrumentation, and controls over spark advance, air-fuel ratio, and exhaust gas recirculation. The two microprocessors have been linked to form an efficient computational network with sufficient capacity to im- plement most, if not all, engine control experiments. Also included in the vehicle are video displays which provide operator control and interaction with experimental engine control systems. 770010. The Use of Digital Fourier Transform Methods in Engine Noise Research. J. Y. Chung, Fluid Dynamics Research Dept., General Motors Research Labs. 17</page><page sequence="3">770011 -770016 Recent developments by the author in the application of digital Fourier transform (DFT) methods, i.e., coherence and transfer function techniques to the investigation of noise from an engine are discussed. The transfer functions are determined empirically and they can be used to determine the mechanism of noise generation of an engine. They can also be used to predict the effect on engine noise of various assumed cylinder pressure wave forms. Among other results, it is demonstrated that the rapid pressure rise in the cylinder pressure has a strong effect on engine noise. 1977 SA E Transactions 770011. On Factors of Noise Emitted by a Small Vehicle and Noise Level Simulation of Pass-By Test. Kaoru Masuko and Takeshi Abe, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan). To achieve a reduction in the exterior noise of a small vehicle at an early stage of design, we made an attempt to estimate the pass-by noise of the vehicle (ISO R-362 test standards) from measurements of the noise of the engine and exhaust system units. Accordingly, the factors producing exterior vehicle noise, viz., operating condition, noise source and noise propagation were considered, and it was found that the frequency spectrum of the noise source should be taken into account to more precisely estimate noise level and noise spectrum, since the characteristics of noise propagation depend on frequency. 770012. Combustion Noise and Ignition Delay in Diesel Engines. C. Bassoli, G. M. Cornetti and G. Levizzari, FIAT Research Center (Italy). Tests have been carried out on a current prechamber Diesel engine in different running conditions by using ASTM secondary reference fuels and experimental fuels of different hydrocarbon type composition and cetane quality. Combustion noise measurement was based on the detection of pressure oscillations or the engine head vibrations by means of FIAT electronic equipment. Experimental results show that changes in fuel composition which do not affect ignition delay can produce different combustion noise levels. Furthermore combustion noise intensity was measured by changing engine speed and load. 1977 SA E Transactions 770013. Characterization of Vehicle Deceleration Time Histories in the Analysis of Impact Dynamics. Matthew Huang, G. P. Lawson, B. K. Powell and J. H. Walker, Ford Motor Co. It is frequently desirable to construct a characterization of vehicle deceleration which is significantly simplified from its actual time history. A number of interesting techniques have been developed to perform this characterization based upon polynomial and Fourier- type series approx- imations and utilizing goodness of fit criteria related to both least squared error and the satisfaction of boundary conditions. Extensive mathematical occupant simulations indicate that characterizations involving as few as four parameters are adequate to describe the primary effects of complex vehicle deceleration time histories as they influence occupant dynamics with conventional restraint systems. 1977 SA E Transactions 770014. An Impact Moment Coefficient for Vehicle Collision Analysis. Raymond M. Brach, Univ. of Notre Dame. Many investigators have used the equations of impulse, momentum and energy to analyze the changes in velo- cities when two vehicles collide. The equations generally include the classical coefficient of restitution which is used as a measure of energy loss. These equations and the coefficient are based upon large forces and short-duration contact between the two bodies. In all real collisions contact is over a surface, and in many vehicle collisions, momentary or permanent interlocking of deformed parts occurs over this surface. This causes a moment to develop whose impulse can significantly affect the dynamics; most authors neglect or ignore this moment (1,2,3,4,5)*. In this paper, the equations of impact of two vehicles are derived including the moment impulse. An impact moment coefficient is defined. The value of this coefficient determines the extent to which a moment is developed between the two vehicles during impact. Two examples are presented. The first is a simple classical problem of two rigid bodies impacting over a common surface and is presented to illustrate the concept of the impact moment coefficient. The second example uses data from an actual collision of two automobiles and shows that in accident reconstruction problems, an a priori value of the impact moment coefficient is often not needed. 1977 SA E Transactions 770015. Computer Simulation of Car-To-Car Collisions. James E. Greene, Calspan Corp. Verification and application of computerized car-to-car collision simulations are the main subjects of this paper. The simulations are based on a lumped mass, resistive element modeling approach. Direct comparisons of simulation results with corresponding crash test data are presented for a number of impact conditions. Specific simulation applications are also discussed, one dealing with intervehicular collision compatibility and another involving the investigation of structural variation effects. It is concluded that a structural simulation approach of this nature can play an important part in automobile collision studies. 1977 SA E Transactions 770016. The Nature of Surfaces and Their Influence in Wear Mechanisms. Donald H. Buckley, NASA, Lewis Research Center. The wear of materials is strongly dependent upon the nature of the solid surfaces in contact, their properties and 18</page><page sequence="4">770018-770025 the nature of the films on them. Oxide films, orientation, crystal transformations, adhesive binding, crystal struc- ture, hardness and the presence of alloying agents are all shown to effect one or more of the forms of wear. The three most common forms of wear, adhesive, abrasive, and corrosive, are discussed in terms of the way each is affected by various material properties. Results presented indicate how wear can be optimized by concern for properties of materials. 770018. Elastohydrodynamic Lubrication and Wear of Cams Bearing Against Cylindrical Tappets. A. Dyson, Thornton Research Centre, Shell Re- search Ltd. (United Kingdom). This paper offers a theoretical treatment of the lubrication of a cam bearing against a cylindrical reciprocating tappet. The tappet lift, velocity and acceleration are specified as a function of camshaft angle, and the effect of variations in the curvature of the cylindrical face of the tappet is explored, the cam form being modified to maintain a constant tappet lift curve. A certain tappet curvature minimises the Hertzian pressure on the cam nose, but affords very poor lubrication conditions. To avoid high wear it is therefore necessary to purchase better lubrication at the sacrifice of higher Hertzian stresses. 770019. I. C. Engine Cam and Tappet Wear Experience. Roy F. Abell, Engine Components Div., Eaton Corp. The wear and modes of failure of commonly used cam and tappet materials are explored. Because of the differences in gasoline and diesel engines, the problems in these power plants are investigated separately. Successful material combinations are reviewed as are recommended techniques that will help insure desired durability levels. Some interesting cam and tappet problems and their solutions are recounted. 1977 SA E Transactions 770020. The 1976 Reports of the National Academy of Sciences on the Chlorofluorocarbon-Ozone Prob- lem. Frederick Kaufman, University of Pitts- burgh. Two chlorofluoromethanes, F-ll and F-12, have been produced in increasing amounts and used, worldwide, for a diversity of purposes, including spray-can propellants, working fluids for air conditioners and refrigerators, and agents for producing certain solid plastic foams. Among the effects of CFM release are: 1) The accumulation of CFMs in the atmosphere increases the absorption and emission of infrared radia- tion. This retards heat losses from the earth and effects the earth's temperature and climate. 2) More biologically active ultraviolet (DUV) reaches the earth's surface which results in increases in human skin cancer and other biological effects. Guidelines for possible future control and regulation of CFM release involve selective controls for each particular end use. 1977 SA E Transactions 770021. Chlorofluorocarbons in the Atmosphere - A Man- ufacturer's View. S. R. Orfeo, D. F. Harnish and H. Magid, Allied Chemical Corp. The status of the fluorocarbon-ozone depletion theory is reviewed from the standpoint of both theoretical calcu- lation and experimental observation. It is found that the mass balance calculated for chlorine species in the stratosphere is not in satisfactory agreement with direct observations. The general uncertainties of the calculation together with these discrepancies from observation ap- pears to justify the National Academy of Sciences' recommendations for continued study. The technical program of the fluorocarbon industry related to this problem is briefly discussed, as is Allied Chemical's efforts to identify alternate fluorocarbon materials. 770023. Engine Cooling System Design for Heavy Duty Trucks. Frank G. Rising, Ford Motor Co. A computational model is constructed for an engine cooling system for a heavy duty truck. The required performance data for the key model elements of engine, fan and radiator is discussed. An example is given for the cooling design engineer to demonstrate the principle use of the model in predicting cooling ATB performance and fan noise dB(A) contribution. The use of the model in analyzing vehicle wind tunnel cooling performance data is discussed. 1977 SA E Transactions 770024. Analysis of Durability Characteristics of Heavy Duty Radiators. Gregory S. T. Millard, Long Mfg. Div., Borg Warner Canada. Durability characteristics of heavy duty radiators are of ever increasing concern to truck, bus and construction equipment manufacturers. Evaluating life expectancy of heavy duty radiator designs has traditionally involved long and expensive testing procedures. Despite this, final evaluation usually occurs when service problems feed back by owner operators. This paper describes a technique which has been successfully employed, of relative testing, by coupling strain gauge techniques with systems modelling. Relative stress levels in various radiator components can be compared to either existing successful designs or absolute life expectancy estimated using SN curves. The preparation of a tube, critical in determining tube to header joint shear stress is described. The technique can be used to examine design modifications such as header reinforcements or ferrule design and for determining assembly tolerances for manufacturing processing. 770025. An Improved Cooling System for Military and Heavy Duty Vehicles. Edward J. Rambie, U.S. 19</page><page sequence="5">770026 - 770030 Army Tank- Automoti ve Research and Devel- opment Command. A cooling development program is described for an improved cooling system for the M551 (Armored Recon- naissance/Airborne Assault Vehicle). The M551 speci- fication was to cool at 125F at 17 tons gross vehicle weight. Requirements for additional ammunition, armor kits and stowage increased gross operating weight to 20 tons and increased in-service cooling problems. Field operations have since demonstrated the need to provide for an improved cooling system design for the upweighted vehicle. The original liquid cooled system incorporated water-to-oil engine and transmission oil coolers in series with the engine radiator. The improved design separates engine and transmission heat rejection by incorporation of air-to-oil transmission cooler behind the radiator (cooling air flows in series first through the radiator, then through the transmission air-to-oil cooler). By this means reduc- tions of engine coolant and engine oil temperature of 14F resulted while the transmission oil temperature was reduced by 39F. These gains were made over the best previous cooling condition in converter operation without increasing fan speed. The improved cooling system allowed for increased cooling capacity so that the 20 ton upweighted version of the vehicle could be cooled to the limit of track slip without exceeding allowable critical temperature limits. The principle of using a large area low restriction air-to-oil cooler for transmission oil cooling can be applied to other liquid cooled military heavy duty vehicles to make major gains in vehicle cooling capacity possible. Design considerations for this improved cooling system, laboratory testing at US Army Tank- Automoti ve Research and Development Command in Warren, Mich- igan and field testing at US Army Yuma Proving Ground in Yuma, Arizona are reported. 770026. Brake Dynamometer Evaluation of the Detroit Traffic Road Test. H. W. Schwartz and S. K. Rhee, Research Labs Bendix Corp. Road testing of friction materials is a complex, time consuming and expensive activity. This paper describes the collection of braking data from a test vehicle having four wheel disc brakes and development of a brake dynamometer simulation test for the Detroit Traffic Road Test. Several dual-ended brake dynamometer simulation tests were conducted in a programmed, unattended mode over weekends where about 1600 road test miles were accumulated each weekend. Feasibility of using dyna- mometer simulation for road tests was shown by obtaining a correlation in the disc pad wear in both vehicle and dynamometer tests. Temperature effects on wear were seen in both the vehicle and dynamometer tests. There- fore, disc pad temperatures must be closely monitored or controlled during the Detroit Traffic Road Test or its simulation and the effects of temperature must be included in determining disc pad life or to obtain a meaningful comparison between two friction materials. 770027. Use of Coherence and Frequency Response Functions to Locate and Define Vibration Noise Sources in Rolling Tires. A. C. Eberhardt and W. F. Reiter, Mechanical and Aerospace Engi- neering North Carolina State Univ. The procedure for measuring and analyzing in-service tire vibration and sound data is described. Signal analysis techniques are applied to obtain tire vibration spectral histories, vibration-to-sound coherence, and vibration frequency response functions. Evaluation of the coherence function demonstrates the existence of a statistical relationship between tire vibration and sound. Vibration spectral histories display the decay of energy in the tire structure. Use is made of the frequency response function to determine the relative levels of vibration in the tread and sidewall regions. These results define the vibration noise source location and size. 770029. Survey of Excitation Techniques Applicable to the Testing of Automotive Structures. D. Brown and G. Carbon, Univ. of Cincinnati; and K. Ramsey, Hewlett Packard Corp. With the implementation of digital signal processing, frequency response measurements are not limited to swept sine testing. With the discrete Fourier Transform, any physically realizable signal can be used for excitation. The best technique depends on the application, available equipment, the presence of measurement noise, the linearity of the test object, and the time available in which to execute the test. In this paper a number of excitation techniques have been described. All of these techniques have advantages and disadvantages which have been described in the text of this paper. 770030. Vibration Analysis by Double Pulsed Laser Holography. A. Felske and A. Happe, Research and Development Div., Volks wagenwerk AG (Germany). The use of a giant pulse laser with 30 ns double pulses makes it possible to holograph different phases of an object vibration within time intervals from 100 fis to 1 ms onto the same plate. The vibration phases into which the first and second laser pulse are fired can be exactly preselected by means of an electronic trigger system. The simultaneous reconstruction of the holograms taken by the first and the second laser pulse generates on the object surface a system of interference fringes which are loci of equal displacement. Adjoining fringes correspond to displacement differences of half a wavelength of the laser's light. In this way, it is possible, for instance, to visualize the vibration pattern of car bodies and drive units excited by the running engine. The method of measurement and a hologram camera especially constructed for making double pulsed holo- grams of automobiles are described. Several examples of application are quoted in order to illustrate this technique. 1977 SA E Transactions 20</page><page sequence="6">770031 -770039 770031. Pistons for High Output Diesel Engines. Man- fred D. Roehrle, Mahle GmbH (Germany). Along with the increase in specific output of internal combustion engines the thermal and mechanical loadings on the pistons have grown continually. This paper deals with modern piston designs used on Diesel engines for commercial vehicles, railway traction and marine pro- pulsion. A survey on the comprehensive research and development work on pistons and explanations are given by means of practical examples how part of piston trials can be carried out in the laboratory. 1977 SA E Transactions 770032. Simulating the Lubrication System of a Diesel Engine. E. A. Neu, J. A. Wade and A. C. Chu, Cummins Engine Co. The entire engine lubrication system has been represented by a series-parallel network of flow passages and flow elements. The pressure distribution and flow rates in the network were computed according to pressure-flow characteristics of each element. The pressure-flow rela- tionship for each network element was estimated using empirical pipe friction, expansion, and bend loss coef- ficients, as well as by using test rig results and a steady-state journal bearing model. The journal bearing model is basically that of the classical short bearing model with provision for heat transfer to the oil and the relative thermal growth of the journal and bearing system. When compared with diesel engine tests, the simu- lation predicted the pressure distribution throughout the engine and the flow rate through each branch within 10%. Although predicted bearing temperature rise data agreed well with steady-state bench test results, they were as much as 50% lower than temperature rise data measured on the engine. 770033. Design and Development Criteria for Automotive Diesels. R. Bertodo, Perkins Engines Group Ltd. (United Kingdom). A field survey of diesel engines in light commercial trucks showed that the failure profile could be described by an early failure region, indicative of manufacturing quality, and an exponential distribution, representing the relia- bility of the engine, merging into a log-normal wearout region. An overall reliability of 0.9 after a year's service was apparently required. Engine availability could be improved significantly, in a cost effective manner, by the selective upgrading of components and sub-assemblies according to their criticality. Conventional design criteria do not recognise the need for modifying the failure risk of individual parts and assemblies according to their likely impact on the operational behaviour of the engine as a whole. An alternative methodology was derived, therefore, as part of the design and validation of a 5.8/(354 in3) engine intended predominantly for the N. American Class VI truck market. The development of this revised design and development approach is described. 770034. The Application of Pulse Converters to Auto- motive Jour Stroke Cycle Engines. R. S. Benson, University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (United Kingdom); and G. I. Alexander, Liverpool Polytechnic (United King- dom). Part 1 describes a gas dynamic model to represent a pulse converter. In this model the pulse converter is represented by a three-way branch with pressure losses. Pressure loss coefficients are determined from steady flow tests and included in the boundary conditions for non-steady flow. Non-steady tests on pulse converters fitted in a four cylinder turbocharged engine showed that using the model, predictions of the influence of pulse converter area ratio on wave form and amplitude give good agreement with experiment. Part 2 gives results of a comprehensive investigation on the application of pulse converters to a four stroke automotive engine. It is shown that using the gas dynamic model presented in Part 1 of the paper in a simulation program the optimum combination of pulse converter and turbocharger size may be determined. This combination was confirmed in the experimental programme. The experiments and predictions showed an improvement in turbocharging efficiency with the optimum combination with a resultant increase in engine power. The combi- nation enabled an improvement in engine back-up torque characteristics to be achieved. 1977 SA E Transactions 770036. Does Public Transportation Offer Product Aug- mentation to an Automotive Company? Tage Karlsson, AB Volvo (Sweden). The paper deals with the liberations and actions taken by an automotive company in order to augment its product program by equipment for the Public Transportation Sector. Philosophizing over the inherent conservatism in a company organized for volume production, the author concludes that there is a lot of potential for product augmentation from the Public Transportation field, but after closer scrutinization the number of possibilities has shrunken considerably. 770039. Highway Research and Vehicle Design for the 80's. David Solomon, Environmental Design and Control Div. Federal Highway Admin., U.S. Dept. of Transp. Similar to the classic problem of which comes first, the chicken or the egg, vehicles are designed to fit available highways; highways are designed to fit available vehicles, and both must consider the capabilities and limitations of the driver. Discussed in this paper will be certain aspects of the vehicle-highway/chicken-egg problem. Included will be (a) recently completed research that has or may impact upon vehicle design, (b) ongoing and planned highway research with vehicle implications, and (c) other considerations and uncertainties of the future that may impact upon both highways and vehicles. 21</page><page sequence="7">770040 â  770045 770040. The Trend to Smaller and Lighter Cars - Does It Present an Increased Challenge to the Chassis Engineer? Leonard Segel, Highway Safety Re- search Inst., University of Michigan. Observations are made with respect to the manner in which the physics of the motor car make it more difficult for the chassis engineer to achieve ride, handling, and braking performance levels in smaller cars which are comparable to the performance levels achievable in larger cars. It is also observed that design trends aimed at making the motor car a more efficient transporter of people contrast markedly with current ideas for making the motor truck a more efficient transporter of freight. 770042. An Experimental Study of the Delayed Mixing Stratified Charge Engine Concept. L. W. Evers, P. S. Myers and O. A. Uyehara, Univ. of Wisconsin. Preliminary computer studies indicated that the delayed mixing stratified charge engine concept might produce low emissions of nitrogen oxide and still provide rea- sonable efficiency and power. In the delayed mixing stratified charge engine concept a fuel-rich region is burned followed by air being mixed into the rich products. Nitrogen oxide formation was initially limited in the rich product mixtures because of the lack of oxygen and after mixing by the relatively low temperatures due to charge expansion. A single cylinder engine was used to simulate the delayed mixing stratified charge combustion process. A rich charge was drawn into the engine through the carburetor. Combustion was initiated with a spark; later air was injected to complete the combustion process. The results showed that emissions could be controlled by the delayed mixing combustion process. The engine specific power was also at reasonable levels. However, the engine efficiency was low. 770043. Time Resolved Measurements of the Exhaust from a Jet Ignition Prechamber Stratified Charge Engine. A. Ekchian, J. B. Heywood and J. M. Rife, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Massachu- setts Institute of Technology. In the jet-ignition prechamber stratified-charge spark- ignition engine, the fuel-air mixture at the time of combustion is non-uniform. Instantaneous exhaust mass flow rates and emission concentrations from this engine were measured and used to determine the degree to which this charge stratification persists in the products of combustion immediately downstream of the exhaust valve throughout the exhaust process. In all the cases studied no appreciable variations, during the exhaust process, were detected either in the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gases as a function of time or in the instantaneous concentrations of C02, 02 and NOx. The experimentally obtained instantaneous HC and CO concentrations in the exhaust, however, displayed large fluctuations and were used to study the sources of these two pollutants in this engine.

Charles Jones, Harold D. Lamping, David M. Myers and Robert W. Loyd, Curtiss-Wright. Development progress of the unthrottled direct injected Stratified Charge Rotary Combustion Engine Program at the Curtiss-Wright Corporation is updated since the 1974 status reported in SAE Paper 741206. Emphasis during this period has been on performance improvements in the automotive road load range. Results are given for a number of variations tested since that date, including engine performance with gasoline and other fuels. The baseline configuration has been further improved and new designs which have improved fuel consumption and reduced hydrocarbon emissions are described in the paper. These data are presented showing steady-state SFC equal or better than representative automotive diesel engines; comparable untreated emission data are pre- sented with HC emissions reduced to a representative band level of automotive carbureted engines and with relatively low CO and NOx. Discussion: Harvey A. Burley, General Motors Corp. 1977 SAE Transactions 770045. Validation of a Turbulent Flame Propagation Model for a Spark Ignition Engine. F. D. McCuiston, Jr. and G. A. Lavoie, Fuels and Lubricants Dept., Ford Motor Co.; and C. W. Kauffman, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering, Univ. of Cincinnati. An analytical and experimental investigation of the combustion process in a spark ignition engine has been performed. The analysis is based on a flame propagation model developed by Blizard and Keck (9) which assumes that turbulent eddies are engulfed at an entrainment speed ue and burn in a characteristic time t, equal to the eddy radius /e, divided by the laminar flame speed u,. Meas- urements were made of burning intervals and ignition delays on a C.F.R. engine. The model could be adjusted to give correct trends in burning intervals for variations in equivalence ratio, EGR, compression ratio, spark timing, and level of turbulence. However, the amount of variation was less than that observed in experiment. Predicted burning intervals increased with RPM contrary to experimental data. Predicted ignition delays were a factor of four less than experimentally observed. The difficulties with the model are thought to be due to assumptions of constant r and uc. It is recommended that future work on the 'eddy-entrainmenÅ¥ type of model be directed at removing this restriction and at under- standing the behavior of r and ue during the engine cycle 22</page><page sequence="8">77046 - 770052 in terms of measurable turbulence scales, and ultimately in terms of engine operating variables such as RPM, spark timing and equivalence ratio.

Munenobu Tanaka, Tokyo University of Ag- riculture and Technology (Japan); and Enoch J. Durbin, Princeton University. The transient response of a carburetor engine was studied experimentally. The results show that fuel and air flow at the carburetor respond instantly to throttle motion, however at the cylinder, dynamic lags in fuel flow make large variations in air fuel ratio which appear as delays in the change in maximum cylinder pressure. Initial air fuel ratio has a large effect on this maximum cylinder pressure response, and its time lags vary in proportion to inlet pipe length and inversely proportion to engine speed. An approximate theory on the fuel film flow was established to explain these results. Discussion: T. D. Barker, Ford Motor Co. 1977 SA E Transactions 770047. Effects of Exhaust Manifold Configuration on a Turbocharged Engine Employing Charge Strat- ification. Paul J. Kern and Oleh B. Koropey, Dept. of Engrg., U.S. Military Academy. A standard cast iron manifold and a thermal reactor were tested on a lean burning Texaco Controlled Combustion System (TCCS) L141 engine. The purpose of the inves- tigation was to study the interrelationships between engine, manifold/reactor, and turbocharger; and to evaluate the possible effects of the reactor's presence on fuel efficiency. Increased energy inputs into the turbine, higher compressor pressure ratios, and marginal reduction in exhaust gas CO were observed with the reactor; however, an overall 4.6% derogation in bsfc with the thermal reactor was also observed. This was due to greater pumping losses, as evidenced by consistently lower pressure differential between the intake and exhaust valves. 770048. Tracked Vehicle Ride Dynamics Computer Pro- gram. Paul Wheeler, Chrysler Corp. A mathematical model has been developed and pro- grammed on the digital computer to simulate vehicle dynamics when subjected to terrain inputs. The present version is a non-linear two-dimensional model in the longitudinal and vertical directions. Two degrees of freedom (pitch and bounce) are associated with the vehicle hull with an additional degree of freedom associated with each roadwheel station on one side of the vehicle. Comparison of computer results with recent field test data show that the mathematical model accurately simulates actual vehicle dynamics. 770049. Dynamic Analysis of Machinery Via Program DYM AC. B. Paul, Mechanical Engrg. and Applied Mechanics Dept., Univ. of Pennsyl- vania. This paper described a computer program- DYMAC-which finds displacements, velocities, and accelerations in planar machinery subjected to forces of a virtually unrestricted nature. The user may also specify the motion of any parts of the system (e.g. speed of a crankshaft), and prescribe general relationships between the motions of different points in the system, as illustrated by an example of a spring-suspended vehicle moving over a rough road. It is shown how the information which describes the geometric, inertial, and topological prop- erties of the system must be organized. Readers should be able to determine if DYMAC will serve their needs. 770050. Interactive Simulation of Machinery with Friction and Impact Using DRAM. M. A. Chace and J. C.

The Program has been made interactive by increasing solution speed and providing for output of a moving drawing of the mechanism on time shared graphic display terminals. At the same time program generality has been expanded by including effects such as Coulomb friction and impact. 1977 SA E Transactions 770051.

Non-Linear Model Formulation for the Static and Dynamic Analyses of Front Suspensions. Ken- neth N. Morman, Jr., Ford Motor Co. A three degree-of-freedom mathematical model formu- lation for a double-wishbone front suspension is presented which treats the effects of the tire vertical stiffness, the fore-and-aft bushing compliance in the lower arm, the compliance in a steering linkage and the inertia of the suspension links. The model equations are derived retaining all non-linearities associated with large changes in the geometric configuration of the suspension system and are solved within a digital computer program which computes the suspension force and displacement response to prescribed ground terrain inputs at the tire patch. 23</page><page sequence="9">770053 - 770059 Results obtained with the computer model are presented and compared with test measurements. 770053. Simulation of a Vehicle Suspension with the ADAMS Computer Program. N. Orlandea, Deere &amp; Company; and M. A. Chace, The University of Michigan. This paper describes a computer simulation of the front suspension of a 1973 Chevrolet Malibu using the ADAMS (Automatic Dynamic Analysis of Mechanical Systems) computer program. The model was proposed by the SAE Fatigue Design and Evaluation Committee for evaluating the speed, economy and accuracy of various computer simulations in predicting displacements and loads in a suspension system. A comparison between experimental and simulated results is given. 770054. A Simulation Program for Large Dynamic De- formation of Vehicles. Ivor K. Mclvor, Univer- sity of Michigan. This paper describes the program UMVCS-1 which was developed for the computer simulation of vehicle crash. The program is based on a modular concept designed to give the user maximum flexibility in model synthesis. For a given simulation the user specifies the vehicle through an alphanumeric "physical description" of his model. The program translates this input and assembles the necessary equations for the mathematical model. Storage assignment and dimensioning are all handled internally in the program. Modeling elements include both finite element beams and mechanisms which are three dimensional generalizations of "resistances" commonly used in one dimensional simulations. Program capability is illustrated through the analysis of an actual vehicle crash test. 770055. Computer Simulation of Large-Displacement Impact Dynamics. D. M. Norris, M. van Thiel and B. Moran, Lawrence Livermore Lab Univ. of California. A two-dimensional Lagrangian explicit finite difference (EFD) computer program is used to simulate three large-deformation dynamic tests: the Charpy V-notch impact toughness test, oblique impact of a cylindrical rod on armor plate, and driving of copper liners by a shaped high-explosive charge. The relationship of the EFD formulation to the more recently developed explicit finite element (EFE) formulation is discussed. 1977 SAE Transactions 770056. Kinematical Implications of Side Slip for Single- Track Vehicles. Thomas R. Kane, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg. Stanford Univ. The fact that single-track vehicles do not necessarily roll without slipping must be taken into account in the analysis of certain motions of such vehicles. This paper deals with kinematical questions arising under these circumstances. Constraint equations are formulated for motions involving side slip unaccompanied by longitu- dinal slip, expressions for side slip velocities are devel- oped, and comparisons are drawn between the kine- matical consequences of assuming rolling without slip and rolling with side slip. 770057. Steady Turning of Single-Track Vehicles. Thomas R. Kane, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Stanford Univ. Steady turning of single-track vehicles is examined by reference to dynamical equations applicable when rolling takes place without slip. In formulating these equations, advantage is taken of the fact that one may linearize in the steering angle without restricting the turning radius. This makes it possible to arrive at equations which permit one to obtain both numerical results and general insights rather easily. 770058. Validation of Human Body Modeling for Dynam- ic Simulation. D. H. Robbins, R. O. Bennett and J. M. Becker, Highway Safety Research Insti- tute, The University of Michigan. Although several mathematical models of the response of the human body to an impact environment have been developed, their acceptance as research, development, and design tools among the various groups involved in the field of automotive safety has been limited because of a lack of confidence in their ability to predict real events. A primary reason for this is the limited number of corre- lation and validation studies which have been conducted. However, orderly procedures and user aids are now being developed which should encourage the validation process and enhance the status of crash victim simulators. 770059. Trapping of Lead Particulates in Automotive Exhaust. Martin B. Treuhaft, Dept. of Engine and Vehicle Research, Southwest Research Institute; and John P. Wisnewski, Houston Chemical Co., Div. of PPG Industries, Inc. Systems for controlling automotive exhaust particulates, especially lead particulates, are discussed and a suitable method for determining automotive particulate emission levels during on-the-road vehicle operation is presented. Data is presented for a large number of vehicles. The evaluation system is suited for use with a large variety of vehicles during all modes of vehicle operation. A total emissions control system, capable of meeting the strict 1978 statutory gaseous emissions levels with virtually zero particulate emissions, is also discussed. This emissions control system is compatible with leaded and unleaded fuels. The economic implications of lead additive restric- tion, as a means of reducing lead airborne particulates, are briefly considered. It is concluded that the reduction of airborne lead, by trapping it in the exhaust system, is more cost effective and energy conservative than is reduction by regulation of the fuel supply. Particulate traps coupled with lead-tolerant emission control systems allow this alternative. 24</page><page sequence="10">770060 - 770065 770060. Evaluation of Sulfate Trapping Candidates - Re- sults From Dynamometer and Vehicle Screening Tests. G. J. Barnes, J. C. Summers and D. R. Fredericks, General Motors Corp. The performance of potential sulfate sorbents was evaluated using an engine-dynamometer screening test procedure. Bulk and supported sorbents were tested. The two most promising sorbents were a bulk CaO preparation and alumina supported Na. The CaO sorbent appeared to be inherently non-selective between sulfates and S02. Calcining this sorbent in a C02 atmosphere resulted in increased pellet crush strength and reduced volume expansion upon use. The Na/Al203 sorbent had good activity and selectivity, but may lack capacity and be subject to leaching losses of Na-compounds. Vehicle and dynamometer durability testing of these two sorbents was conducted. From these preliminary tests, it was determined that neither met all the criteria of an ideal sorbent for vehicle use. 770061. Immunological Studies on Platinum Complexes and Their Possible Relevance to Autocatalysts. M. J. Cleare, Johnson Matthey Research Centre. Preliminary tests on extracts from exhaust solids support the hypothesis, deduced from tests on refinery workers and estimates of the types of Pt compounds likely to be formed, that no allergenic species are emitted. A series of Pt complexes has been used for allergy tests on a number of refinery workers who are known to be sensitive to hexachloroplatinate [PtCl6]2" salts. The results show that the allergy-eliciting compounds appear to be confined to a very small group of ionic complexes containing reactive halogen ligands. Neutral complexes and those containing strongly bound groups are totally inactive. These variations are discussed in terms of established kinetic and thermo-dynamic parameters and their relevance to autocatalysts. 770062. Characterization of Sulfate and Gaseous Emis- sions from California Consumer-Owned, Cata- lyst-Equipped Vehicles. R. J. Herling, R. D. Gafford, R. R. Carlson and A. Lyles, Olson Labs, Inc.; and R. L. Bradow, Environmental Protection Agency. This paper describes a study in which approximately 100 1975 and 1976 model-year, consumer-owned, catalyst- equipped vehicles in California were tested to measure the regulated exhaust gas emissions and particulate sulfate emissions. Each vehicle was tested three times over a period of approximately 1 1 months. All tests were conducted with the owner's brand of commercial fuel which was analyzed for sulfur and lead concentrations, Reid vapor pressure, distillation and API gravity. Emis- sion data were analyzed to determine if there were any significant differences in sulfate and regulated gaseous emission levels between various subgroups of catalyst- equipped vehicles, and to derive average emission factors for sulfate emissions. 1977 SA E Transactions 770063. The Molecular Analysis of Sulfate Species in Environmental Aerosols Using Chemical Ioni- zation Mass Spectrometry. T. M. Harvey and D. Schuetzle, Ford Motor Co. Speciation of sulfurous acid, sulfuric acid and ammonium sulfate collected from the aerosol phase on a Fluoropore filter has been readily accomplished using techniques of chemical ionization mass spectrometry combined with thermal separation. Thermal separation of ammonium hydrogen sulfate from ammonium sulfate was not pos- sible. Spectral separation of these species by selective ionization is proposed. Analysis of sulfate aerosols collected from ambient air and catalyzed vehicle emis- sions is described. It was found that sulfuric acid aerosol was rapidly converted to ammonium sulfate or ammo- nium hydrogen sulfate in the presence of ambient concentrations of ammonia. Ambient samples collected in the Detroit metropolitan area have been found to contain only trace quantities of sulfuric acid. Sulfate samples collected from a dilution tube into which catalyzed vehicle exhaust was injected were found to contain significant quantities of ammonium sulfate in addition to sulfuric acid. The rate of sulfate specie volatilization from the filter media was found to be markedly affected by the ammonium sulfate particle size on the filter, thus neces- sitating the generation of appropriate standards. Im- pregnation of the collection filter with an appropriate material that will convert sulfuric acid upon collection to a species which is unaffected by ambient ammonia con- centrations can permit subsequent quantitation of am- bient H2SC&gt;4 by mass spectrometry. 770064. Emissions From In-Use Catalyst Vehicles. R. Gibbs, G. Wotzak, S. Byer, R. Johnson, B. Hill and P. Werner, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Division of Air Resources. A sample of forty-nine 1975 and 1976 catalyst equipped vehicles operated in the Albany, New York area have been tested in "as received" condition for gaseous and particulate emissions at approximately 5,000 mile inter- vals. Each of the 127 tests includes a 1975 FTP, a one-hour 50 mph steady cruise, and five SET-7 (sulfate) cycles, all run on tank fuel. Test data includes HC, CO, NOx, S02, idle HC and CO, soluble particulate sulfate, and fuel economy. Summaries of emission rates are presented as a function of catalyst type, manufacturer, and emission parameters. Specific attention is given to release of stored sulfur during idle periods between test driving modes. Data is also presented on plugged converters found on high mileage police vehicles. This serious plugging appears to be the result of deposition of manganese and oil additive related compounds in mono- lith cells on cars run on fuel containing MMT additive. 770065. Sulfate Analysis by the Barium Perchlorate Titration and the BCA Methods. Arnold Prostak, 25</page><page sequence="11">770067 - 770075 Milford Vehicle Emission Laboratory, General Motors Corp. The barium ion titration method as used for determining the amount of sulfuric acid and soluble sulfate aerosol emitted by automobiles is described. Results obtained by this method are compared with those obtained by the barium chloranilate (BCA) method. It is concluded that the described titration method is a low-cost and conven- ient method for the analysis of automotive derived sulfates. Its precision is good, its sensitivity is adequate, and its accuracy is as good as the BCA method. 770067. (SP-415) Tightening Process Equipment Gas- keted Joints Safely. B. G. Staples, The Pfaudler Co., Div. of Sybron Corp. Torque versus load measurements were conducted on SA- 193, Grade B-7 bolts to establish friction character- istics under dry and lubricated conditions, using strain gages with appropriate read-out. Similar torque-load ratio figures were obtained for a series of different size clamps, employing a Tinius-Olsen tensile testing machine for which suitable fixtures were designed and constructed. With the data produced from these investigation and projected failure loads, it was possible to establish maximum torque limits which would fall within prede- termined safety requirements. The equipment used in this investigation is explained and the calculations discussed. 770068. (SP-415) The Relationship Between Bolt Load and Leak Rate in a Gasketed Joint. Harold D. Raut, Varysburg Gasket Research Lab. A method of testing gaskets for leak rate under varying bolt loads is described. The date, curves and procedures are given for a test to determine the effect of preload on the subsequent leak rate behavior of a joint with an asbestos gasket. 770069. (SP-415) A Unique Concept in Gasket Tech- nology for Reducing Vehicle Weight and Lower- ing Flange Design Costs. M. T. Passarella and R. G. Farnam, F. D. Farnam Co. A gasket "system" consisting of a high-density core unitized with "tailored" stress-risers, permits the user of choosing rigid and/or lighter component flange castings; with a potential reduction of the number of capscrews needed for a durable flange joint. Subsequent loading necessary for a conventional compression seal could therefore be reduced, allowing a further reduction in tensile strength requirements for the mechanical fasteners. The elimination, or relief, of tight flange surface-ma- chining tolerances are then possible, reflecting a cost savings. 770070. (SP-415) Performance Criteria of Gasket Mate- rials. Alexander L. Gordon, Federal-Mogul Corp. Many physical and functional properties of gasket materials may be involved in determining their per- formance under specific sets of conditions. The selection of gasket materials is complex and based upon the interpretation of numerous interrelated factors which may affect performance. Certain guidelines may be employed to facilitate the selection process in a systematic manner with a good level of reliability. 770071. (SP-415) Testing Gasket Materials for Design Purposes. Robert H. Swick, W. L. Gore &amp; Associates, Inc. Energy, pollution abatement, and economic factors are increasing the sealing requirements for gaskets. Seala- bility, Creep Relaxation, and Gasket Compression Tests are described which permit the logical design of a gasket to make and assure a long time satisfactory seal for each application. Test equipment is described and an example of sealing wavy flanges is given. 770072. (SP-415) Sealability Characteristics of Gasket Materials. Frank J. Kessler, Armstrong Cork Co. A test assembly used to evaluate the sealability of materials at various flange pressures is described. The assembly, and the techniques which have been developed permit a wide range of compositions to be evaluated for sealing characteristics. The apparatus is designed to use an inert gas, hence interaction between the gasket material and the sealed medium is at a minimum. Data obtained with this test have been correlated with actual field applications. 770073. (SP-415) Formed-In-Place Gaskets: Concept vs Reality. Joseph Tokarski, Loctite Corp. The concept of formed-in-place gaskets is an attractive one. The ability to make any size and shape of gasket on the spot and the low inventory involved has prompted many to try the formed-in-place principle at one time or another. However, failures have occurred because of an incomplete understanding of the mechanics of formed- in-place joints. These mechanics are discussed along with application methods for formed-in-place materials. 770074. (SP-415) ASTM Classification System for Gas- ket Materials and Its Use. Robert W. Stevenson, Armstrong Cork Co. The origin and purpose of ASTM Standard F 104 - Clas- sification System for Nonmetallic Gaskets - is described as a method of characterizing a gasket material. The nature of its flexibility and versatility are outlined. Examples are made illustrating how the system is meant to be used by consumers who have definite requirements and wish to secure a gasket material which manufacturers could provide to meet these needs. 1977 SA E Transactions 770075. Engine Control Optimization for Best Fuel Economy with Emission Constraints. E. A. Rishavy and S. C. Hamilton, Chevrolet Engi- 26</page><page sequence="12">770076-770081 neering, General Motors Corp.; J. A. Ayers and M. A. Keane, General Motors Research Labo- ratories. This new approach for improving fuel economy uses computer programs to optimize and tailor an engine's fuel, EGR and spark control in the laboratory. New forms of engine and vehicle test data are used as inputs. This includes a simple simulation of the catalytic converter. The emission engineer is in control of the process via a special interactive program at a computer terminal. He combines his know-how with the computer programs to create a feasible engine control calibration for vehicle evaluation. The programs can also be used to study tradeoffs of optimized fuel economy vs emissions for a vehicle. Although presently limited to warmed up oper- ation, the optimization procedure has proved to be valid and useful. 770076. Optimization of Automotive Engine Calibration for Better Fuel Economy - Methods and Appli- cations. J. E. Auiler, J. D. Zbrozek and P. N. Blumberg, Engineering and Research Staff, Ford Motor Co. A method is presented for determining an optimum engine calibration that maximizes fuel economy for the CVS-H cycle subject to a set of emission constraints. The method combines the results of a powertrain simulation with steady state engine dynamometer emissions and fuel flow data to project cycle emission and fuel economy values. Dynamic Programming is used to allocate emis- sion contributions among selected speed/load points to maximize projected cycle fuel economy. The correspond- ing engine calibration is then directly inferred from the optimum emission allocation. Typical results for 2.3 liter and 400 CID engines are presented. 1977 SA E Transactions 770077. Engine Mapping Methodology. R. E. Baker and E. E. Daby, Engineering and Research Staff, Ford Motor Co. Developing engine calibrations to help achieve improved fuel economy, emissions and performance has become an increasingly complicated task as emission standards become more stringent and fuel economy standards become effective. A methodology was devised to project the economy that a specific vehicle could achieve over a selected driving cycle. This method can be used to determine the potential of control systems, exhaust treatment devices and drivetrain configurations to im- prove economy at specified emission levels. Optimum engine calibrations are defined to utilize these devices fully, from which automatic engine calibration strategies can be developed for vehicle verification. 770078. A Computerized On-Line Approach to Calcu- lating Optimum Engine Calibrations. John F. Cassidy, General Motors Research Labs., Gen- eral Motors Corp. A current design objective of the automotive engineer is to calibrate the passenger car spark ignited engine for best fuel economy for a given level of exhaust emission performance. The need to achieve the best possible calibrations has motivated the application of mathemat- ical optimization techniques to this problem. This paper describes a new on-line technique in which an engine dynamometer minicomputer, programmed with an opti- mization algorithm, automatically determines the opti- mum calibrations for spark advance, air-fuel ratio, and exhaust gas recirculation at fixed speed-load operating points. These points are selected by analysis of measured or simulated performance of the engine in a specified vehicle. 1977 SA E Transactions 770079. Computerized Five Parameter Engine Mapping. Lakshmi S. Vora, General Motors Research Labs., General Motors Corp. Systematic and computerized mapping procedures were developed to characterize the performance of an engine as a function of speed, load, ignition timing, air-fuel ratio, and percent of exhaust gas recirculation. Using these techniques a map of carbureted, 5.7 /, spark ignited V-8 engine has been obtained. This five parameter map data base resides in a large computer system which allows access by multiple users. The mapping procedures com- bine a rational approach to the selection of speed-load points for engine mapping with a computerized test incorporating a slow sweep of the independent variables with simultaneous data acquisition. The result is more accurate engine characterization data with less effort and in less time than is possible with conventional procedures. The high data density of this map enabled the devel- opment of valid models for fuel and emissions by curve fitting techniques. 770080. Design Considerations on a Thermal Energy Storage Stirling Engine Automobile. G. A. A. Asselman, C. L. Spigt and R. J. Meijer, Philips Research Laboratories (Holland). The external heating system of the Stirling engine enables it to be coupled to a variety of energy sources. In the field of unconventional heating systems a high temperature thermal energy storage unit has been built in which, for the heat transport, use is made of the heat pipe principle. Based on experience with this, design considerations are given regarding the performance of an automobile propulsion unit, for which a new concept of a Stirling engine with a variable swash-plate drive and heating by a rechargeable thermal energy storage unit are used. 770081.

Lund- holm, KB United Stirling (Sweden) AB &amp; Co. 27</page><page sequence="13">770082 - 770087 This is a status report from the development of a 150 kW (200 hp) Stirling prototype engine intended for medium duty automotive application. The basic concept and some of the components were developed on a small 40 kW (55 hp) experimental engine of V4 configuration. In the report emphasis is laid on the presentation of the development of specific Stirling engine components such as heat ex- changers and control system. The present status of performance as well as the final objectives are given. The installation of the engine in a truck and projected truck performance in a typical driving cycle are presented and discussed. 1977 SA E Transactions 770082. Design of the 4-215 D.A. Automotive Stirling Engine. R. van Giessel and F. Reinink, N.V. Philips' Gloeilampenfabrieken (Germany). The Stirling engine holds out prospects of achieving a low pollution, quiet automotive power plant with excellent fuel economy and multi-fuel capability. N.V. Philips, of Holland, has been working with Ford Motor Company since 1972 on a joint program to build, test, and develop a conceptual version of the engine to determine its real potential. This paper describes the approach taken in the design of a four-cylinder double-acting 170-hp Stirling engine with a swash-plate drive, suitable for passenger car installation. Performance and steady-state fuel economy measured on a dynamometer are also presented. 1977 SA E Transactions 770083. The Shuttle Distributor for a Diesel Fuel Injec- tion Pump. J. R. Voss and R. E. Vanderpoel, American Bosch Div., AMBAC Industries, Inc. A simple valve is used in a Diesel fuel injection pump to allow each plunger to distribute fuel to two cylinders. The APS pump, based on this design, is both smaller and less expensive than an equivalent conventional pump because there are half as many pumping elements as engine cylinders. The APS pump has also shown significant performance advantages due to the action of the shuttle valves. A hydraulic governor has been designed and has been incorporated into the APS pump. This paper discusses the design and performance features of the APS pump. 770084. UFIS - A New Diesel Injection System. J. A. Kimberley and R. A. DiDomenico, American Bosch Div., AMBAC Industries, Inc. This Diesel fuel injection system provides the capability of universal application to a wide range of existing engines. It also provides the injection quantities, characteristics, and timing variations which may be needed by the new high performance Diesel engines with emphasis on gaseous emissions and noise. This is an electro-hydraulic system using unit injectors which are electronically controlled and operate on the common rail principle. It features positive displacement fuel metering, hydraulic pressure amplification and nozzle valve control. The system is highly flexible and can achieve injection characteristics beyond the capability of conventional systems. 770085. A New Look at Wear Metal Analysis. Malcolm L. Land, STP Corp., Ward O. Winer, Engi- neering Consultant; and Charles F. Schwarz, Automotive Consultant. The concentration of metals in crankcase oils has been used for many years as an indication of the wear of various engine components. The technique has also been used to study the influence of other contaminants as well. In these respects this technique has been useful in avoiding expensive maintenance or in spotting unusual operating conditions. Industry guidelines have been developed which are considered to be indicative of dangerous concentration levels. These guidelines have in general neglected to consider the influence of oil con- sumption and oil additions on wear metals concentration. This paper treats these questions and shows that they can be quite significant in some circumstances. The paper also shows that wear metals concentrations can be used to establish wear rates. 770086. The Effect of Oil and Coolant Temperatures on Diesel Engine Wear. David A. Bolis, John H. Johnson and Donald A. Daavetilla, Michigan Technological University. A study has been made of piston ring wear and total engine wear using literature data and new experimental results. The main purpose of the study was to establish the effects of oil and coolant temperatures on engine wear. Wear trends that were found in the early 1960's may not be valid any longer because of the development of higher BMEP turbocharged diesel engines, better metallurgical wear surfaces and improved lube oil properties. New data are presented for the purpose of describing present wear trends. A direct-injection, 4-cycle, turbocharged diesel engine was used for the wear tests. The radioactive tracer technique was used to measure the top piston ring chrome face wear. Atomic emission spectroscopy was employed to determine the concentration of wear metals in the oil to determine total engine wear based on iron and lead. The data were analyzed and compared to the results found in the literature from previous investigators. After the results of the analysis are presented, an explanation of the results using some fundamental concepts is made. 770087. Cam and Lifter Wear as Affected by Engine Oil ZDP Concentration and Type. Loren G. Pless and John J. Rodgers, Fuels and Lubricants Dept., Research Labs, General Motors Corp. The recent increase in excessive camshaft and lifter wear after extended service has shown that some SE-quality 28</page><page sequence="14">770089 - 770094 engine oils do not provide adequate protection. To determine the effects of oil additives on wear, controlled tests were run using 1972-1974 model cars, unleaded gasoline, and either SE commercial products or experimental formulations. Field experience with 1970- 1975 model trucks, leaded gasoline, and SE/CC or SE/CD oils was also investigated. With some commercial oils, in both controlled tests and field experience, excessive wear sometimes occurred after extended service, even with recommended oil-change intervals. Generally, protection from excessive wear was best provided by those oils containing predominantly alkyl ZDP (zinc dithiophosphate) antiwear additive instead of aryl ZDP. These results show that a laboratory engine test is needed to evaluate the long-term wear protection of engine oils. 1977 SA E Transactions 770089. Bonding with Anaerobic Adhesives In the Au- tomotive Industry. J. William Paris, Loctite Corporation. The use of anaerobic adhesives and sealants has become widespread in the automotive industry in recent years. A particular form of anaerobic adhesive, the retaining compound, can offer significant improvements over mechanical methods in the mating of cylindrical parts such as the mounting of bearings, gears, pulleys, fans, cams, collars and flywheels. Possible benefits include increased reliability through greater strength, relaxation of machining tolerances, increased production rates, and reduction in rework and warranty costs. 770090. Bond Thickness Effects Upon Stresses in Single Lap Adhesive Joints. I. U. Ojalvo and H. L. Eidinoff, Grumman Aerospace Corp. Results of an analytical investigation on the influence of bond thickness upon the stress distribution in single lap adhesive joints are presented. The present work extends the basic approach for bonded joints, originally intro- duced by Goland and Reissner, through use of a more complete shear-strain/displacement equation for the adhesive layer. This refinement was not found to be included in any of the numerous analytical investigations reviewed. As a result of the approach employed, the present work uncovers several interesting phenomena without adding any significant complication to the analysis. Besides modifying some coefficients in the shear stress equations, completely new terms in the differential equation and boundary conditions for bond peel stress are obtained. In addition, a variation of shear stress through the bond thickness - no matter how thin it may be - is analytically predicted only by the present theory. This through-the-bond-thickness variation of shear stress iden- tifies two antisymmetrical adherend-bond interface points at which the shear stresses are highest. The growth of joint failures originating from these points agrees with results obtained from actual experiments. 1977 SA E Transactions 770092. Pedestrian Injuries and the Car Exterior. S. J. Ashton, J. B. Pedder and G. M. Mackay, Dept. of. Transportation and Environmental Planning, University of Birmingham (England). The relative importance of pedestrian accidents as a source of road accident trauma is shown by reference to national and international data. The methodology of pedestrian accident investigation at Birmingham Univer- sity is presented and the results of a recent study used to describe the general characteristics of pedestrian acci- dents. The pattern of injury sustained by pedestrians struck by the fronts of cars is described and the nature, cause and severity of leg injuries and head injuries considered in detail. The implications of bumper location are discussed. The importance of the windscreen frame as a source of serious head trauma is demonstrated. 1977 SAE Transactions 770093. Injury Severity F actors-T raf f ic Pedestrian Col- lisions. K. J. Tharp, Univ. of Houston; and N. G. Tsongos, NHTSA, U.S. Dept. of Transpor- tation. The injuries of pedestrians involved in collisions with motor vehicles are analyzed in order to detect rela- tionships between injury severity and documented obser- vations. Data on pedestrian injury and involvement were obtained from three sources: Data on 265 involvements collected by Cornell Aeronautical Laboratories in Toronto, Canada during 1969-70; data on 175 involvements collected by the University of Houston, Houston, Texas, during 1971-73; and 47 cases investigated by NHTSA-sponsored multi- disciplinary teams scattered throughout the United States. The data have been reviewed in order to correlate injuries with pedestrian age, area of body contacted, vehicle or environment contact surface, and impact speeds. The objective was to obtain knowledge to evaluate vehicle design and configurations as a possible means of reducing the severity of injuries inflicted upon the pedestrian when contacted by a motor vehicle. Some of the findings are: a) impact speed dominates the variables which were explored to determine the injury mechanisms for pedestrian-motor vehicle collisions, b) there is a strong relationship between injury severity and a body area - contracting surface interactive factor, c) injuries to the head have higher probabilities of having critical severity as compared to the other body areas, d) highway and environmental surfaces contacted as sec- ondary impacts to the pedestrian generate lower injury severities, e) fractured necks were observed as a fatal injury in a large percentage of the fatalities, f) pedestrian age may have a minor influence upon the resulting injury severity. 770094. Optimal Design of Automobiles for Pedestrian Protection. David W. Twigg and James L. Tocher, Boeing Computer Services, Inc.; and 29</page><page sequence="15">770095 -770105 Rolf H. Eppinger, U.S. Dept. of Transportation, Natl. Highway Traffic Safety Admin. A system of computer programs has been developed to simulate the injuries suffered by a pedestrian struck by an automobile. The system provides a semi-automatic search for safer hood/grille/bumper configurations and stiff- nesses. After the software system was developed, three major optimizations, interspersed with modeling changes to improve the accuracy of the simulations, were per- formed. Results from the optimization series were used to help design full-scale impact tests using child and adult dummies. In turn, experimental measurements were used to improve the mathematical model of the impact simulator. The results of these studies have provided some insights into vehicle design parameters which produce safer vehicles. 770095. Experimental Investigation of Pedestrian Injury Minimization Through Vehicle Design. Howard B. Pritz, Battelle's Columbus Laboratories. Experimental pedestrian/vehicle impacts have been con- ducted using a 50th percentile adult and a 6-year-old-child dummy in an ongoing program to investigate the injury reduction potential of changes in the front end of a vehicle. Peak resultant acceleration levels for the head, chest, pelvis, and knee of each dummy are presented for vehicle fronts that include production compact and full size vehicles, a potential injury mitigating concept vehicle and the Calspan RSV. From these results the next vehicle concept to be investigated and evaluated is synthesized and described. 770096. Hy-Power Brake Booster for FMVSS-105 Brake Requirements. J. W. Miller and R. A. Horvath, Delco Moraine Div., General Motors Corp. In anticipation of hydraulic brake system standards for medium duty trucks requiring dual brake systems and stringent stopping distances, Delco Moraine developed an open-center, hydraulically powered brake booster using the power steering pump as the primary source of power. An electric motor-driven pump is used to provide hydraulic power for the reserve booster system. This Hy-Power brake booster is currently used to actuate a 1-3/4" diameter high displacement master cylinder. The total system operation plus operation of the hydraulic booster primary, reserve, and manual modes and respective outputs are described in this report. 770097. Brake System Design for Medium/Heavy Trucks to Meet FMVSS 105-75 Stopping Distance Requirements. M. E. Gatt, The Bendix Corp. A practical method has been devised to size foundation brakes to meet the stopping distance requirements as specified in FMVSS 105-75, Notice 11. Also, a technique has been created to statistically predict the stopping performance of a vehicle as well as the probability of meeting a specified stopping distance criteria. This paper also summarizes the development of Bendix' disc brakes which not only exceed the torque requirements neces- sitated by federal legislation, but also demonstrate improved life and handling characteristics as compared to competitive designs. 1977 SA E Transactions 770098. Evaluation of Vehicle Installed Wheel Lock Control Hardware with a Hybrid Computer Simulation. R. A. Grimm, R. J. Bremer, F. J. Jain and W. A. Levijoki, AC Spark Plug Div., General Motors Corp. A real-time hybrid computer simulation which is inter- faced with an air brake truck is described. The simulation interconnects with the wheel lock electronic controller- modulator hardware and air brake system of a multiple axle truck to provide a laboratory tool for simulating vehicle braking performance. This technique provides controllable vehicle and road characteristics for evalu- ating the actual wheel lock and vehicle pneumatic system hardware. A set of comparative data is given and the merits of the simulation technique are discussed. 770099. P/M Forging Successes. A. J. Ashley, Research and Development Engineering, Burgess-Norton Mfg. Co. P/M Forging, introduced with much fanfare in the early 1970's, has overcome its initial technical problems and is beginning to achieve its early promise of significant economic savings. This paper reviews the technology development and goes on to detail the many well-suited applications which have been developed for automotive parts, farm equipment, hydraulic pumps and motors, outboard motors, chain saws, and industrial hand tools. 770103. Human Factors in Motorcycle Accidents. H. H. Hurt, Jr. and C. J. DuPont, Traffic Safety Center, University of Southern California. Special research is being conducted at the University of Southern California under the sponsorship of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the United States Department of Transportation. The research consists of the on-scene, in-depth multidisciplinary inves- tigation of 900 motorcycle accidents to determine cause factors and identify countermeasures. With the acqui- sition of data from the first 300 accidents, certain critical human elements have been identified as common to a great part of the accidents investigated. The problems of motorcycle conspicuity, rider skill, training and licensing, and protective equipment appear to predominate in accident causation and injury association. 770105. An Electronic Ignition Control System. D. Baert and R. Van De Casteele, Univ. of Ghent (Belgium). The paper gives a description of a simply programmable electronic ignition control system that can be applied to the study of engine behaviour. This apparatus permits an 30</page><page sequence="16">770107-770114 easy chance of the advance or retard characteristics as a function of RPM or vacuum. 770107. Determination of Engine Cold Start Fuel Re- quirements Using A Programmable Electronic Choke. Robert L. Anderson, Ford Motor Co. The programmable choke is a development tool designed to obtain detailed, precise knowledge of choke rich and lean limits during cold start and driveaway tests. It is a servomechanism that replaces the bimetal spring in a conventional choke, and controls and measures choke plate angle to within one percent. Detailed knowledge of choke calibration requirements, over the ambient tem- perature range is used to improve bimetal choke designs. This report describes the programmable choke and presents results of tests conducted on 460 CID vehicles equipped with this system. 770108. A Styling History of Brightwork and Its Effect on Future Marketing. John B. Delphia, Manager Cordoba Charger Exterior Design Studio Chrysler Corporation Design Office. This paper looks at the major events in the history of automotive brightwork, and evaluates how these events have played a prominent role in influencing the styling of our contemporary brightwork. Also reviewed are some of the challenges and problems facing the designer as he creates brightwork for both the short term and distant future. 770110. Corrosion Behavior of Trim Materials on Au- tomobiles. Robert Baboian, Texas Instruments Inc. This paper deals with the corrosion behavior of various exterior automotive trim materials including electroplated steel, stainless steel, stainless clad aluminum and anodized aluminum. The mechanisms of corrosion are discussed, particularly with regard to external appearance and galvanic corrosion of painted auto-body steel adjacent to the trim. Field tests on the various trim materials are described including six year service performance with stainless clad aluminum. Quality control tests for these materials which are currently utilized are listed and described. 770111. What Stainless Steel Offers the Modern Wheel- cover. E. S. Kopecki, Committee of Stainless Steel Producers, American Iron and Steel Insti- tute. Type 301 stainless steel is an austenitic, chromium-nickel stainless steel with exceptional strength and fabrication characteristics. This paper describes these characteristics and their role in the design and manufacture of auto- motive wheel trim. Data are provided on deep drawing and press forming of Type 301, and comparisons are made to aluminum alloy 5252-H25. 770112. A Five-Cylinder Engine as an Economical, Smooth-Running Power Plant. Franz Hauk and Werner Dommes, AUDI NSU Auto Union AG, Ingolstadt. For the first time in the history of automobile engineering AUDI NSU have introduced a 5-cylinder in-line gasoline engine for production cars designed to run at speeds up to about 7,000 rpm. This unusual new design makes it possible to set new standards of performance and smoothness, while still retaining the advantages of front wheel drive. 1977 SA E Transactions 770113. Advanced Automotive Power Systems, Part 2Ä. A Diesel for a Subcompact Car. P. Hofbauer and K. Sator, Volks wagenwerk AG. System analysis studies have shown that Diesel engines can be an alternative to spark ignition engines even in subcompact cars. According to some optimistic estimates, the share of Diesel engines in the total market may reach 25%, so that Diesel engines might well supplement the existing range of spark ignition engines. During the period from 1970 to 1990, the significance of all individual objectives whose demands are not favorable to the Diesel will decrease, whereas the significance of objectives favoring the Diesel will increase. It was the objective of the VW Passenger Car Diesel Engine Project to alleviate considerably all the ill-famed Diesel disadvantages, such as noise, smell, smoke, and slow acceleration, the latter being due to the low horsepower-to-weight ratio. On the other hand, we intended to preserve for subcompact car use the classical Diesel advantages, such as excellent fuel economy, long service life, low incidence of malfunctions, and favorable emissions. We aimed especially for compliance with US emission regulations in addition to meeting requirements world- wide. Compared to a spark ignition engine of the same power output, we intended to improve the fuel economy of the Diesel by 30 to 50%, and its service life by more than 50%. Another objective was to keep Diesel production cost low by using the largest possible number of spark ignition engine parts for Diesel production. Of all Diesel operating principles, the swirl chamber design was found to comply best with the manifold requirements connected with a subcompact car. By virtue of extensive development work on the spark ignition engine parts, we ensured that both Otto and Diesel engines can be manufactured on the same transfer line. 1977 SAE Transactions 770114. A Variable-Displacement Spark-Ignition Engine. H. N. Pouliot, W. R. Delameter and C. W. Robinson, Sandia Labs. A five-cylinder variable displacement research engine has been designed, built, and tested for over one year. Displacement is varied by changing the piston stroke 31</page><page sequence="17">770115 -770122 using a four-bar linkage. By proper choice of the linkage dimensions, compression ratio can be held constant as the stroke changes, or it can be tailored to optimize economy and performance. Before the engine was built, its dynamics were thoroughly analyzed, and a five-cylinder configuration was selected to minimize vibration. Test data show that BSFC is, as expected, less dependent on load than in conventional engines, and averages less than 0.5 lb/bhp-hr over the load and speed range of ordinary automobile operation. Several methods for estimating urban fuel economy from dynamometer data predict a significant improvement compared with conventional engines. Emission controls have not yet been applied to this engine. 1977 SAE Transactions 770115. Incidents Caused by Vehicle Defects - Analysis of Their Characteristics. Michael R. Appleby, Louis J. Bintz and Paul E. Keen, Jr., Automobile Club of Southern California. Data from in-depth investigations of 1,087 incidents caused by vehicle defects reported to an automobile insurer were examined, compiled into various categories and analyzed. Significant results were that 530 (49%) of the incidents involved vehicle fuel system failures which caused fires. Brake system failures accounted for 301 of the remaining 557 incidents. Conclusions and recommendations are made supportive of countermeasures such as recall campaigns, upgrading of vehicle service facilities and vehicle owner education. The cost effectiveness of man- datory periodic motor vehicle inspection systems is questioned, further research, generally on vehicle safety defects and specifically on the causes of vehicle engine fires, is recommended. 770116. Inspection, Defect Detection, and Accident Cau- sation in Commercial Vehicles. Thomas L. McDole, Highway Safety Research Institute. A recently completed HSRI study, "Effects of Commer- cial Vehicle Systematic Preventive Maintenance on Specific Causes of Accidents", concluded that an iden- tifiable relationship exists between good commercial vehicle inspection and maintenance practices and a reduction in defect-related accidents. The better main- tenance practices were usually associated with larger firms, and poorer maintenance practices more often were associated with smaller firms or individual owner oper- ators. Also documented was the need for improved or modified inspection and maintenance requirements as stated in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. 770117. Vehicular Problems as Accident Causes - an Overview of Available Information. John R. Treat and Rickey L. Stansifer, Inst, for Research in Public Safety, Indiana University. This paper provides final results of an accident inves- tigation project conducted by the Indiana University Institute for Research in Public Safety (IRPS), for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, em- phasizing particularly the role of vehicular factors in causing accidents. In addition, these results are put in context with other recent studies which have provided information on the same topic. Data collection for the Indiana University accident causation study was confined to Monroe County, Indiana, where between 1970 and 1975, 2,258 accidents were investigated by teams of technicians using a consistent set of procedures and terminology. Concurrently, 420 in- depth investigations were conducted by a multidisci- plinary team. Vehicular degradations, maladjustments, and failures were identified as definite causes in 4.5% of these accidents by the multidisciplinary team, and in 4.1% by the technicians. Vehicular problems were considered either definite or probable causes in 12.6% of these accidents by the in-depth team, and in 9.1% by the technicians. Problems with brakes and tires predominated as vehicular causes, with gross brake system failure and inadequate tread depth being two of the leading problems identified. The other studies referenced, while varying somewhat in the proportion of accidents in which vehicular factors were implicated, also reflect brakes and tires as predom- inant problem areas. 770120. The Influence of Combustion with Pressure Exchange on the Performance of Heat Balanced Internal Combustion Engines. A. A. Pouring, R. F. Blaser, E. L. Keating and B. H. Rankin, U.S. Naval Academy. The heat balanced or combined cycle engine with time dependent combustion sustained by two chamber geom- etry is demonstrated experimentally. Evidence of time dependent heat addition is given where combustion creates a field of pressure waves sustained by pressure exchange between two chambers. The basic cycle and operating characteristics are reviewed and experimental results with CFR and glass- walled engines demonstrate the engine characteristic as compared to OTTO engines. Improvements in thermal efficiency over the OTTO engine in excess of 45% are demonstrated in some operating regimes. Considerable reduction in peak pressure and exhaust emission are also demonstrated. 770122. Transient Response of Turbocharged Diesel Engines. D. E. Winterbone, R. S. Benson, A. G. Mortimer and P. Kenyon, The University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (United Kingdom); and A. Stotter, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology (Israel). The problem of highly rated turbocharged diesel engines operating under transient load conditions is now well known, and is due to the inability of the turbocharger to supply sufficient air for good combustion. 32</page><page sequence="18">770123 -770134 In Part 1, two methods are discussed for reducing turbocharger lag-air injection onto the compressor rotor and oil injection onto a small pelton wheel mounted on the turbocharger shaft. Results are given showing the benefit of fitting these devices to an engine on a test bed. Engine response is improved in all respects particularly smoke and overall response time. In Part 2, a simulation study of a turbocharged diesel engine installed in a 32 tonne truck is presented to investigate the engine performance during load and speed changes. It is shown that by injecting compressed air on to the turbocharger compressor rotor tip, smoke emissions from the engine during load changes are reduced. The size of air compressor and receiver required for air injection is the same order as for a conventional truck air braking system. Some preliminary engine tests on a computer- controlled test bed confirm the simulation modelling and results. 1977 SAE Transactions 770123. A Non-Linear Digital Simulation of Turbo- charged Diesel Engines Under Transient Con- ditions. Neil Watson, Lecturer, Imperial College of Science and Technology; and Maged Mar- zouk, Research Assistant, Imperial College of Science and Technology. A non-linear mathematical model has been developed to predict the transient response of a turbocharged diesel engine. The quasi-steady "filling and emptying" concept has been employed in the analysis of the thermo and fluid dynamics under transient engine conditions. In addition, by continuously evaluating the dynamic interactions of engine components, major limitations of previous linear and quasi-linear models have been overcome. A computer controlled test-bed and high speed data logging system has been used to acquire detailed data under transient conditions (e.g. injection and cylinder pressure diagrams). This data has been used to validate the model, the result being good agreement between predicted and measured engine performance. Application of the model has proved its value in the study and optimization of design variables which affect engine performance and response time. As examples, the effects of using a fuel pump rack limiter and that of rematching the turbocharger in conjunction with an exhaust waste gate are presented. 1977 SAE Transactions 770124. A Wholly Dynamic Model of a Turbocharged Diesel Engine for Transfer Function Evaluation. D. E. Winterbone, C. Thiruarooran and P. E. Wellstead, Univ. of Manchester Inst, of Science and Technology (United Kingdom). This paper reviews the previous methods of modelling the transient response of turbocharged diesel engines and highlights their dependence on empirical data. It develops a mathematical model of such engines based on the "filling-and-emptying" technique, and describes how empirical feedback can be used to improve the model. The good correspondence between calculated and experi- mental results is shown. The mathematical model is then used to evaluate the linearized transfer function of the diesel engine for later use in control studies. 770129. Driver's Inability to Judge Important Parameters of Leading Vehicle Movement at Night. Wiel H. Janssen, Institute for Perception TNO (The Netherlands). During car following in darkness the manoeuvres of the leading car must be inferred primarily from changes in the angle subdued by its taillights. The paper discusses empirical evidence on the ability of drivers to make estimates of the magnitude of relative movement of the leading car from the behavior of its taillights. The general conclusion emerging from the data is that drivers suffer from a perceptual inability in making this type of judgment which easily may result in rear-end collisions in many typical night driving situations. Drivers of following vehicles may often be led by their estimations to close up on the leading vehicle much faster than they intended to. Counter measures to reduce the relatively high accident risk of night driving obviously have to start from this type of weakness in human perceptual ability. 1977 SAE Transactions 770130. Performance of Driver-Vehicle System in Emer- gency Avoidance. Teruo Maeda, Namio Irie, Kunihiko Hidaka and Hiroaki Nishimura, Nis- san Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan). By means of a new test method for simulating automotive accidents on ordinary roads, we found that while both experienced and inexperienced drivers have the same initial steer input to avoid an unexpected obstacle, experienced drivers display more stable performance in the subsequent control of the vehicle. Further, utilizing driver's transfer functions we studied a mathematical simulation of test results and obtained parameters for both experienced and inexperienced drivers. These indicate that when vehicle yaw response is greatly delayed, inexperienced drivers may lose control, while experienced drivers will secure control of the vehicle. 1977 SAE Transactions 770134. Fatigue and Stress Due to Prolonged Driving and Changing Task Demands. Johan B. J. Riemersma and Paul W. Biesta, Institute for Perception TNO (The Netherlands); and Cees Wildervanck, Traffic Research Centre, State University at Groningen (The Netherlands). Two experiments are reported; experiment I on per- formance decrement during prolonged night driving and experiment II on driver stress during driving in different environments. 33</page><page sequence="19">770135 -770139 In experiment I, Subjects in one condition carried out a continuous driving task during the night which was preceded and followed by a short drive, while in another condition subjects only carried out the pre- and post tests and slept in-between. The results showed considerable decrement in driving performance (a.o. increase in lane drifting) and performance on two subsidiary tasks, while heart rate, although decreasing during the drive, could not be directly related to fatigue, but was also influenced by adaptational effects. In experiment II, Subjects drove three different short test routes during daytime: in town, on a four-lane motorway, and on a two-lane rural road. Measurements were taken of driving quality (a.o. lane positioning and steering wheel angle), heart rate and reaction time on an auditory subsidiary task. Besides, being sensitive enough to differentiate between different levels of environmental complexity, heart rate variability measures seemed very promising in facilitating the interpretation of driver behavior measures. Also, there existed some remarkable differences in lateral and longitudinal control between motorway and rural road. 1977 SA E Transactions 770135. Driver Demographics - Exercising the Personnel Subsystem. William T. Roe, Manned Systems Sciences, Inc. (United Kingdom). Human Factors knowledge and methodology applied to transportation and highway safety is presented in the context of a General Personnel Subsystem (PSS) para- digm. Application of engineering/industrial psychology, physiology/anatomy, and system science are discussed in relation to this general model. 770136. A Treatise on Exhaust Emission Test Variability. Wiplove K. Juneja, David D. Horchler and Harold M. Haskew, Vehicle Emission Labora- tories Engineering Staff - Current Product En- gineering General Motors Corporation. The major sources of variability of an exhaust emission test on the 1975 Federal Test Procedure (FTP) are discussed. Vehicle, driver and the ambient conditions affect hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) variability significantly. On the other hand, oxides of nitrogen (NOJ and carbon dioxide (C02) are influenced more by the differences in vehicle loading. However, the importance of any other source of variability cannot be ignored, especially when a comparison is made between two tests. Various diagnostic aids such as the "Total Torque Tester", a "Driver Evaluator", an "Exhaust Bag Cross-Check", and a "Repeatable Car", which are used for the purpose of a better correlation between meas- urement systems on different test sites, are described. Designed experiments were conducted on vehicles whose emission levels were at or near the standards of 0.41 grams per mile HC, 3.4 grams per mile CO and 2.0 grams per mile NOx. A computer simulation of emissions was also employed to determine relative contributions from different sources to overall variability. Variability due to measurement error and within - vehicle variability observed in this work is Â±19% of the mean for HC, Â± 33% of the mean for CO, Â± 9% of the mean for NOx and Â± 5% for the mean for C02. Variability as used here is defined as 1.96 times the coefficient of variation. The magnitude of variability is variable depending on differences in the overall system which includes the vehicle, the measure- ment system and test operating conditions. 1977 SA E Transactions 770137. Comparison and Optimization of Exhaust Emis- sion Test Procedures. H. Klingenberg, M. Kuhler, K.-H. Lies, L. Pazsitka and D. Schiir- mann, Research and Development, Volkswagen- werk AG. Distribution functions of repetitive exhaust measurement results on the same vehicles and of single measurement results on many vehicles from the assembly line are investigated. The correlation between mass emission components is also analyzed. The probabilities for passing or failing certification tests are calculated using a Monte Carlo-method under consideration of the standard deviations of test data. From the results of these statistical and experimental investigations, proposals for the improvement of certi- fication- and assembly line test procedures for the USA and Europe are deduced. 770138. A Quality Control Technique for Correlating Exhaust Gas Analysis Systems. C. Don Paulsell and John Keller, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. A simple, inexpensive, critical flow blender has been developed for filling a tediar bag with controllable concentrations of HC, NOx, C02, and CO gases at levels encountered in automobile emissions testing. According to a daily schedule, a technician takes the bag to all analyzer sites in the laboratory for analysis. The concen- trations indicated by each site are compared to the overall averages. The results are stored in a computerized data base from which control charts, statistical analyses, and interpretations of significant differences among test sites can be made. The precision, accuracy, and statistical interpretations of the data are discussed. 770139. Torque Measurements and Mechanized Driver for Correlating Exhaust Emission Test Facilities. H. Klingenberg, D. Kinne and D. SchÃ¼rmann, Research and Development, Volks wagen werk AG Wolfsburg (Germany). Our investigations have shown that the current calibration procedures for dynamometers do not suffice to obtain a good conformity between different dynamometers. As a criterion for dynamometer calibration, we use in 34</page><page sequence="20">770140-770146 two different ways the torque which is measured on the drive shaft of a test car. The static method yields the complete dynamometer characteristic: torque versus car speed. The dynamic method uses the averaged time integral of the torque measured over a driving cycle. Both methods supplement each other. In order to achieve a good reproducibility, a mech- anized driver has been developed. Test results are discussed. 770140. New Laser Particle Sizing Instrument. Frederick R. Faxvog, Physics Dept., General Motors Research Lab. A new laser particle sizing instrument has been con- structed for on-line particle sizing of combustion exhausts. The instrument measures the optical extinction associated with single particles as they flow through focused laser beams. Two focused beams which cross at their minimum diameter along with coincident pulse detection electronics are used to size only those particles which traverse simultaneously both focused beams. Donut mode inten- sity beams together with double pulse detection circuitry are used to ensure the particles which are measured have traversed the peak laser intensity. Opaque particles in the size range 0.05 jum to 5.0 /im diameter can be sized with a diameter resolution of better than 10%. The present instrument can size ~1000 particles in 3 minutes at its maximum allowable particle concentration of 105 parti- cles/cm3. Both particle size distribution and particle emission rate from a diesel automobile exhaust were measured over an FTP cycle. 1977 SA E Transactions 770141. Optimization of a Flame Ionization Detector for Determination of Hydrocarbon in Diluted Au- tomotive Exhausts. Glenn D. Reschke, Vehicle Emission Laboratory, General Motors Proving Ground. The effects of burner flow parameters, fuel type, and fuel composition on the uniformity of relative response of a Flame Ionization Detector (FID) hydrocarbon analyzer were experimentally investigated. Means have been found to improve correlation between analyzers and to optimize relative response characteristics. Although this investi- gation was directed at analyzers being used for analysis of dilute Â¿xhaust sample bags from the Federal Vehicle Emission Test, the results can be applied to a FID in other applications. 1977 SA E Transactions 770143. Analyzers for Methane in Exhaust Gas. Arnold Prostak and Glenn D. Reschke, Milford Vehicle Emission Laboratory, General Motors Corp. A gas chromatographic instrument has been developed to measure methane in diluted automotive exhaust. Meas- urements can be made on a 60-second cycle with a standard deviation of 0.06 ppm methane and with no known interferences. In addition, a prototype selective combustor for continuous methane determination in exhaust has been evaluated and found to be satisfactory. 770144. Automotive Hydrocarbon Emission Patterns in the Measurement of Nonmethane Hydrocarbon Emission Rates. Frank Black and Larry High, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The advent of emission control technology has resulted in significant changes in both the total mass and detailed patterns of hydrocarbons emitted from automobiles. Emission rates of 56 hydrocarbons from 22 motor vehicles, including catalyst and noncatalyst configura- tions, were determined for the Federal Urban Driving Cycle. An increased relative abundance of methane is indicated for vehicles equipped with oxidation catalysts. In view of the photochemically non-reactive nature of methane, simple and economic procedures for determi- nation of vehicle nonmethane hydrocarbon emission rates are evaluated. In general the procedures evaluated require independent total hydrocarbon and methane analysis, with the nonmethane hydrocarbon level calculated by difference. The procedures are evaluated by comparison of indicated nonmethane hydrocarbon emission rates with rates obtained by summation of individual compound rates determined by advanced gas chromatographic procedures. 1977 SA E Transactions 770145. The Use of Gas Engines for Motor Vehicles in Oil Exporting Countries. M. Rashidi and M. S. Massoudi, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Arya- Mehr Univ. of Technology. Natural gas is a valuable commodity produced as a by-product of oil drilling in many parts of the world. Using this commodity essentially requires that problems associated with its low specific gravity be overcome. One possible application is for vehicular propulsion in local- ities close to the gas deposit. This paper reviews the major advantages and disadvantages of this course of action. 770146. Octane Number Requirement Survey 1959 - 1975 Japanese Model Passenger Cars. Kiyoshi Naka- jima, Nippon Oil Co., Ltd. The results of annual surveys for octane number re- quirements of Japanese model passenger cars during 1959-1975 showed that the octane number required to satisfy 50% and 90% in 1972 model cars increased to 91.8 and 98.5 ON, but after that octane number requirements steadily decreased, then 1975 model cars required 89.4 and 93.5 ON at 50% and 90% car satisfaction level. About 90% of the cars tested obtained maximum octane number requirement at wide open throttle. High speed octane number requirements (80~120km/hr) of 1975 model cars at 50% and 90% car satisfied were 85.9 and 90.2 ON. 35</page><page sequence="21">770147 - 770154 770147. Engine Failure and High Speed Knock. G. M. Cornetti, F. De Cristofaro and R. Gozzelino, FIAT Research Center (Italy). High speed knock is one of the major obstacles to higher compression ratios and, consequently, lower fuel con- sumption. The relationship between engine failure and knock intensity was studied by testing a European engine at 4,000 and 5,000 rpm, on full throttle. Endurance test results show that the knock intensity which causes damage decreases as speed or combustion chamber temperature is increased. Other information obtained through analysis of the type of engine failure has suggested a way to increase compression ratio without changing octane requirement. 770148. The Effectiveness of Belt Systems in Frontal and Rollover Crashes. Donald F. Huelke, The Univ. of Michigan Medical School; and Thomas E. Lawson, Robert Scott and Joseph C. Marsh IV, The Univ. of Michigan, Highway Safety Re- search Inst. This paper presents an analysis of front seat outboard occupants in frontal and rollover crashes. These occu- pants were lap belted, lap-shoulder belted or were unrestrained. In the frontal crash the lap-shoulder belt reduces the occurrence of the severe, serious, critical- to-life injuries, and fatalities in all regions of the body (head, neck, thorax, lower torso and extremities). In addition, there is a strong association between belt usage and the occupant escaping from the crash with no injury. In rollover crashes, belts reduce the frequency of the more severe injuries by preventing the occupant from being ejected. For those occupants not ejected from the car, belts effectively reduce fatalities and the more serious injuries. 1977 SA E Transactions 770149. Severe to Fatal Injuries to Lap-Shoulder Belted Car Occupants. D. F. Huelke, H. W. Sherman and M. J. Murphy, University of Michigan. Lap-shoulder belt effectiveness has been indicated by many authors, however there is minimal information on the more severe injuries to lap-shoulder belted car occupants. This paper presents details of 15 lap-shoulder belted occupants in frontal collisions and 24 lap-shoulder belted occupants in side impact collisions. Case descrip- tions of these crashes are presented, each including vehicle, environmental and injury details. 770151. Case Descriptions of Lap-Shoulder Belted Oc- cupants in Car Crashes. Michael J. Murphy, Donald F. Huelke and Harold W. Sherman, Highway Safety Research Institute and Dept. of Anatomy, Univ. of Michigan Medical School. From field crash investigations conducted by the authors, a series of well documented crashes will be presented. In each, at least one occupant was wearing a lap-shoulder belt. Detailed injury reports will be presented along with photographs of car damage, occupant contact areas, and where possible, the estimated impact speeds. 770152. Safety Beit use Laws in Europe - A Positive Initiative for Saving Lives. H. George Johan- nessen, Hamill Manufacturing Co.; and Charles H. Pulley, American Safety Belt Council. This paper provides a preliminary report on the imple- mentation and effectiveness of mandatory seat belt use laws in seven representative European countries. Since the implementation on January 1, 1971 of the first mandatory seat belt use law by the State of Victoria, Australia, many additional jurisdictions have adopted similar laws. As of January 1, 1977, twenty-one juris- dictions had mandatory seat belt use laws in effect. The experience of the seven European countries demonstrates that mandatory seat belt use laws are effective in increasing seat belt usage when the laws are adequately enforced and are preceded by a comprehensive public education program. 770153. The Canadian Approach to the Seat Belt Prob- lem. Ruth M. Heron, Dept. of Psychology, Queen's University (Canada). Five projects converging on the Canadian seat belt problem are discussed. It is pointed out that preliminary surveys provided background on Canadians' attitudes towards seat belts and knowledge of their safety prop- erties. On this basis educational TV, ratio, and newspaper materials were exposed on a nationwide basis in a dual wave campaign. The project package is described as including also statistical estimates of seat belt effective- ness for various levels of use, and a legislation survey, results of which indicated that most Canadians favour mandatory seat belt use. 770154. Civil Aircraft Restraint Systems: State-of-the-Art Evaluation of Standards, Experimental Data, and Accident Experience. Richard G. Snyder, High- way Safety Research Institute, The University of Michigan. The importance of crashworthiness and the role of restraint systems in occupant impact protection in U.S. Civil Aircraft design is being increasingly recognized. Current estimates of the number of fatalities which could be prevented annually in survivable accidents range from 33 to 94%. This study reviews the development of existing Federal Aviation Administration restraint system stan- dards from the first requirement for safety belts in the Air Commerce Regulations of 1926 to present 14 CFR 1.1. The FAA and industry standards are critically evaluated for Parts 23 (small airplanes), 25 (air transports), 27 (rotorcraft), and 29 (transport category rotorcraft). State- of-the-art developments, including an overview of pre- vious accident experience, results of experimental studies, comparison with other standards, and primary data sources are provided. It is concluded that both FAA 36</page><page sequence="22">770155 -770161 standards and manufacturers restraint protection in most U.S. civil aircraft are far below that presently provided by other federal standards or available in state-of-the-art technology. 1977 SA E Transactions 770155. Air Bag Update - Recent Crash Case Histories. George R. Smith, Environmental Activities Staff General Motors Corporation. About 1 1,000 air cushion-equipped cars have been put on the road by General Motors, including fleet Chevrolets in the field trial program and privately owned 1974-76 Oldsmobiles, Buicks, and Cadillacs. Although these vehicles have accumulated over 400 million car miles, the total is very small when compared with the mileage being driven by the entire vehicle population. Therefore, statistically valid conclusions cannot yet be drawn about the safety benefits of the system. Nevertheless, sampling of accidents illustrates the protection provided by the air cushion in a variety of situations. 770156. An Assessment of the Relationship Between Frontal Impact Severity and Injury Level. Joseph C. Marsh, IV, Kenneth L. Campbell and Bar- bara C. Kingman, Highway Safety Res. Inst., Univ. of Michigan. The relationship between crash severity and injury level is illustrated using the Restraint System Evaluation Study (RSES) data and Texas police-reported data. The RSES data are used to demonstrate that the probability of an injury (or fatality) is a function of both (a) the risk of injury, given a set of crash factors, and (b) crash exposure, or the chance of those factors occurring. The Texas data are used to demonstrate that crash exposure can change with time. Changes in crash exposure can alter the distribution of injuries (or fatalities) independently of motor vehicle standards or design. Texas and CPIR data are used to demonstrate that the risk of fatality is associated with many crash factors other than the traditional speed-related measures. 770157.

A recently introduced 3 Digit Monolithic A/D Converter makes highly reliable automotive data acquisition and control systems easy to design and fabricate. The device includes many significant performance features, requires a minimum of external components and provides the outstanding stability and reliability needed for automotive control and instrumentation systems. This I.C., the LD130 offers an extremely accurate (0.1%) conversion from an analog input to a Binary-Coded-Decimal (BCD) output, an easily handled output format for interfacing both displays and microprocessors. 770158. Automotive Applications of Monolithic Voltage- To-Frequency Converters. Tom Cate, Semicon- ductor Div., Raytheon Co. The need for low-cost VFC and FVC circuits will increase as automotive electronic systems become more complex and the use of microprocessors increases. Today, mono- lithic integrated circuits are available that can be used to implement VFC and FVC functions at minimum cost and with excellent performance. 770159. Analog to Digital Converters in Microprocessor Based Automotive Control Systems. Larry Ken- dall, Semiconductor Div., Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corp. The availability of low cost microprocessors is a major step towards practical Automotive Control Systems. Such systems also require sensing of physical parameters and transferring sensed values into and out of the processors. In some cases "Digital" sensors are practical and should be used. Other cases require analog sensors and Analog to Digital Conversion. Traditional methods of Analog to Digital Conversion, developed mostly for military and scientific applications, do not meet the needs of the Automotive Industry. These needs, including cost objectives, speed and accuracy goals and desirable features are outlined. Two circuits and approaches are recommended for Automotive Applica- tions. The 4151/7151 is shown for single input relatively slow applications and the /Â¿A0850, a new monolithic IC, is described for complex multi-input control systems. It is concluded that analog sensors and Analog to Digital conversion can be economically applied when designed as an integral part of a microprocessor based system. 770160. The VMOS Power Device - A Direct Interface Between Microprocessors and Electromechanical Actuators. Richard A. Blanchard, Supertex, Inc. The development of microprocessor automotive control systems emphasizes the need for a direct interface between microprocessors and displays or electromechanical actu- ators. Kertical Metal Oxide Semiconductor or VMOS devices offer a combination of high input impedence, large output current, rapid switching of large currents, and immunity to current hogging and second breakdown problems. The electrical characteristics of VMOS devices makes them attractive candidates for interfacing with microprocessors as well as other automotive applications. However, the successful incorporation of VMOS devices in automotive systems requires a thorough understanding of their electrical operating characteristics under varying conditions. This paper investigates the characteristics of VMOS power transistors, compares them with bipolar transistors, and discusses the use of VMOS transistors in automotive applications. 1977 SA E Transactions 770161. Second Generation Building Block Circuits - A 37</page><page sequence="23">770162-770166 Unique New Frequency to Voltage Converter. Robert W. Miller, National Semiconductor. A new level of electronic building blocks for automotive system design is evolving. These circuits will perform specific functions with high accuracy, low cost, and a minimum of external components. This paper describes a unique frequency to voltage converter designed for the specific interface problems found in automotive systems. The concept of a building block device requires that a function be performed in the same way as it can be mathematically defined. This device is free of the typical compromises associated with adapting conventional F-V converters to automotive requirements. It interfaces directly with magnetic pickups and its output is directly proportional to frequency even as the frequency goes to zero. Two specific application areas are explored. The need for an electronic speedometer/tachometer for better reliability and easier instrument panel design calls for a ripple-free low frequency F-V or F-I converter. At the front of most adaptive braking systems is a wheel speed to voltage conversion. This device can go one step further and provide some of the logic required in multiple input anti-skid systems. 770162. Progress in HSLA Steels in Automotive Appli- cations. R. P. Krupitzer, R. E. Miner, P. J. Vander Arend, F. Reis, J. A. Slane, J. K. Abraham and S. J. Matas, Research Center Republic Steel Corp. Technical developments in hot rolled, cold rolled, and heat treated HSLA steels are reviewed. A wide range of material properties have been produced through a variety of strengthening mechanisms and processing innovations. The results of laboratory and mill experiments are used to describe improvements in microalloyed and renitro- genized hot and cold rolled steels, heavily temper rolled steels, and heat treated strip products. 1977 SA E Transactions 770163. Partially Annealed High Strength Cold Rolled Steels. P. B. Lake and J. J. Grenawalt, Youngs- town Sheet and Tube Company. The techniques of producing and utilizing recovery- annealed cold-rolled sheet products are described with emphasis on the ability to obtain: i) yield strength minimums ranging from 60 to 160 ksi (413 to 1102 MPa), ii) uniformity of metallurgical properties; and iii) useful and formable steels for economical weight saving appli- cation in the automotive industry. 1977 SA E Transactions 770164. High Strength Formable Sheet Steel. J. H. BÃ¼cher and E. G. Hamburg, Jones and Laughlin Steel Corp. High strength low alloy steels with minimum yield strength values in the 50-80 Ksi range are experiencing increased usage in automotive applications for reasons of improved safety and weight reduction. These steels are usually supplied in the hot rolled condition although markets are developing for thinner, cold rolled steels. The increased strength in these materials is usually obtained by grain refinement and precipitation by means of micro-alloying with Cb, V or Ti and by controlled mill processing. The most desirable combination of properties is the development of high strength in the formed part and optimum formability compatible with this capacity for strengthening in the as-shipped steel. This paper deals with the developments at Jones and Laughlin leading to a product, VAN-QN, which has a superior combination of formability and strength in the formed part. Previous descriptions of this type of product have been made by Japanese researchers and M. Rashid of GMC. This product is obtained by careful heat treatment of cold rolled or hot rolled steel such that a microstructure consisting of fine ferrite grains with a controlled dispersion of martensitic or lower bainitic areas is obtained. This product is characterized by general yielding at a relatively low level (50-60 Ksi) with a rapid rate of work hardening combined with a large capacity for deformation that results in a high tensile strength (80-100 Ksi) and a high degree of strengthening in the formed part. Property-structure relationships are presented for the engineering properties of most interest. Considerable description is made of the formability characteristics of this steel and how formability can be optimized. 1977 SA E Transactions 770165. Strain Aging Properties Of High-Strength Hot- Rolled Steels. R. L. Pastorek and A. B. Sipler, Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company. The need of the automotive industry for low cost, high-strength steel has prompted consideration of the strain aging process as a means of achieving this goal. To determine the steel best suited for these strained and aged applications, both the static and dynamic strain aging characteristics for carbon steel and various hot-rolled, high-strength steels representing yield strengths from 40 ksi (276 MPa) to 107 ksi (738 MPa) were determined. The medium-strength (40/50 ksi - 276/345 MPa) renitro- genized steels with high soluble nitrogen levels were found to offer an excellent combination of good ductility, large strain aging response and high strength levels in the finished automotive part at low cost. For difficult forming operations, the dynamic strain aging process utilizing the titanium-strengthened 80 ksi (552 MPa) steel offers a useful technique, providing improved ductility at elevated forming temperatures while retaining high strength levels in the finished part. 1977 SA E Transactions 770166. Automotive Sulfate Emissions - A Baseline Study. Joseph H. Somers, Robert J. Garbe, Richard D. Lawrence and Thomas M. Baines, Environmental Protection Agency. 38</page><page sequence="24">770167-770171 A baseline testing program was designed and imple- mented by EPA wherein 78 vehicles were tested in 5 laboratories. The objectives of this study were to 1) obtain sulfate emission factors on a wide variety of different in-use vehicles using current and advanced emission control methods, and 2) determine the effect on sulfate emissions of vehicles meeting increasingly stringent gaseous emissions standards. The program was designed such that the vehicles were divided into the following classes: 1) production non-catalyst vehicles, 2) production catalyst vehicles - grouped according to emissions stan- dards, 3) advanced non-catalyst vehicles, 4) advanced catalyst vehicles, and 5) fleet vehicles. 770167. Effects of Engine Parameters and Catalyst Com- position on Vehicle Sulfate Emissions. D. E. McKee, Research Staff, Ford Motor Co. Sulfate emissions from two oxidation catalyst equipped, 400 CID vehicles were measured using a dilution tube. The effects of spark timing, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), oxygen concentration, and catalyst composition were studied. The vehicles were identical Ford LTD's; one was calibrated for 1976 Federal emission standards, the other for the stricter 1976 California standards. At a steady-speed 72 km/hr (45 mph), the conversion of S02 to S03 over Engelhard IIB catalysts as a function of oxygen concentration is similar to that observed in laboratory studies; a dramatic reduction in sulfate emissions occurs at less than 1% 02. On the EPA Congested Freeway Driving Schedule (CFDS), formerly the Sulfate Emission Test #7 (SET-7), the sulfate emission level is considerably lower than on the 72 kph cruise, and no sharp reduction at low average oxygen concentrations is seen. Sulfate storage in the catalyst washcoat, and subsequent release, is cited to explain these observations. Changing the spark timing from 6 to 16Â° BTDC and disabling the EGR had no effect on sulfate emissions over the CFDS. Three different noble-metal catalyst formulations were studied: platinum/palladium, platinum/rhodium, and pure palladium, all prepared by Engelhard Industries on Corning substrates. Under steady-speed operation of the Federal vehicle at 72 kph, the emission rates from the catalysts in the order listed above were 47, 17, and 6 mg/km. The corresponding S02 to S03 conversions compare well with laboratory experiments. However, quite different results were obtained from the CFDS: for all the catalysts, the emission rates were 4-7 mg/km on the Federal vehicle and 16-28 mg/km on the California vehicle. The mitigation of the differences between cata- lysts indicates that under realistic driving conditions, the noble-metal catalyst composition may be unimportant in determining sulfate emissions. Moreover, misleading conclusions may be derived from laboratory studies which do not incorporate cyclic operation. It is also of note that the higher emission levels from the California car imply that efforts to meet stricter gaseous emission standards may lead to higher sulfate emissions. 770168. Emission Patterns of Diesel-Powered Passenger Cars - Part II. James N. Braddock and Peter A. Gabele, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. An experimental program was conducted to characterize the gaseous and particulate emissions from a 1975 Peugeot 504D light duty diesel-powered vehicle. The vehicle was tested over the 1975 Federal Test Procedure, Highway Fuel Economy Test, and Sulfate Emissions Test driving cycles using four different fuels covering a fair range of composition, density, and sulfur content. In addition to fuel economy and regulated gaseous emission measure- ments of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen, emission measurements were also obtained for non-regulated pollutants including sulfur dioxide, sulfates, aldehydes, benzo[a]pyrene, carbonyl sulfide, hydrogen cyanide, nonreactive hydrocarbons, and particulate mat- ter. The results are discussed in terms of emission trends due to either fuel type or driving cycle influence. 770169. Exhaust Emission Levels of In-Use 1975 &amp; 1976 California Automobiles. M. R. Appleby, L. J. Bintz and T. A. Tappenden, Automobile Club of Southern California. Exhaust emission data for 1975 and 1976 California automobiles were generated, using the Federal Test Procedure, at the time of their delivery and after the vehicle engines had matured. The emission test results indicate the degree of emissions control achieved compared to pre- 1966 uncon- troUed automobiles. Also differences between green and mature engines and the statistical differences in the test data are described. Conclusions discuss statistical trends of the results and how the data relates to current and possible future vehicle emissions, ambient air quality reductions and other related trade-off factors. 770170. Automotive Fuel Fed Fire- A Preventative Ap- proach. C. Chiti and S. Garbarino, Autodelta, S.p.A., Div. of Alfa Romeo (Italy). The Autodelta group of Alfa Romeo has examined the contribution of fuel tanks to the risks of fuel fed automotive fires. Preliminary work has been done with Formula 1 and Prototype racing machines to determine the basic practicalities, weight penalties, effectiveness and cost/benefit. The motor-sports area was chosen for first application, since there are statistics available indicating a need for investigation. Accurate data on passenger vehicle crash induced fuel fed fires is scarce and of questionable value as to the cause/effect relations, since there is no standardized method of reporting that yields significant information either in Europe or the U.S.A. 770171. Rear Body Construction of Sub-Compacts and Fuel System Integrity in Rear End Collisions. Kazutoshi Arima, Kiyokazu Seo and Tamio Arakawa, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan). 39</page><page sequence="25">770172 -770177 According to the investigation and analysis of rear moving barrier collision experiments with sub-compacts which were of front-engine, rear drive, and unitary construction, and which had two different types of conventional fuel tank arrangements (either in the luggage compartment or under the rear floor panel behind the rear axle), it was confirmed that further improvement in fuel system integrity could be achieved by controlling rear body crashworthiness corresponding to each fuel tank ar- rangement. Especially with the second type of arrange- ment, crash energy must be absorbed by body defor- mation both in front of and behind the tank, while at the same time deformation of the rear floor surrounding the tank and the tank itself must be prevented. 1977 SA E Transactions 770172. Possible Effects of FMVSS 301 on Motor Vehicle Development and Design. Ulrich Seiffert and Arnold Ensslen, Research and Develop- ment, Volkswagen AG (Germany). The Federal Motor Vehicle Standard 301 was introduced in 1968 with the requirements that in a frontal barrier collision at 30 mph allowable fuel leakage was limited to only 28 g or 28 g/min during and after the collision. For model years 1976 and 1977 only limited fuel leakage may occur during a frontal, Â±30Â° frontal barrier crash test, lateral and rear end collision with a 4,000-lb barrier and subsequent constrained rollover. The changes of the FMVSS have necessitated major changes in the number of tests and vehicle equipment required. The question arises whether this additional cost in development work and for the vehicle is justified. 770173. General Motors Static Rollover Fixture. Charles R. Mein and Robert B. Ballmer, Safety Res. &amp; Dev. Lab., Environmental Activities Staff, Gen- eral Motors Proving Ground. A static rollover test fixture was constructed at the Safety Research and Development Laboratory, General Motors Proving Ground, to test vehicles in accordance with the static rollover requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 301 (Fuel System Integrity). The GM static rollover test fixture incorporates several unique design features which minimize the overall test time and required man-hours, and assure compliance to the test parameters outlined in the Standard. It has been operational since November of 1974, and has performed quite satisfactorily, requiring only minor repair and periodical maintenance. This paper describes the development, design, and operation of this facility. 770174. Corrosion Inhibiting Rubber Seals. B. A. Miksie, Northern Instruments Corp.; and W. G. Levans, Garlock, Inc. A new oil seal rubber compound has been developed with considerably improved GMRP corrosion rating. This was achieved by compounding the basic Hycar 1042 elastomer with compatible corrosion inhibitor, capable of inhibiting the corrosion process on rubber-metal interface. The inhibitor was compounded at 5% by weight level, and was found protective to steel, aluminum, brass and bronze. High degree of protection was achieved under increased temperature and humidity conditions, and promising results obtained in various test fluids including common oils and fuels. 770175. Effect of Foreign Matters on Sealing Charac- teristics of Oil Seals. Hiroshi Hirabayashi, Tatsuaki Yukimasa and Kazuo Uchino, Nippon Oil Seal Industry Co., Ltd. (Japan). Fine solid particles in a lubricating oil affect the sealing characteristics of oil seals, and their lives are shortened by the wear of oil seals and shafts created by the particles. Tests were carried out by using various kinds of foreign matters. The results showed that foreign matters in oil film between the sealing lip and the shaft surface directly caused the leakage. Consequently, it was recon- firmed that the practical application of dust lip and the countermeasure in the construction of seals or their housings were indispensable to obtain the long life and the stable operation of oil seals. 770176. A Study of Dust Cover Seals for Ball Joint Application. Hiroshi Hirabayashi and Kenichi Terai, Nippon Oil Seal Industry Co., Ltd. (Japan); and Akira Matsushima, NOK-USA, Inc. (Japan). From the analysis of observational results of the many dust cover seals to be used on passenger cars, it has become clear that the control of the seal design functions such as the working envelope (space available for seal side-wall), the contact face load of the sealing lip, the axial rebound load by the side-wall component, and the anti-ozone property of side-wall materials are necessary to maintain the sealing performance, and that the present dust cover seals satisfy needs requested by the customers. Therefore, these characteristics should be sufficient when considering the designing of the seal. 770177. Experimental and Theoretical Analysis on In- dependent Rear Suspension and Body Structure to Reduce Interior Noise. Masakatsu Sano, Yasuhiko Fujiwara and Atsuyuki Naka, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. A theoretical and experimental vibration analysis was carried out on the vehicle equipped with independent rear suspension in order to reduce the interior noise. As the results it is confirmed that the following items have the great effects on the transmission of exciting force; namely: (1) Coil-spring location (2) Dynamic stiffness of mounting insulator (3) Rigidity of suspension-member (4) Rigidity of body structure where suspension is mounted 40</page><page sequence="26">770178 -770184 These results were applied to the actual new type of vehicle and its interior noise was measured and three-four dB (A) of noise reduction was obtained. 770178. The Application of Handling Requirements to an RSV-Type Vehicle. David H. Weir and John W. Zellner, Systems Technology, Inc. Results of a study to specify, develop, and test the handling characteristics of a prototype research safety vehicle are reported. Handling requirements which were used to evaluate the transient and steady state response and performance are described. These requirements and criteria were based on a review of contemporary results in the area of handling and controllability, and they combine vehicle performance envelopes and driver-centered con- siderations. The resulting criteria are used as handling objectives in the testing and evaluation of a prototype small sedan. 770179. Chrysler Corporation's Isolated Transverse Tor- sion Bar Front Suspension. Christopher M. Kennedy, Jack C. Kerby, John A. MichaÅowicz and Robert H. Smith, Chrysler Corp. To satisfy the objectives of Chrysler's new generation of compact vehicles, a unique front suspension system was created. This system has achieved an outstanding level of ride comfort while providing significant advantages in the basic vehicle packaging. The key to the system is the transverse torsion bar and bushings which serve the dual function of suspension spring and fore and aft restraint for the lower control arm. Producing this torsion bar in mass production required advances in both engineering and manufacturing technology. 770180. (SP-413) Truck Electrical Systems. Raymond E. Heller, International Harvester Co. This paper is written to provide the student or beginner in the truck electrical field with a basic background and understanding of components and systems being used today. Starting with batteries, details of the newer maintenance free units are reviewed before moving on to operational and application criteria for charging, crank- ing, ignition, instrument, lighting, and electronic com- ponents as they are incorporated in production vehicles. The paper discusses trends that show the direction in which the industry can be expected to move over the next several years. 1977 SA E Transactions 770181. A Mechanism of Disc-Brake Squeal. S. W. E. Earles, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, King's College (United Kingdom). Further results, obtained from a pin-disc system, are presented which support the theory that the generation of squeal noise in disc-brakes is caused by a geometrically induced or kinematic constraint instability. The unstable regions are shown to be dependent on the coefficient of friction between the interacting surfaces and the mag- nitudes of the physical parameters of the system elements. The relevance of certain system parameters is discussed in relation to a three degree-of-freedom, undamped model having linear characteristics. Some results which appear to contradict the proposed basic squeal generating mecha- nism are explained. The fugitive nature of squeal noise in disc-brakes is discussed and an explanation is given based on the proposed instability theory. 1977 SA E Transactions 770182. Braking Regulations For Passenger Cars. Paul Oppenheimer, Girling Ltd. (England). A summary of worldwide passenger car braking regu- lations reveals that two standards are being increasingly adopted: the USA Federal Standard 105-75 and the EEC Directive 71/320 (equivalent to ECE Regulation 13). Recent amendments of these two important regula- tions are critically reviewed, with special emphasis on the European vehicle stability and adhesion utilization pre- scriptions. Supplementary comparisons between the USA and European braking regulations include analyses of the corresponding test procedures, which may benefit the harmonization studies initiated by the ECE government experts in Geneva. 1977 SA E Transactions 770183. The Girling Colette Disc Brake. H. Rath and S. Micke, Girling Continental Operations. This paper on single sided calipers traces the way in which experience of the difficulties in maintaining consistent performance with minimum drag for fuel economy is leading to wider use of sealed enclosed sliding systems for calipers accepting a small space penalty for the greater durability which is ensured. 1977 SA E Transactions 770184. Development of a Lightweight Small Car Disc Brake System for International Usage. Robert T. DuCharme, Bendix Automotive Control Sys- tems Group Engineering; and Vincent J. Keane, Patons Brake Replacements, Div. of REPCO. Automotive component weight savings and material conservation have become critically important as one begins to fully realize the limitations on the world's resources, especially with respect to fuels. A new disc brake concept has been developed specifically to meet these new automotive requirements and is particularly well suited for today's smaller and lighter vehicles. The Series IV floating head disc brake is mounted directly to the steering knuckle, using two bolts which extend through sleeves without requiring the traditional brake anchor plate, thus saving both weight and material. Further weight savings in the brake are achieved by use of a two-piece construction which utilizes an aluminum housing, while, at the same time, simplifying front wheel bearing, disc and lining assembly service or replacement. 41</page><page sequence="27">770185 -770191 Since the brake floats on two sealed and lubricated sleeves, the brake sliding forces do not increase with service time or exposure to corrosive environments. Thus, problems due to increased sliding forces, which occa- sionally require servicing are eliminated. The Series IV disc brake design originated at DBA, Division Technique, a brake design, development, and manufacturing concern in Paris, France, which is a Bendix subsidiary. It was further developed by Bendix Auto- motive Control Systems Group Engineering and Patons Brake Replacements, an Australian Licensee of Bendix in conjunction with DBA, thus utilizing a broad range of international brake design, development, and testing experience in a coordinated program. The culmination of this work has been customer acceptance and production of this design in Australia. The extensive design, development, and testing pro- gram is described in detail and typical results are presented. 1977 SA E Transactions 770185. The Volkswagen Safety Steering Columns for Forward Control Vehicles. Joachim Pohl and Aribert Kolms, Transporter Safety Testing Dept., Volks wagen werk AG (Germany). This paper describes the application of safety steering columns to forward control vans. The steeper mounting angle of the steering column in vans requires a collapse function to be affected by radial forces as compared to design requirements encountered in most passenger vehicles during frontal impact situations. Although for- ward controlled vans are exempted from the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards 203 and 204, it is evident that so-called safety steering columns can and do function in forward control vehicles. 770186. The Acceptability of Car Seat Belts. I. A. R. Galer, Inst, for Consumer Ergonomics, Univ. of Technology (United Kingdom). Almost every private motor car in the U.K. is equipped with seat belts for the front seat occupants. Surveys have shown that belt usage rates seldom exceed 37% overall. A research program is described that sought to establish why car seat belt usage is low; the reactions of people to seat belts and other forms of occupant restraint; and ways in which usage may be increased. The major conclusion was that belt usage can only practicably be increased to high levels, by the introduction of legislation requiring usage; other concomitant solutions were however offered. 770187. Comfort and Convenience Improvements to In- crease Safety Belt Utilization. Cyril Henderson, American Safety Equipment Corp. To obtain the social benefits of increased safety belt utilization, the important role of improvements is stressed. Passive restraints represent one possibility for improve- ment of convenience, and several systems are briefly reviewed. The view is expressed that the more sophis- ticated type of passive system would not offer the consumer good value for money, and that the continuing upgrading of active safety belts or simple passive belts would serve the public better. Existing belts are reviewed and comment made on methods of improvement, with special reference to the reduction of shoulder belt pressure. 1977 SA E Transactions 770188. An Empirical Approach to Motorcycle Silencing. G. E. Roe, Simon Engrg. Labs, Univ. of Manchester. This paper describes a simple inexpensive system of motorcycle silencing which has given successful results on prototype and production, touring and competition, 2-stroke and 4-stroke machines. Noise sources are iden- tified and compared. The noise from principal sources is silenced by several techniques, but mainly using the Annular Cavity type of unit developed earlier. The procedure for tuning is discussed, using the case history of a 380 cc 2-stroke enduro motorcycle. Reduction of intake and exhaust noise is typically 12-25 dB A, with a useful increase in power. 770189. Abnormal Combustion in Two-Stroke Motorcycle Engines. Takahiko Aoyama, Masato Nakajima, Minoru Onishi and Susumu Nagahiko, Kawa- saki Heavy Industries, Ltd. (Japan). With increase in displacement per cylinder, 2-stroke engines, unstable engine revolution and abnormal cyl- inder noise due to abnormal combustion are frequently experienced. Solution of this abnormal combustion which has close relation with mixture strength becomes very important in connection with countermeasures against poisonous exhaust emission. This report presents measuring and analysis of engine combustion pressure, studies in causes of abnormal combustion and effect of countermeasures against this problem. 1977 SA E Transactions 770190. Suzuki Production Rotary Engine, Model RE-5 for Powering Motorcycles. Shigeyasu Kamiya and Sadao Shirasagi, Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd. This paper describes the technical data on the devel- opment of rotary engine, Model RE-5 which is designed to power motorcycle, and has a piston displacement of 497 cc in a single rotor. During the process of development, a number of problems such as combustion variation on low-load, cracking of the stationary gear, oil consumption and etc. were solved. Moreover, we made a success of discovering most suited structure of plug located on the trailing side to prevent fouling and preignition. 770191. (SP-414) Selecting Compression Ratio for Op- timum Fuel Economy with Emission Constraints. R. E. Baker, E. E. Daby and J. W. Pratt, 42</page><page sequence="28">770192-770196 Engineering and Research Staff Ford Motor Company. An experimental program is described for selecting engine compression ratio to optimize vehicle fuel economy, with imposed emission constraints. A method was developed to relate quantitatively the results of single cylinder engine experiments to vehicle emission test results. Engine and vehicle experiments were conducted to validate the method. This study concludes that compression ratio optimization is determined primarily by hydrocarbon emission restrictions. Projections for a 1975 400 CID engine in a 5000 pound vehicle demonstrate that the traditional relationship between fuel economy and com- pression ratio is reversed below CVS-CH HC levels in the range of 1.0-1.5 gm/mile. 1 977 SA E Transactions 770192. (SP-414) The Effects of Engine Variables and Exhaust Gas Recirculation on Emissions, Fuel Economy, and Knock - Part III. C. R. Morgan and P. W. Kirklin, Mobil Research and Devel- opment Corporation Paulsboro, N.J. Steady-state engine mapping data were obtained from a 400 CID V-8 spark-ignition engine at compression ratios of 8.0 and 9.3:1 to determine the effect of compression ratio on fuel consumption and octane number require- ment at various exhaust emission levels. The results indicate that increasing compression ratio from 8.0 to 9.3 decreases BSFC without changing BSNOx emissions, but increases BSHC emissions. Additionally, when BSHC emissions are maintained at the constant levels considered in this study, the minimum BSFC decreases with increas- ing compression ratio and is obtained at A/F ratios of 16 to 18:1. Since this trend of decreased fuel consumption with increasing compression ratio at fixed HC and NOx emission levels is the opposite of that indicated by earlier studies using a single-cylinder RDH engine, some possible explanations for these differences are presented. In actual vehicle operation, octane requirements would generally increase with increasing compression ratio. Other studies, however, have shown that the energy savings due to improvement in engine efficiency with increased com- pression ratio may be more than offset by refinery losses incurred in producing higher octane fuels. 770193. (SP-414) The Effects of Combustion Chamber Design and Compression Ratio on Emissions, Fuel Economy and Octane Number Requirement. K. Matsumoto, T. Inoue, K. Nakanishi and T. Okumura, Toyota Motor Company. Four combustion chamber designs and three compression ratios (8:1, 9:1 and 10:1) were investigated for their emission, fuel economy, and octane number requirement characteristics using a 1.6 liter (96.9 CID) 4 cylinder engine. Time resolved measurement of hydrocarbon emissions was carried out to clarify the reason for differences in tail pipe emission between these combustion chambers. The "High Turbulence Type" combustion chambers, which included swirl (piston swirl) and/or squish, indicated better fuel economy under emission and octane number requirement constraints. The HC emission of the combustion chamber with squish and swirl was lower than that of the combustion chambers with squish alone. The time resolved measurement of HC emissions explained the difference in the exhaust process of these unburned hydrocarbons. A compression ratio of 9:1 was the best compromise for optimum fuel economy with this high turbulence combustion chamber, under the target constraints for HC and NOx emissions assumed for these tests. 1977 SA E Transactions 770195. (SP-414) ORI of Today's Vehicles- Part II. B. D. Keller, G. H. Meguerian, J. B. Smith and C. B. Tracy, Amoco Oil Company. Continued studies with full-scale engines in the laboratory have provided additonal information about the param- eters that affect ORI in today's cars. Reduced coolant temperature studies showed an average decrease in ORI of about two units in two popular make engines and no effect in a third make. Coolant temperature had no significant effect on exhaust emissions from any of the engines tested. Tests conducted on gasoline "tail" end properties showed that gasoline endpoint had no effect on ORI, while an increase in polycyclic nuclear aromatics increased it. A manganese antiknock additive reduced ORI in one make engine. Lube oil metal additive type and type of viscosity index (VI) improver affected ORI whereas, sulfated ash content did not affect it. A shortened laboratory test cycle produces ORI comparable to our previous laboratory procedure. 770196. (SP-414) Evaluation of Three-Way Catalysts. Part II. H. S. Gandhi, A. G. Piken, H. K. Stepien and M. Shelef, Research Staff, Ford Motor Co.; R. G. Delosh and M. E. Hey de, Advanced Engine Engineering, Ford Motor Company. This is a continuation of our earlier paper on the laboratory evaluation of three-way catalysts, SAE 76201. A number of recent 3-way catalyst formulations were evaluated in a laboratory flow-reactor when fresh, after 25,000 simulated miles on a pulse-flame reactor and after 100 or 200 hours of accelerated AMA dynamometer durability. A comparison was made of the effects of contaminant levels on the performance of pulsator - and dynamometer-aged selected catalysts. The 4-fold decrease in contaminant (lead and phosphorus) levels in 76/77 certification fuel compared with the 75/76 fuel signif- icantly improved the durability of 3-way catalysts. The problems of increased NH3 formation on pulsator - and dynamometer-aged catalysts which contain base-metal oxides as oxygen-storage or water-gas shift components is attributed to S-poisoning. An inverse relationship between NH3 formation and the amount of rhodium on aged 3-way catalysts was noted. The effects of deliberate misfire on 43</page><page sequence="29">770197 -770204 the selectivity and activity characteristics are discussed. Further, the role of the water-gas shift and steam- reforming components in extending the "window" was studied. The effect of temperature and of inlet CO (H2) and hydrocarbon concentration on these reactions was investigated separately on single component samples and fully formulated catalysts. The extent of sulfate formation over typical fresh and dynamometer-aged 3-way catalysts is shown. The relatively small effect of Rh levels in 3-way catalysts on the extent of the sulfate formation is attributed to the possible enrichment of the catalyst surface by Rh, under oxidizing conditions, thereby resulting in a lower Pt/Rh ratio on the surface of the catalyst than in the bulk. 770197. (SP-414) Catalyst Systems Development. Y. Kaneko, H. Kobayashi, R. Komagome, T. Nakagami and T. Fukui, Mitsubishi Motors Corporation. This paper describes the results of studies on the behavior of air-fuel ratios under feedback control, the effect of air-fuel ratio modulation on three-way catalyst conversion efficiency and emission test results with and without feed back control. As a further measure for decreasing automobile exhaust emissions, the three-way catalyst activity for reduction of CO, HC and NOx emissions is most effectively utilized when the normal engine air-fuel ratio perturbations are controlled and limited. In order to attain such an objective, this report describes the gov- erning characteristics of an air-fuel ratio control system using an EF1 engine coupled to a Zr02 type 02 sensor and feed back loop. The conversion efficiency characteristics of a conventional three-way catalyst, using systematically modulated air-fuel ratios, and the resultant reduction of exhaust emissions with these systematic fluctuations and limited perturbations are also defined. 770198. (SP-414) The Formation and Control of Sulfuric Acid Emissions over Automotive Catalysts. N. Tokura, T. Saito, Y. Hasegawa and K. Katoh, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. In order to find a way to minimize sulfuric acid formation while maintaining high HC and CO conversion, the effect of temperature, air-fuel ratio, space velocity and catalyst metal composition on S02 conversion was studied. Both pelleted and monolithic catalysts were investigated using an engine dynamometer and a small diameter dilution tunnel. The effect of engine operating conditions on S02 conversion was clarified and an advantageous shape for the catalytic converter was found. Thirteen pelleted and four monolithic catalysts were tested with rhodium showing a remarkable effect on HC conversion selectivity. 770199. Denting Properties of Aluminum Autobody Com- ponents. C. E. Burley and B. A. Niemeier, Reynolds Metals Co. Dynamic denting tests have been conducted on actual autobody components and on simulated panels fabricated from aluminum and steel sheet at impact velocities of 20 to 125 mph. These experiments give additional evidence that dent depth is a linear function of impact velocity. They also show that autobody components fabricated from aluminum sheet can have equal or improved dent resistance compared to the same components fabricated from the steel alloys currently used. Primary factors to be considered in comparing dynamic dent resistance are sheet thickness, yield strength, modulus of elasticity, density and geometric shape. 770200. Structural Characteristics of Aluminum Body Sheet. R. L. Rolf, M. L. Sharp and H. H. Stroebel, Alcoa Technical Center, Aluminum Co. of America. Dent resistance and flutter are considerations in gauge selection in autobody applications. The influence of each of these factors is discussed and test data are presented. Data from dent tests are utilized to develop relative thicknesses of aluminum and steel for equal dent per- formance. Comparisons are made with other published data. Vibration tests and analysis indicate that flutter should not be an important factor in determining the relative thickness of aluminum and steel for body sheet applications. 1977 SA E Transactions 770203. A Highly Formable Aluminum Alloy - 5182-SSF. David S. Thompson, Reynolds Metals Co. The best combination of strength and formability of any aluminum alloy is offered by the 5000 series (Al-Mg) alloys containing 4 to 5% magnesium, e.g. 5182. In the conventional annealed state (-0 temper) necessary for maximum formability, this alloy suffers from the for- mation of type A Luder lines (stretcher strains) when plastically deformed a small amount Â«1%). Such Luder lines are similar to those commonly encountered in steel and are unacceptable in outer panels. The conditions under which Luder lines form are discussed. The intro- duction of 5182-SSF has completely avoided these problems with a stretcher-strain free (SSF) material which exceeds the formability of 5182-0. 1977 SA E Transactions 770204. Aluminum Pretreatment to Improve Resistance Spot Weld Tiplife. G. A. Dorsey, Jr. and F. E. Gibbs, Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp. The surface contact resistance of aluminum can be stabilized in a suitable micro-ohm range and this will prolong tiplife during spot welding. Alloys 2036-T4 and 5182-0 were processed to give 75 micro-ohm surface resistance that would remain stabilized for storage times of at least ten weeks. The metal pretreatment consisted of conventional cleaning followed by a process to reoxidize to the desired micro-ohm level. The final step was a stabilization process consisting of a brief dip in mildly alkaline stearate solution, which produced a reacted monolayer of stearate above the existing oxide. The 44</page><page sequence="30">770205 -770213 stearate monolayer stabilizes the contact resistance, presumably by preventing further oxide filmforming reactions. 1977 SAE Transactions 770205. Springback Considerations in Forming Alumi- num. B. A. Niemeier, Reynolds Metals Co. Springback from tension loading has been quantitatively assessed for 5182 aluminum alloy after various percents of rolling reduction. Aluminum alloys 5182-H140, 2036-T4, X7046-T6 and 1010-CQ steel as commercially produced also have been evaluated and compared in relation to springback, both in tensile and bending situations. Laws of plasticity are used to develop stress and incorporated with laws of elasticity to calculate recovery strain and overbend angle. Formulations are given to compute springback strain and springback angle. The author shows that the modulus of elasticity, strength coefficient and strain hardening exponent are useful in calculating springback. 770206. Warm Forming High-Strength Aluminum Au- tomotive Parts. Larry R. Morris, Aluminum Co. of Canada; and Robert A. George, Chrysler Corporation. This paper is concerned with press forming of work hardened or age hardened aluminum alloy sheet at temperatures in the range 1 00-300Â° C. By controlling the time and temperature of forming below that necessary for recrystallization or over-aging the formability is signif- icantly enhanced while a high room temperature tensile strength is maintained. It is shown by both laboratory measurements and plant trials that it is possible to warm form high strength aluminum sheet into complex parts. A brief discussion is given on some of the important materials and process considerations. 770207. Inspection for Defects on Aluminum Body Sheet. Ronald A. Holt, Aluminum Company of Amer- ica, Alcoa Center, Pa. 15069. One of the problems with the introduction of aluminum auto body sheet for hood and deck lid assemblies has been the inspection of the surface for defects. Inspection techniques currently used for steel have not been entirely successful in locating defects on aluminum body sheet. By using a method which controls the illumination intensity, an inspector can much more quickly and easily locate surface defects and panel imperfections. 7702Ã8. Observations on Spot Welding Aluminum for Automotive Applications. R. D. Dewey and R. S. Mapes, Metallurgical Research Div., Reynolds Metals Co. These observations were made during tip-life tests in spot welding mill finish aluminum alloys. Nugget-formation quality can be monitored effectively and non-destructively by use of a motion transducer. Interface dynamic- resistance can be monitored by electrode to electrode voltage drop. Cumulative deterioration of the electrodes can be -measured semi-quantitatively by micrometrie profile recording. These techniques permit short-run schedules for screening the effectiveness of surface treatments. It is also shown that nugget shear load can be estimated when gauge, nugget diameter, and ultimate tensile strength are known. 770209. A Family of High-Strength Steels for Today's Automotive Requirements. S. Dinda and A. S. Kasper, Materials Engineering Chrysler Cor- poration. New grades of high strength steels are discussed for vehicle weight reductions to improve fuel economy. These new materials are cold rolled high strength steels with a yield strength range of 275 MPa (40 Ksi) to 310 MPa (45 Ksi). These high strength steels are designed to provide strength in formed parts 50 percent greater than com- parable grades of today's low carbon cold rolled steels. The basic requirements for these steels are described and compared with today's automotive needs. The devel- opmental status and the experience with these materials are outlined in this paper. 770211. GM 980X - Potential Applications and Review. M. S. Rashid, Metallurgy Dept., General Motors Res. Labs. The mechanical properties of GM 980X, a unique high strength low alloy steel with formability better than that of SAE 950X steels and the strength of SAE 980X steel in the formed component, are reviewed and the microstructure which produces these properties is described. A brief comparison is made between GM 980X and other steels with similar microstructures. The superior formability and weight saving potential of GM 980X has been demonstrated in various com- ponent trials. Some potential automotive applications are listed and a few forming trials and qualification tests to validate component strength are described. 1977 SAE Transactions 770212. No Damage Steel Bumpers - A New Approach. William J. Riffe, Transportation Industries Market Development U. S. Steel Corp. An approach to NO DAMAGE steel bumpers for 1980 vehicles is presented. Included in the study is consid- eration for dent resistance, materials, forming, joining, and corrosion. The design philosophy is carried to prototype testing. The results indicate that a bumper system - bumpers and energy absorbers - may be de- signed in steel at 1% of the vehicle gross weight. 770213. Energy Absorption of High-Strength Steel Tubes Under Impact Crush Conditions. R. C. Van Kuren and J. E. Scott, Research Dept., Bethlehem Steel Corp. The energy absorption of automotive sheet steels was 45</page><page sequence="31">770214-770219 determined at impact speeds to 40 mph by crushing tubular structures at 70 and -40 F. The test program was designed to provide an intermediate step between tensile and vehicle tests aimed at understanding material behav- ior at high impact speeds. Energy absorption increased with impact velocity, strength, thickness, and lower temperature, Energy absorbed was also influenced by tube geometry. These results show that the new HSLA steels provide excellent energy absorption and that designers can use these steels at relatively light gages to reduce vehicle weight without sacrificing crashworthiness, even at low temperature. 1977 SAE Transactions 770214. Ultimate Strength and Failure Mode of Spot Welds in High Strength Steels. D. J. Vanden- Bossche, Senior Materials Development Engi- neer, Chrysler Corporation. The strength and failure mode of a resistance spot weld between two sheets of steel are shown to be dependent upon the thickness and yield strength of the base material, the diameter of the weld, the strength of the weld metal, and the restraint imposed by the material surrounding the weld. A relationship is developed which makes possible the reliable calculation of the weld diameter required to cause heat affected zone failure around the weld when loaded in shear. It applies to plain carbon steel and the high strength, micro-alloyed steels of up to 690 Mpa (100,000 psi) yield strength. This relationship along with another relating weld failure load to the base metal strength form the basis for a proposed weldability criteria for low carbon steel. 1977 SA E Transactions 770215. 980 XK: A Critical Automotive Application for HSLA Steel. John J. Jurkowski and Robert N. Keller, National Steel Corp. Previous applications of 980 XK steels in the automotive industry have been limited. However, to meet increased structural requirements of MVSS-301, AMC has incor- porated 980 XK steel in the 1977 Gremlin and Hornet underbody rear sill subassemblies. This paper emphasizes how formability and spot weldability characteristics were optimized in order to meet the vehicular crashworthiness required in this structural application. Traditional mild steel design, forming, and spot welding procedures were successfully modified to utilize 980 XK. These modifications are practical and have been successfully incorporated in production operations. 1977 SA E Transactions 770216. Welding Processing for HSLA Steels in Unitized Body Construction. Charles F. Padden, Ameri- can Motors Corp. The American Motors Corporation 1977 model Gremlin and Hornet passenger cars utilize SAE 980 XK high strength low alloy (HSLA) steel as the material from which is fabricated the body side rear sills. This is the first known application of 80 ksi (552 MPa) HSLA steel for a unitized auto body major structural component. The selection of 980 XK HSLA steel enabled AMC advanced chasis engineers to successfully modify an existing rear body structure to withstand the rear barrier impact test required for 1977 model passenger cars by FMVSS #301. This paper presents the welding, assembly, and quality control procedures developed by AMC manufacturing engineers to assure that production body structures meet all design specifications. 1977 SAE Transactions 770217. Effects of Swirl and Squish on S.I. Engine Combustion and Emission. Isao Nagayama, Yasushi Araki and Yasuo Iioka, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan). The effect of intensified swirl and squish on combustion and emissions in a spark-ignition engine was studied using a four cylinder, 1.4 litre engine. Swirl was intensified by modifying intake port angle and squish was controlled by modifying squish area and clearance. From the test results it was found that the increased intensity of swirl, squish and swirl-squish combination was highly effective to increase burning velocity, to improve cycle to cycle combustion fluctuation, fuel economy and driveability. Especially, it was shown that swirl was effective in the initial stage of combustion and swirl-squish combination was influential in the whole stage of combustion. 1977 SAE Transactions 770218. DIGITAP - An On-Line Acquisition and Pro- cessing System for Instantaneous Engine Data - Applications. A. Douaud and P. Eyzat, Institut Francais du PÃ©trole (France). A versatile data acquisition system for engine pressure- time history is described. The on-line system utilizes a 12-bit sample-and-hold A/D converter in conjunction with a minicomputer. The computer controls the acqui- sition process and performs data processing to generate the desired results. The time base for the system is generated by a shaft mounted disk and photoelectric sensors. On-line selection based on predefined criteria of particular interest is software implemented. Statistical data are available such as the standard deviation and the histogram of maximum pressure. Teletype print, XY plot and punched paper tape are standard outputs. Among the wide variety of potential applications of this system, some actual examples in such areas as cyclic variation, knock, friction losses and heat transfer are given. 770219. Equivalence Ratio Meter. R. A. Haslett, Ricardo &amp; Co. Engineers, Ltd.; and T. M. Eidson, Ford Motor Co. Mixture strength, or equivalence ratio, is the primary 46</page><page sequence="32">770220 - 770225 factor affecting the fuel consumption and exhaust emis- sions of a gasoline engine. A new instrument has recently been developed to monitor equivalence ratio. The re- sponse time of the instrument is 1/2 second, so that the effects of engine transient conditions, such as fast throttle opening, can be studied with greater accuracy than is possible with current exhaust emission analysers. This paper will cover the concept, design and devel- opment of the prototype instrument, including the calibration tests on gas mixtures and an engine. In addition, a more sophisticated meter has been designed for production. The equivalence ratio characteristics of a number of current and advanced engines have been monitored with this instrument and the results are presented. 1977 SA E Transactions 770220. Measurements of the Spatial Distribution and Engine Speed Dependence of Turbulent Air Motion in an I.C. Engine. Peter O. Witze, Sandia Labs. A hot-wire anemometer was used to study the air motion in a motored i.e. engine. Measurements were made of the mean velocity, turbulence intensity, and integral scales of turbulence. The engine speed was varied from 500 to 2500 rpm, and the hot-wire probe was traversed both across the combustion chamber clearance volume and down into the piston sweep volume. The latter traverse was accom- plished by probe-accommodating "wells" built into the piston crown, which were subsequently shown to severely disrupt the flow during the compression and expansion strokes. The results show the mean velocity and turbulence intensity to vary linearly with engine speed, and the turbulence scales to be a function of geometry only. The structure of turbulence was found to be inhomogeneous in the clearance volume and the upper portion of the sweep volume. 1977 SA E Transactions 770221. Heat Balance Provides Insight into Modern Engine Fuel Utilization. Frank Ament, Engi- neering Staff, General Motors Corp., Donald J. Patterson, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, University of Michigan; and Arvin Mueller, Chevrolet Engineering, General Motors Corp. Heat balance studies were conducted on a 1975 produc- tion 5.74/ V-8 and an experimental 3.69/ V-6 to determine sources of fuel economy differences when they were installed in a vehicle. Heat balance results, friction and fuel economy were explored during dynamometer tests simulating road load. Comparisons were made with and without certain emission control features. With comparable calibrations, the road load indicated efficiency was nearly the same for each engine as it would be installed in a vehicle with an appropriate axle ratio. The results suggest that engine friction and not combus- tion efficiency accounted for the major fuel economy difference. 770223. Modeling the Complete Otto Cycle - Preliminary Version. Frank J. Zeleznik and Bonnie J. Mc- Bride, NASA, Lewis Research Center. A description is given of the equations and the computer program being developed to model the complete Otto cycle. The program incorporates such important features as: 1) heat transfer, 2) finite combustion rates, 3) complete chemical kinetics in the burned gas, 4) exhaust gas recirculation, and 5) manifold vacuum or supercharging. Changes in thermodynamic, kinetic and transport data as well as model parameters can be made without repro- gramming. Preliminary calculations indicate that: 1) chemistry and heat transfer significantly affect compo- sition and performance, 2) there seems to be a strong interaction among model paramemeters, and 3) a number of cycles must be calculated in order to obtain steady- state conditions. 770224. Exhaust Emission Control of S. I. Engines by Engine Modification - The SEEC-T System. Tatsuhisa Fukushima, Hiroyuki Nakamura and Tatsuo Sakai, Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. (Ja- pan). We have recently developed the SEEC-T (Subaru Exhaust Emission Control - Thermal and Thermodynamic Con- trol) system that meets the 1977 emission standards of the United States including California and the 1976 standards of Japan without catalytic converters or thermal reactors, and which will satisfy the more stringent emission standards expected in the future. The SEEC-T system reduces HC, CO and NOx by the following three means. First; air fuel ratio is set leaner than stoichiometric by improvements in the carburetor. Combustion gas tem- perature is controlled by EGR and ignition timing control. Introduction of secondary air into the cylinder by backflow from the exhaust port improves combustion at light load driving. These means reduce the three emission components within the cylinder. Second; exhaust port liners inserted in a Siamese type exhaust port reduce HC and CO discharged from cylinders by holding the exhaust gas at higher temper- atures. Third; insulated exhaust manifold helps to lower residual HC and CO. This paper describes the following four aspects of the SEEC-T system: (1) Structure of the SEEC-T system. (2) Suppression and reduction of HC and CO. (3) Effect of NOx control on driveability, combustion stability and fuel economy. (4) Improvement in combustion by introduction of secondary air. 770225. Basic Reliability Engineering Concepts for Au- tomotive Electronic Systems. Harold A. Lauf- 47</page><page sequence="33">770226 - 770233 fenburger, IIT Research Institute Reliability Analysis Center. An effective reliability engineering program recognizes that achievement of operational reliability is a design parameter. Decisions made during the design process influence all subsequent phases of a system's life cycle in the form of part quality, producibility and maintainability. Therefore, deliberate and positive measures must be instituted during the design and development process which enhance inherent reliability and minimize the introduction of latent defects during manufacturing and inspection, and degradation during field use. This paper presents an overview of reliability for the manager and engineer who has been recently exposed to this engineering discipline that has found widespread application in military systems. It is intended to provide an appreciation for the tools that are available for aiding the automotive industry in achieving a shorter de- sign/development cycle, reducing costs and increasing customer satisfaction. Fundamental reliability engineering concepts are introduced with a brief review of the reliability/life characteristic, exponential failure model, reliability pre- diction techniques and system modeling concepts. Testing philosophies, including accelerated and reliability growth testing methodology are described. Finally, the reliability control program elements appropriate to the several system life-cycle phases are defined. 770226. Reliability Prediction Methodology and Proce- dures. L. A. Mirth and R. C. Walker, ITT Res. Inst. Reliability prediction is the process of quantitatively assessing the reliability of a system during its devel- opment. It permits a quantitative evaluation of design alternatives and progress being achieved relative to a reliability target. This paper introduces the prediction process as applied to electronic systems and components and discusses its applications and limitations. The several techniques such as parts count and part stress analysis are described along with application procedures. A key element to prediction is availability of credible data on the component parts that comprise electronic systems. Major attention is given to models of MIL- HDBK-217B. Most Handbook data requires translation from military to typical automotive conditions particu- larly with regard to operational environment. Guidelines and recommendations for utilization of 217B method- ology and data for predicting reliability for automotive electronic systems is described. 1977 SA E Transactions 770227. Reliability Characteristics of Various Microcircuit Technologies. M. R. Klein and H. A. Lauffen- burger, IIT Research Institute. This paper presents an analysis of microcircuit reliability data residing in the Reliability Analysis Center (RAC) data bank. Included in this study are SSI, MSI and LSI digital, linear and hybrid microcircuits. Failure rate data are presented for all technologies for both test and operational conditions. Failure mode data are presented for TTL, CMOS and hybrid microcircuits. Effects of package configuration, device complexity and test conditions are reviewed. In summary, this paper provides an overview of microcircuit reliability characteristics as derived from a broadly based ongoing data accumulation effort. These data are offered to users as published reports and as indirect response to specific inquiries. 770228. Semiconductor Electrostatic Discharge Damage Protection. R. C. Walker and H. C. Rickers, IIT Research Institute. A current problem plaguing many users of MOS discrete and integrated circuit devices is the high damage rate incurred during handling and normal assembly processes. The characteristic high impedance input gates render these devices extremely vulnerable to damage induced by electrostatic potentials commonly developed in the as- sembly area. Elaborate packaging schemes, handling precautions and grounding techniques are frequently employed to minimize damage rates. The RAC, through assisting users in the determination of effective protective measures for specific situations, has compiled a library of the various techniques and philos- ophies which have been employed to reduce the elec- trostatic discharge damage rate. This paper is intended to aid design and production engineers in acquiring a fuller appreciation of the ESD problem and the precautionary measures which can be employed to control the problem. Specific topics discussed include; device properties which introduce susceptibility to ESD, sources of ESD, failure analysis methods to identify ESD damage, protective methods and materials and a review of actual application experiences. 1977 SA E Transactions 770229. Reliability Considerations in the Use of Inte- grated Circuit Packaging Systems in an Auto- motive Environment. J. N. Thielmann, Signetics Corp. An overview is presented of integrated circuit tech- nologies, complexities, packaging systems, random infant mortality and wearout failure mechanisms, and auto- motive environments. Focus is brought to bear on reliability considerations in the use of integrated circuit packaging systems, with special emphasis on the wearout failure mechanisms of plastic versus hermetic packaging systems in automotive environments. 1977 SA E Transactions 770233. Design Innovations Facilitating Economic Pro- duction of Giant Mouldings. H. Strassheimer, Managing Director GKN Windsor GmbH. 48</page><page sequence="34">770234 - 770238 The philosophy behind the technical developments de- scribed in the paper is the belief in the need to raise the standard of the injection moulding machine to meet the moulders' economic needs for efficient machine loading, low reject rates, and flash-free moulding. It describes progress made in the development of hydraulic circuitry, valve gear, and electronic controls, to provide the greater accuracy needed for fine setting of the injection and the clamping units. It shows how the design of the circuitry permits the use of more than one clamping unit or injection unit in parallel to produce mouldings of very large projected area economically. It also describes an up-to-date method of devolatising thermoplastic materials during plasticising, without predrying, as a contribution to both economics and quality. 770234. The Adhesive Testing of High Strength Lami- nates for Structural Durability. Lawrence R. Carapellotti, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. Automotive designers are presently working with new, high strength plastics, laminates and light-weight metals to utilize the advantages of both for parts which need to meet strict structural durability requirements. Those of particular interest are special light-weight steels, aluminum, HMC and XMC plastics both solids and foams. The suitability of urethane structural bonding systems for these components has been tested and is the topic of this article. 770235. New Designs Through Vibration Welding. Jim Mengason, Branson Sonic Power Co. A new plastics assembly technique has been developed which offers new opportunities in product design and assembly as well as new solutions to existing problems. This method, based on friction welding, overcomes many limitations of conventional welding processes such as part size, shape, material and speed of operation. It produced strong, pressure tight joints. 770237. Evaluation of Meeting Beams of Two- and Three-Beam Headlighting Systems. R. G. Morti- mer, University of Illinois at Urbana-Cham- paign; and P. L. Olson, University of Michigan. The major objective of the study was to provide another indication of the validity of a computer simulation model for predicting visibility with headlight beams. A compar- ison was made of simulation results with those obtained in a field test of five beams for targets positioned at the right and left side of the lane. The agreement obtained was generally good throughout the meeting. The discrepancy between simulation and field test results was greatest for the visibility of targets at the right side of the lane when the vehicles were close to the meeting point. This error was explained as due to the differences in the field test visibility distances used as the comparison data compared to the results of the field studies that were done to provide initial validation of the model. The maximum extent of this error was about 20%. The results show that the model predicts within the error of the field test procedures. While there were no differences between the low beams or the mid beams for visibility of targets at the left of the lane, increases in visibility of up to 30% were attained with mid beams compared to the U.S. or E.C.E. low beams for visibility of targets at the right edge of the lane. An improved headlighting meeting beam configu- ration was suggested consisting of the E.C.E. low beams, for urban driving, and adding a lamp similar to the Type III lamp to form a mid beam for use as a meeting beam on rural roads. 770238. Modeling Vision with Headlights in a Systems Context. Vivek D. Bhise, Eugene I. FÃ¤rber, Carol S. Saunby, George M. Troell, James B. Walunas and Arthur Bernstein, Ford Motor Company. A Headlight Evaluation Model has been developed which provides a broader and more comprehensive method for characterizing the performance of headlamps than is possible in traditional headlight seeing distance field tests. The Headlamp Evaluation Model accepts as input the candlepower patterns of the headlamp system being evaluated and provides a measure of driver visual performance based on a large number of simulated seeing distance tests and glare discomfort checks on a stan- dardized test route. The output of the Model, termed the Figure of Merit, is the percentage of the distance traveled by the simulated driver on the standardized test route in which the seeing, distance to pedestrians and pavement lines, and the discomfort glare levels experienced by opposing drivers, simultaneously meet certain acceptance criteria. The standardized test route is a computer represen- tation of a series of highway sections in the form of a file of environmental parameters which have an influence on visual performance in night driving. The simulation includes such parameters as pavement, lane line and pedestrian reflectance, road geometry, lane configuration, ambient illumination and glare from fixed lighting, and traffic and pedestrian density. The standardized test route is a representation of a U.S. night driving environment as measured in a series of field surveys covering thousands of miles of highway and as reported in the literature. The seeing distance calculations are performed by an integral seeing distance model which is based on the human visual performance literature and validated by field studies. Response to glare is based on published discomfort glare formulations, modified and validated on the basis of highway tests. Because driver visual performance, as expressed in the Figure of Merit, is functionally dependent on environ- mental factors as well as on headlamp characteristics, the Figure of Merit is a systems measure. The Model can be used not only to evaluate headlamps but to measure the sensitivity of driver visual performance to environmental 49</page><page sequence="35">770239 - 770248 factors and thus to improvements in certain aspects of the highway itself. 770239. The Effect of Adverse Visibility on Driver Steering Performance in an Automobile Simula- tor. R. Wade Allen and Duane T. McRuer, Systems Technology, Inc. The driver's ability to control the lateral position of an automobile is dependent on his perception of the com- mand path (roadway) to be followed. This perception is affected by both the configuration of road markings and other features, and the visibility of these elements. As visibility decreases, the driver's preview of the com- manded path is reduced. Theory indicates that driver performance should degrade with reduced preview and configurational pa- rameters which characterize the intermittent nature of delineation (e.g., dashed lines). This paper describes a simulation experiment in which driver behavior and driver/vehicle system performance were measured over a range of visibility and configuration parameter variations. Driver dynamic response and noise (remnant) were reliably affected by variations in visibility and configu- ration. These effects were also reflected in system performance measures such as lane deviations. The results suggest minimum perceptual (visibility) requirements for the driver to maintain adequate steering control of a car under reduced visibility conditions. 1977 SAE Transactions 770244. Driver Eye Locations as Determined by a T.V. System. Ronald R. Mourant, Tong-Kun Pak and Effat Moussa Hamouda, Wayne State Univ. Drivers' eye location data was collected in three vehicle (Vega, 1973 Buick, and Chevrolet Van) and in three environments (laboratory buck, static and on-the-road) for each vehicle type. In each environment data was collected for 50 subjects who were stratified by height and sex. A specially constructed remote coordinate system in connection with T.V. cameras was used for data collec- tion. Drivers' eye locations were found to vary as a function of vehicle type. For the Buick and Van there were differences between data collected in the laboratory buck and on-the-road. There were no differences in data collected in the static environment and on-the-road for any vehicle type. 770245. Comfortable Hand Control Reach of Passenger Car Drivers. Anders HallÃ©n, Car Div., AB Volvo. This paper describes and presents the results of a test to establish the comfortable hand control reach capability of Swedish drivers while sitting in their normal driving position. The comfortable hand control reach and the maximum restrained reach as described by ISO/SAE are compared. Also described is the way the test subjects adjusted the fully adjustable driver's seat to preferred seat position. 1977 SA E Transactions 770246. Performance of a Non-Lacerative Windshield in Case of Accident and Under Environmental Conditions. Otto Jandeleit, Vereinigte Glaswerke (West Germany); and Roger Orain, Saint- Gobain Industries (France). The four-layer laminated Securiflex windshield has been tested in simulated collisions at the Wayne State University up to 40 mph Barrier Equivalent Velocities, to demonstrate that it causes no laceration. has been exposed to usual and extreme environmental conditions to demonstrate its serviceability in field use. The new windshield consists of a conventional lami- nated construction (glass/high penetration resistant inter- layer/glass) combined with a 0.5 mm innerlayer of plastic. Glass is used on the outer surface of the windshield to withstand the abrasion and scratching of sand, windshield wipers and cleaning. The laminated construction prevents penetration and provides a pocket or cushion action to decelerate the head without injury. The innerlayer is made of a special plastic film which protects the face of the occupants against laceration and eye injury during head impact. It also prevents glass particles and splinters from flying inside the vehicle from external impacts of stones and other objects. The inner plastic film is abrasion and scratch resistant. Extended installation in vehicles has shown that it is not damaged through normal use. The Securiflex construction has been exposed to high and low temperature and humidity, chemicals, food, cosmetics, cigarette, smoke, etc.: it is not adversely affected by these agents and has performed perfectly well in long term service tests. 1977 SA E Transactions 11W2A1. What Really Connects in Seating Comfort? - Studies of Correlates of Static Seat Comfort. Stefan Habsburg and Lorna Middendorf, De- sign Staff, General Motors Corp. Evaluations of 20 seating environments were conducted using rating scales, subjective probabilities, and adjective check lists with a representative driver population to develop reliable indices of psychological seating comfort. Concurrent measurable physiologic variations were also recorded to determine relationship patterns. Primary psychological descriptors were identified for each seating environment. Subjective data was compared with phys- iological data and SAE seat dimensioning findings. Multivariate canonical correlation analyses of 32 variables are reported, as are subjective profiles for each seating environment. 1977 SAE Transactions 770248. The Relationship of Hemodynamics to Seating Comfort. Edmund J. Glassford, Consultant. A relationship of selected hemodynamic functions to subjective's seating comfort evaluations has been ob- served. Studies were conducted using rating scales, subjective probabilities, adjective check lists and con- 50</page><page sequence="36">770249 - 770254 current measures of hemodynamics variations with a representative driver population to develop reliable psychophysiological indices of comfort. Thirty-two var- iables constituted the data bank subjected to multivariate canonical correlation analyses. Subjective data were composed with physiological data and SAE seat dimen- sions. Significant relationships among subjective and physiologic measures were found. 1977 SAE Transactions 770249. The Dynamic Characteristics of Automobile Seats with Human Occupants. John H. Var- terasian and Richard R. Thompson, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. The dynamic characteristics of seated humans were measured in a laboratory environment. The seat/occupant system was excited vertically with random vibration. Relevant transfer functions were computed using real time acceleration signals fed to a Fourier Analyzer. The transfer functions describe the seat response, the human response, and the combined response in the frequency range from 2 to 20 Hz. Of possible significance in ride quality studies are the natural modes of vibration which were identified; these include a 3.0 Hz "head-nod" mode, a 3.9 Hz seat vertical mode, a 5.6 Hz human response mode, and a seat "back-slap" mode occurring at 1 1 Hz. 1977 SAE Transactions 770250. Development and Evaluation of a Semi-Reclining Driver's Seat for the XM1 Tank. Currell L. Pattie and Richard L. Gray, Chrysler Defense Divi- sion. The concept of a semi-reclining driver's seat for an advanced tank is based primarily on the need to provide a low tank silhouette in order to decrease the probability of enemy detection, and to present as small a target as possible. An initial seat field test was performed with four Army and nine Chrysler tank drivers. The test data indicated that the seat configuration provided a satis- factory compromise between silhouette and driver com- fort. A supplementary laboratory experiment indicated improvement in comfort-discomfort ratings and favorable reactions to the overall driver's station as a function of increased legroom. Rigorous operational evaluations using experienced Army armor personnel reaffirmed the validity of the seat concept. 1977 SAE Transactions 770251. Comfort Evaluation of Passenger Cars - The Development Ã²f a Simplified Test Procedure. J. Moraal, A. J. Van Eig and J. B. J. Riemersma, Institute for Perception TNO (The Netherlands). In evaluating passenger cars on aspects related to personal comfort and ease of operation, subjective (judgment) as well as objective (measurement) methods can be used. Under contract with a consumers' association three groups of six passenger cars were tested. It was inves- tigated whether an existing questionnaire (subjective method) could be replaced by a simpler one without loss of relevant information and also whether the test pro- cedure could be shortened. The results are in favor of a much simplified and therefore economically more justified test procedure. Furthermore, especially with regard to vibration and the driver's outward visibility, the results of subjective and objective methods were compared. The relative advantages of each are discussed. 770252. The Use of a Modified S.A.E. H-Point Machine in Assembly Plants. Chester W. Klann, Ford Motor Co. As part of a continuing Ford Motor Company program to improve the seating packages of production cars, a simplified in-plant method was developed to check seating variations in production vehicles. The method also provided information helpful in determining causal factors when any irregularities were found. Equipment necessary for checking was designed to be easily trans- ported to any site. 1977 SAE Transactions 770253. Measuring Vibration on Soft Seats. Eleri M. Whitham and Michael J. Griffin, Human Fac- tors Research Unit, Inst, of Sound and Vibration Research, Univ. of Southampton. Two experiments have been conducted to assess a method of measuring the whole-body vertical vibration experi- enced by persons seated on soft seats. The method utilises a transducer mount located between the seat and the body. Comfort contours obtained on hard flat seats are shown to be applicable to measurements made within a firm bar or plate placed on a cushion beneath the ischial tuberosities of a seated subject. However, since some mounts alter seat transmissibility a firm plate (SIT-BAR) contoured to cause seat compression similar to that produced by the buttocks is recommended for some applications. 770254. Diesel Car Emissions - Emphasis on Particulate and Sulfate. Karl J. Springer, Southwest Re- search Institute; and Ralph C. Stahman, Envi- ronmental Protection Agency. Diesel-powered cars afford some distinct advantages in fuel economy and certain exhaust emissions relative to the conventional Otto cycle engine. Particulate and sulfate emissions from light-duty diesels are two important unregulated emissions for which little is known. Five diesel-powered, light-duty vehicles, a Peugeot 204D, a Mercedes 240D, a Mercedes 300D, a Comprex-equipped Mercedes 220D, and a Perkins 6-247 powered IH pickup, were used to quantify the range of particulate, sulfate as well as other unregulated emissions of odor, visible smoke, sulfur dioxide, aldehydes, and selected non-reactive hydrocarbons. Three transient driving cycles were em- ployed including that used in emissions certification, sulfate testing, and highway fuel economy. Emission rates 51</page><page sequence="37">770255 -770261 of particulate, sulfate, and other contaminants of a regulated and unregulated nature are presented in several ways: mass per unit of time, per unit of fuel consumed, and per unit of distance driven. Fuel consumption and economy values are also provided. 770255. Two-Stroke Cycle Diesel Engine Fuel Economy Improvement and Emission Reduction. J. F. Pearce, R. J. Hames and D. F. Merrion, Detroit Diesel Allison Division, General Motors Cor- poration. The 8V-71 TAE engine was developed to provide improved fuel economy and reduced emissions. The effects of turbocharger-blower matching, air charge cooling, and combustion system design changes are presented. Steady state smoke reductions achieved through improved air utilization are compared with improvements in transient smoke on the Federal smoke test cycle. 770256. Gas Emissions and Fuel Economy of the Light Duty Diesel Truck. R. Graham Fairweather, Perkins Engines Co. (United Kingdom). A computer program is used to predict the effect of engine emissions, vehicle gearing, test weight and driving tech- nique on light duty diesel truck emissions levels. The predictions are correlated with actual tests and the vulnerability of using steady state instead of instantaneous emission data studied. An outline of the development of an engine to meet the latest E.P.A. emission level requirement is given. It is concluded that the degree of emissions control required of an engine in order to meet specified legislation depends significantly on whether that engine is to be installed in a truck or a car. 770257. Recent CAV Research into Noise, Emissions, and Fuel Economy of Diesel Engines. M. F. Russell, CAV Ltd. (United Kingdom). The contribution to the external noise from the combus- tion process has been considered in relation to the gaseous emissions, smoke and specific fuel consumption. To satisfy the requirements of proposed legislation in dif- ferent markets, whilst maintaining economical operation, the fuel injection equipment for a diesel engine must compromise between several conflicting requirements. The conflicts are presented in the form of "trade-off" curves over a range of dynamic injection timings. Four means to achieve better "trade-off" curves have been investigated:- higher rate of injection, fumigation, turbo- charging, and turbocharging combined with a higher rate of injection. 770258. Unregulated Emissions from Diesels used in Trucks and Buses. Karl J. Springer, Southwest Research Institute; and Ralph C. Stahman, Environmental Protection Agency. A wide variety of exhaust emissions are reported for three diesel engines typically used in heavy-duty intercity truck and intracity bus operation. Particulate, odor, sulfate, sulfur dioxide, and selected non-reactive hydrocarbons were measured in addition to the regulated pollutants from Detroit Diesel 6V-71 and 8V-71TA engines and a turbocharged Cummins 885 cu in research engine. The 855-TC engine was run in standard and a variable injection timing configuration, while the 6V-71 city bus engine was run with two types of injector designs. Emission rates are summarized in terms of grams per unit of fuel consumed and per unit of power output. The data allows direct comparison between engines and engine configurations, as well as a function of engine speed and load condition. 1977 SA E Transactions 770259. Origins of Hydrocarbon Emissions from Diesel Engines. G. Greeves, I. M. Khan, C. H. T. Wang and I. Fenne, CAV Ltd. Experimental data on the concentration of hydrocarbons (HC) emitted in the exhaust are presented for both direct injection (DI) and indirect injection (IDI) engines and cover the effect of a wide range of engine operating parameters. The analysis shows that there are two main sources of HC in DI engines. One is due to the volume of fuel in the sac and holes of the injection nozzle and the other is from fuel premixed to leaner than lean limit conditions. Reduction of sac volume and reduction of ignition delay are effective in reducing the HC from the sac volume and lean limit sources respectively. Developments in fuel injection equipment and engine design to reduce HC emissions are outlined. 1977 SA E Transactions 770260. Repeatability of Setup and Stability of Anthro- pometric Landmarks and Their Influence on Impact Response of Automotive Crash Test Dummies. S. Backaitis, National Highway Traf- fic Safety Admin.; and E. Enserink, Dynamic Sciences. Dummy positioning repeatability, dynamic stability dur- ing runup to crash speeds and the sensitivity of dummy crash response were investigated using precision (forced indexing) and conventional (self-centering) setup pro- cedures. The static repeatability and dynamic stability tests were performed in ten domestic and imported production vehicles. The sensitivity of dummy response to setup methods was investigated in sled tests. Test results indicate that the precision procedure causes higher levels of static dispersion and dynamic instability of anthro- pometric landmarks of dummies setup in production vehicles and only marginally improved dummy response in the HI-G sled environment. 770261. Performance Evaluation of Three New-Genera- tion Anthropomorphic Test Dummies. Daniel E. Massing, Calspan Corp. The performance characteristics of three advanced 50th percentile male anthropomorphic test dummy designs 52</page><page sequence="38">770262 - 770266 were quantitatively evaluated. Statistical analyses of replicate measurements of dummy accelerations and restraint system loads taken in four sled test environments simulating typical belt, air bag, and vehicle interior configurations revealed the following: (1) The degree of response repeatability of a particular dummy is both test-configuration and measured-variable dependent; (2) The means of certain responses of a pair of identically manufactured dummies were significantly different, while the variances of the respective means were statistically similar; and (3) No one dummy design demonstrated best repeatability characteristics across all test configurations and measured-response variables. 770262. Dummy Design and Reaction at Impact Simu- lation. V. S. Gersbach and P. M. MÃ¼sseier, Bayerische Motoren Werke AG. The influence of neck flexibility of the Hybrid-II-dummy on the Head Injury Criterion is investigated by means of sled tests. HIC-values were found to increase significantly with decreasing neck stiffness. Furthermore, characteristic properties of this dummy type with regard to reproducibility and durability are discussed; kinematic properties of spine and rib cage are compared with the human equivalents. Finally, adjustability of this dummy type and various test methods, especially neck tests, are closely examined. Proposals for certain improvements are made. 770263. A Survey Concerning the Quality of Part 572 Hybrid II Dummies as Measuring Instruments for Crash Testing. O. George G. O'Connell, Motor Industry Research Association (England); and Rune Almqvist, AB Volvo Car Division (Sweden). Two Part 572 Hybrid II dummies, of different manu- facture, were subjected to a programme of testing work in order to evaluate deviation factors which can be accorded to various injury criteria and other measurements deter- mined using this type of dummy. The programme at two testing facilities consisted of a total of ten series of dummy component calibration tests according to CFR49-Part 572 and four series of six nominally identical system sled tests. On the basis of the work carried out deviation factors within a thirty per cent band could be accorded to the important injury criteria and measurements. 770264. Review of Target Discrimination Techniques for Automotive Radar Applications. Robert M. Stor- wick, General Motors Res. Labs, General Mo- tors Technical Center. A major stumbling block in the development of auto- motive radar systems is the problem of target discrim- ination, the need to distinguish among targets. This capability is required before a radar system can determine whether a target is sufficiently hazardous to require that action be taken. Discrimination is generally accomplished through target signature analysis. This paper is concerned with the makeup of a radar signature arid how. its various components may be used to accomplish target discrimination, based on information derivable from radar signals. For example, target trajec- tory information in a radar signal can be useful in determining whether the object presents a possible safety hazard. Following this initial screening, the radar signal can be further processed in order to produce target identification and/or degree of hazard information. Depending on the type of radar system operation, e.g., continuous wave (CW) or pulsed, different types and amounts of information can be derived regarding a target. This paper reviews the most promising current techniques which will possibly provide target discrimination, as well as some techniques presently under development. 770265. Results from a Collisions Avoidance Radar Brak- ing System Investigation. William C. Troll and Richard E. Wong, Research Labs, The Bendix Corp.; and Yung Kuang Wu, U.S. Dept. of Transportation. Results of previous studies have indicated that an automatic/noncooperative radar braking system may provide a significant benefit in preventing accidents that may otherwise be caused by driver inattention or tardy driver response. However, one of the major technical problem areas in implementing the automatic/non- cooperative radar brake system is in achieving sufficient target discrimination. This is necessary to allow rejection of non-hazardous objects and to maintain a sufficiently low false alarm rate while retaining recognition capability on all potential hazards. This paper presents the results of an experimental and computer simulation study conducted to resolve the effects of the various system parameters which may be significant to the target recognition problem. The target discrimination experimental study was conducted using an instrumented test vehicle equipped with an automat- ic/noncooperative radar braking system to gather para- metric data under typical traffic conditions. The test courses selected for the experiments typify much of the high density, high speed, urban and suburban driving in the United States. The sensitivities of the various radar brake system parameters are also discussed. This work was sponsored by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the U. S. Department of Transpor- tation. 1977 SA E Transactions 770266. An Assessment of the Accident Avoidance and Severity Reduction Potential of Radar Warning, Radar Actuated, and Anti-Lock Braking Systems. Nicholas S. Tumbas, John R. Treat and Stephen T. McDonald, Institute for Research in Public Safety, Indiana Univ. A group of 215 in-depth accident reports prepared as part of a tri-level accident causation study by a multi- disciplinary team was examined to assess the benefit 53</page><page sequence="39">770267 - 770275 derived from the hypothetical application of various combinations of radar warning, radar actuated, and anti-lock braking systems. The approach was to have an accident analyst evaluate post hoc the benefit which would have been derived if one or more of the vehicles involved in each accident had been equipped with various types and combinations of these hypothetical systems; ten system types or combinations were defined. On one extreme, it was found that two-wheel anti-lock systems, by themselves, had relatively little accident prevention potential; only one of the 215 accidents (0.5%) would definitely have been prevented by such a system, although with less assurance there was some possibility or preven- tion of up to eight accidents (3.7%). On the other extreme, the most complex of the systems defined, comprised of a non-cooperative radar system with both actuation and warning potential, coupled with a four-wheel anti-lock system, would definitely have prevented 39 of these accidents (18.0%), with some possibility of prevention of up to 90 accidents (41.9% of those examined). 1977 SA E Transactions 770267. Microcomputer Controlled Radar and Display System for Cars. E. Belohoubek, J. Cusack, J. Risko and J. Rosen, RCA Labs, David Sarnoff Research Center. An experimental, non-cooperative automotive radar has been developed for collision mitigation and automatic headway control. The FM/CW radar is interfaced with a microcomputer to aid in the elimination of false alarms and handle the braking, warning, and headway control algorithms. A single-line, self-scan plasma display together with a series of sensors is also interfaced with the on-board computer to provide normal driving related information and warning messages in case of malfunc- tions in the car. 1977 SA E Transactions 770268. Aluminum in Automobile Bumper Systems. David E. Hatch, Reynolds Metals Co. The purpose of this paper is to discuss aluminum as a material in automobile bumper systems that must comply with FMVSS 215, Part 581. Design concepts, alloy consideration, structural design analysis, extrusion design, fabrication and finishing of aluminum in bumper systems are considered. 770269. Structural Design Considerations for Aluminum Bumpers. M. L. Sharp, R. M. Peters and R. B. Weiss, Aluminum Co. of America. The 1980 requirements for bumpers limit the damage that may be sustained in 8 km/h (5 mph) pendulum and barrier impacts. This paper covers four items of interest for design of one-piece aluminum bumpers: (1) properties of alloys, (2) dent resistance, (3) beam strength, (4) relative behavior of aluminum and steel. Static and dynamic tests are used to define the effects of yield strength and thickness on denting. Finite element calculations agree well with the results of dynamic bending tests of bumpers. Data presented also show that the strain rates during beam bending are low. Relative weights of aluminum and steel bumpers are defined. 1977 SA E Transactions 770270.

On the Combined Effects of Tread Element Flexibility and Pavement Microtexture on Thin Film Wet Traction. S. M. Rohde, Research Labs, General Motors Corp. Classical models of the thin film wet traction problem have considered the tire tread element to be rigid and the pavement to be smooth. Recently an analysis was developed which relaxed the rigid plate assumption and was applied to the thin film wet traction problem. It was shown there that the rigid plate model was inadequate. The effect of microtexture on thin film wet traction was also studied assuming a rigid tread element. The effect of microtexture was shown to be significant. In the present study both the effect of a deformable tread element and that of pavement microtexture are included. The relative importance of these effects is discussed. 1977 SA E Transactions 770278. Design of Tire Tread Elements for Optimum Thin Film Wet Traction. Alan L. Browne and Donald Whicker, Engineering Mechanics Dept., General Motors Research Laboratories. In the present paper, flexible tread element squeeze film analysis is applied to the design of individual tread elements for optimum thin film wet traction. In particular, the effects of tread element shape and dimensions, tread element wear, and the elastic modulus of the tread rubber compound on the rate of fluid film penetration are presented and discussed. The changes suggested herein are made solely on the basis of thin film wet traction - their effect on other important performance variables such as tire noise and wear has not been evaluated, which evaluation is an essential aspect of the total tire design process. 1977 SA E Transactions 770279. Rating Tire Traction Effectiveness in the Winter Environment. J. E. Footit, Armstrong Rubber Co. Requirements for meaningful winter environment traction standards continue to increase. The basic definition of, and continued justification for, special design winter tires intended for improved traction on ice and snow covered roads should be dependent on performance standards. State of the art test procedures and test conditions are reviewed for merit and potential improvement. Specific techniques and controls are recommended to limit the excessive variation inherent in most winter environment tire testing. Performance comparisons are made for special design winter tires versus conventional highway tires under several test conditions and test procedures to illustrate areas of performance differences. 770280. Some UK Progress in Sodium Sulphur Tech- nology. G. R. Lomax, Chloride Silent Power Ltd. This paper describes some progress made in the UK on sodium sulphur cells designed for motive power appli- cations. This is an area where compatibility with vehicle design imposes design constraints on the cell. The state of the art of the cell components are reviewed. Most of the design problems associated with the sodium electrode have been solved. Electrolyte 33 mm dia and over 500 mm long can now be produced and the strength and conduc- tivity can be controlled. Factors controlling the re- chargeability of the sulphur electrode have been studied and 90% capacity retention has been achieved for 8000 hours without any deterioration of performance. A 100 Ahr cell has completed 60 charge discharge cycles without any significant deterioration of performance. 770281. A New Design for the High-Performance So- dium-Sulfur Battery.

The Effect of Boundary Layer Changes Due to Transient Heat Transfer on the Performance of an Axial-Flow Air Compressor. N. R. L. Mac- callum, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Univ. of Glasgow (Scotland); and A. D. Grant, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Univ. of Strathclyde (Scot- land). During transient operation of a gas turbine there are significant heat transfers between the fluid stream and the blades of the compressor and turbine. At the end of a rapid deceleration from maximum speed to idling speed, heat transfer to the compressor blade boundary layers may cause sufficient disturbance to delay any immediate reacceleration. As a first estimate in one severe case - at altitude in an aircraft engine of compression ratio 20 - the surge margin prior to the re-acceleration is reduced by about 40% due to boundary layer effects, and by a further 25% due to "bulk" heat transfer. 1977 SA E Transactions 770285.

The Application of Corrosion Principles to En- gineering Design. Leonard C. Rowe, Physical Chemical Dept., Research Labs, General Motors Corp. To minimize corrosion of a multi-metal assembly, it is necessary to understand the basic corrosion processes that produce certain types of corrosion and recognize the factors that affect the rate of corrosion. Once this is understood, the information is applied to all phases of design engineering, including materials selection, methods of prevention, and physical design. The final step must be the determination of the feasibility of the proposed engineering design. This discussion deals with each of these specific areas that make up the total design. 1977 SA E Transactions 770293. A Perspective on the Retardation of Degradation in Polymeric Materials.

Managed Secondary Air - A Means of Achieving Sulfate Emission Control with Catalyst Equipped Vehicles. L. Hideg, E. M. Hoyt, J. H. Jones and C. E. Zakrajsek, Engineering and Research Staff, Ford Motor Company. Similar to three way catalysts (TWC), conventional oxidation catalysts (COC) have a "control window" with respect to inlet 02 concentrations. Within this window, which is bordered on one side by poor HC/CO efficiency and low sulfate formation and on the other side by good HC/CO efficiency and high sulfate formation, is a region offering simultaneous control of HC, CO and sulfates. Starting with an advanced emission control system, which incorporates a TWC with an 02 sensor and closed loop feedback control of the air-fuel ratio (A/F) followed by a COC with secondary air addition for adequate control of HC and CO, an additive control system has been designed which maintains a constant 02 level at the inlet of the oxidation catalyst. With the nearly constant composition of the exhaust gases of an engine with stoichiometric A/F control, the quantity of secondary air addition required to achieve this constant 02 level is a linear function of engine air flow. Using inputs of manifold absolute pressure (MAP) and engine speed, an electric motor servo control system was designed to control the flow of secondary air to the oxidation catalyst on a 2.3 liter, standard transmission vehicle. Exhaust emission and sulfate results of the 3,000 lb. vehicle are presented, respectively, for the CVS-C/H and the Congested Freeway Driving Schedule (CFDS) test procedures. Details of the electronic servo control system are included. 770297. Fundamental Study of Oxidation in a Lean Thermal Reactor. Yasuo Sakai, Yasuhiko Naka- gawa, Shoji Tange and Ryuzaburo Maruyama, Central Engineering Laboratories, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan). The oxidation mechanism in a lean thermal reactor was studied with a number of basic experiments. It depends neither on engine speed nor airflow rate, but only on the residence time of the gas. It was shown that in a lean thermal reactor CO first increases by an HC-&gt;CO reaction and then decreases by a CO-&gt;C02 reaction. The effect of NO on oxidation was also studied, and it was concluded that oxidation is affected by NO and that there exists a certain NO concentration which most accelerates oxidation. 770298. A Three- Way Catalytic Muffler Using Progres- sive Air Injection for Automotive Exhaust Gas Purification. M. Prigent, B. Raynal and P. Courty, SociÃ©tÃ© Procatalyse, Institut FranÃ§ais du PÃ©trole. The present paper shows that the simultaneous removal with a single catalytic muffler of the three types of pollutants (NO, CO and HC) is possible without requiring a very precise adjustment of the engine equivalence ratio or permanent control of the supply of secondary air added ahead of the muffler. The system studied consists of a muffler in which secondary air is supplied from a plurality of points located within the catalyst bed itself in order to have an oxygen concentration in the treated gas that increases progres- sively between the inlet and the outlet. Experimental muffler designs are presented for mono- lithic or bead-type catalysts. The numerous advantages of this technique as com- pared with the well-known dual bed system are described. It is in particular shown that the NO reduction rate is increased on precious metal catalysts when oxygen is added to some extent in a reducing exhaust gas, with maximum efficiency being reached just below the stoi- chiometric proportion. Ammonia formation due to the presence of oxygen is also reduced in the first part of the catalytic bed, and its reoxidation in the oxidizing section is directed toward N2 formation since oxygen is only in large excess near the outlet. The results of several tests made on an engine bench, show that the ratio between the flow of exhaust gas and secondary air may vary widely with little change in the efficiency of the muffler. Some data obtained on a vehicle, using the CVS procedure, confirm these results. 770299. Metal Supported Catalysts for Automotive Ap- plications. C. A. Dulieu, W. D. J. Evans, R. J. Larbey, A. M. Verrall and A. J. J. Wilkins, Johnson Matthey Chemicals Ltd.; and J. H. Povey, Matthey Bishop, Inc. The development of a novel precious metal catalyst system supported on a metal substrate is outlined. The key nature of the metallic species is demonstrated. A high performance alloy, FECRALLOY STEELÂ®, is identified as a suitable material. Conversion of this alloy into a durable catalyst using a proprietary pre-treatment to render it compatible with existing catalysts and production procedures is discussed. The flexibility in processing with respect to key design features e.g. cell density, is emphasised. The influence of support variables such as volume, cell density etc., on the performance of an oxidation catalyst is reported together with comparable data for ceramic supported catalystÄ It is shown that at zero hours, equivalent performance, at no power loss penalty relative to ceramics, can be secured by judicious choice of cell density /volume combinations. Such equivalence can be achieved with significantly lower volumes and significant scope exists for further optimisation. The key role of cell density in this 57</page><page sequence="43">770300 - 770307 respect is identified and an optimum value in the region of 500 cells per square inch is indicated. Durability data is reported for various concepts and it is demonstrated that equivalence to ceramics can be achieved at extended operating periods over small vol- umes of metal substrates. The equivalence of two support types is established, one of which offers a significant reduction in the weight of FecralloyÂ® Steel used per unit volume and, therefore, in the material cost. 770300. Development of a Lean Burn/Lean Reactor Engine System Through the Application of En- gine Dynamometer Mapping Techniques. R. C. Meier, Ford Motor Co. Various components designed to extend the lean misfire limit and control exhaust emissions of a 4 cylinder engine were evaluated at important CVS speed/load points on an engine dynamometer. The components studied included: modified intake manifold, thermal reactors, exhaust port liners, and a modified combustion chamber. Oxidation studies were conducted to determine the effect of exhaust reactor size on the conversion of HC and CO emissions at lean engine A/F ratios. An experimental technique was developed which permits an assessment of CVS-HOT emissions/fuel economy and driveability char- acteristics from steady-state engine dynamometer data. The effects of ignition timing and EGR were investigated at lean engine A/F ratios to provide lean burn/lean reactor system calibrations for low emissions potential and maximum fuel economy. 770301. A Characterization of Exhaust Emissions from Lean Burn, Rotary, and Stratified Charge En- gines. Peter A. Gabele, James N. Braddock and Ronald L. Bradow, Environmental Protection Agency. This paper reports the results of an exhaust emissions characterization from the noncatalyst control systems employed on the Mazda RX-4 rotary, the Honda CVCC, and the Chrysler electronic lean burn. Throughout the paper, exhaust emissions from these vehicles are com- pared to those from a Chrysler equipped with an oxidation catalyst and an air pump. The emissions characterized are carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, sulfates, hydrogen sulfide, carbonyl sulfide, hydrogen cyanide, aldehydes, particulate matter, and detailed hydrocarbons. A brief description of the sampling and analysis procedures used is included within the discussion. 770303. Development and Evaluation of Aluminum Body Sheet Metal Panels. R. C. Eissinger, N. H. Jewell and J. L. Livermore, Ford Motor Com- pany. A developmental approach was adopted to establish aluminum as a viable body sheet material for vehicle weight reduction. Initially, both the material advantages of aluminum, as well as certain limiting factors for automotive processing were recognized. A major plant trial was conducted and methods of resolving both functional and processing issues evolved. The in-plant tryout and subsequent field evaluation of hood panels produced useful information on forming, welding, metal finishing and painting as well as appearance and func- tional elements pertinent to product field performance. Panels from this trial were evaluated at intervals during two years of exposure to demanding field conditions. During this same period laboratory efforts resolved remaining, less-critical issues. 770304. Bimetallic Aluminum/Steel Auto Body Panels. Michael A. Glagola, Reynolds Metals Co. This paper discusses the problems associated with alu- minum/steel bimetallic panels such as warping in paint bake cycles, paint peeling and other corrosion effects. Several joining methods used for bimetallic assemblies, such as stapling, adhesive bonding and spot welding are presented. Corrosion test data is presented to indicate the favorable and unfavorable reactions of different paint systems and to compare the different joining procedures used on the bimetallic aluminum/steel panels. 770305. Resistance Welding Aluminum for Automotive Production. W. Dilay, E. A. Rogala and E. J. Zulinski, Ford Motor Co. Serious pitfalls exist in assuming that aluminum can be reliably resistance spot welded in the "as received" mill finish or even in the chemically cleaned condition. A commercially feasible surface abrading process was developed to promote reliability with existing tooling even 90 days afterwards. A weld reliability procedure was developed to evaluate process variables, various surface treatments, electrode materials and geometry. Comparative merits of AC and DC power were investigated. With the advent of abraded surfaces, aluminum can now be resistance spot welded with confidence and the dreaded fast electrode fauling condition associated with mill finish surfaces can be substantially alleviated. 770306. Application of Aluminum in Body Weight Reduc- tion. M. B. Motwani, Ford Motor Co. This paper is a general review of the successful conversion of steel hood floors to aluminum. The function of different load floor components is discussed. Design analysis for bending strength, bending stiffness and dent resistance is evaluated. Test results of aluminum and steel parts are compared. And manufacturing considerations and different joining methods are discussed. 770307. New 6XXX-Series Alloys for Auto Body Sheet. J. W. Evancho and J. G. Kaufman, Aluminum Company of America. Two new aluminum alloys, 6009 and 6010, for auto body sheet are described and technical data are presented. The 6XXX-series alloys are ideal for body sheet in several 58</page><page sequence="44">770308-770315 respects, providing excellent corrosion resistance, im- proved spot weldability, and freedom from Luder's lines, together with favorable response to aging in many paint bake cycles. The result is a combination of excellent formability in the T4 temper and, after aging, higher strength than achievable in any other aluminum alloy system having other characteristics desired in body sheet. The latter translates to excellent dent resistance, superior even to that of steel. Furthermore, scrap loop problems are eliminated; compatible alloys 6009 and 6010 may be used together to obtain optimum strength and formability without any penalties in scrap utilization. Forming, aging, finishing, and joining data for these alloys are presented. 770308. Davisorb Bumpers Reduce Weight and Damage. Peter A. Weiler and Jerry V. Scrivo, Davidson Rubber Co., Inc.

The principal features such as improvement in damage resistance, weight reduction, styling freedom and reduction in component parts are described in detail. A design section provides information for application of urethane bumpers to specific vehicles. 770310. Sports Cars - The Quantitative Difference. John Dinkel, Road &amp; Track. The evolution of sports cars and their performance characteristics in the last 30 years is traced with emphasis upon how they have altered in relation to other types of cars. Their relevancy as a mode of transportation in the 1980's and 1990's is also explored on the basis of past and current design and changing driving conditions. 770311. The Porsche 924 Body - Main Development Objectives. Hermann E. Burst and Rainer Srock, Research and Development Center, Porsche AG. Functional design through aerodynamics, secondary safety, corrosion resistance, repairability, economic pro- duction and operation - such are the critical points to be observed during today's body development. The Porsche 924 realises these requirements by assuring simultaneously a high degree of functionality and economy. 770312. A New Image of a Mid-Engined Sports Car-the Lancia Beta Scorpion. S. Camuffo, Lancia S.p.A.; and L. Fioravanti, Pininfarina S.p.A. The fundamental theme characterizing the conception of the Lancia Beta Scorpion is the mid-ship location of its engine. In addition to affording sports car performance and handling, which this solution enhances, the Scorpion had to be perfectly adapted to everyday use. Namely, it had to meet all those requirements which, though conflicting with the mid-engine configuration, are today demanded also by the owner of high performance sports cars. The Beta Scorpion is Lancia's and Pininfarina's innovative response to this complex problem, the car having original styling, with a distinct personality, which sets a new image of an all-round mid-engined sports car. 770313. A Study of the Effect of Oil and Coolant Temperatures on Diesel Engine Brake Specific Fuel Consumption. David A. Bolis, John H. Johnson and Richard Callen, Michigan Tech- nological University. Diesel engine fuel consumption is mainly a function of engine component design and power requirements. How- ever, fuel consumption can also be affected by the environment in which the engine operates. This paper considers two controlling parameters of the engine's thermal environment, oil temperature and coolant tem- perature. The effects of oil and coolant temperatures on Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC) are established for a turbocharged diesel engine. Data are also presented for a direct injection, naturally aspirated diesel engine. A matrix of test conditions was run on a Cummins VT-903 diesel engine to evaluate the effects of oil and coolant temperatures on BSFC for several loads and speeds. Loads and speeds were selected based on where a typical semi-tractor engine would operate over the road on a hills and curves route. Oil temperature was mon- itored and controlled between the oil cooler and the engine. Coolant temperature was monitored and con- trolled at the engine outlet. The BSFC data were fit to a regression equation as a function of load, speed, oil temperature and coolant temperature for the matrix of test conditions. The test results showed that BSFC decreases as both oil and coolant temperatures increase. The results also indicate that BSFC was more sensitive to changes in oil temperature than to changes in coolant temperature over the range of the test data. 770314. Considerations in Redesigning a Gasoline Engine into a Diesel Engine for Passenger Car Service. K. Haefele, Adam Opel AG. Conversion of an automotive production line from manufacture of gasoline engines to manufacture of diesel engines requires redesign of many component parts if the diesel engine is to provide good performance. Factors to be considered in this redesign and the design solutions that were developed for a successful production line conversion at Adam Opel AG are discussed. These include ways to improve critical engine parts, such as crankshaft, connecting rods, cylinder head bolts, camshaft drive, within the existing manufacturing limitations. 770315. Potential Passenger Car Demand for Diesel Fuel and Refining Implications. E. G. Barry, A. Ramella and R. B. Smith, Mobil Research and Development Corp. Development and efficient utilization of our natural 59</page><page sequence="45">770316-770321 energy resources are receiving national attention. One major user of energy is the transportation industry. In 1975, the United States Government enacted the Energy Policy and Conservation Act which has a section aimed at improving automobile efficiency. One approach being considered to reduce passenger car energy demand is the use of diesel engines instead of gasoline engines. This paper presents the results of a study exploring the potential passenger car demand for diesel fuel and the implication of this demand on the petroleum industry processing requirements. In addition, an evaluation of the relative economy, performance and emissions of diesel- powered cars versus gasoline-powered cars is presented. An estimate of the net energy utilization in terms of both miles traveled per barrel of crude and crude savings for various degrees of diesel engine penetration in the automobile market is given. For example, if in the distant future diesels comprise 35-40% of the car population, there could be a 9-10% increase in passenger car mileage at constant crude oil consumption or a 3 1/2-4% reduction in crude oil usage at constant passenger car mileage. It is also noted that the refining industry will incur costs associated with the shift to processing larger quantities of diesel fuel and that this may result in a reduction in the current cost advantage of diesel fuel compared to gasoline. 1977 SA E Transactions 770316. Diesel Fuel Properties and Engine Performance. F. J. Hills, Mobil Res. &amp; Dev. Corp.; and C. G. Schleyerbach, Mobil Oil A.G. It may be necessary to increase the percentage yield of diesel fuel from crude oil to meet demands if diesel powered passenger cars achieve increased sales penetra- tion. To assess the performance properties of products that might be produced to meet this increased demand, tests were conducted with diesel fuels of varying 10% recovered point (365Â°-520Â°F) (185-271 Â°C), 95% re- covered point (520Â°-750Â°F) (271-399Â°C) and aromatics content (15-40%) in U.S. and European light- and heavy-duty engines. The effects on emissions, power and fuel consumption were relatively small indicating that fuels within the range tested provide satisfactory per- formance. 770317. Changing Face of C. B. Gary L. Wilhelm, E.F. Johnson Co. From a slow start in 1958, Class D Citizens Band has grown to represent one of the largest segments of todays consumer electronics market. The important trends in 27 MHz C.B. are discussed with particular emphasis on the effects of new technology now being applied in C.B. transceiver design. This paper reviews the past, concen- trates on present developments, and attempts to look into the future. 770318. CB Radio for Highway Safety Communications. Gerald H. Reese, REACT International, Inc. Current and future programs using two-way radio for highway safety communications are reviewed. The dra- matic growth of CB from 2 1/2 million to 20 million radios in use from 1970 to 1977 is attributed in large measure to motorists' desire for communications. Poten- tial savings in lives, property and conservation of fuel through reduced reporting time are achieved through CB radio emergency monitoring programs. Review of Ohio REACT program, MEP REACT in Detroit, Missouri Highway Patrol experience and the NEAR (National Emergency Aid Radio) program by NHTSA are included. 770319. Matching CB Equipment to the Vehicle Envi- ronment. Hugo Korn, Automotive Products Div., Motorola, Inc. The design of a Citizens Band radio system for a vehicle is a series of compromises due to the interaction between the CB equipment and its environment. The designer of the CB equipment and the designer of the system, whether vehicle manufacturer or installer, share a responsibility to consider these interactive effects to assure maximum operator acceptance. This paper will consider the inter- active effects of the atmospheric environment, mechanical considerations, vehicle power supply, electrical transients, equipment security, operator interface, electromagnetic radiation and legislation upon the design of CB trans- ceivers and their installation in the vehicle. 770320. Castings - A Better Use of Lightweight Metals? Joseph E. Hunter, General Motors Research Laboratories. In comparing the use of cast and wrought aluminum to reduce vehicle weight and energy consumption, cast aluminum is generally regarded as less energy intensive based on the extensive use of secondary aluminum in castings. Cast aluminum also offers potentially larger direct weight savings than wrought aluminum. However, increased use of aluminum in either cast or wrought form will require that the added demand be matched by a corresponding increase in primary aluminum production. Further, virtually all potential casting applications are in chassis parts which will generally yield lesser indirect weight savings than upper body applications of wrought aluminum. Despite these limiting factors, the substitution of cast aluminum for cast iron appears to compare favorably with the replacement of steel by wrought aluminum on the basis of general estimates of energy savings. In particular, the selective use of cast aluminum to reduce the weight of optional engines may offer opportunities to maximize weight and energy saving per unit of substitute material used. 770321. Reducing Automotive Weight with Thin Wall Zinc. Dale C. H. Nevison, Zinc Institute, Inc. The automotive industry is under pressure to meet fuel economy regulations in the future. Smaller and lighter weight cars are inevitable. Designing smaller cars is well underway. Material selection is not as clear-cut. 60</page><page sequence="46">770322 - 770328 Lightweight materials may or may not prove better than effective utilization of materials and processes currently used. The choice between "light-weight", e.g., plastic and "heavy" materials, e.g., zinc is evaluated by comparing plastic injection moldings and thin wall zinc die casting. The term "thin wall," when applied to zinc die castings is used to identify minimum wall thicknesses that will do the job required. 770322. Aluminum Lightweight Castings - Some Cost- Saving Ideas. John L. Jorstad, Reynolds Metals Co. Aluminum castings have much to offer the automotive industry in terms of weight reduction and energy savings. Their long-term acceptability can only be assured, however, by applying the most cost-effective combina- tions of material and processing. This paper will point out some "cost-saving" opportunities in two basic areas: (1) The use of hypereutectic aluminum-silicon alloys to eliminate a need for ferrous wear-surface inserts, to reduce machining capital expenditures and to reduce overall part weight; and (2) The use of two processing methods, "Pore-Free" die casting and "low-pressure" casting, to produce aluminum parts with minimum metal usage and energy consumption. 770323. Magnesium: A Proven Material for Light Weight Automotive Die Castings. Stephen C. Erickson, Dow Chemical. Die castings made from light weight magnesium alloys have excellent mechanical properties and can be substi- tuted for heavier materials of construction to reduce the weight of functional components. New developments in the areas of fluxless melting and hot chamber die casting have brought significant cost reductions to the processing of magnesium die castings and have made them compet- itive with die castings of other materials. With their proven record of serviceability in automotive applications, and with an excellent supply of alloy for new applications, magnesium die castings offer the automotive engineer an outstanding means to meet the challenge of vehicle weight reduction. 1977 SAE Transactions 770324. The Delco Remy Freedom Battery. J. L. Helms and J. H. Coyner, Delco Remy Division, Gen- eral Motors Corp.; and C. W. Hill, Chevrolet Motor Div., General Motors Corp. The Dplco Remy Freedom Battery introduces a new generation of automotive batteries that are completely independent of owner care. Described are new materials, chemistry and manufacturing processes used to produce a battery that is highly efficient and completely mainte- nance free. Characteristics of the battery permit installation in today's underhood environments, plus new flexibility for remote mounting. Improved strength and lower weight eliminate many battery handling problems during assem- bly. In the aftermarket, acid filling and associated OSHA requirements are eliminated. Improved stand character- istics permit long shelf life without deterioration. Car owners are set free from concern with battery mainte- nance, provided plenty of cold weather starting power and assured high resistance to heat and vibration damage. 770325. Battery Plate Connection in SLI Batteries. Addison M. Howard, Automotive Div., Chloride Inc. The evolution of plate burning and cell interconnection of SLI batteries is followed from the older antimony lead batteries to the newer maintenance free batteries.

Water loss comparisons will be drawn between calcium- lead Maintenance Free batteries, standard antimonial lead batteries, and low antimony batteries at 80Â° F and at elevated temperatures. Gassing comparisons will also be made between these basic alloy systems at various stages of SAE J240A cycle life. Gassing characteristics of the three systems will also be explored at various states of charge. 1977 SAE Transactions 770327. The Chrysler Long Life Battery Concept. C. J. VanHalteren, Chrysler Corp. The Chrysler Long Life Battery Concept Paper covers the establishing of the causes for batteries being removed from service, the determination of the cause for removal and the design changes in the battery and its electrical and thermal environment to create the Long Life Battery Concept. The test shows the importance of controlling the vehicle environment as well as the battery construction in accomplishing the goal. 770328. New Rating Standards for Automotive Batteries. Roger L. Bennett, Electrical and Electronics Div., Ford Motor Co. The Battery Subcommittee of the SAE Electrical Equip- ment Committee has developed new standards for rating automotive batteries. The need for the new ratings and their advantages over the former ratings are discussed along with the new "Reserve Capacity", "Cold Cranking" and "Life Test" test procedures. These new standards closely simulate actual operating conditions in today's cars and their adoption will allow the battery suppliers increased design flexibility. 61</page><page sequence="47">770331 -770338 770331. Critical Review of the State-of-the-Art in the Tire Force and Moment Measurements. Walter Berg- man, Ford Motor Co. This paper critically reviews the state of the art of measurements of tire force and moment properties in steady state and transient conditions and analyzes certain controversial factors influencing these properties. It shows that testing at unrealistically low speeds affects tire force and moment measurement at least as much as drum curvature. Tire measurements are also significantly influ- enced by characteristics of the test equipment. Forces and moments acting on the tire change tire elastic porperties, however, these properties restore themselves after the tire "rests". The paper shows that vehicle responses in transient steer maneuvers are strongly influenced by transient tire properties. It was demonstrated that, by using a transient tire model in simulation of vehicle transient responses, the sideslip response time was increased by 32 percent over its value determined by using a steady state tire model. In the low frequency range prevailing during rapid steering maneuvers, transient tire properties are characterized by a dynamic lateral force offset. 1977 SA E Transactions 770332. Generation of Camber Forces. F. J. Winsor, Chrysler Corp. The bias tire is modelled as an elastically-supported ring in order to study its lateral deflection characteristics. The elastic properties of cord/rubber laminates imply that circumferential stiffness of the sidewall should be included in a lateral deformation model of the bias tire. The relatively large camber stiffness of bias as compared to radial tires is explained in terms of the variation in rolling radius that occurs across the tread width of the bias tire when it is inclined. 1977 SA E Transactions 770333. The Effect of a Tire's Reinforcing Material on Rolling Resistance. P. D. Shepherd, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. The need for fuel conservation has caused increased interest in the rolling resistance and fuel consumption of tires. A study to determine the effect of the tire's fabric reinforcing system, both belt and carcass, on rolling resistance and fuel consumption is described and its results are presented. 770334. Application of Performance and Reliability Con- cepts to the Design of Ceramic Regenerators. J. A. Cook, C. A. Fucinari and C. J. Rahnke, Ford Motor Co. Four regenerator matrix samples, fabricated by different manufacturing methods and consisting of different ce- ramic materials and cell geometries, were studied to determine their reliability and performance potential in a typical industrial gas turbine engine. Hypothetical re- generators were designed from these matrix samples to give identical engine performance, and the thermal stress was determined for each. In some instances, it was necessary to stress relieve and preload the rims in order to reduce the thermal stresses so that acceptable reliability could be obtained. The four hypothetical regenerators were then compared on the basis of size, cost, leakage, etc., so that the advantages of each configuration could be observed. The performance and reliability analysis was based on Ford Motor Company's shuttle rig performance tests and over 200,000 core-hours of engine test on ceramic regenerators. The engine test program is described in detail. 1977 SA E Transactions 770335. Fabricating of Dense Silicon Nitride Parts by Hot Isostatic Pressing. Hans Larker, Jan Adlerborn and Hans Bohman, ASEA (Sweden). Concerning the fabrication of advanced components of dense silicon nitride, many methods of approach have been reported on in literature. To date, none of these attempts for the fabrication of turbine rotors has been considered feasible. The HIP process, it is believed, can offer an eco- nomically viable solution for fabrication of advanced ceramic components when the following reasons are considered: a) hot isostatic pressing is a well established technique, b) dense silicon nitride can be produced without any additives, c) fully isotropic dense silicon nitride is achieved, d) no reaction with capsule material, e) high M.O.R. values at high temperatures, f) consistently high Weibull m-module. g) very high creep resistance. The HIP process implies that even monolithic turbine rotors can be fabricated to final shape. The principle of the HIP process allows production of a large number of components simultaneously, thus offering possibilities for economic production on a large scale. 770336. Design and Manufacturing Considerations for Aluminum Hood Assemblies. Thomas M. Finelli and Bruce G. Kelly, Oldsmobile Div., General Motors Corp. Aluminum stampings are being fabricated and assembled on the same production tooling used to manufacture steel components. This capability allows the utilization of an all aluminum hood assembly on "heavy" models and an identical all steel hood assembly on the balance of the car line. 1977 SA E Transactions 770338.

The M880 Series 1 1/4 Ton Commercial Truck System is the U.S. Army's first large scale project to selectively replace existing militarily designed tactical vehicles with 62</page><page sequence="48">770339 - 770347 commercial vehicles. This program was initiated under the guidance of the U.S. Army's Wheels Study (1971) which was a comprehensive analysis of the Army's management and utilization of wheeled vehicles and related equipment. To date, over 15,000 commercial 1 1/4 ton vehicles have been fielded worldwide to active army and foreign military sales customers with an additional 28,000 vehicles to be fielded during the remainder of 1977. The M880's are experiencing a high degree of acceptance by the using personnel. 770339. The New Xl 100 Automatic Transmissions for the XM1 Tank. J. W. Schmidt and G. L. Hadley, Detroit Diesel Allison Division of General Motors Corporation.

A modular design is utilized to provide application flexibility for diesel or turbine engines of 1300 to 1500 GHP, as well as adaption to the current M60 vehicle. This automatic transmission features a hydrostatic steer system with pivot steer, a four speed range pack, integral power brakes and a high speed reverse. The torque converter can be locked up in all gear ranges to provide optimum transmission performance. 770340. Landing Vehicle Assault (LVA). Edwin B. O'Neill, David W. Taylor Naval Ship Research &amp; Development Center. A new amphibian vehicle, Landing Vehicle Assault (LVA), is under development to replace the current Marine Corps LVTP-7. Contracts with Bell Aerospace, FMC Corporation, and Pacific Car and Foundry Com- pany have provided conceptual designs. These include planning/track and air cushion vehicle (ACV)/track hybrids. LVA will carry 25 to 34 troops at high speeds over-water (25 to 40 mph) and over-land (40 to 55 mph). Included in the development is a 1500 horsepower stratified-charge rotary combustion engine. Other hard- ware developments include experimental full-scale planing and ACV hydrodynamic vehicles and a lightweight aluminum track. 770341. The Prospects of Liquid Cooling for Turbines. David Japikse, Creare Inc. A critical assessment of the future of liquid cooling is presented. Following a careful comparison of advantages and disadvantages, the principal historical milestones in turbine liquid cooling research are reported. It is recog- nized that enhanced performance, improved design simplicity and reduced product cost must all be achieved if liquid cooling is to supplant competitive approaches. A design example for a 180 shp SGT, using a radial inflow turbine, is presented. The prospects for employing liquid cooling in future turbine designs are good, but compe- tition from alternative approaches is strong. 770342. Application of Ceramics to a Radial Inflow Gas Turbine. F. D. Jordan, US Army MERAD- COM, Electrical Power Lab; and J. C. Napier, A. G. Metcalfe and T. E. Duffy, Solar Div., International Harvester. A development program to increase erosion resistance, extend life, reduce component cost and increase power to weight ratio through the use of a ceramic turbine nozzle section in gas turbine engines is described. Results of engine simulator tests of an all-ceramic nozzle constructed with special relaxing high temperature adhesives are presented. 770343. Summary of NASA Research on Thermal-Barrier Coatings. Francis S. StÄpka, Curt H. Liebert and Stephan Stecura, NASA, Lewis Research Cen- ter. This paper summarizes the work conducted at the NASA Lewis Research Center to evolve and evaluate a two-layer, thermal-barrier coating system. A durable, two-layer, plasma-sprayed coating consisting of a ceramic layer over a metallic layer was developed that has the potential of insulating hot engine parts and thereby reducing metal temperatures and coolant flow requirements and/or permitting use of less costly and complex cooling configurations and materials. The investigations evaluated the reflective and insulative capability, microstructure, and durability of several coating materials on flat metal specimens, a combustor liner, and turbine vanes and blades. In addition, the effect on the aerodynamic performance of a coated turbine vane was measured. The tests were conducted in furnaces, cascades, hot-gas rigs, an engine combustor, and a research turbojet engine. Included also are summaries of current research related to the coating and potential applications for the coating. 1977 SA E Transactions 770344. Development Trends for Wrought High Temper- ature Turbine Rotors. Roy L. Athey and Joseph B. Moore, Pratt &amp; Whitney FRDC. The feasibility of producing high performance wrought integrally bladed turbine rotors from the strongest high temperature super-alloys on an economical basis has been demonstrated. Through the use of available advanced processing techniques, it is now possible to produce these rotors with an unprecedented combination of mechanical properties in the disk or rotor and blades. This technology base coupled with the potential for significant improve- ment in the high temperature capability of super-alloys in the next few years offers opportunities for super-alloy turbine rotors that could be competitive with first generation ceramic rotors. 1977 SA E Transactions 770347.

The Self-Supporting Tire: A New Concept in Vehicle Mobility. John T. Alden, The BF Goodrich Company. Elimination of the spare tire has long been a goal of the automotive industry. Providing vehicle mobility with only four tires, however, has been a very complex product design assignment for the tire industry. The four-tire system must be designed to perform satisfactorily in both the inflated and the uninflated modes, thus creating a whole new matrix of design/per- formance relationships. In developing such a totally-new tire/wheel system, testing procedures must be developed to evaluate design concepts, screen materials and establish product performance levels. This paper traces the evolution of a new tire system requiring only two components: a modified one-piece rim, and a specially-designed tire which structurally supports itself at zero inflation pressure. This paper also describes testing procedures during the program to screen design concepts and establish product performance levels. 770350. Runflat Stabilizer. L. Seelbach Kraft and G. Timothy Watts, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. A C-shaped fiberglass reinforced plastic runflat stabilizer has been developed that can be mounted around the wheel well inside an inflated tire. The stabilizer, along with its lubrication system, allows the driver to operate his vehicle despite zero air pressure in a flat tire. This eliminates the need for a spare tire, saves trunk space, reduces weight, and - most important - does away with the inconvenience and danger of roadside tire changing. 770352. A Feedback Controlled Carburetion System Using Air Bleeds. T. R. Gantzert, D. L. Hicks and M. A. Jefferis, Carter Carburetor Div., ACF Industries, Inc. A feedback controlled carburetion system has been developed that maintains a flow of exhaust gases of uniform composition. This is a requirement if three-way or dual bed catalytic converters are to be used in meeting projected emission standards. Exhaust gas uniformity depends upon delivery of a constant air-fuel ratio by the carburetor. Instead of metering fuel directly, Carter Carburetor finds that precise and responsive control of the air-fuel ratio is obtained by using variable air bleeds in the carburetor fuel circuits. 770354. Heat and Mixture Control for Gasoline Engines. Erik Kofoed, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg. Tech- nical Univ. of Denmark; and Flemming P. Greenfort, Elsinore Shipbuilding Co. By heating fuel-air mixtures to higher temperatures than usually employed in gasoline engines, it is possible to run the engine on lean mixtures. With regard to efficiency and air pollution, mixture and heat control can be considered as an alternative to stratified combustion in gasoline engines. 770355. Design of a Plasma Jet Ignition System for Automotive Application. J. R. Asik, P. PiÄt- kowski, M. J. Foucher and W. G. Rado, Ford Motor Co. The development of a plasma jet ignition system based on use of plasma jet spark plugs is described. Particular attention is given to systems design for automotive application. Design data for plasma jet spark plugs are given. Tests on a 37.3 CID single cylinder engine with vapor tank fuel metering indicate that plasma jet ignition produces extension of the lean misfire limit, reduction of ignition delay and burn time, higher NO, and increased torque compared to conventional ignition. Discussion of the electrical power requirements of a plasma jet ignition system is given. Operating experience for a four cylinder 2.3L test vehicle is described. 1977 SA E Transactions 770356. Electronically Controlled Engine Speed Govern- ing. W. L. Humbert, Chevrolet Motor Div., General Motors Corp.; and R. G. Kibler, AC Spark Plug Div., General Motors Corp. This paper describes the development and evaluation of an electronically controlled engine speed governor for use on gasoline engine Chevrolet and GMC medium- and heavy-duty trucks. An electronic controller monitors engine speed and operates a solenoid valve producing a tailored vacuum signal that controls throttle opening. The new governor system was evaluated with new and exacting definitions of spread, surge, overshoot, full load speed and reload. The electronic governor system shows driveability improvements over the old "spinner" system at slightly lower cost and improved durability. It also represents an industry "first" in the application of electronics to gasoline engine governors. 770357. Metrication of a Manufacturing Facility. David F. Vernon, Chevrolet Flint Engine Plant. With the decision in 1974 to build a U.S. version of the Chevette, various Chevrolet Manufacturing facilities launched extensive metric conversion programs. At the Flint Engine Plant, committees were established to solve metric related problems and to educate employees. Various manufacturing and engineering standards were reviewed and rewritten to incorporate metric related dimensioning. Production parts, tools, and machines, were identified for segregation with English parts. 64</page><page sequence="50">770358 - 770365 By using education, identification techniques, and a concerned effort by management, the metric system has become an integral part of one manufacturing facility. 770358. Metric Impact on Engineering Design and Man- ufacturing. Mohan N. Joshi, Wolf Detroit En- velope Co. With the passage of the Federal Metric Legislation it is no more the question, why metric, but how to go ahead with the metric system. It is fairly simple to postulate "what" objectives ought to be achieved during metric conversion, but it is more difficult to specify "how" this should be done. Emphasis has been placed throughout this paper on "how" rather than "why". The paper is divided in two sections. In the first section, in addition to considering the impact on product design and development, effect on engineering mathe- matics is studied. The second section discusses conversion of machine tools with emphasis on purchasing the equipment with capability of dual reading during the transition period. 770359. Metric Fastener Overview. S. E. Mallen, Metri- cation Planning Manager, Ford Motor Com- pany. "Metric Fastener Overview" explains some rationale for going metric in North America by describing activities of the ANSI sponsored special study to develop an Optimum Metric Fastener System and the results to date. Discussed are: fastener significance, diameter/pitch recommendations, thread forms, thread gaging, bolt head design, materials, metric identification, nut design, small screws, rivets, clearance holes, pipe threads, inspection and quality assurance, availability and selection, and potential value of a planned, coordinated changeover to using metric standards. 1977 SAE Transactions 770360. A Metric Engine Development Experience. Harold L. Brock, John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works. In order to implement a 1973 corporate directive for full conversion to SI units, each John Deere factory in North America established a pilot project which would involve adoption of the new measurement system and expose all areas of the operation to the need for bilingual capability. One of these projects - the metric development of a V-8 engine at the John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works - is described. 770361. UNIKOTE. Lowell W. Austin and Glenn W. Bush, National Steel Corp. Research Center. Unikote is a one-side coated hot-dipped galvanized steel made by combination of conventional hot-dip galvanizing with a subsequent electrolytic operation. One surface of the product offers the corrosion resistance of galvanized steel while the other surface offers the appearance and paintability of cold rolled steel. Unikote is more easily welded than regular galvanized steel. 770362. ZINCROMETAL: Its Manufacture, Testing, and Use. F. H. Guzzetta, Research Center, Armco Steel Corp. ZINCRONÃÃTAL usage in the automotive sector has increased rapidly since 1972. As one might expect, this has led to considerable interest in the details of producing this product. In order to fulfill this expressed need, a description of the manufacture of ZINCROMETAL is presented here. Since the process is inextricably involved with a variety of quality control and quality assurance testing procedures, they are incorporated into this paper also. Finally, a long but incomplete listing of parts where ZINCROMETAL has been applied in auto bodies is reviewed. 770363. Painting Practices for Galvanized Steel. Mac- kenzie K. Endo, Argo Paint &amp; Chemical Co. Painting of galvanized steel has been treated as an art because of the unpredictable results. Often when all the required finishing steps have been followed, the per- formance of the coatings is less than expected. The major cause is the lack of preparation of the surface and poor choice of paint system. This paper will deal with some of these parameters. 1977 SAE Transactions 770364. Task Force on Undervehicle Corrosion of Coated Steels (SAE - Iron and Steel Technical Com- mittee, Division 32). R. J. Neville, Dominion Foundries and Steel Ltd. (Canada). The task force, formed on October 7, 1975, consists of members from three American automakers and ten American and Canadian steelmakers. Their goal is to develop an SAE Recommended Practice on a method of testing the corrosion resistance of coated steels in an undervehicle deicing salt environment. It is intended that suppliers will use this test to rank candidate coatings. Current lab tests are felt to lack correlation with actual field performance. This report indicates the direction the task force is taking and the progress to-date. 770365. Three-Way Conversion Catalysts Part of the New Emission Control System. J. J. Mooney, C. E. Thompson and J. C. Dettling, Engelhard Indus- tries Division Engelhard Minerals &amp; Chemicals Corporation. When the three-way conversion (TWC) catalysts were aged on representative 1977 unleaded commercial fuel, they had higher conversion efficiencies and improved durability than catalysts aged on modified 1975 FTP specification fuel containing approximately 0.025 g/gal Pb and low levels of phosphorus. As the rhodium content was increased in a series of platinum-rhodium TWC catalysts, the maximum conversion efficiency and durability in- creased, and the mine recovery ratio of Pt/Rh was found to be most susceptible to lead poisoning. However, good NOx efficiencies can be obtained from mine recovery 65</page><page sequence="51">770366 - 770373 ratio Pt/Rh TWC catalysts after 25,000 miles of engine aging. It is shown that improvements in catalyst formu- lations containing mine recovery ratio Pt/Rh resulted in higher conversion efficiencies. Monolithic TWC catalysts require approximately the same total precious metal as current oxidation catalysts. Particulate TWC catalysts show beneficial effects in increasing the precious metal loading above 15 grams/cubic foot. 1977 SA E Transactions 770366. Characterization of Multifunctional Catalysts for Automotive Exhaust Purification. E. Koberstein, Degussa Wolfgang (Germany). The basic working principles and the different types of multifunctional catalysts for "three way systems" are reviewed. Test methods for multifunctional catalysts characterizing activity and stability are described. Ageing procedures in air may cause problems with rhodium containing multifunctional catalysts. Different surface oxidation states of rhodium de- pending on pretreatment conditions were detected in multifunctional catalysts. The influence of those oxidation states on activity is discussed. 1977 SA E Transactions 770367. The Role of Rhodium in Rh/Pt Catalysts for CO/HC/NOx and S04 = Emission Control - The Influence of Oxygen on Catalyst Per- formance. B. J. Cooper, B. Harrison and E. Shutt, Johnson Matthey Research Centre (Unit- ed Kingdom); and I. Lichtenstein, Matthey Bishop Inc. The use of Rh/Pt catalysts in automobile exhaust emission control is now well established. These catalysts are applicable in both the conventional CO/HC control system and the more novel TWC approach seeking to control CO, HC and NOx emissions simultaneously. During comparative investigations of Rh/Pt vs. Pt catalysts it has become apparent that Rh/Pt catalysts possess certain features which are absent in other noble metal combinations. Thus in general Rh/Pt catalysts show much greater ability to convert NOx under TWC con- ditions, and produce lower sulphate emissions under net oxidising conditions. On the other hand Rh/Pt can show lower HC conversion and durability than other noble metal combinations when operated under vast excess of oxygen. Surface studies in this laboratory have revealed that these effects can be attributed in part to surface en- richment of the Rh/Pt system by the rhodium component. This is followed by oxidation to produce durable surface species which are inactive to sulphate formation, and reduce the activity of the catalyst to HC conversion. The role of such species in the conversion of NOx is discussed, and possible solutions to this problem outlined in terms of catalyst design criteria. 770368. Effect of Support on Noble Metal Catalysts for Three- Way Conversions. Gwan Kim and James M. Maselli, W. R. Grace &amp; Co. Noble metals including small amounts of rhodium (Pt/Rh = 14-19 weight ratio) supported on silica, alumina and silica-alumina were tested for three-way conversions. Catalysts were evaluated fresh, after insitu hydrothermal aging at 816Â°C, and after cyclic pulsator aging at 538Â°C a 704 Â°C. All samples exhibited good three-way conversions when fresh. Overall, the catalysts supported on alumina performed the best based on resistance toward chemical poisons such as Pb, P and S. 770369. Unregulated Emissions from Three-Way Catalyst Cars. Ronald L. Bradow and Fred D. Stump, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In response to more stringent emission requirements, catalysts for reducing NO to molecular nitrogen were developed. One of the most promising of these, the three-way catalyst, has been the subject of an EPA study to determine if it produces new tailpipe contaminants. This study and its results are described. 770371. Dynamometer Test Procedures for Three-Way Catalyst Screening. M. E. Heyde, M. K. Adawi, D. H. Anderson, M. P. Schroeder and R. G. DeLosh, Ford Motor Co. Procedures are described for rapidly aging and for testing three-way catalysts on an engine dynamometer which are relatable to actual vehicle aging and CVS testing. The accelerated aging cycle consists of a modification of the AMA durability driving cycle; testing consists of the measurement of HC, CO and NOx conversion as a function of A/F with superimposed perturbations which simulate limit cycle variations of A/F in a closed-loop fuel control system. 770372. (SP-416) The Relationship Between Oil Viscosity and Engine Performance - A Literature Search. R. M. Stewart, Gulf Science and Technology Co.; and T. W. Selby, Savant, Inc. This paper summarizes the published information on the relationship between oil viscosity and engine performance that may be of use in developing a new engine oil viscosity classification system. The specific engine performance factors and associated variables considered are wear, oil consumption, fuel economy, hot starting, cold starting, low temperature pumpability, noise, and shear stability. Discussion: T. W. Selby, Savant, Inc. 1977 SA E Transactions 770373. (SP4 16) Engine Oil Viscosity Classifications-Past, Present, and Future. Michael L. McMillan, Research Labs, General Motors Corp. An extensive effort is under way to revise the SAE Engine Oil Viscosity Classification System to reflect user needs more realistically. To understand how the present system evolved, the history of the classification is traced, from the 66</page><page sequence="52">770374 - 770378 original version first published in 1911 to the present 1976 version. Reasons for both high- and low-temperature viscosity grades, multigrading, and footnotes to the viscosity table are discussed, as well as other classification systems which have been discarded over the years. A critical assessment of the present classification is made from opinions offered at an SAE Open Forum last year. It is pointed out that the system has become quite complicated with four low-temperature and four high- temperature grades, five footnotes, and an appendix. Moreover, the high-temperature viscosity grades are based on an unrealistically low temperature of 98.9Â°C (210Â°F) and an unrealistically low-shear (kinematic) viscosity compared with engine operating conditions. Several suggestions for improving the system are offered, although no one particular approach is advo- cated. It is concluded that to adequately reflect the effects of oil viscosity on engine performance in the field, the classification system must be revised to include a measure of low-temperature oil fluidity and a high-temperature, high-shear measure of viscosity which correlates with engine performance - a measure which has not yet been developed. 1977 SAE Transactions 770374. (SP-416) European Activity Concerning Engine Oil Viscosity Classification. A. A. Cassiani Ingoni, G. F. DiLelio and C. G. A. Eberan Eberhorst, Coordinating European Council. The growing interest and concern over the problem of the high temperature viscosity of engine oils and its effect on the engine performance, following the proposal for revision of the SAE J 300, pushed the CEC Engine Lubricant Technical Committee to establish an Inves- tigation Group (IGL 9) to investigate the subject of Viscosity Measurement at High Temperature. The Low Temperature aspects are mainly covered by the CEC Investigation Group IGL 8 and the German National Organization DKA Study Group. The IGL 9 Group agreed to circulate a questionnaire which was gratified with high degree of attention; 31 companies answered confirming the importance of the investigation and the requirement of viscosity measure- ments more realistic and in line with today's engine operating conditions. A first screening work carried out on some reference oils has .demonstrated the possibility of correlation among different bench measuring techniques and an engine. The second stage now underway sees a new set of 9 test oils formulated using different polymer species commercially available, to be submitted to 22 "engine viscosity" and "viscosity rig" tests to define correlations where possible. 770375. (SP-416) A Study of the Significance of Lubri- cant Viscosity in Blow-By Control. C. Neveu, Rohm and Haas France S.A. An engine test procedure was developed to measure blowby rates with a modified European diesel test engine. With monograde oils, the rate correlates with viscosity. The higher the engine blowby level the less the engine sensitivity to lubricant viscosity. The differences in blowby control observed with multigraded oils appear to correlate with their viscosities at temperatures well above 210Â°F (98.9Â°C). Other factors such as temporary shear loss may play a part as indicated by qualitative obser- vations. The same general trends were also confirmed in an unmodified multicylinder gasoline engine. 770376. (SP-416) The Use of Simulant Devices to Evaluate the Wear Performance of Multigraded Engine Oils. I. L. Goldblatt, Exxon Res. and Engrg. Co. Conditions for the laboratory simulation of engine ring and cam-and-tappet wear performance have been estab- lished. By using these test conditions, the wear per- formance of twelve oils of known viscometric properties has been determined. The results suggest that viscosity under either high or low shear conditions is not related to the wear performance under these thin film simulated engine conditions. Wear performance for these oils does appear to be related to the degree of polymer degradation experienced under the conditions of thin film or elasto- hydrodynamic lubrication. 770377. (SP-416) Measurement of Temporary and Per- manent Shear with the Instron Capillary Rhe- ometer. T. W. Johnson and M. T. O'Shaughnessy, Phillips Petroleum Co. The Instron Capillary Rheometer, with special extremely fine capillaries, has been used to measure the apparent viscosities of non-Newtonian polymer- thickened multi- grade oils at temperatures from 100Â°F to 320Â°F and shear rates to 106 sec1. The same apparatus can produce permanent shear under extreme conditions. Temporary shear data at 100Â°, 150Â°, 210Â°, 280Â° and 320Â°F are reported for eight commercial oils and five experimental oils formulated with different VI improvers in the same base oil. Permanent shear data are given for a larger set of oils. Discussion: S. W. Rein, Texaco, Inc. 1977 SAE Transactions 770378. (SP-416) Some Relationships Between the Visco- metric Properties of Motor Oils and Performance in European Engines. J. C. Bell and M. A. Voisey, Shell Research Ltd., Thornton Research Centre. Piston ring wear, bearing wear and fuel consumption have been measured in European engines run under fully warmed-up conditions at steady speed and load. The engines were lubricated with motor oils which were formulated from a range of types and concentrations of VI improvers and base oil blends. The viscosities, viscosity/temperature relationships and viscosity/shear- rate characteristics of these formulations varied widely. The results for all the oils tested showed a poor correlation 67</page><page sequence="53">770379 - 770386 with their low shear-rate viscosities measured at 2 10Â° F or 150Â°C but a good correlation with their viscosities measured at shear rates of 105 to 106 sec1.

Tims, Esso Research Centre (England). Conventional laboratory viscometric methods are not adequate to characterise the behaviour of multigrade oils in service, in that they take no account of the high shear rates occurring in running engines. A technique has been developed which permits the measurement of apparent viscosity in the crankshaft bearings of engines running under road conditions. The technique is to isolate Ä single bearing, provide it with its own oil feed and calibrate flow-rates through it under normal running conditions using single grade oils. Flow rates obtained with multi- grade oils can then be converted to apparent viscosities, seen by the bearing under operating conditions. Results show that temporary viscosity loss due to shear is important even at moderate speeds (3000 rpm) in normal production engines. Shear breakdown character- istics of a range of different chemical types of VI Improvers have been compared. The technique has also been modified to permit determination of the minimum viscosity acceptable to the engine by relating this parameter to temperature increases in the bearing. Discussion: R. C.

The cost of operation projected for a fuel cell automobile could be as much as l-2&lt;P/mi less than for a comparable internal combustion engine car or an all-battery car, assuming energy raw material cost equilibrated at 10$/bbl crude oil equivalent. Fuel cost is a small but significant element in total operating cost. Therefore, the projected cost advantage of the fuel cell automobile increases with increasing cost of fossil fuel, because of the higher energy efficiency projected for the fuel cell automobile. 770381. Charge-Discharge Behavior of the C.G.E. Cir- culating Zinc-Air Vehicle Battery. A. J. Appleby, J. Jacquelin and J. P. Pompon, Laboratoires de Marcoussis (France). The primary unit of the C.G.E. zinc-air electric vehicle battery has been described in previous publications. It consists of a constant cross-section tubular fuel cell using zinc powder in circulating 12 N KOH solution. All the reaction product (zincate) is maintained in coloidal solution. The system is capable of lifetimes in excess of 1,800 hours and will be of low cost. The present paper deals with the technical aspects of recharge of the system, which, in contrast to the primary cell, is still in the laboratory engineering stage. The limitations of the system are discussed and the overall performance based on different parameters is given. A number of different economic options are examined. 770382. Application of the Ford Sodium-Sulfur Battery in Electric Vehicles. L. E. Unnewehr, R. W. Minck and C. Owens, Engineering and Research Staff, Ford Motor Co. The Ford Sodium-Sulfur battery is evaluated for appli- cations in electric vehicles. The required power and energy ratings of a battery to achieve acceptable performance and driving range for a specific commuter-type vehicle are calculated and discussed. The relative merits of the use of mechanical transmissions and regenerative braking in electric vehicles are explored. Volumes and weights of several battery packages based upon realistic NaS cell designs are calculated, and the thermal management problems of these high-temperature battery packages during the varying power levels required in vehicular applications are discussed. 1977 SA E Transactions 770384. A High Energy Nickei-Zinc Battery for Electric Vehicles. Otto von Krusenstierna and Mats Reger, AGA AB, Innovation Center (Sweden). Before far-term high energy EV-batteries have been developed near-term lead-acid and intermediate batteries with energy densities 40-80 Wh/kg can meet the energy demands of a large number of commuter and delivery cars. A new nickel-zinc battery is described with energy densities of 50-80 Ah/kg depending on the choice of nickel cathodes. A vibration charging technique com- pletely eliminates the zinc dendrite and shape effects and the nickel cathodes therefore determine the lifetime. A 2 kW battery is deep cycled since 1973 and 1200 cycles have been passed. Traction cells up to 350 Ah have been field tested in vehicles. 770385. Clean Transportation for New Towns DAI- HATSU Electric Vehicles in the Senboku Area. Shoji Honda, Masahiro Sugi tani, Ichiro Yumoto and Shiro Kawakatsu, Daihatsu Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan). SENBOKU is the name of new town which is expected to become a model area of Clean Transportation in Japan. The transportation of peoples and goods would be systematized, and some kinds of electric vehicles would be used as its means with the valuation of non pollution. Inside of Senboku area, a joint home delivery experimental test, using our newly developed electric cab-van of DAIHATSU ES40V, was finished. The electric propulsion systems, specification and performance of ES40V are discussed as well as its quick-charging system. 770386.

Okazaki, Japan Storage Battery Co., Ltd. An electric milk delivery car, using lead-acid batteries as the power source, has been put into practical use for about four and a half years. From the data obtained during these years, its feasibility was confirmed and some problems in battery handling were made clear to make most effective use of battery. 770387. Battery Powered Jeep and Van Performance. E. J. Dowgiallo, Jr., I. R. Snellings and W. H. Blake, Electrochemical Div., U.S. Army Mobil- ity Equipment Res. and Dev. Command. A postal jeep and a commercial delivery van were evaluated. Energy data from operation over a test loop and various grades is presented for zero to 15 mph start/stop and 30 mph range runs. Test results are summarized in a graph for prediction of remaining miles based on route terrain. Jeep regenerative braking is discussed. A high power electrical simulator was used to reproduce a mountainous terrain load profile. The simulator was programmed with magnetic tapes made up from actual field recordings. This verified calculations, gave additional battery information and eliminated the need for a mountainous terrain test track. 770388. Design of Electric Commercial Vehicles for Production. G. G. Harding, Lucas Batteries Ltd. (England). Development of high performance electric vehicles has been pursued both by simple conversions from standard gasoline vehicles, and by designing a purpose-built vehicle in the form of a taxi incorporating novel features. By combining the lower cost of the former method with the greater efficiency of the latter, the Mark III Lucas electric vehicle has been evolved based on a standard van, providing 1 tonne payload capacity. The compact drive package can be fitted to a variety of vehicles at the initial manufacturing stage. Some of the implications for dis- tribution and servicing of quantity-produced electric vehicles are considered. 770389. The Origins of Drag and Lift Reductions on Automobiles with Front and Rear Spoilers. Franz K. Schenkel, General Motors Corp. Front underbody dams and rear deck lips ("spoilers") have been in use for some time as aerodynamic aids for automobile drag and lift reduction. However, the flow field effects and associated surface pressure changes which produce these improvements have not been well understood. A series of wind tunnel tests was performed with a 3/8-scale semi-detailed model of a notchback sedan. Force and moment measurements were augmented by model exterior, engine compartment and groundplane surface pressure measurements, as well as flow visual- ization experiments. Aerodynamic lift and drag contri- butions of various model components, as well as the changes produced on these components by the addition of "spoilers", have been determined. Flow field mechanisms which will produce the observed pressure and force changes have been proposed. 1977 SA E Transactions 770390. The Calculation of the Flow Field Past a Van with the Aid of a Panel Method. S. R. Ahmed, Deutsche Forschungs-und Versuchsanstalt fÃ¼r Luft-und Raumfahrt; and W.-H. Hucho, Volks- wagenwerk AG. An evaluation of a first order 'panel' method to predict the pressure distribution on a bluff van type vehicle body is presented. Two cases were considered: a) single vehicle with and without cross-wind, and b) the overtaking process of two identical vehicles. The latter has been treated as quasi-stationary. The theoretical model incor- porates simulation of the ground and van wake, whereby the wake geometry is based on experimental information. Extensive pressure measurements were performed with quarter scale models in a wind tunnel for the above mentioned cases. These data permit a systematic com- parison with the results of theory. 1977 SA E Transactions 770391. Transient Aerodynamic Forces and Moments on Models of Vehicles Passing Through Cross-Wind. Yasushi Yoshida, Shinri Muto and Tetsuo Imaizumi, Japan Automobile Research Institute, Inc. (Japan). In the past, investigations of the dynamic performance of vehicles using scale models have rarely been attempted. This paper describes the experimental transient side forces and yawing moments on 1/10 scale models of vehicles passing through cross-wind region. From this study, it is clarified that the model experiment is an effective method in analyzing the dynamic behavior of vehicles in cross- wind. 770392. Aerodynamic and Climatic Wind Tunnels in the FIAT Research Center. G. Antonucci, G. Cero- netti and A. Costelli, FIAT Research Center (Italy). The Authors illustrate the Fiat wind tunnels (one aerodynamic and two climatic) for true scale vehicle testing and provide a detailed description of the relevant performance and fluid-dynamic characteristics. All three tunnels are of closed-circuit, semi-open test section design, and are built of reinforced concrete (aerodynamic) and of sheet steel (climatic). Also described is the fluid-dynamic investigation work on scaled-down wind tunnel pilot model as aid in optimizing airduct configuration and design. 770393. An Objective Method of Estimating Car Interior Aerodynamic Noise. G. F. Romberg and R. G. Lajoie, Chrysler Corp. 69</page><page sequence="55">770394 - 770401 A method of breaking down car interior noise meas- urements into aerodynamic noise, residual noise and aspiration noise is presented. Correlation between car interior aerodynamic noise extracted from "on the road" measurements and car interior aerodynamic noise meas- ured in a wind tunnel indicate the validity of the method. Limitations of the method in both frequency and car airspeed are identified. 1977 SA E Transactions 770394. A Technique for Measuring Interior Wind Rush Noise at the Clay Model Stage of Vehicle Design. Lawrence J. Oswald, Research Labs, General Motors Corp.; and David A. Dolby, Chevrolet Engrg., General Motors Corp. A technique has been developed to evaluate interior wind rush noise during wind tunnel tests of full-size clay models of vehicles. A small, box-like enclosure with acoustic characteristics made similar to those of a typical vehicle interior is inserted into the clay model behind an actual front sideglass. The wind rush noise coming through the sideglass is directly measured by microphones located within the enclosure. The technique can readily detect wind rush noise changes due to body modifications in the vicinity of the windshield-pillar. In addition, the wind tunnel results agree well with those found on-road. 1977 SA E Transactions 770395. Planar Semiconductor Temperature Sensor for Automotive Applications. K. C. Wiemer, W. T. Matzen, S. J. Tribble, J. G. Mclntire and T. BiaÅek, Texas Instruments Inc. The theory of silicon temperature sensor and the design of a planar sensing chip are discussed. The temperature- resistance function is essentially logarithmic with a TCR of 0.7%/Â°C near room temperature. Nominal, polarity- independent resistance values (@ 25 Â°C) from 100 to 5000 ohms are attainable; the discussion, however, will be restricted to 1.0 and 3.3 K ohm devices. Resistance- temperature characteristics of planar silicon sensors are compared to those of currently available metal-wire sensors and thermistors. Due to the small size of the actual sensing chip (15 X 15 X 6 mil3) the heat- transfer char- acteristics of the sensor are determined almost entirely by the packaging configuration; thermal response and dis- sipation data are presented for an axial-lead glass diode package and a plastic (Silect1) transistor package and comparison is made with the characteristics of conven- tional silicon sensors. The use of the silicon sensor in automotive applications is briefly discussed. T - trademark of Texas Instruments Incorporated 770396. Electronic Sensing for Vehicle Height Control. Robert W. Hegel, Michael R. Bethell and Ronald L. Sorensen, Monroe Auto Equipment Co. Automatic vehicle height control, using a closed loop system, has been used on some vehicles for several years. A key element in such a system is the height or axle-to-body distance sensor. Present systems use a mechanical sensor and valve assembly for control of the system. This paper describes a new electronic-based system which eliminates the mechanical valve and integrates an electronic sensing system into the air-spring shock absorber which is an existing part of the leveling system. This system provides for weight and space savings and simplifies system installation. 770397. An Automotive Oriented Pressure Sensor Design. Dennis Coleman, Instruments Div., Bunker Ramo Corp. Increasing complexity of electronic engine control systems has resulted in a significant need for cost effective pressure transducers which can cope with the total automotive environment. This presentation deals with the design and application of such a transducer. While it was developed primarily for use as a manifold vacuum sensor, it can readily be used as a barometric sensor, altimeter, or for other applications requiring accurate measurement of fluid pressures. The sensor's accuracy, ruggedness, and low cost make it an ideal match for the requirements of the electronic engine control systems being considered by most automobile manufacturers. 770399. Sensors for Automotive-Engine Control. J. N. Reddy, Bendix Electronics and Engine Control Systems Group. This paper presents an overview of concepts under development for the sensing of pressure, temperature, crankshaft position, throttle position, airflow, and exhaust gas, along with transfer characteristics for such sensors. The need for accurate automotive sensors is discussed from a control-systems viewpoint. A computer-controlled design verification test arrangement is also described. 770400. Device Model of the Zirconia Oxygen Sensor. William J. Fleming, General Motors Corp. The zirconia oxygen sensor, when used in closed-loop engine control systems, potentially provides the necessary measurement of air-fuel ratio for effective operation of a three-way catalyst. The present study was undertaken to determine the physical constants which define the per- formance of experimental oxygen sensors. An analytical method was used to derive, directly from measured sensor voltage vs air-fuel ratio curves, the physical constants of experimental sensors. Determinations of these constants permitted: (1) better understanding of the physical processes which govern behavior of oxygen sensors under various operating conditions, and (2) accurate device modelling of oxygen sensors which allowed realistic mathematical simulations of sensor performance. 1977 SA E Transactions 770401.

A description of a closed loop fuel metering system was given in the SAE-Paper "Closed Loop Exhaust Emission Control System with Electronic Fuel Injection". The component of paramount importance in the control system is the Lambda-Sensor, about which has been reported in the SAE-Paper "Ceramic Aspects of the Bosch Lambda-Sensor". The paper reports on the work recently done for optimizing the Lambda-Sensor. As a result of this work the sensor of the latest design is an Y203-stabilized Zr02-sensor whose temperature response is 150Â°C lower and whose time of response in the CVS- test is the half. Generally, experimental work has been concentrated on improvement of - thermal, mechanical stability and resistivity against exhaust - operating temperature range . - response speed - working life The results are given in this paper. 1977 SA E Transactions 770402. Electronic Fuel Injection Systems Utilizing Co- rona Discharge Air Mass Flow Transducers. M. H. Cops and J. H. Moore, Group Research Centre, Joseph Lucas Ltd. Accurate control of electronic fuel injection systems primarily requires a knowledge of the mass flow of air into the engine under all circumstances. The corona discharge air flow meter is one of the few transducers capable of measuring this quantity directly and this paper describes the application of such transducers to EFI control utilizing both digital and analogue electronic techniques. Problems of transducer accuracy and vehicle driveability encountered during extensive operating tests are also discussed. 1977 SA E Transactions 770403. Sensor Selection for Automatic Diagnosis of Vehicles. Angelo Muzi, RCA Corp. Improvements in vehicle diagnostics are evolving both from the development of new sensors and from the extension of standard sensor capabilities made possible by modern electronics and processing techniques. Accord- ingly, the effective application of sensors to vehicles is an overall system problem. Foremost among the design considerations are the best parameters that are indicators of faults, the accuracy with which they must be measured, and the methods available for evaluating, processing and displaying those parameters. Next are the considerations of survival and performance in the automotive environ- ment, the operator's method of performing the test, and applicability to a broad spectrum of vehicles. This paper discusses criteria for sensor selection from the viewpoint of a developer of systems for the mal- function diagnosis of vehicles with spark or compression ignition engines. The focus is on pressure transducers. The considerations, however, are generally applicable to all sensors. 770404. A New Method of Investigation of Swirl Ports. GÃ¶tz Tippelmann, Consulting Engineer (Ger- many). A new method is described for determinating swirl in internal combustion engines, which is based on the direct measurement of the angular momentum of the cylinder- charge. A corresponding swirl-parameter is defined and its relation to conventional swirl-parameters is discussed. Engine-tests prove this swirl-parameter to be the flow-characteristic which controls the combustion in Diesel-engines with direct injection. The optimum ad- justing of swirl to a combustion system by means of a cylinder head with flexible inlet ports and the cylinder head with two swirl producing inlet ports are discussed as examples. They show that the new method is advan- tageous for theoretical and practical reasons. 1977 SA E Transactions 770405. An Investigation of Cylinder Gas Motion in the Direct Injection Diesel Engine. M. J. Tindal and T. J. Williams, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Univ. of London King's College. In earlier papers presented to the Society of Automotive Engineers (1)*(2) the authors described the development of the gas flow pattern during the induction and compression strokes in direct injection diesel engines. Cylinder gas velocities were measured in motored engines using hot wire probes with compensation for variations in gas temperature. This technique is often considered more appropriate for the research laboratory than for industrial use and many engine manufacturers rely on steady flow testing of cylinder heads for assessing the swirl potential of new designs. In this paper the validity of the steady flow method of predicting swirl is examined. 770406. Study of Air Motion in a Compression Ignition Engine Cylinder. T. R. Jagadeesan, Guindy Engineering College (India); and B. S. Murthy, Indian Instutute of Technology (India). Three dimensional air motion in a motored diesel engine has been studied using hot wire anemometer. Three probe orientation technique was adopted to obtain the three components of the velocity at the point of measurement. The probes were calibrated in a high pressure and high temperature wind tunnel. The variables studied are engine speed, valve masking (size and orientation) and com- pression ratio. While solid body type of motion is observed during the early stages of compression, com- pound vortex type of flow is found to prevail during the later stages. 770407. Convective and Radiative Heat Transfer in a High Swirl Direct Injection Diesel Engine. J. C. Dent, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Univ. of 71</page><page sequence="57">770408-770413 Technology, Loughborough; and S. J. Sulaiman, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Univ. of Mosul, Mosul, Iraq. Convective and radiative heat transfer measurements in a direct injection Diesel engine have been made using surface thermocouples and a pyroelectric radiation detec- tor. Measured instantaneous local and spatially averaged convective heat fluxes agree with correlations for tur- bulent convection to flat surfaces, when using measured local air motion data. Two temperature zones were considered in the computation of local heat flux. Radiative heat flux measurements corroborate the findings of others, but lower flux levels are attributed to the high swirl engine used here. A proposal for computation of radiative heat flux from soot concentration shows promise. 1977 SA E Transactions 770408. Stochastic Combustion and Diesel Engine Noise. Warren C. Strahle and John C. Handley, School of Aerospace Engrg., Georgia Inst, of Tech- nology. A causal relation is shown to exist between the cycle- to-cycle variability of the pressure-time trace and the noise radiated from a single cylinder, direct injection Diesel engine. Measurements conducted over a range of load and speed include spectral analysis of the p-t trace and the radiated noise as well as coherence measurements between the cylinder pressure and noise signals. In the spectral analysis of the p-t trace, a signal averaging technique is used to separate the periodic part of the trace from the random fluctuations superimposed on the periodic part. In the data reduction scheme account is taken of the effect of imperfect speed and load control on the results. The results are supported by knowledge of the randomness of turbulent combustion in other flow systems. 770409. Investigating Diesel Engine Combustion by Means of a Timed Sampling Valve. N. D. Whitehouse, E. Clough and P. S. Roberts, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technol- ogy. The design and application of a high speed, timed, sampling valve for the extraction of gas samples, at a variety of points and times, from the combustion chamber of a medium speed diesel engine is described. The valve was traversed radially into the combustion chamber and combined with rotation of the central fuel injector gave sampling at sixteen points relative to the fuel spray. For any given sample the valve opened and closed at the same time each cycle. Samples were analysed and the levels of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and nitric oxide were recorded for the complete combustion process. 770410. Calculations of Gaseous Products During Com- bustion in a Diesel Engine Using a Four Zone Model. N. D. Whitehouse and N. Baluswamy, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Uni- versity of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology (United Kingdom). A two zone model used for engine performance calcu- lations has been developed into four zones by dividing the air fuel mixing, or burning zone into three parts, a fuel zone, a stoichiometric burning zone and a products plus air zone. This gives a high temperature zone for reaction kinetics calculations of NO and a colder quench zone. Equilibrium calculations are used for CO and C02. The model was used to predict the effect of design and operating conditions on the formation of nitric oxide. Some predictions are compared with results from gas sampling in the cylinder with a timed valve. 770411. Effective Flow Area of Piston Controlled Exhaust and Inlet Ports. W. A. Woods, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Liver- pool (United Kingdom); and A. Allison, Impe- rial Chemical Industries Ltd. (United Kingdom). Computer simulations of internal combustion engine cycles utilize empirical information, such as the flow characteristics of valves. This paper presents compre- hensive data on the flow area of piston controlled ports. Detailed results of systematic steady flow tests on both inlet and exhaust ports are presented. New aspects of the work are that it covers a wide range of pressure ratios for normal and reverse flow directions and that comparative results, with and without the restrictions of an exhaust belt, are included. The concept of effective flow area is briefly discussed and relevant equations given. Previous experimental work is reviewed. 770412. Investigation of Interaction Between Swirl and Jets in Direct Injection Diesel Engines Using a Water Model. Richard J. B. Way, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, University of Bath (United Kingdom). Injection of water into water, using an indicator dye for flow visualization, is used to represent the mixing of a fuel spray in swirling air in a Diesel engine. Effects of changes in swirl and jet penetration parameters are shown. Dimensionless groups of variables are derived which may be used to match injection equipment to a combustion chamber. 1 977 SA E Transactions 770413. Prediction of Spray Evaporation in Reciprocating Engines. Takeyuki Kamimoto and Shin Matsu- oka, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Tokyo Insti- tute of Technology. A theoretical model for predicting the evaporation process of liquid fuel sprays in both diesel and S.I. stratified charge engines is presented: The injected liquid fuel is assumed to break up into droplets with a certain time delay which is determined through careful experiments on 72</page><page sequence="58">770414-770421 the heat absorption process of injected fuel in a high temperature, high pressure inert atmosphere. The evap- oration, heat absorption, and motion of these droplets are computed, together with the change of gas conditions inside the spray, by solving a coupled system of equations made up of heat and mass balance between droplets and gas. The effects of such parameters as the surrounding gas conditions, fuel properties, and spray characteristics on evaporation are investigated by the model. Reference is also made to the application of a predicted result to the calculation of burning rate in a direct injection diesel engine. 1977 SA E Transactions 770414. The Development of Quality Information Sys- tems in Automotive Assembly. Walton M. Han- cock, Univ. of Michigan; and Francis E. Pionka, Wayne State Univ. Two experiments were run in automotive assembly plants in an attempt to develop quality control systems that would be more effective. The first experiments where special teams were established resulted in improved quality until the teams were removed. The second experiment where the line production personnel were involved in system development resulted in improved quality, but also substantially reduced production costs. The system design is presented for each experiment as well as the method of evaluation. 1977 SA E Transactions 770415. A Program for Predicting and Controlling Car- burization Response. J. S. Kirkaldy, McMaster Univ. and Minitech Ltd. The program predicts the gas or pack carburizing and subsequent heat treatment response of alloy steels. In the carburizing part it accounts for non-equilibrium surface conditions, planned variations in carbon potential and a variable diffusion coefficient. The prediction of the heat treatment response is based on an accurate predictor of Jominy end-quench curves. Transformation to other shapes and severities of quench is achieved via LamonÅ¥s published empirical relations. 1977 SA E Transactions 770416. Laboratory Evaluation of New Low Alloy Gear Steels. Dennis Vukovich and Richard Pierman, Eaton Corp.; and Mark Matovina, Manufac- turing Technology, Inc. The bending fatigue, charpy impact, impact fatigue, and metallurgical properties of carburized 8620, EX 10, EX 15, and 1524 steel gears were evaluated to determine if equivalent hardenability is a criterion sufficient to merit the substitution of 8620 with EX 10 and EX 15 for gearing applications. Tests run on actual gear teeth using a unique test fixture show that the impact requirements of each application must be considered. Sufficient samples should be tested to insure that neither the substitute steel nor the heat treatment have reduced the performance under impact loading. 1977 SA E Transactions 770418. An Analytical Study of Transmission Modifi- cations as Related to Vehicle Performance and Economy. Howard E. Chana, William L. Fedewa and John E. Mahoney, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp. A method of vehicle performance measurement has been developed so that selection of optimum fuel-economy- performance trade-offs can be made for a vehicle having various powertrain components. This method was utilized in an analytical study of drivetrain component features such as - overall ratio range, number of ratio steps, locked converters, continuously variable drives, etc. Both manual and automatic type transmissions are considered. Indi- cations are that ratio range is an important consideration in the selection of transmission design parameters and also conventional transmission concepts can be compet- itive with the more exotic continuously variable type units. 1977 SA E Transactions 770419. Corrosion Resistant Steel and Nonferrous Ma- terials for Metric Fasteners. Joseph S. Orlando, ITT Harper. New metric fastener standards for Corrosion Resistant and Nonferrous materials have been developed by the Industrial Fasteners Institute's Standards and Technical Practices Committee: IFI 516 - Mechanical and Material Requirements for Metric Externally Threaded Fasteners in Corrosion Resistant Steels IFI 517 - Mechanical and Material Requirements for Metric Nuts in Corrosion Resistant Steels IFI 518 - Mechanical and Material Requirements for Metric Externally Threaded Fasteners in Nonferrous Alloys IFI 519 - Mechanical and Material Requirements for Metric Nuts in Nonferrous Alloys These standards reflect ANSI Committee recommen- dations coupled with ISO actions. 770420. Analysis and Design of Threaded Assemblies. E. M. Alexander, Steel Co. of Canada, Ltd. A model to precisely predict the load and mode of failure of threaded assemblies has been developed. The analysis is applicable to any assembly of the ISO R68 or Unified thread form, of which pertinent dimensional and me- chanical properties are known. These techniques have been extended to provide a method for design of assemblies, and appropriate testing standards for the product. 1977 SA E Transactions 770421. Metric Fasteners - Design and Performance 73</page><page sequence="59">770422 - 770430 Opportunities. John C. McMurray, Russell, Burdsall &amp; Ward, Inc. Metric threaded fasteners being developed in North America differ in some important respects from current ISO standards. Significant weight savings can be achieved on MIO, M 12, and M 14 Hex Cap Screws by adopting smaller hex head sizes. A formed hex cap screw is also proposed as an alternative design. Reduced diameter body cap screws with full body diameter shoulders offer both weight savings in longer lengths and increased elastic elongation. The 12 spline flange screw design is reviewed. A style 1, Property Class 9, hex nut is proposed to be made of AISI 1018 - 1020 steel without heat treatment. 770422. Hex Flange Bolt Head Weight Reduction Design Criteria. Janos F. Nagy, Ford Motor Co. This report describes the design of hex flange head bolts, both inch and metric series, having heads reduced in volume to the least amount without degrading manu- facturing or assembly requirements. Head dimensions were developed through a partly empirical equation involving all normal bolt strength test criteria, plus the added criteria that driving capacity must be no less than twice the torsional strength. The design was validated both in the laboratory and on the production line. An annual material saving of 2,000 tons resulted by replacing the standard hex flange bolts with the reduced head design in Ford Motor Company's production. 770423. Design of Metric Machine and Tapping Screws. Ray Ollis, Jr., P. L. Robertson Mfg. Div., Procor, Ltd. A system has been devised that utilizes the same head for metric screws having machine and spaced tapping threads. This family of metric fasteners includes Pan, Flat and Raised Countersunk Heads, both Slotted and Recessed and Hexagon and Hexagon Washer Heads. Of particular interest are the analytical approaches taken to develop the designs. A formulation to calculate the torque capabilities of Phillips recesses was used to determine recess depths in all recessed product. Formulae were also developed to calculate recess volumes so that head volumes could be accurately assessed. A computer program employing the Monte Carlo principle was used to calculate minimum material clearance between recess and screw outer surfaces, underhead bearing areas and head material volumes. Included in this report are the complete formulations of all dimensions, design criteria and details of the analytical studies made. 1977 SA E Transactions 770424. GMC Motorhome Body Construction. Lyn C. Hollis, General Motors Truck &amp; Coach Div., General Motors Corp. This paper is intended to describe the body construction of the GMC Motorhome. This is done by following the evolution of the design from inception through styling, engineering and assembly. In this way, the reasoning behind the various design choices as well as the resultant design are discussed. 770425. The Use of Honeycomb Sandwich Construction in Recreational Vehicles. Jay Brentjes, Hexcel Corp. The energy shortage has made the need for high strength, light weight materials an increasingly important concern in the Recreational Vehicle Industry. One solution is the honeycomb sandwich construction technique, which combines the advantages of strength, stiffness and drastically reduced weight and is versatile enough to meet a variety of design requirements. This technique is discussed and compared to other methods of vehicle construction. 770426. On the Vehicle Development of the Dual Mode Bus System. Shin Maki, Tomokazu Tokuda, Tooji Takemura, Hiromichi Uchiyama and Yukiyoshi Sasabe, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. We worked on developing vehicles for the Dual Mode Bus System, and have completed a system which can be technically put into practical application. This paper introduces an outline of the system and vehicle. As regards the operational stability of the lateral guidance system, analyses, computations using a simulation model, and experiments using test cars were conducted on two types of guidance systems, a linked type, which is to link mechanically the guidance wheel with the steered wheel, and a non-linked type. 770428. New Developments in Magnetic Suspension and Propulsion for Transportation. W. J. Holt and J. A. Ross, Rohr Industries, Inc. This paper describes the most recent accomplishments in the on-going development of the magnetically levitated and propelled ROMAGâ¢ transportation vehicle. Recent improvements, reliability analyses, and tests have proven more forcefully that ROMAG is ready for extended application in the arena of public transportation. 770430. A Low NOx Lightweight Car Diesel Engine. Stephen H. Hill and Joseph L. Dodd, Teledyne Continental Motors General Products Division. A new automobile diesel engine concept has been developed to the preliminary engine design level and demonstrated by simulating vehicle tests with a computer model using steady state engine dynamometer data. The preliminary design is a six cylinder, swirl chamber diesel of 209 CID and 130 GHP. This concept engine weighs 495 pounds and employs turbocharging, variable compression ratio, high prechamber-main chamber volume ratio and exhaust gas recirculation. An existing automobile diesel was modified to simulate the concept engine and steady state engine tests were conducted. Test results were converted to urban cycle results for a 3000 pound GVW vehicle through the use of a computer model. Emission 74</page><page sequence="60">770431 -770437 results (Grams/Mile) are .21 NOx, .24 HC, and 1.24 CO. Fuel consumption* (Miles/Gallon) is 30.3 urban cycle and 36.4 highway cycle. Vehicle cycle results at 3700 pounds GVW meet all emission requirements and exceed the future 27.5 MPG requirement by ten percent. Multifuel capability and 175 PSI BMEP power levels were also demonstrated. 1977 SA E Transactions 770431. Engine Sequence Testing of Re-Refined Lubri- cating Oils. J. W. Reynolds, M. L. Whisman and C. J. Thompson, Bartlesville Energy Re- search Center. Two oils re-refined by technology developed by the Bartlesville Energy Research Center and one com- mercially re-refined automotive lubricating oil have been subjected to engine test sequences IIC, UIC, VC, and L-38. Results of these tests and bench-scale evaluations of some physical and chemical properties of these oils are tabulated. The results obtained in this study are believed to represent the first documentation in the United States of the potential performance equivalency of re-refined lubricating oils with lubricating oils derived from virgin feedstocks. 770432. Corvette - The Buyer and the Car. David R. McLellan, Chevrolet Motor Div., General Mo- tors Corp. The Corvette has just finished its most successful year. This has been a continuing trend over several years uninterrupted by oil embargo or recession and limited only by the number of Corvettes that Chevrolet could build. What has made the Corvette such a phenomenal success in the marketplace? This paper gives insight into this question by exploring important factors in the car-buyer relationship. It is expected that this insight can be used as a guide to future product decision making. 770433. A Discussion of Alternative Sports Car Concepts. R. J. Knight and J. N. Randle, Jaguar Engi- neering Division, British Leyland UK Limited. This paper is a discussion of the relative merits of the front, mid and rear engined car concepts. After discussing some basic packaging considerations, and implications in respect of legislation, the authors make comparisons of performance potential in respect of traction and aero- dynamics. Limiting power weight ratios are derived. Primary and secondary ride implications are reviewed and effects on braking are mentioned. Steering and cornering characteristics are assessed by first establishing correlation between prediction and measurement using actual vehicles. Means of simplifying the prediction of steady state steering characteristics are described. Two "model" cars of front and mid engined configuration are then used to predict the steady state and dynamic steering consequences of various specification changes and some conclusions are drawn as to inherent differences. 1977 SA E Transactions 770434. The M.A.N. M-Combustion System in the Pas- senger Car Diesel Engine. A. Neitz, Maschinen- fabrik Augsburg-NÃ¼rnberg AG (Germany). This paper discusses the use of the direct-injection "M" combustion system in a small high-speed Diesel engine. Experimental and test results are given for a passenger car whose 60-HP (DIN) four-cylinder engine with 2.2 litres (134 in3) displacement was converted for the "M" system. The combustion system which is being widely used in commercial vehicle engines possesses advantageous fea- tures which make it attractive for use in passenger cars on account of its inherently low fuel consumption and noise level. The author describes modifications of the combus- tion process which enable substantial improvements to be achieved in exhaust gas quality. 770435. An Adaptive Sense Amplifier for Engine Control Applications. David K. Long, National Semi- conductor. The accuracy limitations of variable reluctance magnetic pick-ups can be overcome with the aid of a new monolithic integrated circuit. The new circuit, which uses a variable threshold sense amplifier and zero crossing detector, is described in some detail. Application to a microprocessor spark control system is described and interfacing techniques are discussed. 770436. How to Train Drivers in Skid Control. Nathaniel H. Pulling, Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. This paper explains the various types of skids and how to control them in cars and tractor-trailer trucks. Specific instructions are provided for classroom presentation, and for conducting hands-on-the-wheel practice sessions on a skid training area, using both cars and tractor-trailer trucks. Detailed directions are included for constructing a skid pan and modifying vehicles for skid control training. Essentially this paper is a condensed manual for setting up driver training instruction for skid control. 770437. (SP-416) Time Dependence of Polymer Oils Shear Thinning Theoretical and Practical Con- sequences. Jacques P. R. du Parquet, Compagnie FranÃ§aise de Raffinage, Total Technique, Centre de Recherches. Theoretical analysis supported by specially designed experiments show that the viscosity loss of polymer thickened oils is basically a time dependent phenomenon. Depending on the value of the residence time of the oil in the contact and on the critical degradation time cor- responding to the shear severity, it is possible to describe the case of EHD contacts such as gears and HD contacts such as plain bearings. The results have theoretical and practical conse- 75</page><page sequence="61">770438 - 770446 quences. In particular the viscosity in EHD contacts could be much lower than usually supposed. A better under- standing of mechanical shear is expected from the proposed approach. 770438. Applications of Industrial Robots That Can See. Ronald Potter, Auto-Place, Inc. Industrial robots, used to perform routine functions such as loading and unloading parts, have helped to alleviate the problems of worker boredom and job dissatisfaction. The Auto-Place limited sequence robots have been linked with both laser and video camera technology to produce robots with visual capability, which can perform inspec- tion, gaging, sorting, assembly, and positioning tasks. These robots are described and typical industrial appli- cations of them are discussed. 1977 SA E Transactions 770440. Application of Numerical Optimization to the Design of Supercritical Airfoils without Drag- Creep. Raymond M. Hicks and Garret N. Vanderplaats, Ames Research Center, NASA. Recent applications of numerical optimization to the design of advanced airfoils for transonic aircraft have shown that low-drag sections can be developed for a given design Mach number without an accompanying drag increase at lower Mach numbers. This is achieved by imposing a constraint on the drag coefficient at an off-design Mach number while the drag at the design Mach number is the objective function. Such a procedure doubles the computation time over that for single design-point problems, but the final result is worth the increased cost of computation. The ability to treat such multiple design-point problems by numerical optimization has been enhanced by the development of improved airfoil shape functions. Such functions permit a consid- erable increase in the range of profiles attainable during the optimization process. 770441. Flight Test Data for Light Aircraft Spoiler Roll Control Systems. David L. Kohlman, University of Kansas. The results of flight tests to determine the characteristics of spoiler roll control systems on three different light aircraft are summarized. Comparisons are made with wind tunnel data where available. Flight tests indicate that excellent roll characteristics can be achieved with spoilers. Yaw coupling with roll control inputs is virtually elimi- nated. Roll rates remain high when flaps are deployed at low speed. Very mild nonlinearities in control effec- tiveness exist and there was no deadband or lag detected. 770442. Studies of Flow Separation and Stalling on One- and Two-Element Airfoils at Low Speeds. H. C. Seetharam and W. H. Wentz, Jr., Wichita State University. Research has been conducted on the nature of airfoil behavior at pre- and post-separated angles of attack. Detailed wind tunnel studies have been made of boundary layer and wake fields for the GA(W)-1 airfoil, and the airfoil with a 0.3 chord Fowler flap. Experimental data are compared with theoretical predictions from a multi- element viscous flow computer program. Theoretical predictions are reasonably accurate for unseparated flows, but have serious errors when separation is present. Some recent techniques for modeling post-separated flow behavior are discussed in light of the present experiments. 1977 SA E Transactions 770443. Propeller Aircraft Flyover Noise Testing. James C. Shreve, Wallace Div., Cessna Aircraft Co. Flyover noise testing of propeller aircraft requires specific instrumentation and test procedures to comply with U.S. and Foreign regulations. This paper presents represen- tative techniques and equipment used in conducting these tests. 770444. The Influence of Design Parameters on Light Propeller Aircraft Noise. Ronald K. Rathgeber and Douglas E. Sipes, Cessna Aircraft Co. Through research and test work, the aircraft industry has gained a better knowledge of the design parameters which influence the noise produced by light propeller driven aircraft. The parameters found to have a major affect on the noise include: propeller tip speed, propeller blade tip thickness, and engine exhaust system characteristics. To date, many special design considerations such as geared or shrouded propellers have not proven effective in reducing noise levels. When developing an aircraft for reduced noise, its cost, performance, and utility must be consid- ered. 770445. Interior Noise Analysis and Control for Light Aircraft. John S. Mixson and C. Kearney Barton, NASA Langley Research Center; and Rimas Vaicaitis, Columbia University. This paper describes experimental and analytical studies of the interior noise of twin-engine, propeller-driven, light aircraft. Experimental results indicate that interior noise levels due to propeller noise can be reduced by reduction of engine rpm at constant airspeed (about 3 dB), by synchronization of the twin engines/propellers (up to 12 dB), and by increasing the distances from propeller tip to fuselage. The analytical model described uses modal methods and incorporates the flat-sided geometrical and skin-stringer structural features of light aircraft. Initial results show good agreement with measured noise trans- mitted into a rectangular box through a flat panel. 770446. Noise Effects on Passenger Communication in Light Aircraft. John A. Rupf, Joint Inst, for Advancement of Flight Sciences, George Wash- ington University. This paper considers the effect of noise on conversation between two persons seated in a close, side-by-side position such as in a small aircraft. Twelve pairs of 76</page><page sequence="62">770447 - 770452 subjects were required to converse while being exposed to noises of various levels and spectra similar to those currently found in general aviation aircraft. After a period of noise exposure, subjects rated the disruptive effect of the noise on conversation and judged the acceptability of the noise. Subjective estimates of the maximum times for pleasant conversation in the noises were also obtained. 770447. Environmental Considerations for Avionics In- stallation. A. J. Hauter, Rockwell International. The Reliability Engineering Discipline was established more than 20 years ago and today is an accepted science in virtually all major companies. Application of the reliability discipline has been almost totally dedicated to the design/build/test areas on the apparent assumption that when the equipment leaves the manufacturing facility it has a fixed "designed-in" reliability level which will be experienced by all users. Unfortunately this rather idealistic assumption does not hold true. The purpose of this paper is to examine only briefly what the traditional reliability program accomplishes, and then to describe, both qualitatively and (where possible) quantitatively, the other factors which have a significant impact on equipment field reliability performance levels. 770448. Flight Inspection Packages and Interface Prob- lems. Albert I. Lorenzen, Rockwell Interna- tional, Collins Radio Group. The necessity to perform aerial inspection of ground based navigation aids has been established beyond doubt. The adequacy of equipment available to perform this mission is not as clearly defined. Problems encountered over several years of direct experience are illustrated with the conclusion that end-users may have purchased products that will not meet flight inspection requirements. The major areas of concern in providing a total FIS package are the airframe, the primary radios, and the support equipment. Console design is complicated by the necessity of interfacing with numerous airframe config- urations. A need exists to coordinate the efforts of airframe manufacturers, black-box suppliers, and in- stallers to provide safe dependable systems capable of performing the intended mission. 770449. Comparison of Predicted with Measured Aero- dynamic Characteristics of the ATLIT Airplane. F. O. Smetana, Mechanical and Aerospace Engrg., North Carolina State Univ. Flight test results are compared with predictions of the lift and drag of a light, twin-engine aircraft developed through the use of computerized analytical methods. Both lift and drag are higher than predicted at a given angle of attack. A rigging error of 1.5Â° could be responsible for the higher lift at a = 0. The experimental lift slope is 14 percent higher than 2m, an effect thought to be due to energetic propeller slipstreams which are not treated by the theory. Several interference and protuberance effects not included in the theory are thought to be responsible for the higher than predicted drag. 770450. An Inverse Method For The Design Of Airfoils With Supercritical Flow. B. Eggleston, The de Havilland Aircraft of Canada, Limited. An iterative-direct method is described for designing airfoils with regions of supercritical flow which are nearly shockless. The method uses a wave analysis diagram in the supercritical region to determine design values leading to near shockless characteristics. The pressure distributions are calculated using an available viscous, supercritical method which solves the full, non-linear potential equa- tions for transonic flow. Repeated application of the method enables airfoils to be designed with good off- design behaviour. Results are presented for the design of an 18% thick airfoil and it appears that drag rise Mach numbers about 0.74 are feasible at a lift coefficient of 0.35. 770451. Propeller Design by Numerical Optimization. Joel P. Mendoza, NASA-Ames Research Center. A computer program designed to optimize propeller characteristics was developed by combining two main programs: the first is the optimization program based on the gradient algorithm; the second is based on a propeller blade element theory and uses an aerodynamics sub- program to approximate the lift and drag characteristics of the NACA 16-series airfoil section. To evaluate the propeller program alone (with its aerodynamics sub- program), propeller characteristics were computed and compared to those from wind tunnel investigations conducted on three different NACA propellers. Although the thrust and power coefficients which were computed using the blade element theory were generally higher than the experimental results for two of the three propellers, the corresponding efficiencies showed good agreement for all three propellers. The propeller optimization program was then used to study the NACA 4-(5) (08)-03 propeller at various Mach numbers from 0.175 to 0.60. Improvements in propeller efficiency and thrust were obtained through the use of the propeller optimization program. 1977 SA E Transactions 770452. Simplified Methods for Determining Stresses and Deflections of Thin Laminated Composite Plates. Bert L. Smith, Wichita State University. This paper contains the results from three different methods for determining deflections and stress resultants of thin laminated composite plates subjected to lateral loads and uniform temperature changes. The first method is a classical method using the method of Ritz, and the results are considered exact; however, this method is cumbersome and not practical. The other two methods are more practical but in many instances produce approx- imate results. Each of these two simplified methods reduces the composite to a single orthotopic layer which is "equivalent" to the composite. The results from the two 77</page><page sequence="63">770453 - 770462 simplified methods are compared with the results from the exact method. 770453. Optimal Design of Composite-Material Panels for Business Aircraft. Charles W. Bert, School of Aerospace, Mechanical, and Nuclear Engrg., Univ. of Oklahoma. Simple design equations and optimal design procedures have been developed for determination of the optimal lamination arrangement for flat panels of filamentary composite materials under a variety of design criteria. The design criteria include buckling and material failure under uniaxial compression, fundamental frequency of free vibration and panel flutter. The equations are applied to the design of a panel typical of business aircraft and subjected to multiple design criteria. 770454. The Influence of Curriculum on Aerospace De- sign Decisions. Howard W. Smith, University of Kansas. Structural design decisions, materials selections, and the choice of analysis methods used in practice are derived from the engineer's education and experience. Details of two new aerospace structural technical elective courses; Composite Materials, and Crashworthiness, are presented to illustrate how new ideas may be introduced into the crowded aero engineering curriculum. Details of some courses in aero structures and materials are presented in the appendix. Close coordination between engineering educators and engineers in practice will result in improved course content, and better design decisions in the future. 770455. Aeroelastically Tailored Propellers. W. J. Dwyer and J. B. Rogers, Dept. of Aerospace Engrg. and Engrg. Mechanics, University of Texas at Aus- tin. An analytical investigation into the possible improvement of aircraft propeller performance that may be obtained by employing high strength filamentary composite materials to modify the elastic characteristics of the blades was conducted. The orientation of the individual fibers with respect to the axis of the blade was chosen to induce a coupling between the centrifugal force acting on the blade and the shearing strain in the plane of the blade cross section. The shearing strain changes the pitch of the blade as the rotational speed of the propeller is varied. This change in pitch is then optimized to broaden the band of flight speeds over which the propeller operates efficiently. Results for the analytical model indicate that the efficiency of non-controllable pitch propellers may be improved by 5% at the design condition and as much as 20% at off-design conditions. Furthermore, the results indicate a significant increase in the band of flight speeds over which the propeller operates efficiently. In addition, a 5% increase in efficiency throughout the applicable range of flight conditions was determined for controllable pitch propellers employing composite blades in place of rigid blades. 770459. A Prediction Method for Spoiler Performance. G. V. Parkinson, P. Tarn Doo and R. Bernier, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, University of British Columbia (Canada). An analytical method has been developed by which the steady-state lift, pitching moment, and rolling moment produced by upper surface spoilers on wings can be predicted. Potential flow is assumed and a lifting-line theory is used, incorporating sectional characteristics calculated by a thin-airfoil theory. Sectional pressure distributions can also be predicted by a thick-airfoil theory. The only empirical data needed is the spoiler base pressure. Good agreement between predicted and meas- ured values has been obtained. 1977 SA E Transactions 770460. Recent Conceptual Design Studies of Single Turbofan Engine Aircraft. Edward T. Schairer, NASA Ames Research Center. Recently three NASA-sponsored conceptual design stud- ies considered the feasibility of using advanced turbofan engines to power civil two-seat trainer and four-seat utility-type aircraft. The first of these studies was performed by an engine manufacturer, Garrett Corpo- ration, who developed conceptual turbofan engine models of appropriate design and cycle. Garrett also produced several preliminary airplane designs, including a two-seat trainer and a four-seat utility airplane. Subsequent studies were performed by two general aviation airframe manu- facturers, Cessna Aircraft Company and Gates Learjet Corporation. Each airframe manufacturer developed a preliminary airplane configuration (either two or four place) designed to be powered by one of Garrett's conceptual turbofan engines. The purpose of this paper is to summarize and compare the configurations which emerged from these studies. Emphasis is placed on identifying the sensitivities of each design to performance constraints, aerodynamic assumptions, and weight estimation techniques. 770461. In-Flight Measurements of the GA(W)-2 Aero- dynamic Characteristics. G. M. Gregorek, M. J. Hoffmann and G. S. Weislogel, The Ohio State University; and G. M. Vogel, Beech Aircraft Corporation. Flight tests of a new 13% General Aviation Airfoil - the GA(W)-2 - gloved full span onto the existing wing of a Beech Sundowner have generated chordwise pressure distributions and wake surveys. Section lift, drag and moment coefficients derived from these measurements verify wind tunnel data and theory predicting the performance of this airfoil. The effect of steps, rivets and surface coatings upon the drag of the GA(W)-2 was also evaluated. 770462. Investigation of Stress Effects Between Equal Diameter Holes in a Perforated Strip. Leonard 78</page><page sequence="64">770463 - 770469 Lachmann and Gerald J. Smith, Jr., Pawnee Div., Cessna Aircraft Co. Solutions developed by Chih-Bing Ling in two dimen- sional elasticity are used to investigate stresses in a perforated strip under pure tension. Results of a strain gage test show close correlation with the two dimensional theory of elasticity. A series of curves are plotted to show the effects of stress for various configurations of hole size, hole spacing, and strip width. Areas of investigation are between the holes and at ninety degrees to the tensile axis. 770463. General Aviation Fatigue Loads - A Comparison of Analytical and Recorded Spectra. Richard Abbott and Dennis L. Longhofer, Cessna Air- craft Co. Measured fatigue load spectra (in terms of stress ex- ceedance data) for two business aircraft operations are compared to the analytical spectra. The in-service load measuring procedure using mechanical strain gages is presented. The analytical methods, and the conclusions which may be drawn from the comparisons are discussed. 770464. Evaluation of Empennage Fatigue Loads for the Beech Super King Air Using a Flight Simulator. A. K. Agnihotri, Beech Aircraft Corp. Fatigue analysis of the Beech Super King Air empennage was performed in compliance with the Australian and British certification requirements. The empennage fatigue loads for this analysis were evaluated with the use of an engineering flight simulator. The empennage balance, maneuvering, and gust loads for both the horizontal and vertical tail were determined for various flight conditions. These loads were used for analytical prediction of safe life of the empennage structure. 770465. A Computer Technique for the Determination of Brake Horsepower Output of Normally-Aspirated Reciprocating Aircraft Engines. Hubert C. Smith and Mark E. Dreier, Pennsylvania State Uni- versity. This paper develops a set of seven general equations which describe various portions of a standard engine performance chart. A regression analysis technique is then employed to evaluate the constants in these equations which identifies them to a particular engine. Computer programs which employ this technique are provided. A final program is provided which utilizes the equations to yield a value of brake horsepower for an input of any combination of RPM, manifold air pressure, air temper- ature, and pressure altitude. 770466. Automotive Engines - A Viable Alternative for Aircraft. John T. Camden, Geschwender Aero- motive Inc. The current status of automotive liquid-cooled aircraft engine conversions is described with respect to the air-cooled powerplants they replace. A brief historical background is included along with information on some of the most recent applications of automotive engines in aircraft. The gains in efficiency, improvement in per- formance, and reduction of noise level, vibration, and cost are plus factors to be considered when comparing automotive engine conversions to conventional air-cooled aircraft engines. 770467. An Investigation of the Aerodynamics and Cooling of a Horizontally-Opposed Engine In- stallation. S. J. Miley, Dept. of Aerophysics and Aerospace Engrg., Mississippi State Univ.; E. J. Cross, Jr. and J. K. Owens, Mississippi State Univ. A research program to investigate the aerodynamics of reciprocating aircraft engine cooling installations is discussed. Current results from a flight test program are presented concerning installation flow measurement methods. The influence of different inlet designs on installation cooling effectiveness and efficiency are de- scribed. 1977 SA E Transactions 770468. A Study of Simplified Methods for Longitudinal Control Decoupling. Randall Joslin, Hideaki Ohmiya and David R. Ellis, Princeton Univer- sity. Using an inflight simulator, a simple longitudinal de- coupling concept was compared with conventional air- plane characteristics for the approach and landing tasks. The decoupling system allowed the pilot to command flight path angle changes with the stick with little or no accompanying speed change; likewise, speed changes with only small accompanying flight path changes could be made with throttle only. The unique feature of the concept is that it is an open loop (that is, non-feedback) control system. Results indicate that in calm air and up to moderate levels of turbulence the decoupling system provides a substantial reduction in pilot workload. The program was supported by NASA, Langley Research Center, under Grant NSG 1234. 770469. Flying Qualities Design of the Northrop YF-17 Fighter Prototypes. J. T. Gallagher and W. E. Nelson, Jr., Members, Technical Management, Northrop Corporation, Aircraft Group. The flying qualities design of the Northrop YF-17 lightweight fighter was based on in-flight and ground- based simulation data. In this paper some of the more significant design aspects of the flying qualities are discussed. The need for highly responsive uncoupled maneuvering capability in fighter aircraft is identified. The solution used in the YF-17 is presented. A brief description of the airplane and its flight control system is followed by a discussion of the generation of the flying qualities criteria in the preliminary design phase of the airplane's development. The key part played by ground- based and in-flight simulation data is identified. This is followed by a discussion on the use of the Northrop Large 79</page><page sequence="65">770470 - 770477 Amplitude Flight Simulator in the refinement of the flying qualities criteria and the development of the flight control system, to satisfy the criteria. Subsequent successful flight test of two YF-17 prototypes validated the use of the simulator in the design process. 770470. Flight Test Evaluation of a Method to Determine the Level Flight Performance of a Propeller- Driven Aircraft. Phillip D. Bridges, Dr. Ernest J. Cross, Jr. and Donald W. Boatwright, Missis- sippi State University. A flight test method has been developed for determining the level flight drag and propulsive efficiency of propel- ler-driven aircraft. The overall drag of the aircraft is expressed in terms of the measured increment of power required to overcome a corresponding known increment of drag, which is generated by a towed drogue. The simplest form of the governing equations, D = =D SHP/=SHP, is such that all of the parameters on the right side of the equation can be measured in flight. An evaluation of the governing equations has been performed using data generated by flight test of a Beechcraft T-34B. 770471. Utilization of Separate Surface Control Systems on General Aviation Aircraft. Jan Roskam, Dept. of Aerospace Engrg., University of Kansas. The paper summarises the work done by the University of Kansas Flight Research Laboratory on separate surface control systems. Theory, potential applications and a summary of the state-of-the-art of separate flight control technology are discussed. 770472. Drag Evaluation of the Bellanca Skyrocket II. G. M. Gregorek and M. J. Hoffmann, The Ohio State University; H. E. Payne and J. P. Harris, Bellanca Aircraft Engineering. The Bellanca Skyrocket II, possessor of five world speed records, is a single engine aircraft with high performance that has been attributed to a laminar flow airfoil and an all composite structure. Utilization of composite materials in the Skyrocket II is unique since this selection was made to increase the aerodynamic efficiency of the aircraft. Flight tests are in progress to measure the overall aircraft drag and the wing section drag for comparison with the predicted performance of the Skyrocket. Initial results show the zero lift drag is indeed low, with = 0.016. 770473. Investigation of a Stall Deterrent System Util- izing an Acoustic Stall Sensor. A. G. Bennett and J. K. Owens, Mississippi State University; and R. L. Harris, NASA Langley Research Center. A simple rugged acoustic stall sensor which has an output proportional to angle of attack near wing stall has been evaluated on a Cessna 319 aircraft. A sensor position has been found on the wing where the sensor output is only slightly affected by engine power level, yaw angle, flap position and wing roughness. The NASA LRC General Aviation Simulator has been used to evaluate the acoustic sensor output as a control signal for active stall deterrent systems. It has been found that a simple control algorithm is sufficient for stall deterrence. 770474. The Controlwing Aircraft. George G. Spratt, Spratt Co., Inc. A new concept in aircraft control and stability has been developed having greater control effectiveness than the Aileron, rudder, elevator system. It is structurally simple having no movable vanes subject to flutter. There are no stall or spin characteristics. This system has natural gust-alleviation properties and as there are but two primary controls no coordination is needed in piloting. 770475. Comparison of a New Method for Measuring Aircraft Power and Drag in Flight with a Stan- dard Technique. Frederick O. Smetana and Stan R. Fox, Dept. of Mechanical and Aerospace Engrg., North Carolina State Univ. Drag and power information extracted by a new method from accelerated flight test data on an advanced tech- nology light twin airplane are compared with drag results taken by the usual speed-power method. Agreement is fair at low angles of attack and poor at high angles of attack. The new method requires accurate input data for good results and some inconsistencies still remain in these data. As a consequence, the results obtained by the new method must be regarded as tentative at this time. 770477. An Inexpensive Electronic Method for Measuring Takeoff and Landing Distances. F. D. Schick, FAA Central Region Flight Test. The Gates Leaijet airplanes are certificated under the F.A.R. 25 Transport Category airplane rules, the same as most other business jets, and all the Jumbos and Wide-Bodied jets. Takeoff and landing field lengths must be measured in the certification process and had been measured at Leaijet since its beginning with a portable photo theodolite owned by the FAA. The search for a modern replacement for that device progressed through the expensive photographic devices in use currently by the large airplane manufacturers to a relatively inexpensive system; completely electronic, acceptably accurate, and simple to use. The system consists of a Del Norte Technology, Inc., Trisponder for measuring horizontal distance and a Sperry AA-220 Radio Altimeter for measuring height. The outputs of those devices are recorded on a magnetic tape data acquisition system. The data are computer reduced and plotted much faster than any photographic reduction. The only system component which was not in the Gates Learjet inventory at the time was the Trisponder, so the theodolite replacement system was operational for a cost of about $19,000, which is less than half of what a complete photographic system would have cost. 1977 SA E Transactions 80</page><page sequence="66">770479 - 770488 770479. An Approach to Subsonic, Turbulent Flow Airfoil Design Using Mini-Computers. J. C. Narramore, Cessna Aircraft Co. An airfoil design method has been developed which, with the aid of a mini-computer, can be used to determine the velocity distributions that will produce desired design parameters (lift, drag, and pitching moment) at the design condition and test for boundary layer separation. Use of a generalized equation for the velocity allows the design parameters to be determined as a function of coefficients of an integrated expression. Therefore, any series of general velocity distributions can be analyzed and the best one for the design mission selected. 1977 SA E Transactions 770480. A Computer Operational Analysis of AG-Plane Operation to Evaluate Design Parameters. Ken- neth Razak, Engineering Consultant; and Mel- vin H. Snyder, Wichita State University. Field studies of agricultural airplane operations indicated that airplane design parameters significantly affected aircraft productivity. Limitation of material discharge rate, while still securing uniform distribution pattern of ejected material, appeared to be a serious factor in restricting markets and holding down productivity. A computer program was written to explore possible gains from optimizing design parameters in a given market, to determine improvements which would result from extending the range of design parameters, and to study the effects of different operating procedures. The program actually "flies" an airplane through all steps of a mission. A mission is defined as a complete working day from preparation for first take-off to shutting down after last landing. All flight operations are defined in terms of airplane specifications and design parameters. Comparison of productivity and profitability of airplanes currently being used was made with paper designs, some of which incorporated features as boundary layer control and high rate material ejection. Productivity, in terms of acres covered per operating hour, and profits show definite improvements with expanded design pa- rameters. 770481. Use of Simplified Flow Separation Criteria for Slotted Flap Preliminary Design. W. H. Wentz, Jr., Wichita State University. From experimental correlations of airfoil and flap pres- sure distributions, it is observed that flow separation is likely 1 to occur when the canonical pressure recovery coefficient (Cpr) exceeds a critical value. A procedure is described for obtaining the Cpr parameter from modified inviscid analysis. The procedure has been applied to preliminary design studies of a new slotted flap to determine the influence of shape and location. Exper- iments are planned to evaluate the flap designed by this procedure. 1977 SA E Transactions 770482. Evaluation of a Radio-Control Model for Spin Simulation. M. L. Holcomb and R. R. Tum- linson, Beech Aircraft Corp. The radio-control (R/C) model is being developed as a tool for spin research of general aviation airplanes. This paper discusses the construction, instrumentation, and tests of a 1/6 scale radio-control model of the Beech YT-34C. Spin test results are compared for the R/C model, spin tunnel model, and full-scale airplane. Possible explanations for differences in spin characteristics are discussed. Future R/C model test plans are outlined. 770484. Crash Simulation of Skin-Frame Structures using a Finite Element Code. Robert Winter, Allan B. Pifko and Harry Armen, Jr., Grumman Aero- space Corporation. A mathematical model for crash simulation of aircraft structures - built up from beams, stringers, and skin panels - is being developed in the form of a finite element, large displacement elastic-plastic computer code called DYCAST. As a preliminary exercise, the code was applied to simulate a low-speed forward impact of a skin-covered framework carrying large concentrations of nonstructural mass at its rear. This paper describes the main features of the code and the results of the simple preliminary simulation. 770485. Cabin Safety by Crash Survival. Richard W. Nelson, Federal Aviation Administration, U.S. Dept. of Transportation. This paper briefly traces development of crashworthiness requirements promulgated in pertinent airworthiness standards for general aviation aircraft. Primary emphasis is focused on protection of aircraft occupants in the survivable crash environment. The evolution of government involvement in civil aviation and the FAA role in aviation safety are discussed, as well as the regulatory rulemaking process. A review of past and present crash protection requirements is pre- sented. Pending regulatory action and future goals are mentioned. 770486. Weather Radar for Light Centerline Thrust Aircraft. Jim Grandfield and Bruce Barrett, Cessna Aircraft Co. An airborne weather radar installation has been devel- oped for light centerline thrust aircraft. A pod was developed and tested to attach to the underside of the wing and provide a location for a light weight antenna- receiver-transmitter unit. The offering of this installation to operators of these aircraft provides additional capa- bility in the detection and avoidance of significant weather systems. 770488. High Fuel Economy in an Aircraft Piston Engine When Operating Ultralean. J. E. Chirivella, Jet Propulsion Laboratory; L. A. Duke, AVCO - 81</page><page sequence="67">770501 -770506 Lycoming Division; and W. A. Menard, Jet Propulsion Laboratory. This paper presents the results of Phase II of the Hydrogen Enrichment for Aircraft Piston Engines Pro- gram. The overall program, and specifically the Phase I results, have been discussed by Menard et. al. previously. In Phase II, a Lycoming T10-541-E engine was equipped with a gasoline operated hydrogen generator and installed on the dynamometer stand of the experimental facility at AVCO-Lycoming Division. A matrix of lean-out curves at sea level for different spark advances, hydrogen en- richment rates and power levels were obtained. An analysis of these data shows that while the lean-out to very low equivalence ratios with hydrogen enrichment does not present any difficulty, it seems that for certain types of engines one may achieve even better results with gasoline only, if the engine is properly timed. It has been found also that in this ultralean region, power recovery can be achieved by boosting the manifold pressure without exceeding the engine red line temperatures even at relatively high powers. Test cell altitude checks confirm the possibility of utilizing certain ultralean techniques at useful altitudes, without overheating the engine or inducing detonation. The hydrogen generator flight model and the engine were installed in the flight configuration of the flight test stand. Fuel economy measurements and limited emission measurements were obtained on the flight test stand, in order to spot check the dynamometer results and the potential for reduced emissions. It has become evident that with proper timing, one can run the engine ultralean (fuel/air ratios as low as 0.05) with gasoline only during a steady-state operation without sacrificing performance (except for critical altitude). Under such conditions, fuel economy improvements of up to 20% have been obtained. The emission measurements conducted so far appear to indicate that, if these techniques can be implemented during taxi, idle, and approach, it may be possible to meet the Federal Emissions Standards. 770501. Operation and Benefits of a Tailgate for Off Highway Rear Dump Trucks. L. B. (Phil) Philippi, Philippi-Hagenbuch, Inc., Ltd. Installation of tailgates can increase the load capacity of haulage trucks and also reduce spillage, fuel consumption, tire wear, and haul road upkeep. This concept is not new, but the first hinged, swinging type tailgates required much maintenance and were not well suited for earthmoving. This paper describes the design and development of the AUTOGATE, an automatic, high clearance tailgate with variable width, which can be adjusted to fit a variety of trucks and which functions effectively in many earth- moving applications. 770502. Design and Development of a 425 Flywheel Horsepower Crawler Tractor. L. L. Bandy, Crawler Tractors Engineering, Fiat-Allis CMI. 1976 saw Fiat-Allis introduce the 425 flywheel horsepower (317 kW) 31 Crawler Tractor. This tractor was designed to utilize many existing components from the 41-B, 41 and 21-C Crawler Tractors in order to minimize development time, tooling expenditure and warranty cost risk. 770503.

A rationale for selecting nuclear power for this station is also presented. 770506. Effective Utilization of Horsepower in Mined Land Reclamation Efforts (Part 3). John Goris, Spokane Mining Res. Ctr., Bureau of Mines; and J. W. Howland, Pittsburg &amp; Midway Coal Mining Co. A search for new tools, methods and techniques to improve overall efficiency in the land reclamation effort was instituted by The Pittsburg &amp; Midway Coal Mining Company, more than six years ago. Although early developments were encouraging, progress was rather slow and very costly. Approximately two years ago, the United States Bureau of Mines joined forces with P&amp;M in a program designed to fully test and evaluate early P&amp;M dirt moving concepts and other concepts as well. The resultant Specialized Reclamation Field Test has primarily centered on the field test and evaluation of high volume lateral relocation blades designed to improve dirt handling efficiency in the short distance (less than fifty feet) relocation ranges associated with leveling area-mined spoil banks. Field tests have demonstrated the effec- tiveness of these tools in reducing land leveling and shaping costs by approximately fifty percent by compar- ison with conventional bulldozer land reclamation tech- niques. A total of 1,431 acres of area-mined spoil banks was reclaimed during the test program. The prototype blades have verified the soundness of this technological approach to a serious problem con- fronting the mining industry and our nation. The current challenge is to improve this developing technology and transfer it to active mining areas. 1977 SA E Transactions 82</page><page sequence="68">770508 -770517 770508. Industrial Design and the Engineer. William O. Smart, Caterpillar Tractor Co.

It is the objective of this paper to define Industrial Design and its relationship to Engineering, illustrate its thinking process, and describe the Industrial Designer's roll in product design and development. 770509. Computer Automation of Soil Dynamics Re- search. Robert L. Schafer and Alvin C. Bailey, National Tillage Machinery Laboratory, ARS, USD A. The rapid development of computer technology in the past few years, combined with the accompanying reduc- tion of costs, has resulted in the availability of a very powerful tool to researchers. A real-time multipro- gramming digital computer system has been in use at the NTML for six years. This system supports 90 percent of the data acquisition, analysis, storage, and display, and it has had considerable impact on the research program. 770510. New Techniques for Data Acquisition in Struc- tural Testing. Michael H. Packard and John Paschkewitz, Harnischfeger Corp. Minicomputer application to data acquisition processing has become available in recent years due to lower costs and component miniaturization. Here we describe how a minicomputer is used in the static testing of construction cranes. In our system, the computer is not only used to process data in a special report format, but is used to control the analog data input and signal conditioning as well. Various factors considered in selection of the instrument system are also presented. 770511. A New Test Control and Data Acquisition System for Experimental Testing of Automatic Trans- missions. M. D. Smith and B. R. Trewartha, Detroit Diesel Allison, Division of General Motors Corporation. A new computerized test control and data acquisition system for experimental testing of transmissions has been developed. The purpose of the test system is to provide a better transmission product by facilitating test activities, which include performance, development, and durability testing. The test system is capable of handling many different models of automatic and powershift transmis- sions, Varying in size, horsepower, and complexity. The system is dedicated to test cell operation and is not used for non-test-related functions. It is a mini- computer-distributed system commonly referred to as a hierarchical system. The system consists of satellite, intermediate, and host computer levels. It is used in conjunction with ten engine-powered test stands and six DC-dynamometer-powered test stands. This paper covers operating and system features of the overall test system. SAE Transactions 770512. Oil Friction Retention Measured by Caterpillar Oil Test No. TO-2. John A. McLain, Engrg. Test and Evaluation G.O., Caterpillar Tractor Co. Increased slip time during shifts with bronze-on-steel friction material occurred in power shift transmissions. This condition caused slow response and overheated friction surfaces. Full scale laboratory testing in a D7E track-type Tractor setup was conducted. Oil formulations with poor field performance gave the same relative results in the laboratory test work. The Oil Test No. TO-2 was developed using the SAE No. 2 Friction Test Device. Correlation of the Oil Test No. TO-2 data with the full scale laboratory data is shown. Finally, reference oil data from the independent test laboratories using the Oil Test No. TO-2 is included to show the reproducibility and repeatability of the Oil Test No. TO-2. 770513. Development of Type C-3 Torque Fluid for Heavy-Duty Power Shift Transmissions. C. R. Potter and R. H. Schaefer, Detroit Diesel Allison, Division of General Motors Corpora- tion. The Type C-3 transmission fluid specification has been completed which defines tighter requirements for fluids used in heavy-duty off-highway automatic or power shift transmissions. A laboratory test program was conducted to develop and prove-out the uprated requirements. The C-3 specification now provides for control of the fluid's effect on clutch friction retention and durability. A redefined oxidation stability test has been included which calls for the use of test hardware that is more readily available. Seal-swell requirements were expanded to include the latest materials used in transmission seals. The cooperative efforts of the petroleum and additive indus- tries, along with Detroit Diesel Allison, are now providing an improved fluid for use in the latest off-highway heavy-duty transmissions. 770516.

The Effects of Government Regulations in British Columbia. W. F. (Jerry) Holmes, Finning Trac- tor &amp; Equipment Co. Ltd. The terrain, environmental extremes, and remoteness of work sites from population centers make logging, mining, 83</page><page sequence="69">770518 -770526 and construction more hazardous in British Columbia than in many other areas. Although this has resulted in greater concern for safety and more stringent controls, there was no single group coordinating their development at the provincial level until the Mobile Equipment Committee in 1973. This paper presents an overview of the establishment and status of regulations concerning brakes, steering, ROPS, and noise level; and their effect upon industry. The need for placing both federal and provincial regulations under the jurisdiction of a single adminis- trative body is emphasized. 770518. Falling Tree Test of Log Skidder ROPS. Douglas S.

The rationale used to select the tree is reviewed and estimates of the engineering characteristics of the tree are given. The results of a static deflection test to duplicate the residual deflection of the ROPS resulting from the falling tree test is also discussed. 1977 SA E Transactions 770519. Running Skyline Systems for Harvesting Timber on Steep Terrain. Charles N. Mann, Pacific Northwest Forest and Range Experiment Sta- tion, U.S. Dept. of Agriculture. Modern running skyline systems best meet current requirements for logging on steep terrain. These require- ments can be stated as the need to economically harvest timber over extended distances on a variety of terrain conditions in an environmentally acceptable manner. Three different methods of tensioning the running lines are used by the manufacturers of running skyline yarders. These include a non-interlocking method and two inter- locking methods. The best control and efficiency are obtained with a hydraulically controlled differential drive. 770520. Equipment Utilization - A Consumers9 View. Ralph L. Ohman and Donald V. Woods, Warren Brothers Co. Machine costs and utilization are the two most significant concerns that all equipment owners share. Utilization as referred to in this presentation is meant to include such terms as productivity, quality, reliability and availability. All of these elements have taken on a renewed emphasis in describing contractors' needs. This paper deals with the cause and effects of several important influences that contribute to optimum con- tractor effectiveness. An attempt is made to reflect factually on represen- tative repair costs and the added significance of down time in the field. Recognizable problems and subsequent high costs related to specific areas such as hydraulic systems and tire applications are reflected on. Manufacturers, their field distribution organizations and contractors as well, are joined in common objectives to overcome the negative influences of rising costs and maximizing equipment utilization. Outstanding gains have taken place in the past few decades and will continue through a mutual exchange of knowledge, experience and honest communication be- tween the manufacturing and construction industries. The essential ingredient to achieve optimum con- struction equipment performance is people performance - You, I, our counterparts and the endless number of supportive groups that enter into the total performance picture. 770522. Evaluation Engineering - The Customer's Rep- resentative. L. Wayne G. Collins, John Deere Dubuque Works. The evaluation engineer represents the customer in the product engineering department. He applies the principles of Human Engineering to the man/machine relationship. The compatability of a machine with its intended purpose is measured and optimized. He looks at the total machine balance on the scale of Product Effectiveness per Customer Dollar. The development of a jury evaluation system with a five point numerical rating scale provides some objectivity to subjective comments. Field testing on customer job sites is a valuable method of assessing the product effectiveness while it is still in the experimental stages of development. 770523. Civil Engineering Considerations in Earth Mov- ing. Keith F. Faherty, Univ. of Wisconsin- Platteville. Principles of economics, engineering, and physics are applied to earthwork problems. Rolling resistance, the swell and shrinkage of soils, the compaction of soil, and the effect of low air pressure are briefly discussed and applied to example problems. One earthwork task to which queueing theory has been applied is given. 770525. Designing with an Engineering Data Base. Thomas L. Raab, TEREX Div., General Motors Corp. The process of designing a vehicle to perform a specific set of functions usually involves many iterations through a series of interrelated events. This paper examines the use of an engineering data base and management system to coordinate, process and document the normal design cycle to develop products of nearly optimum design with a minimum of component redesigns. 770526. Interactive Graphics System in Design Drafting and Manufacturing. Daniel M. McNeill, Auto- trol Corp. The use of mini-computers to aid in design, drafting, and manufacturing is increasing. The breakthroughs which have made this approach practical for both small and large companies are discussed. Criteria for selecting 84</page><page sequence="70">770527 - 770535 mini-computers are outlined and ways to introduce their implementation successfully are suggested. 770527. Use of a Data Acquisition System in Static Stress Analysis. T. J. Lechlitner, TEREX Div., General Motors Corp. The Data Acquisition System, as used by the Static Stress Analysis group and others, is a tool designed to collect data rapidly and accurately. Its principal terminals are at a collection point and in a computer memory bank. Between these two terminals are signal conditioners which modify calibrated signals so that specific engi- neering functions, pounds per square inch (P.S.I.) (kPa); gallons per minute (G.P.M.) (L.P.M.) or specific degrees of temperature (FÂ° or CÂ°) are recorded. The static stress applications of the Data Acquisition System are often multipurpose: (1) Data is used to evaluate structural problems related to product use. (2) Data is used to provide confirmation of design on a pilot or preproduction model. (3) Data is used to feed an Engineering Data Base. This paper will attempt to show how these objectives can be achieved efficiently. 770528. Designer's Basic Guide to Welded Structure Performance. Victor A. Lucas, Caterpillar Trac- tor Co. The purpose of this paper is to provide designers with the basic ideas in evaluating the general metallurgical and mechanical conditions affecting the performance of welded structures and weldments. The effects of design and fabricating details are shown to ultimately determine performance, especially in the fatigue loadings induced in ground vehicles. Considerations in static, fatigue, and impact loadings are analyzed for each of these conditions. Factors considered are: base metal, weld metal, weld heat-affected zone, joint design, fit-up, residual stress, weld quality, and welding costs. The discussion is rather general and basic, although limited to the arc-welding of low-carbon structural steels. The primary intent is to provide Engineers new to weldment design with a foundation of information from which to build. Experienced structural designers, however, may also find it beneficial as a review or to restore perspective. 1977 SA E Transactions 770529. The Effect of Welding Metallurgy on Design. R. W. Cummins, John Deere Dubuque Works. Since there is no universally applicable guideline or formula for welding design and fabrication, it is difficult to determine if the metallurgical properties of a finished weld will perform in accordance with engineering re- quirements. Consideration of all five major factors influencing the weldability of a structure - type of steel, material thickness, weld gaps or tolerance buildup, size of weld, and type of welding process - is the basis of the method for selecting appropriate steels and joint designs that is described -in this paper. When used early in the design process along with such procedures as laboratory simulation, destructive testing, and metallurgical exami- nation, it can prevent design and material changes from appearing at later, costlier stages of production. 770530. Development of Welding Procedures for Oper- ator Protective Structures. R. T. Hemzacek, International Harvester Co. The development of a sound welding procedure should consider a number of very important aspects. The choice of basic welding variables can provide selective weld characteristics to best fit the design concept and produc- tion variables. Further, the development of these aspects into a viable welding procedure may be readily evaluated, in many instances, by performance testing of the weld- ment under conditions directly associated with the intended service. 770531. The Industrial Hydraulic Torque Converter. Wilbur F. Shurts, Twin Disc, Inc. The hydraulic torque converter has gained wide accep- tance in the power transmission system of construction and industrial machinery. The losses involved in this automatically and infinitely variable transmission are examined. Means of controlling the input and output power of the converter are described. 770534. An Equipment Division of a World-Wide Con- tractor. Pedro AlcebÃ­ades de Albuquerque and Arthur Valle Mendes, Construtora Mendes Junior S.A., Brazil. This paper will present the basic logistics support provided to the various projects by the Engineering Equipment Division of Construtora Mendes Junior, in Brazil and overseas. The subject matter is analyzed from the viewpoint of planning, programming, execution, control and the coordination of services such as materials and supplies, warehousing, maintenance, technical control, transport and operational technical training, for a popu- lation of over 2100 pieces of equipment, spread out over thirty projects, ranging from highways in the Amazon to roadways and railways in the Sahara. The difficulties encountered in these types of opera- tion, where resources are non-existant, resulted in high levels of auto-sufficiency requirements. This presentation will exemplify solutions to the problems. The application of a systemic focus in the field of operation will transpire. 770535. The Arctic Gas Pipeline and Its Specialized Equipment Requirements. James A. Harvie, Canadian Arctic Gas Study Ltd. In the fall of 1977 the governments of both the United States and Canada will make decisions concerning the 85</page><page sequence="71">770536 - 770543 transport of Arctic gas to southern markets. The Arctic Gas Proposal, which is the only one permitting Alaskan and Canadian gas to move through one system, is compared to others submitted for their consideration. The need for building the Arctic pipeline is discussed and the plans for its construction are outlined. The development of the Banister 812, an Arctic ditcher designed specifically to meet the requirements of this project, is also described. 770536. Utility Construction - A Growing Industry. William H. Feather, Jr., Quill Corp. Involved in implementing environmental programs such as the one established by the 1972 Federal Water Pollution Control Act, utility contractors are part of a growing industry which already accounts for annual equipment purchases worth millions of dollars. The problems encountered in this type of contracting and how they are affected by equipment design and maintenance are discussed. The major ways in which equipment manufacturers could improve their products and services to better provide for the needs of this industry are also outlined. 770537. Backhoe Bucket Design and Application. Donald J. Greer, ESCO Corp. The rapid, clean, and efficient removal of material characterizes the excavating back hoe. As with all digging implements, operating performance is directly dependant upon optimum design and specific application. This paper discusses those proven parameters that not only con- tribute to, but are essential to, bucket digging efficiency as evidenced by bucket design. Also being discussed are those factors which are pertinent to correctly match bucket design to job conditions in order to maximize machine utilization. 770538. Surface Irrigation Construction - Today and Fu- ture. John E. Rogert, Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Dept. of the Interior. The Bureau of Reclamation has provided irrigation water to western family farms for almost three-quarters of a century. This paper presents the details of providing water to the farm by discussing the major features of two large irrigation projects. On-farm problems and considerations involved with land preparation and alternative water delivery systems are discussed with emphasis on surface irrigation. The current position of surface irrigation in the United States is explored and predictions concerning irrigation's future are considered briefly. 770539. Power Sources for Center Pivot Irrigation. W. E. Splinter, Agricultural Engrg. Dept., Univ. of Nebraska. The development of the center pivot irrigation system has allowed a level of process control not previously attain- able in commercial agriculture. This form of irrigation now forms the dominant method for new lands going under irrigation. Consideration of alternative power sources leads to the conclusion that diesel engines will provide an increasing proportion of the power systems used for center pivots. The operational characteristics of these systems will require special consideration by engine manufacturers if they are to adequately meet performance requirements. 770540. The Latest Technology in Center Pivot Irrigation Equipment. Paul J. Feira, Irrigation Products Div., Valmont Industries, Inc. The latest technological developments in center pivot irrigation equipment, a steerable Corner System and low pressure sprinkler systems, are reviewed. A scenario of the microprocessor controlled system of the 1980's is drawn, and the feasibility of center pivots performing additional farming operations is examined. 770541. Supporting Information to be Gleaned from Laboratory Structural Fatigue Tests Such as KF, Life Estimates, Etc. Dwight F. Nelson, John Deere Dubuque Works. Structural lab tests are required at times to determine fatigue life. Added information can be gleaned from these tests which will be useful in future calculations and tests. The fatigue notch factor KF is one thing that can be obtained as well as a stress analysis study and comparison. 770542. Two Practical Approaches to Minimize Fatigue Test Time. G. E. Maroney and R. K. King, Fluid Power Res. Ctr., Oklahoma State Uni- versity. This paper discusses controlling load wave forms to minimize the length of fatigue tests. Contrary to popular opinion, the entire load form - not only the load peak amplitude and range - significantly affects the fatigue life of materials. This paper compares the use of increased load peaks with shortened load time to decrease the total time of fatigue tests. Tests to failure with realistic modes of failure are discussed. An interpretation procedure is given for data obtained with short load times. 1977 SA E Transactions 770543. Hydraulic Fluid Contaminant Sensitivity Test. Raymond J. Lobmeyer, Michael A. Kelley and Randall J. Chapman, John Deere Dubuque Works. The prediction of a hydraulic fluid's ability to minimize wear of a pump has been based on standard tests that relate film strength, load carrying capacity and the actual weight loss of pump components. The anti-wear properties of fluids used in mobile equipment hydraulic systems are characteristically eval- uated by these standard tests under relatively low contaminant level conditions. This paper presents a laboratory test method which evaluates hydraulic fluids based on their ability to minimize wear in the presence of entrained contaminant levels representative of actual severe service conditions. Test results are presented which 86</page><page sequence="72">770544 - 770548 show the necessity of introducing the contaminant variable in order to properly assess the relative wear- preventive characteristics of different fluids. Correlation with results obtained from actual service conditions is also established. 1977 SA E Transactions 770544. Interactive Analysis of Planar Mechanisms on a Small Computer. Paul D. Sandberg, John Deere Dubuque Works. A new, simple approach to general planar mechanism analysis has been developed which is intended for use with interactive graphic display terminals. This approach can be applied to 80 percent of the mechanisms used in earthmoving equipment. It allows even complex mech- anisms with multiple external loadings to be analyzed quickly, in small amounts of core. This paper describes the method for modeling a mechanism and the procedure for finding its new positions. Velocity, acceleration, and static force analysis techniques are presented and illustrated by example mechanisms. Not only are these procedures basic and logical, they are also repetitive from pin to pin on the linkage, which makes them easy to program. 1977 SA E Transactions 770545. Finite Element Analysis of Prying Action in Bolted Joints. M. Wayne Simon and James B. Hengehold, Structural Dynamics Research Corp. Structural connections involving a T-stub arrangement often result in fasteners loaded in tension. The working load developed in the fastener is dependent upon the stiffness and deformation of the T-stub itself. Tests have shown that this "prying action" phenomenon can influ- ence fastener performance. A number of analytical and experimental models has been developed to predict the relationship between applied forces and subsequent bolt forces. It is felt that the detailed analysis provided by finite element theory could add additional insight into this phenomenon by more rigorously defining the load distribution between connected members. Finite element analyses could then be utilized to efficiently evaluate the effects of alternative support and fastener stiffnesses and variations in fastener pre-load. 1977 SA E Transactions 770546. Frozen Soil Cutting Using Vibratory Blades. R. T. Burton and P. R. Ukrainetz, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., University of Saskatchewan (Canada). In many parts of the world, the working season of certain operations is severely limited due to winter freeze-up. This is essentially true in such areas as earth moving and trenching. These limitations are due, in part, to the large drawbar forces which act on the cutting machine as it is drawn through the frozen soil. If this drawbar force could be reduced economically, then the working season of these types of operations could conceivably be extended, resulting in increased productivity and profits per year. One method of reducing this force is to oscillate the cutting tool as it passes through the soil. Indeed, recent studies have shown that drawbar force reductions of up to 80% can be realized using just this technique. Un- fortunately, it has also been shown that the overall power requirements also increase, a negative factor when economical matters are being considered. As a result, it is of utmost importance (for practical applications) to determine the conditions under which the power re- quirements can be minimized. This report considers one such condition, that is, the condition of the soil itself. Since frozen soils represent a situation under which drawbar forces are the largest, this study examined the power requirements of an oscillating blade as it passes through both frozen and unfrozen soils (latter case for comparative purposes). The power requirements and force reduction were measured experimentally and data pre- sented graphically for discussion. It is concluded that an increase in power efficiency, for the same force reduction, occurs as the soil becomes frozen (or hard packed). This result is of special importance in earth moving, trenching, etc. applications. 1977 SA E Transactions 770547. Testing and Evaluation of Large, Off-Highway Haulage Truck Brake Systems. R. M. Ritcey and W. Taciuk, Underwood McLellan &amp; Associates LTD. (Canada). Performance requirements of service brakes for large off-highway haulage trucks have recently been questioned, particularly for downgrade hauls as experienced in many Western mining operations. Underwood McLellan &amp; Associates Limited, Consulting Engineers, has been engaged in a program of testing and evaluating the performance of several types and sizes of brakes which are commercially available to the industry. Unique procedures were developed to acquire per- formance data at high levels of energy input to the brakes of trucks having GVW's in the order of 350,000 to 550,000 pounds. This paper describes the background and devel- opment of the test program and procedures, the testing details, the method of data evaluation, and a summary of performance characteristics as deduced from the test data analysis. 770548. Design Considerations for the Goodbary Bottom Dump Haulage Trucks. E. R. Goodbary, Good- bary Equipment Co. "Design Considerations For The Goodbary Bottom Dump Haulage Truck" accepts the conclusions of pre- vious investigations indicating strong inherent advantages of the two-axle, bottom-dump rear-axle powered unit, utilizing two wheel motors, and presents a summary of a comparative study between a single tire application and a dual tire application, further concluding that single tire mounting is the only functionally sound and economically 87</page><page sequence="73">770549 - 770558 feasible choice. In the process of reaching this conclusion, included are a number of related design and operational considerations of off-road haulage equipment which will provide the greatest return for the end user. 770549. Dart's 1000 hp Mechanical Drive Off-Highway Trucks. Darrell B. Carr, Dart Truck Co. Dart's innovation to a tried and proven 1,000 H.P. mechanical drive is incorporated into one basic chassis that is utilized as a two axle end dump at 100 ton and a three axle tractor-trailer at 150 ton. A straight-forward approach and a simplified design vehicle was engineered and tested under controlled laboratory conditions and also customer conditions. The vehicle axles and chassis will also accomodate the newer tire options that are being offered in this basic size truck. Dart's purpose with these trucks is to offer the mining industry a low cost per ton mile vehicle. 770550. The Winch-Dozer - A Tool for Area Mine Spoil Leveling. John W. Colburn, Jr. and Ronald J. Mathis, Southwest Research Institute; and Ronald R. Backer, Spokane Mining Research Center, Bureau of Mines, U.S. Department of the Interior. A new approach to reclaiming the spoil areas produced by area-type mining operations has been developed. This system uses a machine known as a winch-dozer, consisting of a pair of large back-to-back buckets which are drawn by cable across spoil piles, moving back and forth between a "tailblock" anchor and a "drawworks" winch unit developed as an attachment to a large crawler tractor. The system is expected to reduce the cost of reclamation leveling by 40-50%. The system permits more effective power utilization due to the blade system's light weight, induces caving of spoil banks, and permits moving spoil in both directions of blade travel. 770551. Field Trials of Laser Surveying and of Exper- imental Earthmover Blade Control Kit. Carter J. Ward and Preston S. Springston, Civil Engi- neering Laboratory, Naval Construction Bat- talion Center. CEL has for several years been experimenting with automatic surveying and with retrofit automatic blade control kits for construction equipment. Earlier progress on these kits was presented in SAE Paper 750765. Included in this work is an experimental automatic blade control kit developed for a tractor with power-tilt blade. This paper describes results of recent field trials of the tractor kit conducted to compare and record the efficiency of completing a typical earthwork project utilizing present conventional Naval Construction Force surveying and earthmoving equipment versus the effi- ciency of completing the same project utilizing the automatic controls kit installed on a dozer and laser surveying equipment. The test project was considered representative of earthwork typically encountered in permanent construction. Use of the laser surveying equipment and the auto- matic control kit for blade elevation and tilt reduced job time by 40 percent and job labor by 50 percent for the project executed during the trials, without loss of finished surface quality. 770552. The Use of Hydraulic Excavators in Logging Road Construction. Ronald D. Clark, Caterpillar Americas Co. The hydraulic excavator is now being used in Western Canada for construction of some logging roads in place of more traditional road-building machines. The flexibility and versatility of the excavator in this application has provided logging companies substantial construction cost savings, while meeting new governmental and environ- mental road building standards. 770553. RH 75 - A 10/13 yd3 Hydraulic Shovel Devel- opment and Application. Helmut Heusler and Udo Reinecke, O&amp;K Orenstein &amp; Koppel AG (Germany). O&amp;K have several years of job site experience with hydraulic excavators of the 110- ton performance class which was utilized to develop and optimize these ma- chines. Some crucial points of the development are described, having special regard to the relation between shovel size and dump truck size. 770557. Hydrodynamic Transmissions Parameters Opti- mization. Gian Luca Zarotti and Nicola Ner- vegna, Earthmoving Machine Research Ctr., National Council of Researches (Italy). The hydrodynamic transmissions found in much of today's earthmoving machinery provide distinct advan- tages in overall functional facilities, but there is a great need for improvement in their converter efficiencies. This paper explains a new method, based on optimization techniques and utilizing computer analysis, which has been developed to help solve this problem. Computational case studies are described to illustrate its use in selecting and identifying optimal values for basic transmission parameters. The immediate and potential applications of this approach are also discussed. 770558. New Pressure-Compensated Proportional Hy- draulic Valves with Six Optional Remote Con- trols. Azam S. Qureshi, TOMCO, Inc. Mobile equipment manufacturers continue to be faced today with the ever pressing demand for increased productivity from their hydraulic machines. The on-off type of hydraulic control valves are not accurate enough and do not have the controllability required for increased production rates. The requirement is for valves that smoothly meter flow as well as control direction, without excessive power losses. Further, because of the continued emphasis on operating ease and flexibility of hydraulic 88</page><page sequence="74">770559-770577 system installation, there is need for simple and reliable remote controls that are compatible with existing hard- ware. This paper presents the performance requirements for remotely controlled mobile hydraulic valves, and de- scribes how they are met by a new family of pressure- compensated proportional valves with six remote control options: mechanical (push-pull cable), hydraulic, pneu- matic, electrical, fiber-optic, and radio. 770559. Use of Hollow Rods in Hydraulic Cylinders. K. L. Seshasai and S. K. R. Iyengar, Fluid Power Research Ctr., Oklahoma State Univ. Hydraulic cylinders on mobile equipment have used, for the most part, solid rods. It is well known, however, that a circular cross-section does not result in optimal utilization of the material from a flexural rigidity standpoint, and long cylinders (e.g., on hydraulic cranes) have been designed by utilizing hollow rods. In some designs, these rods are subjected internally to the same pressure as the cylinder (W rods), while in other designs they are non-pressurized {'dry9 rods). The question naturally arises as to the superiority of one design over the other. This paper presents comparative data on pressurized and non-pressurized hollow rod cylinders and solid rod cylinders, based on the analysis of the cylinder-rod combination as a stepped beam-column structural mem- ber having a non-linear rotational joint at the cylinder rod interface. It is concluded that, generally speaking, hollow rod construction results in better utilization of materials than solid rods, but pressurization does not result in any significant increase in structural capability. 1977 SAE Transactions 770560. Hydrostatic Transmission Noise Abatement. G. E. Maroney and D. L. O'Neal, Fluid Power Research Center, Oklahoma State University. This paper discusses the control of the three types of noise associated with hydrostatic transmissions - airborne, structureborne, and fluidborne. Basic control techniques for all three sources of noise are discussed. Specific guidance for controlling fluidborne noise is provided by discussing the selection of pumps and motors based on flow ripple and impedance, the selection of operational parameters, and the use of fluidborne noise attenuators. 1977 SA E Transactions 770561. Noise Control In Planetary Transmissions. W. E. Palmer and R. R. Fuehrer, Detroit Diesel Allison, Division of General Motors Corpora- tion. Noise generated by vehicles has become of increasing concern, in recent years, in its effect both inside and outside the vehicle. Although the noise contributed by heavy-duty automatic transmissions in on- and off- highway vehicles is insignificant in relation to that generated by other vehicle components, a program was initiated to investigate sources and causes of transmission noise and to develop methods of reducing or eliminating that noise. In power transmission, the most common source of noise is vibration of individual gears in mesh. Two methods of decreasing gear mesh vibration have been found successful: improving gear tooth profile and counterphasing planetary gearing. 1977 SA E Transactions 770562. Eliminating an Annoying Whistle From a Spur Gear Power Train. Richard F. Holton, PAY Line Div., International Harvester Co. This paper discusses a methodology and associated logic which can be used to analyze a spur gear power train for sound reduction at the source of generation. The specific example discussed here involves the successful elimination of an intolerable whistle produced by the spur gear transmission of a large crawler tractor. 770563. Noise Control in Bevel Gears. Donald R. Carlson and Kenneth W. Evans, Gleason Works. Vibrations created by the meshing action of bevel gears operating in a drive system often result in gear noise. Although this noise is a system problem, it can be reduced at the source by careful design and manufacturing techniques. This paper discusses key factors in these areas. 770564. Personality and Humor in Technical Writing. W. Earl Britton, University of Michigan. Scientific writing is necessarily precise and objective, but like any other type of writing, it is directed toward an audience and must appeal to that audience in order to be fully effective. This paper explores the role of humor and personality in scientific writing and also discusses basic writing principles that should be followed. 770565. Exane - Flame Retardant Wire and Cable Insu- lation for Off-Highway Vehicles. Richard A. A. Hall, ITT Surprenant Div. Hydraulic and mechanical sources can no longer effi- ciently supply total power for the new highly sophisticated construction and mining equipment because payloads have increased so greatly. Electric drive vehicles provide a solution, but necessitate development of advanced wire and cable systems designed to satisfy more rigorous requirements than standards such as SAE J558a and SAE J878a currently mandate. EXANE, a flame retardant, irradiated, cross-linked polyolefin insulation, is one such system, which has been subjected to extensive testing to prove its effectiveness. These tests and their results are detailed and EXANE's performance is compared to that of other popular insulation systems. 770577. Partnership for a Future-Airline View. Paul M. Johnstone, Eastern Airlines. This paper discusses the rising costs confronting the airline industry and how they can be controlled through conservation of labor, materials, and capital. Ways in 89</page><page sequence="75">770580 - 770592 which lawyers, financiers, and regulators can cooperate to improve the airlines in the future are explored. Current research is evaluated in terms of its necessity and terms of whether the problems being investigated have been sufficiently well defined to make it productive. 770580. Airport Aircraft Economic Interface. J. D. Smith, United Airlines. Aircraft operators experience excessive operating costs and fuel consumption when moving airplanes from ramp of departure to ramp of arrival. Approximately 85-90% of such off-to-on delays are attributable to congestion in the terminal airspace/airport at the destination. Economic penalties and causal factors are described. Increased airport productivity is essential and recommendations for improving airport utilization are provided. 770581. Airport Planning and Economics: Some Changing Perspectives. John R. Goodwin, Federal Avia- tion Administration. The airport planning business has undergone a substantial perspective evolution in the past ten years. A basic economic need for high-speed, long-haul transportation resulted in the introduction of commercial turbojet aircraft in the late fifties. A nation-wide airport capacity crisis seemed imminent as forecasts in the mid to late sixties projected strong growth rates. Many airport planners felt that the inability to meet the need for airport capacity would be disastrous. This anticipated crisis, however, never fully materialized. Factors, mostly eco- nomic, have permitted the imposition of limited non- construction alternatives such as quotas to alleviate the congestion problem. In addition other economic and technical matters such as the application of demand forecasts and the assessment of capacity, reliance on potential technology and automation, and the selection of airport concepts have significantly altered the planning process. 770583. Wake Turbulence Detection and Economic Im- pact of Proposed Improvements. William D. Wood and Ian G. McWilliams, Dept. of Trans- portation, Transportation Systems Center. Increased separations of aircraft following heavy jets, which have been mandated because of the threat posed by aircraft trailing wake vortices, have aggravated the problem of air traffic delays at some of the busier airports. An extensive vortex measurement program at three major airports has provided the data base for the design of a Vortex Advisory System which will permit reduction of the vortex imposed separations under certain measurable wind conditions. This system which promises to effect an appreciable reduction in traffic delay is currently under- going testing at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. 770590. (P-71) Elasto-Plastic and Large Deflection Anal- ysis of Thin Shells by the Flow Theory of Plasticity. S. C. Tang, Ford Motor Co. This is a subsequent report on a study of the sheet metal response subjected to impact loads. The mathematical model of thin shells employed in the previous report is used once again to model the sheet metal. Based upon nonlinear shell theory, the flow theory of plasticity, and the finite element technique, the equilibrium conditions in the incremental form at each nodal point are established. Step-by-step numerical integration is applied to solve these equations and an error control procedure is incorporated at every load level. A computer program has been written according to this formulation and devel- opment. It was checked by running two sample problems for which solutions exist in the literature and one problem whose solution was experimentally evaluated from a full size structure. In addition applications relative to finding the dent resistance and oil-canning deformations of sheet metal body components in an automotive structure are discussed. 1977 SA E Transactions 770591. (P-71) Dynamic Validation of a Computer Sim- ulation for Vehicle Crash. I. K. Mclvor and W. J. Anderson, Univ. of Michigan. The present paper describes two crash tests designed to validate a computer simulation developed for predicting the large dynamic plastic response of vehicle structures under crash conditions. The test structures were idealized quarter scale models consisting of frame and rigid body elements. Both direct and oblique pole impacts are reported. Impact speed was 30 MPH. Predicted and experimental results are compared for the crush dis- placements, impact force at the pole barrier, and accel- eration histories at two points on the "passenger com- partment" mass. Good agreement is obtained for the symmetric test. Results for the oblique test are not as uniformly good, but quantitative agreement is still satisfactory. Comparison of dynamic variables are sen- sitive to both the filtering of the raw test data and the numerical integration procedure employed in the simu- lation. It is demonstrated that the use of appropriate error measures to select step size insures the efficient conver- gence to a signal with the frequency content of interest in crashworthiness applications. 1977 SA E Transactions 770592. (P-71) Dynamic Crushing of Strain Rate Sen- sitive Box Columns. Tomaz Wierzbicki, Institute of Fundamental Technological Research (Poland); and Ture AkerstrÃ¶m, AB Volvo. The regular deformation patterns of axially compressed box section beams is analysed. Assuming a simple collapse mechanism, the theory is then extended to cover the influence of strain rate sensitive material. The dynamic strength of a beam-column is signif- icantly higher than the static strength. Correlation of the 90</page><page sequence="76">770593 - 770599 present theoretical results with the available experimental data is discussed. 1977 SA E Transactions 770593. (P-71) A Design-Analysis Method for the Fron- tal-Crush Strength of Body Structures. David C. Chang, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. A simplified design-analysis method is developed for estimating the ultimate load-carrying capacity and the associated coliapse mechanism of a body structure subjected to a frontal crush load. The analysis is based on the principles of limit analysis; the computation scheme consists of repeated stepwise analyses for each incre- mental load, and repeated searching for the collapse mechanism which requires the least load (the collapse load). Very good agreement was obtained between analysis and crush-test results of production body struc- tures. This design analysis method provides a simple and direct means for design engineers to evaluate the effect of design variations on the body crush strength. 1977 SA E Transactions 770594. (P-71) System Modeling Techniques to Improve the Ride and Vibration Isolation Characteristics of Heavy Equipment. Ronald A. Shryock, Joseph W. Klahs and David A. Dieterich, Structural Dynamics Research Corp. Much attention has been devoted to the importance of vehicle dynamics relative to human response ride criteria. The present work extends this effort by providing a practical computerized design approach in which the vehicle designer selects a representative terrain input, either sinusoidal or power spectral density, to excite a vehicle model constructed by the modal Building Block method. To evaluate vehicle ride the resulting system response, accounting for human dynamic characteristics, is compared to accepted ride criteria, such as ISO spectra and absorbed power. An example involving an agricul- tural tractor is presented to illustrate the approach. 770596. (P-71) Novel Developments and Applications of Finite Element Methods at Daimler-Benz. D. Radaj, A. Zimmer and H. Geissler, Daimler- Benz AG (Germany). The objective of the paper is a survey on new finite element (FE) software and application developments at Daimler-Benz since the Detroit Conference 1974 at which the authors gave a similar paper on developments at that timeâ¬ The organizational background in which FE analysis is taking place at Daimler-Benz is given: computation giving support to design and testing, decentralized computation groups, centralized computer hardware and software, FE systems NASTRAN and ESEM/TPS10 at Daimler-Benz, in-house and out-of-house software devel- opment, verification and efficiency tests. New FE software and application developments at Daimler-Benz are surveyed, especially the system GROVER for geometrically non-linear problems (large displacements, small strains), the MSC/NASTRAN superelement capability, the hybrid (modal/direct) fre- quency response analysis of full car simulations and a remarkable mesh and data generator. The application examples cover spring and axle systems under large displacements, the over/understeer characteristics of an off-road truck, the frequency spec- trum of stress amplitudes in a bus resulting from riding and a turbine blade static and dynamic analysis. 770597. (P-71) Design Through Analysis of an Exper- imental Automobile Structure. James A. Augusti tus, Mounir M. Kamal and Larry J. Howell, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. It is evident that the use of impact simulation, static, and dynamic analyses in the pre-prototype phase of the design process can significantly improve the structural efficiency of the automobile. As a result of this design project, the accuracy of the structural modeling and analysis was verified by experimental data obtained from a fabricated test vehicle, and the potential value of design through analysis was demonstrated by a significant reduction in structural weight of the project vehicle. 1977 SA E Transactions 770598. (P-71) A Few Aspects on the Development of Structural Models. Klaus Hieronimus, Adam Opel AG. The finite element method is a useful tool for analyzing vehicle and chassis components even if no large computer or interactive communications are available. This paper shows how, in a relatively short period, we created structural models, did the actual finite element-calcu- lations, and made the final evaluation of the results. The contribution contains a description of the Finite Element System as used by Adam Opel AG, and added to that some worked examples from the bodyshell and chassis field with mention of solved and unsolved problems. 770599. (P-71) Stress and Dynamic Analyses of a Bonded, Non-Linear Viscoelastic Cylindrical Block. Kenneth N. Morman, Jr., Lie K. Djiauw, Paul C. Killgoar and Robert A. Pett, Ford Motor Co. An approximate theoretical treatment is presented for the large deformation of non-linear viscoelastic cylindrical blocks bonded between rigid end-plates. The measured compressive force relaxation of two blocks of different initial radius to height ratios is shown to be in good agreement with the theoretical predictions for a carbon- black filled vulcanÃ­zate. Measurements of dynamic stiff- ness k* ( = k1 -I- jk2) for various compressive pre-loads and a frequency range of .05 to 30 Hz were also conducted. The measured values for the storage stiffness, k, are shown to be in good agreement with the theoretical 91</page><page sequence="77">770600 - 770603 predictions, but poor correlation between experiment and theory is obtained for the loss stiffness, k2. Discrepancies between experimental and analytical results are attributed to the approximations employed to make the analysis mathematics more tractable rather than to the basic theory involved. Such approximations were necessary in lieu of the lack of commercially available finite difference or finite element computer codes for treating the subject problem in a more exact manner. 1977 SA E Transactions 770600. (P-71) User Oriented Mesh Refinements in the Discrete Element Analysis Technique. W. E. Carroll, Florida Technological Univ. Much of the recent work by the author as well as others has focused on the need to consider idealization geometry a variable in the finite element solution procedure. Such solutions, in which grid geometry is included as a solution variable, have become known as optimum grid solutions. To date, considerable emphasis has been placed on establishing criteria for the selection of optimum grid solutions. Criteria have been successfully established for the elastostatic, elastodynamic and the elastic stability problem. Focus is now being directed at exploring the benefits of utilizing optimum grid solutions. Several papers have communicated techniques for determining "near optimum" meshes. The purpose of this paper is to consolidate and present the recent advances made in the area of optimum grid solutions. The author has arranged this talk into three subareas that serve as objectives: (1) To present the user of the finite element method with a basic understanding of the theoretical foundation of the optimum grid solution. The formulation of the elastostatic problem will be reviewed. A method for formulating the elastodynamic and elastic stability prob- lem will be indicated. The physical characteristics indic- ative of the optimum grid solution for the later class of problems will be indicated. (2) To present the user with a compendium of user oriented guidelines that have been presented in the published literature. As mentioned, methods for gener- ating "near optimum" solutions have recently received attention. The purpose of this section will be to perform a comparative evaluation of criteria used to direct mesh refinement. (3) To indicate to the user the benefits and pitfalls (cost) of full grid optimization versus the near optimum solution. Experience the author has had in operating a program capable of either "mode" shall serve as the basis of this section. Throughout this talk simple example problems will be presented that demonstrate the nature of the process being discussed. Guidelines regarding convergence, error analysis, and error detection as they are relevant in the optimum grid context are included. 1977 SA E Transactions 770601. (P-71) Numerical Investigation of Stresses in the Inelastic Range in a Rolling Contact. Subhash C. Anand, Clemson Univ. An automobile component moving in a rolling contact is modeled as a disk rolling on a rigid track. Elastic-plastic finite element method is employed to determine the stresses and strains in the disk near the point of contact as a function of the rolling history. It is shown that unloading due to rotation of the previously yielded elements can be easily handled by the direct stiffness tangent modulus approach. Stresses at shakedown and elastic-plastic steady state are computed. 1977 SA E Transactions 770602. (P-71) A Substructuring Approach to Localized Plasticity Analysis. Richard B. Katnik and Michael F. Kowalski, Chevrolet Engrg. Center; and Kuo-Kuang Chen, General Motors Re- search Labs. In the analysis of automotive structures using finite element models, areas of stress concentration are often uncovered. The calculated linear stress at these locations may exceed the yield strength of the material. In these situations, the analyst is confronted with the choice of making a nonlinear analysis of the structure or using an approximate technique to predict nonlinear strains. The former can be excessively expensive while the latter can lead to results of questionable accuracy. This paper will discuss a technique which substantially reduces the cost of the nonlinear analysis of complex structures with areas of localized plasticity. The basis of the technique is the substructuring of the localized plasticity areas. They are identified and dis- connected from the linear elastic part of the model by boundary points. The elastic degrees of freedom are reduced to boundary freedoms having boundary stiffness matrices which remain constant for each incremental step of a plasticity solution. The displacements for the last incremental step may be used to verify that the linearity of the elastic substructure has not been violated. A brief description of the in-house computer programs are given. The technique, accuracy and savings are compared to a complete nonlinear analysis using two simple structures. Finally, the method is applied to a detailed automotive component. 1977 SA E Transactions 770603. (P-71) Systems Design with Substructures. Cecil R. Rogers, Swanson Analysis Systems, Inc. After a brief discussion of the theoretical basis of substructures for statics and dynamics, the handling techniques are described, including file management, modification utilities, and nested heirarchies. Examples of 92</page><page sequence="78">770604 â¢ 770607 recent applications illustrate the economies that can be achieved by substructuring. Substructures are especially economical in repetitive analyses, such as nonlinear static and dynamic analyses in which major portions of the structure exhibit linear behavior, or in design studies where only a portion of the model is to be modified. Substructuring is not generally economical in single load case static analyses but it may be necessary in some cases of very complicated models, in order to analyze them within available computer resources. Some of the trade- offs and pitfalls are also presented. The principles of substructuring are extended to include transient thermal analyses, which may be coupled to substructured stress analyses. The role of substructures as an intergroup communication tool is outlined. 770604. (P-71) The Use of Inertia Relief to Estimate Impact Loads. Mark F. Nelson and Joseph A. Wolf, Jr., Research Labs., General Motors Corp. The method of inertia relief can provide a very inex- pensive way of calculating dynamic forces in a structure. In order to perform an inertia relief analysis, an analyst must first select single values to represent the force time histories which are applied to the structure. These forces are then applied to a partially or totally unrestrained structure (i.e., free-free), and the resulting rigid body accelerations are calculated. From these accelerations and the mass of the structure, the inertia forces can be calculated at all points in the structure and then applied along with the original forces. Finally, the structure is restrained from rigid body motion, and a conventional static analysis is performed. If the periods of the applied loads are much greater than the periods of those modes that would be excited in the structure, this approximate technique is exact. How- ever, should the periods of the loads be close to those of interest in the structure, then the results are not nearly as good. Several examples are examined to determine the accuracy of the inertia relief method. The dynamic responses of simple series- and parallel-connected spring- mass systems are analyzed and compared with inertia relief calculations. An important conclusion is that for masses connected in series, the error in the inertia relief results increases as one gets farther from the applied load. The final example is a space frame structure composed of welded tubular elements and representing a subcompact vehicle geometry. It is subjected to a load which is similar to that resulting from the 8 km/h (5 mph) bumper impact safety standard. 1977 SA E Transactions 770605. (P-71) Finite Element Method in Stress Analysis Practice. E. Citipitioglu, V. T. Nicolas and S. K. Tolani, Structural Dynamics Research Corp. The purpose of this paper is to put the finite element method into proper perspective by exploring the ap- proximate nature and model dependent character of the method. Modeling strategies and selection of appropriate finite element types are explained and the procedures are illustrated with several examples. Finally, the solution of two practical stress analysis problems are discussed in detail to demonstrate the proper utilization of the finite element method in real world applications. It is concluded that a stress analyst must establish clear objectives of his analysis, have at least an approximate idea of how the structure will behave, and have basic knowledge con- cerning the theoretical basis and properties of various finite element types in order to successfully use the finite element method in a cost effective manner. 770606. (P-71) Application of Isoparametric Finite Ele- ments in Vehicle Structural Mechanics. C. J. Parekh, J. E. Basas and K. S. Kothawala, Engineering Mechanics Research Corp. This paper is concerned with the application of the isoparametric elements in the vehicle structural mechanics fields. The isoparametric elements having additional nodes along their sides have a significant practical advantage in that such sides can be allowed to distort physically to represent the true geometrical configuration of a structure. Also, the accuracy of results and the rate of convergence of solution can be increased even with larger, and consequently fewer, elements. Comparative models using the conventional and isoparametric elements are presented to illustrate their differences. It is shown that with the use of isoparametric elements, the finite element representation of any large complex system is tremen- dously simplified and a very economical solution can be obtained. The basic concepts and the techniques used in developing a family of isoparametric elements having linear and parabolic displacement variations, and a suitable combination of the same, are discussed. The possibility of misuse with unreasonably distorted elements and the method of detecting them are mentioned and appropriate recommendations for avoiding them are given. Finally, the merits of using the isoparametric elements for complex two-dimensional, three-dimensional and general shell structures are illustrated with the actual examples of application to a large variety of vehicle components. 770607. (P-71) Experiences with Minimum Weight De- sign of Structures Using Optimality Criteria Methods. N. S. Khot, V. B. Venkayya and L. Berke, Air Force Flight Dynamics Lab, Wright- Patterson Air Force Base. This paper presents a summary of methods based on optimality criteria to design structures with stress, dis- placement, buckling and dynamic stiffness constraints. The optimality criteria and the necessary recurrence relations are derived for each of these design constraints. The methods based on optimality criterion can be used to design structures with multiple loading conditions and 93</page><page sequence="79">770608-770612 multiple constraints. Illustrative examples are given to show the application of methods to design a minimum weight structure with different types of constraints. 1977 SA E Transactions 770608. (P-71) The Application of Optimization Tech- niques to Problems of Automotive Crashworthi- ness. James A. Bennett, Kuang-Huei Lin and Mark F. Nelson, Research Labs, General Mo- tors Corp. A method for automating the selection of front-end structural stiffnesses for barrier impact standards is presented. Presently the standard analysis tool is the impact simulation method in which static nonlinear force-deformation curves of components are used in a computer integration of the equations of motion. Current design methods involve manually modifying the force- deformation curves to produce an acceptable design. This process may be significantly improved by the use of optimization methods. An improved impact simulation model which calcu- lates the steering column envelopment is introduced. To express the effect of passenger compartment deceleration on potential injury, a vehicle crash severity index is introduced and is shown to be positively correlated with potential injury based on the chest severity index. An optimization technique is used to find a set of design variables which will satisfy constraints placed on the above measures of crash worthiness; namely, the steering column envelopment and the vehicle crash severity index. The shape similarity of force-deformation curves from car to car for a given component suggests the use of a scale factor on the curves as a design variable. 1977 SA E Transactions 770609. (P-71) Truck Ride Improvement Using Analytical and Optimization Methods. J. H. Baum, GMC Truck &amp; Coach Div., General Motors Corp.; J. A. Bennett and T. G. Carne, General Motors Research Labs. A two-tier approach is applied to the analysis of a cab-over-engine tractor. A detailed three-dimensional finite element model was developed and verified with data acquired from road input. In addition, a simpler two- dimensional model was developed and used with an optimization technique to develop alternative designs. The root-mean-square accelerations of the driver in the vertical and fore-aft directions were used as performance measures. The proposed designs were then evaluated using the detailed finite element model, and additional im- provements were suggested. This approach led to a modification of the cab mounting system which resulted in a predicted 44 percent reduction in the fore-aft rms acceleration from an initial design. 1977 SA E Transactions 770610. (P-71) Structural Optimization in Panel Design. David C. Chang and Martin R. Barone, Re- search Labs, General Motors Corp. This study is concerned with the use of structural optimization techniques to achieve minimum weight in panel designs. Major emphasis is placed on design applications and on the development of a practical and efficient lightweight design-search system for vehicle structural panel designs. This allows the system to be formed more effectively in adopting special analysis schemes, design considerations, and optimization algo- rithms to fit the vehicle structural design requirements. The relative merits and disadvantages of computer adaptations of some of the more promising algorithms are also discussed. Solutions to some specific minimum weight example problems pertaining to reinforced automotive panel design are presented. Results are obtained for both homogeneous and bimaterial panel assemblies. Minimum allowable structural performance criteria are enforced through nonlinear constraint equations. Numerical results are obtained using a lightweight design-search system (LDSS) currently under development. 1977 SA E Transactions 770611. (P-71) Effect of Transverse Forces on Shrink-Fit Assemblies. T. V. Seshadri, Fruehauf Corp. The effect of transverse forces (shear and bending moment) on shrink-fit assemblies is studied using iso- parametric solid finite elements. The shrink-fit is simu- lated in the computer by keeping the coefficient of thermal expansion of one of the parts as zero and heating the whole assembly to desired temperature. The transverse forces tend to loosen the joint and if they are sufficiently large, joint effectiveness will be completely lost. Design guidelines are given for a minimum required fit in the presence of transverse forces. The difference between linear and higher order finite elements as far as nodal forces are concerned is also discussed. 770612. (P-71) Impact Vibrations of Rolling Tires. Mar- tin R. Barone, Research Labs, General Motors Corp. This paper is concerned with in-plane (horizontal and vertical) tire vibrations due to "impulsive" input forces which result when tires impact small or cleat-like bumps (e.g., tar strips). Such high frequency vibrations (20-100 Hz) are commonly associated with vehicle harshness. Quantitative information relating output spindle forces to different cleat inputs is obtained from rolling drum experiments on radial tires. An examination of the data reveals a nonlinear behavior not included in conventional tire equations. This phenomenon is dis- cussed in conjunction with recent advances in tire modeling. A physical explanation is offered which attempts to describe and isolate the major source of the nonlineari ty. 1977 SA E Transactions 94</page><page sequence="80">770613 -770622 770613. (P-71) Cast Steering Knuckle Finite Element and Laboratory Strain Analysis. William L. Felske, Central Foundry Div., General Motors Corp. The finite element method, a computerized mathematical approach to structural design analysis, was evaluated. The study was carried out by analyzing a cast steering knuckle using both a finite element strain analysis and laboratory strain analysis. The results, time, and costs for each method are compared. In addition, working skills required for a finite element analysis were established. 770614. (P-71) Elastic-Plastic Finite Element Analysis of Vehicle Structural Components. David S. Fine, Chevrolet Engineering Center. This paper examines how two practical finite elements, a beam element and a triangular plate bending element, can be applied to vehicle design analysis with acceptable accuracy, yet without expensive computer time penalty. These elements have been implemented in a special purpose program for nonlinear stress analysis of auto- motive structural components. The program employs an initial strain approach, a convected coordinate procedure and an incremental technique to monitor both geometric and material nonlinearities. Three example problems are discussed in detail. The agreement of these solutions with experimental results and experience indicate that the program, with proper modification such as substructuring and interactive graphics, could be adopted as a nonlinear analysis program for production usage. 1977 SA E Transactions 770616. Communication: a Way to be Constantly Present. Marvin D. Jensen, University of Northern Iowa. Future shock is experienced by anyone who is not mentally and emotionally present as new ideas evolve. Laymen are more likely than engineers to be shocked by technology that has developed without their notice. But all people are subject to the shock of co-workers, friends, and family who change without our notice. When the changes are finally noted, the result is too often misunderstanding, withdrawal, or hostility. Such "shock" can be tempered by communication. Communication is defined here as the process of being genuinely present with each other through better perception, listening, language, nonverbal communication, and self-disclosure. 770617. Communication: Some Guidelines for Clear Writing. Bernard E. Ritzinger, Deere &amp; Co. Engineers constantly face the professional challenge of communicating clearly, often through the written word. Some may believe that writing clearly is a knack, requiring mainly memorization of and attention to certain fun- damental grammatical rules. While these are important, clear writing requires far more from the human mind. Some of these demands are examined. Some writing tips for the engineer struggling to communicate effectively with a general, non-technical audience also are included. 770618. Designing Mobile Hydraulic Piping Systems for Maintainability. R. Lenich, Caterpillar Tractor Co. Sooner or later the proper operation of the piping in a mobile hydraulic system ceases or performance decreases to an unprofitable level due to failure, depreciation or wear out of piece parts. Design considerations that are conducive to getting a machine back into operation in the minimum of time and with minimum effort after a problem occurs are discussed. Among other items this includes keeping piping part numbers to a minimum for a machine or machine family, best access to least reliable parts, ability to assemble and disassemble with standard hand tools, wrench clearance, fastener tightening torque requirements, and ease of adapting analytical equipment to reduce troubleshooting time. 770619. Product Safety: A Prime Consideration in Ex- panded Design Criteria for Engineering Educa- tion and Practice. Leo C. Peters, Mechanical Engineering Department, Iowa State University. Design procedures and criteria have changed in the current design-legal climate as a result of increased products liability litigation, standards development and governmental regulations. These considerations now have to be included in current engineering design practices and should also be included in the engineering design educational process. 770621. Characteristics of Activated Carbon for Control- ling Gasoline Vapor Emissions - Laboratory Eval- uation. Michael J. Manos and Warren C. Kelly, Scott Environmental Technology, Inc.; and Max Samfield, U.S. Environmental Protection Agen- cy. The application of activated carbon for control of gasoline vapor emissions resulting from service station operations was investigated under laboratory conditions. Cyclic tests were conducted on five activated carbon materials at various combinations of temperature, humidity, fuel volatility and container shape to determine working capacity characteristics. Regeneration of the carbon was effected by air purging and vacuum stripping. Activated carbon presaturated with gasoline vapors was tested for recovery, and a 1,000-cycle test was conducted to investigate longevity and heel composition. Laboratory data were projected to facilitate sizing of activated carbon beds for a typical 50,000-gallon/month service station. 770622. Survey of Service Station Fuel Temperatures. H. E. Harris, API Vapor Emissions Task Force, Exxon Co. Because of a need to better understand the relationship of gasoline temperatures to hydrocarbon vapor growth or shrinkage that occurs during the vehicle fueling operation, the American Petroleum Institute conducted an extensive survey at selected service stations. 95</page><page sequence="81">770623 - 770629 It was determined that temperature conditions favor- ing vapor shrinkage occur more frequently than condi- tions favoring vapor growth as indicated by the fact that vehicle residual gasoline exceeded dispensed gasoline temperature in 66% of the vehicles fueled. Most vapor growth conditions occurred during a three month fall/ winter period regardless of geographic location. The study identified several factors other than ambient temperature that influenced shrinkage/growth conditions. 1977 SAE Transactions 770623. A Study of Visible Smoke Reduction from a Small Two-Stroke Engine Using Various Engine Lubricants. Kensuke Sugiura and Mineo Ka- gaya, Nippon Oil Co., Ltd. (Japan). This paper relates the smoke reducing characteristics of two-cycle engine lubricants containing polybutene. Mak- ing use of these oils instead of conventional ones, not only smoke but also particulate emissions were reduced, while hydrocarbon concentrations were not affected at all. More than ninety percent of the particulates were unburned lubricant, which account for visible smoke. Diluents such as kerosene and leaner fuel/oil ratios also contributed to the reduction of both smoke and particulates. 770624. Development of Wire-Explosion-Spray Coated Cylinders for Motorcycle Engines. Hideaki Kuse and Makoto Ohtsu, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. (Japan); Hiroshi Ito and Shusuke Takezaki, Nippon Tungsten Co. (Japan). A conventional cast iron cylinder with sleeve or even a porous chrome plated aluminum alloy cylinder is most likely not durable when used on a low pollutant motor- cycle engine which is frequently operated with a lean air/fuel mixture. In order to solve this problem, we have developed a new version of aluminum alloy cylinder that has, on its bore, a hard, porous layer of metallic particles which is formed by the explosion of a metal wire in the bore. This new cylinder has a high resistance to seizure and abrasion as well as good productivity when compared to conventional cylinders. 770625. Automated Acquisition and Reduction of Engine Lubricant Test Data. J. A. Vitkovits, T. R. Jackson, J. R. Siefert and P. R. Lepisto, South- west Research Institute. An automated data handling system to assist in the operation of a diesel engine lubricant test laboratory, involving two mini-computers, is described in terms of why it was needed, the design goals sought, and the operating experience which resulted from its use. The concept of two digital systems, one for on-line data logging and another as a ready back-up, as well as a data processor, is discussed. Direct and peripheral benefits which have resulted from the application of the system, such as semi-automated report processing, operational aids, and various engineering applications, are reported. 770626. Ail-Weather Chassis Dynamometer Facility. B. D. Keller and J. H. Steury, Research and Development Dept., Amoco Oil Co., M. R. Betry, Research DeptÄ£, Standard Oil Co.; and P. J. Clark, Dilworth, Secord, Meagher, and As- sociates Ltd. The Amoco "all-weather" chassis dynamometer is a closed-circuit, single-return, semi-open jet wind tunnel used primarily for automotive fuel and lubricant studies. Underhood temperature and loading conditions of cars operated on the road are accurately duplicated in the tunnel. Maximum vehicle and air speed is 145 kph (90 mph); maximum loading is 235 kW (315 hp). Two soak rooms adjacent to the tunnel are used to temperature condition cars for testing in the tunnel, for static car tests, or for engine-dynamometer studies. Temperature and humidity in the tunnel and soak rooms are controlled independently from -40C to 49C (-40F to 120F) and from essentially dry to essentially saturated air. 1977 SA E Transactions 770627. (SP-419) The Relationship of Journal Bearing Wear to Multigrade Engine Oil Viscometric Properties. R. L. Stambaugh and R. J. Kopko, Rohm and Haas Co.; and P. A. Bennett, ASTM Engine Test Monitoring Center. A high speed road test procedure was developed to demonstrate performance of multigrade engine oils in journal bearing wear protection. High shear viscosities of test oils were approximated through use of a pump loop. A reasonable first approximation of critical viscosity for bearing failure is estimated by measurements at 149Â°C and about 5 X 105 sec-1 with the pass/fail limit being about 3.5 cSt. Discussion: R.

Discussions and Author Closures on The Rela- tionship between Engine Oil Viscosity and Engine Performance (SP-416). Ross M. Stewart, Gulf Science and Technology Co.; and Ted W. Selby, Savant, Inc. Discussions and author closures on "The Relationship Between Oil Viscosity and Engine Performance" provides a supplement to SAE SP 416 - ASTM STP 621 which included all of the papers presented at the SAE-ASTM Symposium held during the 1977 SAE International Automotive Engineering Congress &amp; Exposition Meeting held in Detroit, Michigan, February 28-March 4, 1977. 770629. (SP-419) Startability Benefits of Multigrade Diesel Oils. A. R. Nolf, Oakville Res. Centre, Shell Canada Ltd. The cranking and starting characteristics of four multi- grade and two single grade crankcase oils have been evaluated in three popular makes of diesel truck engines. Test results show average startability benefits of 13-1 5Â°F 96</page><page sequence="82">770630 - 770635 (7-8Â°C) when using a 15W40 multigrade relative to the 30 grade. These benefits increase to 18-20Â°F (10-1 1Â°C) for the 10W30 grade. Additional startability benefits are realized for the 5W20 "Arctic" type lubricants. Minimum starting temperatures for each unit differ, yet startability benefits are similar when comparing the same oils. 770630. (SP-419) Determination of the Cold Flow Be- haviour of Multigrade Engine Oils. Wilfried J. Bartz, Technische Akademie Esslingen; and Wolfgang Wiemann, Institut fÃ¼r ErdÃ¶lforschung (Hannover). The relationship between the cold starting and cold pumpability properties of multigrade engine oils is examined. The reasons why the high shear rate viscosities obtained with the CCS viscometer predicts an oil's startability characteristics but not its pumpability prop- erties are discussed. The concept of viscosity versus shear rate curves at various temperatures are used to compare engine oils formulated with different VI improvers. Viscosity versus shear rate curves obtained with a pressurized capillary viscometer are compared to those obtained with a rotary viscometer. Finally, actual oil flow data obtained with a simulated engine gallery was shown to correlate with viscosity data obtained at a selected shear rate. 770631. (SP-419) Low Temperature Viscosity Require- ments for Engine Oils in Temperate and Tropical Climates. P. R. King, Chairman of the Petro- leum/Automotive Ad-Hoc Committee (under the auspices of The SAE Australasia). Some 30% of the world's car population spread over a large proportion of the world's land mass rarely expe- riences starting temperatures lower than 0Â°C (32 Â°F), but frequently encounters high temperatures in the order of 40-50Â°C (approx. 100-120Â°F). The present SAE 'W' classification, as applied to multi-grade oils, more than satisfies starting requirements in these climates but imposes unnecessary expense and limitations on the nations concerned. A proposal is made to extend the existing SAE classification by defining an SAE 30W number for use in temperate and tropical climates. Data generated from testing of representative oils in glassware and commerciar engines are presented. 770632.Â» (SP-419) Viscometer for Predicting Low-Tem- perature Pumpability of Engine Oils. D. L. Alexander and S. W. Rein, Research and Technical Dept., Texaco Inc. Most engine oils do not have pumpability problems unless used below the engine manufacturers' recommended operating temperatures. An orifice viscometer has been developed which shows promise of identifying the excep- tions, those few oils which could have pumpability problems at temperatures above the recommended tem- peratures. If more extensive testing confirms the initial promise of this rtiethod, inclusion of orifice viscometer limits in engine oil specifications would provide consumer protection. The orifice viscometer shows that some oils can be more fluid at a low temperature than at a higher temperature. Discussion: Ross M.

Marshall and B. J. Lewis, Research and Tech- nical Dept., Texaco Inc. Viscosity decrease as a function of the duration of mechanical shearing is described by a mathematical model. Applicability of the model to several different types of service is demonstrated. For automobile engine oil service that shows a viscosity decrease initially, followed by a gradual viscosity increase, the model offers a means of separating the viscosity decrease term from the total viscosity change. The model provides a rational method of comparing shearing in bench tests with shearing in service. It also offers a means for detailed comparisons of the shear stability of different lubricants in a given service. 770634. An Update on Synthesized Engine Oil Tech- nology. J. A. C. Krulish, H. V. Lowther and B. J. Miller, Mobil Oil Corp. Utilizing extensive synthesized hydrocarbon fluid (SHF) technology, a superior quality light viscosity automotive engine oil has been developed providing optimized engine performance. This product has been shown to provide significant fuel economy benefits while maintaining excellent performance in the areas of oil economy, engine cleanliness and wear protection. In the past, this level of performance has not been possible using conventionally refined mineral oils. The superior performance of this product is ex- tensively documented in U.S. and European laboratory engine, chassis dynamometer and field tests. Fuel econ- omy benefits are shown for a wide variety of vehicles under a number of test conditions including both chassis dynamometer and over-the-road field testing. Addition- ally, the performance reserve capabilities of this product are demonstrated by the results of extended drain field tests and extended duration API sequence engine tests. Relevant factors are discussed which illustrate con- siderable energy conservation can be obtained through properly formulated synthesized engine oils. 770635. Anti-Wear Properties of Engine Oils - Effects of Oil Additives on Valve Train Wear. Kyozo Torii, Hitoshi Chida, Katsuji Otsubo and Yoshihiko Tsusaka, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan). 97</page><page sequence="83">770636 - 770640 Special test methods under low temperature, low speed, and moderate temperature, moderate speed operating conditions were devised to evaluate the anti-wear prop- erties of engine oils upon the engine valve train. Many commercial and some test oils were utilized to determine the factors affecting valve train wear. Test results indicate that the low temperature and low speed test conditions were the more severe for the valve train. No simple correlation was found between the concentration of Zn-DTP and valve train wear, however, the influence of dispersant-detergent additives was found to be significant. The chemistry of such additives showed different tappet scuffing characteristics. 770636. Cam and Follower Performance Prediction of Lubricants in a Test Rig. J. V. D. Wilson and S. F. M. Samy, Edwin Cooper &amp; Co. Ltd., UK. The paper describes methods of using the CEC cam and follower rig to predict lubricant performance in hydraulic lifter, finger follower and bucket follower valve train mechanisms, of differing metallurgies. The background situation to the subject in North America and in Europe is referred to, and the authors briefly discuss the relative merits of engine and rig testing of lubricants with regard to this performance aspect. The test rig is briefly described and appropriate literature references are made for greater detail. Steady condition step load testing has been the essence of 20 hour tests to predict anti-wear performance of lubricants on the basis of highest non-fail loads, and this has been applied to hydraulic lifters and to finger followers. Pitting performance has been evaluated in a different metallurgy using a 50 hour test at a single set of overload conditions. Results indicate an ability to discriminate between reference oils of known anti-wear performance in field testing. A conventional alkyl zinc dithiophosphate (zdp) SE type blend and low phosphorus SE level experimental blends both favourably compare with the reference oils. Adequate to good performances in pitting tests with the two types of blend are also encouraging. 770637. Engine Oil Phosphorus Effects on Catalytic Converter Performance in Federal Durability and High-Speed Vehicle Tests. J. A. Spearot and F. Caracciolo, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. Phosphorus derived from engine oil adversely affected catalyst performance monitored in two separate vehicle tests. In the first test, conducted using six matched vehicles operated at high-speed conditions with three different commercial engine oils, catalyst hydrocarbon conversion efficiency decreased linearly with both the amount of phosphorus added to the engine, and that found on the catalyst. In the second test, conducted using four matched vehicles operated on two different com- mercial engine oils using the Federal Durability Driving Cycle, hydrocarbon conversion efficiency also decreased linearly with the same phosphorus parameters. In this latter test, for nominal oil economies (3 400 km//) and phosphorus concentrations found in current oils (0.17 weight percent), catalyst deterioration due to phosphorus poisoning was greater than that due to thermal degra- dation and could adversely affect a vehicle's ability to pass current (1977) and future emission standards. 1977 SA E Transactions 770638. The Use of Isothermal Plug Flow Reactors for Exhaust Hydrocarbon Reaction Studies. R. W. Deller, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Univ. of Texas at Austin; and S. C. Sorenson, Dept. of Mechanical and Industrial Engrg., Univ. of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign. Methods used for the study of the kinetics of exhaust hydrocarbon reactions are reviewed, compared and contrasted. The isothermal plug flow reactor which allows the determination of time resolved concentration histories of reactants, intermediate products, and final products is suggested as, perhaps, the most desirable and versatile system for the study of moderate temperature hydro- carbon oxidation reactions. The isothermal plug flow reactor allows the gas phase reactions to be studied with kinetically well-defined, repeatable, homogeneous reac- tion conditions that are essentially free of heterogeneous interference. Due to the detailed data obtainable and the controlled reaction conditions, kinetic mechanisms can be studied and evaluated. Investigations that used this technique are reviewed and examples cited to demonstrate the unique capabilities of the plug flow reactor. 1977 SA E Transactions 770639. Rates of Exhaust Gas-Air Reactions. J. L. Bascunana, J. SkibiÅski and E. E. Weaver, Product Planning and Research, Ford Motor Co. The reactions between exhaust gas and air have been investigated in a tubular reactor fed with exhaust gas generated by a spark-ignition engine and secondary air. The test conditions were similar to those existing in experimental engine exhaust reactor systems designed to reduce exhaust gas emissions. Rate expressions are given for the overall reactions of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and total hydrocarbons. During the investigation it has been observed that nitric oxide exerts a sensitizing effect on the ignition in the reactor, while some hydrocarbons, specifically isobutane, inhibit the ignition in the reactor. 1977 SA E Transactions 770640. Compression Ratio Effects With Lean Mixtures. F. J. Marsee, R. M. Olree and W. E. Adams, Ethyl Corporation, Research Laboratories, Ferndale, Michigan. To investigate the fuel-economy benefits of increased compression ratio in modern emission-controlled engines, the compression ratios of two car makes were increased 98</page><page sequence="84">770641 -770647 one unit while holding emission levels and performance nearly constant. All cars were modified for lean-burn operation by using the Turbulent Flow Manifold, a carburetor adjusted for lean air-fuel mixtures, and special calibration of ignition timing and exhaust gas recycle rate. Exhaust port liners and a deceleration valve were used to control the tendency for HC emissions to increase at higher compression ratios. In addition, thermal reactors were installed on one high-compression car. The increased efficiency of this aftertreatment device allowed a simultaneous improve- ment in fuel economy and decrease in hydrocarbon emissions. Based on fuel economy gains and refining savings, this car offers an 8.2% fuel savings over its 1977 certification counterpart. Discussion: Edward N. Cantwell, Jr. and William S. Vilda, E. I.

Used Engine Oil Analyses - Review. P. A. Asseff, The Lubrizol Corporation. This paper is a review of tests employed in the evaluation of used engine lubricants together with comments on the potential significance of the various determinations. Also included is a description of a method for the determi- nation of pentane and benzene insolubles in highly dispersant lubricants which shows promise for a more complete recovery of these contaminants from such systems. 770643. More Information on Oil and Engine from Sludge Analysis. A. P. Zeelenberg and J. M. Wortel, Koninklijke/Shell-Laboratorium, Amsterdam, Shell Research B.V. (The Netherlands). The deposition of sludge formed in engines can be prevented quite effectively by dispersants. However, these are incorporated into the sludge at higher levels than necessary for the dispersant action. A better knowledge of the creation and nature of the sludge could help in devising ways to prevent the formation or deposition more efficiently. Chemical and physical methods have been used to characterize the sludge and its growth. The chemical method involves a slow thermal degradation and the determination of the nature and the rate of evolution of degradation products. These can provide information on oil, fuel, additive or engine conditions. We could also optimize a laboratory method for synthesizing an artificial sludge resembling the engine material more closely than possible hitherto. The physical state of the sludge, i.e. the growth in size and number of the particles, has been investigated by a special centrifugation technique. Single drops of oil suffice to reveal the sludge situation during engine tests. The effects of ashless dispersants e.g. on particle size are better defined. 770644. Field Evaluation of Oil Analysis as a Mainte- nance Tool. C. E. French and D. E. Wulfhorst, Cummins Engine Co., Inc. The effectiveness of using oil analysis as a routine maintenance tool in a field service environment was investigated. A line-haul, inter-city and two mining fleets were studied. The fleets were split into sample and control groups to obtain a standard of comparison. Oil analysis was found to be most effective for detecting leaks in the air intake system and coolant and fuel in the oil. Implementation problems such as irregular sampling, sample contamination, and lack of follow-up hindered its effectiveness in some of the fleets studied. A comparison of the maintenance costs of the sample and control groups in all the fleets studied showed oil analysis was not effective in significantly lowering maintenance costs. 770645. Parametric Study of Fuel-Droplet Flow in an Idealized Automotive Engine Induction System. Robert S. Lo, Ford Motor Company; and Demitrius P. Lalas, Wayne State University. The air, fuel vapor and droplets flow through an engine induction system is studied by a one-dimensional two- phase steady flow model that includes evaporation and heat transfer through the manifold wall. The conservation equations and pertinent constitutive relations are solved numerically by the Bulirsch-Stoer integration scheme. A parametric study of exhaust gas recirculation, fuel type and initial droplet size on evaporation is carried out. Heating of the manifold walls is found to be the most effective way to reduce droplet size and to improve evaporation. 1977 SA E Transactions 770647. A Turbulent Entrainment Model for Spark- Ignition Engine Combustion. Rodney J. Taba- czynski, Reciprocating Engines Research De- partment, Engineering and Research Staff, Ford Motor Company; Colin R. Ferguson and Krisna Radhakrishnan, Sloan Automotive Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A turbulent entrainment model for the turbulent com- bustion process in spark-ignition engines is described. The model uses the basic quantities of turbulent flow; i.e. the integral length scale, micro length scale, and turbulent intensity. The characteristic reaction time for a large eddy ? T is calculated using the characteristic reaction time 7rc for the microscale, A/S,, where S, is the laminar flame speed and propagation of ignition sites within a coherent turbulent structure, n t is related to the flame kernel development time and shows similar trends to the ignition 99</page><page sequence="85">770648 - 770662 delay time. The combustion model is demonstrated by calculations showing the typical trend behavior of com- bustion duration with equivalence ratio, exhaust gas recirculation, spark timing and engine speed.

Nobuhiko Ishikawa, Dept. of Me- chanical Engrg., University of California; and Melvyn C. Branch, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., University of Colorado. A simple analysis of transient thermal flame quenching at a cold wall is presented. A quenching Peclet number is derived and has the form of a sum of a constant and a simple function of adiabatic flame temperature, actual flame temperature, and wall temperature. Typical values of the quenching Peclet number are slightly less than the Peclet number corresponding to the preheating zone thickness. This implies that the values of the quenching Peclet number that have been proposed by other inves- tigators, i.e., 30 to 60, are too high. A comparison of calculated and experimental values for quenching distance was made for a number of fuels. Calculated one wall quenching distances are smaller than experimentally obtained two wall quenching distances by a factor of 0.4 ~ 0.5. The effect of wall material on flame quenching was examined and found to be of minor importance. The wall temperature does not increase appreciably during the quenching process and may be treated as constant. Discussion: Colin R.

Benson, Fuels and Lubricants Dept., General Motors Research Laboratories. A manganese fuel additive, MMT, is now being used in many unleaded gasolines to improve their octane quality. Use of MMT at concentrations up to 0.033 g Mn// (0.125 g Mn/gal) is expected to increase. To determine the effect of MMT on exhaust emission control systems, five cars were tested for 80 000 km (50,000 miles) using a driving schedule which included 1 13 km/h (70 mph) steady speed driving. In this type of operation, use of MMT caused: plugging of monolithic converters located close to the exhaust manifold; partial plugging of an underfloor bead converter; an increase of hydrocarbon emissions from the engines; and excessive spark plug deposits. However, use of MMT apparently enhanced catalytic converter oxi- dizing activity and did not substantially affect octane requirement increase. These preliminary data suggest that use of MMT in commercial gasolines may cause problems with exhaust emission control systems now in use. 1977 SA E Transactions 770656. MMT - A Further Evaluation. D. L. Lenane, Ethyl Corporation, Research Laboratories, Ferndale, Michigan. MMT (methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl) is an antiknock additive for the unleaded gasoline that is now required for cars equipped with catalytic converters. Because of its effectiveness, MMT is economically attractive compared with achieving antiknock quality by refinery processing. This paper updates an earlier SAE paper. Whereas the earlier paper evaluated all aspects of MMT use as an antiknock, this paper is primarily limited to analysis of the possible effects of MMT on exhaust emissions, cataylst plugging, and spark plug life. The results of recent tests and a report on a fleet test currently in progress are included. 770658. Catalyst Plugging in Thruway Police Vehicles. G. Wotzak, N. Kolak and R. Gibbs, New York State, Department of Environmental Conser- vation, Division of Air Resources; and R. Cheng, State University of New York, Albany, New York. As a response to experiences of in-service plugging of police vehicles, the Automotive Emissions Laboratory has examined 20 high-mileage cars from the New York State Thruway Authority, whose total fleet numbers approx- imately 100 vehicles. Fourteen catalysts from twelve vehicles were found to be at least 25 percent physically plugged with thin deposits distributed on the front surface of the forward monolith. Analysis of these catalyst deposits by X-Ray Fluorescence indicated that the plugging material was composed mainly of oil additive components (zinc, calcium, barium, phosphorous) as well as iron and lead. Except for one converter with a deposit assay of 25 weight percent manganese, these deposits were in the range of 0.2 to 9.2 weight percent manganese. Our results indicate that monolith catalysts can plug in the absence of significant levels of manganese. However, increased manganese levels in gasoline result in higher levels of manganese aerosols in exhaust streams which may combine with oil additive components to accelerate the plugging process. 770661. Evolution of the Trailer Air Brake System Under the Effect of FMVSS 121. Robert Crail and Ben Klimek, Berg Manufacturing Co. The air brake system on trailers has undergone many changes since 1974. Changes are not over as market pressure has kept manufacturers of both systems and vehicles searching for more cost effective means. Changes after 1977 will be at a considerably slower pace than those that have occurred since 1975. 770662. Tandem Anti-Lock Systems for Air Braked Vehicles. P. J. O'Keefe and M. L. Hutchins, Bendix Heavy Vehicle Systems Group. Tandem anti-lock systems have recently begun to appear on air-braked vehicles. These designs provide a cost 100</page><page sequence="86">770664 -770671 effective system while still meeting the performance requirements of FMVSS-121. However, they cannot be universally applied to all vehicles without reservation. This paper discusses possible tandem anti-lock system configurations and factors influencing their application to different vehicle and suspension types. These discussions will be based on computer suspension model studies and vehicle tests. Tandem anti-lock vehicle test data will be shown along with comparisons to axle by axle anti-lock control performance. 1977 SAE Transactions 770664. Design of a Mobile Small Wood Yarder. Larry L.

Graham Walker, The Univ. of Calgary. A new Code of Practice for the brake performance of off-highway vehicles was established in Alberta in 1976. Vehicles loaded to gross vehicle weight must be capable of stopping with mechanical brakes five times in quick succession on a grade of 10 per cent from a speed of 28 miles per hour. Comparative trials of various brake systems have been carried out and some combinations capable of meeting the Code are identified. Some problem areas in truck braking are reviewed and potential developments indicated. 1977 SAE Transactions n0667. Truck Disc Brakes - Practice Makes Perfect. P. Raves, Kelsey-Hayes Co. A hydraulic front disc brake for heavy trucks was introduced in 1975 to meet federal motor vehicle safety standard 1 21 (FMVSS 1 21). This paper addresses the design parameters utilized in the development of the energy absorbing medium, namely, friction material and rotor surface. Friction material characteristics in terms of temper- ature, speed and pressure sensitivity are studied. Truck geometry is studied along with friction materials to evaluate the combined effects on stopping distances, resulting in a quick reference method for predicting the 60 MPH stopping distance of any straight truck configu- ration. Rotor thermal stress and interface durability char- acteristics are also discussed. 1977 SAE Transactions 770668. The Girling 'Twinstop' Brake. W. R. Newton and M. J. England, Girling Limited. A two-leading shoe air/spring operated wedge brake for heavy commercial vehicles of up to 13 tonnes static axle weight. The dual-wedge design gives a more uniform shoe- to-drum loading pattern than the conventional 'S' cam. An auto adjustment mechanism is incorporated which is fully enclosed and functions on the same proven principle as used in automobile rear disc brakes. Overall brake assembly weight is reduced by the use of direct mounted actuators. The brake has been adopted by major vehicle manufacturers in view of higher permissable axle weights, improved half systems and handbrake requirements in Europe. 1977 SAE Transactions 770669. A Front Wheel Drive 23,000 Pound Axle. J. Stanley L. Thomas, Kelsey-Hayes Co. A combination of features, including disc brakes, make this an axle that meets the Law and the On-Off-Highway Truck requirements. The discussion is concerned with the axle design. Design is much more than a set of complex calcu- lations. This discussion avoids the calculations and concentrates on the why and how that lies behind the particular combination of parts, many of them being standard commercial parts, that make this integrated axle assembly. 770670. Gasoline Supply for the Car Fleet of Tomorrow. R. M. Ormiston and G. G. Pollock, Standard Oil Co. of California. During the next eight years (to 1985). U.S. motor gasoline consumption is expected to increase slightly, level off, and then begin a slow decline. President Carter's proposed National Energy Plan may result in an even faster decline in gasoline sales if it is sanctioned by Congress. Over the same period, the required gasoline pool octane will increase in response to increased unleaded gasoline sales, the EPA's lead phase-down schedule and predicted engine modifications for improved efficiency. This paper reviews the effects of these trends on the refining industry. Gasoline shortages are not foreseen, assuming reasonable regulatory actions by government. 770671.

The potential for electric utility utilization in an environ- mentally acceptable manner of various fossil fuels is discussed. Fuels and fuel processes considered include Alaskan oil with either desulfurization of the fuel, or stack gas treatment of the combustion products, shale oil, and coal and coal derived synthetic fuels. The latter category includes solvent refined coal, low and medium Btu gas, methanol from coal as well as "true" liquid fuel from coal and the direct utilization of coal either with stack gas scrubbing and a conventional boiler, or in a fluidized bed boiler. 770673. The Design Concept of an Integral Power Steer- ing System for Heavy Duty Trucks. K. Oka- moto, A. Aida and I. Chikuma, Steering Gear Div., Nippon Seiko K. K. The trend to change from linkage type power steering to integral type power steering is underway in Japan. An adequate spring constant and valve underlap are neces- sary to obtain good handling features. The effective integral type power steering system described in the paper, for heavy duty trucks, takes into account not only these two points but has a long operating life of parts and units. 770674. A New Combustion System for the Diesel Engine and Its Analysis via High Speed Photography. Takashi Suzuki and Tadakazu Shiozaki, Hino Motors, Ltd. (Japan). Described herein is the tuning of the combustion system of a direct injection type diesel engine to obtain low emission level and better fuel economy. Though the most important method of emission control for a direct injection system is considered to be timing retardation, it brings a higher level of smoke density and fuel con- sumption. In order to remove these faults, the authors developed a new combustion system based on a newly designed intake port which provides a favorable local mixing of fuel droplets and air in the combustion chamber for ignition by means of air turbulence. This new combustion system was analyzed with high speed pho- tographs which were taken from the underside of the piston to enable observing the whole combustion cham- ber. Favorable characteristics of ignition and burning pattern of the new system were recognized by this analysis. Discussion: Donald L. Stephens, Paccar, Inc. 1977 SA E Transactions 770675. Methodology and Results of Durability Tests of a Commercial Vehicle Drive Train. A. Mischke, Daimler-Benz AG, Germany. The methodology of durability tests comprises calcula- tions on the basis of load collectives taken from the test-run and generalized mathematically. By their trans- formation to stress collectives and by durability hypoth- eses these load factors lead to the determination of the expected service life. Similarly the durability to be expected in practical operation can be predicted by means of test-runs, although costs and time-expenditure are considerable. The important feature of durability testing is the high degree with which the total travel distances rely on type of operation and vehicle weight and to a somewhat lesser degree, on gear ratios, engine output and torque. 770676.

Considerations in Building an Arctic Pipeline Welding Shelter. W. Bruce Nodwell, Canadian Foremost Ltd. When a number of large diameter pipelines were planned for construction in the Arctic, it became apparent that a welding shelter system would be needed to maintain a tight work schedule. The Pioneer Weld-Plex, which is the proposed name of the vehicle, would not only be helpful in the extreme coldness and storm conditions of the Arctic, but it would also be useful when work in the dark would be necessary. It could also provide shelter and facilities for six men, and would enable the workers to start their machinery in any type of weather conditions. 770679.

A description of operation is presented for one of the various regenerative systems that is presently being used. A simplified economic analysis is then utilized to identify that the economic advantages of the system are readily achievable by the transit operator. The contribution of the separately excited dc traction motor to this economic gain is identified. 770682. Mass Transit Drive Trains. Anthony Rieli, Rockwell International. With the ever increasing need for more effective mass transit systems, it becomes apparent that the transit industry must abandon its traditional methods of design and seek updated design philosophy which is available from related industries. With this in mind Rockwell is striving to effect a technological transfer of proven design philosophy, which will assist the transit industry in achieving its overall objectives of providing low-cost, more efficient, more reliable transit systems. This paper shows the progression that has transpired in the design of Mass Transit Drive Trains within Rockwell International over the past five years. 770683.

In commercial vehicles, simple and inexpensive leaf springs are being proven dominant. This paper will present the alternative solutions, which are available for special purposes. If compared to conventional versions, these solutions not only excel in regard to special running characteristics, but they also have the advantage of less weight. It may be beneficial to vehicle development if in the future, lighter commercial vehicles contributing to saving energy could become a reality. 770686. Vehicle Design for the Movement of Abnormal Loads. George K. Boulet, Pacific Truck &amp; Trailer Ltd. The transportation of large dimension and heavy loads which cannot be moved by rail has generated a require- ment for acceptable hauling methods and vehicle speci- fications. Regulations affecting weight and load distri- bution have influenced the design of specialized trailers and vehicles for abnormal load hauling. Restriction on the loading of the hauling vehicle's drive axles limits the tractive effort and the ability to move the load, which necessitates the requirement for multiple hauling tractors. Tractor and trailer combinations utilising as many as four hauling vehicles are featured in the requirements for the transportation of up to 400 ton loads. The design of vehicles for the movement of abnormal loads will be confined to the requirements of the South African Railways (S.A.R.) for operation throughout the Provinces of South Africa: Cape Province, Natal, The Orange Free State, Transvaal, and South West Africa. The administration of these provinces, in recognition of the requirements for the transportation of indivisible heavy loads over public highways, has collectively established recommendations for the conveyance of abnormal loads. Equipment such as electrical transformers weighing up to 400 tons and reactors for chemical plants measuring over 6 metres (20 ft.) in diameter and over 50 metres (160 ft.) in length are being contracted for movement to inland installations as the development of these provinces increases. For each load to be transported, separate exemption permits are issued by each province through which the vehicle will proceed. The administration recommends that before any abnormal load vehicle is purchased, imported or constructed, prior permission is to be obtained to ensure that any such abnormal vehicle will be granted authority to operate on public roads. Although the safety of the public along the route and through villages and cities is of great concern, and requires careful policing and planning for travelling when traffic is least 103</page><page sequence="89">770688 - 770706 congested, the text of these regulations for the conveyance of abnormal loads will apply principally to weight and load distribution. 770688. Designing "The University of British Columbia Electric Car" with Foam-Fiberglass Structure and an AC Drive. Dobzosav Rataj ac, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Univ. of British Columbia. A space efficient, four seater, all polyurethane foam- fiberglass, high performance city-highway electric car powered by a microprocessor controlled AC drive via modified automatic transmission has been designed in the University setting for expected higher energy density batteries. It is being tested with the available lead-acid batteries in the meantime. After tests and modifications on this prototype, resulting modified designs are to be proposed according to the scale desired, and materials commercially proposed according to the scale desired, and materials commercially feasible. With the increasing severe fuel shortage, and the development of better batteries, such an electric car seems the most likely successor to its internal combustion engine powered counterpart. 770689. Technical Features of the Viking 4 Research Vehicle. Paul Tiffany, Vehicle Research Inst., Dept. of Technology, Western Washington State College. A research vehicle was designed and constructed at Western Washington State College. This car was designed to achieve excellent economy and performance with rotary engines. Extensive use of aluminum in a mono- coque chassis and non-stressed body allows low weight. Five miles per hour bumpers of elastomeric urethane are fitted and aluminum honeycomb is used as impact absorbing deformable structures. Aerodynamic features utilized in the Viking 2 experimental vehicle were further refined and incorporated in this vehicle. 770690. Operational Road Tests of Truck Aerodynamic Drag Reduction Devices. W. R. Davis, N. D. Eryou and J. C. Patry, Davis, Eryou and Associates Ltd. A study has been carried out to evaluate the fuel economy performance of retrofit aerodynamic drag reduction devices for straight trucks and semi-trailers. Carefully controlled road tests were conducted along with a survey of Canadian fleet experience. Data from the road tests was compared with fuel savings based on scale model drag coefficients measured in a wind tunnel. The results indicate that, although the device per- formance is affected significantly by ambient winds, truckers can expect fuel savings of the order of 1 3/4 gallons/ 100 miles for straight trucks and 1 1/4 gallons (Imperial Gallons) per 100 miles for semi-trailers, at a cruising speed of 55 mph. 770701.

Smith, Deere &amp; Company. An analytical method is described for evaluating the effect of design changes on tractor ride. The method uses a digital computer program implementing a three-dimen- sional nonlinear mathematical model for simulating tractor rigid body vibration resulting from travel over a specified test track. Spectral and modal analyses are used to interpret the simulation results and provide a quali- tative evaluation of the effects on ride of a given design change. 770705. Tractor Ride Comfort Package. James E. Thompson, John Deere Product Engineering Center. The phenomenal sales growth of enclosure equipped two-wheel-drive (2WD) tractors demonstrates that com- fort and convenience are very marketable features. The operator comfort of the enclosure has created an appetite for corresponding ride quality. Although the operator is subjected to acceleration in all three orthogonal directions; traditionally, tractor suspensions have isolated vibration only in the vertical direction. Measurements reveal that isolation of longi- tudinal acceleration provides the best compliment to the vertical suspension on 2WD tractors. John Deere has developed a ride comfort package which provides the first bidirectional suspension offered on a 2WD tractor. 770706. Progress in Crop Harvesting Equipment. Donald A.

This paper reviews these early developments of the inboard- outhoard marine propulsion system, and also describes the modern day development from 1960 to 1978, during which time the horsepower out-put has increased from a maximum of 80 to 240. The design, development, features and performance of the latest generation~THE NEW 1978 OMC STERN DRIVE-are described in detail. 770715. The Volvo Penta Aquamatic 280 Stern Drive. Lennart Brandt, Volvo Penta of America. The stern drive is a well known propulsion unit which has been successful due to its high performance and com- bination" of features. The drive unit contains channels for exhaust and cooling water, it must support the propeller and associated gears, bearings etc and at the same time have low underwater drag. Furthermore, the boat is manoeuvered by components of housing hydrodynamic lift and pro- peller thrust. The various demands, sometimes in conflict with each other, make the design of a stem drive an "optimum compromise". 770716. Removal of Exhaust Particulate from a Mercedes 300D Diesel Car. Karl J. Springer, Southwest Research Inst.; and Ralph C. Stahman, Envi- ronmental Protection Agency. The problem with diesel exhaust particulate is that it is "too-small", "too-light", and there is "too-much" of it. A series of experiments are described that investigate the potential of using an alumina-coated steel wool media, for agglomeration, and an advanced design inertia separator, for collection of the particulate from a 1975 Mercedes 300D diesel car. The goal of 50 percent reduction was realized when new. The effects on other emissions, performance, and noise were evaluated and durability defined. 1 977 SA E Transactions 770717. Light-Duty Diesel Emission Correction Factors for Ambient Conditions. Charles T. Hare, South- west Research Institute; and Ronald L. Bradow, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. To determine the effects of ambient conditions on emissions from light-duty diesels, 174 emission tests were conducted on four vehicles. The major program objective was estimation of a factor to correct NOx emissions to a standard humidity. Other emissions and ambient condi- tions were also examined for relationships by regression analysis. Humidity effects on NOx emissions were found to be substantial and quite predictable. Relationships observed between other emissions and ambient conditions were relatively weak and unpredictable. Several types of NOx-humidity correction factors were estimated and compared to those already used for other vehicle and engine classes. 1977 SA E Transactions 770718. Relationships Between Exhaust Smoke Emissions and Operating Variables in Diesel Engines. Walter Bryzik, Propulsion Systems Div., U.S. Army Tank- Au tomo tive, Research and Devel- opment Command; and Charles O. Smith, Univ. of Nebraska. The study relates air/fuel ratio, fuel injection timing, and engine speed to exhaust smoke levels and performance of the diesel engine. Additional data were obtained under 105</page><page sequence="91">770719-770727 supercharged and turbocharged inlet air conditions to investigate the applicability of the derived relationships under these conditions. Limited data using a variance in fuel type were obtained. Insight into the basic mechanism of smoke formation in diesel engines was gained. The relative percentages of fuel injected before ignition (i.e., premixed fuel) and after initiation of combustion (i.e., unmixed diffusion burning fuel) were found to be extremely significant in deter- mining smoke levels. A smoke factor (the ratio of equivalence ratio in the combustion chamber at initial ignition to overall equivalence ratio) was formulated and found to be useful in predicting smoke phenomena in diesel engines. 1977 SA E Transactions 770719. Characterization of Diesel Crankcase Emissions. Charles T. Hare, Southwest Research Institute; and Thomas M. Baines, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Methods for measurement and expression of crankcase or "blowby" emissions from diesels were developed and demonstrated on a test engine. These methods were subsequently used to characterize gas and particulate emissions from two in-service engines. Crankcase emissions were evaluated under engine operating conditions corresponding to the EPA 13-mode certification test. Substances for which analyses were conducted included regulated pollutants, sulfate, trace elements, nitrosamines, individual hydrocarbons, and aldehydes. Emissions from the diesel crankcases were compared to exhaust emissions (where possible) to assess their importance. Analysis for nitrosamines was continued beyond the original effort, utilizing another test engine. 770720. Sampling and Physical Characterization of Diesel Exhaust Aerosols. John A. Verrant and David A. Kittelson, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Univ. of Minnesota. Diesel exhaust aerosols are highly dynamic and, therefore, difficult to sample without introducing falsification. This paper describes a study of these aerosols using a rapid dilution sampling system and an electrical aerosol ana- lyzer. An Onan single cylinder indirect injection engine was used as an exhaust source. The sampler diluted the exhaust with clean air in ratios of 400: 1 to 600: 1 in order to prevent sample falsification by condensation and coagulation. The electrical aerosol analyzer was used to determine particle size and concentration. Volume con- centration in the exhaust ranged from 2,000 to 50,000 /im3 cm-3 which correspond to mass loadings of 2.0 to 50 mg m-3 (assuming a density of 1 gm cm-3). Volume geometric mean diameters ranged from 0.12 to 0.19 /xm. Evaporation and coagulation effects on diesel aerosols were observed by aging in a Teflon holding bag. A simple evaporation model was fit to the decrease of aerosol volume concentration with time. The fit revealed that the aerosols evaporated as if they were composed of normal paraffins in the 350-500 molecular weight range. Although the sample dilution system used in this study may alter the sample somewhat, it is probably analogous to what happens at the tailpipe of a vehicle. Measurements taken on a test track in the exhaust plume of a Peugeot 504 diesel showed aerosol size distributions very similar to those measured in our laboratory studies. Discussion: J.

A new generation of brushless one-wire, charging systems is being developed to meet the wide range of size, performance, and durability levels required by FCIM equipment. These machines are rugged, tolerant of harsh environments, and reliable. Oil-cooling, a new concept in FCIM charging systems, is one of the major design features. 770726. Application of Maintenance-Free Battery Design to Farm, Construction, and Industrial Machinery. N. R. Eisenhut, Delco-Remy Div., General Motors Corp. A modern lead-calcium battery design (sometimes re- ferred to as "maintenance-free"), offering significant advantages in vehicle design, manufacturing and usage, has been introduced and widely accepted for many types of vehicles. It offers excellent storage properties and resistance to vibration and shock, requires no owner attention or service during its useful plate life, eliminates battery acid attack on terminals or battery retainer, significantly reduces routine service costs. New concepts, materials and technology used in this design are explained and the benefits for farm, construction and industrial machinery application are considered. 770727. The Systems Approach to Application of Gen- erators, Cranking Motors, and Batteries. G. R. Renner, Delco-Remy Div., GMC. The trend in FCIM vehicles continues toward variety, complexity, immensity, and unique function. Vehicle, engine, and component manufacturers work together in application of special generators, cranking motors, bat- teries, and wiring to meet the needs of the engine, vehicle, and operational mode. Approaches to applying electrical component systems designed to function synergistically on the vehicle are now being investigated. Experimental studies on line-haul highway tractors, using new developments combining components, hardware, instrumentation, and electrical diagnostics, show promise of improvement of generator, cranking motor, and battery life and service. Principles applied in the systems approach should be applicable in FCIM areas. 106</page><page sequence="92">770728 - 770740 770728. Self-Regulation of the Snowmobile Industry. Roy W. Muth, Snowmobile Safety and Certification Committee, Inc. The Snowmobile Safety and Certification Committee, Inc. (SSCC) is a self-regulated mechanism used as a safety arm by the snowmobile industry. Membership to this organ- ization is open to individuals and groups, private and public. By analyzing accident and injury statistics, the committee has discovered great potential for their oper- ator safety programs. Major goals of the SSCC include increasing the number of marked and maintained public trails and continued co-operation between snowmobilers, the snow- mobile industry, and the government. All is in the interest of snowmobiler training and safety. 770732. Optimization of Hydraulic Systems with Car- tridge Valves. Frank L. Foster, Snap-Tite, Inc. Energy conservation, power savings is big news these days. All new hydraulic systems must be designed to fit into this overall national policy. This can be accomplished by using a total package approach to hydraulic system design. An optimum combination of cartridge valves in an integrated circuit will provide system energy conservation, control costs, reduce installation labor, reduce field maintenance and down time. This paper summarizes the effort required to develop an optimum, integrated hydraulic circuit using cartridge valves and the advantages obtained with this approach. 770733. Agricultural Tractor Quick Disconnect Coup- lings - Present and Future. Ken Koch, Fluid Components Div., Gould Inc. A new concept in connect-under-pressure hydraulic quick disconnect coupling for use on agricultural tractors. The coupling utilizes a 2-position spool-type body, within a housing, which opens and closes the fluid passage during the connect and disconnect functions. This concept permits connecting and disconnecting under all hydraulic pressure conditions up to relief pressure, and overcomes many limitations of existing couplings. 770734. Solenoid Operated Cartridge Valves. Wayland A. Tenkku, Fluid Controls, Inc. Small solenoid operated cartridge valves provide flexi- bility to supply many functions in hydraulic systems. A line of solenoid operated two way, two position cartridge directional control valves has been developed in con- junction with a series of solenoid coils with different terminations. The coils are completely interchangeable with any of the valves. Additional development in solenoid operated car- tridge valves has resulted in a co-axial solenoid cartridge relief valve which can also utilize the same solenoid coils as the other valves. 770735. Quality Cost Reporting. Jack A. London, Inter- national Harvester Co. This paper covers the development and installation of a total quality cost reporting system in a multi-division corporation. Major cost areas are defined and identified as well as the cost elements to be included under each. The procedure for capturing and reporting departmental manpower wages and expenses is described. The devel- opment of a performance base against which to compare these costs is covered and reporting forms used by the plants and divisions are shown. 770737. A Strategy for Improving Product Quality Through Quality Awareness and Participative Management. C. R. Davis, Buick Motor Div., General Motors Corp. The customer's demand for product perfection empha- sizes the need for a more effective strategy for improving product quality. Quality awareness and the control of quality must begin when the product is conceived and should not end until the product is purchased by the customer. The control of quality must be extended to and become a way of life in the design phase and the manufacturing process phase in addition to the currently existing production phase. This can be accomplished through a participative management system involving everyone throughout the product cycle in the development of the quality goal and the quality control plan. 770738. Statistical Sampling-Acceptance-Rejection Plans. L. S. Eichelberger, Consultant - Quality Control. Although many individuals resist the use of statistics on the basis that it represents a source of confusion, the fact is that in order to sample, statistics must be implemented. The same individuals who choose to ignore the use of statistics, promote the use of sampling because it provides a simple and economical means by which a total picture may be obtained through the examination of only a few items. What these individuals fail to realize, however, is that it is not possible to make sense out of a sample result without the use of statistics. Furthermore, a sample cannot even be drawn without a statistical approach to the problem. 770740. Failure Mode and Effect Analysis. John J. Hollenback, Jr., Allis-Chalmers Corp. Before-the-fact analytical tools are often helpful in designing for reliability. The methodology is not new; however, there is a need to improve the visibility and value of the tools, and the determination of when and to what level of detail to apply them. A systematic procedure is delineated from the design logic through failure modes, loss statements, hazard classification and criticality numbers which leads directly and smoothly to product improvement, reliability and maintainability predictions, and further safety determi- nations. The net result is a quantitative ranking of the critical 107</page><page sequence="93">770741 -770749 areas of a product (or part thereof) which identifies which components will cause the most problems and where additional work may be required. 1977 SAE Transactions 770741. Integration of Component Design for a 170 Ton Off-Highway Truck. Manny H. Naft, Euclid Inc. The purpose of this paper was to explain the design of the components of the Euclid 170 ton capacity off-highway rear dump truck. The unique aspects of this Euclid design flowed from a threefold perspective: 1. box-section frame construction; 2. liquid spring suspension; 3. horizontal body-side stiffeners. Since overall vehicle performance and durability were dependent on the harmony which must be developed between major components, particular emphasis was given to an examination of the interrelationships of suspension, frame, and body. The vehicular characteristics indicated that the sus- pension system with liquid springs, while yielding a good ride also played an important role in minimizing frame and body distress. In addition, good suspension would not be possible without the proper geometrical orientation the frame design afforded. Finally, loading and haulage were seen to be dependent not only upon the body in which the load is contained, but also upon the suspension which absorbed the input shocks and the frame which eventually supported both body and load. 770742. Mobile Blast Hole Drilling Equipment. Joseph A. KulhavÃ½, Reed Tool Company, Drilling Ma- chinery Division. Excavation of rock for construction and mining requires blast hole drilling and shooting. The modern blast hole drill uses pneumatic, and mechanical systems to maximize the capabilities of the modern rotary rock bit. Each drill, regardless of its individual size or configuration, uses these systems to provide the proper amount of down force, rotation, and air to the bit. 770743. Continuous Excavator for Surface Coal Mining. F. J. Kay and J. Gordon, Foster-Miller Asso- ciates, Inc.; and Lester Crow, U.S. Bureau of Mines. A forward-rotating bucket wheel excavator designed to continuously fragment and load unshot coal has been tested in an open pit mine. In principle, the excavating wheels rotate faster than required for rolling contact with the surface so the buckets excavate, carry away material, and provide a tractive effort to aid in pulling the vehicle forward. Production rates of over 1,080 tons per hour (1,000 cubic yards per hour) have been achieved utilizing 510 hp, verifying projected fragmenting and loading cost savings of 80 percent over conventional methods. Fur- thermore, due to the uniformly small size of the coal excavated, additional savings in preparation plant costs are possible. 770744. Improved Fire Protection Systems for Surface Coal Mining Equipment. Guy A. Johnson, Bu- reau of Mines, U.S. Dept. of Interior, Twin Cities Mining Research Center. As surface coal mining equipment becomes larger, the danger to a driver during a fire emergency is increased due to the greater height of the cab above ground. Also, property damage from fires on the larger equipment can be quite substantial. To help solve this problem, the U.S. Department of Interior's Bureau of Mines has developed automatic fire sensing and suppression systems for engine compartments and fuel storage areas of large, mobile mining equipment. The prototype systems sense the Ã±ame and/or heat of a fire, then automatically suppress the fire with a B-C class, dry chemical. The systems can also be manually activated. The first system was developed in the fall and winter of 1972-73, and was successfully demonstrated during in-mine fire tests on a 100- ton-capacity truck. Other systems have been developed and in-mine tested on coal augers and large dozers. Bureau plans call for modification and long-term endurance testing of alternate systems on large drills, shovels, and draglines. 770747. Development of a New Nylon-Fiberglass Com- posite Cylindrical Bearing Retainer. Charles W. Williams, Federal-Mogul. A new retainer for cylindrical roller bearings made of fiberglass reinforced nylon containing molybdenum di- sulfide is described. The fourteen year development of the retainer, and of a battery of laboratory tests to evaluate it, are discussed. Test data including Weibull plots of endurance testing is presented. Retainer types and characteristics are discussed and compared. 1977 SAE Transactions 770748. The Effect of Fire Resistant Hydraulic Fluids on Tapered Roller Bearing Fatigue Life. David V. Culp and Ronald L. Widner, The Timken Co. Fatigue life testing was performed on tapered roller bearings using several fire resistant hydraulic fluids. The test fluids included an ester-oil blend, synthetic esters, invert emulsions and water glycols. For comparison, tests were also run in a reference petroleum oil and a petroleum type antiwear hydraulic oil of similar viscosities. Test results show that the relative bearing fatigue life compared to the reference oil ranged from 100+ percent for the ester oil blend to 14 to 24 percent for the water glycol. 1977 SAE Transactions 770749. Development of a Variable Speed Transmission for Light Tractors. Thorn W. Dickinson, Fafnir Bearing Div., Textron Inc. Traction drives date back to man's earliest attempts to transmit power. In the years following the turn of the last century many ideas for traction drive transmissions and applications were proposed. Many of these ideas were 108</page><page sequence="94">770750 - 770756 patented during this period but few became a commercial reality. We took our first look at traction transmissions in 1961 and helped design a variable speed ball drive for automotive use. As with many traction drives, the drive was dropped because of limitations imposed by the lubricating fluid and the material used for the drive elements. Two major break-throughs in the past 15 years have drastically improved the capacity of traction transmis- sions. First, new traction fluids, developed by Monsanto and Sun Oil, improve traction by 150% over previous fluids used and increase capacity proportionally. These fluids are also excellent lubricants. Second, the use of modern bearing steels in traction drives give a 300% improvement in fatigue life. This allows higher loading on the drive elements, increasing basic transmission capacity. Suddenly traction drive transmissions have become quiet, efficient competitors to hydraulic, electric and belt type variable speed drives. We have developed a prototype traction transmission over the past three years. I will describe the chronological development of this variable-speed transmission from concept to final prototype design. This new transmission is a planetary traction drive coupled to a planetary gear set, yielding infinite ratio variations in forward and reverse directions. From concept, our goal was a low cost, precision, variable speed transmission. 1977 SA E Transactions 770750. Air-Cooled vs Liquid-Cooled Transmission Oil Cooler for Heavy-Duty Vehicles. J. P. Chiou, Univ. of Detroit. For an automobile equipped with a liquid-cooled engine, the automatic transmission unit can be either air-cooled or liquid-cooled. Theoretical analysis of one liquid-cooled, and two air-cooled transmission cooling schemes were carried out. It was found that the air-cooled scheme, with the transmission oil cooler placed right behind the engine radiator in the cooling air flow path, is the most suitable for heavy duty vehicles when the system size and the fan power requirements are considered as principal evaluation criteria. Computer simulation for the cooling system of a typical heavy duty vehicle confirms this finding. 1977 SA E Transactions 770751. Electronic Control Systems for Mobile Hydro- statics. Charles R. Cornell, Eaton Corp. This 'paper discusses the application of electronics to off-highway vehicle transmission controls. While special problems have to be dealt with in vehicle applications, the growing use of on-board electronics has opened the door to greater utilization of the inherent flexibility of the hydrostatic transmission. Two production electronic control systems are pre- sented as examples. The first is a simple open-loop remote transmission ratio control system. The second is a closed-loop output speed control system with manual and automatic shutdown logic and displays to keep the driver informed of operating conditions. 770752. Multi-Variable Control for Engine Transmission Systems with Infinitely Variable Ratios. F. J. Wallace, G. Winkler and D. E. Bowns, Dept. of Engrg., Univ. of Bath (U.K.). Two systems involving an infinitely variable connection between engine and output shaft are investigated, viz: (a) the Differential Compound Engine (DCE) (b) the shunt-hydrostatic transmission coupled to a turbocharged Diesel engine. In both cases a given demanded input shaft condition can be met with a wide range of engine operating conditions. Since at least three external controls are available in both cases, viz: (a) fuel pump metering valve or governor set point (b) turbine nozzle angle (DCE) or hydrostatic motor swash (c) engine bypass (DCE) or hydrostatic pump swash Optimisation of these control settings for best overall efficiency, torque backup or minimum emissions becomes a necessity and will form an important element in traction power plant design in the future. 1977 SA E Transactions 770753. Practical Use of a Minicomputer for Stress Laboratory Testing. Keith R. Cain, J.I. Case Co. In recent years, the development of digital signal pro- cessing hardware and software has advanced to the point where problem solving capability in the test laboratory can be enhanced tremendously with a minimal invest- ment. Due to the complexity of the market place for such equipment, and seemingly naive potential customers for such equipment, there is a danger for improper equipment to be purchased. Many salesmen are not sufficiently knowledgeable in application technology and may in- advertently mislead the customer. The paper describes some of the more important aspects to consider before purchase of such equipment and further deals with some basic concepts in both hardware and software for general stress laboratory testing. 770755. High Output Diesel Engine Design Philosophy. Bob Martin and Gordon Wright, Advanced Engines Dept., John Deere Product Engineering Center. A high rate of growth in the power density of diesel engines has been experienced in the past decade. It is anticipated that the trend will continue with the rate of increase being dependent only on the rate of growth in technology. This paper will review the basic reasons for pursuing increased power density and review some of the requirements for increased technology. 770756. Very High Output Diesel Engines-A Critical Comparison of Two Stage Turbocharged, Hyper- 109</page><page sequence="95">770757 -770761 bar, and Differential Compound Engines. F. J. Wallace and G. Winkler, Univ. of Bath (U.K.). It has come to the attention of the authors, that to achieve the objective of highest output in Diesel engines for highway and off-highway applications, it is necessary to put forth suggestions dealing with combinations of specially adapted engines with their associated turbo- machinery to reach this goal of high engine output. Three alternative solutions for higher output Diesel engines and their specific advantages and disadvantages will be discussed in this paper. 770757. Energy Usage and Other Comparisons Between Gasoline and Diesel Medium Duty Trucks. Kenneth M. Jacobs, State of Maine Dept. of Transportation. Fuel consumption and other operating data on compa- rable diesel and gasoline trucks have been compiled from the records of the Maine Department of Transportation. The trucks, from the Maine highway maintenance fleet, have a GVW of approximately 24,000 pounds. Information on the use of other petroleum based products, such as engine oil and lubricants, and on required engine maintenance are given. In addition, fuel economies for the diesel and gasoline trucks by year during winter and summer operations are compared to enable consideration of seasonal effects. The data is for a four year operating period from 1972 through 1976 representing fiscal years 1973 through 1976. In general, the diesel trucks used approximately one-third less fuel than comparable gasoline trucks. 770758. Economics of Manufacturing Automotive Diesel Fuel. T. O. Wagner, Amoco Oil Company, Chicago, Illinois. Several automobile manufacturers have announced in- tentions to offer diesel-powered cars and light trucks for the United States market. Petroleum refineries in the U.S. are strongly oriented toward gasoline manufacture, and introduction of diesel-powered cars and trucks in quantity would require a major change in product mix. To determine the impact these vehicles might have on the petroleum industry, we recently analyzed the economics of manufacturing greater amounts of automotive diesel fuel. We found that with a favorable crude slate, a typical U.S. refinery could make up to 30 percent of total motor fuel as diesel fuel without unusual problems. Cetane quality that could be produced economically would depend on crude composition; while 45 cetane fuel would probably not be troublesome, large amounts of 50 cetane fuel would involve substantial extra costs with certain crudes. Contrary to popular opinion, switching from gasoline to diesel fuel manufacture does not yield significant saving in refinery energy consumption. Manufacture of diesel fuel rather than an equal volume of gasoline consumes more crude oil because the diesel fuel weighs more per gallon. It also requires additional investments because some refinery facilities must be expanded. For a refinery to maintain revenue, the price of diesel fuel relative to gasoline must rise signif- icantly if diesel fuel demand grows. 1977 SA E Transactions 770759. Another Look at Alternative Fuel Options. R. W. Hum, Energy Research and Development Ad- ministration. Alternatives to petroleum-derived transportation fuels can be produced from oil shale, coal, and from a variety of carbonaceous materials including both cultivated biomass and waste materials. In the long-term, hydrogen, often mentioned as an alternative fuel, may be used as an energy carrier or transfer agent; it should not, however, be considered as an energy resource. Among the alternatives, coal-derived or shale-derived fuels could become signif- icant in the national supply within the century. The other alternatives are long-term (post-2000), or, at least without extensive resource development, they are resource-limited. Any identifiable shale-derived fuel probably will appear as conventional finished fuel-either gasoline or distillate. More likely, however, the shale-derived com- ponent of fuels will not be identifiable because any shale oil available for the manufacture of transportation fuels within the foreseeable future will be blended with natural crude and used as refinery feedstock. Coal-derived fuels may be methanol, gasoline from methanol, or conventional gasolines or distillate-type fuels either synthesized from coal or refined from coal syn- crude, i.e., a "liquefied" coal. Methanol or a methanol derivative would be produced using coal gasification as the primary conversion process. The technology for coal gasification is well established whereas that for coal liquefaction is not fully developed. For this reason methanol or methanol-derived gasoline are the alternative fuels most likely of production if non-petroleum fuels were to be required in the immediate future. The next most likely would be conventional fuels from coal synthesis by the SASOL process. The evidence available to date indicates that should gasoline or distillate be made from either coal or shale oil those fuels will not differ markedly from traditional fuels. 770761. Planetary Wheel Drive Powers Agricultural Ve- hicles. James D. Wiggins, Warner Gear Div., Borg-Warner Corp. The planetary wheel drive has proved to be of consid- erable advantage in powering hydrostatic agricultural vehicles. This type final drive combines the advantages of a highly efficient gear set and the design flexibility and operating characteristics inherent in the hydrostatic drive system, to provide a cost-effective substitute for the conventional mechanical drivetrain. In addition, the planetary wheel drive's compact modular design facilitates the ease of maintenance desirable for drive units operating in the farm equipment environment. 110</page><page sequence="96">770762 - 770770 770762.

The Unsteady Gas Flow Behaviour in a Charge Cooled Rotary Piston Engine. G. P. Blair and R. Fleck, Mechanical and Industrial Engrg. Dept., The Queen's Univ. of Belfast (Northern Ire- land). Mathematical models of the open cycle gas exchange process and the closed cycle combustion process are developed for a Wankel engine. The theoretical model of the complete engine operating cycle is programmed for a digital computer and the results are shown for a small single rotor charge cooled Wankel engine. The predicted pressure diagrams in the working chamber and in the inlet, transfer and exhaust ducts are compared with measured values as is the predicted volumetric efficiency relationship with engine speed. The predicted charging efficiency relationship with engine speed is also compared with the measured brake mean effective pressure char- acteristic to demonstrate the usefulness of the theoretical model. 770764. The Evaluation of a Semi-Anechoic Chamber Used for Small-Engine Sound Analyses. Richard A. Dykstra, Kohler Co.; and Donald E. Baxa, University of Wisconsin - Extension. In 1973, Kohler Co. completed the construction of a semi-anechoic chamber, to be used for the acoustical analyses of its small-engine (4-24 HP) line. This paper discusses the acoustical response characteristics of Kohler Co.'s semi-anechoic chamber. The chamber is first evaluated as a system. Then, an analysis of the room's sound absorptive wedges is discussed. 770766. Emission Control of Two-Stroke Automobile Engine. Hisao Uchiyama, Takahiro Chiku and Shigemasa Sayo, Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd. It has been considered that 2-stroke engine is not able to meet requirements of the Japanese exhaust emission standard of 1978. However, we have been able to bring Suzuki 2-stroke engirte to the prescribed level by employing newly developed 2-stage catalyst system which uses the im- proved catalyst. The aims of the 2-stage catalyst system are 1) to have large SV. 2) to supply ample secondary air. In consequence, the system is able to lower the operating temperature of the catalyst, which results in its longer life. We have succeeded in development of specially surface-treated catayst very much improved in HC- reduction, heat resistance and durability. 1977 SA E Transactions 770767. Safety and Comfort in an Uncontrolled Envi- ronment. V. C. Pierrot, Forestry Products Div., John Deere Dubuque Works. Statistics from insurance companies and census bureaus show that workers in the logging industry suffer unusually high accident and fatality rates. Significant improvements in woods safety can be realized by mechanizing manual operations. Taking the worker off the forest floor and placing him on a machine can increase safety and productivity. Providing an enclosed operator's station on the machine offers safety as well as comfort. Minimum sound levels, temperate environments, and good visibility are some of the features that contribute to operator safety and comfort in an uncontrolled environment. 770768. Applying the "Pressure" to a Liquid Spring Off-Highway Truck Suspension. Manny H. Naft and Peter P. Seabase, Euclid, Inc. The compliance provided by the spring in a vehicle suspension system is vital to reduce dynamic inputs from loads and surface irregularities.

Liquid springs exhibit a desirable combination of simplicity, safety, compact size and excellent dynamic response and ease of servicing. 770769. Ferrographic Evaluation of Pump Contaminant Wear. R. K. Tessmann and G. E. Maroney, Fluid Power Research Center, Oklahoma State University. This paper presents the results of research conducted in contaminant wear of fluid power components. Most of this research and development effort has focused upon hydraulic pumps and pumping type mechanisms. Re- cently, work was initiated using Ferrographic analysis to correlate the wear debris generated during contaminant wear testing with the degradation in performance of hydraulic pumps. The paper demonstrates the correlation of generated wear debris with the performance degra- dation of such components. 1977 SA E Transactions 770770.

Rolland Nielson, J. N. Fauver Co. The first section of this paper is a discussion of twenty four practical considerations of designing hydrostatic and hydraulic drives. It is intended to cover some of the more common mistakes made in circuit design. It includes suggestions on how to avoid the problems and in some cases specific examples of components that are available that could be considered. The second section is a "checklist" of questions that are designed to help the designer recognize the potential problem and probe for the solutions. Many times, simply recognizing the problem automatically brings forth a solution. That's the idea behind this paper. 1977 SA E Transactions 770774.

Highly reliable, efficient performance is assured by thorough dynamometer and field tests. Propel performance can be predicted on a load/life basis for each specific application. Design logic for the selection of planetary gearing is reviewed and other design features are discussed. The importance of testing for rating confirmation is stressed. The purpose of this paper is to highlight what has proven to be a successful approach to the design, testing and application of planetary gear speed reducers for hydrostatic crawler propel systems. The design concepts embody application of high speed low torque hydraulic motors to low speed high torque output requirements. 770775. The Design and Development of a Heavy-Duty, Off-Highway Diesel Engine Family: Part 1 - Engine Concept and Design. Part 2 - Component Testing and Engine Development. H. W. Barnes-Moss, A. R. Crouch, P. J. S. Ritchie and K. C. Barnes-Moss, Ricardo &amp; Co. Engineers (1927) Ltd. (England). A family of 3, 4 and 6-cylinder diesel engines with na and tc options was designed for use in a range of off-highway vehicles. Special requirements included robust construc- tion, maximum reliability, a hydraulic pto up to a maximum equivalent to the power of the 4-cylinder na engine and low noise levels. Reference is made to the engine design, component rig testing and subsequent engine development. The engine concept and design are described in detail in part 1 and the engine performance development together with the use of models, rigs and component tests in part 2. 770777. A New Method of Valve Cam Design - HYSDYNE Cam. Hiroshi Kanesaka and Kishiro Akiba, Isuzu Motors Ltd. (Japan); and Hiroshi Sakai, Univ. of Tokyo. The choice of cam profile is a matter of primary significance in the procedure of valve gear design. It is long since dynamic design methods were first proposed and used, but even so, shortcomings still exist. One is that the conventional method does not take into account the non-linearity and hysteresis characteristics of valve train stiffness. This paper describes a new dynamic design method of determining cam profile, including the ramp period, in which the above hysteresis characteristics as well as other factors are reasonably taken into consideration. Experimental investigations have shown that the new method is effective over a wide range of operating conditions. 1977 SA E Transactions 770778. A Practical Review of High Voltage Safety Devices for Mobile Cranes. George S. Allin, Jack T. Wilson and Richard E. Zibolski, Har- nischfeger Corp. This paper presents a discussion of insulators and power line proximity warning systems sold by suppliers of auxiliary equipment for use on mobile cranes. These devices are offered as a solution to the problem of crane booms, loads and load lines accidentally contacting electric power lines. This discussion shows that insulator devices and electronic warning systems do not solve the problem of preventing these accidents. The number of these accidents will only be reduced when those having administrative and supervisory re- sponsibility of work projects near power lines recognize the hazard and take precautions before work is begun. Effective planning including consulting with power companies to determine precautions is the only depend- able solution to the problem. 770781. 3000 Ton Capacity Ship-Mounted Revolving Crane for the North Sea Oil Industry. Carl W. Ireland, American Hoist and Derrick Co. To meet the demands of continually increasing energy requirements, the off-shore operations to explore and recover petroleum deposits from beneath the ocean bottom are taking place under increasingly difficult environmental conditions. This has led to the devel- 112</page><page sequence="98">770782 - 770795 opment of types of equipment well beyond the possibil- ities or the imaginable future requirements of twenty years ago. When conditions require the fabrication of off-shore platforms on land, to be floated to the erection site, lifted and placed as a single unit of up to 3000 tons, revolving cranes capable of performing such lifts become a nec- essary part of that development. 770782. Modern Gear Pumps are 95% Efficient or Better. E. J. Rock, Dowty Corp. The causes of increasing pressure levels in gear pumps are discussed and the reasons for the necessity to maintain high volumetric efficiency at all conditions including high pressure are presented. The P3000 and P4000 ranges of pumps are described, with emphasis on the features contributing to high pressure capability and efficiency. 770790. Development of a Pure Methanol Fuel Car. Holger Menrad, Wenpo Lee and Winfried Bernhardt, Volks wagen werk AG (Germany). Methanol as a fuel for spark ignition engines offers a lot of advantages in comparison to gasoline. Results of a prototype passenger car fueled with pure methanol show promising aspects of lower energy consumption, higher energy output and more favorable emission figures. Modifications on the engine are limited, the un- favorable cold start and warm up behavior of pure methanol can be eliminated by the use of suitable additives. 770791. Effect of Compression Ratio on Exhaust Emis- sions and Performance of a Methanol -Fueled Single-Cylinder Engine. Norman D. Brinkman, General Motors Research Laboratories. One of the reasons methanol is considered an attractive alternative fuel for automobiles is its high octane quality, which may allow the use of high compression ratio (CR) engines. To evaluate compromises between engine effi- ciency and exhaust emissions, a methanol-fueled single- cylinder engine was run at CR's from 8 to 18. At each CR, engine speed and airflow were constant at 1200 rpm and about half throttle, respectively; equivalence ratio (0) was varied from 0.7 to 1.1; and spark timing was varied from best power (MBT) to 10Â° retarded. Knock was observed only at CR = 18 with MBT spark timing. Increasing CR from 8 to 18 while maintaining MBT spark timing increased efficiency about 16 percent, but also increased NOx and unburned fuel (UBF) emissions. Some previous studies have reported decreased NOx emissions with increased CR, possibly because MBT spark timing was not maintained. Results of this study indicate that constant NOx emissions can be maintained by retarding spark timing while increasing CR to improve efficiency. Retarding spark timing, however, only mar- ginally reduced UBF emissions. Vehicle tests are necessary to define the optimum CR for methanol fueling because exhaust emission trends and knocking teudency may be different than those observed with this single-cylinder engine. 770792. Methanol as a Fuel: A Review with Bibliography. David L. HÃ¤gen, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Univ. of Minnesota. A survey of recent studies and research on methanol is given within the historical context. Fuel related properties are reviewed and compared with isooctane. Combustion emissions and their variation with temperature and fuel preparation are similarly compared. Uses of methanol as a combustion fuel and recent tests in boilers, turbines, conventional and stratified charge Otto engines, and Diesel engines are discussed emphasizing comparative efficiencies. Current developments on the uses of meth- anol directly and indirectly in fuel cells and as a feedstock for single cell protein are examined. The relevant biological, physical and chemical hazards of using methanol as a fuel are discussed together with safety precautions and treatment. A comprehensive bibliography is given covering the above topics. 1977 SA E Transactions 770794. Alternative Diesel Engine Fuels: An Experi- mental Investigation of Methanol, Ethanol, Meth- ane and Ammonia in a D.I. Diesel Engine with Pilot Injection. Klaus Bro and Peter Sunn Pedersen, The Tech. Univ. of Denmark. The results of an experimental investigation of Methanol, Ethanol, Methane and Ammonia as primary fuels for a high speed direct injection diesel engine are described. The fuels were added to the intake air and ignited by injection of a small amount of pilot diesel fuel (30 percent on energy basis). All of the four fuels were found applicable with Methane as the most suitable and Ammonia as the least suitable. Experimental data are presented regarding engine power output, efficiency, smoke and gaseous emissions, and the different types of combustion observed during the experiments are discussed. 770795. An Experimental Investigation of a Coal-Slurry Fueled Diesel Engine. H. P. Marshall, Virginia Polytechnic Inst. &amp; State Univ.; and D. C. Walters, Jr., Walters Repair and Restoration. A single cylinder 1360 cc diesel engine was operated on a slurry of 15 per cent by weight solvent refined coal and jet fuel. The coal was pulverized to a nominal size of 2 micrometers. The initial investigation began with nozzle bench tests which ascertained that the slurry would flow through the injection nozzle and form acceptable spray patterns. An instrumentation system was assembled to monitor and record engine operating conditions, which included pressure-time fluctuations in the combustion chamber, fuel consumption, power output, and noise. Photo-micrographs of the injection nozzle pin and 113</page><page sequence="99">770796 - 770803 injection pump plunger are presented for wear compar- ison before and after slurry operation. Test results indicate that the slurry fuel provides engine power and fuel consumption levels comparable to those of diesel and jet fuels. Although wear rates appeared moderate, conventional fuel injection systems are inad- equate for long-term use because the clearances in the injection pump and nozzle are too small for slurry operation. 770796. Study of Mixtures of Methane and Carbon Dioxide as Fuels in a Single Cylinder Engine (CLR). John K. S. Wong, National Research Council (Canada). A single cylinder four stroke gasoline engine (CLR) was used to investigate the feasibility of using sewer gas as an alternate fuel while modification to the engine was kept to a minimum. Results indicated that using sewer gas having quality of 65/35 in methane/carbon dioxide volume ratio on the "as is" basis, engine power losses could be kept below 22% compared to those obtained with gasoline. Corresponding improvements in brake specific fuel con- sumption could be as high as 30%. UHC, NO, and CO emissions were reduced. 770797. Hydrogen-Fueled Turbine Boat Demonstration. Allen E. Ford, David W. Taylor Naval Ship Research and Development Center. One of two United Aircraft of Canada Ltd Model ST6B-68 gas turbine engines, that power a 36-foot Swimmer Reconnaissance Craft, was modified to burn hydrogen fuel. The fuel nozzles and sheaths of the natural gas conversion kit were modified to eliminate combustion chamber hot spots and a higher sparking rate igniter helped eliminate "pop" starts. The hydrogen-fueled turbine was safely operated at full power with a cooler combustion chamber liner than was exhibited when burning diesel fuel. No hydrogen fuel-related problems occurred during boat operation. 770798. An Advanced Driver Education Program. R. A. Whitworth, Traffic Safety Dept., General Mo- tors Proving Ground. This paper describes An Advanced Driver Education Program developed at General Motors Proving Ground. The program is designed around the concept of training drivers to handle specific driving emergencies that accident causation data indicates are driver problems. The method of determining the driving emergencies which are problem areas are discussed in detail as are the individual training exercises. Evaluation of this program by means of comparing trained and untrained control groups indicates a large reduction in both numbers of accidents and accident severity. 770799. Advanced Driver Training - We Can Live with It. Gerald Christensen, Kansas State Dept. of Education. Today, educators look more towards competency learning skills and less towards the basic understanding of insurance, the changing of tires, and parking. In the advanced driver training program, students are introduced to the complexities of advanced driving in a manner that enables them to better appreciate the engineering of the vehicle as it relates to maneuvering capabilities. 770801. Advanced Driver Training Evaluation and De- velopment. Richard F. Pain, BioTechnology, Inc. Today, as in past years, considerable interest exists in the ability of the person in an automobile to avoid or evade rapidly impending collision situations. Much research and development has been conducted on vehicle performance capabilities to maneuver in such situations. The other component of collision avoidance is the driver. This paper summarizes recent developments for improving people performance in the avÃµidance situation. Two lines of development will be described: a large-scale evaluation of advanced driver training followed by an analytic study of the driver in avoidance situations. Usually analytic studies precede development and implementation; however, two projects described herein are in reverse order. Evaluation data and experience were gained by conducting training using the best available off-the-shelf advanced driver training materials. Based on these (and other) results, directions for further research or development were determined. In this case the evaluation indicated there was sufficient promise but many unsolved questions about accident avoidance. Thus an analytic study on the benefits and nature of accident avoidance training was warranted. The first part of the analytic study was described as the second part of this paper. 1977 SAE Transactions 770802. A Realistic Approach to Automobile Accident Avoidance Training. James R. Bathurst, Jr., Essex Corp. A different approach to training automobile accident avoidance driving skills is being developed. It is structured to provide students the opportunity to practice selecting and implementing effective crash avoidance strategies in response to realistic conflict situations that often precede actual accidents. Two new teaching techniques have been developed to provide this realistic experience in dealing with both single-car (the student driver's) and two-car situations. These techniques are used to administer a seven-module driver training course that has also just been developed. 770803. Development of a Front-Wheel-Drive Car. Rempei Matsumoto, Gyo-ichi Hataya, Mamoru Morinaga and Teruhisa Tsukada, Subaru Tech- nical Center, Fuji Heavy Industries, Ltd. Development of front-wheel-drive car in Japan began about ten years ago, and it is in a good state today. 114</page><page sequence="100">770804-770810 Principal difficulties to be removed in the early stage of development were the problem of gradeability and that of constant velocity sliding universal joint. After many endeavors, a front-wheel-drive car equipped with hori- zontally opposed four cylinder engine was realized. This configuration has, to add to the proper superiorities of front-wheel-drive car, advantages in respect of vibration, cornering ability, crashworthiness, safety for pedestrians and ease of designing four-wheel-drive car. 770804. Weight-Conscious Automobile Design. Frederick J. Hooven and Francis E. Kennedy, Dartmouth College. A study has been conducted to evaluate the potential for weight reduction of automobiles. Vehicle designs have been studied for which reduced weight is of primary importance and these weight-conscious designs are pre- sented for each of the following size (roominess) classes: 4-passenger, 5-passenger, and 6-passenger. Each of the designs is functionally equivalent to the best of current U.S. practice for its size classification and makes use of conventional materials and construction techniques. The designs are proposed as optimum designs for their roominess class from a weight standpoint. 770805. An Analysis of Automobile Weight and Its Reduction by Aluminum Substitution. Francis E. Kennedy and Frederick J. Hooven, Dartmouth College. It is well known that the weights of different vehicle components or subsystems are not independent of one another. In this paper an analysis of existing vehicle designs is used as a basis for the development of influence coefficients which relate a weight change in an automobile component to the total vehicle weight change that could result. It is found, for example, that a ten pound decrease in the weight of a body part could lead to a total vehicle weight reduction of 14 pounds, assuming that other vehicle components are redesigned to account for the smaller load they need to support. As an application of the use of the influence coef- ficients, a study is made of the potential weight reduction that could be achieved by substitution of aluminum for steel in selected vehicle components. 770807. The Relationship between Occupant Safety and the Proportion of Small Cars on the Road. Fred L. Preston and James O'Day, Highway Safety Research Institute. In the past there has been much data presented indicating a shift toward increasing the small car population would adversely affect occupants. Obviously in an unequal two-vehicle collision, the small car is at a disadvantage. In the available data presented relative to two-vehicle collisions only, however, the unadjusted fatality rates show that a small car is much safer than a large car. Although this result is obtained because of the preponderance of young people in small cars, even after adjusting the results to account for expected age distri- bution of the driving population the small-small collision is slightly less severe than the large-large collision. Small cars, in this study, are cars weighing less than 3500 lb. This analysis shows optimism for the future, and it appears that occupants are at an advantage if involved in two- vehicle collisions while in small cars. 1977 SA E Transactions 770808. The Effects of Vehicle Size on Passenger Car Occupant Death Rates. Brian O'Neill, Marvin Ginsburg and Leon Robertson, Insurance Insti- tute for Highway Safety. Data on deaths of car occupants during the calendar year 1975 were obtained from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Fatal Accident Reporting System, and national vehicle registration counts were obtained from R. L. Polk National Profile as of July 1, 1975. Occupant deaths per 10,000 registered cars in the 1971 through 1974 model years were examined by vehicle size. Occupant death rates generally increase as car size decreases. The relationship between smaller cars and increased deaths is especially pronounced in frontal crashes, and in car into other vehicle crashes. Because of this, increased occupant crash protection in frontal crashes - such as provided by air bags and passive seat belts - could substantially reduce much of the disadvan- tage presently faced by occupants of small cars. 770809. Lightweight Versus Heavyweight - The Contest of the Future. Robert F. McLean, The John Z. DeLorean Corp. Possible future trends in highway accident injuries and fatalities are established through 1985. The change in vehicle mix is estimated on a year by year basis. Owing to the greater risk of injury and death on the part of occupants of small cars relative to large cars, a rising trend is seen as the proportion of lightweight vehicles on the highway increases. The study assumes no changes in the use of occupant restraint systems. 770810. Real Octane Requirement for Safe Operation of Gasoline Engines. G. F. Zanoni, AGIP S.p.A. (Italy). This paper reports the results of a work program conducted in Italy during 1975 and 1976 by the C.U.N.A. Octane Requirement Working Group aimed at estab- lishing the minimum Octane Number in Primary Ref- erence Fuels (PRF) corresponding to a knock intensity which does not induce mechanical engine damage; this O.N. level is indicated as "Real Octane Requirement". The experimental work, conducted by the ESSO, FIAT, MOBIL and SNAMPROGETTI-AGIP Research Laboratories, consisted in running endurance bench tests at 4,000 and 5,000 r.p.m., full load, for 50 hrs (sometimes 100 hrs). The test fuel used was a gasoline having such an Octane rating that would cause the test engine to knock with an intensity equal to that induced by a PRF having 115</page><page sequence="101">770811 -770818 an octane rating 2, 3, or 4 units lower than the PRF causing audible trace knock. The AO.N. = -2, -3, or -4 was defined as "Octane deficiency" relative to the O.R. determined as trace knock according to the standard procedure. The bench tests have been complemented with field tests run with cars equipped with an air brake and operated at constant speed and full load. On the whole, 37 tests have been performed using the most critical Italian engines; 29 tests were run on the bench and 8 on the road. These tests followed a study aimed at establishing the relationship between engine parameters and knock inten- sity. 770811. Road Octane Number Trends of Japanese Pas- senger Cars. K. Date, T. Nishizaki and T. Maeda, Nippon Mining Co., Ltd. (Japan). To develop empirical road octane number (RdON) equations and to obtain the relationship between high speed RdON and fuel quality, RdON were determined by the Modified Uniontown Technique (MUT) and the Modified Borderline Technique (MBL) using 1974 and 1975 Japanese passenger cars. The effects of RON and DON on RdON-MUT were more pronounced than that of MON. Aromatic and olefin hydrocarbon types had little influence on RdON-MUT. RdON-MBL measured at low speed was similar to RdON-MUT. As speed increased, however, it was influ- enced by MON. Road octane number depreciation (ARdON) at high speed was increased with sensitivity or olefin content. 770812. What Color Should Rear Turn Signals Be? Erwin G. Hitzemeyer and Helmut Wilde, Volkswagen- werk AG; and Donald Ellenberger, Volkswagen of America, Inc. Once optional, flashing turn signals have become standard equipment on motor vehicles around the world. However, distinctness of rear turn signals is often lost when combined in the same compartments with stop lamps of the same size, intensity, color and location. In the U.S., a proposed solution is physically separating the function, while other countries effect separation by color. The SAE is investigating more realistic red/yellow lamp outputs that would permit use of universal lamps, while in Germany, manufacturers have surveyed many experi- enced American and Canadian drivers to determine preference for the color of these lamps. 1977 SAE Transactions 770813. Measuring Driver Performance: Instrumentation, Software, and Application. David K. Damkot, Henry A. Geller and David G. Whitmore, Univ. of Vermont. A data collection and analysis system is described for an instrumented car research program. Transducers, elec- tronic circuitry, and data recording are described, and data analysis procedures are indicated. Discussion in- cludes the current experiments underway in the research program. System strengths and weakness are also indi- cated. 770814. Procedures to Evaluate the Effectiveness of PMVI. Geoffrey K. Bentley and Richard W. Heidt, Systems Div., AVCO. Twenty-eight states and the District of Columbia have some form of PMVI system. Of paramount concern is the question of how effective the state PMVI system is in suppressing vehicle defects. A technique has been developed by which a state can evaluate the effectiveness of PMVI in reducing vehicle defect level below that which would exist without inspection. By sampling vehicle-in-use condition as a function of time since last state inspection, a data analysis-evaluation procedure can be used to determine both quantities of interest-average safety status of cars with inspection and the same condition without inspec- tion. Data collection procedures consistent with the evaluation objective are also presented. 770815. Rear-End Crash Characteristics and Fuel System Safety. Tsuneo Okamoto, Fumio Shiba and Masakazu Yamada, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan). To prevent fuel leakage in rear-end collisions, the body deformation characteristics must correspond with the arrangement of the fuel system components. This paper explains the characteristics of vehicle body deformation in rear-end collisions and discusses a sim- plified method for controlling vehicle body crush modes. The paper further explains how to prevent a crushed fuel tank by lowering the stiffness of the fuel tank support unit. The application of these methods will make it possible for even a subcompact car with the fuel system located within the crush zone to be developed into a safe vehicle free from fuel leakage. 770818. Emissions from Diesel Versions of Production Passenger Cars. Karl J. Springer, Southwest Research Institute; and Thomas M. Baines, Environmental Protection Agency. The advent of diesel-powered versions of production passenger cars signals significant dieselization in the United States. Two vehicles, an experimental Oldsmobile diesel Cutlass and a Volkswagen diesel-powered Rabbit, were evaluated to determine their gaseous, particulate, smoke, odor, and noise emissions. For comparison, a 1977 Oldsmobile Cutlass powered by the 260 CID gasoline engine and a 1.6 liter gasoline fuel injected Volkswagen Rabbit (California version) were similarly evaluated under most emission categories. Three transient driving cycles were employed including those used in emissions certi- fication, sulfate testing, and highway fuel economy. 1977 SAE Transactions 116</page><page sequence="102">770819 -770829 770819. Pontiac's New 2.5 Litre 4 Cylinder Engine. John M. Sawruk, Pontiac Motor Div., General Mo- tors Corp. Pontiac has designed a new 2.5 Litre four-cylinder engine which overcomes many of the current objections to this type of engine. The engine is smooth, quiet, powerful, durable, and fuel efficient. In addition, it has excellent driveability. The approaches used to achieve this situation included a review of the components which create the vertical secondary shake force in light of the mathematics involved, a unique intake manifold design, and parasitic power consumption control in several engine areas. 770821. Buick's New Even Firing 90Â° V-6 Engine. D. M. Manner and R. A. Miller, Buick Motor Div., General Motors Corp. The new 3.8 litre engine is a 90Â° V-6 even firing design. This engine features a new split-pin crankshaft which changes the timing intervals from the original 150Â° - 90Â° - 150Â° - 90Â° - 150Â° - 90Â° to uniform firing of 120Â° between cylinders. Accomplished without changes to the original cylinder block, the new crankshaft design required that changes be made to the connecting rod and bearing and timing changes to the ignition and valves. Structural changes were made to the crankshaft and piston to reduce stress and provide excellent durability. The engine balance of a 90Â° even firing V-6 engine has primary rotating unbalance of varying magnitude and cannot be reduced to zero with crankshaft counter- weighting. This characteristic offers the opportunity for several final balance selections which are presented. 770822. The General Motors 33 Litre 90Â° V-6 Engine Designed by Chevrolet. J. S. Zwerner, Chevrolet Motor Div., General Motors Corp. A new 3.3 litre engine with 90Â° V-6 configuration was developed to maintain pace with lightweight car pro- grams. Chevrolet optimized the new engine from the stand point of package size and weight efficiency. Also springing from the mandates for stringent fuel economy on the cars to be driven in the future, came the necessity for smaller, more efficient power plants. Con- version of existing facilities enabled the manufacturer to minimize the cost of the new engine program and allow manufacturing to keep pace with the trend toward smaller displacement engines. Excellent fuel economy and responsive performance are lhe results of the combined engine-vehicle package. 770823. The Manufacture of Automotive Sponge Body Seals. G. Morningstar and J. L. Rees, Sheller- Globe Corp. A review of the manufacture of automotive sponge body seals will be presented. A brief historical listing of the various types of materials such as closed cell, open cell, latex foam and urethane foam will be discussed. General compound information will be presented. The rationale between compounding and the balancing of the blow and cure rates will be covered. The processing of sponge rubber body seals is with respect to mixing, extrusion, molding of corners and details sometimes containing inserts via compression transfer and injection techniques and painting will also be reviewed. The SAE Classification of Sponge Rubber will be explained in so far as it is related to sponge body seals, their physical properties and characteristics. New and future developments in seal design and manufacturing techniques will be discussed. 770824. Determining Airless Sprayability of Materials. Norman R. Roobol, General Motors Institute; and Daniel C. Hutchinson, Jack W. Baldwin and Jack L. Mand, Fisher Body Central Engi- neering. Pressures and flow rates were adjusted to maximize sprayability for a range of viscous materials. Correlations were sought between sprayability and the three properties density, viscosity, and cohesiveness. Only cohesiveness matched sprayability of these materials. A simple test for cohesiveness is presented. 770825. The Application of Interferometry to Air Fuel Ratio Measurement in Quiescent Chamber Diesel Engines. J. C. Dent, J. H. Keightley and C. D. De Boer, Loughborough Univ. of Technology (England). Applying holographic interferometry, local instantaneous air fuel ratio has been measured in the evaporating fuel spray injected into the quiescent combustion space of a motored engine cylinder. Application of similarity principles indicate how the technique might be applied to the scaling of actual engine processes, thereby facilitating their study on smaller experimental engines and isothermal "bombs". 1977 SAE Transactions 770828. Effects of a Barium-Based Fuel Additive on Particulate Emissions from Diesel Engines. N. D. Apostolescu, R. D. Matthew and R. F. Sawyer, Univ. of California-Berkeley. The use of barium-containing smoke suppressant diesel fuel additive was investigated. Effects on particulate reduction, other pollutant emissions, and performance were explored over a range of speed and load conditions. The particulate emissions were analysed gravimetrically and reported in terms of particle concentration and emissions index. Public health aspects of use of the additive are discussed. 770829. Carbon: Cause of Diesel Engine Wear? Fred G. Rounds, GM Research Laboratories. Diesel soot (carbon) contamination of engine oil appears to be the cause of higher valve train wear in diesel engines 117</page><page sequence="103">770830-770835 than in gasoline engines with similar metallurgy. Four-ball wear studies to determine the mechanism by which carbon reduces the antiwear benefit of zinc dithiophosphates (ZDP's) indicate that the higher wear is due to preferential adsorption of the ZDP decomposition products by the soot thus reducing the formation of the antiwear surface coating. Adsorption of undecomposed ZDP, changes in ZDP decomposition reactions and abrasive removal of the surface coating were eliminated as significant contributors to higher wear.

This* paper presents an overview of the aluminum automotive radiator as seen today. After many years of research and development, including numerous large field tests, the aluminum radiator is finding a place in the European market. The paper looks at past efforts, what is happening today, and some evaluations for the future. It discusses options which are available to the manufacturer in selecting a radiator design and a joining process that meets immediate and long-range objectives. Costs and product reliability are the primary consid- erations in any new product or production change. However, increasing emphasis is being placed on long- range goals consistent with national policy on energy conservation and elimination of water and air pollution. Consequently, low product weight and fluxless joining have moved into the priority column for radiator con- struction. Advances in aluminum joining have concen- trated on pollution-free processes. This factor, coupled with the lightweight metal, new material advances and aluminum's relative price stability, have advanced the aluminum radiator to its highest point of interest and use in its long effort for market acceptance. 770832. A Unique Cooling Approach Makes Aluminum Alloy Cylinder Heads Cost Effective. Robert P. Ernest, Reciprocating Engines Research, En- gineering and Research Staff, Ford Motor Company. The objective of this paper is to introduce the design of a unique cooling approach for internal combustion engines which results in a major weight reduction with virtually no cost penalty. This paper reveals details of a design that solves the problems of utilizing aluminum alloys instead of a cast iron alloys for internal combustion engine cylinder head material without incurring the large cost penalties cur- rently associated with this procedure. This is accom- plished by the invention of a unique cooling system that scientifically controls the operating temperature of all vital areas of the cylinder head without using a sand cored water jacket passage. Eliminating the sand water jacket core from the manufacturing process of making cylinder head castings also allows the sand exhaust port core to be eliminated. Elimination of these cores results in sub- stantial cost savings over conventional cast aluminum alloy cylinder heads. Additional cost savings result from the simple push-in exhaust port liners that can be used with this concept plus the reduction of ten pounds of coolant in a 5 litre V-8 engine. A complete analysis of the unique cooling system is presented. This analysis is backed up by experimental data on flow velocities, pressure drops in all coolant passages plus actual engine data which include a full temperature, heat balance, octane and durability com- parison with cast-iron cylinder heads. 1977 SA E Transactions 770833. Energy Conservation Through the Use of Multi- graded Gear Oils in Trucks. B. M. O'Connor, W. S. Romig and L. F. Schiemann, The Lubrizol Corporation. Studies of selected automotive gear lubricants in heavy truck tandem axles and transmissions have revealed improvements in fuel economy associated with the viscosity of lubricants tested (grades 75W, 75W-90, and 80W-140). The testing included a heavy truck on-highway fleet test and test track operation. Standard laboratory gear tests on light viscosity monograde (SAE 75W) oils indicate that oils of this type may be deficient in EP protection. Combined observa- tions show that there may be a critical balance between axle lubricant fuel economy benefits and axle durability in field service. 770834. The Effect of MoS2 Based Lubricants on Auto- motive Gear Efficiency and Operating Temper- atures. David A. Gresty, Ernest J. Kunz, Jr. and Thomas J. Risdon, AMAX Inc. In order to achieve the federally mandated fuel economy standards for automotive vehicles, passenger car and truck rear axle and differential lubrication must become more efficient. The results of this study indicate potential for improvement in axle efficiency if MoS2 based lubricants are used. 770835. Fuel Economy - Contribution of the Rear Axle Lubricant. P. A. Willermet and L. T. Dixon, Ford Motor Co. Axle dynamometer tests were carried out to evaluate the effects of rear axle lubricant viscosity-temperature behav- ior and frictional characteristics on vehicle fuel economy. Using a Ford 9 inch 2.75:1.0 ratio axle, a set of input speed and load conditions was selected to permit simu- lation of the CVS and EPA highway driving cycles. Lubricant temperature was varied from -30Â°C to 100Â°C to simulate seasonal climatic effects. Data obtained for three lubricants differing in viscosity-temperature behavior were interpreted assuming a lubrication model including 118</page><page sequence="104">770836 - 770842 both elastohydrodynamic and mixed lubrication condi- tions. From these data, fuel economy projections were made using a vehicle simulation computer program. The results predict that improvements in vehicle fuel economy on the order of a few percent can be made at low temperatures by use of low viscosity synthetic lubricants, but only small effects are projected for the CVS and EPA highway cycles. Insufficient data were obtained to quantify the contribution of friction modifiers to fuel economy. However, the data indicate under what viscosity values and input conditions friction modifiers will become effective and suggest areas for future evaluation. 770836. The Bayflex 110 Series - The New Generation of RIM Materials. W. A. Ludwico and R. P. Taylor, Mobay Chemical Corp. RIM polyurethane materials are rapidly gaining accep- tance for use as exterior automotive body components. As new applications arise, the automotive industry con- tinually looks for formulations with improved processing and physical properties. Reduced cycle times, better green strength at demold, good flowability in complex tools, earlier paintability, and reproducible shrinkage values will continue to be primary standards for processing im- provements. Reduced sensitivity to temperature changes, higher elongation coupled with greater stiffness, and physical property versatility using the same basic raw materials are the material improvements most in demand. A new improved RIM formulation approach is the Bayflex 110 series. This series of materials, which already spans the flexural modulus range from 10,000 psi. to 60,000 psi., is designated as Bayflex 110-10, Bayflex 1 10-25, etc. to denote the pertinent flexural modulus. This series has been well characterized with respect to prop- erties and processing parameters. What follows is a detailed description of these materials. 770837. The Properties of High Modulus RIM Urethanes. R. M. Gerkin and F. E. Critchfield, Union Carbide Corp. Reaction Injection Molding is rapidly becoming accepted as a viable industrial process for preparing large intricate parts using reactive urethane intermediates. High modulus polymers are among the newest systems capable of being prepared using the RIM process. Proper balance of the many features of urethane chemistry and technology allows preparation of high modulus material with excel- lent properties, including impact resistance. Fillers can be added to these high modulus polymers to increase their moduli even further. Studies have shown that milled fiberglass added to certain polymers can result in a composite with a flexural modulus in excess of 320M psi (2206MPa). 1977 SA E Transactions 770838. Extending the Temperature Range of RIM Materials. H. A. Silverwood and W. C. Salis- bury, Davidson Rubber Co., Inc., Div. of McCord Corp. The evolution of new generation flexible RIM urethane fascia formulations has resulted in improved performance over wider temperature ranges. The new formulations have exhibited resistance to fracture at -20Â°F(-29Â°C) in 180 degree mandrel bend tests, falling Dart impacts and pendulum impacts when painted with low extension polymer coatings. Firebird fascia produced from one of the improved formulations and painted with D-100 white topcoat finish have completed numerous series of nine pendulum impacts at -20Â°F(-29Â°C) without damage. This formulation is now in commercial production on Model Year 1978 bumper fascia. 770839. Factors Affecting the Quality of Impingement Mixed RIM Urethanes. R. E. Fruzzetti, J. M. Hogan, F. J. Murray and J. R. White, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. Reaction injection molding of poly urethanes has become an established means of producing highly configured exterior automotive parts. As such, precautions must be taken to assure that RIM urethanes are consistently well mixed. Mixing quality affects cosmetic appearance, physical properties, and performance in the field. The processing variables for six RIM systems are analyzed and quantified. A procedure to minimize machine set-up time and assure good mixing is given. Three areas are considered-metering, primary mixing in the mixing chamber, and secondary mixing in the static aftermixer. 1977 SA E Transactions 770840. The Development of a New Bumper System for the VW Dasher. U. Seiffert and C. Hildebrandt, Volkswagenwerk AG. The paper describes development and testing of a polyurethane bumper for the VW-Dasher. Requirements were established on the basis of the performance of the previous bumper design consisting of a steel profile bar and hydraulic energy absorbers. The development proved that polyurethane bumpers can be used as energy- absorbing elements for the 5 mph barrier impact. 770842. The Development and Processing of a Thermoset Rubber Fascia Substrate. M. C. Chen, J. L. Rees, R. E. Powell and A. F. Reilly, Sheller- Globe Corp. Sheller-Globe has developed a paintable thermoset elasto- meric substrate material designed for use in automotive fascia, sight shields, etc. Based on an SBR/EPDM blend the material has a flexural modulus of 138 MPa (20,000). Incorporation of fiberglass and filler modifications readily permit ad- justment of the flexural modulus. A processing study of M-1078 containing 4% fiberglass established that the material is readily moldable by either compression or injection methods. 119</page><page sequence="105">770843 - 770850 Optimum mold temperature ranges are 177Â° to 199Â°C (350-390Â° F) with stock injection temperatures running from 138Â° to as high as 150Â°C without scorch problems. Correlation between Mooney viscosity and scorch data and ease of injection molding was noted. 770843. Total System Concept for Manufacturing Injec- tion Molded Glass Reinforced Polyester Com- ponents. Anthony J. Carmen, Jr., Bailey Div., USM Corp. A unique method for manufacturing glass-fiber reinforced polyester automotive components has been developed by USM Corporation. This method referred to as the Total System Concept, is unique in that it makes total inte- gration of injection molding and continuous material mixing possible. The future growth of glass-fiber reinforced plastics will be influenced by equipment and material devel- opments which improve the performance and economics of end use applications. The Total System' offers a means of reaching this growth potential. The Total System' has been fully developed and tested, and is a functional approach to manufacturing injection molded, glass fiber reinforced polyester com- ponents at highly economic levels. 770844. Prediction of Dynamometer Power Absorption to Simulate Light Duty Truck Road Load. Glenn D. Thompson, United States Environmental Pro- tection Agency. When vehicle exhaust emission tests or vehicle fuel consumption measurements are performed on a chassis dynamometer, the dynamometer is usually adjusted to simulate the road experience of the vehicle. In this study, road load versus speed data were obtained from 15 light duty trucks. The road load of each truck was determined for different payloads, resulting in a total of approxi- mately 50 road load measurements. Dynamometer power absorption settings to simulate the measured road loads are computed. These dyna- mometer settings are regressed against vehicle frontal area and vehicle inertia weight. It is concluded that the dynamometer load settings are most accurately predicted on the basis of the vehicle frontal area. 1977 SA E Transactions 770846. Possible Advances in European Passenger Cars Fuel Economy. A. Ciccarone, Alfa Romeo Research Department (Italy). A study was carried out to identify and analyze the possible fuel economy improvements in the European passenger cars. A compliance with the today (1975) European exhaust emissions regulation and undiminished performance in comparison with the 1974 vehicles were the main constraints within the study was conducted. Hardware which can be in production by 1980-85 was considered. A statistical analysis on 68 European sedan cars was carried out to characterize the 1974 vehicles. Some possible improvements were identified. A reference vehicle was selected and a fuel consumption prediction technique suitable for computer calculation was de- veloped to evaluate fuel consumption and performance with and without incorporation of the possible improve- ments. Combinations of the individual improvements were chosen and applied to the reference vehicle; the corresponding fuel consumption gains were estimated. Within the constraints of the study 14 + 18% fuel consumption improvements were predicted for improved vehicles powered by improved gasoline engines or by high specific power gasoline engines. Only if poorer per- formance was accepted a 23 + 27% fuel consumption gain could be achieved by improved vehicles powered by a direct injection Stratified Charge Engine. 770847. An Investigation of Fuel Economy Potential of Four 1977-Model Vehicles. R. L. Bechtold and R. D. Fleming, Bartlesville Energy Research Center. A vehicle testing program was conducted to determine the inherent fuel economy potential of current (1977) tech- nology engines given freedom to optimize engine ad- justment for best fuel economy with no constraint on engine-out emissions. The average city/highway fuel economy of four car models with optimized air-fuel ratio and spark timing was improved by 4.1% as compared to the fuel economy of the baseline values found for the vehicles with air-fuel ratio and spark timing at manu- facturer's specifications. 770849. Utilization of Hydraulic Petroleum Fluids as Brake Fluids. Andre Vidal, TOTAL TECH- NIQUE, Compagnie FranÃ§aise de Raffinage. The performance of hydraulic petroleum fluids is com- pared to that of conventional synthetic fluids used in motor vehicle braking systems. Water tolerance tests were made with a laboratory apparatus to study the vapor lock properties. Different parameters which can affect "vapor lock" have been studied, such as: - influence of dissolved water, - influence of free water, - influence of the quality of seals used in the braking systems. 770850. Progress in Shock Absorber Oil Technology. A. Dalibert, ESSO S.A.F. (France). Shock absorber oils have to satisfy, jointly with the mechanical device of the shock absorber, a certain number of technical targets to ensure satisfactory behav- ior when in service on the car. This paper details the technical requirements for the oil with respect to the following properties: - damping diagram versus viscosity temperature dÃ©pendance, shear stability, biphasic flow; 120</page><page sequence="106">770851 -770857 - antiwear properties to avoid lateral seizure between piston and cylinder (critical in MacPherson-type suspen- sions); - oxidation stability; - low noise generation. The latter characteristic has been thoroughly evalu- ated to identify the sources of noise and the means to control them. This paper distinguishes between two main noise sources: low frequency noise from road seal friction which is easily controlled through the use of friction modifiers and high frequency noise due to a biphasic flow which is more difficult to control. The influence of the nature of the gas and of the oil structure (OSWALD Coefficient) on noise generation as well as the mechanical means to control this noise are discussed. 770851. Transversely Apportioned Brake System. D. Parsons and A. J. Young, Automotive Products Ltd. The system described proportions the brake force at each wheel according to the dynamic load on that wheel in a corner or manoeuvre. Brake pressure is modulated when the brakes are applied in a corner and also when a severe steering input is made whilst braking in a straight line. The paper discusses the need for such a system and presents an analysis of system performance on a typical passenger car. Changes to the oversteer/understeer char- acteristics of the vehicle are also analysed. The system is currently under development and has been fitted experimentally to three vehicles. Test results from one of these vehicles are presented. 1977 SA E Transactions 770852. Tire Shear Force Generation During Combined Steering and Braking Maneuvers. J. E. Bernard, L. Segel and R. E. Wild, Highway Safety Research Inst., The Univ: of Michigan. A historical overview of theory and experiment pertaining to tire shear force generation during combined slip is presented followed by a review of more recent empirical findings. The requirements for modeling the tire in combined maneuvers are summarized prior to presenting, in detail, a semi-empirical model of the tire developed to fulfill these requirements. The ability of the developed model to fit the shear force characteristics exhibited by belted, radial-ply tires and bias-ply tires is examined and demonstrated. 1977 SA E Transactions 770853. New Aspects on Spark Ignition. H. Albrecht, Research Div., Daimler-Benz AG (Germany); and W. H. Bloss, W. Herden, R. MaÅy, B. Saggau and E. Wagner, Institut fÃ¼r Physi- kalische Elektronik, UniversitÃ¤t Stuttgart (Ger- many). Fundamental investigations have been made on processes in common spark plugs useful for ignition of fuel- air-mixtures. Development of spark discharge from the early beginnings as well as the initiation of chemical reaction have been studied experimentally by using very high frequency measuring technique, radiation measure- ments, spectroscopic methods and interferometry by a nitrogen laser (~300 ps). The measurements have been carried out in non-reacting gases (N2, air) as well as in inflammable mixtures. A complete description will be given of the total process from the spark breakdown to the arc and glow-phase, resp., in the millisecondrange in- cluding temperature, local dimensions, energy distribution and radicals which can be formed. 770854. A Production Computerized Engine Timing Con- trol System. William P. Winstead, Delco Remy Division General Motors Corp. A digital electronic spark timing system has been developed and placed in production for use on the 1978 Oldsmobile Toronado. This system consists of an ignition distributor which contains a magnetic pickup and ignition module, a coolant temperature sensor and a controller package containing electronics and a pressure transducer. Engine RPM, manifold vacuum and coolant temperature inputs are used to derive and control the engine spark timing. The controller electronics design is based on a digital microprocessor, custom designed to perform engine control functions such as spark timing, exhaust gas recirculation, idle speed, etc. The system design criteria includes data storage and calculation capability, auto- motive sensor and actuator interface, flexibility and accuracy. 770855. Engine Control System with Ultrasonic Mass Air Flowmeter. R. Rinolfi, Fiat Research Center (Italy). As a solution to the problems generated by the conven- tional spark ignition engine, an electronic control system is being tested. This system must be capable of optimizing engine performance under varying operating and envi- ronmental conditions. Encouraging this type of solution were advances in electronic technology and the energy crisis. The system could acquire various engine parameters and control numerous engine variables. From a technical view, the electronic control system is not a problem. However, where sensors and actuators are concerned, much developmental work needs to be done. Determining a set of control laws is the most difficult, yet interesting problem encountered in order to realize an effective system. Contained in this paper, is an experimental system which evaluates the potential of this approach to the problem. 770857. KEVLARÂ® 49 Aramid Fibers for High Per- formance Composites. Louis H. Miner, Textile Fibers Dept., E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc. KEVLARÂ® is the registered trademark for one member of Du PonÅ¥s family of aromatic polyamide fibers which have 121</page><page sequence="107">770858 - 770863 been granted the generic name "aramid" by the Federal Trade Commission. It is available in three different types: KEVLARÂ® 49, with its high tensile strength (400,000 psi; 2760 MN/m2) and high modulus (18 million psi; 124,000 MN/m2) is designed for the reinforcement of plastics and offers industry a new level of composite performance. KEVLARÂ® 49 is also used in coated fabrics, ropes and cables. KEVLARÂ® 29, with the same high tensile strength and a modulus of 9 million psi (62,000 MN/m2), is especially well suited for a number of industrial appli- cations including ropes, cables, coated fabrics, and protective clothing. KEVLARÂ® has properties similar to those of KEVLARÂ® 29 and is designed for the rein- forcement of rubber, specifically tires, belts, and hose. This presentation, however, will concentrate on KEVLARÂ® 49 because of its unique combination of high strength, high modulus, and light weight, and because of its many demonstrated properties in reinforced plastics as a replacement for fiber glass. The short time since its commercial introduction in 1972 has not allowed extensive evaluation of KEVLARÂ® 49 and its composites for specific automotive applications. However, we believe that work in other end-uses reported here will provide valuable background information for future evaluations in the automobile industry. 770858. Future Requirements for Heat Resistant Elas- tomers for Underhood Automotive Applications. Mack Carter, Jr., Chrysler Corp. Underhood temperatures have risen in recent years to the extent that many elastomers traditionally used underhood do not satisfactorily meet performance requirements. Emission controls effective for 1980 model cars will significantly increase underhood temperatures over and above temperatures now experienced as Automotive Manufacturers modify the internal combustion engine and add new catalytic converters to comply with these requirements. Experimental laboratory data on conventional and heat resistant elastomers and performance test data on cars equipped with mandated emission controls are presented to show temperature trends in future auto- mobiles. The data show that conventional elastomers cannot withstand the increased temperatures projected for future vehicles with internal combustion engines. 770859. The Requirements for Heat Resistant Rubber in Japanese Cars. Hiroyuki Aoki, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan). Various countermeasures against exhaust emissions have caused rises in the temperatures of engine and underfloor parts. These parts need alterations with respect to construction and materials. This paper deals with concrete measures for the parts, more specifically for heat-resistant rubber parts, and with expectations for further devel- opment of heat-resistant rubber. 770860. Heat Resistant Elastomer Applications - Success and Failure. Bert C. Vandermar, Western Acadia Inc. The function of the elastomer technologist traditionally has been to match the capabilities of elastomers to customer needs in such a manner that a successful usage is made of the properties available. In order to accomplish this, the design engineer needs to be thoroughly familiar with the wide range of compounding variables possible with each elastomer as well as the complete requirements of the application. Thus through the optimum choice of elastomer, compounding ingredients and part design, a success story is achieved. Since all stories do not have "happy endings", the engineer should also have learned which elective parameters need improvement and thus in the future increase his probability of success. 770861. EPDM Rubber - What is Maximum Service Temperature? R. D. Allen and P. D. Hinckley, Uniroyal, Inc. What is the maximum service temperature of any rubber compound? Certainly the application environment de- termines the types of rubber, grades of rubber, and optimum compounding technology that can be used. The cost/performance relationship then determines the rubber compound that will be used in a given application. This paper concerns the uniqueness of EPDM rubbers in high heat automotive application. The most current technology to extend EPDM high heat life is featured. 770862. Comparison of NBR with Other Oil Resistant Rubbers for Automotive Applications. J. R. Dunn and H. A. Pfisterer, Polysar Ltd. (Canada). Notable improvements have been made recently in the high temperature performance of NBR vulcanizates and in the test methods used to predict the performance of these and other oil resistant elastomers. The good overall balance of properties achievable with current NBRs enables them to play a major role alongside more expensive oil resistant elastomers. More specifically the high temperature performance now available in NBR- based parts is already being exploited extensively and further applications are under test. High temperature performance using non-interfering stabilizers in NBR is comparable to that of "bound antioxidant" NBR in many practical compounds. 770863. Exploring the Potential of Bound Antioxidant Nitrile Rubber in Automotive Applications. James W. Horvath and Jerry L. Bush, The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. Increasing performance requirements have prompted numerous studies to improve the aging of NBR. The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company has developed a family of polymerization bound antioxidant stabilized CHEMIGUM rubbers which have superior heat, abra- sion, compression set resistance, and persistent non- volatile or extractable antioxidant protection. These polymers are being evaluated as alternatives to 122</page><page sequence="108">770864 - 770870 conventional NBR, ECO, PA, silicone and fluorocarbon polymers in applications such as power steering and transmission seals, fuel hose and compressor seals. More costly polymers have previously displaced conventional NBR in some of these applications. NBR warrants rÃ©Ã©valuation due to the current world energy situation where there is a need to apply new technology, and lowest cost polymer systems to their fullest potential. 1977 SAE Transactions 770864. Ethylene/ Acrylic Elastomer for Demanding Au- tomotive Applications. W. R. Abell, E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co., Inc., Elastomer Chemicals Department, Wilmington, Delaware. Ethylene/acryliC elastomer (E/A) is a relatively new polymer with more heat resistance than any other commercially available, moderately priced, oil, water and weather-resistant rubber. Typical parts made from E/A elastomer will meet SAE J-200 requirements at 175Â°C, corresponding to the previously unassigned Type "E" classification. Swelling in ASTM Oil #3, after 70 hours at 150Â°C, ranges from 80 to 35% (Class E to Class G) as a function of compounding. This paper discusses the unique combination of physical properties and resistance to deteriorating environmental factors which make ethyl- ene/acrylic elastomer especially well suited for demanding automotive applications. 770865. Polyether Elastomers for Heat Resistant Auto- motive Applications. Norman C. Mac Arthur, Hercules Inc. Epichlorohydrin elastomers were first introduced to the rubber industry in 1965. They were subsequently com- mercialized to bring to the industry the combination of high temperature stability and resistance to fuels, oils, and oxidation. Today these polymers are used in many automotive applications. This paper is offered to the automotive engineer as a description of these elastomers and as a reference source for the kinds of applications and specifications which they now serve. 770866. High Temperature Ignition Core Fabrication Using a Liquid Silicone Rubber. Gerald P. Kehrer and Carl M. Monroe, Dow Corning Corp. This paper describes a unique method of fabricating high performance silicone parts with liquid silicone rubber (LSR). Both molding and extrusion techniques will be introduced but emphasis will be on fabrication of automotive ignition core. Liquid silicone rubber offers several advances over current systems. It contains no solvent, is pumpable, and produces a core that is round and smooth, reducing the possibilities of stress point failure in cable construction. Good shelf life and a long working time are characteristic of the system along with rapid cure rates and excellent heat resistance. Data will be presented covering thermal life, electrical conductivity and typical physical properties. 770867. VITONÂ®: A High Performance Fluorocarbon Elastomer for Use in Hostile Environments. R. E. Knox and A. Nersasian, E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc., Elastomer Chemicals Department, Elastomers Laboratory, Chestnut Run Location, Wilmington, Delaware. Fluorine containing polymers have long been known for their outstanding resistance to hostile environments. Of the many types of fluoropolymers available, fluoro- hydrocarbon elastomers are playing an increasingly important role in industry. A description of the structural types available, along with their properties and per- formance in simulated and actual service in the presence of heat and aggressive fluids is presented. The heat and fluid resistance of fluorohydrocarbon polymers are com- pared with those of nitrile, silicone, and polyacrylate rubbers. Finally, comments will be offered relative to emerging technology and a prediction of future trends. 770868. From Perceptions of Vehicle Disturbance to Corrective Adjustments of Tires. S. A. Lippmann and K. L. Oblizajek, Uniroyal Tire Co. Disturbances transmitted to the occupants of vehicles often involve tires in their formation or transmission. Tire engineers attempting to reduce disturbances in specific vehicles have two courses of action; alter the tire design according to insight or whim until subjective testing indicates improvements; or analyze the chain of rela- tionships from sensory impression through the tire-vehicle system to internal tire design. This paper describes a "chain-of-relationships" pro- cedure using sensory comparison techniques for identi- fying pertinent physical stimuli, and an approach to system modeling that best identifies structural tire properties. 770869. The Effect of Pavement Grooves on the Ride of Passenger Cars - The Role of Tires. H. D. Tarpinian and E. H. Culp, Uniroyal Tire Co. A study of the role of tires in the ride-disturbance created in passenger cars by longitudinal grooves in highway pavements is presented. The coincidence of groove spacing in pavement and groove spacing in tires is shown to be of major importance. Tire construction and operating conditions are shown to be secondary. A methodical approach for evaluating tread patterns for potential disturbance is described. 1977 SAE Transactions 770870. The Effect of Tire Brake-In on Force and Moment Properties. K. Z. Marshall, R. L. Phelps, M. G. Pottinger and W. Pelz, B.F. Goodrich. 123</page><page sequence="109">770871 -770876 A tire break-in procedure has historically been used prior to tire force and moment testing for three reasons: to reduce variability, stabilize the data, and simulate service. For low slip angle force and moment data it is shown that the tire break-in does not achieve these objectives. Break-in is a result of viscoelastic changes and permanent deformation in the tire carcass materials, not a surface roughening or wear effect as has previously been assumed. It is recommended that no break-in be used in low slip angle force and moment testing. This action would eliminate the break-in variable and lead to reduced testing variability and more stable data. 1977 SA E Transactions 770871. The Potential for Improvement in Tire Response. G. R. Shearer, Tyre Technical Division, Dunlop, The Institution of Mechanical Engineers, 1977 Chairman of the Automobile Division, London, U.K. A review of early tire development and an examination of some historical concepts with the aim of identifying areas of potential improvement in response and efficiency. Although the forces in three planes are discussed, particular reference is made to the properties of comfort, load carrying capacity and stability. It is suggested that a more detailed mathematical approach could bring benefits by reducing the variation between theoretical and actual results. 770872. A Laboratory Technique for Evaluating Tire Tread Wear. I. Gusakov and L. Bogdan, Calspan Corp.; and D. J. Schuring, The Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. A laboratory technique has been developed for producing road-like tire tread wear and obtaining quantitative results. The tire is operated on a flat-roadway test machine and subjected to a schedule of applied lateral and longitudinal forces to promote wear. Wear measurements are made using sensitive, electro-mechanical wear sensors. Some typical test data are shown. Operational experiences are cited and recommendations for technique improve- ment are made. 770873. Standing Waves in Tires. James G. McGivern and Ivan A. Shirk, Mech. Engrg. Dept. Gonzaga Univ. This paper is an attempt to explain the standing wave phenomena existing in tires at high speeds in terms of tire pressure, tire speed and the tire's stiffness as expressed by its spring constant. The method boils down to reducing the problem to a resonant condition of a simple elastic system. To reduce the actual tire to an equivalent simple vibrating system, a section equal to the distance between the nodes, or one-half a wave length of the standing wave, is considered as an elastic system between supports. To further simplify, the uniformly distributed weight of this assumed section is replaced by a single equivalent weight from which the natural frequency of the tire section may be calculated. The resonance or standing wave condition occurs when this frequency equals the frequency with which the section of the tire passes the ground contact position. Simple static experiments were performed to deter- mine the spring constant of the tire (pounds to deflect tire one inch) and the constants used for obtaining the equivalent weights. The final results are represented on a chart where the frequency of the standing wave is plotted against the tire speed for two specific tires of known characteristics. The paper concerns itself with trying to explain standing wave phenomena rather than presenting a lot of data. 770874. Instrumentation Technique for Measuring Bead Stresses in Tires. A. Stiebel, Uniroyal Tire Co., Div. of Uniroyal, Inc. A method has been developed to measure strain in individual wire strands of bead bundles. The method was used to investigate stresses to which the bead wires are subjected during tire molding. Test results showed that during molding, the majority of strands are in compres- sion. Maximum compressive stresses encountered were 140 lbs. Applications of the method to other problems, such as bead stresses during mounting operations are discussed. 1977 SA E Transactions 770875. The Energy Loss of Tires on Twin Rolls, Drum, and Flat Roadway - A Uniform Approach. D. J. Schuring, The Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. A general concept of tire energy loss is suggested, in which tire and roadway are considered a system, and tire energy loss is identified as the difference between input and output energies. From this concept, a uniform set of loss equations is derived covering not only the three com- monly used test facilities, i.e., twin rolls, drum, and flat roadway, but also the major modes of tire operation including free-rolling, driving and braking. A few test results are discussed. 770876. Driver's Lateral Control Strategy as Affected by Task Demands and Driving Experience. G. J. Blaauw, J. Godthelp and J. Moraal, Institute for Perception TNO (The Netherlands). Driving behavior may be described as the result of a process during which performance is optimized to meet several task demands at the same time. In order to fulfill this task it is assumed that the driver has the disposal of a multivariate internal criterion that governs the rules for optimization. In the present study it was investigated how different task demands interact, particularly in combination with driving experience, the latter factor being indicative for driving skill development. The results showed that driving experience as a main experimental factor interacted 124</page><page sequence="110">770877 - 770882 significantly with task demands for lateral and longi- tudinal control. Besides, a controversy in the literature concerning differences in steering-wheel reversals between experienced and inexperienced drivers can be explained by this interaction. The results may be important for the discovery of characteristic performance patterns of experienced and inexperienced drivers and therefore for the development of driver education and training programs, amongst others. 1977 SAE Transactions 770877. Telemetry Applications in the Rotary Combustion Engine. Philip M. Leucht and Donald J. Mand- ley, General Motors Research Labs. This paper describes several applications of telemetry in making experimental measurements inside the rotary combustion engine. Short-range radio telemetry was used as the wireless data link from transducers on the moving rotor to the stationary housing of a firing engine. The procedures used to measure motion, temperature, and pressure in this difficult and hostile environment are described in detail. The problems encountered and the limitations of the measurement system are discussed in order to illustrate the application of this experimental method. 1977 SA E Transactions 770878. The Engineer's Manifesto. Rodger F. Ringham, 1976 SAE President. The world shortage of energy and materials resources poses a continuing challenge to engineers, particularly automotive engineers, to evolve designs which stretch critical materials usage and eventually replace these with more plentiful ones. To carry out their mission, engineers must educate government officials, business leaders and the public-at-large on a global basis to the necessary compromises; and engineers must share new knowledge in this area with their colleagues in all nations if mankind - in generations to come - is to enjoy a comfortable standard of living. 770879. Learning to Live with Expensive Energy. Rodger F. Ringham, 1976 SAE President. As fuel prices continue to increase in response to worldwide growth in demand for petroleum products, it is incumbent on the engineering community to communi- cate to its many publics, including governments, what the alternatives are and how to evaluate the trade-offs in such vehicle qualities as fuel economy, safety features, and environmental controls. Much can be realized in fuel savings from improved operational practices that need to be communicated to users who, hopefully, will respond to the economic incentive of increasing fuel cost. Growing acceptance of added-cost product options for fuel savings indicates a possible favorable trend, at least in those machines, such as trucks, which are bought and operated as capital goods. Improved products, using current technologies, are in development* The most important longer range devel- opments are in fuel efficient engines compatible with the expected broad range of characteristics of future fuels, such as the variety of potential synthetic heavy hydro- carbons. 770880. The Influence of Induction and Exhaust Pro- cesses on Emissions and Fuel Consumption in the Spark Ignited Engine. R. H. Sherman and P. N. Blumberg, Ford Motor Co. This paper describes an analysis of the induction and exhaust processes of the spark ignited engine. The analysis has been combined with an overall engine simulation to provide greater flexibility in studying the effects of induction/exhaust related parameters on engine emissions and fuel economy. Results are presented to illustrate the use of the engine model in predicting engine behavior in non-conventional configurations such as engine load control using an early intake valve closing technique. 1977 SAE Transactions 770881. Simulation of the Breathing Processes and Air- Fuel Distribution Characteristics of Three-Valve, Stratified Charge Engines. J. M. Novak, Ford Motor Co. This work describes a thermodynamic model of the exhaust and intake processes in small prechamber, three-valve, stratified charge engines. The main objective is to study the coupled effects of the prechamber orifice diameter, auxiliary-to-main chamber intake manifold pressure ratio, auxiliary valve timing, and engine speed on the air-fuel stratification between chambers at the time of ignition. The analysis highlights the important dimen- sionless parameters that control the engine breathing processes. In addition, the unique numerical problems of solving the governing differential equations are analyzed and discussed. Results of a parametric study indicate that the charging processes are very complex, in general. The degree of stratification at the time of ignition strongly depends on the ratio of intake manifold pressures and on the auxiliary intake valve timing, particularly for lower engine speeds (&lt;2000 RPM) and/or larger orifice diam- eters (&gt;0.3 inches). 770882. Statistical Analysis of Pressure Indicator Data of an Internal Combustion Engine. Shougo Sanda, Tadahide Toda, Hidetaka Nohira and Toshiaki Konomi, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. A statistical indicator data analyzer has been developed, which is able to analyze various combustion character- istics such as rate of pressure increase, heat release rate, etc., from indicator data of four hundred (400) combus- tion cycles of each cylinder of a multicylinder engine. Statistical analyses on cycle-by-cycle variation of indicated mean effective pressure (imep) were made under various combinations of fuel systems and combustion 125</page><page sequence="111">770883 - 770895 chamber configurations to clarify those effects. The contribution of characteristics on the variation of imep was made clear to some extent. 770883. Structural Analysis Using Cast Scale Models. Terence J. Clancy, William A. Elliott and Donald E. Malen, General Motors Corp. A method for structural analysis using cast plastic scale models is presented. The method was used to predict the dynamic structural response of a vehicle powertrain using one-half scale cast polyurethane models of the engine block and transmission case. The results of the model test program allowed the design to be modified to meet structural objectives before tooling commitments were made. 1977 SA E Transactions 770884. A Simplified Method for the Identification of Vehicle Suspension Parameters. Donald M. Brueck, Iowa State Univ.; and E. Dawson Ward, Purdue Univ. To simulate vehicle dynamic performance, accurate parameters must be available to relate the vehicle differential equation model to the actual vehicle. This paper presents a simplified method to identify vehicle suspension spring rates, damping characteristics, and unsprung mass inertia properties. The method presented employs a digital computer algorithm to implement an equation error identification technique. A sequence of four laboratory tests was developed to obtain suspension input and response data required in the equation error technique. Each test is of a short duration (less than three seconds) and does not require vehicle disassembly. To verify the technique a test stand employing an electro- hydraulic position servosystem was constructed and the test sequence was applied to the rear suspension of a 1972 Pontiac Catalina. When the identified parameters were used to simulate the response of the vehicle suspension to the test input, agreement to within 13 percent of the actual maximum measured response resulted. The results pre- sented in this paper show the potential of the technique to be an accurate, simplified method of obtaining vehicle suspension parameters. 770890. Maximization of Highway Freight Movement Using a New Tractor Trailer Concept. R. L. Zubko, Strick Corp. A new highway freight transporting vehicle has been developed which maximizes the available payload space within existing regulatory limitations. The vehicle is a combination of a low profiled driver forward mid-engined tractor coupled to a freight box, and pulling a semi-trailer. The application of existing components in the revised configuration will be discussed to clarify the design approach features and performance. 770892. The Truck Stabilizer, A Means of Preventing Roll-Over During Braking and Handling Test Situations. R. R. Modlin, Dodge Truck Engi- neering, Chrysler Corporation; and J. W. Doug- las, Brake Engineering, Chrysler Corporation. With the advent of increased Government demands to upgrade truck brake standards, there is hardly a proving ground in the country which has not experienced either a truck rollover or a near accident resulting from the required brake performance tests. From the standpoint of driver safety, the usual approach has been to install rollover bars so should an accident occur, the driver has an improved chance of survival. This paper describes an alternative in which a stabilizer is secured behind the test vehicle and is triggered by the truck yawing more than a preset amount. On being triggered the stabilizer acts automatically to correct the potentially dangerous yaw and bring the truck back to the straight ahead condition. 770893. Exhaust System Considerations for 1982 Heavy Duty Trucks. Douglas W. Rowley, Donaldson Company, Inc. The paper describes the exhaust system hardware that will be required for 1982 trucks to meet the 80 dB A Federal noise regulations. First, a summary is presented of market trends and legislative limitations influencing future truck exhaust systems. From these limitations, exhaust system per- formance standards, well into the next decade, are projected. Then with that foundation, it is predicted what actual exhaust system hardware for 1982 might "look like," along with a review of the obstacles that must be overcome to attain the exceptional level of exhaust system performance that will be required. The benefits of distributed systems in controlling exhaust noise and backpressure are described, plus information is presented on the effect of backpressure on fuel economy. 1977 SA E Transactions 770894. Transmission of Exhaust Noise Through Pipe Walls. A. Clifford Corbett and Peter S. Cheng, Stemco Mfg. Co., Inc. Measurements are reported on sound transmitted through the walls of commonly used exhaust pipes under the actual running condition of a diesel engine. The sound levels and the spectral composition of transmitted sound are presented. Parameters such as type of joints, curvature of bend are investigated. Results of measurements are compared with those of previously conducted experiments using a loudspeaker as the sound source. 770895. Techniques and Problems of Truck Exhaust System Noise Measurement. D. A. Olson, K. D. Nordlie and E. J. Seils, Nelson Industries, Inc. Techniques and problems associated with truck exhaust system noise measurement are discussed and typical results presented.

Axial Stresses Due to Torsion in Truck Frame Rails. R. E. Alliston, Kenworth Truck Co.; and R. E. Sherrer, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Univ. of Washington. Equations are summarized to calculate deflections and axial stresses due to torsion in channel sections used for truck frame rails. Symmetric channel sections are treated first and calculations are made for a specific case. These results are compared with strain gage data from tests conducted by Lewis F. McNitt. Computer modeling of truck frame rails is discussed and results are presented and compared with the McNitt test frame. The special case of unsymmetric channel sections is also discussed and results are presented from a computer model of a truck frame. 1977 SA E Transactions 770897. High Strength Steel Siderails - A Comparative Evaluation. G. L. Satava, Midland Steel Prod- ucts Co., J. F. Martin, Michigan State Univ.; and E. G. Hamburg, Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp. A comparative evaluation is presented of the performance of two types of materials with different yield strengths both of which currently are used in heavy duty truck frames. These two materials are an as-rolled 80 ksi yield strength low alloy steel (VAN-80) and a 110 ksi yield strength low carbon, intermediate manganese, quenched and tempered steel. The evaluation consists of a full size siderail fatigue life evaluation, fatigue performance of smooth and notched specimens tested in load control, fracture tough- ness data and fatigue crack propagation rates down to -60Â° F for each material, and an analytical treatment to establish the critical event that leads to failure in a structure at low temperature. As truck frame siderails must provide reliable per- formance over a prolonged service life, they must demonstrate a high resistance to fatigue. A discussion of the conventional R.B.M. rating of a frame siderail related to its fatigue performance based upon the results of the fatigue evaluation is presented. The use of "as-rolled" high strength material yielding equivalent in-service performance to a quenched and tempered product offers significant benefits to both user and manufacturer. This product is both cost effective and energy effective in that the additional processing through conventional heat treatment systems is eliminated. 1977 SA E Transactions 770898. Preliminary Evaluation of Fiber Composite Re- inforcement of Truck Frame Rails. James R. Faddoul, National Aeronautics and Space Ad- ministration, Lewis Research Center. An experimental program was conducted to determine if a graphite fiber/resin matrix composite could be used to effectively reinforce a standard steel truck frame rail. A preliminary design demonstrated that the reinforcement weight could be reduced by a factor of 10 when compared to a steel reinforcement. A 1/3 scale rail section was fabricated to demonstrate low cost manufacturing tech- niques. The scale rail section was then tested and increased stiffness was confirmed. No evidence of com- posite fatigue was found after 500,000 cycles. The specimen failed in bending at a load 50% greater than that predicted for a nonreinforced rail. 1977 SA E Transactions 770915. (P-73) Study of Human Impact Tolerance Using Investigations and Simulations of Free-Fails. David R. Foust, Bruce M. Bowan and Richard G. Snyder, Highway Safety Research Institute, The University of Michigan. A study of free-fall accidents and resulting injuries was conducted to determine how useful these types of data could be in establishing human injury tolerance limits. "Tolerance" was examined primarily for children and at two levels-reversible injury and threat to survival. The specific objectives were to investigate specific free-falls in sufficient depth to permit biomedical or mathematical reconstruction of the fall, simulate selected free-falls to estimate impact response, and compare predicted re- sponses with observed injuries as a means of estimating human tolerance levels. From more than 2100 reported free-falls, 110 were investigated on-site. Seven head-first and three feet-first falls were then simulated using the MVMA 2-D Crash Victim Simulator. Newspaper reports of free-falls showed that males fell six times as often as females and most often while at work. Children fell from windows and balconies more often than from any other hazard. Case investigations showed that children were generally injured less severely than adults under similar fall circumstances, and tended to land on their heads a greater proportion of the time. The investigations also indicated that for impacts onto rigid surfaces: both children and adults may be expected to suffer skull fractures in head-first falls of greater than ten feet; adults are likely to incur lumbar spine fracture if they land in a sitting position after falling 10 feet; and adults will probably sustain pelvic fracture in feet-first falls of more than 30 feet. The head-first fall simulations predicted skull acceleration responses that were higher than previously considered survivable, although five of the six child subjects whose falls were simulated did survive. Analysis of simulation results indicated that, for some children under 8 years old, peak accelerations of as high as 350 G, with a rate of onset of up to 200,000 G/sec and a duration of up to 3 msec (approximate HIC = 1700-2800), would produce only moderate, reversible injury (as defined by AIS 2). For this same age group, the survival limit for head impacts-the level at which most people would sustain AIS 5 or greater injuries-was estimated to be as 127</page><page sequence="113">770916-770919 high as 600 G peak acceleration and 300,000 G/sec for a duration of up to 3 msec (approximate HIC = up to 11,000). 1977 SA E Transactions 770916. (P-73) Adverse Effects of Seat Belts and Causes of Belt Failures in Severe Car Accidents in Switzerland During 1976. P. Niederer, Institute for Biomedical Engineering, Swiss Federal In- stitute of Technology and University of Zurich; F. Walz and U. Zollinger, Institute for Forensic Medicine, University of Zurich. Results of a one year field study initiated by the Swiss Federal Police Department in connection with a man- datory seat belt law effective January 1, 1976 are presented. 304 accidents with 153 killed and 257 severely injured (OAIS ^ 2) belted occupants were analysed during this program. As belt effectiveness has previously been demonstrated in field investigations the following specific problems are discussed: - Frequency and statistical significance of cases in which, with a high degree of probability, the belt had an adverse effect - Relevant injury patterns - Frequency and causes of belt failures including releasing difficulties after a crash - Possible improvements. Furthermore, the applicability of Calspan's SMAC method is demonstrated and discussed. In case of car to car collisions the mass ratio is shown to be of importance. A correlation analysis between the velocity change during the collision phase (Av) and the injury severity is performed. Special attention is given to frontal crashes with no or minimal passenger compartment intrusion. Severe injuries in such cases can usually be attributed to one or more of the following reasons: submarining, excessive slack, inadequate mechanical compatibility between belt system compliance and mechanical prop- erties of the chest (e.g., old age), overloading due to backseat passenger. 770917. (P-73) Belted or Not Belted: The Only Differ- ence Between Two Matched Samples of 200 Car Occupants. F. Hartemann, C. Thomas, C. Henry, J-Y. Foret-Bruno, G. Faverjon and C. Tarriere, Laboratory of Physiology and Bio- mechanics, Peugeot-Renault Association (France); C. Got and A. Patel, Institute of Orthopaedical Research, Raymond Poincare Hospital (France). This study aims at determining, with the maximum precision, the performance of the 3 point safety belt in different accident configurations, and more particularly in frontal collisions. For this purpose, two matched samples were taken from a file of 3,000 accidents, analysed by a multi- disciplinary study group. These samples of 100 front seat occupants wearing seat belts, and 100 not wearing seat belts were made up in such a manner that, for every belted occupant, corresponds an occupant not wearing a belt, the one and the other being in equivalent circumstances, using the following factors: - Make and type of the vehicle - Seat occupied - Age (as far as possible) - Direction of impact - Violence of the impact (same class of AV and mean i) - Possible intrusion of passenger compartment - Possible overload caused by a rear seat occupant Using this method of comparison, one can appreciate the effectiveness of the 3 point belt and explain the variations of effectiveness that appear in normal case studies. 1977 SA E Transactions 770918. (P-73) Accident and Injury Characteristics in Side-Collisions and Protection Criteria in Respect of Belted Occupants. J. Maximilian Danner, Allianz-Versicherungs - AG (Ger- many). In recent years recognition has been made of the important problem of car side collisions and some basic works concerning accident and injury characteristics have been published. In spite of this the relation between car damage and resulting injuries is not yet known to complete satis- faction. The injury criteria of belted occupants in particular, have until now only been known side collisions from individual cases. In this report the importance of side impacts is shown. The methodology of H UK-accident characteristics is presented. The accident characteristics as to impact area and intension type are analysed and related to the resultant occupant injuries on the basis of side collisions involving 1.811 passenger cars with 3.064 unbelted occupants. Furthermore the significance of side collision involving passenger cars with other cars, trucks and objects and their proportion to all side collisions with serious/fatal injuries is indicated, showing priorities of safety requirements. The injury criteria of belted occupants were inves- tigated on the basis of 163 collisions with car side damage involving 238 belted drivers and front seat passengers. The injuries of the belted occupants are discussed and the trends compared with injuries to unbelted occupants. Typical lesions to the different body areas and the influence the belt has on injuries to impact/opposite side passengers are indicated. Safety criteria concerning the structure and car interior characteristics and belt effectiveness in side impacts are discussed. 770919.

Corbelli, Centre Hospitalier Salon-de- Provence (France); and C. Cavallero, Laboratoire des Chocs et de BiomÃ©canique Organisme National de SÃ©curitÃ© RoutiÃ¨re (ON SER) (France). The present report results from the study of 278 computer selected among 350 in-the-field frontal crashes investi- gated by a bidisciplinary team. The study has 2 aspects: I .

(P-73) Collision Characteristics and Injuries to Motorcyclists and Moped Drivers. Klaus Lang- wieder, Dept. of Automotive Engineering, As- sociation of German Automobile Insurers (HUK- Verband) (Germany). In recent years, the number of accidents involving motorized two-wheelers has steadily increased. Never- theless, so far few studies exist describing the collision characteristics and injuries to the drivers of motorized two-wheelers. On the basis of 1,206 accidents, the collision char- acteristics and the injury risks to motorcyclists and moped drivers have been examined. Epidemiologic features of vehicle registration and accident involvement related to motorcycle categories are indicated. The risk exposure of motorcycles and mopeds compared with cars is discussed. The overall injury severity and injuries to the different body areas are indicated for both motorcyclists and moped drivers. The risk to driver and passenger is compared. A new system has been developed to describe the collision characteristics from the kinematic aspects. The crash situation is indicated by "Collision Types", the movements in pre-crash, crash and post crash phases are described by the "Trajectory Classification". The* frequency of collision types and the resulting injury severity is pointed out, which leads to possible safety measures being introduced on motorcycles/mopeds and on cars/trucks. The "Trajectory Classification", which shows the frequency of typical movements in accidents involving motorcycles or mopeds is discussed, mainly in respect of the resulting injuries. A proposal for a safety conception for motorcycles and mopeds is made. The use of safety helmets for both motorcyclists and moped drivers is postulated. 770921. (P-73) Head Impact Response. R. L. Stalnaker, J. W. Melvin, G. S. Nusholtz, N. M. Alem and J. B. Benson, Biomechanics Dept., Highway Safety Research Institute, The University of Michigan. A series of head impacts were conducted with fifteen unembalmed cadavers. The purpose of the tests was to study the application of three-dimensional motion anal- ysis using accelerometry, brain vascular system pressuri- zation and high speed cineradiography to the under- standing of head injury mechanics. The implementation of the techniques is described and their effectiveness is discussed. The three-dimensional accelerometry technique using nine accelerometers was found to be applicable in direct head impacts. Analysis of the head acceleration data indicates the existence of brain motions which are relative to the motion of the skull. These motions were confirmed by the high speed cineradiography films. Brain vascular system pressurization and time after death were found to play a role in determining the extent of the brain motions and the resulting brain injuries. 1977 SA E Transactions 779922. (P-73) Intracranial Pressure Dynamics During Head Impact. Alan M. Nahum and Randall Smith, Department of Surgery, University of California, San Diego; and Carley C. Ward, Civil Engineering Lab., Naval Construction Battalion Center, CA. Two series of cadaver head impact experiments are presented. Series I consists of individual experiments and Series II multiple sequential impacts on a single specimen. Measured intracranial pressures were correlated with other impact parameters. The use of a linear finite element model is also presented. 779923. (P-73) Prediction of Brain Injury Measures from Head Motion Parameters. Anthony N. Muc- ciardi and John D. Sanders, Adaptronics, Inc.; and Rolf H. Eppinger, National Highway Traf- fic Safety Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation. An analysis of experimental head impact data was performed to demonstrate (1) that kinematic waveforms contain information relating to head and brain injuries, and (2) that analysis techniques exist which can properly exploit this information to create injury predictive functions. An experimental data base consisting of 26 monkey head impacts was utilized. Translational and rotational acceleration time histories of the head were available. Parameters computed from these kinematic waveforms were the input variables to an analysis technique. The output, or modeled, variable was the experimentalist's evaluation of the severity of injuries. The results of the analysis are presented and it is concluded that it is possible to accurately model head and 129</page><page sequence="115">770924 - 770928 brain injury assessments from strictly head motion parameters. Subsequent analysis of the derived predictive functions reveals interesting insight into the relationship between the kinematic parameters and head injury and suggests potential strategies for head injury mitigation. 1977 SA E Transactions 770924. (P-73) Dynamic Characteristics of Human Leg Joints. Stephen L. Gordon, Philip N. Orticke and James Prince, Safety Research Lab., Na- tional Highway Traffic Safety Administration; and Robert R. McMeekin, Aerospace Pathology Div., Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. In a typical car crash the occupant's feet are braced and the body inertia forces the torso toward the feet. In the current study the test apparatus utilized a fixed torso, but the toeboard moved rapidly toward the test subject to simulate leg flexure. A detailed two-dimensional force measuring system permitted computation of forces and torques at the leg joints. Static and dynamic values of force and torque are presented as a function of the joint angle. The results are generally uniform with many of the curves assuming a parabolic shape. Peak dynamic values were twice the level of the static counterparts. 770925. (P-73) Considerations for a Femur Injury Cri- terion. David C. Viano, Biomedical Science Dept., General Motors Research Labs. A femur fracture injury criterion is presented that assesses the dependence of the permissible human knee load on the duration of the primary force exposure. Currently a constant allowable femur load limit of 7.6 kN (1700 lb) is specified in FMVSS 208, but recently the Federal Government proposed elevating the allowable limit to 10.0 kN (2250 lb), which is in excess of the limited experimental average static femur fracture force of 8Ã£90 kN (2000 lb). A general analysis of all of the available biomechanics data and mathematical models on femoral impact response and fracture indicates a significant load time dependence for primary pulse durations below 20 ms that can elevate the permissible femur load above the Federally proposed allowable limit of 10.0 kN (2250 lb). A femur injury criterion was therefore formulated that is consistent with the available experimental data, incor- porates the temporal characteristics of the femur fracture force and provides a technically feasible and improved protective test standard for car occupant safety evalu- ations. Dynamic differences between the femoral response of the human cadaver and the Part 572 dummy were subsequently quantified to substantiate the efficacy of applying the Femur Injury Criterion to the measured response of the Part 572 dummy. 1 977 SA E Transactions 710926. (P-73) Stereoradiographic Measurements for Anatomically Mounted Instruments. E. Becker, Naval Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory Detachment. A stereoradiographic technique is described in which two simultaneous x-ray exposures of an instrumented subject are prepared and analysed, yielding a complete six- parameter statement of the position and orientation of the instrument package relative to a coordinate system fixed in the subject's bony anatomy. A description of the radiologic equipment is included as well as details of those devices developed especially for stereoradiographic ex- posure and system calibration. The analytical aspects of the technique are discussed in qualitative terms in the body of the paper leaving more rigorous treatments to appendices. A statement of the inherent errors of this technique is also included. 770927. (P-73) Measurement of Head, Tv and Pelvic Response to -Gx Impact Acceleration. C. L. Ewing, D. J. Thomas, P. L. Majewski, R. Black and L. Lustik, Naval Aerospace Medical Re- search Laboratory Detachment, LA. The systematic measurement of the inertial response of human subjects to impact acceleration has been underway for several years. The response of the head and first thoracic vertebra (T^ has been reported for a variety of sled acceleration profiles. In order to better describe the inertial response of man, it is necessary to measure the pelvic response in addition to the response of the head and T,. A pelvic anatomical mount has been constructed and used on one volunteer undergoing successively higher levels of -Gx impact acceleration. The description of the use of the mount is given. The data for four runs in a maximum rate of onset and maximum duration config- uration from 2 through 7 G peak acceleration, using the twelve-inch HyGeÂ® accelerator are reported. Data from this subject for -Gx impact acceleration experiments have been previously reported and are compared to data from the experiments with the pelvic mount. The propagation of the acceleration profile from pelvis to Tl to the head will be described. The use of these data for description of the complete dynamic response of man will be discussed. 1977 SA E Transactions 770928.

Majewski, Naval Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory De- tachment, LA. A series of human volunteer experiments has been conducted to measure the inertial response of the head and the first thoracic vertebra (T,) to + Gy whole body impact acceleration; that is, acceleration applied to the subject from right to left. The 12-inch HYGEÂ® accel- erator, instrumentation system and procedures were identical to those used for measuring the response to -Gx impact acceleration, previously reported. 130</page><page sequence="116">770929 - 770932 Three categories of sled acceleration profile were used: high onset, long duration from 2G to 7.5G with end stroke sled velocity limit of 6.5 meters/sec; low onset, long duration with the same peak acceleration and velocity limits; and high onset, short duration from 5G to 11G. Comparison time profiles of angular acceleration, angular velocity and linear resultant acceleration at the head anatomical origin and horizontal linear acceleration at the Tj origin are presented at selected peak sled acceleration levels for 5 subjects of various anthropometric dimen- sions. Statistical and analytical modeling efforts from this data base are compared with similar efforts for previously reported -Gx experiments. 770929. (P-73) Response of Belted Dummy and Cadaver to Rear Impact. Anthony S. Hu, Stewart P. Bean and Roger M. Zimmerman, Physical Science Lab., New Mexico State University, NM. Sled impact tests were conducted to simulate the motion of a standard size car at rest impacted from the rear by a second car of equal weight traveling at 32 mph. The test subjects were anthropomorphic dummies and unem- balmed cadavers. They were seated in a bench seat (headrest in its lowest position) and were three-point belted. In one test mode the seatback was held rigid and in a second test mode the seatback rotated rearward in response to the test subject's impact loading. The major kinematic difference, in either test mode, between the dummies and cadavers was that the dummy head oscillated while the cadaver's head did not. Autopsies indicated that all three cadavers tested with a deflecting seatback suffered neck injuries reaching AIS 3 scale while two of three cadavers suffered similar injuries with a rigid seatback. The third cadaver tested with a rigid seatback had no injury. 770930. (P-73) Comparative Thoracic Impact Response of Living and Sacrificed Porcine Siblings. David C. Viano and Charles K. Kroell, Biomedical Sci- ence Dept., General Motors Research Labs.; and Charles Y. Warner, Mechanical Engineering Dept., Brigham Young University, UT. Thoracic impact response and injuries of living and postmortem porcine siblings were investigated to quantify comparative differences. Thirteen male animals, averaging 61.4 kg, from five different porcine litters comprised the two animal samples. Porcine brothers were subjected to similar impact exposures for which at least one brother was tested live, anesthetized and another dead, post rigor with vascular repressurization. Statistically significant differences in biomechanical responses and injuries were observed between live and postmortem siblings. On the average the anesthetized live animals demonstrated a greater thoracic compliance, as measured by increased normalized total deflections (21% Hi), and reduced overall injuries (AIS 14% Lo and rib fractures 26% Lo) at lower peak force levels (13% Lo) than did the postmortem subjects. However, individual com- parisons of "match-tested" siblings demonstrated very similar responses in some cases. The living animals developed myocardial conductive system dysfunctions encompassing arrythmias, blocks and ventricular fibril- lation which were poorly correlated to gross autopsy findings of heart trauma and the overall AIS. Arterial overpressures were substantially higher (three times) in the postmortem animals indicating that the experimental protocol produced an unrealistic arterial system impact response. A procedure is suggested which uses the live versus postmortem animal response and injury data to revise an existing injury versus normalized deflection relationship based upon human cadaver data. 770931. (P-73) Biomechanical Experiments with Animals on Abdominal Tolerance Levels. E. GÃ¶gler and A. Best, Accident Research Surgical University Hospital, Heidelberg; and H.-H. Braess, H.-E. Burst and G. Laschet, Research and Devel- opment Center Porsche (Germany). In order to improve the active safety and the aerodynamic drag a special rear end configuration was developed for the Porsche 911. Typical sequences of movements were determined during impact tests in the course of which dummies were hit by various rear end variants. It was stated that some pedestrians and cyclists incurred direct abdominal impacts. To find out whether under real traffic situations and in a speed range of 16 through 24 km/h this type of collision results in intraabdominal injuries, 12 corresponding test series with GÃ¶ttingen minipigs were carried through in the course of which the test animals were projected against various rear end variants. Meas- urements were made to determine the forces and accel- erations acting on the respective rear end. The accel- eration to which the animal was subjected was measured by means of an acceleration sensor sutured to the test subject's back. In addition the point of impact on the animal's body was determined. Immediately following the test, the animals were dissected and the interior organs microscopically examined. When impacting against a flexible rear end structure of a mass of 8.5 kg the limit between AIS grades 3 and 4 is located at approximately 1471.5 N for a duration of up to 5 ms. Under the given test conditions the tolerance limit between a subacute and an acute shock is at approximately 98 1 N for a duration of up to 20 ms. When hitting against non-flexible structures, the abdominal region incurred particularly severe injuries, which in two cases were only insufficiently recorded due to the monoaxial force measurement. With certain restrictions, the results obtained may be applied to an 8 to 12 year old child. 770932.

Ghista, Biomedical Engineering Div., Ames Research Center, NASA, CA. High amplitude vibrations, in the 0.5-11 Hz frequency range, are found to be harmful to tractor drivers. This paper deals with the analysis of vertical and pitch vibrations of the tractor - human occupant system. Our specific purpose is to determine the parameters and effectiveness of &gt; standard type suspension systems (pro- vided to (i) both seat and front axle, (ii) seat only) so that the response of the human body parts to vibration are minimized. It is found that the standard type suspension provided to the seat alone is better than the other type and effective in reducing vertical and pitch vibration levels by 60% and 85% respectively, thus improving ride comfort to a considerable extent. 1977 SA E Transactions 770933. (P-73) Necessities and Possibilities of Improving the Protective Effect of Three-Point Seat Belts. Heinrich Hontschik, Egbert MÃ¼ller and Gert RÃ¼ter, Battelle-Institut e.V., (Germany). In the first phase of a research program covering more than 100 catapult-simulated frontal collisions at an impact speed of 50 km/h, the necessary improvements on safety belts were systematically ascertained: The belt geometry must be adaptable to different body sizes and seating positions by adequate positioning of the seat belt an- chorage points. The efficiency of the safety belt has to be improved by reducing the response time, i.e. the belt slack, on the one hand, and by adjusting its energy absorption to the survival space, the kinetic energy of the occupant and his threshold level on the other. Now the second phase of work is covering an investigation of the following possibilities of improving the protective effect of the safety belt: Integrated seat-belt system Pyrotechnic pre-load device Hydraulic load-limiting elements The first experimental results have shown that these specific improvements can lead to a marked increase and thus to an optimization of the protective effect of safety belts. The investigations have also shown that optimum belt design can be achieved not only for persons of average size and weight, but also for persons of partic- ularly small size and low weight as well as for tall and heavy persons. 770934.

Development of an aspirator air bag has been completed at Calspan Corporation. The aspirator air bag has been developed through computer simulations and sled tests, and has been evaluated in a 41.6 MPH crash of a standard Volvo into a flat barrier. This evaluation included both out-of-position and normally seated occupants. This paper describes the aspirator system and presents results of the sled tests and the car crash.

Seiffert, Research and Devel- opment, Volkswagenwerk AG (Germany). This paper describes results of the field accident per- formance of the VW Passive Restraint System (VWRA) installed in Rabbit vehicles operating on U.S. highways. The historical development of the VWRA as an outgrowth of VW's research and development programs is detailed for perspective. To act as a baseline, dynamic sled and full-scale barrier crash testing with instrumented surro- gates using the VWRA are presented. The primary portion of the paper deals with collected and calculated data from VW's field investigations which have been in progress over the last two years. Parameters measured and presented are vehicle repair costs, VDI, Delta V, OIS/AIS, occupant contact points, and some collision data involving NHTSA-supplied crash recorders. Specific areas of inter- est are explored - such as, frequency /severity of injury to knee-femur-complex, the head and the thorax. 770936. (P-73) Evaluation Methods for the Bio- mechanical Quality of Restraint Systems During Frontal Impact. Dieter Adomeit, Institute of Automotive Engineering, Technische Universi- tÃ¤t Berlin (Germany). From a biomechanical point of view, test criteria in current safety standards for passenger protection do not insure a sufficient over-all protection of quality. First, the deficiencies of data and criteria, responsible for biomechanical problems, are being analysed. Sec- ondly, additional criteria are being defined, which we think are significant for a better over-all evaluation of restraint devices considering biomechanical facts. As a result of a dummy-crash-series, an analysis is presented, demonstrating correlations between the new defined and former criteria. The final aim is to develop a complete system of criteria. By the use of simple evaluation methods it would guarantee clear results concerning biomechanical prop- erties of passenger protection systems. With this technique one can have correct biomechanical evaluations of restraint systems, gained from dynamic tests even with anthropometric dummies. 1977 SA E Transactions 770937. (P-73) Geometric, Inertia), and Joint Charac- teristics of Two Part 572 Dummies for Occupant 132</page><page sequence="118">770938 - 770940 Modeling. Robert P. Hubbard and Donald G. McLeod, Biomedical Science Dept., General Motors Research Labs., GM Technical Center. The geometric, inertial, and joint characteristics of two Part 572 crash test dummies were measured to provide input to the MVMA 2-D occupant model. Segments of the dummies were defined which correspond to the links of the model and coordinate axes were defined for each segment. The center of gravity of each segment was located and its coordinates were measured along with the locations of joint centers, instrument mounts, and other significant geometric features. The mass moment of inertia for each segment about a lateral axis through its center of gravity was measured. The geometric and inertial measurements are presented on summary sheets for each segment with the hardware definition, coordinate system, and special notes for that particular segment. These summary sheets present the data in a format that is readily usable for defining computer model input. The resistance to motion of the elbows, shoulders, hips, and knees of the two dummies was measured and interpreted for input to the MVMA 2-D model. 1977 SAE Transactions 770938. (P-73) Hybrid III- A Biomechanically-Based Crash Test Dummy. J. King Foster, James O. Kortge and Michael J. Wolanin, Safety Re- search and Development Lab., Environmental Activities Staff, General Motors Corp. This paper describes a new generation anthropomorphic dummy with component dynamic responses which ap- proximate available biomechanics data. This experimental test dummy, Hybrid III, is based on the ATD 502 dummy which was developed in 1973 by General Motors under contract with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Like the ATD 502,. Hybrid III features a biomechanically-based head design, human-like automo- tive seating posture, constant torque primary joints, and detailed documentation for fabrication. Hybrid III uni- quely features a biomechanically-based neck, thorax, and knee covering. Transducers for measurement of neck loads and chest deflection are integral parts of the design. While Hybrid III appears to provide a measurable improvement over the present "standard" dummy (Part 572) in terms of component responses in frontal impacts, it is still far from the "ultimate" test dummy. Hybrid III does not, for example, provide substantial biofidelity improvements for lateral impacts. This and other desirable improvements must await additional biomechanics data. This paper describes the design and presents test results for three prototype dummies. Dynamic responses, relative to human cadaver and limited volunteer data, are presented for head, neck, thorax, and knee components. Performance of the Part 572 dummy is also presented for comparison. An evaluation of whole dummy repeatability and reproducibility during Hyge sled tests is described. Hybrid III and Part 572 dummy performances are compared. Additional work, which would be required to more fully evaluate Hybrid III, is outlined. This paper concludes that Hybrid III component responses are significantly closer to biomechanics data than those of the Part 572 dummy. The three prototypes are as repeatable as the Part 572 dummy and significantly more reproducible. 1977 SAE Transactions 770939. (P-73) Response Comparisons of the Human Cadaver Knee and a Part 572 Dummy Knee to Impacts by Crushable Materials. William E. Hering, Biomedical Science Dept., General Motors Research Labs.; and Lawrence M. Patrick, Libbey Owens Ford Co. (formerly with Wayne State University). Knees of 13 unembalmed human cadavers and a Part 572 dummy were impacted with a pendulum having either 203 mm square aluminum honeycomb or Styrofoam DB striking surface. Impacts were made along the femoral axis of rigidly mounted legs with a 52.3 kg pendulum at velocities of 1.8 and 3.6 m/s. Forces transmitted through the femur and tibia (at the ankle) were measured to determine the force response distribution. Pendulum acceleration parallel to the femoral axis was measured for all tests. Knee penetrations into the striking surface material were obtained by double integration of the pendulum acceleration-time traces, were verified by analysis of high speed movies, and were compared with the projected contact areas as penetration increased. Impact responses are presented as crossplots of force versus depth of knee penetration into the interface material. For aluminum honeycomb impacts at 3.6 m/s, the mean peak force resulting from cadaver impacts is lower than the mean peak force resulting from dummy knee impacts. However, for Styrofoam DB impacts at 3.6 m/s, the mean force-penetration response of the cadaver knees is similar to the response of the Part 572 dummy knee. Significant differences in peak force levels for the cadaver and dummy were not observed with either aluminum honeycomb or with Styrofoam DB at 1.8 m/s impact velocities. 1977 SAE Transactions 770940. (P-73) Computerized Side Impact Injury Anal- ysis. M. Monk, A. Burgett and L. DeLarm, U.S. Dept. of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. This paper describes an analysis of 221 car-to-car side impact collisions selected from the Multi-Disciplinary Accident Investigation files. The selected cases were analyzed with the aid of the CRASH (Calspan Recon- struction of Accident Speeds on the Highway) computer model. Only those cases which are within the assumptions of this computer model are included. Several parameters which relate crash severity to occupant injury are displayed in graphical form. The 133</page><page sequence="119">770941 -770953 paper also addressed the variability in the injuries which are found in the accident file. It is shown in this paper that the many crash environment parameters may essentially be reduced to two parameters, point of contact within the vehicle and the relative velocity between the occupant and the interior contact. The correlation between occupant injury and these two descriptive parameters is shown by graphs and discussion. The approximate injury tolerance thresholds are shown and discussed. Findings in the accident data are substantiated and supplemented by the use of another computer model which simulates the structural response of the vehicle as well as the occupant. 1977 SA E Transactions 770941. (P-73) Traumatic and Cost Mainpoints of Injury Model and Cause of Injury Concerning Un- restraint and Restraint Child Car Occupants and Aggressivity and Cost of Injuries by Vehicle Front Shapes and Elements in Real Pedestrian Acci- dents. G. StÃ¼rtz, Institute of Automotive Engi- neering, Technical University Berlin (Germany). A presupposition for the engagement of effective meas- ures for motor cars with the aim of reducing the trauma of traffic participants are findings of the Traffic Accident Research about the influence of vehicle-, traffic partic- ipant- as well as accident- parameter on trauma. Contrary to dummy tests, the correlation dummy - human body, vital - postmortem tissue is eliminated in the analysis of real accidents. It is however, supplemented by the age parameter. Besides assessing the trauma of single body regions, it is also possible to evaluate the overall trauma of the body. From the traffic accident development of the FRG it is evident that the relative danger for child passenger car-occupants as well as for pedestrians, compared with other groups of traffic participants is increasing. Based on 130 medically and technically thoroughly worked out single-case analyses of real accidents involving child car-occupants the importance of supposed major influencing parameters on trauma, such as impact direc- tion, seating position as well as age, have been inves- tigated. For the comparison of groups and as a measure of the dynamic load to the vehicle during the crash phase, the vector of resultant speed changing (Av) of the center of gravity of car is calculated. For the valuation of the trauma, costs arising as injury sequence - assessed separately for children and other people - are applied under consideration of injury frequency and average Av of groups to draw comparisons. For improvement measures, the injury causes are analysed by their costs. Finally the use-value and - as an example - the use/cost-value for restraint devices used by children, and for types of restraint-system disfunctions are calculated in line of order with their costs as sequence of their suffered injuries. 770950. YAH-64 Advanced Attack Helicopter Design Tradeoffs. John C. Dendy, Hughes Helicopters. The Army's new Advanced Attack Helicopter - the YAH-64 - achieves high performance with low cost and excellent maintainability. These desirable characteristics result from the Design Simplicity which has been inherent in the design approach since conception in 1972 and throughout the Phase 1 and Phase 2 development and flight test program. This inherent simplicity is the direct result of several fundamental decisions regarding basic configuration, plus intensive discipline at all levels of the design. 770951. The Bell Model 222. James R. Garrison and Herman H. Waldrup, Bell Helicopter Textron. This paper describes the design objectives, features and performance of the recently developed Bell Model 222. The Model 222 was designed to meet the needs of the world-wide commercial market. Primary design objectives were safety, efficiency, reduced cost of ownership, and superior handling qualities. From the test results, the Model 222 is a fuel conservative, productive aircraft with excellent flying qualities. Federal Aviation Administration Airworthiness Stan- dards, Transport Category Rotorcraft (FAR Part 29 -Category A) provides the basis for civil certification; however, the 222 far exceeds the FAA requirements for fail-safe design and crashworthiness. Redundancy, 8g seats, crash resistant fuel tanks, and real twin-engine safety are examples. The latter refers to the fact that for any altitude at which the helicopter can hover OGE, it can continue to cruise if one engine fails. The first flight was in August 1976 and development is essentially complete. The aircraft will be delivered in early 1979 after the most comprehensive test program ever conducted on a commercial helicopter. 770952. Anny UTTAS Program. Robert A. Wolfe, De- velopment and Engrg., U.S. Army Aviation, Research and Development Command. This paper addresses the U.S. Army's latest developed utility helicopter with a contract recently awarded to Sikorsky Aircraft for the Utility Tactical Aircraft System (UTTAS) recently designated "BLACK HAWK". A brief history into the background of the Army's requirements and need for a UTTAS, history of development, general description with intended missions, planned activities and significant capabilities is provided. It will be shown that concentrated efforts on reliability and maintainability characteristics which, when combined with stringent performance and survivability requirements provide an aircraft which enhanced operational capabilities on the modern day battlefield. 770953. XV-15 Tilt Rotor Test Progress Report. James H. Brown, Jr. and H. Kipling Edenborough, NASA-Ames Research Center and Aerome- chanics Lab., U.S. Army Research &amp; Technol- 134</page><page sequence="120">770954-770961 ogy Labs. (AVRADCOM); and David D. Few, V/STOL Aircraft Technology Div., NASA- Ames Research Center. In a continuing effort to expand the versatility of their aircraft, VTOL designers have for many years tried to combine the desirable features of various concepts into a single aircraft. This is a formidable task and most efforts have met with limited success. This paper explores the need for an aircraft combining the efficient VTOL capability of a helicopter with the efficient high speed characteristics of a fixed wing turboprop. The ability of the tilt rotor concept to fill this requirement and examples as to its potential usefulness in both military and civil missions is discussed. The history of the concept and the status of the current Army/NASA/Bell XV- 15 program and its role in proving the viability of the concept are reviewed. 770954. Status Report on the Advancing Blade Concept (ABC)â¢ Technology Demonstrator Program. Vincent P. Bailey, ABC Program, Sikorsky Aircraft, Stratford, Connecticut. The high speed limitations of rotorcraft resulting from lack of retreating blade lifting capability are well known. A potential solution to this problem is offered by the Sikorsky Advancing Blade Concept utilizing a co-axial counter-rotating very stiff rotor system. Initiated origi- nally on corporate independent research and development (IR&amp;D) funds, the concept was subsequently supported through the full scale wind tunnel testing and flight tests by the U.S. Army Air Mobility Laboratories (now Research and Technology Laboratories AVRADCOM). Low speed testing has been completed and high speed testing is now about to commence with additional support from NASA and the Navy as well as the Army, utilizing auxiliary propulsion engines provided by the Air Force. This paper explains the Advancing Blade Concept and describes the results achieved thus far in the ABC Technology Demonstrator Program. 770956. A Three Dimensional Finite Difference Code for Seismic Analysis on the Illiac IV Parallel Proc- essor. A. Stewart Hopkins, Institute for Ad- vanced Computation. The speed and data storage limitations of most current computer systems make the cost of realistic three dimensional seismic simulations prohibitive. One excep- tion is the implementation of the earthquake simulation code TRES on the ILLIAC IV. The ILLIAC IV is a parallel processor, consisting of 64 processing elements, each executing the same instruction on different data. The TRES program simulates the propagation of elastic waves emanating from an earthquake using a centered, finite difference scheme over a large three dimensional grid. The algorithms of the program have been modified for the unique computational environment of the ILLIAC IV parallel processor. 770958. Identification of Structural Component Failures Under Dynamic Loading. Stepan Simonian and Gary C. Hart, Univ. of California, LA. For purposes of parameter identification, a class of N-degree of freedom dynamical systems are decoupled, to a single degree of freedom subsystem. This is achieved by utilizing all measured accelerations, and a coordinate transformation. In cases where additional data of strains of displacements are available, the decoupled equations are further simplified. The merits of this decoupling are clearly indicated. 770959. Application of Perturbation Methods to Improve Analytical Model Correlation with Test Data. J. A. Garba and B. K. Wada, Structures and Materials Section, Jet Propulsion Lab. There are current and future requirements to develop a systematic method to update a mathematical model of a structure to more closely match the test data. The effort is cost effective since the number of reanalyses of a large structure will be reduced. Additionally, the mathematical model will more closely represent its test data. This activity describes the positive and negative experiences in using a method published by C. W. White and an extension of the method. The results are based upon our understanding of the method as published. 770960. Improved Dynamic Modeling of a Space-Shuttle Turbo-Pump. David A. Evensen and Jon D. Chrostowski, J. H. Wiggins Co. The dynamic response of turbo-pumps has traditionally been modeled mathematically using electrical networks. A recently developed computer program is used herein to adjust the model parameters (L - inductance, R- resis- tance, C - capacitance, etc.) of the electrical network in an attempt to bring the analytical response of the network into closer agreement with newly-available experimental results. Results are presented for a fully-wetted (non- cavi tating) test of a Space-Shuttle Turbo-Pump and a significant improvement in the dynamic model is achieved. 770961. A Microprocessor Based Sequencer for Gas Turbine Engines. D. Risch, Woodward Gov- ernor Co. In recent years, electronic controls and sequencers have gained increasing acceptance for use in control of industrial gas turbine engines. This has been due to increased reliability of electronic components and more complex control requirements. A technological innova- tion, the microprocessor, is likely to accelerate this trend and provide a new level of sophistication to controls of this type. Basically, a microprocessor is a digital computer which has been reduced to a circuit less than 1/4" square. This circuit will perform a sequence of operations or instructions according to a predetermined plan or pro- 135</page><page sequence="121">770962 - 770967 gram. The program is stored in another pin-head sized electronic circuit called a Read Only Memory or ROM. When provided with a means of communicating with the outside world, these circuits can perform exceedingly fast and accurate calculations needed to control a gas turbine engine. This paper will explore one approach to the practical application of microprocessors to this problem. 770962. Design and Application of Programmable Se- quencers to Gas Turbines. L. Nigogosian, Con- trol and Instrumentation Div., Ultra Electronics Ltd. (London). The advantage of programmable sequencers over relay logic and mechanical timers is assuming increasing importance since electronic systems are more versatile and reliable. The 1K1 series of programmable sequencers are designed primarily for gas turbine type applications where reliability failure detection, rapid fault finding and quick program changes are of prime importance. The operation of the sequencer is described em- phasising its modular construction its powerful instruction set and the ease with which the system can be defined to operate any size of plant. The failure detection aspect of the system is described showing how failure can be diagnosed to a particular module. Finally various pro- gramming aids are described showing how accurate programs can be developed rapidly. 770963. Application of a Programmable Engine Control to the Gas Turbine. Douglas J. Court, Ultra Elec- tronics Inc. Electronic control of the gas turbine engine is now widely accepted. Advances in electronic technology have af- forded the controls manufacturers with several alternative methods of design. This paper describes in detail the successful application of a programmable control unit combining analog and digital circuit techniques for the ERD A/Chrysler Upgraded turbine engine. In addition to the Chrysler program this Programmable Analog Control has been applied to turbines of several hundred horse- power, several thousand horsepower and tens of thou- sands of horsepower. 770965. Land-Based Aircraft Options for Naval Missions. William D. O'Neil, Dept. of Defense, Office of the Director of Defense Research and Engrg. Advances in aeronautical technology favor increased application of land-based aircraft to naval missions. A number of aircraft types now combine attractive mission capabilities with good coverage of ocean areas from available bases. Further developments can be expected to improve mission capabilities and/or range. The result is a broader range of options for naval planners. 1977 SA E Transactions 770966. Advanced Concepts for Sea Control. Peter J. Mantle, Mantle Engrg. Co., Inc., Office of Chief of Naval Operations. The present paper discusses some possible surface and air vehicle concepts under consideration for the future U.S. Navy sea control mission. The desirable features of such concepts are discussed together with selected examples to illustrate some of the more novel characteristics and operational advantages. The pivotal question of afforda- bility is addressed expressed in terms of major parameters of weight and power. Care has been taken to note that there is both a need to develop concepts to satisfy projected requirements as well as explore concepts that may open up new capabilities. 770967. An Innovative Approach to the Design of a Durable Scavenge System for a Gas Turbine Engine Integral Particle Separator. M. Zoccoli, Avco Lycoming Div.; and D. Cale, U.S. Army Mobility Research &amp; Development Lab. Gas turbine engine inlet particle separators requiring a positive extraction means subject the scavenging element to an extremely high concentration of sand and dust particles. Conventional bladed fans, if used as the scavenge means for the engine particle separator, degrade rapidly in performance and mechanical reliability and are thus limited in operational life. One solution to this problem is to design a scavenge blower such that the rotating component is afforded protection from erosion damage by means of an inertial separator incorporated into the blower inlet section. This concept, termed "self-bypassing", diverts a fraction of the total flow into the scavenge system past the rotor. That fraction contains the majority of the particles scavenged from the separator. Downstream of the rotor, the two flows rejoin at the mixing point of a concentric annular ejector. Thus, the exhaust from the rotor is used to expel the highly concentrated bypass stream from the system via an ejector. A prototype of this design, configured for 1.0 lb/sec airflow, 25 inches of water total pressure rise, and 50,000 rpm operating speed was tested at a sand ingestion rate of 400 gm/hr using MIL-E-5007C type sand, 200 micron mean particle diameter. The initial design objective was 50 hours of operation with no more than 10 percent loss in airflow, simulating approximately 1000 hours of inter- mittent usage in hostile gas turbine environments. The initial 50-hour test showed no appreciable change in performance. A total of 120 hours of test time was required before the system flow capacity was reduced by 5 percent. A "self-bypassing" scavenge blower is applicable to installations requiring exceptional durability and com- pactness at modest levels of power consumption. The degree of durability achieved in this type of design is a function largely of the amount of air which is caused to bypass the rotor. Application of this versatile concept requires a tradeoff analysis between the operational life desired versus the increase in power consumption as the degree of protection is increased. 1977 SA E Transactions 136</page><page sequence="122">770968 - 770976 770968. Design of an Industrial Gas Turbine Intake - A Critical Item. Robert E. Osborne, American Air Filter Co., Inc. The design of stationary industrial gas turbine inlet systems has a dramatic effect on turbine performance. Insufficient filtration can shorten the intervals between maintenance. Misapplied filtration can starve turbine intake air, thereby reducing performance. Turbine inlet noise, on the other hand, is a prime source of turbine noise which must be silenced. Both problems, filtration and noise, must be consid- ered for optimum performance. 770969. Space Shuttle Pogo Prevention. Harold H. Doiron, NASA Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center. The Space Shuttle structural and propulsion system configurations present new and more complex mecha- nisms for pogo instabilities than experienced with previous launch vehicle development programs. A comprehensive plan integrating mathematical model development, sta- bility analysis, verification testing, and pogo suppressor development was implemented to avoid pogo instability in the Space Shuttle design. Suppressor requirement studies led to selection of gas-filled accumulators located at the Space Shuttle main engine high-pressure oxidizer turbo- pump inlets. These pogo suppressors are currently under- going development testing before installation for single- engine and clustered-engine firings. 770970. 747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft /Space Shuttle Or- biter Mated Ground Vibration Test: Data via Transient Excitation and Fast Fourier Transform Analysis. N. L. Olsen and M. J. Walter, The Boeing Co. The experimental procedure employed to define the natural modes of vibration of the 747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and Space Shuttle Orbiter mated configuration is described. A discussion of test results and comparison to structural analysis results is also included. Random transient signals were used as inputs to electromagnetic shakers to provide excitation to the mated vehicle test configuration. Acceleration signals were processed via the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm. Magnitude and phase transfer functions were formed and processed to produce modal frequencies, damping, and modal displacements. 770971. Flutter Tests of the Mated 747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft-Orbiter. Lowell V. Andrew, Space Div., Rockwell International. Flutter tests of the mated 747 shuttle carrier aircraft- orbiter are discussed from the viewpoint of the flutter engineer of the prime Space Shuttle contractor, the Space Division of Rockwell International. The telemetered data that he and the other test team members monitored on real-time displays are described, as are the safety criteria applied during buffet tests. The instrumentation and telemetering of orbiter data are treated for both the unpowered (inert) and the powered up (active) orbiter. Highlights of each flight, including the crew's comments, are reported, along with details pertinent to the structural dynamics of the system. 770973. Experimental Studies of the Space Shuttle Pay- load Acoustic Environment. Allan G. Piersol and Peter E. Rentz, Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. Two series of experiments were conducted to reduce the uncertainties concerning the Space Shuttle payload bay acoustic environment. Tests using a one-fifth scale model showed large changes in level below 125 Hz with the introduction of typical payloads. The changes were associated with particular acoustic modal behavior and were sensitive to the type of acoustic excitation. Another series of experiments evaluated the noise reduction of the first orbiter vehicle (OV-101). The results showed consis- tently greater noise reduction for grazing excitation than for diffuse excitation. The results were extrapolated to OV-102 using mass law relations and acceleration meas- urements. 1977 SA E Transactions 770974. Transient Expansion of the Components of an Air Seal on a Gas Turbine Disc. N. R. L. Maccallum, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Univ. of Glasgow (Scotland). Using simple finite-difference models with appropriate boundary conditions, methods have been developed for predicting the movements of the critical components of an air seal on the face of the first High Pressure Turbine Disc of a typical two-spool Gas Turbine. The methods have been applied to two testing transients - the acceleration and the deceleration between the Ground Idling and Maximum Speeds. In the acceleration, seal openings of double the equilibrium value are predicted to persist for 30 s after completion of the speed transient. 770975. Holographic Inspection of Jet Engine Composite Fan Blades. E. J. Delgrosso and C. E. Carlson, Hamilton Standard Div., United Technologies Corp. A holographic inspection method was developed for composite spar/shell fan blades, such as an experimental fan blade and an advanced fan blade. This method was employed to insure the quality of newly fabricated blades. Holographic inspection also was used to indicate initiation and growth of cracks as a result of resonant fatigue testing and spin testing. Metallographic examinations were conducted to show the good correlation between the holographic data and actual blade structures. 1977 SA E Transactions 770976. Turbine Engine Slip Ring Technology - A Survey. James A. Young, Thornton H. Gogoli and E. W. Glossbrenner, Poly-Scientific, Litton Systems Inc. 137</page><page sequence="123">770980 - 770985 Aircraft turbine engine development is requiring more and more spool data to be recorded during testing. This data, which normally consists of thermocouple and strain gage type signals, demands so many channels of quality transmission as to preclude bulky and costly telemetry devices. Miniature slip ring capsule assemblies, originally developed for inertial navigation equipment, have been adapted and used in turbine applications at speeds in excess of 30,000 revolutions per minute. These slip ring and brush contacts are characterized by low resistance variation or other electrical interference. The principal adaptation required to achieve these life times is the provision of an adequate coolant/lubricant supply. 770980. Impact of Engine Cycle Parameters on V/STOL Type A Configuration and Commonality. J. D. Louthan, Vought Corporation. Propulsion system parameter selection for a V/STOL design must recognize a set of priorities somewhat different from those identified with classical engine cycle analysis. Propulsion and airframe design parameters interplay to a major extent in driving the configuration. This interplay highlights the importance of properly selecting thrust geometry, lift cruise fan parameters and the number of core engines to be employed. V/STOL A missions as currently defined converge in a propulsion system "design space" which suggests that propulsion commonality is attractive. The desirability of commonality expansion to other design arenas can be grossly evaluated in the conceptual design phase by use of a commonality payoff function. 1977 SA E Transactions 770982. Sensitivity Studies for Several High Performance VSTOL Concepts. Herbert H. Driggers, Vought Corp. Several VSTOL fighter/attack study configurations em- ploying alternative propulsion concepts were evaluated to common mission, performance and technology ground- rules. This paper describes each concept and compares weight sensitivities for variations in mission and combat performance constraints. The lowest takeoff weight and highest performance was achieved by the vertical attitude takeoff and landing (VATOL) configurations. A similar lift plus lift/cruise design was typically 10 percent heavier for equal performance. Ejector and fan augmentors were not competitive with jet lift concepts on a performance basis. All configurations were capable of vertical landing with one engine inoperative. 770983. Comparison of Non-Axisymmetric &amp; Axisym- metric Nozzles Installed on a V/STOL Fighter Model. W. C. Schnell and R. L. Grossman, Grumman Aerospace Corporation; and G. E. Hoff, General Electric Co. An experimental program sponsored by the Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory, utilizing a l/8th scale advanced twin engine, thrust vectoring V/STOL fighter wind tunnel jet effects model developed for the Naval Air Propulsion Test Center, was completed in June of 1977 at the Arnold Engineering Development Center. The exper- imental program consisted of three primary parts: (1) measurement of the static internal performance charac- teristics of several non-axisymmetric nozzles and a baseline axisymmetric nozzle; (2) comparison of the installed dry power performance of the non-axisymmetric nozzles with the axisymmetric nozzles; and (3) meas- urement of the inflight thrust vectoring propulsion induced aerodynamic effects of the non-axisymmetric nozzle installation. This paper describes the results from parts (1) and (2) of this program. Results from part (3) will be presented in a future publication. The part (2) wind tunnel results indicate major installed performance im- provements for the non-axisymmetric nozzles over the conventional axisymmetric nozzles. The overall program produced a significant contribution to the developing non-axisymmetric nozzle/airplane installation data base. 1977 SA E Transactions 770984. Development of the Propulsion Simulator - A Test Tool Applicable to V/STOL Configurations. M. F. Eigenmann, McDonnell Aircraft Com- pany, A Division of McDonnell Douglas Cor- poration; and R. O. Bailey, NASA-Ames Re- search Center. The demanding performance requirements of advanced turbine-powered tactical aircraft have made it important to understand and accurately evaluate the propulsion system/airframe interactions. The turbine engine multi- mission propulsion simulator offers the potential for accurate evaluation of these interactions by permitting the simultaneous simulation of inlet/airframe/nozzle flow- fields on a single wind tunnel model. Extensive simulator usage is expected during developmental testing of super- sonic V/STOL and inflight thrust vectoring configura- tions, which have significant flowfield interactions. The simulator has been successfully demonstrated in a wind tunnel test program, and is currently undergoing devel- opment to a more compact version. 1977 SA E Transactions 770985. The Impact of Emerging Technologies on Tactical V/STOL Airplane Design and Utility. I. H. Rettie and R. C. Sutton, Boeing Co. A new look at tactical combat V/STOL design and utility as affected by emerging technology and mission concepts is given in this paper. History has shown that a certain level of useful load fraction must be attained before an airplane system can be considered operationally suc- cessful. Technology trends reviewed in this paper suggest that the time is here or at least near for V/STOL tactical aircraft to achieve a truly viable useful load fraction. Propulsion, structure, and controls technologies will contribute to the success of the tactical V/STOL system. In addition, aerodynamic technology as related to inter- 138</page><page sequence="124">770988 - 770995 ference effects in hover and transition, and as required for efficient supersonic cruise and combat, significantly impacts the design solution. A unique approach to system design risk assessment is described with results giving technology leverage as a function of design options. 770988. Development of Low Pressure Ratio Vectoring Nozzles for V/STOL Aircraft. C. R. Limage, Vought Corporation. Results of a parametric test program of low pressure ratio deflected nozzles show the performance changes to be significant for vectoring nozzles and variations in nozzle thrust co-efficients should be included in engine cycle trade studies to obtain realistic aircraft performance. Low pressure ratio deflected nozzle performance is shown to be sensitive to nozzle pressure ratio, nozzle contraction ratio, turning radius, diffuser area ratio and the presence of an integral core flow exhaust stream. The effectiveness of venting the inside surface of the nozzle turn is also demonstrated. 1977 SA E Transactions 770989. A Clutch for V/STOL. W. H. Thomas, Detroit Diesel Allison Div. of General Motors Corp. This paper describes the requirements, design, and early testing of a flight weight V/STOL clutch. A clutch is required between the combiner box and the forward or nose fan for some versions of V/STOL aircraft. This clutch has been designed to transmit 11,000 HP at fan drive speeds, and be capable of minimum engagement times and rapid cycling. This paper will cover the mechanical arrangement and control system of this clutch. 770990. NAVTOLAND (Navy Vertical Takeoff and Landing Capability Development) Project. Thomas S. Momiyama, Advanced Aircraft De- velopment and Systems Objectives Office, Naval Air Systems Command. The NAVTOLAND project is the Navy's integrated systems approach to improve the V/STOL aircraft and helicopter operational capabilities at sea and in tactical sites from the current 200 foot ceiling and 1/2 nautical mile visibility weather minima and Sea State 3 level ship motion limits to the zero ceiling and 1/8 nm visibility and Sea State 5. A coordinated development of the aircraft flight control and display systems to provide flying qÃºalities with satisfactory level of pilot workload and the shipboard and tactical site installed approach and landing guidance systems and visual landing aids to effect precision in touchdown will be applied toward improve- ment of the AV-8 Harrier and helicopter operations and development of total all-weather and rough sea operations of all future Navy and Marine Corps V/STOL aircraft and shipboard platforms and tactical sites. 770991. Modular Engine Maintenance Concept Consid- erations for Aircraft Turbine Engines. David B. Edmunds, Propulsion Performance/Stability Div., Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Maintenance on gas turbine engines results from failures in one or more of the engine's major subsections. Maintenance and support costs can be reduced if the capability exists to isolate the failures down to the lowest possible component in the engine. The modular engine maintenance concept has recently been evolved to facilitate this cost reduction. The important considera- tions as well as the benefits of this concept are discussed. Considerations included are: 1) design, 2) failure modes and isolation techniques, and 3) implementation. The Air Force F 100- PW- 100 engine maintenance concept is used for discussion purposes. 770992. Gas Turbine Module Performance Analysis. Alan R. Ebstein, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Group, Div. of United Technologies. A new approach to analyzing changes in gas turbine engine module performance levels has been developed. This method utilizes two dimensional vector space diagrams and nomographs which describe module per- formance changes as a function of dependent gas path parameter changes. The slopes and magnitudes of the vectors are determined from influence coefficients for the engine cycle being analyzed. 1977 SA E Transactions 770993.

Suitability of Military Specification Lubricants for Two-Stroke RPV Engines. Howard W. Mar- bach, Jr. and John A. Russell, U.S. Army Fuels and Lubricants Research Lab.; and Kent F. Smith, U.S. Army Air Mobility Research and Development Lab. The Army is exploring the feasibility of using Remotely Piloted Vehicles (RPV's) in a multi-mission role. Power- plants for these RPV's are to be small, two-stroke, air-cooled, reciprocating engines which require a fuel/oil mix for operation. As no federal or military specification lubricant exists for this application, this paper details results of an analytical/experimental investigation to evaluate the suitability of existing MIL SPEC lubricant classes for Army RPV use. Performance of a limited sampling of military specification lubricants was evalu- ated by cyclic testing with a small two-stroke, air-cooled piston engine currently used in the Army AQUILA RPV. An ashless dispersant lubricant qualified to Boating Industry of America standards for two-cycle, water- cooled engines (BIA/TC-W) was used for reference. Standard magneto ignition and engine cooling were used in 20 of the 23 tests. The final three tests explored the combined effects of capacitive discharge ignition and elevated cylinder head temperature. 770998. Twenty Year Evolution of the WR2/WR24 Series of Small Turbojet Engines. Richard J. Mandle, Williams Research Corp. About 20 years ago, the existence of a new miniature turbojet engine inspired an imaginative designer to create a small unmanned aircraft for reconnaissance missions. This marked the beginning of a new era of turbojet development. Visionary designers predicted that miniature engines would someday perform missions comparable to those of larger unmanned aircraft. The WR2/WR24 series of engines has grown from the original 50-lb thrust to over 200-lb thrust. Unique challenges were encountered during the early period as the engine developers found themselves pioneering a spe- cialized field. Innovative concepts were necessary to maintain simplicity, light weight and high performance. 770999. Design and Analysis of Propellers for Low Reynolds Number Application to Mini-RPV's. Henry V. Borst, Henry V. Borst &amp; Associates. This report presents the design and analysis of propellers applied to mini-remotely piloted vehicles along with the methods used. Modifications to the airfoil data used for predicting the profile drag losses were necessary to account for operation at the low Reynolds number encountered by mini-RPV propellers. The correction was determined from the available airfoil data and low Reynolds number propeller test data. Using the revised methods of propeller analysis, optimum propellers were designed and analyzed. The study showed that improved performance can be obtained with new propeller designs. This study was conducted under contract No. DAAJ02-76-C-0031 with the Eustis Directorate, U.S. Army Mobility Research and Development Laboratory, Fort Eustis, Virginia 23604. 1977 SA E Transactions 771001. Constant Speed Generating Systems. John V. Burns, Sunstrand Aviation Corp. Synchronous generators operating at constant speed are used to supply the electric power systems of most modern aircraft. The constant speed salient pole generator inherently develops the output power in the desired form, a sine wave of 400 hertz frequency. The hydromechanical constant speed drive, a straightforward, rugged combi- nation of a planetary gear set and hydraulic units, is most frequently chosen to achieve the constant speed. The design of the constant speed generating system has evolved through experience, development, and state- of-the-art advances. The current system, the integrated drive generator, has the advantages of weight, perform- ance, reliability, and ease of maintenance. Continued engineering effort is dedicated to achieving further advances. 771002. Variable Speed Constant Frequency (VSCF) Aircraft Electrical Power. E. B. Canfield and J. W. Summerford, Aircraft Equipment Div., Gen- eral Electric Co. This paper describes the operation, design, performance, and application of high reliability, variable speed constant frequency (VSCF) aircraft electric power generating systems. A high frequency, multi-phase, brushless gen- erator supplies power to a frequency converter which conditions the variable frequency generator output into precision 3-phase, 115/200V, 400 Hz aircraft power, using the cycloconverter principle. Systems have been built with ratings from 20 to 150 kva. For a 75 kva system, the weight to rating ratio is about 1.6 lbs/kva and rated load efficiency is 80%. Predicted MTBF for current systems is in the 2000 to 6000 hour range. 771003. Electronic Converter Electric Power Supply (ECEPS) - KC-135. Robert Kautz, Electric &amp; Fluid Power Div., Bendix Corp.

It consists of a gearbox, a generator, a DC link converter, and an air-to-oil heat exchanger. The entire system is oil cooled. 140</page><page sequence="126">771004-771009 771004. Electromechanical Flight Control Actuation. Daniel K. Bird, Air Force Flight Dynamics Lab., Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. The new rare-earth sammarium-cobalt magnets are revolutionizing electromechanical actuation design to the extent that power-by-wire can be a legitimate follow-on to fly-by-wire. These new magnets coupled with innovative design techniques which feature direct interface with fly-by-wire are creating electromechanical actuator de- signs that are highly competitive to hydraulic actuators in terms of weight, space, and performance. A major promise of these new electromechanical actuators is to permit unification of total secondary power systems under a single medium, electrical. 771006. Power by Wire for Aircraft - The All-Electric Airplane. C. W. Helsley, Jr., Rockwell Inter- national. The achievement of a single-power generation distribution and utilization system on future high-performance aircraft will yield many benefits in the form of improved maintainability, reliability, and logistics. It will also reduce aircraft weight and the number of skill catagories required in maintenance training programs. Current aircraft have two parallel and nearly equal-sized secon- dary power systems (electrical and hydraulic). Of the two, only electrical has the potential for powering all signif- icant functions on the aircraft from radio to landing gear. However, even though electrical power generation and distribution has always been competitive with hydraulic, electrical actuators (utilization) have been heavy and slow. For this reason, hydraulics have for many years monop- olized all actuation applications in which power and/or frequency response requirements were moderately high. With the advent of high specific output, low inertia, rare-earth permanent magnet-type electric motors, the aircraft actuation field was reopened to electric motors. This, in turn, made possible the "all-electric" airplane, and significant power system (generation and distribution system) weight savings. For the B-l aircraft, used as a typical example in this paper, these savings were on the order of 566 pounds. Servo-motor versions of these new electric motors will be adequate for most actuation functions. However, certain specific functions on advanced high-performance aircraft will still exceed the motor's capability in terms of power and/or frequency response. It is shown in this paper that the application of a mechanical servo-power package (MSPP) to these functions will meet the power and frequency response requirements, and will save additional weight. The MSPP consists of an electric motor, an adapter gearbox, a flywheel, a mechanical controller, and a mechanical hinge. The MSPP is shown to be capable of meeting high power demands while achieving a frequency response nearly an order of magnitude higher than the electric motor servo design goal. Through the energy storage features of the flywheel, the MSSP is able to save additional weight. On the B-l aircraft, this weight saving is 1,046 pounds. It is also shown that -the total weight savings on the B-l aircraft, as a result of converting to the "all electric" airplane configuration, is 1,642 pounds. 1977 SA E Transactions 771007. Flight Testing an 8000 PSI Lightweight Hydrau- lic System. J. N. Demarchi, Rockwell Inter- national Corp.; and John Ohlson, Naval Air Development Center. This paper describes the flight testing of an 8000 psi Lightweight Hydraulic System. The objective was to reduce weight and space requirements of the hydraulic system in future, high density Navy aircraft. An 8000 psi Lateral Control System was installed in a T-2C (basic Navy trainer) airplane. Four different pilots evaluated the test installation, accumulating a total of 1 1.5 flight hours. No malfunctions occurred in the 8000 psi system; pilot comments were favorable. Operational characteristics of the 8000 psi system were very similar to the T-2C 3000 psi lateral control system. The test installation performed ex- ceptionally well; fluid temperatures were nominal, pres- sure fluctuations were small, fluid particulate generation was low, and component endurance was projected to be satisfactory. 771008.

Advanced Turboprop Propulsion System Relia- bility and Maintenance Cost. Philip C. Stolp, Detroit Diesel Allison, Div. of General Motors; and James A. Baum, Hamilton Standard, Div. of United Technologies. The reliability and maintenance cost (R&amp;MC) for an advanced turbine engine and prop-fan propulsion system is projected for high speed commercial airline use in the 1990s. The R&amp;MC values are compared with current turboprop values and detailed discussion of the advances necessary to achieve the projected R&amp;MC is provided to substantiate maintenance cost reductions on the order of 50 to 60%. These advances include an on-condition maintenance philosophy in conjunction with diagnostics to monitor system performance, improved reliability in the initial design that is consistent with air-line usage and life requirements, improved modularity to reduce line maintenance time and aircraft down time, and simplified hardware in conjunction with modularity to reduce shop maintenance cost. Comparison of the advanced turboprop 141</page><page sequence="127">771010-771013 system maintenance cost with that of an advanced turbofan system shows it has competitive levels. 771010. Advanced Supersonic Transport Propulsion Sys- tems. Robert A. Howlett and Martin G. Smith, Jr., Commercial Products Div., Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Group, United Technologies Corp. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is engaged in a Supersonic Cruise Airplane Research (SCAR) Program to study and experimentally evaluate advanced technology that is applicable to future supersonic transports. A broad spectrum of advanced engine concepts including Variable Cycle Engines (VCEs) has been evaluated by Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft (P&amp;WA) in conjunction with the SCAR Program. This paper describes some of the advanced engine concepts and VCEs that were evaluated, and summarizes the features and problems of each engine. Based on the results from this study, one engine has been identified as being the most promising, the Variable Stream Control Engine (VSCE). It has the potential to significantly reduce jet noise and to improve airplane performance relative to first-generation supersonic transport (SST) engines. Fu- ture propulsion programs that are required for the United States to reach a competitive position in the advanced supersonic commercial airplane market are also reviewed. 1977 SA E Transactions 771011.
