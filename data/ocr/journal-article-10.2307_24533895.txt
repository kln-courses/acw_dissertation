<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOURNAL OF THE WASHINGTON ACADEMY OF SCIENCES Vol. 46 June 1956 No. 6 GENERAL SCIENCE. -Man and science1 Raymond J. Seeger, National Science Foundation. (Received May 7, 1956) One of the great issues today is the rela tion of man to science. I have deliberately used the phrase man and science, rather than science and man, to suggest that man himself is the key to the problem. I shall stress only the scientific aspect of this rela tionship today although I am quite sensi tive to the human significance. One phase of the issue may be stated thus: Is science inherently individualistic? If so, personal freedom is a primary requi site for each scientist. Or, is science essen tially social? Then government planning is a fundamental necessity for all science. The present emphasis all over the world seems to be on the social importance of science, arising probably from the promi nent place it occupies in the economic struc ture of modern society (cf. the medieval social interest in astrology and alchemy). First of all, man is searching intensively for all kinds of materials and for cheap sources of energy, owing partly to catastrophic World War II losses, partly to normal population growth, and partly to an ever increasing demand for commodities. Sec ondly, the dramatic use of atomic energy within six years after its identification has encouraged a belief that the usual time lag between discovery and application can be greatly decreased by a sufficient expenditure of simultaneous efforts. (A more recent, but less well-known example from solid-state science is the invention of the transistor.) It is conceivable that the mastery of nature through science will make possible the mas tery of the world. The uppermost question, therefore, in everyone's mind is this: if science is to rule the world, who is to rule science? Accordingly, we find governments generally sensitive to the basic research studies of technology. Sometimes, indeed, there is a deliberate attempt to make basic research captive, often indirectly through the support of education. For example, in recent years more than 60 per cent of educa tion in Great Britain has been supported by the national government; in Germany about 90 per cent of all research at educa tional institutions has government funds for its source; in Russia technological develop ment is being exploited in an all-out effort. Even in the United States it is estimated that the Federal Government supports about 70 per cent of the research performed at educational institutions. Hence it is not surprising to find President J. D. Millet, of the University of Miami, chairman of the Commission on Financing Higher Educa tion of the Association of American Univer sities, saying, "Many of America's greatest universities are on the verge of becoming purely scientific, if not technological insti tutions." In any case the spectrum of the distribution of national funds for the sup port of science is anxiously watched as an index to technological progress. Let us, therefore, consider in more detail the question: is science essentially social? Some years ago Julian Huxley concluded his book Science and social needs with the statement: "Science is not the disembodied sort of activity that some would make out, engaged in the abstract task of pursuing universal truth, but a social function, inti 1 Vice-Presidential Address for Section L, "His tory and Philosophy of Science, 1956 Atlanta Meeting of the AAAS.
