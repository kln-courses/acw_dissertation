<plain_text><page sequence="1">STUART BAKER WITKIEWICZ AND MALINOWSKI: THE PURE FORM OF MAGIC, SCIENCE AND RELIGION Shortly after the outbreak of the First World War, Bronisiaw Mali nowski and Stanisiaw Ignacy Witkiewicz broke off a friendship which had lasted since childhood. Witkiewicz had accompanied his friend as photographer and artist on the latter's first ethnographic expedition, but after the war broke out Witkiewicz went to St. Petersburg to join the Russian Imperial Army, while Malinowski went on to New Guinea to begin his famous studies of the Trobriand Islanders. Al though the friendship was apparently never resumed after they parted company in Australia, the bond between them seems to have been quite strong, however strained it may have become at the end. Malinowski referred to the break in his diary a short time later: I am terribly dejected and dispirited by the bankruptcy of my most essential friendship_ I feel capitis dvminutio?a worthless man, of diminished value. A friend is not merely an added quantity, he is a factor, he multiplies one's individual value. Too bad?the responsibility for the break lies pri marily in his unrelenting pride, in his lack of consideration, his inability to forgive others for anything ?1 Malinowski's published diary?which covers the period between 1914 and 1918?contains numerous brief references to Witkiewicz which indicate that while he continued to regard the break as permanent, he still felt deeply about the loss of this friendship. For his part, Wit kiewicz makes several direct and indirect references to Malinowski throughout his work. These references are rather more unfriendly than otherwise, and they indicate the deep philosophical differences which divided the two men. Nevertheless, it would seem highly unlikely that Witkiewicz would have remained totally uninfluenced by his friendship with someone of Malinowski's intellect. To begin with, Witkiewicz had an extraordinary capacity for absorbing the most di vergent ideas and using them for his own purposes. This close friend 1 Bronislaw Malinowski, A Diary in the Strict Sense of the Term, New York, Harcouft, Brace &amp; World, Inc., 1967, pp. 29-30. 77</page><page sequence="2">78 The Polish Review ship, having lasted well into maturity, must have left a mark on Wit kiewicz's thinking. Despite fundamental differences in their points of view, they had many similar interests which testify to their common background. They both developed an early interest in psychoanalysis, for example, which was important in the work of both men. More significantly, Witkiewicz was greatly interested in the nature of the family and so ciety, myth and religion?which of course formed a great part of Ma linowski's life work. Malinowski became interested in anthropology shortly after receiving a Ph.D. in physics and mathematics in 1908. During a period of ill ness which interrupted his studies, he read Sir James Frazer's The Golden Bough and became, as he said later, "immersed in it and en slaved by it"2 This enthusiasm lasted his entire life. Witkiewicz's own views of society seem to have been strongly influenced by Frazer who was the outstanding representative of the evolutionist view of civiliza tion. Frazer pictured society as having developed out of an original state of homogeneity, characterized by group marriage, promiscuity, and the lack of social hierarchy. Witkiewicz gives the English an thropologist's view a characteristically Witkacian twist: The disorganized, or rather from the outset amorphous group of socially pri mitive people among the lowest savages and civilizations?to the extent that they can be called civilizations?... brought forth the concept of the individual and submitted to its dominance, in order to?after centuries of digesting it and having one's fill of it?become happy in a totally anti individual, mechanical organization; or arrive by an inverse process at the primitive stage.3 The return to uniformity is a theme which occurs throughout Wit kacy's work. The evolution of society is now coming full circle in the return to "the wonderfully run anthill."4 The individual has reached the peak of his development; what is left to civilization now is a re turn to uniformity and homogeneity. This cyclical view of the evolu tion of civilization can best be seen in three plays Witkiewicz wrote in 1921?The Metaphysics of a Two-Headed Calf, The Water Hen, and Gyubal Wahazar?which can be regarded as a kind of cosmic trilogy. The action of The Metaphysics of a Two-Headed Calf begins in Papua, where Western civilization is shown side by side with the most primitive of societies. The contrast is accented by the fact that 2 Bronisiaw Malinowski, "Myth in Primitive Psychology," in Magic, Science and Religion, New York, Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc., 1954, p. 94. 3 Stanisiaw Ignacy Witkiewicz, Pozegnanie jesieni (Farewell to Autumn), Warsaw, F.

In The Water Hen we are firmly in the Western world, but the ccstuming of the characters suggests a move ment from the eighteenth into the twentieth cenury, Le. from the past into the present The sense of historical evolution projected by the play is capped at the end with a revolution. Then in Gyubal Wahazar we are presented with what appears to be a post-revolutionary society, dominated by a terrifying and arbitrary dictator. Wahazar sees himself as sacrificing himself for his people: "We've got to go beyond the in dividual?otherwise we won't create anything. I want to restore to all of humanity what it has lost; and despite the price it has paid to get where it is, mankind is trying to become... something exactly like a beehive."5 If Gyubal expects to create a stable society with himself as its perpetual ruler, he fails. In spite of his incredible energy and violence, he seems to have a rather tenuous grip both on himself and his rule. Despite his claims to absolute control over everything, we see very early that there are a number of factors involved in the power which he wields. Power has a complex dynamics which gains momentum as the play progresses, and which will probably continue after the play ends. Within this dynamics of power there are many themes which echo Frazer's grand scheme. The most obvious is Frazer's favorite theme of the ritual killing of divine kings. He cites many examples of societies in which the king, whose strength was regarded as vital to the com munity, was not allowed to die a natural death or to become old and enfeebled. If the king was allowed to become weak, then his "spirit" and magical powers would also weaken. So whether at the end of an appointed time, at the first sign of age, or in combat with an ambitious challenger, he would be killed, and his powers would pass on to his murderer or to someone chosen by the heads of the community. Wit kiewicz uses this theme as an element in The Cuttlefish (Matwa): Rockoffer murders Hyrcan IV and thereby becomes the new Hyrcan, Hyrcan V. But the parallel is more fully developed in Gyubal Wahazar. Gyubal is clearly some kind of "divine" king. This "cruel god," as he is called by one of his terrified subjects, is in possession of mysterious, superhuman powers.6 Even his coat seems to have an almost magical significance when it is referred to as "the Pure Form of his power."7 As the play progresses, he seems to be losing some of that power. When it appears that he has been overthrown by some other mysterious 5Stanislaw Ignacy Witkiewicz, Gyubal Wahazar, in Tropical Madness: Four Plays, trans, by Daniel and Eleanor Gerould, New York, Winter House Ltd., 1972, p. 113. ?Ibid., p. 105. 7 Ibid., p. 106.</page><page sequence="4">80 The Polish Review power, Morhidetto, his erstwhile henchman, contemplates doing him in, Another character asks: "But who will take up this hellish burden after he's gone? No one. He alone had the strength."8 In the last act the problem is solved?Wahazar is ritualistically slaughtered and his mysterious power, in die form of certain strange glands, is transplanted into his successor, Father Unguenty. Gyubal dies, but his magic strength is passed on. This transfer of power and identity?including the execution of Wahazar?becomes a part of a public ceremony played out before the citizens. Later the new ruler announces: "I am now Unguenty-Wahazar in a single person. I have always been."9 Witkiewicz mentions elsewhere Frazer's theory of die rise of indi viduals to power through the practice of magic10 Magic, according to Frazer, preceded religion, and involves the belief in man's ability to control his environment. In this, he feels, it is similar to science, having its foundation in "a faith, implicit but real and firm, in the order and uniformity of nature."11 Magic and science share a belief in man's ability to understand and to control his environment. Thus magic, on the one hand, points the way to the development of science, and on the other, it permits the ablest individuals in a relatively homogeneous society to rise to positions of power and pave the way for the advance of civilization. In Gyubal Wahazar, Witkiewicz uses these same elements in a rather different and much more complex way. Gyubal himself, although in possession of some magical superhuman strength, does not fit Frazer's definition of a magician. He is god-like, existing in "another spiritual dimension."12 Unlike Frazer's magician, he feels he is beyond the rules which govern ordinary men. Whereas Frazer compares magic and science in carder to elevate magic, Witkiewicz uses the same comparison to debase science. In Rypmann, we see science reduced to the level of primitive magic Rypmann sees himself as a magician.13 He can con trol everything, he thinks, if he can only discover the right "glands." This magician, however, does not become king (as Frazer would have it), but is nonetheless an important factor in the equation of power. In this respect, Rypmann's relationship to the two Wahazars resem bles instead Malinowski's description of the way in which the chief of * Ibid., p. 150. ?Ibid., p. 167. 10 Stanikw Ignacy Witkiewicz, Niemyte dusze: Studia obyczajawe i spoieczne (Unwashed Souls: Studies of Social Manners and Morals), Unpublished, 1936. 11 Sir James Frazer, The Magic Art and the Evolution of Kings, Part I, Vol. I: The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic Religion, 3rd ed., Loindon, Macmillan, 1911, p. 220.

The more important dif ference, however, lies in Witkiewicz's attitude toward the nature of both magic and religion. The source of all religion?as of art?was, in Witkacy's view, the experience of "metaphysical feelings." This concept is in fact the most important factor in Gyubal Wahazat and underlies most of the other plays. Witkiewicz himself is not always absolutely clear as to what he meant by the phrase "metaphysical feelings,'' yet it is most important to an understanding of Witkiewicz's ideas about religion and art: Again and again it has been pointed out that the theatre had its origin in the religious mysteries. All art, like religion, which in former times was closely linked with it, has its source in metaphysical feelings... The theatre, with the progressive decline of metaphysical feelings, had to turn into a pure reproduction of life. The religious rite, losing its primary significance, gives rise to the theatre as a secondary product of its decadence.15 The function of art is to enable the spectator to experience those metaphysical feelings?which Witkiewicz defined as "the experience of the mystery of existence as unity in plurality." The myths and beliefs, which once provided this experience are now dead and those metaphysical feelings themselves are in a state of decline?only through art might they be experienced directly. Here any influence which Malinowski may have had on Witkiewicz becomes important. Since Witkacy saw in primitive beliefs that quality which he was trying to express in his plays, would he not be interested in the study of peoples for whom such beliefs were still alive? And if he used such information, it might pro vide us with a key for better understanding the plays which he wrote in attempting to express that quality. When Witkiewicz mentions Malinowski directly it is usually to take issue with him. In Farewell to Autumn there is a passage which seems at first to be in agreement with Malinowski: 14Bronislaw Malinowski, Argonauts of the Western Pacific, London, Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul Ltd., 1922, pp. 75-76. 15 Stanislaw Ignacy Witkiewicz "The Analogy with Painting," in Avant-Garde Drama: Major Plays and Documents Post World War I, ed. by Bernard F.

But it is by no means a correct assertion that any kind of state of strong emotional tension is in a position to be transmuted into a ... religious feeling_The pseudo-scientific nature of such a view, its claim not to give anything more than a description of definitely existing states (hunger, sexual desire, fear, and so on) falsifies fundamentally the entire situation_17 This reference to "the strangeness of life and of existence" sounds far more like Witkiewicz than any notion which Malinowski might have entertained. But his criticism, while not altogether fair, strikes closer to home. Malinowski was more interested in the way religion functioned in a society than in its ultimate source: Religious faith establishes, fixes, and enhances all valuable mental at titudes _This belief, embodied and maintained by cult and ceremonial, has an immense biological value, and so reveals to primitive man truth in the wider, pragmatic sense of the word.18 Witkiewicz's contempt for Malinowski's "scientific" view of reli gious belief is expressed again in a later work in which he deals with the relation of magic, religion and power: Such a first germ of a ruler as we see in the person of the Australian clan "alatunia" (magician) is a rather undefined figure. According to Frazer... everything begins with the public sorcerer; it is known that magic is the most primitive form of religion_I am an opponent of the reduction of religious feelings to everyday feelings, as Bronisiaw Malinowski does... it is just this supposedly scientific position which leads in a quite direct way to the creation of the most baneful metaphysics, since it is false to boot.19 While he agreed that magic and religion were important in the de velopment of the social structure, Witkiewicz insisted that "religious feelings" themselves existed in a sphere apart from "practical" consider ations. What he objected to in Malinowski was the latter's insistence upon the biological basis of religious beliefs and their "pragmatic" inter pretation?not the influence which such beliefs might have in the structure of society. There would be nothing in the nature of their basic philosophical disagreement, however, which would prevent the playwright from using material borrowed from Malinowski for his own purposes. On the contrary, it might have even proved to be an incentive. 18 Malinowski, "Magic, Science and Religion," in Magic, Science and Religion, p. 90. 19 Witkiewicz, Niemyte dusze.</page><page sequence="7">Witkiewicz and Malinowski 83 How familiar was Witkiewicz with Malinowski's work? Although nearly all of the noted anthropologist's important work was written after their friendship was broken off in 1914, Witkiewicz would scarcely have ignored the work of his former friend, no matter how severe the disagreements which separated them. A character based on Malinowski appears in Witkacy's autobiographical novel, The 622 Downfalls of Bungo; or the Demonic Woman (622 upadki Bunga: czyli Demoniczna kobieta, 1910/11) and mention is made of his work with those "seemingly savage people," the Papuans.20 And in the novel, Insatiability, written twenty years later there are two oblique but un mistakable references to Malinowski's application of psychoanalytical theory to the sexual practices in New Guinea.21 However, these are only passing references and indicate simply an interest in Malinowski's work with the Papuans. The most natural place to look for a reflection of his studies in New Guinea, however, would be in The Metaphysics of a Two-Headed Calf, as it is set in part in New Guinea and makes a point of comparing the Westerner and the savage. Here we immediately find a number of striking (and rather puzzling) similarities. Consider the following excerpts from Malinowski's Argonauts of the Western Pacific published in 1922: The main thing that struck me in connection with their [the Trobrianders] belief in the spirits of the dead, was that they are almost completely devoid of any fear of ghosts_All the fears and dreads of the natives are reserved for black magic, flying witches, malevolent disease-bringing beings, but above all for sorcerers and witches_ Disease, health, or death are... the result of magic or counter-magic_if a man sickens for any length of time,... then the evil forces are at work_ [When a person becomes ill] the services of some rival bwaga'u [sorcerer] are invoked (for the art of killing and curing is always in the same hand)... Except for the very light ailments which pass quickly and easily, all disease is attributed to sorcery.22 Ghosts and theoretical discussion about ghosts abound in The Meta physics of a Two-Headed Calf. And the presence of ghosts is treated 20Stanislaw Ignacy Witkiewicz, 622 Upadki Bunga, czyli Demoniczna kobieta (The 622 Downfalls of Bungo, or the Demonic Woman), Warsaw, Panstwowy In stytut Wydawniczy, 1972, p. 490. 21 Stanislaw Ignacy Witkiewicz, Nienasycenie (Insatiability), Warsaw, Panstwowy Instytut Wydawniczy^ 1957, Vol. I, 184, and Vol. II, 61.

(The Section of the book from which this and the following passages are taken is a summation of the religious beliefs of the natives, and stands in parenthetical relationship to the rest of the text. It is possible that Witkiewicz had seen this section of the manuscript or the notes on which it was based prior to publication.)</page><page sequence="8">84 The Polish Review with rather remarkable nonchalance by the other members of the cast But more striking are the observations regarding sorcery. Mikulini's "bacteria," like Rypmann's "glands," seem to be at least as much sorcery as they are science. In fact, the biologist Mikulini even admits that the witch doctor knows more about disease than he does.23 The play itself stresses the comparison between his "bacteriology" and witchcraft Like Malinowski's Trobrianders, who do not recognize the possibility of disease without magic, Mikulini declares that "there aren't any di seases without bacteria."24 Like the black magic of the natives, Miku lini's serum kills as well as cures. At one point he threatens to commit suicide by giving himself an injection, declaring that "it brings on the disease quite infallibly."25 The parallels between Mikulini's med icine and Trobriand sorcery do not stop there. Malinowski also tells us that: When a man has acquired the black art, he applies it to a first victim, and this has always to be someone of his own family... if a mans sorcery has to be any good, it must first be practiced on... any of his material kindred.26 This may strike us as being rather strange. But then so is Mikulini's insistence that in order for his serum to work, he had to use it first to kill a "white person,'* someone of his own race?who also happens to be his mistress!27 Again, in the Trobriands: All very rapid and violent diseases... are attributed to the mulukwausi.... they pounce upon a man or woman and remove and hide "the inside," that is, the lungs, heart and guts, or the brains and tongue 28 Sometimes these unlovely creatures will eat a person's insides on the spot, in which case no counter-magic can prevail. Can we help noticing that Lady Clay declares on her death-bed that the "Golden Frog" is eating away her brain?29 The Trobrianders regard all disease and most forms of death as being associated with magic, but there is a separate category of death: Only suicide and death in battle have a different place in the mind of the natives,... people killed in war, those that commit suicide, and those who are bewitched to death have, each class, their own way to the other world.30 23 Witkiewicz, The Metaphysics of a Two-Headed Calf, in Tropical Madness, p. 179. 24 Ibid., p. 183.

It is apparent that Witkiewicz has used his "source" in a very free and even bizarre manner?as he often does with ideas which he has borrowed. Malinowski carefully distinguishes between the various magical disease-producing agents which Witkiewicz has merged into the mysterious "Kala-Azar." Furthermore, Kala-Azar is associated with Aparura's totem?the "Golden Frog Kapa-Kapa." While the mother is presumably dying of Kala-Azar, she says that it is the "Golden Frog" which is eating away her brain. And at the same moment, Kala-Azar "himself" enters and is greeted as the "envoy of the Golden Frog."31 If we return to Malinowski, we find that there is one nonhuman cause of disease: and anthropomorphic creature which can, at will, assume the shape of man or reptile_you recognize him at once, for... he has as a rule a patch of some gaudy colour on his skin. It would be a fatal thing to kill such a reptile. On the contrary, it has to be taken up cautiously and treated as a chief.32 In other words, this reptile is treated somewhat like a totem animal. Although this creature is not a totem, Witkiewicz has used it to com plete the association of magic, sorcery and totemism. It might be urged that these similarities, while certainly striking, are simply the result of an unusual coincidence. Witkacy's plays are filled with all types of bizarre and seemingly incomprehensible incidents. These incidents and references in the play mentioned above do not (except for the association of magic and science) seem to be used in any logical or consistent way. The pattern of similarities, however, is too striking to be ignored The passages quoted above are all from a single short section in which Malinowski sums up the magico-religious be liefs of the Trobrianders. All of the native beliefs about serious di sease which he describes have parallels in the play. Secondly, we should not be too insistent in demanding logic and consistency from an author whose proclaimed purpose is to evoke a sense of the "mystery of exist ence' through a deliberate destruction of normal logic. This does not mean however that he used absurdities and bizarre incidents for their own sakes?something which he strongly condemned. If we take him at his word, then, we can only assume that some kind of rules or prin ciples are at work?and must try to discover what they are. 30 Malinowski, Argonauts, p. 78. 31 Witkiewicz, Metaphysics, p. 201. 32 Malinowski, Argonauts, p. 77.</page><page sequence="10">86 The Polish Review If we examine these aspects of the play closely, we find a kind of logic at work, but of a decidedly Witkacian variety. As we have seen, Witkiewicz regarded magic as a primitive form of religion which must, therefore, have had its origin in "metaphysical feelings/' It is not sur prising then that he would use such beliefs in a play meant to evoke such feelings. He would not attempt, of course, to explain those be liefs, but to extract those qualities which he felt would convey this sense of the strangeness of existence. Witkacy often works by a process of association through which ideas and events merge and change with out the benefit of causal relationships. The themes which Witkacy has borrowed from Malinowski?death and magic, the kinship of killing and curing, the murder-sacrifice of relatives, the incarnation of power ful and mysterious forces as humans or as animals, and death as an "eating away" of one's insides by strange forces?all converge at a single point?the mother's death?and are joined at that point to the concept of totemism through the association with Aparura's Golden Frog. Throughout the play totemism is posited as a general religious principle which is apparently superior to the more sophisticated notions held by the Europeans. In the mother's death scene totemism becomes linked to the mysterious forces of life and death which had been de veloped earier in the play. But why totemism? The concept of "mana," conceived of as a gen eral force which exists in all things, was known to many different peoples of the South Seas. As a kind of primitive metaphysical con cept relating all sorts of powers and forces it would seem a useful idea for Witkacy's purposes. Totemism, on the other hand, involves be liefs which relate the members of a specific clan or sub-clan to a specific class of nonhuman things?usually a species of animal. All members of the clan are the spiritual descendants of the totem. For this reason the totem becomes significant. It is intimately connected with beliefs about conception, reincarnation and kinship.33 Thus with its related and subordinate system of beliefs, it deals specifically with the question of existence. For the savage, totemism answers the questions: Who am I? How did I come to be here? What is my relation to my family and community? Is this not, however, a much narrower interpretation of the question of existence than Witkiewicz must have intended? He would certainly not have wished to limit it in quite the same way as totemism does. Yet as we examine more closely both the actual ex pression of Witkacy's "mystery of existence" and the specifics of Trob riand totemic beliefs, we shall find that they are more closely related than we might have imagined. 33 Bronisiaw Malinowski, The Family Among the Australian Aborigines, New York, Schocken Books, 1963, pp. 208-233.</page><page sequence="11">Witkiewicz and Malinowski 87 The beliefs of the Trobrianders are not dissimilar to those of the Australian tribes which Malinowski discusses in his first major work, The Family among the Australian Aborigines (1913). Briefly, the Trobrianders do not recognize the physiological basis of conception or pregnancy.34 They believe that a woman becomes pregnant when a "spkit-child'' has entered her body. This spirit-child, which is placed there by the ghost of one of her kinsmen or kinswomen, is also a mem ber of her clan. Thus the child is a reincarnation of one of her an cestors. Consequently, an individual's relation to his clan is defined, not by notions of consanguinity, but by a belief in reincarnation which relates all members of the clan. The relationship goes back ultimately, although in a less defined way, to the totem animal. Reincarnation does not take place immediately upon death, however. The spirit spends the intervening time on a nearby island where he lives a life not unlike that which he experienced before death, growing old, and finally "dying"?shedding his skin to become a spirit-child. Of course this meaning of totemism is not made explicit in the play Metaphysics of a Two-Headed Calf, but it seems to be implied by the context. When Patricianello muses over the question of who in fact his father really is, Aparura is indifferent to the question: "Does our Golden Frog know when and by whom the Boundless Distance des cends into her crossed thighs?"35 In the third act, in response to Mira bella's rhetorical question regarding the origin of that "atrocious mess/' the family, Aparura replies, "If it weren't for our totems and my Golden Frog Kapa-Kapa, your so-called civilization wouldn't exist"36 Totem ism is brought up again when Patricianello receives the second of the major shocks which are delivered to him by the mystery of existence? when he faints upon recognizing the similarity (or identity) of his "second" mother and Mirabella.37 Aparura is the only one who can face the mystery of existence with equanimity. When Patricianello asks him why it is not possible to know "why everything is the way it is, and not some other way," Aparura tells him: Even my Golden Frog Kapa-Kapa can't figure that out. He is what he is, and not something else; he is golden and not green. Find joy in that. They don't have any sense of the mystery, and they commit acts of madness so as to recapture that sense. Only you and I have it.38 34 The following discussion is based on Malinowski, "Baloma; the Spirits of the Dead in the Trobriand Islands," in Magic, Science and Religion, pp. 216-236. 35 Witkiewicz, Metaphysics, p. 183. p. 228. wibid., pp. 189-190. **lbid., p. 208.</page><page sequence="12">88 The Polish Review Patricianello may have gained a sense of the mystery, but he is un able to find joy. Earlier in the play he had been horrified at the thought of Mikulini as his father. It would have been better, he feels, not to have existed at all. When it is objected that he "had to exist somewhere, sometime/' he argues: You don't seem to realize that I could have not existed at all. So would I have had to accept my own existence even before I started to exist? Accept being incarnated in some accidental outer shell? Accept vulgar dualism? That's nonsense worthy of my friend, King Aparura. Unable to accept Aparura's totemism, Patricianello can only con tinue to be tormented by his awareness of the mystery, which he pays for by the destruction of all normal meaning in his life. Totemism represents here both awareness and acceptance of the mys tery of existence, and it provides a clue to better understanding of what mystery meant to Witkiewicz. Within the scope of a set of extremely simple religious beliefs, totemism encompasses and integrates the ques tions of death and continuity, and the relation of the individual to his family and society. The themes of death and reincarnation are inter twined throughout Witkacys plays with that of the individual's pre carious and terrifying relationships to the world around him. The in tegration and stability provided by primitive religion are gone. Man has become painfully and horribly aware of his isolation in the uni verse. But paradoxically, the more the cords that bind him are severed, setting him adrift and alone, the more they ensnare and enslave him. For Patricianello, questions of his relationship to his family arise only to dissolve into meaninglessness. Through the course of the play he sees his entire family murdered, only to be more tightly bound by it than ever at the end. Relationships shift madly into one another, becoming more binding even as they become more unreal. Patricia nello is isolated, but not alone; he is adrift, but not in a void. Lacking meaningful relationships, he exists in the midst of a chaos from which he cannot extract himself. Possibly Witkiewicz saw the integration and harmonizing of this discordant paradox in the simple beliefs of totemism. Wherever else it may lead, the awareness of one's isolation begins for Witkiewicz at the point where the sense of unity and kinship should be strongest? in the powerful bond and impassable gulf which exist simultaneously between child and parent. In this relationship the Witkacian hero first sees his loneliness: Despite all apparent bonds, he had fallen onto this earth from somewhere by chance (the most terrifying of chances, because it is unavoidable, there is the mystery) and no one was responsible for it, not even his mother and</page><page sequence="13">Witkiewicz and Malinowski 89 still less his father_He had an intuitive perception of the inability of the concept of causality to deal with existence.39 In The Water Hen, Tadzio literally drops to earth from somewhere and spends the play trying to discover bonds of kinship which forever elude him. His "father/' Edgar, has relationships thrust upon him, which, however tangible and restrictive they may be, are nonetheless artificial and unreal. In the Epilogue to The Mother, Leon discovers simultaneously his total dependence on his mother and his complete isolation from her. Precisely in the strongest ties Witkiewicz sees the greatest alienation. To a European mind, whose notions of kinship are based on the idea of consanguinity, the totemic beliefs would offer a curious parallel to this sense of kinship and isolation. Malinowski was fascinated by this aspect of primitive belief and tribal relationship. Beginning with his first major work in 1913, the anthropologist returns again and again to the question of kinship in societies that do not recognize the physiological basis of conception. "What kind of family can this be," he seems constantly to be asking, "in which the father is not related to his children?" For this is the situation that obtains in such a matri linear society as is found in the Trobriands and in many Australian tribes. The notion of a spirit-child which enters a woman's body almost by chance as she happens to wander too close to its hiding place would seem to destroy the very basis of the relationship between parent and child as the European understands it To him it would be the equivalent of dropping "onto this earth from somewhere by chance." The position of the father is especially strange to the European point of view because he ceases to be a father at all in our sense of the word, but merely the husband of the mother. The family unit still exists, yet the "normal" links between parents and children are either absent or severely weakened.40 In both Metaphysics of a Two-Headed Calf and in The Water Hen, one of the major themes or motifs is the destruction of the normal basis of family relationships. For Patricianello as well as for Tadzio, the question, "Why is He my papa and not someone else?," is central to the whole question of the mystery of existence.41 When Patricianello tries to dismiss the question in pragmatic terms ("Nobody's responsible for anything, only the person who believes that he's the father..., whether he actually is or not..he is chastised for this prosaic 89 Witkiewicz, Nienasycenie, Vol. I, 70. 40Malinowski denies as well the existence of ties based on social pressure or eco nomic ties.

Only the primitive or the child can find joy in them* The young Tadzio of the first act of The Water Hen is able, like Aparura, to accept and delight in the mysteries of life. But as he grows up and is absorbed into his materialistic society, he too finds only torment and alienation. He finally can justify his existence only by becoming an "unmitigated scoundrel." In The Water Hen the parent-child relationship, which like that in the primitive society, is stripped of its physiological basis, finds its justification in arbitrary social conventions and pressures. In The Meta physics of a Two-Headed Calf these relationships become a wild sur realistic parody of the family structure that actually exists in the Tro briand Islands. In that society the maternal uncle fills the authoritarian role reserved in Western society to the father. The uncle is responsible for a boys training and for teaching him his role and duties in the social structure. The father himself, because he is not technically re lated to his son, has little responsibility for him and is bound to him primarily by mutual affection. In effect, the roles of father and uncle are reversed.43 Patricianello's misfortune is to find himself in a bizarre version of this same situation. First he discovers that his "father'' is not really his father?is not actually related to him. The discovery that Mikulini, whom he despises, is actually his father, renders that relationship meaningless to him. Mikulini then takes over the role of father and the responsibility for Patricianello's upbringing. But Miku lini is not satisfied with just the role of father and insists on that of uncle as well.44 He figures, no doubt, by a particularly Witkacian logic, that by usurping the roles of father to each of the two cousins, he has thereby also become their uncle! The effect of this strange parody is, of course, to undermine the validity and even the reality of all the relationships. Witkiewicz's attitudes toward family relationships are, as we have seen, anything but simple. The family, which is the source of both the most profound feelings of isolation and the most compelling of bonds, is made up of reality and unreality in equal parts; it has a central place in Witkacy's own vision of the strangeness of life. Here the individual 42 Witkiewicz, Metaphysics, p. 183. 43 Malinowski, Sex and Repression, pp. 40-84. 44 Witkiewicz, Metaphysics, p. 228.</page><page sequence="15">Witkiewicz and Malinowski 91 first seeks union with the universe, and here he discovers his loneliness. It is hardly surprising that he found in these primitive beliefs and re lationships motifs which he used so effectively as a part of his Pure Form. "Totems," as Aparura confidently asserts, "are the truth," not, of course, in any objective sense, but because they express simply and directly the central problem of man's existence.45 The replacement of direct family ties with a belief in spiritual unity through the related beliefs of reincarnation and the return of the dead represents for Wit kacy the expression both of man's sense of isolation and his longing for unity. Pure Form was the means by which art was to be able to create those feelings which originally gave rise to both art and religion. It could not, Witkiewicz realized, simply do this by evoking old religious concepts or even by creating new myths. We are in a period in which those metaphysical feelings themselves are no longer relevant. To Witkacy, however, a world which denied such metaphysical feelings, which had no place in its intellectual equipment for the expression of such concepts, was one which denied an essential and inescapable part of its humanity. He saw the supreme expression of this spiritual dilemma of modern man in the concept of pragmatism, or more specifically, in that aspect of William James's philosophy which attempted to justify religious concepts in terms of their beneficial practical results. The attempt to establish the "truth" of such concepts by examining their "cash value" (in James's phrase), was to Witkiewicz the supreme ex pression of the absurdity to which modern man has brought himself. Devoid of true faith, he will yet believe for the sake of the biological comfort which belief brings him; but he will not recognize anything beyond its "practical" value. It is, in effect, twentieth-century man's attempt to have his spiritual cake and eat it In such plays as The Pragmatists (Pragmatysci, 1919) and The New Deliverance (Nowe wyzwolenie, 1920) Witkacy uses the techniques of Pure Form to show the anguish which results from the falseness of this position, and to portray the torment which results from man's denial of?or inability to accept?the paradox of his fundamental isolation and his inescapable unity with others and the universe. The empirical spirit of science?a cold and exacting goddess?has demanded allegiance as the only true faith. Her power, which is demonstrated to us everyday, cannot be denied or ignored. But like the ancient god of the Hebrews, she will tolerate no other gods, and leaves us without the intellectual equipment necessary to cope with something indefinably central to the human experience. Witkiewicz uses the pragmatic fallacy ^Ibid., p. 190.</page><page sequence="16">92 The Polish Review to point up and to illustrate the resulting void. In The Metaphysics of a Two-Headed Calf and The Water Hen he has developed fully the techniques with which he is able to move beyond the void and to explore through art that missing element. In these plays we see man trying and forever failing to come to grips with this elusive yet in eluctable mystery. The Water Hen may come closest, in Witkacian terms, to being a myth for modern times, to evoking the sense of this paradox through images which make up the life of modern men. For however much they may have differed on fundamentals, Witkiewicz seems to have realized the correctness of Malinowski's attempt to find the meaning of religious belief in the immediate experience of life. The difference lies in the fact that Malinowski, with his pragmatic, empir ical mind, simply stopped there, while Witkiewicz looked for something beyond. It is no accident that the playwright and novelist, who wished to evoke a sense of the mystery of existence, chose so often to do so in the context of family and society. While Patricianello, Edgar, and Tadzio seek to discover and under stand the mystery which surrounds them, Gyubal Wahazar attempts to transcend it He has created a world beyond pragmatism and reli gion; a high-tension and inherently unstable world held together only by the superhuman quality which enables him to accept his own isola tion even while directing the lives of everyone else. In Gyubal Wahazar the spiritual paradox of civilized man is formulated within the broad scope of the dynamics of society and power; it finds expression in the dialectic between absolute individualism and the mindless, unified mass?the social coefficients of plurality and unity. If civilization and culture began their long evolution with the emergence of the individual from the mass, Wahazar represents the limit point of the individual, the absolute extent of his development and the return to primal homo geneity. Wahazar has carried the doctrine of individuality to its ulti mate extreme and final absurdity. His program is self-contradictory and impossible. He first tells his subjects that his aim is to create a society of absolute individuality in which he will rase everyone to his own solitary, isolated uniqueness. Later he admits that "we've got to go beyond the individual?otherwise we won't create anything."46 His society of absolute individuals is in fact a society of automatons and mechanical mothers?humanity reduced to a mechanized anthill. His own supreme individuality?upon which his strength rests?is achieved at the cost of his own humanity. Apparently through a continuing act of sheer will he has transformed himself into the only possible superman: a super-madman who can create only by destroy ing. He has created his strength by severing all ties?even with his 46 Witkiewicz, Gyubal Wahazar, pp. Ill and 113.</page><page sequence="17">Witkiewicz and Malinowski 93 own past?becoming superhuman only by becoming less than human. It is a mistake, however, to regard Wahazar as a simple caricature of an insane dictator. His answer to the spiritual paradox?the at tempt to deny one-half of it through the sheer force of his will?has a certain ironic appeal, despite the madness and absurdity inherent in it, when it is compared to the coalition of forces which succeed him. Each has his own answer to the mystery of existence: Unguenty tries to dehydrate it into theological precepts which, despite his denials, sound rather suspiciously pragmatic; Morbidetto seeks refuge in "ab solute, metaphysical swinishness;"47 and Rypmann, the magician-sci entist, attempts to explain all mysteries away with pseudoseientific gibberish. The spiritual problem, like the problem of power with which it is linked, remains unresolved. In fact, Wahazar is the only one, other than the child Piggykins, who seems capable of directly experienc ing the mystery of existence?although he is destroyed in the process. We are hardly reassured when Father Unguenty?the moribund rem nant of ancient religious belief?is revived by injections from the dying god of individualism. "The mystery of existence" is a forbidding expression. It is highly tempting to pass over it lightly when dealing with Witkiewicz, in spite of his own insistence on its central importance. Yet beneath the ab stract concept are real?if exceptionally complex?perceptions about man's relationship with himself, his society and the world. We may excuse ourselves for not taking Witkacy seriously on the grounds that he never seems to take himself seriously. He will not take a position without simultaneously destroying it With indiscriminate irony the creator of Pure Form attacks his own beliefs as well as those which he abhors. This irony finally becomes his ultimate comment on the in tellectual and spiritual bankruptcy of our age. He realizes that such manufactured myths as he is creating cannot be regarded with the same seriousness as the myths and religious beliefs of former times. They must be destroyed even as they are created in order to provide us with a brief glimpse of that part of our society and our lives which modern intellectual advances have left us incapable of assimilating?or even comprehending.48 ^Ibid., p. 144. 48 Since this article was written, the first of two articles by Lech Paszkowski, "Ma linowski i Witkacy w Australii," has appeared in the London Wiadomosci, Nr. 1384, October, 1972, p. 2.
