<plain_text><page sequence="1">Psychology; Principles and Applications. By Thelburn L. Engle. New York, World Book Company, 1945. Pp. ix, 549. This book is written to fill "the growing demand for instruction in psychology at high school and junior college levels," assuming that "the 561</page><page sequence="2">562 BOOK REVIEWS majority of students will take no further formal courses in psychology." The author believes that "the students who may use this book will have many opportunities for studying and applying psychology; that their ad- vanced 'texts' will be magazine articles, radio programs, motion pictures, sermons, and lectures; that their psychological 'laboratories' will be the homes, the businesses, the clubs, and the communities in which they will function as citizens." The result is a cross between practically all the topics in a standard college text-book in psychology and material on mental hygiene served in the style of Reader's Digest. The author does not document the book with footnotes or references listing the sources of experiments summarized, upon which his conclusions are presumably based. As in articles written for popular consumption, key words are frequently not defined at all or are simply illustrated by means of an example, without further definition. This may result in easy reading for some students: it does not make for critical thinking. The words 'science,' 'scientific,' and 'experiments' are used in such a manner that the unwary reader is likely to get the impression that any one can do scientific work in psychology. The student is frequently urged to try an experiment, i.e., to observe, to gather data, and to use simple statistics. One is reminded of the 'scientific findings' frequently quoted in advertisements. Anthropomorphic explanations are sometimes given, e.g., the dog "was unable to decide whether to make the figure an ellipse or a circle; that is, he didn't know whether to make the required response or not," and the cat "escaped the box and enjoyed the fish." While stating in the foreword that "the scientific point of view has been emphasized and maintained," a moralistic tone is frequently used. Thus "we must be careful not to condemn too freely in our thoughts the person we know to be rationalizing," "Those who would pet or be petted ought not to delude themselves about the nature of the process," "we must help him (the nervous individual) to overcome his undesirable habits of thought," "the drug (marijuana) has many terrible effects," and "it is not always easy to find that which is admirable in others, but it is always there." A consistent point of view is not always maintained. On one page we are told that "if one is happy and efficient in his work he has succeeded, no matter what the nature of that work may be," while on the next page, it is alleged that "there is some scientific evidence that one's vocational suc- cess is more closely related to his general personality traits than to his intelligence," but success here is measured in terms of salary. Again, crime is defined as "any act that at the time of its commission is forbidden</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 563 and punishable by the laws of the social group," but the author does not make clear that all data purporting to show the causes of crime and delin- quency and the characteristics of criminals and delinquents are concerned not with all those who have acted in accordance with its definition, but only with those who have been convicted of crime or delinquency. In the foreword the author's aims include helping young persons to be more effective students; to distinguish between pseudo-scientific and scientific material; to apply the principles of mental hygiene consistently and completely; to develop what is best in their personalities; to use leisure time worthily; to realize their latent capacities; to select their life-vocations wisely, to be worthy members of their homes and families, and to prepare effectively to undertake responsibilities as citizens. While this reviewer applauds such ideals for high-school students, he is of the opinion that most of the aims cited fall outside the realm of science, and that there is no justification for leading the student to think that he will be able to realize them in psychology or in any other science. Chapter headings accord well with the moralistic tone of the book. Occidental College HILDING B. CARLSON</page></plain_text>
