NeuchAtel and Paris: Delachaux et Niestle, 1950. 173 pages. Fr. 6.50. The author of this timely publication is a licencid en tkhologie and a lecturer on the faculty of Protestant theology in Paris; with the present increasing emphasis on biblical theology, this book has great value for those interested in bib- lical studies. The volume is divided into three parts, of which the first discusses the anthropo- morphic expressions in the Old Testament; the second, attenuation or softening of anthropo- morphisms; and the third the original significa- tion of biblical anthropomorphism. Generally the author is careful not to confuse similes and metaphors with anthropomorphism. In his study of the corporeal attributes of God the writer notes that bdidr ("flesh") is never applied to God. Due consideration is given to panim ("face"), but the metaphorical sense with a preposition, a usage rather widespread in various languages, is rightly excluded. Other parts of the body which receive discussion are the hands, feet, arms, ear, mouth, voice, heart, nose (in connection with anger), and the en- trails (referring to compassion). Even though the Old Testament has numerous anthropomor- phisms, the biblical writers did not give God a body like that of man. From the corporeal at- tributes of God the author proceeds to the di- vine acts and deeds. In connection with ddbar ("word"), Michaeli points out that God speaks and then acts. Naturally the term "anthropo- morphism" is employed in a broad sense to in- clude anthropopathisms, which are treated in the chapter on the feelings and thought of God; of special importance in this connection are love, hesed, jealousy, repentance, pleasure and dis- pleasure, wrath, hatred, and knowledge. In the chapter on the titles and names of God, Baal (lord, possessor, whence husband) comes under conside ation. The references to Num. 3:13; 8:17; Lev. 27:26; Deut. 10: 14, however, are misleading, since the word "Baal" does not occur in these passages; Hos. 2:18 may be regarded as a protest against the use of Baal even in its etymological sense. It would have been well if the author had taken space to dis- cuss the origin and meaning of YHWH and to explain the pronunciation Adonay for the tetra- grammaton, the Jewish usage to avoid pro- nouncing God's name. The chapter on the resi- dence of God is interesting, but it is doubtful whether the ark was ever identified with YHWH. If it symbolized the presence of God, it would also signify that God could not be rep- resented by a visible image; at any rate, the idea of the covenant should eliminate the notion that the ark was "une representation materielle de Dieu." The tendency toward anti-anthropo- morphism is already present in the Hebrew Old Testament (e.g., in Ezek. 1:28b, where the prophet removes as far as possible a corporeal conception of God). The theological changes in the Septuagint and targums are occasionally re- ferred to, but obviously the author could not go into this extensive field of biblical studies. In Part II, "Attenuations ou spiritualisa- tions," chapter ii (pp. 82-99) is devoted to a study of texts on the basis of Old Testament documents and the development of theological thought. This is very well done and represents an admirable summary; it is unfortunate that such an important section of the book is printed in very small type. In the conclusion of Part II Michaeli speaks of rMction par contraste, under which he observes that the prophets who re- tained the anthropomorphic vocabulary used it without doubt rather in a metaphorical than in a real sense. He furthermore brings out that in the Hebrew writings of the Old Testament alle-</page><page sequence="2">CRITICAL REVIEWS 287 gory does not enter into the conception of God. In the third part of his work Michaeli marks a special characteristic of the Hebrew language, its use of concrete expressions and its dearth of abstract and philosophical terms. Accordingly with good reason he maintains that a knowledge of Hebrew is a necessity for understanding the teachings and the richness of the Old Testa- ment. God is not an abstraction or a philosophi- cal concept; he is a living God, and therefore he cannot be represented by any image. The author makes the contrast that the Bible moves in realism but philosophy in idiolism. A personal God, not an idea or an abstraction, can make a covenant with man. The fact that God is a liv- ing God gives the biblical anthropomorphisms a unique significance. The Incarnation could not have been understood without the anthropo- morphic presentation of God in the Old Testa- ment, and the book closes significantly with the sentence: "Dieu s'est fait homme en J6sus- Christ." The value of the book would have been enhanced if an index of words and Scripture ci- tations had been added. HENRY S. GEHMAN Princeton Theological Seminary</page></plain_text>
