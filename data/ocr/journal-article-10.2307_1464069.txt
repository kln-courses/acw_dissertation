LV/3 TRANSCENDENCE AND IMMANENCE CHIN-TAI KIM I Judaeo-Christian theology represents God as transcendent while Spinoza's metaphysics by contrast represents God as immanent. But transcendentist theology does not altogether abandon the idea of divine immanence, just as immanentist metaphysics does not com- pletely exclude that of divine transcendence. Christian theology, for example, introduces the notion of God's becoming immanent in the world by self-incarnation; Spinoza's metaphysics preserves the idea of divine transcendence by according substantiality exclusively to God and by representing God as not fully comprehensible to the finite human intellect. God and the finite beings in his metaphysics radically differ in status as beings and also as objects of knowledge. The ideas of transcendence and immanence are not mutually exclusive but mutually determinative. All theologies and metaphysical systems that posit an ultimate reality must show its double aspect as both transcendent and immanent, though some emphasize its tran- scendence, and others its immanence. This essay will explain such duality and explore its implications. II Two dimensions of transcendence suggest themselves, ontological and epistemological. Is "transcendent" a generic term, the meaning of which can be explicated in other words such as "absolute," "infi- nite," "necessary," and "self-caused"? Each of the latter has an oppo- site: "relative," "finite," "contingent," and "other-caused" or "dependent." Each of these putative cognates of "transcendent" sig- nifies a relation in more than the trivial sense that each negates its opposite, as, for example, "absolute" means "non-relative" and "infi- nite" means "non-finite." An absolute, infinite, and necessary being is Chin-Tai Kim is Professor of Philosophy at Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.</page><page sequence="2">538 Journal of the American Academy of Religion understood to be the ground of relative, finite, and contingent or dependent beings. The relationship between the transcendent and the beings it transcends is thus understood to be ontological as well as conceptual. But all of these would-be cognates of "transcendent" also can be, and have been, applied to an immanent ultimate being, so we must seek a meaning of "transcendent" that differentiates trans- cendentism and immanentism. There exists such a meaning: an ultimate being as conceived in transcendentism can be without the beings it transcends but not vice versa. On the other hand, an ultimate being as conceived in imma- nentism cannot be independently of the beings in which it is imma- nent, for they must be its manifestations or concretions. A distinction between the essence of the immanent ultimate and the manifestations of that essence is thought to be only ideal, not real. What differentiates transcendentism and immanentism thus is a radical asymmetry of dependence the former affirms but the latter denies between an ulti- mate being and the rest of reality. Such asymmetry is the ontological core of the meaning of the statement that God, a transcendent being, created the world, though the notion of creation no doubt has other connotations, notably the cosmogonical. The nature of the relation- ship between an ultimate ground and the grounded beings must accordingly have different explications in transcendentism and imma- nentism. Such notions as reason and cause that may figure in the expli- cation of "grounding" must be understood differently in the two frameworks. The statement that God is the sufficient reason for all things, for instance, must have radically different meanings in each position. Which sense or senses of "immanence" are germane to and even necessary for transcendentism, and why are they so? It might be said that the relatedness of the transcendent to the beings it transcends, conceptual and ontological, constitutes its immanence. Relatedness as such, however, is too weak a reason for saying that the transcendent is immanent in the beings it transcends, though no being, however ulti- mate, can be thought that is totally unrelated to any segment of reality accessible to us. The "in-ness" of the transcendent calls for a deeper interpretation. We might at this point turn to an epistemological dimension. It might be said that the transcendent, insofar as it is represented by an idea in a being that it transcends, insofar as it is an object for such a being, is immanent in that being. Though this suggestion certainly is more plausible than the foregoing, without refinement it implies that a perceived object in the world is immanent in the perceiver by virtue of being represented by his or her perceptual idea. Since the kind of</page><page sequence="3">Kim: Transcendence and Immanence 539 being whose immanence is in question is conceived as absolutely or at least maximally transcendent, which ordinary perceptible objects evi- dently are not, we must search for a special potentiated sense in which such a being can be said to be immanent. The rationalist tradition pro- vides a suggestion in this direction: the idea of the transcendent is a priori or innate, wholly independent of experience of objects in the world. A positive implication of this thesis is that the idea of the tran- scendent is implanted in a finite mind. Apart from the issue of the soundness of the ontological argument for God's existence, the assumption underlying it is noteworthy in this context: not only the idea of the transcendent but also the knowledge of its objective reality is innate in finite human subjectivity. The idea underlying the onto- logical argument thus contains a significant sense in which a transcen- dent God can be said to be immanent in us. Paul Tillich (3-13) interprets the ontological proof as a symbolic expression of the idea of the immanence of the transcendent ground of being. He contrasts the "ontological method," which is predicated on the idea of the imma- nence of the transcendent, with the "cosmological method," which recognizes the transcendent but fails to do justice to its immanence. There is another epistemological route to an explication of divine immanence. An aspect of the transcendent being's status as the ground of all other beings is that their essences are wholly determined by its ideas a priori: the transcendent is the essential cause of the beings it transcends. Kant's notion of intellectual intuition concerns such determination. According to Kant (B72), sense intuition of a finite sensuous being is an intuition of an object given to it; the nature of a sensibly intuited object, therefore, is at least in part determined by the object itself independently of the subject. On the other hand, intellectual intuition, the kind of intuition God alone can be thought to have, is a simultaneous predeterminative ideation and realization of an object; divine ideation is prior to, and independent of, the object ideated. Immanence suggests a shared nature. In the framework of trans- cendentist metaphysics human knowledge of things is possible pro- vided that God, the transcendent being, makes it possible for human ideas of things to agree with the divine ideas of them, though they may differ in that the former are a posteriori while the latter are a priori. In this framework truth consists in an agreement of human ideas with the divine; truth is adequatio ideae rei only by virtue of the fact that it is adequatio idea dei. If knowledge of truth in this sense is possible, its possibility would imply that God lets finite intelligent beings have a nature and power similar to God's own. It could moreover be said, as by Leibniz (77), that humanity shares certain a priori knowledge with God (e.g., of eternal truths), reinforcing the similarity between natures</page><page sequence="4">540 Journal of the American Academy of Religion human and divine. Given such similarity a finite intelligent being's self-knowledge would constitute an evidence for divine nature. The doctrine of analogy can be interpreted to be an implicit explication of divine immanence in a transcendentist framework. There have emerged at least two senses in which an ontologically transcendent being can be plausibly called immanent: (1) the tran- scendent is represented by an a priori idea of itself it implants in a created being; (2) it shares a nature with a creature insofar as the latter is capable of knowledge in general and a priori knowledge in particu- lar, including knowledge of divine reality. The locus of divine imma- nence in each of these senses must be a subject, not a mere object or substance, while an ultimate being in immanentism can be thought immanent in all other beings regardless of their specific ontological types. It is a truisim that no being can be conceived that cannot be described in any conceptual terms. "Transcendent" cannot mean "absolutely incapable of conceptualization." It is a term among terms that gain significance within an ontological framework; even the inar- ticulable surplus of its meaning, if any, presupposes its semantic core articulable in such a framework. This does not mean a wholesale rejec- tion of mysticism, however. "Mysticism" is an ambiguous name. It may name a simple factual view that there occur human experiences with certain unusual phenomenological features. Or it may name a view that not only affirms the occurrence of a certain type of experi- ence but also interprets its significance in theological or metaphysical terms. A theology or metaphysics may be enriched by considerations of mystical experiences, but this does not mean that it must be struc- turally sui generis to incorporate an interpretation of such exper- iences. "Mystical ontology" has no clear reference. Transcendentism and immanentism can subsume their own respective varieties of mys- ticism. "Mysticism" may also designate a view that affirms the occur- rence of a certain unusual type of experience but holds that its significance cannot be expressed at all in conceptual language. But there would have to be an explanation, in conceptual language, of why this should be so. Ironically, such explanation would be an adumbra- tion of the structured reality that mystical experiences are supposed to signify. This brief digression on mysticism is meant to point out that the admission of mystical experience as a fact has no special bearing upon the typological consideration of transcendentism and immanent- ism we are engaged in. Most of the thinkers in the Christian tradition would consider the senses of "immanence" described earlier relatively unimportant and ancillary. To most of them the crucial theme would be God's self-</page><page sequence="5">Kim: Transcendence and Immanence 541 immanentization in space, time, and history through self-incarnation. It is our interest here only to raise philosophical issues-issues about the nature and possibility, not about the fact, of incarnation. Christian theology strives to combine an idea of maximum contextually possible immanence with an idea of maximum ontological transcendence. God is wholly other, yet is also in space, time, and history. It would be too facile to say that divine omnipotence implies a power of self-incarna- tion. Even if omnipotence is assumed, there arises the question of what it is for God to become incarnate and how that is possible. We should understand such questions to be ontological, not biblico- exegetical. It would be foolhardy to attempt a full-fledged ontology of incar- nation here, but some observations are appropriate. The notion of incarnation is paradoxical. In becoming incarnate, in assuming forms of created being, the deity becomes for itself a being other than itself; the incarnating God is identical with, and at the same time different from, the incarnated God; the eternal, infinite, non-corporeal being is, and simultaneously is not, temporal, finite and corporeal. And God's spirituality is supposed to be a dialectical sublation of these opposi- tions. A dialectical interpretation of Incarnation thus seems to be the one that recommends itself the most. Hegel did not invent dialectic; he only developed a dialectical system. The idea of dialectic had prefigurations in traditions East and West. Hegel's dialectical ontology is a conceptual development or, better, an over-development of the Christian idea of divine self-incarnation (459, 475). Whether dialectic is a metaphor, a literal absurdity, or a significant metaphysic, is too large a question to handle here. But it must be treated in any ade- quate rational critique of the doctrine of incarnation, for the "person- ality" of the transcendent being as conceived in the Christian tradition-a theme much neglected by secular philosophers of reli- gion-seems to call for a dialectical interpretation. Soren Kierkegaard (505-506) trembles at the awesome absurdity of the immanence of the transcendent, refuses to comprehend it dialectically with Hegelian facility, and thus confirms at least the attraction of a dialectical under- standing of incarnation from the point of view of rationality. III Immanence no doubt comes in many forms as well. We shall con- sider some exemplifications to show that immanentism must retain some idea of transcendence. Heidegger tried to restore ontology to its rightful form from the many distortions it had suffered since Aristotle. Ontology for Heideg- ger is a quest for the meaning and truth of the being of entities, espe-</page><page sequence="6">542 Journal of the American Academy of Religion cially that of the being of the human, who alone among the entities is capable of understanding them. Being is not an entity or a being; rather, it is that which lets what is be, the ground of all entities. Theol- ogy cannot be an ontology as long as its theme is God considered as an entity. The ultimate question for Heidegger's ontology is: What is Being? Being as such is the being of all entities. His persistence in asking this question is paradoxical because ab initio the impossibility of answering it with a conceptual determination of Being is admitted (23- 24). The questioning really is intended to lead us to a limit of thinking, and beyond, into a region of experience of a special kind. Being is to be experienced to be understood. But to experience Being is to expe- rience the entities in a special way-as "beings in Being": "Let us note well-eon emmenai, the presence of what is present, and not what is present as such and not Being as such, nor both added together in a synthesis, but: rather duality, emerging from their unity kept hidden" (242). A special form of subjectivity, authenticity, is the correlate of Being. Heidegger hopes to revive the ancient Greek wonder (thauma) at the being of entities qua beings. To experience being is to wonder at any and every entity insofar as it is. Aside from the poetic and emotive aspect of Heidegger's ontol- ogy, his is an immanentist metaphysics. Being, again, is not an entity, not even a divine entity; it is the being of entities. If Being is divine and holy (what else could be holy in Heidegger's metaphysics?), then it is, accurately speaking, the entities or the realm of entities that is divine, for Being is adjectival to entities. Much like the Tao of Chinese philosophy and the Logos of Heraclitus, Heidegger's Being is the prin- ciple that lets what is be and be what and how it is. Whitehead's God, "the Principle of Concretion," is similar: it is the principle that, "irra- tionally," realizes precisely this concrete fact-world (174, 178). Any religious attitude toward Being is one toward the entities insofar as they are. Immanentism of this kind accords an epistemological form of tran- scendence to the immanent ultimate reality. Being is knowable in some respects but unknowable in others. It is knowable as the princi- ple that lets the entities be and be what and how they are in all their concrete specificity and relations, so that, in a way, a theoretical com- prehension of the system of entities is a concrete knowledge of Being; it is unknowable, however, in that there is no possible theoretical explanation of why Being lets precisely these entities be and be pre- cisely what and how they actually are. Being is presupposed by, but transcends, knowledge of entities. Such knowledge only heightens the mystery of their being. Being reveals itself through human subjectiv- ity yet at the same time conceals itself from it. Thinking reaches up to</page><page sequence="7">Kim: Transcendence and Immanence 543 Being; beyond this there should only be silent acceptance and appreciation. Spinoza's immanentist metaphysics exhibits a similar feature. God is the world, the totality of entities in their infinite concrete specificity and relations. The notion of immanence reaches a limit in Spinoza's metaphysics in the form of identity. True enough, finite entites in the world, as divine modes, are transcended by God, the only substance. But this notion of transcendence is of no crucial importance in his immanentist framework because the key question here is whether God transcends the world as a whole. On the other hand, Spinoza accords God at least two epistemological forms of transcendence: only two of the infinitely many attributes of God, the intellectually discerni- ble categories of the ways in which God expresses God's power of self- realization and self-concretion, are knowable to the finite human intel- lect, namely, Thought and Extension; moreover, God's being what God is and how God is, is beyond comprehension (Part IV, Preface). There is no "sufficient reason" for the facticity of the deity or the world. A hidden irony lurks in Spinoza's thesis that whatever is actual is necessary and whatever is not actual is impossible, for the necessary actuality is the mysterious ultimate facticity (Part I, Prop. xii). Nietzsche's identity as a metaphysician is ambiguous. Leaving aside the rather complex exegetical issue of whether or not he intended to settle in a definite metaphysical position, or if he even can rightly be viewed as a systematic metaphysician at all, he expressed a wealth of metaphysical ideas, of which that of will to power is the piv- otal one. If we treat Nietzsche at least as a crypto-metaphysician, his key thesis is that being essentially is will to power. Such will manifests itself in Zarathustra's will to self-transcendence and creativity as well as in the ressentiment of the weak and the cultural artifices they con- struct as defenses (366, 399). The nature of will to power, however, lies hidden behind all its historical, cultural, psychological, and physi- cal manifestations. We know that, and how, but cannot know why, it manifests itself in the way it does. In this sense will is transcendent. Nietzsche is widely known as an anti-Christian. But there is more than meets the eye in his invective against Christianity. He is struggling against the yoke of a belief in transcendent reality that the millenia of Western history have rigidified. But his general metaphysical point is against the positing of any transcendent reality. His metaphysical pro- gram is aimed at a recovery of nature as a self-contained and self-suffi- cient whole, absolutized in the idea of eternal recurrence, and of human nature as a potentially non-distorting medium of nature's self- expression. "To impose upon becoming the character of being-that is the supreme will to power. . .That everything recurs is the closest approximation of a world of becoming to a world ofbeing..." (330).</page><page sequence="8">544 Journal of the American Academy of Religion The self-transcendence Zarathustra cries for, metaphysically under- stood, is a realization of nature's immanent ultimacy and identification therewith. The slogan "God is dead" signals the demise of the tran- scendent as such. The metaphysics Nietzsche intimates is one of immanence-that of will to power in nature, which explains but is hid- den behind the phenomena of nature and history (549-550). IV A contrast of the way the problem of evil is handled in a trans- cendentist framework and the way it is handled in an immanentist framework further illuminates their structural difference. In the for- mer the problem assumes the following general form: How can an omnipotent and absolutely benevolent deity create a world that is less than perfect? This question presupposes that unjustifiable suffering is evil, that there is evil in the world, and that the presence of evil in the world is an evidence of its imperfection, hence of its creator. The problem has given rise to a whole gamut of theodicies, from the ration- alist extreme of asserting, as Leibniz did, that God, a priori, is perfect, that the world God created, a priori, is the best of all possible worlds, hence that there is no evil, in that sense, in the world (187), to the other extreme of avowing in despair, as Job did, the incomprehensibil- ity of God's way with the world. The problem of evil is here conceived as one of justifying the choice of an anthropomorphically conceived deity against criteria of human origins. It is assumed by all trans- cendentists, except perhaps the Joban despairers, that such criteria, insofar as they are rational, are applicable to God, who created human- ity rational in God's own image. The problem must assume a different form in an immanentist framework. The world of nature is not an anthropomorphic being that makes choices; it is. The intellectual problem about suffering becomes one of explanation, not of justification. Human obsession with a justifi- cation of suffering, from the point of view of immanentism, should itself become a problem, a solution to which would be what might be called a homidicy-a justification of humanity's way with nature. Humanity is in nature but often is tempted by nature's own guile or by human vanity and limited perspective to conceive itself as not being of nature entirely. Humanity's centrifugal flight from nature would have to be explained and explained away in natural terms. Spinoza and Nietzsche provide good examples of the attempt to dissolve the prob- lem of evil. In Spinoza the popular ethical categories of good and evil, being expressions of subjective approval and aversion, do not have objective validity; neither of the two categories has application to God or Nature. Nietzsche's treatment of good and evil is subtler. God and</page><page sequence="9">Kim: Transcendence and Immanence 545 evil are the human inversions of the values that nature primordially prescribes, strength and weakness. The inversion occurs through the mechanism of ressentiment, the defensive reaction of humanity to its sense of impotence and fear of the strong. The problem of evil, from Nietzsche's point of view, is a problem only in the context of human- ity's false consciousness. The transvaluation of the values of good and evil will achieve, among other things, the dissolution of the problem of evil that has presuppositions without ontological validity. V Why is it that transcendentist metaphysical structure must pre- serve some idea of immanence, and immanentist metaphysical struc- ture some idea of transcendence? This question cannot be adequately answered by a citation of historical exemplifications of such structures and should be treated as a philosophical one. A third idea that is related to both transcendence and immanence would help to answer it. An ultimate being, pre-analytically, is something that is uncondi- tioned and conditions everything else. Kant tried to give an a priori genealogy of the idea of God as the unconditioned ground of all pos- sibilities and actualities (A580, B608). In doing so in the confines of his architectonic, Kant was trying to legitimate, to a limited degree, a clus- ter of metaphysico-theological ideas such as causa sui, ens realissimum, ens entium, the absolute, the infinite, and the primordial-to a limited degree because, while trying to certify their subjective-transcendental origin, he was showing the illegitimacy of their objective, theoretical employment. He further attempted to give the idea a transcendentist monotheistic interpretation, and drew support from his independently established transcendental idealism. Metaphysical or theological notions of ultimate being are so many explications of the already existing and operative idea of an absolute unconditioned ground of conditioned beings, which, without further conceptual explication, remains incompletely determined. Transcen- dence and immanence are the two fundamental polar modalities for the explication of this idea. Both transcendence and immanence are relational notions that relate the ground to the grounded beings. If the unconditioned ground is interpreted to be ontologically transcen- dent to the grounded beings, there arises a task of explicating their relationship that overcomes their chorismos. The region of such rela- tionship is the region of the ground's immanence in the grounded beings. If, on the other hand, the unconditioned ground is interpreted to be ontologically immanent in the grounded beings, their relation- ship is secured, but the unconditioned status of the ground must be restored. A suitable notion of transcendence must be re-introduced to</page><page sequence="10">546 Journal of the American Academy of Religion preserve the ontological dignity of the unconditioned ground. Tran- scendence and immanence thus defy separation; they exist in a tension in any reflective conception of ultimate reality. Without exaggeration, the best religious and metaphysical thought has concerned the struc- ture of this tension; how such structure is understood has weighty implications for humanity's existential self-understanding and com- portment in the world. It has been said that humanity is homo religiosus and homo metaphysicus. This at least should mean that humanity has a need for a religion or metaphysics. We are not identifying religion, theology, and metaphysics. Theology arises as an attempt to interpret concep- tually and organize coherently the doxatic components of religion. It cannot achieve this end without becoming metaphysical: it must include an ontology, a cosmology, and a theory of human nature at the least. Since there are non-theistic religions such as Buddhism in which the idea of deity plays no role or little role, we might speak, less mis- leadingly, of philosophical or philosophized religion rather than of the- ology. Metaphysics, on the other hand, is independent of religion and theology in both genesis and content while metaphysical ideas must be implicit in religion and explicitly employed in theology. The structure of a metaphysical system thus also determines at least partially the structures of associated religions and theologies. Humanity ideates the unconditioned being either in concepts or in symbols and is motivated by the idea. Kant identified such need with reason's natural disposi- tion. And if Kant were right in his account of the "ideal of pure rea- son," transcendentist monotheism would be the only legitimate religious, theological, or metaphysical form. The histories of religions, theologies, and metaphysics, however, show too great a structural vari- ety to let Kant's structural absolutism appear plausible. Nor is a trans- cendentist or immanentist interpretation of the unconditioned logically necessary. Moreover, after Nietzsche, Freud, and Jung, Kant's thesis that humanity's religious need has a purely rational origin is naive. The present age is skeptical even about the allegedly pure rational motivation of cognitive activity in general. It would be saner to expect, with open mind, a complexity of motivations and structures of religion, theology, metaphysical speculation, and even mundane cognition. Transcendentism and immanentism are two ideal types of specu- lation about ultimate reality, with rich variations of course and inter- mediary types in between. "Transcendent" and "immanent" are two "root metaphors" of ultimate reality that receive different interpreta- tions and different speculative structures. Examples of transcendent- ism and immanentism could be refined sufficiently to meet internal evaluative criteria of consistency and coherence. External evaluative</page><page sequence="11">Kim: Transcendence and Immanence 547 criteria such as comprehensiveness, agreement with an accepted body of empirical facts, satisfaction of select psychological needs considered relevant and paramount, adequacy as a foundation of morality, and the like, also could not dogmatically be said to be satisfiable by one type but not by the other. It is wrong to believe that there is a culture- independent human nature that yields a single universally valid struc- ture for speculation. On the contrary, structures of religion, metaphys- ical thought, and morality are determined in significant measure by cultural forms and contents. It would therefore be naive to believe, for instance, that a religion, a theology, or a metaphysics could be objectively evaluated by a moral criterion characteristic of a culture. Evaluation, ultimately, expresses a commitment to the form of specu- lation and the attendant form of life from whose point of view it is made. The duality of transcendence and immanence as two modes of the unconditioned has methodological implications. Philosophy of reli- gion, especially such as is practiced in the analytical circles, has suf- fered from too narrow a perspective. It has been confined almost exclusively to analysis and criticism of concepts, doctrines, and argu- ments that occur within a transcendentist metaphysical framework usually to the exclusion of the "revealed" components. Though such intellectual enterprise no doubt generates clarity in that specific region, it does not generate an understanding of the structure of the region as a whole. Such understanding is possible only in the context of a critique of the comprehensive structure of speculative possibili- ties, of which transcendentism is only one. Such considerations as these should leave us unsettled. The state of being unsettled on such matters must be accepted as an aspect of the human condition. Instead of vainly hoping to resolve such matters conclusively, we should hope for an ongoing conversation with a mod- est aim of gaining more clarity on differences that matter and of perceiving significant convergences, analogies, and similarities. Dog- matism should yield to critical dialogue, the goal of which should be to bring into perspective optional modes of human thinking and exisiting that cultures have exemplified and to keep thinking about them. Such thinking would at least shed light on the structural complexity of the spiritual interiority of species homo if not on the ultimate constitution of reality. The positivist attack upon speculation has subsided with a rather inconclusive result: speculation has not been eradicated as the positivists hoped, nor is there a sign of its full-blown resurgence. But whatever skepticism about speculation that may pervade the present intellectual climate would be consistent with meta-metaphysical reflections. Human thought, perhaps, has essayed most of the possible forms of speculation if it has not exhausted them. Theoretical under-</page><page sequence="12">548 Journal of the American Academy of Religion standing of the forms of speculation is more reflective than immersion in speculation and more appropriate in an inhibited time like ours. Such understanding would have to be a background for any future speculative venture if any. "Meta-metaphysics" needs yet to be clearly defined, however. Since philosophy should rightly be its own reflection among other things, meta-metaphysics would surely be a part of philosophy. But such reflection should also involve appropriations of resources of other disciplines. Philosophy describes optional conceptual structures for an ontology of the ultimate, and thus aspires to determining a universal structure of possible structures, but it is not within its special compe- tence to explain the psycho-historical genesis of lived examples. Such explanation would have to be provided in the context of a mutually interpretive collaboration among an assortment of disciplines includ- ing philosophy, history of religion, psychology and phenomenology of religion, and anthropology, to mention a few. The old parochial pic- ture of philosophy as a self-sufficient comprehension of reality should be discarded. Disciplines could be mirrors of one another as well as their own-mirrors with characteristic refractions. A composite of the many images might have blurred contours but might be closer to the truth. A maximal reflectivity of human thought, if any such is possible, must consist in a synthesis, or more modestly, an attempt at a synthe- sis, of fragmentary disciplinary visions.
