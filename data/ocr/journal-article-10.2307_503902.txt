University of California Press, Berkeley, I974. $20. In recent years high chronologies based on the dendro-chronological calibration of C14 dates have thrust the Neolithic and Chalcolithic cultures of south- east Europe into prominence, and in this book Prof. Gimbutas attempts to identify and demonstrate the persistent influence of the early religious traditions of "Old Europe," the name she proposes for a large culture area stretching from Poland to the Adriatic. With five sub-regions-Aegean and Central Balkan; Adriatic; Middle Danube; East Balkan; and Moldavi- an-West Ukrainian-Old Europe is presented as the home of an autochthonous civilization which be- tween 7000 and 3500 B.C. advanced to high levels of technological competence and social and religious organization. The cosmogonical and cosmological sym- bolism and the sophisticated pantheon of the Old Eu- ropean agriculturalists are reconstructed by the au- thor from the rich and often bizarre repertory of figurines, zoomorphic and anthropomorphic vessels, and elaborately decorated pots found in settlements, shrines, and cemeteries, and the claim is made that aspects of this religious tradition which survived the destruction of the Old European civilization by the Indo-Europeans can be traced through the Bronze Age, especially in Crete, into the Classical era. Considerations of the form, provenience and ac- coutrements of divinity precede the identification and description of the specific gods and goddesses. The schematization which dominates in the rep- resentations is attributed by Prof. Gimbutas to the early artists' efforts to express symbolically the super- natural forces which they believed lay behind the chaos of nature, and she interprets the often non- realistic heads in terms of the ritual mask. The pres- ence of the mask and the elaborate costume of the figures, she believes, are strong evidence that they represent gods and goddesses, worshippers or priests, participants in ritual drama. Shrine models, cult places, and votive offerings are described, the last identified by inscriptions in the undeciphered signs of the Linear Old European script of the Tirtaria tablets. Isolated by Prof. Gimbutas as the dominant deities of her Old European pantheon are: the Mistress of Waters; the Great Goddess of Life, Death and Re-</page><page sequence="2">1975] BOOK REVIEWS 157 generation; the Pregnant Vegetation Goddess; and the Year-God. As Mistress of Waters the feminine principle ap- pears as the Bird and Snake Goddess, generally rep- resented with female buttocks in the shape of a bird's body, female breasts, wings or arm stumps, and a bird's beak on a long phallic or snakelike neck. Trans- formed in the Chalcolithic period into a vase with a birdlike mask or an elaborately dressed masked woman she survives in the bird and snake imagery of the Minoan-Mycenaean tradition and in aspects of the cults of Athena, Aphrodite, and Hera. Representative of both the beneficent and destruc- tive powers of nature, the Great Goddess, corpulent, androgynous with phallus-shaped head, can be dis- tinguished from Lady Bird by the position of her arms, folded with hands on the breasts, and in the fifth and fourth millennia she is often represented in a rigid chrysalid pose. With epiphanies as dog, doe, toad, turtle and hedgehog, bee, butterfly and bear, this multiform goddess can be seen in later times as Hekate-Artemis. Unlike the Bird and Great Goddesses who inherited a corpus of pre-agrarian symbolism, the Pregnant Vegetation Goddess was a creation of the Neolithic agriculturalists. Frequently portrayed naturalistically with her hands above her pregnant belly, she can also be identified by her symbol, the dot in a lozenge, the seed in the sown field. Her animal, the pig, provides a link with Demeter. The male stimulating principle, a prototypic Diony- sos, appears as an ithyphallic masked man or human- masked animal, or as the phallus alone. In other as- pects he is seen as the old year-god or god of death and the child-god. I strongly disagree with the thesis of this book, find its methodology faulty and note errors in the docu- mentation. That the majority of the objects presented here had some special meaning for their makers is not the point at issue. But to encapsulate them in a rigid scheme of goddesses and gods is a restricted view which does in- justice to the creative imagination of the early agri- culturalists and ignores other relationships which must have been important to them. Colin Renfrew has re- cently made a more modest proposal: "Ethnographic parallels suggest a very wide range of possible func- tions for such images ... to try, on present evidence, to invest them with any specific meaning-to identify them, for instance, as representing the Great Earth Mother, favored by an earlier generation of archaeolo- gists-would be incautious. Yet I think we can regard them as reflecting beliefs, and probably activities, cen- tring upon entities which, if not necessarily super- human (in the sense of deities), were at least supra- human, relating, that is, to groups of men-age grades, brotherhoods or associations--or to tribal units and divisions" (Before Civilization, p. i8o). While claiming all of Old Europe for her deities, Prof. Gimbutas demonstrates her thesis very selec- tively. Some twenty percent of the 423 documentary illustrations are of objects from Vin'a or Vin'a-related sites. So the discussion of the ritual mask is based almost exclusively on Vin'a material, since it is less schematic, we are told, and easier to interpret. Em- phatic statement replaces reasoned argumentation, and alternatives are not explored. For example, steatopygy is cursorily dismissed as a "false interpretation," and we are informed that the full-buttocked females rep- resent a fusion of human and waterbird forms, the latter rounded to resemble the primordial egg of which it is the creator (p. io6). There are errors of fact, at least on the Greek side, where I am most familiar with the material. The well- known figurine from Lerna is erroneously dated to the Late Neolithic period, although its Middle Neo- lithic date is common knowledge (e.g. CAH I.I3, p. 596). The excavator of the Kea figures does not claim "snake collars and belts" for his ladies (p. 228), only garlands and girdles (v. Hesperia XXXIII [1964] 329-31). The bibliographical entries display a lack of precision and lack of attention to detail: e.g. El- liot for Eliot, Tsountas cited between Todorovid and Tompa on p. 267 and as the author of Prehistoric Thes- saly on p. 285. From a scholar of Prof. Gimbutas's stature we should have received something better. ELIZABETH COURTNEY BANKS UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS</page></plain_text>
