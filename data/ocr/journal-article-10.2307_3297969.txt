<plain_text><page sequence="1">LUCRETIAN REVISIONS OF HOMER It is not surprising that Lucretius imitates Homer far less frequently than does Ennius or Virgil;1 his epic of rational thought and its call to contemplation differ too radically in tone and content from Homer's to benefit from close ties to the latter's god-ridden and action-oriented world. Nevertheless, a close comparison of the relative- ly few Lucretian adaptations of Homeric passages with their Greek model provides a valuable window into Lucretius' artistry. Because these Homeric imitations occur in a variety of contexts, and not just in the conspicuous and purple passages, they provide clear corroboration for E. J. Kenney's assertion that "a thorough examination of Lucretius' style ... would show that the poet and craftsman is consistently in evidence throughout the entire poem."2 Lucretius will be seen to incorporate another poetic text into his own poem with a careful artistry engaged not only in rendering Greek verse into Latin verse, but in rendering Homeric poetry into terms suitable for Epicurean philosophy. In this paper I will first review six passages in Lucretius that have a clear Homeric model. Although all of them are in some sense revision- ist, tailored to their new context in De Rerum Natura, they range from a very limited engagement of their Homeric context to a clearly polemical correction of it, and I will consider them in that order. Such 'Other than the six passages discussed in this paper, Lucretian imitations of Homeric passages are limited to isolated phrases and words. In some of these cases it becomes difficult to determine if Lucretius is working with a text of Homer or inheriting Homer only indirectly through Ennius, who had already accomplished extensive appropriations of Homeric style in the Anna- les. Lucretius' suaviloquenti (1.945), for instance, a compound closely rendering Homer's i186uEn;l, appears in the Annales, and is probably one of the many epic mannerisms that Lucretius inherited through his Latin predecessor rather than from Homer. It would be an interesting but substantially different study to discuss the extent and function of formulaic language in Lucretius. On this see W. S. Maguinness, "The Language of Lucretius," in Lucretius, ed. D. R. Dudley (London 1965) 73-74, and J. D. Minyard, Mode and Value in the De Rerum Natura: A Study in Lucretius' Metrical Language (Wiesbaden 1978). 2 E. J. Kenney, "Doctus Lucretius," Mnemosyne 4.23 (1970) 391.

It will also serve to characterize the Epicurean poet's relation to Homer and the poetic tradition in general. The paper will close with some remarks that relate Lucretius' style of imitation to Virgil's, distinguishing the latter's complexity of reference from Lucretius' more limited and defined manner of engaging another literary text, a manner shown to be determined by the didactic nature of De Rerum Natura. In the following imitation, Lucretius is in the midst of explaining how the vigorous motions of atoms can escape our notice, and provides the analogy of troop maneuvers, whose motion cannot be seen from a distance. He borrows from Homer a scene to depict the tumultuous action close up: fulgor ubi ad caelum se tollit totaque circum aere renidescit tellus subterque virum vi excitur pedibus sonitus.... (2.325-27) Munro writes that "Lucretius had more than one passage of Homer in his mind," and he quotes three of them while citing a fourth.4 The limited sense in which this is true will be considered in a moment. Verbally, however, the Latin shows close allegiance to only one of these descriptions of troop movements: a'iyr l 8' o15pabvv ice, yfhooe 6 ,i o a nep XiOv yXaKoI C l- onzeTpoit"; -07Ob 6~ KTin og i6tpIvE nooov &amp;v6pv*v (Il. 19.362-64) Lucretius follows Homer in his overall articulation of the material into three phrases which are connected in Homer by the postpositive 68 ... 6e, and in Lucretius by the similar-que... -que. The Latin also renders each of the original's images in order. Although Lucretius takes some 3 have used the text of C. Bailey, Titi Lucreti Cari De Rerum Natura (Oxford 1947). 4 H. A. J.

The adverbs circum and subterque also parallel the positions of nepi and bUn7 in the Greek, and tota tellus parallels Ra&amp;oa XO Ov. Renidescit, with a base (renideo) that means both "to shine" and "to smile," nicely renders Homer's verb yXaacce, which is also a fusion of the two notions and originally meant "to shine."5 In adding the periph- rasis virum vi, Lucretius alters the syntax of the last phrase somewhat, but this is patterned on a general Homeric usage (Pia plus geni- tive), and not on any wording in the other passages cited by Munro. It is interesting to note, especially for purposes of comparison with Virgil later in my discussion, what Lucretius does with the context of the imitated passage. In the Iliad, the description of troop movements in 19.362-64 precedes the long-awaited return of Achilles to battle. Homer's passage, in fact, continues with a description of the furious warrior as he arms himself. But it is doubtful that the reader need know this context to appreciate fully Lucretius' art; nothing is gained by a specific connection with Achilles and his return. On the other hand, the mock maneuvers in Lucretius do acquire some descriptive power by a general association with Homeric warfare. As Munro's other citations indicate, Lucretius, although sticking closely to one particular passage, has nonetheless imitated a type-scene, one that his readers could easily recognize as Homeric. Other features of Lucretius's description of the mock-maneuvers are decidedly Roman rather than Homeric-the le- gions, for instance (323), and the coordinated cavalry attack (329). What Lucretius has done, then, in the interest of rendering his thought- experiment vivid for his readers, is to utilize their memories of both common experience ("the scene may be imagined as taking place again in the Campus Martius," writes Bailey, 856) and a literary text. By conjuring up Homeric warfare, with its frequent focus on individuals and its action without distance, Lucretius in effect gives the spectator of the maneuvers a close-up lens to place him in the midst of the violent motion, before drawing back for the distant view from the hillside (331- 32) that renders motion invisible and represents our perception of atomic movement.6 5 See N. J. Richardson's note to line 14 of The Homeric Hymn to Demeter (Oxford 1974). 6 The closest Lucretius comes to criticism of Homer in this imitation is perhaps the deflation of military might involved in the analogy of atomic motion. Earlier in Book 2 Lucretius, with some phrases that have an echo in the troop maneuvers (cf. Bailey 856-57), scorned vast armies for their impo-</page><page sequence="4">142 PETER J. AICHER As will be seen, a constant characteristic of Lucretius' imitations is their verbal, as well as thematic, integration into their new context. In this case, fulgor, the first word of the imitation, reappears as the last word of the larger description (332), thus framing the illustration, and incorporating the imitation of the Greek text into the wider picture.7 In Book 6 of D.R.N., as part of his program to demythologize the skies, Lucretius provides several naturalistic explanations for the causes of thunder; in the one employing Homer, he describes how noise is created when a bolt of lightning from one cloud suddenly strikes another cloud that has more moisture: fit quoque, ubi e nubi in nubem vis incidit ardens fulminis; haec multo si forte umore recepit ignem, continuo magno clamore trucidat; ut calidis candens ferrum e fomacibus olim stridit, ubi in gelidum propere demersimus imbrem. (6.145-49) The analogy from the forge in the last two lines of the passage looks to Homer's simile describing the noise made by the glowing stake that Odysseus and his men twist into Polyphemus' eye: Wq 8 01C cXV71p Xahicebg Rc'XFEDV [teyav "Ile nWelaaov papg6ocov " -b yop a(XtE ftl6TlpO- y 7p KPtoo ;E e(tv (Od. 9.391-93) tence in ridding anyone of the fears that plague mankind (2.39-46); the reader is thus prepared for criticism. The Homeric imitation is also linked on equal terms with an immediately preceding analogy that describes sheep playing on a distant hillside (2.317-22). The warfare so central to the Iliad is thus relegated to an illustration of atomic physics, and is of the same usefulness as a flock of lambs. On the other hand, what in Lucretius' world is not relegated to an illustration of Epicurean theory? In its specific Lucretian context the Homeric imitation serves primarily as an illustration of reality, and not of delusion or false values. As P. De Lacy argues in "Distant Views: The Imagery of Lucretius 2," CJ 60 (1964) 49-55, Lucretius builds up a series of associations in which literal and metaphorical distant views represent the life of contemplation and peace; I would argue that the description of troop-maneuvers diverges from this scheme, since it is the close-up view that in this instance gives the needed perspective. "Guissani notes that [fulgor] corresponds as the last word of the descrip- tion with fulgor at the beginning of 325," Bailey 857.</page><page sequence="5">LUCRETIAN REVISIONS OF HOMER 143 At the heart of each poet's simile is the sound that incandescent metal makes when immersed (stridit and idtXovT). Both poets are also perhaps interested in the onomatopoeic sounds of demersimus and (papgdaom0v. There are some characteristic differences as well. Homer is circumstan- tially thorough in his simile; he identifies the tool-"an ax, or an adze"-and glosses the act of tempering the metal with its purpose: "for this is what gives the iron its strength." Details are included that are not immediately relevant to the thing compared. Lucretius trims some of the detail, shows a greater interest in sound effects, and puts a point on Homer's implied antithesis between hot and cold by adding calidis to counter gelidum (y-UXP). All three differences (streamlined similes, prominent sound effects, and antithetical emphasis) are noticeable in many Latin verse imitations of a Greek model, and can be called characteristically Roman.8 The sharpened antithesis, however, also serves its new scientific context. Although Homer's simile is from a scientific viewpoint as apt as Lucretius' in illustrating the cause of the noise in the narrative, in Homer it is not the cause but the dramatic and gory effect that is uppermost. Lucretius will primarily illustrate the elemental causes of thunder, not simply its sound; here the opposition of fire and water, hot and cold, is essential, and it is a distinction that the addition of callidus in opposition to gelidus helps to stress. Lucretius has also given less prominence in his rendition to the doer of the deed; Homer's blacksmith is gone, replaced by the general "when we," late in the passage and in a subordinate clause. There is good reason for this alteration: the last thing Lucretius wants to do with his analogy is suggest that some volition lurks behind the voltage.9 There is perhaps, however, something to be gained if the reader remembers the context of this description. Traditionally, although not in Homer, the Cyclopes were the forgers of Zeus' thunder. This is just the sort of superstition, with its involvement of a dark and inscrutable power above (such as is excoriated in Book 1.64-65), that Lucretius wants to attack with scientific explanation. Lucilius had in fact, in a 8 Ennius, for instance, streamlines the detail of two similes he borrows from Homer (the horse simile [535-39 Sk.] and storm simile [432-34 Sk.]), and omits especially what does not have immediate relevance to the narrative. Cf. M. v. Albrecht, "Ein Pferdegleichnis bei Ennius," Hermes 97 (1969) 333-45. On the Roman penchant for rhetorical and sound effects, see conveniently A. D. Leeman, Orationis Ratio (Amsterdam 1963) 381, L. R. Palmer, The Latin Lan- guage (London 1954) 104-105. 9Homer, conversely, very much wants the person to the fore, one of the themes in the Cyclops episode being Odysseus' proud mastery of technology and language.</page><page sequence="6">144 PETER J. AICHER satire from which Lucretius may have borrowed elsewhere in his poem, criticized believers of superstitious religion by singling out their belief in Polyphemus and the Cyclopes.10 In his forge-simile, then, Lucretius not only illuminates the scientific explanation for thunder, but alludes to and refutes the traditional explanation for its appearance. Several of the characteristics of Lucretian imitation noted thus far can be seen still more clearly in Lucretius' longest and best-known imitation of Homer, his depiction of the serene spaces in which the Epicurean gods dwell. To describe this region (what Epicurus called the geamc6apta, Cicero the intermundia), he turns to Homer's Mt. Olympos: 0iXugni06v8', 8t P 0paa 6 Oe v ESo; &amp;YPoaxq aiel evat- oXtz' Advegoott TtvYooerat oAbre rot' 0opppy 86eeAat oi.CF te v e t-nitivatoXC, &amp;XXh X1 X' a&amp;YOp7 ITEaIaT t &amp;vepehog, Xeid 6' 8 ta apogev atyX (Od.6.42-45) Lucretius includes this description in his paean to Epicurus that opens Book 3, where it helps him describe the vision of peace unveiled by his master's philosophy: apparet divum numen sedesque quietae quas neque concutiunt venti nec nubila nimbis aspergunt neque nix acri concreta pruina cana cadens violat semper&lt;que&gt; innubilus aether integit, et large diffuso lumine ridet. (3.18-24) This is the one Homeric imitation in Lucretius that has drawn sustained commentary. Bailey calls it a close rendition, which Kenney denies.1 Perhaps it is best to approach it from two angles, and consider first the allegiance it shows to the Homeric Greek, and secondly its alterations in light of the passage's new context, as a piece of Lucretius' own poetry. 10 See J. J. O'Hara, "Somnia Ficta in Lucretius and Lucilius," CQ 37 (1987) 517-18. Lucilius' criticism of the superstitious is found in fragment 480-83 M. 11 Bailey, Lucretius 990; E. J. Kenney, ed., Lucretius: De Rerum Natura III (Cambridge 1971) 78.</page><page sequence="7">LUCRETIAN REVISIONS OF HOMER 145 Bailey is right if one considers the progression of images, as well as the shape of some of its lines. Lucretius follows the same order of images in Homer: the seat of the gods, no wind, no rain, no snow, but always the cloudless sky, and a brightness. Two other features of the Latin indicate that a close reading of Homer lies behind the text. Bailey (991) notes that innubilis is a "fine Lucretian &amp;i. Xey., translating Homer's v(pcXogoq." There are also rhythmical similarities, especially in the enjambment of aspergunt and integit, which translate and duplicate the positions of 80eerat and in~ratt. Significant variations are also apparent. D. West observes that the sound of the Greek has been Latinized, and mentions in particular the increased alliteration in Lucretius.2 The familiar Lucretian phrase diffuso lumine (v. 45) in place of eu0" ... at'yrl also gives the language a native ring. Other alterations are identified by B. Farrington, who argues however that the metaphorical language of ridet and violat, along with the padded description of snow in the phrase nix acri concreta pruina / cana cadens, "mars the simplicity of Homer."13 There is no question that Homer's description is more straightforward, but Far- rington's critique is one-sided in its assumption that the only basis for judging the imitation is its fidelity to the virtues of its models. West more sensibly examines the alterations in terms of Lucretius' own aims and interests.14 It can then be seen that Lucretius is not really clouding his description with figures and irrelevant associations. As for the metaphors, West notes with reference to Homer's untMS8pogev that "if light has feet, the aether can surely have a face."15 Granted, however, that nothing in Homer approaches the tone of violat, this meta- phor is not a gratuitous, indiscriminate instance of anthropomor- phizing, but bound up with Lucretius' picture of the gods and his atomic theory. His interest in physical phenomena leads him to gloss 12 D. West, The Imagery and Poetry of Lucretius (Edinburgh 1969) 30. 13B. Farrington, Primum Graius Homo (Cambridge 1927) 33. 14 West (note 12 above) 31-33. Kenney, ed. Book III, 20, also stresses the need for a similar type of criticism: "Any attempt to describe and evaluate Lucretius' poetry should begin by considering ends and means." 15 West (note 12 above) 32. Ridet can also be said to look forward to the next line in Homer, which comparisons of the two passages ignore because Lucretius only follows him loosely here: tij i vt Ipnovrat Adicapes; &amp;oi ilxara ravra (6. 46); the enjoyment of Homer's gods is reflected in the smile of Lucretius' sky. Homer's line is just visible behind its Epicurean exegesis in the continuation of the Latin: omnia suppeditat porro natura neque ulla / res animi pacem delibat tempore in ullo (3.23-24).</page><page sequence="8">146 PETER J. AICHER the simple Xtuv with nixacri concreta pruina, which, as Bailey notes, looks to Epicurus' explanation for snow in D. L.10.107; Lucretius then visual- izes "what is concreta bombarding the intangibly delicate abode of the gods,"16 a visualization which then finds a suitable expression in violat. It introduces a moralizing absent in Homer, but Lucretius cannot help but be polemical in his portrayal of the gods, since his whole work is an attempt to show men how to correct their thoughts and approximate the divine calm accessible through the philosophy of Epicurus. Such alterations only partially explain the different effect of Lucre- tius' passage and its ability to avoid associations with alien aspects of Homer's divinities. Apart from specific differences of phrasing and emphasis mentioned above, the entire picture of Lucretius' heaven is given a mental framework quite different from the original's. Homer's picture is occasioned as the destination of Athena, who has just finished talking to Nausicaa: 71 gLev a ;o)o'&amp;;T1 Yp'0K)qa;jtta 'A)1vVI WOiSuiRn6v8', "Ot p at O'""v C08oq &amp;aopX;' id(a. (Od. 6.41-42) Lucretius introduces his description as the culmination of a vision revealed by Epicurean philosophy; as soon as Epicurus' precepts are taken to heart, diffugiunt animi terrores, moenia mundi discedunt, totum video per inane geri res. apparet divum numen sedesque quietae. ... (3.16-18) Homer's version is both more anthropomorphic and less personal. His region is the geographical destination of a colorful goddess; the region Lucretius describes has no geography and no Olympic god. And yet Homer's description, for all its anthropomorphic clarity, is at a double remove; it is a report (pao't) within a narrative. In Lucretius the scene is a first person vision (video), the general effect of which is aptly characterized by Wormell: ... the majestic peace of the setting is but the outward manifestation of the majesty and peace of mind of its 16 West (note 12 above) 33, who refers to Lucretius' portrayal of divine untouchability in 5.150-54.</page><page sequence="9">LUCRETIAN REVISIONS OF HOMER 147 inhabitants.... This is not merely an imaginary picture of the heavenly places but a revelation; the divina voluptas and horror [3.28-29] which seize Lucretius are in the context part of the sense of awe in the presence of the supernatural, and this is the language of mysticism." The phrase divum numen also contributes to a conception of divinity different from the plastic forms that enliven Homeric narrative. Ken- ney notes that numen is an abstract concept in Republican times, meaning "divine will," only later coming to mean "god," and adds that its use with apparet is perhaps deliberately paradoxical.'" Finally, by rendering &amp;otpakg ("safe, secure") as quietae ("tranquil"), Lucretius has chosen a word more suitable to an Epicurean's conception of divinity. Homer's word stresses the freedom from mortal shock that is the Homeric god's primary advantage over humankind. Quietae, on the other hand, connotes a freedom from all commotion whatsoever; it clearly excludes the Homeric gods, with all their Olympian turmoil and intrigue, and more closely approximates a translation of Epicurus' With this passage it is clear that Lucretius is not interested in referring the reader to a specific Homeric context, the juxtaposition of which with his own text would extend his meaning. On the contrary, having found one of the most aetherial descriptions in Homer associat- ed with the gods, he still revises it to minimize all narrative associations. This is one measure of Lucretius' skill as an imitator, that he can take a passage seemingly permeated with an alien conception of divinity and, retaining its original sequence of images and much of their clarity, employ it to portray a vision central to his philosophy.19 17D. E. W. Wormell, "The Personal World of Lucretius," in Lucretius (note 1 above) 45. 18 Kenney, ed. Book III, 78. 19 Kenney perhaps overlooks the real significance of the passage in his estimation of Lucretius' philosophy and its weaknesses: "When man," he asks, "has cast out the fear of death-if he can-what is he left with? This question Lucretius makes no real attempt to answer. ... [W]hat life might be like for mankind if the battle [against ignorance and error] were ever to be won he does not tell us and perhaps could not imagine" (ed. Book III, 33). Yet the vision in the prooemium to Book 3 (vv. 14-30) serves quite well as a positive goal and promises more than merely the "cautious and muted happiness" that Kenney projects as the only reward of philosophy that Lucretius, following Epicurus, could envision. Admittedly, Lucretius' philosophy is often cast in</page><page sequence="10">148 PETER J. AICHER Although the foregoing revisions employ a Homeric description for new purposes, their primary purpose is not the direct criticism of the Homeric context; there is at most an implied rejection of values or beliefs crucial to the Greek text (as in the case of the anthropomorphism of Homer's conception of heaven or sky, or the existence of thunder- forging giants). In the following revisions the quarrel with the original becomes explicit; in such instances a Homeric scene is imitated only to criticize the sensibility that would accept the Greek scene as ideal (when in truth it is craven) or as real (when in fact it is fiction). In the proem to Book 2, arguing that human needs are easily satisfied by nature, Lucretius laments both the widespread attraction to luxury and the turmoil of acquisition involved in supporting a lavish way of life. To provide a vivid picture of this excess, he borrows from Homer's description of Alcinous' palace; we can still be happy, Lucretius argues, si non aurea sunt iuvenum simulacra per aedes lampadas igniferas manibus retinentia dextris, lumina nocturnis epulis ut suppeditentur, nec domus argento fulget auroque renidet nec citharae reboant laqueata aurataque templa. (2.24-28) The first three lines of the Latin follow the Greek closely: XpIOEtot 6' 'pa ]oCi pot 6i Lir7ov ni pn't roRv .aoaav aitOo~AvaR c S o18t Rdc &amp; xepov CXovweg, pcivovteg vircagt oazrd ic R o &amp;xCX tttoveoaot. (Od. 7.100-102) The last two lines of Lucretius' passage (vv. 27-28) do not correspond as closely to any one line of Homer, but the piling up of precious metals in the Latin--argento... auroquel... aurata-has a parallel earlier in the same scene, where Homer describes the exterior of Alcinous' palace: terms of the need to negate emotion and trim experience, but here in this vision the peace he strives for is experienced and expressed not as a leftover calm, but as a revelation, itself productive of strong emotion (the divina voluptas and horror). It is another question whether such a vision is widely accessible, has broader ethical implications, or necessarily follows upon an Epicurean chain of reasoning.</page><page sequence="11">LUCRETIAN REVISIONS OF HOMER 149 apy6peot aczrito' 6' Av XYaKcp o8zaov oi68, Apy~6peov 8' cp' 6icepO6ptov, Xpua)(Y 6C iCopivm. Xp1)Etot 8' 9Kic TEpPe Kai ad9&amp;pypeot ici've; ?ojav. (Od. 7.89-91) It is in Lucretius' free rendition of this description that his careful artistry becomes evident. Although the metals of Homer's description are associ- ated with glitter and reflection, there is no mention of light in Homer's picture of the palace's exterior. Lucretius adapts the description, dove- tailing the last two lines into the highly illuminated banquet scene by maintaining (withfulget and renidet) the emphasis on light. This empha- sis, however, is not pursued simply for the visual brilliance it adds to the scene; Lucretius' alterations are involved in his message and implicated in a larger scheme of imagery that dominates the proem to Book 2, which establishes a contrast between physical and philosophical light. This contrast is most clearly drawn in the proem's concluding lines: hunc igitur terrorem animi tenebrasque necessest non radii solis neque lucida tela diei discutiant, sed naturae species ratioque. (2. 59-61) The banquet light of the Homeric imitation partakes of the sun's discredited, physical illumination, a connection made more obvious by an intervening passage in which regal splendor and the glitter of gold are shown to be incapable of dispelling the dark fears of human lives (vv. 48-54). In such a context, then, Lucretius' emphasis on light in his description of the banquet, with all its gold and silver, is more than a vivid depiction of wealth and decadence--it is tantamount to philo- sophical criticism. The more light there is, the more an impression of futility and false values is lent to the scene. Lucretius' imitation of Homer is thus seen to be quite purposeful: where Homer's description focused on the lighting of the banquet (7.100-102), Lucretius followed him closely (vv. 24-26); where Homer was concerned primarily with precious metals (7.88-91), Lucretius added the light demanded by the scene's new function in the proem (vv. 27-28).20 20 This same sensitivity to the imagery of light and darkness may be at play in another short phrase Lucretius borrowed from Homer, mortalibus aegris, rendering 6ethocin t poToiot. Although this phrase appears several times in each of Homer's epics (II. 22.31, 22.76, 24.525, Od. 12.341, 15.408), referring to</page><page sequence="12">150 PETER J. AICHER The remaining examples of revision show a still more explicitly polemical stance towards Homeric material, but with the same creative variation of the Homeric text for Lucretius' own purposes. In Book 3, where Lucretius debunks the traditional accounts of Hades' post- mortem terrors, Homeric passages are twice engaged. There is a glancing, sarcastic reference to Homer's description of Tityos ("who lay across nine acres," Od. 11.577) in Lucretius' hypothetical allowance of a Tityos "who not only occupies nine acres with outstretched limbs, but the entire earth" (3.988-89). Lucretius does allow these myths an allegorical significance, however, and in his treatment of Sisyphus he is less concerned to discredit the original than to use it as an allegory ("Sisyphus lives before our eyes," 3.995). It is the ambition for power that Sisyphus and his rock represent: hoc est adverso nixantem trudere monte saxum quod tamen e summo iam vertice rursum volvitur et plani raptim petit aequora campi. (3.1000-02) This description corresponds closely to Homer's: Xhav &amp;vo Moe Mcice iod htXpov - &amp;WXX' 6jzre kot icpov 1)nCpjaXFXetv, 262' doaTpjVOCaaie i Kpaxatiy azot; tg etta ECFi8ovSe iiKvAteo X&amp;a; &amp;avat6~;. (Od. 11.596-98) Allegorized, Homer need not be satirized; having established the inter- pretive framework of allegory, Lucretius is free simply to emulate the vividness of the original and some of its sound effects. Yet here as well, Lucretius' description takes new directions that implicate it closely humanity in general, it is used once specifically to characterize the Cimmer- ians, who live in the dark lands where Odysseus will find the World of the Dead (Od. 11.14-19). Lucretius uses the phrase (6.1) to characterize humans before they received the blessings of civilization from Athens and Epicurus. This same proem to Book 6 ends with the repetition of the message that closed the proem to Book 2, declaring that the only light able to break through to benighted humanity comes from philosophy (6.39-42). Such a reading of mortalibus aegris (an Eliotesque "We are the Cimmerians ...") is in line with what Lucretius does more explicitly with Homer's underworld in other passages, wherein Homer's mythology is used as allegory.</page><page sequence="13">LUCRETIAN REVISIONS OF HOMER 151 with the message of the text that occasions the imitation. Earlier, Lucretius was seen to introduce a pathetic fallacy to his description of heaven by rendering intnikvarat with violat. Similarly, in the last line of this imitation, petit renders icuiv8ero. The significance of the motiva- tion attributed to the Latin stone is apparent only in connection with the lines that precede the Homeric imitation and form the substance of the hoc (v. 1000) that begins the analogy to Sisyphus: qui petere a populo fascis saevasque securis imbibit et semper victus tristisque recedit. nam petere imperium.... (3.996-98) Here the ambitious politician is twice described with the same verb that Lucretius gave to the stone, which would not have been possible with a more literal rendering of iuivFAeo. Lucretius thus had both the politician and the stone in mind when he imitated Homer, just as he had the stone in mind in his description of the politician, who forever rises and falls (semper ... recedit). A further link between the imitation and Roman politics is to be found, as West has pointed out, in Lucretius' expansion of nk68ov&amp; to plani... aequora campi: "The rock makes for the level plain, plani petit aequora campi; and in electoral terms the candidate goes down to the Campus Martius to stand for election again, descendat in Campum petitor (Horace Odes 3.1.11).,,21 Once again it is apparent that Lucretius' notable divergences from the Greek text cannot simply be attributed to a wish to dress up the original with a metaphor or embellish it with an otiose phrase; his alterations are rather instances of careful incorporations into his own design. A final example shows Lucretius using Homer's own words to spring a trap that is set for Homer's Chimaera. Lucretius censors this fantastic creation as a violation of "nature's firm laws" (foedere naturae certo, 5.924): qui fieri potuit, triplici cum corpore ut una, prima leo, postrema draco, media ipsa, Chimaera ore foras acrem flaret de corpore flammam? (5.904-906) The second and third line are a close translation of I. 6.181-82: 21 West (note 12 above)102.</page><page sequence="14">152 PETER J.

The only alteration Lucretius has made in line 905 is the addition of ipsa, which amounts to a gloss for Romans on the Grecism Chimaera and means something like "from which the creature gets her name., In line 906 the exhalation of fierce flame is retained (flaret, acrem, and flammam rendering C&amp;onveoioeoa, wetvbv, and nu pb), but the periphra- sis of gvo; and the epithet aiOoegvoto are dropped in favor of oreforas and de corpore. At first sight these substitutions seem weak in compar- ison, but again their point must be sought beyond the confines of the imitation proper. In the verses immediately preceding those quoted above, Lucretius establishes that lions, like all flesh and blood, are burnt by fire: flamma quidem vero cum corpora fulva leonum tam soleat torrere atque urere quam genus omne. (5.901-902) The reappearance of the words flamma and corpora, used here of the combustible lion, in Lucretius' description of the Chimaera, leads Homer into a contradiction of the natural law just established. Lucre- tius' alterations thus serve to point up this contradiction: corpore is once again coupled with flamma to complete the formula for disaster estab- lished by nature; ore, apparently redundant when set against the Greek, also serves to tighten the argument, stressing that it is specifically the lion's section of the creature, according to Homer (n p6oOe '0ov), that is engaged in fire-breathing. From the six imitations discussed above it is clear that Lucretius did not adopt a uniform attitude toward Homeric poetry, but rather imitates, alters, or criticizes as it suits him. This variability reflects the twofold origins of Lucretius' work, its double allegiance to both the high poetic tradition and the philosophy of Epicurus, whose school, as Kenney notes, "was notoriously hostile to poetry." Insofar as Lucre- 22 See A. Ronconi, Interpreti Latini di Omero (Turin 1973) 32, and commen- tary to 5.905-906 in Bailey. 23 Kenney, ed.

Where Homer by his authority lends weight to beliefs incompatible with Epicureanism, he is liable to be ridiculed, con- troverted and undermined. This does nothing, however, to diminish his position at the head of a poetic tradition that has a life and power of its own apart from its relationship to philosophy. The independent su- premacy of each predecessor is perhaps most apparent in the positions that Lucretius ascribes to each of the authors in an argument stressing the universality of death (3.1025-52). Epicurusappearsas thecrownofcreation, humanity's ipse (1042): even he had to die. Homer, however, is portrayed as supreme in his own realm: envision among the dead, Lucretius says, Heliconiadum comites; quorum unus Homerus sceptra potitus.... (3.1037-38) Although Lucretius does not come out and say it, Epicurus is greatly in need of this other tradition himself, for it has in its charm the ability to immortalize his message in public consciousness, much as Homer immortalized Achilles. This function of poetry is evident in the only other direct reference to Homer in D.R.N. (1.124), where Lucretius calls him semper floren[s]. In the same passage the immortality of Ennius' poetry is affirmed as well, with a metaphor that leads into the reference to Homer as florens; it was Ennius who primus amoeno detulit ex Helicone perenni fronde coronam, per gentis Italas hominum quae clara clueret. (1.117-19) Yet this praise of his poetic predecessors and his identification with them can be expressed in the same breath that refutes them, as in the case of the reference to Ennius just quoted, who is mentioned in the first instance as the locus classicus of a foolish idea (reincarnation in an animal, 1.116), and only then is crowned. The range of Lucretius' reception of Homer, then, is a reflection of his own distinction between style and content (the honey and the medicine of his famous simile), and reflects his acceptance of an independent tradition for each.24 24 In this distinction, and in his easy appropriation of a tradition contam- inated by an alien mentality, Lucretius prefigures Augustine's appropriation</page><page sequence="16">154 PETER J. AICHER Although Homer appears at the head of all poets (unus Homerus), for Lucretius Homer is more of a figurehead for a living tradition than a primary poetic model. The contrast with Ennius is helpful. For Ennius, Homer was the direct model not only of scenes, similes, and phrases in the Annales but of many notable stylistic features as well, which involved innovations of syntax, morphology, and of course meter. Lucretius had no such urgent need to fabricate (if the word is suitable for any style, it is suited to Ennius' epic) a Latin heroic register, primarily because he had Ennius' immense effort before him. Lucretius' Homeric imitations show a close, word-by-word working with Hom- eric passages, and Lucretius very much wants to imitate Homer's success, but stylistically Homer's influence on D.R.N. does not ap- proach its omnipresence in the Annales. It should be clear from the foregoing discussions that Lucretius' Homeric imitations cannot be fully understood or judged by isolating the Latin from its context and comparing it word-for-word with the Greek; only by examining the Homeric passages in their new context can Lucretius' alterations be appreciated. Close observations, such as Farrington's, perceptive as they may be in identifying differences of tone and metaphor, and in assessing what Lucretius has lost in the rendering, miss much of Lucretius' care and creativity if they ignore the thematic relevance and verbal integration achieved by many of his alterations. The description of divine space is only the most impressive example of his skill in adapting Homer for his own designs; not only are particulars of the description altered to suit their Epicurean setting (quieta, violat), but the whole is transformed into a vision with an effect and significance far different from that of the original. In the forge-analogy for thunder, it was seen that the antithesis emphasized by Lucretius (candens, gelidum) supported his explanation of one of thunder's causes, and that the agent of the tempering was set on the periphery, steering clear of the notion that the lightning was involved with volition. In his description of troop maneuvers taken from Homer, Lucretius stays quite close to his model, but combines this picture from the Greek text with a scene from Roman life, and frames the translation in its larger setting by repeating the word fulgor. Still more care is of pagan literary virtues (which Augustine calls "Egyptian gold" in reference to the plunder taken in the Exodus), in contrast to the guilty Jerome, who in a nightmare was rebuked by God for being more Ciceronian than Christian.</page><page sequence="17">LUCRETIAN REVISIONS OF HOMER 155 shown in the banquet scene, where the effects of integrating the imitation into the text are entirely different. Here Lucretius conflates and otherwise alters Homer's description, adding more illumination (fulget, renidet) to a passage already striking for its imagery of light. This works to undermine the ultimate value of such shiny wealth by linking its description to the proem's judgmental imagery of light, false light, and darkness. Less dramatic alterations, but still indicative of the author's active imagination and independent purpose, appear in the personi- fication that serves to link Sisyphus' stone with the restless aspira- tions of the office-seeker it allegorizes, and, in a more expository context, the emphasis on the Chimaera's mouth and corporality in general (ore foras, de corpore), which serve in their setting to point up an absurdity. Comparisons with Virgil are instructive here. Lucretius' revision of his source, his careful reworking of an original text, is a trait he shares with his successor. In his typology of the art of reference in the Georgics, R. Thomas has identified several types of reference in which this revision- ist spirit is at work, most clearly in instances of "correction," which he calls "the quintessentially Alexandrian type of reference." In these instances "[t]he poet provides unmistakable indications of his source, then proceeds to offer detail which contradicts or alters that source." Lucretius shows a great deal of sophistication in his correction of an earlier text; in this regard his literary learnedness is a match for Virgil's. There is on the other hand a difference in their manner of imitation that plays a significant part in the widely differing effects of their styles. As Thomas describes Virgil's references to other texts, Virgil "constant- ly intends that his reader be 'sent back' to them, consulting them through memory or physically, and that he then return and apply this observa- tion to the Virgilian text." 26 Thomas reserves a category of reference for Virgil's casual echoes of an original, but the majority of his references are more complex, as in the case of what he calls "single reference:" Virgil's chief purpose in referring to a single locus is simply stated: he intends that the reader recall the context of the model and apply that context to the new situation; such reference thereby becomes the means of imparting great significance, of making connections or conveying ideas on a level of intense subtlety.27 25 R. Thomas, "Virgil's Georgics and the Art of Reference," HSCP 90 (1986) 185. 26 Ibid. 172. 27 Ibid. 177.</page><page sequence="18">156 PETER J. AICHER This complexity and extension of meaning gained by the engagement of a new context is a feature that sets Virgil (and the Augustan poets in general) apart from Lucretius. Some of Lucretius' imitations have more effect if the reader recalls a situation or context in Homer, but only in a most general sense. The troop maneuvers gain in intensity, perhaps, if the reader recalls the commotion and energy of battle in the Iliad, and associations of Phaiacian luxury do no harm to the picture of the banquet Lucretius paints. But even the forge-simile lifted from the Cyclopes episode, perhaps containing a critique of superstitious beliefs about the cause of thunder, engages the original context only in a general way; the critique relies more on the traditional Hesiodic con- ception of the giants as arms-makers than on the specific context of Polyphemus' blinding. This is far different from engaging a specific situation whose attendant circumstances must be carefully recalled to open the full range of meaning. Consider one example discussed by Thomas. When Virgil translates a Homeric simile about irrigation, the poet would have the reader, with no further reference, understand the context of that simile--a battle between Achilles and the river Sca- mander. A connection (corroborated by other passages) between agriculture and warfare is thereby presented. "[I]t is that context, and not the simile itself, which informs his deeper poetic intentions."28 The contrast with Lucretius' imitations is clear. In his forge-simile, the simile itself carries the burden of meaning with its overt analogy; if the explanation the simile illustrates serves to refute superstitions associ- ated with the Homeric text, so much the better. In this description and in the revelation of divine space (3.18-24), Lucretius seems careful to make changes that work to suppress further associations of specific context when the most obvious associations would obscure rather than extend his vision. The same absence of specific contextual reference characterizes the more direct refutations of Homer as well. Sisyphus and the Chimaera stand perhaps as representatives of a wider class of fantasies, but nothing appears to be gained by recalling their specific context. This trait, then, sets him apart from Virgil: Lucretius shows a preponderance of care in tailoring an imitation for his own text, and a relative disinterest in an extension of his meaning through wider, unspoken associations with the context of the original. Lucretius in fact had good reason for the relatively limited allusive- ness of his style, and it is possible to do more harm than good to his reputation if we expect him to display Alexandrian or Augustan sophis- 28 Thomas (note 25 above) 179.</page><page sequence="19">LUCRETIAN REVISIONS OF HOMER 157 tication in all their forms. Virgil's density or depth of allusion, charac- teristic especially of the Georgics, would have been largely inappropri- ate for D.R.N. First, although Lucretius is proud of the poetic tradition, he does not want his readers continually distracted into poetic texts that in their general import have nothing to do with his Epicurean message. Virgil, as Thomas notes above, relies on this distraction. Secondly, although it is possible to use the unspoken associations of contextual references to make a specific point, in practice this technique tends to be more suggestive than determinative, and plays a vital part in giving Virgil's style its celebrated ambiguities, polyphonic voices, and pat- terns of suggestion that often serve to link images and themes into a complex of great import but no clear point.29 Lucretius, on the other hand, being truly didactic and having a clear message at which to aim his words, has less frequent use for ambiguity and suggestion to advance his argument. What his Homeric imitations sacrifice in depth of allusion they gain in the single-minded clarity and direction for which he strives in his style.30 This is not to deny to Lucretius' style a sophisticated degree of learned allusiveness. Kenney makes a clear case for Lucretius' Alexan- drian sophistication and learnedness by showing several instances in which Lucretius uses oblique allusions and Hellenistic literary topoi to make his point.31 The poet is clearly intimate with the tradition, and no doubt expects that most of his Roman readers will be well-versed themselves. As analyzed in this study, the imitations of Homer, even lacking the allusiveness characteristic of Virgil, provide further grounds for conferring the title "doctus" on Lucretius, and furnish emphatic support for Kenney's prediction quoted at the beginning of my article, that examinations of Lucretius' poetry would show the craftsman in evidence throughout. Lucretius' sophistication is apparent both in his skillful rendering of Greek and in the subtlety with which he orients the original towards a new design. These imitations not only refute the impression that the refined craft of poetry as practiced by his contem- poraries, the "neoteroi," was alien to Lucretius, but alter as well the traditional image of a writer who gets carried away with purple 29 Some recent assessments of Virgil's ambiguity are conveniently gath- ered in G. K. Galinsky's review of W. Clausen, D. Ross, and R. O. A. M. Lyne in AJP 110 (1989)171-77. On this characteristic of Lucretius' style, see E. J.
