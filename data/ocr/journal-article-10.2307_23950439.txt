<plain_text><page sequence="1">Science Science and the Modern World, by A. N. Whitehead, F.R.S., Sc.D., &amp;c., Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and Professor of Philo sophy in Harvard University. Lowell Lectures, 1925. (Cam bridge, at the University Press, 1926.) In the first eight of these lectures their author sketches the history of that product of scientific thought that may be called the mechanical theory of the world, and deals with the supplementation and revision which the theory has recently received from the doctrines of relativity and the quantum. By ' sciencein the title of the book, is thus chiefly meant natural philosophy or the ontological interpretation of theoretical physics suggested to minds steeped in applied mathematics. Dr White head devotes one of these lectures to the romantic recoil from exact science; and he has much to say, by the way, of philosophers as well as of scientific investigators. These lectures deal with the history of science mainly in order to sketch in a background or foil against which the writer gradually expounds his own view of Nature: a theory which is completed in lectures entitled ' Abstraction', ' God', ' Religion and ScienceThis is the main contribution of the volume; and as it is also the centre of interest for theological readers, attention shall be confined to it together with certain philosophical issues that are in volved. The main defects in the materialistic and mechanical theory which has been heuristically used, whether or not accepted by men of science</page><page sequence="2">428 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES as ontology, since the seventeenth century, are stated to be that ' it provides, none of the elements which compose the immediate psycho logical experiences of mankind ' nor any trace ' of the organic unity of a whole, from which the organic unities of electrons, protons, molecules, and living bodies can emerge' (p. 104). Further, it assigns no reason in the nature of things why material bodies should have any physical relations to each other. Dr Whitehead traces these shortcomings to the old assumption of what he calls ' simple location ': i. e. of position in definite regions of space and time apart from relations to other traits of space and time. If what is meant here is unrelatedness to other things things or happenings in space and time—and I think it must be—I do not see why a body or a configuration definitely placed and dated does not ' mirror' bodies elsewhere, in the sense of being causally affected by them; and I am unable to see that the figurative term ' mirror' can legitimately mean anything else, when applied to matter. We cannot, I think, say that the mechanical theory is fallacious on this ground : if it were a theory about phenomenal Nature, we could : but it is a theory about the sub-phenomenal, or about matter defined as charac terized by nothing but mass and movability. But it is beyond gainsaying that the mechanical theory is abstract, and that if its mass-particles be the ultimate physical ' reals' then phenomenal Nature, rich in physical properties and qualities, must be ' made' by rapport of minds with it: a view which the lecturer does not countenance. And one can sympathize with Dr Whitehead's desire for a more fundamental expression of ' the concrete character of natural fact', and with his promise of paying due consideration to the empirical and the psychological. But unfortunately ' natural fact' seems to many of us much more than simple datum, purely objective, accepted or apprehended with directness and immediacy. The common or public event that seems here to be in question, such as a rainbow, is not concrete in the same degree as is an individual's ' percept of it'; indeed the physical object, as distinct from the private object of the individual's ' immediate' apprehension, is what we think is there : as, e. g. is especially plain in the case of the far side of the moon. And even the individual's object, commonly called appearance of the real or common and conceptual Object, is not immediately apprehended unless ' immediacy ' connotes merely the percipient's ignorance, at the moment of perceiving, that his perception is dependent on previous experience, and is a complex process psychologically mediated, involving intersubjective intercourse and ' real' categories such as permanence, &amp;c., as well as sensory acquaintance. In taking the ' event' as simple, concrete datum that is read off with immediacy, an important issue, I fear, is being begged; the thin end of the realist's wedge is seeking</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 429 purchase and the knowing process is being assumed to be far simpler than the psychologist will allow it to be. Again when space and time are assumed as primary data, and as existents into which sense-objects have ' ingressionthe author is assuming the conceptual to be equally actual as the sensory, and taking finished products of thought and idealization as gift-horses that must not be looked in the mouth. The issue between realism and idealism is in these respects not faced, and even the ' provisional' realism from which Dr Whitehead sets out is not established. It would seem that these two types of theory of know ledge, along with phenomenalism such as Kant's, are equally ventures beyond the given or the known, to be justified by remoter general consequences, and meanwhile guessful attempts to solve one equation between two unknowns. Thus I would demur to starting from the ' event'; that is a start in the air, not from the ' ultimate unit of natural occurrence' (p. 146). Convinced as I am that there is no knowledge of an ordo essendi possible save through following whither it leads the ordo cognoscendi, which philosophers have practically always rejected as irrelevant, I am unable to recognize any ground, in concrete fact and its external con trol, for the theory elaborated in these lectures as to how things and occurrences come to be. Dr Whitehead's method is not empirically analytic; it seems to consist in the fashioning of concepts, a pursuit in which the poet in him predominates over the minute philosopher. There are an indefinite number of possible philosophies of this kind, and perhaps nothing to enable us to choose between them: just as there are an indefinite number of possible odes to Duty. But if philo sophy would mean business and not intellectual pastime, it seems to me that it must not be an exercise in free composition, but rather an attempt to translate into metaphysical language the one and only original set us—viz. the forthcoming ' knowledge' so called that we have by common sense which, however presumptive, must be some ' function' of ultimate truth. For the old materialistic mechanism Dr Whitehead substitutes an ' organic mechanism', such as will provide for emergent evolution and at the same time not leave all qualitative diversity, aesthetic and other value, to functioning of mind evoked by nervous response to mass particles or their equivalents. The word ' organism', as he uses it, has nothing to do with vitalism: it merely means an organic whole, in which the parts have their natures and relations determined by the whole. His organic ' event' is credited, then, with intrinsic and ex trinsic reality: which I construe as immanent and transient causality, terms from which I see no reason to depart for new ones. Its relations (which word, I presume, as usual ambiguously denotes actual rapport</page><page sequence="4">43ο THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES as well as logical and possibly factitious relations) are constituted in ternally: here, by the way, connexion with the pluralistic new realism is repudiated. The event has determinateness, persistence (or reitera tion), and determinative capacity. It is, in fact, our old friend a ' sub stance' over again, as purified of obsolete historical associations and as recently reinstated by Mr Johnson in philosophical respectability: save only that it is not allowed ' independence', and so is to be com pared with Spinoza's mode rather than with Leibniz's windowless monad. ' Independence ' is a very ambiguous word ; and one need not be a Spinozist for not being a Leibnizian. The organism is en dowed (figuratively) with choice : it ' selects', say, as a magnet selects iron dust from a mixture of it and sawdust. In virtue of reciprocal action it is ' in a certain sense'—perhaps a rhetorical sense ?—' every where'. It is not (p. 102) a mere assemblage of parts or ' ingredients' [qualities ?], but is unified by what is called ' prehension', or by ' pro gressive realization'. Dr Whitehead speaks as if this realization were actual process; but perhaps this is only figurativeness comparable to Hegel's, and prehension means but the inverse of conceptual analysis, not anything genetic. If perchance it has the latter meaning, the doctrine would seem to involve the actual existence, independent of knowers or abstracters, of universals or timeless objects; and their ' ingression' into particulars will be but the converse of Plato's ' par ticipation' by particulars in universals. This construction of the writer's meaning is certainly suggested in the later lectures. Anyhow, an event is ' the grasping into unity of a pattern of aspects' (p. 168). It is perhaps impossible for any one but the lecturer himself to under stand precisely what is meant by highly figurative words such as abound in his discussion of the realization of the event; certainly I am at a loss when I would translate into forthcoming scientific or philosophical terms the ' aspects' and ' patterns ' that are unified, the ' envisagement' of eternal objects, the ' reference' of event to event, and so forth. It is possible, therefore, that in this sketchy exposition of Dr Whitehead's thought I am misrepresenting or mutilating a construction which I con fess I cannot at all points understand, and am unintentionally un sympathetic in entering a caveat against his love for metaphor; though on some occasions I am inclined to think it really mischievous. Thus ' prehension' is a notion like that of ' perception' as used by Bacon where he says that all bodies, whatsoever, though they have no sense, have perception. ' Perception' here is as figurative as ' sensitiveness ' accredited to a thermometer. As the behavimiristic school have employed the rhetoric of William James in order to effect the reduc tion of the irreducible difference between the unique subject-object and the object-object relations, between a thing's being and a thing's</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS 431 appearing; and as Dr Whitehead himself seems in places anxious to impugn the uniqueness of ' consciousnessthis protest may not be gratuitous. He construes Bacon's ' perception' as ' taking account' and describes prehension as uncognitive apprehension : I confess there seems to me no similarity between prehension and apprehension save in the sound of the names. Leibniz's ' mirroring', which is but 1-1 correspondence between states of monads, is again dangerously borrowed when it is suggested (p. 103) that 'an event mirrors within itself the modes of its predecessors as memories'. . .; for memory means reminiscence, and it is absurd to speak, as some do, of the ,memory of plants'. As for the word 'awareness', unless it be an elliptical expression for awareness of something (object) by something (subject), I should affirm it to be a mere nonsense-word. Yet Dr Whitehead dislikes, apparently, this assertion of fundamental duality in all experience which I take to be but an assertion of an analytical proposition; and he seems to repudiate all subjective activity when he says (p. 103) that a perception conditioned by bodily sense organs ' is on the same level as all other events, except for an unusual complexity and stability of inherent pattern'. But perhaps ' unusual' and ' stability' reinstate surreptitiously the ejected ego and the rejected uniqueness of consciousness, as in the case of William James's dictum that awareness of breathing is the same breathing ' taken in another context י: ' taking' being, of course, either consciousness over again or nothing. Dr Whitehead is convinced that secondary qualities such as colour, and value which perhaps he might call tertiary, are intrinsic to Nature, not due to the mind's coloured spectacles, so to say. Unfortunately he does not define ' Nature' or indicate the level of experience organization at which his ' Nature' is object of ' knowledgeIf Nature be taken as what the painter or the man of common sense talks of, of course these qualities inhere in it j if ' Nature' means the world as resolved into electrons, &amp;c., it becomes difficult for the scientific realist to read colour and value into it, even if electrons be called organisms. If I am not mistaken, Dr Whitehead is realistic as to electrons; they are for him, that is to say, more than conceptual scaffolding or descriptions of the ' as if' kind. But he has no use for the ether; he thinks the atomic theory (p. 184) is in a state like that of pre-Copernican astronomy with its epicycles; and he repudiates the notion of space-time as self-subsistent. The relativity-theory has been adopted in science, as he says, because it is the simplest or most economical kind of description and dispenses with particular ad hoc descriptions. It will indeed be a break in the continuity of the de velopement of theoretical physics if the electron, which has been ' sup plied' like the ether, and which is already convicted, I believe, of</page><page sequence="6">432 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES suffering distortion, does not follow the ether, as an attempt to rationalize the partly alogical, or to mechanicize the non-mechanical, and to thrust on Nature a kind of explanation to her patience of which there are limits. Reason is one of the ' finished products', heaven-descended and sacrosanct, which have imposed acceptance at their own valuation on philosophers. Roughly speaking, in the comprehensive sense in which we com monly use the word without knowing or caring what we mean by it, reason contains two disparate functionings. There is logical rationality, the reading off of relations such as likeness and numerical diversity, which yield the 'formal' categories of logic and mathematics and underly deduction; and there is the alogical reasonableness which is outcome of the reading in of subjectively derived ' real' categories such as substance and cause, anthropically interpretative, more directly concerned with satisfaction of hope and conational disposition, and presupposed in all induction. The lecturer uses ' reason' without explicitly distinguishing these disparate functions, perhaps without recognition of their diversity. ' Faith in reason', he says, ' is the trust that the ultimate natures of things lie together in a harmony which excludes mere arbitrariness י (p. 26). The harmony here mentioned would seem to be both logico-mathematical and aesthetic; and it is left doubtful whether arbitrariness is negation of the logical or of the teleological. That this faith in reason ' springs from direct inspection of the nature of things as disclosed' in immediate present experience, I cannot accept: I take it to be a late stage in an age-long develope ment, the outcome of trial, error, and pragmatic success, and pre supposing a whole world-theory as much as did Schleiermacher's alleged immediate intuition or 'feeling'. 'Immediate', as I have hinted already, is a veritable pit-fall to all who neglect the deliverances of analytic and genetic psychology when constructing their theory of knowledge. In the stricter and ' logical' sense, our world cannot be rational without remainder; our science of it is what it is just because indivi duals' sensa happen to be what they are. In what sense, then, one may ask, does ' the harmony of logic [lie ] upon the universe as an iron necessity' (p. 27), or in what way can we hope to shew that, though we are unable to discern the laws of Nature to be necessary, it is neces sary that there should be an order of Nature (p. Γ04)? Apparently the answer is that ' detached details, merely in order to be themselves, demand that they should find themselves in a system of things' (p. 26). But apart from our experience of this world and finding it actually to be more or less of an order—it is easy to be wise after the</page><page sequence="7">REVIEWS 433 event—is it not conceivable that the world might have been one in which the ' same' impression never recurred, in which anything might ensue upon anything, and in which all occurrences were as disparate as are heroism and a smell ? There is no necessity a priori why such a chaos might not exist, for the assertion does not involve a contradic tion ; there would then be no logic or science, no universale or timeless objects. To be less fanciful, one might say that Euclid's geometry could not have emerged had there not happened to be solid bodies, and arithmetic could not be applied to actuality if its constituents behaved as does one drop of water when added to another. Again our world might conceivably be a perfect order in being penetrable by mathematical and physical thought, and yet have neither beauty nor purpose or ' meaning'; and it might embody purpose or meaning and be intelligible as one's friend's conduct is, while as irredu cible to regular sequences of events. Philosophers are said in one of these lectures to be rationalists in the sense that they would seek to go behind irreducible facts, eliminate arbitrariness, and demand meaning. And it may be observed that science and theology both seek rationality in the world, and each postulates what it desires to make it wise; only what is wisdom for the one is largely superfluous folly for the other, their respective rationalities, though overlapping, being diverse. Science would find Nature's structural elements and their laws, with indifference to values; theology seeks the world's ' meaning' and takes world structure for scarcely more than stage and scenery for the spiritual drama. Dr Whitehead thinks that God is required by philosophy; not as Prime Mover but as Principle of Concretion. But his thought, at this later stage of his construction, I find difficult to follow, and possibly on that account difficult to accept. In the lecture on Abstrac tion there is much that appears to me reminiscent of Wolff's attempt to conjure the actual out of the so-called possible. But if I here misjudge, I would at least demur to the statement that it is necessary to conceive actuality ' as in essential relation to an unfathomable possibility' (p. 243). ' Concretion' seems to be what the theist would call crea tion; that it involves choice between possible worlds is Leibnizian though anthropomorphic. But Dr Whitehead's discussion of God or the principle of Concretion seems to evince his kinship rather with Spinoza. The Prime Mover or First Cause is objected to early in the book : to invoke Him is but to appeal to an ultimate reality for the removal of our perplexity. And what else, one might ask, are the unseen ' realities ' of physics ? But later (p. 249) a choice is indicated between contentment with alogical determination of the particular, its ' what' and its ' how', and a pressing on to a reality, of which, apparently, the alogical is illusory appearance. VOL. XXVII. F f</page><page sequence="8">434 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES The former alternative involves stopping short at God, the ultimate determinate and determinant, whose existence is ' the ultimate irra tionalityI gather that Dr Whitehead himself does not wish rationali zation or explanation to be carried farther back than to the theistic concept, nor desire to deduce ' why' from ' how ' and ' what'. The concluding sentences of Lecture XI are so condensed as to be not easily intelligible, and I am not certain whether God, as conceived by the author, is ' sufficient י as well as logical reason or ground of all. I am inclined to think that his God is will-less as Spinoza's. With the protest against the bestowal of ' metaphysical compliments' on the Deity by philosophers, I largely concur, if thereby be meant infinitude, perfection (in all its many senses save one), absoluteness, &amp;c. But I should have thought that this is not a mediaeval and modern habit due to anxiety to establish the religious significance of God, but rather one of the evil legacies of great Greece, whose theology was fashioned in the schools, not out of experience and living touch with the world, and for metaphysical rather than for religious purposes. Dr Whitehead observes that it is only when some of these attributes are discarded that theism can possess a theodicy. But I do not see how theodicy is possible on his own theory. He writes : ' If He be conceived as the supreme ground for limitation, it stands in His very nature to divide the Good from the Evil, and to establish Reason " within her dominions supreme This may perhaps mean that God is the ground of ' abso lute' values, but it leaves us confronted with the fact that in God's world there is much that is evil that is not of our making. I trust that I have not misinterpreted Dr Whitehead's thought; but my readers who have not already read this important work will doubt less pass on to it and judge for themselves.1</page></plain_text>
