<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kenneth Seeskin Searching for a Distant God: The Legacy of Maimonides. (New York NY: Oxford University Press, 2000). Pp. Xi + 252. ISBN o 19 512846 X. Admirers of Kenneth Seeskin's writing in philosophy will not be dis appointed with this book. The two main themes of the book are the issue of monotheism and how it is to be understood in Judaism. The most discussed thinker here is undoubtedly Maimonides, which is hardly surprising given his key status on this as on virtually every other issue in Jewish philosophy. Seeskin discusses a number of highly controversial topics in Jewish philosophy, in par ticular the integral role which philosophy plays in Jewish thought, and he is rightly scathing of all those thinkers who erect a huge dichotomy between Athens and Jerusalem, between reason and religion. Then he looks at the problems of under standing what it means for God to be one. The purer the conception of divine unity, the less He resembles a person, and so the more abstracted He is from us. This fits in nicely with Maimonides' constant assault on anthropomorphism, but it does raise the awkward question as to how one can then accept the viability of traditional religion, which does seem to be based on the notion of God as a person to whom one prays and who pays attention to our actions in the world of gen eration and corruption. This runs as a theme throughout the book - how to rec oncile what, ever since Pascal, has come to be known as the God of the philosophers with the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Maimonides seems to prioritize the philosophical understanding of religion over the ordinary con ceptions of the believer, but he does not argue that the latter gets it wrong; on the contrary, he suggests that the unsophisticated believer is on the right road, but perhaps not as far along it as he might be were he to be able to understand Judaism philosophically. Yet it is surely problematic if (presumably, the majority of the) believers are restricted in their understanding of what are, after all, vitally import ant aspects of faith; yet once they come to improve their intellectual grasp of their</page><page sequence="2">Book reviews 239 faith, they may find it impossible to continue to enjoy the same personal relation ship with what will turn out to be a highly abstract and basically incomprehensible principle. Plenty of people are apparently happy to invest their money in ideas which they do not really understand, but how many will be ready to base their entire conception of the universe and themselves on a principle which they do not really understand? One might say cynically that there is no problem here, since these very import ant theoretical questions are of little practical importance to most people, and so they are happy to put up with a lot of vagueness here. But to provide a satisfactory intellectual grasp of two contrasting notions of the deity, that of committed mono theists such as Maimonides, and those of ordinary believers and the thinkers who defend many of their views, such as Buber, is not easy, especially when one can see that both notions have much to commend them. The monotheistic view brings out nicely the unity and otherness of God, but presents us with a concept of God who seems far too distant to be worshipped (hence the title of the book). On the other hand, the more personable conception of God seems to be break every rule about divine transcendence and radical simplicity held by most of the philosophers and theologians in Judaism. This is a conflict which Seeskin con stantly interrogates, and with much success. Maimonides is shown to argue that the ordinary conception of God as a person should be taken as the starting point in religion, and then the believer is encouraged by everything in Judaism to refine his belief progressively until it becomes closer to the correct view. There is one aspect of the book where I think Seeskin's approach is question able, and this concerns his treatment of Hegel. This is very important, since it is the theme of the whole book, namely, the notion of monotheism, which Hegel criticizes as equivalent in the Jewish version to enslavement. Hegel quite rightly argues that the gap between God and humanity, according to Judaism, is infinite and without the possibility of much significant mediation. We are in the position, then, of contemplating a God to whom the only appropriate attitude is awe, and this constitutes alienation and then enslavement. Hegel is very critical of this conception of God, which he suggests is oppressive in its very abstraction, since the total incomprehensibility of God means that His commandments become both entirely obligatory and at the same time incomprehensible. As we know, Hegel far preferred the religion of the Greeks which is at a more advanced stage of the Spirit, and then eventually Christianity offers a way of reconciling humanity with a transcendent God through the intermediary of His son. In Christianity the estrangement or unhappiness of the separation from God comes to an end since the unity of the divine and human natures is accomplished. Now, this is not the place to consider the accuracy of Hegel's characterization of Judaism, let alone any other religion, and as Seeskin says Hegel leaves out a lot of Judaism in his account. But Seeskin accepts that he gets a lot of his description right, in particular the significance in Judaism of the enormous gap between us</page><page sequence="3">240 Book reviews and the Almighty. What Hegel gets wrong, Seeskin claims, is that the law is a burden and was not created out of love for God's creation. Yet Seeskin suggests that Maimonides showed that all the laws, even the ceremonial laws, have a rationale, and so they have not been imposed on Jews by a distant God as entirely arbitrary aspects of His unbridled power. Well, it is true that Maimonides suggests that all the laws have a rationale, but he also accepts that given our distance (that concept again) from the conditions in which the law was originally produced, we may not understand its point, and yet we are nonetheless obliged to follow it, however difficult it may be to understand its relevance to contemporary conditions. The blank cheque which Maimonides gives the Almighty here may be appro priate, but it does not help escape the charge of putting the issuers of the cheque in a rather humiliating position. Seeskin says that Hegel entirely ignores the covenantal aspect of the relationship between the Jews and God, but does this really help his case? For one thing, there are frequently references in Judaism to doing before hearing what it is that one is to do (Exodus, 24.7), the idea that the Jews accepted the Torah even before they knew what it was. Secondly, it is not clear what an agreement actually is when it is made with a being who is so different from us as God. If Maimonides is right and there is no comparison at all between our use of language to describe our world and God, then what does it mean to say that He has an agreement with his people? Finally, Seeskin argues that it is a mistake to emphasize the total obedience of the main Jewish thinkers, since they frequently argued with God and questioned His decisions. This is true, but then they just as often carried out His orders without question. One thinks in particular of Abraham not once questioning God for demanding the sacrifice of Isaac, a request whose difficulty the Almighty emphasizes by describing Isaac several times as 'your only son'. Yet when Sodom and Gomorrah were under threat, Abraham spoke up for their innocent inhabitants. Hegel would emphasize the aqedah, Seeskin the plea on behalf of the innocent citizens of the evil cities. This brings out the difficulty, if not the impossibility, of attempting to characterize a religion under just a few general categories which are supposed to express its essence and so 'what it is all about'. Instead of criticizing Hegel's description of Judaism and seeking to replace it with something equally questionable, Seeskin might have used Maimonides' ac count of law to develop a notion of precisely that Versohnung or reconciliation with God which Hegel demands of a free people. What reconciles the Jews with their distant God is law; this is the main topic, after all, of Jewish thought. Living in accordance with the Torah is to live in accordance with law, and that law is not to be blindly followed and accepted, since law cannot be blindly followed and accepted. This is because it always calls for interpretation, explanations as to how it might be applied to previously unconsidered cases, and so on. As we know from the famous dispute on law between Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua (Baba Metzia</page><page sequence="4">Book reviews 241 59b), judgement on these issues is not in heaven (Deuteronomy, 30.12) but has to be determined by human beings using their reason and knowledge. We can find here also a route to answer Hegel's claim that Judaism leaves the world entgottert (deprived of God), since the divine transcends the world of generation and cor ruption so overwhelmingly. This is not a claim which Seeskin considers, and it is surely an important part of Hegel's attack on Judaism, that it so emphasizes the distance of God that none of His divinity can actually seep into the material world. The use of law as a counter-example to this critique gets us over the hurdle of a distant and incomprehensible God. He remains distant, but the use of law can allow us to be creative in carrying out the task He has set us, and can sketch out for us a way of life which is both feasible for us as mortal beings and yet which also recognizes a basis in what is over us, in God. It is not only to law that we can turn for Versohnung. Prayer is also highly relevant here, since if Maimonides is right, then we need to interrogate the literal meaning of prayer. Where prayer tends to represent God as like a person, we need to consider the images of God which we call up and see how we might gradually replace them with more sophisticated and accurate views. The emphasis here should be on the gradual nature of this process, something which God could of course carry out instantly, but we are left with the task of perfecting ourselves and our thought, since only in this way can we acquire merit and realize our natures as creatures created in the image of God but living in a very different environment. Although God is distant from us, it is not true that we have no scope for coming closer to Him, or reconciling us to the gap between us. The processes we use here are the traditional Jewish processes of law and prayer, through interrogating and refining our ways of living and speaking. This is a direction in which Seeskin could have gone, as opposed to saying defiantly to Hegel that 'the logic of monotheism is either/or and no purpose is served by trying to overcome it' (174). The task of overcoming the gap between us and God is indeed not one which we can entirely bridge, yet it does not follow that we should not set out to bridge it, in so far as we can, as the Mishnah says 'It is not up to you to complete the task, but nor is it for you to desist entirely from it'. For a thinker like Hegel such a persistent gap is a sign of tragedy, but we have seen that there are the resources in Maimonides to resolve it satisfactorily. It all comes down to what one thinks Versohnung really means. If Seeskin is right and Hegel is insisting on the gap between us and God being entirely overcome, then this is certainly not something which Maimonides would contemplate. But if Versohnung means not so much 'overcome' but rather 'reconcile' then progress is possible on the lines Maimonides describes. Although on this particular issue I have argued that Seeskin does not really do justice to his material, the quality of the argument and analysis in the book is first class throughout and the reader will be frequently stimulated by the approach which the author adopts. He has a real mastery of the topic, both the ancient and medieval aspects of it, together with its modern developments, and his style is</page><page sequence="5">242 Book reviews entirely without mystification or redundancy. In short, the book is a pleasure to read and sets standards of exposition on this issue which it will be difficult to follow. OLIVER LEAMAN University of Kentucky</page></plain_text>
