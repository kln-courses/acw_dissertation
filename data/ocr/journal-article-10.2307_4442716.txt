<plain_text><page sequence="1">REPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOUR IN UNGULATES, A. F. Fraser, 202 pp., 55s, Academic Press, New York, 1968. In 167 pages of text, the author real- izes that he cannot treat his subject ex- haustively and thus only touches on the reproductive behavior of 66 species of ungulates in 10 different families. Refreshingly, he approaches his sub- ject from a behavioral standpoint but supports such disturbing statements as the study of animal behavior "has be- come one of the most exact sciences," "anthropomorphism is not without its merits," and "anecdotal accounts of behavior have virtually no place in modern science." With these statements, I take strong exception. While each section of the book has internal con- sistency, comparisons between different parts lead to uncertainties as to the author's meaning. For example, in one section he indicates that "visual stimuli perhaps play a greater role in directing reproductive behavior than any other single form of stimulation," but when dealing with the olfactory sense, he says that it is "clear that olfaction is fundamental in the stimulation of re- productive responses." Nowhere is this apparent discrepancy resolved. In his discussion of synapses, the author first indicates, "Synapses are then the points of contact between neurons." Later he reinforces this idea by stating, "Syn- apses connect neurons." Despite such ambiguity and lack of clarity, the book does contain valuable information about ungulate reproduc- tion and, if ready critically, will have value for those seeking comparative information on the breeding behavior of large animals.
