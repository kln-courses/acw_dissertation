<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Ancient Art of Northern Asia. By Anatoly I. Martynov. Trans. and eds. Demitri B. Shimkin and Edith M. Shimkin. Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1991. xvii, 301 pp. Maps. Figures. Index. Hard bound. The text proper of this work occupies a little more than one third of the 300 pages, while the maps and the illustrations take up more than half. There are six chronolog- ically arranged chapters starting with a short discussion of the "Art of the Mammoth Hunters" followed by "Sacred Animals and Solar Symbols" of the Neolithic peoples. The third chapter deals with the art of the Eneolithic and Bronze Age peoples. It is followed by a treatise on Scytho-Siberian art. Chapter 5 deals with the effects on native art of the "Great Migration of Peoples in Northern Asia." The final chapter, "The Tree of Life," has as its theme the expression of complexes that had their origin in the near east (according to the author) and only later spread northwards. The maps form an essential part of the work. They help the interested but perhaps uninstructed reader understand the complex history of a region that encompasses about 11.5 percent of the world's land area and better than 60 percent of that of Asia. The maps also locate the important sites and delimit the cultures both areally and chronologically. Siberian Paleolithic art is stylistically quite different from western European Pa- leolithic art, particularly in what Martynov terms "portable" art, that is, three-dimlen- sional anthropomorphic, zoomorphic and bird representations. The differences are</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 595 particular-ly notable in the repr-esentationi of the female for-mi. Contrary to European statuettes, the Siber-ian ones do not have clear-ly overemiphasized for-mls. The majority of them ar-e well proportioned, thalt is, parts of their- bodies have the coi-i-ect mass, making themii appear relatively lean. Some of them h1ave distinctive or-namiien-tal incisecl patterIns representing clothinig. Compared to Eur-opean engravings of animals (say, mamm-iiotlhs) and sculpturecl r-epr-esentationis of birds, the Siberian engravings, plrimar- ily fr-om Malta and Buret, ar-e quite r-ealistic. Becaause of the fragmentary nature of Paleolithic art for-ms, it is difficult to interlpret tlhemn. Thus ther-e are many interpre- tations, includin-g those assignecl to r-itual-miiytlhological traditions. Against the backgr-ound of r-ealistic Paleolithic art, Neolithic art tencls to be or- namiental, clecorative ancl symnbolic in those ar-eas of nor-tlher-n- Asia that turln-ecd to agr-icultuLre and herdin-g. However, in the ver-y north of nor-thlern- Asia, the "hunting ar-t" theme r-emain-ecd very ImuLchl alive. Also ther-e ar-e funiclamiien-tal clifferences between the Neolithic art of Siber-ia proper and that of the Amul- River-Far East zone. Ancl, as may be expected, ther-e ar-e cliffer-ences in art styles anld subjects that ar-e tiecl to the living condition-s of peoples dwelling in Mountain valleys, steppes and cleser-ts. Emii- phasis is on r-ealistically portrayed gamne animials. Por-trayals of hullmanis are relatively -ar-e and inacculate. Often they ar-e given animal tr-aits. Petroglyphs occupy a special place in the Neolithic and later- art of nor-therin Asia. In gener-al, cliffs on whliclh art subjects-again mnostly animiials-were engraved or peckecl were consicderecd dwelling places of totemic animiials. Br-onze Age art is evaluated imostly on the basis of pottery style and decoration. These two criteria differentiate the arts of the steppes and for-ests. Muclh has been wr-itten about Scytho-Siberian art. Martynov Clistingulislhes several developmental regions of this animilal style, notwithstanding its comioiilon aritistic forllms- the r-eindcleer-, r-ami ancl feline predator. Of the seven clevelopmentlal r-egions, Martynov evaluates two, the Altay anic Tagar. The ear-liest examlples of the Scytho-Siberian animal style wer-e influenced by Hittite-Assyrian anic Irano-Achaemenicl art. By the beginning of the first mlillenn-iumli BC the style mlotifs wer-e rewor-kecd by incorporating local peculiarities, including the recasting of local aniimals, in n-ew styles. Thle flowering of the clynamic Scytho-Siber-ian animal style took place in the fifth to thii-cl centur-ies BC The great migr-ation- of peoples in northern Asia brought aboUt fundamental chan-ges in its ethnic composition- and econom-iy. Martynov's brief histor-ical review of tribal and national states form-lecd durinig the first mlillennlium AD ancl slightly earlier is helpful and is a masterful encapsulation. Dur-inig this periodl the animilal style con- tinues but is again modifiecl to include additional animilals imlpor-tanit to the nomllacds, namiiely, horses and wild asses, as well as birds. Also, it has a less gr-aceful style. Un- derstan-din-gly, the hor-se replaces the reinideer- as suIn symilbol bearer altlhouiglh imlagles of rein-deer as hunitin-g and her-ding fetishes persisted into the ninieteentlh century among some of the rem-ote tribes of Siberia. Durinig the Turkic period of the first millenni-ium-i AD, the style anic subject matter of the art chan-ges again and reflects, particular-ily in the petroglyphs, the massive battles anic hunting scenes of the timnes. The art expresses conistan-t motioni, but it is car-elessly executed and dispropor-tionate. An interesting art developml-ent concern-is the so-called Tashtyk burial masks. Clay was modeled on the faces of the deceased before cremation. Thus they wer-e iniciviclual portraits. Analyses of the masks indicated that the early crypts containied Eur-opoicls. Later they are mnixed Mongoloid-EuL-opoid, revealing the penetrationi of the Monigols from the east. The Tree of Life, knowni to peoples of southwester-n Asia and later- nior-tlher-ni Asia over millen-nia, represen-ted to them-l the clying andc reawakeninig of nature. In nior-tlher-n Asia this also pertain-ed to game animilals whose exaggerated hor-n-s or antler-s were -endered as "ttrees of life." Anatoly I. Martynov's "The Ancien-t Art of Nor-therin Asia" is a wor-k of significanice to the histor-ian of art and studen-ts of art in general. TIhe reaclinig andcl interlpretation of the work could have been enhanced by referen-ces, eit.her by tlhe autho-r or tran-slator-, to a numiiber of articles that were translated anic published in the 1960s in the series</page><page sequence="3">596 Slavic Review Anthropology of the North: Translations fiom Russian Sources. A. P. Oklacdnikov's The History of Yakutia before Its Incoiporation into the Ruissian State was also ti-anslated into Englislh. It contains importanit descriptions of the "tr-ee of life." A ser-ious error of accreditation occurs in a passage on the renownled Paleolithic site of Malta. Even befor-e the discovery by A. P. Oklaclnikov in the 1940s anic his student hu. A.
