<plain_text><page sequence="1">Russian Studies 7i5 LANGUAGE By A. E. Pennington, Fellow of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford i. General The year's work is dominated by two events ? the seventieth birthday of Professor B. O. Unbegaun, and the sixth inter national congress of Slavists in Prague. Five vols are dedicated to Professor Unbegaun: Studies in Slavic Linguistics and Poetics in honor of Boris 0. Unbegaun, N.Y., -L. (abbrev. Unbegaun Fest.); AIPS, xviii-xix, a truly international tribute; Melbourne Slavic Studies, 2 and B. O. Unbegaun, Selected Papers in Slavonic and Russian Philology, Oxford U.P., 1969. Congress volumes, other than special editions of journals, will be referred to as follows: Amer. Contributions = American Con tributions to the Sixth International Congress of Slavists, I, Linguistic Contributions, ed. H. Kucera. The Hague-Paris; Dutch Con tributions = Dutch Contributions to the VI International Congress of Slavicists, ed. A. G. F. van Holt, The Hague-Paris; Ceskoslovenske predndlky ?

Texts and Paleography The publication of private docs is continued by S. I. Kotkov with A. S. Oreshnikov and I. S. Filippova. Their MocKoecKan demean u dumoean nucbMenuocmb XVII ee%a, AH CCCP HPH, is of especial interest, being restricted to one area. M. P. Alekeseev, Cjioeapu unocmpauHUX H3UK06 e pyccKOM a36yKoemKe XVII e., AH CCCP, 11,4, gives an introduction, text, transcription, comm. and photographs of a Dutch-English-Russian glossary. Some of his interpretations are doubtful, e.g. raip? nHT, Bor Ha noMO*n&gt; must be cGod speed', not 'God's pity'; bhahh khh6t&gt;, 6ah4hht&gt; cmht&gt; must be 'villain knave', not 'well, enough'. T. Van den Baar, Dutch Contributions, gives an account of the C. G. Wolf Russian-German MS lexicon of 1731 at Leyden. It is a great pity he apparently does not plan to publish the full</page><page sequence="2">716 Russian Studies text. S. O. Visots'ki, JJaemopycKi uanucu Cocfiii KuiecbKoi XI-XIV cm., 6Ha\ Kiev, transcribes 15 further fascinating graffitti, with 9 photographs. R. F. Christian, SIRev, xlvi, 106, transcribes and translates a routine charter of privilege of 1693. L. P. Zhukovskaja in UaMnmuuKu dpeenepyccKOU nucbMenmcmu makes a most important contribution by classifying 500 MSS of the full aprakos Gospel, and urging that linguistic investiga tion must be based on such typological classification. In the same coll., V. V. Vinogradov examines a 13th c. MS of Mumue Caeeu OceRygeHHOzo and A. S. L'vov peels layers skilfully from the Peub cfiujiococfia. The new ed. of M36opnuK 1076 z. is used for linguistic study by H. G. Lunt in Unbegaun Rest. V. A. Petrova, IlajieozpacfiuHecKuu anbdoM, Leningrad Univ., is a course book containing 64 photographs of non-literary Russian MSS from I3th-i8th c. M. N.

Posthumous ed. of Tikhomirov's brief and not always consistent description of his 500 MSS, i4th-20th c. 3. Phonology historical. Pride of place must go to V. V. Ivanov, Hcmopmecmn cfiowjiozuR pyccnozo H3hiKa. Ivanov attempts the first systematic description of the phonological development of Russian. He deals with the earliest historical state and the changes caused by the palatalization of half-soft consonants and by the loss of reduced vowels. In two arts, he elaborates individual points: in IIpo6jieMu coeemcKou jiuuzeucmuKu, Moscow Univ., the function of phonological opposition in lexicon, and in AIPS, xviii, the phonological implications of tsokan'e. V. I. Georgiev, etc., 06w&gt;ecjiaeRHCKoe 3Haueme npodjieMbi oKanbR, BAH, Hh-t 6oArapcKoro H3tiKa, Sofia: F. P. Filin contributes the chapter on East Slavonic and concludes, with some hesitation, that akarfe and okarCe develop in 8th-gth c. from Common Slavonic *a?. H. Schelesniker, WSJ, xiv, follows a similar line in considering CS ^ it) art, *(t)alt groups. K. V. Gorshkova, in IJpodjieMu coepeMeunou Jiumeucmmu, Moscow Univ., surveys recent works and stresses the various factors that may influence sound change. F. P. Filin, AIPS, xviii,</page><page sequence="3">Language 717 returns to the problem of i and distinguishes six East Slavonic zones, with considerable fluidity in the early period, especially in Novgorod. J. C. Ferrell, Unbegaun Fest., defends a system with very few phonemes for East Slavonic before the loss of the jers. S. B. Bernstein, in Cuae. n3UK03Hame, shows the presence of contraction in north and even central Great Russian dialects. P. S. Kuznetsov, AIPS, xviii, demonstrates the complete absorption of foreign [f ] as the pair [f ] [f'] in Old Russian. A rare book is B. A. Uspenski, ApxauuecKan cucmeMa u,epKo enocjiaeHHCKozo npou3HOweHun, Moscow Univ., rotaprinted, 650 copies. He discusses the characteristics of singing and recitative pronunciation of Old Believer sects and the implications for the history of liturgical pronunciation. More studies are needed in this much neglected field and one hopes Uspenski will continue. modern language. The fourth revd ed. of R. I. Avanesov, PyccKoe Jiumepamypuoe npou3nouieme, includes among other modifications, an account of the continuing loss of assimilative palatalization since the third ed. of 1958. C. L. Drage, SIRev, xlvi, 107, shows differences in the use of assimilation between generations. R. Jakobson, ?70, xvii, 3, notes the especial resistance of the recent phonemes /v/ ~ /f/ to assimila tive voicing and unvoicing. stress. A. V. Superanskaja, Ybapenue e 3auMcmeo6aHHbix cjioeax e coepeMeunoM pyccKOM H3UKe, AH CCCP HH. A morpho phonological study. She concludes that, apart from indeclin ables, borrowed words take their stress from comparable native words. A glossary lists some 6,000 words. In the same area, M. Shapiro, Amer. Contributions, attempts to set up more precise morphological criteria governing the stress of borrowings. P. Garde, AIPS, xviii, emphasizes the dependence of stress on morpheme. D. S. Worth, Unbegaun Fest., decides that jiwdoeb, eoutb etc., have basically fixed final stress. 4. Morphology historical. S. P. Lopushanskaja, Ouepm no ucmopuu zjiazojibnozo (fjopMOo6pa3oeaHUR, I.

Her material is very interesting; it is regrettable that the lay-out is not clear and there is no index. Her discussion of the compound future is disappointing. J. Kurylowicz, AIRS, xviii, shows the influence of the athematic present on the -tt&gt; agglutination to aorists with root circumflex. W. M. Markow, SIO, xvii, 3, suggests that Jiucmbn, etc. is the true plural of nucmbe, etc. E. Sekaninova, Geskoslovenske pfedndsky, compares Slovak and Russian prefixes for distributive verbs. modern language. N. M. Shanski, Ouepm no pyccnoMy cjioeoo6pa3oeamw, Moscow Univ., extends his discussion of principles and practice. He over-indulges in polemic and his bibl. is maddeningly listed in the order it occurs in the text. R. I. Likhtman, VYa, 2, considers aflfixless word formation, and R. L'Hermite, RSI, 47, recent tendencies in verb formation. W. Sperber, ?Sl, xiii, 4, tabulates grammatical features of predicated words. J. E. Allen III, Unbegaun Fest., using a computerized sample of 1,356,528 verbs, fails to improve on Shevelov's statement of the t:sc, d:zd alternation. The morpho phonemic alternation vowel ~ zero is discussed by D. S. Worth, IJSLP, xi. A. Boguslawski, SIO, xvii, 3, perceptively delimits the use of the -ee comparative adjective in Russian. M. O. Mallkova, SlavS, 3, considers the semantic field of adjectives in mnogo-. 5. Syntax historical. V. I. Borkovski, ed., CpaemmeJibHO-ucmopmecKuu cunmaKcuc eocmomocJiaemcKux n3UK06. i, Tunu npocmozo npedjioytcemn, by the ed., 11, Vneuu npedjiootcemn, by ten different authors. The work is important, though it suffers from lack of index, statistical evidence and clarity in lay-out. The divergence in syntax of the East Slavonic languages, which is minimized, is placed in the 15th c. V. I. Borkovski, in Cjiae. H3UK03Hame, fills a gap in the book by discussing impersonal and nominative sentences in old Russian, and in AIRS, xviii, incomplete sentences. V. I. Troitski, OmnocumejibHoe noduuHeme e mune pycckou nucbMeunocmu XVI-XVII ee, Kazan', has some very good material, which he does not always analyse sufficiently. A. Gallis, AIPS, xviii, finds an intriguing use of the gen-acc. for metrical feet in the 18th c. The history of the study of Russian word order is reviewed by G. G. Pocheptsov, IJSLP, xi, and a</page><page sequence="5">Language 719 contribution to this study, stressing the importance of the information-bearing structure is made by S. 2aza, in Ceskoslovenske pfednds'ky. modern language. V. V. Babajtseva, OdnococmaeHue npedjiOMcemn e coepeMCHHOM pyccxoM M3UKe, brings clarity into theoretical problems of classification, taking account of the logical and semantic basis of constructions as well as gram matical expression. R. Zimek, Melbourne Slavic Studies, 2, attempts a theoretical classification of basic productive types of simple sentence. H. Kflzkova, Slav, xxxvii, 1, looks at the double negative constructions in Czech and Russian. V.Kucera, SlavS, 3, 1, distinguishes three types of acc. of time. Modern grammatical theory, with some illustration from Russian, is the subject of the five articles in Hccjieboeamn no odiujcu meopuu zpaMMamuKu, AH CCCP HJL Very little Western material after 1961 is included. ?67, xih, contains a number of arts specifically on Russian; among them are: K. Buttke, xih, 2, uses probability theory to examine the structure of a text; G. Walther, ib., examines the problems for generative grammar to specify rules regulating word order; R. Conrad, ib., gives a clear account of some interrogative deep structures, and R. Ruzicka, ib., using deep-structure diagrams, proposes a model for the genus verbi of modern Slavonic. E. Mai, ?67, xih, 4, finds no syntactic grounds for a single class of adjectives; O. Kade, ib., sees the application of transformational analysis to translation technique in gerund constructions. F. Papp, SSH, xiv, claims to apply generative grammar to modern Russian, but provides a useful summary of recent work. T. P. Lomtev, in Cjiae. H3UK03Hame, argues that the study of syntax must be based on the study of word structure. L. R. Mickleson, Amer. Contributions, attempts to demonstrate that impersonal sentences are most satisfactorily handled by modern grammatical theory. G. Jacobsson, ScSl, xiv, produces pro legomena to the study of gerunds and active participles in journalese. Passive constructions in Paustovski are subjected to transformational analysis by M. Travers, Melbourne Slavic Studies, 2, and passive participles in modern Russian to a quantitive-stylistic analysis by G. Balaz, SlavS, 3, 3. aspect. O. P. Rassudova, ynompedjieme eudoe zjiazojia e pyccKOM H3UKe {dnn uHOcmpanuee), Moscow Univ., is a practical</page><page sequence="6">720 Russian Studies handbook for teachers. It is not always consistent method ologically and has no index, but the extensive examples should prove useful. J. Veyrenc, AIPS, xviii, notes possible change of aspect, depending on whether the action is referred to in speech or writing. C. H. Van Schooneveld, Amer. Contributions, suggests that a determinate-indeterminate opposition, using the secondary Imperfectives in -afj-ivaf is widespread in modern Russian. I. S. Pospelov, in IIpo6jieMU coepeMeuuou jiumeucmuKu, Moscow Univ., investigates tense and aspect forms, using active, not passive grammar. His conclusions are not remarkable. 6. Vocabulary general. In Cnae. H3UK03Hame, N. I. Tolstoy approaches the problem of distinctive features in semantics by tabularizing on a semantic grid and discussing 38 sememes of the Slavonic *dajb. S. N. Shmelev, ib., considers factors which may have caused the East Slavonic languages to develop their vocabulary along similar lines without direct inter-influence. P. L. Garvin, Amer. Contributions, defends machine translation research by showing how it can contribute to the classification of lexical units. O. S. Akhmanova, AIPS, xviii, uses Russian material in a general discussion of homonymy, and V. V. Vinogradov, Cnae. H3UK03Hame, surveys homonyms, homomorphs and homoforms in Russian. M. V. Panova, JleKcma coepeMenuozo pyccxozo Jiumepamypnozo H3UKa, AH CCCP UPK, is a sociological rather than a linguistic study. foreign borrowings. L. P. Krysin, MH0H3umue cjioea e coepeMeunoM pyccuoM H3UKe, AH CCCP HPil, reviews borrowings in five periods of the 20th c. Much useful material, especially from the later periods, but his index is not full. The strength of native word formation types, causing caiques even from closely related languages, is shown by I. V. Isacenko, AIPS, xviii, and Chr. Fleckenstein, ?Sl, xiii, 2. D. Gerhardt, AIPS, xviii, makes an inventory of exclamatory noises for different pre dicaments and suggests Ei, Ei, Ei! may come from German. Czech and Moravian borrowings in early Russian literature are looked at by A. S. LVov in Cnae. n3UK03Hame. L. Muller, AIPS, xviii, shows the Western origin of a formula in the</page><page sequence="7">Language 721 Sermon on Law and Grace and suggests Ilarion may have escorted Anna to France in 1048. Russian words in i6th-c. English sources are listed and discus sed by H. Leeming, SIRev, xlvi, 106 and xlvii, 108 (Jan. 1969). S, S. Lunden, ScSl, xiv, produces some further evidence for the common sources of West European Russian vocabularies. individual etymologies. Several contributions in AIPS, xviii: V. V. Vinogradov on nodeuz; A. Vaillant on cum = tower and KyprbJibKh = model; N. A. Nilsson sees the origin of 'bridge' in 6upm, 6upwu; V. Kiparsky shows the Pskov 6ypenujiHUKu to be magicians, probably Baltic; M. Altbauer looks at the Hebrew origin of 'Oyxopyzeem nab mMaMu\ In Unbegaun Fest., E. Stankiewicz links CKorm to CKonumu = castrate and R. L. Lencek compares Russian and Slovene cupa, cupus. A. V. Solov'ev, IJSLP, xi, makes a good case for wojiomh = cojlomh ? an earth rampart. H. C. Sorensen, ScSl, xxiv, returns to the problem of Rus'. 7. Formation of the Literary Language B. O. Unbegaun, RSI, 47, expounds his view that modern lit. Russian is a direct descendent of Russian Church Slavonic. A considerable amount of work has been provoked on this topic. In two arts, OSP, n. ser., 1, and Amer. Contributions, G. Huttl Worth takes issue with him, coining the term 'neo-slavonicism' for new forms using Church Slavonic morphemes, but not borrowed from ChSl. In Unbegaun Fest., she shows the ChSl origin of many abstract verbal expressions; G. Shevelev ib., urges a comprehensive study of the vocabulary at different periods, using both personal and computer analysis; S. C. Gardiner ib., finds that the participial system is the only morphological and syntactic feature of ChSl used without a break and in a great variety of styles and contexts in Russian literature. K. Jordal, ScSl, xiv, lists Greek borrowings and agrees that ChSl is the basis of modern Russian. On the literary language in the early period (to 15th a), T. N. Kandaurova makes two contributions in IlaMxmHUKu dpeenepyccKou nucbMennocmu, ed. V. V. Vinogradov, AH CCCP HPil. She finds in pre-15th c. texts that polnoglasie forms appear in direct speech and for orthographical convenience 46</page><page sequence="8">722 Russian Studies at the end of lines. In the same coll. I. S. Ulukhanov finds that of verbs with prefix pre-, only those very frequent in ChSl penetrate pre-15th c. gramoty; V. F. Dubravina attempts to isolate Hellenisms accepted in 12th c. Russian and K. I. Khodova makes a promising beginning on the problem of establishing the lexical norm. In PyccKan ucmopuuecKan Jietccu kojiozur, ed. S. G. Barkhudarov, etc., the same topic is pursued by A. S. L/vov, T. N. Kandaurova, O. U. Malkova and G. N. Lukina. Lukina moves towards the important suggestion that ChSl and Russian variants are used indiscriminately in many genres until the second wave of South Slavonic influence. The vol. includes discussions of individual developments: V. V. Veselitski, omnocumejibHuu, adcojiwmnuu, N. I. Tarabasova, necmpumb, Yu. A. Romanov, (fiuxojioz, N. P. Pankratova, emdoMo, etc., N. V. Churmaeva, nucapb, V. M. Vomperski, paeuuna, A. N. Dobromyslov, 6pamb. The 18th c. is the subject of two colls: Yu. S. Sorokin, ed., Upo-geccu cfiopMupoeamn mkcuku pyccKozo Jiumepamypuozo H3UKa [pm KanmeMupa do KapaM3uua), M-H, AH CCCP HPH. Sorokin makes a plea for a wider selection of sources; E. E. Birzhakova defends the Academy's calendars as a reliable source of scientific terminology; G. P. Knjaz'kova considers the wide use of dialect words, V. V. Zamkova reviews the vocabulary of metallurgy and L. A. Vojnova of the emotions. Among other contributions, I. A. Vasilevskaja's typology of formal doublets in borrowings (aicyji, aKyjia, etc.) should be noted. The other, PyccKan jiumepamypHan peub e XVIII e, AH CCCP HPH, is rather disappointing; the arts are mostly narrowly based, but do serve to illustrate the extension of vocabulary and phraseology and their fining down into a literary style. The modern literary language is considered in Pa3eumue (fiyHKUuomjibHbix cmuneu coepeMenuozo pyccKozo si3biKa, AH CCCP HPil. T. T. Vinokur gives a lively illustration of the fusion of colloquial and literary speech to produce 'HarrHOHaAbHafl o6nxo4HaH peW; O. A. Laptereva surveys the development of scientific terminology, K. A. Loginova that of officialese (optimistically) and O. B. Sirotina that of journalese. Bonpocu jieKcwcu u c$)pa3eojiozuu coepeMeunozo pyccKozo M3UKa, Poctobckhh Ha-^OHy Toe. ne^. Hh-t, Rostov, is a collection of very brief arts on various aspects of the modern language.</page><page sequence="9">Language 723 8. Individual Authors T. Eekman, Slovo, xvii, 1967, gives J. Krizanic credit for his pioneer study of Russian and Serbo-Croat. In the collection Llpoujecchi cfiopMupoeamn mkcuku pyccnoeo jiumepamypuoeo x3UKa, AH CCCP HPK, V. V. Veselitski discusses some abstract words popularized by A. Kantemir, and V. V. Vinogradov makes interesting observations on Karamzin's developing sense of style. C. Schwenke, SIRev, xlvi, 107, reviews dialectisms, real and invented, in Leskov's prose. N. A. Nilsson. SCSI, xiv, gives an account, without much discussion, of some of Chekhov's usage of special vocabulary. M. Peter, SSH, xiv, discusses, rather ineffectually, archaisms in Majakovski's early poetry. The second vol. of Pyccmn Peub, AH CCCP HPK, contains five popular arts on Gor'ki's language. 9. Dialects K. V. Gorshkova, Oueptcu ucmopmecKOu duajieicmojioeuu Ceeepmu Pycu, is a solid and scholarly phonological study and re classification of the dialects of Novgorod, Pskov and Rostov Suzdal' in the nth-i5th cs. The collection of arts Cnoeo e pyccmx napodnux eoeopax, AH CCCP HPH, includes an account of the extensive penetration of dialect words into the literary language by L. I. Balakhanova, illustrated by O. G. Porokhova by words with root blag-, but partially invalidated by F. P. Sorokoletov's discussion of the difficulty of distinguishing dialect from literary words. Z. Stieber, RoczSl, xxix, 1, continues the demonstration by Z. Gluskina, SIO, xv, that the second palatalization of velars was not a general Russian phenomenon. The dat. loc. pyice, etc., would be the reassertion of a native feature. F. I. Filin, Cms. H3biK03Hame, poses some theoretical problems in reconstructing ancient Russian dialects. 10. Onomastics In AIPS, xviii, M. Woltner gives a lively catalogue of dogs' names in Russian lit., arranging them by derivation; J. Schutz provides respectable origins for Veles and Svarog, and D. Tschizewskij discusses astronomical names (mostly Ukrainian). F. Gorner, ?Sl, xxxiv, 1, pursues his study of ethnic names,</page><page sequence="10">724 Russian Studies finding a 20th c. tendency to generalize the suffix -ets. V. Vascenco, RSlav, xvi, looks at anthropomorphic suffixes to Russian surnames. In ScSl, xiv, B. Kleiver suggests Scandinavian *Bqlkestinn as the origin of UojiKumrnHb, and K. R. Schmidt doubts whether there is a pre-iith c. Scandinavian influence bringing vargg to Novgorod place-names. 11. Dictionaries S. I. Golovashchuk, ed., PociucKo-YKpaiHCbKuu Cjiobhuk, 3 vols, AH YkPCP, Kiev, is an extensive dictionary with 120,000 entries and a considerable amount of phraseological illustration. The third vol. ? V ? of N. M. Shanski's full and readable dmuMOJiozmecKuu cnoeapb pyccKozo H3UKa, Moscow Univ., has appeared; also the third vol. ? BAa3HHinKa-BHinyTKa ? of Cnoeapb pyccmx napoduux zoeopoe, AH CCCP HPil (CAOBapHLift ceKTop), ed. F. P. Sorokoletov, which lists some new sources. The project for the Old Russian dictionary is criticized for inconsistencies and misinterpretations by V. V. Vinogradov, VTa, 1. Two dictionaries in the field of synonyms: Z. E. Alek sandrova, Cnoeapb cuuouuMoe pyccxozo H3UKa, may function as a brief thesaurus. The differences between so-called synonyms are not well explained or illustrated. Yu. A. Berchikov and M. S. Panjasheva, Tpyduue cnyuau ynompedjiemx odnoKopeuHux cjioe pyccKozo H3UKa. CAOBapt-cnpaBOHHHK, has more limited scope but usefully supplements the above. It includes examples of 'incorrect5 usage from speech, newspapers and even literary works. Z. Golab, A. Heinz, K. Polahski, Slownik terminologii jezykoznawczej, Wa, is more than it claims. It is the fullest general linguistics dictionary to date, including brief descrip tions of theories and languages, indexes in English, French, German and Russian, and brief biographies of selected linguists. 12.
