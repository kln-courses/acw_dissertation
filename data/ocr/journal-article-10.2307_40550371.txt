<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Historicity of Archeaology: historical time in foucault" s The Order of things Rajesh Sampath A great problem which befuddles contemporary theory is how one understands the temporality of "postmodern" critical evaluations of modern forms of knowledge. In this article I will explore the historical status of one such critical project: Michel Foucault's "archaeologies." One can study the "historic" nature of archaeology by analyzing Foucault's early works and their effects on modern historical epistemology. How does archaeology transform our philosophical assumptions of time, change, and the problem of origins? Despite the fact that archaeology incites certain transformations within the present conditions of theoretical knowledge, the archaeological perspective denies the transcendental desire of dialectical thought to overcome the end of history within history. The archaeologist does not seek to establish the essence of history as if history has come to a complete stop in the present, where its truth awaits discovery. Then again, the archaeologist does not assume that historical time progresses from one present to another; he does not observe time's undisturbed passage from a neutral vantage point beneath its anonymous flow. What then is time for archaeology? The relation between archaeology and the future constitutes a critical dimension of the historicity of archaeology. The future is linked to the theoretical fate of archaeology. Foucault's archaeological method offers the possibility of a different notion of history that is not grounded in linear time. A "new" conception of history hovers on the horizon (Foucault 1972, 5). The historicity of archaeology reveals that the future plays a fundamental role in determining history and the "event" of a new theory of history. Yet the category of the future has @ Symplokê Vol. 3, No. 2 (1995) ISSN 1069-0697, 135-163.</page><page sequence="2">136 Rajesh Sampath The Historicity of Archeaology concealed its face behind the mask of the "otherness" of the past.1 Hence I will turn to the past - the early works of Foucault - in order to decipher a sign of the "future" of the archaeological method. When studying the problem of time and history, Foucault's The Order of Things: an Archaeology of the Human Sciences is significant.2 Part II of this text describes the conditions of existence, the structures of perception, and the linguistic techniques which animate the human sciences in the "modern episteme" (217).3 By revealing certain "epistemic" conditions, Foucault historicizes the human sciences; he elucidates their discontinuity and difference from forms of knowledge in the "classical episteme" (1973, xxii).4 This discontinuity exceeds the representational power of the sciences when they try to explain their origins, development, and history (1973, 344). The sciences of "Man," which include the field of history, can not historicize themselves without reaffirming their immanent role as producers of truth. As a result, the need for another mode of historical inquiry arises when treating the historicity of the conditions of knowledge in the modern era. For the archaeologist, the imperatives of a different relationship to the truth of History and the process of historicization become apparent (1973, 218-219). Archaeology questions the epistemological conditions of the human sciences (1973, 344). However, "archaeological knowledge" becomes problematic since archaeology defines its nebulous historicity in relation to a group of theoretical fields that have an ambivalent relationship with the human sciences.5 Consequently, 1Numerous theoretical attempts that question the linearity of historical time equate the past with alterity. Michel De Certeau for instance elaborated on otherness and difference, which structure the temporal relation between the historian's present and his object of the past. See his The Writing of History. zFor a comprehensive look at The Order of Things, see Major-roetzl (149-167) and Langlois. 3Although Foucault focused on biology, philology, and political-economy to reveal the stark difference between the classical age (17th century) and the modern age (19th century), his analysis moves on to uncover the conditions by which the concrete sciences of Man (anthropology, psychology, sociology, philosophy, etc.) operate in the modern episteme. See p. 355. 4For a complete description of some of the major characteristics of the "classical episteme" see Part I. For some of the more technical differences between the modern episteme and classical episteme, see 206-208 &amp; 346-347. Briefly speaking, the pursuit for a general theory of representaion waned; it was replaced by the figure of Man in relation to the perennial question of establishing an epistemological foundation for the "sciences," which concern every facet of Man's being-society, politics, economics, historv. etc. 5In the last section of Chapter 10, Foucault argues that psychoanalysis, ethnology, and linguistics constitute "counter-sciences" rather than "human sciences," even though both ensembles of knowledge reside within the modern episteme. In a cryptic way, Foucault relates archaeology to the "counter-sciences," which concern the "unconscious" of the modern structure of knowledge (the human sciences). But the question of archaeology's historicity, of course, is left in suspense. See "Psychoanalysis</page><page sequence="3">Symplokë Summer 1995 137 given the immanent critique it makes of present theoretical systems, what is the epistemological status of archaeology? How does archaeology expose the historicity of the present conditions by which the History of the human sciences is understood?6 When is the archaeologist in relation to the historicity of History? In a number of instances Foucault makes quasi-prophetic statements about the next configuration of the episteme (1973, 384-385). He then renounces his "vision" of the future in order to avert the conflation of archaeology with metaphysical speculation. He oscillates between a positive articulation of a new form of knowledge and a critical-historical account that casts doubt on the fundamental ground of modern forms of knowledge (1973, 50 &amp; 386).7 Given the problem of archaeology's relation to historical time, Foucault's critical evaluation of modern historical inquiry is ripe for analysis. In unearthing the deep strata of the modern episteme, Foucault devotes two sections to the question of time and history: "The Retreat and Return of the Origin" in Chapter 9 (328-335) and "History" in Chapter 10 (367-373). By analyzing these sections in The Order of Things, I will demonstrate that the historicity of archaeology is determined by an enigmatic conception of the future. I will try to establish a novel concept of historical time by expounding the function of the future in the archaeological field. However the "new" conception is a derivative effect of the archaeological eclipse of any notion of historical time based on linear movement. The relations between past, present, and future rearrange themselves in nonlinear constellations. Michel De Certeau asserts that The Order of Things (1966) could be used as an index to determine the social status of Parisian intellectuals during the late 60's; their prestige depended on whether they had read the text and what they understood from their reading. De Certeau's statement concerns the idiosyncratic nature of the work and Ethnology," in The Order of Things, 373-386; for more on the relation between the counter-sciences and the human sciences, see Major-Poetzl, p. 191. 6Often, I will capitalize history to differentiate it from historicity and archaeology. History with a big "H" signifies the totality of knowledge assumed within the discursive field of history and the essence of reality to which this knowledge refers, namely the chronological sequence of the past; History with a BIG H is the metaphysical totality of all past human experience in general. But history with a small h signifies a particular manifestation of History, as in a specific field like economic history. However, history with a small "h" also indicates the structure of historical reality in general (like History), but is not capitalized when compared to archaeology and its thematized field; both history and archaeology are two particular forms of knowledge in the modern episteme. The variations in use will depend on the context in which one or the other (History or history) is deployed. Most of the time, "History" is used for stylistic emphasis. 7For further discussion on Foucault's pendulum of the critique of science and the construction of an objective scientific method, see Megill (1979, 487).</page><page sequence="4">138 Rajesh Sampath The Historicity of Archeaology and the enormous reception it received (1986, 171). However, De Certeau is suspicious of The Order of Things. He asks how one can trust a book, which questions the modern foundation of knowledge, when its own methodology is questionable.8 De Certeau states, The fact that Foucault fails to account for the interference between his method and results - or rather, that the problem is deferred until a "later work" - is what causes the reader's unease. But at the same time as we rue this omission on so central a point - one which undoubtedly would have led Foucault to situate himself in history on the basis of his particular reading of the historical avatars of reason - we must recognize, as previously stated, that his work nevertheless raises the issue at every turn. (1986, 178) The critical perspective espoused in The Order of Things treats the conditions of modern historical knowledge without offering a substantial look at the historicity of its "archaeological" method. De Certeau alludes to Foucault's deferment of this massive problem to a "later work."9 Reading The Order of Things becomes problematic since the text undercuts the very foundation of its critique by failing to historicize its position. Consequently, how does one read this enigmatic work? The hermeneutic question of reading in general constitutes one dimension of the problem of historicity. 10 In reading one of the most obscure sections of the book, one discovers the "historical" fate of Foucault's archaeological method. In "The Retreat and Return of the Origin," Foucault tries to uncover the conditions by which a specific understanding of time and the concept of the origin function in modern forms of knowledge. 8For more on the contradictions which beset The Order of Things, see Le Bon, "Un Positiviste dessespère: Michel Foucault." Le Bon argues that since Foucault refuses to think about his epistemological conditions in The Order of Things, the results of his work contradict his implicit method, thus casting doubt on the efficacy of his critique of previous structures of knowledge in the modern era. yDe Certeau's review of the Order of Things was published in 1967, two years before the appearance of Foucault's mysterious "later work," which of course is The Archaeology of Knowledge . 10Hans Georg Gadamer and Paul Ricoeur are probably the foremost European thinkers on the problem of hermeneutics and historicism, yet their questions prioritize issues, like the circle of the temporal experience of narration and the linguistic limits of any experience of time, which my investigation has not addressed. The specific problem of reading and Foucault's notion of discourse as they relate to the problem of historicity will be explored in a future work. Part of my purpose in this section is to determine how one can read The Order of Things from the standpoint of a certain present when the text questions the historicity of present forms of knowledge, including hermeneutics.</page><page sequence="5">Symplokë Summer 1995 139 However Foucault does not attempt to solve the great mystery of time. He endeavors to discover the implicit rules by which modern thought approaches the philosophical problem of time (1973, 328- 335). n Beyond the metaphysical question of time, "The Retreat and Return of the Origin" can help us discern the historicity of archaeology. In a subtle way, Foucault demonstrates how the "modern" relation between historical time and the origin differs from archaeology's relation to time and the origin. Consequently, he sets up the possibility of rethinking the relations between time, the origin, history, historicity, and archaeology. Foucault states, It is no longer the origin that gives rise to historicity; it is historicity that, in its very fabric, makes possible the necessity of an origin which must be both internal and foreign to it: like the virtual tip of a cone in which all the differences, all dispersions, all discontinuities would be knitted together so as to form no more than a single point of an identity, the impalpable figure of the same, yet possessing the power, nevertheless, to burst open upon itself and become Other. (1973, 329) The flow of historical time conceived under the conditions of the modern episteme no longer emanates from a mythical or cosmological source, i.e., a founding origin. History ceases to be the perpetual derivative of a magical distillation process that took place in the pure laboratory space known as the distant origin of Mankind. In the modern episteme, one finds a great reversal; history becomes the quest for an "origin," which is internal and external to historical time. In the modern episteme, history complicates the neutral ambivalence of the origin. Time breaks away from the cosmological necessity of a primordial origin and enters the dissoluble space of history. Ironically within the modern form of history, the conception of "necessity" based on an original beginning confronts its ineluctable fate. History historicizes the origin by dislodging it from the designated position it had to occupy for history to unfold for the first time. History continually drives the origin back to the condition of its impossibility, while the origin emits a faint pulse of the event of its exile from time. The origin constitutes the unfathomable origination of the "modern" relation between linear time and history even though 1 Although Foucault gives new shape to the problem of time, he is not interested, strictly speaking, with the "philosophical" issues that delimit the nature of time. Instead he historicizes the conditions by which the problem has been treated since the nineteenth century; in an indirect way he alludes to Nietzsche, Bergson, and Husserl to show how they constitute representative modes of thought in the modern episteme.</page><page sequence="6">140 Rajesh Sampath The Historicity of Archeaology the "modern" form of history banished the origin from time so that time can flow through history. The great event which formed contemporary historical epistemology is part of an archaeological rupture that resulted in the modern episteme.12 The difference between the cosmological structure of history prior to the rupture and the unique configuration of history and the origin in the modern episteme is describable with respect to the function of the origin in modern historiography. If the density of the field of history (in terms of a multiplicity of causes) makes possible the "necessity" of an indeterminate origin, rather than a determinate origin of necessity, then history is no longer the slave of a beginning point in time. The modern notion of history dissolves the eschatological impulse to foster the truth of Man's destiny based on the predestined truth of an original time. History comes into being in opposition to the divine origination of time. Before the modern structure of knowledge, history used to reflect a mere point of time in an eternal scheme (1973, 367). 13 Within the silent eternity, history was a part within a synchronie whole. The cosmological whole had determined the fate of time even though time was still unfolding; history constituted the contradiction of a mutable eternity of nature. Ironically, the temporal "nature" of history reflected an ahistorical predetermination: a natural destiny of primordial time and the unraveling of natural time within a predetermined structure of history. History realized its true being in an immobile nature of transmutative time: the paradox of historical time prior to the "modern" form of history. Within the cosmic whole, time becomes a particular past present in History only because time in general had arrived at the end of its becoming in being an eternally present predetermined structure of natural becoming. Natural becoming determined "historical" presence in general. However with the advent of the modern episteme, history curves into itself to displace the eternal possibility of a predestined flux of time. The result is that the truthful effect of any destiny is not based on a beginning (an origin). Rather the concept of an original destiny is the effect (and not the cause) of Man's attempt to find his "origin" in History. But Man searches for himself within History by seeking an origin which always exceeds his grasp. Since the origin lies just 12If we recall, Foucault locates the ambiguous birth of the modern episteme in the late 18th century; he does not, however, localize a specific empirical date. See 1973, p. 217. 13 Although Foucault does not describe the characteristics of the pre-modern conception of history in detail, the German philosopher-historian, Hans Blumenberg, has an extensive study on the history of the philosophy of history, particularly on the transition from the divine to the secularized notion of history. See Blumenberg, pp. 53- 61.</page><page sequence="7">Symplokë Summer 1995 141 beyond his purview, Man can claim that history is the ontological category which determines the truth of his being rather than a transcendental principle that usurps his "original" historicity. However Man revives the transcendental fortitude to determine his being; he substitutes the historical origin for God and then banishes this new God from the stream of historical time. Heaven descends into history. History becomes a rich field of possibilities where Man can find the truth of his proliferous being. Man relates his originary being to "historical being" that structures non-original time.14 The concept of "eternity," which determined certain ancient mythologies and the system of medieval Christianity, recedes.15 By describing a different set of relations between the origin, time, and history, Foucault historicizes the very conditions in which history is thought in the modern episteme. History excludes the origin in order for natural time to be determined by history. As a result, history uses the time of the displaced origin to substantiate its inner law of a non-original "necessity" of historical time. However, historical knowledge is the perpetual attempt to retrieve the origin of history from within history even though the origin is disassociated from time. The secret origin of the flux of time does not appear so that time can make its "original" appearance in history. In turn, the "original" essence of time in History guarantees the historical nature of any attempt to establish the origin of being in general. In the modern episteme, History marks the possibility of its transcendental origin within its very structure, while time reflects the eroding traces of history's marks of its elusive origination. Time constitutes the historical ruins of the possibility of its origin: ruins that are lost forever within the trace of history. The trace of the excluded origin of time makes possible history's determination of its own origin, while the trace of the "historical" origin of History fades in historical time. When Foucault suggests that the origin is "internal and foreign" to history, he unveils a functional paradox within modern historical epistemology. The origin is internal to history, where history gives an 14By the word "being," I mean the totality of existence which adheres within a particular entity, like Man for instance. Hence the being of Man is different from the being of History which is different from the being of time, etc. But as we shall see, when determining the historicity of the archaeological attempt to historicize the "modern" form of history, certain permutational relations occur: for instance, in the modern episteme Man is the being of history even though the origin of Man's being is irreducible to history. 15For a good overview of the differences between the ancient and medieval cosmologies on the one hand, and the modern outlook of the universe, on the other, see Koyre (1957) and Gilson (1991). Both thinkers were prominent figures during their respective generations in 20th century French intellectual history. Koyre in particular is part of the tradition of the history of science, to which Foucault acknowledged his debt.</page><page sequence="8">142 Rajesh Sampath The Historicity of Archeaology identifiable content to the unfolding of historical time from a hypothetical standpoint. However, history requires that the origin be "foreign" to the natural flow of time. This way history can historicize and re-historicize how the origin started a particular flow of time in History. Because of the internal and external nature of the origin, history preserves the possibility of its truths to be determined by a form of time that is not ahistorical. History loses its historicity every time the constitution of its origin is determined by a structure of finitude that fails to take the place of the ahistorical origin of Time itself. If the origin of History was located in historical time, then the function of the modern mode of historicization would collapse. Ensnaring the origin in the time of history would destroy the possibility for history to begin the search for its elusive origin through time; thus history would deny, ironically, the very flow of time. The truth of Man would have been found long before history; his truth would be that he can never exist. For the modern concept of history, the secret of the origin lies in the historical being of Man; the origin can not solve the secret of Man's eternal being. The great tide of nineteenth century historicism would not have commenced the search for the truth of Man in the newly consecrated space of History. History, the receptacle of past presents, would be finished without ever having passed through a present: the unthinkable possibility of a "historical" eternity where historical time is never present. However, with the modern episteme, history makes the truth of Man the very structure of the search for the truth of being in general. The truth of being can be found by discovering the past. If the search for the truth (of being) through time is the truth of Man, then history is the truth of the truth of Man. If the truth of time is the very search for the truth of Man's being in history, then the "origin" is the truth of the possibility of "historical" truth. In the modern episteme, the more history tries to use time to "return" to its origin, the more the origin "retreats" from the possibility of history to locate the origin in time. History is the origin of the origin, an origination of the autochthonous origin of being; the event of origination in general is determined in a specific way after the birth of the "modern" epistemological relation between linear time and history. When probing the multivalent origin in the historical field, we confront another aspect of Foucault's paradox. The origin is "virtual" by nature. The origin is an effective limit whose virtual existence makes possible the production of history in the modern episteme; virtual time is responsible for the beginning of history and the erasure of the concept of an ahistorical "beginning" of time. History determines itself on the basis of a virtually "historical" origin, a bewildering origin which recedes from history precisely to propel the</page><page sequence="9">Symploke Summer 1995 143 flow of historical time. The archaeologist tries to historicize the function of the virtual origin in the modern conception of history in contrast to its natural role in the classical conception of the seventeenth century. Beyond the difference between its two historical forms (classical and modern), the virtual origin allows archaeology to differentiate itself from modern historical epistemology. Archaeology uses the notion of discontinuity between the classical age and the modern age to expose the virtual discontinuity between itself and history within the modern age. The double difference between the two relations - classical/modern and archaeology/modern history - legitimates the archaeological historicity of the "modern" form of history, while allowing archaeology to retain the possibility of a different historicity. Paradoxically, archaeology historicizes itself by diverging from the present epistemological conditions of history (chronological continuity between the past and the present), while remaining within the discontinuous conditions of the appearance of historical time (the "modern episteme").16 To understand the historicity of archaeology, one must explore the "virtual" origin of the difference between archaeology and history. When and where is this origin? How does one understand the "temporal" difference between archaeology and history if the origin of their difference does not present itself in linear historical time? The historicity of archaeology is the profound question of how archaeology historicizes the "origin" of the modern concept of history without recourse to either the ahistorical metaphysics of an original, natural time or the non-original, linear time of historical epistemology. Archaeology stipulates that history, which is thought in the present, is not ahistorical, and the present in relation to historical time is not without a "history"; the historical present and the presence of History must have originated in some past. Yet archaeology denies the cyclical possibility of locating the past origin of History in chronological historical time. Nevertheless, my question concerns the possibility of temporalizing the difference between archaeology and history after the archaeological critique of linear historical time based on the continuous succession of presence.17 The 16The massive problem of remaining in historical time, while historicizing the conditions of the linear nature of time in relation to History by way of "discontinuity," can not be explored in this paper. Such an analysis would require how the archaeologist remains in time after exposing the discontinuity between the historicity of being present in an epoch and the historicity of the conditions by which any epoch is present in linear historical time. Suffice it to say, that at this point it is more feasible to probe the limits of understanding the historicity of archaeology than to produce a general theory of archaeological time. 17In the Archaeology of Knowledge, Foucault devoted a chapter to the difference between archaeology and history. However, Foucault focused on their differences with</page><page sequence="10">144 Rajesh Sampath The Historicity of Archeaology mode of temporalization of the difference is what I call the "historicity of archaeology." Hence archaeology and history are not different degrees of a single manifestation within a quantitative spectrum of historiography. 18 The temporal nature of the "virtual" difference between archaeology and history constitutes a great frontier for historical analysis and theoretical invention.19 For the archaeologist, the virtual origin of the unmasterable difference between the two fields (archaeology and history) entails a different relation to time, the truth of "historical man," the finitude of man (death), and the limits of man's thought in the present (the modern episteme). For archaeology, the figure of Man appeared for the first time with the modern episteme.20 Ultimately, the structure and practice of history was effected by the birth of Man. Foucault states, Far from leading back, or even merely pointing, towards a peak - whether real or virtual - of identity, far from indicating the moment of the Same at which the dispersion of the Other has not yet come into play, the original in man is that which articulates him from the very outset upon something other than himself; it is that which introduces into his experience contents respect to discourse and not time. My project concerns the different ways in which archaeology and history relate to certain concepts of time, and how different temporal horizons determine their modes of historicization. Foucault's agenda, on the other hand, advocated archaeology as a quasi-science that studies the "laws" by which discourses form, relate to one another, and transform themselves on the basis of certain elements within an indefinite set of epistemic conditions. Briefly speaking, archaeology does not relate the "idea" contained in a discourse to the context of its origin: the author, paradigm, corpus, school of thought, material event etc. Archaeology treats the discourse itself (1972, 135). 18Archaeology can not be conceived as a more advanced epistemological form of history that takes the name of historicity; the progress of historical epistemology can not be determined in terms of a uniform time line: ancient historiography, Christian scholasticism, the Enlightenment and the German Romantics, 19th century historicism. positivism, and dialectical materialism, and now archaeology. 19Theorizing about the virtual relation between the temporal horizon of the archaeological mode of historicization and the temporal structure of its object, namely an entire "history," requires a massive reconceptualization of the temporal relation of a historian working in a particular present and the non-linear movement of historical time in general. However this project must be deferred to a later work. The task at hand is to determine the historicity of archaeology and not to produce a general theory of virtual historicity. 20The birth of Man as an "empirical and transcendental object" in the modern age is the central thesis of the Order of Things. Archaeology, however, does not imply by this assertion that physical, empirical human beings came about two centuries ago. Rather the epistemological relation between our modern scientific assumptions and the history of the object known as Man, with which we are familiar today, is the effect of a recent transformation. For a closer look at the problem of Man in Foucault's thought, see Merquior (51-55).</page><page sequence="11">Symploke Summer 1995 145 and forms older than him, which he cannot master; it is that which, by binding him to multiple, intersecting, often mutually irreducible chronologies, scatters him through time and pinions him at the centre of the duration of things. Paradoxically, the original, in man, does not herald the time of his birth, or the most ancient kernel of his experience: it links him to that which does not have the same time as himself; and it sets free in him everything that is not contemporaneous with him; it indicates ceaselessly, and in an ever-renewed proliferation, that thing began long before him, and that for this very reason, and since his experience is wholly constituted and limited by things, no one can ever assign him an origin. (1973, 331) In the modern conception of history, the origin is not the distant birth of Western Man. The origin has a new function. Man constitutes the origin itself; the site of the origin is Man. Ontologically speaking, Man gives being (existence) to the origin. However the origin is now outside the history of Man. The origin is exterior to history even though Man constitutes the flux of possibilities in which the phantom of the origin makes itself present in time. As a result, the conditions by which history functions in the modern episteme indicate a double structure of Man: he is the origin of History because his own "historical" origination lies outside of his consciousness of time. Paradoxically, Man bears some relation to the origin of History even though the condition of possibility of Man is his historicity (Greek, Christian, Modern etc.). In the modern episteme, the being of Man is fundamentally historical. Archaeology, however, indicates that the essential notion of the "historical nature" (as the only nature) of Man is the effect of historicity; the very possibility of equating Man's being with epochs of historical finitude is the product of an archaeological rupture. For archaeology, Man as the being of History was born even though the event of his origination is not visible in historical time. The modern form of history, on the other hand, assumes that the exclusion of the origin of History from cosmic time makes possible the origination of Man's being in historical time, i.e., epochal Man.21 However, archaeology's representation of the 21To reiterate, one must keep separate the being of Man from the being of History to comprehend how archaeology historicizes the relations between being, Man, and History in the modern episteme. Again this does not preclude that Man can be conceived as the being of history and inversely, history as the being of Man when</page><page sequence="12">146 Rajesh Sampath The Historicity of Archeaology historicity of the "historical nature" of Man dissolves the possibility of a true origin of the natural historicity of the being of Man within History; "historical man" has no origin even though he is the origin of History. Hence for archaeology, what is the unimaginable historicity of the totality known as the "history of Man"? In the modern episteme, the origin of History is visible in the being of man because man's being is equated with historicity and not because the History of the different faces of Man is determined by a transcendental origin of time. This suggests that being (existence in general) is not the effect of the great cause known as time. For the modern form of history, being can throw off the weight of truth deemed to it by time; being tears open the question of how it grounds itself without the truth of an origin. Being uses history to compensate for the evacuation of meaning when it is detached from a founding origin. Meaning reemerges when time liquidates its own origin and dissipates in history. The meaning of History is the effect of the meaning of the loss of transcendental meaning incurred by the exclusion of the origin of time from history. Yet the question of historical meaning transforms when the "virtual" origin of History poses a problem to the being of Man, whose essence is considered "historical" in the modern age. The question of "historical Man" in the modern episteme is determined by the various effects that the "virtual" origin has on time. Because Man constitutes the origin, time can flow historically. Thus Man can situate himself in relation to the flux of time. Man makes visible his relationship with time through the image of History. History is a picture whose frame is the "origin." But as a frame, the origin can never be contained within the image of the history of Man; the origin encloses history in the void of its own finite space which Man hollows out infinitely. Yet the origin of Man is the "other" of History; moreover, it is beyond the category of the inhuman or pre-human, i.e., the "Pre-Historic," which still relates to the history of Man's being. The "other" is the exclusion of Man's origin from history, while the excluded origin makes History the interminable witness of the being of Man. Once the being of Man is expressed by the flow of time in history, Man commences the quest for his impossible origin. Man fails to realize that the negation of his origin is the condition of possibility for historical time to determine his being. The impossibility of the origin of History, however, is the condition of possibility for the equation of Man's being with historicity. Historicity, in turn, makes possible the origin of the archaeology attempts to differentiate the function of history in the modern episteme from its function in the classical episteme.</page><page sequence="13">Symploke Summer 1995 147 "history of Man" even though Man, himself, no longer has an origin in history.22 With the advent of the modern episteme, the being of Man is structured by a specific contradiction. Man occupies two places at once. On the one hand, he lies in the future of the flow of time; he occupies a referent which constitutes an "endpoint" from where he can see himself (his past selves) flow in time through the vessel of History. On the other hand, Man nullifies the possibility for time to end; he thwarts time's potential termination by using history to manufacture the infinite density of his origin and thus all the possibilities of the "beginning" of his flow in time. Hence Man is the destined effect of his becoming in historical time and the becoming of time in History. However, in the modern episteme the infinite density of the historical origin of Man destroys the possibility for Man to describe the finite origin of History without sacrificing the historicity of his being and its relationship with non-original, linear time. Man speaks about history but does so from a present which will be a part of history; the historical truth of history will become history in so far as the perpetual origination of the truth of History is never present in and of itself. Consequently, Man can never take the place of an infinite God, who determines being from the standpoint of an eternal scheme. Then again, Man infinitely replaces the possibility of being determined in his finite totality by virtue of the temporal indeterminacy of the historicity of the essence of his "historical being."23 The undying fact that things came before him in time, things unfamiliar to him, makes the being of Man an infinite question; yet his being is a perennial question which he tries to resolve through his finite relationship with History. Things of the past existed at one time only because they show up in the a priori space of historical time where the being of Man has been inscribed prior to any past: all things in time are visible by way of history whose image is offered by the mirror of Man. Time flows through 22To repeat from my introduction, what is the "temporal" nature of historicity if it is caught in a web of paradoxes concerning how one historicizes the "modern" ensemble of relations between time, history, Man, and the origin without repeating any of those terms? What is historicity? 23One must imagine an asymmetry within the epistemological function of the concept of the infinite when differentiating the modern episteme's (Man's) relation to time from the classical episteme's (God's) non-relation to time; modern historical epistemology, itself, is the "historic" effect of this asymmetry. Archaeology tries to determine the historicity of effects, which ensue from this asymmetry. Man is the object of history and the transcendental origin of history, which allows the modern concept of history to appear in the form that it does. However the great problematic of the function of infinity in modern historical epistemology is too massive for the scope of this article.</page><page sequence="14">148 Rajesh Sampath The Historicity of Archeaology Man at a certain point as Man scatters himself at every point in History. Paradoxically, the scintillation of the figure of Man throughout history allows "historical man" to make time submit to his knowledge at a particular moment in history. Time is subjugated to the theocentric eternity of Man's being even though time determines the anthropomorphic history of the finitude of being (Greek, Christian, Modern, etc.). Ironically, time structures history so that a finite identity of man emerges in time; but Man needs an identity prior to his first utterance of the truth of time's determination of his finitude. This constitutes the paradox of the becoming of historical man in time and the becoming of the truth of the becoming of time itself, which allows Man to speak the truth of his "historical" identity at a point in time. Another paradox forms out of this paradox: the being of History makes possible Man's association with time even though Man is the foundation of the being of History. Man is the ground of the entirety of history even though the determination of the truth of his being continues to unfold in time and thus continues to become "historical." One must consider an indeterminate "becoming" of the possibility of the "being" of the "history of Man" in its totality, which serves as the atemporal ground for the determined flow of time in history (i.e. transition of finite epochs).24 However, the "temporal becoming" of the possibility of the continuous flow of time in history is irreducible to historical time and the movement of physical time; furthermore it can not be conflated with archaeology and its relationship with discontinuous time.25 Archaeology historicizes the tripartite configuration of Man, linear time, and History in the modern episteme. Again the limit of understanding the difference between archaeology's relation to time and historical time presents itself. How does the historicity of archaeology differ from the historicity of the conditions of time, Man, and history in the modern episteme? The temporal horizon of their epistemological difference forms the central problem of my investigation. Even though archaeology occupies a 24In other words, how does Man constitute the foundation of becoming that takes the form of history when History at any given time determines the being of Man even though his being announces itself as the foundation of becoming (history); this massive paradox in some senses goes straight to the root of the question of being versus becoming. However this great philosophical problem exceeds the boundaries of this investigation. /öThis statement is not redundant even if it appears as such: the terms - "temporal becoming of possibility" and "historical time" - are not coterminus. Consequently, do we have to consider another order of temporality beneath historical time, which determines the historicity of the history of Man from without historical time? One must elaborate on the distinction between the 1.) archaeological "temporal becoming" of the possibility of the relation between time and history and 2.) the empirical flow of historical time.</page><page sequence="15">Symploke Summer 1995 149 place next to the field of history, among the "human sciences" in the modern episteme, archaeology generates a series of reversals and mutations within the epistemological conditions of the historical field. Therefore archaeology's location in historical time becomes problematic because the concept of "archaeological time" has yet to be determined. The archaeological mutations within historical epistemology become apparent when we consider the relation between historical time and the future. If the episteme is the theoretical space where the conditions of discourses (like History) are described, then "archaeological discourse" is the "historic" possibility of a future episteme and hence a "future" concept of historical time.26 The category of the future shows that the constellation of time, the origin, and Man differs in the archaeological field. By emphasizing the future, archaeology creates for itself a radically divergent agenda. Foucault states, A task is thereby set for thought: that of contesting the origin of things, but of contesting it in order to give it a foundation, by rediscovering the mode upon which the possibility of time is constituted - that origin without origin or beginning, on the basis of which everything is able to come into being. Such a task implies calling into question of everything that pertains to time, everything that has formed within it, everything that resides within its mobile element, in such a way as to make visible that rent, devoid of chronology and history, from which time issued. Time would be suspended within that thought, which nevertheless cannot escape from it since it is never contemporaneous with the origin; but this suspension would have the power to revolve the reciprocal relation between origin and thought; and as it pivoted upon itself, the origin, becoming what has yet to think, and always afresh, would be forever promised in an imminence always nearer yet never accomplished. In that case the origin is that which is returning, the repetition towards which thought is moving, the return of that which has already always begun, the proximity of a light that has been shining since the beginning of time. Thus for the third time, 26 As we can see the problem of the historicity of archaeology is always twofold: to determine the relation between archaeology, historical time, and the future, and to determine the "event" of a theory of archaeological time based on the future.</page><page sequence="16">150 Rajesh Sampath The Historicity of Archeaology the origin is visible through time; but this time it is the recession into the future, the injunction that thought receives and imposes itself to advance with dovelike steps towards that which has never ceased to render it possible, to keep watch in front of itself, on the ever receding line of its horizon, for the day from which it came and from which it is coming in such profusion. (1973,332) If time - the greatest of mysteries - is to be historicized, then archaeology must confront the enigmatic paradoxes of "returning" and "repetition." Nietzsche and Heidegger made the confrontation.27 If time based on a notion of continuous presence is linked to the condition of possibility of history, then archaeology's attempt to historicize time also historicizes the possibility of historical time. Beyond a critical description of the conditions of modern historical epistemology, the hidden "task" of archaeology is to explore the theoretical question of time and the origin in modern thought. However, archaeology must relate to this Herculean task in a "historical" way. Archaeology makes itself historic by analyzing the conditions of time and history in relation to the future. Archaeology does not assume a priori that the flow of time is the condition of possibility for a description of historical experience. Hence archaeology does not have recourse to linear time when it describes a specific history. However archaeology is by no means detached from the question of time; one could say that the archaeological project is the aporetic experience of the paradoxes of time by way of historicity.28 In some senses archaeology delves into time's deepest possibility. Archaeology examines the mode of temporalization which converts physical time into historical time within the machinery of "modern" historical epistemology. 27The function of historicity in Nietzsche and Heidegger's thought is important when determining Foucault's relationship to his philosophical forefathers. See Megill (1985, 183) and Dreyfus and Rabinow (37-43). Unfortunately, a detailed examination of Nietzsche and Heidegger would take us astray and undermine the specific role of historicity in the works of Foucault. ¿0This proposition deserves an extensive elaboration that can only be achieved in a later work; this paper seeks to understand the historicity of archaeology by differentiating it from historical time, and not to erect a grand theory of the relation between time and history. To repeat, the event of archaeological analysis as a different historical epistemology constitutes a multiplicity of ways to experience new paradoxes of time when the concept of historicity governs the experience of the paradoxes. If we remember, the historic nature of archaeology is irreducible to any representation of time in the history of thought; it is also irreducible to any temporal structure, which determines different types of "history": cyclical, linear, etc. Hence what does it mean to say that archaeology relates "historically" to the question of time? What is the historicity of archaeology?</page><page sequence="17">Symploke Summer 1995 151 Archaeology forces time to run backwards against its flow, which creates a unique viscosity that disrupts the apparent contents of historical time. Time flows continuously from the present to the past, while the historian perceives historical time in terms of a fixed representation of time flowing from the past to the present: a segment within the totality of Man's chronological history. Archaeology, however, disrupts both types of flow. Archaeological time is the reversible potential of historical time, which nevertheless appears on the basis of a single direction of time; hence archaeological time (in and of itself) does not flow from past to present or present to past. Archaeological time can not be conflated with either historical time or the continuous flow of physical time. What then is "archaeological time?" Paradoxically, archaeological time appears with historical time even though the mode of becoming of archaeological time differs from the mode of becoming of historical time. This is why archaeology describes great leaps of epistemes in terms of a quasi-chronological scheme while questioning the temporal nature of the relation between the present conditions of knowledge and History. Ultimately, the archaeological perspective relates to historical time in a complex way; it draws from very specific events within the conditions of historical time, which embroil the archaeological position in a larger temporal complexity.29 The event of writing an "archaeology" is implicated with the genesis of a future time. Archaeological discourse constitutes an "historic" form of questioning. Through its endless interrogation of the conditions of History, archaeology offers the possibility of a new notion of historical time that prioritizes the future. But the futuristic notion is derived from a quasi-phenomenological description of the birth and death of past conceptions of time via a mode of historicity.30 29In all of his works, if we remember, Foucault never describes a chronological evolution that starts with the past and ends with the present. Instead he describes two specific sites without localizing them in empirical time - what he calls a rupture or mutation in the beginning of the 17th century (birth of the classical episteme) and one in the late 18th century (birth of the modern episteme) (1973, 217). In sum, Foucault delineates all the transformations which ensued from the invisible events of these two mutations in order to historicize the difference between our modern conception of historical continuity and the temporal alterity of a complex structure, which lies outside of linear historical time. Of course Foucault did not treat the latter. In a future work on Deleuze, I will examine the complex structure of the archaeological field, including the nature of an event in the archaeological field as opposed to an empirical event that occurs in continuous historical time. ouOne should not overemphasize the resemblance between Jb oucault s project oí archaeology and Husserl's phenomenology defined particularly in his works on time: namely the Phenomenology of Internal-Time Consciousness. Even though my project does not concern all the similarities and differences between archaeology and phenomenology, the two fields do cross paths on the theoretical issue of describing the conditions of the genesis of time. For Husserl, what is in question is the general and</page><page sequence="18">152 Rajesh Sampath The Historicity of Archeaology Archaeology historicizes our natural assumptions of time; it subsumes our a priori intuitions of time within the non-intuitive conditions of historicity. By ascribing an origin to time and making this origin the dispersed effect (and not the unified cause) of an archaeological "history," the archaeologist calls into question the "temporal" nature of his being. The historicity of archaeology is linked to the enigmatic relation between the future and the fate of the modern concept of non-original, linear historical time. How does one understand the future of historical epistemology when its theoretical field, namely history, deals exclusively with the past? How does one understand the future of the "science of the past" when the future is not derived from its predecessor in historical time, namely the present? The future of the historical field hinges on archaeology's characterization of various modalities of time and the origin in the modern episteme. The mode of visibility of the origin of History is linked to the mode of appearance of the origin in time. But any origin is visible in time only because History's desire for its lost origin makes visible time itself. "Archaeological time," however, shatters this aporia. For the archaeologist, the visible manifestation of the origin through time involves a "recession." It is with the origin of History that everything concerns a "return" to historicity: the ellipsoid of archaeological time. This perplexing temporality suggests that the return of historical knowledge to the origin is not the movement of the present back to a stable past. Instead, for the archaeologist, the movement of time back to the origin of History is a paradoxical "return" to the future. Returning to the future, however, is related to a return to historicity.31 Archaeology describes how the "historicity" of the modern epistemic constellation of linear time, the origin, Man, and History is effected by a strange temporality of "returning." Archaeology attempts to return to the question of the "origin" of the relation universal nature of the conditions of our experience of time. For Foucault, as I have argued throughout my investigation, the problem of time is intimately involved with the problem of historicity. For a good comparison of Husserl and Foucault on the philosophy of history, see Flynn, (1978) and Valdinoci (1978). These articles argue that Foucault's problematic of history can be derived from the later Husserl, whereas I am arguing for a radical difference between the two based on the fundamental variance of the problem of "historicity" in Foucault. Furthermore, I am interested in the possibility of a different concept of historical time after the archaeological critique of non-original linear time. 31To reiterate from previous moments in this paper, historicity is not the same as History. Furthermore historicity, unlike History, has less to do with an empirically verifiable past than it does with the question of origination in general. After archaeology exposes that history and historical time are not natural, timeless entities but are "historical," then the question of the historicity of the "origin" of history is thrown open. What is historicity?</page><page sequence="19">Symplokë Summer 1995 153 between time and history without assuming a priori that the origin exists. Hence archaeology does not return to the origin as such; it does not represent the origin in an empirical form of knowledge about the autonomous past, a representation of the past which is determined in the present.32 For archaeology, the historicity of History is the origin of History. Therefore, returning to the origin of History as if it lay in the immobile tomb of historical time is impossible. The displacement of the possibility of a real origin in time is the condition of possibility for the historicity of the "modern" relation between linear time and History to present itself and thus for historicity to "originate." Consequently for archaeology, returning to the origin (or the historicity of History) entails the return to a "future" structure of the relation between time, origination, and history. For archaeology, the origin and the future are linked by a strange temporal mechanism. This is counter-intuitive because in principle they seem to constitute two ends of a polarity. In one of its faithful moments, archaeology promises the future of thought to recapture the origin within the space of its representation of time (1973, 332). Yet archaeology also mandates the "virtual" exclusion of the origin of history from history; hence archaeology can historicize the birth of the modern epistemological structure of history outside of historical time. One can only repeat the return to the origin of History without returning as such. The archaeologist is part of a constant future that tries to return to an elusive past - the birth of Man's relation to linear historical time - that was never present in an ^historical time. Likewise for archaeology, the origin of History returns to an impossible future. This peculiar future allows the origin to lie outside of historical time, when historical time flows from past to present; for the future of any historical relation between past and present suggests that the relation (itself) will be past, but not in historical time. Paradoxically, the history of successive relations between past and present, or the history of History, is irreducible to historical time. Hence time can flow towards its own "historic" possibility and propel the attempt to realize, again, the possibility of the "origin" of time in History.33 For the archaeologist, what returns is not the 32If we recall, the dissimulated origin of the "modern" relation between time and history is the origin of the ahistorical nature of Man's relationship to History through his consciousness of linear time; in the modern episteme, historical representations promise that the present can return to an elapsed present - a present that is past within the same continuum where the present event of historicization takes place. aa Although this is not my goal in the present article, one could take up an intriguing problem. To understand "historical time" within the history of History, one would have to imagine how time returns to history while "simultaneously" flowing onwards, thus making history; "historical time" within the history of History is the double viscosity of the "historical" movement of time outside of historical time and the</page><page sequence="20">154 Rajesh Sampath The Historicity of Archeaology transcendental origin of time and history but the origin of returning to historicity. The temporality of the archaeologist is both the return to and the repetition of returning to the historicity of the origin of time and history.34 The archaeologist describes the conditions of everything manifest within the domain of historical experience: discourse, time, Man, and even History itself. But if we remind ourselves, the archaeologist, himself, exists within the historicity of the conditions of experience by residing in an impalpable future. To ask once again, how does the archaeologist occupy the conditions of the past origin of the present structure of history by occupying the future - a future which is nothing but a continual return to the historicity of any concept of the origin of History? How is the origin inscribed in the future and the future in the origin, and furthermore, how does historicity determine the chiasmic intertwining of the origin and the future? When is the archaeologist in relation to this great temporal complexity? Archaeology lies in an ambiguous future, which is not ahead of the now or the present. The future inhabits the possibility of thinking again that which is no longer present: the demystified origin of the "modern" relation between linear time and history. The future intercepts its possibility in the birth of a new past every time an historical present commences the quest for its origin; yet the inaccessible origin is trapped in the process of returning to the future. Archaeological time can be described in terms of a non-intuitive principle of what one can call the "future remnant."35 Archaeology describes the conditions for the past to be a remnant of the present state of theoretical conditions. But the archaeologist, himself, takes up a future condition by which the concept of being-past can be a remnant of a different intuition of the relation between the three dimensions of time and historical time in general.36 One can see the deficiency in a linear conception of time when dealing with the historicity of archaeology. "temporal" movement of history outside of historical time. Again, producing a theory of the history of History exceeds the goal of this present investigation. 34To reiterate my initial definition, historicity is irreducible to any representation of time in history and any temporal structure, which grounds History (linear, cyclical, even discontinuous etc.). At most I can only restate that the temporal infrastructure of historicity relates to "returning," which can not be thought in terms of time or history. ouThe critical concept ot the future remnant can not be developed in depth within the space of this article; needless to say that the possibility of its conception points to a different structure of historical time that can help us understand the historicity of archaeology. dbThe realization of a different relation between the three dimensions of time and historical time - which is not derived from the concept of linear time within modern historical epistemology but from the futurai structure of archaeology - would require a massive theoretical development of the relation between historicity and the future. How is this enormous paradox possible?</page><page sequence="21">Symploke Summer 1995 155 The paradoxical temporality of the archaeological perspective is intertwined with the nonlinear temporal structures of a complex historical field. Archaeology describes the interminable relations between past, present, and future. All three dimensions intersect in different networks throughout the vast holographic space of the archaeological field. Hence archaeology obliterates the priority of one dimension of time (the past) when it conceives of the project of historicity. Thus archaeology is tied to the greatest paradox possible: the problem of time.37 One must investigate the theoretical structures of the category of the "future" in relation to the diaphanous "event" of the archaeological historicization of linear historical time. However, one can not presuppose the category of the future in terms of the intuitive representations of time that have descended from the history of philosophical discourse.38 The future is inscribed within the theoretical activity of the archaeologist; he tries to advance the conditions of thought beyond the means of cognition given to the present. However, this does not mean that the archaeologist produces "new" knowledge; he does not deliver the future to the present or the present to the future. Archaeology goes beyond the present in a non-transcendental way; it surpasses the theoretical conditions of the present by answering to the alterity of historical time. Yet the otherness of the past - or the origin - was never present in time, i.e., a past present. The origin of the past can only come, perpetually come (or return) from the future. Archaeology's contorted configuration of the three dimensions of time creates a deformation in our normal sense of time. This deformity is the "historic" effect of archaeology. One can unfold the complexity of the heterogeneous entanglement of the three dimensions of time to determine a "new" notion of archaeological time: hollowing out of the present, alterity of a non-original past which was never present, and returning to and from the future. These different dimensions transform our prior intuitions of the 37 1 have tried to argue throughout my investigation that the problem of time is bound, inextricably, to the problem of the historicity of archaeology, even though Foucault and his interpreters under emphasized the link between them. To repeat, the problem can not be solved under the modern conditions of philosophical thought or within the contemporary framework of historical epistemology; neither could it be solved within Foucault's method of archaeology: hence the incompletion of archaeology as a "science." 38 As early as 1924, Heidegger argued that time has been thought according to very specific assumptions of being-present, even though time as a philosophical "problem" has received various treatments throughout history: Aristotle, Augustine, Leibniz, Kant, Hegel, Bergson, and Husserl to name some of the dominant faces of history. See in particular Heidegger's 1927 text, Basic Problems of Phenomenology. My project, however, concerns the theoretical relation between historicity and the future, and not the age old philosophical problem of time.</page><page sequence="22">156 Rajesh Sampath The Historicity of Archeaology normative structures of time and the combinations of those structures.39 Archaeology produces a different sense of time in so far as it historicizes the contemporary relation between linear time (based on the succession of presence) and history.40 Ultimately, the possibility of understanding the historicity of archaeology is inscribed within the conditions of understanding the historicity of history. If the time of the archaeologist is to be heard, it is in the echo known as the "historicity of history," whose symphonic movement is developed in a section simply entitled "History" (1973, 367-373). In describing the historicity of history, Foucault states, "there exists a historicity of man which is itself its own history but also the radical dispersion that provides a foundation for all other histories" (1973, 370). The "historicity of man" has its own history. This "history" based on "dispersion" grounds "all other histories." Historicity determines the invisible moment when History situates Man in the stream of time. But historicity also exposes the density which composes the stream and the "histories" which make up the dispersed matter that flow through it. Hence the historicity of "other histories" can not be reduced to the history of Man. Archaeology manipulates the distinction between historicity and history. Historicity is the "historic" birth or emergence of the history of a phenomenon and not the phenomenon itself; historicity makes possible the birth of a history (like the history of Man). The event of the birth of history has a dispersed "history" inscribed in its very possibility. Consequently, the history of the birth of History localizes an "event" whose temporal determination escapes linear historical time; this great event is entangled in the asymmetrical structure of the three dimensions of time that repeat and return by way of a non- intuitive movement.41 Archaeology questions the conditions of the historicity of History but suspends the temporal nature of its own perspective on what constitutes the "historical." Within the temporal indeterminacy of its epistemology, archaeology toils with the conceptual difference between historicity and history. 39To reiterate, the description of the historicity of archaeology is based on the "historic" possibility of generating different structures of intuition of the aporias of time in order to understand the historicity of history, and not to generate a new philosophy of time. 40 Again, this appears to be another abstract proposition with a certain dialectical tinge; however, it is meant to serve as a point of departure by which I can describe, positively, the temporal structures of the historicity of archaeology, and not just dismantle, critically, the conditions by which the relation between time and history have been thought to this point. 41In his celebrated work Foucault, Deleuze briefly explored the relation between archaeological time (alterity of non-original past, eclipsed present, and the return to/from the future) and the movement of historicity.</page><page sequence="23">Symplokë Summer 1995 157 Archaeology breaks from the epistemological order of the historical field when it concerns itself with historicity rather than History. However, a certain limit is revealed when analyzing the historicity of History. Foucault states, The more History attempts to transcend its own rootedness in historicity, and the greater effort it makes to attain, beyond the historical relativity of its origin and its choices, the sphere of its universality, the more clearly it bears the marks of its historical birth, and the more evidently there appears through it the history of which it is itself a part. (1973, 371) The archaeological method confronts historical epistemology in terms of a quasi-dialectical substitution of terms that takes place with respect to historicity. For the archaeologist, there is a confounding exchange between the historical object and the historical perspective. The birth of History becomes an "historical" object for archaeological analysis. However, the object has a nebulous origin. Archaeology complicates the origin when it tries to present the origin's "historicity." When archaeology uncovers dispersion within the origin of its object (the birth of History), archaeology falls into other dimensions within history.42 Hence the archaeological object does not have a unified place in historical time. There is no isolated event which constitutes the origin of the "modern" concept of history. The origin is pure multiplicity. Multiplicity reveals a vortex of diverse temporal possibilities beneath a point in linear time; multiplicity is the kaleidoscopic effect of historical time during the event of its own historicization. The multiplicitous origin of History serves several functions in the archaeological field. For the archaeologist, the "historical" character of the birth of History constitutes the non-original finitude of historicity. The non-original nature of History's presumed "origin" shows up every time History tries to "transcend" its relationship with time; only in History can the origin of History be found. History sacrifices its historicity in order for History to exist: a great contradiction inscribed in the being of History. The contradiction lodged within the essence of History precipitates other complications of historicity. Historical time includes its origin within itself while maintaining the ahistorical assumption of the essence of its being, which is the being of 42To reiterate one of my major points, archaeology is not simply the history of history. If it were, then archaeology would repeat the transcendental illusion that history has with respect to its "historical" origin, which exceeds historical time.</page><page sequence="24">158 Rajesh Sampath The Historicity of Archeaology continuous becoming, thus erasing the possibility of an origin. Ironically, history moves by repeating the destruction of its origin; history consumes its origin in order to circulate the movement of its time. Hence history believes that it is the movement of time when in fact the presence of History is motionless; the movement of history is constituted on the basis of the repetition of its beginning and the displacement of the possibility of ever having begun. Hence history is always beyond what it believes is its beginning and before what it envisions as its end. But this is also why history never appears to be happening (in a present) even though it will have happened from the standpoint of the future, where history (in and of itself) is impossible; the present will be past only in the future, which means that history can be "present" only if the future becomes the past without passing through the present.43 Hence as long as there is a present, the occurrence of history will not present itself. Archaeology tries to re- present that which can not be present: the "historical" condition of possibility of the presence of History.44 If time - as the basis of the describable finitude of any phenomenon - is the condition of possibility for the phenomenon to be present in history, then history represents the condition of impossibility to describe the "historical" finitude of its own relationship with time. History excludes its historicity so that it can foster a specific relation between any phenomenon and time. Hence a specific relation between time and history remains ahistorical and eternal; the being of history is eternal so that history can historicize the eternity of being in time. The fragile eternity of history is hidden so history can appear to temporalize its existence, and thus determine the finite temporality of existence in general. The tragic event of the birth of History is that eventually History will have to historicize the event of its own birth. The problem of thinking the historicity of History without reproducing the "modern" epistemological relation between non- original, linear time and history is a major domain of exploration for 43These apparently contradictory involutions are necessary to expose the limits of understanding the archaeological task, namely historicizing the conditions by which historical time happens as such. The three dimensions of time lose their consistency when certain logical relationships are formulated. For instance how does history happen to itself, in its own presence, if the future must become the past without passing through the present? Regardless, how can the future become past at all? Again, the problem of historical time within the historicity of History will be explored in a future work. 44The question of the "presence" of history cannot be explored at this point. We saw how archaeology historicizes the conditions which allow history in the modern episteme to make itself present by way of the elements of linear time, the origin, and Man. But the question of the presence of history, the issue of "presence" itself, for archaeology (and the futurai structure of the archaeological mode of presentation) is a deeper question which will be explored in another work.</page><page sequence="25">Symplokë Summer 1995 159 archaeology. In some senses, archaeology is the theoretical structure of the problem of the historicity of History which subsumes the ultimate question of time. At stake for archaeology is nothing short of a Copernican réévaluation of the relations between time, being, the origin, history, and historicity.45 Given my analysis thus far I can only recapitulate certain points concerning the limits of understanding the historicity of archaeology. By uncovering the historicity of history, archaeology demystifies the "historical" essence of Man. The archaeological object known as the "birth" of the history of Man is a temporally indeterminate remnant; the space of the remnant serves as a site for the dispersion of time. Within the modern episteme Man is the foundation and object of History. However the historicity of archaeology reverses the conditions for time to appear historically and Man to relate to time by way of history. Archaeology disallows man to be the foundation of history. The archaeologist replaces linear time and man with the foundationless character of dispersion and the "other." This historic substitution of concepts within historical epistemology constitutes the very "event" of the historicity of archaeology. The "event" of archaeology within the historicity of historical epistemology relates to a strange notion of the future. The difference between modern historical epistemology and archaeology is part of a theory of history that is not grounded in linear time, nor a future concept of time. The "new" notion of history is derived from the complex structure of the archaeological "event" of historicizing the conditions of linear historical time. In turn the quasi-temporal structure of this event is determined by a horizon of futurality.46 The future is the unthinkable limit of historical rationality. The limit marks a horizon of temporality to which historical rationality is always indebted. The early Foucault was influenced by several thinkers who questioned the limits of historical rationality. James Bernauer argues that among those who influenced Foucault's development, three stand out as his "intellectual masters": Georges Canguilhem, Georges Dumézil, and Jean Hyppolite (Bernauer 97). Of course, one can acknowledge other intellectuals: Gaston Bachelard, Alexandre Koyré, Georges Bataille, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Ludwig 45This is precisely the reason I chose to study archaeology as opposed to genealogy; the former relates to the question of time, even though the question is left in abeyance, while the latter is a self-conscious historicization of the "present" for the purpose of challenging the unquestionable norms by which the social and political configuration of modernity is conceived.

A comprehensive genealogy of Foucault's thought would be an instrumental project.47 However, Foucault's The Order of Things concludes with several final clues to determine the historicity of archaeology precisely by questioning its own "rationality." I will try to approach the problem anew even though its solution is the ceaseless weave of possible answers deferred to a future that will come. With regard to the issues that archaeology raises in relation to the future, Foucault states, Of course, these are not affirmations; they are at most questions to which it is not possible to reply; they must be left in suspense, where they pose themselves, only with the knowledge that the possibility of posing them may well open the way to a future thought. (1973, 386) "Of course these are not affirmations." The "questions" stimulated by archaeology are unanswerable, but the possibility of their articulation "opens the way to a future thought." To ask, once again, what is the relation between the limits of archaeology and the category of the future? The present carries the possibility of a different historical- transcendental field (episteme) by which future thought can proceed. This "future" is the possibility for time to be constituted on the basis of an internal transformation within the present conditions of thinking time in general by way of historicity. The possibility of transformation is marked within the current transcendental field but held in "suspense"; for the limit of the present is not its future possibility but the impossibility of a notion of the future ever presenting itself as such, i.e. the presentation of the future as Future. Archaeology suffers from this epistemological schism. Hence the archaeologist is obligated to speculate about his own possibility in the hypothetical time of an ambiguous future. Foucault states, For the entire modern episteme - that which was formed towards the end of the eighteenth century and 47 A larger project than the one underway would distill Foucault's epistemology through these other thinkers. One could determine what aspects of various intellectual traditions from the 1930's to the early 1960's - Marxism, psychoanalysis, phenomenology, structuralism, comparative methodology, Heideggerean ontology, a revived Nietzscheanism etc. - repeat and differ in Foucault's theoretical problematic of history; hence one could get a larger picture of the genesis of Foucault's concepts. For a good introduction to Foucault's relation to the preceding generation of intellectuals, see Bernauer (94-100) and Miller (15).</page><page sequence="27">Symplokë Summer 1995 161 still serves the positive ground of our knowledge, that which constituted man's particular mode of being and the possibility of knowing him empirically - that entire episteme was bound up with the disappearance of Discourse and its featureless reign, with the shift of language towards objectivity, and with its reappearance in multiple form. If this same language is now emerging with greater and greater insistence in a unity that we ought to think but cannot as yet do so, is this not the sign that the whole of this configuration is now about to topple, and that man is in the process of perishing as the being of language continues to shine ever brighter upon our horizon? Since man was constituted at a time when language was doomed to dispersion, will he not be dispersed when language regains its unity? And if that were true, would it not be an error - a profound error, since it could hide from us what should now be thought - to interpret our actual experience as an application of the forms of language to the human order? Ought we not rather to give up thinking of man, or, to be more strict, to think of the disappearance of man-and the ground of possibility of all the sciences of man - as closely as possible in correlation with our concern with language? Ought we not to admit that, since language is here once more, man will return to the serene non-existence in which he was formerly maintained by the imperious unity of Discourse? Man had been a figure occurring between two modes of language; or rather, he was constituted only when language, having been situated within representation and, as it were, dissolved in it, freed itself from that situation at the cost of its own fragmentation: man composed his own figure in the interstices of that fragmented language. (1973, 386) The archaeological perspective acknowledges its position within the modern episteme, which "still serves as the positive ground of our knowledge." But then how does archaeology offer certain reflections on the death of the modern episteme by alluding to the "disappearance of Man"? Is the archaeological perspective betwixt an oscillatory time that swings between the present conditions of knowledge and the ghostly eclipse of the present? Is the present description of the death of contemporary theoretical structures of Man the possibility, and impossibility of future structures, where</page><page sequence="28">162 Rajesh Sampath The Historicity of Archeaology another being will appear? Is archaeology the "historic" twilight of the "modern" relation between time and history? What if archaeology's quasi-transcendental position with respect to the modern episteme, and therefore its historicity, are illusory effects of the "fragmented" multiplicity of language? Probing the historicity of archaeology exposes certain limits of modern thought in general. Archaeology questions the structural relations between time and history without reestablishing the ideological relation between time and historical consciousness, which emerged with the modern episteme. This is why Foucault refuses to substantiate his precarious "predictions" of the future (1973, 386). If he did envision the future, and his prophecy came true, then archaeological subjectivity would have discovered - in a transcendental mode - the laws of necessity of history: even the historical fate of the archaeological project, which critiqued the ahistorical necessity of history. Then again, archaeology does not relinquish the power to think within the confines of its equivocal position. The dysfunctional process of thinking the historicity of archaeology is accompanied by a certain mode of temporalization. The describable positivity of this temporalization concerns the relation between future and present after the archaeological critique of historical time based on linearity and the succession of self-same presence. Hence the time of archaeology is "left in suspense." UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, IRVINE References Bernauer, James. Michel Foucault's Force of Flight. New Jersey: Humanities International Press, 1989.
