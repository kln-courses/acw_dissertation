In a paper which appeared in the Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, Vol. XLVI, p. 309, I endeavoured to throw light on the problem of the origin of the Maori pendant called "Hei-tiki." In the course of the paper I made the following statement: "Karl yon den Steinen has reached a conclusion "arrived at independently by the present writer. This conclusion is that the dis- '' proportionate size of the head, the slant at which it is set, and the curved legs "depend not on a realistic representation of the human embryo, but on the proportions "of the greenstone adze." Mr. Henry Balfour has written to me that General Pitt Rivers recognised some 50 years ago the influence of the adze on the form of the typical hei-tiki, and has asked me to give Pitt Rivers priority in this regard. This I am only too glad to do. Pitt Rivers' statement has not been published in any of his papers, but occurs on his original printed label attached to a specimen in his collection. It runs as follows:" Tiki, New Zealand. The form of these images, always sharp "towards the feet of the image, suggests the idea that, like some Carib axes, they "may originally have been derived from celts, ornamented with a human figure." Mr. Balfour adds: "The specimen in greenstone has a well-defined, sharp cutting- '' edge. When I was arranging the tikis in the museum some 25 years ago, I "placed two more alongside of the one referred to, in order to show the eventual "loss of the cutting edge, through its interruption by projections concerned with "the feet. My idea was that the adze-blade itself was probably symbolic (as in "Mangaia, &amp;c.), and that an anthropomorphic design was grafted upon it, possibly "to increase the symbolism. The net result being that the adze ceased to be "functional and became the vehicle of the anthropomorph. I quite agree with you "that there were hei-tiki before celtiform examples. The hei-tiki already "existed in other forms, but the idea seems to have been grafted on the adze, "whose essential form reacted upon the design and created the distortion of the "latter." Since writing the paper on hei-tiki fresh material and further consideration have somewhat modified the conclusions there stated. Mr. Best states: "The "hei-tiki, it is believed, represented the human f~tus, and was supposed to "possess an inherent fructifying influence when worn by women. This statement "has been made by several natives, also by Colonel Gudgeon, Captain G. Malt, and [ 162 ]</page><page sequence="2">Oct., 1917.] MAN. [Nos. 105-107. Mr. T. E. Green, all good authorities on matters connected with the Maoris.'* Such an array of authority is decisive, and disposes of the doubts on this point expressed in the paper. At the same time it does not invalidate the evidence there adduced as to origin. Since the publication of the paper I have received from the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum a photograph of a headless anthropomorphic pendant in bone from Chatham Island. This is closely allied to the greenstone forms figured and has a very important bearing on the problem of the age of this type of pendant. Finally, fresh evidence indicates clearly that the ribs shown on some hei-tiki have no original connection with the forked tongue, but are independent and perhaps relatively more ancient. H.
