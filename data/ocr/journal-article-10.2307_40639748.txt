<plain_text><page sequence="1">Judith Harris. The Bad Secret. Louisiana State University Press. Review by Merrill Leffler For poets as for prose writers, there are taker-outers and putter-inner s . Less is more, F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote to Thomas Wolfe, implying that Wolfe could stand to eliminate a good many of his sentences. By associa- tion, I think of Keats's advice to Shelley, "Load every rift of your subject with ore," and more than a century later W. C. Williams's advice to a young poet, "Don't hammer things down with a maul . . . just let it touch the subject." Are "load every rift" and "just let it touch"- or taker-outers and putter-inners- mutually exclusive? This is a rhetorical question that leads me to Judith Harris's The Bad Secret. In her best poems, Harris offers a rich metaphoric ore while remaining spare in her methods and in the pacing of her lines. Her subjects them- selves are not astonishing; they often have to do with what has been a modern and contemporary mode: memory and what it calls up with mother, father, sisters, and those seemingly innocent episodes that for the poet are pregnant with more than are dreamt of in the minds of mere mortals. The mode often feels worn out to me, this going back and back to prospect for epiphany. "Weave a circle round him thrice / For he on honey- dew hath fed / And drunk the milk of paradise." After so many years of this, it's hard to bring off these poems with freshness, though if it's done, they can be tremendously evocative- not for their originality but for "what oft was said but ne'er so well expressed." These remarks are to help characterize Harris's poetry- they are no backhanded compliment. Her poems are compelling because of the way diction and imagery</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 183 work to clarify feeling- even if you don't believe that poems reflect feel- ings but create them in the process of writing- in the most exacting ways. Precision is the word I keep thinking of. I've heard Harris read from The Bad Secret twice, once at Catholic University and then at the Library of Congress. In her opening remarks and between poems, she referred to the darkness of many of them apolo- getically, in case they should bring us down or depress us. Such remarks divert us from the poems as poems. They are not downers- quite the opposite! Listening to them and then reading The Bad Secret, I felt exhilara- tion. Maybe I come to them with the ear of a mournful Jew who has a high threshold for depression. After all these are poems- they are not Tre- blinka or Baghdad or Darfur or any of a hundred brutal places. The subjects may be dark: the self's wounds, departure, sorrow, death. But the poems hold up their dark subjects to the light of language that is often fresh in imagery and diction. Think of blues music and how we can feel the grief and sorrow riving into us and be grateful for, if not in thrall, holding on for comfort and plea- sures simultaneously. And why? Well, who can really explain the exquisite grief of Billie Holliday's "Strange Fruit," to give one lone example. In trying to get at or understand the distinctiveness of Harris's voice, I tried a small editing exercise on one of them, "Still Waltz." Here's my edited version. Against an empty sky The elm is feathered with gold. On the dark avenue, people pass. Through the lit windows, Empty stairwells and still pianos. Sparrows. The moon. Solitude. In the winter to come The earth will turn its cheek And bear up against the cold. My reduction is a fair Sung- or Tang-like poem. Now here's the poem as it appears in The Bad Secret (which not so incidentally is a beautiful book from Louisiana State University Press in its design and cover art, a com- plement, and compliment, to the poetry.) Against an empty sky The elm is feathered with gold like some apparent wing. On the dark avenue, people pass, lifting their collars. Through the lit windows, Empty stairwells and still pianos. Sparrows drive their hearts into grass. The moon pulls aside its curtain</page><page sequence="3">184 Prairie Schooner as if someone is peering there. Solitude could not find a better partner. In the winter to come the earth will turn its cheek, and bear up against the cold on its own betrayals. It is just a typical evening. My feet burn two shadows in my path. Harris's version is the putter-inner, the load-every-rift-of-your-subject- with-ore version while still retaining the "touch." There is the elaboration of the elm "feathered with gold / like some apparent wing" and "people pass, / lifting their collars"; the delicate hyperbole of "Sparrows drive their hearts into grass"; and the anthropomorphism of "The moon pulls aside its curtain / as if someone is peering there. / Solitude could not find a better partner." And finally the striking metaphor of the last line, con- trasted with the simple line preceding it: "It is just a typical evening. / My feet burn two shadows in my path." Harris's metaphoric mode relies on a quiet hyperbole and an under- stated anthropomorphism as a way of seeing that is original. I don't know of any other poet, for example, who has seen trees in tropes the way she has, the seeing-in-itself fresh and, again, exacting. All night the stumps of these black trees, soundless as God's barking; the trees are wired, Medusa heads plugged into the ground. Who says we can't hear the earth's heart beating? What makes them settle again and again, blue-husked and identical on my neighbor's branch, like stress on a syllable? the one evergreen clogged with inescapable leaves- the trees are plopped and then paralyzed like upside-down octopuses hooked up to heaven's ivs. They will suck on their roots, Babies with pacifiers, The birds tied up in a singsong. Shakespeare excepted, no poet does it all. And though I'm not qualify- ing the pleasures I've had in reading The Bad Secret, I'll mention as an aside what you wouldn't go to Judith Harris's poems for, at least not in this book- the com√©die. Hers is a determined, intense poetry that does</page><page sequence="4">Reviews 185 not step out (perhaps cannot at this stage) of the self and observe the cockeyed absurdity of mucking about in the self the self the self. That is another poetry, not Harris's. What you should go to her poetry for is surprise in ways that are fresh and remain so, that make one- me- want to bring numbers of these poems into memory (my measure) for the pleasure of saying them aloud, rifts loaded with ore, such as "Hatpin," which may even belie my com- ment about comedy: White gloves, red satin, sequined black skirt, squirrel's nest, raccoon, her lips the color of a fire-engine. She is posing in the mirror, with her hand tipping her hip, whistling like a tea-kettle.</page></plain_text>
