<plain_text><page sequence="1">IRANIAN INSTITUTE 121 A PRELIMINARY NOTE ON TWO ARTISTS FROM NISHAPUR By Mehmet Aga-Oglu Very few examples of East Iranian metalwork bear the maker's name, only eleven East Iranian metalworkers having been noted up to the present. Of these, the earliest was a native of Sijistān: ī.Abū Nasr Muhammad ibn Ah- mad, whose signature appears on a late tenth-century bronze bowl in the possession of J. Brummer, New York.1 A group of five artists belong to Herat: 2. Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wāhid, and, 3. Hājib Mas'ud ibn Ahmad, who jointly produced the famous "Bobrinskiî" bucket dated 559 (1163 A.D.), now in the Hermit- age Museum, Leningrad.2 4. Mahmūd ibn Muhammad, the artist of the ewer from the year 577 (1181-2 A.D.), in the Geor- gian State Museum, Tiflis.3 5. Muhammad ibn Nāsir ikn Mu- hammad, whose signature, ac- cording to a communication of V. Kratchkovskaya, appears on a bucket in a Russian private collection.4 1 G.

Their names have been inscribed on a late twelfth-century fragmentary flacon, formerly in the collection of the late Friedrich Sarre, now in the Staatliche Museen, Berlin.6 One artist was a native of the neigh- boring town, Isfarayin: 9. 'Alī ibn . . ., master of a late twelfth-century ewer in the Peytel collection, Paris. The paternal name of the artist is written as (?), which also needs re- examination.7 Finally, there are two more artists: 10. Shāh Malik, the master of a late twelfth-century inkwell in the Peytel collection. Although the origin of the artist has not been given in the form of a nisba , his work shows indisputably that it is East Iranian; 8 and s R. Ettinghausen, The Bobrinski 'Kettle'.

Shādhī al-Naqqāsh, who signed a pen-box dated 607 (1210), made for Majd al-Mulk al-Muzaffar, the vizier of Khurasan, who resided in Marv. The artist's origin like- wise has not been stated in the inscription, but he was probably active in the city of his patron. The pen-box is in the Freer Gal- lery, Washington, D«, C.9 To these names we may now add two more artists, both natives of Nish- apur, and active during the second half of the twelfth century. Their preserved works are two hitherto un- published inkwells.10 On one (Fig. Fig. 1. H. 4 in. New Yorķ, Possession Joseph Brummer INK-WELL, BRONZE INLAID WITH SILVER AND COPPER, NISHAPUR, SELJUQ PERIOD 1) 11 of cast bronze richly ornamented with silver and copper inlay, the upper and lower of three horizontal registers contain, on a raised scrolling arabesque background, silver-inlaid inscriptions, each interrupted thrice by seven-disked rosettes. The middle register is divided by the palmette- shaped fixtures of the hinges into three sections, each occupied by two confronted mounted huntsmen, in strictly heraldic composition, identi- cal in attitudes and similar in actions. In one section they hold falcons; in the second they turn backwards and shoot arrows at flying birds; in the third, they fight beasts standing on the croups of the horses. The cover, sur- mounted by an arabesque-decorated, lobed dome with a knob, carries on the rim a band of interlaced compart- ments, interrupted thrice by the now missing hinges, each enclosing a stand- ing bird with raised tail. On the level surface round the dome is a band composed of three groups of four interlaced circles each, enclosing zodiacal signs, alternating with rect- angular compartments filled with in- scriptions. Further engraved and inlaid decoration on the bottom con- sists of an outer band composed of rosettes, inscriptions, and animals, and in the center a radial rosette sur- rounded by interlaced palmettes. The inscriptions on the body are' of benedictory text. In the upper register it is in elegant naskhī, and reads: 3 a&gt;-' 9 E. Herzfeld, A Bronze Pen-Case.

The inscription of the lower register is in kūfī: i*} ( a_&gt;- ) La) »ULM., i.e., "With the auspiciousness, the blessing, the joy, the happiness, the health, the perfection, the succor, and the longevity to its owner 1" The kūfī inscription on the cover, composed in two superimposed lines, begins with the benediction and ends with the signature of the artist: *UU' J ' ^ J ^ ' (^' J ' i.e., (1) "With the auspiciousness, the blessing, the government, (...); (2) the happiness (. . . .), the vic- tory, and the longevity to its owner! (3) Work of 'Abd al-Razzaq ibn Ma- ssud al-Naisābūrī" (Fig. 2). The second inkwell likewise of cast bronze ornamented with engraving and inlaid with silver and copper is slightly damaged on one side and its bottom is missing (Fig. 3).12 On the body two framing bands containing naskhl inscriptions interlace at regu- lar intervals to form three round medallions. The spaces between these are occupied by the hinges which are 12 H. 4 in. (10 cm.); d. c. 3 in. (7.5 cm.), at bottom. Fig. 3. H. 4 in.

The dome, unusually elegant, is formed of three crouching sphinxes in open-work and relief. The naskhl inscription on the bands and medallions on the body is carelessly inlaid and without diacriti- cal points, and hence is very difficult to read, but in the border of one of the medallions the phrase can be recog-</page><page sequence="4">124 BULLETIN OF THE nized: i.e. /'Be he victorious!" Reserving this inscription for further study, it should be noted that its text is in Persian.

The inscription on the cover rim in kūfī script contains the name of the artist (Fig. 4): i.e., "Work of Nāsir ibn As'ad Naisā- būrī (Fig. 5). Blessing, the govern- ment and health to its owner!" The inscription of this inkwell is also epigraphically of interest. It belongs to a small group of Seljûq metal work on which Persian text occurs side by side with the customary benedictions in Arabic. With these names added to the two previously known artists of Nishapur, we are justified in considering tenta- tively this city as a center of metal production, next in importance to Herat during the Seljûq period.
