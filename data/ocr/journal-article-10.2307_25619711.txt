<plain_text><page sequence="1">LANDSCAPE PAINTING PAST AND PRESENT. Classic art pays comparatively little attention to landscape. In me dieval times it still serves chiefly as a background to figure painting, and it is only in modern art that the artist has devoted his skill to Nature for her own sake. This late development of landscape painting is due in part to the technical difficulties involved in portraying ex tensive out-of-doors scenes. Until the principles of linear perspective were investigated and established by the scientists of the renaissance, uo plausible representation of nature was possible, but ever since, sci ence and careful observation have furnished new and valuable aid to the art of representing light, shade and texture. But the chief and fundamental reason why this branch of painting</page><page sequence="2">160 BRUSH AND PENCIL was so late in coming to its own lay. in the way external nature was viewed by the ancients and the medievals. The Greek mind, though keenly conscious of beauty and surrounded by beautiful aspects of nature, was less keenly alive to natural beauty, because it abstracted the vital principle in the clouds, sea, vegetation and mountains, and con ceived it in the form of gods. What was left seemed to them mere matter, useful and pleasant, to be sure, but devoid of poetic, or intrinsically beautiful qualities. The land furnished food, the wood shade and timber, the sea, means of transportation, but the life and poetry which moderns find in them, had all been transferred to anthropomorphic deities. In medieval art, landscape assumes a more important place, and in many instances reveals a genuine love of natural beauty. Both poet and painter manifest interest in nature, chiefly, however, as a well-kept garden, with trim walks, regular beds of flowers, bright fountains .and shady groves. The interest has shifted from agriculture to horticulture, but the same aversion to the wild, savage, and unuseful aspects of na ture is felt in the medieval mind as in the Greek. Rugged mountains are depicted, to be sure, but they are reserved to suggest retirement from the world, and holy meditation. Reverence is shown for moun tain scenery, but evidently the artist finds no joy in it for its own sake, but as Greek society was at bottom ifrban, so medieval society was rural, and in the latter a love for the sights and sounds of nature made itself felt, despite the rude and warlike nature of the age. It is not, however, till the eighteenth century that we may truly speak of modern landscape painting. Modern feeling for nature is in some respects widely at variance with that of by-gone centuries. Con trary to the clean-cut delineation of earlier art, outlines of mountain, cloud and wood in modern landscape painting are vague and indistinct. The clear blue sky is usually exchanged for cloudy gray; the bright sunshine for transparent gloom, in which things are but dimly discerned. The mystery and suggestiveness of modern renderings of nature find no parallel in the works of earlier painters. The modern feeling for freedom manifests itself in love of trackless sea, of lonely mountain, and of un voyaged river, but the solitude of nature does not depress: the melancholy is tender not bitter. More often the wild, rugged scenery exhilarates the sense, and arouses the mind to endeavor and to victory. Along with this poetic subjective quality on modern landscape paint ing, is a striving for the literal truth with an ardor that is unequaled in the history of art. Not the truth of science, but the truth of appear ance. Not as the scientist by dissection knows that nature is, but as the artist by clear and disciplined vision sees that she appears. It is for this end that he is willing to sacrifice both formal beauty and ethical suggestion. He is at once a realist in his portrayal of natural fact, and (if he is really a poet, as well as a painter), an idealist in his inter pretation of the natural world. Few attain to a wholly satisfactory solution of this doubly difficult problem, but we welcome every approxi mation thereto. W. F. D.ANN.</page></plain_text>
