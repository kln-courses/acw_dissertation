The Council regret to have to announce the death of one of the Honorary Members of the Society, Dr. Sprenger, of Heidelberg, of whose life and work an account appeared in the April number of our Journal. The Council recom mend that the vacancy thus occasioned should be filled up by the election of Mons. James Darmesteter, the dis tinguished Professor of Persian at the College de France, and Secretary af the Soci^te Asiatique. As the members of the Society will be aware, Mons. Darmesteter is the greatest living authority on Zoroastrian Literature, and is distinguished not only for his wide philological knowledge in that and other fields, but also for his thorough grasp</page><page sequence="4">580 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. of historical criticism, and for his mastery of style and power of exposition. It will also be a peculiar pleasure to this Society to be able to confer an honour upon a scholar who adds to his other attainments a very deep and sympathetic acquaintance with English Literature. The result of the year as regards the membership of the Society is that the total number amounted, on the 1st January, 1894, to 493. As our last report contained an analysis and historical sketch of the membership of the Society since its com mencement, we need now only give the total membership for the last six years, including the one under review, which is as follows :? 1889 . . 432 1890 . . 442 1891 .. 451 1892 . * 459 1893 . . 476 1894 . . 493 It will be seen that the slow but steady improvement the Council was able to announce in its last report has been maintained for another year. With the increase in membership (and the care taken to retain no names on the list except those of really subscribing members) the receipts from subscriptions have also shown a slow but steady improvement. Thus the total receipts last year from this source were ?506 2s. 0d., but this year they amount to ?705 14s. 9d. The figures of the total income of the Society show a similar result. After starting at ?1000 in 1831, and suffering many fluctuations in the course of time (falling once, in the year 1859, to ?550), our total income has now not only gradually regained the original sum, but has risen in last year to ?1225 and this year to ?1351 14s. lOd. On the expenditure side the only striking difference to which attention should be called is the item for expendi ture on the Library, which has risen from ?68 lis. 3d.</page><page sequence="5">NOTES OF THE QUARTER. 581 in 1892 and ?30 13s. 7d. in 1891 to ?190 lis. lid. in 1893. Out of this sum ?53 19s. 9d. has been spent in binding which was very much needed, and ?123 14s. 6d. has been required for the new catalogue of the printed books, which is now at last completed, and is ready for issue to members. The Council take this opportunity of congratulating the Society on the completion of a work so urgently needed for many years, and they have passed a special vote of thanks to the Secretary, Professor Rhys Davids, and to the Hon. Librarian, Dr. Oliver Codrington, to whom the Society are much indebted for their services in this behalf. In other respects the work of the Society has gone steadily forward. It is, above all, the value of the articles in the Society's Journal on which its reputation and usefulness so very largely depend; and the Council trust that the members have noticed no falling-ofE in this important part of the Society's work. In conclusion the Council would draw attention to the fact that Mr. Arbuthnot has, at his own expense, brought out, during the year 1893, two new volumes of Oriental translations, being two volumes of Mirkhond, and that further volumes (including one of Assyrian Texts by Mr. Boscawen, and one containing Prof. Co well's version of the Sri Harsha Carita) are in preparation. The Council annex the usual abstract of accounts for the year, and recommend the following officers for election :? 1. By the Rules of the Society five gentlemen retire from the Council, that is; to say : By seniority-? Prof. Douglas and Prof. Bendall. By least attendance? General Maclagan, R.E.

Plunkett, R.E. 2. Under Rule 16 Sir Thomas Wade retires from the Vice-Presidency, and the Council recommend that Sir Thomas F. Wade, G.C.M.G., K.CB., Professor of Chinese in the University of Cambridge, past President of this Society, and Sir William Muir, K.CS.I., D.C.L., LL.D., Principal of the University of Edinburgh, past President of this Society, should be elected Vice-Presidents of the Society. Sir William Hunter, K.CS.I., LL.D. : My Lord, Ladies, and Gentlemen,?I have been asked to propose the adoption of this Report. I feel it is a duty which would, perhaps, have been better discharged by some more regular attendant of the meetings of this Society. I can only say that I am here as often as I can be, and I always regret when I am unable to come. I think the Report presents one or two very satisfactory features. In the first place we find that, although our Secretary speaks of modest progress, we are yet electing double the number of members that we lose. Last year our loss from all sources amounted to 21. Our new members numbered 42. I think you will also consider it a satisfactory feature that we are incorporating into this Society, in ever-increasing numbers, the young Indians, and the grown-up Indians too, who now come to England for study or to reside. I observe that of the 42 new members no fewer than 16 are Indian gentlemen. Several others belong to foreign nationalities, from China to France. The number of Indians and foreign members added last year was fully equal to one-half the total of 42 which represents the</page><page sequence="8">584 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. general addition to our Society. It is satisfactory to find that the labours of the Society are being more and more widely recognised, not only in India itself, but also among foreign workers in Asiatic research. And I venture to think that this is in great degree due to the interest aroused by our Journal under the new arrangements. Before passing from the question of membership, I am sure you will all agree that the Council have wisely exercised their discretion in proposing to appoint Professor Darmesteter as an Honorary Member. They could not have found a man who would reflect greater honour on the Society, or who has done better work for Eastern research. Our income may be summarized, from the historical point of view, as follows. After the Mutiny the Society had a bad time. In 1859 its income amounted to only ?550. By good management not only has that loss been retrieved, but we have mounted up to ?1351, which is a larger income than the Society had even in the days of the East India Company. As regards both our numbers and our resources, the Council and members may fairly hope that they will be able to hand over the Society to the 20th Century in a condition full of promise for the future. But all this material success is as nothing unless our work is worthy of it. The past year seems to have been a peculiarly fruitful one. Apart from the large number of interesting papers which have been read and printed in the Journal, the Society appears to be striking out new lines of research at the interesting point where philology and scholarship touch the boundary of history. We have always been a learned Society; but last year, more than ever, the Society has been able to supply material for scientific history. There are two points at which the work of the Society has come into contact with Indian History. At one it has furnished new connecting links this year, not between the older religions of India (not between the ancient Buddhism and the ancient Brahmanism), but between what</page><page sequence="9">NOTES OF THE QUARTER. 585 I may call the mediaeval religions of India and modern Hinduism. That is an area of knowledge which has been comparatively unexplored; and I feel sure that none who heard Dr. Waddell's papers, or who have read them, can help feeling that a new departure has been made, a departure based upon original research among the vestiges of the mediaeval systems to the North of India. By bringing those mediaeval relics into comparison with the systems which went before, and with the system which has come after and which we call Hinduism, Dr. Waddell has opened up a new field of research?a field rich in materials for the true history of India when it comes to be written. Dr. Waddell indicated how mediaeval Buddhism merged into Hinduism. I should be loath to give offence to anyone present, but I do not believe in the miraculous aspect of theosophy myself, and it seems to me that Dr. Waddell's papers show how the miraculous element came into Buddhism, and, indeed, the route by which it travelled. From this point of view, also, Dr. WaddeLTs lectures have a peculiar value. Another line of research has been opened up. Take the last number, I think, of our Journal. There is a little paper in that number which seemed to me to be of great value. It is by Dr. Gaster upon, I will not say the identity, but upon the resemblance between the life of St. Placidus in Palestine and the Nigrodha Miga Jataka. That story is a curious one, and it points to a new line of enquiry. As Dr. Waddell, and those who are working with him, show us the connection between mediaeval Buddhism and Hinduism ?so we are getting behind Christian Hagiology into a time when, as far as we can see, there was a distinct connection between the religious views and the religious legends of the East and the West. It would be wrong to generalize on slender data, but it almost seems as if we were entering on a new domain of not less interest than that which attaches to the migration of secular fables. I daresay many of us remember the interesting and scholarly remarks of Miss Foley on the subject of the Greek con ception of the wheel of life?the wheel of existence, and</page><page sequence="10">586 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. of the renewed state of existence. They were extremely instructive, and illustrated the possibilities which arise out of such contributions aB Dr. Gaster's remarkable article. Not only, therefore, is our material condition good, but we have been doing good work and are opening out fresh fields of historical work. I cannot pass from this aspect of the case without re ferring to the progress which a Member of our Council, Mr. Arbuthnot, is making in the publication of original texts. It is one of the heroic undertakings of modern scholarship. If you look at his prospectus you will see he asks for no donation or subscription. I think it is a unique position to take up, and 1 hope, as he only asks us to buy the volumes as they come out, that all who can do so will aid him in his self-imposed task. I would now sit down, but I have just received a letter from the President asking me if I had any suggestion to make with a view to rendering this Society more popular. I do not know that I have, or, indeed, that I wish it to be more popular. Yet I may venture to submit one or two remarks. We have, in the first place, a magnificent library. Very few who have not used our library are acquainted with its resources. The rules of the library are extremely liberal, and I am glad to say that at last the Catalogue is ready for distribution to Members. It has been a long work, and a severe task, and I think that the Secretary and Dr. Codrington, and the ladies too who have given us their assistance, deserve our hearty thanks. The completion of this Catalogue will, I hope, render our Library, not only better known, but more available to students who cannot come here, and who wish to ascertain what materials for research are to be found on our shelves. There is one suggestion that occurs to me, and which perhaps I might venture to submit to you. A number of gentlemen come over from India for very short periods. I would submit whether it would not be worth while for the Council to take power to add as temporary members to their Board the most eminent of the scholars who</page><page sequence="11">NOTES OF THE QUARTER. 587 thus come over for a short time from India. I should be very happy if Indian gentlemen of learning and dis tinction could thus be brought upon our Board. It is not always possible for them to go through the tardy process of election ; but I think it is of importance that our Council should be in touch with the work that is going on in India. It might be worth while to consider whether men like Dr. Waddell, for example, or native scholars of high reputation, when they came over for a season, might not receive the honour?which I regard as a great honour?of being placed on the Council of this Society. I wish to say a word about the excellent work that is being done by the Asiatic Society in Bengal. I do not know whether you have seen Sir Charles Elliott's address, as President of that Society. It is a careful summary of Oriental research during the last two years. Sir Charles Elliott is Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, and he has found time, in addition to his great administrative task, to write a comprehensive and most valuable account of what has been done in recent Indian scholarship. Several learned Societies make a distinction between the subscription of ladies and gentlemen; that is to say, an effort is being made by such Societies to interest and incorporate ladies more largely into their field of labour. We know what excellent work has been done for us in our Journal by ladies, and what useful work they have kindly done for us in our library and in the executive work of the Society under the Secretary's control and direction. I leave it just as a suggestion whether it would be possible, by more favourable terms, to induce ladies to join us in larger numbers than hitherto. Again, I do not know whether it would be possible, though I have often thought it might be possible, to have some more friendly method of incorporating foreign scholars than the necessarily restricted system of honorary membership. I would ask the President whether an intermediate position could not be found between honorary membership, which is a very great honour, and that of ordinary membership.</page><page sequence="12">588 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. Referring to the work that is being done on the Con tinent, I should like to say a word about a new Dutch periodical, entitled the Netherlands' " Kolonial Centraal Blad." It is an admirable little paper, and unites a certain amount of commercial intelligence with real research. We may welcome it as a sign that the commercial public of Europe, as well as of this country, are interesting them selves not merely in the aspects of Eastern trade, but also in the higher and more enduring relations of the East and West. My Lord, Ladies, and Gentlemen,? I have very much pleasure in proposing the adoption of this Report. (Cheers.) Colonel Plunkett : I have been asked to second the adoption of the Report, and if I had known I was going to speak on the subject, and if I had prepared any remarks perhaps they would not have been much to the point, because I am sure that everything that can have been said has been said by Sir William Hunter, and I should, therefore, have found he had taken it out of my mouth. There is one point that Sir William mentioned which is rather a novel one, namely, in regard to the increasing numbers in which Indian gentlemen are joining this Society. It seems to me a pleasing feature of the last Oriental Congress to see the numbers that came over and the pleasant way in which they associated with Englishmen in this country. It seems to me that this increasing number of educated Indians, who are joining us in literary and historic work on that very catholic basis, will not only have an excellent effect on the work of the Society, but promises to have a very general social and, I might almost say, political effect. This is very desirable, and I hope it will not be confined to India. It will be remembered that we have had a few from Persia, Egypt, and other countries. I hope the Society will continue to work on that very catholic basis, that it will not attempt to work on one line, but that there will be contributions from ali Oriental countries and languages, and that it may lead, in future, to a desirable and satisfactory assimilation, and</page><page sequence="13">NOTES OF THE QUARTER. 589 that we may have the same experience with Egypt, Persia, and other Oriental countries, which this Society is evidently enjoying in the case of India. I have only to congratulate the Council on the excellent work they have done for the Society and the way in which affairs have been carried on during the past year. I have great pleasure in seconding the adoption of this Report. The President (who was received with cheers on rising) said: Ladies and Gentlemen,?I have heard with the greatest interest the speech of Sir William Hunter. I shall not make many observations, for I know you are all very desirous of hearing the interesting paper that Mr. Rogers is going to give us. I cannot, however, allow the Resolution to be put without stating how deeply I feel the great loss which not only this Society has sustained, but which learning, and not only Oriental learning, but learning in general, has sustained, by the premature death of that remarkable Scotchman, Professor Robertson Smith. I am sure you will all feel that the loss of a man who had a reputation which has spread widely beyond our own frontiers may be called a national loss. A life full of promise has been cut short. The loss to the University of Cambridge, where we have so many distinguished members, is a loss which this Society shares. (Hear, hear.) I wish, in the first place, to thank the persons who have been good enough to read interesting papers at our meetings and to contribute very valuable papers to the Journal of this Society. This Society is entirely dependent upon voluntary work, and the Council appreciates and is very grateful for the contributions they have received from so many quarters, as Sir William Hunter has pointed out, in an increasing measure. What I should like to dwell upon is that the Council of this Society have a peculiar responsibility. What is noticeable is the much greater importance attached elsewhere than in this country to Oriental learning?in other countries such as France,</page><page sequence="14">590 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. Germany, and Austria,?which are certainly not more interested than we are in the development of Oriental learning, in the origin and history of Oriental languages* and in all that is connected with the great and ancient East. The suggestions made by Sir William Hunter I need not say will have to be considered by the Council. Most of those suggestions, I think, are extremely valuable, especially what he said about strengthening our line of communications with foreign Orientalists. I think I am right in saying that in former years the Society had corresponding members, and that category of members might well be revived. I concur in what Sir William Hunter said, that this Society must proceed cautiously when it gets hints to make itself more popular. This Society is essentially one for the promotion of research and learning; and we ought not to run any risk, whilst maintaining that intellectual character, by yielding to democratic impulses. At the same time I may add that the Council are not oblivious of the fact that the interest which is being more and more widely taken in Indian subjects by a certain section of the public entails on the Society the responsibility to see that proper guidance should be forth coming so that wisdom and enthusiasm may not be dis sociated. With regard to practical steps that have been taken by this Society I would remind you that at one of the meetings (I believe it was when Dr. Waddell read his paper) we were asked to call the special attention of Sir Charles Elliott, Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, to the excavations of the remains of Asoka's city at Patna. I may mention that Sir Charles Elliott, who is a very methodical correspondent, replied immediately. He said that nothing would give him greater pleasure than to further the wishes of the Society, and that we might be sure of his hearty co-operation. With regard to Mr. Arbuthnot's contribution we cannot forget that Lord Northbrook has given us a handsome contribution towards the cost of publishing Professor</page><page sequence="15">NOTES OF THE QUARTER. 591 Cowell's book. And, I may add, that a proposal from Mr. Sturdy to publish at his own expense a translation of the Panca-dasi ? a work which will be extremely valuable to scholars?has just been accepted by the Council. I admit that I was quite unaware of the Dutch publi cation to which Sir William Hunter has alluded, and I hope he will oblige me by sending me a copy of it, but it is undoubtedly fresh evidence of the fact that the East is getting every day nearer to the West. I also heartily agree with Sir William Hunter that it is a most propitious sign of the times that we are able to number so many of our native scholars among our members, and I can assure him that anything we can do to make our library and the offices of the Society accessible to Indians who are staying here for the purpose of study or for other purposes, will give us the greatest pleasure. Let me allude in conclusion to an important event. You are aware that a scheme is before the public to establish in London, on a better basis than the existing one, an Oriental School. The Council have to-day adopted a .resolution that they consider it to be the duty of this Society to do all in its power to promote the establishment of such a School, and to remove the reproach from a country like ours that so little has been done hitherto as compared with what has been done in other countries. I trust that this step will meet with your approval, and that you will agree that this Society should heartily support the scheme. It has been moved and seconded that this resolution be adopted. Those who are in favour of the resolution will please signify the same. [The resolution was carried unanimously.] Professor Rhys Davids: I have received a letter from Dr. Gaster, who is unfortunately unable to be present. (The letter, suggesting an alteration in one of the rules regulating the use of the library, was then read.) On that, my Lord, I ought to say that the only op portunity for changing a Rule, unless a special general</page><page sequence="16">592 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. meeting be convened, is at the Annual Meeting. And I presume Dr. Gaster, as I received the letter only this morning, has written this letter to me with the view of its being laid before the Annual Meeting. The President: You say there is no way of the Council altering the Rule? Professor Rhys Davids : No, I have considered the matter. Mr. Robert N. Cust: We must look it up before we alter a Rule in a hasty way, and without notice. Professor Rhys Davids: The Rule says: "The Anniversary Meeting of the Society shall ordinarily be held on the second Tuesday in May to receive and consider a Report of the Council on the state of the Society ; to receive the Report of the Auditors on the Treasurer's Accounts; to elect the Council and Officers for the ensuing year; to elect Honorary Members ; and to deliberate on such other questions as may be proposed relative to the affairs of the Society." Mr. Robert N. Cust: I think the matter must be referred to the Council with a suggestion that it be submitted to the Society. It may be that we should extend the time, but we cannot do it in this way. It is impossible. (Hear, hear.) The President : I agree with Mr. Cust that a matter of this kind must be referred to the Council and should come before a General Meeting with a report of the Council whether they are in favour of it or not. Therefore the matter had better be mentioned to them with that view. Mr. Alexander Rogers, M.R.A.S., then read his paper on "A Notice of the Mantiq ut Tair (Language of the Birds), a Persian mystic poem." After referring to M. Garcin de Tassy's work on the same subject the writer of the paper gave a short account of the author of the poem, Muhammad Ibrahim Farid ud Din Attar, who wrote about 1150, and was killed by the soldier8 of Jenghis Khan. The paper then summarized the Sufi doctrines as found in the poem, and gave a detailed epitome of the whole work. The paper concludes?</page><page sequence="17">NOTES OF THE QUARTER. 593 In the short space of an article it would have been impossible to give more than a general sketch of the most salient points of the allegory, and the doctrines held up in it for belief and practical observance. In the original the arguments adduced by the Hoopoe in contravention of the objections raised by the birds, and the admonitions addressed by him to them, as well as the descriptions of the seven valleys on the road of Faith, are illustrated by copious anecdotes, only a few of which have been alluded to. A proper idea of them could only have been conveyed by a more or less full translation, very difficult to make in consequence of the obscurity of many of the mystic allusions with which they abound, and such a translation would have swelled this article to the size of a book. It will have been seen that the allegory traverses the whole range of ethics common to all religions that have advanced beyond the stage of mere fetishism, and although there is much in the ideas contained in it against which the com mon-sense, not to say the religious belief, of professors of Christianity must revolt, its morality, as a whole, is such as to meet with the entire concurrence of the pious and God-fearing of all creeds. Its mysticism, unsurpassed in the works of any of the Persian mystic writers, may be studied with curiosity at least, if not with sympathy or toleration. June 12th, 1894.?E. L. Brandreth, Esq.

Professor William Robertson Smith.?On March 31st last, at Christ's College, Cambridge, after a painful and protracted illness, supported with admirable fortitude, died Professor William Robertson Smith, in his forty-eighth year. By his premature death his country loses not merely one of her greatest scholars, but one of her most brilliant geniuses. So multifarious were his attainments, so many sided his culture, so profound, and, at the same time, so encyclopaedic his learning, that few among us are in a position to do more than dimly realize the magnitude of the loss which we have sustained; while fewer still are qualified to appraise the work of a life which, all too short as it was, was filled to overflowing with endeavour and achievement. It needs time, and the combined efforts of those best qualified to estimate the value of his labours in the many different fields of knowledge which he so strenuously and so fruitfully cultivated, ere a worthy record can be written of that rich and active existence; and in the meanwhile all that we, who knew him and loved him, can do, is to set forth, each according to his power, such aspect or aspects of his life and work as our narrower horizons permit us to behold. It was at Keig, in Aberdeenshire, on Nov. 8th, 1846, that he whose death we lament was born; and there, on April 4th of this year, his mortal remains were laid to rest. His education, until he reached his fifteenth year, was entirely conducted by his father, the Rev. William Pirie Smith, a Minister of the Free Church of Scotland, equally re markable for piety and learning. The respective merits of home and school training have been much discussed; but here, at least, the results of the former were most happy ; for when, in 1861, Robertson Smith, accompanied by his brother George, entered the University of Aberdeen, he was already well versed in Classics, Mathematics, and English, besides having some knowledge of Modern, Languages,</page><page sequence="19">PROFESSOR WILLIAM ROBERTSON SMITH. 595 and, it is said, of Hebrew. Thus equipped, and urged on alike by the example of his associates, the stimulating influence of his teachers (especially Professors Geddes and Bain), and the restless activity of his own keen intellect, he attained marked distinction in almost every subject to which he turned his attention, and finally graduated in 1865, in which year also he obtained the Gold Medal at Aberdeen and the Ferguson Scholarship (open to all Scotland) in Mathematics. Yet even with these early triumphs (for he was not yet twenty years of age) came the first warnings of that malady against which the last two years of his life were an almost continual struggle; and the warning was emphasized by the death, in 1866, of the brother who had hitherto been his constant companion and fellow-student. It was then that he determined to enter the ministry of the Free Church; in pursuance of which object he enrolled himself as a student in the New College, Edinburgh, in the autumn of that year. Here he continued until the spring of 1870, a period of three and a half years, during which his re markable achievements in the fields of Mathematics, Physics, and even Metaphysics, did not divert him from pursuing with unremitting assiduity his studies in Divinity and the Semitic Languages. During the latter half of this period he acted as Assistant to Professor Tait, and published several remarkable papers on subjects connected with both Physical and Metaphysical enquiry; during it also he became ac quainted, at the Edinburgh Evening Club, with John F. M'Lennan, the author of Primitive Marriage, by whom his attention seems first to have been directed towards those problems of social archaeology to the elucidation of which he afterwards so largely contributed.1 Edinburgh alone, however, with all the facilities which it afforded him for deepening and extending a knowledge already sufficiently remarkable both for depth and extent, 1 Most notably in his Marriage and Kinship amongst the early Arabians, published in 1885; and his Religion of the Semites (Burnett Lectures, 1888-9), published in 1889.</page><page sequence="20">596 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. did not suffice him. From Professor Davidson, indeed, he learned much Hebrew; but he wanted more, and so, partly to learn German (wherein he afterwards became very proficient, speaking and writing it not only with fluency and ease, but with elegance and accuracy), partly to increase his knowledge of the Semitic languages, and to acquaint himself with the views of the German divines and critical theologians, he spent a semester at Bonn in 1867. There he lodged in the house of Professor Schaarschmidt, attended the lectures of Karaphausen, and became acquainted with the teaching of Rothe, by which he was much influenced. In the summer of 1869 he again went to Germany, this time to Gottingen, where he followed the lectures of Lotze and Bertheau, absorbed the ideas of Ritschl the theologian, and was associated with Klein as an active member of the Mathematisches Verein. Ewald, though suspended, and forbidden to lecture, on political grounds, was a felt influence. In the spring of 1870 Robertson Smith was appointed Professor of Hebrew in the Aberdeen Free Church College, being then not twenty-four years of age; and at the beginning of the ensuing session he delivered his Inaugural Lecture on " What History teaches us to seek in the Bible." His teaching included formal lectures, as well as the philo logical and grammatical instruction which constituted the necessary, if arduous, preparation for a full and intelligent comprehension of these; and, if the number of regular students who attended his classes was comparatively small, we may be sure, to judge by his Cambridge lectures on Arabic, that his every utterance was eagerly listened for, and greedily absorbed. Few lecturers, indeed, can succeed in imparting, even to the most attractive subject, that interest with which his extraordinary range of knowledge, breadth of view, and fertility of illustration, enabled him to invest passages, seemingly the most sterile and arid, of the texts which he chose to expound. In the summer of 1872 he again returned to Gottingen</page><page sequence="21">PROFESSOR WILLIAM ROBERTSON SMITH. 597 fo pursue his Semitic studies under Lagarde ; became acquainted with Wellhausen and Hoffmann ; and, generally speaking, completed that knowledge of the personalities, the methods, and the achievements of Continental scholars, especially Orientalists, for which he, like the late Dr. William Wright, his illustrious predecessor in the Sir Thomas Adams Professorship (now, alas ! once more left vacant), was so conspicuous. The importance of this it seems right to emphasize very strongly, because it is just here that English Orientalism is weakest and most in need of reform. Contracting our horizons to the limits of the British Empire, we are apt to ignore, or grievously underestimate, the work done by Continental Orientalists, and to imagine that we occupy a respectable, or even a distinguished, position in Oriental studies, whereas, in fact, we are, speaking generally, far surpassed in this field of knowledge by France, Germany, Holland, and Russia, if not by other European nations. From Professor Robertson Smith's sustained relations and correspondence with Con tinental scholars his friends and pupils derived the greatest advantage, and that in two ways: they were prevented from attacking problems long since solved, and wasting the seed of their endeavour upon an exhausted soil; and, when occasion offered, they were personally made known to the leading workers in this department of Science. The regular summaries of the more important theological and critical articles appearing in French, German, and Dutch periodicals which Professor Robertson Smith regularly con tributed at this time to the British and Foreign Evangelical Revieui would afford further evidence, if such were needed, of the value of these relations. In 1874 the death of Professor Fairbairn, of Glasgow, left a vacancy on the Old Testament Revision Committee, and this Professor Robertson Smith was appointed to fill. Thus did he first become personally acquainted with Dr. William Wright, between whom and himself a warm friendship soon grew up. This may be said to mark the first beginning of his connection with Cambridge; which, however, might never</page><page sequence="22">598 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. have produced any definite result had it not been for an event which had occurred shortly before, and paved the way for his entry into our midst. In 1873 or 1874 he accepted a proposal made to him by Professor Baynes, then sole editor of the new edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, that he should contribute certain articles connected with Theology and Biblical Criticism ; of which those headed " Angel " and on " Bible," destined to arouse so great a storm, appeared in 1875. This is not the place to revive a theological controversy now well-nigh twenty years old, even were the writer in any way competent to pronounce an opinion on the matter. One fact connected with it deserves, however, to be recorded. The first attack on the alleged dangerous tendencies of the articles in question did not come from within the Free Church, but from the Edinburgh Evening Courant, an organ hostile to that body, which, in violent and inflammatory language, denounced the views therein embodied. The Free Church College Committee, thus compelled, as it were, to take action, appointed a sub-Committee, on May 17th, 1876, to enquire into the matter. On October 17th of the same year this sub-Committee reported the results of its de liberations ; though absolving Professor Robertson Smith of heresy by a large majority, they " continued to regard his position with grave concern," nor did the explanations which he offered "relieve their apprehensions." The case trailed on; and, pending its final settlement, Professor Robertson Smith was bidden to suspend his teaching, until, in May, 1881, he was finally deprived of his Chair, though even then his opinions were not formally condemned. In the spring of the same year, on " the invitation of some six hundred prominent Free Churchmen in Edinburgh and Glasgow, who deemed it better that the Scottish public should have an opportunity of understanding the position of the newer criticism than that they should condemn it unheard," he delivered his series of lectures on " The Old Testament in the Jewish Church"; and the University of Aberdeen marked its appreciation of his learning by conferring on</page><page sequence="23">PROFESSOR WILLIAM ROBERTSON SMITH. 599 him the Doctorate of Law. In the following autumn, too, he became joint-editor, and in 1887, on the death of Professor Baynes, sole editor, of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, a post for which his extraordinary range of knowledge peculiarly fitted him, and in which he compelled the admiration of all. The period of his suspension had other consolations (and surely they were no less deserved than needed!) to com pensate him for all that he suffered. With his intense desire to get at the root of every matter, and that keen interest in humanity and all things human for which he was no less remarkable than for his knowledge of books, his scholarship, and his critical acumen, it was but natural that he should desire to visit the East, and, by observing the actual state and characteristics of the Semitic peoples, especially the Arabs, to complete and perfect his views of their past history. The opportunity for the accomplishment of this desire had now presented itself, and he hastened to take advantage of it. One winter was passed in Egypt, Syria, and Palestine; a second partly in Arabia itself. During the former he assiduously prosecuted his Arabic studies at Cairo, where he became acquainted with Spitta Bey; during the latter, after again visiting Egypt, he proceeded to Jedda, whence he boldly pushed his explora tions into the interior as far as Ta'if and the precincts of the Holy City of Mecca. Some of the results of these journeys were embodied by him in a series of letters, filled with observations of the utmost value, which he contributed to the Scotsman. That these letters should be reprinted in a more accessible form is most earnestly to be desired, for they are, especially those relating to his Arabian journey, of a great and enduring value, which the most distinguished Semitic scholars in Europe were the first to recognise. The testimonials sent in by Professor Robertson Smith, when he offered himself as a candidate for the Lord Almoner's Professorship of Arabic at Cambridge in 1882, lie before me (and seldom, I should think, have testimonials stronger or better attested been offered by any candidate for a similar</page><page sequence="24">600 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. post), and in nearly all of them emphasis is laid on the importance of these journeys. Thus Baron von Kremer says, in a letter dated Dec. 5, 1882, " Ich konnte keinen englischen Gelehrten nennen den ich so gerne auf Palmers Stelle begrussen wurde als Sie. Durch Ihren Aufenthalt in Aegypten, Ihre Reise in Arabien haben sie den Orient und seine Bewohner aus eigener Anschauung kennen gelernt, und ausserdem der arabischen Sprache als einer lebenden sich bedienen gelernt, ein Vortheil den die meisten unserer Orientalisten nicht besitzen. Einige Ihrer miind lichen Mittheilungen iiber die Hudheil-Bedulnen und ihren Dialekt benutze ich soeben bei einer Arbeit die ich unter der Feder habe." And Professor Noldeke, after speaking of Robertson Smith's profound knowledge of Hebrew and of the Old Testament, continues, "Sollte aber dieser Umstand auch fur die Qualification fur eine 'arabische' Professur als unwesentlich erachtet werden, so ist es doch jedenfalls yon grosser Bedeutung dass Robertson-Smith den Orient selbst kennt und sich namentlich auch in der Heimath der arabischen Sprache langere Zeit aufgehalten hat. Seine in einem schottischen Journal erschienenen, ganz anspruch losen Reiseberichte aus dem Hijaz gehoren unbedingt zu dem Instructivisten, was iiber Arabien geschrieben ist; es ware sehr zu wiinschen, dass dieselben in Buchform erschienen. So urtheilen, um das belaufig zu erwahnen, auch meine Freunde Professor Socin, der ja selbst lange im Orient gewesen ist, und Professor Thorbecke, einer der grundlichsten Kenner des Arabischen, die es giebt." Travel or residence in the East does not, indeed, make an Orientalist; but it must ever remain a most important adjunct to his education. Books are to be interpreted through men rather than men by books. No one recognised this more clearly than Robertson Smith; the fauna and flora, the physical geography, and the antiquities of the countries which he visited ali interested him, but the people interested him most of all. " We cared for the modern Egyptians," he says, in a letter dated March llth, 1879, and written on the Nile, near Siut, " quite as much as for</page><page sequence="25">PROFESSOR WILLIAM ROBERTSON SMITH. ?01 the ruins, and often found it pleasant to loiter for a day in some country place where tourists seldom land." He was quick to discern not only what was novel and interest ing, but what was good in the people: he did not speak of "natives" as though they were an inferior order of beings; he dealt with them as fellow-men, thereby winning their confidence and affection, and gaining such insight into their minds and characters as the arrogant and domineeriug traveller can never attain. In the summer of 1882 the Lord Almoner's Chair of Arabic at Cambridge was left vacant by the tragic and lamentable death of Professor Palmer. Robertson Smith offered himself as a candidate, and on New Year's Day of the year 1883 received from Lord Alwyne Compton the notification of his election. No choice could have been wiser, or better calculated to promote the best interests of Cambridge. Robertson Smith came into residence at once, and from the first threw himself heart and soul, not only into his own special work, but into the general life and work of the University, Till the year 1885, when he was elected fellow of Christ's, he was a member of Trinity College. On Mr. Bradshaw's death in 1886 he was ap pointed University Librarian, and in 1889 he succeeded Dr. Wright as Sir Thomas Adams Professor of Arabic? a worthy successor to that incomparable man. The debt which Cambridge, and in particular her Oriental School, owes to these two great teachers it would be impossible to overstate. In every office which he filled, in every function which he was called upon to discharge, Professor Robertson Smith displayed the same conscientious thoroughness, the same unremitting energy, the same clearness of vision and fixity of purpose. Whether in the Library and the Lecture-room, or on Board and Syndicate; whether working for his College, or his University, or in the high cause of Science, which is above and beyond these, and for which they exist, the same untiring activity characterized all that he did. He was as swift to discern the general principles</page><page sequence="26">602 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. underlying particular forms as to devise the forms most appropriate to secure the success of general principles. That one alike so willing and so competent should be surcharged with work was but natural; that his constitu tion, never of the strongest, should suffer from the strain, was, alas! inevitable. Yet it was not till the autumn of 1892 that his failing health began to cause grave anxiety to his friends, while almost to the last his unflagging courage and sustained cheerfulness kept our hopes alive. Appointed President of the Semitic Section of the International Con gress of Orientalists held in London early in the September of that year, he discharged the onerous duties of that position in the most masterly manner; and never did his spirits appear higher, never were his extraordinary in tellectual activity and brilliancy of conversation more apparent, than while he was surrounded, during the last two day8 of the Congress week, by the little band of Con tinental scholars (including several of the most distinguished Arabists in Europe), whom it was the privilege of Cambridge to entertain as her guests. On the memory of those two days he continued till the end to dwell with the greatest pleasure; and by us also, who were privileged to bear a part in them, they will be ever remembered, not less than those later, sadder days, when, powerless to aid, and bowed down by the sense of impending calamity, we watched the daily wasting of that fragile frame, and realized that the brave bright spirit which animated it, for all its undimmed lustre, was not long for this world. He is gone, our master and our friend, on whose strength, even when he was weakest, we were wont to lean; he who was so wise in counsel, so swift of help, leaving a void among us which none can fill. Often, as he lay stretched on his couch of suffering, did we bring to him our difficulties and our dilemmas, and seldom indeed did we come in vain! No matter how great his weariness or how severe his pain, he would make the effort rather than suffer us to go away disappointed. And what knowledge was his! Every one of the vast number of books which</page><page sequence="27">GENERAL ROBERT MACLAGAN. 603 composed his library he seemed to know from end to end. No matter what the question: "Fetch me such and such a book," he would say (when he no longer had strength to rise from his couch), " it stands on such and such a shelf, and is bound and lettered thus and thus." And when it was brought, with deft, eager 'hands he would turn over the leaves, until the desired passage was found, and the proffered problem solved. We mourn his loss with deep and heartfelt sorrow, sorrow which words are powerless to express. But we have a higher duty than to give utterance to unavailing laments. He is taken from us, he whom we loved and honoured, but his influence abides in our midst. Let it be ours to show that we are not altogether unworthy of such a teacher, not altogether incapable of carrying on the work for which he lived and in which he died.1 Edward G. Browne. 2. General Robert Maclagan, R.E., LL.D., F.R.S.E., F.R.G.S., M.R.A.S.?General Robert Maclagan?a member of the Council of this Society?died on the 22nd April, to the deep regret of his colleagues and numerous friends in England and India. Up to the winter of 1892 he enjoyed excellent health, and was busily engaged in the work of the many Societies -? literary, scientific, charitable, and religious?of which he was a most efficient and valued member. During the winter of 1892 he suffered from congestion of the lungs, and while staying near Loch Earne, last autumn, was attacked with internal haemorr hage, which caused his friends grave anxiety ; but he rallied from the attack and was removed to Edinburgh, and afterwards to his home in South Kensington, where he gained strength and spent the early part of the present 1 For many of the facts embodied in this notice I desire to express my indebtedness to Mr. John Sutherland Black, and also to articles which appeared in No. 379 of the Cambridge Review (April 26), No. 32 of the Bookman (May), and No. 19 of Vol. xi. of Alma Mater, the Aberdeen University Magazine.</page><page sequence="28">604 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. year at Torquay. After returning to his home he caught a chill; this was followed by a return of the haemorrhage, from which he died. General Maclagan was born at Edinburgh on December 14th, 1820, and was one of a distinguished family of seven sons. His father, David Maclagan, M.D., served in the Peninsular War, and was afterwards President both of the Royal College of Physicians and Royal College of Surgeons at Edinburgh, and Physician to Her Majesty's Forces in Scotland. Of the General's six brothers one is the present Archbishop of York, one (the eldest) is Sir Douglas Maclagan, Professor of Medical Jurisprudence and Public Health in the University of Edinburgh; another, Philip Whiteside Maclagan, M.D., who died in 1892, was a dis tinguished botanist and devoted to religious and philanthropic work at Berwick-upon-Tweed. The subject of this notice was educated at the High School and University of Edinburgh, and entered the Engineer Service of the East India Company in 1839, after a brilliant career at Addiscombe?at the close of which he was presented with the " sword of honour." In 1842 he joined the Bengal Corps of Sappers and Miners, and the following year was appointed Surveyor of Canals and Forests in Sind. When the first Sikh war broke out (December, 1845) he was moving towards Firozepore, and afterwards joined the camp of Sir Charles Napier, whom he accompanied to Lahore. He was present at the grand review of the army held on March 5th, 1846 (after the victory of Sobraon), and was afterwards placed in charge of the defences of the city. In 1847 he was selected for the post of first Principal of the Government Civil Engineering College at Rurki, an institution founded by Mr. Thomasou, the Lieutenant-Governor of the North -West Provinces, for affording scientific training to Europeans and natives of India, in view to their employment on Public Works, and organized a scheme of studies which has been maintained, it is believed, with little modification up to the present time. In 1852 he took his first furlough, and devoted part of it</page><page sequence="29">GENERAL ROBERT MACLAGAN. 605 to a tour through Palestine to Baalbec, Damascus, and Constantinople, On return from furlough he was rer appointed to his old post, which he continued to fill with conspicuous success until 1860; meanwhile, during the Mutiny of 1857, he took part in the suppression of dis order in and around Rurki, and received the thanks of Government for his services. From 1860 until the date of his retirement in 1879, he held the appointment of Chief Engineer and Secretary to the Government of the Punjab'in the Department of Public Works. During his career in India no opportunity was afforded him of earning distinction in the Field, but his work was important and responsible, while his singularly noble character, combining, as it did, extensive knowledge, keen intelligence, scholarly culture, and well-balanced judgment with rare modesty, deep religious principle, wide sympathies, and a temper absolutely perfect, earned the hearty respect and affectionate regard of all who knew him. On the termination of his service in India, the native members of the Public Works' Department in the Punjab founded in his honour, at the University College of Lahore, an annual prize or scholarship for the native student who most distinguished himself in practical engineering. After retirement he became an active member of various scientific, literary, and religious Societies. He was on the Council of the Royal Geographical and Royal Asiatic Societies; on the Committees of both the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel and the Church Missionary Society, a member of the Indian Church Aid Association, and, since 1887, Honorary Secretary to the Board of Missions for the Province of Canterbury; he also took great interest in the Home for Asiatics at Limehouse. He produced no large work, but was, at different times, a contributor to the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, the Calcutta Review, the Journal of the British Association, and the Journal of the Society of Arts, and was the author of several articles in the Encyclopaedia Britannica (9th edition) ; and at the time of his death was engaged upon</page><page sequence="30">606 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. a Life of Akbar, with special reference to his religious views and policy regarded from a Christian standpoint. In 1890 he received the honorary degree of LL.D. from the University of Edinburgh. General Maclagan's work as Engineer and as Philanthro pist has been or will be dealt with elsewhere. Here we desire to place on record his services in the cause of Oriental research, and in furtherance of the work of this Society. The following is a list of his principal writings on subjects connected with the East:? Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal.?Fragments of the History of Mooltdn, Derajet and Buhdioalpoor, from Persian MSS. (1845); Early Asiatic Fire Weapons (1876). Calcutta Review.?Spelling of Indian Names (1873). Journal of British Association. ? The Rivers of India (1885). Journal of Royal Asiatic Society.?Memoir of the late Sir H. Yule (1890). National Review.?India?The Empire and the Natives (1884). Encyclopaedia Britannica (9th ed.). ? Articles: Kdshi, Kashmir, Lahore, Mahmud, Punjab. To this it should be added that the late Sir H. Yule, in the preface to his " Travels of Marco Polo " and " Glossary of Anglo-Indian Names," records his grateful acknowledg ments to General Maclagan for the assistance rendered by him in the preparation of those works. As Head of the Department of Public Works in the Punjab he co-operated heartily with the late General Sir Alexander Cunningham in his archaeological survey of the province, and with the Curator of the Museum at Lahore in getting together and arranging the valuable collection of Indo Bactrian Sculptures from Yusufzai, on the N.W. frontier; and in 1861 he took part in an attempt to establish at Lahore a branch of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. The attempt failed, not in consequence of any want of zeal on the part of General Maclagan and those associated with him, but owing to the frequent change of officers and the</page><page sequence="31">THE REV. DR. RICHARD MORRIS. 607 little leisure left to those engaged in administrative work for the preparation of scientific papers. Without being an Orientalist, in the technical sense, General Maclagan was well versed in Persian, Urdu, and Sanskrit literature, and took a keen interest in Asiatic studies, and his wide range of knowledge and sound judgment were of the greatest value in our discussions. As a member of the Council of this Society he was exemplary in his at tendance, and a most useful member of Committees; while to all his friends his loss will be severe indeed. "It is rarely," says a writer in the Guardian, "that such a com bination of clear, accurate thought, balanced judgment, and large-hearted sympathy is found in one man; and modesty is hardly an adequate term for the profound Christian humility which characterized all he said or did." General Maclagan married in 1855 Patricia, daughter of Patrick Gilmour, Esq., D.L., J.P., of Londonderry, who survives him with four sons and two daughters. Of the sons two are in India, one a Captain in the Royal Engineers and the other a rising member of the Indian Civil Service. The General's remains were buried in the Dean Cemetery, Edinburgh, where many members of his family are interred. Thomas Henry Thornton. The following obituary is from the Academy of May the 19th:? 3. The Rev. Dr. Richard Morris.?The small band of scientific philologists in this country has suffered an irre parable loss by the death of Dr. Richard Morris, dis tinguished alike for his work in Early English and Pali. For more than two years he had been prostrated by an incurable and distressing illness, which he bore with characteristic fortitude, nursed only by his devoted wife. He died on Saturday, May 12th, at the little railway side hamlet of Harold Wood, in Essex. He was buried on Thursday at Hornchurch.</page><page sequence="32">608 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. Though a Londoner "all his life, Richard Morris was (we believe) of Welsh descent. He was born at Bermondsey in 1833, and educated at the Battersea Training College. Of his early years we know little more than can be gained from the titles and dates of his published works. But it is certain that he was, in the main, self-educated, being stimulated to work at MSS. in the British Museum and elsewhere by the example of, his life-long friend, Dr. F. J. Furnivall. In 1871 he took orders in the Church of England, his title being a curacy in Southwark. About the same time he became lecturer in English at King's College School. In 1875 he was appointed to the head mastership of the Royal Masonic Institution for Boys, at Wood Green, in Middlesex, which post he held for about sixteen years. At no time did he receive the advantage of University education, or of University endowment. His degree of LL.D. came from Lambeth, having been given him by Archbishop Tait in 1870. Four years later Oxford honoured itself by conferring on him the honorary degree of M.A. When his health was already broken, Mr. Gladstone granted him a pension of ?150 .on the Civil List, which he enjoyed for little more than twelve months. His very first publication shows the character of his early studies. It was a treatise on " The Etymology of Local Names" (1857). This was followed by a small volume of "Lectures on the Excellency of the Bible" (1858). Then, after an interval, began his long series of contri butions to the Early English Text Society, which lasted through the sixties and the seventies. It is needless to enumerate the titles here. All alike are models of editorial conscientiousness, being marked by absolute fidelity in the transcription and collation of MSS., and by most illuminating introductions. The severity of his labours during this period was varied by one or two lighter tasks. In 1866 he edited Chaucer, in six volumes, for Bell's Aldine edition of British poets (second ed. 1891), which remained the standard text until the appearance this year of the Oxford Chaucer of his friend and fellow</page><page sequence="33">THE REV. DR. RICHARD MORRIS. 609 worker, Prof. Skeat. And in 1869 he edited Spenser for Macmillan's Globe edition, to which Prof. J. W. Hales contributed a memoir. This connection with Messrs. Macmillan led Dr. Morris into a new department of literature, where he was destined to show that a philologist can make money?if he pleases. He began, indeed, his series of educational works with one that is by no means elementary, though it has been hardly less successful on that account. This was his "Historical Outlines of English Accidence" (1872), which was the first attempt in England to explain the development of the language on historical and scientific principles. It has been reprinted some twenty times, and is now (we understand) being thoroughly revised for a new edition by Dr. L. Kellner and Mr. Henry Bradley. Two years later (1874) he brought out " Elementary Lessons in Historical English Grammar," and in the same year a Primer of "English Grammar," from both of which?it is pleasant to know?tens of thousands of boys and girls have learnt their earliest knowledge of their own tongue, which they will never need to unlearn. Scarcely had Dr. Morris struck out this remunerative line, when he deliberately turned aside to devote the remainder of his life to what is probably the least appreciated of all the branches of philology?the study of Pali, the sacred language of Buddhism. In this case, the stimulus came from his intimacy with Prof. Rhys Davids, the founder of the Pali Text Society. For that Society, Dr. Morris has edited portions of some four texts?more, indeed, than any other single contributor. But he did not confine himself to editing. His familiarity with Early English caused him to take a special interest in the language, as standing midway between the ancient Sanskrit and the modern vernaculars, and as branching out into various dialects, known as Prakrits. These relations of Pali he expounded in a series of letters in the Academy, which were invaluable not only for their lexicographical facts, but also as illustrating the historical growth of the j.r.a.s. 1894. 40</page><page sequence="34">610 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. languages of India. The very last work he was able to complete was a paper on this subject, read before the Inter national Congress of Orientalists in London in September, 1892. Of Dr. Morris's private character, we can hardly trust ourselves to speak. Though eminently qualified to shine in social intercourse, he seemed rather to shun publicity. But to his intimate friends he unlocked his heart. To a sober countenance, not unlike that of his own Chaucer, he added a kindly eye and a hearty laugh. In the company of those he liked, he was the merriest of good fellows. To the last week of his life, when not racked by pain, he kept up his interest in the welfare of his studies and of his friends. All who knew him loved him; for he could never bring himself to speak an unkind word. 4. Professor William Dwight Whitney.-?Sanskritists will have read with deep regret on June 8th of the death of a scholar who was in the front rank of Indianists and the head of the flourishing school of Vedic studies in the United States. Prof, Whitney was born in February, 1827, at Northamp ton in Massachusetts. Having graduated in 1845 at Williams College in that State, he obtained a clerkship at a banking house in his native place. This appointment he held for three years, devoting all his leisure to the study of lan guages, especially Sanskrit. He then entered Yale, where he studied from 1849 to 1850 under Prof. Edward E. Salisbury, who held the chair of Arabic and Sanskrit at that University from 1841 to 1854. In order to prosecute his Sanskrit studies Whitney came over to Europe in 1850, attending for three years the lectures of Prof. Franz Bopp and of Albrecht Weber (then a Privatdocent) at Berlin, and afterwards those of Prof. R. Roth at Tubingen. In col laboration with the latter eminent scholar, he subsequently published the Atharva-Veda Sawhita, being the only Anglo Saxon who has had a hand in editing any one of the four Vedas. Having copied the text from the MSS. of the Royal</page><page sequence="35">PROFESSOR WILLIAM DWIGHT WHITNEY. 611 Library at Berlin, he proceeded to collate other MSS. at Paris, in the library of the East India House, and in the Bodleian at Oxford. Returning to America, he became Professor of Sanskrit at Yale in 1854 on the resignation of Prof. Salisbury. In 1870 he was also elected Professor of Comparative Philology, retaining the combined chair till his death. From 1855 to 1873 he was librarian, from 1857 to 1884 corresponding secretary, and since then president of the American Oriental Society. His contributions to the journal of that Society were very large in the earlier years of his professorial career. About half the contents of vols. vi. to xii. were from his pen, including his translation of a Hindu astronomical work, the Surya-siddhanta (1860). In 1862 he published the text with translation and notes of a work on Vedic phonetics, the Atharva-Veda Praticakhya. This was followed in 1871 by a similar edition of a corre sponding treatise attached to the Yajurveda, viz. the Taitti riya Praticnkhya, together with its native commentary. The latter work, as the most important Sanskrit publication of the three preceding years, gained him the Bopp prize from the Berlin Academy. In 1864 Prof. Whitney delivered before the Smithsonian Institute a course of lectures, repeated in an extended form before the Lowell Institute at Boston, and subsequently published under the title of "Language and the Study of Language" (1867). This work has run through four editions. In 1873 he published " Oriental and Linguistic Studies," dealing with the Veda and the Avesta, followed in 1875 by a second series treating of religion, mythology, orthography, and Hindu astronomy. In the latter year also appeared his "Life and Growth of Language" in the Inter national Scientific Series. All this time (1852-75) he had been making to the great Sanskrit Dictionary of Bohtlingk and Roth valuable contributions relating to the Atharva-Veda, the Surya siddhanta, and other works. During the seventies Whitney gave a good deal of his attention to the publication of linguistic works of au</page><page sequence="36">612 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. educational character* Thus, in 1873, appeared his " Com pendious German Grammar," and in the same year a " German Reader in Prose and Verse," in 1877 " Essentials of English Grammar for the use of schools," and in 1878 a "Compendious German-English Dictionary." This is probably the most accurate German^Engiish dictionary in existence. Good books of this kind would not be so rare if men of first-rate ability, knowledge, and scientific training would oftener undertake the drudgery of compiling them. Meanwhile Prof. Whitney had been elaborating a book on which his great reputation as a Sanskritist is largely based, and which is universally acknowledged.as the standard work on the subject. His Sanskrit Grammar, published in 1879, may be said to have produced quite a revolu tion in the study of that language. Hitherto European Sanskritists had been almost entirely dominated by the native system of the Hindus, and had in their grammars dealt exclusively with the later and so-called classical period of the language, which is, linguistically, only of secondary importance. Prof. Whitney, on the one hand, emancipated Sanskrit grammar from subjection to the native method by treating linguistic phenomena solely on the evidence of actual literature, and not relying on the bare statements and artificial lucubrations of the Hindu grammarians. On the other hand, by introducing the Vedic element and treating grammatical facts largely from a statistical point of ^view, he, for the first time, placed the study of Sanskrit grammar on a historical basis. The advance since made in the historical knowledge of the ancient Aryan dialects of India has been mainly due to the stimulus: imparted by this work to the studies of Whitney's pupils and of other scholars. A second revised and extended edition appeared in 1888. The first edition had been translated into German by Prof. H. Zimmer. In 1885 Prof. Whitney published a valuable supplement entitled the " Roots, Verb-forms, and Primary Derivatives of the Sanskrit Language." He had meanwhile brought out his Index verborum to the Atharva-Veda in 1881.</page><page sequence="37">PROFESSOR WILLIAM DWIGHT WHITNEY. 613 He varied his Sanskrit studies by publishing a French Grammar in 1886, and acting as editor-in-chief of the " Century Dictionary of the English Language," the six volumes of which oame out in the remarkably short period of two years (1889 to 1891). During the last three years of his life he devoted his literary activity to the writing of pamphlets or of reviews in the American Journal of Philology and elsewhere. He was a frequent contributor to the American Review, the New Englander, and other periodicals, to cyclopaedias, and the transactions of learned societies. Among his articles may be noted " Contributions from the Atharva-Veda to the theory of the Sanskrit verbal accent" (1856), "On the views of Biot, Weber, and Max Muller on the Hindu and Chinese systems of Astronomy" (1864), "Material and Form in Language" (1872), "Darwinism and Language" (1874), " Logical consistency in views of Language" (1880), "Mixture in Language" (1881), "The Study of Hindu Grammar and the Study of Sanskrit" (1884). Prof. Whitney received honorary degrees from Breslau (1861), Williams College (1868), St. Andrews (1874), Harvard (1876), and Columbia (1886). He became the first President of the American Philological Association in 1869, and was correspondent of the Academies of Berlin, Turin, Rome, St. Petersburg, and of the Institute of France (elected in 1877), as well as Foreign Knight of the Prussian order Pour le mMte. A distinguishing feature of Whitney's linguistic works is the accuracy of his generalizations from grammatical facts. In regard to the science of language, he held the view that speech arose from the acceptance of conventional signs, and that its beginnings were imitative, combating the opinion that language was spontaneously generated as being co-existent with thought. Prof. Whitney was a clear-headed man endowed with a faculty for sound and forcible criticism. Researches dealing with the development of Indian thought, mythology, science, or chronology are peculiarly liable to</page><page sequence="38">614 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. suffer from the growth of wild or vague theories, owing to the absence of historical checks. Against such theories, as well as against loose scholarship, Prof. Whitney wielded an unsparing and trenchant pen. Those who were person ally acquainted with him say that he was a man of amiable disposition. Judging, however, by his writings one would be inclined to suppose that his temperament was not altogether lacking in the perfervid element. He accordingly sometimes adopted, perhaps without being aware of it, a severer style of criticism than may have been necessary in the interests of truth. But it cannot be denied that even his most forcibly expressed reviews were calculated to advance the cause of scholarship. The native system of Sanskrit grammar was one of the subjects on which he delighted to pour out his scorn. His somewhat extreme views on this question will no doubt be duly counteracted by such articles as Prof. Biihler's recent papers on "The Roots of the Dhatupa^a not found in Literature" in the Vienna Oriental Journal. Among searching reviews or criticisms from his pen during the last two years may be mentioned that on "Delbriick's Vedic Syntax" (1892), "Max Muller and the Science of Language " (1892), on " Recent Studies in Hindu Grammar" (1893), "The Native commentary to the Atharva-Veda" in Festgruss an Rudolf von Roth (1893), " The Veda in Pacini " in The Journal of the Italian Asiatic Society (1893), and articles in the Proceedings of the American Oriental Society for March, 1894, on Jacobi and Tilak's attempt to determine on astronomical evidence the date of the earliest Vedic period as 4000 B.C., on the third volume of Eggeling's translation of the Qatapatha Brahmana, and on Hillebrandt's identification of Soma with the Moon in the Rigveda. It is sad that a scholar from whose mature judgment and great store of learning further valuable criticism, such as Sanskrit studies can ill spare, might have been expected for years to come, should have been cut off in the midst of his activity (madhya karto^). It is to be hoped that the more important of his lesser writings may be published</page><page sequence="39">NOTES AND NEWS. 615 in a collected form, as those of the late Theodor Benfey have been by Prof. Bezzenberger.

Mr. Romesh Chunder Dutt, M.R.A.S., author of the " History of Civilization in Ancient India," has just been appointed Commissioner of a Division in Bengal, being the first native of India to reach that rank in the Revenue branch of the Civil Service. Dr. M. Ganter, Member of Council of the R.A.S., has been appointed for the second time to give a course of lectures on the Ilchester Foundation at Oxford. The lectures, four in number, were delivered during May. The subject chosen is "The Sources of Popular Imagery in Russia, Religious and Secular." Mr. S. Arthur Strong, M.R.A.S., will publish immediately the first part of an edition of an Arabic MS. in the British Museum containing an account of the Muslim conquest of Abyssinia in the sixteenth century.

The new edition is beautifully printed by Constables, and published by David Nutt in the Strand. Al-Masudi.?Prof, de Goeje, in Leyden, has edited the Kitdb At-Tanblh Wa'Lwhraf, of Mas'udi, to form the eighth volume of his " Bibliotheca Geographorum Arabicorum." Buddhagho&amp;a's Manoratha Purani.?Ratmalane Unnanse (the same scholar who restored the JanakI Harana from the old Sanna) is now bringing out an edition of this important work, the standard Commentary on the Anguttara. The first part, containing five sheets, has already appeared. It contains the introduction and the commentary on the early Suttas as edited by Dr. Morris for the Pali Text Society. The Jataka Book.?There is being brought out in Colombo an edition, in Sinhalese characters, of the Pali Text of the Jataka Commentary, which will be very useful for com parison with FausbolTs edition. The price is a rupee per pai&gt;t pf eighty pages. We gather this from the Ceylon Government return of books printed in the Island. The boqk is there entered under the heading "A Buddhist Reading Book." Koptic.?Mr. Claudius John Jjibtb, a Professor in the Koptic Clerical College at Cairo, has just published the first part of a Kpptic Grammar, written in Arabic?a sign that the Kopts have at length taken steps to help their children to learn their mother tongue. The Weddas of Ceylon.?There has appeared at Kandy, in Ceylon, a small book entitled " Vcedi-bhasbawa," con taining a vocabulary of words used by the Weddas and explained in Sinhalese. The author's name is A. T. W. Marambe. It would be desirable that a translation of this little work should appear in the Journal pf our Ceylon Branch. There is no copy in our Library here. The Weber MSS.?Several interesting ppints in the domain of Indian archaeology are suggested by Dr. A. fYR* Hoernle's preliminary study of the Weber MSS., in the Bengal</page><page sequence="41">NOTES AND NEWS. 617 Asiatic Society's Journal. The MSS. in question are a bundle of fragments, brought to light by the Rev. F, Weber, a missionary in Ladak, and found at Kugiar in Chinese Turkestan. The first point of interest is the material, viz. paper. Till quite recently the earliest known paper MS. connected with Indian civilization was a thirteenth century MS. in the Wright collection from Nepal, now at Cambridge. It is curious to note that the paper of the present find is stated to be Nepalese. The palgeo graphical features of the documents are traced in detail by Dr. Hoernle, and classified in relation to the "Central Asian Nagari" already established from the Kashgar MSS. at St. Petersburg, and the Bower MSS. recently published by the present editor in a sumptuous form under the auspices of the Government of India. Some of the fragments also belong to the "North-Western Gupta" form, elsewhere investigated by Dr. Hoernle. As to the subject-matter, it may suffice at present to note that of the eleven sets of fragments two at least are of literary importance. For one belongs to the astronomical literature of the later Vedic period, and is shown to have been composed between the second century b.c and the third century a.d. ; and a second is of lexicographical value. Burmese.?Mr. Robert C. Stevenson, M.R.A.S., Assistant Commissioner in the Burmese Civil Service, has brought out a new edition of Judson's Dictionary, which was much needed. Sdnkhya Philosophy.?Professor Garbe, of Heidelberg, in bis newly published "Sankhya Philosophy," endeavours to do for that school of thought what Prof. Deussen has so excellently done for the Vedanta, Both these works ought to be translated into English?giving as they do, in the manageable compass of a single octavo volume, a summary by the most competent hands of two out of the three principal schools of thought in India. Buddhist Philosophy.?A gentleman interested in the subject" (but who does not desire his name to be known) has most generously started a scheme, and provided the necessary</page><page sequence="42">618 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. funds, for the publication of complete editions and transla tions of the seven books of the Abhidhamma Pitaka so far as they have not been already published by the Pali Text Society. Arrangements are in progress by which the scheme will go regularly on, without stopping, until the whole work will be accomplished. Professor Robertson Smith.?According to the Athenceum, the will of Professor Robertson Smith has just been proved. By it he leaves his Arabic and Syriac manuscript books, together with twenty early-printed or scarce books to be selected by the Librarian, to the University Library, Cambridge. With this exception, the whole of his working library, which is very valuable, is left to Christ's College. A preliminary meeting has been held, at which it was agreed that there should be a memorial at Cambridge of the late Professor; and it was suggested that this might be done by raising a fund for the maintenance and extension of his library at Christ's College for the benefit of all Oriental students?an object which he was known to have much at heart?and for the purchase of further manuscripts for the University Library. It being now too late to take further steps this term, a meeting will be held at Cambridge early in October. Columbia College, New York.?A volume entitled " Classical Studies in honour of Henry Drissler " has just been issued by the Columbia University Press, consisting of twenty-one historical papers. Of these three are Oriental, namely, (1) "References to Zoroaster in Syriac and Arabic Litera ture," by R. J. H. Gottheil; (2) " Against Henotheism in the Rig Veda," by E. W. Hopkins; and (3) "Ancient Persian Armour," by A. Y. Williams Jackson. The Maha Bodhi Temple.?A regrettable religious dispute has occurred at the Maha Bodhi Temple, Gaya. A high priest of Japan, now on a visit to Buddhist shrines in India, had with him a valuable historical statue of Buddha, of great antiquity, an offering of the Buddhists of Japan to India for the Maha Bodhi Temple. The Collector of Gaya obtained permission of the Mahant in charge of the</page><page sequence="43">NOTICES OF BOOKS. 619 temple, and the statue was to be offered with great cere monial. At the last moment the Mahant changed his mind, and collected a thousand budmashes to oppose the placing of the statue in the temple. The conduct of the Mahant is inexplicable, as images of Buddha sent by Burmese Buddhists had, on several occasions, been similarly received without objection. The Maha Bodhi Society, being peace able people, withdrew, but a wanton insult has thus been offered to Japan and to all Buddhists. The Hindoos of Bengal are highly indignant at the conduct of the Mahant, who is in fact a usurper at the temple. A high priest of Japan had lately been received with great honour by the Hindoos of Calcutta at a large meeting presided over by Maharaja Sir Jotendro Mohan Tagore. The Jindlankdra.?A complete edition, with English translation and notes, of this poem (which has not been published hitherto, though Burnouf made so much use of his MS. copy of it), will be shortly published by Professor James Gray, of the Rangoon College, the editor of the Buddhaghosuppatti and other works. IV. Notices of Books. LEGENDES ET CoNTES MERVEILLEUX DE LA GRANDE KaBYLIE, recueillis par A. Moulieras. Texte kabyle, ler fascicule. 8vo. pp. 107. Paris: E. Leroux, 1894. This is the first part of a work which will include a voluminous collection of Kabayl legends and tales, with French translation and vocabulary, and which will not be completed till some years have elapsed. It will form a splendid monument of this popular Berber literature, which, no doubt, Masinissa, Jugurtha, and many others have enjoyed long ago, though in a purer form and without any interference with Arabic legends and words. More will have to be said about this publication. T. G. de G.</page><page sequence="44">620 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. Manuel de la langue Tigrai, parl^e au centre et dans le nord de l'Abyssinie, par J. Schreiber. I. (Grammaire), pp. vii. and 93. II. (Chrestomathie et Vocabulaire), 8vo. pp. iv. and 134. Vienna: Holder, 1887-1893. This most interesting work has been completed lately by its author, a Roman Catholic Missionary, and, in its present form, we have a complete Handbook of the Tigray language, sometimes improperly called Tigrifia, which is an Amharic adjective. The Tigray language belongs to the Ethiopic family; but it appears to be a somewhat mixed offspring of the ancient Geez, of which the Tigre language is a nearer relative. As there is no Tigray literature, the Chrestomathy consists of some biblical stories, dialogues, letters, fables, and proverbs, the whole collection proving very useful, though the exclusive use of the Ethiopic characters, without any transliteration, will doubt less prevent many persons, who are not familiar with this complicated alphabet, from becoming acquainted with the language. T. G. de G. Notes pour l'histoirb d'Ethiopie, par J. Perruchon. Paris, 1893-1894. Under this title, the author publishes in the Revue simitique a series of historical documents in the Ethiopic or Arabic text, with translation and copious explanations : for those who are or may become interested with the history of Ethiopia, these documents will prove of the greatest value, as they illustrate the reign of several Ethiopian sovereigns as well as their intercourse with the Sultans of Egypt. And I will show by an instance of what importance it is that these documents are published in the original text, without any alteration : an Arabic writer speaks of a queen who reigned over a tribe which he calls Beni-el Amuta or Amuya. Now, some scholars have been dissatisfied with this name, simply because they were not acquainted</page><page sequence="45">NOTICES OF BOOKS. 621 with it; one of them has corrected it into Yahudya (Jews), and another into Haghuya (Agaws): what right have they to do so? That we do not know the Beni~ehAmuta or Amuya does not prove anything. There are yet many things we do not know; but is that a sufficient ground for forging names ? It is in that fashion that history is too often falsified, and we are indebted to the author for the publi cation of these unsophisticated texts. T. G. de G. Les Apocryphes ethiopiens, traduits en francais par Rene Basset. I. (Le livre de Baruch et la legende de Jeremie). II. (Mas'h'afa T'omar, ou le livre de l'epitre). III.

The indefatigable Prof. Rene Basset has undertaken to publish the Ethiopian apocrypha, which are interesting from more than one point of view. We may rely upon him for an accurate translation. T. G. de G. Die Bedawye Sprache in Nordost-Africa, von Leo Reinisch. II. and III. (Grammatik). Svo. pp. 204. Wien : F. Tempsky, 1893-94. Prof. Leo Reinisch has now completed his Grammar of the Bedawye language, sometimes called Bishari or even Hadendoa, and a dialect of which has been illustrated by Almqvist, without any texts, though with more scientific display than was perhaps necessary. Prof. L. Reinisch takes care to explain that it is the old Nubian language, and not at all the Bishari language, which is represented in the so-called Meroitic inscriptions; as the Bishari is an unwritten language, the author has very wisely refrained from using the Arabic or Ethiopic characters, the Arabic characters being used only by the Mahomedan Bisharis in order to write Arabic, but never their own language. The transliteration in Roman letters is both scientific and</page><page sequence="46">622 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. practical ; we find, curiously enough, that the Bisharis, like the Ethiopians, have, in common with the Kushitic languages, the sound of the rounded letters &lt;fe and 7* (qwa and gwa). The phonetic part of Prof. L. Reinisch's Grammar is very extensive; but, instead of falling into needless and tedious minutiae, like his predecessor Almqvist, the author has contrived to make the matter very attractive by largely comparing the Bishari forms with those of the surrounding languages. I cannot here enter into the par ticulars of this rather remarkable language, which possesses a definite article, two genders, and an extensive system of inflexion for both nouns and verbs; these parts have been masterly dealt with by the author, and his work will be a safe guide for all those who will attempt to become acquainted with the language. I entertain no doubt that the Vocabularies will prove as highly interesting as the Grammar. T. G. de G. Dr. S. Gelbhaus, Das Targum II. zum Buche Esther. Francfort-on-the-Main: Kauffmann. Dr. Gelbhaus opens a series of researches on the literature of the Targums with this treatise. According to his view the Targum II. is composed of fragments of a more compre hensive work which was called Targum Rabbdh, the original form of which has, however, been lost. Dr. Gelbhaus does not adduce any strong proofs in support of his theory, nor are they sufficient to make us alter the date Zunz has fixed for the writing of the T. IL, towards the end of the seventh century?with the exception of the Book of Proverbs?for the fourth as suggested by Dr. Gelbhaus. Of great interest is the list of parallels between this Targum and the Psittd, which reveals the close lingual and probably also literary connection between both. In another list he shows the differences between the T. II. and the ordinary Targum to the book. He could have added that the Aramaic translation of biblical quotations in the T. II.</page><page sequence="47">NOTICES OF BOOKS. 623 also differs from the T. I. It is questionable whether the legend of the Queen of Sheba, reproduced in the Qoran, is borrowed from the T. II. In the Moslim tradition this legend developed in a special course of its own (see Weil, Bibl. Legenden der Muselmdnner, pp. 247 sqq.). To judge from this first instalment we may expect important results from Dr. Gelbhaus's further researches on the questions of the composition and language of the Targums. H. H. The JanakT Harana. By Kumara Dasa. Edited by the late Pandit Haridasa Sastri, Director of Public Education, Jaipur. (Calcutta: 24, Girisa Vidyaratna Lane, 1893 ; price R. 5.) We have already called attention to the edition of this poem as restored into Sanskrit verse from the recently discovered Sinhalese commentary by K. Dharmarama, and published in Ceylon in 1891. The present work is an independent restoration of the poem made from a copy of the commentary sent from Ceylon to the very able young native scholar Haridasa Sastri. It is now pub lished, after the much regretted premature death of the young author, by Kalipada Bandyopadhyaya, Principal of the Sanskrit College at Jaipur. As the commentary (which is printed in full in the Ceylon edition) contains (with a few unimportant exceptions) each word of the poem, but in no particular order, the puzzle which had to be solved was to rearrange those words in metrical order. The Indian editor differs pretty frequently in this rearrangement from the Ceylon editor, and points out in short Sanskrit notes the passages where he thinks the commentary itself must contain a wrong reading. As the date of the Ceylon king who wrote the poem is, within a few years, quite certain (he reigned 517-526 a.d.) it will have an historical importance quite apart from its literary value, and scholars will be very glad to have an edition in the Nagari character, and one prepared by so</page><page sequence="48">624 NOTES OF TSE QUARTER. good a native scholar as the present editor. Their best thanks are therefore due to the learned Principal of the Jaipur Sanskrit College for rescuing from destruction the very interesting work of Pandit Haridasa Sastrl. Judson's Burmese-English Dictionary. Revised and enlarged by R. C. Stevenson, Burma Commission. Rangoon, printed by the Superintendent, Government Printing, Burma. It is difficult to write anything but praise of this very excellent compilation, which at once places students of Burmese in a position equal to, if not better than, that enjoyed by their fellow-workers in any of the other vernaculars of the Indian Empire. The author has, it is true, modestly described his work as merely an enlarge ment and revision of that of Dr. Judson, but so numerous and important are the alterations, (the size has been practically doubled), that it would be as just to style a modern English dictionary a revision of Dr. Johnson's. In the making of such books of reference it is, of course, undoubtedly the case that " c'est le premier pas qui coute," and that where the first work is a really good one of its kind, as is the case with Dr. Judson's, all subsequent ones must, to a great extent, incorporate the material, ipse verba, of the original pioneer. At the same time the line must be drawn somewhere, and, where the alterations have been so great and manifest as here, it seems a misnomer to call a subsequent work by the name of the first dictionary maker; indeed it would not be rash prophecy to declare that the present book will, in spite of its title, become known as "Stevenson's," and not as "Dr. Judson's Dictionary." The great delay in its publication, concerning which various reports have been current in Burma, was, it now appears, mainly due to the default of the American Baptist Mission Press, in Rangoon, in providing the necessary type for the printing, the work having eventually</page><page sequence="49">notices of BOOKS. 625 to be printed at the Government Press. As is usual in publications from that department, the type, paper, etc., leave nothing to be desired; but why was a dictionary issued with a paper cover? It is surely of all works the one most entitled to a substantial binding, always supposing that the trammels of red-tapeism allow such. The author claims with justice the following "special features " for his work :? " (1) It has a considerable number of new words not contained in former ones. " (2) Most of the words have examples showing their use. (He might also have added the fulness and exactitude of the definitions of the different words.) " (3) Both the written and colloquial styles are ex emplified. " (4) It contains many excerpta from the best authorities regarding Buddhist religious and metaphysical terms. " (5) The exact pronunciation of many words is given. " (6) It contains many proverbs, aphorisms, old and quaint sayings, which have not been published; " . . . The latter are found partly in a short collection at the end, but principally scattered as examples throughout the book. The care and intelligence displayed in their selection and translation are highly creditable to the author, who, it is understood, has been at considerable pains in the matter. Little has been done to settle the derivation of any of the words. Perhaps, however, it was as well in the present state of Burmese philology to leave alone this portion of the subject, which, to use a common expression, "teems with pitfalls for the unwary," teste the note given in the preface on Dr. Forchhammer's derivation of " Bassein." There was, however, no necessity to have followed Dr. Judson in wrongly deriving certain words from. Pali instead of from Sanskrit. As regards the spelling, Mr. Stevenson has followed that generally obtaining in Burma, inserting in brackets only the new spelling directed by the late Committee in Rangoon. In many cases the latter j.r.a.s. 1894. 41</page><page sequence="50">626 NOTES of the quarter. spelling is doubtless the better; in others the alteration is more questionable, and under the circumstances, (see ante p. 412, J.R.A.S.), Mr. Stevenson would seem to have acted wisely in the course he has taken in this not un important matter. The explanations given under the different terms relating to the Buddhist religion and philosophy certainly do not err on the side of brevity, copious extracts being given from the different authorities on the subject. It might perhaps have been better to have given more quota tions from Burmese books on the subject, since what the reader of a work like this would want to ascertain is the precise Burmese views in the matter, however erroneous these may be in certain details. The teachings of the Ceylon school of Buddhism agree, of course, in the main with that prevailing ,in Burma; and, therefore, quotations from authors who have principally studied that school are likely to be applicable enough to the faith of the more northern country. At the same time one cannot but think the definitions and explanations might with advantage have all been taken from Burmese works of authority on Buddhism. As regards the dictionary generally the more it is studied the more comprehensive will appear the matter incorporated in it, the author appearing equally at home with the terse and idiomatic vernacular as with the more refined and sometimes obscure language of the poets. In addition to the numerous proverbs, the number of idio matic and quasi-proverbial sayings given is very large, and it will be found that these are no mean help to the ascertainment of the exact signification of the word under which they are found. Further, those expressions or words which obtain chiefly in only one of the Provinces, Upper or Lower Burma, have this fact duly noted. In short it may be said that the future student of Burmese will have no excuse for ignorance so far as this can be dispelled by a work of reference. As since the annexation of Upper Burma the number of learners of the language has increased yearly</page><page sequence="51">NOTICES OF BOOKS. 627 by leaps and bounds, it is to be hoped that Mr. Stevenson may reap an adequate reward for the extraordinary learning and pains he has expended on this dictionary, which must for very long, if not always, remain the standard work on the subject. B. H. Der altindische Gott Varuna nach den Liedern des Rgveda. Von Karl Bohnenberger. Pp. 127. Tubingen, 1893. This treatise claims to be a special investigation in the field of the history of religion. The introduction (pp. 1-21) deals generally with the religious conceptions and the exegesis of the Rigveda. About two-thirds of the main body of the work consist of a statement of the various aspects in which the god Varuna is presented by that Veda. These aspects have already been fully and well treated by Hillebrandt in his monograph on Varuna and Mitra, and less exhaustively also by Muir in the fifth volume of his Sanskrit Texts, and by Bergaigne in the third volume of La Religion Vedique. The writer would have been better justified in going over ground already traversed, had he subjected previous views to a searching criticism and made the results thus obtained the basis of further investigations. This he has failed to do, merely stating vaguely in the introduction (p. 19) that he has in many cases been led to conclusions differing from those of Hillebrandt, and has attached either greater or less weight to various points than that scholar does. If he had followed the course indicated, it would have been easier to see whether he has added anything of importance to our knowledge of the subject. The second part of the book (pp. 91-127) is concerned, under the same heads as those of the first part, with speculations as to the motives producing those character istics of Varuna which we find developed in the Rigveda* Here, too, it is not easy to point out any new results of importance. The writer's lengthy contention (pp. 122-25)</page><page sequence="52">628 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. that the conception of Varuna had a purely naturalistic, and not an animistic or a fetishistic, origin seems superfluous. The bare statement of the negative proposition that there is no trace of animism or fetishism in the history of this god, would have sufficed. The phonetic equations, i?ev9=Dyaus (Indo-European dieus) and oupavo?=Varunas (i.e. vorvnnos, see Brugmann, Grundriss ii. 154) have long been established. How the inverted use of these two names among the Greeks and Indians is to be accounted for, is no doubt correctly stated by Bohnenberger. Both words designated the vault of heaven in the Indo-European period, dieus as the " shiner " (\/diu), vorvnnos as the " encompasser" (t/ver). When it became necessary to distinguish between the personifi cation and its natural basis, the Greeks and the Indians went different ways. The former came to restrict the meaning of ovpavos to "sky," and Zeis to "god of the sky," while with the Indians dyaus remained the sky, and Varuna became the god? It may be added that though the Rigveda retains the incipient personification which dates from the Indo-European period, Dyaus being frequently spoken of as a father (Dyaus pitar=2e0 irdrep, Jupiter), this personification was not further developed (as in the case of ovpavos), for the word never designates a god at all in post-Vedic times. Such being the relation of Varuna to Dyaus, the former may be called the oldest of the Vedic gods. In the development of the conception of Varuna, Bohnen berger distinguishes four obvious stages. From the primitive meaning of "encompassing sky," the first step is an incipient zoomorphic or anthropomorphic personification. The personification next grows complete, and, becoming separated from its natural substrate, assumes the character of an independent deity. These two stages lie far behind the earliest Rigvedic period. Varuna then attains to the. position of the supreme god and moral ruler, of the Universe, which is quite a natural development of the notion of the all-embracing sky. It is at the end of this stage in his</page><page sequence="53">NOTICES OF BOOKS. 629 evolution that we find him in the oldest period of the Rigveda. There is here no longer any living tradition of his connection with the vault of heaven, though some remnants of such connection may be traced in his personality. The last stage of Varuna in the Rigveda is that of his decadence. With regard to this stage, Bohnenberger remarks that it is impossible to say how quickly the old Varuna worship decayed, but it seems certain that the practical religious importance of this god at the end of the Rigvedic period had become very small. We may add that the final position attained by Varuna in post-Vedic mythology was that of the Indian Neptune. From being, among his other functions, ruler of the celestial waters, he became the regent of the terrestrial ocean. In order to arrive at anything like definite conclusions in dealing with mythological evolution, it is obviously of primary importance to distinguish the relative age of different parts of the Rigveda. As, however, only results of the most general kind have hitherto been attained, Bohnenberger has had little help to count on in this direction. He, no doubt rightly, considers even the older Rigvedic period to be exclusively Indian, though he regards it as much further removed from later conceptions than Pischel would admit. Bohnenberger can hardly be said to be very successful in establishing his opinion concerning a point on which he expressly states his disagreement with the ordinarily re ceived view. This point is the relation of Mitra to Varuna. Varuna originally represented the sky, while Mitra was probably the diurnal luminary whose light pervades the sky, the two, owing to their close connection, coming to be treated as almost identical. Bohnenberger, however, thinks that the practical identity in character of Mitra and Varuna points to the division of a single god into two, the attribute "friend" (mitra) having developed into an independent deity. He has consequently to assume not only that the Avestan Mithra ( = Mitra) cannot be identified with the sun, but that the name of the original deity</page><page sequence="54">636 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. Varena (=Varuna), by which Mithra must have been accompanied, came to be invariably dropped as superfluous. He also thinks that all attempts to connect the attribute of friendliness in the Vedic Mitra with the sun as a natural basis have failed. But, at any rate, no god evolved from a phenomenon of nature could more obviously be regarded as the friend of man than the sun. The beneficence of the other solar deities of the Rigveda (Surya, Savitr, Pusan, Visnu) is often emphasized, and the sun is said to be the soul of living beings, to preserve the world, and to bestow blessings from heaven and earth. Again, the god of Fire, Agni, of whom the sun is regarded as a form, is more than once in the Rigveda called " the friend " (mitra). The book cannot be said to have been carefully revised for press. There are many misprints in transliterated words, sometimes two or three on the same page (e.g. p. 67). This is especially the case in regard to the quantity of vowels. There are also other errors, such as garadham for qaradam (p. 42), and drsh for dhrsh (p. 39). On the whole, it seems a pity that the author did not rather devote himself to an investigation affording more new ground for research than that which he has here treated. A. A. Macdonell. Epochs of Indian History: The Muhammadans, 1001 1761 a.d. By J. D. Rees, CLE., I.C.S. With three maps. Longmans, 1894. According to Mr. Stanley Lane-Poole, an indisputably excellent authority on such matters, the personally-derived title of the small volume under notice, as applied to the creed of Islam or the professor thereof, would have been regarded by the Prophet himself as "nothing short of blasphemy."l Among English-speaking people, however, and throughout Western Europe, it has become sanctioned by use, and, like many other questionable conventional 1 " The Speeches and Table-Talk of the Prophet Mohammad " ; by Stanley Lane-Poole, p. 190. Macmillan, 1882.</page><page sequence="55">NOTICES OF BOOKS. 631 terms, will continue to be accepted under warrant of custom. In any case, the summary of Indian history put before us by Mr. Rees will not suffer from the applica* tion of a misnomer; nor will its value be impaired by the designation "Muhammadans" instead of "Muslims." The method and arrangement of this review of a period of six hundred and sixty years could scarcely have been exercised without a considerable amount of preliminary reading and study; and fortunate is it for the Civil Service of India that there are still to be found in it men of intellectual as well as physical energy, who have the sound sense to inaugurate their careers by laying a foundation on which, if life be spared* they may eventually raise structures of monumental usefulness. Mr. Rees, we have reason to know?^quite independently of fulfilling his professional requirements ? has been indefatigable as a traveller, a student of life and character, an observer, and a narrator. He had the happy thought of describing the official tours of his immediate Chief, the Governor of Madras, in a popular form which would make the record pleasant and instructive reading. Several separately published pamphlets might be produced in evidence of the skill with which the notion was carried into effect; and an account of Trichinopoly, written in October, 1890, may at once be recalled as a good specimen of this kind of journalizing.1 As regards his work now under notice he explains that he has "tried above all things to be brief and comparative"; also that he has " endeavoured to mention such names and events as cannot well be omitted, and, as all knowledge is comparative, to focus them by occasional references to contemporary occurrences outside India." Those for whom he has catered may, we think, be congratulated, as well as the author himself, on this outcome of his latest labours. It is not an easy matter to condense and expound Indian history so as to make the main facts and issues intelligible, and an attempt 1 " Twelfth Tour of H.E. the Governor " ; with map photo-zincographed at Central Survey Office, Madras.</page><page sequence="56">632 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. to bring it home to the apprehension of English readers, by reference to contemporary and better known annals, is by no means safe to succeed with the mass of students. In a prefatory note to his chapters on "the Mu hammadans," Mr. Rees tells us that "the spelling of proper names is according to the system authorized by the Government of India, except in the case of a few well-known words, as Punjab, Poona, where a change from the customary form would be pedantic." But we find in the first thirty pages such inconsistencies as Bussora (page 1) and Basra (page 2); Moslems and Muslims (page 3); Rashid (page 27) and Yameen (page 28); and surely our old friend of the " Arabian Nights" would be more correctly designated Khalif than Caliph. There is no need to go further; but it may be understood that orthographical revision is needed, if only for consistency's sake?Jet alone the "Indian Government system," which, if applied generally to the men, places, and things of Islam, would not be free from many and serious objections. The Megha Duta by Kalidasa with a Sinhalese Paraphrase. Edited by the Hon. T. B. PXnabokke, M.R.A.S., C.B. (Colombo, 1894, pp. xvi. and 86.) Mr. William Gunatilaka, of Kandy, discovered there, shortly before his death, at the Oriental Library, the unique MS. of this interesting work. It is an ancient Sanna, or word-for-word commentary on the famous work of Kalidasa, and is of some importance, firstly by reason of the curious readings it sometimes gives in difficult passages of the poem, and secondly by the evidence which it affords of the kind of knowledge of Sanskrit possessed by Ceylon pandits. On the first point a full selection is here given of the various readings?W standing for the reading of Wilson's well-known Calcutta edition of the poem (1813), and P for the readings given from the unique Ceylon MS. by the present editor. On the second point it is noteworthy, that the grammatical</page><page sequence="57">NOTICES OF BOOKS. 633 notes depend, not on Panini, but on some other grammar or grammars. The editor states, in a private note, that he hopes to treat fully of the conclusions that may be drawn from this fact after he has been able to ascertain with greater exactitude what are actually the sources from which these rules, not found in Panini, are actually quoted. It is of especial interest to find one of the most dis tinguished descendants of the ancient chieftains of the beautiful island so long renowned for its scholarship both able and willing to devote his time to so careful an edition of a difficult Sanskrit text, and of the no less difficult ancient Sinhalese commentary upon it. And we trust that his further consideration of the historical results to be drawn from the commentary will not be too long delayed. Rh. D. Various Readings. W. (Wilson). P.

Collected by Chas. J. Rodgers, and purchased by the Panjab Government. Calcutta, 1894. This is a catalogue of a collection made with great diligence and pains?and one must have tried it to know what a trial of temper and patience it is?in the bazaars of the Panjab during some 25 years, by Mr. Rodgers, to whom we owe so much information about the coins of the Siirl kings and the Mogul emperors of Dehli. Mr. Rodgers was the first to describe, in the Bengal Asiatic Journal in 1880, the copper coinage of Akbar; and this catalogue is the first in which the copper coinage of the Dehli emperors is described to any extent, for, as was re marked in our Journal last year, when noticing the British Museum Catalogue of this series, the national collection was very poor in that kind of coin, containing only forty</page><page sequence="60">636 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. specimens in all?thirty-nine of Akbar and one of Jahangir. This collection supplies this deficiency of knowledge about them, and corrects the impression given by Mr. S. Lane Poole that the Mogul copper coinage was a scanty one. The whole collection comprises 1816 coins (53 gold, 1046 silver, and 717 copper), of which 1559 are Mogul coins and 257 Surl, and includes many novelties in all metals. The coins of Babar and Humayun are numerous and interesting; of Akbar there is a large assortment and an especially remarkable copper series. The author has devoted much attention to the coinage of Jahangir, and gives a long list of couplets he has found on his coins; he describes, too, twenty-two copper coins of this emperor, on some of which are new designations of coins replacing those of his father Akbar. The copper coins of Shah Jahan Aurangzib, Muhammad Shah, 'Alamglr IL, Shah 'Aiam IL, and Akbar II. are also worthy of notice. The square dirham shWyi of Aurangzib and Farrukh Siyar, similar in weight to the old Khalif coins, are new. The list of mints contains several new names and some fresh readings, with some interesting honorific titles of mints, such as akhtarnagar Oudh, dar aUjahdd Haidarabad, bandar i mubdrak Surat, and Muhammabdd 'urf Udaipur maftuha. It is a pity that the large collection made by Mr. Rodgers during the time he was Archaeological Surveyor could not have been included in this list; he then collected for Government and not for himself; he appended lists to his reports, but they were not published, and the coins were distributed by the Government to various museums. It is to be regretted, too, that there are no plates illustrating some of the coins described in this catalogue; it is difficult for those not very familiar with the lettering and arrange ment of the parts of words, especially on the copper coins, to make out the legends without a specimen illustration, and in case of a doubtful or disputed reading it is of course all-important, as, for instance, in the reading, on the coin of a.h. 1135, Akhtarnagar Oudh, not Akbarnagar, as is given in the British Museum Catalogue.</page><page sequence="61">NOTICES OF BOOKS. 637 We are glad to hear that Mr. Rodgers has other cata logues of Indian coins in hand, viz. a second part of the one now under notice, one of the collection in the Indian Museum, Calcutta, and one of that of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. On the publication of these we shall have made much progress in our knowledge of the Indian series of coins, which now much needs to be brought together and concisely arranged. 0. C. Vedanta und Buddhismus, als Fermeute fur eine kiinftige Regeneration des religiosen Beuresstseins innerhalb des europaischen Kulturkreises. Von Th. Schultze. (Leipzig: W. Friedrich. No date. Pp. 78 and 143.) Interesting and worthy of attention as a specific attempt at the comparison of religious principles, and a contribution to progress in the same, this essay is of significance in so far as it purports to indicate the drift of modern religious thought. The author holds that the time has come for the culture of the Western world to shake off the decadent, discrepant heritage of Hebraic tradition, and to combine its genuine but independent sources?viz. the Helleno-Roman treasures of the genius of communication and self-expression, the modern methods of empirical science and the old Indo Aryan psychological insight, contemplative power, and ethical self-mastery?into a basis for truly catholic progress. Part I. of the work (pp. 1-78) is a criticism of Christianity in its principles and results, with a destructive purport. Part II. analyses the leading concepts of the religion of the Veda, the philosophy of the Vedanta, and the doctrines of Buddhism, together with "some aphoristic contributions" towards a reply to the inquiry, how far it were possible for these to take root in the soil of modern European thought, were Christianity banished. The author weighs the claims of Christianity to be called, and to continue to be, a base of European culture, aud finds them wanting. Religion will survive it. Religion, which the autonomy of practical</page><page sequence="62">638 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. morality cannot replace (since man is not only social, but has his inner life, his Fur-sich-leben increasing in depth and pervasiveness the higher his culture and ideals)? religion, as a series of dogmatic traditions, must die before religion, as a self-conscious, self-chosen " ethico-metaphysical view of life and the universe," yielding guidance of conduct, can develop. In the greater offspring of the pure nature-worship of the Veda, in the Vedantist doctrine of universal self, as well as in the serene mastery over, not mortification of, emotion and susceptibility to external influences, inculcated by Buddhism, the writer finds a depth of psychological insight and moral wisdom unequalled elsewhere. Berkeley and Fichte he instances as having made some approach to it. The latter's doctrine of future existence would amount to Karma, could he have shaken off the Western standpoint of beginning with the present life. Locke, again, in his doctrine of uneasiness (Essay II. xxi.) gives practically a Buddhist exposition of tanhd. Had the author succeeded in developing his brief con structive contribution with the force and lucidity of his critical expositions, the value of the work would have been indefinitely increased. As it is, it can hardly fail to prove eminently fruitful and suggestive in the way in which it brings Western speculation into comparison with Eastern thought. The author's acquaintance with the best sources of information, available in European languages, on the philosophy of India and on the ethics of Buddhism is wide and accurate. And he has also the insight which comes of sympathy, Moser, Henri. L'Irrigation en Asie Centrale, etude geographique et economique. With a map. Paris, 1894. M. Henri Moser, the author of "A travers l'Asie Centrale," began his travels in Central Asia as a young man, and has made a good use of his rare opportunities</page><page sequence="63">NOTICES OF BOOKS. 63$ for studying the resources of the Russian possessions in that part of the world. Associated in the vast projects and works of such eminent administrators as Kaufmann, Chernaief, and Anneukof, he brings the fruits of a long experience to bear on the interesting questions discussed in the present work. In Chapter I. he examines the conditions of climate and soil, the gradual dessication of the Aralo-Caspian basin, its geology, surface deposits (such as loess, sand-drift, etc.), the temperature, atmospheric deposits, and direction and force of wind. He gives a sketch of the orography and hydrography, the main arteries of irrigation, agricultural products, and useful plants. Finally he reviews briefly the population, sedentary and nomadic. In Chapter II. he treats of the history of irrigation and its great importance in moulding the destinies of the people of Asia, while he touches on the traces of irriga tion works in such centres as Merv, Khiva, Ferghanah, the Hi and Zarafshan valleys. Chapter III. is of more present interest, for here the author explains the actual methods of cultivation as now practised. These are divisible under two heads: (1) where the rainfall is sufficient to raise crops, and (2) where artificial irrigation is necessary. It is on this last that the inhabitant of Central Asia is mainly dependent for his subsistence. The all-important water supply governs the whole ad ministration of the country, and is at the root of the unwritten customary law handed down from generation to generation. It serves also as a basis of Imperial taxation. Having examined in detail the systems of irrigation pursued in the provinces of Zarafshan (Chapter IV) and Bokhara (Chapter V.), M. Moser summarizes, in conclusion, the future prospects of irrigation and the schemes devised for the development of the country. If it be admitted, he remarks, that under former conquerors instability and uncertainty for the morrow weighed heavily on public enterprise and prevented the development of resources, it is incumbent on Russia to create a new system of irrigation based on the conquests of modern science and</page><page sequence="64">640 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. the experience gained by the natives . . . The ancient and legendary prosperity of Central Asia will not only come to life again, but it may and ought to be surpassed. With the wish and conviction that it may and will do so, M. Moser concludes his book. K D, M. The Tarikh-i-Jadid, or New History of MIrza 'Alt Muhammad the Bab. By Mirza Huseyn of Hamadan. Translated from the Persian by Edward G. Browne, M.A., M.B. Edited for the Syndics of the University Press. Cambridge, 1893. Had Mr. Browne done no more, to make known the story of the Babis and the character of their literature, than publish the remarkable papers bearing upon this persecuted sect which appeared in the July and October numbers of the Royal Asiatic Society's Journal five years ago (1889), he would have deserved the warm acknowledgment of Orientalists and students of Oriental history. But he has rendered further service of similar kind and in the same cause, both by medium of the Society's Journal and by separate publication. In April, 1892, he enriched our pages with his valuable remarks on the texts edited by Baron Victor Rosen in the Collections Scientifiques of the St. Petersburg Oriental Institute, and to these, in the following July and October, he added his elaborate analysis of certain manuscripts which he had before omitted to notice, but the contents of which, he was of opinion, should, for many reasons, be " clearly and succinctly stated." Towards the end of 1891 he edited, for the Syndics of the Cambridge University Press, the " Traveller's Narrative," illustrating the Episode of the Bab, set forth in the original Persian text as well as an English translation of his own with explanatory notes. We now propose to say a few words on a publication of the Cambridge Press later in date than any of those to which reference has here been made. It is called the Tdrikh-i-Jadid or " New History."</page><page sequence="65">NOTICES OF BOOKS. 641 For the particulars of the feud which, in recent years, has divided the Babi camp, and weakened the outside prestige of the sect, owing to the partial supersession of its old leader, Subh-i-Ezel, by the more active and energetic Beha'u'llah, the reader is referred to the introduction of the present volume, together with its author's previous writings, which are full of information and instruction on the subject. The death of Beha'u'llah, pending the controversy, does not seem to have materially changed the character of the situation or contributed to restore authority to his opponent. As to the ascertained outcome of the conflict in these days, Mr. Browne writes :? " While the Beha'is have been ever waxing in power and influence, so that their numbers now probably reach, or even exceed, half a million souls, the Ezelis have been ever waning, until at the present time it is doubtful whether in all they amount to a few hundreds. It is even doubtful whether the recent death of Beha will contribute in any sensible measure to the restoration of their former fortunes, though Ezel still lives and numbers amongst his supporters, at least, one or two men of energy and ability." The appearance of the Tdrikh-i-Jadid among the more notable specimens of Babi literature, is thus accounted for in Professor Browne's Introduction. One Haji Mirza Jani, a merchant of Kashan, an early disciple of the Bab, Mirza Muhammad 'Ali, " was remarkable for his enthusiastic devotion to the new religion." After giving many proofs of sincere attachment to his master and that master's memory, in the course of a brief but busy career (during which he became acquainted with almost all the prominent Babis), " he suffered martyrdom for the faith at Teheran on September 15th, 1852." During the two years that inter vened between his Chief's death and his own, he composed a voluminous work under the strange title of "The Point of Kaf," on the "doctrines and history of the religion" which he professed. The manuscript of this composition is forthcoming, in its entirety, in the Bibliotheque Nationale at Paris, and is of high value as a contemporary record of the j.ra.s. 1894. 42</page><page sequence="66">642 notes of the quarter. early days of Babi-ism; but political questions will arise even amidst religious environment, and as Mirza Jani was the determined upholder of the Bab's immediate successor, Subh-i-Ezel, the claim to headship of the community, set up by the more influential Beha'u'llah, would have run the risk of harm, had this document been made public as it stood. It was "practically dangerous to the plans and pretensions" of the latter; and it became necessary, in the eyes of a powerful majority, that Mirza Jani's old history of the Bab and his apostles "should be superseded by a revised, expurgated, and amended 'New History' (Tarikh-i-Jadid), which, while carefully omitting every fact, doctrine, and expression calculated to injure the policy of Beha, or to give offence to his followers) should preserve, and even supplement with new material derived from fresh sources, the substance of the earlier chronicle." According to information obtained for Mr. Browne, in reply to questions categorically put by himself, Mirza Huseyn of Hamadan, whose name is openly connected with, and appears on the title-page of, the book under notice, was a young Persian in the suite of Nasiru'd-din Shah on the occasion of his Majesty's first visit to Europe. After his return to Teheran he fell upon evil days, for he was imprisoned in that city. When released he found employ ment in the office of one Manakji Limji, the Parsi Agent at the capital, a worldly, busy, and withal a plodding literary man, by whom he was eventually commissioned to write a history of the Babis. This was the particular work intended to supplant the more genuine but less politic memoir. In carrying it into execution the reputed author appears to have had ready access to Mirza Jani's manuscript history, but in selecting and putting together his facts and materials he must have been somewhat hampered by the supervision of his Zoroastrian master. Another and ap parently abler assistant in the composition was a certain Mirza Abu'l Fazl, of whose intelligence Mr. Browne expresses a high opinion. Independently of the question of time and space, an</page><page sequence="67">NOTICES OF BOOKS. 643 analysis of events recorded would hardly be an appropriate course to pursue in disposing of the narrative before us, which consists, in some instances, of fragments pieced together, in others of repetitions or variations of a fore going text. But a perusal of the whole volume may be recommended, and would assuredly repay the interested student of religions and schisms in the East. However faulty its literary method may appear, judged by a European standard, there are, scattered throughout its pages, vivid descriptions, touching reflections, eloquent appeals, and curious if not always credible episodes. The massacre of the garrison of Sheikh Tabarsi supplies material for a horrible tale of Persian treachery. But this is one only of many like illustrations, in which we would fain hope that, in spite of authenticated precedents, the picture is over-coloured. A short descriptive paragraph may be quoted in extenso. It refers to the close of the sad story, when the Babi chief, in acceptance of a deceitful invitation, passed over, with a few followers, to the quarters of the Shah's Commander :? "After the interchange of the usual compliments, the Prince requested Jendb-i-Kuddus to order his followers to lay down their arms, because these were a menace and a cause of fear to the troops. This request he urged so persistently that Jendb-i-Kuddus finally sent orders to his men to lay aside their weapons, which orders were cheerfully and willingly obeyed. Then the soldiers gathered up tho arms and weapons and bore them away. Before this was done the Prince had ordered breakfast to be brought for the Babis. But when these sat down unarmed to eat, the soldiers surrounded them and fired a volley upon them, and then rushed in amongst the survivors, giving for refreshment the draught of martyrdom. Then they seized Jendb-i-Kuddus and those who were with him. A strango hospitality and welcome did they show to these poor people! After they had for three months suffered such hunger that they would willingly eat grass, and even that failed them, they were bidden on the Word of God to a feast, yet ere they</page><page sequence="68">644 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. had tasted a single morsel their hunger was appeased with bullets! And so much of their blood was collected in a hollow of the ground, that the truth of a tradition which affirms that in that land shall be such bloodshed that a horse shall wade knee-deep in gore, was made manifest" (pp. 86-7). Some pages further on we read of the death, at Niriz, of a distinguished Babi, named Seyyid Yahya, of whose person the soldiers of Prince Firuz Mirza had become possessed by a process of treachery much resembling the last narrated. The executioner having refused to fulfil his task, it was necessary to find a substitute. What followed is thus described:? "One who had lost two brothers in the earlier part of the war, and therefore cherished a deep resentment, said, 'I will kill him.' And he loosed the shawl wherewith Seyyid Yahya was girt, cast it round his neck, and drew it tight. And others beat his holy body with sticks and stones, dragging it hither and thither over the plain, till his soul soared falcon-like to the branches of Paradise. Then they severed his head from the body, skinned it, stuffed it with straw, and sent it, with other heads, along with the captives to Shiraz. And they sent an announce ment of their victory and triumph to Prince Nusratu'd Dawla, and fixed a day for their entry into Shiraz. And when on the appointed day they drew near, the city was decorated, and the people were busy enjoying themselves and making merry, most of them having come out from the town to meet the victorious troops and gaze on the captives " {pp. 123-4). One more extract of a passage relating to the second Niriz war is taken from the MS. of the Tdrikh-i-Jadid obtained by Mr. Sidney Churchill, and deposited in the Library of the British Museum. It is given at foot of pages 128-31 :? "The Babis fought most gallantly and were always victorious, until at length, after a desperate resistance, they were overcome and suffered martyrdom. Their persecutors,</page><page sequence="69">NOTICES OF BOOKS. 645 having captured and killed the men, seized and slew forty women and children in the following manner: They placed them in the midst of a cave, heaped up in the cave a vast quantity of firewood, poured naphtha over the faggots strewed around, and set fire to it. One of those who took part in this deed related as follows: 'After two or three days I ascended that mountain and removed the door from the cave. I saw that the fire had sunk down to the ashes; but all those women with their children were seated, each in some corner, clasping their little ones to their bosoms, and sitting round in a circle, just as they were when we left them. Some, as though in despair or in mourning, had suffered their heads to sink down on their knees in grief, and all retained the postures they had assumed. I was filled with amazement, thinking that the fire had not burned them. Full of apprehension and awe I entered. Then I saw that all were burned and charred to a cinder, yet had they never made a movement which would cause the crumbling away of the bodies. As soon as I touched them with my hand, however, they crumbled away to ashes. And all of us, when we had seen this, repented what we had done. But of what avail was this ? "' Four Appendices to the narrative are interesting and important. While the first relates to passages in it which Mr. Browne has not thought necessary to translate, the second treats of Haji Mirza Jani's History, with especial reference to those passages which the "New History" has suppressed or modified. The third Appendix is Mr. Browne's translation of a " Succinct Account of the Babi Movement," written expressly for him by Subh-i-Ezel. Our author rightly says: " On the importance of such an account coming from such a source it is unnecessary to dwell; it is almost as though, we had a narrative of the first beginnings of Islam told by 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib. That so valuable a document deserved publication will, I should think, be questioned by no one." The original Persian MS. of the writer, which is bound up with the remaining contents of the volume, after the Index, is also published separately.</page><page sequence="70">646 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. Appendix: IV. is a collection of original documents and fac-similes: one being a letter from the Bab himself; one the nomination of Subh-i-Ezel to succeed the Bab; one a letter from the Bab's amanuensis; and one a letter from the renowned Kurratu'l'-Ayn, a very Joan of Arc in the estimation of her co-religionists. We have already alluded to and quoted the lucid intro duction to the " New History," One more section remains: The Preface, which is part of the translated book itself, is perplexing in its incidental references to the writer's identity, and in a certain soupcon of European thought which involuntarily finds way amid the lines. It might almost be utilized as a tract for distribution among educated Persians?to be by thera re-distributed and interpreted among their less civilized brethren. More dignified in character than the satirical drama of Mirza Fath 'Ali Derbendi, ably rendered into the language of the Shah's subjects, by Mirza Ji'afir Adarbaijani?it might haply combine with this last to open the eyes of young Persia to the foibles of their countrymen; in which case no small step would have been taken in the direction of a healthy reform. F. J. G. The following appeared in the Academy of May 12th, 1894:? Sanskrit Literature in India. Students of Vedanta will be glad to hear that the fine edition of Suresvara's large vdrtika on the Brihaddrauyaka bhdshya, which has been issuing from the Anandasrama Press at Poona, is now qomplete. It consists of 2075 pages of text and commentary, with 144 pages of index to first lines. The preparation of the index was a herculean labour indeed, and I am not aware of the existence of another of equal magnitude. It was under* taken at my suggestion, and will prove of great value to</page><page sequence="71">NOTICES OF BOOKS. 647 students, and especially to quotation-hunters. The publi cation of the work itself has long been a desideratum, since every writer of the advaitav&amp;din school has drawn from it freely; and, moreover, it contains important allusions to Dharmakirti, as my friend Mr. K. B. Paihak knows. Dr. Burnell made a great mistake, therefore, when (in his Tanjore Catalogue) he wrote regarding it: "This work is of very little interest, as it simply consists of Sankara's arguments put into rather doggerel verse." The Anandasrama Press has already given us Suresvara's vartika on the Taittiriya-bh&amp;shya, and his Naishkarmya siddhi was edited by myself for the Bombay Sanskrit Series, so that the Mdnasolldsa and Panchikarana-vdrtika are now the only writings of his that remain unpublished. Perhaps Mr. Apte will give us these, Another important treatise recently sent forth from the same press is the Sutasamhitd, consisting of 1061 pages of text and comment, with 86 of index to first lines. The compiler of the latter, however, would seem to have been a novice at that kind of thing, as is evidenced, for instance, by his method of dealing with the words Yatsvarupam avijndya, which occur ten times on p. 646. But these are trifles, and merely show that learned Pandits have not yet attained to all the editorial niceties to which we are accustomed here. It would, perhaps, be heresy to assert that our friends in Calcutta still need extraneous aid or supervision in such trifling matters as politics, for instance, or in the somewhat more weighty concerns of local government; but that they urgently require it in the all-important art of book-making is a self-evident proposition. We should not then have, had 1300 pages of demy-octavo put into one unwieldy volume, as in the ease of the recently completed Varaha Purdna; or %h6 still greater enormity of 1700 pages of the same size thrust into a single volume of the Chaturvarga - chintdmani. Nor would the highly-esteemed Pandit who edited the Mlmdmsd Sutras and Bh&amp;shya have been allowed to send forth the second volume of the</page><page sequence="72">648 notes df the quarter. work without a title-page, if an English scholar had been at the helm. I wrote and suggested that that important prefix should be provided, and in due course one arrived; but it was for the whole work, comprising 780 plus 822 pages of text, and 123 of indexes! But the crowning feat of all was the publication of TaTanatha Tarkava chaspati's grand Sanskrit Lexicon of 5442 pages of royal quarto, without a single break for division into volumes! A conspicuous example, however, of successful work manship without foreign guidance is to be found in the publications of the Nimayasagara Press of Bombay, which, in spite of the lamented death, of its energetic founder and of the splendid Pandit who was the chief editor, continues to issue, in capital style, most valuable specimens of the literary treasures of India. It is to this press that we are indebted for really trustworthy editions of the best works on Alankdra and of the minor poems from which their authors drew so many of their illustrations? such, for example, as Haravijaya, Kuttanimata, Bhallata Sataka, Devisataka, GdthdsaptaSaU, and others which were never available before. The latest works on Poetics are Ruyyaka's Alankdrasarvasva and Appadikshita's Chitra mimdmsd. Prior to these, we had from the same source Vamana's Alankdrasutras with vritti, Anandavardhana's Dhvanydloka with Abhinavagupta's Commentary, Rudrafas Kdvyalankdra with the comment of Namisadhu, Jagan natha's Rasagangddhara, and Govind's Kdvyapradipa, with copious extracts from the Uddharana-chandrikd. To com plete the set I would strongly urge the publication of Udbhatfa's work, discovered by Mr. Buhler in Jesalmir, and deposited in the collection at Poona, and also of Anandavardhana's Prdkxit poem, Panchabdnalild, if it can be found. With the aid of such standard works as these, we are able to correct several of Vallabhadeva's mistakes as to the authorship of the passages contained in his Subhdshitdvali; and this has already been partly done by the late Pandit Durga Prasad. The other day, however, I met with another statement of Vallabhadeva's which</page><page sequence="73">NOTICES OF BOOKS. 649 needs investigation. He ascribes his verse 43 to a poet named Amritadatta, who is supposed to have flourished at the court of Shahbuddin of Kashmir, whose date is given by Cunningham as 1352 a.d. This same verse, however, is quoted by Ruyyaka in his Alankdrasarvasva (p. 159), which Dr. Buhler assigns to the beginning of the twelfth century. Will some friend kindly crack this chronological nut for us? The Bombay Sanskrit Series maintains its high character, and would hold its own anywhere. Among its recent issues is a second edition of Bhimacharya's Nydyakosa, a splendid volume of 1036 pages. As the former edition contained only 267 pages, this is practically a new work altogether. The preparation of such a book could not have been in better hands, the learned compiler having, as he tells us, made a life-long study of the works of the Nyaya and Vaiseshika schools of philosophy. I never had the pleasure of meeting Bhimacharya, but I knew his brother Janardanacharya, who was a learned Vedantist. Another important work just out is vol. i., in two parts, of Pardsara Smviti with Sayawa's commentary, edited by Pandit Vaman Sastri Islampurkar. References are given to as many of the well-nigh innumerable quotations as could be traced, and a list of authors and works quoted from is appended to each volume, and an index to the quotations. I have said "an index," but that is a misnomer; for, instead of an alphabetical list of all the quotations in each volume, we have the citations from each author arranged in separate lists. Consequently, part one has 136, and part two 154, distinct lists of quotations. This strange method makes them practically valueless, for, unless one knew the author from which a quotation is made, one might have to examine hundreds of lists. A little European experience here would undoubtedly have been of value. Let us now turn to Benares, with its three streams of Sanskrit literature. The last number of the Revue de VHistoire des Religions contained the following disquieting</page><page sequence="74">650 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. statement in reference to the Benares Sanskrit Series, which is under the superintendence of Profs. Griffith and Thibaut: " D'apres une information qui me vient de Tlnde, mais qui, je l'espere encore, ne se confirmera pas, cette excellente publication serait maintenant arr^tee." I fear that this information was correct, and that the streams have been, or will be, reduced to two. It is a thousand pities that one volume at least of Kumarila's Tantravdrtika should not have been completed before the series collapsed; as it is, we have ten fasciculi, comprising 960 pages, the last of which breaks off in the middle of a sentence, and no title-page; and so it must remain, unbound, in our bookcases, a melancholy monument to the instability of literary ventures in Benares! The Vizi anagram Sanskrit Series, which opened briskly in 1890, under the guidance of Prof. Venis, has, owing to his absence in Europe, experienced a temporary check. Let us hope that it may long hold its ground. The last volumes issued were Vidyarawya's Vivaranaprameya-sangraha and Sivaditya's Saptapaddrthi with a commentary. Our very old friend, The Pandit, has got into a decided muddle. It used to give us every month portions of four or five works with continuous paging, and a general index for the annual volume. Now, however, each separate portion has separate paging, as is the case with the Kdvyamdld of Bombay, and any ordinary mind would suppose that this was with a view to separate binding, each having its own title-page and index. Nothing of the kind, however, was contemplated; and we have this fearful conglomeration of separately-paged pieces, each breaking off in the middle of a sentence, yet stuck together with a general index as before. What oan have happened to the presiding genius of this aged periodical ? G. A. Jacob, Colonel.</page><page sequence="75">NOTICES OF BOOKS. 051 Notes on African Philology. North Africa. I. Professor Leo Reinisch, of Vienna, has published in the German language at Vienna three parts of a most valuable book, 204 pages. "Die Bedauye-Sprache in Nord-Ost Africa." In 1881 Professor Hermann Almkvist published at Upsala in Sweden his well-known volume. "Die Bischari-Sprache Tu-Bedauie." This new volume of Professor Reinisch is a valuable addition to our know ledge, consisting of Texts and Grammatical Notes, and including Dialects. The language belongs to the Hamitic Family, and is spoken in the regions betwixt the Upper Nile Basin and the Red Sea. IL Tigre is the chief language spoken in the Italian colony " Eritrea" on the African bank of the Red Sea. It is, with the exception of Arabic, the most extensively spoken language of Semitic origin. Its field is between the 16 and 18 degrees of N. latitude. It has no written literature, and it is only in recent years that it has been made the subject of philological research, while its southern sister language Tigrina was brought more than twenty years ago within the pale of Unguistical analysis. Captain M. Camperio's " Manuale Tigre-Italiano," comprising an outline Grammar, Dialogues and two Vocabularies, is intended to serve practical purposes only by facilitating intercourse between his countrymen and the Abyseinians. The Lazarist Father J. Schreiber's " Manuel de la langue Tigrai," the second part of which has recently been published at Vienna six years after the first, is a work of more ambitious aims. It deals, like the work of Professor Prsetorius, with the Tigrina dialect, but differs from that work by deriving its materials from the living language exclusively both as it is spoken and used in correspondence. The Character used is the Amharic, which has also been employed in the present work. The second part contains Tigrifia letters with a French translation, notes, and a vocabulary. The</page><page sequence="76">652 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. typographical execution, done at the celebrated printing office of Ad. Holzhausen at Vienna, leaves nothing to be desired. East Africa. III. In this Region the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge has published a great many small books in the different languages for the use of Missionary Societies. The point of view, from which I regard them on this occasion, is purely philological, and they do certainly represent an advanced, and advancing, knowledge of Vernaculars, of which the names even were unknown a quarter of a century ago. There is no use in setting out the names of these works, as the Student will find them in the Catalogues of the Society under their respective languages: these are of the Bantu Family the Megi, the Yao, the Nganga, the Swahili, the Gogo, and the Ganda; this region includes Victoria Nyanza and Lake Nyasa and the country between. The books are real, prepared by men in the Field, not by Scholars in their European studies. South Africa. IV. I have on my table a revised edition of the Grammar, by the Rev. Lewis Grout, American Missionary, of the Zulu language; the language is the chief amidst the many noble Bantu forms of speech in South Africa, and this book leaves nothing to be desired. V. To Mr. M. E. Weale, late D Troop B.S.A. Company's Police, we are indebted for a small Vocabulary, published at Cape Town, of the Tab&amp;e and Kalaka languages spoken in Ma-Shona-land and Ma-Tabele-land. The book consists of thirty-two pages, and is intended for the use of Prospectors and Farmers in the Ma-Shona-land. There are manifest Zulu affinities in these languages; it is a first effort, and no doubt will be followed by more serious productions. VI. The Rev. A. M. Hartman has published outlines of a Grammar of another Dialect spoken in Ma-Shona-land. This is but another drop of a coming shower.</page><page sequence="77">NOTICES OF BOOKS. 653 West Africa. VII. In the Quarterly Bulletin of the American Geo graphical Society it is proposed to publish a series of Notes of Bantu languages from the pen of the accom plished Scholar M. Hele Chatelain: his experiences lie in the Portuguese Colony of Angola on the West Coast south of the Equator. No. 3 of the series reached me a few days ago: "The Ma-Yaka and their Language." This is the first appearance of a new language; the geographical position of the tribe who speak it is indicated, and a Vocabulary and brief Grammatical Notes are appended. VIII. The late Colonel Ellis, of the First Battalion of the West India Regiment, stationed in West Africa, north of the Equator, in the British Colonies, has contributed an important volume on the " Yariba-speaking Peoples of the Slave-Coast of West Africa.". The chapters on Language, Proverbs, and Folklore tales are most valuable. It is published by Chapman and Hall, London, and should find a place in all Libraries. IX. The various useful publications, by the East London Institute for Home and Foreign Missions, on the Congo Group of the Bantu Family of languages, have recently received a valuable accession in a " Guide to the Lu-Nkundu Language" by J. and F. T. McKittrick. This language is spoken along with the Ki-Lolu by the Ba-Nkundu in the Ba-Lolo country in the great bend of the Congo where it crosses the Equator northwards. The two differ dialecti cally only. The Manual comprises, in addition to a short Grammar, with Texts, conversations, ' reading-lessons, and two Vocabularies, and is intended to be a companion volume to J. B. Eddie's Lolo Vocabulary. X. " Die Tone der Neger-Sprachen, und ihre Bezeich nung : erortert von J. G. Christaller, Basle, Switzerland." This is a short Pamphlet of nineteen pages on an important and intricate subject by a singularly well qualified Scholar, whose experience is in the Field.</page><page sequence="78">654 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. General Subject. XI. The same Scholar has contributed to the general subject of the languages of Africa an interesting and valuable Pamphlet of fifty-nine pages under the title "Die Sprachen Afrikas: von J. G. Christaller, Stuttgard." It is, in fact, a separate copy of a contribution to the Ninth and Tenth Annual Report of the Wurtemburg Society of Commercial Geography. XII. The Rev. Lewis Grout contributed a valuable Essay on African Languages to the Chicago Congress of 1893. XIII. In conclusion I may perhaps be permitted briefly to allude to my own contribution to the Chicago Congress. In 1881 I published, with the help of friends in every part of Europe, North America, and Africa, my two volumes of the " Modern Languages of Africa " : with carefully pre pared Appendices of Languages, Dialects, and Authorities. They were favourably received, and have been quoted by numerous writers. Twelve years had passed away, and a great number of additional books had been published, and the authors invariably honoured me with a copy. It was too soon for a second edition of my book before the lapse of a quarter of a century, so it occurred to me to publish in the English and French languages an Essay on the " Progress of African Philology from 1881 to 1893," forty-eight pages, with Appendices naming all the additional books published in that interval of time; it has been appreciated, and will greatly help the person to whom it falls in the next century to publish a revised edition of my Book.
