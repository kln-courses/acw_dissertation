<plain_text><page sequence="1">Oxford Review of Education, Vol. 18, No. 3, 1992 Michael Polanyi on the Activity of Knowing-the bearing of his ideas on the theory of multiple intelligences ROBIN A. HODGKIN ABSTRACT Michael Polyani's philosophy of science and his corresponding ideas about how we act, perceive and know was, in part, a revolt against materialist reductionism. In its place he offered a 'holistic' theory (not his phrase) of personal knowing: we build up small skills and percepts into larger wholes-Gestalts. Polanyi showed that such 'personal knowledge' did not have to be subjective and arbitrary because its components and unifying patterns could reflect real patterns in the universe. Polanyi's account of how two eyes present differing versions of the world is instructive. It can now be used as a model for understanding how the two parts of someone's brain may integrate two versions of the world into one synthetic consciousness. Howard Gardner's and the author's versions of 'the multiple intelligences' theory of how we learn and also the Sperry-Gaz- zaniga picture of how two brain hemispheres cooperate actively in making sense of the world are surveyed under this Polanyian rubric. These writers highlight both the necessity of active learning and the disciplining, articulating importance of linguistic skills in giving coherence to any multiple intelligence version of how a person acquires and expresses overall competence. In the brain model proposed here, the causal potency of an idea, becomes just as real as that of a molecule, a cell or a nerve impulse. (Roger Sperry, Science and Moral Priority, p. 36) We need to understand better both the blockages and the breakthroughs that character- ise learning experience; especially those obstructions and those long drawn out shifts in perspective which mark the roller-coaster of adolescence. A group of us, teachers, were trying to come to grips with these problems in the 1960s. We were working with 16 and 17 year-olds at Abbotsholme. This never was a 'progressive school' in the express- yourself-freely sense, much more a place of experiment; with a holistic, adventurous bias in its curricular tradition. We had already received some sharp eye-openers as to how challenging, guided course-work, spread out over 6 months or so, could transform a 14 year-old's attitude. We called such endeavours 'Alpha Projects', because, as long as you stuck at your project-usually writing a small, illustrated book-you would at least be likely to get an alpha minus. It was in the subsequent sixth form General Studies course ('Renaissance and the Roots of Science'-two terms, 2 hours a week!) that the thoughts of our teaching team began to turn to the central problem of this paper: what trick or dynamic is at work when a problematic, alleged slow-learner shows sustained interest and activity in the 253</page><page sequence="2">254 Oxford Review of Education art room for 6 months and then, for no obvious reason, transmutes this into competence in, say, biology A levels? Or how does competence in gymnastics convert, within 18 months, into successes in poetry and geography? What's going on? Are mental pictures or physical prowess catalysing the emergence of abstract language? Phrases such as 'character training' or 'responding to the challenge' only tended to blur the problem [1]. Two voices began to be heard in that decade, getting clearer in the 1970s and 1980s, which seemed to suggest an answer. One was Michael Polanyi's, whose writings and friendship came to mean much to me. He was articulating a non-reductive philosophy which in no way diminished science but set it in a framework of 'becoming'-of higher forms being integrated from disparate, simpler forms. He is still not well known, so I shall say rather more about him. The other was Roger Sperry, later to gain a Nobel prize. His researches were filtering through via The Scientific American and television. It became clear that his team was clarifying the way in which our two brain hemispheres cooperate with each other, integrating different versions of the world for a person's mind; and yet with the separate parts of the brain being programmed for distinctly different kinds of communicative competence. So did part of the explanation of a deep educational problem lie in this: that developing humans consist of several, partly innate, competences all of which can be active together? Does one faculty become temporarily blocked or slowed and then unexpectedly blossom? These were big questions and they still run across the curriculum like an erratic weft across the tight warp of 'subjects'. The new voices that we were beginning to hear were not opposed to the generally accepted view that both genetic and sociolinguistic influences are potent in shaping a child's development. For example, the importance of early role models ('competence models' Bruner called them) was, clearly, very great. But the discoveries of Sperry and his team seemed to suggest new ways of understanding the very unpredictable course which youthful development so often takes. Michael Polanyi's overarching, non- mechanistic, non-reductive world view seemed to clear the ground for this kind of new thinking about development. He claimed, for instance, that people (and animals) actively integrate smaller percepts into bigger ones, minor skills into major com- petences-that we build up a world of meaning. Here was a new paradigm within which to understand education and human development; including the development of an integrated and integrating mind. 1 POLANYI'S CRITIQUE OF EAST AND WEST Michael Polanyi was born in 1891. He was the youngest of a liberal, Jewish family. He himself was a polymath, born into a family of many gifts (Wigner &amp; Hodgkin, 1977). In the 1914-1918 War he was a doctor and then turned to research in physical chemistry. In the 1930s, seeing the way the Nazi wind was blowing, he and his family came to England. He held the Chair of Physical Chemistry at Manchester University from 1933 to 1948, and was made FRS in 1944. In the 1950s he turned to philosophy and wrote extensively about the underpinnings of science and culture. In 1958, he retired to Oxford where he was an Honorary Fellow of Merton College. During the 1930s and 1940s, Polanyi was becoming concerned about the failure of Western intellectuals to understand that both communism and fascism were rooted in false ideas about the impersonal nature and scope of science; nor were we in the West safe from the corrosive power of these errors. The characteristic assumption was that</page><page sequence="3">Michael Polanyi on the Activity of Knowing 255 science was essentially value-free, that we can control our economies and technologies by scientific methods and so solve our personal and world-wide problems without belief in any transcendent realities. A liberal of that time would probably have conceded that the USSR had made blunders but that it was on a good path. Polanyi on the other hand started from a more sceptical position, similar to that of F. A. Hayek but his critique soon became wider. He was highly critical, for example, not only of the 'nothing but...' explanations of Marxism but also of popular Freudianism. In addition, Polanyi occasionally spoke seriously about God and worship and used value- laden terms to describe the higher levels of evolution. A person, for example, was more real than a stone and Polanyi was at pains to justify such statements in his own scientific terms. It was not surprising that his great book Personal Knowledge, while it attracted some favourable attention, especially in America, also made enemies. By the 1960s, Popper too was challenging fashionable ideas about science; but Polanyi's wide, magisterial sweep was too much for him. Some Popperians launched a largely unjustified attack on Polanyi's alleged subjectivism, anthropomorphism and dogmatism (Sanders, 1988) [2]. Polanyi certainly did attribute great importance to 'communities of explorers' and to those persons who could create and hold together firm belief systems. In this he was a forerunner of T.S. Kuhn. Polanyi was emphatic that, while there was a need for scientists and other innovators to be alert to the risks of error involved in their work, they were bound, in being creative, to run such risks. For a time may come, as he stressed in 'The message of the Hungarian revolution', when we have to smash our old spectacles and don new ones (Knowing and Being, pp. 24-39). This was his metaphor for a paradigm shift or conversion, from one level of perception to a higher, more comprehensive or 'three dimensional', level. Tacit Knowledge One of Polanyi's well-known ideas is that 'we know more than we can tell'. His term for all the hidden structures, experiences and minor skills which underlie a person's present competence was 'tacit knowledge'. Unlike Popper, he focused on how it is that we are often guided by such tacit knowledge towards new insights in science and other fields. Popper concentrated much more on how we falsify or evaluate a guess or a hypothesis after we have acted on those initial insights. The concept of a very broad- based edifice of sub-skills acquired in childhood and of inherited structures underlying any human competence is characteristic of Polanyi. He stressed the importance of learning from a master or from a skilled practitioner, all such teachers being active within a tradition committed to high standards. But tacit knowledge, even when guided by a good tradition, will not be infallible. It can lead to error as well as to new and truthful insights. All our conscious acts, Polanyi maintained, are influenced by a host of these unconscious tacit factors. He took his examples not only from science and medicine but also from music. The pressure of the ivory keys on the finger tips of a pianist was one such example. Polanyi was not thinking, on Freudian lines, about suppressed desires but about the active roots of all knowing and doing. These roots come from the past, from the once conscious strivings and problems of a child's early learning; or they may be more deeply hidden influences-in the constraints and possibilities which evolution has imposed on us. Some aspects of Polanyi's developed picture of tacit knowing still remain problema- tic. There are questions, for example, about precisely what he meant by 'tacit'. Did he</page><page sequence="4">256 Oxford Review of Education make it mean too much? His basic idea here is that subsidiary skill or sense perception is tacit because our attention is elsewhere, on a point of active focal awareness, ahead of it. That, clearly is Polanyi's main and original meaning. But there are further overlapping meanings. I think there can be no doubt that he also included in the concept of tacit knowledge much that would normally be covered by such words as 'unconscious'-habits that were acquired long ago, for example, and bodily forms and propensities which undoubtedly play a part in tacitly guiding what we do and how we develop. To some extent, but perhaps insufficiently, his later writings clarified these meanings. Polanyi was particularly interested in the way in which minor skills are integrated into more extensive ones. Language was an example he used. Subtly shaped phonemes are integrated skilfully into words, words into grammatical sentences, and so on. Thus linguistic competence is built up of a hierarchy of skills with different rule systems operating at different levels. In this paper, I shall concentrate on another example which Polanyi offers: how binocular vision works. He explains how a person's or a primate's eyes cooperate to create three-dimensional visual consciousness. It so happens that this now provides us with an extremely apt model for understanding a parallel phenomenon: how our two brain hemispheres cooperate when we perform complex cognitive tasks and this is the main topic in what follows. It is in this connection that I bring in, and rely on, the discoveries and theoretical stance of Roger Sperry and his successors. At one level the two hemispheres can be considered as separate; at another-the level of normal consciousness-they cooperate. This approach has powerful supporters and is of great interest to educators; but the problems are extremely complex and the arguments and experiments will undoubtedly continue. We shall return to these problems in parts 3 and 4. 2 SEEING IN DEPTH: POLANYI'S EXAMPLE OF TACIT INTEGRATION Polanyi often reflected on how our conscious intentions are subtly blended with our unconscious abilities when, with apparent ease, we do complex things. He formulated his ideas by saying that a person's subsidiary skills (many of them acquired in infancy) and his or her 'subsidiary awareness'-e.g. that feeling of a familiar instrument in the tips of my fingers which I don't normally think about-all these tacit elements are made to converge on some point of 'focal awareness' which is 'out there', usually in the near future. Polanyi exemplified these ideas from many common achievements: learning to ride a bicycle or playing a difficult piece on the piano or acting on the stage: Subsidiary awareness and focal awareness are mutually exclusive. If a pianist shifts his attention from the piece he is playing to the observation of what he is doing with his fingers while playing it, he gets confused and may have to stop... A serious and sometimes incurable [version of this] is 'stage-fright' which seems to consist in the anxious rivetting of one's attention to the next word-or note or gesture... (Personal Knowledge, p. 56) In Knowing and Being, a book published 10 years after Personal Knowledge, Polanyi expands on this. He uses stereoscopic vision as a telling example of how animals with highly evolved visual systems integrate the slightly contradictory pictures from two eyes and use these 'subsidiaries' to create a new level of three-dimensional focal</page><page sequence="5">Michael Polanyi on the Activity of Knowing 257 awareness. In this, and in some of his other later examples, Polanyi indicates additional subtleties. The chief of these is that he distinguishes the functional part of the process (how the subsidiary bits work) from the semantic and phenomenal aspects (roughly, are they successfully integrated to form a focused image and is this a coherent entity with its own qualities?). This is how he puts it: We must distinguish between the two kinds of seeing: we are focusing our attention on the stereo image, while we see the two pictures only as they bear on the stereo image. We don't look at these two in themselves, but see them as clues to their joint appearance in the stereo-image. (Polanyi's emphases) Here, Polanyi is indicating a boundary between two levels of perceptual competence. He goes on to distinguish three stages by which we negotiate meaning across this boundary: from the subsidiaries (two eyes) to their joint 'focus'-ahead of us-evoking three-dimensional vision: We may describe the situation by saying that we are focally aware of the stereo-image by being subsidiarily aware of the two separate pictures. And we may add that the characteristic feature of the subsidiary awareness is to have... the function of bearing on something at the focus of our attention. Next we may observe that the focal image, into which the two subsidiary pictures are fused, brings out their joint meaning [i.e. semantic]; and thirdly that this fusion brings out a quality [phenomenal], not present in the appearance of the subsidiaries [where there was no depth quality]. (Polanyi's emphases) (Knowing and Being, p. 212) This is Polanyi's analysis of what he terms 'tacit integration': something we go on doing all the time without being aware of the process. His three-fold terminology may sound like hair-splitting. But in his subsequent use of these terms (functional, semantic, phenomenal), when he writes about how we assemble the subsidiary skills of language into macro-skills of speaking and writing complex sentences, paragraphs or chapters, the distinction becomes important. Consider, for example, the levels of difficulty a teacher may face in evaluating a piece of course work or a dissertation: it is fairly easy to assess the basic 'functional' skills of grammar, spelling and fact-finding; rather more judgement is needed for assessing the coherence and meaning of the entire work; more still for evaluating such qualities as integrity, depth and feeling-qualities which characterise the whole. There is another area of controversy which isolates Polanyi from mainstream perception theorists. He sided firmly with those who regarded visual perception as an active process: the visual system is not passive, like a camera. Yet he also resisted the Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894) view (now made popular by Richard Gregory) that our perceived mental pictures are built up from innumerable, minute, tacit inferences and deductions. 'The fusion of the two stereoscopic pictures to a single spatial image is not the outcome of an argument... not a deduction but an integration (Polanyi's emphases) (Knowing and Being, p. 212). This is certainly not a quibble because Polanyi regards living processes as being essentially integrative-smaller parts being constantly integrated into larger wholes. Polanyi was not alone in stressing the need for a less reductive and more holistic way of thinking about perception. Merleau-Ponty had been covering similar ground but without Polanyi's deep systematic analysis (Merleau-Ponty, 1962). For the past 30 years a somewhat similar case has been pressed by J.J. Gibson for what he calls an ecological or holistic view of perception (Grene, 1985; Gibson, 1986). The important</page><page sequence="6">258 Oxford Review of Education point here is that Polanyi regards our perceiving and, indeed, most of our conscious knowing as integration; the construction of higher-level meaningful entities from lower-level parts. Getting to know-learning-should almost always involve synthesis: the making of wholes from smaller patterns and processes. Analytic thought certainly has a place; in diagnosing faults or designing machines, for example. But in the initial stages of our perceiving and knowing we are habitually, and normally should be, on the lookout for the larger pattern-the Gestalt. Polanyi's account of binocular vision can now be taken as a model for understanding how human cognitive processes are able to integrate two or more differing but similar mental representations into one more complex version. What makes this possible today is that research in cognitive neurology has shown both the differences which exist in the two hemispheres of the human brain and also the high degree of cooperativeness which characterises their relationship. It is these qualities, apparently, which make it possible for two or more 'intelligences' to integrate their differing versions of what is happening 'out there' into one consciousness. In this case consciousness can be thought of as resembling counterpoint-that kind of music-making which blends at least two melodies into a composite unity. 3 THE THEORY OF MULTIPLE INTELLIGENCES In the 1970s, Jerome Bruner's writings were very influential and helped many teachers to form a developmental picture of children learning to work with several coordinated levels of skill. Other books such as The Art of Memory by Francis Yates were also pushing us in a direction of thinking about new or old pedagogic systems that might harness visual and language skills more effectively. I sketched out a many-layered model of competences in my Born Curious (1976, p. 116) and in 1985 worked it out more clearly in Playing and Exploring. Independently, and with more authority behind him, Howard Gardner, at the Harvard Project Zero for Human Potential, crowned his own wide-ranging research with Frames of Mind: the theory of multiple intelligences (1984). This drew on an impressive range of evidence, particularly from historical and anthropological sources. There was a marked convergence in his ideas and mine. The two lists in Table I show the similarity, apart from Gardner's No. 6, about which I have doubts. But these doubts do not affect the present paper. The evidence for some kind of multiple intelligence theory is persuasive though much of it is anecdotal. Anyone with wide teaching experience would probably find it congenial. But it is not generally accepted among cognitive psychologists and neurolo- gists. See, for example, Johnson-Laird (1984) where he is critical of Gardner for not digging deeper into physiological explanations of how, for example, musical and notational systems may depend for their joint action on 'a common underlying mechanism'. My own guess is that such digging will not be very productive and that the interesting questions will be about how the parts of the brain learn to cooperate during a life-history of joint action (see, for example, Corballis, 1991, p. 71, 'Genes versus culture') [3]. The rest of this paper will explore the conceptual problems of how we can usefully think about two or more cognitive faculties working together harmoniously. Gardner (1992) has given such a lead in his books on the education of multiple intelligences. However, despite quoting both Gazzaniga and Polanyi, he does not follow up the clues which they offer. He sees the importance of Polanyi's emphasis on apprenticeship in learning. But he fails to explore the overriding issue: that a multi-faculty view of the</page><page sequence="7">Michael Polanyi on the Activity of Knowing 259 brain's functioning demands a new synergistic or holistic way of thinking about how the parts can function and develop as a unity [4]. It is for this that Polanyi's basic model of two eyes integrating their slightly differing views of the world into a single, higher order, three-dimensional picture is so helpful. Sperry, too, had been preparing the ground for this kind of paradigm shift by insisting on the importance of 'top-down' as opposed to reductive and 'mechanical' explanations for mental phenomena (Sperry, 1983). Sperry's colleague, Michael Gazzaniga, seems to have been the first to sketch the picture of how the multiple brain acts as one: not by having a unified 'control' agent (a la Descartes) but by the separate parts being in touch with the same world-story, each taking in feedback about how it and its partners had been functioning. Gazzaniga is emphatic (1978, pp. 156-161) that his picture of two neural systems cooperating (each noting their action in this world, out there) could apply to 'a society' of several such systems. In discussing this, in what follows, I will also mainly use examples using left and right hemisphere cooperation: visual in the right and verbal in the left hemisphere. This is a synergy which teachers are implicitly familiar with. But a similar approach could be used for other 'intelligences'-bodily movement combining with music, for example. It is relevant to note, and to ask why it should be, that educational theorists have shown so little interest in why and how the joint action and exercise of our faculties should be so much more fruitful than their exercise in isolation: why and how, for example, do diagrams and descriptions help each other. In Playing and Exploring (1985), I was concerned mainly with the way in which our left and right hemispheres cooperate in visual and verbal learning and I was regarding these as just two out of the 'orchestra' which comprises one person's collection of faculties. So when we, as teachers, think about brains or parts of brains as learning and growing systems, it is generally important that we do so within this kind of overriding concept: that the whole 'orchestra' is understood as being an exploring, hypothesis-making, hypothesis-testing, ambiguity-sustaining, meaning-seeking person. And not only this, personal knowing all goes on TABLE I.

(p. 163) Then, on encountering Howard Gardner's very similar proposal for a modular system of human intelligences, I placed his and my systems alongside each other. I have reservations about Gardner's No. 6. It seems more like a general measure of underlying efficiency than a specific system. 4 FROM SEVERAL INTELLIGENCES TO ONE FOCUSED ACT The brains we were born with are no doubt quite incapable of grasping long division-let alone calculus or photosynthesis-without the aid of pencil and paper or chalk and blackboard. (Daniel C. Dennett, The brain and its boundaries, TLS, 1991) In his last years, Michael Polanyi could scarcely have been aware of the important research that was being done by Roger Sperry, Michael Gazzaniga and others on the complementary functioning of our 'two brains'. Yet his ideas about the integration of subsidiary skills and perceptions into richer levels of meaning are extremely apposite to the theory, now gaining ground, that there is more than one intelligence at work in everyone. I cannot do more than summarise a few of the main lines of enquiry here. They are, however, of sufficient interest to deserve attention from philosophically inclined teachers who are thinking about how human potential develops. What Polanyian concepts bring to this hypothesis is that when two or more of our intelligences or faculties are actively engaged in making mental representations of some problem or data we can integrate these two differing versions of the world into one combined version. A diagram and a theoretical statement, each reciprocally explaining each other, was Rom Harre's way of suggesting this in scientific exploring (1970). As with stereoscopic vision, the combined version is of a higher order of knowing and representing. It still could of course be mistaken; but it may be more truthful-nearer to the realities of the world than the simpler picture was. The Integrated Mind (1978) by Michael Gazzaniga and Jospeph LeDoux is an authoratative introduction to scientific work on the two hemispheres. It presents an integrative view about the way in which both hemispheres are different from each other, yet work together. The book, and especially its conclusion, prompt the reflection that philosophers and educationalists ought to become more engaged with questions of multiple intelligence; even though traditional psychologists may probably continue, for some time, with their defence of a single (measurable) intelligence. I shall give a brief outline of Sperry's experimental work, summarising some of the more relevant findings and will conclude by suggesting that Polanyi's from-the-parts-to-the-whole approach can provide a useful perspective for thinking about how two (or more) intelligences in one person can be active together-focused by that person in knowing or making or discovering something for the first time. By stessing 'for the first time' I am leaving on one side the obvious point that much of our mental power depends on memory-the retrieval and ordering of all the personal discoveries of childhood on which education must build. The classic 'split brain' experiments were carried out in the 1960s and 1970s on patients who had been surgically cured of severe epilepsy. The full story is complex but it has received wide publicity. Firstly, one should bear in mind the basic 180? twist</page><page sequence="9">Michael Polanyi on the Activity of Knowing to the incoming cerebal nerves which characterises the nervous systems of higher animals and causes the left brain to control the right body and vice versa. This reversal has no bearing on the argument which follows but it can confuse. Again, in almost all higher animals there is a large degree of symmetry in the brain, as in the body as a whole. In the brain of vertebrates, the two main hemispheres are linked by nerve bridges or commissures. These ensure that the same sensory information is available for both sides of the brain-acting together as one, not two, centres of control. In a horse's brain, for example, each eye will have transmitted quite different pictures of the terrain on each side, with a slight overlap at the front. Yet each hemisphere creates an all-round picture, part of which comes from the eye to which it is linked directly and part of which comes from the other eye but indirectly via the nerve bridge which passes information, almost instantaneously, from the opposite visual cortex. In humans, the situation is similar though all-round vision is much reduced, in the interests of much greater forward overlap and, therefore, of enhanced stereoscopic vision. In the severe epilepsy of these, so-called 'split brain' patients it was found that the patient's fit would sometimes spread from one hemisphere to the other across the main commissure. This was the reason for using the rather drastic surgical procedure of cutting the commissure. But afterwards the patients were still, apparently, able to see quite well and to act normally. So many questions remained: why were these patients so little harmed? How independent are the two hemispheres? What other means do the hemispheres have for intercommunication, apart from the commissures? Why had these massive commissures evolved, if they are dispensable? Sperry and his colleagues did hundreds of experiments on split brain patients, carefully screening the field of vision of each experimental subject and controlling other inputs so that each half brain could not know what the other half knew. Gradually a picture emerged of there being great autonomy as between the hemi- spheres. It was as if each hemisphere had a personality of its own. There were differences in what each hemisphere could do and also in emotional tone. Yet despite these differences and despite their being artificially isolated from each other there was a persistent degree of cooperativeness between the hemispheres; almost as though each supported the other in face of the interfering experimenter. Work in this field continues (Trevarthen, 1990; Efron, 1990). Less drastic versions of such experiments are now possible as drugs can be used, temporarily to put out of action chosen locations in the brain. Some of this had been understood before the research of the 1970s. Studies of brain injuries, for example, had shown that the left hemisphere was 'dominant', especially in language and in logical and numerical skills; whereas the right hemisphere was known to be the seat of pictorial, spatial and musical abilities. Further, it was realised that feelings and emotions are more easily expressed by the right hemisphere, though these do not necessarily originate there. What Sperry and his colleagues did was to clarify in detail how much of this worked. When Sperry's ideas began to circulate in the 1970s, popular psychologists such as Ornstein (1975) were quick to suggest that if only young people could be freed from the dominance of the left hemisphere there might emerge a generation of more harmonious and creative adults. Michael Gazzaniga rightly rejects this 'pop view' and suggests a more subtle dialectic. What is important is not some rivalry between our intelligences but the quality and extent of their cooperation [5]. Experiments established that the two sides of the brain do not enrich each other 261</page><page sequence="10">262 Oxford Review of Education only by internal neuronal communication inside the brain but outside it, by each part watching what the whole person does in the world. Feedback into the brain from all that it attempts outside (i.e. from all that its constituent parts working in concert attempt) is its crucial need. Sensory input may keep it active at a low level (watching the box, getting instructions) but feedback is what enables it to develop. The Integrated Mind is beautifully illustrated so the book itself carries messages for both sides of the reader's brain. In its final chapter the authors reflect on the social and legal implications of their research. What follows below is a brief survey of some of these findings. The whole idea of human development being the gradual integration of a person's several intelligences or faculties is one which educationalists should be taking seriously even though detailed supporting evidence for it may still be fragmen- tary and anecdotal. Summary of Relevant Split Brain Research Findings 1 Hemispheric autonomy. The skills located in each hemisphere operate with a high degree of autonomy. The two-sided brains of most higher animals share almost all the incoming sensory data by means of the commissural bridge(s). The commissural sharing of input is particularly important to animals when they are moving in unfamiliar ground. But in humans, unlike most other animals, the hemispheres are highly specialised, with the left one being specifically 'wired' for language. Because of this the hemispheres cannot exchange complex, cultural information by the internal (commissural) route. (A normal telephone system cannot handle pictures; to draw a rough parallel.) So the language side of the brain cannot handle maps, though it does, of course, handle place names. Similarly the right hemisphere normally has only rudimentary language skills, although these can sometimes, e.g. after injury, be stimulated to develop. This is only a brief sketch of an extensive field (but see Corballis, 1991). 2 Feedback from outside. How then do the two hemispheres of a single person communicate about complex constructs such as maps or logical statements? The answer is crucial and has already been suggested: the hemispheres communicate mainly by watching (sensing) what the whole person does, i.e. the whole person of which (whom) they are subsidiary parts. 'Behaviour', says Gazzaniga, 'is the key way that these separate information systems communicate with each other' (p. 157). This is a tricky but important idea: that from infancy, the different parts (intelligences/competences/faculties) of a person learn how each part is performing and learning from the others in the 'team' by watching the actions of the whole person. This is the fundamental reason why learning by doing is so important. And doing with other people has an additional, reflecting, value; multiplying the feedback. 3 A drive to cooperate. The hemispheres are habitually cooperative with each other. In split brain patients, even when one hemisphere was experimentally prevented from being aware of what was being done by its partner, that one hemisphere would still strive, by guesswork, to cooperate with what it took to be the intentions of its non-identical 'twin'. There is, in short, a deeply ingrained habit or drive in each hemisphere towards acting as part of a small team. The analogy of a conductorless ensemble such as a string quartet is helpful. Each instrumentalist is autonomous but is synchronised within the music, partly by a shared score and shared experience but more by the music itself which all four competent musicians are making and attending to. The concluding section of The Integrated Mind is entitled 'The multiple self and free will'. Here Gazzaniga argues persuasively that a degree of 'leadership' for the whole ensemble is given by the logic and language hemisphere and that this is not to be regretted. On the contrary, it is a necessary condition for responsible action among</page><page sequence="11">Michael Polanyi on the Activity of Knowing 263 humans who have evolved this way and who must continue to grow in organised networks of symbol systems. Gazzaniga sums up his case for what he terms 'a sociological relationship' between the different parts of the brain as follows: We are faced, it seems, with a new problem in analysing the person. The person is a conglomeration of selves-a sociological entity. Because of our cultural bias towards language and its use, as well as the richness and flexibility which it adds to our existence, the governor of these multiple selves comes to be the verbal system. Indeed a case can be made that the entire process of maturing in our [or any] culture is the process of the verbal system's trying [sic] to note and eventually to control the behavioural impulses of the many selves which dwell inside us. (p. 161) Gazzaniga is certainly being bold when he makes suggestions such as the above. Like Michael Polanyi, Roger Sperry and his followers have not been afraid to challenge the excessively reductionist fashions of the life sciences. The debate is important and rumbles on. Gazzaniga has been criticised for unduly emphasising the inarticulacy of the right hemisphere (Zaidel, 1983, pp. 525-536). He has also been charged, along with his allies, with 'failing to clear up profound epistemological and conceptual confusions that are proving fatal to the field of laterality research', by Robert Efron (1990, p. 102). Efron has done extensive experimental work on normal subjects. He proposes an interesting brain model which assumes that the two hemispheres normally work in a closely integrated manner, sharing between them the rapid scanning and processing of the whole cognitive field. Though I am not qualified to comment on this extremely complex problem, it seems to me that Efron's main complaint is against Gazzaniga's emphasis on specialisation of function, particularly his denial of the right hemisphere's part in handling language: for example, he asks what about the recognition of letter shapes? That would seem to involve the right hemisphere. He is in no doubt about the constant cooperative synergy between the various brain systems. One cannot help wondering, therefore, whether the sound and fury of Efron's fusilade is justified. Gazzaniga himself put forward the radical notion that the brain's parts are like 'a society' of systems. Whether or not he exaggerated the leadership role of the left hemisphere, time will tell. For ordinary teachers who take the idea of multiple intelligences seriously the following principles which derive, in varying degrees, from Polanyi, Sperry and Gazzaniga still stand. (1) The various brain systems in a human being are very different but have learnt to cooperate and learn from each other. (2) They do this mainly by 'feedback', by watching, externally, the successes and failures of the parts and of the ensemble. (3) The language-logic-maths system has a 'governing' role in relation to the others and creates the stories, myths, theories and hypotheses which characterise the culture they grow in. (4) When two or more systems cooperate in effective action they generate richer, deeper representations of what is or might be, than one system alone can. This stems directly from Polanyi's binocular vision paradigm. If we keep in mind Polanyi's insight that most of a person's knowing and doing and discovering bears on a point of action-of 'focal awareness'-more or less ahead of that person, we can envisage two or more kinds of intelligence active at such a focus.</page><page sequence="12">264 Oxford Review of Education An engineer, for example, will project a model of his or her ideas onto the focus of attention. He or she will make a right hemisphere picture of, for example, a bridge, and sketch it out on paper. Inner speech will also be occuring. At the same time the engineer will be speculating, sotto voce, and calculating as to how it all might work. All such small actions help inter-hemispheric awareness of what is being planned for the future. It looks as though human learning and creativity generally involve this kind of cooperative, 'out there' interaction between more than one of our faculties. This is an anti-reductionist and anti-Cartesian way of looking at cognition but it may help to free education and psychology from a failure to comprehend the great potentiality of human individuals and groups. The concept is anti-reductionist because, as Polanyi taught, a person's mind is not its parts but what the mind-body does as an integrated system. It is anti-Cartesian because it makes unnecessary the supposed focus of consciousness inside our heads (the pineal, the homunculus or some such thingummy) and places consciousness partly outside, in the world of intentions and of activity which we can share with others [6]. Michael Polanyi seems to have had in mind some such complementariness-intui- tive, non-linear and playful apprehension feeding into disciplined articulation-when he writes about the way a mathematician procedes, who works his way towards discovery, by shifting his confidence from intuition to computation and back again from computation to intutition, while never releasing his hold on either of the two. [This] represents in miniature the whole range of operations by which articulation disciplines and expands the reasoning of man. (Personal Knowledge, p. 131) To make an articulate, shareable and testable version of any orderly pattern that we discover in the world should be the prime aim of scholarship and particularly of science. So the left hemisphere skills of articulate expression must always be given a kind of priority. Nevertheless, when confronting the almost inevitable problem of breadth in, say, the secondary school curriculum, we easily fall into the trap of seeing the high-status, language-like skills-rhetoric, clear language, mathematics, musical notation-as justifiably squeezing the other, so-called practical subjects. Yet they do not have to be in competition. A broad curriculum need not be a matter of many subjects, thinly spread and jostling for timetable space. Breadth can be attained with relatively few subjects if the left hemisphere skills are drawing deeply on, and integrating from that rich array of intelligences which lies, often untapped, in every one of us. The human brain cannot learn much by looking fixedly at any box; nor, primarily, by rote learning divorced from meaning. It must grapple. Its ensemble of faculties can only help each other to grow in increasing integrity through action, out there in the world beyond the brain cavity. That is why the quality of tool use, the quality of instrumental play, the quality of students' and teachers' exploring natural phenomena, of making poems, or plays or pots... that is why some good making is always paramount. The creative arts-the makings-cannot all be attempted but in some, at least, excellence can be experienced. NOTES [1] In the late 1960s and 1970s many secondary schools were being encouraged to widen their sixth form (pre-university) curriculum and to take General Studies</page><page sequence="13">Michael Polanyi on the Activity of Knowing 265 more seriously at that stage. Alec Peterson, Oxford's Director of Educational Studies, was the main protagonist of this. He ran a ginger group called 'ABC' (Attempt to Broaden the Curriculum) and many schools responded by seriously attempting to approach the target he proposed-I think it was 30% of sixth form time to be spent on serious General Studies and non-specialist study. The influence of this initiative was evident in the emergence of the International Baccalaureate (which Peterson backed vigorously) but much less in the evolution of A level courses. The debate, alas, still drags on. [2] Andy Sanders (1988) a Dutch theologian and philosopher has recently defended Polanyi against the criticisms of the Popperians. He also discusses Polanyi's Kantian ideas, briefly showing that he was a constructivist in regard to perception and the shaping of our thought; but he was not a relativist, for the patterns we build and find reflect the real universe. Sanders also finds links with C.S. Peirce. See also Colin Gunton in TORRANCE, T. (Ed.) Belief in Science and Christian Life. [3] The plausibility of many of the issues raised here in regard to separate intelli- gences or faculties is the subject of Jerry Fodor's Modularity of Mind. Like Howard Gardner, Fodor acknowledges Franz Josef Gall (d. 1828) as the psycho- logist who first developed these ideas: 'It seems to me that the notion of a vertical faculty [in the brain] is among the great historical contributions to the develop- ment of theoretical psychology. So why isn't Gall honoured in the text books?' Fodor's answer is that Gall made serious mistakes, of which the most egregious was the fouding of phrenology (pp. 22-23). It brightened many Victorian social occasions, but cast a long shadow over everything else that Gall had written; and was wrong. [4] In Gardner's The Unschooled Mind (1992) he restates the multiple intelligences theory and describes how Project Zero at Harvard has grappled with the big question of the depth and shallowness of learners' understandings. The book is full of interest but Gardner, wrongly in my view, makes much of the importance of museums as a powerful resource; museums, even with 'hands on' displays, suggest a passive view of understanding. Workshops, purposive expeditions, a youth orchestra or imaginative drama would have been better examples for maximising the feedback from several intelligences, actively engaged with the learning material. Minimise the gawping; maximise the committed involvement sums up what is required. [5] I have only come across one attempt to bring 'split brain' research and Polanyian ideas together. In 1980, Jerry Gill wrote 'On Split Brains and Tacit Knowing' (International Philosophical Quarterly, 1980, pp. 49-58). Gill tends towards the 'pop' view by equating right hemisphere functions with tacit knowing (p. 54) rather than exploring their complementariness. Nevertheless he adds a wise conclusion: '[No] culture can dispense with either set of functions associated with the two hemispheres... each culture as well as every individual in it has its own tacit framework, wisdom and mythology... out of which its mode of explicit rationality takes place' (pp. 56-57). [6] Daniel Dennett in his wide ranging and entertaining Consciousness Explained demolishes any form of Cartesian model for the brain. Unified 'bureaucratic' models fare no better. He spells out the case for the brain comprising many parallel, often competing, systems which can learn to be harmonious in their workings. Language is rightly seen as the principal reinforcer and moderator.</page><page sequence="14">266 Oxford Review of Education Dennett sees these systems as less 'encapsulated' than do either Fodor or Gardner. But he fails, in my opinion, to consider adequately the possibility of a from-the- parts-to-the-whole system of mental dynamics, of the kind that a Polanyian perspective would suggest. Dennett's bias remains correspondingly reductionist and therefore materialist; in contrast to Sperry whose 'idealist' position is proclaimed at the beginning of this paper. REFERENCES ALLEN, R.
