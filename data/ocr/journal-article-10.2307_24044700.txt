Within this short poem, the words "hermit," "haunt," mas, his own doomed quest for a place he could call home, "lone," "heath," and "quarrys" are all repeated, and the word If Clare's contemporaries had often treated him and his en "frequent" is echoed in the world "unfrequented." Such rep- tire social class as "vermin," it allows him to achieve a more etition seems aesthetically justified, however, by a doubling of distanced perspective upon what it means to be human, and poetic perspective; everything in the poem is described from upon what reality may exist outside of social relationships; both a human and a non-human point of view. Thus the bird and in this sense there may be a much more real sense of is described as a "hermit" in the first line, but by the end of affinity between Clare and the bird than there is between the poem the speaker has come to feel a "hermit joy" in the Clare and the rest of humankind. If the human "tribe" is bird's presence. The "frequent quarries," created by human embarked on a rectilinear path of conquest over nature, commerce, give way to "the unfrequented sky," the sole Clare will follow a different course, circling round the same haunt of the solitary bird.

The one certainty is that the literary kind that celebrates simplicity is far from simple in either practice or critical taxonomy" (85). In Curran's persuasive analysis of the literary origins of Romanuc pastoral, Clare appears in footnote 42, p.237. Lore Metzger's One Foot in Eden (1986), definitive and ranging, overlooks Clare's innovations in the pastoral mode. 2In Some Versions of Pastoral (1935) Empson says "taken widely the formula might include all literature" (23), which his study often tends to do. 3On the disastrous consequences of ancient Mediterranean de forestation, see Clive Pointing, A Green History of the World: The Envi ronment and the Collapse of Great Civilizations (1991), 68-78. 4 Raymond Williams rigorously demystifies the pastoral ideal in The Country and the City (1973). The ideological determinants of the pastoral mode are further examined by Annabel Patterson, Pastoral and Ideology: Virgil to Valéry (1987). 5Cowper, The Task, Book 6 (530). "The economy of nature" was an expression commonly used in the later eighteenth century to denote the interdependence of all living things. On the early devel opment of this concept, see Donald Worster, Nature's Economy: The Roots of Ecology (1977). 6"Rough sketch of an Essay sent to the London Mag" [circa October, 1823], first published in John Clare, Cottage Tales, ed.

Clare transcribed "Pastoral Poesy" into a manuscript volume in 1831-1832, but the poem remained unpub lished until 1935. 8This pattern of double meanings (encoded in Clare's non standard spelling of such words as "enarmoured," "swarthy/swathy," and "main/mane") is more fully examined by Barbara Strang, "John Clare's Language," in John Clare, The Rural Muse (London, 1835; rpt. 1982), 162. 9On the ideological basis of Clare's "green language," see Wil liams, The Country and the City, 133-141.
