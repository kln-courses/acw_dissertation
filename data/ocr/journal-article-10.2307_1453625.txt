<plain_text><page sequence="1">JUSTIN MARTYR AND THE JEWS By BEN ZION BOKSER, Queens College JUSTIN THE MARTYR was one of the most eminent spokesmen of the early Church. He had two targets in his defensive writings on behalf of Christianity; Greek philosophy and Judaism. He was born around ioo C.E. in Neapolis, the modern Nablus, long a center of Samaritan population which prac- ticed a dissident Judaism and felt hostility to the Jewish community, and its pharisaic and rabbinic leadership. He had been an assiduous follower of Greek philosophy, but philosophy did not satisfy his restless soul, and he was finally converted to Christianity. He saw in Christianity another, a truer philosophy. This is how he describes his encounter with an aged Christian whose words turned him toward the Christian Church: "When he had spoken these and many other things ... he departed ... But straightway a fire was kindled in my soul and I was seized with love for the prophets and for those illustrious men who are the friends of Christ; and reflecting upon his words I found this philosophy alone safe and reasonable. In this way I am a philosopher." 1 He wrote The Apology to defend Christianity against Greek philosophy, but he introduced into this work many strictures I Dialogue with Trypho, 8: I, 2.

One work of a specifically anti-Jewish nature was his Dialogue with Trypho, written toward the latter half of the second century. He was martyred because of his faith as a Christian some time between I63-I67 C.E. The dialogue was a popular literary form among the Greeks. Its characteristic is not an inquiry into a given problem out of an unconditioned seeking for the truth. The dialogue is generally a guided structure to bring the person who is the foil for the discussion leader to a final realization of the truth. The discussion leader generally knows the truth from the start, but he uses the conversational method to bring his participant in the conversation to a concurrence with his views. This is the typical character of the Platonic dialogues. This is also the character of the Dialogue with Trypho. The latter is a Jew, whom Justin seeks to enlighten in the virtues of Christianity. Trypho is, however, a straw man, who offers little challenge to Justin. He listens with sympathy; his occasional interruptions are only an excuse for Justin to expound the various aspects of his Christian philosophy. At the conclusion of the dialogue Trypho does not announce his full conversion to Christianity, but he has clearly been im2lpressed, and one has the feeling that the final step is likely to follow a further reflection on the truths which have been communicated to him. Justin's own conversion, it will be recalled, was also a slow response to a dialogue with a Christian. All that the Christian sage did was to plant the seed; time and meditation did the rest. He followed the same method of seeding the mind of Trypho with Christian truth and he hoped that a similar harvest would follow in time. Justin's proposition is simple. It is but an elaboration of the arguments which fill the pages of the New Testament. It is the claim that authentic Judaism is really Christianity, that the pioneers idealized by Jews as the heroes of their faith, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, Moses and the prophets- they are all in truth the heroes of Christianity. Jesus was the messiah long expected by Jews and foretold in the Hebrew</page><page sequence="3">JUSTIN MARTYR-BOKSER 99 Bible, and the cult built around his ministry has superseded the institutions of biblical Judaism. The Jews who continue to cling to Judaism have failed to follow the logic of their own faith's unfolding; they are obstructing the design of salvation as intended by God and as taught in their own Scripture. The Judaism which persists, Justin maintains, is an anachronism, a fossil, a distortion of true Judaism, which lives on in true authenticity in the Christian Church. How does Justin establish these daring claims ? His principal method is hermeneutical; he argues by an appeal to the inter- pretation of the Hebrew Bible. The Hebrew Bible itself is, of course, free of any explicit teachings which might support Justin's claim. But the Bible, he maintained, must not be read in accordance with the literal meanilng of its text. Its true meaning must be sought through various canons of figurative interpretation. The Christian exegesis of the Hebrew Bible, as employed by Justin, did not invent the figurative interpretation. Philo, too, used figurative interpretations in order to read Greek ideas into the texts of the Hebrew Bible. The Rabbis likewise allowed themselves to interpret the Bible figuratively in order to read into it various theological and homiletical ideas made necessary by the contemporary experiences of the Jewish society caught in the whirlpool of great historic changes. This is essentially the hermeneutical method of midrash. Christian exegetes like Justin followed, in a sense, the midrash, but directed it to their own ends-to read their new experience, the belief in the messiahship of Jesus, into the Hebrew Bible; and this became a common weapon in Jewish-Christian polemics. The similarity as well as the differences between the Jewish and Christian midrash is well illustrated in the treatment of messianic passages. The Hebrew Bible at various points affirms the hope of a golden age in the fuiture, when the knowl- edge of God will at last win ascendency in the human heart, and, touched by the new enlightenment, men will build an</page><page sequence="4">00 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW ideal world order of universal justice and peace. Sometimes this consummation is described as proceeding without a particular human intermediary, at other times an ideal leader is projected as the mediating agent, a messiah, the Hebrew for " anointed," an allusion to the ancient practice of investing a great leader or king by anointing him with oil; kings Saul, David, Zedekiah, and even the pagan King Cyrus of Persia are all referred to by this designation.2 The messianic hope also had a specifically Jewish dimension. Especially in the period of Jewish suffering at the hands of various predatory powers, this hope was read to include a future restoration of the Jewish people. And often in the Hebrew Bible the mediating agent for the enlightenment of the world is assumed to be Israel itself, as the custodian and witness of God's truth to the world. The rabbinic midrash frequently comments on such pas- sages, and occasionally seeks some clue as to when the epoch of promised liberation would commence, but all such com- ments remain in the category of homiletics; they do not establish doctrinal authority. Occasionally a teacher, assuming that the trauma of events in his own time marked the breaking in of the messianic redemption, might identify the messiah with the contemporary leader who played a dramatic role in that development; this, however, was a private opinion which would often be challenged by another teacher. Thus Rabbi Akiba, impressed with Bar Kokhba's initially astonishing victories against the Romans, thought that Numbers 24:I7, "There shall step forth a star out of Jacob, and a sceptre shall rise out of Israel," 3 was fulfilled in Bar Kokhba, and when he saw him he would exclaim, "This is king messiah!" Rabbi Yohanan ben Turta dismissed this identification as absurd.4 Justin's exegesis always applied all such passages to the messiahship of Jesus; this interpretation, moreover, was read 2 I Samuel 24:7, II Samuel 22:51, Lamentations 4:20, Isaiah 45: I . 3 XM^,trn u npl zprn T:)":) 1-7 4 Yerushalmi, Taanit 4: 3.</page><page sequence="5">JUSTIN MARTYR-BOKSER IOI with dogmatic rigidity, as the one and only meaning of the text, and that whoever rejected it, rejected the true teaching of the Hebrew Bible. The rabbinic midrash, moreover, operates within a delimit- ing context, which is the general world view of Judaism. The Christian midrash, especially as expounded by Justin Martyr, is much more radical in nature; it breaks the boundaries of Judaism. It seeks to demonstrate from the Hebrew Bible itself that a new scripture has been revealed to supersede the Hebrew Bible; that the law prescribed with such emphasis and so often idealized in the Hebrew Bible is obsolete, and even an inferior path for bringing man closer to God; that the Jewish people, having rejected Jesus, has itself been rejected by God. The exegetical element in Jewish-Christian polemics has largely been undermined by the modern study of the Bible. Jews are less prone to seek clues to the "end" in an esoteric allusion in some biblical text; Christians also are less inclined to read allusions to Jesus in the Hebrew Bible, which was written centuries before the appearance of Jesus. Fundamen- talists still engage in this endeavor, but the modern exegete generally sees the Bible in the context of time and circum- stances, whose timeless elements are to be sought in ethical and moral exhortation, in a general conception of history as the odyssey of man's ascent to God in response to divine prodding, through various encounters in human experience. In any case, the thrust of modern Christianity is not to find new sources of invective against Judaism but to seek the road to a better understanding between the faiths in a shared service of God and man. But Justin's polemic against Judaism remains a vital document in the history of the encounter between these two faiths. And to the extent that Justin's con- ceptions entered the mainstream of Christian thought a reexa- mination of this document becomes a task of contemporary significance. For it is a reminder of the deep roots from which the Christian antipathy for Jews and Judaism was nurtured and it</page><page sequence="6">I02 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW helps define the scope of the problem the Church must face if this antipathy is to be overcome. Here are two passages in which Justin demonstrates from the Hebrew Bible that Judaism had been conceived in the Hebrew Bible itself as having but temporary efficacy, and that a new law destined to endure forever was due to replace it. In Justin's own words: "For in fact, I have read, Trypho, that there is to be both a final Law and a covenant that is superior to all others, which must now be observed by all those who lay claim to the inheritance of God. For the Law given at Horeb is already antiquated and belongs to you alone, but that other belongs to all men absolutely. And a Law set over against a Law has made the one before it cease, and a covenant coming into existence afterwards has in like manner limited any former one. And-as an eternal and final Law was Christ given to us, and this covenant is sure, after which there is no law, or ordinance, or command."5 The two passages cited by Justin to demonstrate the obsolescence of Judaism are Isaiah 5I:4 and Jeremiah 3I:3I. Here is the Isaiah passage as cited by Justin: "Or have you not read what Isaiah says: Hear ye me, hear ye me, 0 my people, and ye kings hearken unto me, for a law shall go forth from me and my judgment for a light of the nations. My righteousness draweth nigh speedily, and my salvation shall go forth, and nations shall set their hope on my arm." 6 5 Dial. II: 2. Williams uses in his translation the term "disposition" rather than "covenant," but this is erroneous; the Hebrew brilth, ren- dered as diathleke in the Septuagint Greek Bible used by Justin, means covenant, and it was so used by Justin.

Justin apparently took the statement "a law shall go forth from me and my judgment for a light of the nations ... and nations shall set their hopes on my arm," as referring to a new law, which was to break the barrier of the Jewish people, and reach out to the nations of the world. Christians claimed that the gospel was the new law to have arisen in Judaism and it was indeed making many converts among the gentile nations. Justin, therefore, saw in the gospel of Jesus a fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy and he read the prophecy itself as having projected this very consummation: that the new law would arise to replace the old, and it would achieve victories the old law had been powerless to accomplish. Isaiah's prophecy does not speak of a new law superseding the old. The term which Justin translated as law is the Hebrew torah which has the general meaning of instruction. It is some- times used in a technical sense as referring to the specific teachings of Judaism, in their comprehensiveness, of which law is only one element, while at times it is used for instruc- tion generally without reference to Judaism as such. The term translated by him as "judgment" is the Hebrew mishpat which means law. The verse in Isaiah is part of the messianic hope in Judaism, that the time will come when the nations of the world will be enlightened in the knowledge of God and in the principles of moral behavior. The medieval Jewish comment- tator Rashi identifies the term torah in the Isaiah verse with the writings of the prophets, and mishpat with the laws, thus including the whole biblical religion; Rabbi David Kimhi (ii60-I235) sees a parallel to this verse in Isaiah 92:3 ("for out of Zion shall go forth instruction"), and he interprets this passage to mean: "for the king-messiah will teach the nations to walk in God's ways." 7 Professor James Muilenberg writes in his commentary on Isaiah in the Interpreter's Bible: "The 7n ,,nrn~n -inx rrrr7 "tD;nn "n ,-I trsnw//Xn n-rmrx- ,~n -)</page><page sequence="8">I04 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW oracle is addressed to the chosen people ... the message to the people is set in the matrix of the call to Israel, the servant of the Lord".8 The second passage quoted is Jeremiah 3I: 30-32. Here is Justin's version of it: "And He speaks thus by Jeremiah about this same new covenant: Behold the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the House of Israel and the House of Judah, not that which I made with their fathers, in the day when I took hold of their hand to lead them forth from the land of Egypt." It will be helpful to complete the passage cited by Justin. The omitted parts read thus: "my covenant which they broke, though I was their husband, says the Lord. But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel in those days, says the Lord: I will put my law in their inward parts and I will write it in their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people." 9 The allegation that Jeremiah projected in this passage a replace- ment of the old covenant with a new covenant appears in the New Testament,'0 and it is a common interpretation in con- ventional Christian Bible exegesis. A strict confrontation of the text in Jeremiah rules out this interpretation, and many modern Christian exegetes so acknowledge it. Jeremiah's words do not envision a replace- ment of the Torah by a new revelation, but rather a change in the people. It is the same Jewish people who remain the bearers of the new covenant as they were of the old. Verse 33 with which the Jeremiah passage continues, makes this clear: "And no longer shall each man teach his neighbor and each 8 Vol. V, pp. 592 f- 9 Dial. II: 3.

The covenant will appear new because the people will finally yield unreservedly to its truths. Some Jewish exegetes noted the conventional Christian use of the Jeremiah passage and argued for its inadmissability. Saadia Gaon alludes to those who argue for the abrogation of the Sinaitic covenant because the prophet speaks of God giving His people a new covenant. Then he continues: "To these I say: Why don't you look at what follows this verse, where it is stated explicitly that the new covenant mentioned before was the Torah itself. Thus, Scripture says, But this is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after those days--I will put My law in their inward parts (Jer. 3I: 32). It would differ from the first covenant in only one respect-that it would not be broken this time as it was broken the first time, as Scripture says, For as much as they broke My covenant although I was Lord over them" (Jer. 3I:32).12 Rabbi David Kimhi quoted Saadia's interpretation and then, in additional support, cited the closing lines of the prophet Malachi which concluded the entire epoch of biblical prophecy. In a peroration of what the prophets left as their legacy to their people Malachi stated (Malachi 3:22): "Remember the law of My servant Moses, the statutes and ordinances that I commanded him at Horeb for all Israel .". . 13 Bearing in mind that Horeb is but another name for Sinai, Kimhi notes: "Here one sees readily that there will not be a new Torah but 11 t351:, ): ,-,In nmg I-7 wmx I-nn nm r)XI Inw1;7 nm rx '15&gt; rmnr5) Xa -1:)T Xb mnnxronl mrw57 n5ox ): )., 83m n:1lm8 -57I tntjpn -v7x7 IV-T.) 11 ~~~~~~~~~ ,'~~~~~~~~ fl ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ '71 12 Saadia Gaon, The Book of Beliefs and Opinions, tr. by Samuel Rosenblatt, (New Haven, Yale University Press, I948), Treatise III, Ch. 8, p.

Bernhard W. Anderson put it thus: "The prophet does not speak of a new Torah but of a new covenant relationship which will enable men to obey the covenant stipulation out of inner motivation ... The purpose of covenanting, in both instances, is the establishment of relationship to God and people." 15 James Philip Hyatt expresses the same thought more categorically: "The new covenant does not involve the giving of a new law; that is unnecessary . . . The covenant is to be new in the sense that it will confer a new, inward motivation and power for fulfilling the law already known." 15 This passage in Jeremiah is also part of the eschatological hope in Judaism. Whereas Isaiah envisioned the spread of Israel's truth as a power of enlightenment for all mankind, Jeremiah's vision is inwardly directed, toward his own people. In the present state the profession of Israel's faith was often shallow, and superficial. The time will come, taught Jeremiah, wlhen the Torah will win a total response from the people, giving it not a formal or external response but a deep and wholehearted devotion. Every ideal which men profess needs to move from this formal and spurious victory of gaining formal acceptance, to the genuine victory of winning a total penetration of the person. Justin regarded the change from Judaism to Christianity as the change which fulfilled the prophetic hopes. He saw in the Christian Church the end of the road of the world's moral and spiritual progress; and because Jews found these judg- ments rash and unsupported by a realistic appraisal of the 14 Kimhi on Jer. 3I:30. ;'lfln m5'w&gt; ,rnn Xb )' trxvim nx ... tt:n:11M li nn111e1 n lx e7to :11MAV 112D I'll't 101:1 lian:87 In I5x ;nr7 15 B.

In Justin's own words: "And from their [adherents of Christian- ity] works, and the power that accompanies them, all can understand that He [Jesus] is the new Law, and the new Covenant, and the Expectation of those from among all the nations, who await the good things that come to them at the hands of G-od. For we are the true and spiritual Israelitish [nation,] and the race of Judah and of Jacob and Isaac and Abraham, who, when he was still uncircumcised, received witness from God for his faith and was blessed, and was called father of many nations-we, I say, are all this who were brought nigh to God by Him who was crucified."16 In arguing against the messiahship of Jesus, Trypho cited the verse in Deut. 2I :23.17 Here we have a warning against allowing the body of one hanged for a crime to remain exposed beyond nightfall; the text explains the objection thus: "for he that is hanged is a reproach to God." This conventional rendition of the verse follows the rabbinic interpretation; as Trypho renders it, however, the verse is read to mean that one who hangs is cursed by God, a rendition which follows the translation of the Septuagint and is repeated in the New Testament 18; it also appears to have been the way the verse was understood in the text of Pesher Nahum.19 Justin's answer was that the death of Jesus was made to 16 Dial.

He died in a manner which involved a curse because those who lived without the benefit of his atoning dearth were cursed. Jews were specifically told that if they did not obey the entire law they would be under a curse,20 and no mortal can observe the law in its entirety; gentiles surely who lived without the benefit of any moral discipline were under a curse. In another passage he maintained that the curse implied in the death of Jesus by crucifixion was a prediction of the depravity of the Jews who would curse all followers of Jesus.21 In the Talmud we have two explanations for the notion that he who hanged was a reproach to God, both quoted in the name of teachers who lived after the time of Justin. According to one view hanging was limited to offenses of blasphemy or idolatry, which made the exposed body a symbol of a reproach to God.22 Another explanation is that since man is made in God's image, the exposed body became an affront to the divine archetype in whose image he had been fashioned.23 Trypho's use of a non-rabbinic interpretation of a biblical verse is another consideration which militates against the conjecture of some Christian scholars that Trypho was to be identified with the renowned sage of the Talmud, Rabbi Tarfon.24 Justin knew that the messiah in Jewish tradition was a heroic, a victorious figure, that the advent of the messianic 20 Deuteronomy 27:26.

He himself quoted Micah 4: I-7 25 (it is paralleled in Isaiah 2: I-5), which gives us a vision of the golden age of the future, to be marked by the universal acknowledgement of God and adherence to His ways, and the replacement of a world order of violence with a world of peace, when "men will beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning hooks, when nation will not lift sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more." Justin was aware that for Jews there was a glaring contradic- tion between the realities of the world as they knew it and the conditions which for them constituted the criteria of messianic redemption. He had a ready answer: there were to be two advents of Christ, one in which he would suffer and die an ignominious death, the other when he would return in glory and when the golden age pictured by the prophet would be inaugurated. As Justin put it: "Two advents of His would take place, one in which He was pierced by you, and a second when ye will recognize Him whom you pierced, and all your tribes will lament, tribe over against tribe, the women alone and the men alone." 26 In another passage, speaking of Jews who raised the objection that the fate of Jesus and of the contemporary world belied the claim to his messiahship, Justin exclaimed: "most unreasonable men! For they do not understand ... that two advents of His have been announced: one in which He has been proclaimed as liable to suffering, and without glory, and without honour, and cruci- fied; and the second when He will come in glory from the heavens ...

His exegetical ingenuity was equal to the task. One of his proofs is PsalM 24. The entire Psalm is cited by Justin thus: "The Lord's is the earth and the fullness of it, the world and all who dwell in it. Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord, or who shall stand in His holy place ? One innocent in hands and pure in heart, who never bore his soul in vaniity, nor swore in craft to his neighbor. He shall receive blessing from the Lord, and mercy from God his Savior. This is the generation of such as seek the Lord, as seek the face of the God of Jacob.

Lift up your gates, ye rulers, and be ye lifted up ye everlasting gates, and the King of glory shall enter in. Who is this King of glory ? The Lord of Hosts, He is the King of glory." 29 The critical line in this psalm on which Justin pins his demonstration is the concluding one; Who is this King of glory ? The Lord of Hosts, He is the King of glory. Justin iden- tified "the King of glory" with Jesus. The scene where the questioning occurs, according to Justin, was in heaven. The attendants who were to welcome Jesus "when He rose from the dead and went up into heaven" must have had some diffi- culty recognizing him. This can only be explained by the fact that he came, in his first advent, without splendor, in the role of the sufferer. To use Justin's own words: "For when the rulers in heaven saw Him without form, and without honor and glory, they did not recognize Him, and were enquiring: Who is this King of glory ? And the Holy Spirit answered them 71(OCNTO7o XCot &amp;8040oo X'L &amp; 0oq xoa. a6TUpOU0svo xsx-puxlo, a ?UT?pa, ? t eJ 80 6 'r v op OV CO V O(p&amp;a oL, . &amp; O 7O'&amp; '. .

The manifestation of Jesus in all his glory, Justin explained, was reserved for his second advent. The interval between the two advents he was to spend sitting at "the right hand of the Father." 30 A psalm written hundreds of years before the rise of Christianity is here made to foretell the appearance of Jesus, his crucifixion and resurrection, and the Christian dogma of the two comings of Christ. There is, of course, nothing of all this in the words of the psalm itself; it is all supplied by the dogmatic zeal of the exegete in quest for support of his dogma. The psalm itself, as modern exegetes, Protestant and Catholic included, in agreement with the traditional Jewish exegesis acknowl- edge it, is a processional hymn, associated with the Temple liturgy. In the words of Robert C. Denton, in his notes on Psalms in The Oxford A nnotated Bible, this psalm is to be seen as "a litur- gy on entering the sanctuary, probably used in connection with a procession of the ark." Perhaps it was "sung by a Temple choir." It begins by acknowledging God as Creator, and then defines the requisite moral qualities to deem a person worthy of admittance to the Temple. The closing lines on which Justin centered his demnostration suggest to Dr. Denton that "the choir outside the gates presumably accompanied by the ark, now requests to be admitted." The King of glory, Professor Denton concludes, "means of the God of Israel, whose presence was associated with the ark (Numbers IO: 35-36)." 31 The Septuagint transla- tion prefaces this psalm with the statement that it was recited in the Temple liturgy the first day of the week; this is also the 30 36:6, 5.

Justin makes the claim that the Rabbis applied the term "the King of glory" to King Hezekiah or King Solomon. It is difficult to see on what he bases this. One Talmudic homily has King Solomon recite the psalm but the point made is to deny that King Solomon could have been guilty of the blasphemy in calling himself "King of glory." We cite the relevant passage in this homily: "After Solomon built the Temple he sought to bring the ark into the holy of holiest but the gates cleaved one to the other. Then Solomon intoned twenty-four prayers but he remained unanswered. Then he began to chant, Lift up your heads, 0 gates, lift them up, 0 everlasting doors and let the King of glory enter. The gates then rushed on him to swallow him alive. They asked him, Whom do you refer to as 'the King of glory'? He answered them, The Lord is mighty and powerful. He then repeated: Lift up your heads, 0 gates, lift them up, 0 everlasting doors that the King of glory shall enter in. Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, He is the King of glory, Selah. But his prayer was still unanswered. But as soon as he prayed, O Lord God, do not turn away the face of Your anointed, remember the good deeds of your servant David, he was immediately answered." 33 The point made by the Talmud, 32 In the Septuagint version this is Psalm 23.

The reticense shown by the rabbis in their appraisals of biblical heroes would have precluded designating a mortal king as "the King of glory", especially when this designation is also equated with "Lord of hosts." Justin was a great exponent of the typological interpretation of scripture. By discovering some parallelism in an earlier event to a later one, the earlier was judged a foreshadowing, an anticipation of the later. This fitted in readily with the quest for support in the Hebrew Bible for doctrinal claims of the Church. Where the Hebrew Bible did not yield direct confirmation, it was often rich in episodes that could be seen as types of the later events associated with the Christian version of salvation history. It was the hidden character of these truths which made them so elusive, with the result that only those open to wisdom could find them. The prophets, said Justin, spoke "in parables and types, so that it is not easy for most of what they taught to be grasped by all, for they concealed in it the truth in such a way that those who seek must take trouble to find out and to learn."34 And, Justin was ready to help those willing to learn by expounding these "parables and types," which he found abounding in the Hebrew Bible. We shall cite some of Justin's expositions in this aspect of his exegesis. Water and faith and wood (the ark) figure in the rescue of Noah, and the rescue of men from sin as mediated by Jesus is likewise effected by water (baptism) and faith and wood (the cross).3 The marriages of Jacob to Leah and Rachel were "types of the act that was to be completed by 34 Dial. 90: 2.

And Christ still serves for these, and for His servants that are in both." 36 The contrast between Leah and Rachel was especially important for Justin since Leah was of poor vision while Rachel was clear-eyed; this fitted in with the Christian notion that Jews were stricken with a blindness which made them unable to see the truth taught by their own Scripture. Justin put it thus: "For in the marriages of Jacob a kind of dispensation and prediction was performed, I would say, in order that you might rec- ognize even in them that your teachers have always looked not at all unto the more divine purposes for which each action took place, but rather unto what lies grovelling on the very ground, and to the lnatural passions of corruption ... Leah's eyes were weak, and, in truth, very weak are the eyes of your souls."37 In the Hebrew Bible the term Israel has a double connota- tion. It designates the patriarch Jacob as an individual, who received this name after wrestling with the mysterious stranger at the river of Jabbok, in the course of which "he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him." In giving him the new name this stranger said to him: "your name shall no longer be Jacob but Israel, for you have striven with beings divine and human and have prevailed" 38 (yisra from the 36 Dial.

Subsequently, the name Israel was applied to the descendants of Jacob, and thus came to designate the Jewish people. Christians appropriated for them- selves the name Israel, and now Justin sought to appropriate the name in its designation of an individual to Jesus himself; Jacob-Israel was a prefiguration of Jesus. The Christian tradition that the devil sought to tempt Jesus is here equated with Jacob's wrestling with the stranger, and his sufferings at the crucifixion is equated with the strain Jacob received in his hip. Here is Justin's exegesis to read the messiahship of Jesus into one of the earliest narratives in Genesis: "The name of Israel means this: A man overcoming power. For Isra is a 'man overcoming' and el is 'power'. And this it was prophesied Christ would do when He had become man, by the mystery of the wrestling in which Jacob wrestled with Him who appeared to him ... For when He had become man ... the devil came up to Him ... tempting Him, and striving to cast Him down ... But He overthrew him, and cast him down, rebuking him for being evil ... But since our Christ was also to grow numb, namely in toil and in the sense of suf- fering at the time that He was to be crucified, He proclaimed this also beforehand by touching Jacob's thigh and making it grow numb." Having thus appropriated the patriarch Jacob- Israel as a Christian forefather, as a foreshadower of Jesus, Justin was finally able to tell Trypho: "But you, though you have understood nothing of all this, nor make preparations for understanding, expect assuredly to be saved, since you are children of Jacob according to carnal descents. But that in this also you are deceiving yourselves, I have shown repeatedly. "39 Dial. I25:3-5.

When the Amalekite tribe struck at the Israelites during their journeying in the wilderness, we are told 40 that Moses directed his servant Joshua to lead the defense while he ascended a hill "with the rod of God" in his hand; he raised his hands, and "whenever Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed; and whenever he lowered his hand Amalek prevailed." To support his hands against weakening he seated himself on a stone, and his brother Aaron and his nephew Hur stood beside him supporting his hands. The meaning in this procedure is not clarified for us. The Midrash 41 explains that it served the Israelites as a sign, calling on them to be steadfast in faith. Josephus 42 appears to have taken the upraised hands as a gesture of prayer. The rod with which Moses performed the wonders in Egypt was to function again as the wonder working staff of deliverance. Justin offers an altogether different interpretation. Moses kept his hands upraised, thereby forming a sign of the cross. And Joshua was in command because the name Joshua in Greek is Jesus, and Jesus saves! Again Moses alluded to the sign of the cross when in blessing the tribes of Israel he said of Joseph: "Glorified among his brethren as first-born; as of a bull in his glory; his horns are the horns of a unicorn; with them shall he push nations together even at the very end of the earth." 43 The horns of the unicorn, Justin expounded, resemble in substance and form the figure of a cross.44 The XOcLt X 3OcXvv, X'Y Ocq O'rL 7Top6q e'6t, .

Whenever a rod or a tree figures in other early biblical episodes of a wondrous nature-all the wonders flowed from the fact tha-t the tree and the rod prefigured the cross.45 Typological exegesis has a certain liberty which is welcome to one seeking hidden allusions. But its very liberty makes it dangerous. It is dangerous not only because it permits distor- tions of texts but also because it invokes all the authority and so1emnity of hallowed texts as support to dubious theories or doctrines. Here is how Justin relates the rite of smearing the blood of the paschal offering on the eve of the exodus from Egypt with the crucifixion: "And they also that were saved in Egypt, when the first-born of the Egyptians perished, were rescued by the blood of the passover, which was smeared on either side of the posts and the upper lintel. For Christ was the passover, who was sacrificed later ... And it stands written that on the day of the passover you took Him and likewise at the passover you crucified Him. But as the blood of the passover saved them that were in Egypt, so also will the blood of Christ rescue from death them that have be- lieved.' 46 The Passover rite was performed in every Jewish household and by taking this as a "type" of the crucifixion every Jew was allegedly involved in the crucifixion. The Romans are cleared completely with one typological thrust- even beyond what the gospels have done. The historical facts have been banished altogether as a mythology has been 45 Dial. 86:i-6. 46 Dial. III :3.

In the Justinian interpretation, moreover, the crucifixion not only occurs on Passover, but is, typologically, made an integral part of the rites by which it is commemorated. Thus it helped extend the Christian mythology in which the use of blood, Christian blood, is somehow associated with the Jewish Passover. By a series of additional steps the blood libel was finally fabricated, alleging that Jewish rites call for the murder of a Christian in order to use his blood in the Passover celebration. For Justin Jesus was not confined to the historical figure who had appeared in the fist century. Jesus was for him a divine being, the second member of the trinity, the son of God, as he called him. And this, too, Justin undertook to prove from the Hebrew Bible. The Bible speaks frequently of God in anthropomorphic terms. It attributes to Him actions paralleling those of man. But God is not man. How can such statements then be made of God? The Rabbis dealt with this problem as most religious philosophers have done, by declaring all discourse about God in which He is conceived in human terms as analogical and metaphoric, as a language which must be understood figura- tively and not literally. Justin had a simpler solution. He posited a plurality of divine beings. The God who acts like man was another God, one who wears the robes of humanity. Citing such passages as God went u4 from A braham (Gen. I7: 22), The Lord spoke unto Moses (Exodus 6:29), and The Lord came down to see the tower which the children of men built (Gen. II: 5), Justin declared: "You should not consider that the unbegotten God has come down, or gone up, from anywhere. For the ineffable Father and Lord of all neither comes to any place, nor walks, nor sleeps, nor arises, but abides in His place, wherever that is, seeing acutely and hearing acutely, not with eyes nor ears, but with powers beyond all speech . . . Neither Abraham, therefore, nor Isaac, nor Jacob, nor any other man saw the Father ... but only Him who, in accordance with God's will is both God, His Son, and Angel ... Him whom</page><page sequence="23">JUSTIN MARTYR-BOKSER II9 He also willed to be born man through the Virgin." 47 All these arguments cited by Justin required a prior act of faith to invest them with any plausibility. Once a person believed that Jesus was God, that he was the promised messiah, that faith in him and rites relatee to faith in him- that these had superseded the traditional faith of Judaism, then he might follow Justin's interpretations. These inter- pretations were then in fact helpful-they appeared to resolve the contradictions between the Hebrew Bible and Christianity. Since Christianity insisted on legitimitizing itself by claiming that it was an authentic flowering of biblical Judaism, the type of apologetics represented by Justin was a crucial necessity. But Justin was aware that his arguments lacked the cogency of direct statement. In no instance did the Hebrew Bible declare directly what Christianity regarded primary. It all had to be established by inference, through allegorical and typological interpretation. Why were there no direct statements in the Bible to confirm the Christian claims ? Justin's answer was that indeed there had been, but he accused the Rabbis of having suppressed them. The most glaring of the deletions from the Bible alleged to have been made by the Rabbis was the phrase from a tree in Psalms 96:I0.48 Here is how the sentence reads: "Say among the nations, 'The Lord reigns'." The addition of the phrase from a tree would of course be a more explicit reference to Jesus, who despite his death on the cross, would be declared as still '7 Dial.

The same accusation is made by other Church Fathers. The editor of Justin's Dialogue, A. Lukyn Williams, describes the phrase from a tree as "doubtless a Christian interpolation." 49 No version of the Bible, Protestant or Catholic, includes this phrase. It was added to the text by a Christian apologist; the authentic text was then declared the forgery; and the Jews were accused of having committed the forgery. There was another problem which Justin recognized. If the law as practiced in Judaism was without efficacy, then why did the Bible prescribe it. For the early Christians the Hebrew Bible was also the word of God. If this law was ordained by God's word then how could Christians repudiate it ? Justin's answer is reminiscent in part of the disparagement of the law in the New Testament, 50 but it is more extreme. The law, according to Justin, was given to the Jews because they are an especially unspiritual race, hard-hearted, rebel- lious and ungodly and the law was, therefore, given them as a means of mitigating some of these offensive qualities and endowing them with some consciousness of God. For the gentiles it was enough to prescribe two commandments, as Jesus did, the love of God and the love of man. Whoever pursues these two loves would surely be righteous. But this could not suffice for the Jews. "But as for you," Justin cried out triumphantly to Trypho, "you have never shown yourselves as possessing friendship or love, either towards God, or towards the prophets, or towards one another, but, as is plain, are found to be always idolators and murderers of the right- eous,so that you even laid your hands upon Christ Himself, and still stay on in your wickedness, cursing even those who prove that He who was crucified by you is the Christ."'" 49 Justin the Martyr, pp. I53f, note 3. 50 Cf.

They were all ordained because of the morally degenerate nature of the Jewish people. They are all a token of God's displeasure with the Jews. The Bible sometimes reprimanded the Jews for not keeping the commandments because, Justin added, they were a sinful people who needed them to help overcome their sinful disposition.52 In the words of Justin: "As at first He gave you these commands because of your wickedness, in the same way, because of your persistence, or rather your intensity in them, by means of the same commands He calls you to remember and to know Him. But you are a people hard of heart, and without understanding, and blind and lame." 53 Especially the rite of circumcision was seen as a token of God's harshness toward the Jews: it was a means of keeping them apart from other nations and thereby to bring on them the odium of mankind. Circumcision was ordained, declared Justin, "for a sign that you should be separated from the other nations and us, and that ye alone should suffer the things you are rightly suffering now, and that your lands should be desolate and your cities burned with fire ... and none of you go up unto Jerusalem."54 Even the fact that circumcision is performed by an iron instrument was for Justin a token of sinister judgment against the Jews, it is an indication that they remain insensitive, unfeeling, that "they are hard of heart."55 LZpt OC 170 '70 Z ? pta70 Toc ZSLpOC S?MPOCXSM U'Vi XOC' V.Ept V5 sMV?Ls'vscv '7n xocxbj U'VAV, XOCrocp(,)V?E90&amp; xjsoct '763oc?7v &gt;c0, saT6cUpo vev ? vs Uv UV.COV &amp;o'7CL&amp;Xv6vt@ GFV VCL TOV XpLatov. 52 Dial. i8-22. 53 Dial. 27:4.

But all these were only subsidiary arguments. The basic interpretation which Justin invokes is the denigration of Jewish people. The law is turned into a token of their inferiority. The divine election of the Jewish people is turned into a condemnation, into a mark of depravity rather than of privilege. Justin turned the cali sounded so often in the Hebrew Bible for religious inwardness and caution against the insincere performance of ritual into an indictment of Jewish ritual as such, and an indication that it was to be abandolied as a thing of evil.56 To be continued. 56 Dial. 15, I6: I-2.</page></plain_text>
