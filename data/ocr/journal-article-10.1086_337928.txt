               <p>What good is a view of the ocean unless one views it every day for many, many days out of the corner of one’s eye—while hanging clothes, setting the table, picking up toys from the porch? Who can tell what a house is like unless one lives in it, knows its middle‐of‐the‐night creaks, becomes familiar with the geometric patterns made by doors, window frames, light coming through drawn bedroom shades?</p>

         <p>In the above quotation from <italic>Ruthie,</italic> the narrator articulates a kind of epistemology of the home; she interprets her being in the world through domestic ritual and the language of the everyday. From the reverse perspective, the “standpoint of a philosophy of literature and poetry,” Gaston Bachelard and Pierre Bourdieu invoke literary practice to interpret the significance of houses. Bachelard speaks of writing a room or reading a house (1994, 14), while Bourdieu refers to the house as a book in which is inscribed a vision and structure of society and the world (quoted in Carsten and Hugh‐Jones 1995, 2). As literary critics engaged in the study of the English domestic novel, we find ourselves attempting to untangle this reciprocal invocation of home and novel with particular attention to the way in which it is often tacitly gendered. In the following discussion, we offer a brief recapitulation of the interactive relationship between the home and the literary text by summarizing both the historic evolution of this symbiosis and the different ways in which analogues of structure and significance and content have been constructed.</p>
         <p>The house—and architecture—have served as foundational, powerful, and recurring analogues throughout the history of literary interpretation: thus, Walter Pater proposes the term <italic>literary architecture</italic> (1903, 20), Henry James his <italic>house of fiction</italic> (1934, 46), Gaston Bachelard the <italic>poetics of space</italic> (1994), and Edith Wharton her <italic>House of Mirth</italic> ([1905] 1987). In <italic>Literary Architecture,</italic> Ellen Eve Frank outlines how this habit of comparison between architecture and literature extends from Plato to Samuel Beckett and discovers particular expression in the late nineteenth and on to the twentieth century (1979, 9). In her analogical model, Philippa Tristram focuses on the eighteenth century, equating the rise of the novel with the great age of the English house: “From the beginning the house and the novel are interconnected, for the eighteenth century, which saw the rise of the novel, was also the great age of the English house. Because the novel is invincibly domestic, it can tell us much about the space we live in; equally, designs for houses and their furnishings can reveal hidden aspects of the novelist’s art. It is no accident that many of the terms used in critical discourse—<italic>structure, aspect, outlook,</italic> even <italic>character</italic>—are related to domestic architecture” (1989, 2). To Tristram’s list of reciprocal terms one could add <italic>content</italic> (contents of the house, content of the novel), <italic>liminal, threshold, entry point, style, perspective, kitchen sink drama, aga sagas, country house mysteries,</italic> and <italic>the domestic novel.</italic>1</p>
         <p>The rise of this new genre also coincides with the emergence of an aspiring bourgeoisie in the eighteenth century or earlier and with the increasing domesticization, feminization, and privatization of society. The middle‐class household is indeed the stuff of fiction; when John Lukacs observes that “domesticity, privacy, comfort, the concept of home and of the family … are … principal achievements of the Bourgeois age” (1970, 616), he could well be referring to the subject matter in novels by Jane Austen, Elizabeth Gaskell, and George Eliot.</p>
         <p>The comparatively recent notion of privacy resonates in this new literary form that explores intimate, private spaces of the mind and society often set within a middle‐class household and home: “The concept of home as a private retreat first emerged in the lives of bourgeois families in eighteenth‐century France and England, and in the United States among urban, middle‐class families in the early part of the nineteenth century. Its development was closely linked to the new ideals of domesticity and privacy that were associated with the characteristics of the modern family—a family that was child‐centered, private, and in which the roles of husband and wife were segregated into public and domestic spheres, respectively” (Hareven 1991, 258).</p>
         <p>Furthermore, Witold Rybczynski notes that the evolution of domestic comfort must be understood in the context of something new in human consciousness: “the appearance of the internal world of the individual, of the self, and of the family” in which the house is appreciated as a “setting for an emerging interior life” (1986, 35–36). In his phenomenological approach to intimacy, Bachelard suggests that “the house image would appear to have become the topography of our intimate being” (1994, xxxii). By associating houses with childhood, dreaming, and memory, he adds depth to Rybczynski’s perspective and emphasizes the significance of dwelling places in the evolution of a literary imagination. Our imagination, our consciousness, needs to locate itself in a particular space, to find a home, to articulate its homelessness, its longing for home, its sickness for home (nostalgia). Thus, novels <italic>and</italic> houses furnish a dwelling place—a spatial construct—that invites the exploration and expression of private and intimate relations and thoughts. For writers like Virginia Woolf and Katherine Mansfield, the use of private domestic space as frame and metonym of inner, psychological space reflects this recent validation of privacy and intimacy. Thus, Woolf expresses the exhilaration she felt at the “transition from tyranny to freedom” that followed the death of her father by contrasting the intricate patterns of Morris wallpaper and the red plush and black paint of the paternal home with the washes of plain distemper and white and green chintzes in the new house in Gordon Square where she moved with her siblings (Wilson [1987] 1988, 42). Here, in the bohemian atmosphere of Bloomsbury, newly acquired privacy and freedom are figured in physical terms: “To begin with it was astonishing to stand at the drawing room window and look into all those trees … instead of looking at old Mrs. Redgrave washing her neck across the way. The light and the air after the rich red gloom of Hyde Park Gate were a revelation” (quoted in Schulkind 1976, 162–63).</p>
         <p>In <italic>To the Lighthouse</italic> (Woolf 1927), we enter into the Ramsay children’s consciousness by entering their nursery. Similarly, at the end of part 1, the end of a long day in the Ramsay summer house, we move into the drawing room with Mrs. Ramsay as she joins her husband and thus into the intimacy of their marriage. In modern and contemporary novels, spatial interiority is mirrored in the interiority of the minds and thoughts of women, children, servants, those dwellers within the house who may appear to be at home in this space, although even this domestic space is designed and controlled by the patriarchy.</p>
         <p>The proliferation of novels and tales named after houses, from <italic>Northanger Abbey</italic> (Austen [1817] 1975) to <italic>The House on Mango Street</italic> (Cisneros [1983] 1991), indicates an insistent historical reciprocity. In both canonical and popular novels, the house goes beyond providing a mere setting to constitute “a unifying symbolic structure that represents and defines the relationship of the central characters to one another, to themselves, to the world” (Chandler 1991, 1). For, as Akiko Busch observes, there is an essential connection between arranging words and designing places in that “both are ways of finding those arrangements with which we can live” (1999, 25). Novels and houses endeavor to make sense of the world, to construct ways of being at home in a world from which we feel estranged (Vidler 1996, 7–8). Moreover, the exterior façade and style along with the interior decoration, furniture, style, and layout of houses compose a semiotic system that signals status, class, and public display and creates meanings that observers, visitors, and the public may interpret and read; as Dolores Hayden notes, “vernacular house forms are aesthetic essays on the meaning of life within a particular culture” (quoted in Chandler 1991, 12). Similarly, readers interpret the novel’s meaning through its system of signs: its layout and style, its use of symbols, and its exterior façade—book cover, design, and blurbs. Thus, our responses to houses and texts can be seen as comparable, perhaps even interchangeable, interpretive acts.</p>
         <p>Inevitably, the spaces of domesticity and of fiction shape the people who inhabit them; conversely, people and characters create and shape the spaces they inhabit. Structurally and symbolically, houses and novels store and restore memories; “by remembering ‘houses’ and ‘rooms’ [and stories, we might add], we learn to abide within ourselves” (Bachelard 1994, xxxvii). These spatial constructs not only compose and record our past but also set out a grid for our current and future lives and understanding.</p>
         <p>The home, as Linda McDowell points out in this forum, resonates with nationhood, and home is linked to femininity in the social construction of the nation‐state. In discussing the Algerian writer, Assia Djebar, Victoria Best suggests here that part of the process of self‐determination for a postcolonial nation and for women within that nation is a mental reconception of their domestic space. If, as Hermann Muthesius (1979) claims in his study of English houses, the love of such (country) houses is a sign of the race, implying traditions, inheritance, and continuity over generations, then one understands the centrality of <italic>Mansfield Park</italic> (Austen [1814] 1998) or even <italic>Bleak House</italic> (Dickens 1853) as emblematic of Englishness and nation. The manor house, the country seat, the vicarage, the London residence, with symbolic <italic>names</italic> signifying social status and genealogy or, equally, aspirations to social status, are as easily recognizable signs of one’s place in English society as terrace, row, or boarding house. The disturbed spaces of Brideshead, Howard’s End, and Manderley evoke the twilight of empire, a nostalgia for fading nationhood, class privilege, and imperial power—a demasculinization both personal (Sebastian, Mr. Wilcox, Maxim) and national. As in the novels of Jean Rhys or Laura Talbot, boarding houses, a structural representation of the decline of great houses and the upper classes and of a more urban, mobile society, shelter figures on the margins of society, single, impoverished, and genteel, who must work for a living and live “in digs.” In contrast, American literature projects a tension between “the project of building and settlement and the romantic image of the homeless, rootless, nomadic hero” (Chandler 1991, 4). In modern American novels, we encounter nomadic heroines and diverse and unconventional spaces. Here one thinks of <italic>My Antonia</italic> (Cather 1918) and <italic>The Great Gatsby</italic> (Fitzgerald 1925), but also of <italic>Huckleberry Finn</italic> (Twain [1884] 1918), <italic>On the Road</italic> (Kerouac 1957), and <italic>Housekeeping</italic> (Robinson 1997).</p>
         <p>Carl Jung conceptualized domestic structures, both architectural and literary, as possible fruitful replications or images of mental structures, offering grounds, as Bachelard wrote, for “taking the house as a <italic>tool for analysis</italic> of the human soul” (Bachelard 1994, xxxvii). Not surprisingly, therefore, literary houses and their spaces constitute archetypes of the psyche. In Edgar Allan Poe’s uncanny story, “The Fall of the House of Usher” (1839), the gloomy, menacing, decaying House of Usher symbolizes the madness of the narrator and Roderick Usher, while Charlotte Brontë’s mad Bertha is locked up in the forbidden space of an attic in <italic>Jane Eyre</italic> ([1846] 1981). Sigmund Freud’s investigation of the German word <italic>unheimlich</italic> led to his discovery of the coincidence of homely and unhomely, his elaboration of the sinister transformation of the familiar into the unfamiliar, and the return of the repressed through the unhomely, the uncanny. This insight into the disturbing slipperiness of the familiar is particularly useful in understanding the role of those uncanny sites—cellars, dungeons, attics, overgrown gardens—that are so ubiquitous in the Gothic novel, a genre haunted by the specter of father‐daughter incest, which flourished precisely during the time that saw the emergence of the nuclear family with its attendant intimacy and privacy.</p>
         <p>In another archetypal iteration, houses also represent the human body itself or its extensions: “House, body and mind are in continuous interaction, the physical structure, furnishing, social conventions and mental images of the house at once enabling, moulding, informing and constraining the activities and ideas which unfold within its bounds” (Carsten and Hugh‐Jones 1995, 2). If the description of Fanny Price’s room as “a nest of comforts” (Austen [1814] 1998, 107) leaves no doubt about Fanny’s redeeming influence over Mansfield Park, in <italic>Lady Audley’s Secret,</italic> the vulnerability of Audley Court is prefigured in the description of “a house in which no one room had any sympathy with another” (Braddon [1861–62] 1987, 2). To ignore the heavy‐lidded visage of Osmond’s forbidding dwelling in Bellosguardo will prove disastrous to Isabel Archer in <italic>The Portrait of a Lady</italic> (James [1881] 1917), for that house <italic>is</italic> Osmond, whereas, in <italic>Our Mutual Friend</italic> ([1864–65] 1959), Charles Dickens pushes the symbiotic exchange between the characters and the spaces they inhabit to such a degree that furniture and people cannot be told apart.</p>
         <p>But domestic space implies more than houses and gardens (or the liminal spaces of garden gate, doorstep, porch, garage) and their archetypic, Freudian, anthropomorphic, or ontological significance. Domestic space implies the everyday, the rituals of domesticity in their cyclical, repetitive ordinariness. While as feminists we often found ourselves critiquing the oppressiveness of the house in the construction of feminine subjectivity (Geyh 1993, 32), we also need in our rethinking of domestic spaces and the domestic novel not only to scrutinize woman’s contested, problematized, and central place in the house but also to “discover more about the place of home in the woman” (Light 1991, 219). In our own (Mezei and Briganti, forthcoming) research on noncanonical women writers, paying attention to the place of home in the woman and examining this interactive and complex relationship has given us a method to rediscover and reevaluate novelists such as E. H. Young, F. M. Mayor, and E. M. Delafield, who had fallen into oblivion.</p>
         <p>Writing about American women novelists, Ann Romines has argued that “some of the best fiction by American women writers is dominated and shaped by the rhythms and stresses of domestic ritual, by the complex of domestic‐literary concerns I have called the home plot” (1992, 9). Romines recalls theologian Kathryn Allen Rabuzzi’s claim that housework as ritual enactment “makes the individual a player in a scene far older and larger than her individual self. No longer does she participate in profane historical time; instead, she is participating in mythic time” (quoted in Romines 1992, 96). The opening quotation from <italic>Ruthie</italic> shows the narrator not condemned to a life of endless repetition but, rather, appropriating domestic ritual—hanging the laundry, setting the table—to frame her understanding and her being in the world.</p>
         <p>Although a domestic perspective has excluded writers from the canon, it has also liberated them from the constraints of high culture and at times reoriented the canon. In writing from a domestic space of house, household, and family, women writers can create a position in the field of cultural production from which to value ordinary women’s lives, the quotidian, the minute. By writing about and through domestic ritual and the domestic sphere, and by their attentiveness to the minute, women writers across cultures bestow literary value on domesticity and domestic space; such discourses of femininity (Giles 1995) view the world, the family, and the house from inside the domestic sphere through housework, housekeeping, cooking, cleaning, and decorating, thereby imposing order on the disorder of living. As a fiction of subversion and opposition, the figure of the drifter in Marilynne Robinson’s <italic>Housekeeping</italic> (1997) holds immediate appeal for feminism. However, we must be aware that romanticizing opposition will blind us to the fact that the domestic world of ordinary life holds as much significance as the world of extraordinary adventure and perpetuates a binary and essentialist way of thinking. Apropos of rethinking and revalidating the domestic, Cheryl Mendelson in her recent, controversial tome, <italic>Home Comforts: The Art and Science of Keeping House</italic> (1999), describes her passion for domesticity in terms that echo the genre of domestic novel from Jane Austen to the British aga sagas and family sagas of the 1980s and 1990s (Joanna Trollope, Mary Wesley, Elizabeth Jane Howard), to the recent Canadian prize‐winning <italic>A Good House</italic> by Bonnie Burnard: “It is your housekeeping that makes your home alive, that turns it into a small society in its own right, a vital place with its own ways and rhythms, the place where you can be more yourself than you can be anywhere else” (1999, 7). With characteristic irony, these domestic novels and other contemporary novels by Anita Brookner, Margaret Drabble, Fay Weldon, and Doris Lessing also show how the home, rather than being “the place where you can be more yourself than you can be anywhere else,” entraps and stifles women. These novelists have not forgotten the bitterness with which an earlier generation of women assessed the cost of domesticity. When, in Vita Sackville‐West’s <italic>All Passion Spent</italic> ([1931] 1986), the octogenarian Lady Slane surveys her marriage, the death of her dreams of an artistic life is expressed most poignantly in the description of her trousseau: “table‐cloths, dinner napkins, towels (hand and bath), tea‐cloths, kitchen rubbers, pantry cloths, dusters, and, of course, sheets, which when displayed proved to be double, and all embroidered with a monogram, not at first sight decipherable, but which on closer inspection Deborah disentangled into the letters D.H. After that she was lost.” If Lady Slane is lost “into the foam and billows of silks, satins, poplins, and alpacas,” other women have had less luxurious trappings (1986, 157).</p>
         <p>Since domestic space and the novel have paradoxically constrained and liberated women’s ways of knowing, writing, and being, the encoding and decoding of house and novel and domesticity as the sphere of women are integral to an understanding of this symbiosis. At the same time, while recognizing the validity, power, and creative potential of domesticity in women’s lives and in our literature, we must be cautious about assuming “an inherent link between ways of knowing the world and the domestic patterns that shape and reflect those ways” (Cooperman 1999, 9) and must refuse the unexamined yoking of domesticity and femininity. Equally, the term <italic>domesticate</italic> has been appropriated by postcolonial discourse to critique the prohibitions against women’s agency imposed by nationalist ideologies as well as by colonial presumptions about gender (Visweswaran 1996, 86). We, therefore, need not only to understand the implications and limitations of the concepts surrounding <italic>domestication</italic> but also to overcome them. We should shift the paradigm of the domestic so as to defamiliarize it, to rethink its politics, to tease out its rich range of possibilities, for, as Rachel Bowlby has remarked, “domestication … is not so much a firmly fixed, univocal concept in the first place. And feminism, with its inherently undomesticated place—neither a home nor away from home—is uniquely placed to engage in productive forms of domestic deconstruction” (1995, 89). In drawing us into a fictional world through a domestic perspective, writers across different classes and ethnicities subtly deconstruct myths of domestic bliss while validating and reconstructing the everyday, the domestic, the ordinary. Accordingly, the following discussions offer us just such productive forms of domestic deconstruction from different disciplinary perspectives.</p>
