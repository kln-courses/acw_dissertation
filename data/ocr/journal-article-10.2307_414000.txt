[Received 27 July 1983.] Orality and literacy: The technologizing of the word. By WALTER J. ONG, S.J. London &amp; New York: Methuen, 1982. Pp. xi, 201. Reviewed by ROBERT A. HALL JR., Cornell University It has long been a commonplace among linguists that speech antedated writ- ing, in the history of the human race, by many thousands of years.' The im- plications of this basic fact have, however, remained largely unrecognized, especially among historians of literature and 'culture' (in the narrow sense). Father Ong's book is one of the first treatments of the relation between culture and literacy to give an over-all view of the differences in culture-and, indeed, in Weltanschauung-which stem from the absence or presence of writing. In Chap. 1, 'The orality of language' (5-15), O expatiates on why 'the sci- entific and literary study of language and literature has for centuries ... shied away from orality' (8), a situation which he ascribes to 'the scholarly focus on texts' (10). He distinguishes 'primary' orality, that of a culture 'totally un- touched by any knowledge of writing or print', from 'the secondary orality prevailing in present-day high-technology culture, in which a new orality is sustained by telephone, radio, television, and other electronic devices that depend for their existence and functioning on writing and print' (11). Over five pages (10-15) are devoted to 'oral literature' and its importance as a manifes- tation of oral culture. O disapproves of the term ORAL LITERATURE, which he regards as an oxymoron; he prefers either EPOS or circumlocutions such as 'purely oral art forms' or 'verbal art forms' (14). He recognizes the high artistic and human worth of 'the powerful and beautiful verbal performances produced by oral cultures' (14), but believes that even fuller potentials can be realized only with the use of writing, 'a vast complex of powers forever inaccessible without literacy' (15). Chap. 2, 'The modern discovery of primary oral cultures' (16-30), is a brief summary of Dogmengeschichte, concentrating chiefly on the history of the Homeric question, especially Milman Parry's pioneer studies on the Yugoslav oral epic in relation to the Iliad and the Odyssey (17-27), plus 'Consequent and related work' (27-30). The misguided and unproved assertions to the contrary by Derrida (1967a,b, 1972, 1975 etc.) and his 'deconstructionist' followers rest on a semantic wrenching of the term WRITING (ecriture) to refer to any kind of sign, linguistic or non-linguistic. REVIEWS 625</page><page sequence="2">LANGUAGE, VOLUME 60, NUMBER 3 (1984) 'Some psychodynamics of orality' is the topic of Chap. 3 (31-77). O em- phasizes the fleeting nature of sound,2 which gives a spoken utterance the character of an event (cf. Hebrew dabar 'word, event') and causes oral peoples to ascribe magical potency to words (31-3). Utterances, to be recalled, must be entrusted to memory, which is best aided by rhythmic, formulaic discourse. As O says (35), 'the more sophisticated orally patterned thought is, the more it is likely to be marked by set expressions skilfully used.' Further character- istics of orally based thought and expression are, according to O, that it is additive rather than subordinative (37-8); aggregative rather than analytic (38- 9); and redundant, characterized by the ancient rhetoricians as copia-en- couraging fluency, fulsomeness, volubility. Oral cultures are conservative or traditionalist (41-2), close to the human life-world (42-3), agonistically toned (43-5), empathetic and participatory rather than objectively distanced (45-6), homeostatic (46-9), and situational rather than abstract (49-57). Oral memo- rization (57-69) differs significantly from textual memory (i.e. that based on written or printed material) in ranging from the 'fixed' to the 'flexible' use of formulaic elements-depending on several factors, especially the non-verbal context in which the oral word is used (67-8). For O, these aspects of orality are related to 'verbomotor life-style' and to 'personality structures that in certain ways are more communal and external- ized, and less introspective than those common among literates' (68-9). Oral narrative works most effectively with "'heavy" characters, persons whose deeds are monumental, memorable and commonly public' (70). In oral cultures, sound is perceived by humans as 'unifying, centralizing, interiorizing' (73), and therefore consonant with conservative holism, situational thinking, and 'a cer- tain humanistic organization of knowledge around the action of human and anthropomorphic beings, interiorized persons, rather than around impersonal things' (74). O rightly emphasizes that words are not signs (75-7); their written representations are indeed signs, but only because this term refers 'primarily to something visually apprehended' (76). O establishes a major distinction between two types of visual signs repre- senting human language: the handwritten (manuscript or chirographic) and the printed or typographic. His Chap. 4, 'Writing restructures consciousness' (78- 116), treats the basic differences between orality and literacy, and the changes which O considers that writing introduces into our awareness of ourselves and the world around us. Writing established 'a new world of autonomous dis- course' (78-9), removing the text from the living human life-world-but par- adoxically assuring its endurance, and hence its potential for reaching not only contemporary but a (theoretically) infinite number of readers in later genera- tions (79-81). Writing is a technology (81-3), completely artificial; it therefore does not 'inevitably well up out of the unconscious' (82). Instead of being 2 Formulated, e.g., in the Latin hexameter Littera scripta manet; nescit vox missa reverti 'The written letter remains; the sound, once sent forth, cannot return' (a mediaeval adaptation of Horace, Ars poetica 390). 626</page><page sequence="3">learned informally and outside of awareness, writing is learned relatively late,3 and is performed in complete awareness. A longish discussion of the nature of script (83-5) and of the different kinds of writing (85-93) leads to an analysis of the initial effects of the onset of literacy (93-6). O cites instances from many cultures of the long-term persistence of oral habits (what he terms 'residual orality') in the transition from memory to written records (96-101). The inevitable differences between written texts and oral utterances are treated in 'Some dynamics of textuality' (101-3), including the isolation of the writer and of the text he produces, and the fictionalizing of the reader. Writing enables both writer and reader to perform 'backward scanning' and hence to be analytical (104), as well as increasingly introspective in an analytical way (105). Immensely wider lexical resources are made available by establishing standard languages, whose vocabularies can include hundreds of thousands of words (106-8). (But, we may add, no single speaker of such a language ever has complete active control of the entire lexicon of such a 'grapholect', to use Haugen's term.) O identifies two special major developments in the West which derive from and affect the interaction of writing and orality: academic rhetoric (108-12) and learned languages, especially Latin (112-15).4 'Print, space, and closure' are the topics of Chap. 5 (117-38). The devel- opment of movable type on the basis of the separate units of the alphabet furnished, O suggests, the basis for a shift from sound to visual space ('Hearing- dominance yields to sight-dominance', 112-23). Among the effects of print 'embedding' the word in space are the development of indexes (123-36); the treatment of a book as a kind of object containing 'information', rather than as a recorded utterance (126); the exact reproduction of drawings, maps etc. (126-8); and the accordance to typographic space, as such, of a significance in certain kinds of visually oriented literature (128-9). Among the more diffuse effects (130-32) of print, 0 lists the decline of rhetoric and the quan- tification of knowledge through diagrams and charts; the development of exhaustive dictionaries and the desire to legislate 'correctness' in language; and a sense of and need for privacy in reading and learning. 'Print encourages a sort of closure, a sense that what is found in a text has been finalized, has reached a state of completion' (132), thus making for 'more tightly closed verbal art forms, especially in narrative' (133). Print-culture, tending to 'feel a work as closed, set off from other works, a unit in itself', gave birth to the romantic notions of originality and creativity. 0 interprets recent literary critics' emphasis on 'intertextuality' as a reaction against 'the isolationist aesthetics of a romantic print-culture' (133-4); but intertextuality in the broadest sense, he con- siders, was taken for granted in manuscript-culture and even more so in oral culture.5 We are now at a point, says 0, where print-culture is itself being replaced by electronic tech- nology, bringing us into an age of 'secondary orality' (135-8). This new orality is in some ways like the old, but is 'essentially a more deliberate and self-conscious orality, based permanently on the use of writing and print' (136). Secondary orality generates a strong group-sense, but one based on groups 'immeasurably larger than those of primary oral culture'-McLuhan's 'global culture'- 3 Usually, in our culture, from the age of five or six onward. There are very few persons who cannot remember learning to read and write (this reviewer is one). 4 Here we have an example of both the insufficiencies and the advantages of writing: does learned, in O's usage here, stand for /larnd/ or /l6rned/? In this particular context, it could stand for either- or, perhaps, we should take it as representing both at the same time (something which is impossible in speech). 5 From this point of view, those modern literary critics who think they have discovered inter- textuality are simply 're-inventing the wheel' of literary and cultural history, just as practitioners of exclusively synchronic linguistic description have had to rediscover language-history, including analogy and sound-change. REVIEWS 627</page><page sequence="4">LANGUAGE, VOLUME 60, NUMBER 3 (1984) with the result that oratory is very different (especially over television) from what it was in primary orality (136-8). In verbal art, the shift from orality to literacy has had far-reaching effects in many genres, as O points out in Chap. 6 ('Oral memory, the story line, and characterization', 139-55). Among its effects are, in narrative, a shift from portrayal of a situation (into which the oral poet plunges his hearer in medias res) to a lengthy climactic linear plot: 'strict plot for lengthy narrative comes with writing' (144), and 'bardic objectives are not framed in the light of a tight over-all plot' (146).6 This latter kind of plot is typically 'pyramidal' in structure, and reaches its peak in the detective-story (147-51). Writing and reading, being essentially solo activities, cause 'flat, heavy' characters to yield to 'round' ones, with a more complex character-structure and motivation (151-5). The possibility of such treatment further restructures, O suggests, our entire ap- proach to the analysis of psychology and culture. The new technologies of the word 'do not merely store what we know. They style what we know in ways which made it quite inaccessible and indeed unthinkable in an oral culture' (155). In a final chapter, 'Some theorems' (156-79), O suggests still further inter- esting perspectives, insights, and problems. These are chiefly related to the study of literature (157-74), but also to anthropology and our concept of 'prim- itive' culture (174-5); to the relation between 'media' and true human com- munication (175-7)-of which O observes, 'Communication is intersubjective. The media model is not' (177); and to individual consciousness and the religious traditions of mankind (178-9). A full bibliography (180-95) is followed by an index (196-208). The foregoing brief outline can give only a summary indication of the fullness of O's discussion and argumentation, with rich exemplification at every point, drawn from linguistics, literature, folk-lore and myth. It casts much light on many aspects of human behavior with regard to the relation not only between auditory and visual perception of language, but also between different ways in which this latter is brought about. Technology is a far more important factor in the development of intellectual and artistic activity than is usually thought.7 Handwritten material remains much closer to basic orality, for both the writer and the reader, than does that which is printed, simply because of the rate at which it is set down on the page and read. Print favors 'rapid reading', because the reader can skip from one high point to another, and extrapolate therefrom 6 Shippey 1983 (ch. 4) points out that J. R. R. Tolkien, in The Lord of the Rings, followed a 'cartographic plot', i.e. one based on a very detailed and carefully planned geography, and that Tolkien made extensive use of 'interlacements' in the plot (ch. 5; cf. also West 1975). Tolkien's cartography was definitely a product of print-culture; but the use of interlacement goes back to chirographic times, since it was developed along with writing. In Romance, it is not at all present in the epic, but begins to appear in the verse romance (e.g. in Chrestien de Troyes' Erec, mid- 12th century); and it is wide-spread in the prose romances, starting in the early 13th century (Alice M. Colby-Hall, p.c.). 7 For discussion of the importance of technology in the history of music, for instance, see Tovey (1956:72-84, 'Instrumentation'). 628</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS to what must have come in between. Mechanical reproduction of a written text, e.g. by xeroxing, diminishes a reader's participation even more. A person who has copied a text by hand or even by typewriter usually retains far more of what he or she has written down than does one who has merely placed it face down on a copying-machine. O's distinctions have a direct bearing on our divisions of intellectual history. Paden 1983 has proposed, largely on the basis of O's and others' discussions of orality, that we should regard the 'Middle Ages' as essentially a period in which literacy, after being lost, was gradually recovered at varying times and in varying genres, and was practised in the different Romance vernaculars as their divergence from Latin became so pronounced as to require an independent orthography. The Ongian approach also aids us in resolving certain problems that have needlessly bothered literary critics, e.g. with regard to J. R. R. Tolk- ien's The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion. These must be understood as an effort of 'sub-creative' imagination (to use Tolkien's term), growing out of his life-long concern with works transmitted by chirographic tradition and needing philological understanding and interpretation.8 A few disagreements can be mentioned. P. 5: Was Saussure really 'the father of modern lin- guistics'? It depends on what we call 'modern' and 'linguistics', but one could name a whole series of 19th and even 18th century scholars (from Sir William Jones onward) with an equally good claim to the title of 'father' of one kind of linguistics or another. In general, 0 relies too much on Sampson 1980 as a guide to the history of linguistics. P. 7: The saying that 'one picture is worth a thousand words' is of course true, but only with regard to emotional impact. As 0 says, the thousand words are needed for context; without ex- tensive verbal explanation, pictures can be very misleading. This is one of the major objections to primarily visual media of communication like television. P. 8: 'A simply oral dialect will commonly have resources of only a few thousand words': no, far larger vocabularies have been recorded for a number of 'purely oral' languages; cf. Laughlin 1975. Pp. 11-14: Here and elsewhere, 0 manifests an unfortunate insistence on the etymological in- terpretation of terms, as in his objection to the expression ORAL LITERATURE. As a technical term, LITERATURE can perfectly well be redefined to mean, say, 'memorable discourse' (cf. Hall 1979:94), without reference to its being oral or written. Likewise, there is no point in objecting to TEXT used to refer to oral performance (13, 33 ['an oral culture has no texts']), if we simply define the term as referring to any discourse, written or not. The meaning of a word does not necessarily include any survival of an earlier meaning. The ordinary modern user of the word glamo(u)r has no way of knowing or caring that '"glamor" girls are really "grammar girls"' (93), and no 'reality' is involved here. A word means what its users, as a group, make it mean at any given time, and nothing more. These, however, are very minor cavils. Ong's book is fundamental for our understanding of the relation between language and writing, and will have to be taken into account in all future work. REFERENCES DERRIDA, JACQUES. 1967a.

Reviewed by SUSAN GAL, Rutgers University This book is further evidence of the growing interest in social psychological approaches to language. A collection of review articles on language attitudes, it is narrower in both focus and approach than some previous volumes in this area. It centers on 'speaker-evaluation research' and on developing adequate explanations for the results of such studies. Ryan &amp; Giles say that their 'em- phasis is on the individual and his/her display of attitudes towards ingroup and outgroup members as elicited by language' (p. 2), mostly in a controlled setting. Thus for scholars who would analyse the evaluation of speakers and varieties in other terms-e.g. as part of cultural symbol systems, or as ambiguous and often negotiated in the course of interactions, or as background knowledge in conversational inference (or, alternatively, as relatively unimportant in them- selves, compared to social-structural effects on language behavior)-this book will be of considerably less interest than the excellent Scherer &amp; Giles 1979, which took a broader view of some of the same issues. Nevertheless, within its limits the present book provides a unified picture of the current direction of research on language attitudes. Although questionnaires and content analysis of historical and mass-media materials are discussed by some of the contributors, R&amp;G note that the speaker- evaluation methodology holds center stage in the social-psychological and com- munication tradition represented by this book. These studies are variants of the well-known 'matched-guise' technique introduced by Lambert et al. 1960. Respondents fill out rating scales, judging the contrasting linguistic varieties they hear on tape. The evaluations are taken to be attitudes not just toward the language forms themselves, but also toward the speakers of these varieties, 630</page></plain_text>
