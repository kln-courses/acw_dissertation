<plain_text><page sequence="1">Diane H. Campbell A Darker Place: Helen Hoover's The Years of the Forest Helen Hoover's The Long-Shadowed Forest , The Gift of the Deer, A Place in the Woods , and The Years of the Forest : "If you haven't read them, you have missed something special- particularly if you like animals, forests, and in general, getting away from it all." So wrote Mrs. Raymond A. Patton in response to a listing of Ohio-born literary talent in 1984, the year of Hoover's death. Whenever Hoover was applauded for getting away from it all during her lifetime, she felt a "stir of annoyance" (Years 49). Her stories of living with her husband Adrian in the North Woods of Minnesota do fill her non-fiction books. The basic requirements of landscape and reporter are met, but, as with most nature writing, her stories are about more than "getting away from it all." She discovered the interdependence of all life as she and her husband struggled to survive. She also learned a darker truth: the dangers in the forest were more often human. Hoover's organization of the material in the earlier autobiographical works allowed her to set aside much of the pain, physi- cal and emotional, that she suffered in the woods, but the framework of the later Years of the Forest allowed no such relief. Comparison of the introductory material to Long-Shadowed For- est and to Years reveals Hoover's altered mood when addressing the problems of anthropomorphism in discussing wildlife. Hoover shares a delightful anecdote in her Acknowledgments to the earlier Long- Shadowed Forest : I make an exception [to thanking a legion of people individually] of a little girl, name unknown, who, during a conversation at a nearby lodge, settled a vexatious problem for me. She said, "Boy animals are Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment 15.1 (Winter 2008) Copyright Â© 2008 by the Association for the Study of Literature and Environment</page><page sequence="2">76 ISLE he, girl animals are she, and if you don't know- it's it." Perhaps she [. . .] may read this and know how grateful I am. Although many of the life-altering changes presented in Years had already occurred, Hoover did not need to face them in her book of flora and fauna surrounding her Minnesotan cabin and summer house near the Canadian border. But the delight apparent in the story of the little girl disappears in the Foreword to the later Years. In speaking of her examination of her later life in the woods with Adrian, she states, "Because our close association with the life of the forest has led us to know members of the more highly evolved species as individuals and to recognize all animal life as related to us, even though very distantly, I have used 'it' and 'which' only for the nonsentient components of our wild world" (xii). The more personal revelations forthcoming in Years are coupled with a colder explanation of her rhetorical choices than the more scientific Long- Shadowed Forest. Hoover and her husband are minor characters in the guidebook that sports an index and a bibliography. Their encounters with nature make the scientific information more accessible to a popular audience. For example, in the chapter entitled "The Fungus and Its Partners," Hoover sees lichen on water-soaked bark after a rain, then discusses fungi, and ends with the role of fungus in continuing the chain of all life. In "The Air Hunters," a goshawk flies near gray jays, and Hoover recalls the importance of predators in preventing overpopulation, starvation, and devastation of the environment, the balance necessary for all spe- cies to survive. After the Hoovers' initial surprise at seeing few forest creatures near their newly-acquired cabin, they showed themselves to be no threat and then established a feeding station, described in "Canteen for Forest Dwellers." Beginning with a single buck in 1958, deer came for grain and cedar branches cut by Adrian (109). In the section of Long-Shadowed Forest devoted to "The Deer Family," Hoover relates the history of the elk, moose, woodland caribou, and white-tailed deer in the area, noting that only the moose and white- tailed deer then remained and the deer were more recent inhabitants, lured by new growth on cleared and burned land. Here, she introduces the story of Mama and her offspring, a tame herd eventually totalling six and later reduced to three during the 1961 hunting season. She also acknowledges her part in eroding the deer's natural fear of humans (129-41). Mama's story is interesting in itself but is also provided as a framework to discuss reproduction, feeding habits, and other behaviors of white-tailed deer. Where the progenitor of Mama's family is anony- mous and polygamous in Long-Shadowed Forest , he emerges fully drawn, first as a protector and then a wooer, in Hoover's next book.</page><page sequence="3">A Darker Place 77 With her popular The Gift of the Deer, Hoover expanded Mama's story and entertained her readers with the story of Peter Whitetail, a wounded deer that stepped into the Hoovers' lives on Christmas day. As Hoover writes, "There is a legend- from Norway, I think- which says that all lost animals come home at Christmastime. Peter was no longer lost" (19). The Hoovers fed the starving Peter, and Helen taught him to compensate for his blind, left eye. Peter repaid the Hoovers by returning each year with Mama's ever-growing family, including, in order, Pig and Brother, Pretty and Fuzzy, and Starface and Little Buck. Adrian's drawing of the deer within a family tree opens the narrative, and Hoover breaks their stories into five sections: "The First Year- Peter," "The Second Year- Mama and Her Twins," "The Third Year- The Fam- ily," "The Fourth Year- The Long Road," and "Epilogue- The Gift." The joy of studying the family ended with hunting season in 1961; Mama, Pretty, and Starface remained (187). (In Long-Shadowed Forest , Hoover reports three of the four earlier offspring were feeding that fall; in Gift , all four are present with the fawns. Further, in the earlier work, Hoover reports the fawns survived, but in Gift , Little Buck does not return to the feeding area.) Peter disappeared shortly after, possibly dying as he lured a wolf away from Starface (201). In a book for a general audience, a book in which parameters have been softened, Hoover ends with a positive view. In her epilogue, years later, she moves from the loss and sadness of the last chapters of "The Long Road" to affirmation of the decision to help a wounded deer. He, in return, had brought Mama to the Hoovers and fathered (and rescued) Starface. Hoover ends simply: "He was Peter, our buck with the generous heart" (210). In A Place in the Woods , the book more commonly included in read- ing lists, Hoover relates what she calls "misadventures" experienced during the Hoovers' first year and a half in the "boreal forest" (vii). In retrospect, they seem to her to "hold an aura of the ridiculous" (viii). These misadventures, told along with the stories of Mrs. Mouse, Walter the weasel, and other animals, are so many and some so dangerous that many readers probably wonder how the Hoovers survived their early days in the woods. Their calamities include a near bath in sul- furic acid (25), a rampaging bear's attempt to enter the cabin (31-2), a collapsing foundation (34), near suffocation (98), a serious car accident that left them with no car for years (107), and several stove and chim- ney fires. The problems that the Hoovers would face later in Years are forecast during one of these incidents. Having been severely injured in the automobile accident and returned to their cabin by friends, the Hoovers anxiously awaited a delivery of needed kerosene. The truck driver, a close friend's workman, simply left the fifty-pound can be- side the road, up a steep path from their door. Helen Hoover's painful</page><page sequence="4">78 ISLE climb "blasted once and for all [her] innocent illusion that people in the woods are either born kind and helpful or become so when they move there" (121). The Hoovers' injuries and the loss of their car, coupled with more bad luck, cost Ade an important contract and their financial security, but Hoover adds, "There are times in life it is better not to dwell on, once they are past [. . .] (127). This could be her mantra for A Place in the Woods. Hoover closes Place with the total loss to fire of their work building. Ade had wired their cabin and planned to generate electricity from his work building. They had battled the fire alone, cut off from any help by their desire to live in seclusion. The fire could have engulfed their cabin, their woods, and the Hoovers themselves on that freezing night, but they prevailed. They realized then that they had achieved an inde- pendence; necessities of their city life, such as electricity and the radio, were no longer so. Hoover titles this final chapter "A Beginning." The Years of the Forest continues the Hoovers' life in the woods and is separated into two parts, "The Innocent Years" (1956 through November 17, 1961) and "The Years of Change" (November 18, 1961, through fall, 1967), and ends, as in The Gift of the Deer, with a later epilogue. Any reader familiar with the earlier Gift will know why the break occurs in mid-November, 1961; that is the time when the group of deer the Hoovers had enjoyed as neighbors were attacked on their land posted with NO HUNTING signs (Gift 181). Because she concen- trates only on the story of the deer in that book, she is able to end with a positive epilogue about Peter Whitetail and the deer that came into their lives because of his rescue, the deer that survived the attack, and the future deer, "following the old trails through the forest, perhaps to come to [the Hoovers] for help in another winter of bitter cold and deep snow" (209-10). But Hoover must forge onward in Years- to tell the rest of the story. The break is also underscored by Hoover's twice recalling a con- versation with an acquaintance. Before the attacks, deer had returned to the yard, and she had received an advance to begin writing The Long- Shadowed Forest with Adrian's illustrations. Success was finally theirs; they were living in the woods, and, for the first time, making a living. She recounts, I walked a long way, stopping to watch the brook weave frills and lace over its stones, hearing the last calls of the crows, breathing in the rich scent of autumn earth. A friend drove along and stopped to talk a bit. I turned homeward with the sun in my face and joy in my heart. (169) After the attacks, Hoover realized that she contributed to the deaths of the young bucks when an old friend told the Hoovers that the hunters</page><page sequence="5">A Darker Place 79 had been "tipped off" (175). As she remembers the conversation with the "friend" [Hoover's quotation marks] on the road, she hears their words: " Any deer down your way ?" " Just our old doe and her kids. Two baby bucks and two does from last year and the young bucks she brought with her when she came. They're really beauties." " I thought you had a big buck with a fine head." "Peter? He doesn't come in this early." [Hoover's italics] (176) To discover who brought the hunters to her doorstep and to relate the story to her audience, Hoover had to recall a conversation that she would sooner have forgotten. Her success and her culpability were forever linked (179). Later in Years , she mentions the "agitated state of mind that gripped [her] whenever [she] began to work on the story of the deer, who had almost all been killed by men" (284). Indeed, writing the book caused her much anguish. In a birthday card (10 Aug. 1973) to her friend Bertha Goetsch, she confides, "Writing Years stirred up a lot of things it had taken years to put away and forget. The really ugly happenings weren't in the book and much of it was tamed down considerably; danger of libel suits otherwise."1 Other deaths followed. Hoover was able to end Gifts with the deer lost in 1961. In Years , she could not. Pretty was killed in 1965. Hoover recollects, "Sadly I remembered our beautiful doe, a victim of increased automobile traffic after her five safe years at our once secluded spot, and I wondered then, as I do now, whether her body was thrown on a dump, fed to dogs, or eaten as illegal venison" (266). In 1966, on the day before the galley proofs of The Gift of the Deer arrived, Mama was killed. Hoover realizes, "Our once-safe haven for the deer was safe no longer" (283). Additionally, Gregory the groundhog was shot (228), and the Hoovers' pet mice were poisoned by a substitute for their caretaker when they were away on a publicity tour (288-90). Each of these animals befriended by the Hoovers fell victim to a changing environment. Although the most painful, these were not the only memories that Hoover had to revisit to write Years. Added to the dangers of being removed from civilization in a sometimes hostile climate were the dangers that accompany poverty. Ade suffered wounds from chop- ping wood (8) and facial neuralgia from the strain of their lifestyle (43). Hoover reports scurvy, anemia (78-9), hunger, nausea (81), and lowered resistance (40) from their unbalanced diets. There was also fear- the fear that no sense of well-being would ever be forthcoming (83). And</page><page sequence="6">80 ISLE there was always the hard work! In a postcard, dated 13 July 1973, from Maitland, Florida, Hoover tells Mrs. Frank W. Goetsch, a friend living in Ohio, "I'm having walk &amp; arm trouble from injuries brought on during heavy labor up north. And I'm only 63! WOW!" In addition to the physical distance from people, choices that the Hoovers made caused further separation. They decided to forego electricity to save their environment (101), chose not to kill for food the wildlife they were enjoying (83), refused to use DDT or cut endangered trees during an infestation of budworms (182), and lived in a way that many people did not understand. Some considered them "kooks" (14). There were good friends- Jacques, Awbutch, and others- and helpful tradespeople- a grocer, the mailman, an oil deliverer- but there were also people who cheated the Hoovers. One person stole their grocery credits and left a bill in their name (35). Another sold them leftover oil at an inflated price with no delivery, a hardship both financial and physical for Adrian (55, 84). These transgressions pale beside the dangers inflicted by hunters. A poacher threatened Helen with a gun (122). In 1965, the Hoovers had posted No Trespassing signs and added a phone line, but soon found the line blocked when hunters were near. Then a bullet barely missed Helen's head, and the Hoovers realized their cabin and land were no longer safe during hunting seasons. They decided to travel to avoid the danger (272-73). As a further structural device, Hoover couples some items from an old to-do list with the years that they had been accomplished to title her chapters. The last item on the list is "take a vacation" (6). She and Adrian had previously missed a vacation when they had stayed at the cabin to care for the wildlife during a hard spring. That vacation to the Southwest had been intended not only for relaxation but for a "scout- ing trip" to find a place unthreatened by civilization, a place to draw and write (293). In the chapter "1967- take a vacation," she wonders if the people coming to the area will learn to live with the forest and its inhabitants. The road, the power lines, the snowmobiles- the very things that Hoover admits in her Foreword to Place later changed the woods- had come to pass. Better access had brought more tourists, more litter, more noise, more contaminated water, more visitors, more thefts, and more danger. The time had come to look for another place. Their years in the forest had earned for them a vacation far different than they had originally conceived. Thirteen years had passed before they left their cabin to travel in 1967. In her epilogue, dated 1971, Hoover briefly describes the places they visited during six trips: The Plains, The Lower Sonoran Desert, The Rocky Mountains, The Canyonlands, The Painted Desert, and</page><page sequence="7">A Darker Place 81 Monument Valley (311-12). In a later postcard (23 May 1973), picturing the Sheraton-Bel Air in St. Petersburg, Florida, she praises weather ("hot, damp- just my kind of weather") very different from that in the Minnesota woods and describes the "stretches of water" in the "flooded lower Miss, valley" as "incredible." Although Hoover's books paid for these vacations, the publishing of Years cost a vacation of her dreams. In her birthday card to Bertha, she resents that loss: Knopf held the ms. for months and so forced me to cancel travel plans it had taken five years to consolidate and which can never be duplicated for one reason or another. Some of these were culminations of long-time dreams and all the work and hardship was to the end of getting the necessary cash for them. Weary? You're damn right. (10 Aug. 1973) Hoover shows here that the decision to live in the woods was more than a choice to "live deliberately"; as evidenced by many nature writers, the experience becomes a way to make money, sometimes to support the lifestyle itself, other times to attain more than the lifestyle offers. The Hoovers had found no place to settle and study during their six trips to the Southwest and had returned each time to more change. Nevertheless, Hoover uses her epilogue to balance loss, just as she had in The Gift of the Deer. Upon her return in 1971, she felt "shock and sor- row and disillusionment" (316-17), but realized when she saw Starface that the place in the woods had become part of her. The dangers from civilization had been many, the dangers from wildlife few, and when she centered on the natural world, she was able to end her book with optimism that she did not really feel. Her July 1973 postcard to Goetsch shows a more dejected Hoover: "Glad you like Years. Reviews are good but, oddly, very scarce. Think Knopf lost some names or some such; would be par for the course. I'm still all in from writing it- too much work &amp; misery to be worth it." She further laments in a later postcard, "I'm still weary; will take a long time for me to recover from all the disappointments" (6 Aug. 1973). Hoover mined the same material four times. She centered first on the flora and fauna, followed with the story of the deer, and then lim- ited her narrative to the first year of her experiences. The Hoovers had found their place in the woods when life there was still determined by the seasons. Lack of power lines and easy access to the area had occasioned both their narrow escapes from severe injuries and their profound appreciation of the natural world around them, the gift of the wild to study. When Hoover wrote The Years of the Forest , she chose a structure that could not isolate her from the harsher realities of their existence, causing her pain and leaving her readers with a darker place in the woods.</page><page sequence="8">82 ISLE NOTE 1.
