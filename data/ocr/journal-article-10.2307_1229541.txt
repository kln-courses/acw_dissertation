<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Eleventh Amendment as Curb on Bureaucratic Power Roderick M. Hills, Jr.* Scholars frequently attack the Court's recent sovereign immunity jurisprudence on the ground that it serves no practical function. In particular, critics can identify no sensible purpose to the doctrine's distinction between private lawsuits seeking "prospective" (injunctive) relief against state governments (which are allowed under Ex Parte Young) and private lawsuits seeking "retrospective" (monetary) relief against state governments (which is barred by the principle of sovereign immunity). This article takes issue with this objection to sovereign immunity doctrine by suggesting a practical function to the injunction-damages distinction. The doctrine might serve the function of strengthening the position of elected non-federal policy "generalists" (governors and state legislators) against appointed state bureaucrats. State agency specialists often are more loyal to their counterparts in federal agencies, because they share a professional culture, career paths, program priorities, etc. Such a state official might not resist federal agency mandates in the rule-making process, because such mandates comport with his or her own thinking about governmental priorities, and they are a good excuse for a larger budget request from the state legislature. State agency specialists, therefore, can become a surreptitious force for undermining the policy-making discretion of state legislatures and governors. The Eleventh Amendment doctrine's distinction between damages and injunctions might possibly protect against this threat to federalism. The reason is rooted in the practical reality of budgeting. The money necessary to pay damages rarely comes out of the revenues appropriated for an agency's operations. Instead, states typically maintain some sort of "Judgments Fund" for the payment of damages award. Because damages judgments do not affect an agency's bottom line, damages are a political headache for the state legislature, which must figure out how to find the money to pay the judgment, often out of other programs' budget. By contrast, each agency must itself decide how to comply with injunctions by reallocating their existing resources. Given the practical inertia of state budgeting, the cost of the federal mandate, when enforced with an injunction, will tend to lie where it falls-on the budget of the state agency subject to a state mandate-if the mandate is enforced only by an injunction and not by damages. * Professor of Law, University of Michigan Law School. I would like to thank Evan Caminker, Pam Karlan, Larry Kramer, and Rick Pildes for their comments on early drafts of this piece. 1225</page><page sequence="2">1226 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 53:1225 By forbidding damages, sovereign immunity doctrine places a 'firewall" between each state agency, insuring that federally mandated costs imposed on one state agency-perhaps with that agency's acquiescence-do not spill over onto the budgets of other rival state programs. Thus, the doctrine prevents any state agency from using federal mandates to enlarge its own budget. In this way, the states' immunity from damages might be a partial cure or at least palliative for the ill of state agency's disloyalty to the state's political leadership. INTRODUCTION Almost no one has any kind words for the Eleventh Amendment' jurisprudence of the Rehnquist Court. In particular, most scholars maintain that the Court's Eleventh Amendment decisions serve no useful function. Whatever its credentials as correct expositions of text, original understanding, or precedent, the doctrine (according to the prevalent view) does not serve any of the functions of federal regimes in any sensible way. Does Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence deserve this obloquy? One of its weaknesses is that the Court has not offered any convincing functional justifications for its decisions in this area, preferring to rest the case for Eleventh Amendment immunity on original understanding and judicial precedent.2 To be sure, the Court maintains that its decisions are rooted in the general "structure" of federalism. However, as I explain in Part I below (following in the footsteps of others), the Court has no persuasive argument for why federalism as a general matter should entail the byzantine tangle of rules and exceptions that have sprung from the Court's decisions in Hans v. Louisiana3 and Ex Parte Young4 and blossomed luxuriantly since Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida.' The purpose of this article is to fill the gap by offering a tentative functional defense of this doctrine. For the purposes of this article, I am not interested in justifying the doctrine in terms of text, precedent, or original understanding. There is voluminous literature debating the legitimacy of the doctrine in terms of these criteria to which I am neither able nor willing to contribute. Instead, I will focus on what I call the functional question: Is there any reason to believe that the Eleventh Amendment doctrine enunciated by the Court serves the functions of federal regimes in a cost- effective way? A caution is in order here. I am not arguing that the functional 1. I will follow the prevailing practice of using the term "Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence" or "Eleventh Amendment doctrine" as a shorthand to refer to all of the Court's decisions enforcing what might loosely be described as the doctrine of constitutional sovereign immunity. 2. For obvious reasons, the Court has not relied much on constitutional text. 3. 134 U.S. 1 (1890). 4. 209 U.S. 123 (1908). 5. 517 U.S. 44 (1996).</page><page sequence="3">May 2001] CURBING B UREA UCRA TIC POWER 1227 benefits of Eleventh Amendment doctrine are somehow the cause of that doctrine or that the Court actually had these benefits in mind when it devised the doctrine. Instead, I assume that it is a fortuitous accident that Eleventh Amendment doctrine serves any useful function. I identify the benefits of the doctrine not as causal explanation but as ex post normative justification. In short, it is possible that the Court through no virtue of its own stumbled on a handy way to protect federalism. I believe that there may be such a functional justification of the doctrine, a justification that I will tentatively set forth in this article. I emphasize that the argument is tentative, for it rests on empirical claims that have a certain intuitive plausibility, but must be taken as only anecdotally supported plausible hypotheses worthy of further investigation. The virtue (if any) of the argument is that it has been overlooked and might provide some functional justification for a doctrine that has attracted almost nothing but contempt. My idea is this: Eleventh Amendment doctrine might serve the function of strengthening the position of elected nonfederal policy generalists-that is, politicians with nonspecialized jurisdiction like mayors, governors, state legislators, city councilors, and county commissioners-from the threat of "picket fence federalism." The phrase is meant to suggest the image of vertical posts and horizontal slats of a picket fence, with the slats representing levels of government-federal, state, local-and the posts representing functional specialties of various agencies-environmental protection, worker safety, support for indigent families, health care, housing, etc. The idea behind the metaphor is that state and federal agency experts within the same specialty- the "posts" in the "fence"-often share more in common with each other than they do with the level of government by which they are employed. The head of a state's department of environmental quality, for instance, shares a professional culture with his or her counterpart in the federal Environmental Protection Agency; such a state official welcomes rather than fears federal environmental mandates, because they comport with his or her own thinking about governmental priorities, and they are a good excuse for a larger budget request from the state legislature. State agency specialists, therefore, can become a surreptitious force for undermining the policymaking discretion of elected nonfederal generalists like state legislators, city councilors, county commissioners, mayors, and governors. The state bureaucrat cannot be trusted to lobby vigorously against federal mandates in the federal administrative process. If an important function of intergovernmental lobbying is to insure that state and federal administrative agencies do not lose sight of values like state autonomy as a result of tunnel vision, then picket fence federalism is a threat to effective intergovernmental relations. The Eleventh Amendment doctrine's distinction between damages and injunctions might make sense as an effort to counteract this threat. The reason is rooted in the practical reality of budgeting. As I argue in Part 11 (B), state</page><page sequence="4">1228 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 53:1225 politicians have more reason to fear picket fence federalism when it results in damages rather than injunctions. The reason is that, given state constitutional and statutory rules on budgeting, the money necessary to pay damages rarely comes out of the revenues appropriated for an agency's operations. Instead, states either require the agency to make a specific budget request to the state legislature to pay the judgment, or the state legislature maintains some sort of "Judgments Fund" analogous to the federal judgments fund for the payment of damage awards. In either case, damages judgments do not affect an agency's bottom line: The agency typically does not-and may not-transfer funds appropriated for, say, personnel or equipment to pay off a judgment. Instead, damages are a political headache for the state legislature, which must figure out how to find the money to pay the judgment. By contrast, agencies must themselves decide how to comply with injunctions by reallocating their existing resources away from state goals and towards federal goals. Given the practical inertia of state budgeting, the cost of the federal mandate will tend to lie where it falls-on the budget of the state agency subject to a state mandate-if the mandate is enforced only by an injunction and not by damages. Given this description of the budgeting process, Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity might serve the useful purpose of preventing state agencies from using federal mandates to impose costs on the rest of the state budget. The state legislature and governor have little control over the damages liability that state agencies might incur (and even encourage), but they have some capacity to cabin the fiscal harm done from injunctions by refusing to appropriate extra money to cover the cost of such injunctions and requiring the agency to deduct the cost of federal mandates from their existing appropriation. By acting as a firewall against state agencies' consumption of money beyond their own appropriation, Eleventh Amendment immunity acts as a partial cure or at least palliative for the ill of picket fence federalism. How convincing is this argument? I leave that for the reader to decide. For my part, as I explain at greater length in Part III, I am only partially persuaded by it. It has a lot of moving parts and requires a lot of merely plausible assumptions. Moreover, the Eleventh Amendment does not apply to private causes of action to enforce "cross-cutting" conditions on federal grants- in-aid, which arguably pose a far greater threat of advancing picket fence federalism. I offer the argument not so much to recruit supporters for the Eleventh Amendment doctrine than to suggest a different way of thinking about federalism (and the Constitution in general)-one more attuned to the empirical realities of politics and government and less concerned with the "etiquette" of federalism or the danger of a symbolic smudge on states' "dignity." I. THE APPARENT PRACTICAL USELESSNESS OF ELEVENTH AMENDMENT DOCTRINE It is now a standard scholarly move to attack federalism jurisprudence as</page><page sequence="5">May 2001] CURBING B UREA UCRA TIC POWER 1229 excessively "formalistic."6 As I have argued elsewhere, this accusation usually does not stick: What at first glance seems like formalism in Printz v. United States7 actually practically serves useful functions. The Eleventh Amendment cases, however, are an embarrassment to defenders of judicially enforced federalism like myself, because, at least at first glance, they really do seem like mindless formalism-that is, a bunch of byzantine rules and exceptions signifying nothing except a weirdly anthropomorphic desire to protect states' "dignity" without any account of how state "dignity" is implicated by that which the doctrine forbids. In particular, from a functional point of view, there are two problems with the doctrine. First, it seems strange to allow the federal government to impose duties on the state governments and yet restrict the means by which Congress can effectively enforce those duties. Second, it is difficult to explain why Congress should be able to give private persons the power to sue states for injunctions but not for money damages. I will elaborate on these two criticisms in the two sections that follow. A. Why Give Congress Powers to Pass Laws But Deny Them the Means to Enforce Such Laws? As other commentators have noted, the weirdest aspect of Eleventh Amendment doctrine is that it does not deny Congress the power to regulate either private persons or even state governments. Instead, the doctrine simply limits Congress' power to use certain means to enforce such statutes that Congress has undoubted power to enact. For this reason, the Eleventh Amendment doctrines seem fundamentally different from either the doctrine of enumerated powers enforced in United States v. Lopez8 or the doctrine of state autonomy enforced in Printz. To see this point, it is useful to rehearse the functional arguments for enumerated powers and state autonomy and show how different the Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence is from other federalism doctrines. The functional argument for enumerated powers is too familiar to need any defense. Although scholars can disagree about whether such an enumeration of powers should be judicially enforced, there does not seem to be any serious argument against the position that certain issues are likely to be better handled by lower levels of government than by the central government.9 The functional 6. For an especially sensitive argument favoring this position, see Evan H. Caminker, Printz, State Sovereignty, and the Limits of Formalism, 1997 Sup. CT. REV. 199. 7. 521 U.S. 898 (1997). 8. 514 U.S. 549 (1995). 9. The most obvious and frequently discussed justification for such a division of responsibilities is that it enables more citizens to satisfy their policy preferences by facilitating the enactment of different policies in different regions. See, e.g., Jenna Bednar &amp; William Eskridge, Steadying the Court's "Unsteady Path": A Theory of Judicial</page><page sequence="6">1230 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 53:1225 argument for Printz and New York v. United States10 is more controversial. Some scholars insist that the doctrine is pointlessly "formalistic." As I have argued elsewhere,"' this position is misguided. It makes perfect functional sense to protect state resources by requiring the federal government to secure state politicians' consent before obliging states to enforce federal policy against private persons. This functional argument rests on the idea that, if the federal government wants to use states' regulatory machinery, it can easily purchase those services with its spending power. By requiring the federal government to buy those services with intergovernmental agreements, the Court has put cash in the states' pockets-thus, protecting an interest in decentralized power- without irnpeding any national goal. Printz and New York can be seen as analogous to general revenue sharing: Their best justification is simply that they give lower levels of government more money at no serious cost to nationalism. State autonomy is, in short, federalism on the cheap. It is this fact-the harmlessness of state autonomy-that distinguishes the commandeering of state regulatory services (which is forbidden) from preemption of state regulation (which is allowed). As I have argued elsewhere, states cannot use their entitlement to be free from federal commandeering to "hold out" for revenue much in excess of their opportunity costs of executing federal law, because the federal government has plentiful alternative sources to state regulatory services: The federal government can purchase these services from private organizations, local governments, and the federal government's own bureaucrats. By contrast, the power to preempt state law cannot be easily purchased, because Congress has no adequate substitute for state cooperation if states refuse to "sell" their veto over federal preemption. If the federal government could not preempt state laws by regulating private persons without the states' consent, the federal government would have nowhere else to go to get permission to enforce federal law within a state's territory. One might think that such monopoly power would encourage costly strategic bargaining by both sides, and it would give state governments more cash than seems intuitively justifiable. 12 Enforcement of Federalism, 68 S. CAL. REV. 1447, 1467-69 (1995). 10. 505 U.S. 144 (1992). 11. My functional defense of Printz is elaborated in Roderick M. Hills, Jr., The Political Economy of Cooperative Federalism: Why State Autonomy Makes Sense and 'Dual Sovereignty' Doesn't, 96 MICH. L. REV. 813 (1998). 12. Id. at 884-86. Matt Adler and Seth Kreimer criticize this theory on the ground that prohibitions on certain varieties of commandeering could give rise to a "holdout" problem. They offer the example of a federal statute requiring state legislatures to repeal a law, maintaining that Congress must have the power to commandeer state legislatures into enacting such a repeal, because voluntary inducements would give rise to a holdout problem. See Matthew Adler &amp; Seth Kreimer, The New Etiquette of Federalism: New York, Printz, and Yeskey, 1998 Sup. CT. REV. 71, 101 n. 91 ("Why should there be lesser holdout problems in securing a state's repeal of an existing regulation than in securing agreement not</page><page sequence="7">May 2001] CURBING B UREA UCRA TIC POWER 1231 Similar considerations justify Congress' power (upheld in Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority"3 and Reno v. Condon'4) to regulate the states to insure that they manage their own personnel and property according to federal standards. Congress cannot easily purchase state consent in this context, because, if states refuse to comply with Congress' request, then Congress has nowhere else to go to secure the desired outcome. Absent the power to regulate states' internal operations directly, Congress would confront states with infinite "hold out" power. For instance, if Congress could not order a state sewage plant to stop dumping sludge into a federal navigable waterway, then the state could hold out for sums far in excess of the cost of refraining from pollution: There would be no other place that Congress could go to obtain a clean river.'5 In short, common sense suggests that the Congress should have the power (1) to regulate private persons in certain enumerated areas by preempting state law that interferes with such federal regulation and (2) to regulate the states' property and personnel to the same extent that Congress can regulate private employment and private property. The Court, of course, has upheld these powers in numerous cases. Given that Congress can impose such regulatory burdens on the states, it seems extremely odd to maintain that Congress is barred from subjecting the states to private lawsuits that would insure compliance with these duties. Under the Court's doctrine, Congress can define the wages, working conditions, and employment practices of state employees and can determine to enact the regulation in the first place?") See also Daniel Meltzer, State Sovereign Immunity: Five Authors in Search of a Theory, 75 NoTRE DAME L. REV. at 1029 n.84 (endorsing Adler's and Kreimer's argument). This criticism, however, seems more the result of verbal ingenuity than genuine rebuttal. I am happy to define federal laws requiring the "repeal" (i.e., preemption) of state laws as permissible "preemption" rather than impermissible "commandeering." Moreover, despite Adler's and Kreimer's subtle (one might even say casuistical) parsing of precedent, I am certain that the Court would be equally willing to do so if the occasion ever arose that required such a decision. As Justice O'Connor observed in New York v. United States, "the power of federal courts to enforce federal law thus presupposes some authority to order state officials to comply." New York v. United States, 505 U.S. at 179. Typically, federal laws preempt inconsistent state laws simply by requiring federal and state courts and executives to disregard inconsistent state laws, not by requiring such officials or state legislatures to "repeal" those laws. 13. 469 U.S. 528 (1985). 14. 528 U.S. 141 (2000). 15. One might also justify the rule functionally on the ground that, if Congress has the power to regulate certain activities of private persons, then Congress must also have the power to regulate non-federal governments that engage in similar activities. Otherwise, unregulated governmental enterprises might obtain a competitive advantage over private businesses subject to federal regulation, driving them out of business and depriving Congress of its proper jurisdiction. This sort of reasoning was used in The Shreveport Rate Case, 234 U.S. 342 (1914), to justify federal regulation of intrastate railway rates as necessary and proper for the regulation of interstate rate-making, and some members of the Court seem to have been moved by this logic when they upheld a federal tax on a water bottling company owned by New York State in 1946.

United States, 326 U.S. 572, 588-89 (1946) (Stone, C.J., concurring).</page><page sequence="8">1232 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 53:1225 how state governments collect information and revenue from, and provide basic services to, their citizens. Yet the Congress cannot use one tool-the private lawsuit for damages-to make effective these undoubtedly legal orders. Contrary to the suggestion by Professor Dan Farber,'6 one cannot justify such Eleventh Amendment immunity by arguing that Congress can easily purchase the power to subject states to private lawsuits through its spending power. The functional argument in favor of the federal power to regulate states' personnel and property is precisely that this power would be difficult for Congress to purchase because of the danger of states' "holding out." What, then, is the point of withholding from Congress one particular means of effective enforcement of valid federal statutes? Aside from reliance on precedent and original understanding, the Supreme Court has argued only that such private lawsuits would be an insult to state "dignity" as a "sovereign." But this argument goes nowhere without more explanation of why state "sovereignty" would be offended by an obligation to defend themselves in court against private suits for damages.17 After all, private citizens and organizations have some sense of "dignity," yet they endure lawsuits with their dignity intact. The "dignity" argument seems only to boil down to an argument from original understanding: Traditionally, state governments could not be haled into court without their consent (perhaps because of some archaic and apparently magical conception of personal jurisdiction"8), and therefore it would be an offense against their "dignity" to subject them to suit by private persons today. But this argument simply restates the argument from original understanding-an especially weak reed on which to lean given that, in matters of federalism, the Court has largely ignored the original understanding by so broadly construing Congress' commerce power. The horse is gone: Why shut the barn door with the Eleventh Amendment? B. Why Prohibit Private Suits for Damages But Allow Private Suits for Injunctions? Even if there were some point to limiting private suits against the states, the Court has chosen a strangely circumscribed way to define this limit. Since Ex Parte Young,'9 the Court has held that private individuals can sue individual state officials for injunctions. As Justice Harlan noted in his dissent in Young, since state government can act only through individual officers, this amounts to 16. The Coase Theorem and the Eleventh Amendment, 13 CONST.

Yet private individuals are not permitted to sue the state itself for "retrospective" relief-a rule that is probably best understood as a simple rule against private lawsuits for damages compensating for past injury. What is the practical point of this distinction between suits for damages and suits for injunctions? The Court has offered only one functional defense. The point of the doctrine, according to the Court, is to protect state treasuries from the burden of paying monetary relief to private litigants.20 As numerous commentators have observed, however, this argument overlooks the fact that "prospective" injunctive relief permitted under Ex Parte Young also costs money: A state agency must divert state revenue from state-defined goals to federally-defined goals whenever it complies with an injunction governing, for instance, the state employees' wages, workplace, or hours.2' Indeed, one would think that damages would be less bothersome to state autonomy than injunctions, because (as with any other "liability rule"22) states retain the discretion to pay the damages while continuing its previous conduct. By contrast, an injunction imposes a financial burden on the state (because officials on the state payroll must now use their scarce time and resources obeying a judicial order), but the state retains less discretion concerning the conduct of its officials.23 In short, a quick initial glance at the Court's current Eleventh Amendment doctrine might lead one to dismiss the entire jurisprudence as entirely lacking any practical function. On this theory, the doctrine can at best be seen as an obeisance to history and precedent rather than an effort to achieve some 20. See, e.g., Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 666 n.Il (1974). For a canvassing of opinions resting the idea of sovereign immunity on the protection of state treasuries, see Carlos Manuel Vazquez, What is Eleventh Amendment Immunity? 106 YALE L.J. 1683, 1726-31 (1997). 21. Edelman, 415 U.S. at 685 (Douglas, J., dissenting); William P. Marshall, Understanding Alden, 31 RUTGERS L.J. 803, 805-06 (2000). One might be tempted to distinguish between "negative" injunctions that require states from pursuing a policy from "affirmative" injunctions that require states to engage in activities, on the theory that only the latter will require states to incur financial costs. But the action-inaction distinction is a very poor proxy for the distinction between incurring and not incurring revenue loss. For instance, a purely "negative" injunction on a tax would obviously cause states to lose significant revenue. Moreover, even apparently costless "negative" injunctions may frequently require states to expend lots of money. For instance, a requirement that states cease from housing prisoners three to a cell will obviously require the construction of more prison cells as a practical matter, given that states cannot practically release prisoners. 22.

Since I am uninterested in the "etiquette of federalism," this view would lead me to dismiss the entire Eleventh Amendment doctrine as a futile waste of time. I love judicially enforced federalism more than most scholars, but this sort of federalism- lacking any functional justification except mysticism about states' dignity- seems too ceremonial to be worthy of judicial enforcement. II. A FUNCTIONAL DEFENSE OF ELEVENTH AMENDMENT DOCTRINE? Or maybe not. Perhaps there is a functional case for the apparently purposeless Eleventh Amendment rules outlined above. In this section, I will attempt such a defense. Unlike the Court's own opinions, this argument will be rooted in how intergovernmental relations and state budgetary processes actually operate today, not on what the framers thought in 1789 or 1798 (when the Eleventh Amendment was ratified) nor on Supreme Court precedents. Although the functional theory that I will outline is consistent with the holdings of the Court's decisions, it is not contained in any of their reasoning: Indeed, as I argued above, these precedents do not contain any serious functional justification at all. It may be that the following functional justification has no place in a jurisprudence so dominated by precedent and history. But I hope that the following functional arguments might at least induce some scholars to re- focus their arguments against Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence toward the sorts of practical considerations that interest me the most. A. How Sovereign Immunity Protects Political Accountability What is the point of sovereign immunity? A common initial assessment is that sovereign immunity is worse than pointless: It is, according to this view, an atavistic remnant of monarchical despotism that places government officials above the law by allowing them to do harm without paying compensation to their victims.24 In his contribution to this symposium, Professor Erwin Chemerinsky provides a modern defense of Justice Wilson's republican repudiation of sovereign immunity by arguing that sovereign immunity undermines governmental accountability.25 But this argument does not give sovereign immunity its due. There is a plausible argument that sovereign immunity actually protects accountability of the government to the taxpayers by preventing government officials from negligently paying excessive sums to litigious claimants. The essential premise of such an argument is that government is not like private organizations 24. The best exposition of this view is provided by Justice James Wilson's concurrence in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 U.S. 419, 461-62 (1895), where Wilson declaims that sovereign immunity is a "haughty notion[]" pressed by "despotic Governments" that "degrade" the People from their proper "prime rank." 25. Erwin Chemerinsky, Against Sovereign Immunity, 53 STAN. L. REV. 1201 (2001).</page><page sequence="11">May 2001] CURBING BUREAUCRATIC POWER 1235 because government is much less closely monitored by its "owners." Unlike shareholders of a private corporation, the voters to whom government officials are nominally responsible cannot easily discipline the government through "exit" by selling their shares. It is also a familiar point that the cost of monitoring government is much higher than the gains for voters who are not political junkies. Given that one can reap the benefits of good govemnment without oneself monitoring government, it is not a big surprise that most voters do not monitor government very carefully. Given this lax monitoring, one cannot assume that government officials will internalize the costs that they impose on citizens simply because the government pays damages to those citizens derived from the government's treasury. The money, after all, does not come out of the pocket of the officials who make the costly decisions. Moreover, the voters are not so attentive to government that they are likely to attribute the extra taxation resulting from government liability to officials' negligence. Why, then, should the officials care whether the government treasury incurs a damages judgment? By contrast, the claimants and their attorneys have greater incentive to pay close attention to the rules for extracting money from the government: The stakes are higher for them. The result of this familiar public choice story is that private claimants loot the fisc, while public officials fail to protect the taxpayer. Sovereign immunity prevents this failure of governmental accountability by barring claims against the treasury unless they are authorized by the legislature. This provides some modest assurance that the branch most accountable to the voters will design procedures and constrain the scope of liability to prevent excessive payout. Sovereign immunity is analogous to the doctrine barring private persons from obtaining adverse possession against the government26 or the doctrine barring estoppel of government based on the statements of officials with only apparent authority.27 All such doctrines can be justified as devices to protect government property or revenue from private claimants because government lacks agents or constituents who are faithful or energetic enough to do so. In short, sovereign immunity preserves accountability of government to taxpayers-or so one might argue. Whether the argument is persuasive will depend on the facts. In the rest of the article, I will lay out an argument and evidence to suggest that such an argument might justify, even if it does not explain, state immunity from private lawsuits for damages brought under federal statutes. 26. See, e.g., Prince v. Inhabitants of Plainfield, 40 N.J.L. (11 Vroom) 608 (1878); Mackanic Island Dev. Co. v. Burton Abstract &amp; Title Co., 132 Mich. App. 504, 349 N.W. 2d 191 (1984). 27. Romano v.

Intergovernmental Relations and the Problem of "Picket Fence Federalism" It is sometimes argued that the interests of state governments are safeguarded by the fact that state bureaucracies play a large role in administering federal programs and that "men and women recruited at the state level are found throughout the federal bureaucracy."28 It is certainly true that state agencies administer a wide range of federal programs, from income maintenance to occupational safety. However, it is an open question whether this cooperative federalism undermines or advances the goals of state autonomy. To see why, consider the possibility of what is sometimes called "picket fence federalism." "Picket fence federalism" refers to the tendency of state agency officials to feel primary loyalty to the federal agencies that share the state agency's mission. The metaphor of a "picket fence" is meant to conjure up a pattern of horizontal "slats" representing federal, state and local governments and vertical "posts" representing the combination of federal, state, and local agencies that collaborate to administer a single regulatory scheme in a particular policy area. The theory rests on the premise that state agency experts in particular policy areas (e.g., housing, environmental protection, worker safety, etc.) tend to be committed to the mission of the federal statute that they help to implement, and they tend to share a common sense of vocation and professional culture with the federal agency officials who oversee them. As a result, when federal agencies consider new regulations that impose burdens on state governments, such specialized state agencies tend to side with the federal government against their elected state masters. This premise should hardly be surprising. Many state agencies are effectively creatures of federal policy. The funds necessary for the agency's survival are derived from federal grants; indeed, the function of federal grants is frequently to build up state administrative capacity-meaning, create a bureaucracy loyal to federal goals.29 Federal statutes define the mission that animates the agency's personnel. State agency authority is derived in part from their mastery of federal statutes and administrative regulations. The very independence of state agencies from the control of elected state politicians is frequently a product of federal law, which requires federal grants to be administered by a "single agency" that is insulated from political control. Consider, for instance, agencies specializing in special education for disabled children. The very concept of "special education" was largely a product of federal law -in particular, the enactment of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 and regulations adopted by the then-U.S. Department of 28.

The staff that implemented the federal program were ostensibly state and local employees, but their training was paid for by federal dollars and defined by federal regulations. The federal government defined the mission that united the disparate groups of policy professionals-psychologists, nurses, social workers, teachers, etc.-under the rubric of "special education." Indeed, the federal government even helped to finance the lobbying arm for special educators, the National Association of State Directors of Special Education.30 Given their strong ties to federal agencies and federal missions, it should not be a big surprise that state agencies sometimes work to advance federal policies even against the wishes of their ostensible masters, the state and local elected "generalists," like mayors and governors. As an illustration of how state bureaucrats use federal law to undermine the position of state politicians, consider Martha Derthick's account of how the Massachusetts welfare department allied itself with the federal commissioner of welfare against the Massachusetts state legislature in insisting that the personnel administering Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) have a college degree.3' The state legislature resisted this requirement on the ground that it was gratuitously elitist and that it undermined the Massachusetts tradition of using town selectmen-local volunteers-to administer aid to the indigent. The Massachusetts commissioner of welfare, however, favored the requirement for a college degree, as it helped to move power over welfare from town amateurs to state professionals. He knew that he could not press for such a requirement without the political cover of being "forced" to do so by the federal government. Therefore, he carefully used federal power to advance his goal: He informed the federal welfare commissioner that he would be receptive to such a personnel requirement, received a directive from the federal commission to implement the college degree standard, and then drafted a bill with the help of federal regional welfare officials that was even broader than the federal directive.32 In lobbying the state legislature to enact the bill, the Massachusetts commissioner spread the word through journalists and private nonprofit organizations that the state would forfeit federal grant revenue if the bill were not enacted.33 Although some state legislators were dubious that the federal government would actually deprive the state of money, they had no independent source of information about the intentions of the federal welfare commission. In the end, they capitulated to the threat of lost federal grants even though only the state agency, not the federal government, issued such 30.

First, why is such picket fence federalism undesirable? Second, why cannot the state or national political process address picket fence federalism without the intervention of the federal judiciary? 1. Why picket fence federalism is undesirable. I offer two distinct arguments for why picket fence federalism is undesirable. One is a more traditional and familiar argument rooted in the idea that picket fence federalism undermines comprehensive, cross-program planning and budgeting. The second argument is less familiar but, I believe, more important: it is that picket fence federalism undermines the power of democratically elected "generalist" politicians, power that is a critical reason for schemes of cooperative federalism in the first place. The traditional objection to picket fence federalism is that it undermines comprehensive consideration of intergovernmental policies. The result is piecemeal policy-making by bureaucratic fiefdoms-housing, welfare, law enforcement, etc.-without any coordination and prioritization of the various policies across different areas of policy specialization. Each state agency presses the state legislature and governor with various federal mandates that must be funded, and the state politicians are forced to fund all of them without any capacity to rank them against the states' other policy goals or even against each other. Federal agencies also cannot provide such review. Federal policy generalists such as the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) lack any field offices to review the imposition of particular mandates by more specialized 34. Id. at 177-87. 35. Derthick offers a more general account of this tendency at id. at 204-14. For more recent accounts of picket fence federalism, see Richard Elling, Bureaucracy: Maligned Yet Essential, in POLITICS IN THE AMERICAN STATES: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS 286, 308-310 (Virginia Gray &amp; Herbert Jacob eds., 1996); DEIL WRIGHT, UNDERSTANDING INTERGOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS 83-85 (3d ed. 1988); John Chubb, Federalism and the Bias for Centralization, in THE NEW DIRECTION IN AMERICAN POLITICS 273, 293-97 (John Chubb &amp; Paul Peterson eds., 1985). Richard Simeon notes that state governments in the United States are less centralized than provincial governments in Canada and that, therefore, state elected officials have less opportunity in intergovernmental diplomacy to exercise preemptive control over their bureaucracies than provincial premiers.

The result is policy-making by happenstance, as each state agency insists on funding for federal mandates that the state agency itself either created or expanded (by misrepresenting the requirements of federal law) or at least did not vigorously resist (by bargaining weakly with its federal counterpart agency). One could object that Congress and the President can review the costs of federal mandates through its normal budgetary procedures. For instance, under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, the Congressional Budget Office is required to perform a fiscal analysis of certain mandates imposed on the states by estimating their likely fiscal cost to state governments.37 Likewise, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) in OMB reviews all federal agency regulations prior to their promulgation, in part to insure that the federal agencies respect the values of state autonomy and federalism.38 Such review, however, is too abstract at the legislative stage to be useful. The statutes administered by federal agencies are typically quite vague: their burden on states will depend on how they are administered or interpreted by federal agencies and federal courts.39 The UMRA does nothing to address state 36. There have been at least two efforts to create such field offices for coordinating federal mandates. In 1961, President Kennedy created "federal executive boards" by executive order. These boards consisted of representatives from the various federal agencies that operate in a particular metropolitan area-HUD, Justice, HEW, EEOC, etc. They were largely a failure in that the representatives from the various agencies lacked discretion to commit their parent agencies and lacked power to resolve essentially political struggles over the relative priority of different federal mandates. The Bureau of the Budget also proposed the creation of Bureau of Budget field offices to review and coordinate various federal agencies' mandates on the states, but this proposal was killed by Congress, which was worried about the Bureau of the Budget's transformation into a regional policy "czar."

"Picket fence" federalism might be regarded as undesirable for a second more controversial reason: It undermines the power of elected policy generalists-governors, state legislators, mayors, city councilors, county commissioners-to control state and local government. This argument against picket fence federalism is more controversial, because the benefits of elected generalists' power, especially in the context of intergovernmental programs, is less self-evident than the benefits of comprehensive planning and budgeting. I maintain, however, that elected generalists tend to provide a political culture, a "style" of governing, that is fundamentally different from and, in its place, better than, the bureaucratic style. Since Max Weber drew his famous contrast between the bureaucrat and politician as idealized types of political elites,40 there has been a voluminous literature investigating whether and to what extent bureaucrats and politicians actually differ from each other in the ways that Weber hypothesized.41 Although generalizations about this literature are hazardous, cross-national empirical investigation suggests some systematic differences in the career paths, political cultures, and governing "styles" of politicians and bureaucrats. Bureaucrats' authority rests on their expertise, specialized training, and experience dealing with particular interests defined by authorizing statutes. Therefore, bureaucrats tend to suffer from a certain tunnel vision: They do not try to form new interest groups but instead broker between those groups with which they are familiar. Bureaucrats also tend to resist or at least be indifferent to broad policy considerations or claims of abstract justice that do not fall squarely within their regulatory specialty; for instance, environmental experts will worry less about housing starts or racial integration than wetlands, simply because the latter is not part of their regulatory portfolio. Politicians' authority, by contrast, springs out of their capacity to organize and inspire voters. It is hardly surprising that they would tend to organize and represent latent interests that are not regular participants in government, using abstract rhetoric of justice special education community"). 40.

One might object that this de-politicization of federal programs is not necessarily a bad thing, because state agencies' loyalty to federal goals insures the success of federal programs. This is the theme of the study by Paul Peterson, Barry Rabe, and Kenneth Wong of intergovernmental relations in four localities.43 Where federal programs are administered by a trustworthy state or local bureaucracy that has internalized the federal goals as their own, then the programs "work." When the local bureaucracy lacks the prestige to resist state and local politicians, then federal money intended by Congress for some redistributive purpose-say, aiding disabled children, reducing school desegregation, or providing housing for the indigent-is instead converted by state and local politicians to the overriding goal of local economic development.44 Peterson, Rabe, and Wong convincingly show that federal programs run smoother when state policy professionals care about them and have the clout to resist state politicians who don't. However, they do not explain why state and local governments should be involved in the program at all: If the goal is simply to insure that federal programs are administered by sympathetic bureaucrats, then one would think that the program could just as easily be administered by federal field offices or prefectures. The point of creating an intergovernmental program must surely be to involve and not merely sidestep state elected officials so that they can integrate-and legitimize-state and federal goals.45 Making federalism work is not the same as making federal programs work, but Peterson, Rabe, and Wong cannot seem to tell the difference."6 In short, picket fence federalism might seem undesirable to the extent that it prevents state politicians or appointed policy generalists from considering the costs of federal programs in terms of local programs foregone. These costs are exacerbated when one is dealing with federal regulatory as opposed to spending 42. ABERBACH, PUTNAM &amp; ROCKMAN, supra note 41, at 106-114. 43. PETERSON, ET AL., supra note 30. 44.

For instance, Peterson, Wong, and Rabe argue that Mayor Donald Schaefer of Baltimore distorted the purpose of federal rental subsidies by directing them to persons displaced by Baltimore's re-development projects like the Baltimore Harbor shopping complex. But this "misuse" of federal funds removed a political obstacle to a potentially valuable urban revitalization scheme.

State and local politicians can escape the force of conditions on federal grants by simply turning down federal money. For instance, the Schaefer administration decided to forfeit desegregation assistance rather than comply with the demands of the Office of Civil Rights in the Office of Education for an acceptable desegregation plan.47 This option is not available when Congress exercises its powers under Condon and Garcia to regulate state and local governments' employment practices and property with unconditional federal mandates. In these regulatory contexts, non-federal politicians depend on their capacity to lobby effectively in Congress and in the agency administrative process. This capacity is critically hampered if the politicians' own state and local agencies are effectively coopted by the federal agencies seeking to impose the mandate. 2. Why the national political and administrative process is vulnerable to picket fence federalism. But what about the ability of state and local governments to protect themselves through the federal political process, by lobbying Congress or administrative agencies to relieve them of federal mandates? The recent history of intergovernmental relations does not suggest optimism that the national political process will correctly weigh the costs to federal and non- federal policy goals. One reason is that protection of state autonomy is an arcane matter of jurisdiction with causally complex benefits-the sort of policy that even state and local elected officials are inclined to ignore when it serves more immediate partisan interests. Interest groups that lobby Congress have recently tended to be biased in favor of simple, straightforward goals that can be marketed to the general public through mass mailings and dramatic publicity campaigns.48 They support policies that can be communicated on a T-shirt or a fund-raising letter-goals like cleaner air, safer cars, higher wages, fewer handguns, restrictions on abortions, cheaper prescription drugs, etc. The rise of advocacy groups led by professional staff has exacerbated this tendency to 47. Id. at 204. 48. For a summary of literature describing the rise of single-issue coalitions in federal politics, see THOMAS J. ANTON, AMERICAN FEDERALISM &amp; PUBLIC POLICY 93-97 (1989). It is interesting to speculate on whether the prevalence of single-issue groups is related to the scale of government. It is a costly undertaking to organize an interest group because of the familiar collective action problem posed by free riders: Non-members can enjoy the benefits of other persons' lobbying without contributing to such efforts, so few will have sufficient incentive to join an interest group. These costs of organizing interest groups only get larger as one expands the population of the relevant jurisdiction, because the organization must collect a larger number of geographically dispersed members using the expensive tools of mass mail in order to present a credible electoral threat to members of the legislature. (For a summary and analysis of the literature concerning these collective action problems, see Steven P. Croley, Theories of Regulation, 98 COLUM. L. REV. 1, 60-65 (1998)). It may be the case that single-issue coalitions gravitate to Washington, D.C., because the need to overcome collective action problems with simplified agendas is greatest at the federal level.</page><page sequence="19">May 2001] CURBING B UREA UCRA TIC POWER 1243 support specific and cognitively simple goals, because the "members" of such groups typically have low levels of commitment to the organization,49 participating only by occasionally writing a check, and the internal dynamics of group participation seem to promote ideological purism from the most diehard advocates within the group.50 Moreover, the evidence suggests that interest groups are more effective when they avoid competition with other interest groups by "defining a highly specific issue niche for itself and fixing its specified political assets (i.e., recognition and other resources) within that niche."5" Simply put, effective national interest groups support narrow goals that can be easily communicated to their members and that minimize the chance of fights with other interest groups.52 Thus, it should not be surprising that there are no effective interest groups of private citizens in favor of abstract goals like balanced budgets, low inflation, or state autonomy, as the causal link between such policies and social benefits is causally remote and the general nature of such policy goals maximizes the possibility of fights with other interest groups. There are reasons quite apart from the merits of the relevant policies why Mothers Against Drunk Driving is an effective lobby while Citizens for Effective Federalism is a non-existent one. The only lobbies that represent elected policy generalists-six of the Big Seven53 intergovernmental lobbies-are notoriously plagued by the same dynamic outlined above that governs private interest groups: Specific, causally simple policies ("stop drunk driving now!") drown out abstract, long-term, and causally complex ones like state autonomy.

If a mayor or governor favors gun control or a lower alcohol level for DWI convictions, then it will be difficult for that elected official to resist a federal mandate on the purely jurisdictional ground that the proposed federal law is a good idea pursued by the wrong level of government.54 Such opposition will seem hyper-technical to the private interests that, for reasons of mass communication and organizational necessity, place abstract and long-term goals like federalism behind their immediate substantive objectives. Moreover, federalism (like other policies with long-term and diffuse benefits) places its advocates in a prisoners' dilemma. One or two federal mandates will not significantly erode state autonomy: It is the concatenation of numerous mandates that strips state politicians of policy-making discretion and destroys the state fisc. A politician's present opposition to a proposed federal mandate that advances his or her other substantive policy goals is pointless self- sacrifice unless, in the future, other interest groups exercise similar self- restraint by opposing other federal mandates that advance their particular goals. Otherwise, one would simply be preserving the states' budgets to advance someone else's favorite federal mandates. State autonomy, in other words, is a collective good analogous to balanced budgets.55 To maintain the good, one must secure the cooperation of numerous different interest groups, but each group will be tempted to defect from any deal to cooperate, knowing that their conscientious respect for state autonomy will not suffice to protect state autonomy absent an unattainable guarantee that others will respect state autonomy in the future. It should be no surprise that, like the value of balanced budgets, the value of state autonomy is honored in the breach. Although there is widespread rhetoric in favor of federalism in the halls of Congress, most congresspersons are cynical about the rhetoric's sincerity, knowing that each interest group stands ready to abandon state autonomy as soon as their particular cause will be advanced by a federal mandate. Most legislative or administrative devices for the avoidance of federal mandates have been widely acknowledged to be toothless failures.56 The Big Seven can sometimes get a delegation of 54. Occasionally one sees state politicians trying to rally behind a purely jurisdictional position.

For a variant of this "prisoners' dilemma" point, see Bednar &amp; Eskridge, supra note 9, at 1471-74. Bednar and Eskridge do not, however, root the prisoners' dilemma in the need for long-term cooperation among interest groups and across different issues. See id. (relating prisoners' dilemma to behavior of Congress and the states within a federal system). 56. Two such devices were Reagan's "federalism" executive order (rewritten slightly as President Clinton's Executive Order) and the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act. The federalism executive order was notoriously ineffective at promoting any serious</page><page sequence="21">May 2001] CURBING B UREA UCRA TIC POWER 1245 discretionary authority over programs that lack any powerful national constituency, such as aid to indigent families. But they have been singularly ineffective at gaining control over federal policies that are important to effective national lobbies. Likewise, efforts to convert categorical grants into block grants or even simply to reduce federal involvement in local infrastructure expenditures57 have foundered on Congress' notorious love of categorical grants which facilitate incumbent congresspersons' capacity for nrbbon-cutting and credit-taking. It is possible that the decentralized nature of American political parties mitigates this indifference to state autonomy.58 However, admittedly casual empiricism suggests that the partisan loyalties of both federal and non-federal politicians seem to cause them to ignore abstract policies like state autonomy that have no obvious and immediate partisan payoff.59 This is not to say that there have been no efforts to give elected policy generalists control over state agencies that implement federal programs. There have been several such efforts, beginning with initiatives during the Johnson administration to require federal agencies to consult with elected generalists over regulatory policyY60 Against these efforts, however, there are persistent incentives for Congress and the interest groups that lobby Congress to favor consideration of federalism by administrative agencies. The UMRA has widely been derided as empty public relations, because it exempts existing mandates from its scope, defines unfunded mandates to exclude most of what non-federal officials complain about, and gives the Congressional Budget office the impossible task of quantifying the burden on the states. 57. I hold no brief for block grants which, as several observers have noted, can give non-federal governments incentives to waste revenue on projects cross-subsidized by non- resident taxpayers. See Alan Ehrenhalt, The Locust in The Garden in ALAN EHRENHALT, DEMOCRACY IN THE MIRROR: POLITICS, REFORM, AND REALITY IN GRASSROOTS AMERICA 110 (1998). 58. See Larry Kramer, Understanding Federalism, 47 VAND. L. REV. 1485, 1522-42 (1994). Against Kramer's view, one might argue that that the political fortunes of governors, mayors, and other non-federal politicians will be protected through the national political process, but that federalism or state autonomy will not be so protected. Benefitting federalism and benefitting non-federal politicians are not the same thing. It might be in the political interests of governors and mayors, for instance, to wreck states as effective policymaking institutions, by supporting whatever federal mandates will advance interests of the coalitions that elected them. Federalism is a theory about the proper division of political responsibility, not a theory about the preservation of lower-level officials' political careers. On this point, see Elizabeth Garrett, Enhancing the Political Safeguards of Federalism? The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995,45 U. KAN. L. REV. 11 13, 1127-31 (1997). 59.

The chief mechanism for this subversion of state regulatory processes is federal sponsorship of state agencies with dubious loyalty to state political leadership. B. How Eleventh Amendment Doctrine Might Help Cure "Picket Fence Federalism" Suppose that one agrees with me that there are some perverse incentives for both state agencies and Congress not to resist federal mandates. How does current Eleventh Amendment doctrine help? To summarize the argument laid out below, one would expect that state politicians have greater oversight over injunctions than damages, because injunctions must be financed (at least initially) out of the existing agency budget, while damages usually have to be appropriated by the legislature, either as an "open appropriation" for some sort of state Judgments Fund or from a specific line item appropriation. In short, damages put the burden of funding federal mandates on state legislatures and governors; injunctions put the burden on state agencies. If one wanted to give state politicians greater control and state agencies less control over the burdens of federal mandates, then the Eleventh Amendment doctrinal distinction between damages and injunction is not an entirely bad place to start. The essential premise of this argument in favor of Eleventh Amendment doctrine is that state agencies typically do not pay damage judgments out of their own appropriation for operations. Instead, damages are typically financed in one of two different ways. First, some states (as well as the federal government) maintain a "Judgments Fund" from which damages are paid. This "Fund" often takes the form of an open appropriation under which the Department of the Treasury or similar agency is authorized to pay judgments incurred against the government. Second, for some large judgments, the state agency will simply have to make a special budget request to the state legislature, which will then approve a line-item appropriation to pay the judgment. Neither of these systems requires or even allows an agency to shift revenue appropriated for agency operations-purchase of equipment, payment of salaries, hiring of contractors, etc.-and instead use this money for payment of judgments to an aggrieved individual. In other words, damages judgments do not have any immediate effect on agency operations. Of course, the state legislature could theoretically cut the agency's budget by the amount of the damages judgment awarded against an agency. But this practice seems to be a merely theoretical possibility, not a practical reality: No state, to my knowledge, routinely engages in such a method of financing payment of judgments awarded against the state. The reason may be that budget cuts are a reactive strategy for controlling state agencies: It is politically costly for legislators and the governor to re-open the question of how</page><page sequence="23">May 2001] CURBING B UREA UCRA TIC POWER 1247 to finance an agency's operations and negotiate new budget levels.6" There is always a danger that, by re-opening these contentious questions, the legislature might inadvertently be confronted with new, unrelated controversies that could be resolved in ways unfavorable to any particular elected official.62 Moreover, if an agency has substantial support from a specific constituency of beneficiaries, then it will not be easy to subject the agency's operations to the budgetary axe. Instead, one would expect the state legislature to cut the budget of the state program whose beneficiaries are the least well-organized and have the least influence with the state legislature. It would be simply coincidental if these agencies were the same as the agencies against which damages judgments were entered. Would it be possible for a state to force an agency to pay judgments out of its existing appropriation for operations? Nothing in theory prevents such a system. Indeed, advocates of takings legislation have supported such a method for paying "just compensation" judgments as a way of deterring agencies from engaging in excessive regulation of real estate.63 The difficulty with these proposals is that they seem to violate the practice-and perhaps the constitutional requirement-that agencies spend money only for the purpose for which it was specifically appropriated.64 It is contrary to traditional budgeting practices to allow an agency to use money appropriated for one purpose-say, paying salaries-and instead use it for another purpose of paying off judgments. Agencies typically do not retain such discretion to lay off workers or sell governmental property without specific authorization from the legislature. Budgeting of this sort is quintessentially a legislative task, because only the legislature has the democratic legitimacy necessary to make controversial policy choices about how public money ought to be spent. In short, agencies do not pay damages judgments, and there is no obvious way to 61. The difficulty of shifting costs from their initial landing place is analogous to the difficulty of shifting revenue from its initial recipient. This latter difficulty is dubbed the "flypaper effect" in the public finance literature. This term refers to the tendency of non- federal officials to retain federal grants for governmental expenditure even when they have legal authority to pass back to the grant to private citizens as tax reduction. See Edward Gramlich, Paul Courant &amp; Daniel Rubinfeld, The Stimulative Effects of Intergovernmental Grants: Or Why Money Sticks Where it Hits, in FINANCING FEDERAL SYSTEMS: SELECTED ESSAYS OF EDWARD GRAMLICH 127-43 (1997). An analogous tendency may lead politicians to let federally induced losses stick where they land. For evidence supporting this view, see Julie Cullen, The Incidence of Special Education Mandates: Does the Mainstream Pay?

When an injunction is entered against an agency, then the agency is obliged to comply with the injunction on penalty of being held in contempt by the court. Unless there is a specific limit in the appropriation barring officers from engaging in the activities required by the injunction, the agency can comply with the injunction without violating any budgetary rule. Such compliance would cost money, but the agency rather than the legislature would have to come up with the means of covering this cost, presumably by delaying or reducing the staff time expended on other goals required by state law. Suppose that a court orders a school district to provide individual educational programs for disabled students, supported by such services necessary to insure that the disabled students get some sort of benefit from the plan.65 Assuming scarcity of staff, the order would require the staff to spend less time on the education of non-disabled children and more time on the education of disabled children. It would be up to the district to figure how to deploy its existing staff, equipment, and property (all authorized by existing appropriations) to comply with the injunction-by increasing class size, eliminating course offerings, shortening instructional time, etc. If all of these options were foreclosed by state law, then the district would have to choose which state requirements were trumped by the federal mandate, for the Supremacy Clause would preempt state-law defenses to a federal obligation. The agency could request a larger appropriation to cover the additional cost of the injunction. The advantage of such a request from the state politicians' point of view is that they can more easily control the cost of the federal mandate simply by maintaining the agency's existing appropriation and refusing to appropriate extra money to cover the federal mandate. Given that state legislatures are frequently subject to constitutional limits in incurring debt or raising taxes, the agency would often have to struggle with other agencies (and the interest groups that those rival agencies serve) for additional money. Budgetary inertia would often result in the cost of the injunction falling on the agency against which the injunction was entered. In other words, the agency itself must initially and presumptively use its existing budget to pay for injunctions. By contrast, the state legislature must presumptively figure out how to come up with money to pay for damages entered against the state. I emphasize that these are merely presumptions. It might be possible for an agency to shift the cost of federal injunctions on to other agencies through astute use of the budgetary process. Likewise, it is possible for the state legislature to force an agency to bear the cost of damages judgments by some sort of pro rata reduction of the agency's budget in proportion to the judgments entered against the agency. Nonetheless, the two remedies create two different presumptions or starting points for budgetary 65. This is the requirement of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. See Board of Educ. v.

This distinction suggests a way in which a prohibition on state liability for damages might ameliorate the problem of picket fence federalism. Picket fence federalism essentially results from perverse bureaucratic incentives to encourage (or not to resist) federal mandates. But these incentives are especially perverse when federal mandates are enforced through damages, because damages do not fall in the first instance on the agency's own budget. One might reasonably prefer injunctions as the exclusive remedy for the violation of federal mandates, because injunctions give state legislatures greater power to supervise the costs that state agencies impose on the state budget. The state legislature has greater power to punish state agencies for incurring too many injunctions, because it can more easily deduct the cost of those injunctions from the state agencies' budget simply by maintaining the budgetary status quo. The bar on damages liability prevents the state agency from "externalizing" part of the cost of federal mandates on the state budget. So, for instance, if a school district were to capitulate in either the administrative process (notice and comment, etc.) or litigation to private litigants seeking a broad definition of "learning disabilities" under the ADEA, then the ban on damages liability insures that all of the cost of this federal mandate will fall on the school district's budget exclusively. The injunction would force the school district itself to re-shuffle scarce resources away from non-disabled students, angering parents of such students and thwarting an important part of the school district's mission. No part of the mandate could be shifted to the state budget through damages that the state legislature would be obliged to pay through the Judgment Fund. Why is it useful for the legislature to cabin the cost of federal mandates to a particular agency's budget? The reason is that this cabining creates a budgetary "firewall" limiting the financial damage that federal legislation can wreak on the state fisc. Whatever the cost of federal mandates, the Eleventh Amendment's limit on remedies insures that this cost will have to be deducted (in the first instance) from a single agency's appropriation: The Eleventh Amendment focuses the entire cost of federal mandates on the state agencies that are subject to the mandate. According to the theory of "picket fence federalism," such state agencies are most likely to have requested the mandate. Thus, the Eleventh Amendment insures that a state agency that betrays its political masters cannot impose costs on rival state agencies. Moreover, the limit on damages payable from the general budget or Judgment Fund protects interest groups that are the clients of other state agencies from having their appropriation docked because of a federal mandate on another state bureau. Such protection is a useful way to prevent a "vertical coalition" that is weak in the states but strong in Congress from using federal power to effectively take state revenue from a "horizontal coalition" that is</page><page sequence="26">1250 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 53:1225 strong in the states but weak in Congress.66 If a vertical coalition (say, advocates of early childhood education) succeeds in imposing some mandate on a state agency (for instance, bilingual education requirements), then the limit on damages insures that the cost will be borne only by the educational budget and not, say, the budget of parks &amp; recreation, law enforcement, transportation, etc. If the vertical coalition is the primary beneficiary of the mandated agency, then it will find that it cannot enlarge its revenue share through federal mandates: It can only reshuffle the state money that it already has. (For instance, the advocates of early childhood education will have to pay for bilingual education by using more teachers for such education and cutting back on other educational priorities). This justification for the Eleventh Amendment can be seen as a specific instance of a more general theory-the theory of how best to insure that politicians control bureaucrats. This problem has spawned a voluminous literature in law and political science about whether such control is normatively desirable or practically possible. The argument in favor of the Eleventh Amendment offered here assumes that such political control of administrators is normatively desirable.67 The difficult point is whether Eleventh Amendment doctrine is a sensible means to this end. There are other ways of insuring that state elected officials review state agencies' intergovernmental relations. One could, for instance, require the state's budget officer to review all state agencies' grant applications.68 One could require the state's attorney general- universally an elected official-to be joined in any lawsuit between a private litigant and a state agency to oversee any settlement between the litigant and the agency. One could also exempt state and local elected officials' advice to federal agency officials from the otherwise applicable disclosure and transparency requirements of federal statutes such as the Federal Advisory Committees Act.69 The case for giving state elected officials this sort of primacy in intergovernmental relations would be similar to the case for giving the President or his appointees (e.g., the Attorney General or OMB) exclusive 66. On the theory of vertical and horizontal coalitions, see ANTON, supra note 48, at 82-90. 67. This assumption could rest on two premises. First, only officials with general policy-making jurisdiction (e.g., mayors, governors, state legislators, etc.) are capable of making the tradeoffs between policies in different fields necessary for coherent government. Second, only elected officials possess the temperament and popular authority necessary to make such tradeoffs. There is obviously much that could be said against the second premise: City managers, prefects, and officials in OMB all exercise general jurisdiction over multiple unrelated policies without creating a crisis of legitimacy, even though they are not elected. 68. On the controversies over this question, see George D. Brown, Federal Funds and National Supremacy: The Role of State Legislatures in Federal Grant Programs, 28 AM. U. L.

I do not defend Eleventh Amendment immunity as superior to these other mechanisms for insuring democratic control of administration. I argue only that it practically has some of the same effects, because it prevents bureaucratic neglect from resulting in private pillaging of the general budget. This is by no means the perfect cure for picket fence federalism, but it has a certain crude logic that Eleventh Amendment doctrine's detractors have overlooked. II. CAN FUNCTIONAL CONSIDERATIONS EXPLAIN THE EXCEPTIONS TO ELEVENTH AMENDMENT IMMUNITY? Assume provisionally that this functional argument for distinguishing between damages and injunctions makes some practical sense as a way to prevent "picket fence" federalism. Still, there is more to Eleventh Amendment doctrine than the distinction between prospective and retrospective relief. Consider, in particular, three exceptions that seem hard to justify with the functional considerations laid out here. First, the doctrine allows federal executive officials to sue states for damages. Second, the doctrine allows private litigants to sue for damages to enforce conditions on federal grants-in- aid, on the theory that states waive their immunity by accepting the grant. Finally, Congress may abrogate state immunity if Congress is exercising its power to enforce the Civil War Amendments.70 Grant conditions (especially as cashed out in federal agency regulations) and federal agency enforcement actions seem vulnerable to picket fence federalism: State and federal agencies could collude in these contexts to maximize the burden of federal mandates. Can any of these exceptions be squared with the functional account of Eleventh Amendment immunity offered above? As I explain below, I boldly venture this response: I do not know. Rather than proffer an answer rooted in ignorance, I will instead outline the sorts of empirical evidence needed to evaluate the functional sense of these exceptions to Eleventh Amendment immunity. A. Why Allow Federal Executive Enforcement of Federal Mandates with Damages? Let us start with the exception allowing federal executive officials to sue state governments for damages. The exception (sometimes called "plan 70. Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445, 455-56 (1976). The Fitzpatrick exception has been consistently reiterated by the Court in its recent Eleventh Amendment decisions. E.g., Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 80 (2000); Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Educ. Expense Bd. v. College Sav. Bank, 527 U.S. 627, 638 (1999); Seminole Tribe v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 59 (1996).</page><page sequence="28">1252 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 53:1225 waiver" on the theory that state immunity from federal government lawsuits was waived by states when they agreed to join the "plan" for a federal union) has been recognized since 1892,71 and it was recently reaffirmed by the Court in Alden v. Maine.72 How well does the functional argument for Eleventh Amendment immunity offered in Part II justify this exception? The Court itself justifies the "plan waiver" exception on the theory that "[s]uits brought by the United States itself require the exercise of political responsibility for each suit prosecuted against a State, a control which is absent from a broad delegation to private persons to sue non-consenting States."73 This is cryptic dicta indeed, but it points the way to a functional theory akin to the theory proposed by this article. The Court seems to be arguing that lawsuits brought by federal agencies themselves are subject to oversight by the "political" branches-that is, Congress and the President-and that this political oversight removes the objections that otherwise bar state liability for damages to private persons. The Court's reasoning, in other words, revolves around the importance of insuring that administrative processes are supervised by elected policy generalists-precisely the refrain of this article. How exactly does Congress' or President's supervision of federal agencies' lawsuits suffice to prevent picket fence federalism? The intuitive argument is that the President and his Attorney General will listen to governors and state attorneys general more carefully than private litigators when these state elected officials protest against a federal agency's enforcement of a federal regulation or statute against their state. Private litigators do not need to worry about retaining the support of governors or the state political parties that governors frequently control. Presidents and other federal politicians do. If the governors and state attorneys general protest loudly enough and if the federal mandate is vague enough, then the U.S. Attorney General may settle the lawsuit on favorable terms with the state. The U.S. Attorney General might be expected to feel more sympathy for the non-federal politicians not only because she is supervised by an elected official herself but also because she lacks the federal agency's devotion to their particular regulatory mission: Being a generalist, she might be less susceptible to the tunnel vision that, by hypothesis, leads to picket fence federalism. Professor Evan Caminker has objected to this "political safeguards of federalism" theory on the ground that "federal prosecutors have no duty of loyalty to states per se, and thus it seems dubious that they would refrain from 71. United States v. Texas, 143 U.S. 621, 646 (1892); see also Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U.S. 313, 328-39 (1934) (describing basis for plan waiver). 72. 527 U.S. 706 (1999). To be sure, the exception does not cover every lawsuit filed in the name of the United States: Against the suggestion of some scholars, the Court has suggested in dicta that the Eleventh Amendment would bar qui tam actions filed by private persons enforcing federal law. See Vermont Agency of Natural Res. v. United States, 529 U.S. 765 (2000). 73. Alden, 527 U.S. at 756.</page><page sequence="29">May 2001] CURBING BUREAUCRATIC POWER 1253 initiating an otherwise promising suit out of an abstract respect for the state's dignitary interests."74 But this argument overlooks the political controls on federal prosecutors. Undoubtedly, a lowly assistant U.S. attorney is indifferent to state sovereignty. But the prosecutor's boss is a political appointee-a U.S. attorney or Attorney General-who may be highly sensitive to the squeals of highly visible state politicos. Any case that offends governors is likely to gain the respectful attention of the Justice Department's top brass, and they may very well exercise their discretion to veto the lawsuit. There need be no corrupt political horse-trading to inspire such a settlement: It may be that, in return for a waiver of damages, the governor or state attorney general can offer some sort of alternative method of performing the federal obligation that satisfies the federal policies better than strict compliance with federal regulations. High federal and state officials have political incentives to engage in such bargaining. Private litigants do not.75 There is, in short, an intuitively plausible argument for exempting the federal governments' lawsuits from Eleventh Amendment immunity. But such a 'political safeguards" argument has a certain opportunistic flavor that rests uneasily with the larger justification for judicial enforcement of the Eleventh Amendment. After all, if such vague "political safeguards" suffice to prevent picket fence federalism in the context of litigation, then why does not the same "safeguards" in the legislative and regulatory process make all judicial enforcement of the Eleventh Amendment unnecessary, regardless of whether a private party or the federal government brings suit?76 The President's appointees in OMB (specifically, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs) review all federal agency regulations prior to their promulgation, in part to insure that the federal agencies respect the values of state autonomy and federalism.77 If the Attorney General's supervision suffices to protect governors against picket fence federalism in the context of litigation, then why does not the OMB Director's supervision of the regulatory process insure that governors' interests will be respected by any private cause of action enforcing the regulation? Indeed, why have the courts intervened to enforce Printz's anti- commandeering rule or Lopez's rule of enumerated federal powers, if state politicians have so much influence over federal elected officials? 74.

I have no such account, although I can certainly cook up plausible hypotheses. It may be that specialized interest groups have a lower profile in litigation, allowing more abstract, long-term interests like federalism to assert themselves: Aside from occasional amicus briefs, such groups might simply be invisible in the courtroom whereas they are dominant in congressional and administrative hearings. Likewise, the U.S. Attorney General might resist the pressure of client groups benefitting from federal regulation better than more specialized federal agencies. On the other side, the state government's attorney general might be better able to represent the state's general autonomy interests in litigation than in lobbying, because he or she plays a particular professional role in litigation that insulates his or her decisions from interest group pressure. Thus, a "liberal" state attorney general might be willing to oppose even a "liberal" federal mandate in the courtroom where she would be reluctant to do so when lobbying Congress. But I have no evidence for either of these propositions. Lacking evidence, I remain agnostic about whether the "plan waiver" exception makes functional sense. Rather than make dogmatic pronouncements, I would urge empirical investigation of how states' interests are represented in litigation. As Professor Caminker has noted, originalist or "reconstructionist" methodology has so dominated this area of jurisprudence that such empirical questions are rarely asked, let alone answered.78 It is time that they are put front and center. B. Why Allow Private Causes of Action to Enforce Conditions on Federal Grants-in-Aid? The second major exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity concerns private causes of action to enforce the conditions on federal grants-in-aid. Private persons can sometimes enforce such conditions regardless of the Eleventh Amendment on the theory that states waive their immunity by accepting federal grants. The statute creating the grant, however, must be "unmistakably clear" that waiver of sovereign immunity is a condition for receiving federal grants.79 Critics of this jurisprudence frequently argue that states have no practical freedom to decline federal money, so that their "consent" to the conditions attached to federal grants is more formal than truly voluntary. This argument, however, is overbroad. While it is true that states rarely decline federal dollars, it is also true that federal grants are designed with the likely reaction of state 78. Caminker, supra note 74, at 131-32. 79. Atascadero State Hosp. v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 242 (1985); see also Dellmuth v. Muth, 491 U.S. 223, 230 (1989); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 673 (1974).</page><page sequence="31">May 2001] CURBING BUREAUCRATIC POWER 1255 governments in mind: "[I]n plotting their actions, federal and state bargainers implicitly take each other into account without explicit exchange."80 Because both federal agencies and Congress want states to accept the grants, they design the conditions to be lenient. The casual way in which states forfeit millions of dollars of federal grants, either by not complying with conditions, not applying for available money, or refusing to apply for waivers of grant conditions, provides anecdotal evidence that states can take it or leave it alone.8' The strongest case that federal grant conditions present states with no real choice applies to those "cross-cutting" conditions that apply to all federal grant programs and all recipients of federal money. These conditions include the Davis-Bacon Act (requiring payment of the "prevailing wage" to all labor employed on federally funded projects), section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (requiring reasonable accommodation of disabled persons by agencies receiving federal funds), and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (barring racial discrimination by recipients of federal funds). Because they govern eligibility for all federal grants, such conditions seem practically impossible for states to decline short of opting out of the entire intergovernmental system. Yet precisely because these grant conditions are so broad, it is especially unlikely that their interpretation or enforcement will be affected by picket fence federalism. By definition, the conditions usually cut across the special mission of any particular agency. It is unlikely that the Department of Defense, for instance, is especially obsessed with banning all racially discriminatory effects resulting from its giveaway of military bases to local governments: Neither the training or professional culture of Pentagon bureaucrats instills in them any extraordinary zeal to eradicate such effects, even if a strong argument can be made that they violate Title VI. One might worry more about under- enforcement rather than over-enforcement of such cross-cutting conditions by federal agencies, because such agencies have persistent incentives to insure that state and local governments continue to accept the grants that they administer, even at the cost of overlooking a few defaults on the intergovernmental deal. There are, of course, federal agencies that have the special mission of enforcing cross-cutting conditions in particular contexts. For instance, the Office of Civil Rights in the Department of Education has a special mandate to enforce Title VI and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act against schools that accept federal grants. But there is less evidence that state agencies share this 80. Ingram, supra note 29, at 502. 81. For evidence that cities refuse to apply for federal money even though they are eligible for it, see MICHAEL J. RICH, FEDERAL POLICYMAKING AND THE POOR: NATIONAL GOALS, LOCAL CHOICES, AND DISTRIBUTIONAL OUTCOMES 233-34 (1993). Rich examined cities' refusal to apply for money that required local redistribution. But states also seem to reject even infrastructure money lacking such redistributive conditions. Consider, for instance, Colorado's refusal to ban open alcoholic beverages in cars or enact mandatory seat- belt laws, even though these positions cost the state millions in federal highway money. State Capitals Newsletter, supra note 54, at 5.</page><page sequence="32">1256 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 53:1225 cross-cutting sense of mission or collude with federal agencies to over-enforce such mandates. This is especially true because state politicians tend to keep a closer eye on state agency specialists who enforce controversial redistributive programs. Indeed, redistributive grants are precisely the grants that state governments are most willing to forego, because they so directly contradict the state politicians' incentives to engage in economic development. In short, there are circumstances that mitigate the threat of picket fence federalism in the context of cross-cutting conditions on federal grants, and these circumstances might suffice to justify private causes of action to enforce such grant conditions. Moreover, courts frequently bar any private cause of action to enforce those grant conditions, especially when those conditions define the general systemic structure or standards of state agency decision-making.82 These are the sorts of conditions that most threaten state politicians' control of state agencies. By requiring that federal grants be administered by a "single agency" staffed by specially trained professionals, federal grants can liberate the state bureaucracy from political control. But it is precisely these conditions that are generally unenforceable by private causes of action.83 The only remedy for violations of these "structural" grant conditions is generally the federal agency's suspension of grant payments to the counterpart state agency. This monetary remedy, however, has precisely the same effect as an injunction against the agency: Rather than affect the states' budget generally, the withdrawal of federal grant money affects only the budget of the state agency receiving the grant. Given that federal agencies have a mission to foster their state counterpart agencies, it should not be surprising that federal agencies have been hugely reluctant to suspend grant payments. C. Why Allow Congress to Abrogate State Immunity with Enforcement Power of the Fourteenth Amendment? Congress has the power to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity by enacting legislation that "appropriately" enforces the Civil War Amendments.84 Does this power have any relation to the concern with picket fence federalism? The central danger of picket fence federalism is that federal law will liberate state bureaucrats from the control of elected state officials. But this possibility is only threatening if one trusts majoritarian control more than bureaucratic control. If one worries that state government is too responsive to the electorate, then picket fence federalism is not threatening but promising: Promotion of an independent state bureaucracy devoted to federal ideals of 82. See, e.g., Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 348 (1997) (holding that Title IV-D does not give individuals federal right to force state agency to comply with its provisions). 83. See, e.g., Graus v. Kaladajian, 2 F. Supp. 2d 540, 544 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (holding that a single-agency requirement does not give rise to a private enforcement action). 84. See note 70 supra and accompanying text.</page><page sequence="33">May 2001] CURBING BUREA UCRA TIC POWER 1257 equality or liberty may be the best institutional mechanism for enforcing the Fourteenth Amendment. It is a banality to suggest that the Fourteenth Amendment is concerned with curbing local majoritarianism. Despite the fact that it predates the Civil War Amendments, Madison's Federalist #10 presciently provides the classic theoretical justification for such a limit on majority power. Madison's familiar argument rests on the populist advantages of state politics: The greater homogeneity and smaller size of state populations increases the possibility that a state government can be taken over by a single majority "faction." These institutional conditions are advantages in controlling bureaucracy, but they are liabilities when they magnify popular prejudice in ways that run afoul of national notions of equality. These considerations suggest that the Fourteenth Amendment's exception to the Eleventh Amendment is functionally sensible. If my theory concerning the state budgetary process is correct, then the exception enables the Federal government to promote a state bureaucracy that is sympathetic to federal equality norns. As I suggested in Part II, private lawsuits for damages against the state treasury improve state bureaucrats' ability to get more resources rather than simply reshuffle the appropriation that they already have. If one suspects that certain groups get systematically short-changed in the struggle for state revenue, then this empowering of bureaucracy is not a bad thing but a good thing. The federal mandates that fall most easily under the Fourteenth Amendment rubric will be federal laws concerning education and public schools. These include the requirements that states provide equal educational opportunity to racial minorities, linguistic minorities, and disabled children. Congress has advanced all of these mandates through conditional grants (including "cross-cutting" conditions like section 504 and Title VI), but it does not hurt to allow Congress to impose such egalitarian duties directly and unconditionally on state governments. The critical question is figuring out what it means for a group to be "unfairly" short-changed in the state's political process. I have no intention of entering into this well-cratered battlefield. The Court has apparently concluded that women, the elderly, and the disabled are well served by state legislatures.85 The only modest point I wish to make is that the theory underlying the Fourteenth Amendment exception to the Eleventh Amendment doctrine is functionally consistent with the anti-bureaucracy theory that I lay out here.86 85. See United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598, 627 (2000) (rejecting Fourteenth Amendment authority for a federal statute combatting gender-motivated violence); Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 82-83 (2000) (rejecting Fourteenth Amendment authority for the Age Discrimination in Employment Act); Bd. of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 121 S. Ct. 955, 148 L.Ed.2d 866 (2001). 86. Ideally, one might want to integrate the Fourteenth Amendment "political process" inquiry with the "political safeguards" theory of federalism. As several commentators have noted, the question of whether some group is "well-represented" in legislative processes is</page><page sequence="34">1258 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 53:1225 CONCLUSION The thesis of this article is perhaps embarrassingly modest. I maintain only that a ban on damages liability makes sense if one believes that state agencies cannot be trusted to represent the interests of state politicians in the intergovernmental process of litigation and administration. By making injunctions the exclusive remedy for federal statutes, Eleventh Amendment doctrine allows the state legislature to focus all of the cost of federal mandates on those state agencies that encourage them. There are other considerations besides state oversight of state agencies' budgets, not least of which is fully adequate remedies for those persons burdened by state violations of federal law. Whether these considerations should "outweigh" the functional justification for Eleventh Amendment doctrine laid out here is a question to which I do not pretend to have an answer. theoretically incoherent until one has specified how much political clout the group ought to have. See, e.g., Laurence Tribe, The Puzzling Persistence of Process-Based Theories, 89 YALE L.J. 1063, 1073 (1980). All "political process" theories, therefore, require some (often murky and unarticulated) substantive theory of "fairness." One might shed a bit of light on the question by treating the question as a comparative one by integrating the "political safeguards of federalism" theory with the "political process" theory of equality. When Congress enacts a law under its power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment, one could ask whether the group that Congress seeks to protect is as well-represented in the states' political processes as the state governments are represented in Congress. If the answer is "no," then this provides some reason to force the states to rely on the political safeguards of federalism rather than on the judiciary. After all, the states can hardly be heard to complain about their treatment at the hands of Congress when interest groups receive the same sort of treatment from the state legislature. On the other hand, if some interest group is better represented in the state legislature than the state governments are represented in Congress, then it is difficult to see why Congress needs to protect them from local majoritarianism. National majoritarianism against state governments would seem to be more of a danger.</page></plain_text>
