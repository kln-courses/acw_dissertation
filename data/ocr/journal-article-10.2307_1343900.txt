Jones Meet the (De)Composer Buckminster Fuller once described the breakfasts he enjoyed with John Cage and Merce Cunningham during the summer of 1948, under the groves of yellow pine at that experiment in American education, Black Mountain College: We really did have a great deal of fun because I spent that summer with them on a fun, schematic new school [I called] "the finishing school." We would finish anything.... We would really break down all of the conventional ways of approaching school. And the finishing school was going to be a caravan, and we would travel from city to city, and it would be posted outside of the city that the finishing school was coming.' This paper originated in a talk given at the conference and symposium organized to celebrate John Cage's eightieth birthday and visit to Stanford University in January of 1992.

School of finish, and of finishing off. This was the summer Cage's aesthetic matured-the summer when Cage, Fuller, and other agitating influences amused themselves by imagining what they would finish next. After Western music (Beethoven) and Western archi- tecture (the Greeks), they felt sure they could "finish anything" and imag- ined hiring themselves out for the job. It seems paradoxical to speak of Cage and "finish" in the same breath-Cage, the champion of indeterminacy, open-endedness, and chance. Particularly now, after his death, he will be canonized as the staunchest leader of our heroic American avant-garde, opposed in every way to the bourgeois notions of lefini seen to undergird academicism since the days of Colbert and Bouguereau. And certainly Cage was opposed to "finish" in his life and work, if by finish we mean the polishing of form to effect a transparency of medium. It is this cosmetic and embalming finish that he addressed in 1949 in the artist-run journal The Tiger's Eye, writing: "A finished work is exactly that, requires resurrection."2 But the other side of "finishing school" is echoed in Cage's comment, in the same essay in The Tiger's Eye, that "schools teach ... classical harmony. Outside school, ... a different and correct structural means reappears" ("F," p. 172). This finishing school-this caravan roaming at the outskirts of town, at the boundaries of civilization-is a more appropriate vehicle for Cage's early aims: to finish school and emerge into a new independence from aca- demic forms; tofinish off the dead, the ossified, or the moribund; to resur- rect only what remained capable of life. This essay concerns just what it was that John Cage helped finish in the late 1940s and early 1950s and what kinds of spaces he cleared before he became the peaceful patron saint of our avant-garde heaven.3 My observations here allude to much larger stories that can only be told elsewhere-stories about the ending of Europe, the death of fathers, the making of Americans.4 Norman O.

Jones Cage and the Abstract Expressionist Ego that "we know all we need to know about Oedipus, Prometheus, Hamlet"; but, wisely, he preceded this by observing that "Cage in 1959 is not the same as Cage in 1974."5 For my own essay (begun on the occasion of Cage's eightieth birthday and finished shortly after his death), I want to return to that earlier time lest we forget Oedipus, Prometheus, and Ham- let. Americans in their making have rarely forgotten those fierce sons or failed to emulate them in their struggles to carve a culture from within the colonial outpost of an aging empire. In his early compositions-verbal and musical-Cage engaged, among other things, the problematic of the abstract expressionist ego.6 His critique was both explicit and implicit, operating by word, deed, and negativity to address what would come to appear hegemonic in American modernism of the 1950s: the cultural construction of the artist as a mascu- line solitary, his artwork as a pure statement of individual genius and autonomous will.7 Cage's critical modes, the how of his "finishing school," constitute the central subject of this essay. Pursuing the trajectory of his career in its cultural context, I first view Cage's search for technology as a way of countering, or complicating, the abstract expressionist ego in its search for a natural sublime. Second, I examine the functions of Cagean silence in addressing that same ego, exploring Cage's multiple equations of silence with nothingness, death, life, the sound of Others, the with- drawal of the body, the hiding of beauty, the absence of ego, and the birth of unintention. Finally, I view the presence of silence in Cage's work in relation to a potentially homosexual aesthetic, particularly as read in by the younger visual artists attracted to his work and ideas. Pilgrims of the Technological Sublime From differing beginning points, towards possibly different goals, technologists and artists ... meet by intersection ... imagining thesis, which suggests covert linkages at the deeper level of a resistant gay/lesbian aes- thetic, proved more problematic to the conference organizers and participants. I take this problematic as my problematic: how an absence or negativity can function to convey mean- ing in cultural texts. 5. Norman O. Brown, "John Cage," in John Cage at Seventy-Five, ed. Richard Fleming and William Duckworth (Lewisburg, Pa., 1989), pp. 105, 104. 6. I use the term problematic because this discursively produced and culturally main- tained subjectivity, with its countless historical shifts, could never be firmly secured. The abstract expressionist ego should thus be read with scare quotes throughout this essay. 7. Michael Leja has offered a nuanced reading of this dominant abstract expressionist subjectivity in his book, Reframing Abstract Expressionism: Subjectivity and Painting in the 1940s (New Haven, Conn., 1993). I am grateful to Leja for sharing his introductory essay and helping establish the shifting terms negotiated in constructing what I term the abstract expressionist ego.</page><page sequence="4">Critical Inquiry Summer 1993 631 brightly a common goal in the world and in the quietness within each human being. -CAGE, "Forerunners of Modern Music" (1949) Cage was photographed at Black Mountain in 1948, that summer of breakfasts for the "finishing school," sporting a spiky outgrown brushcut (fig. 1). This distinctive haircut, determined by a wartime military culture but located raffishly outside its disciplined parameters, later earned him the sobriquet "Frankenstein" among an adoring Italian public.8 Was Frankenstein Cage, manipulating tapes in a Milanese radio station, or his "monstrous" progeny, the odd electronic music broadcast through town? Was Frankenstein the mechanical monster, or his scientist-maker? Both, in any case, were pilgrims of the technological sublime, that romance Leo Marx has explicated as part and parcel of the American dream.9 The ten- sion between the hushed, primordial wilderness and the noisy technolo- gies we bring to "improve" it is the fueling dynamic of American culture, and it occupied Cage from the very beginning: "'[I saw] my function ... as an inventor and research worker rather than as an artist. I had been very much influenced by ... the need to apply modern technology to music' " (BB, pp. 90-91). Cage's famous production of the prepared piano in 1940 exemplifies the intervention of the mechanical into the organic. Despite the piano's highly technological manufacture, it presents a body that con- ceals a metallic, mechanical interior in a sheath of organic wood and ivory (an android rather than a cyborg). Modest Victorians saw the piano's body in such anthropomorphic terms, clothing its naked legs in decent draper- ies.'0 Cage's determination to open the piano's cabinet and to reveal and manipulate its steel strings with a variety of foreign objects was an 8. The full nickname "the good-looking Frankenstein" was given him by the Italian press in 1958 when Cage was in Milan, composing experimental music on tape and compet- ing on a televised quiz show (quoted in Calvin Tomkins, The Bride and the Bachelors: Five Masters of the Avant-Garde [New York, 1965], p. 132; hereafter abbreviated BB). Clearly meant to be affectionate, the nickname is nonetheless revealing of European attitudes toward postwar Americans (creators of the A-bomb), whose technophilia could assume monstrous proportions. 9. See Leo Marx, The Machine in the Garden: Technology and the Pastoral Ideal in America (Oxford, 1964). See particularly Marx's discussion of Melville's Ahab and the technologi- cal sublime (pp. 294-95) and his argument that Melville, by using machine imagery to relate the butchery of whaling to the violence of Western civilization, speaks to "the contra- diction at the heart of a culture that would deify the Nature it is engaged in plundering" (p. 301). As Marx put it more recently, "'the rhetoric of the technological sublime' " is "a rhet- oric designed to invest secular images of technology with the capacity to evoke emotions- awe, wonder, mystery, fear-formerly reserved for images of boundless nature or for representing a response to divinity" (Marx, "Does Pastoralism Have a Future?" in The Pasto- ral Landscape, ed. John Dixon Hunt [Washington, D.C., 1992], p. 225). 10. For one discussion of the piano's technology, see Edwin M.

[but] to selflessness" ("F," pp. 175-76).12 Cage's first mature statement, the prepared piano of 1940, already exemplified this belief in a mechanistic antidote to ego. It was an instrument built, in part, to speak the bold vernacular of the technological sublime. Cage, son of an inventor, brought this most American enterprise to music. Several of his earliest compositions were titled "Inventions"; he compares an early "claim" for his music to a patent specification claim.'3 But his earliest innovation, the prepared piano, suggested the creative tin- kering celebrated as Yankee ingenuity rather than the entrepreneurial capitalism of Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, and the like. Others, notably Cage's own mentor Henry Cowell, had experimented with the percussive capabilities of the piano, but Cage concretized such whimsies, taking them further away from improvisatory performance to embed them in the tech- nology of the piano itself.'4 By inserting nuts, bolts, screws, and other mechanical (Frankensteinian?) bits under the strings, Cage altered their timbre and emphasized their percussive capabilities. He also rendered them unsuitable as vehicles for the vocal and instrumental traditions of Western harmony, putting listeners in mind of the Balinese gamelan.'5 The artificially normative consonance of the piano's steel strings, deter- 12.

Cage composed "Six Short Inventions" in 1932-33. The notion of a musical "invention" also has its source in Bach and other earlier composers celebrating authorial creation over a mimicry of nature; Cage is playing with both senses here. "Claim," a section of Cage's "Forerunners of Modern Music," reads: "Any sounds of any qualities and pitches (known or unknown, definite or indefinite), any contexts of these, simple or multiple, are natural and conceivable within a rhythmic structure which equally embraces silence. Such a claim is remarkably like the claims to be found in patent-specifications for and articles about technological musical means" ("F," p. 175). 14. Cage recalled seeing Cowell perform: "He used a darning egg, moving it length- wise along the strings while trilling ... on the keyboard" (Cage, "How the Piano Came to Be Prepared," Empty Words: Writings '73-'78 by John Cage [Middletown, Conn., 1979], p. 7). Cowell's piece The Banshee (1925) was notable for its improvisatory use of the piano's insides. Cowell wrote in 1952, Cage "got an idea by knowing my own things.... and he took it up and prepared the strings, which I had never done" (quoted in David Revill, The Roaring Silence: John Cage: A Life [New York, 1992], pp. 69-71). 15. "The prepared piano ... converted the piano to a percussion instrument without harmonies" (Harris, The Arts at Black Mountain College, p. 154). See also Cage's view that contemporary music composition was moving away from Western harmonics in Cage, "The East in the West," Modern Music 23 (Spring 1946):115. It was Virgil Thomson who com- pared the prepared piano to the "'Balinese gamelang orchestra'" (BB, p. 90).</page><page sequence="7">16. Sch6nberg's comment was apparently made to critic Peter Yates. Cage repeated the remark to interviewer Jeff Goldberg in 1976; see Jeff Goldberg, "John Cage Inter- view," in Conversing with Cage, ed. Richard Kostelanetz (New York, 1988), p. 6. 17. Tomkins dates the composition of Bacchanale to 1938, but both Griffiths and Revill give the date of March 1940, from notations on the score. See C, p. 13 and Revill, Roaring Silence, p. 69. Griffiths notes the composition calls for a piano prepared with "one small bolt, one screw with nuts, and eleven pieces of fibrous weather stripping" (C, p. 13). 18. To the phrase "the use of technological means" Cage appends a footnote citing the Swiss painter Paul Klee: "I want to be as though new-born, knowing nothing, absolutely nothing about Europe." Thus, at this point, technology was identified as the absolute nega- tion of European culture and tradition (quoted in "F," p. 175). 634 Caroline A. Jones Cage and the Abstract Expressionist Ego mined by manufacturers and enforced by piano tuners, was irrevocably disrupted. The sonorous piano was changed from a potentially tonal instrument, evoking the harmonic range of a full orchestra, to a pinging, chiming, gently clamorous sound machine. Arnold Sch6nberg, presum- ably in reference to this feat, referred to his former student Cage not as a composer but as "'an inventor-of genius' " (BB, p. 85).16 If the prepared piano emerged from Cage's Frankensteinian search for the technological sublime-"imagining brightly a common goal" with technologists-it also had other contexts. For the altered instrument was invented specifically to provide accompaniment for the choreography of Syvilla Fort, an African-American dancer at the Cornish School in Seattle where Cage was working at the time. The ballet, called Bacchanale, was to be held in March 1940, and Cage recalled it as "'rather primitive, almost barbaric' " (BB, p. 89).17 In search of a correspondingly "primitive" effect, he wanted to use the all-percussion orchestra he had assembled out of tin cans, hubcaps, brake drums, and other mechanical detritus (rattletrap American good-enough engineering versus cultured European crafts- manship).18 But these gustatory and vehicular remnants required several performers and more space than Fort could spare on stage. Cage's solu- tion, the percussive prepared piano, was simple and technological. It pro- duced the unsettling effects required, in a fixed yet portable device capable of repetition and control. Cage's first mature act of artistic inde- pendence from European music (represented in its rarified avant-garde form by Schonberg's twelve-tone system) was thus achieved via primitivism, through a lowly tinkerer's technology of nuts, bolts, and wires. Despite Fort's mythological title for her dance, with its echoes of the scandalous European high modernism of Nijinsky's L'Apreis-Midi d'un faune, the "primitivism" and "technologism" of the music could be identi- fied by the participants as authentically native to the American soil. Primitivism has often been the avant-garde's first recourse to the problem of cultural tradition, of course, a "primitivism" read into the art of colonized, conquered, or merely Other cultures. But unlike the alien exoticism that Europeans sought for their paintings-for example, those African Grebo masks Picasso encountered in the Trocadero Museum and</page><page sequence="8">Critical Inquiry Summer 1993 635 painted "as a kind of exorcism" into his Les Demoiselles d'Avignon-Cage and contemporary painters such as Jackson Pollock found "barbarism" in their own country's past.19 At this point they were not so sensitive to the barbarism of the white invaders (although later Cage would feel this keenly). Their works echoed instead the great percussion traditions of African-American slave music (remanent in American jazz) and the pow- erful geometries of native American art.20 Particularly in this early part of his career, Cage was clearly aware of the parallels between his chosen revo- lution in music-self-described as durational rather than harmonic-and the rhythmic basis ofjazz.21 In 1949, he praised the work "outside school" by Satie and Webern, arguing that their "different and correct structural means" were based on lengths of time rather than classical harmony; in a footnote, he explains, "This [durational basis] never disappeared from jazz and folk-music. On the other hand, it never developed in them, for they are not cultivated species, growing best when left wild" ("F," p. 172 n. 3). Although Cage rarely appropriated such "wild" sources directly, his very efforts to shift Western music from tonality and functional harmony to an emphasis on indeterminacy and duration suggests a sophisticated recognition of the differences fueling American vernacular culture and an understanding of the momentum gained from harnessing such differ- ences for "high" art.22 19. On Picasso's "exorcism" via African art, see "Primitivism" in Twentieth-Century Art: Affinity of the Tribal and the Modern, ed. William Rubin, 2 vols. (New York, 1984), 1:260. With specific reference to Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, see Leo Steinberg, "The Philosophical Brothel, Part 1," Art News 71 (Sept. 1972): 20-29, and Mary Mathews Gedo, Picasso: Art as Autobiography (Chicago, 1980). 20. The issue of tribal or minority cultures as sources for "high" art is a vexatious one, which Jim Clifford addressed directly in his critique of the Museum of Modern Art's "Primitivism" exhibition and catalogue. See James Clifford, The Predicament of Culture: Twentieth-Century Ethnography, Literature, and Art (Cambridge, Mass., 1988). See also John Yau, "Please Wait by the Coatroom" and other essays in Out There: Marginalization and Con- temporary Cultures, ed. Russell Ferguson et al. (New York, 1990), and The Myth of Primitivism: Perspectives on Art, ed. Susan Hiller (London, 1991). What is needed now is a nuanced reading of the cultural interplay in tribal art and a recognition of these supposedly "native" styles as sophisticated Creole systems operating between a dominant culture and multiple source vocabularies. This reading would make room, for example, for the pres- sures of the market on tribal art, exercised from the beginning through trading between tribes and, later, through Western-run trading posts. There is a reason why Navajo blanket styles are often named for the trading post with which they are associated (for example, Ganado), and jazz emanated from cities with great immigrant populations (Chicago, New Orleans, New York). The presence of klezmer in jazz, aniline-dyed red flannel fiber in Ganado chief blankets, or Venetian glass beads on Chippewa moccasins should complicate any reading of "native" American or African American art forms. 21. "Of the four characteristics of sound, only duration involves both sound and silence. Therefore, a structure based on durations... is correct, ... whereas harmonic structure is incorrect" ("F," p. 172 n. 2; emphasis added). 22. Cage, like the cultural critics of the Frankfurt school, was not drawn to jazz in per- formance; as I note below, his interest in vernacular noise always stopped at the established</page><page sequence="9">636 Caroline A. Jones Cage and the Abstract Expressionist Ego It was in this spirit that Pollock praised "the formal qualities" of Navaho sand painters, and Barnett Newman celebrated the bold designs of Northwest Coast cultures such as the Kwakiutl. However problematic it may seem now to adapt and transform the art of dominated cultures for the production of an avant-garde aesthetic that sought its own kind of domination, adventurous Americans emerging from the self-perceived provincialism of the 1930s into the globalism during and after the Second World War thought of jazz and "American Indian" art as their own. They turned to "the primitive" not to escape from Europe (as had Picasso) but to discover and create (through a similar appropriation) the formal means for a truly American art.23 That said, however, there remained the perfume of exoticism in these works-primitivism without the quotes. Thus Cage's barbaric piano was inspired by an African American's dance, and thus Pollock and others sought to escape the rational and civilized through some shamanistic, ritu- alized, bodily engaged art.24 Contemporary journals such as Life and Art News published photographs of Pollock's rhythmic "dance" around the canvas. His unconventional engagement with the painting's surface, his boundaries of "high" culture. But in 1952, during this early period of his career, Cage actu- ally composed a piece by fragmenting jazz recordings (as in, I note, the practice of 1980s and 1990s African-American rap composers/break dancers/hip-hop musicians). The piece, Imaginary Landscape No. 5, was his first on tape. Griffiths writes of Cage's '"jazz- tinged piano" in compositions from the early 1940s, around the same time that Bacchanale was written (C, p. 15). For a discussion of the ambivalent relationship between American intellectuals and jazz, see Andrew Ross, "Hip, and the Long Front of Color," No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture (New York, 1989), pp. 65-101. 23. Of course, as white male artists, painters such as Stuart Davis and musicians such as Tommy Dorsey were empowered to produce this "American" art and their black colleagues were not. On the presence of a generalized (and generative) "blues aesthetic" in American culture, see Houston A. Baker, Jr., Blues, Ideology, and Afro-American Literature: A Vernacular Theory (Chicago, 1984). 24. That Cage was directly responding to Syvilla Fort and her dance in his composition should be clear. Even at the end of his life, when years of simultaneous but uncdnnected music for Merce Cunningham's dances suggested some kind of indifference, Cage recounted a telling anecdote about himself and Karlheinz Stockhausen: "once i was with karlheinz we were just walking in cologne and he said if you were writing a song would you write music or would you write for the singer i said i would write for the singer he said well that's the difference between us i would write music" (Cage, I-VI [Cambridge, Mass., 1990], pp. 10-11). Cage did not see himself as primitive, of course; in this respect he was quite dif- ferent from Pollock, who flirted with a Brandoesque "caveman" image despite the intellectualism of his supporters. See Ellen G. Landau,Jackson Pollock (New York, 1989), p. 14. Sufficiently discomfited by this tendency of Pollock's, Cage declined to write the music for Hans Namuth's documentary on the painter, recommending Morton Feldman for the job. See Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith, Jackson Pollock: An American Saga (New York, 1989), p. 663. My argument is not that the two men were similar in their use or approach to the primitive but rather that both participated in this pervasive theme of American modernism.</page><page sequence="10">Critical Inquiry Summer 1993 637 entry into what critics termed "the arena" of the canvas, is witnessed fur- ther by the handprints appearing on the wall-sized canvases he was pro- ducing around 1948 (in particular, Number One, 1948). The handprints' link to ritual art lay in their evocation of the neolithic cave paintings recently exposed at Lascaux and Peche Merle; art world cognoscenti knew also of Pollock's statements praising native American sand paintings and read of his desires to be "more a part of the painting.., literally [to] be in the painting."25 This famous quote, in fact, is from the one and only issue of Possibilities, the journal founded by Robert Motherwell, Cage, and oth- ers that appeared in the winter of 1947-48.26 It is an indication of the flu- idity and expansiveness of avant-garde aesthetics at the time that both Cage and Pollock could occupy the same platform and seem to articulate related sensibilities.27 Neither the fluidity nor the expansiveness would last. Pollock would remain a central figure within the abstract expression- ist canon, and Cage would become the mentor for a younger generation now seen to oppose it. Cage, "the Club," and the Abstract Expressionist Ego That Cage was an important member of the abstract expressionist community went unsaid in 1948, but it needs emphasizing now. "I had," he recalled in 1965, "in the late '40s and the early 50s, been part and par- cel of the Artists Club."28 Described as "a loose social and aesthetic organi- zation where artists could meet to discuss issues of common interest," the 25. Jackson Pollock, "My Painting," Possibilities 1 (Winter 1947-48): 79. Cage makes reference the following year to Pollock's "sand painting" in "Forerunners of Modern Music," where he writes: "Just as art as sand-painting (art for the now-moment rather than for posterity's museum-civilization) becomes a held point of view, adventurous workers in the field of synthetic music ... find that for practical and economic reasons work with mag- netic wires (any music so made can quickly and easily be erased, rubbed-off) is preferable to that with film" ("F," p. 175). 26. The periodical was edited by Robert Motherwell (art), Harold Rosenberg (writ- ing), Pierre Chareau (architecture), and John Cage (music). Despite its survival for only one issue, Possibilities is described as "occup[ying] a pivotal position in the periodical lit- erature of Abstract Expressionism" (Gibson, "Possibilities: 'The Thing-without Theory,'" in Issues in Abstract Expressionism, p. 33). In addition to Possibilities, Cage's contribution to which Motherwell found uncharacteristically disappointing (see ibid., p. 34), Cage contrib- uted "Forerunners of Modern Music" to The Tiger's Eye and was himself the subject of Leon A. Kochnitzky, "The Three Magi of Contemporary Music," The Tiger's Eye 1 (Oct. 1947): 77-81. 27.

Jones Cage and the Abstract Expressionist Ego club began as the "Subjects of the Artist" school, evolving into "Studio 35" and finally "the Club." At its inception in the fall of 1949, the club had twenty members, swelling to eighty in less than a year.29 It became the pri- mary arbiter of what would be called abstract expressionism, its members even reluctantly endorsing the movement's name in a series of panel dis- cussions held in 1952.30 Cage was invited to contribute to important peri- odicals run by club members (such as The Tiger's Eye and, of course, Possibilities); he was twice asked to speak to club members on a subject of his choice. But the club, that loose affiliation of bohemians that was the closest thing to a New York school academy, was nonetheless ambivalent in its relation to Cage, and he to it. If the prepared piano had participated in an aesthetics of primitivism and sublimity (albeit a technophilic sublimity) that linked Cage to his generation of artists in New York, his subsequent move to silence and indeterminacy proved deeply alienating to the abstract expressionists attempting to hold onto the banner of the Ameri- can avant-garde. In the perpetual contest to control the meaning(s) of modernism, Cage came to occupy a radically different perspective from his cohort, serving to open a space for younger male artists whose names are legion (the list begins with Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns but continues to include Allan Kaprow, Robert Smithson, Robert Morris, Walter De Maria, and countless others).31 As I shall argue further below, it was the effigy of the Individual Ego that Cage burned in his meteoric rise to avant-garde heaven. It was only an effigy because criticism and the art world both work tirelessly to recuperate, protect, and construct a stable or "real" artistic ego forever fortified against efforts to deconstruct it. Indeed, it was the group of painters gathering at the club who struggled perhaps the most manfully to make this subjectivity real. As Michael Leja argues persuasively, the study of abstract expressionist subjectivities is par- ticularly rich, given that "this art took subjectivity as its explicit subject matter [and] offers an exceptionally clear picture of the dialectic within which subjects, including cultural producers, are shaped by various dis- courses and representations they encounter in their culture, which they then go on as active agents to inflect, reshape, and (mis)represent."32 My thesis in this essay is this: the critique of abstract expressionism by subse- quent generations of American artists was engaged primarily with this 29.

That these are all male artists may follow from the particular kind of space opened by Cage; the fact is also a function of the historical period (the 1960s), since women did not emerge with any force in the New York art world until the generalized climate of a feminist critique (in the 1970s) empowered them to do so. 32.

John Cage offered some of the first tools for its critique, which first took place, I argue, within a specific homosexual aesthetic.33 Cage came with his own perspective to the New York art scene of the late 1940s, having already made friends and traded ideas with West Coast avant-gardists Mark Tobey and Morris Graves. Their interest in Oriental philosophies and tribal cultures, and Tobey's all-over, calligraphic "white writing," gave Cage a particularly sophisticated angle on the abstract expressionist interest in a native, American primitivism (achieved via a native American "primitivism"). Seattle, where Cage met Tobey and Graves (as well as Cunningham, who would become his lifelong compan- ion), is far from Europe and its anxieties about tradition; it is a misty sea town, named for an Indian chief and full of spectacular tribal art. Graves, like the Northwest tribal cultures he studied, believed that the spirits of animals could be summoned by art; he retained representation in his work long after the New York school painters had become resolutely abstract. Although Tobey's "white writing" was more readily assimilated to the abstract expressionist model of all-over painting, he, too, held onto repre- sentation, burying small figures in his webs of paint as if loathe to give up entirely the blooming, buzzing physical world. This set the Western avant- gardists apart from the New York painters' all-but-iconoclastic rejection of the outside world. Where West Coast painters retained their interest in an external referent, the New York school artists were seen to have abandoned referentiality in favor of a deeply imagined inner state of being. Briefly put, the subjectivity of the New York school abstract expres- sionist was constructed in the American culture of the late 1940s and early 1950s as that of an isolated, autochthonic, angst-ridden male genius, alter- nating between bouts of melancholic depression and volcanic creativity. Although early modernism contained many alternative modes of produc- tion, including collective and anarchic ones, the variant of modernism that became canonical in the United States during the cold war period cel- ebrated the artist as a masculine solitary whose staunchly heterosexual libido drove his brush.34 Pollock was the quintessential hero of this power- 33. See below for my discussion of the implications of the term homosexual aesthetic and my efforts to use it in a nonessentializing way. 34. Such constructions were always unstable. Even during the mid-1950s, when abstract expressionism was well on its way to becoming the American national (heterosex- ual) style, the club included figures such as Frank O'Hara, who was fairly open about his homosexuality. But as gay theorists have established (and I am thinking here of the work of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick in her books Between Men: English Literature and Male Homosocial</page><page sequence="13">640 Caroline A. Jones Cage and the Abstract Expressionist Ego ful mythos, but even the hyperintellectual Ad Reinhardt could be por- trayed in such terms."5 The gestural paintings of such artists as Franz Kline and Willem de Kooning built on this romantic scaffolding and were understood at the time as records of a spontaneous encounter with the canvas, existential acts summoned with great courage from the depths of the subconscious self. As Pollock said, "Painting is self-discovery. Every good artist paints what he is."36 Another position was occupied by the abstract expressionist field painters, whose visual and verbal works constructed the creative ego somewhat differently. Still emphasizing the isolation of the creative act and the awesome, even Nietzschean power of will required to conquer the forces of destruction, such painters as Newman and Reinhardt saw their paintings as opening the viewer to a deepened sense of self. In Newman's words: The painting should give man a sense of place: that he knows he's there, so he's aware of himself. In that sense he relates to me when I made the painting because in that sense I was there.... I hope that my painting has the impact of giving someone, as it did me, the feeling of his own totality, of his own separateness, of his own individuality.37 A few quotes from journalists and essayists, writing in both big and little magazines of the day, further suggest the dominance of this mode of interpellation; even hostile critics in the popular press reinforced the ide- ology of supersaturated individualism: "Until psychology digs deeper into the workings of the creative act the spectator can only respond, in one way or another, to the gruff, turgid, sporadically vital reelings and writings of Pollock's inner-directed art"; or, even less sympathetic, "In fleeing from the machine and the terrors of the man-made world, we have plunged into Desire [New York, 1985] and Epistemology of the Closet [Berkeley, 1990]), the presence of homosexuality within an intensely homosocial masculinist discourse should not surprise us. On the social construction of all these categories, see Forms ofDesire: Sexual Orientation and the Social Constructionist Controversy, ed. Edward Stein (New York, 1990). Without interro- gating the sexual identities or gender aspects of the abstract expressionists, Serge Guilbaut does an excellent job of charting the canonization and depoliticization of modernism in postwar America in his polemical How New York Stole the Idea of Modern Art: Abstract Expres- sionism, Freedom, and the Cold War (Chicago, 1983). 35.

Every least gesture of the brush becomes a revelation, and our pessimism regarding the psyche is such that, the cruder the gesture, the greater the revelation.""38 Even more sophisticated authors, such as Clement Greenberg, who sought to distance themselves from psychological analyses of the new art, reinforced the pre- vailing image of the lonely, marginalized artist. Here is Greenberg, writ- ing for British readers in 1947: The fate of American art is being decided ... by young people, few of them over forty, who live in cold-water flats and exist from hand to mouth.... [They] have no reputations that extend beyond a small circle of fanatics, art-fixated misfits who are as isolated in the United States as if they were living in Paleolithic Europe. ... What we have ... is the ferocious struggle to be a genius.... Alas, the future of American art depends on them. That it should is fitting but sad. Their isolation is inconceivable, crushing, unbroken, damning.39 Harold Rosenberg, whose commitment to existentialism led him, famously, to declare that the abstract expressionist painting was "not a pic- ture but an event," extended the metaphor of isolation to include the art as well as the artist: "The gesture on the canvas was a gesture of liberation from Value-political, esthetic, moral.... The lone artist did not want the world to be different, he wanted his canvas to be a world."40 The painter William Baziotes had earlier articulated such a position, writing in 1949: "when the demagogues of art call on you to make the social art, the intelli- gible art, the good art-spit down on them, and go back to your dreams: the world-and your mirror.'"41 To round out this sketch of the subjectivities identified here as the abstract expressionist ego, I turn to Robert Motherwell, historian and intellectual of the New York school, and Cage's collaborator on Possibili- ties. Motherwell had also founded, with Clyfford Still, the famous Subjects of the Artist school discussed above, the source for all subsequent discus- sion groups of the abstract expressionist avant-garde in New York.42 The 38.

In his signature works (figs. 2 and 3), the still-vital genitals of Pancho Villa (Mexico's romantic revolutionary outlaw) become enlarged to gigantic scale to form the cojones of Motherwell's "Elegy to the Spanish Republic" series.45 The subject of the artist, here, is the subjugated but latent 43.

How superbly ironic, then, that Cage, invited by Motherwell in 1949 to speak to the prestigious Artists Club, meeting in the space of the former Subjects of the Artists school, chose to give a "Lecture on Nothing." Among the listeners were aging dadaists such as Richard Huelsenbeck, who would not have blinked at Cage's nihilistic agenda, but the dominant abstract expressionists in the group may have recognized themselves as the bull's-eye in Cage's target. To that audience, obsessed with subjects, Cage offered subjectlessness; to men captivated like Narcissus with their own bodies' parts, a bodiless philosophy; to the protectively arrogant leaders of the New York school, an exercise in Zen discipline and discipleship. Cage, with his sometimes impish, sometimes beatific smile, finished much that evening. Acting as the Zen master to the emerging heroes of the Ameri- can avant-garde, he answered all questions with "one of six previously Hemingway before him, never surpassed the intensity of feeling provoked in him by Spain's twin traditions of republican politics and brutally enforced centralized power.</page><page sequence="17">644 Caroline A. Jones Cage and the Abstract Expressionist Ego prepared answers regardless of the question asked."'46 "I have nothing to say/ and I am saying it."47 We can practically hear the cleansing fire crack- ling through the underbrush. But Cage's madness (his anger and his dadaist folly) had its method (as always). To his less-than-rapt auditors-one of whom "stood up part way through, screamed, and then said, 'John, I dearly love you, but I can't bear another minute' "48-Cage intoned: "Arizona/ is ... almost too interesting/,/ especially/ for a New-Yorker/ who is being interested/ in spite of himself/ in everything" ("LN," p. 110). Here, Cage's private Ari- zona might be an artist like Still, self-styled pioneer from the Dakota plains, whose paintings figured the dramatic crags and escarpments of the natural sublime, a landscape identified with the body of the artist and writ large on the abstract expressionist canvas.49 Against such epic egotism, Cage reminded his listeners that the subjects being obsessed about were not trapped within the subconscious, in need of extrication, or figured in the body of the artist; rather, they were all around, to be discovered in sim- ple, silent wonder at the world. The "nothing" in Cage's lecture was, preeminently, silence: "What we re-quire / is silence" ("LN," p. 109), and silence was actively, even maddeningly, inserted between words and phrases, breaking them out of meaning into an ordered but nonsyntactical rhythm, a light snowfall of phonemes falling in empty space. Without duplicating the columnar typography that Cage used in his text to enforce visual equivalents for his verbal silence, I suggest the space here through slashes, which should be read as beats, gaps, and caesurae measuring the text: "But/ now/ there are silences/ and the/ words/ make/ help make/ the/ silences" ("LN," p. 109). The function of silence is thus the central theme of the "Lecture on Nothing"; Cage chose it to characterize his first major collection of writ- ings in which "Lecture" is included, the eponymous Silence of 1961. "We need not fear these/ silences,-/ we may love them" ("LN," pp. 109-10; my emphasis). There were other nothings beside Cage's in 1949 and gaps other than silence that his audience might have expected to encounter that night. Most obviously, there was the existential abyss figured by Jean-Paul Sartre's Being and Nothingness (1943)-the great absence figured by death. Existentialism, which had "replaced Freudian andJungian dogmas as an intellectual frame of reference" among New York school painters, 46.

In addition to Motherwell's phallus and testicles, I am thinking of Still's cryptic self-portrait, 1946-L (now at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art) as ready examples of the covert priapic figure in abstract expressionist paintings.</page><page sequence="18">Critical Inquiry Summer 1993 645 gave meaning to nothingness, as Sartre's title suggests, precisely through a juxtaposition with Being, a contrast between action and death (which enforces the ultimate withdrawal of the body from action and serves as the terminus of possibility represented by Being).50 As Lithuanian-French philosopher Emmanuel Levinas put it in the discussion of existentialism published in the New York artist-run journal Instead, "do not the catego- ries of potency and act suffice to express this new notion of existence? ... Because every other possibility is fulfilled and becomes act, .... death becomes the non-reality, the non-being."51 The popular understanding of existentialism that operated in the abstract expressionist communities on both coasts was established by such writers as Levinas and Sartre, whose ideas were propagated in the New York artist-run journals; they were fur- ther popularized and given tremendous force by Rosenberg in his famous essay on "action painting"-a call for a quintessentially embodied gesture against the void of death's disembodiment.52 Above all, the abstract expressionist reading of existentialism emphasized the heroic individual artist, whose work would be a virtual instantiation of "potency and act." As one American writer in 1958 summarized it, existentialism forced a con- frontation with "the impotence of reason confronted with the depths of existence; the threat of Nothingness, and the solitary and unsheltered condition of the individual before this threat."53 50. See Sandler, The Triumph of American Painting, p. 98. 51. Emmanuel Levinas, in discussion with Jean Wahl, "An Essential Argument within Existentialism" (1946), trans. and ed. the editors of Instead, in Gibson, Issues in Abstract Expressionism, p. 303. This discussion originally appeared in volume 7 of Instead (ca. 1948). L vinas goes on to answer his own question in the negative, "I do not think so," and his sub- sequent statement about death is meant to gloss this position. As Levinas is at pains to make clear in this late 1940s defense of Heidegger as the "one and only existentialist," being is utterly at odds with death, since being and possibility are one, "so much so that at the moment of [possibility's] exhaustion we have death" (ibid., pp. 301, 303). Thus potency (as possibility) would, in Levinas's reading of Heidegger, be fully detached from the neces- sity for act. We now read Levinas very differently, seeing him through Derridean eyes as the rejector of Heidegger's view of death as "the ultimate test of virility and authenticity" and the alternative to Husserl's redefinition of phenomenology as "'egology' " (Se in Hand, introduction, The Livinas Reader, ed. Hand [Oxford, 1989], pp. 4, 2). We take instead the post-1950s Levinas as model, his ethical philosophy summarized by the elegant statement, "the idea of the Infinite is to be found in my responsibility for the Other" (Levinas, "Beyond Intentionality," in Philosophy in France Today, ed. Alan Montefiore [Cambridge, 1983], p. 113). 52. Apparently Pollock fed Rosenberg the idea of abstract expressionist painting as existentialist gesture; he himself got it from Newman, who presumably gleaned it from his voracious reading of the artist-run periodicals of the time. This is according to Rosenberg's rival, Clement Greenberg, interview with the author, 9 Oct. 1987. 53.

Jones Cage and the Abstract Expressionist Ego But although death was certainly part of Cage's bodiless "nothing," it was not all of it. Inactivity on the part of the artist, which amounted to death in the thinking of the "existence philosophers" (as Livinas called them), for Cage opened onto the untrammelled activity of the world. Writing for a lecture at Juilliard a few years after the famous "Lecture on Nothing," Cage presented fellow composer Morton Feldman as a coconspirator in the new search for silence and nothingness: The nothing/ that/ goes on/ is/ what/ Feldman/ speaks/ of/ when/ he speaks of/ being/ sub-merged/ in/ silence. / The/ acceptance/ of/ death/ is the source/ of/ all/ life./ ... Not one sound/ fears/ the silence/ that ex-tinguishes it./ And/ no silence/ exists/ that is not/ pregnant/ with/ sound.54 To the yawning existentialist void, Cage merely yawned. The death of action was to be confronted not with a terrified gesture of individual hero- ism but placid restraint. Nothingness was to be met not with a scream but with a "pregnant" silence. What gestated within that "pregnancy" and the location of the silent but gravid body itself are complex questions whose gender and sexual implications this essay can only begin to explore. Noise, Silence, and the Body "The highest responsibility of the artist is to hide beauty." -JOHN CAGE, quoting W. H. Blythe's Haiku, in "Juilliard Lecture" (1952) The first part-on what Cage finished-is finished. The second part-on what he began-is beginning. I turn from the prophylactic "nothing" to the celebratory "something" that ensued. In the 1949 "Lecture on Nothing," Cage already indicated what he would enjoy in the early work of Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns. He wrote (and presumably said): "I used noises/. / They had not been/ in-tellectualized;/ the ear could hear them/ directly/ and didn't have to go through any abstraction/ a-bout them/.... Noises, too/ , / had been dis-criminated against/; / and being American, ... I fought/ for noises" ("LN," pp. 116-17). What is the difference between music and noise? As Cage taught us, only the intervention of culture claims the one for amuse- 54.

Cage's reading of Feldman was, of course, highly willful. Feldman led a notoriously heterosexual life and remained much more closely identified with the abstract expressionists than Cage, culminating with his musical homage to Rothko, composed for the opening of the Rothko Chapel in Hous- ton, which was completed in 1979.</page><page sequence="20">Critical Inquiry Summer 1993 647 ment and decries the other as annoying. Silence gives form to them both and room for the sounds and activities of others. This was Cage's revela- tion, and the work of these two younger painters struck, as it were, sympa- thetic chords. As against the natural, heroic sublime of the abstract expressionist painters, Johns and Rauschenberg moved toward the quotidian. They substituted found objects and found images, bracketed and made strange to convey the violence of the everyday. In Rauschenberg's devas- tated, unmade Bed (fig. 4), and the strange casts of body parts in Johns's Target with Plaster Casts (fig. 5), there is a potential for indeterminacy (always subverted by the institutional structures that frame our experi- ence of the visual arts). Couldn't that bed be made up, the covers drawn to conceal the torrid marks of the loaded brush? Couldn't those body parts be thoughtfully lidded over, that shooting gallery converted to a laconic row of plain trap doors? Rauschenberg put radios in his paint- ings; Johns wanted to have sounds emerge with the opening of each trap door. Agency slips from the maker to the passerby; as in Cage's works (and those of his model, the heroic antihero and sexually ambiguous "father" of postmodernism, Marcel Duchamp), the actions of the audi- ence become part of the piece.55 When we speak of Cage's affinity for, and significance to, younger artists, we recognize that influences go both ways. Already by 1949, when he barely knew Cage, Rauschenberg was limiting his palette to mono- chrome and using numbers to generate a kind of autonomous, depersona- lized discipline in his work (for example, White Painting with Numbers [The Lily White], 1949). His all-black paintings of 1951-52, which preceded the all-white ones by a few months, used a ground of "found objects"-in this case, newspapers-for their unreadable texture, their active silences. When Cage and Rauschenberg found each other at Black Mountain again during the summer of 1952, their friendship deepened, and both were ready for further departures. Cage writes, punctiliously, in Silence: "To Whom It May Concern: The white paintings [of Rauschenberg] came first; my silent piece came later."56 That summer of 1952, Cage saw Rauschenberg's apparently blank canvases, each white, each apparently identical to its neighbor. Rauschenberg held these canvas panels to be "hypersensitive," tender membranes registering the slightest phenomenon on their blanched white 55. On the engendering of Duchamp as a feminized "father" for postmodernism, and on the links between Cage's silences and Duchamp's "indifference," see Amelia Jones, Duchamp and Postmodernism (forthcoming). I have benefitted greatly from Amelia's trench- ant comments on this paper and from our ongoing conversations about the intertwined his- tories of modernism and postmodernism. 56.

Jones Cage and the Abstract Expressionist Ego aphor for communication from the external world.58 Rauschenberg's focus on the membrane's sensations and registrations gave way in Cage's reading to a mechanically hardened body-nerve-laden integument become inert runway, skin become concrete.59 Cage's experience of the white paintings encouraged him to proceed with his "Silent Piece." Its title, 4' 33", referred to increments of time, but the numbers were often read, to Cage's amusement, as measurements of a still body in space (see BB, p. 118). The question posed by the three- part piece was straightforward but opened onto great complexity: why not see what happens in that place, in that space of time, unintended by the artist? Although in one sense Cage looked outward, to other bodies, to generate content (where Rauschenberg was interested in what registered, internally, from the touches of photons on his paintings' membranous sur- faces), 4' 33" can also be seen as a fundamentally disembodied piece. Rather than Rauschenberg's white objects, which remained three- dimensional bodies in the world, Cage offered a bracket of silence, the only body being the unmoving one of the performer, whose stillness inverted the customary athletics of virtuosity into a model of inert, if attentive, quiescence. The only body acoustically present in 4' 33" is the body of sound; the withdrawal of the performer's body from action para- doxically authorizes our recognition of ambient noise. The famous "Happening"-Theater Piece #1 (1952)-was another development of Cage's interest in a neutral bracket for varied and unpre- dictable experiences. Staged at Black Mountain by Cage with Rauschen- berg, Cunningham, and others during the summer Cage found such inspiration in Rauschenberg's work, the event has been recalled with Rashomon intensity and incommensurability: performers, audience, dogs, weather, and white paintings all participating in an uncoordinated accretion of events.60 The aesthetics of accretion and accumulation further linked Cage with the younger painters, who gave each thing its autonomy within their ultimately mysterious bricolages. They also shared with Cage the aesthet- ics of the handyman, the tinkerer, the practical engineer. Cage had admonished in the "Lecture on Nothing": "But beware of/ that which is/ breathtakingly/ beautiful, /for at any moment/ the telephone /may ring/ or the airplane/ come down in a/ vacant lot" ("LN," p. 111). This 58. Cage, "On Robert Rauschenberg, Artist, and His Work," p. 102. 59. Martin Brody has suggested that "airports" may also be "air ports," or openings in the air. In my reading the technological side of Cage dominates the whimsical. 60. In part it included Rauschenberg's white paintings and scratchy Edith Piaf records; Cage, M. C. Richards, and Charles Olson reading from the tops of two ladders; Cunningham dancing with the unexpected accompaniment of a stray dog; David Tudor playing a prepared piano and a radio; and someone projecting films and slides upside- down. The event terminated with the serving of coffee.

As in Cage's music, the viewer, the auditor, and the environment each enter in; the piece does not exist until experienced in time by another. In place of the artist's body figured by the abstract expressionist canvas, these works implied activity on the part of others' bodies-activity that shielded, deflected, or displaced references to the artists' own. But, as my comments on the place of the body in these works sug- gest, there are distinctions to be made. Cage was never wholly commit- ted to the suggestions of membranes and bodies that remain palpable in Rauschenberg's work and rhetoric; similarly, he was not partisan to Johns's and Rauschenberg's low-life technological sublime. Cage still held out for an authentic high culture that would be "independent/ at least from/ Life, Time and /Coca-Cola" ("LN," p. 117). He celebrated creation versus reproduction, believing it important to "remove the records from Texas/ [so that] someone/ will learn to sing" ("LN," p. 126).62 This stood in contrast to Rauschenberg (the Texan) and his Coca-Cola optimism, where reproductions were reinvested with aura (amidst the fetishizing tawdriness of Odalisk or in one of his later manip- ulations of photographic silkscreens). Rauschenberg's erotic humor is also un-Cagean. In the "combine painting" Odalisk (1955-58), both title and assemblage work the joke. The punning of obelisk (that perfected monumental lingam), with odalisque (its voluptuous female repository) is complex. The pun operates with the work's electrified empty center and tacky cheesecake photos to produce a more "pointed" critique of heterosexism than Cage would ever tolerate in his rigorously dispassion- ate art. Although I earlier suggested a relationship between Rauschenberg's Bed, Johns's Target, and Cage's vernacular noises, distinctions must be made here as well. These objects fascinate us, as they fascinated Cage, but questions present themselves: whose bed? (Rauschenberg's, as it turns out.) And what happened there? Confronted byJohns's work, we wonder, whose body parts, and why fetishized, collected, shut away? This is silence of a different sort-what Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick terms the "closet-in-view" of 61.

Their learning to sing suggests to me that Cage is not calling here for an authentic folk culture, which, presumably, Texans could generate on their own. I read him instead as pursuing a model of the cultural elite that will tell Texans what to learn, and then teach them-part of the "finishing school" caravan, perhaps.</page><page sequence="25">652 Caroline A. Jones Cage and the Abstract Expressionist Ego a certain type of homosexual aesthetic.63 It is clear in such works that some- thing happened, that there are meanings to conceal behind those trap doors and between those ravished sheets.64 The body parts in John's assemblage are not the mysogynist surrealist synecdoches of pendulous breast, rouged lips, or furred female parts. Instead we see one smooth male pectoral with its trim nipple, an angular ankle, long fingers, a recum- bent penis. As against Allen Ginsberg's contemporaneous Howl (1956), with its exuberant homoeroticism and its savage outcry at the repression of Otherness in America, Rauschenberg and Johns allude only tan- gentially to their lives as gay artists in New York.65 Secrets become the engine of their art, but that engine's autobiographical chuffing can be heard, however faint. The younger, gay-identified artists' muting of the self-confessional abstract expressionist ego still had its function in a homophobic 1950s America. In that context, icons of homoerotic body parts could never be as welcome as heterosexist ones. My shorthand reference to Johns and Rauschenberg as "gay artists," and the discussion that follows of a potentially homosexual aesthetic operating in Cage's work, should be seen as unavoidable linguistic essen- tializations of what are instead shifting fabrics of historically determined, socially constructed, and discursively maintained sexual differences. These and other artists of the time did not "come out" in the post- Stonewall sense (see Johns's statement in 1978 that, early in his career, he preferred to "hide my personality, my psychological state, my emotions").66 But their homosexuality was inferred and constructed none- theless; it became sufficiently salient so that there was paranoid talk of a "homintern" among the aggressively masculinist painters of abstract expressionism, who feared "a network of homosexual artists, dealers, and museum curators in league to promote the work of certain favorites at the expense of 'straight' talents."''67 As gay theorists (such as Sedgwick, Ed Cohen, Byrne Fone, Michael Moon, and Thomas Yingling) have explored, the homophobia of our dominant culture must be seen not just 63. See Sedgwick, Epistemology of the Closet, in particular "Proust and the Spectacle of the Closet," p. 222. 64. When this paper had already been written, Patricia Hills drew my attention to the work ofJonathan Katz, who has come to similar conclusions about such works by Johns and Rauschenberg. To my knowledge, Katz's paper has yet to be published; it was delivered at the 1991 College Art Association conference in Washington, D.C., as "Subculture Repre- sentations in the Art of Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg: Identity and Community among Postwar New York Artists."

It must also be read as a cultural text; homosexuality then becomes the unconscious within that text, the ultimate difference that must be repressed in order to achieve a national, literary, or visual American tradition. Homosexuality "becomes the unconscious ... , that which the text may not speak, for as a discourse it contradicts the very things [it] is called into being to address." 68For such gay theorists, homo- sexuality is not some essentialist discourse based on bodily sex acts; it is discursively produced by "gay" and "straight" alike as a negativity within a dominant heterosexist culture.69 It is this negativity that I want to explore in the work of John Cage. What is the connection, then, between Cage's famous silences (which contain so much that they are pregnant with unheard sounds) and these younger artists' secrets-in-view? Certainly, the connection is considerably complicated by the position of the body in their works. The body, both synecdochally in its parts and metonymically through its libidinal ener- gies, was writ large in the abstract expressionist canvas; the individual ego was celebrated in the socially constructed masculine figure of the abstract expressionist artist. In the works of Johns and Rauschenberg, I suggest, the body is figured by absence-the phallus shut away (in its little "closet"), the unmade bed emptied of the body(ies) that ravished its sheets. In Cage's work, the body is necessarily enlisted differently, for his chosen discipline is music, not object; performance, not tableau. The overarching thematic of silence in Cage's work, which must be linked to the secrets of Johns's and Rauschenberg's art, can also be historicized in terms of the shifting place of the body in his production. Despite its technologic "hardening," the prepared piano of the late 1930s engaged the body of the performer (usually Cage) most spectacu- larly.

Jones Cage and the Abstract Expressionist Ego strokes, taps, and slaps the strings that have been tightened by screws and made tense with bindings and implements. By contrast, in the "silent piece" of 1952, I argued, the body was visible, but inert-the beginning of a "bodiless" performance. During the mid-1950s, when most engaged with the work ofJohns and Rauschenberg, Cage had shifted his interest to magnetic tape and other electronic sound devices; although he still emphasized the performance of his music, it was a matter of small move- ments: an adjustment of dials and flicking of switches. Contact micro- phones amplified sounds made by other objects, other bodies; it was a mechanized music in which the auditor was subjected to the daunting extremes of an acoustical technological sublime. By the late 1960s, in HPSCHD, the bodies of the seven harpsichord players were all but invisi- ble, dwarfed by the fifty-one tape players, seven films, and eighty slide projectors that performed-automatically, mechanistically, bodilessly- for an audience of nine thousand. Even in its conjunction with Cunningham's dances, Cage's midcareer music appears as a virtual dem- onstration of its disembodiedness. It is asynchronous and wholly dis- jointed from the bodies on stage, whose movements are themselves detached from function or narrative, recombined by Cunningham into exhilaratingly abstract morphemes drained of bodily significance. Cage's shift toward ever more disembodied practices during these years constituted his developing critique of the abstract expressionist ego. His evolving rhetoric and art moved from an early participation in the emerging goals of the abstract expressionist avant-garde-the primitivism, the sublimity, even the individual authority implied by his favored term invention-to his later identification with the secrets-in- view of younger, implicitly different artists. By the pivotal "Lecture on Nothing" of 1949, Cage had already hinted at the aesthetic of "hiding beauty" that he would later quote in his 1952 talk at Juilliard. The kind of beauty we might desire would be hidden in the pregnant silences, absences, and withdrawal of the body that formed the paradoxically empty fullness of his art. Cage taught a bodiless philosophy, claiming silence is but the absence of a noisy ego: "If I stop making sounds, then sounds will continue ... silence equals unintention."70 As Gerald Bruns, Daniel Herwitz, and Joan Retallack have each discussed, Cagean "poethics" are deeply rooted in the anarchic ideals of certain American philosophers, notably Henry David Thoreau.71 Cage's silence, for these scholars, opens inevitably onto 70.

In one public forum, Norman O. Brown expressed reservations about the passiv- ity of Cagean silence in the face of history but celebrated what he saw as Cage's self-sacrificial love of the world, his agape, concluding that we require Cage's "Dionysian madness.""73 No one imagines that this mad silence was simple muteness; this is refuted by the intense provocation that Cage intended, and achieved, by its means. Silence and the Body Politic The bodilessness of Cage's philosophy paradoxically engages the body. It withdraws the body from vision and audition, rendering it the noted absence in his aesthetic discourse. After Foucault, we can no longer pretend there is no relation between bodies and the body politic. In this sense Thoreau's Walden (his separation and his anarchism) and Cage's silence (his bodilessness and his anarchism) are simply the attempted with- drawal of the body from Foucault's "body politic," namely, that "set of material elements and techniques that serve as weapons, relays, communi- cation routes and supports for the power and knowledge relations that invest human bodies and subjugate them by turning them into objects of knowledge."74 For Foucault, the body can never be withdrawn from poli- tics. Its incarceration in prisons, its enforced silence, and, of course, its 72. Note, for example, Cage's Apartment House 1776, the 1976 composition produced for the American Bicentennial, almost absurdly demographic in its call for different vocal traditions: "to be added, live or recorded, Protestant, Sephardic and American Indian songs, and Negro calls and hollers" (C.F. Peters, publishers of the score). The decentered, deauthored nature of these compositions is seen also in a work like Roaratorio (1979), which uses randomly combined excerpts from Joyce's Finnegans Wake, taped sound from Joycean places in Ireland, and live performances on folk instruments by Irish musicians. The score for the latter is left entirely indeterminate, titled , Circus on _ , functioning as instructions for turning any existing book into music (the first blank being a title, the second an adjective, and the last a text; one production by others resulted in Realibogie-A Jacobite Circus on King James VI's Daemonologie. See Revill, The Roaring Silence, p. 267. Martin Brody has pointed out to me the difference between such practices and those of contemporary composers such as Karlheinz Stockhausen, to whom Cage is often compared. In the case of Stockhausen's Telemusik, for example, the different sources are appropriated from different cultures and electronically collaged by the composer, their order and acoustical role authorially determined and fixed on tape without a clear possibil- ity for either live performance or cultural variability. 73.

My thoughts on this have also been informed by Elaine Scarry, The Body in Pain: The Making and Unmaking of the World (New York, 1985), which argues passionately for the need to see the torture of individual bodies as a function of state power, not merely individual loss.</page><page sequence="29">656 Caroline A. Jones Cage and the Abstract Expressionist Ego demise under capital punishment are but signs of the state's power expressed on the text of the body. Silence is thus always already a response; it is, as Sedgwick argues, a "speech act" formed within a heterosexist discourse; or, put in Yingling's terms, the male homosexual is "empowered to speak, but unable to say" (HC, p. 26).75 Foucault expands on his notion of silence and the body politic in The History ofSexuality: Silence itself-the things one declines to say, or is forbidden to name, the discretion that is required between different speakers-is less the absolute limit of discourse, the other side from which it is separated by a strict boundary, than an element that functions alongside the things said, with them and in relation to them within over-all strate- gies. ... There is not one but many silences, and they are an integral part of the strategies that underlie and permeate discourses.76 Despite the totalizing, even hopeless aspects of such Foucauldian the- orizing, in which negativity and resistance must always be deformed by enclosure within a dominant patriarchy, I suggest that silence can also constitute a kind of critique. The utopian politics of Cage's silence, at least, should be clear; secrets and silence may be enforced by the oppres- sor, but they can also hide the oppressed (or the liberator, or beauty, or love) from the controlling, panoptical view. Thus silence is both shield and protest. As Cage told a Marxist inter- viewer in 1978, "[my] optimism that there was the possibility of changing society-has become less... less on the surface of my feeling, and taking its place has been a kind of silence."" Or, recalling his experience of a deeply influential book about nineteenth-century anarchists, Men against the State, Cage described their homosociality as embedded in silence, which he tellingly links to love: There was a group in Ohio, who never had any meetings and they never talked with one another; they lived more or less in silence, because they felt that there was so much to be done that it was foolish to waste time talking. And I think our use of words for the most part is to protect ourselves from other people, rather than to indicate our 75. "'Closetedness'" is "a performance initiated as such by the speech act of a silence-not a particular silence, but a silence that accrues particularity by fits and starts, in relation to the discourse that surrounds and differentially constitutes it" (Sedgwick, Episte- mology of the Closet, p. 3). 76.

[of] the demand and the expressed desire for love, in an anarchic world.78 Cage's opposition to the abstract expressionist ego, or what one inter- viewer called the "egotistical sublime," was thoroughgoing. "I don't like that idea," he commented. "Most people are blinded by themselves."79 But his alternative was intended not merely to suppress or conceal difference (although that may certainly have been part of its effect). It was also, surely, to let people find themselves and their differences, without the overbearing model of the heterosexist ego. Cage's evocation of the sounds freed by the egoless artist suggests the utopia of anarchy itself. Praising Feldman in his 1952 "Juilliard Lecture," he wrote: "Silence/ surrounds/ many/ of the sounds/ so that/ they/ ex-ist in space/ unimpeded/ by one another/ and yet/ inter-penetrating/ one another/ for the reason/ that Feldman/ has done nothing/ to keep/ them/ from/ being/ them- selves."80 Hiding beauty from the world might still reveal it to the self of the artist and to those members of the audience who enter openly into the space of silence and all it conceals. Johns on Cage and the Silenced Body In his early and more recent homages to Cage, Jasper Johns sug- gested the fruitfulness of Cage's withdrawal of private experience from public view, finding a dialectic between the life of Cage's embodied ego and his call for an egoless art. A 1954 assemblage, Construction with Toy Piano (fig. 6), is not identified as an homage, but I think it implies one. It was produced the same year Johns met Cage, several years after Cage's own Suite for Toy Piano (written and performed at Black Mountain in 1948), and consists of an altered or prepared piano. The delicate, aging collage on its surface consists of papers, many of them foreign, bearing numbers in or out of comprehensible sequence, or script that cannot be read. At bottom left, we see, inverted, the word Nation, as if implying the making of Americans from these polyglot scraps and texts.8' The inside of the toy piano, the part that makes the music, is concealed. Even if the viewer were allowed to touch the keys, the sounds would be muffled and their source obscured by the lid and tissue overlay. 78. Ibid., p. 15. 79.

Jones Cage and the Abstract Expressionist Ego of Cage's published sheet music for the work appears at the right in Johns's free tracing. It is significant that Johns chooses The Perilous Night for his homage, since it was the last composition in which Cage acknowl- edged investing his own personal emotions, before turning to chance and silence to generate the content of his art.83 Cage speaks openly, if elliptically, of the nature of the emotions in The Perilous Night: it was concerned with "'the loneliness and terror that comes to one when love becomes unhappy' " (BB, p. 97). "The music tells a story of the dangers of the erotic life and describes the misery of 'some- thing that was together that is split apart.' "84 There was the war and the breakup of Cage's marriage (see BB, p. 97), but equally significant for Cage was his moving out of the Perilous Night itself, emerging from autobi- ographic expressionism into egoless indeterminacy, turning from the macho abstract expressionist norm toward something more tentative and more open.85Johns focuses on this moment in creating the veiled portrait of his longtime friend, as if Cage will always be becoming, coming ever fur- ther out from that perilous night. Johns's visual vocabulary in Perilous Night was familiar to him and to those who know his works. The outstretched arm echoes, of course, Pollock's shamanistic handprints in his paintings of the late 1940s. In Johns's own work the truncated arm has multiple meanings. In his larger encaustic canvas Perilous Night, executed the same year as the ink paint- ing, there are three different arms, each a three-dimensional plaster form clearly cast from a living body, then painted and hung on hooks that pro- trude from the painting's surface. In the ink painting, however, where Cage's musical composition is featured more prominently, the hand's open palm reads differently. Inked and pressed on to the plastic support, here it functions visually as a literal imprint of a specific gesture.86 83. "I had poured a great deal of emotion into the piece, and obviously I wasn't com- municating this at all" (Cage, quoted in BB, p. 97). 84.

When I contrast the heterosexist abstract expressionist ego to the egoless silence of Cage, I do not mean to imply that there is a loss of ego boundaries (in the psychoanalytic sense of an ego pathology) entailed by Cagean silence. Writers such as Klaus Theweleit have viewed the rigidly structured and bounded homosexuality of white male fascists as a "maintenance process" (to use Margaret Mahler's phrase), "a compulsive act of defense against threats of devouring [ego] dissolution" represented by the female within (Klaus Theweleit, Male Fantasies, trans. Erica Carter, Chris Turner, and Stephen Conway, 2 vols. [1977-78; Minneapolis, 1987, 1989], 2:318). But this peculiarly distorted form of openly state-controlled homosexuality should be contrasted with what Guy Hocquenghem has argued is the inherently private and revolutionary desire to desire of homosexuality in its standard historically produced form. See Guy Hocquenghem, Homosexual Desire, trans. Daniella Dangoor (New York, 1980). 86. A complicating factor here is the slight turn in the imprint at elbow level, where it awkwardly reverses the normal bend of an arm towards its thumb. The reversal (presum-</page><page sequence="34">Critical Inquiry Summer 1993 661 Johns had used inked body parts (his own hands and face) as early as 1962 in his homages to the dead poet Frank O'Hara-Studyfor Skin I and Study for Skin II (1962) and Skin with O'Hara Poem (1963-65). By 1973 (in Skin I) he used the technique again, this time pressing his genitals on the page. The arm and open palm in particular dominate the early 1960s, appearing in other homages by Johns to the American poet Hart Crane, who suicided by drowning, diving with outstretched arms into death. Peri- scope (Hart Crane) (1963) features this diving action through the imprint of an open palm, and links it to painting: the hand slides through paint and the arm seems to sweep a semicircle of pigment before it, moving clocklike through time and space. The outstretched arm as a figure for art, death, and time are themes picked up again in Johns's frankly autobiographical series The Seasons (1985-86); here the link between Johns's heroes Crane and Cage, Periscope and Perilous, are profound. Persistent readings by tra- ditional literary theorists of Crane's homosexuality as a pathological deterrent to his art, and the work of more contemporary gay theorists who see his suicide as the ultimate speech act of one who was "empowered to speak, but unable to say" render Johns's visual equation of Cage with Crane still more provocative.87 Crane's extinguished periscope becomes Cage's passage through the perilous night-a safe passage in this case, ensured by Cage's evident survival, and signalled by the source phrase for Cage's and Johns's title, that battle hymn that still serves as the American national anthem: "Oh, say can you see ... through the perilous night ... that our flag was still there?" The ordering actions of art, and suicide, suggested by the out- stretched arm at the right, are contrasted with the work's left-hand panel. Here the inchoate images suggest bones, skulls, rocks, charnel. This realm is not the aquatic but the subterranean.88 Both halves of the piece are ably based on the cast, where we see the back, not the palm, of the hand) suggests a broken or dismembered arm rather than a partially seen one. Compare figure 7 here, and plate 17 in Rosenthal, Jasper Johns. 87. Yingling does not interpret Crane's suicide as specifically "a speech act," seeing Crane as one driven to suicide by society: "Crane's movement toward self-destruction can now be understood as an episode in ideology rather than as one in character." Yingling notes that Crane drowned himself after being beaten by some sailors he had solicited on a boat trip from Mexico to the U.S. and views his death as proof that "homosexuality was central to his life but was itself socially and psychically designed as an unlivable existence" (HC, p. 79). Elsewhere, however, Yingling explores the way in which the self-hating eroti- cism constructed as homosexual by Crane's culture manifested itself as a kind of death wish in which, I note, suicide might be an ultimate fulfillment. As Yingling writes, "The final orgasm [recall that orgasm itself is known in English as 'the little death'] does not merely release but destroys desire. Sexual utopian fantasy is often figured in Crane either as death or as ecstatic dismemberment" (HC, pp. 42-43). 88.

Death is required for the life of Cage's beloved mushrooms and for his art (as he said in "Juilliard Lecture" quoted above, "acceptance of death is the source of all life"). Johns's homage centers on The Perilous Night as the passage through which Cage, like sound, became himself in silence. The suicide of a public emotion that allowed more private ones to flourish undisturbed. Final Gestures Cage at eighty was not the same as Cage at thirty-six. The need for the finishing school had abated, with its attendant anxiety about the elimi- nation of ego. Reflecting this openness, Cage enlarged his activities to include the making of visual art and poetry; in the last two decades of his life he produced almost as many pictures and texts as scores. The poetry the cross in the Resurrection panel.

But in many of his last watercolors and prints (figs. 8 and 9), Cage reopened himself to bodily gesture, that abjured egotism of the New York school, finding a way to wield the brush without betraying his antagonism to the abstract expres- sionist ego."9 Inspired by the rock and sand gardens of the Zen monasteries in Japan, Cage devised a mechanism for painting (fig. 10) comparable to the Buddhist gardener's careful raking around a planted stone. Working with feathers and other implements selected by the I Ching, Cage finally adopted the brush, willing himself to ignore its loaded associations with genius, abandoning will, and attempting, Zen-like, to "think at the end of the brush"-to be the brush (technology/medium) rather than mind 89. In later music pieces, too, Cage opened himself to bodily gesture (and opened his performers). The famous antipathy of organized musicians to Cage's work endured long after he was an established composer and stemmed in part from the need for their bodily engagement in works such as Child of Tree (1975) and Branches (1976). In Branches, perform- ers are required to generate sound from amplified plant materials, such as gourds and potato chips; in Child of Tree they are requested to eat a banana, contact microphone in place.</page><page sequence="37">.. . - -.. ?.. .#i ';J;, ?i: ..ii. ? :: ?,':: .r : :: ":.'% .... .: ??a?F ?r ~ Irace... ,:... i: I:.. : " - :..?.. ..:- i: . ... . . ... . . .. . . . .. . .. . ,.

But again, distinctions must be made. In his continuing reliance on the I Ching and other chance operations, Cage engaged in a dialectic with the outside world that encouraged new developments. The ego of choice was married to the selflessness of chance, and the authorship of the resulting gesture could be seen as collaborative, multiple, and open to question. Cage continued in these last works to pursue his Buddhist-inspired goal to "'imitate nature in her manner of operations.'

Here we think of Thoreau, that abiding interest and inspiration, and Cage's telling of Thoreau's ambivalent relationship to fire.92 Having accidentally set the woods near Walden Pond aflame, Thoreau watched helplessly as it spread in the dry tinder, admitting a secret pleasure at the crackling sound of the conflagration and the spectacle of the consuming flames. Joining the vil- lagers who later came to put it out, Thoreau mused that fire was "nature's broom," and "without a doubt an advantage on the whole," clearing out the deadwood and the unproductive brush. Thoreau absolves himself of guilt, for might not a bolt of lightning have had the same effect? In telling the story, Cage seemed to suggest that it was not the fire that interested him. The scale of the blaze, and who set it, were also unimportant, and should not draw our attention. Cage wanted to point, with a delighted smile, at the new growth that was coming up as a result. As it happened, Cage's eightieth birthday was his last, but he was as eager to go as to stay. When one interlocutor admonished Cage at a public forum that "silence equals death," echoing the slogan of the AIDS activ- ists, Cage responded, "in Zen, Life equals Death." When the questioner continued, challenging Cage to stop his innovating and suggesting that he was "ready for the grave," Cage smiled and said, "I couldn't be readier." Cage was not the first American artist to celebrate silence, but he was cer- tainly one of the most moving, entertaining, inventive, genial, productive, and encouraging: "Everything you open yourself to is your silence."93 By forfeiting authorship he confronted authority; by giving up his claim on sounds, they became ours. Certainly the abstract expressionist ego, still the instantiation of the modern in American art, was never quite the same. 90. Cage, quoted by Julia W.
