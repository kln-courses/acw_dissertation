<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE IMAGERY OF CHOICE IN SOCIOBIOLOGY HILARY CALLAN The current controversy surrounding 'scientific' sociobiology has, in its concern with issues of scientificity and ideology, neglected the part played in sociobiology by the dominant metaphors of strategy and choice. Whether sociobiology is taken to be inclusive or exclusive of man, the metaphors in use cannot be read as applications 'of the formal principles of 'homology' or 'analogy' as developed within biology. Instead, the imagery functions in an undisciplined manner, which accounts for some of the semantic confusions and excesses of current sociobi- ology. We can distinguish roughly between 'paradigmatic' and 'operational' conceptions of sociobiology, and between factors influencing the formation and the dissemination of its claims. It is then apparent that the dominant metaphors behave differently in each of these spheres, while escaping accountability in each by their ungrounded, Protean character. [one can use] '. . . the language of strategy and decision, as if each individual contemplated in strategic terms the decisions it ought to make at each instant in order to maximise its reproductive success. The language is chosen purely for conveni- ence to explore the adaptations one might expect natural selection to favour... (Trivers I972) Introduction I shall inevitably be concerned in this article with 'scientific' sociobiology as a theory of the social and-in some of its variants-a theory of the human condition. Its claim to this status has of course been hotly debated on the plane of ideology: a debate which itself has a very long history and, no doubt, an equally bright future. Here, I shall attempt to sidestep as far as possible the ideological dimension of the 'sociobiology debate'. The view of knowledge as a product of social action is surely more correct than that of knowledge as standing in Olympian detachment from the social. At the same time, biological, cultural and historical processes and their representations interact at many levels in the filtering of experience and the production of 'knowledge'; and not all these levels have been given equal or sufficient recognition in the debate about sociobiology. I shall focus on a set of problems in sociobiology which are no less real than those of ideology but have been relatively neglected; partly, perhaps, because they have been obscured by the very heat and fervour of the ideological clashes. I refer to problems flowing from the particular forms of imagery current in sociobiology, and their far from clear relationship to what is presented as real or actual in living systems, whether human or not. I shall adopt a position of agnosticism over the validity of sociobiology as a model for man, not for want of an opinion on the subject but because my primary purpose is to Man (N. S.) 19, 404-20</page><page sequence="2">HILARY CALLAN 405 document what seems to me a fundamental lack of clarity in the model, and to consider some of the consequences of this for the debate as a whole. This article should therefore be read not as partisan in the 'sociobiology debate' but as a comment on it. A word of explanation is needed on the use of the term 'sociobiology'. The word is used very inconsistently among those who call themselves, or are called, sociobiologists, by those who are critical of a school of thought or an intellectual camp identified 'as' sociobiology, and not least by journalists and other com- municators. For some, but not for others, the term has a built-in human reference. Some use it very broadly to connote the entire domain of behavioural science within the neo-Darwinian tradition, thus including the established territories of ethology, primatology, ecology and population genetics. Others use it more narrowly, to refer to a set of concepts for accounting for social behaviour as an outcome of the mathematics of genetic transmission; they may then contrast this mode of explanation with that attributed to (say) 'classical ethology' (Dawkins &amp; Krebs I978). For some, notoriously (Wilson I975; I978), the use of the term becomes itself a predatory act: a call for the incorporation of the other life-sciences, the social sciences and humanities, and their relegation to the status of component or antecedent sub-disciplines in a 'new synthesis'. It is not unknown for writers to use the term in all these senses on the same or different occasions. I shall try to use it consistently in a narrow way to refer to the body of theory which has grown in the wake of Hamilton's rejection (I964) of Wynne-Edwards' solution (I962) to the problem of altruism in evolution, and to which the concepts of kin-selection, reciprocal altruism and reproductive strategy are focal. There remains much ambiguity over the exact domain of 'scientific' sociobiology and there are some sharp differences of opinion within its bounds. But the usage I shall adopt seems justified on grounds of consistency and also heuristically. The 'new synthesis, as so far offered is not yet sufficiently convincing that we can afford to prejudge the place in it of the other behavioural sciences (let alone the social sciences and humanities) and so disregard their independent contribution to our understanding of the social. If it is granted, moreover, that some form of 'synthesis' is desirable, there may be other and better approaches to this, whether inclusive or exclusive of man, than a premature reduction of the social to the genetic. As Harre has argued to good effect (I979), an act which is biogenic in origin can perfectly well be sociogenic, both in function and in the kind of account which it is proper to give of it; and the same can hold in reverse.1 The core images Imagery enters into the discourse of sociobiology in more than one way; the confused picture thus created may partly explain why its role has not received the critical attention that it seems to call for. At one level, there is obvious cause for comment in practices such as the use of the words 'caste' and 'slavery' with reference to insect society. Many critics have deplored the use of such 'mislead- ing analogies' to create an illusion of continuity between systems which are quite unconnected. Others, myself included, have argued in a more general way that</page><page sequence="3">406 HILARY CALLAN the apparent fit between some episodes of human and animal behaviour is often spurious: an artefact of transplanting into the language of description concepts which are drawn unconsciously from human experience and which in human terms are not straightforwardly 'descriptive' at all, but contextual, interpret- ative and performative (Callan I970; I978). If, however, we pass beyond the level at which the intervention of unrecognised human association in the selection of descriptive language is fairly easy to identify, it becomes evident that forms of imagery whose origins also lie in evaluations of human experience are deeply woven into the fabric of scientific sociobiology. Narrowly conceived as indicated above, and irrespective of the formal inclusion of man in its pro- gramme of explanation, sociobiology has at its core a family of images arranged around the idea of self-interested choice: decision, strategy, investment, payoff, game. These constitute, in fact, its central organising metaphors, not easily excised from the total structure; and their influence on it is correspondingly much harder to gauge than is that of imagery operating at the level of surface description. In order to understand what these images are doing in the theory, we have to investigate the organisation of ideas at a deeper level. This turns out to be surprisingly difficult. Needless to say, the core images do not come from nowhere, any more than do the 'surface' images of 'slavery' or 'caste'. Still less do they come from a non-humanised and non-politicised 'Nature'. They have an ancestry in eighteenth-century rational individualism modified by nineteenth-century liberalism (Caton I98 i). Such an ancestry is in itself neither remarkable nor objectionable. What seems astonishing is that the images of choice are allowed to function as centrally organising constructs for much of the theoretical apparatus of sociobiology, without serious attention being given to their exact mode of action either by supporters or by critics. Sociobiologists in recent years have taken ingenious advantage of the ramifications and reverbera- tions of the core metaphors while preserving a remarkable ambiguity on whether these play a merely decorative or a deeply constitutive part in the exercise. This practice has gone largely unchallenged: while a number of critics of sociobiology have deplored the prevalence in it of 'anthropomorphic metaphors' (Schubert I98I) few have examined the behaviour of these metaphors at all seriously. An exception is Mary Midgley; but her excellent discussion of the proper use of models and metaphors in science (ig8oa; ig80b) stands, to date, virtually alone so far as sociobiology is concerned. The following remarks ofJames Silverberg fairly represent the case as a whole: As a student of human behaviour I am fascinated but also troubled by the recent history of the language used to describe genetic phenomena. After World War II ... emphasis on information and on communication theory increased. . . . At about this time we began to hear of the 'genetic code' 'carrying the information' of heredity. Organisms were 'wired to' and 'programmed by' their genes. Finally, as the double helix model . . . gained popularity, the identification of messenger RNA' took its place in this terminological set. More recently . . . genes became decision-makers pursuing strategies. Perhaps the strategist model reflected a world of 'brinkmanship', 'defence postures' and a 'balance of terror' . . . In any case we began to hear of the 'strategies' by which genes, sometimes 'selfish' and sometimes acting through maximization of inclusive fitness by their phenotypic agents, pursue their own replication.</page><page sequence="4">HILARY CALLAN 407 Most proponents of such terminology would correctly state that they are indulging in graphic and useful metaphor. But is there not also a danger that we will mistake the metaphors for reality, that we will see the reproductive strategies of'informed' genes as an actual evolutionary process? (Silverberg I980). We must indeed beware of 'confusing' metaphor and reality; but this is the mere beginning of the task. The role of particular metaphors in designating a selection of things or events as reality must also be looked into.2 Silverberg's comments are penetrating and merit even lengthier quotation than I have space to give; but the passage is also remarkable in stopping short of any detailed analysis of sociobiologists' actual use of the metaphor of the choosing, deciding gene. Silverberg offers no account of metaphor itself, nor does he suggest what might be its analytical status in relation to reality.3 The claim can still be 'correctly' made that one is merely 'indulging in graphic and useful metaphor': it 'remains non-problematic and goes unchallenged. This critical laxity contrasts ironically with the sharpness of the debate on ideology. It has made possible a climate in which a rather complacent view of the use of metaphoric language in sociobiology has come to be generally accepted as no more than common sense. The centrality in sociobiology of the ideas of decision, choice and strategy is clearly manifested and taken for granted in all of the now standard works of general exposition on the subject (e.g. Wilson I975; Dawkins I976; Barash I977; Van den Berghe I979). Naturally these works differ importantly in other respects, and the use of metaphor is not equally elaborated nor equally fastidious in all cases. For example, there is a large difference between Dawkins's portrayal of the gene as a kind of puppet-master (I976) and Maynard Smith's careful and considered argument (I974; I978) in favour of game-theory as a model for some evolutionary processes. While Dawkins delivers his image to his reader in a kind of coup de thedtre, with himself in the character of the master illusionist whose strings and pulleys remain hidden beneath top-hat and cloak (a little like his own manipulative genes in fact), Maynard Smith offers a careful historical account of how game-theory came to be seen as relevant to evolutionary biology. Consequently, with Dawkins's selfish genes we are in a world of ghosts in machines-of homunculi indeed -whereas Maynard Smith offers a basis for serious debate. Such a difference is not reduced to triviality by the obvious fact that one work is addressed to a specialist, the other to a popular, audience. On the contrary, we shall not be able to comprehend the full force of the central metaphors of sociobiology without some attempt to chart the modifications they undergo in transposition between the various levels and purposes of exposition. Homology and analogy In this section I want to consider whether, despite the virtual absence of explicit discussion of the principle legitimising the imagery of choice in sociobiology, it is possible to identify such a principle operating in tacit fashion to give authority to the images in actual use. With apologies to the structuralists for thus borrowing their language, it might be productive to take the imagery in use as 'text' from which the submerged model or conception which 'generates' the text</page><page sequence="5">408 HILARY CALLAN could be elicited. The latter could then bejudged for its consistency and rigour in the customary ways. To make the task manageable I shall confine myself here to the more limited question whether the unexpressed model of the relationship of imagery to 'reality' accords with the canons governing the concepts of homology and analogy, rigorously interpreted. While these concepts have come to function as increasingly blunt weapons of war in the 'sociobiology debate', there is a parallel debate of long standing in biology over their proper use in cross-species comparisons and evolutionary hypotheses (see e.g. Etkin I98I; von Cranach I976). The very existence of the latter debate has, oddly, been effectively ignored by the protagonists of the former. The concepts were, it seems, introduced into biology by the anatomist Richard Owen in I843 (see Masters I976), who defined the two terms in a way which, with some modification and refinement, has survived to the present. Here, the paired concepts analogy and homology offer alternate explanations of observed similarities between organisms or structures. The former invokes convergent evolution under the influence of common selection pressures or opportunities in the absence of a common ancestor bearing the characteristics in question. The latter appeals to common ancestry where a common function may or may not also be present. Thus: Homology and analogy are both explanatory concepts ... but they also constitute methodol- ogical concepts, consisting of rules for the application of criteria making it possible to choose between the alternative explanations in a given case.... It is sometimes argued that any assessed similarity between systems in biology is based on homology, analogy or on chance. The notion of chance as an explanation of similarity implies either the assumption that the development of the structures in question has no adaptive significance; or else the operation of as yet unknown selective forces. The first case seems highly improbable, at least as far as conspicuous characters are concerned. The second case implies the assumption of an analogy with an unknown identical adaptive function. We therefore see homology and analogy as the only expressions of similarity that are theoretically meaningful and have been validated by empirical proof (von Cranach I976). There seems to be no fundamental objection to using the ideas of homology and analogy in this formal sense in comparisons between other species and man. Few people now doubt that homology explains the physical resemblances between people and other animals, especially the non-human primates. It is likely that it also accounts for certain extremely general features of social organisation which we seem to share with monkeys and apes as part of a common primate adaptation, such as behavioural plasticity, personal bonding and the social elaboration of kinship. A relation of true analogy might hold between some of the effects produced by genetic transmission in animals and by cultural transmission in man. An example might be the diversification of habitat made possible for man by the inventiveness of material culture and for other species by 'generalist' adaptations like those of domestic pets, pests and fellow- travellers.4 Because the notion of analogy in particular is tied in with that of adaptiveness, one's willingness to pursue man/animal analogies of this kind must be a function of one's sympathy with materialism as an explanation of the social. Here, I want only to argue that because one of the many things that culture does is to mediate accommodations between a population and its conditions of maintenance and reproduction, it is legitimate to experiment with</page><page sequence="6">HILARY CALLAN 409 the concepts of homology and analogy in the hope that they may help to explain apparent parallels between human and non-human systems in particular cases. The proposed relationships may or may not turn out to hold, but to posit them is not of itself a violation of what we correctly take to be the unique character of the human world. The concepts of homology and analogy, rigorously de- fined, have a legitimate place alongside others in our repertoire of explanatory ideas. I now return to the central metaphors of sociobiology and ask whether they can be read in use as applications of the principles of analogy and/or homology in any rigorous or coherent way. It is evident that a sociobiology which seeks explicitly to include man must be given somewhat different treatment from one which does not. But note that, even in the latter case, the reference to human action is inescapable. We do not have the option here of forestalling criticism by confining attention to a 'strictly non-human' version of sociobiology. The vocabulary we are examining is that of human choice, and the task is to make explicit the basis on which it is attached to living systems. In the non-human case, we are forced to look critically at the as ifon whose authority the language of choice is applied to the dynamics of natural selection and the behaviour of non-language-users. This as if may be a tacit appeal to homology, analogy or some third formal principle; but these possibilities necessarily exist even in connexion with a sociobiology which makes no claim to incorporate the human world, provided only that it rests substantively on the core images of strategy and choice. In the case of a sociobiology which does seek to include man, we have the same possibilities with the added complication that human choice makes two separate appearances in the theory: the first as a component of the Gestalt that goes into the construction of the model, the second as part of what the model purports to explain. I shall try to show that in each of these cases the answer to the question posed above is no. The imagery in use cannot be made fully intelligible within the frame provided by the paired formal concepts of homology and analogy as these have been debated and refined by biologists since the I 840's. Nevertheless we can detect in the writings of some sociobiologists (the 'text') inconsistent and ambiguous echoes of the ideas of homology and analogy. This suggests that if there is a connexion between these concepts, formally interpreted, and the 'text', it is backward-looking and allusive rather than forward-looking and generative in character. Further questions will then come into focus about the organisation of thought and presentation around the imagery of choice in sociobiology. Let me tackle the problem from the outside in, as it were; turning first to the image of choice in versions of sociobiology inclusive of man. Although, as stated earlier, these versions of the theory are not themselves uniform, we can take them together in order to dispose of the idea that in them the image of choice constitutes a rigorous application of the principle of homology or that of analogy. Homology, as we have seen, entails common ancestry. Here, it would imply that the representation of non-human and human agents alike as strategic actors reflects a true continuity in the common roots of all sociability. Like the wings of pigeons and penguins or the forelimbs of horses and seals, the</page><page sequence="7">4IO HILARY CALLAN "strategies' of animals and people may differ in their surface characteristics but have a 'common ancestry' in the genetic constraints governing the evolution of all social behaviour. At this point we run into a serious ambiguity in the use of the image of choice at genotypic and phenotypic levels of analysis. There is a tendency in sociobiology to run together the concepts of a) genes having 'strategies', b) genes equipping organisms to have 'strategies', c) organisms adopting 'strategies' (such as 'Hawk', 'Dove', 'Retaliator', in fights) in obedi- ence to the different-order 'strategies' of their genes. For a relation of homology to hold, like must be compared with like at the very least. So either gene-level strategies homologously govern the evolution of social behaviour in animals and man, or the homology lies at the level of organisms, of actual behaviour: human choice is in some sense biologically continuous with powers of choice possessed by some other animals. In the first case, if the gene-level strategies are thought to control the actual patterning of human choice as well as its remote origins, the result is of course the true reductionist position. Our experience of choice is at best an illusion accorded to us so far as it suits the strategies of our controlling genes. This is unsatisfactory on grounds too many to catalogue (string-pulling homunculi, misplaced fatalism etc.-see Midgley ig80a; ig80b). If, however, gene-level strategies are the evolutionary source of, but not the controlling force in, human action, then sociobiology seems to offer very little in explanation of human life. The second case-that of phenotypic continuity between human choice and some of the capabilities of some non- human animals-is more interesting. It seems to me a real possibility that some animals possess rudimentary powers of decision, choice and intentionality. But 'scientific' sociobiology, as currently constituted, has very little to say on this subject and is virtually useless in evaluating such a possibility because of its relative insensitivity to the complexities of the phenotype.5 What is needed is a re-evaluation of the epistemological assumptions built into our conception of animal behaviour and our techniques for observing and describing it. For this we must look not to 'scientific' sociobiology but to some of the current attempts by people in the ethological tradition to re-open the question of the cognitive capacities of animals (see e.g. Griffin I976; Midgley I983). Still within the framework of 'human' sociobiology, let us look at analogy as a possible basis for the imagery of choice. The ambiguity over genotypic/ phenotypic levels of operation of the imagery is still with us, as it is throughout this discussion. But the picture becomes even more confused. As we have seen, it is not automatically wrong to look for relations of analogy between human and non-human systems. However, analogy strictly requires that we be in a position to identify the common selective force or 'function' (in an evolutionary sense) under whose influence the characters in question have come into being. If actual human strategies are to be linked by analogy to the 'strategies' of animals or of genes, we have a choice. We can take the reductionist position once again and say that the selective 'function' to which both are attributable is that of staying in the game: having copies of one's genes continue to be around in the future. As well as being unsatisfactory for all the well-rehearsed reasons, this leaves us with the problem of explaining the relationship between final and proximate goals of action, and of deciding whether the concepts of value that in</page><page sequence="8">HILARY CALLAN 4II human experience dictate the patterning of choice are invalidated by, or subordinate to, its 'ultimate', genetic function. Alternatively, we can say that the selective function of genetic strategies is indeed that of genetic survival, while that of human strategies is of a different order and is dictated by the constraints and values peculiar to a human world. In order to preserve the 'analogy' between human and genetic strategies we would then have to shift it further back, and locate it in the relationship between these two modes of selection. We would have to say that the principles of genetic and cultural selection are themselves related by analogy, the underlying common function being . . . The argument quickly becomes unintelligible. A brief example might help here. We are interested, let us say, in an apparent parallel between human institutions such as adultery and illegitimacy sanctions, honour codes and the seclusion of women, and a pattern reported to occur in Indian langur monkeys, where incoming males on taking control of a group of females are said regularly to kill off infants unlikely to have been fathered by them (Blaffer Hrdy I979; see also Schubert I982; Blaffer Hrdy I982). Despite their concrete dissimilarity, both these practices are said to have to do with male intervention in female reproduction; both have been described as male repro- ductive 'strategies' 'for' giving the male confidence of paternity. Is this a case of homology, analogy or what? We can rule out homology because of the scattered incidence of the patterns in human and primate populations alike (suggesting that the former have their origins in history rather than evolution) and because no possible common ancestor of langur and man can have had a pattern which could be shown to be ancestral to both. There might be a relation of homology between male control of paternity in itselfin humans, other primates and other animals. But this is no help in respect of the actual, empirical patterns we chose to examine, for it is we who have supplied the description of them as 'strategies for' paternity control. The description is not inherently 'in' the data. By the very act of attaching a common description we have posited a common function; and this directs us to analogy. If analogy is to be the basis of the comparison, then clearly the 'common function' in an immediate sense is that of paternity control from the male's point of view. On one reading of 'analogy' this may be acceptable: there is after all any amount of human evidence to link men's institutional control of women's sexuality with guarantees of social paternity. We have, then, a kind of analogy between an animal pattern and a human one, given authority by a second-order analogy between the 'function' of the former, which is genetic, and of the latter, which is cultural. We do not as yet have a common function in the sense of a single agent of selection, which we know analogy in a strict sense to require. To meet this condition, we must either suppose that a genetic function identical to that of the langur case is more 'real' and more determinative of the cultural practices than are the cultural functions to which they are referred. (In this case the appropriateness of the second-order analogy becomes irrelevant: almost any cultural practices that actually produced the genetic effect would do). Or we must think very hard about the basis of the second-order analogy itself, and seek to identify a common perspective from which paternity control, as a genetic objective in langurs and as a cultural objective in man, can constitute a 'value' and become a goal of 'strategy'. This</page><page sequence="9">4I2 HILARY CALLAN might be a feasible task; but it is one for which (to put the case charitably) the theoretical apparatus of human sociobiology is so far insufficient. Homology and analogy do not, then, provide a formal basis for the man/ animal comparison involved in the explicit application of sociobiological prin- ciples to human culture. There remains the comparison necessarily implicated in the use of an imagery drawn from human experience to characterise genetic processes, irrespective of its subsequent re-application to man. Do the formal concepts of homology and analogy constitute an authority for this? Here too the answer must be no. The arguments against homology and analogy are similar. Homology, as we know, requires common ancestry; and common ancestry is here precluded by the necessary presence of consciousness in the one case and its necessary absence in the other. There is no appeal to the principle that the 'common ancestry' which creates the homology lies in the common subordi- nation of all life to the inexorable logic of the self-maximising gene. The comparison whose basis we are seeking to clarify is between non-human processes and the human world of purposes and values in which the vocabulary of choice has its source and its proper domain of reference. Whatever the 'real' (genetic, economic or other) forces which may in an ultimate sense determine the experience and discourse of choice, they are out of the picture at this point of the argument. Strategic action in a human world presupposes a linguistically structured consciousness; and to attribute this to genotypes is either gibberish or an instance of the very imagery whose basis we are seeking to understand. Likewise, analogy calls for a common agent of selection or evolutionary 'function'. The absolute discontinuity between the frames of discourse proper to human strategies and to genetic 'strategies' is enough to rule out anything of the kind, without appeal to whatever may be the ultimate biological utility of the human strategy in question. Since human strategies and choices and gene-level processes belong in separate frames of discourse, there can be no question of their having either a common 'ancestry' or a common 'function': hence, no relationship of homology or analogy. I have, I think, established the following. The imagery of strategy and choice in sociobiology is highly problematical for other than ideological reasons. Its basis has not been coherently specified by sociobiologists themselves, their supporters or their critics. I considered and rejected the possibility that the already established principles of homology or analogy might nonetheless offer a formal base sufficient to generate and justify the 'text' of actual usage. I have not of course excluded the possibility that some quite different formal grounding for the imagery may exist. I have tried out what seemed to be the most obvious candidate and found it wanting; but the result of this exercise suggests that the situation is, in truth, anarchic. The images of decision, choice and strategy provide sociobiology with a set of organising constructs which are not justified by systematic connexion with the formal principles of homology or analogy. Instead, sociobiology draws sporadically on these principles and derives much of its impact from their background force (as it were) without being beholden or accountable to them in any exact way. I turn now to some of the effects of this.</page><page sequence="10">HILARY CALLAN 4I3 Imagery out of control: the consequences Because the central images of sociobiology are not disciplined by any known set of analytical canons, they have acquired a thoroughly Protean character both across sociobiology and within the writings of individual sociobiologists. In one direction, imagery flies off into rhetoric: 'scratch an altruist, and watch an egotist bleed . . .' (Ghiselin I974, quoted in Sahlins I976: 71). In another, it slides into pseudo-description, as if the analytical categories it constructs corresponded to empirical sets. Thus 'altruism'-which by the rules can be accounted only in the currency of reproductive gains and losses, of inclusive fitness-comes to be recklessly attributed to all instances of apparently co- operative behaviour. Any case of niceness scores, and is processed back into a theory which ought only to be about the genotypic consequences ofsocial activity. Thus Trivers's theory of reciprocal altruism (I97I; I98I) is resplendent with metaphor: as well as altruism we have 'spite', gross and subtle 'cheating', and 'moralistic aggression' for making sure that cheats receive theirjust deserts. All this, taken at the face value the author claims for it, is 'mere' imagery. But we next come across something called 'the human reciprocally altruistic system, a system whose attributes are seen to result only from reciprocal-altruistic selec- tion' (Trivers I98I, my emphasis). This system, we learn, contains friendship and partnership, exploitation and freeloading, and maybe the calculation of interest on altruistic debts. The incentives for altruism and cheating are in chronically unstable balance, and examples of each are to be found in the behaviour of people in laboratory situations. What is objectionable in this is the undisciplined transposition of an analytical construct whose only possible reference is genotypic, to the phenotypic classification of actions and emotions. The illicit move is greatly facilitated for Trivers and others by failure to keep control over the twists and turns of metaphoric language-even to recognise that they should. Thirdly, the unregulated image of strategy shades into a particularly fanciful set of conceits which have come to be part of sociobiology's distinctive style: a mythology in fact. This is itself a difficult concept to use with precision. I do not mean by it the rise of 'mythologies' about what does or does not occur in nature, but rather that 'mythology' is an appropriate way of describing the sociobiol- ogists' strange shadow-world, peopled by mysterious entities or manikins which exercise choice and adopt strategies for payoffs, are neither strings of DNA nor whole organisms, are 'real' in the sense that what they do has fateful consequences, yet are removed from all investigation into their reality by the everpresent as if which hedges their every move. Finally, I suggest that undisciplined imagery rather than consciously held ideology has been responsible for much that critics have found morally and politically objectionable in sociobiology. This applies particularly to the appar- ent reductionist and fatalist implications of sociobiology for man. If our genes are represented as exercising 'choice' in an imprecise metaphoric sense, it can the more easily look as if'we' don't. Where 'we' are vividly but wildly cast as mere tools of our DNA, our sociability both created and limited by 'strategies' of genetic self-interest, people can easily find themselves locked by the metaphor's own power into a position which seems to deny the reality and authority of</page><page sequence="11">414 HILARY CALLAN human choice. This may indeed be a surprising and dismaying experience for writers as well as readers of sociobiology. The trap is an artefact of language, but it is not easily unsprung where the energising metaphor itself remains inchoate. What is 'really'going on? This discussion began with the question whether the images of sociobiology are decorative or constitutive. Failure to find a coherent base for the imagery does not mean of course that it is 'empty', mere decoration, readily peeled away from the theory's substance. Notwithstanding its Protean character, the imagery has a constitutive and also a presentational role in sociobiology. The metaphoric constructs function as tools for thought and as vehicles for discourse. To see how this works, we must move away from a restricted conception of the discipline as defined by its own formulation of its subject matter ('. . . the systematic study of the biological basis of all social behaviour'; Wilson I975: 4). We must view it instead as an emergent blend of community and practice, which is coming to have its own sub-history, sub-culture and array of platforms and publics. Two important distinctions then come into focus. The first is between what I will call paradigmatic and operational levels of being of a discipline or form of inquiry; the second is between factors entering into the production of a body of knowledge and factors entering into its dissemination. Neither of these distinctions is at all original. The first owes a clear debt to Kuhn; the second also is commonplace in the history and philosophy of science-but taken together they may clarify the role of imagery in this area. By paradigmatic level I mean that occupied by official views of a discipline's proper object of study, its articulated groundrules, its accredited theories and controversies, its recognised majority and minority positions, its acknowledged orthodoxy and dissent. Here are found the textbook examples, the classic success stories and cautionary tales, the axioms and ontological claims on which the discipline in question is founded. For many specialists of course this level is the only one there is and constitutes 'the' domain of a branch of inquiry. 6 But a sociology or anthropology of disciplines must be equally cognisant of the 'operational' level: an admittedly rough label under which I lump together the diverse collection of unrecognised or imperfectly recognised forces which also go into the choice of questions addressed and the styles of practice adopted. Included here would be the filtering of perceptions resulting from the 'automa- tisms' of language itself,7 from ideologies and worldviews (Greene I98i) and from procedures chosen 'merely' for convenience (the tractability of the laboratory rat; the accessibility of children and mental patients for behavioural research) as well as institutional factors influencing recruitment, problem selection, incentives and sanctions. These are highly disparate of course, and need to be studied separately for most purposes; what they have in common in this context is that they are not typically seen as problematic within a purely paradigmatic account of the discipline or form of inquiry in question. The distinction is a rough one, and its application to sociobiology must be even more approximate because of the relatively unsettled state of the new discipline at present. Granted these limitations, the exercise reveals two layers of</page><page sequence="12">HILARY CALLAN 4IS function, crudely modelled in figs. i and 2. It is evident that the core images of strategy, decision and choice behave quite differently within each layer. At the paradigmatic (fig. i) they are incidental, affording a 'convenient and vivid terminology'. They have no substantive force in the theory and can be tran- scribed at will into mathematical expressions of reproductive differential. Since sociobiology is, paradigmatically, a scientific theory of the social; and since science is, paradigmatically, the systematic study of an objectively existent reality, the inclusion of humanity in sociobiology becomes, paradigmatically, an issue about the empirical boundaries within which the theory holds good. As such, it is a major accredited debate in sociobiology as well as outside it; and discussion focuses on whether human beings do in fact behave and breed as the theory predicts. Things are very different at the operational level (fig. 2). Here, the imagery of choice enters into the fabric of the model at a formative stage, as part of a bundle of informal inputs derived from unconscious theories of society as well as the formal inputs from ethology, population genetics and ecology (along with their informal components-another story again!). The images have the force of organising constructs; as such they are powerful channels of attention and ?-rn u I 'Mere' I I Sociobiology: Negotiation: Forml o: X a science of ?incorporation; - .: I the social ?realignment of torie I 'paradigms' u ) = f Imagery J FIGURE I: A 'paradigmatic' conception of scientific sociobiology.

They stand in a complicated reflexive relationship to 'scientific' sociobiology and to formal and informal theories of human action. At this level it is thoroughly disingenuous to represent the intervention of the human in 'scientific' sociobiology as a 'purely' scientific issue, or as a matter of 'bridging the paradigms' (Van den Berghe I978). The paradigms are already well and truly connected, if not by visible bridges then by all manner of underground seams and channels. Scientific sociobiology, even when paradigmatically ex- clusive of man, is operationally socially constructed in a profound sense that is not limited to (though it may include) the intervention of capitalist, sexist or other ideologies. Given this two-layered conception of sociobiology, we can begin to under- stand the power and also the elusiveness of the cluster of metaphors that are distinctive of it. The imagery is in fact energised at the operational level, whose dynamics as we have seen are seldom fully recognised, let alone analysed in detail. It is absolved of accountability in the concrete world by being character- ised at a paradigmatic level as 'mere' metaphor: by the ubiquitous as if. But being part of the under-life of knowledge and practice it persists, Hydra-like, and preserves its subtle influence on the thinking of both sociobiologists and critics of sociobiology about the nature of biological processes and the kinds of human process with which they may connect. I turn now to my second distinction: between factors that influence the production and those that influence the dissemination of a body of ideas. It is of course connected with the first. Looked at in one way, indeed, the accommo- dations that a theory makes to its reception over time and at all levels of sophistication are an important part of its operational-level structure. My case again is that the core images of sociobiology behave differently in these two spheres; and I shall concentrate here on that of dissemination. In keeping with a general pattern, imagery tends to be heightened and dramatised in the 'popular' as compared to the 'technical' literature of sociobiology; contrast Maynard Smith's and Dawkins's treatment of the behaviour of genes, cited earlier in this paper. This in turn intensifies both the support and the opposition to sociobi- ology where popular writings are relied on as a primary source. Through their impact on public consciousness, these works certainly influence what goes into an area of study; and they also influence who goes into it. Book titles are very expressive, as are jacket designs. For the genre as a whole, verbal and visual imagery afford a ready identifying label, an iconography and a brand image for the 'product' on offer. We are forcefully brought up against the historical potency of images of 'nature' as a commentary on 'man'. (For discussions see e.g. MacCormack I980; Bloch &amp; Bloch I980; Leach I982; and especially Thomas I983). But the appealing qualities which can be given to a theory in popular writing are not all that is involved in its dissemination. In a splendidly tongue-in-cheek but fundamentally serious essay on how the battle over acceptance of sociobi- ology as science resembles that over acceptance of Darwin's theory after I859, David Hull (I978) says the following: If the history of phrenology and evolutionary theory have anything to teach us, it is that the truth of new theories as they are originally set out is not all that important. Phrenology in the first half of</page><page sequence="14">HILARY CALLAN 4I7 the nineteenth century was no further from the truth than the theory of evolution, which became widely accepted in the second half. What really determines the success or failure of new scientific theories is how advocates of these views continue to conduct themselves. They must be conceptually flexible, socially cohesive and terminologically rigid. (Hull I978). Admirable tactical advice; and the imagery of sociobiology could be custom- built for the practitioner who seeks to follow it. Both social cohesion and terminological rigidity are helped along by the banner effect of the organising metaphors of strategy, investment, costs and payoffs. In effect, a linguistic community comes into existence. Conceptual flexibility on the other hand is made easy because a metaphor of choice, ungrounded (as I have argued) in any firm analytical frame, does not actually commit a theory to much. Metaphoric attribution of the power of choice leaves open many avenues of escape where the identity of the choosing subject remains indefinite. As Hull has also pointed out (1978) the 'individual' on which selection acts is a somewhat arbitrary construct in sociobiology (see also Dawkins I982, especially ch. i). Applying his line of thought to the present context, we can see that this arbitrariness (which is bound up with the ambiguities discussed earlier over genotypic and phenotypic processes) allows the 'individual' who is represented as possessing the power of choice to be reconstituted as necessary to coincide with the gene, the organism, the kin group or other entity; while leaving intact the appearance of consistency provided by the force of the metaphoric construct itself. In this way the imagery of strategy in sociobiology, as well as being a tool for thought on more than one level of awareness, constitutes in itself a strategic resource. Conclusion I have tried to show in this article that the distinctive imagery of sociobiology is of critical interest in its own right. For reasons of space I cannot here explore the many lines of speculation which seem to take off from this position; although I shall try to do so in the larger work ofwhich this essay is a part. I think that one of the more serious consequences of sociobiology's failure to monitor its own imagery is that the treatment of the active subject, the phenotypic individual, becomes largely unintelligible. Because the idea of choice is locked into an imagery which is ungrounded and Protean, it cannot be grafted onto a stable conception of the choosing agent. The homunculus expels the actor from view; and in so doing may, as argued earlier, foster fatally a fatalist illusion. This is a resounding irony of course. The individual is supposed to be the pillar and post of sociobiology; and in looking for a bridgehead to the social sciences sociobiologists have seen most promise in those schools of thought which stress a methodological individualism. Yet, as Mary Douglas has recently observed (I978), there is a corresponding problem area in social theory over specification of the acting subject. At root, individuality and sociality seem to dissolve into one another. At the heart of Trivers's work on reciprocity there lies a simple but valuable insight into the problem of trust as the crux and paradox of the social condition itself. But the problem of trust is not just that of anticipating others' future conduct in order to gain one's ends. In a human world it is also a problem of consensus and commitment (Douglas I978); how we come to agree on the sorts of good and bad the world contains in such a way as to hold one another responsible for events within a structure of accountability. For social animals,</page><page sequence="15">4I8 HILARY CALLAN too, reciprocity presupposes common goods and values in a non-linguistic sense. And a qualification for being a social animal is having a capacity to act towards others in a way that expects their behaviour to be somewhat orderly and predictable. There are no easy connexions to be drawn between the one system and the other. But their relationship is obscured, not clarified, by the metaphoric projection onto 'nature' of a human image of elemental individual- ism which is questionable on its own ground. That is to say, the concept of the individual appropriated by sociobiology is not the straightforward 'given' that it is made to appear, but an elusive product of the interplay between a particular range of social forms and their theories of action. It may be to Goffman and the symbolic interactionists, as well as to Barth and the transactionalists, that sociobiologists should be looking for instruction and inspiration. NOTES This article was presented at theJune I983 Conference of the Canadian Sociology and Anthropol- ogy Association, and forms part of a larger work in progress. Grateful acknowledgement is made to the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation for funding the project, and to Trent University for its generous provision of facilities. I also thank Mary Midgley for valuable criticisms and suggestions. ' Harre's examples are worth reproducing. As a possible case of a sociogenic act with a biogenic function he offers a pilot's 'victory roll': for a reverse instance he suggests the pattern of gestures to be seen in degree-granting ceremonies. 2 Two dominant metaphors of biosocial theorising in the early I970's were those of 'wiring' and of'grammar'. For a critique see Callan I978. 3 This restraint is wholly justified by Silv'erberg's brief in the passage quoted, which is that of an editorial introduction. 4 Roger Peters (I978) offers another possible example of both true analogy and true homology in the evolution of signalling systems in relation to hunting strategies in early hominids and in wolves. There are however some general drawbacks to Peters's thesis, the most important of which is the now familiar over-emphasis on hunting as the prime ecological determinant of hominid social evolution (Morgan I972; Slocum I975; Dahlberg I98I). Peters needs this emphasis in order to sustain his thesis of parallel hominid-wolf adaptation; but in fact his ideas of cognitive maps and food-getting strategies work equally well within a gathering-based 'chimpanzee model' of early hominid adaptation (see Tanner I 98 I). 5 In his most recent book (I982) Dawkins addresses the problem of specifying the phenotype in a new and interesting way. His treatment is, I believe, compatible with my position here; but a full discussion must be for the future. 6 I am indebted to R. G. A.
