New Haven: Yale University Press, 1978. Pp. xiv+317. $17.50. Few subjects in China's long history have been the source of greater confusion than "Taoism." A philosophy, a religion, a way of life- western scholars have long tried to circumscribe and define the enigmatic term in fashions dictated by their own cultural heritage. However much they may have clung for support in their perplexity to the oft-translated Lao-tzu and Chuang-tzu, there remained the imposing bulk of the Taoist Canon, much of which seemed remote indeed from the teachings of the ancient sages. "A bible in 1,120 volumes," in the words of one frequently-quoted authority.' Maspero, writing ca. 1936, bewailed the arduousness of Taoist studies: "The old Taoist books are not dated; their authors are unknown, there is no way of telling to what period they go back, and they almost never contain a preface or final note giving the name of an author or an References to Texts in the Taoist Canon: The letters HY followed by a number refer to the catalogue of the Canon in the Harvard-Yenching Index, Tao-tsang tzu-mu yin-te y ~114 (Peking, 1935; rpt.

The Taoist Canon is of course no more a "bible" than the Chinese Buddhist Canon. 201</page><page sequence="2">202 CHINESE RELIGION indication of chronology. In certain cases, one might well hesitate between the Han and the Ming, that is, a period of some fifteen centuries."2 Whatever may be said of such pronouncements, it is at least true that the final Taoist Canon, printed in 1445, contains (apart from certain old speculative chestnuts of the Warring States and early Empire) writings dating from the third century A.D. to the fifteenth. With texts recovered from Tun-huang, these furnish the primary sources on the Taoist religion from its second-century beginnings to the compilation of the last Canon. Historians have usually shied away from this ill-charted collection, despite its promise of hidden treasures from an enormous time-span. They are all too willing to let Maspero's appraisal stand unchallenged-it is their excuse for ignoring Taoist texts and slighting the role of Taoism in Chinese history. Only during the last twenty-five years has the systematic exploration of the Taoist Canon really begun. But studies have largely been confined to the earliest texts; moreover they have mainly been the work of philological specialists. Most historians of China continue to manifest an astonishing indifference to material that, in any other historiographical tradition, would have long ago been pored over and used to illumine the bleak landscape offered by official chroniclers. Moreover even the most diligent textual scholars have sometimes forgotten that Taoism is still by no means a dead letter. The continuing presence of living Taoist priests must also be accounted for. They are still found in their characteristic raiment performing rituals throughout Taiwan, in Hong Kong and the New Ter- ritories, in the Chinese communities of Southeast Asia, and even further afield, in Honolulu and San Francisco. Present-day Taoists have been as enigmatic for certain anthropologists as Taoist docu- ments have been for most historians. Are these robed officiants part of the diffuse "folk religion," as used often to be assumed? Or do they represent a tradition apart, as their possession of an hieratic organization and elaborate liturgical texts written in the literary language would seem to suggest? Though most of the work on early 2 Henri Maspero, Le Taoisme et les religions chinoises (Paris: Gallimard, 1971), p. 347.</page><page sequence="3">MICHEL STRICKMANN 203 Taoist texts has been done by Japanese and French sinologists, in social anthropology the outstanding research of recent years has been accomplished by British and American scholars working in Taiwan and Hong Kong. Their investigations have brought to light many little-known aspects of clan and community organization and related religous observances. Moreover their clear perception of theoretical issues has made the anthropological literature on these two areas among the most stimulating and informative on any aspect of modern China. Yet few if any of these fieldworkers have had adequate sinological training. Thus they have been for the most part unable to bring a knowledge of the written sources to bear on the problematic Taoist priesthood. In fact, most English-speaking an- thropologists have not cared to look beyond the practices and at- titudes of ordinary Chinese to the religious specialists who serve them. Despite the theoretical sophistication of their analyses, it seems possible that the arbitrary limitation set by fieldworkers on the scope of their studies results directly from their own deficiencies in prepa- ration. The anthropologists' semi-literacy in Chinese denies them access to the full range of information in the possession of the learned native specialist, and their accounts of Chinese religous life must suffer in consequence. In anthropological studies of other areas, the most valuable data have often come precisely from the priests-one need only recall the learned and perceptive informants of Griaule, of Evans-Pritchard, of Victor Turner. It is a sad commentary on the state of anthropological preparedness that studies of present-day Chinese religion must undergo an arbitrary process of proletarianisa- tion or rustification, and that the anthropological study of China should be impoverished as a result of the very richness and complexity of available resources. Michael Saso of the University of Hawaii is one of the few west- erners to have studied both the living practices of Taiwanese Taoist priests and the texts in the Taoist Canon that document their historical evolution. Apart from a number of articles, his major publications to date have been a book entitled Taoism and the Rite of Cosmic Renewal (Pullman, Washington: Washington State University Press, 1972); a large collection of photocopied Taoist texts from the city of Hsin-chu Jf4i in northwestern Taiwan, most of them liturgical</page><page sequence="4">204 CHINESE RELIGION manuscripts, the Chuang-Lin hsu Tao-tsang 9$#0MU, 25 volumes, Taipei: Ch'eng-wen, 1975) ;3 and the first volume in a series, Buddhist and Taoist Studies, edited in collaboration with David W. Chappell (Honolulu: University Press of Hawaii, 1977), containing articles on Taiwanese religious practice by Saso and several of his students. The book here under discussion is his most ambitious venture in exegesis, and not only describes a selection of Taoist rituals in current use in Taiwan, but also attempts to account for their historical origins. This dual orientation calls for assessment of Saso's work in relation to historical studies, as well as to anthropology. The book is neatly divided into two parts, the first (containing historical and other background material) entitled "Master Chuang," the second (comprising descriptions of rituals), "The Teachings of Master Chuang." The Chuang in question was Chuang-Ch'en Teng- yiin W (1911-76), Saso's principal informant, whom he con- sistently calls "Master."4 After an introductory section on the structure of the Taoist Canon and on the various Taoist priestly ranks and orders as Saso understands them-material already found in his 1972 book-he proceeds to give an account of "historical origins," describ- ing what he takes to be the essential features in the beginnings and development of Taoism in general, and the historical antecedents of Chuang's practices in particular (pages 17-61). In the narrow compass of forty-four pages, Saso begins the tale in 220 B.C. and carries it down to present-day Taiwan. This is followed by a chapter, "Children of Orthodoxy," describing in more circumstantial detail the nineteenth- and early twentieth-century background of the Lin t clan of Hsin- chu, who were to become Chuang's patrons, and Chuang's own early years. The climax of this chapter is the 1886 pilgrimage of Lin Ju-mei W;k* to Lung-hu Shan [UU (Kiangsi), seat of the Celestial Masters, putative descendants of Chang Tao-ling KM (second century A.D.). There Lin purchased an ordination certificate and ritual texts using 3 The title of this collection was formed from the names of Master Chuang himself, and the Lin family who in the nineteenth century exerted a decisive influence on the Taoism of Hsinchu, as we shall see. 4 Saso tells us that Chuang was early adopted as the heir of his maternal uncle, hence the double surname (p. 77).</page><page sequence="5">MICHEL STRICKMANN 205 which, on his return to Hsin-chu, he founded the Cheng-i ssu-t'an SE- WIV, the priestly confraternity of which Chuang later came to be the head. The third chapter in this first half of the book describes the character of Saso's informant, and gives considerably more detail than Saso's previous publications on the master's personality and immediate surroundings. The circumstances of Saso's introduction to Chuang are here related for the first time, and we are told (more than once) of the beneficial effect that Saso's interest had on the master's two sons, who were reconciled to their backward-looking heritage and spurred on in their traditional studies when they beheld the western scholar's fascination. The colourful anecdotes and lengthy conversations to which we are treated in this section make it clear that Chuang was an alcoholic with a violent temper. His relations with neighbours and colleagues were apparently anything but easy. Saso's lively recital gives an intriguing glimpse of the man who was to exert such a decisive influence on his own Taoist studies, and we can only wish there were more-especially more facts, figures, dates, names, and documentation of every sort, by way of substantiating the anecdotal exuberance of the narrative. Only on page 305, incidentally, does Saso inform us that the names of all but the major figures in this most sprightly chapter have been changed. This brings us to the second half of the book, also divided in three parts: first, "The Tao of the Left," then "Orthodox Ritual: The Tao of the Right," finally "Thunder Magic: Neo-orthodoxy of the Sung." In these chapters Saso gives a selection from the rituals in Chuang's repertory, alternating translations with summaries and analytic descriptions. Under the Tao of the Left he presents a hitherto unpublished manual of what he terms "Mao Shan [MS] black mag- ic," procedures for summoning the six spirits of the cyclical sign chia Y and availing oneself of their power. This chapter is the longest in the book, and despite the inevitable repetitiveness of the liturgical genre, the translations have a good deal of verve. One wonders, though, why Saso chose to give so much space to practices that he repeatedly qualifies as "heterodox" and highly dangerous. A remark he makes concerning his translation is perhaps significant: "The English text is complete and can be used as described in the text" (pages 160-61). Can it be that Saso intends his English version</page><page sequence="6">206 CHINESE RELIGION of the rite for invoking "the terrifying Chia demons" for actual use by Taoist converts in the English-speaking world? It appears so, and I feel that he would have done well to inform readers at the outset of this further, extra-academic purpose of his book. The following chapter deals with aspects of the Chiao M ritual, the major, many-segmented rite of Taoism, extending over several days, which Saso has elsewhere described as the Rite of Cosmic Renewal. Here he terms it "orthodox" and "the Tao of the Right"; the latter expression seems not to appear in his earlier writings, and was perhaps expressly chosen for a more effective contrast with the preceding chapter. The intended antithesis is also reflected in Saso's repeated use of the words "terrifying" to qualify the rites of the Left and "stately" for those of the Right. The present description of the Chiao covers much the same ground as chapters two and four of his 1972 book, though differing from the earlier account in several particulars: most conspicuously in listing thirty-one sections for the three-day Chiao (pages 208-10), as against twenty-five sections in the earlier description (Taoism and the Rite of Cosmic Renewal, pages 62-3), and giving a rather different list of the sections which are accessible to the laity. The chapter concludes with an account of the Fa-lu R2 or Ch'u-kuan St?V rite, performed by the chief officiant several times in the course of the Chiao, by which he visualizes and exteriorizes the spirits within his body. Saso begins the final chapter by briefly presenting three versions of what he calls thunder magic, systems in which the priest summons the spirit-essences of thunder and infuses them into his body for use against demonic forces. From the twelfth century on, Taoist authors produced a profusion of thunder-rite complexes. The particular methods favoured by Master Chuang belong to the Ch'ing-wei 'M*k tradition. To this corpus Saso assigns the description "neo-orthodoxy of the Sung," and states that Chuang made use of these procedures to combat the "heterodox" magic of the Tao of the Left. Thus the second, ritual half of the book progresses, in Saso's terms, from heterodoxy through orthodoxy to neo-orthodoxy. On this classifica- tion there will be more to say as we proceed. It would be surprising if all the problems regarding a religion as little known as Taoism were to be solved in a book of three hundred pages, and it is no wonder, then, that Saso's work does not accomplish</page><page sequence="7">MICHEL STRICKMANN 207 this near-impossible feat. Yet I believe that in his efforts to elucidate the mysteries of Taoism, Saso commits blunders and perpetrates distortions that risk confusing the issues still further. The subject of his study is worthy of the closest attention on the part of scholars of China. But the manner in which Saso has carried out this under- taking will probably not enhance Taoist studies in the eyes of qualified historians and anthropologists, and may well lead interested students astray. Since Saso's book is so far the only work in English to so much as mention certain aspects of Taoist history, it seems worthwhile to note a number of statements that appear questionable. First as regards the obsessive matter of terminology and the prob- lem of Taoist origins. Saso is content to use the old term "religious Taoism" (contrasting, of course, with "philosophical Taoism"). Why not simply use "Taoism" exclusively to designate the Taoist religion? The Lao-tzu and the Chuang-tzu could then be studied independently, not only of later developments, but of one another as well, since the makeshift "philosophical Taoism" posited by modern scholars seems at best to reflect traditional bibliographic classifications, rather than correspond to a meaningful social entity that might meet the requirements of present-day historiography.5 Moreover one might well discard all the pervasive "neo's" that plague Chinese intel- lectual history, starting with the strange "neo-Taoism" that some still claim to discern in certain third- and fourth-century textual commentaries-one would have thought that Erik Ziircher's cogent remarks on this subject would have conjured away "neo-Taoism" once and for all.6 In seeking to limit and make more precise the use of the term "Taoist," I have in mind criteria susceptible to testing both by the historian and the anthropologist. From the texts in the Taoist Canon, it appears that every successive Taoist order claimed for its own revelations and practices, however original these may in fact have been, the authority of the original Celestial Master, Chang Tao-ling. 5 Strickmann, "On the Alchemy of T'ao Hung-ching," in Holmes Welch and Anna Seidel, ed., Facets of Taoism (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1979), pp. 164-67. Nathan Sivin has recently analysed the problems of definition in his article "On the Word 'Taoist' as a Source of Perplexity. With Special Reference to the Relations of Science and Religion in Traditional China," History of Religions, 17.3-4 (1978), 303-30. 6 The Buddhist Conquest of China (Leiden: Brill, 1959), p. 87.</page><page sequence="8">208 CHINESE RELIGION The important Taoist scriptural movements of the fourth century, which provided the material for the earliest Taoist Canon, all revered Chang as the effective founder of the religion, whatever they may have had to say about the corruption of his successors and the' mediocrity of contemporary priests of the Way of the Celestial Master. Later on, certain of the most extravagant ritual innovations of the Sung were put forward as representing the true substance of the original revelation of Lord Lao the Most High (T'ai-shang Lao- chiin ;t?:E) to Chang in A.D. 142, which Chang had hidden away for fear that these recondite texts would be misunderstood or misused by his unworthy disciples. Only at such-and-such a moment in the Sung dynasty, a full millennium afterwards, was the time finally ripe for their rediscovery. Moreover this common reverence for the Celestial Master did not involve submission to his supposed descen- dants, the "Celestial Masters" of the day. Indeed many of the Sung movements were in distinct opposition to the Lung-hu Shan estab- lishment. Finally it can be ascertained in the field that the Taoists of Taiwan continue to revere the original Celestial Master, whatever they may think of the sixty-fourth Celestial Master who reigns in Taipei. Saso himself makes this clear: "To Master Chuang, religious Taoism was indisputably established by Chang Tao-ling. . . " (page 17) The same attitude appears to be general among the Taoist priesthood of Hong Kong, who belong to a quite independent tradition, the Lung-men AP9 lineage of the Ch'iian-chen -i: order, with headquarters until recently at the Po-yiin Kuan b RJ in Peking, and of which a Cantonese branch is attested in the Lo-fou Mountains 540 since at least the K'ang-hsi reign period (1662- 1722).7 It should be noted that many of the Hong Kong priests seem quite unaware of the presence of a "Celestial Master" in Taipei. An obvious consequence for the historian of joining with Taoist priests of all periods and lineages in recognizing Chang Tao-ling as the founder of their religion is that then all the other involved impedimenta, with which general accounts of the origins of Taoism 7Ch'en Chiao-yu RF, Ch'ang-ch'un Tao-chiaoyuan-liu g (1879) in Yen I-p'ing @ ed., Tao-chiao yen-chiu tzu-liao MRt,;_V, 2nd ser.

Must we really go yet again to the courts of the First Monarch of Ch'in and the Martial Monarch of Han, resurrect Tsou Yen and "his" Five Phases, leaf once more through the I-ching, then tack off for the Isles of the Immortals in the Eastern Sea, before we can finally settle down to examine vital problems in the local history of a part of West China in the mid-second century A.D.? Have we really to redigest the centuries' hagiographic accretions on the subject of the Celestial Master and his early votaries before we can go directly to explicit and near-contemporary documents preserved in the Taoist Canon or recovered from Tun-huang? If we follow Mr. Saso, evidently we do. Yet it should be clear that there is nothing particularly "Taoist" about the eight trigrams, yin and yang, the five phases, and all the rest. By the time of the founding of Taoism, they were simply com- ponents of that common Chinese culture of which everyone was to make constant and copious use, whatever their social or spiritual affiliations. Similarly, if we take the hint of hindsight and accept the Way of the Celestial Master as the basic organization out of which later Taoism arose and to which it ever refers back, then our way is somewhat clearer with respect to the other second-century movements with which history and the historians' accounts are cluttered. One such movement, apparently contiguous with the Way of the Celestial Master in Szechwan, is represented by a Tun-huang manuscript, the Book of the Transformations of Lao-tzu (Lao-tzu pien-hua ching ZT4RU?_), studied and translated by Yoshioka Yoshitoyo and Anna Seidel.8 Another is the more famous Way of the Great Peace, current in eastern China at the same time, to which Saso credulously attributes 8 Yoshioka Yoshitoyo ft&amp;f, Dokyo to Bukky6 MR, L%R (Tokyo: Nippon Gaku- jutsu Shink6kai, 1959), i, 6-15.

But to the degree that the fragmentary documentation allows, each of these groups should first be carefully studied in relation to its own regional environment; it still seems premature to pronounce on hypothetical "influences" exerted by one such movement on another. The important distinction between the religious situation ca. A.D. 180 and that prevailing from A.D. 215 onwards is that at the earlier date no local religio-political movement had the official sanction of an effective secular government which the Way of the Celestial Master was to enjoy after the latter date, when Chang Lu submitted to Ts'ao Ts'ao.10 It was official recognition that was to make all the 9 HY 1093. There is a punctuated edition by Wang Ming ]7.PA, T'ai-p'ing ching ho-chiao ;t;tg&gt; (Peking, 1960). Saso knows this edition, though he wrongly transcribes its title and inaccurately translates it as "A Reconstruction of the Full T'ai-p'ing Ching" (p. 299). The true "reconstruction" of the T'ai-p'ing ching was that attempted under the Ch'en dynasty (557-89) by Taoists at Mao Shan. They ventured to produce, or "re-pro- duce," the large scripture that had supposedly been presented to the Han court in the second century A.D. by draping diverse archaic or archaic-seeming materials over an eschatological scaffolding built up from the Mao Shan revelations of 364-70. There is a considerable scholarly literature in Chinese and Japanese on the subject of the T'ai-p'ing ching, most recently the extended studies by Yoshioka Yoshitoyo collected into the second volume of his Dokyo to Bukkyo (Tokyo: Toshima, 1970; rpt. Kokusho Kank6-kai, 1977). Saso does not cite this work, nor does he seem aware of the important studies by T'ang Yung-t'ung jf,l , Hsiung Te-chi , and Wang Ming used by Yoshioka. Yet he does not hesitate to put forward his own opinions on the scripture, seemingly accepting the textsts receptus as a work of the second century A.D., and stating that "the present text of the Great Peace Canon has only 119 chapters" (p. 25). In fact it contains 57 chiian out of a reputed original 119, or even 170. Saso describes Wang Yuan-chih :E3P (d. 635), tenth patriarch of the Shang-ch'ing lineage in the traditional (and late) enumeration, as "a practitioner of the T'ai-p'ing Ching style of ritual" (p. 273, n. 47)-whatever that is sup- posed to be. Better to have described him as the chief promotor of the sixth-century version of the scripture. And Saso is even able to discern radiations of the T'ai-p'ing ching in modern times, for he claims that the scripture is "allied with the more popular Redhead styles of Taoist ritual" (p. 274, n. 48), i.e., the exorcistic rites of present-day Taiwan. I confess that to me the supposed alliance is far from clear. The reader will find more information on the textzs receptits of the T'ai-p'ing ching and indications of the conflicting scholarly opinions that still surround it in Max Kaltenmark, "The Ideology of the T'ai-p'ing ching," Facets of Taoism, pp. 19-52; also B. J. Mansvelt Beck, "The Yellow Turbans and the Taipingjing," to appear in TP, 1979. 10 All the basic information from secular sources on the early Way of the Celestial Master has been conveniently collected by Lu Pi tM in his San Kuo chih chi-chieh __ N (1936; rpt.

(life of Chang Lu f</page><page sequence="11">MICHEL STRICKMANN 211 difference, and from this point on we have the option of assessing Taoism as an official religion, a course that becomes mandatory as each successive century brings a larger harvest of textual and epigraphic evidence of government support. (Farewell, I hope, to the lingering myth of the subversive Taoist.) Both secular sources and texts in the Canon attest the close relationship of Taoist organizations to the state; under every dynasty priests furnished supportive tokens to the central government and performed rituals for its security. Here too the anthropologist should be able to furnish corroborative data drawn from contemporary practice or the recent past, for we will see at the end of this discussion that Taoist priests have been called upon to play a similar role, at the local level, in Taiwan. These general observations made, we may consider Saso's historical narrative. The beginnings of Taoism and its earliest diffusion may still be rather obscure, but enough is now known of the subsequent history of the religion to descry that it falls into two great divisions. The first period runs from the Six Dynasties into the Sung, from the fourth through the eleventh centuries. In the second half of the fourth century the basic scriptural and preceptual literature was revealed, in the fifth century the rites were codified and the texts gathered into the first semblance of a Taoist Canon. Though new and more elaborate scriptures continued to appear (the second half of the sixth century and the first half of the seventh was a great epoch in this respect), the T'ang was essentially a conservative age, in which the enduring fourth-century scriptures received homage from the highest and most gifted in the land. The second period, the "modern era" in Chinese spiritual as in economic history, begins with the Sung. The twelfth century marks another period of revelatory innovation, during which new scriptures and liturgies abounded. Once again, creation was followed by codification, and the current Taoist Canon of 1445 is dominated by huge thirteenth- and four- teenth-century ritual compendia. Much of the Taoist practice of modern times can be traced with reasonable ease to the Sung. A portion can be followed back still further, to the fourth and fifth centuries; and a small ritual nucleus can be shown to be earlier still. In this schema, the fundamental importance of the fourth-century</page><page sequence="12">212 CHINESE RELIGION materials should be apparent. The years 364-70 saw the revelation to Yang Hsi 00 (b. 330) of the Shang-ch'ing ?jX scriptures and the related hagiographies of some half-dozen of the celestial host. Yang's patrons and disciples were the court official Hsii Mi 1E ' (303-73) and his third son, Hsii Hui g (341-ca. 370), who owned property at Mao Shan -4II (Kiangsu). Mao Shan later became one of the great religious centres of China. The bulk of the Shang-ch'ing literature provided directives concerning private meditation."" In the 390's an in-law of the Hsiis named Ko Ch'ao-fu XVW (of the same clan as Ko Hung Xi#) composed a series of Ling-pao St scriptures. Their substance is divided between instructions for public ritual and precepts for the regulation of the religious life. Two outstanding masters were responsible for the systematization of this material; Lu Hsiu-ching 10! (406-77) wrote on the precepts and rituals of the Ling-pao corpus, and T'ao Hung-ching P43L` (456-536) collected and annotated the Shang-ch'ing literature. Lu Hsiu-ching has been credited with the compilation of the first Taoist Canon, on the strength of references in his surviving writings to the Three Caverns (san tung =MP) which are still the three major divisions of the Canon: Perfection (Tung-chen iMP-), most exalted of the three, corresponding to the Shang-ch'ing scriptures of Mao Shan; Sublimity (Tung-hsuian M), containing Ko Ch'ao-fu's Ling-pao scriptures; and finally, Divinity (Tung-shen MP4'), which has usually been explained as comprising the older occult literature of Chiang-nan iM , composed prior to the arrival there of the Way of the Celestial Master in the second and third decades of the fourth century.12 These facts are basic to an 11 A standard source on the historical background of Taoism at Mao Shan, not cited by Saso, is Miyakawa Hisayuki tJIIf1, Rikucho shi kenkyui, shuikyo-hen L 7 RX (Kyoto: Heirakuji, 1964; rpt. 1973), pp. 127-52. See also Strickmann, "The Mao Shan Revelations; Taoism and the Aristocracy," TP, 68 (1977), 1-64, and "On the Alchemy of T'ao Hung-ching," in Facets of Taoism, pp. 123-92. 12 The most complete account of the formation of the early Taoist Canon remains Ch'en Kuo-fu W :,, Tao-tsangyiian-liu k'ao ),Mef, 2nd ed., 2 vols. (Peking, 1963), I, 1- 104. However we now know that the concept of "Three Caverns" was already present in the Ling-pao scriptures of the 390's. Saso has some very wrong notions on the subject of the Canon. He declares that the Taoists of the Ming dynasty "established a theoretical structure for the Canon" (p. 7). Ch'en Kuo-fu's work (which Saso often cites) makes it quite clear that the "theoretical structure" of the Taoist Canon was already complete in the Canon of T'ang Hsiuan-tsung's reign (compiled before 748), and that subsequent Canons, including that of the Ming, simply took over the increasingly inadequate clas-</page><page sequence="13">MICHEL STRICKMANN 213 understanding of the development of Taoist literature, and should be known to every student of Chinese history. Unfortunately in describing the events of this crucial period Saso has got a number of the facts and many of the names and dates quite wrong. Yang Hsi's visions of his occult teacher, the Lady of the Southern Peak, Wei Hua-ts'un M) kAh rf, did not take place "atop Mao Shan" but rather in the nearby prefectural town of Chu- jung 'fV or at the capital, Chien-k'ang 4 (Nanking). Nor were Hsii Mi and Hsii Hui allowed "to attend the seances as scribes" (page 37); far from it, they knew only what Yang told them and transcribed for them, and there is no evidence in the documents of collective seances. "First acting as scribes, the two later received visions themselves and became Taoist adepts" (page 37). On the contrary, T'ao Hung-ching took great trouble to show that neither sification of their predecessors, whence the chaos of the final, Ming collection. Saso describes the Ming Canon as "a massive collection of works in 1,120 volumes" (p. 3). "About 1447, 1,057 volumes were printed by woodblock. During the reign of the late Ming Emperor Wan-li [should be Shen-tsung] (1473-1620) [should be 1573-1620] a 63- volume supplement was added to the Canon, about 1607" (p. 4). Saso has confused the arrangement of the 1923-26 and 1962 reprintings with that of the Ming dynasty original. The division into 1,120 stitched fascicles was an innovation of the modern reprinters. It represents a radical departure from precedent, since Buddhist and Taoist Canons were normally printed in the accordion-style "Brahman volumes" (fan-pen 4t) deemed appropriate to religious literature, and classified according to the characters of the Book of Ten Thousand Characters (Wan-tzu ching XT4 ). So it had been for the Ming Taoist Canon, and the basic collection of 1445 was printed in 5,305 chuan, each chiian being one volume. These were enclosed in 480 cases (han Pi), every case being sequentially desig- nated by a character from the Wan-tzu ching. The Wan-li reign period supplement of which the compilation was ordered in 1607 brought the total number of cases to 512 (Ch'en Kuo-fu, p. 174). Therefore the modern reprint's division into 1,120 secular-style volumes is not a structural feature of the Canon itself, and with the most recent, reduced- size reprints in sixty western-bound volumes (Taipei: 1-wen and Hsin-wen-feng, 1977), it has lost its ephemeral relevance. Saso states that the Taoist Canon "was not available for study until modern times" (p. 3). In a Chinese context, "modern times" could be said to have begun long ago, but I suspect that he is unaware of the use made of the Canon by Ch'ing scholars such as Ch'ien Ta-hsin fk:FFj (1728-1804), Pi Yiuan *R (1730-97), and Sun Hsing-yen &gt;fg-sb (1753-1818), who approached it as one of the great ts'ung-shu, con- taining old and philologically significant editions of many standard works, as well as interesting historical materials not otherwise preserved.

The straightforward use of the Taoist Canon by Ch'ing scholars is too oftep forgotten by those modern sinologists who quake before its supposed mysteries.</page><page sequence="14">214 CHINESE RELIGION of the Hsiis was ever able to achieve visionary experience, however much they wished to, but remained entirely dependent on Yang Hsi's mediation. This is fully born out by the copious literary remains preserved in the C/hen-kao A, "Declarations of the Perfected," that includes a portion of Yang Hsi's visionary log-book as well as letters and memoranda of Yang and the Hsiis, which T'ao Hung-ching finished editing and annotating in 499. Finally, Hsii Hui was, as stated, Hsii Mi's third and youngest son, not "his younger brother" (page 37), and Hsii Huang-min 1-11MX (361-429), to whom his family's manuscript legacy passed at Hsii Mi's death, was Hsti Hui's son, not Hsii Mi's (page 39). On page 42 the same Hsii Huang-min has inexplicably become "Hsii Huang-shih." These and the many other similar errors of fact concerning the Mao Shan revelations and their diffusion may seem fairly trivial. Saso's misapprehensions about the Ling-pao scriptures are consider- ably more serious, since the Ling-pao corpus is the ultimate source of the "orthodox" rituals in which he is primarily interested. He often mentions the Ling-pao Five Talismans, of which the original version was a third-century text, quoted in the Pao-p'u tzu ftHt1 of ca. 320. But as we have remarked, the Ling-pao scriptural corpus is the work of a later kinsman of Ko Hung's, Ko Ch'ao-fu, who wrote in the 390's, and these scriptures were assembled and piously edited in the 430's by Lu Hsiu-ching. Saso, however, offers a rather different version of these facts. He claims that Lu Hsiu-ching "edited out the forgeries of Ko Ch'ao-fu before publishing the Ling-pao Canon" (page 238), and again, that Lu "was careful to edit out the forgeries of Ko Ch'ao-fu" (page 36). How has Ko Ch'ao-fu become a counterfeiter, rather than a creator? In 1974, Ofuchi Ninji estab- lished that much of the original corpus of Ling-pao scriptures as listed in catalogues recovered from Tun-huang is still preserved either in the Taoist Canon or in Tun-huang manuscripts."3 When read together, these works display a striking internal consistency and contain a quantity of verifiable cross-references to one another. 13 Ofuchi Ninji * g, "On Ku Ling-pao-ching," Acta Asiatica, 27 (1974), 33-56.

Though the Ling-pao scriptures are only now being studied thor- oughly, there is no reason to doubt that most of the titles in the list reconstructed by Ofuchi are indeed the work of Ko Ch'ao-fu and date from the 390's. Far from rejecting the scriptures written by Ko Ch'ao-fu, Lu Hsiu-ching accorded them full confidence as authentic celestial revelations first bestowed, as Ko claimed, on the celebrated third-century magus, Ko Hsiian A3t. Lu Hsiu-ching's own surviving works refer constantly to these texts and quote from them in extenso. This case well illustrates the relativity of such terms as "authenticity" and "orthodoxy." Lu Hsiu-ching accepted this body of literature, written perhaps a decade before his own birth, as authentic revela- tion. Lu died in 477. By 492, after protracted research, T'ao Hung- ching had succeeded in recovering most of the Mao Shan materials which, with Buddhist texts, had provided Ko Ch'ao-fu with his principal source of inspiration. Hence in T'ao's text-critical usage, the term "fabricate" (tsao kou L) that he applies pejoratively to Ko's activities has a precise meaning. T'ao realized, as Lu had not, that Ko had written the scriptures himself and attributed them to a celestial revelation via Ko Hsiian. (T'ao himself of course believed that Yang Hsi's revelations had been "authentic.") But T'ao's meticulous textual studies had little effect on the views of the faithful. Rituals drawn from Ko Ch'ao-fu's Ling-pao scriptures continued to be performed by priests of various lineages, and thus it happens that the most "orthodox" rituals in the repertory of Master Chuang and other contemporary Taoists were originally composed by Ko Ch'ao-fu. Consequently we must also reject Saso's notion that "detailed Ling-pao liturgy of sorts had been worked out by the end of the third century, even though Ko Hung does not mention it in his Pao-p'u- tzu" (page 36), nor did Ko Hung, writing ca. 320, "slight" the Ling- ClassiJied Catalogue of Taoist Textsfrom Tuin-huiang in the British Museum (Tokyo: T6y6 Bunko, 1969). Studies of the Ling-pao scriptures are currently being completed by Stephen Bokenkamp of the University of California, Berkeley, and Catherine Bell of the University of Chicago.</page><page sequence="16">216 CHINESE RELIGION pao liturgies (pages 275-76, n. 71): they were not written until some seventy-five years later. It should also be noted that when Saso in different places writes of "the varied Ling-pao scriptures, [that] became the basis for the later magnificent liturgies of the Tung- hsuan section of the Canon" (page 32), "the forgeries of Ko Ch'ao- fu" (pages 36 and 238), and "the loud and vulgar Ling-pao rites" (page 43), he is referring to one and the same thing. Perhaps the most striking feature of this basic fourth- and fifth- century Taoist literature is that it was written by or for members of an endogamous group of families, including the Kos, the Hsiis, the Lus, and the T'aos, whose ancestors had emigrated southwards to the region around the modern Nanking in the second century A.D. As T'ang Ch'ang-ju *R-M and others have shown, they were the pious guardians of hereditary conservative traditions in the inter- pretation of the classics, the Rites and the I-ching in particular, as well as the proponents of a manner of their own in calligraphy. Their tradition much later came to be styled the New Text school of Han learning.'4 Thus the presence in Taoist rites of features inspired by court ritual and the Later Han apocryphal and prophetic books (ch'an-wei N), to which Saso attaches great importance, might best be interpreted as an extension by this group of closely-related families of their traditional scholarly interests into the realm of Taoism. These families dominated the religion throughout the southern dynasties, and have left their lasting imprint on its literature.'5 As Saso's narrative passes from the Six Dynasties into the T'ang, he propounds a succession of pseudo-historical constructs, or "reason why" catenas. His attempts at historiography are not furthered by his reliance on hagiography. Nearly all Japanese research in Taoist philology has been limited to Six Dynasties texts. Hence Saso's debt to traditional hagiography becomes greater as he advances. Echoing the common modern Chinese tendency to divide up Taoists into two groups, lesser priests who simply carry out rituals and more exalted 14 T'ang Ch'ang-ju #Kf, "Tu Pao-p'u tzut t'ui-lun nan-pei hsueh-feng te i-t'ung" m 8;F+gE"if4t,W,b?ffi, in his Wei Chin Nan-pei ch'ao shih luin-ts'uing .

From the late fifth century through the early years of the T'ang, he detects a shift in emphasis from "the elite ritual medita- tions of T'ao Hung-ching" towards "public ritual" (page 45). He attributes this trend to a preference for "great dramatic liturgies" that he supposes to have been shared by the "nonintellectual im- perial court" and "China's village and urban masses." And so, we are solemnly informed that "the development of popular religious ex- pression and the patronage of T'ang and Sung emperors contributed to Taoism's intellectual decline" (pages 45-46). Or again, more fully: "Until the Sui dynasty, an elite, scholarly tradition maintained itself above the popular vulgar masses. But the development in the T'ang of a new Neo-confucian metaphysics, the secularism of the late Sung intellectual, and other historical developments eventually resulted in victory for the forces of popular, magical ritual, exorcism, burial, and festival" (page 34). Pronouncements of this sort, in justification of his idee fixe, represent Saso's sole effort to link the early history of Taoism to the history and society of medieval China. Together with the many inaccuracies in his text, they bring into question the author's understanding of basic facts in the history of Taoism. A second problem concerns the accuracy of Saso's translations from literary Chinese. In the second half of the book he translates several passages from the Taoist encyclopaedia Wu-shangpi-yao 4JZtW&gt; (HY 1130), compiled in the 570's under the Northern Chou. Though we are not told this, the first three quotations (pages 200-202) derive from one of the original Ling-pao scriptures, No. 7 in Ofuchi's list, the Book of the Inner Sounds of the Several Heavens (Chu-t'ien nei-yin ching Xit R #, HY 97); the passages on pages 202-3 come from the first work in the Ling-pao corpus, the Red Writing of the Five Ancients (Wu- lao ch'ih-shu , HY 22). These fundamental fourth-century scriptures are still extant as independent works in the Canon. In Saso's summary of the passage of the Book of the Inner Sounds, describ- ing the assembly in which part of the scripture was first propounded, we find mention of "All the assembled lords of the transcendent ultimate (Wu-chi),/With their wives, who were gathered togeth- er ....." (page 200) The original, which reads 5IEXR 3A,k should</page><page sequence="18">218 CHINESE RELIGION be translated "ultimately-perfected lords and elders of the Limit- less."'6 The elders, chang-jen 3CA, are a class of high-ranking celestials frequently encountered in fourth- and fifth-century Taoist scrip- tures. Saso must have read kA for 3)A, but to attribute wives to the members of this exalted concourse betokens a sad misunderstanding of their true nature. Describing the first apparition of the scriptural text itself, Saso has: Suddenly in the heavens there appeared writings, In the shape of characters, each ten feet square. They appeared quite naturally, Generated by the Tao, Above the mysterious void. In the very center of the five rays of light Were carved wen writings. These sparkled and glittered in a dazzling manner, Their light penetrated outwards in the eight directions; A subtle, vital light, spreading out like the spokes of a wheel. The light was so bright that one could not look directly at it. The mind was befuddled by the light. (page 201) The phrases "Generated by the Tao," "spreading out like the spokes of a wheel," and "The mind was befuddled by the light" are not in the Chinese original. The verses "Were carved wen writings./These sparkled and glittered in a dazzling manner," are both derived from the single verse Zk"&amp;X, "elegantly shimmering."" The next passage that Saso quotes from this ill-fated scripture, beginning: "The heav- enly writings, jade characters,/Flew off and disappeared into the primordial breath/Of the mysterious void . . . ," is even more mud- dled, since far from flying off, the jade characters in celestial script were busily occupied with solidifying aerial vapors into a transcen- dent text: jAt18 The remainder is no better. We find for example: 16 Wu-shangpi-yao 24.2b.2-3; HY 97, 3. la.3-4. The Wt-shangpi-yao citation starts off by quoting from the beginning of chiuan 3 of this four-chiuan scripture, only to shift suddenly to the opening passage of the first chiian (24.4a.5-4b.6) before returning once more to the third chiuan, having skipped or altered twelve lines of the scriptural text as it now stands. 17 Wu-shang pi-yao 24.3a. 10-3b.2; HY 97, 3.2a.2-4. 18 Wzt-shang pi-yao 24.4a.5 ff; HY 97, 1 .la.3 ff.

(pages 201-2) These four lines purport to translate PLrp5E, JJUUAR-` Here Saso without telling us has supplied a new subject, not in the text, "the Ling-pao five writs." "The middle way of generation," presumably a sort of obstetric Madhyamika, renders the notional compound rPI'L, after which it becomes quite clear how Saso can get the meaning he does for the remainder of the verse. Though we have thus far scanned but a small part of what Saso has to say on the history of Taoism (we have only followed him to the seventh century), it seems pointless to prolong discussion of this aspect of his work. It is clear that the author is not familiar with the basic primary and secondary materials for the study of Chinese history. The reader should therefore treat all Saso's "historical" pronounce- ments with the greatest circumspection. The further Saso goes from the relatively well-studied formative period of Taoism, the more his account dissolves into vague opinions and unfounded speculations. Thus Saso on the T'ang is unfortunate, on the Sung and later times, disastrous. This book should not be used as a source of information on the history of Taoism. Let us turn then to the study of ritual, with which the second half of the book is concerned. Saso appears to have an interesting concep- tion of his own role in the investigation of Taoist ritual. He tells us why, in the present work, he has chosen to write of "ritual in the public forum" rather than "private meditation, breath control, and macrobiotics." "My reason is simply that the first tradition has not been written about in any western language or in Chinese aside from the published Taoist Canon" (pages 83-84). This statement cannot be allowed to pass unchallenged. Perhaps the first modern study of "public" Taoist ritual was done by Edouard Chavannes: "Le jet des dragons," in MIemoires concernant l'Asie orientale, iII (Paris, 1919), pages 53-220. This impressive work was based, to be sure, not on 19 Wu-shang pi-yao 24.4b.3; HY 97, 1.1 b. 1.</page><page sequence="20">220 CHINESE RELIGION direct observation, but rather on a liturgical text edited by Tu Kuang-t'ing t?Y61g (850-933), which Chavannes translated in its entirety.20 He also employed corroborative epigraphic evidence of the sort that he had already used to such advantage in his classic study, Le Tai Chan (Paris, 1910). It is true that Chavannes' successor in Taoist studies, Henri Maspero (1883-1945), wrote mainly on systems of meditation and occult physiology. Yet Maspero's posthumously-collected works (note 2, above) contain summary descriptions of certain of the basic Taoist rituals as performed in the Six Dynasties and T'ang. Moreover Saso himself realizes that meditation and breath-control are central to ritual. It may be a mistake to assume that ritual and meditation are separate domains. Certainly Maspero's studies are highly germane to understanding the inner experiences of the chief officiant in a Taoist rite. Does Saso then mean to imply that he is the first to write on the subject of Taoist ritual as performed in Taiwan? That would be an extraordinary claim. Though not mentioned in the "Select Bibliog- raphy" at the end of Saso's book, there has been a formidable array of work on that very subject by two contemporary scholars. Liu Chih-wan VIRM of the Institute of Ethnology, Academia Sinica (Taipei), has published descriptions of the Chiao as performed in several localities of northern Taiwan. These include one monograph and several substantial articles.2' Liu has been an observer rather 20 "Le jet des dragons" was published posthumously; it had been Chavannes' intention to add a further chapter on the various sorts of Chai 7 and Chiao M ceremonies, which was unfortunately never completed (ibid, p. 196 n. 1).

Liu is also an expert in folklore, and has traced elements in the ceremonies far back in anecdotal literature. The Chiao rituals he recorded seem all to have been conducted by "Red- head" priests, rather than those "Black-head" priests whom Saso terms "orthodox." Liu has also published an elaborate study of "Lii Shan [L4'" therapeutic rituals, practices that Saso characterises as "heterodox."22 Liu's work therefore closely complements Saso's, and it is surprising that Saso should not refer to it. The other scholar whose writings often overlap Saso's is of course K. M. Schipper of the Ecole pratique des Hautes Etudes, Paris. An accomplished sinologist who had made an important contribution to scholarship even before his fieldwork in Taiwan,23 Schipper spent nine years (1962-70) in Tainan, much of that time as a Taoist priest. He is also responsible for a series of invaluable concordances.24 Among his recent publications is a study of one portion of the Chiao ceremony, the Distribution of the Lamps (fen teng $ {e), comprising a timed description of the rite as performed in a village near Tainan in 1967, excellent photographs, musical transcriptions, and a critical edition of the liturgical text based on two nineteenth-century manu- scripts and various older printed sources in the Taoist Canon.25 Had Saso cared to refer his readers to a lucid discussion in English of 22 Essays on Chinese Folk Belief and Folk Cults, pp. 207-378 ("Liu Shan chiao chih shou- hun fa Q &amp;Jij").

"Taoism: The Liturgical Tradition" was contributed to the First International Conference on Taoist Studies in 1968. Here for the first time the nucleus of present-day Taoist ritual was clearly traced back to the early Way of the Celestial Master. Schip- per's paper was partially summarized by Holmes Welch, and conspicuously employed (with full acknowledgements) by Joseph Needham in a recent volume of Science and Civilisation in China.27 Xeroxed copies have long been in circulation, and it happens that the Fa-lu R , or Ch'u-kuan I?V directives, the single portion of the Chiao ritual that Saso translates phrase-by-phrase, giving the Chinese text (pages 225-32), have already been translated and explained by Schipper in his 1968 paper, of which Saso makes no mention. Saso's rendering of this text is notably free from errors. Since Taoist ritual is not quite so unexplored a subject as Saso would have us believe, we must inquire rather what original contri- butions he himself has made to its study. The notion of "orthodoxy" and "heterodoxy" seems to be his most conspicuous contribution. It is no exaggeration to say that Saso is obsessed with the question of orthodoxy. References to "orthodox Taoist ritual" already occur in his 1972 book. His collection of liturgical texts is divided into orthodox and heterodox material, and he contributed an article entitled "Orthodoxy and Heterodoxy in Taoist Ritual" to the 1974 volume, Religion and Ritual in Chinese Soiety. The present book is riddled with references to the orthodoxy or heterodoxy of the practices described and, as we have seen, Saso extends his use of the terms far back in time, to encompass and classify a large variety of elements in earlier Taoism. In the very list of acknowledgements he thanks Master Chuang for "the lengthy evening lessons in ritual orthodoxy," and mentions a prophecy of the sixty-first Celestial Master that Chuang would give "the secrets of orthodoxy" to western scholars (page xiii). We are entitled to expect a clear defini- 26 In Religion and Ritual in Chinese Society, pp. 309-24. 27 Vol. 5, Part 2 (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1974), pp. 128 f.

Saso was a rapporteur at the 1968 conference.</page><page sequence="23">MICHEL STRICKMANN 223 tion of these concepts that appear so important to Saso as to hang the entire history of Taoism on them. Several definitions occur in the course of the book: A heterodox Taoist is one who uses black magic for the detriment of man. An orthodox Taoist works solely for good while personally practicing the teachings of the Lao-tzu and the Chuang-tzu. (page 2) As has been observed, the term orthodoxy is applied to Taoists who spend their lives in doing good for their fellow men and women of the Chinese community and who follow the texts and rubrics of classical canonical Taoism descending from antiquity. Heterodoxy describes Taoists who practice harmful black magic to the detriment or harm of others. (page 13) An emphasis on good deeds as a qualification for "orthodoxy" is common to both definitions, but the textual requirements of the second definition seem somewhat vague. On page 83, with reference to a group of nineteenth-century practitioners, we read: "All of these Taoists were orthodox; that is, they practiced classical, canonical liturgy and considered the meditations of inner alchemy to be an essential part of the preparation for ritual performed in the public forum." But an ethical component is usually present in these defini- tions: "Orthodox ritual is thus defined by ritual purpose. Taoists who perform their liturgies for the purpose of union [with the Tao] are called orthodox. Taoists who perform their liturgies for the sake of making a living, curing a cold, or simple exorcism, are not" (page 197). And at the end of the same chapter on what Saso terms ortho- dox ritual: "The orthodoxy of a master is judged by his ability to perform meditation as described in the above pages, and to work always for the good of his fellow men, as will be seen in the final chapter" (page 233). Yet another of his formulations seems to suggest the essential subjectivity of all such judgements: "The very meditations of the various sects are subjected to the scrutiny of the opposing orders and declared to be cheng, orthodox, or hsieh, heterodox, according to the conformity of the color of the vapors to the classical texts of antiquity" (page 258). The vapours are those visualized by the priest within his body in the course of meditation. But who, we may ask, does the definitive "declaring" on such issues, since Saso tells us that the various Taoist sects or orders are all opposed to one another ?28 28 The business of getting the colours right is clearly fraught with consequence;</page><page sequence="24">224 CHINESE RELIGION All this simply will not wash. Is it the materials used, the liturgies and meditations, that are "orthodox"? Or is it the manner in which they are used, or again (as the majority of Saso's definitions suggest) the moral qualities and the intention of the user? What of certain other members of Chuang's Cheng-i ssu-t'an fraternity, who studied and employed texts in the possession of that arch-orthodox institu- tion? Chuang's maternal grandfather, Ch'en Chieh-san , for example, had been fond of "exacting a large fee for the privilege of learning orthodox Taoist secrets" (page 74), and in the same para- graph Saso refers to "the gross profit-making of the Cheng-i Tz'u- t'an members." Could they lust after lucre and remain orthodox? Could Alexander VI fornicate and remain Pope? And how can we hope to carry Saso's moral crusade back in time to classify the Taoists of the past? The dynastic histories depict them all as charlatans, the hagiographies as saints. We may also ask if Saso's formulations are universally accepted among the Taoists of Taiwan. What of the unfortunate heterodox? Do they avow their error, or even wallow luxuriously in it? Moreover, when we recall that for most Chinese secular historians all these priests would have been officially "heterodox," Saso's terms and the ideas they appear to represent come to seem still less appropriate. It is interesting to compare with Saso's present unquestioning promotion of Chuang's "orthodoxy" a passage from his earlier article, "Orthodoxy and Heterodoxy in Taoist Ritual": "In Taiwan I have not met a single Taoist who does not claim to be 'orthodox' or cheng (as opposed to 'heterodox' or hsieh) in his performance of ritual. Furthermore, there are deep rivalries and antagonisms between Taoist masters of dif- ferent schools, all of whom claim to possess the traditional orthodox registers of spirits' names and summons [sic], deriving from antiqui- ty."29 How could one who made this observation subsequently fail according to Saso, "Those who mistake the colors are not performing meditative alchemy leading to union but making a substitute for classical liturgy, for less than orthodox motives" (p. 282, n. 158). It could be suggested that the "heterodox" may have opinions of their own on what they are doing. 29 Religion and Ritual in Chinese Society, p. 326. David C. Yu has already drawn attention to major inconsistencies, from one publication to the next, in Saso's definitions of "orthodox" and "heterodox" practitioners: David C. Yu, "Present-day Taoist Studies," Religious Studies Review, 3.4 (Oct. 1977), 225.</page><page sequence="25">MICHEL STRICKMANN 225 to see the ultimate worthlessness of all such claims, and go on to force a large segment of Chinese religious history into a narrow mould formed along precisely such parochial lines? Of course the terms which Saso renders as "orthodox" and "heter- odox," cheng 1E and hsieh l, have a much wider range of meanings than these English equivalents might suggest. They respectively cover not only the general senses of "correct" and "perverse," good and evil; in Taoist writings of the Six Dynasties, they specifically designate the "true" healing powers of the Tao and its priests, as opposed to the disease-inducing "deviant" forces of demons and the spirits of the dead. It could also be objected that Saso's two renderings impose strong connotations not present in the Chinese originals, which might easily give the reader a false impression. It is the "doxy" that perplexes, since these words are rooted in Christian theology, where they refer to tenets views, or opinions. Yet an analogous theological framework is precisely what is lacking in the Chinese sphere. Flung about among the religions of East Asia, terms of this sort inevitably diffuse a notion of hierarchical authority and papal fulminations quite alien to the context. What Saso shows us is a picture of one provincial hierophant denouncing his rivals, nothing more. A comparable distortion seems operative in Saso's over-formal rendering of tso-tao t as "the Way of the Left." It is as if an established witch-cult were rising before our eyes, its adherents (like their western counterparts) drawn from those who have chosen to deny the light (and the Right), to renounce the glorious Tao and all its works. Attested already in the Li chi, this term invariably implies the total condemnation of whatever practices it may refer to. "Witchcraft" or "sorcery" are perhaps appropriate translations since, like these phenomena in other cultures, tso-tao is probably best understood not as an absolute corpus of practices, but rather as a relative, socially-conditioned evaluation. Also, since the contrasting "Way of the Right" is, I think, making its debut in this volume, Saso should present the authority for this convenient expression. I would like to know whether it derives from the oral tradition (since I have never seen it in the written; the true antithesis to tso-tao might be cheng tao iEi) or if it is really Saso's own creation, intended to heighten the dramatic effect of the contrast. The symbolism of</page><page sequence="26">226 CHINESE RELIGION Left and Right in traditional China was a good deal more subtle than this classification might suggest.30 The polarities with which Saso makes such ado certainly have parallels in contemporary Chinese usage. We find for example that present-day Taoist priests often dissect the old compounds tao-fa E and tao-shu X*W. According to a widely-diffused modern interpreta- tion, "Tao" denotes the refined, meditative Taoism that these priestly exegetes believe -themselves to practise, whilst shu or fa designate mere "technicks" or "devices"-ritual manipulation with- out proper meditative support or, in a word, "magic." Needless to say, the activities of the speaker's own rivals are always placed in the latter category. The notion seems to provide a perfect traditional parallel to the involved academic debate on the respective charac- teristics of Religion vs. Magic that so long and fruitlessly occupied anthropological theoreticians. We might suppose that Saso means to evoke this supposed dichotomy in his own classification, particu- larly since meditation and morality have both seen service in but- tressing the figmentary distinction between religion and magic-but since he frequently refers to "orthodox magic," he apparently does not have this distinction in mind. If Saso's criteria of orthodoxy seem vague, is there anything intrinsically aberrant in the practices which he qualifies as heterodox? And how does heterodoxy come to be associated with Mao Shan? As we have seen, this mountain is first presented as a bastion of orthodoxy during the fourth and fifth centuries (chapter one). Later we find reference to "harmful Mao Shan black magic," said to comprise the "heterodox Tao 'of the Left" (chapter four). Finally we learn that the Ch'ing-wei thunder ritual with which heterodoxy is to be combatted "derives from Mao Shan and Hua Shan, two mountains with close Taoist affiliations" (chapter six, page 237). There is no doubt about the central importance of Mao Shan in Taoist history. Down to 1949, Taoism at this Kiangsu center had 30 See Marcel Granet, La pense'e chinoise (Paris: Albin Michel, 1934; rpt. 1968), pp. 297-307, and "La droite et la gauche en Chine," in his Essais sociologiques sur la Chine (Paris: Presses universitaires, 1953), pp. 267-78.</page><page sequence="27">MICHEL STRICKMANN 227 an uninterrupted tradition of nearly 1600 years.31 But the drama of ritual rivalry on which Saso's book hinges seems to lose much of its point if the whole tale proves to be a matter of Mao Shan "ortho- doxy" attacked by Mao Shan "heterodoxy," which in turn is vanquished by Mao Shan "neo-orthodoxy." Even the mountain's greatest admirers might find this hard to credit. Saso offers an "historical" explanation: "The great Mao Shan center descended from the heights of orthodox splendor and the Shang-ch'ing medita- tive ritual to the lower forms of black magic and popular exorcism sometime between Wang Yuan-chih in the early T'ang period and the popular Lin Ling-su during the Hsuan-ho reign of the Sung" (page 282, note 160). Fortunately this four-hundred-year period at Mao Shan is extremely well documented, and we can confidently state that there is no evidence whatever for any such falling off; it is Saso's own invention. There must be more fruitful ways of ac- counting for Mao Shan claimants at every level of society than by misrepresenting Chinese history: consideration of the problem may help clarify the status and historical antecedents of so-called heterodox ritual. It is with the violence of these rites that Saso means to impress us when he contrasts the "terrifying" heterodox practices with the "stately Tao of the Right." It might well seem that nothing could be further from the fourth-century meditations revealed to Yang Hsi than the forceful procedures for summoning the Six Chia spirits, with their tense and bloodthirsty invocations: Chi-sha, Chi-sha! Black killer from the Niu and Niu stars, Leopard's face and tiger's whiskers! Hat of red and face of black! In your hands a whip of steel, 31 Twentieth-century visitors included Tokiwa Daij6 f in 1922 (Shina Bukkyd shiseki tosa ki p [Tokyo, 1938; rpt. Kokusho Kank6kai, 1972], pp. 296-99). Giuliano Bertuccioli visited Mao Shan in July 1947; his account of his stay is illustrated with woodcuts from the 1671 edition of the Records of Mao Shan (Mao Shan chih S jI^), photographs, a diagram, and a map: "Reminiscences of the Mao-shan," East and West, N.S., 24.3-4 (1974), 1-16. Mao Shan's lustre was undimmed until 1860, when its temples were burnt by the T'ai-p'ing armies. They were in large part restored, only to be laid waste once more by the Japanese army in 1938. What Bertuccioli saw was therefore only a remnant.</page><page sequence="28">228 CHINESE RELIGION Violent, oppressing, killing, punishing.... Shake down the mountains, level forests, A sheet of flame crosses the heavens! Spears fall like clouds, killing all! (page 185) In the face of such carnage, the contrast could seem fully justified. But Saso makes no mention of the true antecedents of this material. Compare for example the following spell, dating from ca. A.D. 365 and preserved in the basic collection of Mao Shan texts, the Chen-kao T'ien-p'eng iX, T'ien-p'eng, Killer-youths of the Nine Primordials, Overseer of the Five Ting T -spirits, Northern Duke of the lofty Ladle, Eight Transcendents, Seven Governors, The Most High purge evil utterly! ...

Apart from a certain shared bloodthirsti- ness, this incantation is connected with Saso's rite of the Six Chia spirits in other ways, as well. The "T'ien-p'eng" of the Chen-kao spell is the name of a star-spirit. Whether or not identical with the T'ien-feng i of the astronomical treatise in the Shih-chi, it is certainly</page><page sequence="29">MICHEL STRICKMANN 229 The T'ien-p'eng Spell of which these are the opening and concluding passages was as widely diffused and influential as the rest of the Mao Shan revelations. During the Sung, it became the basis for entire schools of ritual, and I believe that we can detect its underlying inspiration in the rather later manual that Saso has translated in his chapter on heterodoxy. If this is so, we might suggest that there is indeed a connexion between the later rites and Mao Shan, but a literary rather than a social one. In this sense, Mao Shan influence may be detected in very many later Taoist texts. Moreover the presence of the T'ien-p'eng Spell in the original Mao Shan corpus, codified and annotated by T'ao Hung-ching, clearly shows that exorcism in itself is no more "heterodox" in a Taoist context than it was in early Christianity. Though it may superficially appear alien to be identified with T'ien-feng X, first of the "nine spirits of the occultated chia" JL fw$ enumerated in the Wu-hsing ta-i aff of Hsiao Chi * (ca. 530-ca. 610), which are associated with the nine stars of the esoteric Dipper: see Nakamura Shohachi r;43 AR Gogyo5 daigi Etif? (Tokyo: Meitoku, 1973), pp. 172-74. Thus this astral ennead was associated with tun-chia A techniques already in the sixth century, if not earlier; cf. Wolfram Eberhard, Sternkatnde und Weltbild im alten China (Taipei: Ch'eng-wen, 1970), pp. 380-91. Saso's ritual manual (pp. 139-40), which he describes as a Ming compilation from earlier sources (p. 287, n. 7), contains the names of the nine just as we find them in the Wu-hsing ta-i. The Wu-hsing ta-i cites a Book of the OccultatedChia (Tun-chia ching g) to the effect that T'ien-feng is suited to purposes of security and defense t in other words, to prophylaxis. It is interesting to note that the sixth of the nine spirits, T'ien-hsin . is indicated for use in warding off illness and seeking cures j3;q , since a great Taoist therapeutic movement that arose in the twelfth century and rapidly spread throughout South China placed itself under the sign of this spirit; it was known as the T'ien-hsin cheng-fa .iiIE;. In any case, Saso's "heterodox" ritual clearly belongs within a long and honorable occult tradition. Indeed the lineage of this complex of apotropaic rites may be even more august, for certain elements can perhaps be traced back to the Great Exorcism (Ta no Jk%) of the Han. We may remark similarities between our Taoist incantations and the surviving fragments of the chant intoned on that occasion, and may note with interest the red headcloths worn by the participants: see Derk Bodde, Festivals in Classical China (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1975), pp. 81-85; Egberhard, Sternkunde und Weltbild, pp. 343-44. I suspect that a large measure of continuity may be detected in Chinese exorcistic practice from the Han and the early medieval period to our own day. It is expressed in the character of the spells employed and the manipulation of particular astral personnel. And even the red headgear of the modern Taiwanese exorcist may prove to be an important clue. Archaeology will certainly contribute additional evidence towards a reconstruction of this aspect of Chinese history, material like the incantations in the Ma-wang-tui medical manuscripts, presently being studied by Donald J. Harper of the University of California, Berkeley. And medieval literature is certain to yield much more data, once we know what to look for. All this may serve to suggest the essential congruence of Taoist ritual with the Chinese ritual tradition as a whole.</page><page sequence="30">230 CHINESE RELIGION when contrasted with the calmer portions of the Chiao, exorcism belonged in the larger complex of Taoist rites from the start. Yet this still does not fully solve the problem of terminology. How has the name "Mao Shan" come to be used throughout South China to designate a numerous class of exorcists ? The usage is attested from Canton at least as early as the seventeenth century; there "sorcerers" FM were called in to use "Mao Shan rites" XV it for curing pos- sessed adolescent girls-without much success, according to our source.33 Mao Shan's name continues to qualify ambiguous traf- fickers with the demonic or spectral otherworld in modern Taiwan. Liu Chih-wan has stated that most of the "sectarian" sobriquets borne by officiants in northern Taiwan are simply self-ascribed, and hence devoid of any ultimate historical significance. He believes that the widespread use of the name Mao Shan reflects the common occurrence in popular fiction of the Mao Shan tao-shih X4r+, a mysterious master of otherworldly forces.34 We should also recall the widespread cult of the Three Brothers Mao as Directors of Destiny 1 that continued into the present century, in popular as well as Taoist milieux. At first a secret paradise of the saints, Mao Shan continues to figure as a desirable destination for the souls of the departed in the Taoist liturgies of the Yao IM peoples of northwest Thailand, recent emigr6s from Kwangsi and Kwangtung.35 It may be that the paradise of the initiates came to be seen as a diabolical sabbat by the profane, or perhaps Liu Chih-wan's explanation is best-the mountain's name was a word of power, a name to conjure with. At all events there is no evidence that contemporary Taiwanese priests and exorcists are lineal descendants of the older Mao Shan priesthood.38 The "historical" fall from grace of the Mao Shan hierarchy is quite imaginary. Both older and newer exorcistic rites were created in the first 33 Kuang-tung hsin-yii 1Aj* (Hongkong: Chung-hua, 1974), ch. 6, p. 217. rhere are also a number of references to Mao Shan and black magic in Wolfram Eberhard, The Local Cultures of South and East China (Leiden: Brill, 1968), pp. 399-401. 34 Liu Chih-wan, Great Propitiatory Rites, pp. 46-48. 35 Shiratori Yoshiro n,IJ2, ed., Yao Documents/Yojin bunsho r -i (Tokyo: Kodansha, 1975), p. 72a.3: Ak ;fJij1fgt, -4L I.

Saso's allegation that his "neo- orthodox" thunder rites of chapter six serve to annihilate the magic (described in chapter four) of a class of human practitioners presup- poses a witchcraft accusation against a particular group of priests and their consequent demonization by sacerdotal rivals. As stated earlier a propos of the term tso-tao, there is little point in seeking out and stigmatizing supposedly aberrant elements in ritual practice. These accusations can only be explained through recourse to the sociology of conflict. By now it should be obvious to scholars that so- called "devil-worshippers" may not in fact worship the devil, and that one man's god may be another's demon.37 Moreover the particular form of "neo-orthodox" thunder-magic employed by Master Chuang is, as Saso tells us, but one of a number of similar systems, none of which is reliably attested before the twelfth century, though several still flourish in Taiwan today. What is Saso's authority for elevating the Ch'ing-wei MV rites above the many other analogous procedures ? In his final chapter, Saso states that Ch'ing-wei thunder ritual is "quite distinct" from the Shen-hsiao iITO form practised by "Red- head" priests (page 257). But later in the same paragraph he observes that externally the rituals appear to be almost identical.... The distinction is to be found, first, in the quality of the interior meditation and, second, in the spirits summoned to Redhead ritual. In the case of the Redhead Taoists, the spirits and immortals of the popular religion and local beliefs play a central role. The devout laymen who attend the services can identify the spirits summoned by the Redheads and offer private worship, often in their own homes to the pantheon of the Shen- hsiao gods. The spirits that the Ch'ing wei Taoists summon, on the other hand, are totally esoteric and their appearance, apparel, and summons [sic] are hidden from all but the Taoist master's sons and closest disciples. (pages 257-58) I would suggest that using "the quality of the interior meditation" as a criterion of orthodoxy is entirely subjective, whereas the second criterion, that of "the spirits summoned," appears to be arbitrary. It seems clear that the distinction to be made here is between an assimi- lated Fukienese form of Taoist ritual, centering on deities known to the local laity, and an imported parallel system that claims superi- 37 A recent study of analogous phenomena in European history is Norman Cohn's Europe's Inner Demons (New York: Basic Books, 1975).</page><page sequence="32">232 CHINESE RELIGION ority to the local version. Perhaps the spirits of the Ch'ing-wei pantheon, "totally esoteric" in a Taiwanese context, were local and familiar in the region of their origin. In any event, the issue of "orthodoxy" hardly seems relevant. There are, I think, two perspectives in which a concept sharing some features of Saso's "orthodoxy" could apply in Chinese religious studies. The first concerns the rituals themselves, the second their social context. Many present-day Taoist rites contain a nucleus of procedures that can be shown to derive from the late fourth-century Ling-pao scriptures. These segments, now found embedded in much more elaborate ceremonies of later redaction, in turn contain features which reflect the ritual of the early Way of the Celestial Master. Thus Saso would not be wrong in designating as much of his master's practice as can be found in the original Ling-pao corpus as "classical" Taoist ritual, provided he defined the term with clarity. Though it may in time become possible to extend the typology of these classical elements to cover later complexes of rites, Saso's attempt to define subsequent "orthodox" innovations seems to me arbitrary and tendentious.38 To identify the classical nucleus of Taoist ritual is simply a matter of textual history. Once the work has been done, such absolute categories become, in my opinion, far less useful to us than relative, social categories. I believe that an accurate social definition of religious "correctness" in China must remain completely fluid (or even mute) as regards content, and can only be formulated in relation to context. The early Way of the Celestial Master emerged from among a welter of similar groups and survived to become "Taoism" owing to the official recognition and support it received from 215 on. For its high-ranking patrons, its rites were evidently "correct" in the circumstances to which they were applied. From another viewpoint, the religion's official status in turn enhanced the authority and efficacy of its rituals in the eyes of less exalted devotees. Such has been the pattern of Taoism's expansion throughout its entire history-and 38 It is probably more practical to take the works of one of the great exegetes, rather than the primitive Ling-pao scriptural corpus, as a guide to "classical" liturgy-Lu Hsiu-ching (406-77), perhaps, or Tu Kuang-t'ing ?t?)a (850-933), who has preserved portions of Lu's lost writings.</page><page sequence="33">MICHEL STRICKMANN 233 a similar story appears to account for the emergence of Taoist "orthodoxy" in the city of Hsin-chu, Taiwan. Saso's second chapter describes Master Chuang's nineteenth- and early twentieth-century spiritual antecedents in Hsin-chu. It centers on the role of the dominant Lin clan in imposing "orthodox" ritual on the city's population through measures against the traditional priesthood. To this end, apparently achieved sometime in the 1830's, they employed a priest who had arrived from the mainland in 1823 and who, we are told, possessed manuscripts of rituals unknown to the local practitioners. Despite his advocacy of the intrinsic superi- ority of "orthodox" materials, Saso nonetheless allows us a glimpse of the way in which their pragmatic supremacy was achieved: "With a little persuasion from the Lin clan, an agreement was reached that all the 'little' Taoists, that is the Redhead or Shen-hsiao heterodox orders, were not allowed to perform within the city walls. Only orthodox Blackhead Taoists who performed liturgy after the manner of [the Lin clan's protege] Wu Ching-ch'un were allowed to remain in the city.... Temples and clans within the city walls were made to patronize only the Lin supported Taoists" (page 67). And Saso has held the key to interpretation in his hands, though he lets it slip through his fingers: "The presence of Wu Ching-ch'un in the city therefore offered the Lin clan a way to insure its elevation over the other political leaders in the city. . ." (page 66). The first stage in the formation of a Hsin-chu Taoist "orthodoxy" was thus the work of an ambitious family who made use of newly-imported ritual materials to dominate the local priesthood and so assert their own superiority over rival donors.39 39 Saso publishes a photograph of the end of a corridor in the Hidden Garden (Ch'ien- yuan jA), a villa built by Wu Ching-ch'un's pupil and patron, Lin Chan-mei #NM (1821-68). A superscription over the door reads "Cultivate in quietude" (ching hsiu fl0, and Saso has labelled this photograph "Lin family villa, meditation room" (p. 96). In a recent book of notes and photographs concerning historic sites of Taiwan, Ssu-kuyu-ch'ing chi , rF3 by the well-known art-collector Shih Ts'ui-feng &amp;VIl (Taipei: Shih- pao, 1975), there is a photograph (facing p. 101) of the doorway at the other end of the same corridor, where the superscription reads "Nurture with restraint" (chienyang &amp;A). In the accompanying description of the garden as it now survives, Shih informs us that both these li-shu ;l inscriptions are in Lin Chan-mei's own hand (p. 106). The phrase ching hsiu chienyang f#2k is taken from Chu-ko Liang's ; letter of admonition to his nephew: @.!jk fa4 Placed conspicuously in his own villa by the 19th- century military leader Lin Chan-mei, several times cited for his loyalty to the Ch'ing</page><page sequence="34">234 CHINESE RELIGION The second and decisive stage in the process was no less closely associated with the fortunes of the Lins. In 1886, Lin Ju-mei made his pilgrimage to Lung-hu Shan, where he met the sixty-first Celestial Master. "In all some two thousand silver taels were spent by Lin Ju-mei at Lung-hu Shan. He purchased a library of ritual and meditative manuals from the sixty-first Heavenly Master, including an ordination manual and a complete set of Thunder Magic rituals more advanced than those brought to Hsinchu by Wu Ching-ch'un in 1823" (pages 73-74). In return for his lavish outlay, Lin was appointed to a high rank in the Taoist hierarchy. He returned to Hsin-chu in 1888: "Now indeed the Lin family villa could be estab- lished as the center for orthodox Taoist learning in northern Taiwan. Establishing the Cheng-i Tz'u-t'an, a fraternity of orthodox Taoist priests, was Lin's first act back in Hsinchu" (page 73).4? The pattern thus recurs: it is by means of materials brought in from outside that local spiritual authority is confirmed. And this explains the "superiority" of the imported Ch'ing-wei thunder ritual over the analogous local rites, as we noted earlier. It was essential for the Lins to obtain their "correct" Taoism from a "correct" source, i.e., one officially recognized by the central government. Beginning in the twelfth century, the masters of Lung-hu Shan had asserted their primacy over the other Taoist lineages of South China, a claim that the Ming emperors found it politic to favour, and in which the Ch'ing unenthusiastically acquiesced. The seal of the Celestial Master in turn conferred a full measure of official prestige on such local aspirants as made the pilgrimage and disbursed the requisite court, its purport is clear. But there is no indication that either of the entry ways which the phrase adorned ever led to a "meditation room"-Saso has read too much into the character ching, apparently imagining it to be short for ching-shih 4, "oratory." Would he have us suppose that the doorway marked chienyang led to the dining room? 40 In Taoism and the Rite of Cosmic Renewal, Saso stated that Master Chuang's own grandfather had made the trip to Lung-hu Shan "sometime after his ordination ... ca. 1851," stayed there for two and a half years, and for the equivalent of five thousand silver dollars "obtained a set of the private manuals used by the Heavenly Master himself" (p. 87). According to the Teachings of Taoist Master Chutang, p. 70, Chuang's maternal grandfather, Ch'en Chieh-san, was not born until 1861, never left Taiwan, and ultimately gave up the priesthood to become a real-estate agent. Little is said of Chuang's paternal ascendants, save that "the brand of Taoism that Chuang's father practiced was a far cry from the orthodoxy of the Lin clan" (p. 78).</page><page sequence="35">MICHEL STRICKMANN 235 fees. Hence the Lins, well armed with recent and fully certified imports, could achieve an easy triumph over representatives of the old assimilated Taoism of Fukien that had hitherto flourished in Hsin-chu. Yet though the imported rites may have been more elaborate than the local versions, there is little doubt that many of them were relatively recent innovations-there is no indication that the nineteenth-century "orthodoxy" imported to Taiwan was in any way "pristine," as Saso suggests (page 72). It should be apparent that this sense of "orthodoxy" in fact offers a close analogy to the equally obsessive notion of political legitimacy. As in the case of legitimacy, assertions of religious correctness are supposedly authenticated by claims of lineal affiliation. And as the writing of Chinese secular history has been shaped by the obsession with legitimacy, with its inevitable concomitants of suppression and distortion, so formulations of spiritual and intellectual history are marked and marred by often dubious claims of descent. One need only note the intricate charts of spiritual genealogy that figure in so many works on Chinese thought or religion. Already from the early medieval documents it becomes apparent that lineage and similar claims of affiliation must be clearly distinguished from any particular corpus of actual practices. Lineage has always been primarily a vehicle of social identity and authority, and this fact is perhaps all the more relevant when dealing with a purely fictive, spiritual family. Traditional practitioners constantly assert that their practices are congruent with their lineage, which at the same time preserves and validates them. Yet there is no intrinsic reason for the scholar to credit this claim. He is indeed obliged to record it, but would be ill- advised to take it seriously, much less to promote it, as Saso seems to do. Even from the small selection of material given by Saso, the complexity of Taoist ritual is obvious. It may be that after due study and assimilation, the basic components will prove to be quite homo- geneous, and limited in number, but for the present we are confronted with an overwhelming diversity of detail. One reason for this, I would suggest, is that there has never really been any such thing as "orthodoxy" with regard to the substance of Taoist ritual. Indeed it is the hospitable, uncritical comprehensiveness of Taoist textual collections and the exuberant cumulation of lineages and practices</page><page sequence="36">236 CHINESE RELIGION by Taoist priests that makes for the richness of resources available to the scholar. The so-called "heterodox" texts in particular abound in data on regional and local peculiarities in rites and customs, and should be of the greatest significance for the study of local history. Simplistic notions of "orthodoxy" and "heterodoxy" have, in my opinion, no relevance whatever to the study of Taoism, and it is regrettable that these preconceived ideas should have distorted Saso's presentation. If we cannot follow Saso in his larger view of Taoism, his version of history, and his partisan analysis of the liturgy, what of his method as an ethnological observer? In all his earlier publications, he has presented himself as an anthropologist. Can we at least accept what he tells us of his teacher's own opinions and the immediate milieu to which they relate? First we may consider his relationship to his chief informant. This is left somewhat vague, for though Saso states that he joined Chuang's sons in some, at least, of their liturgical and contemplative lessons, he never tells us if he himself became a priest. Was he in fact ordained, and if so, by what procedures, and what rank did he attain in the hierarchy of which he has so often written? A photograph published in Taoism and the Rite of Cosmic Renewal (page 104) shows Saso in the robes of a Taoist priest "reading one of the canons of merit and repentance early in the morning of the Chiao festival of renewal." Hence we are to assume that Saso did become a priest, and as such participated in certain of the rituals he describes. It seems to me that in what purports to be an anthropo- logical study we are entitled to know basic facts of this kind: "On such-and-such a date, I was ordained into such-and-such a rank, with the religious name of.... Thereafter (dates given) I was instructed in...." Such a presentation may be comparatively prosaic, but without it how can we possibly understand what Saso was told, and his informant's intention in so telling him? I would also suggest that there are serious problems concerning the manner in which Saso obtained information from his teacher-infor- mant. There is already a basic question of objectivity in the case of an anthropologist who is at the same time a participant (and perhaps also a believer) in the rituals he describes. But there are</page><page sequence="37">MICHEL STRICKMANN 237 also a number of clear indications that Saso influenced Chuang, and supplied the "information" he was given. One of the interesting facts to emerge from K. M. Schipper's study of Taoist priests in Tainan was that they did not even know of the existence of a Taoist Canon.41 Consequently a very special value attached to their liturgical manuscripts and oral tradition. Their rituals could first be studied without reference to standardized, printed sources, yet offered the opportunity to make those sources (and a substantial part of the Chinese past) come alive. Above all, the independent existence of a living tradition and a great collection of texts last printed in the fifteenth century presented a chance of testing the tradition's antiquity and trustworthiness. Was present-day Taoist practice substantially like that of the Ming, and how much further back might it be traced? In short, an astonishing range of possiblities was opened when Schipper first demonstrated the large-scale survival of Taoist liturgy in Taiwan. Saso's approach to the traditions preserved by the Taoists of Hsin- chu was quite different. He tells us, first, that he produced a photocopy of a Taoist liturgical manuscript in the British Museum as a means of winning Chuang's confidence and gaining access to additional materials and information. In Chuang's conservative view, only one who had been initiated might own such a text, and so Saso's possession of it constituted a strong argument in favour of accepting the foreigner as a disciple. While this stratagem may be reasonable enough, Saso's subsequent use of the printed Taoist Canon seems to me quite indefensible for a serious anthropologist. He states that "These evening sessions [of instruction by Chuang] were very long and boring.... I soon learned that canonical passages [i.e., texts from the Taoist Canon] could be substituted for Chuang's lessons and brought the Canon for him to read instead" (page 200). It transpires that the exposition of "orthodox" ritual in chapter five is based on Chuang's interpretation of passages from the Wu-shang pi-yao LaW&gt; (HY 1130), a Taoist encyclopaedia compiled in the 570's, which I doubt that Chuang had so much as heard of before Saso brought it to him.42 41 Schipper, Lefen-teng, p. 39, n. 6: "Les pretres du Sud de Formose ne l'avaientjama is vu avant mon arrivee parmi eux." 42 Cf. p. 285, n. 4: "The Fu Jen University library copy of the Canon loaned to the</page><page sequence="38">238 CHINESE RELIGION He also introduced Chuang to the textual studies of Taoism by Japanese scholars, as well as to the Japanese translation of Maspero's posthumous essays on early Taoist history (pages 89-90).43 This perhaps represents an interesting extension of the anthropologist's educative function, but there seems little doubt that Saso primed his informant, and that many of the opinions which he attributes to Chuang were suggested to him by Saso himself or discovered in the syllabus of readings with which Saso furnished him. The glimpses Saso allows us of his own working methods seem to disqualify him even as simply a recorder of Taiwanese tradition, and we are obliged to question every aspect of the picture which he has assembled by such dubious means. As for the immediate background of Chuang's Taoism, Saso's account seems impressionistic in the extreme. Here he is describing an event that took place in 1926: Furious with her useless and profligate brother, Ch'en A-kuei strode through the dark and narrow streets to her father's house and confronted the concubine. What right, the concubine demanded, did the married sister have to determine the inheritance of the Ch'en household? A-kuei did not deign to speak to the woman of the streets. Her eyes flashed as in the picture over the family altar; she turned and spoke to her brother. "There was a contract made between my father and me," she said in a soft and firm voice. "According to that contract my son, Chuang-ch'en Teng-yiin, was to retain the Taoist books of my father." . . . Good riddance, said the courtesan, as the unwanted books disappeared into the darkness. (pages 78-79) Mr. Saso is presumably not speaking as an eyewitness when he describes the flashing eyes, the soft and firm voice, and gives the direct quotation. Organized and hierarchised Taoists of whatever sort all function within a much wider context of diffuse cults and beliefs. Saso reserves project by the Rev. Yves Raguin, s. j. was used by Chuang during a portion of the study.

This institu- tion, which is very hard to delineate, is not an organized religion but a belief shared by the Han (Chinese) people with myriads of local variations; it can be defined basically as the religion of the cosmological theory of yin-yang and the five elements. That is to say, the yin-yang five-element theory, when euhemerized or personified as a system of spirits and demons who rule the invisible world, is the basic tenet of the system called Chinese religion. A Taoist as such is a firm believer in Chinese religion and participates in all the local cults, ancestor worship, and whatever else is considered to be of faith by the people whom he serves. (page 122) This is hardly an adequate summary of popular religion in Taiwan, after the important studies by Ahern, Baity, Jordan, Wolf, and others." It is peculiar that Saso gives no indication that he is familiar with the writings of these anthropologists. Surprising as this omission is, it is rather his statement that Taoist priests are believers in the substance of folk religion that calls for comment. If true, it would effectively nullify the meaning of Taoism and return it to the amorphous mass of beliefs from which it long ago issued. Taoism was first formed in contrast to popular religion. From earliest times, its priests have primarily defined themselves not in relation to Buddhism, still less to "Confucianism" (whatever that may be), but rather in stark contrast to the unregenerate cults of the people at large. Taoists do homage to the uncreated, anthropomorphic emana- tions of the primordial Tao; they know that the beings worshipped as "gods" by the profane are in reality merely spirits of the dead. Taoist priests introduced stern restrictions even on communion with one's own dead ("ancestor worship"), and joined with their ally, the state, in violent extirpation of "irregular cults" (yin ssu gifiI): those not sanctified by official recognition.45 Though at the present 44 Emily M.

Ancient texts and modern practitioners confirm one another on this fundamental point, and Taoism should consequently be recognized as China's indigenous higher religion.46 Finally, our quotations from the book will already have indicated certain peculiarities in the language of discourse. Saso batters the reader with a string of constantly-recurring catch-words and phrases, like "orthodoxy" and "heterodoxy"; they include "ritual in the public forum," "harmful Mao Shan black magic," "ecumenical" and "ecumenism," "ritual perfection," "terrifying chia spirits," and above all, "the secrets of orthodox Taoism."47 Moreover the book is pervaded by a tone of moral uplift. Though he describes murder- ous battles of magic, bitter feuds, and supposedly radically opposed bodies of ritual, Saso can still gaze beyond the baffling complexities of liturgy, society, and history to a plane on which "a marvelous unity is seen to exist among Taoists. In spite of the diversity of sects and rubrics, the mystic experience of unity with the transcendent 46 Saso's passing references to Buddhism are often inaccurate, though usually trivial, but on p. 44 he perpetrates a gross distortion of an important text that must be corrected. He writes that "T'ao [Hung-ching], who had been a Buddhist, ranked the Shang-ch'ing revelations beside the Lotus Sutra and the Chuang-tzu. They were the Sarvayana (all in one vehicle); he thought of the three revelations as one doctrine revealing the highest of all causes." T'ao was actually enumerating the Three Ways -, a frequent topos in fifth- century Taoist literature. They were complementary but by no means identical. For T'ao, they comprised the way of the highest perfected, expressed in the seven primary Shang- ch'ing scriptures; the way of the Buddha, found in the Lotus Sutra; and the way of the immortals (hsien {[), crystallized in the seven "inner chapters" of the Chuang-tzu. Among them they comprehended all things. It was of the Lotus that T'ao wrote, "It expounds the ultimate teaching of the One Vehicle" - R, which is a simple statement of fact. The Lotus Sutra promotes the doctrine of Ekayana; see for example Leon Hurvitz, trans., Scripture of the Lotus Blossom of the Fine Dharma (New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1976), p. xx; pp. 30 ff, et passim. But there is no mention of any "Sarvayana" (is this anywhere attested as a Buddhist term?), and no indication that T'ao Hung-ching conceived of these three separate paths "as one doctrine." T'ao's text will be found in the Chen-kao X- (HY 1010), 19.1b.4-7. Nor do we know that T'ao "had been a Buddhist," though both his paternal grandfather and his mother showed signs of Buddhist piety (Strickmann, "On the Alchemy of T'ao Hung-ching," p. 139). 47 In Taoism and the Rite of Cosmic Renewal, the key phrase was "behind locked temple doors." Saso's stress on the utter secrecy of the practices which he reveals to us should be noted.</page><page sequence="41">MICHEL STRICKMANN 241 Tao and the power over nature resulting from such a union draw all Taoists together in a camaraderie transcending sectarian difference. 'Yii Tao ho I' (to be joined as one with the Tao) is the Taoist key to ecumenism" (p. 13). Christian sectaries please take note! Is it futile to devote so much attention to an obviously poor book? I think not. The Teachings qf Taoist Master Chuang is issued under the imprint of a distinguished university press, and is presented to po- tential readers as a responsible scholarly study. Moreover it treats subjects that are in themselves of the greatest interest: the history of Taoism, the nature of Taoist ritual, the local history and ethnogra- phy of Taiwan. A carefully-written book on some aspect of any one of these topics would have been a valuable contribution. So little preliminary work has been done, however, that the time is clearly not ripe for a larger attempt at synthesis. Yet the average British or American reader is probably not aware of the true state of scholar- ship on these issues. He may not know that there is still no adequate study of the history of Taoism under any single dynasty, hence that much of Saso's "historical" narrative is sheer fiction. He may be unfamiliar with the painstaking efforts of K. M. Schipper and Liu Chih-wan to record present-day Taoist ritual and document its historical evolution, in comparison with which Saso's slapdash descriptions are a travesty. Moreover the reader may not have read the studies of those anthropologists who provide the necessary social data for understanding the function of religion and ritual in Taiwan, a dimension in which Saso's work is almost entirely lacking. In short, there is the danger that The Teachings of Taoist Master Chuang may by default come to be called "the best work on the subject in English," and so find a place on reading lists and in bibliographies. In view of its shortcomings, that would be a pity. Besides alerting readers to the book's faults, however, we should also remind them of the intrinsic importance of the subjects studied. Saso does have the merit of writing on topics of great significance which have been neglected by scholars in the English-speaking world. For the adventurous sinologist, the contents of the Taoist Canon stand as a challenge: still largely unread, untranslated, unexpounded. And for the anthropologist, though his opportunities for direct</page><page sequence="42">242 CHINESE RELIGION observation have been drastically curtailed during the past decades, much remains to be done in the peripheral areas that are still accessible. There is no adequate study of the Taoist priesthood of Hong Kong. The intriguing question of Taoism as the religion of the Yao of northwestern Thailand demands investigation by one who is not only competent in Yao language and ethnography, but who is also able to understand the Chinese liturgical texts treasured by their priests.48 Taoist elements may be discovered in Korean religious practice, in Okinawa, and in diverse religious strata in Japan: Shingon and Tendai Tantric Buddhism, Shugend6 P,*M, Shinto, and various popular cults.49 But Taiwan continues to be the most promising site for inquiry. Recording and analysis should be co- ordinated and systematically extended to cover every aspect of traditional life, social organization, and belief. Building on work already accomplished by Taiwanese scholars, further information should be gathered on all kinds of traditional performances, including the interrelated areas of religous ritual, drama, and storytelling, and additional records should be made of crafts, iconography, and temple 48 The presentation of more than 500 pages of manuscript and description of the circumstances in which the Yao employ them, in Shiratori Yoshir6's volume (see n. 35), contains much that is still puzzling. Among other things, Shiratori and his collaborators appear never to have realized that the texts are Taoist. Pictorial documentation of several of the Yao rites will be found in Shiratori's Tonan Ajia sanchi minzoku shi A1j7j &gt;2 7' [Ijif %tZ (Visual Ethnography: The Hill Tribes of South East Asia) (Tokyo: K6dansha, 1978). 49 There is a posthumously published history of Taoism in Korea by the great historian of Korean Buddhism, Yi Nuing-hwa &gt;Th: Han'gzk Togyosa QWMRP (Seoul: Ton'guk Taehakkyo, 1959), written in literary Chinese.

So far no western scholar has studied the question of Taoist elements in Japanese religious practice, though a good description of some of the milieux in which they may be sought has been written by Carmen Blacker in The Catalpa Bow (London: Allen and Unwin, 1975).

But perhaps the greatest challenge of all lies in the integra- tion of this lingering heritage with the voluminous historical sources. For a fuller understanding of what remains, we must reconstruct the historical background of Taiwanese religious practice. Though Taiwanese survivals do certainly aid us towards a more complete appreciation of Chinese culture, including Taoist ritual as a whole, they are naturally most significant with regard to the distinctive regional and local cultures of Fukien, from which they derive. The ethnohistory of this important region demands detailed investigation: present-day continuity in Taiwan makes such research urgent, and abundant and diverse documentation makes it feasible. The historical record is extremely rich. Extant formal monographs on Fukien begin with the forty-chuan Ch'un-hsi San shan chih Ii of Liang K'o-chia A I (1128-87), on Foochow. There is also the four-chuan Hsien-ch'i chih 1j^, compiled by Huang Yen-sun A cg in 1257, on the more southerly prefecture of Hsing-hua R'( or P'u- t'ien =NW. The same district was the subject of an earlier, less formal collection, the P'u-yang pi-shih = 1ik of Li Chun-fu W (ca. 1214).5O Apart from these precocious specialized works and the even more massive gazetteers that followed, much information on the coastal cities of Fukien is to be found in secular literature, especially from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries on. The religious record is also well furnished. In the second half of the eleventh century, Foochow became a center for the printing of 60 Fukien gazetteers are listed in Chu Shih-chia , Chlng-kzo ti-fang chih tsung-lu rp (Shanghai: Commercial Press, 1935). Though it is works of the 12th and 13th centuries that are most relevant in tracing the origins of present-day religious practice, data on Fukien can of course be found from long before that time.

From 1080 to 1104, the first privately funded printing of the Chinese Buddhist Canon was carried out at the Tung-ch'an Ssu ;I:i+ in that city. Another edition of the Buddhist Canon was engraved on blocks at the K'ai-yiuan Ssu IR3i in Foochow from 1115 to 1150.51 These great projects bear witness to the Buddhist piety of the Fukienese, whose capacity for religious enthusiasm also found outlets in Manichaeism and Islam as well as Taoism.2 Buddhism continued strong in the region. It was from Huang-p'o Shan -VW[i-. between Foochow and P'u-t'ien, that the Ch'an master Yin-yuan MWE (1592-1673) went to Japan. The Huang-p'o/Obaku lineage was the last of the Chinese Buddhist schools to reach Japan, where its monasteries still preserve a copious documentation on Buddhism in Ming-dynasty Fukien.3 Fukienese Buddhist authors were exceedingly prolific, and monastic printing establishments were maintained there on a large scale well into the twentieth century. After a visit to the Yung-ch'iian Ssu i outside of Foochow in 1929, Tokiwa Daijo recorded that in the course of five expeditions to every part of China, he had nowhere else discovered so many Buddhist works that were not to be found in any edition of the Chinese Buddhist Canon. The second most numerous hoard in all China, he wrote, was at the Hsi-ch'an Ssu Wj1t in Foochow itself.5 51 An illustrated description of the Fukienese printings of the Buddhist Canon will be found in the volume entitled Daizokyo, seiritsu to hensen g , Z X compiled by members of Ryuikoku University (Kyoto: Hyakka-en, 1964), pp. 43-50. 52 On Buddhism in Fukien during the T'ang and Five Dynasties, see Chikusa Masaaki A*tj4, "T6 Godai ni okeru Fukken Bukky6 no tenkai ,_ftt J:}-6T3tdgRoD,8 ," Bukkye? shigakz, 7.1 (1958), 24-45.

The editio princeps of the Taoist Canon was realized ca. 1 1 7- 20 in Foochow-not by private subscription, but rather under the exalted auspices of Sung Hui Tsung, with the governor of Foochow actively supervising the work.55 The contents and internal arrange- ment of this first printed Canon are reflected in the Ming Canon that we have today, which also preserves much subsequent Fukienese material from the Southern Sung, Yuan, and Ming.6 Perhaps the most informative works of this class are the writings of the Fukienese master Po Yu-ch'an OIEM (alias Ko Ch'ang-keng AKO, early thirteenth century), the effective founder of Taoism's Southern School (Nan-tsung it'). From Po and his disciples we learn that Fukienese Taoist ritual already had a distinctive local character of its own by the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.57 It is, I think, no accident that many of the rites current in present-day Taiwan can be traced back precisely to this period, which was one of great spiritual creativity throughout China, and particularly in the southeast.58 5 Strickmann, "The Longest Taoist Scripture," History of Religions, 17 (1978), 342-43. 56 An example is the extensive library of works related to the worship of the Hsu brothers, Hsii Chih-cheng *V and Hsu Chih-o , 10th-century figures respec- tively deified as Supreme Monarch of the Golden Porte * J3j; and Supreme Monarch of theJade Porte :E ?V, Perfect Lords of Transcendent Succour ERA. Accorded official recognition in 1236, this Foochow cult came into vogue at the Ming court, and a branch temple was established in Peking early in the 15th-century. See Liu Ts'un-yan #p = "The Penetration of Taoism into the Ming Neo-Confucianist Elite," TP, 57 (1971), 48-50. The texts comprise HY 468-76, 1291-92, and 1456-58; they include rites for pro- pitiating the Perfect Lords, mantic verses revealed by them, hagiographic narratives, and historical materials on their cult-an ample selection of primary sources on which to found a monographic study. 5 Po's most interesting comments on ritual are found in the sayings collected by his disciples, HY 1296 (Hai-ch'iung Po chen-jenyiu-lu g VOAffi.) and HY 1242 (Ching-yii hsiuan-wen f ).

Lin's spiritual progeny are still to be found among the Fukienese of Malaysia, where he is the object of a cult.

We are fortunate in having De Groot's extended record of the annual festivals of Amoy, based on a year's residence there in 1877- 78." De Groot's work is of special relevance to the study of Taiwanese customs, since most of the immigrants to Taiwan came from the more southerly, Min-nan rM1f region of Fukien, and Amoy is directly opposite Chang-chou Wi, one of the principal centres of emigration. Though confined to regularly-scheduled observances, and hence rather sketchy on the Chiao (i, 55-67), De Groot's study is still the most complete description by a westerner of any ensemble of Chinese religious practice.6" It provides us with a rare ethnographic perspective of a century, and the recent reprint will make this work more readily accessible to a new generation of scholars. Crossing to Taiwan itself, we find another large corpus of descrip- tive literature, assembled by Japanese ethnographers during Japan's half-century of occupation (1895-1945).61 Our perspective on University dissertation, "The Uniting of the Ways: The Syncretic Thought of Lin Chao- en," soon to be published by Columbia University Press as The Religion of Lin Chao-en: Syncretism in Ming China. 56 J.

A careful observer of local practice, De Groot had no difficulty in perceiving the close working alliance that existed between Taoism and "Confucianism": Les fetes, ii, 705-6. Now that the imperial order has vanished, this relationship no longer strikes the fieldworker-a single detail that suggests the great value of De Groot's work. There is information on De Groot and an interesting appraisal of his writings in Maurice Freedman, "On the Sociological Study of Chinese Religion," in Religion and Ritual in Chinese Society, pp. 24-31. Before De Groot's time, an informative account of traditional life in Foochow had been published by Justus Doolittle: Social Life of the Chinese, 2 vols. (New York, 1865; rpt. Taipei: Ch'eng-wen, 1966). An excellent source of ethnographic information is the Chinese-English Dictionary of the Vernacular or Spoken Language of Amoy, by Carstairs Douglas (London, 1873; 2nd rev. ed., 1899; rpt. together with Thomas Barclay's Supplement, Taipei, n.d.). 60 De Groot has now been surpassed in point of sheer ethnographic thoroughness by Cornelius Osgood, The Chinese: A Stu4y of a Hong Kong Community, 3 vols.

Moreover it is evident that religion is the principal unifying thread running through this great regional culture. Apart from specialists in Taoism, other sinologists familiar with present-day Chinese religious life have remarked this, and their perception illumines their work.

They will certainly help clarify the role of religion on the local level, and this in turn should aid us in under- standing the function of religion in Chinese history. It is after all not surprising that so little has been done in this direction, given the predominance of the "orthodox" language of Peking in our curricula. Students of Chinese should certainly know of the importance of regional and local cultures in the formation of Chinese culture as a whole. They should also learn that the "dialects" offer more than illustrative material for historical grammar and phonology. They have long been vehicles for potent, distinctive literatures and tradi- tions, and they are still the direct means of access to those traditions today. Perhaps it is the too frequent abstraction of sinology from living realities that in part accounts for our backwardness in coming to grips with Chinese religion. In the perspective of local society, religion has been a vital cohesive force rather than an academic enigma. We should lose no time in fusing the concerns of anthropology and history within Chinese studies, for it is now, on the periphery of the People's Republic, that we have our final opportunity to assimilate the last living vestiges of traditional China, before they are irrevocably lost. 65 There are already many important examples of such integration by scholars working in other fields. For example, by historians studying 16th- and 17th-century England: Keith Thomas, Religion and the Decline of Magic (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1971), and A.D.J. Macfarlane, Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1970). By an anthropologist, working with comparative data: I.M. Lewis, Ecstatic Religion. An Anthropological Study of Spirit Possession and Shamanism (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1971). By a team of researchers including historians and social scientists, on the phenomenon of Tarantism in southern Italy: Ernesto de Martino La terre du remords (Paris: Gallimard, 1966): such collaborative effort is perhaps well suited to the complexi- ties of the Chinese scene. Theoretical discussions by anthropologists include E.E. Evans- Pritchard, "Anthropology and History," in his Social Anthropology and Other Essays (New York: The Free Press, 1964), pp. 172-91, and I.M. Lewis, ed., History and Social Anthro- pology (London: Tavistock, 1968), Introduction, pp. ix-xxviii.</page></plain_text>
