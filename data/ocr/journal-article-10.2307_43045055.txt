<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Worlds of Joseph Smith Gallery Display A display assembled of books, to accompany manuscripts, "The Worlds photographs, of Joseph and Smith" artifacts confer- was assembled to accompany "The Worlds of Joseph Smith" confer- ence at the Library of Congress. Twelve items in this display came from collections in the Library of Congress; three from the Library- Archives of the Community of Christ in Independence, Missouri; two from the L. Tom Perry Special Collections at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah; and thirteen from the LDS Church History Library, Archives, and Museum of Church History and Art in Salt Lake City. The display was organized by James H. Hutson, Director of the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress, and by John W. Welch, Editor in Chief of BYU Studies. They were assisted by Larry Draper, Kristi Bell, and others at BYU, and also by Steve L. Olsen, Glenn N. Rowe, and several others on the staff of the LDS Church Historian's office. The display was finalized and mounted in the foyer and display cases of the Coolidge Auditorium by the Library's Exhibition Office. The captions were researched and written by John Welch, with assistance from Steven C. Harper, document editor for BYU Studies; the texts were then edited by the Exhibition Office. lhe captions that appear here are lengthened from the labels that were used in the dis- play cases. Among other additions, quotations have been expanded and further sources have been supplied, drawing attention especially to relevant articles in BYU Studies and to works authored by present- ers at this conference. 119</page><page sequence="2">120 The Worlds of Joseph Smith Portrait of Joseph Smith (photograph of original). This oil portrait of the Prophet was painted "from life" in September of 1842, most likely by David W. Rogers of New York. It is one of the few images that compares closely with a plaster mask made of Joseph shortly after his martyrdom in 1844 and is thus considered to be an accurate reflection of his likeness. Upon the death of Joseph Smith, Apostle John Taylor reflected solemnly, "Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it" (Doctrine and Covenants 135:3).

After trav- eling from Missouri to Kirtland, Ohio, Mormon convert Albert Brown wrote this letter to his parents. He had found rel- atives "all in good health and the church in great prosperity, her members increasing and the bless- ings of heaven pourd out apon them," while calami- ties awaited those who "obey not the fullness of the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ." Albert also mentions the purchase by the Church in Kirtland of four Egyptian mummies for $2,400 in order to obtain an ancient record "containing some of the history of Josef while in egypt and also of Jacob and many prophesise Delivered by them Many of the learned have been to kirtland to examine the characters but none of them have been able to tell but very little about them and yet Joseph without any of the wisdom of this world can read them and know what they are."

He protested to President Martin Van Buren: "Such was not the liberty" that his father had fought for as a Revolutionary War soldier or that he per- sonally had stood for in the Battle of Sackets Harbour in the War of 1812. Hundreds of affidavits of plunder, rape, and murder were collected by the Latter-day Saints after their expulsion from Missouri under the governors order of extermination.

When Joseph Smith traveled to Washington, D.C., to seek help from federal officials in redressing damages suffered in the 1838 Mormon conflict in Missouri, he carried with him several letters of introduc- tion. This letter was signed by General James Adams (1783-1843), an Indian war veteran, lawyer, and justice of the peace in Springfield, Illinois. He states that the Missouri "outrages are unparalleled in the annals of civilized communities" and encouraged President Van Buren "to sustain the rights of all the citizens of our great Republic."

In April 1844 a call went out for volunteers to "electioneer for Joseph to be the next President" (History of the Church, 6:325). Some 340 signed up and were actively canvassing the country when Joseph Smith was murdered in Carthage, Illinois, in June 1844. They disseminated Smiths views on law and politics via this pamphlet. Joseph Smith advo- cated the elimination of prisons except for murderers, punishing offenders by having them work on public roads so they can be "taught more wisdom and more virtue," and the abolition of slavery by 1850, compensating slave owners with revenue from the sale of western lands. He extolled the civic virtues of honor, honesty, generosity, equality, and friendship toward all, "from any country, of whatever color, clime or tongue." The full text of this pamphlet is published in Joseph Smith Jr., History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, ed. В. H. Roberts, 2d ed., rev., 7 vols. (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1971), 6:197-209. On Joseph Smiths presidential campaign, see Margaret C.

This composite by Gustavus Hills, lithographed by J. Chalds, New York, is based on the plats of the original surveys of Nauvoo, Illinois, founded 1839 on the east bank of a large bend in the Mississippi River. Colors on the map indicate the different surveys. Temple Square (block 20) is in the center of town, on Wells Street between Knight and Mulholland Streets. Joseph Smiths residence is on the south waterfront. In the upper left is a preliminary drawing of the Nauvoo Temple by William Weeks, temple architect; in the lower left is Joseph Smith in his Nauvoo Legion uniform, drawn by Sutcliffe Maudsley. Historian Richard Bushman describes how "the temple, the city, and the gathering formed a pattern of movement and preparation in a distinctive Mormon geography." With the temple at its center, Nauvoo typified Mormon city building. "The whole scheme divided space in two," Bushman explains, "with Zion and the temple at the center emanating spiritual power, and a Babylon-like world outside, where people were to be converted and brought to Zion, the mis- sionaries going out and the converts coming in." Joseph Smith planned temples for the geographi- cal center, and, in Nauvoos case, the most elevated spot of the city. Chicago and Nauvoo grew apace with each other, but, as Bushman notes, "In Chicago the market drew people rather than the temple." Chicago's civic leaders were business magnates. Nauvoos were prophets and apostles. Nauvoos geog- raphy and sacred architecture are keys to understanding both Joseph Smith and his followers. Joseph rose to power because, in the minds of converts, he opened the heavens and accessed divine power. "He could," writes Bushman, "come to power only in a society where divine intelligence and spiritual power outranked wealth and business acumen on the scale of values." Richard L. Bushman, "Making Space for the Mormons," Leonard J. Arrington Mormon History Lecture Series, number 2, delivered October 22, 1996, at Utah State University, Logan, Utah.

When Joseph Smith was murdered in June 1844, David Kilbourne of Fort Madison, Iowa Territory, has- tened to write "of the wonder- ful events which have taken place," recounting the events of Smiths death from the per- spective of an antagonist. This contrasting four-page letter by Albert Brown, written less than four months after the tragic shooting, recounts at length the widely discussed details of that event. Brown justifies the destruction of the Nauvoo Expositor as a pub- lic "neusance" according to the "constitution and laws of Illinois." He tells of the unlaw- ful detention of Joseph and Hyrum, and of their murder by troops irresponsibly left in Carthage by Illinois Governor Thomas Ford. He also re- counted the rumor that had spread quickly about "a flash of light" that preventing the assassins from beheading the lifeless corpse of Joseph Smith. Brown doubted that any of the murderers would be brought to justice, since "no murderer has ever bin punished I believe sinse the world began for mur- dering a Prophit of the Lord." David Kilbournes cor- respondence regarding Joseph Smiths martyrdom is housed in the State Historical Society of Iowa, Des Moines, and published in Warren A.

Built at a cost in excess of one million dollars, the Nauvoo Temple was constructed from 1841 to 1846. In the temple, thousands of Latter-day Saints received blessings and endowments of spiritual power. The temple was destroyed by arson in 1848, after which its walls were demolished by a tornado. The Nauvoo Temple has recently been reconstructed for use as originally intended. This fragment is part of a hand holding a trumpet above a sunstone. A complete sunstone is on permanent display in the National Museum of American History, Washington, D.C. See Glen M.

Ramsey painted it in 1923 for the centennial of the first appearance of the Angel Moroni to Joseph Smith on September 21-22, 1823. Joseph Smith described Moroni as "standing in the air, for his feet did not touch the floor. He had on a loose robe of the most exquisite whiteness His hands were naked, and his arms also, a little above the wrist; so, also, were his feet naked, as were his legs, a little above the ankles. His head and neck were also bare [H]is whole person was glorious beyond description, and his countenance truly like lightning" (Joseph Smith-History 1:30-32). Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris testified that the angel appeared to them in 1829 and showed them the plates from which Joseph Smith trans- lated the Book of Mormon, a testament of Jesus Christ from a past world.

The Book of Mormon was dic- tated by Joseph Smith to scribes, who made a verbatim word-for-word tran- scription, as seen here, with no punc- tuation. This page contains the text of 1 Nephi 2:23-3:18. Oliver Cowdery was the scribe for the first 13 lines of this page, but an unidentified scribe began writing mid- sentence on line 14, "I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded." This cor- roborates the testimony of scribes. Josephs wife, Emma Hale, sometimes his scribe, said that when returning "after meals, or after interruptions, he would at once begin where he had left off, without either seeing the manu- script or having any portion of it read to him. This was a usual thing for him to do. It would have been improbable that a learned man could do this; and, for one so ignorant and unlearned as he was, it was simply impossible." It is noteworthy that no cross-outs or modifications were made on this man- uscript as the dictation flowed, phrase after phrase.

In December 1830, Joseph Smith commenced his revision of the King James Version of the Bible. He worked on this project until July 1833. While reading and pondering the Bible, Joseph received and recorded several additional scriptures. This manuscript, written by W. W. Phelps (1792-1872) in 1835 in Kirtland, Ohio, contains Josephs dictation of Moses 1:1-6. It tells how Moses was taken up into the presence of God, was shown the endless worlds created by God, and was called to a work in the similitude of Gods Only Begotten. The Book of Moses is now pub- lished in the Pearl of Great Price, considered by Latter-day Saints to be a standard work of canonized scripture along with the Bible, the Book of Mormon, and the Doctrine and Covenants.

John Bernhisel sent Joseph Smith a copy of this book. In his thank you letter, Joseph commented, "It unfolds &amp; developes many things that are of great importance to this generation &amp; corresponds with &amp; supports the testimony of the Book of Mormon; I have read the volumes with the greatest interest." This impressive two-volume work was rich with etchings of buildings and monu- ments, such as this stela at Quirigua, Guatemala. Stephens' detailed observations led many early LDS leaders, including Parley P. Pratt, John Taylor, John E. Page, Orson Pratt, and George Q. Cannon, per- sonally to consider Mesoamerica as the central area in the geography of the Book of Mormon. Dean C.

Joseph Smith was inter- ested in American antiquities. When John Lloyd Stephens' book was published in 1841, it attracted immediate atten- tion among the Latter-day Saints. This article contains Stephens' descriptions of "a large round stone, with the sides sculptured in hiero- glyphics," that once stood in the midst of a "large city" on the banks of a wide, fordable river but whose "name is lost, its history unknown," evok- ing strongly asserted con- nections with the Book of Mormon city of Zarahemla: "We are not agoing to declare positively that the ruins of Quirigua are those of Zarahemla, but [it would take much] to prove that the ruins of the city in question, are not one of those referred to in the Book of Mormon." Although the Church has never taken an official stand on the loca- tion of Book of Mormon geography, this 1842 editorial shows that in Joseph Smiths day Central America was considered as the plausible heartland of ancient Nephite civilization.

This image is attributed to Norwegian artist Danquart Anton Weggeland. It offers a strong profile of the Prophet. Beginning with his First Vision, Joseph Smith boldly challenged the theological world. As he recounted: "When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all descrip- tion, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other - This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!" In the face of much opposition, he testified to the end of his life: "I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it" (Joseph Smith-History 1:17, 25). Documented accounts of Joseph Smiths First Vision are presented and discussed in John W.

On June 11, 1829, this original application was filed in the Northern District of the District Court of the United States, received by clerk of the court, R. R. Lansing. The handwritten description of this form uses the words that now appear on the title page of the Book of Mormon. Joseph Smith said that these words were found on the last of the plates of Mormon. The printed text on this form shows that Joseph Smiths application was filed pursuant to federal law, which allowed "authors and proprietors" to secure a copyright on maps, charts, and books. The Book of Mormon would in fact need this protection, especially as it challenged the sensitivities and beliefs of many Americans. Joseph successfully asserted this copyright when, during publica- tion of the Book of Mormon in Palmyra, New York, Abner Cole pilfered several pages for publication in his own newspaper.

Similar to the title page eventually used in the first edition of the Book of Mormon in 1830, this proof sheet is the earliest printed Mormon page. This page speaks of the spirit of prophesy and revelation, the coming forth of sealed scriptures, the Lord s covenants with the house of Israel, and convincing the Jew and the Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the eternal God, who manifests himself unto all nations.

Published in March 1830, the Book of Mormon testified of a premortal Jesus who had appeared as an anthropomorphic spirit to an early prophet, of messianic foreknowledge held by Israelite and Nephite prophets, of the infinite and eternal atonement of Jesus Christ, and of the physical appearance of the resurrected Jesus to the people at the temple in Bountiful in the New World. The Book of Mormon rejected the practice of infant baptism, required repentance and baptism by immer- sion, articulated a strong covenant theology, eschewed the use of a paid clergy, established two levels of priesthood ordination, and gave instructions for administering and partaking of the sacrament in remembrance of Jesus Christ's body and blood.

Joseph Smith was fasci- nated with the world view and the priesthood powers he saw represented in ancient manu- scripts. For example, Figure 1 (in the center) represents the primal point of creation. Figure 3 represents God "clothed with power and authority." Figure 7 represents God on his throne. Round disks such as this were placed under the heads of mummies to help orient their souls to the eternal cos- mos. The explanations Joseph Smith gave for the figures on this hypocephalus are incom- plete. Figures 9-21 were to be interpreted at some future time. The original from which this engraving was made has long been lost. Very few frag- ments of Joseph Smiths several papyri have survived, leaving the relationship between the lost papyri and the Book of Abraham uncertain.

In November 1831, Joseph Smith and a council of newly ordained high priests collected about 65 of the Prophets early revelations for publica- tion as "The Book of Commandments." The original plan was to print 10,000 copies. A mob destroyed the printing establishment on July 20, 1833, in the midst of the print run. Perhaps 100 copies of the incomplete book were salvaged from the fire. About 24 copies are known to survive today. These rev- elations, most of which are now included in the Doctrine and Covenants, issued bold warnings to the world regarding impending judgments of God, commanded people to repent, directed the organiza- tion of the Church, instructed missionaries, proclaimed the law of the Lord, described the gifts of the Spirit, and promised Gods blessings for faithful obedience to Jesus Christ. On the millenarian context of these early revelations, see Grant Underwood, The Millenarian World of Early Mormonism (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1993). § ¡3 Л I t 0 "a, 1 r и "о ít &lt;/î 0 ī д Я 1 i о о со % ой I1</page><page sequence="23">Gallery Display 141 Doctrine and Covenants (First edition, Kirtland, Ohio, 1835). In 1835, Joseph Smith, his counselors, and the Kirtland High Council compiled and published this 284-page book entitled Doctrine and Covenants of the Church of the Latter Day Saints: Carefully Selected from the Revelations of God. Part 1 presented seven theological lectures on faith, including "ideas of the character, perfections and attributes of God" and the knowledge and sacrifice a person must manifest in order to exercise faith unto eternal life and salvation. Part 2 contained 99 revelations, 3 appendices, a testimony of the Twelve Apostles, and an index. Among its chal- lenging and innovative contents are the vision of the three kingdoms of glory in the afterlife (D&amp;C 76), several revelations on priesthood (D&amp;C 20, 84, 86, 107), the school of the prophets (D&amp;C 88), health and diet ("a word of wisdom," D&amp;C 89), and the order of the Church for the benefit of the poor (D&amp;C 104).

This 64-page booklet, pub- lished by John Taylor, con- tained Joseph Smiths famous King Follett discourse, a funeral tribute delivered at a general conference in April 1844. Notes from that speech briefly indi- cate that Joseph Smith declared, "It is necessary for us to have an understanding of God him- self in the beginning. If we start right, it is easy to go right all the time, but . . . there are a very few beings in the world who understand rightly the char- acter of God God himself was once as we are now, and is an exalted man." Other topics addressed by Joseph Smith on that occasion include the power of the Father and the Son; the premortal council of the Gods; creation as organization of eter- nally existing matter; mankinds eternal intelligence; conversing with God; death and advancing in knowledge; salvation for all mankind, living and dead; repentance; and baptism by water and the Holy Ghost by those holding priesthood keys and authority.

From the outset, Joseph Smith published abroad numerous revelations, newspapers, pamphlets, and proclamations. In 1831, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints purchased a printing press, its first major asset. As found in this 1844 pamphlet, Joseph Smith penned the thirteen Articles of Faith in an open letter to John Wentworth, editor of the Chicago Democrat and member of Congress. Also included is Joseph Smiths corre- spondence with James Arlington Bennet, of Arlington House, Long Island, and with John C. Calhoun, Senator from South Carolina, along with various political and religious statements of Joseph Smith. Missionaries made use of pamphleteering to spread their message in many lands. This pamphlet was published by Elders John E. Page and L. R. Foster in New York City. Joseph Smiths 1842 letter to John Wentworth is published in Dean C. Jessee, ed., The Papers of Joseph Smith, 2 vols. (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1989-92), 1:427-37.

In March 1842 Joseph Smith briefly outlined the "rise, progress, perse- cution, and faith of the Latter-Day Saints" as a courtesy to Chicago edi- tor John Wentworth. The last page of the Wentworth Letter includes thirteen Articles of Faith, stating to the world the basic beliefs of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints, organized in 1830. From its beginning the Church assumed Christ's great commission. The command to teach and baptize all nations can hardly be overstated as a motivational force for getting missionaries to faraway places to persuade people of diverse cultures to believe in the gospel restored by Joseph Smith. An 1831 revelation, for example, urged Smith to send missionaries "unto the ends of the world" and "to lay the foundation of this church, and to bring it forth out of obscurity" (Doctrine and Covenants 1:23, 30). Missions were local in the beginning, but by 1837 stretched across the Atlantic to the British Isles. By 1842 elders of the church had "planted the gospel in almost every state in the Union," as well as in England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Joseph Smith articulated his global perspective to Wentworth: "Our missionaries are going forth to different nations, and in Germany, Palestine, New Holland, the East Indies, and other places, the standard of truth has been erected: no unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing: persecutions may rage, mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independently till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear; till the purposes of God shall be accomplished and the great Jehovah shall say the work is done."

In April 1840, Joseph Smith dispatched apostle Orson Hyde to dedicate the Holy Land for the return of the Jews. On his return in 1842, Hyde stopped in Germany, where one of his students translated into German this 115-page treatise he had written. Its title page reads: A Call from the Wilderness , A Voice from the Depths of the Earth: A Brief Overview of the Origins and Doctrine of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in America , Known by Many under the Label of "The Mormons " by Orson Hyde, a Priest of this Church , Frankfurt 1842 , a self-publication of the author.

The great commission to spread the gospel throughout the world has been one of the main missions of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints since its inception. Samuel Smith became a missionary in April 1830. Heber С. Kimball was called in 1837 to open the work in the British Isles. By the 1850s, missions had been opened in Chile, France, Germany, Gibraltar, Hawaii, India, Italy, Malta, Denmark, South Africa, the South Pacific, and Switzerland. This epistle from the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles was sent to the branches and conferences of the Church in Europe. It addresses several social and economic pressures already felt by this burgeoning religion. The letter gives instructions to "facilitate the gathering of the Saints" to Nauvoo, Illinois, and teaches of unity "to ameliorate the condition of those who are struggling with poverty, and distress."

It declares that "the kingdom of God has come, as has been pre- dicted by ancient prophets, and prayed for in all ages." lhe opening pages declare that God has again communed with those on earth by visions and holy messengers, by whom "the great and eternal High Priesthood" has been restored, holding the keys "to administer in all things pertaining to the ordinances, organization, government and direction of the kingdom of God."

The first foreign language edition of the Book of Mormon was this Danish translation, printed in Copenhagen in 1851. Latter-day Saint missionaries arrived in Denmark in 1850, shortly after that country had adopted a new constitution, modeled in certain ways after the Constitution of the United States. Aided by the freedom of religion thus afforded in Denmark, Mormon missionaries met with consider- able success. Thousands of Danish converts soon immigrated to Utah. As of 2005, the Book of Mormon has been translated into 104 languages.

After Joseph Smiths death, he was memorialized in many ways in many lands. George Cannon made the casket in which Joseph was buried, and he also cast plaster masks of both Joseph and Hyrum Smith as their bodies lay in state. Apostle John Taylor, who witnessed the assassination of Joseph Smith and was himself critically wounded, took Cannons mask to Lucius Gahagan, a prominent British artist in London, along with several sketches of the prophet. A committee of men who had known Joseph intimately worked directly with the artist as he produced this bust. Taylor com- mented that the artist had "obtained as correct a likeness as [was] possible ... at such a period from [Joseph Smiths] death."
