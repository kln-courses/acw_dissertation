<plain_text><page sequence="1">Patterns of Myth: Alpha - The Myths of Creation; The Wisdom of the Serpent; The Two Hands of God. By CHARLES H. LONG, JOSEPH L. HENDERSON, MAUD OAKES, ALAN W. WATTS. General Editor ALAN W. WATTS. New York: George Braziller, 1963. ix+264; viii+253; ix+261 pages. $18.00. ($6 per volume). The methodology of these three volumes rests on the conviction that religion can be studied in non-reductionist terms. The author of the first volume follows a Christian theologian, Joachim Wach, as well as the century's foremost scholar in comparative religion, Professor Mircea Eliade. In a snappy forward Alan Watts, the general editor of these volumes, sets the style for them; these are not learned, but impressionistically ex- cellent collections of myths and tales from many</page><page sequence="2">278 JOURNAL OF BIBLE AND RELIGION peoples, under the common heading of an erudite eclecticism. The first volume, significantly called Alpha, surveys the world's myths of creation - emergence myths, world-parent myths, the crea- tion from chaos and from the cosmic egg, creation from nothing, the earth-diver myths. The ethnic groups, ancient and contemporary, whose tales are brought in here as paradigms, are the Navaho and other Pueblo Indians; the Babylonian lore, Polynesian, ancient Near Eastern, Egyptian, the Orphic myths, the Indian myths, and specimens of the more important remaining Eurasian myths. The approach is historical. It disencountenances the view still held by many scholars that myth and religion were the best teachers of an untutored past; and it proceeds on the assumption that myth is an expression heuristically indispensable for the study of cultural history. In tracing the his- tory of comparative religion, the author starts where one would expect him to, with Frazer. He then scans the ethnological and anthropological research done in religion by the pioneers beginning with Tyler, through Malinowski into our present age. Durkheim, Freud, Rudolf Otto, and other classical scholars who must be claimed as founding fathers of comparative religion, whether they would like it or not; they created the theoretical framework of the scientific study of religion as a universe of discourse. Whereas most students of these subjects are familiar with the said authors, considerably fewer people might have heard about Gaster's "topocosm" (p. 24). Charles Long combines extreme erudition with a hunch for what is important albeit relatively unknown in this dis- cipline. And indeed, the notion of "the total corporate unit of all elements" does seem helpful in a heuristic sense. In all the creation myths which Charles Long has incorporated in his volume, the structural arrangement of the terrestrial and celestial ele- ments, in their intermediary stages, are as in- teresting to the student of religion proper as to the anthropologist. It is revealing to see that the idea of representing these schemes in the form of diagrams, derived from quasi-diagrammatical rep- resentation with some mythological traditions, could create a model for descriptive diagrams that might well be used by scholars of the future. Following Coomaraswamy (p. 69), the in- terpretation of the erotic sculptures in Konarak and in other Indian temples, however, seems wrong in the sense that this type of sculpture does not symbolize the procreative role of the sun or other deities, but rather the psycho- experimental syndromes of seminal retention and control which signify the tantric tradition, and of which the Konarak cluster is most certainly paradigmatical. In the case of Indian erotic sculp- ture, of course, it is often hard to say whether or not there is a relation to some cosmic myth. It is quite possible that the function of these sculptures is a dual one, in that the exoteric or creation myth-explanation may have been the one given to the lay people, whereas the esoteric, psycho- experimental or tantric explanation was reserved for the initiate. Earth-diver myths as a category of diffuse- mythology, seems to be a novel and important discovery. The symbolism of water, the sym- bolism of the descent of some heroic or divine being into the water, and the antagonism between the divine beings eventuating in or resulting from the diving complex, are important heuristic devices for the study of a pervasive set of myths. Earl Count believes that the dualistic conceptions which stem from the Near Eastern religions are at the basis of the dualistic notions of the Eurasian earth-diver myths. From the selection of texts, however, it seems to follow that the earth-diver myths are a universal element, probably not due to diffusion, but to parallel invention. If this could be worked out, it might give a clue to the verification of several Jungian themes which have been left unsubstantiated by Jung and the Ascot group. In the conclusion of the first volume Long states that the volume was an attempt to give an historical-phenomenological interpretation to the religious structures found in various types of myths (p. 217). As a tool, Long suggests that the anthropological notion of wholes, cultural wholism that is to say, provides the best approach. But his inspiration is considerably older than contem- porary anthropology; it goes back largely to Rudolf Otto's standard work. Highly interesting matter, contained in the appendicies, might have been worked into the text itself. The authors of the second volume, Joseph L. Henderson and Maud Oakes, are perhaps even closer to the Jungian tradition than Charles Long. Henderson is a neuro-psychiatrist and Maud</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 279 Oakes a painter. Both of them have that specific empathy which marks the Ascot group and the more sophisticated followers of Jung. The themes in this volume are of a wide range, but they could be subsumed under the title, "Birth, Death and Transition." Fear of death as the prime motive, death and rebirth as the cosmic pattern, initiation and the personal encounter with the teacher, initiation as psychic liberation, and the magic flight diffusely common to the shaman as to other non-scriptural sacerdotalists in many societies, rebirth and resurrection as mythical reading of the process of individuation - these are the themes Henderson adumbrates in his introduction. Following the pattern set in all these volumes, Miss Oakes adduces translations of myths from virtually all parts of the world, both ancient and contemporary. This volume has a somewhat weak appendix listing further examples on the theme of death and rebirth in poetry, which might profitably have been omitted. The third volume is the work of the general editor, Alan W. Watts. Its title, The Two Hands of God, is subtitled The Myths of Polarity. Perhaps this is the most intriguing of the three volumes. As always, Watts displays an uncanny hunch for the way in which religion functions in its more bizarre aspects. Among popular scholars of com- parative religion he is perhaps the only one who ridicules the ludicrous: ". . . but at the midnight bell the forces of Light took over with incom- parable sentimentality. Schubert's 'Ave Maria,' and a procession of shadows of figures - monks, perhaps - carrying candles through a cathedral- like forest!" summarizes his pleasantly cynical approach. Still, this reviewer is persuaded that Watts is aware of the comic aspect of religion from within. The Devil, God, sentimental music, LSD 25, and lovemaking are perhaps not as incompatible in metaphysical reality as the stem teachers of the orthodox world religions would have it. Basically, Alan Watts thinks that what- ever the philosophical constructs in the world's religions, monistic, dualistic, or otherwise, the fundamental mythological pattern is radical dual- ism; this accounts for the title of this volume. Whether it is a primordial pair, the cosmic dance, the story of the two brothers or two sisters, or the alienation of one particular cosmic principle from another, conceived in an anthropomorphic or theriomorphic fashion, it all boils down to this radical dualism which seems to provide the general matrix of mythological thought. Watts does not believe, on his own statement, that mythology has reached the status of a science, and it is due to this lack of belief that his choice of selections is not burdened down with pedantic boredom. Whenever pure scholars in these arts have their ways, books to tend to become tedious. This trilogy is not. Special mention has to be made of the excellence of the numerous plates which are interspersed throughout all three volumes. Still, it might have been wiser to collect all the plates at the end of each volume, for greater surveyability. We must now look forward to the second set of three volumes, The Human Image, which will include The Myths of the Hero, The Myths of the Royal Father, and the Myths of the Goddess.
