Green, Roman Religion and the Cult of Diana at Arida (Cambridge: Cam- bridge University Press, 2007), XXVI + 347 pp. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009 Carin Green's new book on the cult of Diana opens with a vivid description of the view approaching the goddess's sanctuary at Aricia. The emphasis on location, a religion of place, as well as the primacy of the ritual experience it- self are a constant trend throughout this volume which deftly combines the latest archaeological finds with the puzzling textual evidence for this rather unusual sanctuary, whose history was tightly intertwined with Rome's de- velopment from the earliest days to the imperial era. The first archaeological remains from the site can be dated to the Neolithic and the Bronze Ages (ca. 6000-ca. 950 BCE), and miniature votive pots from the Archaic era (ca. 8th to 6th c. BCE) offer the first physical evidence that we can associate with the sanc- tuary, which flourished until the 2nd century CE and likely survived for about two hundred more years. Undoubtedly, the site is best known by Classicists for the ritual of the rex Nemorensis, the fugitive slave who claims his priestly title by seizing a bough from the sacred tree of the sanctuary and killing the previous priest in a sin- gle combat. The key source is Servius, Ad Aen. 6.136, which describes Aeneas and the Sibyl offering a golden bough to the gatekeeper of the underworld in order to gain admission. This myth had engaged the imagination of many scholars and artists already earlier in the nineteenth century, when in 1890 James G. Frazer famously opened his Golden Bough with a discussion of the Arician Grove, claiming that the ritual killing was associated with fertility and that the priest was identified as the mythical guardian of the spirit of the sa- cred oak tree. Frazer saw the killing of the priest and the burning of the bough as replacing an annual summer sacrifice for the following year's crops. Tile notion of this fertility ritual, together with Frazer's suggestion of related mys- teries at the sanctuary, became highly influential among writers and thinkers interested in ancient myth, even though the response of the scholarly com- munity has been mixed.

Subsequently many other scholars offered critical insights, but Carin Green is one of the few willing to present not only a review of the rich but confusing evidence, but also a comprehensive interpretation of the sanc- tuary and the ritual.1 Well aware of the complex history and historiography of the sanctuary and its mythic ritual, Green starts by examining the history of the site follow- ing a chronological outline. The first chapter ("The Sanctuary of Diana at Ari- da to the Augustan Age," pp. 3-33) takes us from the Archaic beginnings to the Augustan era. Around 500 BCE, as a fragment of Cato the Elder suggests (fr. 58 Peter), the sanctuary came to be associated with a Latin alliance that did not include Rome; after the city's incorporation into the Roman alliance, Arida was granted full citizen rights and became the first way station from Rome on the Via Appia. Green follows those who see in the new temple, built around 300 BCE, the self-assertion of the Arician elite in religious terms, contrasting their extensive, gold-roofed structure with Rome's general austerity in reli- gious building.2 The wide appeal of the sanctuary can be attributed to the in- creasing interest in medicine among Italians from the fourth century on (as attested in anatomical ex- votos), and it is proven by the flourishing businesses assodated with a much frequented sanctuary, such as banking functions and numerous enterprises serving visitors. Green proposes that during the Late Republic the sanctuary purposely fashioned itself as "archaic," "wild," and possibly even "barbarian," relying on a notion of the "Scythian Diana." Chap- ter 2 ("The Sanctuary at the Augustan Age," pp. 34-54) focuses on the coming of the Augustan era, which saw these "wild" associations of otherness put to political uses; thus, Antony criticized Octavian for his "Ariana maier,1' based on the businesses of the Atii in Aricia (Cic. Phil. 3.6.15). But appropriating this Diana for his Apollonian rule, as well as ordering Orestes's supposed bones to be transferred from the Arician sanctuary to a new temple of Saturn in Rome (as Green confirms), Octavian successfully fashioned the cult into a peaceful symbol for his new Golden Age. As chapter 3 ("The Sanctuary in the Empire," pp. 55-70) shows, his successors evoked the metaphor of the ritual king until late into the second century when an earthquake ruined the sanc- tuary, from which there was neither symbolic nor literal recovery. In chapter 4 ("Diana: Her Name and Her Appearance," pp. 71-86), Green turns to the linguistic and material evidence associated with the goddess's name and appearance. Of course, these areas offer rather distinct types of data: speculation about the Indo-Eurpoean origins of 'Dïana' (preferred with a short ï overall, rather than with the long F we know from the dï stem and which usu- ally refers to "light") takes us back to the time before the material evidence.

Relying on recent post-colonial theories to modify the traditional Hellenization narratives, Green argues that it would be reductive to consider the influence of Greek myth and iconography as coming to dominate the cult in this period. Her con- clusions, namely that we must consider the process as a creative negotiation between locals and Hellenic cultural influences, and that the figure of Diana was multi-cultural and more complicated than either a thesis of Ur-Roman origins or one suggesting thorough Hellenization might seem to imply, are right on point. Chapter 5 ("The Grove, the Goddess and the History of Early Latium," pp. 87-111) moves to the discussion of the early sanctuary in its ar- chaic and early Republican political context. Green relies on a distinction be- tween, on the one hand, the type of regular festivities, like that of Jupiter Latiaris, associated with all Latins and, on the other hand, the irregular meet- ings of some Latin groups associated with Diana's capacity to enforce truce while the parties may be negotiating. Rome's sixth king, Servius Tullius, tried to establish the former, federal type of cult to Diana on the Aventine, outside of the pomerium, but failed. While Green believes, arguably, that it was the lat- ter, irregular meetings that led to the very development of the Latin League itself (pp. 93-94), she claims that Diana never became the federal goddess of the first type, as she is frequently seen. In Chapter 6 ("The Many Faces of Diana," pp. 112-145) Green challenges the separation Wissowa once made be- tween Diana in her Ur-form as a women's goddess and her later form, bor- rowed from Artemis, as a hunting deity. Re-inscribing hunting as an aspect of life into the late Bronze Age settlements of Latium, her argument connects the rituals of hunters with an interest in the moisturizing qualities of the moon, which was not only connected to women, menstruation and childbirth, but which hunters also needed for tracing scent. Green presents the Republican cult as a continuation of this connected tradition to which the third-century adaptation of Artemis only added further layers of complication, leading to a multifaceted goddess, as warrior-huntress, an expert in techne (not only of hunting), a protector of the cross-roads (trivium, shaped in the y of the bough), and a deity of the underworld - a complex image of the goddess to conclude Part I of the monograph. In Part II, Green reconsiders a number of figures associated with the cult of Diana at Aricia. Chapter 7 ("The Necessary Murderer," pp. 147-184), fo- cusing on the rex netnorensis, aims at reconstructing an "original" hunting rit- ual in which a younger hunter (a fugitive slave) "hunted" the current king and emerged with his dead body to claim the title for himself. Green sees the associations of the cult with notions from Greek mythology, from Pythagore- anism and from the political history of Rome (where the last king was, sig- nificantly, not killed but exiled) as later additions to the original ritual, thereby practically offering a new evolutionary thesis, this time with a hunter ritual at the origin. Chapter 8 ("'We Are Fugitives,'" pp. 185-207) turns to exiles and fugitives, first to the fugitive who claimed the throne for himself. Green skill- fully connects the cult story to the violent history of Rome's early kings whose lives included exile as much as violent beginnings and ends, in particular in the case of Servius, a king of slave origin, who dedicated a temple of Diana on</page><page sequence="4">580 International Journal of the Classical Tradition I September I December 2009 the Aventine which was later associated with slave celebrations. A similar jux- taposition of murder, exile, slavery and barbarism embedded in the Greek sto- ries of Orestes allowed the Aricians to incorporate this hero as a founder figure into the myth of the sanctuary and offer a release from the symbolic madness that hunting (or war) affected on men in a certain sense. Finally, in Chapter 9 ("Virbius, Hippolytus and Egeria," pp. 208-233), we move on to the lesser fig- ures of the cult. Virbius and the Hippolytus of Greek myth are hard to sepa- rate from each other in our tradition, except in Virgil, who makes Hippolytus the father of Virbius and a newly invented Aricia his mother (Aen. 7.761-4.), which incidentally would have much pleased Augustus, who probably wished to rebuke Antony's degrading insult of his mother as "Ariana mater," by suggesting a more positive alternative association of Aricia. Pace Frazer, Green carefully distinguishes the rex from Virbius /Hippolytus, in the latter of whom she sees a hunter who was originally Diana's consort, who later, after having violated Diana and died, was reborn with the help of Asclepius and forever hidden in the goddess's woods. The figure of Egeria, the spring, who was once King Numa's consort, or possibly that of Egerius (understood as an exile-king without inheritence), seems especially meaningful in the mourn- ing associated with the possibly annual death and rebirth of Virbius (and the less frequent death and renewal of the rex Nemorensis himself) - even though she and Virbius, connected as they were with Aricia, occur in no known rit- ual of the sanctuary, only in vague associations of Diana with healing and childbirth. Part III is dedicated to a reconstruction of the religious experience of heal- ing at the Diana sanctuary. In Chapter 10 ("Diana the Healer," pp. 235-255), Green rereads the Cynegetica of Grattius as evidence for the kind of empirical medical practices that may have been performed in the religious context of healing at the Arician sanctuary - a text that includes pragmatic advice for the training and care of hunting dogs, as well as the depiction of a sacrifice to Diana. Beyond the skin problems which belonged to the goddess's territory of expertise, Chapter 11 ("Ritual Healing and the Maniae," pp. 256-279) exam- ines the references in our evidence to maniae, pastry figures of deformed human beings, in association with the Arician sanctuary. The full integration of humoral theory (taken from rational medicine with the Hippocratic ideal of balance) and the direct connections with the cosmologie vision of the human body in Empedoclean and Pythagorean teachings Green makes, at least in this reviewer's opinion, may not be necessary for her hypothesis to stand, namely that these deformed pastries, baked of flour and water with fire and air, rep- resented a transformative element, as they were symbolically destroyed "in death," within the sanctuary's ritual. Connecting these various themes, weav- ing myths and practices of varied origins together, is in fact what the sanctu- ary seems to have done best. Nothing can remind us of this better than Green's offering the original and a translation of Servius, Ad Aen. 6.136 with some im- portant commentary, which concludes the volume as an appendix ("Appen- dix," pp. 297-302): this is the famous passage on the golden bough which, as Green emphasizes, any would-be rex had to take physically prior to the fight and through which he could claim his priestly position.3 3.

Her thorough coverage implicitly situates this rich material of myth and ritual in an anthropological perspective akin to that of Walter Burk- ert, suggesting an original, likely prehistoric hunter ritual as constitutive of the later, historical layers, such as Greek myth and Roman political history, as she herself concludes in Chapter 12 ("Conclusion: Diana and Her Worshippers," pp. 280-296). For those of us with a different preference in theoretical empha- sis the ample inclusion of historical discussion still provides plentiful fodder for further thought and offers the possibility of less functionalist considera- tions of this sanctuary. And in opening up the evidence to such varied con- siderations, Green's monograph earns an important place on our shelves, respectfully offering a solid ground of evidence to compare with Frazer's Golden Bough.
