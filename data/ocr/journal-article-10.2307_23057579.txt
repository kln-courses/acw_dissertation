<plain_text><page sequence="1">Yousif Mahmud Ghulam. The Art of Arabia Calligraphy. Published by the author, 1982 (available from the author, P.O. Box 853, Lafayette, CA, 94549). 512 pages ca. $75.00 The author of this text lists the following as his aims (p. 10): 1. Introducing a new prospect into the field of Islamic studies that has been ignored for centuries. 2. Complementing the historical and archaeological studies of Islamic art by presenting a detailed analytical study of aesthetics of Islamic objects of art that were mentioned by historians in their works. 3. Shedding light on the creativeness of Muslim artists and their originality. 185</page><page sequence="2">4. Offering solutions for some problems in the field of Islamic art by reading the complicated calligraphic designs that scholars could not read before, and those considered until now to be pure decorations and simulations. 5. Simplification of these designs by showing the steps that the Muslim artist followed in producing his calligraphic designs. This would enable even the layman to understand and appreciate them without much effort. To achieve these aims the author presents a text of some fifty pages consisting of one essay repeated in Arabic, English, and French and some four hundred and sixty pages of illustrations. In his text the author distinguishes between two terms, "Calligraphy" and "the art of calligraphy." To him (p. 7), Calligraphy [means] the beautiful Arabic handwriting in which the calligrapher faithfully followed the rules set by the masters . . . [and] the art of calligraphy [which] means moving into another field quite different from that of the calligrapher. It means primarily running into the realm of art with all its essential features of imaginative expression . . . this distinction leads to a very important branch of Islamic art which has been hidden for centuries from the eyes of specialists and nonspecialists alike. His text treats the art of calligraphy. I am quoting extensively from the text of the author to make apparent the level of the discourse. While the fly-leaf of the book jacket states that Ghulam "has performed a miracle job by himself" and highlights "the involvement of a scholar in an untouched subject," the discourse, in my view, is not scholarly (despite the reference to Croswell [sic], Pope, and others), and the field of calligraphy in its many aspects has certainly been very much touched in many languages. Rather, the book seems focused on achieving aim #5, the simplifi cation of the decorative calligraphy. His illustrations almost invari ably give the chosen calligraphic example in simple handwritten form, then in a simplified elaborate version, then as fully elaborated on the artifact. This is a process (without the intermediate step) practiced by epigraphers and other scholars today. The text reveals the author's considerable ability to read difficult decorated inscriptions, and makes an attempt to show others how it was done, and therefore, how to do it themselves. It thus may be of value to a contemporary calligrapher. Its value to others is limited. It shows "how to" read an inscription with fully illustrated types of letter forms in very few instances, one being the anthropomorphic script on whose letter variants the author spends a considerable number of pages. But for the other scripts, the selection seems arbitrary. Architectural inscriptions are removed from context with only the scantiest documentation, making the calligraphic reading almost useless for someone who wants or needs to know where the inscription appears. Indeed, the rationale for the selection of the examples seems arbi trary. The book has some value for limited audiences in limited circum stances. Its cost, however, makes it extravagant. Irene A.
