<plain_text><page sequence="1">Alfred Neumeyer Die Kunst in unserer Zeit: Versuch einer Deutung, 175 pp., 37 ill. Stuttgart: Henry Goverts Verlag, 1961. 25 DM. The market is swamped with introductions to modern art, most of which platitudinize on slight variations of the same weary colorplates. Their pretentious format does not make up for lack of original research and reflective thought. Or, instead of the popularizations, the reader is offered unreadable esoteric eulogies (one essay on a fairly talented young artist in a re- cent issue of Art International concluded: "C . . . was visited by the gods"), or hostile pronouncements by individuals who, having set themselves up as keepers of public esthetic morality, squander their energies in rude at- tacks on contemporary art. In certain aspects Dr. Neumeyer's book is an answer to Hans Sedllmayer's Verlust der Mitte, perhaps the most noted recent book by an advocate of "san- ity in art." Professor Neumeyer approaches modern art with understanding and humility. He con- sistently asks the most relevant questions and frequently arrives at significant and convinc- ing answers. This reviewer feels that it is a lively and at times profound attempt at inter- preting twentieth century art. The book is divided into three parts, one each devoted to architecture, sculpture and painting. In the chapter on architecture, Neu- meyer comes to grips with essential aspects: for instance, the dynamic composition of space enclosure, characterized by lightness, open- ness, irregularity and dematerialization. The extrovert mobility of modern civilization has incorporated the road into its plan, much in the same manner that stairs belong to the tra- ditional house. The building today is no longer a solid expression of personal power, but has become open and transparent so as to welcome nature, light and air, as well as informal human contact. The articulation of space, so essential to modern architecture, also differentiates mod- ern sculpture from the sculpture of the past. The author also stresses the basic observation that the rejection of imitation was a necessary condition for the renaissance in contemporary sculpture. His discussion of the nature of ab- straction, of the sculptor's relationship to his material and his observations on fear, anxiety, and loneliness as important themes are all perspicacious. But his contribution, above all, is his analysis of the two major trends in modern sculpture: the tendency which stresses the active expression of the artist's vitality, and the more objective, geometric direction which has created new esthetic formulations for light, movement and infinity. In the chapter on painting which occupies half the book, Neumeyer traditionally sees the beginning of modernity in the liberation of the work of art from the representation of na- ture by Gauguin, Van Gogh, Seurat and Ce- zanne. The "it is" of five centuries of natural- ism is replaced by the "I am" of the modern artist. Neumeyer's insights lead him to see that the apparently geometric rationalism of the Cubists had, from its very beginnings, the seeds of free and non-rational fantasy, that Futurism did not merely glorify technology but is actually based on a need for inner dishar- mony, that the element of uncertainty is basic to modern art in general and abstract art in partic- ular, that the great danger for non-objective art is a lack or poverty of material, content, con- cept and idea, but that "freedom and human dignity are-and this may appear paradoxical -today retained solely in an art which rejects its dependence on verisimilitude." There seem to be occasional errors and mat- ters of misinterpretation: This reviewer dis- agrees with the author, who considers Rodin and Hildebrand the only significant sculptors of the nineteenth century. One wonders why Daumier, Degas and Rosso are disregarded. Or why is that extraordinary integration of all the arts in Art Nouveau overlooked when the author maintains that the Bauhaus brought about a fusion of the arts as it had not occurred since the Baroque? It must be pointed out also that cubist sculpture originates with Picasso's "Woman's Head" of 1909 and not with Archi- penko's concave sculptures of a few years la- ter, that it is erroneous to refer to Marc and Macke as Munich members of the Briicke, and that the term, Orphism, was coined by Apolli- naire and not Delaunay. Nevertheless, this is a brilliantly written es- say which, moreover, is fortunately not im- paired by that provincial type of chauvinism- either pro School of Paris, or pro School of New York-which seems to occur in almost all recently published chronicles of contempo- rary art. The author's perceptions are, in fact, often extremely keen and his formulations so succinct and memorable that it seems worth while to acquaint the reader with a few ex- amples: "Matisse's great effect is caused by the si- multaneous vision of elements which had here- tofore been separated: the special recession of objects becomes an adjacency of color planes." "Giacometti's sculptures deal with a world anxiety, the experience of being left in infinite nothingness. Here Pascal's diary entry is ap- plicable: 'the silence of infinite rooms seizes me with fear.'" "In Gorky one finds the freest and most au- tonomous use of forms which have an almost anthropomorphic vitality. The forms grow, sprout out, fly, yes, sometimes they seem to smile or to scream." On geometric abstraction: "The play with geometric forms has developed further (after the Bauhaus) but its eloquence has become ex- tinguished as its effect has been taken over by applied art and architecture. A further discussion of its current representatives would add nothing new." On Surrealism and Dali: "The theory of Surrealism points to its discoveries in the realm of the unconscious. ... But if one looks at the pictures of the Surrealists one finds noth- ing in their form of the multiple layers of the unconscious, so difficult to unravel, but quite to the contrary the super-definition of the dream which only a non-dreamer is able to represent. ... Surrealism is much less an art of the unconscious than the work of Klee and Kandinsky.. ... The lack of real commitment (on the part of Dali) has left only a vacuous sensationalism, and Dali's late religious paint- ings which today hang in the Metropolitan Museum in New York and the National Gal- lery in Washington will some day be in the stor- age bins next to Bouguereau and Alma Ta- dema." "In non-objective art rests the creative vital- ity of a time, and its vision will become the convention of a later period. Its esthetic lim- itlessness corresponds to the flowing, infinite world-concept of modern man." Altogether this is a splendid book, filled with insights into modern art and challenges about its interpretation. Except for the handsome but not very legible sans-serif type, it is beauti- fully designed by Roland Hinssel, who has cre- ated one of the finest jackets in years. The black and white illustrations are well selected and superbly printed. An American edition would be most desirable for the lover and student of modern art. PETER SELZ The Museum of Modern Art Bates Lowry The Visual Experience: An Introduction to Art, 272 pp., 235 ill. (16 in color). Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall; New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1961. $6.95. Professor Lowry's new book is that com- paratively rare wonder: a text both sensitively written and laid out. Its epochal nature may be indicated briefly by suggesting that it is anal- agous to the by now classic Brooks and War- ren Understanding Poetry. It is more per- fectly adapted-to one-semester use, in that the visual experience is covered in just sixteen chapters. "Covered" is of course not the adequate ad- jective, save for lazy students who bring to their degree nothing but the desire to get it. The Visual Experience will not long encourage this attitude. One delighted teacher has already well phrased Dr. Lowry's approach: he extends a hand to the reader, but once grasped, keeps him running faster and faster-consult, for instance, pp. 33-35, devoted to the Bellini (Car- paccio?) Flight into Egypt in our National Gallery. A glance at the treatment and analysis of this Flight should reveal the unique approach rightly stressed by the publishers, and by Dr. Lowry in his preface. Half of page 33 repro- duced the Flight in its entirety. More than half of the two succeeding pages are devoted to details of the static Virgin side-saddled, and the active Joseph leading. All but the most sluggish readers are led from a purely formal to a philosophical interpretation, ineluctably, but with no sense of the author's pushing or insisting. This is what I have termed above "sensitive writing"-courteous, undoctrinaire. Sensitive layout enables the student to run faster without stumbling, for the text and over two hundred black and white pictures are always visible at the same time. The prov- ing exception to the rule is the four groups of sixteen good color plates. One of these, the El Greco Espolio in the Cathedral of Toledo, may be cited as an outstandingly penetrating analysis of the effect on the beholder of the Cretan's knowledge of the expressive power of color. Great and explicitly Christian art, once really seen, makes its own way; what of post- Renaissance and "modern" art? How are ART JOURNAL XXII 1 62</page><page sequence="2">young people either side of twenty years (who are very moral indeed) to be persuaded of the "use" (they are pragmatical rogues, our youngsters) of such a work as Paul Klee's Old Man Figuring? Lowry's paragraph of appro- priately subtle indication of formal values concludes with a sentence on the meaning of the etching that tells us a whole volume about Youth and Old Age. Expressive content is re- vealed, translated, as well as may be, into language. But language is not visual art, and so we admire and learn from the way the Klee, with its light areas, is juxtaposed with the Ma- net Dead Toreador, with its dark blocks. In short, Lowry's Visual Experience is itself a work of art: suggestive, with the art to con- ceal its own art, but to reveal that of others. It is well, however, that Dr. Lowry writes so persuasively, for the reproductions do not al- ways do sufficient justice. For example, the steel trap line of Pollaiuolo's Hercules and the Hy- dra is rather muzzy in figure 11, though in general the art of the West reproduces better than that of the East. One criticism is purely a matter of personal opinion. In a volume that will be some stu- dents' only brush with art, can the author af- ford to reproduce inferior works? I think of some lumpy Roman sculpture, a "school of" Georges de la Tour (fig. 86). To be sure, a very few, such as a "Circle of Caravaggio," have their rightful place in the last chapter, "On Judging Quality." One hopes that the text will so far succeed that the publishers will be persuaded to add, in a seond edition, further reproductions, with short barbed questions that will impel the readers to do their own analysis, and form their own judgments, preferably on works whose titles and authors they may not know. Such was the great contribution of I. A. Rich- ards to the criticism and enjoyment of litera- ture. May it not be profitably applied to all the arts ? This reviewer will be surprised and cha- grined if The Visual Experience fails to be adopted in hundreds of liberal arts colleges in this country. It is a splendid work. Dr. Lowry has done for the visual arts what Messrs. Brooks and Warren have done for poetry. HANFORD HENDERSON The American University George B. Tatum Penn's Great Town: 250 Years of Philadelphia Architecture, 352 pp., 145 ill. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1961. $12.50. This is the Philadelphia story in architec- ture. It is a story of metropolitan sophistica- tion, documenting the architectural leadership of one of the New World's great cities; and it is played with a star-studded cast, including a host of significant performers in the history of American architecture. The story spans over 250 years, from the end of the seventeenth cen- tury until the present, representing the corre- sponding succession of stylistic phenomena (with noticeable emphasis on the nineteenth century). The styles are illustrated by a rich diversity of construction, including not only churches and public buildings but also many ex- amples of domestic and commercial architec- ture, and-with appropriate regard for urban form and technological advance-groups of buildings, parks, bridges, waterworks, and even a dry dock and a cemetery. It is a selec- tive, yet comprehensive, story of the physical development of a city and at the same time a history of American architecture in microcosm. The story begins with the ideal concept of William Penn's "Capitall Citty," realized in Thomas Holme's town-plan of 1862. Because the city was founded so late in the seventeenth century, its earliest buildings had little of that vestigial medievalism then common elsewhere in the colonies; rather its early architecture was what could be called early American Geor- gian, with some local traits giving it a provin- cial stamp. However, in the middle half of the eighteenth century, which the author terms "The Golden Age," the story unfolds in a bril- liant scene of political and cultural leadership, and we are reminded that Philadelphia was, on the eve of the Revolution, the second larg- est English-speaking city in the world and the metropolis of the American colonies. The city's mature Georgian architecture is explained in a number of nationally known examples, and credit for its refined craftsmanship (and some- times authorship) is assigned to the impor- tant role played by the Carpenters' Company. With the establishment of the federal govern- ment, which sat in the city for ten years (1790- 1800), the Philadelphian primacy was secured, and, persisting well into the nineteenth cen- tury, it can be seen architecturally from the classicism of the Early Republic forward through the romantic revivals to about 1860. The players in this act are the major perform- ers on the national scene: Pierre Charles L'En- fant, William Thornton, Benjamin Henry La- trobe, Robert Mills, William Strickland, John Haviland, Thomas U. Walter, John Notman, Samuel Sloan, Napoleon LeBrun. Witnessing this leading edge of development, one is im- pressed by the number of American architec- tural "firsts" which occurred in Philadelphia. In the less impressive period from the Civil War to ca.1890, which is described as "Vic- torian Eclecticism," we are treated to the in- ventive genius of Frank Furness and the monu- mentality of John McArthur, Jr. And in the "Creative Eclecticism" of the turn of the cen- tury (ca.1890-ca.1920) we see works by Hor- ace Trumbauer, Paul Philippe Cret, Daniel Burnham, and McKim, Mead and White. The modern period is dated from ca.1920 to the present, its first great architectural monument being the epoch-making skyscraper by George Howe and William Lescaze and its most recent examples by such contemporary figures as I. M. Pei and Louis I. Kahn. But the Philadelphia Story does not really end here, neither in scholarship nor in building practice: probably at no other place in the Republic is there today so much serious study and preservation of a city's architectural past and at the same time so much effort to create a viable, aesthetic urban form of the future. This book was sponsored by the Philadel- phia Art Alliance and the College of Fellows of the American Institute of Architects, initially appearing in April, 1961, when the national convention of the A.I.A. was held in Philadel- phia. Differing only slightly from the original, this is the second edition of the first compre- hensive history of Philadelphia's architecture, preparation of which earned for the author, who is an art historian, honorary membership in the professional architectural body. The book originated in the planning of a graphic exhibit of the city's historic architecture held at the Philadelphia Art Alliance during the convention. The illustrations come wholly from that exhibit, and since some important lost monuments were visually available only in prints or drawings, the graphic medium was adopted for all-"for visual continuity." As a result of the most diligent search, many hitherto unknown illustrations-engravings, architect's drawings, pencil sketches, recons- struction studies-have been included, and all are splendidly reproduced at large size and in sharp detail. The text is written as verbal ac- companiment, and it is written as a book ought to be: as a literary unit to be read continuously from beginning to end. It is a tribute to Dr. Ta- tum's skill and erudition that the story un- folds easily for the reader in that rare combi- nation of grace and clarity. One wishes only that the illustrations were more conveniently available, for they are confined to a separate section according to the uncompromising ne- cessity of modern book publishing. There is also a third section, which the serious reader will also want to consult simultaneously. En- titled "Notes to the Illustrations," it is a richly instructive and interesting catalogue raisonne of both the monuments and their il- lustrations. There is also an extensive bibliog- raphy and useful index. An outstanding work, this handsome volume has been appropriately designated Philadelphia's formal presenta- tion to visiting dignitaries. ERNEST ALLEN CONNALLY University of Illinois Montgomery Schuyler American Architecture and Other Writings, edited .by William H. Jordy and Ralph Coe, 2 vols., xviii + 644 pp., 167 ill. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1961. $12.50. In reference to the architectural criticism of Montgomery Schuyler, Lewis Mumford wrote that he was ". . . the most helpful critic of archi- tecture-I might even say the only one fully worthy of the name which America had yet produced." (Roots of Contemporary American Architecture, 1952, p. 24.) In the same intro- ductory essay Mumford went on to say that, "Some day, I trust, an age more conscious of the need for tradition, and an America more heedful of its living past, more respectful of its own best achievements, will bring together in a single volume a representative group of essays." (p. 24). Whether America has yet reached this stage may be open to question, but Mumford's wish has been most adequately fulfilled in this two volume edition of Schuyler's writings which have been assembled and edited by William H. Jordy of Brown University and Ralph Coe of the William Rockhill Nelson Gallery of Art at Kansas City. Here they have gathered together over thirty of Schuyler's architectural writings together with numerous half tones, line cuts and annotated footnotes which help ART JOURNAL XXII 1 64</page></plain_text>
