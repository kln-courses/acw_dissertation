<plain_text><page sequence="1">Chinese Landscape Painting. By Sher- man Lee. 169 pp. (142 figs.) Cleveland (The Cleveland Museum of Art), $4. The Cleveland Museum of Art showed in November-December 1954 a loan exhibi- tion of Chinese landscape paintings mostly from museums and collections in the U.S.A. The catalogue included in this book is of particular value because of the translation of many of the inscriptions and colophons on paintings as well as the iden- tification of some seals which show that some of the scrolls were formerly in the possession of famous collectors, e.g. that of the Emperor Ch'ien Lung, the Korean merchant An Ch'i, an excellent connoisseur of Chinese paintings, Liang Ch'ing-piao or Hsiang Tuan-pien, a sixteenth-century col- lector. The author uses this exhibition as the basis of a short history of the stylistic development of Chinese landscape paint- ing. However, it is to be regretted that the clarity of the illustrations does not match the precision of the author's description. Although landscape painting comes to the fore only in the Five Dynasty and Sung periods, the author tries to show that the non-anthropomorphic nature-philosophy on which it is based has its root in ancient Chinese conceptions, an attempt which raises more problems in regard to texts, interpretation, and terms than he perhaps realized. In regard to the root of landscape paintings in some representations in the art of the Chou and Han periods, it may be questioned whether the very stylized trees of Chou bronzes or Han tiles are meant to depict real trees. Moreover, there is no justification for believing that the 'con- tinuous wave mountain ranges' on Han tiles are imported from the Near East, because they can be traced back in Chinese art to the Chou and Shang periods. The more important part of the book deals with the later periods and the long scroll Fishing in a Mountain Stream (Cata- logue No.12, lent by the Nelson Gallery of Art and Atkins Museum, Kansas City) is an interesting example of an early type of landscape still reflecting in its composi- tion the ancient 'continuous wave moun- tain' pattern, no matter whether the attribution to Hsu Tao-ning (tenth century) is correct or not. The achievements of the great masters of the Yiuan period are well described and represented by typical examples in the exhibition, to mention only the hanging scrolls by Wang Meng (Catalogue No.30, Fishing in the Green Depth) and Ni Tsan (Catalogue No.31, River Pavilion and Mountain Scenery), both lent by the Bamboo Studio, New York, and an album leaf by Ts'ao Chi-po (Cata- logue No.32, A Pavilion near old Pines), lent by Walter Hochstadter, New York. Interest in the Ming and Ch'ing painters has been growing considerably during recent years and the detailed description of style and brush-work of pictures in this exhibition is very welcome. Tai Chin's long scroll Ten Thousand li of the Yangtze shows all his best qualities and is reminiscent of a similar one in this country exhibited last year in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cam- bridge (Mu-fei Collection). The work of Shen Chou is particularly well represented and the album leaf (Catalogue No.49), lent by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, is a very good example of the ideals of the Wu-school combining painting, calligraphy, and poetry in an accomplished manner. Interesting is also another album leaf (Catalogue No.51, lent by Richard B. Hobart, Cambridge, Mass.) illustrating his improvised manner of painting which, to a certain extent, resembles one by Van Gogh. Another member of the Wu-school, Wen Cheng-ming, is well represented and his long scroll Seven Junipers (Catalogue No.55, lent by the Honolulu Academy of Arts), with its twisted trees, is particularly signifi- cant, because the artist explains in an inscription the cosmic and literary mean- ing of the subject. Hsieh Shih-ch'en's hand- scroll (Catalogue No.67, lent by W. Hochstadter, New York) is similar to one formerly in the possession of the Berlin State Museum and shown in the Royal Academy Exhibition in London, 1935-6 (Catalogue No.2812). The author has well characterized the part played by Tung Chi-chang and his influence on later paintings. The individualists are always attractive to Western eyes trained on Impressionists and there are quite a num- ber of their paintings; especially well represented is Tao-chi. However, like Chinese connoisseurs, we may soon learn to appreciate the superb brush-stroke of the Four Wangs or other eclectics of the Ch'ing period. An unusual composition by Chin Nung (Catalogue No.i 1 2, album leaf, lent by the Honolulu Academy of Arts), provides a good example of his style of painting and square handwriting. A.
