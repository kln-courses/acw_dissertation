<plain_text><page sequence="1">XXVII, 20 BULLETIN OF THE MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS Andhra Sculptures' THE Museum already possessed an important series of reliefs and one Buddha head in the round from Amaravati.2 Four pieces (five reliefs) of the same school have recently been acquired, three (four reliefs) by gift from Dr. Denman W. Ross, one by purchase from the Maria Antoinette Evans Fund, making a most important addition to the representation of Andhra Buddhist sculpture in Room A 3. All are " casing slabs," that is, parts of the stone mantling (kaficuka silamaya) of a Buddhist stupa ;3 but one has been previously used as part of a solid enclosing wall (pakaira) of a Buddhist monument, probably likewise a stupa. The pieces all come from Vefigi, that is to say, the Kistna-Godaveri delta, the original home of the Andhras; all the later work is dateable as usual, about A. D. 200, the earlier relief perhaps in the first century A. D. The largest, nearly complete slab, the gift of Dr. Ross, illustrated on the cover, belongs to the well-known type of casing slab bearing a represen- tation of a complete stupa, such as that of which the slab itself formed a part. Unfortunately, the relief is much weathered; but it can be clearly recognized that a structure such as this must have been a noble monument, and further, that in the relief itself, the human figure is treated in a most accomplished manner, and with a profound under- standing of pose and movement. Late Andhra sculpture may well be said to represent the zenith of Indian art; it corresponds exactly to the early kavlya style in literature, and stands midway between the monumental austerity of the earlier primitives and the more florid, though still magnifi- cent art of the Guptas. The composition is framed below by a narrow frieze of running animals. Above this is the stupa, the base of which is hidden to right and left by the railing (vedika), occupying a third of the total height of the sculptured surface. The railing, as usual, consists of a plinth, uprights, cross-bars, and coping (the Museum already possesses numerous examples of parts of such railings from Amaravati and Mathura). It is to be understood, of course, that the railing is square in plan and surrounds the circular stupa within, so as to leave a considerable circumambulation space (pradakina pada) between the railing and the stupa. Access to this space is by means of gateways opening in the middle of each of the four sides of the railing, one such gate- way being visible in front view and two in profile. The railing itself turns outwards at the gateway to form a short entrance passage, and terminates in two pillars, supporting a pair of facing lions above, while another pair of lions are affronted on the coping at the inner end of the entrance. On the ground at the entrance are two "brimming vessels" (punna ghata) auspicious emblems of abundance and welfare. The personages right and left, hold- ing a banner and an umbrella, and their attendant dwarfs with "full trays" (purna patta), are probably Yaksas. A scene with forceful action is represented on the rail coping, but can hardly be identified. In the circumambulation space within the railing are two columns (celiya khambha), of which the upper parts and capitals are visible above the railing. A box-like structure projects from the main body of the stupa, forming a canopy above a sort of reredos, with a representation of the Buddha and worshippers below it and immediately within and facing the entrance. From the top of this canopy rise five columns (ayaka stambha), not quite in contact with the dome of the stupa, as may be seen in the profile view at each side; its front face bears a representation, possibly of the temptation by the daughters of Mara. The stupa proper consists of a high basement, level with the top of the projecting canopy last referred to, and visible above the rail-coping; the top of this basement forms a ledge, within which rises the dome (anda, gabba) of the stupa. Both basement and dome are covered with a mantling of carved stone. The most important panels, similar to those here described, are those immedi- ately above the basement ledge, and level with the eayaka stambhas. These usually illustrate a con- secutive series of events, but in our relief the subject cannot be made out. Immediately above these slabs is a narrow frieze of running animals, then three other narrow bands of ornament, and above these a broad zone of garland ornament and carved medallions. On the summit of the dome is a small, square, railed structure (harmike), from the centre of which rises a short square pillar surmounted by a four-fold representation of a crest like that of a Kusana turban, and this is flanked by two umbrellas. Rising in the air around the top of the dome and moving towards the harmika from each side are numerous angels or minor divinities (Gandhabbas, Yakkhas, etc.) with hands raised in worship, or bearing garlands, or playing on musical instruments, or dancing. These illustrate very well the great ability with which the sculptors of the Amaravati school were able to depict crowded moving groups. Turning now to the back of the same slab we find another relief, in a very different and distinctly inferior manner, placed upside down with reference to the relief already described. It is thus quite clear (if any proof had been needed) that it was never intended that both sides of the slab should be seen at once. The fact is, that before being carved and used as a casing slab, the stone had served as a part of a pakara or enclosing wall set tAndhra dynasty of Vengi and the Dekkhan, ca. 230 B. C. to A. D. 225. 2See Catalogue of the Indian Collections, Part 11, Sculpture, pp. 51-57. 3A "stupa" or "tope"- is a shrine (caitya) consisting of a relic mound, otherwise known as dhatu-garbha, dagaba: as a symbol, it represents the Buddha's Parinirvana, Final Release. Stupas are gener- ally erected by a king or wealthy patron, as an act of piety and with a view to the acquisition of " merit." Extant examples range in date from the third century B. C. to the present day.</page><page sequence="2">BULLETIN OF THE MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS XXVII, 21 l,tJ The Bath in the Nairafljan-a Ross Collection up round a Buddhist shrine, probably an earlier stupa or possibly some kind of chapel. The frag- mentary pilaster preserved on the left side of the relief is of the same type as those which occur on the similar old enclosing wall slabs found at Amaravati and Jaggayyapeta. As to the date of the work it can only be said that it is certainly older than that of the front relief already described, that the use as part of a solid enclosing wall relates it to other fragments mostly dating from the second century B. C.,1 and that the form of the pilaster corresponds with that of the pilasters found on these fragments: on the other hand, the style and quality are by no means the same as that of the oldest fragments, and the form of the Naga's turban can hardly be pre-Kusana, and, as far as can be judged by comparison with a crude drawing of another treatment of the same subject published by Burgess,2 'See Burgess, Buddhist stupas of Amaravati and Jaggayyapeta, Pls.

Although the Museum relief is not of the highest artistic quality, its subject-matter and artistic pro- cedure are still of great interest. The event repre- sented is the Bodhisattva's bath in the Naira-njana River, immediately before the Great Enlightenment. Two-thirds of the lower part of the foreground on the right is occupied by a representation of the river, the water being represented by waved lines and swimming water creatures (a fish, makara, tortoise, and crocodile). Two footprints on the left represent the Bodhisattva, now standing on the banks.' A man whom I do not identify, and whose hands are concealed by an object of obscure significance, is bowing toward the Bodhisattva. Thigh deep in the water stand the Naga KMla or Kalika and his two wives, their hands joined and raised in worship; their semi-human, semi-serpentine nature is indicated by the five cobra hoods that rise above the heads of his Nagini wives. The great Naga, whose home is beneath the waters, has been, in fact, aroused (at least according to the Nidanakalha version of the story) by the sound made by the Bodhisattva's golden bowl, which the latter had cast into the river before taking his bath; and now, rising to the surface, he worships the Great Being and foretells his coming Enlightenment. Above the N5ga and his wives, and moving through the air, are four river goddesses (nadi devata) bearing on their heads full vessels in honor of the Bodhisattva. The second carved slab, purchased from the Maria Antoinette Evans Fund, is a casing slab of approximately A. D. 200, worked on one side only. Two compositions are represented, framed and separated by bands of lotus ornament; the horizontal lotus spray springing from the open jaws of a makara exemplifies the great group of early Indian decorative motifs illustrating the water cosmology (origin of life in the waters), a theme quite unconnected with Buddhism. The upper relief illustrates the Great Enlightenment; more specifically, it combines in one representation the assault of Mara and the Tempta- tion by the Daughters of Mira. The Buddha is represented by a throne, cushions, and footstool with foot symbols (pdduka), beneath the Bodhi- tree. On the left is represented the assault of Mara (who is none other than Kamadeva, the Indian god of love, and thus the Bodhisattva's natural enemy); Mara himself is riding on his elephant Girimegha, 'Mountain Cloud,' while his followers are casting heavy rocks at the Bodhisattva, with intent to crush him. On the right the same persons, now defeated, are retiring and as they leave raise their hands in Indra(?) Worshipping Ross Collection worship of the Great Being whom they could not injure. Meanwhile, the daughters of Mara, usually three in number, here four, have been sent by their father in a last endeavor to shake the Bodhisattva's concentration; they, too, are destined to failure, and will at last worship the Great Being, wishing him success. Below, a less complete composition represents the elevation of the Crest-relic' (cuaea), consisting of the Bodhisattva's turban and hair, which he cut off with his sword when he first adopted the ascetic life. Cast into the air, this relic was received by the gods and enshrined as an object of worship in the Trayashimsa heaven. The second figure on the extreme right with a cylindrical headdress may be Indra. The two other fragments acquired at the same time are not sufficiently complete to permit of identification of the subjects. ANANDA COOMARASWAMY.
