As we anticipated this time last year, the new website went live on 1st December 2009, and was formally presented by the British School and the Ecole frangaise d' Athene's on 17th December in the presence of the British and French Ambassadors, and the Secretary General of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, Dr Lina Mendoni. I join the Director of the Ecole frangaise in expressing our sincere thanks to Dr Mendoni and her colleagues throughout the Greek Archaeological Service for their support. We share their desire to promote a fuller understanding of the work of the Ministry in rescue archaeology, site conser- vation and management. Not for the first time, the reports presented in AG underline the importance of rescue excavation in providing vital evidence for basic research questions, from urban development to city constitutions (this year's account of Argos includes a full description of the excavation at 48 Korinthou Street which produced the extraordinary collection of fourth- century inscribed bronze tablets noted in previous editions of AG). AGOnline is now a well-established research tool valued by scholars worldwide. Its capacity to host and link large quantities of data and extensive illustrations came into its own this year as we sought to synthesize the unusually large volume and range of information recently published. At the heart of this year's AG are the two volumes of ADelt 55 which contain reports of work conducted up to 2000. ADelt 56, extending to ca. 2005, is in press, but the future of the Archaiologikon Deltion thereafter, as a print or electronic publication, is currently a matter of discussion. Whatever the outcome, AGOnline will allow us to present new data as soon as it is published, and the RSS facility on the site provides researchers with the latest updates, selected as they wish by region or period. Also included are reports from AAA 40-41 (2007- 2008); a commemorative volume marking the 20th anniversary of the AEMTh ; volumes 1 and 2 of the AEThSE ; Kepiuaria 0iAia$: Festschrift for loannis Touratsoglou (Athens 2009); and ApxaioAoyiKO Epyo Kprirrfs I (the 2010 publication of the first pan-Cretan conference held in Rethymnon in 2008, an advance copy of which was generously provided by our colleagues in Rethymnon). Otherwise, our most up-to-date information comes from Ministry of Culture and Tourism press releases, reports of the activities of the foreign Schools and Greek universities in 2009 and the Ergon of the Archaeological Society of Athens. We thank the Secretary General of the Society, Dr Vasileios Petrakos, for supplying many of the images used in AG, and offer our warm congratulations upon his election as General Secretary of the Academy of Athens. As ever, we endeavour to credit the excavators of each site and to supply details of their institutional affiliation. This year, the task is complicated by the long period of research covered, from 1999 to 2010, during which many colleagues in the Archaeological Service in particular have moved positions. We apologize to all concerned for any errors that may remain in the text. Overall, this is one of the largest editions of AG in recent years: indeed, space constraints have prevented us from taking full notice of certain publications, notably the 2nd EPCA's Ta Meooyeia orov ApyooapcoviKo: to epyo iiias SeKaerias, 1994-2003, the Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Boeotian Studies (2008) and the Proceedings of the 8th Symposium on Trikalina Studies (2009). This material will appear quickly in AGOnline and be noted in print in next year's AG. There are plenty of highlights in this rich collection of material. The recovery of two sixth-century kouroi from Klenia in the Corinthia was a significant success in the battle against the trade in illegal antiquities, and the ensuing excavation revealed an important part of the main cemetery of ancient Tenea. In southern Laconia, Linear B tablets plus fresco fragments confirm the existence of a higher-order Mycenaean centre at Ag. Vasileios; we look forward to reporting the results of the first season of systematic excavation next year. And a major shrine deposit at Bouri, on the relatively unexplored north coast of the Megarid, attracts comparison with Perachora to the west. An important feature of ADelt 55 is the picture of the long-term development of several major urban centres provided by the presentation of large quantities of data with clear maps and systematic linking with the results of previous research. Some single plots are of importance in their own right: the complex history of settlement, from Middle Helladic to Late Roman, on the site of the new Acropolis Museum in Makriyianni is a case in point. Elsewhere, extensive bodies of evidence for particular periods or activities add to our knowledge of well- documented centres - the urban residences of Roman Sparta, with their rich mosaics, for example, or the extensive cemeteries discovered in the course of railway construction near Thebes. At Mytilini, the sections of water-front and quays revealed in pipe-trenches provide rare evidence for the long-term development of trading facilities and the nature and direction of trade from the Hellenistic period to the 20th century. Growing bodies of evidence should also be noted from the towns of western Greece, including the Classical-Hellenistic houses of Arta, the cemeteries of Sami and Fiskardo on Kephallonia and the large cemeteries emerging in Corfu town.</page><page sequence="2">2 CATHERINE MORGAN Large public projects continue to determine the course of archaeology in many regions. The mostly Neolithic and Byzantine settlement remains discovered during the Lake Karla drainage programme are one such case, and across Greece, the extensive programme of motorway construction and redevelopment is likely to exert a major influence for some years to come. Mycenaean remains recently discovered in the area of Derveni during the widening of the Corinth-Patras motorway have attracted considerable press attention, for example, and we hope to report more fully next year on the extensive excavations conducted during the construction of the E65 between Lamia and Karditsa. A number of major conservation and restoration programmes have drawn to a close over the past year. The completion of work on the Propylaea is a landmark in the Acropolis restoration programme, and we report fully on the programme at Nikopolis which earned a Europa Nostra prize in 2009 (Europa Nostra awards in 2010 recognized the conservation of the tower of Ag. Triada on Amorgos and the Athens observatory). Work elsewhere has included the creation of archaeological parks around the Mycenaean acropolis of Ag. Andreas on Siphnos, and the aqueduct, quarry and shrines at Melanies on Naxos, presentation of the site of ancient Pelinna, conservation of the fortifications at Aigosthena and, at Vasiliko on Euboia, restoration of the Medieval tower which now houses an information centre on Early Christian and Latin Euboia. Attention is now turning to ancient theatres, with a major programme involving some 25 sites across Greece, from Melos to Dodona, the Theatre of Dionysos in Athens and Thasos, supported by an innovative combination of EU, local government and private funding. The development of the museum network across Greece continues apace, with new or refurbished archaeo- logical museums opened at Chaironeia, Igoumenitsa, Kalamata, Kalymnos, Karditsa, Nikopolis, Nisyros, Pella, Philippoi, Pythagoreio on Samos, Thasos and Thessaloniki (the Museum of the Ancient Agora). In Athens, the new permanent displays of the Byzantine and Christian Museum, which opened in stages through the year, are a tribute to the scholarship and vision of Dimitris Constantios, Director since 1999, who transformed the outlook of the Museum until his untimely death in February 2010. Certain exhibitions and conferences held in Greece over the past year may be of interest to readers of AR.

Ioannidou (Director, Acropolis Restoration Service) reports (The Acropolis Restoration News 9 [July 2009], 9-13) on restoration work on the Acropolis during the second half of 2008 and the first half of 2009. Anastylosis of the northern side of the Parthenon continued: the resetting of architrave blocks was completed in the centre and the reassembly of the Doric frieze continues. Propylaia: restoration of the ceiling of the west hall was completed with the resetting of ceiling coffers and interbeam blocks. Anastylosis of the entablature of the East Portico was also completed. Temple of Athena Nike: the eight dismantled columns were reset along with the two antae. Structural restoration of all members of the horizontal cornice has been completed and work continues on the overlying courses. Fourteen blocks of the frieze have been cast to replace the originals on the monument. E. Karakitsou reports (The Acropolis Restoration News 9 [July 2009], 23-25) on a study of the large variety of game boards incised onto the Parthenon: 50 games were recorded, mainly on the more sheltered western and southern sides. Ancient Agora. J. M. Camp (ASCSA) reports on the 2009 excavation season. In section T, investigation of three Classical commercial or non-monumental public buildings south of the Tholos, first excavated in the 1950s, continued. Two long deep pits cut into bedrock beneath one of the floors contained debris including fourth-century BC amphora sherds. A tile-lined well in the courtyard of the complex was filled with debris reflecting domestic or commercial use (numerous pyramidal loomweights, squat lekythoi, pyxides and cooking wares). The pottery, including numerous late red-figure sherds, dates to the first half of the fourth century BC, a date confirmed by fragments of a Panathenaic amphora preserving part of the name of Dieitrephes, archon in 384/383 BC (Fig. 1). This well is among the earliest tile- lined structures, representing a technology which became common from the third century BC onwards. It was evidently abandoned during construction since it reached a depth of only 3m (the average for a well of this period being 12-15m). A single dikast's token (stamped with the letter B on both sides) indicates civic activity in the area. 1. Athens, Agora: fragments of a Panathenaic amphora. The large section B0, overlying the building identified as the Stoa Poikile, was excavated at its east and west ends. At the west the foundations of early modern buildings lay on the orientation of the 19th-century streets. The disarticulated remains of several horses were found, as well as a large shallow lime-slaking pit. These burials date to the 16th century, when this area was just outside the urban limits, and were cut into fill of the same date. Typical among the sherds collected were slip-painted wares (open bowls decorated with yellow or white concentric circles on a brown background) and green monochrome sgraffito. In the absence of architecture, it seems that the area may have been used as a dumping ground at the edge of the inhabited area. Lower layers produced a variety of Middle Byzantine pottery (green- painted and brown-painted wares, sgraffito, etc.) similar in date to the 12th- to 13th-century houses found immediately to the west (see Hesperia 66 [1997], 521-46). The associated architecture, mostly rubble walls, is visible in the scarps. In the eastern area, walls of modest Byzantine houses (made of assorted blocks, stones and tiles set in clay) follow the northeast-southwest orientation estab- lished by the course of the Eridanos river. Various instal- lations were found: a clay-lined rectangular pit or hearth, the lower part of a large pithos and the mouth of a large sunken pithos with its cover slab still in place. Pottery suggests a 10th-century date for most of the walls. This area overlies the front of the Stoa Poikile, thus explaining the high incidence of good, worked blocks of limestone and marble re-used in the later walls. In section BH, most of the Middle Byzantine walls which overlie the eastern end of the Stoa Poikile were removed, exposing more of the back wall and two interior columns of the stoa. Material recovered supports a 10th- century date for most of the walls. The Late Roman rubble partition walls within the stoa were also cleared. The building was first divided longitudinally, with walls running between the interior Ionic columns; somewhat later, cross-walls running from the interior to the exterior columns were added, dividing the interior space into smaller units. A concentration of bronze coins in the Late Roman levels suggests that the new rooms were used as shops. Associated pottery dates these modifications to the fifth and sixth centuries: the building went out of use at the end of the sixth century, after which it was extensively quarried for building material. Assorted spolia recovered from the Middle Byzantine walls include a fragmentary inscription, probably of the fourth or third century BC, preserving only parts of three lines of text. This comes from near the top of the stone, which carries a cyma reversa moulding. A partly-preserved cutting on top suggests that the stone carried an added relief or Herm. More of the original masonry of the back wall of the stoa was exposed, confirming the fine and careful construction which has long been observed at the western end of the building. Newly exposed this year is a run of the exterior of the euthynteria supporting the orthostates. Two terra- cotta pipelines (Fig. 2), previously located behind the western end of the stoa, were seen to continue parallel to its back wall, starting at about the level of the top of the euthynteria. The smaller, upper pipe dates to the fourth century BC. The larger, lower one is contemporary with the stoa, dating to the second quarter of the fifth century BC; it has been traced some 100m to the west in rescue excavations by the Archaeological Service and in the</page><page sequence="4">4 ROBERT K. PITT 2. Athens, Agora: two terracotta pipelines behind the back wall of the Painted Stoa. Kerameikos, where it passes out through the Dipylon Gate. It is tempting to associate this conduit with the passage in Plutarch ( Life of Kimon 13.8) where Kimon is credited with 'converting the Academy from a waterless and arid spot into a well- watered grove, which he provided with clear running tracks and shady walks'. In section BZ the plan of the Classical commercial building was clarified with the identification of a row of at least six adjacent rooms, all opening directly on to the street to the west. Work concentrated on the two north- ernmost rooms. Clearance of a collapsed 'cistern', associated with a third-century BC shaft to the east, revealed an intact Mycenaean alabastron (14th- to 13th- century BC), implying that the collapsed feature may be the bedrock roof of a Mycenaean chamber tomb rather than a Hellenistic cistern (noting the previous discovery of two similar tombs to the south and east of the ancient road: K2: 5 and J-K2: 2 = Hesperia 72 [2003], 248 and 254- 73). Two further pyres bring the total for this building to 12, the largest concentration found within a single building in the Agora. The deposits again consist of several small cooking pots, a drinking cup, a lamp and small saucers and/or plates of the second half of the fourth century BC. From a level of Late Roman fill at the north came the strut or support for a marble statue, carved in the form of a palm tree. An immediate parallel is the small statue of Hermes (SI 054) found in a well on the northern slope of the Areopagos {Hesperia 8 [1939], 236-38). A large collection of organic material recovered from water sieving over the past 35 years was processed and archived. Plaka. V. Vasilopoulou (1st EPCA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 47-49) on a series of rescue excavations. Continued clearance of walls at 9 Tholou Street and Klepsydras (see AR 51 [2004-2005], 3) revealed fragments of funerary kioniskoi (two preserving inscrip- tions), many architectural members, including a Middle Byzantine capital, part of a relief preserving the left foot and hand of a woman holding a vessel and a sarcophagus fragment with garland and bucranium decoration. Further removal of walls at 16 Panos Street (AR 49 [2002-2003], 4) exposed part of an inscribed kioniskos and an inscribed base. Ottoman house walls and a sewer were found in the yard of a property at 19 Tholou Street, and architectural fragments were removed during clearance at 2 Taxiarchon Street and Dexippou. Excavations at 6 Poikilis Street revealed inscribed fragments of a stele and plinth, while at 2 Erechtheos Street and 24 Diogenous Street, three walls were revealed in the northeast of the plot. Finds included a number of inscriptions (one reported as EYKAEH) and sculptural fragments of a robed arm, a male head, the right thigh of a male statue and a section of drapery. At 7 Mitroou Street, a column of grey marble, possibly funerary, was recovered. Makrigianni. S. Eleftheratou and N. Saraga (1st EPCA) report on continuing excavations on the site of the New Acropolis Museum (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 49-56; see previously AR 52 [2005-2006], 8). In sector 1 (Fig. 3), house A (second- to sixth-century AD), comprising a series of rooms around a colonnaded courtyard paved in white marble and with a monolithic marble puteal on its west side, is accessed via a narrow corridor (1) from road I. In the north wing was a suite of rooms (2-7); the central room (2), with a small hall to the south (3), was probably an andron. On the eastern side were five rooms (8-12) and on the south a further three (13-15). The small room in the southeast (12), with a tiled floor and drains, probably housed a washroom. The house continued in this configuration until the end of the third century AD, was later repaired with minor modifications and continued in use until the construction of house B in the sixth century AD. Beneath the later room 9, deposits of chipped stone indicated a marble workshop of the second to first century BC, and, further below, walls of the late fifth century BC. The deepest levels of the room revealed Geometric and Middle Helladic pottery, and an unaccompanied child grave. In the northern part of sector 2, road IV (3m wide, oriented east-west and intersected at its west end by road II), remained in use from the third century BC until the fourth century AD. In the eastern part of the sector, clari- fication of the limits of house T showed that the second series of rooms to the east belonged to a separate house (Zt) of the same period. House is poorly preserved due to the later Byzantine structure E. It is on a higher level than house T, and built around a colonnaded courtyard (5m x 5.8m) with a clay tiled floor. In its southeast corner was a well which remained in use until the Middle Byzantine period. Access to the house was from the south, via a corridor (2), and led out to road I. In the north of the house, a series of small rooms (5-7) clustered around a large central triclinium (4). Exploratory excavation beneath the floors revealed that the basic layout of the property was established by the Roman, if not the Hellenistic, period. Sector 3 is defined to the south by road IV. Investigation continued of the Roman west bath complex, comprising a frigidarium (1), caldarium (2) and tepidarium (3). The floor of the hypocaust was paved with small stones, clay tiles and marble chips. Area 4 appears to be an open yard with a well. Following a period of abandonment the bath complex was repaired and reconfigured in the fourth to fifth century AD. At this point it probably became a house, with superimposed clay floors and frescoed walls with red bands and imitation marble revetment. A large room to the east (6), paved with marble mosaic, appears to have been destroyed at the end of the fifth century AD, as confirmed by the thick</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 5 3. Athens, Makrigianni: Acropolis Museum plot.</page><page sequence="6">6 ROBERT K. PITT deposits within which founded the walls of the next building phase. In the sixth to seventh century the west part of the house, up to road II, was covered by soil and the area remained largely undeveloped. A section of a circular or apsidal hall was revealed in contact with the north retaining wall of building E, to the north of which were a small ante-room and a larger room with a floor of marble tiles. In test trenches underneath the floors of these areas, the oldest construction phase (a polygonal wall of large cut limestone blocks) most probably dates to the fifth century BC. In sector 4 work focused on the Roman room with paved floor found at the southwestern end of the excavation area (and continuing beyond it). This basement (or semi-basement) is divided into two parts with a height difference of 0.4m. The lower, eastern part has a floor of stone and marble tiles, clay bricks in secondary use and small pebbles. Two shallow circular pits are surrounded by broad grooves in the tiled surfaces, presumably made by millstones during the processing of cereals. In the eastern part of the room is a similar but smaller circular pit with grooves around it. To the south in the same room were the remains of a rectangular brick construction and a small paved area, of uncertain function. In the higher level to the north, the foundations of rooms group around a large open courtyard with a well. The destruction layer covering this entire basement space was filled with broken bricks from walls, roof tiles and other materials, and is dated by ceramics and coins to the third century AD. Near the north wall of the basement was a water-proofed cistern (VI) in use from the Late Classical/Early Hellenistic period. To its northwest was an open courtyard with a floor of fine pebbles and a well cut into the natural rock. Both well and courtyard went out of use in the Late Hellenistic/Early Roman period. Beneath the floor was another, smaller floor of the same form and construction. To the south of cistern VI was a disturbed pit grave with amphorae showing signs of burning and other offerings dated to the end of the Protogeometric period. Many structures in sector 5 continue underneath the Weiler Building to the north and towards the Acropolis Metro station to the east. The northwestern edge of the area was occupied by the small Central Bath, composed of six rooms including a frigidarium (1), tepidarium (2), unctorium (3) and caldarium (4). The bath operated from the end of the fifth century AD and was later rebuilt. It reached its final form by the seventh century, while in the area of building Z to the east, an intermediate sixth- century phase was detected. In its final form the complex was extended to the south with the addition of two rooms (5 and 6). The older frigidarium retained the same form, with three small individual pools being built into the east wall. The old unctorium joined with the frigidarium : a further bath lay to the north of it. The tepidarium and caldarium of the first period must both have been used in this phase as tepidaria. Of the two new rooms, the north- ernmost (5) was a sudatorium , while room 6 to the south was a caldarium. Around the same time or a little earlier (during the sixth century AD) the level of building Z was raised significantly. Many of the previous rooms were consolidated, while others were divided. To the east, areas investigated included continuations of rooms found during the Metro excavations, meeting the ancient road towards the Sanctuary of Dionysos. Two new areas investigated in 2000, to the southeast of sector 1 and the northwest of sector 4, were previously occupied by construction sites or workrooms for the Metro and the 1st EPCA. In the first area, south of road I, few ancient architectural remains were preserved, probably due to the extensive clearance and deep modern construction in the area from the time of its use by the Makrigianni Police Academy onwards. Among the surviving antiq- uities were: the west continuation for ca. 17.5m of a drain for road I (this being the only evidence of a road in this area); fragments of fifth-century BC pipelines, a long section of which was found to the north in the Metro excavations; two underground cisterns with Late Hellenistic pottery; nine wells of various dates from the second half of the sixth century BC to the Byzantine era; and parts of a Middle Byzantine structure with two building phases to the south of the area. The area was evidently residential in nature. At the northeastern edge of sector 5, lay the southern section of the Eastern Baths (found during the Metro excavations). Built during the fourth and fifth centuries AD, this included an apodyterion (1), frigidarium (2), tepidarium (3) and caldarium (4). The destruction layer is dated to the seventh century AD. The second new excavation, to the northwest of sector 4, borders an area where a large trial trench was dug in 1980 by the 3rd EPCA. A house to the east of those excavations showed three building phases from the Classical to the Early Christian period. The north wall of the earliest phase was constructed of large cut limestone blocks in the polygonal style of the Classical to Hellenistic period; a cistern (III) associated with the house contained first-century BC to first-century AD pottery. Central Athens (3rd EPCA: 1st EBA) Plaka. Th. Iliopoulos (3rd EPCA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 72-73) on the discovery during drainage work on Daidalou Street of a Byzantine or Ottoman brick cistern lined with hydraulic mortar. Further east were two parallel northwest-southeast walls, one apparently related to Late Roman buildings previously discovered ( ADelt 27 [1972] Chr, 71; ADelt 37 [1982] Chr , 19). Theseio. At 24 Akamantos Street, Ta Nea , Kathimerini and Eleftherotypia (16/04/10) report the discovery by the 3rd EPCA of a section of the tricilinium of a second- century AD villa. This contained a floor mosaic depicting in its centre the abduction of Ganymede by Zeus, trans- formed into an eagle. Frescoes decorated the walls of the room, one course imitating marble with floral designs above. Kerameikos. J. Stroszeck (DAI) reports on further excavation in the Tomb of the Lakedaimonians (403 BC). Investigation focused on the southern extension of the grave complex. Here an earlier mud-brick building was levelled for the construction of the stone tomb. Prior to the expansion of the tomb for the burial of warriors 10-13, there had been an open trench (0.9-1. 2m wide) along the southeast wall of the structure. This trench was filled in the summer of 403 BC and the area levelled to create the graves of warriors 10-13. The filling layer contained a large amount of stones, coarseware and flneware sherds,</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 7 and tile. The body of warrior 14 was buried in the same manner as his comrades, but at a significantly higher elevation in a narrow section of the stone grave. The most likely explanation is that he died later than warriors 10-13 at a time when the stone tomb was under construction, and he therefore occupied a single grave within the same construction. Omonoia area. G. Kavvadias (3rd EPCA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 73-76) on a rescue excavation at 11 Virginias Benaki Street which revealed part of a large wall, most likely from a funerary peribolos, traces of a fourth-century BC road and part of a building of the second to fourth century AD, probably related to previ- ously discovered remains to the northeast at no. 13 ( ADelt 23 [1968] Chr , 43-48) (Fig. 4). The peribolos wall (1.4m wide) preserved two courses of reddish and yellowish tufa blocks. To the south and in contact with it was a road, probably connected with the route to the Academy, contemporary with the Roman 4. Athens, Omonoia, 11 Virginias Benaki Street: fourth- century BC road and associated tombs. building 3.5m to the east. The peribolos foundations contained an inscribed funerary stele of Polykles, an unknown proxenos from Chalkidean Akanthos. The letter forms suggest a date in the second half of the fifth century BC; the cession of Akanthos from the Delian League in 424 is a probable terminus ante quem. From the walls of the Roman building came five funerary kioniskoi of Hymettian marble dating from the first century BC to the first century AD: (1) MEVoScbpa Op[u]y(a (complete, 0.54m high, 0.165m in diameter); (2) incomplete with an illegible inscription (preserved 0.225m high, 0.165m in diameter); (3) Bcckxis Aiovuoi'ou Z|iupva(a 'Aya0[a](ou T7oTan&lt;0ou yuvr| (complete, 1.05m high, 0.29m in diameter); (4) upper section of a kioniskos inscribed Eur||iEpis [EuJrjUEpou 'AvTioxiooa (preserved 0.46m high, 0.185m in diameter); (5) complete (0.56m high, 0.13m in diameter) with a depiction of a loutrophoros below: Zco(3(a xpTloTr). 95 Ermou Street (K.

Mets area and south of Acropolis 3-5 Gorgiou Street (N. Despotidi property). Th.

A brick water-channel at no. 10a (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 78) is probably connected with these structures. 8 Automedontos Street (I. Dalexiou property). T. Kokkoliou (3rd EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 78) a Late Roman trapezoidal cistern founded in bedrock, with walls of small rough stones. 8 Koryzi Street (A. Mamali property). T. Kokkoliou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 78-80) the finding of a section of the late fourth-century BC proteichisma (Fig. 5) in an area where previous excavations had revealed further sections to the south at Koryzi 10 and to the north at Koryzi 6, with a Justinianic tower (ADelt 18 [1963] Chr , 39; 23 [1968] Chr , 38). The wall here (20.4m long, 1.54m wide, maximum height 3.8m) is founded upon chalk at a depth of 3.27m, is oriented southwest-northeast and preserves seven isodomic courses of large conglomerate blocks (1.2m x 0.5m). A fortification ditch along its east face contains fourth-century BC pottery. Parallel to the wall and within the ditch ran a water-channel of the second to third century AD built of unworked stone and hydraulic mortar (10.4m long, 1.85m wide, 0.7m high), sections of which have been found in more recent excavations at 8 Iosiph ton Rogon Street and 4-6 Neri Street (ADelt, forthcoming). A section of a Roman road to the northwest was also uncovered. Petmeza and Phalirou Streets. E. Lynkouri-Tolia (3rd EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 81-83) on excavations undertaken in 1996-1998 of a 515m2 plot at the junction of Petmeza and Phalirou Streets (Fig. 6) as part of the Metro works. An ancient cemetery with funerary periboloi and graves dating from Archaic to Roman (excepting Hellenistic) included red-figure fragments of the greatest painters of the early fifth century BC. In the north, a peribolos tomb of conglomerate blocks, 19.5m long and oriented east- west, was preserved to a height of three courses. The Roman tombs were damaged, but mostly consisted of shallow cuttings in the natural rock with covering tiles.</page><page sequence="8">8 ROBERT K. PITT 5. Athens, Mets, 8 Koryzi Street: a section of the late fourth-century BC proteichisma. Of particular interest in this area, outside the Themistoklean fortification but within the Late Roman Valerian circuit, were five Early Christian tile graves with three built steps. The internal surfaces were lined with cement, and in one a cross was incised on the wall and a fish on the floor. They seem to be associated with a hypostyle building (15.25m long, 6. 57-8. 45m wide, oriented east-west) in the southwest part of the plot, which may be one of the first Early Christian houses of worship. The walls, of rough stone and cement founded on bedrock, disturbed earlier tombs and periboloi. Inside, three rows of stone bases were probably for wooden columns. Ano Petralona 111-113 Dimophontos Street (K. Pouliou property). T. Kokkoliou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 80-81) the finding of a section of ancient road, perhaps that to Koile, in use from the Classical to the Late Hellenistic period, as well as two wells. A roadside cemetery developed to the north contained seven tombs: three cist graves, one larnax and three pit burials, dated by their grave goods to the Late Hellenistic period. A continuation of the road was uncovered at 38 Dryopon Street and Troon (D. and V. Kapopoulou property) with a large variety of pottery from an adjacent workshop dating to 380-325 BC. Plato's Academy. E. Lynkouri-Tolia (3rd EPCA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 84-85) on excavation ahead of the building of the Archaeological Museum of the City of Athens. Between Drakontos and Monastiriou Streets (the northernmost expropriated area of the Academy), only a few prehistoric sherds were discovered in the east of the area: clay, sand and shingle layers are indicative of the Kephisos river. Between Kratylou and Phonos Streets, northwest of the Gymnasium or Palaestra, abundant Late Archaic pottery was found, plus some Late Geometric and a little Early Helladic, but no architectural remains.</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 9 Aegaleo area Ploutonos and Knosou Streets. I. Tsirigoti-Drakotou (then 3rd EPCA, now Director, 2nd EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 83) on excavations associated with the western extension of Metro line 3. A 12m long section of ancient road ran east-west parallel to the modern Iera Odos. Its width (5.5m) is the same as that of the ancient Sacred Way. To the south of the road was a rectangular pedestal, and, just to the west of that, a rectangular stone orthostat was likely some sort of road sign. Obsidian blades from the road indicate that the oldest phase of the Sacred Way was prehistoric; it was then abandoned in the Geometric period (as indicated by burials at its centre) when the road shifted to the south (a section of shingle and beaten earth 10m long with a maximum width of 1.8m stretches beyond the excavation area).

A small section of the first phase of the fortification circuit of the ancient polis was discovered from around the period of the Persian Wars. The wall was made of well-cut white limestone blocks (preserved length 4.95m, width 0.9m, lower course height 0.88m), a further section of which had previously been uncovered several metres west along the same road (AR 40 [1993- 1994], 10). 26 L.

Eight graves related to the three fifth-century BC to Late Hellenistic funerary periboloi and eight graves previously excavated to the south on the same road (AR 35 [1988-1989], 21). Tomb 8 was a looted child burial in a sarcophagus. East of peribolos A, three cist graves sharing common walls (9- 11) contained no goods. In grave 12, a baby was buried, head to the west, accompanied by a Corinthian kotyle of ca. 500 BC. A pit burial (13), covered by two conglomerate slabs, contained sieved earth but no bones or goods; in the northeast corner was a pyramidal marker with three steps (0.33m high), a characteristic form of Hellenistic Megarian stele. A tile grave (15) contained a black-glazed skyphos, kylix and phiale, and another fourth-century BC vessel. Old national road (O.T. 32, 1. Papasideri property) (Fig. 7:9).

Megarid Kato Alepochori. E. Baziotopoulou-Valavani (3rd EPCA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 91-92) the discovery of a large fortification wall (19m long, 3.7m wide) 130m from the northwest slopes of the acropolis of ancient Pagai (Fig. 9). The wall is oriented north-south, with a gateway (1.4m wide) protected by a square tower (6.8m x 6.8m). Pottery from the foundations dates it to the Late Archaic and Early Classical periods. A nearby well remained in use from the fourth century AD until the 19th century. 9. Megarid, Kato Alepochori: plan of fortification wall. Bouri Alepochoriou (Mantzorou-Paraskeva property). E.

Megara, Stratigi Street: burial plot.</page><page sequence="12">12 ROBERT K. PITT This new site, towards Bouri, between ancient Pagai and Dourako, lies beside an ancient river mouth on the coast. The 2,000 pots found were an incitement to further illegal excavation. Rescue excavation revealed the founda- tions of a building and a deposit very close to the surface. A rectangular structure (5m x 2m) with an entrance on the west towards the sea was bounded by a T7-shaped peribolos wall. Between the building and the peribolos was a pebble pavement: Archaic votives placed on this and in the central part of the building include terracotta three- legged objects, figurines, pins and scarabs. On this pavement were four circular open-air altars, the largest of which produced burnt soil and sherds, bronze pins and bird bones. In the open air, east of the shrine, was an almost round votive deposit containing 12,000 vessels, mostly Argive monochrome, 400 figurines and ca. 100 small objects, mostly bronze jewellery (necklaces, earrings, fibulae, pins, rings), spirals, a few silver rings and one of gold. The pottery, which was almost entirely handmade, consists of lekythoi, usually with impressed geometric decoration, hydriae with incised and plastic anthropo- morphic decoration, prochoes, kyathoi and Corinthian aryballoi. The figurines are mostly of individuals, though there are groups of dancers, and bear engraved, plastic and incised decoration. All are standing female forms, sometimes plank-like or bird-faced, sometimes with moulded kore-like faces. Finally, at a depth of 2.2m, a circular area (9m in diameter) contained pots and sherds of the same types as elsewhere in the sanctuary. This may be the base of another votive deposit destroyed by general digging. In sum, this new site, which was not visible on the surface, contains the oldest finds yet made in the south- eastern Corinthia. The only contemporary and comparable site is the Heraion of Perachora. Finds indicate an Archaic sanctuary by a river in use for at least two centuries, probably associated with a female divinity. On the Polychronidi property, A. Vordos (3rd EPCA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 93-94) that an ancient road (15.9m long, 3.5m wide) ran east-west 25m south of the sanctuary. Its supporting walls contained Classical and Hellenistic sherds. Central and Southwestern Attica (26th EPCA: 1st EBA) Piraeus. M. Petritaki (then 2nd EPCA, now 26th EPCA) reports on a number of rescue excavations in Piraeus {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 95-101). 5 Gounari and 22-24 Aristeidou Streets (Charangioni property): a section of the northern coastal walls of the city (10.4m long, 4.3-5. 15m wide, oriented east-west, preserved to four courses high) was discovered alongside a cemetery. The wall probably dates to the Themistoklean phase (493/492 BC). Twenty metres to the north was a section of the ditch: a further section was previously identified at 23 Navarinou and Gounari Streets (see ADelt 27 [1972] Chr , 168). Between the wall and the ditch was a cemetery of 23 graves, with a further 15 uncovered north of the ditch. These are poor burials - pits, enchytrismoi , tile graves and cists; the few graves goods date from the end of the fourth century BC to the third century AD. Six had bronze coins by the heads. At the junction of Vasileos Georgiou and Notara Streets was a Roman building with tiled floors. At Skylitsi and Philonos Streets was a quarry dated by pottery to ca. fourth century BC; another, at 4 Kleisouras Street, had traces of the wedge-grooves where the limestone blocks were separated in the Classical period. Houses and cisterns were found in several locations. A probable house with two building phases (fourth and third centuries BC) was found at 108 Neoreion and 71 Sotiros Dios Streets, and a series of Hellenistic cisterns at 54 Tompazi Street. At the junction of Sotiros Dios and Ypsilantou the atrium and an andron of a second-century BC house were preserved, with floors of white, grey and black pebbles. Beneath this building was a dump containing fourth- century pottery, nails, coins, loomweights, obsidian, etc. A cistern may have been used as a dump for wasters and discard from a second-century BC potter's workshop (including moulded bowls and some lamps). At the meeting of Chatzikostanti, Aigeos and Podaleiriou Streets, eight cisterns contained Hellenistic ceramics, tiles, individual coins and two hoards of six and 25 coins, including bronze issues of the fourth, third and first centuries BC, and a silver coin of the fifth century BC. An ancient dump at the junction of Alkibiadou and Kantharou Streets may be from a ceramic workshop. It contained much pottery of the second half of the fourth to the early third century BC (kantharoi, lamps, skyphoi, plates, miniature bowls, mortars, amphoriskoi, askoi, stamped amphora handles, clay loomweights, parts of figurines, a relief plaque with a Nike and a West Slope kantharos inscribed AOPOAITHI!) (Fig. 10), plus iron and bronze nails, coins, slag, animal bone and a fragment of a marble lekanis. The Long Walls.

In the first and better-preserved section, between Kallithea and Moschato stations, the wall is preserved to 1.8m high and is made of cut blocks, 0.8m wide on each face. A flight of three steps was located here. An opening was also revealed in the wall, probably for one of the small gates placed at regular intervals all along the walls, and nearby was an inscribed boundary stele (0P05! MNHMATOIl). At this point, the Long Walls were 3.5- 4m wide. The second section was ca. 500m away near the bridge over Thessaloniki Street. A small building was found next to it and an infant pithos burial.

Kaza-Papageorgiou (then 2nd EPCA, now 26th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 102) a series of rock-cut pits, one of which resembles the typical plan of a Mycenaean tomb foundation. In another was the torso of an athlete statue, unguentaria, and fragments of strigils from tombs. Moschato Thessalonikis 90-92 (Asimomyti brothers property). M. Petritaki reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 102-03) on finds from test trenches in a probable cemetery area outside the southern arm of the Long Walls. A fourth-century BC marble lekythos preserves the scene of a dexiosis between a seated old woman wearing a chiton with a himation covering her head and a standing young female dressed in a long chiton, belted peplos and himation. Further along the same street (no. 42, Photopoulou property) was a fourth-century inscribed marble cylindrical base for a loutrophoros (Fig. 11) with part of the foot still leaded into it: it is inscribed ATTHMANTOZ KOAAYTEYI. Kallithea Salaminos 42 (Kolokotroni property). M. Petritaki reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 103-05) on a cluster of tombs of the fifth and fourth centuries BC, which include a limestone sarcophagus, two child larnax burials and two enchytrismoi in amphorae. The sarcophagus was oriented northeast-southwest, and the body was accompanied by an aryballoid lekythos. One larnax contained a skyphos of the Leafless Group with a lid depicting a Dionysiac scene with maenads and satyrs brandishing thyrsoi, a two- handled skyphos, small olpes and an unpainted prochous.

Workshops, including a dyer's shop, cemeteries and individual burials have also come to light during excavations undertaken in the last three years in the municipalities of Argyroupoli, Ag. Dimitrios, Daphni and Nea Smyrni. Alimos To Vima (08/05/10) reports the discovery of a Classical dye works during work at the east entrance of the Alimos Metro station. The site included troughs dug into the bedrock, square shallow tanks used for washing, four wells carved in the rock, postholes indicating stakes for tents or other structures for drying washed or dyed fabric, and shallow pipelines for water supply. A large building near the dyer's shop contained punches, millstones, more than 100 loomweights, spindle-whorls and coins (including two Athenian silver tetradrachms). A foundation deposit underneath one wall contained 23 vessels of the late fourth century BC. Pani hill. K. Kaza-Papageorgiou reports on several studies around the highest hill in the Alimos area (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 105-06). A section of the prehistoric circuit wall was found 60m from the top: within the enclosed area, wall foundations produced obsidian chips and blades, stone tools and Final Neolithic sherds. Towards the centre of the unbuilt part of the hill, southwest of Granikou Street, was an ancient conglomerate quarry. On the southwestern part of the hill, just below the belvedere, an extensive (400m2) Classical limestone quarry (Fig. 12) preserved traces of abandoned blocks which had cracked during the removal process and many tool marks. Rock-cuttings appear to have been used as shelters by shepherds during the Middle Byzantine period. Vouliagmenis Avenue 585 578A. K. Kaza-Papageorgiou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 106-07) on tombs discovered during excavation for a natural gas line - two pyre pits, a larnax burial and five other pyres. In one pit was an incomplete phiale inscribed AMEINO on the base. The larnax contained nine pots, including a black-figure pyxis with lid and two miniature lekanes. A larnax with a pedimental cover (containing an adult burial) and an offering pyre were found at the junction of Messinis and Kythirion Streets.</page><page sequence="14">14 ROBERT K. PITT 12. Alimos, Pani Hill: limestone quarry. Glyfada. K. Kaza-Papageorgiou reports ( ADelt55 [2000] Chr , 107-12) on investigations around Glyphada. At the junction of Ag. Nikolaou and Iras Streets (O.T. 289, Mileousi brothers' property) excavation ahead of construction 100m southwest of the Chapel of Ag. Nikolaos, near the centre of the ancient deme of Aixone, revealed a workshop with a connected residence and part of the main road to the city of Athens (20m long, 5m wide). The road is cut into bedrock, preserving two sets of wheel ruts (Fig. 13). West of the road, workshop founda- tions covering ca. 700m2 were apparently used for clay preparation and brick manufacture. A series of shallow basins connected by channels indicates an elaborate water system. Next to the installations, various rooms are dated by pottery and coins to the second half of the fourth century BC. At Venezouelas and Agamemnonos Streets (O.T. 386, I. Dinou property), diagonally opposite the large Middle Byzantine structure at O.T. 384, a layer 0.3m deep of gravel and small stones, covering an area of ca. 70m2, was defined by dry-stone walls. These small stones may derive from the cleaning of adjacent fields or may have been connected with rural activity such as the drying of agricul- tural products. No pottery or other clear evidence was found to date the construction. A variety of Classical architectural remains are reported. A large section of Classical retaining wall was found at 33 Ag. Lavras Street (O.T. 344, E. and M. Stavrianaki property). At Artemidos and Laodikis (O.T. 67, A. Biniou property), a layer of earth and stone with much Classical pottery covered an area of bedrock which had cuttings probably for rain-water collection. A section of a probable Classical property boundary wall at Kavalas 17 and Kandanon (O.T 42, G. Saridaki property) was built 13. Alimos, Glyphada: plan of junction of Ag.

A similar technique was used for two further Classical boundary walls at 44 Irakleitou and 108 Aretis (O.T. 451, Skarmea property). Part of a cemetery of Aixone dating from the sixth to fourth century BC was found during the laying of a natural gas line on Semilis Street: it seems to continue to the north. Subsequent excavations revealed two cist graves, three funeral pyres, a larnax with a stone cover, a pit burial, three enchytrismoi in amphorae and a ritual offering pyre. Finds include lekythoi and a bronze dikastic pinakion, dating before the middle of the fourth century BC, which names NAYTEAHZ of the deme of Aixone (Fig. 14). 14.

On the western side of Asteria hill, an irregular peribolos surrounded an area with small walls and Early Helladic pottery, obsidian blades and chips, stone tools, shell and a little bone. On the main beach of Asteria was a well-built peribolos wall of the end of the third to the early second millennium BC. Breaching the wall in several places were 34 Late Roman tombs, including 23 tile graves, three cist graves, a pit burial and two enchytrismoi ; pottery dated from the fourth to the sixth century AD, with a little glass and some bronze coins.

Furthermore, in the area of Trigonou Kampa (Leontariou and Kolegiou Streets) remains of an ancient road, 22.5m long and oriented east- west, were identified, while the area of a pit grave produced the body of a stone funerary lekythos of the first half of the fourth century BC. Koropl. O. Kakavogianni (2nd EPCA) reports on excava- tions around the ancient demes of Lower and Upper Lamptrai ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 129-32: including a useful map of the excavated areas). At Psilokoryphi hill (E. Chalkiadi property) a prehis- toric acropolis previously noted ( cf AR 52 [2005-2006], 13) was further investigated on the southeastern side. A thin layer of pottery above stereo dates to the Final Neolithic, above which was a peribolos of large stones with an entrance 1.5m wide and other Mycenaean struc- tures. To the east was a circular ditch (1.1m in diameter, 0.3m deep) containing Mycenaean ceramics, bones of large animals and a fragment of a Phi figurine. To the east was a pit with much Mycenaean pottery, particularly kylikes, cups and prochoes, also bones of large animals, figurine fragments and parts of a foundry with bronze slag. Between Epidavrou and Keas Streets an ancient road was disturbed during illegal house building; excavation revealed remains of buildings, perhaps rural in nature, of the fourth century BC. Around 150m to the west, at the junction of Epidavrou and Irakleous Streets, where the ancient road crosses towards the Mesogeia, a small structure of stone blocks may be a tower. At Makria Pefka (Taxiarchon and Kyprou Streets) a Roman farmstead composed of nine rooms was identified. At Lambrika, north of Varis-Koropiou Avenue, in the area of a previously investigated Early Helladic house, further building remains produced EHIIB ceramics. On Iphaistou Street (Tycom Company property), south of Varis-Koropiou Avenue, an area within a well-built peribolos was investigated, through which led a road with built boundaries. To the northeast, a small repository (perhaps a cenotaph) contained figurines (a seated female and two males), five lekythoi, a small pyxis and a skyphos, all dating to the mid fifth century BC. That the area was a temenos can be inferred from an inscription on an unpainted amphora: HAYAOZ MANE[©EKEN]. A marble plaque from the peribolos was inscribed: "Opog Xcopiou/ kou oitdas TTETr/paiaevcov eir/i Xuoei Sevo/Tijicoi 'kapieT/ TTpoiKos Mvri/aioTpdTTii X. In the area of the Health Centre, where the remains of a prehistoric house were previously excavated (ADelt 44 [1989] Chr , 84), the existence of further prehistoric struc- tures was confirmed, and Mycenaean and Geometric sherds recovered. Around 100m to the west, part of an EHII building was found, containing a large amount of obsidian and indications that obsidian was worked here. Glyka Nera. O. Kakavogianni reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 132) on works relating to the area's road network. To the east side of Anatolis Street (O.T. 152), two tombs were found along with Late Geometric to fourth- century BC sherds. From Byzantiou Street (Adamopoulou property) part of a wall and two funerary stelae probably relate to a nearby Classical cemetery. Continued investi- gation of the Mycenaean cemetery on Aspra Chomata hill focused on a large tomb between O.T. 206 and 207, enclosed by Messolongiou, Nikopoleos, Aiolou and Triphyllias Streets. A small chamber tomb was also explored; it contained two bodies. Paiania Pousi Ledi. O. Kakavogianni (2nd EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 133-34) two funerary periboloi located at the junction of two ancient roads during work for the Attiki Odos. One peribolos, at the northwest of the crossroads, had a semicircular exedra in the corner; while the other, 60m to the west, was a simple rectangular structure. Inside the large peribolos were the built steps of six bases for funerary monuments. Below these were four marble larnakes and four cremations, with 11 later tile graves around them. A pit contained pottery and remains of burning. The cemetery was in use from the second half of the fifth century BC until the Hellenistic period. From the later period came a hoard of 67 Attic bronze new-style coins. A section of a large funerary naiskos about 3m long, which must have been set in the exedra, carried the inscription OIAITTTTH AY2IMAXOY. Other finds include a small stele of one Herakleides, part of a small marble base or funerary table with relief figures, a marble lekythos with a dexiosis relief and part of a loutrophoros. The second peribolos also contained built bases, and four pit and two tile graves dated to the fourth century BC. One of the tile graves contained a female burial with bronze earrings, a metal agricultural tool and two dolls. In the same area, a few metres from the ancient well of Pousi Ledi, within the agricultural road, was a Roman building with marble Corinthian capitals. Pouli. O. Kakavogianni reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 134) the excavation of a large Late Classical residential complex above an older sanctuary a little before the entrance to the airport. The sanctuary, a simple late fifth- century BC naiskos, was surrounded by a peribolos. Four lead weights were recovered from the residential building.</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 17 Markopoulo Merenda. O. Kakavogianni reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 134-36) the discovery of two family tombs, one Archaic and the other Classical, ca. 500m to the west of the large cemetery where in 1972 the statue of Phrasikleia was found. The Archaic cemetery produced 23 tombs (one cist, one tile, two cremations and 19 enchytrismoi ), mostly of the sixth century BC. Among the finds were parts of large black-figure pots with Dionysiac scenes, probably placed as grave markers. The Classical cemetery, located 30m to the south, contained two larnax burials, a bronze urn within a marble box and 16 crema- tions. Goods included lekythoi, a bronze mirror and bronze jewellery.

Northern and Northwestern Attica (2nd EPCA: 1st EBA) Ano Liosia Tsouklidi. M. Platonos (2nd EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 117-18) an Early Christian basilica and a Roman building on a small hill in the municipal nursery (Fig. 16). Southwest of the Roman building were 12 Late Roman tombs, with another to the northeast. The walls of the basilica incorporate Classical marble architectural spolia and fragments of funerary stelae and lekythoi. Area A (3.8m x 2.8m), at the centre of the south wall of the basilica, was probably an entrance or a narthex. This area contained a destruction layer of ash, undecorated domestic pottery, many lamps, loomweights, fragments of glass vessels, iron nails and pieces of lead and marble. Much Late Roman to Byzantine roof tile and brick was also cleared. 16. Ano Liosia, Tsouklidi: Roman and Early Christian buildings. The 13 tombs were mostly pit burials with crude coverings, all containing individual burials and oriented east-west. Grave goods include lekythoi, prochoes and phialae, as well as a pin and earrings in the shape of lilies. Above the tombs were placed large upright stones or tiles. The pottery dates to AD 540-665. Monis Arkadiou Street. M. Platonos reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 118-21) the discovery of large slabs and abundant Roman pottery ca. 500-800m from the Sanctuary of Herakles excavated in 1959. A large Late Roman bath complex with many cisterns, hypocausts and water conduits was uncovered: this incor- porated Classical spolia from a large public building as well as fragments of funerary kioniskoi and stelae, and a stone statue base. There were three building phases - two of the fifth to fourth century BC and another dated by coinage to the Late Roman/Byzantine period. The Classical phases produced black-figure and red-figure sherds, black-glazed prochoes, amphorae, plates and skyphoi. Ceramics of the Roman period (fourth to fifth century AD) were predominantly utilitarian: pointed amphorae, prochoes with comb decoration, plates, lekanes, chytres, pitchers, lamps, fragments of large pithoi, glass unguentaria, an iron dagger, four pyramidal loomweights, grinders, tiles, iron nails and fragments of lead and bronze. One large bronze pitcher was found almost intact. Of the 37 bronze coins found, the oldest has the head of Athena with Corinthian helmet of Demetrios Poliorketes and an owl on the reverse. Another, with the head of Athena and an olive tree on the reverse with the legend AGE, dates to the first century BC, while a second-century AD bronze coin depicts Athena in a Corinthian helmet and a trireme on the reverse. Other coins have busts of various Roman emperors and include coins of Theodosius I and Anastasius I. The area of the baths produced fragments of funerary kioniskoi with the inscriptions: AEQKPATH2 OIAITTTTOY...PEYI, and AH...OOQN...QMENOY. These perhaps indicate that the area was an important part of the ancient deme of Cholargos. Menidi (ancient Acharnai) G. Ritsou and Chalkidikis Streets. M. Platonos reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 121-24) on continued excavation of a Roman farmstead (see ADelt 45 [1990] Chr , 78-80): many storage areas and cisterns were uncovered (Fig. 17). The northeast room (1) had outer walls of stone, brick and mortar, incorporating earlier material from the neigh- bouring Classical peribolos to the west. On the east side was the lower part of a staircase leading to an upper floor. West of the house, where trials had located many sherds, excavation revealed small walls and a packed layer, probably of a road. A rubbish pit contained much pottery (lamps, plates, prochoes and cups), as well as millstones, marble revetments, fragments of marble sculpture, tile, brick and ash. East of the house were two fifth- to fourth-century BC funerary periboloi oriented northwest-southeast and much pillaged for building materials for the Roman house. Peribolos 1 (6.4m x 7.5m) contained two pyres with lekythoi and a strigil. Peribolos 2 (8.65m x 5.55m) contained two pyres and two sarcophagi, much damaged. Tomb 4 produced a black-figure lekythos, a bronze mirror and an iron nail, while sarcophagus 7 contained an</page><page sequence="18">18 ROBERT K. PITT 17. Menidi (ancient Acharnai), G.

M. Pantelidou-Gofas (ASA) reports {Ergon [2009], 11-14) on the 2009 season at the Early Helladic cemetery. Tomb 43 was a large construction with an elongated entrance, which shows evidence of successive repairs and remodelling. The bones in the grave were mostly separated into groups. The first consisted of bones without skulls; the second had bones, plus two adult and one infant skulls; and in the third group skulls were found with a pyxis which contained the bones of an infant and a stone bowl. Injuries observed on the skulls are consistent with damage from stones; the excavator notes that several have holes apparently made with a sharp tool. All (with the exception of the final burial) lack the lower jaw, and the children also had apparently experienced treatment of this kind. The last burial in the pit was in a contracted position, with the lower jaw shattered; above this skeleton were three skulls without mandibles and below it the remains of an older burial. At a deeper level were the bones of at least three other individuals placed in the same position, with Late Neolithic pottery. Tomb 43 confirmed that the cemetery has an older and a more recent phase of use, and that the later inhabitants of the area respected the earlier dead. Special care was taken with the remains of infants. It further confirms that the removal of the lower jaw was in accordance with custom; it was also customary to place pebbles above the lower skeletons. Finally, after the final burial in the tomb, the entrance was filled with large stones, to prevent re-use, and a second peribolos was built. The Soros.

The investigation brought to light a new structure with strong walls defining a series of spaces. One of these areas was probably a cistern lined with hydraulic cement; to the west were the remains of a semicircular exedra and marble architectural fragments. Marathon Museum. fM.

These remains are now seen to form part of a larger structure which extends to the north. Stone foundations of a square building were found, with traces of two small round stone bases for wooden columns, shell, obsidian and Late Neolithic pottery. Skala Oropou. A. Mazarakis Ainian (Thessaly) reports {Ergon [2009], 26-28) on continued excavation of the oval buildings A A and AE. An infant burial within a handmade Late Geometric prochous was placed horizon- tally, mouth to the south. Building AE was 9.5m long x 5.5m wide, with successive floors and pottery of the end of the eighth century, loomweights, spindle-whorls and beads. A wall 14.5m long east of the excavation is considered to be a peribolos contemporary with building Zt and older than building AE. The oval building AA (above AE) dates to the transition between the Geometric and Archaic periods. The west wall of the two oval buildings served to protect them from flooding. An Archaic drainage channel adjacent to the east removed rain-water. A foundation deposit associated with the construction of this channel contained a small seventh- century libation vessel.</page><page sequence="20">20 CATHERINE MORGAN THE PELOPONNESE By Catherine Morgan ISLANDS OF THE SARONIC GULF with KYTHERA (26th EPCA: 1st EBA) Aegina Publication: V.

Papastavrou (then 2nd EPCA, now Byzantine and Christian Museum) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 136) on excavation at Koumoundourou Street (A. Cheliotou property) where two ancient walls were uncovered. To the west was a rectangular cistern, 1.2m x 0.94m and 1.58m deep, built from large unworked stones coated with mortar. The walls may be related to the Roman bath found in a neighbouring plot (ADelt 31 [1982] Chr , 48-49). At Kapodistriou Street (Lambrou property) trial trenches uncovered a robbed single-chambered tomb containing a large limestone sarcophagus. A second underground chamber was not investigated. At 4 P. and A. Kappou Street (Lekka property) a rectangular built wine- press was excavated, plastered with cement. The centre was covered with small tiles, with a circular depression 0.95m in diameter and 0.5m deep. Phaneromeni. E.

Only tomb I contained finds - two bodies within a limestone sarcophagus. Kambos Mylon. E. Papastavrou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 137) excavation of six underground tombs, all robbed. Finds from tomb I support a date of the late sixth to early fifth century BC. On the Kavalierou property three underground tombs, again all robbed, produced finds indicating a date in the first decades of the fifth century BC. Lagousa. Y.

The wreck, located at a depth of 6-7m, carried a cargo of amphorae and tile from Chios. A large quantity of high vessel bases may come from Chian chalices. Saronic Harbors Archaeological Research Project (SHARP). D. Pullen (ASCSA/Florida) and T. Tartaron (AS CS A/Pennsylvania) report on the third and final field season in 2009, which again focused on the Mycenaean harbour settlement at Korphos-Kalamianos and the surrounding territory (Fig. 18). An architectural plan of the LHIIIB town with its circuit walls has been produced, plus detailed plans and descriptions of many structures at Kalamianos and Stiri (Fig. 19). Systematic surface collection of material both within the enclosed area and in the walls of individual structures provided chronological and functional infor- mation. Aerial photographs of Kalamianos and its archi- tecture were taken from a tethered balloon. 18.

Saronic Harbors Archaeological Research Project (SHARP): structures 4- VI and 4-IX overlain on aerial photograph. Surface survey focused on areas and locations so far understudied, particularly to the west and southwest of Korphos village; on detailed investigation of features of potential significance recorded in 2008; on the resurvey of several Architectural Discovery Units at Kalamianos; and on finer-grained survey at sites of particular interest, especially the upland site of Stiri. All survey zones and the most significant sites and other ancient features within them have now been appropriately explored. Of particular note are: a major Early Bronze Age component at Stiri, Late Roman occupation west of the village of Korphos and the only Classical site discovered by SHARP, in the upland basin of Lakka Gliata (Spati). Continued geological and geomorphological study of the Korphos region resulted in the complete mapping of bedrock and landform. The bedrock in the region consists of Mesozoic limestone with well-developed karstic features. Faults are common in the area: most have normal or oblique shear motion and south side down relative offset. Landforms include still active debris fans on the flanks of steeper slopes, making it likely that any Bronze Age surface is deeply buried within any given fan. The landscape also displays prominent karst landforms. Analysis of the neotectonic history aims to provide a better understanding of the relative (and if possible absolute) motion on faults near Kalamianos and Stiri. This area is broken into several fault blocks, each potentially moving with a different tilt or to a different degree of uplift/subsi- dence. Data on the orientation of geological bedding were collected at 182 locations from Korphos to Stiri to enable reconstruction of the movement of each fault block relative to all others. These will also determine whether the Kalamianos block, which beachrock data shows to have subsided, has tilted rather than undergone simple vertical subsidence. Troizen. M. Giannopoulou (26th EPCA) reports {To Vima 05/04/09) on excavation in the east cemetery, where burials begin in the Protogeometric period. Fifteen new graves were revealed (including pit, cist and tile graves, enchytrismoi , larnakes and pithoi, and cremations), as well as a marble funerary peribolos of the fourth century. Three of the graves contained a variety and wealth of metal offerings, noting also debris of bronze working in a Roman cistern. Child burials include: an early seventh-century burial of an infant in a larnax, with a thilastron and three other vessels; a Hellenistic pithos burial of a child with a jointed doll, two winged erotes, two female figurines, two iron rings and vases including two thilastra; two further child burials, one of the late eighth century and the other of the seventh century, accompanied by small vases. Modi (Liontari), shipwreck. C. Agouridis (Hellenic Institute for Maritime Archaeology) reports ( Ethnos [16/01/10], Eleftherotypia [20/01/10], Ta Nea [09/02/10]) on the first phase of excavation of a LHIIIC shipwreck, completed in autumn 2009. The containers recovered (at least 20 transport vessels, mostly hydriae and amphorae) indicate that the ship transported liquids, oil or wine, as well as dry goods (especially fruits). CORINTHIA (37th EPCA: 25th EBA) Isthmia. E. Gebhard (ASCSA/Chicago) reports on continuing study by the University of Chicago. Construction debris from the Archaic Temple of Poseidon showed that the wall blocks were finished when hoisted into place. A block was identified as belonging to a stone floor in the pteron at the east end of the building, installed probably in the second half of the sixth century BC. A stylobate block, adjacent but not in situ , has a cutting on its rear edge for a floor slab or other stone fitting. Examination of materials from the construction of the Classical Temple of Poseidon and its subsequent rebuilding after the fire of 390 BC indicates that the temple was almost entirely rebuilt, re-using earlier fragments wherever possible. Its condition when robbed in the fifth century AD was clarified. Patterns of stone robbing found during the 1954 excavations were traced from the excavation notebooks. A section drawing through the Antonine Temple of Palaimon was prepared. The entrance to the passage leading to the adyton lay at the floor level of the precinct surrounding the temple: the passage vault would have risen almost 3m above the entrance, confirming the high, narrow shape of the opening depicted on Corinthian coins of the period. In the Rachi settlement, study of the terracotta archi- tecture and roof tiles revealed a class of tile manufactured in Corinthian fabric but comparable to Laconian in shape and size. Since the two systems were incompatible, some houses must have had Corinthian roofs, while the Corinthian-type Laconian tiles could only be used for Laconian-type roofs, perhaps in a combination with true Laconian tiles. T. Gregory (AS CS A/Ohio) reports on the work of the Ohio State University team. Continuing study of material from the Roman bath, the area east of the Temenos (the East Field) and the Byzantine Fortress, was accompanied by cleaning and study in these areas. Further conservation of the mosaics of the Roman bath (especially rooms VI and XII) was undertaken. The cleaning and stabilization of old trenches south of the Roman bath and east of the Temenos continued. Undocumented building remains traced in trenches from the 1970s comprise the foundations of two parallel Roman walls apparently from a colonnaded peribolos adjoining the Roman bath to the south.</page><page sequence="22">22 CATHERINE MORGAN The Hexamilion Outworks project continued investi- gation of a large Early Roman complex just north of the bath. The walls of this structure rest on Classical founda- tions, and several construction periods can be identified. This complex is evidently different from the large Doric- style structure to the northeast. Isthmia, Galota. Hexamilion (Justinianic wall). Following the completion of rescue excavation ( cf. ADelt 47 [1992] Chr , 164-66), K. Skarmoutsou-Dimitropoulou (6th EBA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 348-49) on the conservation and display of the section of the Justinianic wall by the three new road and railway bridges constructed in the Isthmus area. Kenchreai. E. Korka (Ministry of Culture and Tourism), J. Rife (ASCSA/Vanderbilt University) and K. Kissas (Director, 37th EPCA), with R Kasimi (37th EPCA), report on the 2009 excavation season on the Koutsongila ridge north of the ancient harbour. In area A, activity concentrated on the wall found in 2007 and the areas to the west and east. A further 4m long stretch was uncovered, continuing south. The wall rests at the base of a small hill; a dense Early to Middle Roman sherd deposit, representing pottery washed downslope against the wall, was found to continue along its interior (west) face. To the east, a broad depression ( ca . 4.5m wide) extends from the wall to a vertical face in the bedrock outcrop upon which sits the rectangular building of probable ritual function explored in 2007-2008. This depression may be an important traffic route, although no road surface or wheel ruts were preserved in its relatively soft calcareous bed. The long wall was thus erected to arrest slope erosion and protect the depression from sediment and debris. A passageway or road along the depression would have approached the harbour from the north across the middle of the ridge, and entered the harbour front from behind the complex at the base of the north mole. Renewed exploration of the area west of the long wall and on top of the hillock uncovered evidence for burial and cremation (trench A-09-02). Although this seems to have been an open area in antiquity, a channel cut across the trench contained a distinct layer of ash mixed with intensely burned human and animal bone, buried haphazardly under rubble - debris from one or more pyres deposited here after multiple cremations and then covered. The area formed part of a larger cremation zone (a smaller secondary deposit of similarly burned bones was found nearby in 2007). The primary position of the cremation pyres is uncertain. Area B, near the southeast edge of Koutsongila, was the main focus in 2009 (Fig. 20). The function of the structures uncovered in 2008 was clarified. In the area of the putative Early to Middle Roman villa, excavation of the well was completed to modern sea level ( ca . 7.4m deep), though in antiquity it clearly went deeper. The well was filled with structural and domestic debris from a fifth- century cleaning operation following the destruction and disuse of the villa: this may be associated with the erection of a major structure nearby. Excavation immediately to the south revealed a large octagonal structure (14.25m maximum interior width) erected in an apparently open area in late antiquity. This 20. Kenchreai: area B (south half).</page><page sequence="23">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 23 had a massive outer wall in mixed mortar, rubble and brick, founded on platforms set into the bedrock on the north side and in shallow footing trenches on the south. Inside, a series of angular piers divided an outer ambulatory from an interior chamber. One wide entry was found in the north wall: others may have existed, but the evidence is lost. Numerous fragments of blueish-grey schistose marble with acanthus leaves in relief show that the interior walls were richly finished. The floor of the ambulatory was in places paved with simple tiles but elsewhere consisted of hard-packed earth. In contrast, the central chamber had a mosaic pavement of interlocking geometric patterns with diamonds, stars and circles in black, white and red. A building of this scale with such an impressive design and decor, located prominently above the harbour, must have dominated the landscape. Associated artefacts and stratigraphy provide a broad outline of the building's history. Along the exterior base of the north wall, a narrow trench opened into a small ellip- tical pit containing numerous intact lamps and coins delib- erately placed. This foundation deposit dates to the early fifth century. When the Octagon fell into disuse, sediment collected over the decaying floors, and transients made fires and built a screen wall inside the building. Finds from the thin deposits over the floor do not postdate the mid sixth century. Around that time, the building collapsed in a catastrophic event that toppled the walls into one massive layer of structural debris over the whole area. Few artefacts relate to the Octagon's use, leaving its design and surroundings as the best evidence for its function. Comparable octagonal buildings were erected in late antiquity as palace-halls (e.g. Thessaloniki), baptisteries (e.g. Ravenna), Imperial mausolea (e.g. Romanuliana) and martyria (e.g. Phrygian Hierapolis). No walls were found to indicate that the Octagon formed part of a larger archi- tectural plan, making identification with a palatial or eccle- siastical complex unlikely. However, seven fifth- or sixth- century cist graves (G63-G69) of the finest construction were clustered around it and aligned with its walls. The intentional placing of these distinctive graves suggests that the Octagon had a funerary function, but whether as the burial site of a member of the local elite or a holy figure is uncertain. If so, the Octagon is a rare case in the known architectural repertoire of late antique Greece. In area C, in the heart of the Roman cemetery, one chamber tomb, tomb 2, was explored. The rectangular chamber (4.15m x 4.6m) resembles others on Koutsongila: it is rock-cut, has loculi and niches in the walls for inhumation and cremation, a bench on the front wall and an altar on the back, and a vaulted ceiling. The walls preserve painted plaster with polychrome-banded decoration and a schematic garland in red, while the floor was finished with cement. The construction apparently dates to the mid/late first century, as other tombs on the ridge. The chamber was looted at an early date, and the numerous cups, bowls, cookware lids, lamps and a miniature stone altar were scattered. Thereafter, apart from occasional disturbances by robbers, the chamber gradually filled with a combi- nation of disintegrated mortar, plaster and rock that had collapsed from the walls, and washed-in colluvial sediment. Exploration outside the tomb revealed that a building in mortar and rubble with a monumental facade once enclosed the narrow, rock-cut stairway descending to the stomion. No structures or artefacts were found to identify graveside rituals, which must have occurred elsewhere and/or inside the chamber. Finally, wheel ruts running north-south through this area predate the construction of the tomb, and thus give a sense of the traffic along the coast before the development of the cemetery. Loutraki, Katounistra (Sega property). Z. Aslamatzidou-Kostourou (then 4th EPCA, now Director, 6th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 191) on a fifth season of excavation of this Roman residence. The large apse was fully exposed, as were three similarly-sized rooms immediately to the east, the walls of which contained numerous architectural spolia. An Early Christian (fifth- to sixth-century AD) marble cuirass was found inside the south room. The middle room had doors in the north, east and west walls: an iron ring with a cross was found inside it. In the north room, a second-century AD lamp was found upon a flight of steps along the west wall. To the east lay a rectangular room, the south wall of which overlay a marble krepis corresponding to that previ- ously discovered on the west side. Close to its west wall, a pit grave with a stone cover was cut though the stone- paved floor. In the fill of the room was a sixth-century AD plain ware lamp. Yet further to the east, another room preserved wall-plaster. These two eastern rooms were created by partitioning one original space, at which time the door in the east wall was closed. All areas contained fragments of tile and marble facing, and undiagnostic bronze coins. Ancient Corinth. G. Sanders (ASCSA) reports on the 2009 season of excavation and study in the complex of medieval and post-medieval houses in the area of the South Stoa. Documentation of pottery from the 1960s excavations and of the standing remains in the central section was completed (Fig. 21). Later structures overlying the medieval house in the central section of the area were removed and six rooms excavated down to their construction phase. The floor of the northwest room was covered with a thin sherd deposit representing a minimum of 37 Constantinopolitan White Ware pitchers. Such 21. Ancient Corinth: late 12th to early 13th century bowl from early excavations.</page><page sequence="24">24 CATHERINE MORGAN pitchers were frequently used as kettles for boiling water, to judge from lime-scaling and flash marks on the exterior of known examples. However, none of the pieces from the northwest room showed evidence of use, and they seem to have been kept in storage. A pit cut through the floor contained a large llth-century storage amphora re-used in some form of industrial activity (its mouth and neck had been heated to temperatures which melted the fabric into an amorphous mass). The well in the east room was filled in the late 13th century. It contained a mass of restorable fine, cooking and plain vessels, datable to ca. 1260-1270, and quantities of domestic animal and bird bone, fish scales, sea shells and eggshell. Among the faunal remains were the vertebra of a large tuna which originally weighed over 200kg, and the maxilla and mandible of a hoopoe ( Upopa epops). The westerly of the south-central rooms originally had two large storage pithoi set in the floor. These were removed, probably in the 13th century. The room to the east had a hearth belonging to the earliest use of the house, but there is no clear evidence for cooking activity in later phases. Apart from the floors of the southwest room and the space under the stair excavated in 2008, and with the exception of the northwest room, all the domestic contexts were kept remarkably clean. The house dates to the 11th century and was modified in the 12th and especially 13th centuries. Its form is essentially that of a courtyard house with an open central court surrounded by nine domestic, storage and stabling spaces. The southern range of rooms certainly had a second storey. Kraneio, ancient Corinth. K. Skarmoutsou- Dimitropoulou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 369-72) a Late Roman cemetery and part of the city wall of ancient Corinth on the property of K. Katelouzou and a Late Roman bath on the property of I.A. Sophou (200m away). Some 350m west of the amphitheatre, a 9.6m long stretch of the Late Roman city wall ran east- west (Fig. 22). The exterior face is isodomic, but the south face above the euthynteria shows patches of irregular construction. The fill is of unworked stone, brick and strong cement. The Late Roman wall, built in the early fifth century AD following 22. Kraneio, ancient Corinth: section of Late Roman walls and tombs. the earthquakes and Visigothic incursions of the late fourth century, re-used masonry from the Classical wall and the amphitheatre. Burials indicate the presence of a planned Early Christian (fifth- to sixth-century) cemetery beside it. Three enchytrismoi in amphorae lie just outside the north face of the wall; further north were three cist tombs and one vaulted tomb in a group oriented east-west, and three more cist tombs were found at the north of the plot. Coins comprise a Late Roman issue (AD 334-335), one of Theophilos (AD 832-839) and one of Romananos (AD 1067). A female burial in tomb 2 contained traces of gold thread from clothing and a gold ring. The pottery, closely datable to the fifth to sixth century, consists of LR1, LR4 and Africana I amphorae, three funerary vessels and lamps of Attic, North African and Asia Minor type (Fig. 23). 23. Kraneio, ancient Corinth: lamps from the tombs. Excavation of the Late Roman bath continued ( cfi ADelt 50 [1995] Chr, , 270-71; ADelt 53 [1998] Chr, , 311-12). Five further adjacent rooms on the south were uncovered, with water channels and a rock-cut well. One hall, approached via two steps, contained a well in the northeast corner, a tiled floor and evidence of a complex hydraulic system in and around the east wall. Across the room ran what is probably the main water-collection channel of the complex. A tile grave with a twin burial lay to the northwest. It is clear that the main rooms of the complex lie to the south and east: these remain to be investigated. Finds include two bronze coins (of Diocletian, AD 295-295, and Manuel I, AD 1143-1180), domestic pottery and architectural spolia (Fig. 24). 24. Kraneio, ancient Corinth: capital.</page><page sequence="25">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 25 Ancient Sikyon (Vasiliko), football stadium (A. and T. Tselondre property). P. Kasimi (then 4th EPCA, now 37th EPCA) reports ( ADelt55 [2000] Chr , 192) on excavation in an ancient quarry, revealing exposed quarry faces and abandoned blocks. The quarry lay 0.2m below the modern surface and reached a depth of 1.2m. Further finds are a conduit cut into the rock and a partially preserved mosaic pavement probably from a courtyard. Terracotta small finds of the first half of the third century BC include two intact lamps, two loomweights and a tear-bottle. Two well-preserved silver tetradrachms were found: one an Alexander from the mint of Miletos (Sikyon Museum 3162) and the second of Demetrios Poliorketes (298-295 BC) from the mint of Amphipolis (Sikyon Museum 3163). Sikyon Survey Project. Y. Lolos (Thessaly) reports on the 2009 study season. Prehistoric pottery of all phases from Middle Neolithic to LHIIIC was found in small quantities mostly on the southeast edge of the plateau. A very little Geometric and Archaic pottery and small concentrations of Classical were also found on the plateau: the majority of sherds are Hellenistic and Roman. Most are coarse domestic ware: petrographic analysis shows that this fabric is a mixture of marl and terra rossa clays with quartz, limestone and flint inclusions. The Early and Middle Hellenistic pottery of Sikyon (end of the fourth- to the mid second-century BC) resembles that of neighbouring Corinth, Isthmia and Stymphalos, and differs appreciably from that of Attica, Argos and Elis. Aegean imports are almost unknown: the few imports found are mostly amphorae from the Adriatic (especially Brindisi and Lamboglia 2 types), which served as models when local production developed in the second century BC. From the second century BC to the first century AD, tablewares, cookwares and other domestic pottery were also produced in the characteristic local coarse clay with silicate inclusions. The most significant potters' quarter in ancient Sikyon lay at the southern edge of the south plateau, bordered by residential blocks to the north and east. Hellenistic material was scattered over the entire plateau, with the greatest concentrations on the south plateau. The area immediately south of the agora (SP76- 81) produced (mostly domestic) middle and late Imperial pottery (second- to fourth-century AD). The area east of the agora (SP83-106) contained large concentrations of Late Roman and Early Byzantine material (fourth- to seventh-century AD), although Early Byzantine fineware is almost completely absent. There is little Late Roman and Byzantine on the southeastern projection of the plateau (SP82 and 107) where pottery is mostly Frankish and Ottoman (13th- to 16th- century). The expansion of the settlement probably relates to the development of the castle by the Villehardouin in the early 13th century. The 21 coins found in the survey range from a fourth- century BC Athenian issue to a 16th-century Venetian. Planning of the excavated monuments in the agora (the temple and overlying basilica, the stoa, palaestra and bouleuterion) progressed, and many of the ancient quarries, architectural remains and geological features were mapped. Magnetometry was undertaken at selected locations on the plateau, notably the (as yet unexcavated) stadium: the track is estimated as 28m wide and 198m long. Samples from selected points on the plateau were analysed using X-ray fluorescence to identify settlement, manufacturing and agricultural activity. In area NP104, high levels of phosphorus and potassium inside the ancient residential blocks probably reflect the discard of domestic refuse. Much lower levels are found along the roads. Higher values for metals such as zinc and to some degree copper also relate to buildings, as does the presence of sulphur. Website: http://extras.ha.uth.gr/sikyon Kryoneri, cave of Lechova. L. Kormazopoulou and I. Zygouri (then EPS, now EPSNE) report ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1203) on rescue excavation in 1999 and 2000. A manmade pit was discovered, but no clear stratigraphy: as in previous campaigns, finds consisted of pottery and figurine fragments dating from the second half of the sixth to the late fourth/early third century BC. Ancient Tenea. The Ministry of Culture and Tourism (press releases [18/05/10, 01/06/10], followed by extensive press coverage) reports the seizure of two kouroi recovered in restorable fragments from antiquities' thieves in the village of Klenia near Chiliomodi. The statues are now held in the National Archaeological Museum. Kouros A is 1.82m high and kouros B 1.78m high. Both are of marble and were probably made by the same craftsman. A date in the third quarter of the sixth century is tentatively proposed. Subsequent rescue excavation by the 37th EPCA at the reported find-spot has so far revealed the right foot and part of the base of kouros A and the right foot of kouros B. Nearby are two sarcophagi (on the basis of size, one for a male burial and the other, 1.6m long, for a woman) containing pottery and, in the case of the 'female' burial, iron dress pins. Among the pottery is a kylix of the third quarter of the sixth century BC ( ca . 530-510). Nemea, Sanctuary of Zeus. K. Shelton (ASCSA/Berkeley) reports on activity in 2009. Museum study (directed by S. Miller) focused on skeletal material from Early Christian burials around the sanctuary, with samples taken for analysis of diet, environment and health status. Reconstruction of the Temple of Zeus focused on the foundations and krepis at the east end, especially the northeast corner. Finishing on columns K-29 and K-28 was completed following the installation of their capitals. The 13 drums for column K-27 were completed and installed on the temple, along with the capital. Surface finishing of K-27 continues, while the epistyle blocks to span K-30 to K-26 are being patched. A study of structural issues concerning the stadium tunnel and of the necessary conservation protocol was conducted by K. Zambas. Kleonai. T. Mattern (DAI/Marburg) and K. Kissas (Director, 37th EPCA) report on the 2009 survey season. Areas identified as survey targets from EPCA archives were systematically visited. Numerous new find locations were mapped, providing both a view of the settlement history of the valley and information to assist in coordinating the protection of archaeological monuments. In the Daliani area east of Ag. Vasileios, localized concentrations of well-preserved early</page><page sequence="26">26 CATHERINE MORGAN pottery were found on the edge of a scattered ancient settlement. In conjunction with known older Geometric pottery, this confirms early settlement. Near the Ag. Vasileios railway crossing, a concentration of coarseware and roof tile where a Hellenistic mosaic was previously reported indicates extensive building. A further site with large-scale Hellenistic(?) architecture lies west of Ag. Vasileios: column fragments and clear concentrations of pottery were recorded. The site is probably an extramural sanctuary. New finds immediately outside the ancient city include a grave built of spolia, the gravestone of [Ar]istokrito[s] and two joining fragments from the coffers of a (funerary?) aedicule (Fig. 25). Parts of the city wall were documented in the east and north, in the latter case with foundations of a tower. Pottery and roof tile concentrations indicate late antique and Early Byzantine farms. 25.

Banaka-Dimaki (Director, 4th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 193) on assessment of an agricultural holding following a request to build in an area of known archaeological interest beside the Sterna-Lyrkeia road, close to the acropolis of Orneai. Two caves were found on the hill of Daouli or Polemistres. The entrance to the larger was closed with an Ottoman wall within which were two rows of crenels; much of the interior was occupied with three rows of unworked stones and brick. The second cave, slightly higher up, contained a well. These remains, plus the local toponym Braibi, attest to the passage through this area of Ibraim during his Peloponnesian campaign in 1825. On the hill of Ag. Nikolaos (Tsolor), where the road runs parallel to the Inachos river, one of the pillars of the Hadrianic acqueduct was cleaned. A few metres west of the hill at Pleta, a large mortarium was found in the olive grove of A. Nassi. Mycenae. S. Iakovides (ASA) reports ( Ergon [2009], 29- 32) on continued excavation in the lower city and on a geophysical survey of the area. Hellenistic structures were oriented towards the Hellenistic theatre. A thick layer of reddish-brown soil separated the Hellenistic and Archaic remains from the Mycenaean and Geometric beneath. At the northwest edge of the excavation area, an originally round, thick- walled structure was transformed into an apsidal building by the addition of side walls. Inside were stones, unfired bricks and tiles, plus Hellenistic sherds which date the use of the structure as a cistern or well. To the west was a round stone hearth, preserving material from its use- phases including ash, charcoal, animal bone, burnt olive pits, Mycenaean figurines, sherds and a small clay disc. Middle Helladic, Geometric and Archaic sherds were also found. Building remains south of the well included a main wall (12m long), to the west of which were Mycenaean sherds, figurine fragments, a half-finished sealstone, stone tools and two iron arrowheads. Ninth-century tombs immediately to the east postdate the wall. Another wall runs north-south through the centre of the excavation area and is preserved to a height of 1.8m at the north end. A Mycenaean date is confirmed by artefacts found beneath it. Excavation in the south of the area continued to expose a long, narrow building (10m long x 1.8m wide), oriented east-west and partitioned into two rooms of unequal size. Fragments of ivory objects and animal bone were found in the west room, and in the east (which is divided into two smaller areas) were stone tools, stone sling-shot, an animal figurine, pithos and cooking vessel sherds, and animal bone. Pottery was mostly Mycenaean with some Corinthian. To the north of the long building, continuation of the 2008 excavation revealed three or four rooms. In the east room were figurines, a bead, animal bones and pottery of several periods. In the northernmost room were two child burials in small pits under the floor. One, with a slab cover, contained a one to two year-old and four beads, and the other the skeletons of two infants without goods. Small finds included Mycenaean figurine fragments, obsidian and flint, fragments of stone vessels, coins, lead sheet, iron nails, arrowheads and hooks, ivory objects, terracotta loomweights, pieces of plaster and wall- painting, pigments, animal bone, shell, much pottery and tile, cereal grains, and grape and olive pits. Geophysical prospection over a large area of the east bank of the Chavos located the walls of a large building complex for future investigation. Argos Publication: E. Protonotariou-Deilaki, Oi tuijPoi rou 'Apyous (Athens 2009). Aspls. G. Touchais (EfA/Paris 1) and A. Philippa- Touchais (EfA) report on continuing consolidation of structures in the Middle Helladic settlement, which has improved the legibility and protection of remains in the eastern sector. Continued study of pottery and faunal remains focused on three assemblages: the burial of an adolescent recovered among the fragments of a pithos; the enchytrismos of a newborn baby in a jar covered by a Minyan bowl; and a deposit of burnt, broken and compacted pottery in a cavity in the rock.</page><page sequence="27">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 27 S. Fachard (ESAG) reports on the first season of work to locate the remains of the post-prehistoric fortification, its curtain walls, towers and bastions. Apart from the Middle Helladic fortification wall, two further phases of construction can be restored, the second of which corre- sponds with a reconstruction at the end of the fourth or early third century BC, which is recognizable by the high- quality polygonal masonry used (Fig. 26). Many forms of repair can be observed: curtain walls were rebuilt, towers added, and a long triangular bastion projecting from the circuit wall added in the northeast (Fig. 27). 26. Argos, Aspis: polygonal face of wall. 27. Argos, Aspis: triangular bastion. Basileos Georgiou and Nikitara Streets (D. Roubeka property). A. Banaka-Dimaki reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 163) on rescue excavation in the southern part of this plot, east of Ag. Petros square in the centre of Argos. A Hellenistic house (oriented northwest-southeast) had at least two rooms and two probable storage areas. The walls were of unworked stones bound with clay and the floors of red-brown clay spread over a layer of river pebbles. West of the house, a section of ancient road constructed of cobbles and tile was disturbed by Byzantine intrusions. The south edge of the exterior house wall curves to accommodate the eastwards turn of the road. The house was founded in riverine fill containing Geometric pottery and a few Archaic Argive figurine fragments. A similar history of activity is indicated by previous excavations in the wider area, on the Bertzeletou (BCH11 [1953], 211), Flessa ( ADelt 16 [1960] Chr. , 93), Alexopoulou and Katsarou (ADelt 17 [1961-1962] Chr , 55-56) and Paraskevopoulou properties, and for the OTE building (ADelt 21 [1966] Chr , 126-27). Thus finds from the property of A. Bertzeletou, ca. 110-20m north of the Roubeka property, include architectural remains of the end of the fourth to the first half of the third century (cf. BCH 78 [1954], 410-26, esp. 423). Parodos Gounari 116 (E. Sklere property). A. Banaka- Dimaki reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 163-65) the discovery of Hellenistic and Roman building remains closely similar to those previously found on the neigh- bouring property of D. Sklere (ADelt 50 [1995] Chr, 94-96). Immediately beneath surface levels were pottery and architectural remains from a Roman house. Below this, Hellenistic figurine moulds were used alongside unworked stones, tile and clay in the construction of a small wall. Mould fragments were also found in the east of the plot, below a Roman room. Kilns and evidence for coroplastic workshops have previously been discovered nearby (e.g. on the property of E. and D. Antonopoulos and S. Gkofa: ADelt 4 9 [1994] Chr, 141). In the northeastern part of the excavation area, the fill of a pit (1.6m in diameter) contained evidence of burning, stones, tile, domestic pottery of the second to the first half of the first century BC and pieces of a destroyed clay floor. The pit was probably an abortive kiln construction later used as a dump: a smaller construction (0.7m in diameter) slightly to the south was similarly re-used. Fragmentary clay plaques, lumps of clay and stone, and pieces of a lekanis confirm the identification of a workshop in this area. Part of a storage pithos containing carbonized seeds (probably grain) was also found. Close to the eastern boundary of the plot was a deposit of brown earth with fat, charcoal and other traces of burning, and, inter alia, fragments of Argive figurines and moulds, spools, glass paste, burnt clay and pieces of bronze. More general evidence for the use of the area in the Hellenistic period includes some 40 loomweights, mostly of the conical types XIV and XII (250-146 BC) with two examples of type VII (fourth century BC), plus 20 spools, many decorated with an incised circle or stamped rosette. A Geometric pithos burial, closed with a small stone plaque, was found in the northeastern part of the plot: the only grave offering was a pin. Scattered Geometric sherds were found in deeper levels. Paliopyrga, Kanaris Street (E. Kourou property). A. Banaka-Dimaki reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 165-66) on rescue excavation in an area of the south of the city where tombs have previously been found close to the surface (see ADelt 47 [1992] Chr, 86-87, nn.5-6). Protogeometric, Geometric, Late Classical to Hellenistic and Early Roman remains were recovered from surface levels. To the west, three cist tombs with tile covers were discovered; beneath them was a limestone funerary peribolos, oriented east-west and founded almost</page><page sequence="28">28 CATHERINE MORGAN directly upon Geometric tombs. The two Late Classical to Early Hellenistic tombs within this peribolos contained fragmentary figurines, two lamps and sea shell. In the south, two walls defined an orthogonal area extending beyond the excavation plot. Twenty nine cist tombs were investigated. The limestone cist 1 is dated to the Hellenistic to Early Roman period, while the other tombs were mostly Protogeometric and Geometric: Submycenaean tomb 11 (Fig. 28) is an exception, although tombs of this period have previously been found to the north (on the property of N. Kourou: ADelt 18 [1963] Chr, 62). Tombs 7, 14-16, and then 11 and 20 were arranged in rows, sometimes sharing a common wall: the remainder were loosely arranged. All contained adult burials, apart from 16 and 20 which held infants. Flooring consisted of gravel or small stones; the west part of tomb 22 was paved. The predominantly east- west orientation reflects the landscaping of the approach to the cemetery, which also influenced the arrangement of the peribolos and of the limestone cist tomb 1. A well (lm in diameter) in the eastern part of the excavation area contained a little undiagnostic pottery and part of a pithos rim. Portable finds include fragments of Archaic Argive figurines, a very few Corinthian sherds, a small quantity of blister ware, pieces of third-century black-glazed lamps, spools and a few loomweights. Regional General Hospital. A. Papadimitriou (4th EPCA) reports ( ADelt 55 (2000) Chr , 166-68) on rescue excavation prior to the construction of an extension south of the 1960s hospital building. A dense concentration of 24 tombs, oriented southwest-northeast, was found in the southern and eastern parts of the excavation area. These were either built of limestone orthostates and covered with similar slabs or tiles, or were simple pits, with or without covers, and used for more than one interment. Their use extended from the Late Archaic/Early Classical to the Late Hellenistic period. Three limestone tombs belong to the same group, as well as four pyres located north of this nucleus in the central part of the plot. North and west of this tomb group, in the centre of the excavation area, 32 Late Middle Helladic tombs were loosely arranged over an area of ca. 280m2. These conform to known types of the period, i.e. cists of roughly- cut limestone blocks with similar covers, pithoi and other vessels, and pits with or without a clay lining. Tombs normally contained single inhumations with grave goods. West of the Middle Helladic tombs, a row of seven Geometric cist tombs was aligned north-northeast-south- southwest; each contained a single burial and rich goods. Beneath them was a surface of river pebbles ( ca . 160m2). Three stone cairns occupied a confined area north of the Middle Helladic tombs and partially covered the Geometric tombs. Some 80-90% of the pottery collected from these cairns dates to the Late Middle Helladic, with a small quantity contemporary with the use of the cist tombs. It is therefore likely that the cairns re-used material after the demolition of a Late Middle Helladic structure, a terminus post quern for which is provided by the Geometric use of the area. They probably formed part of a tumulus covering the Middle Helladic graves which was removed in the Late Archaic to Early Classical period when the area was landscaped for cemetery use. 28. Argos, Paliopyrga, Kanaris Street: tomb 11. In the west and south of the plot were the successive Late Middle Helladic and Early Mycenaean surfaces of a cobbled road. This road (at least 5m wide) was a main artery which formed the boundary between the extensive Mycenaean settlement on the Aspis slopes and the cemetery to the east. It had fallen into disuse by the Geometric period (one of the tombs noted above cuts into it). A row of six limestone blocks in two courses follows the line of the road and forms an angle with the tombs of the historical period: it likely marked the entrance to the cemetery in historical times. A pit in the northern part of the excavation area contained spolia from the superstructure of the later tombs. No further ancient remains were found. It therefore seems that the area was used exclusively for burials in three distinct periods: Late Middle Helladic, Geometric and Early Classical to Late Hellenistic. The arterial road was also a boundary in later times. The area east of it was used for burials, but not as a unitary, organized cemetery. While planned cemeteries were common at other large urban centres, the only example at Argos is located at the modern National Gymasium, on the ancient road running southwest towards Tegea. The hospital site, which borders the ancient road north to Mycenae and Corinth, was used for the burial of small groups over time, perhaps by one genos or extended family. Previous excavations in the area confirm this view: a comparable group of prehistoric and later tombs was found during excavation for the founda- tions of the 1960s hospital building some 60m away. During the Late Hellenistic and Early Roman periods, groups of tombs within periboloi, found north and south of this building on the Roussopoulos and Pitsas plots, indicate a shift towards the eastern road from the city.</page><page sequence="29">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 29 48 Korinthou Street (E. Smyrnaiou property). A. Papadimitriou (4th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 168-72) the results of excavation in preparation for the construction of a basement (Fig. 29). Three walls of roughly -worked limestone blocks were discovered ca. 1.8-1. 85m below the modern road surface. Concentrations of blocks were also found at various points to the north and south of these walls. In the western part of the plot was a hearth oriented east-west. Immediately to the southeast, clay moulds were found in a level containing much ash and burnt clay. Along the central axis of the plot were stone containers, roughly worked on the outside but excep- tionally well finished on the interior and upper surface, covered with large limestone slabs. Container 1 (oriented north-south) was empty. A further container exactly to the east of this was not investigated because it lay on the boundary with the neighbouring property. Container 2, the third from the east, contained at least 60 bronze and two lead inscribed tablets (Fig. 30). Container 3, fourth from the east, was empty. Container 4, second from the east, 29. Argos, 48 Korinthou Street: excavation plan, upper levels. 30. Argos, 48 Korinthou Street: stone container 2 with inscribed tablets. contained one foot-shaped inscribed tablet. West of the containers and at a lower level, a further slab of the same dimensions and orientation covered two vessels (Figs. 31, 32): a ceramic bell krater contained ca. 55 bronze tablets placed around the vessel wall (as were those in container 2) and a hammered bronze lebes contained three bronze vessels (a trefoil-mouthed oinochoe and two phialae) below which lay very poorly-preserved bronze tablets. A part of this collection had been removed in such a way as to cause damage to the remainder. In the eastern part of the plot, five pottery vessels were set upright. Four were covered with terracotta roof tiles and the fifth with a thin limestone slab: all were empty. The vessels are all wheelmade and of the highest quality: four are closed shapes and the fifth a bell krater. North of these vessels and at a slightly deeper level was a well- made floor of small cobbles extending over the entire area investigated (its edges were not located). This floor surrounded the pots on the southern edge of the plot as well as the vessels under cover slab 5, and was slightly damaged by container 2. At the eastern edge of the plot, by container 2, the pavement fabric slowly shifts towards gravel. Below the pebble floor in the south and west were two Geometric tombs, one a built cist and the other a pit with a limestone cover slab. Both were oriented east-west and richly equipped with Middle Geometric pottery, iron pins and bronze rings. In sum, the stratigraphical sequence indicates an initial occupation in Middle Helladic. In the Middle Geometric period the area was a cemetery, and perhaps an aristocratic one: a well-made floor surrounded at least two rich tombs. Some while later, two vessels containing bronze tablets were sunk into the Geometric layer and covered with a slab. At the same time, a further six vessels at least were inserted slightly to the east. At some time after its deposition, the cover slab was lifted and part of the vessel contents forcibly removed, damaging the remainder. Later, a flood deposited ca. lm of fill over the area. Thereafter, the five built containers were constructed and a hearth built immediately west of the cover slab. The terracotta moulds south of the hearth indicate its function: they closely resemble in form the bronze plaques, and both hearth and moulds must be contemporary with the containers, stone mounds, etc. The flood, dated to the fourth century, likely destroyed the Geometric settlement around the tombs. The area then fell into disuse.</page><page sequence="30">30 CATHERINE MORGAN 31. Argos, 48 Korinthou Street: excavation plan, upper levels. 32. Argos, 48 Korinthou Street: ceramic and bronze vessels containing inscribed tablets. Papanikolaou Street (G. Rebelou property). K. Barakari-Gleni (4th EPCA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 172-74) the completion in 1999-2000 of the excavation of a shrine area begun in 1998 (ADelt 53 [1998] Chr , 125-28). East of the central open area, a votive deposit outside and along the west side of area A contained some 30 Archaic offerings - figurines, spools, a terracotta bead and pottery (kraters, skyphoi and votive miniatures). To the south, a small pit covered with stones contained animal bones and strong traces of burning. In the southern part of the central open area, an altar (0.4-0.42m in diameter) cut into a clay platform contained burnt organic material, figurines and miniature vessels. In area B, west of the central open area, a round pit contained sherds of large Late Geometric and Argive monochrome vessels, animal bones and evidence of burning. Two votive deposits contained figurines and traces of burning. At the west of the plot were two tile- covered graves which probably held child burials, as well as further walls. Levels corresponding to those in the central area and area B produced Attic black-glazed and Corinthian sherds (including one semi-restorable amphora of late fifth- to early fourth-century type), loomweights, spools and a bronze arrowhead. Southeast of area A, in the middle of the eastern side of the excavation area, a Geometric tomb lay beneath a tumulus with a double peribolos wall of river stones and a pebble floor. The tomb (oriented east-west) contained Geometric pottery, traces of burning and bone. Sherds of a figured LGII krater were collected from the east side of the tumulus. A post-Byzantine wall, built of stones from the tumulus, abuts it on the east side. Northeast of the tumulus, a semicircular structure of worked limestone blocks (0.95m in diameter, 0.45m deep) again incorporates stones probably from the tumulus in its lowest course: figurine fragments and burnt material were found between the blocks. In a deeper level were sherds of sixth- and fifth-century pithoi and lekanes, bones and traces of burning. North of the tumulus was a votive deposit of the Hellenistic period. In the northeastern section were two enchytrismoi of infants, one in an Archaic vessel and the other in a Geometric krater. Southwest of these burials, roughly worked stones covered a pit (lm in diameter, at least 2.9m deep) containing burnt material and bone towards the bottom. The altar in the middle of the open area was completely excavated. This was cut in a clay platform set into a layer with Geometric sherds; the fill inside it contained Archaic sherds and strong traces of burning. Finds from the excavation as a whole indicate that the area was used for cult from the eighth century onwards, reaching a peak in the sixth century. The deity worshipped is unknown. The Geometric tumulus is the second of this period discovered in Argos, the first being in the stadium area in the southwest, outside the walls. Papanikoli Street (O.T. T213, K. Beleri property). A. Bakourou and G. Tsekes (5th EBA) report ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 261) on discoveries in an area with important Late Roman to Early Christian remains (e.g. an Early Christian basilica on the Phlorou plot on Arkadia- Messenia Streets and a Late Roman villa on the Kechagia plot on Theatre Lane). An Early Christian house or small workshop lies in the east of the plot and extends beyond it. To the west was a small kiln and part of a round basin. Walls of a bath in the west of the plot were built of alternating brick and stone with plaster; marble revetment was preserved in one case. The entrance to the hypocaust is at the northeast. Three further walls of brick on a stone foundation likely mark the passageway surrounding the caldarium.</page><page sequence="31">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 31 Argos, north cemetery. A. Bakourou and G. Tsekes report (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 261-62) on excavation on two adjoining properties on Diomedes Lane. O.T. 141", A. Denezi and E. Tedzeri property. A further 15 graves were added to the 35 previously excavated (see ADelt 54 [1999] Chr , 223). Of this total of 50, only the pithos burial 50 (set deep in the early pebble layer, oriented east-west and with a stone cover slab) is Geometric in date. This contains one contracted inhumation without grave goods. The remaining tombs were all tile graves of extremely similar construction. Grave goods were few or non-existent: the only exception, tomb 14 (the burial of a young girl), contained a pair of earrings. Infant and child burials account for ca. 20% of the total. The fill between graves to 2.5m deep consists of soft red-brown soil with Geometric, Hellenistic and Roman sherds, and from 2.5-3. 4m deep of river pebbles. A few Geometric and Hellenistic sherds in some tombs were probably therefore intrusive. The existence of two layers of tombs and the large area covered underline the longevity of the cemetery. Immediately to the south lies the property of G. Dedousi, E. Kirsanof, G. Karakitsou and I. Kotronaki (O.T. 140- Here, 64 tombs were opened, of which two Geometric pithos burials (35 and 37) lie in the pebble layer. Twenty three graves contained child burials: of these, tomb 6 contained a pair of bronze earrings, tomb 42 a gold hoop earring, an iron dagger and a probable bronze pin, and tomb 28 a coarseware cup. Double child burials occurred in tombs 3, 31, 61 and 64. All of the Byzantine tombs were near-identical tile graves; the only minor variation occurred in tomb 26, which had four-sided terracotta plaques instead of tiles. The first layer of Byzantine tombs likely destroyed pre- Christian tombs beneath, noting Geometric to Hellenistic sherds in the fill of the Geometric graves: the earring in tomb 42 suggests that offerings from older tombs were re- used. In the western part of the plot was a trapezoidal under- ground structure which may be an Early Christian baptistery, later levelled and used as part of the cemetery. Tomb 46 lay inside it, and tombs 47 and 48 above the demolished south wall. The exterior face was of unworked field-stones, while the interior was well finished with white hydraulic cement. In the centre was a four-sided basin with quatrefoils at each corner. Kallergi Street (O.T. 159, A. Roussou property). A. Bakourou and G. Tsekes report {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 262-63) on rescue excavation begun in 1999. An Early Christian house was found in the north of the plot. In the northeast were further probable house walls and, inside, small pieces of red plaster: in the west of this room was a terracotta tiled floor and beneath it a cobbled floor which extended across the greater part of the neigh- bouring trenches. A well of terracotta cylinders, probably built in the Roman period, was used at least into Early Christian times. Further south was a destruction level with a cannon ball in a layer of ash. A building of large well-worked limestone blocks lay deep below this. A cobbled road running east-west (8m long, maximum preserved width 6.5m) had a succession of surfaces over a long period of use: a water channel ran along the middle of this road and a smaller spur channel connected the house to it. E. Roussou Street (M. Rapti and G. Apostolou property). E. Sarri (4th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 174-78) on excavation just south of the Capodistrian barracks. Successive Hellenistic and Roman phases of a cobbled road with a system of water channels were revealed in the northwest of the plot. Below, a third road was bounded by two walls and a limestone TT-shaped peribolos of the second half of the second century BC. A fourth, deeper, road on the same orientation abuts a construction to the south which was destroyed by the retaining walls of the overlying road. Two groups of Christian and Hellenistic tombs lie beneath the level of the TT-shaped peribolos. The first group, towards the centre of the plot, consists of two cists (I and III) and a sarcophagus (II) oriented east-west and with cover slabs: all are family tombs. Tomb 1 contained two burials oriented east-west, with imported pottery dated ca. 490-470 BC. Attic vessels comprise a black-glazed pinch-base cup-skyphos with a chariot scene, a floral palmette lekythos by the Megaira Painter, a black-figure chimney lekythos depicting Athena and a chariot, a band cup with riders, a shallow skyphos with satyrs, a floral band cup, a lekythos of the Class of Athens 581 I and three black-glazed Type C cups. Corinthian imports are a globular pyxis and lid, a skyphos and a thilastron. Tomb III contained two burials as above. Offerings comprise a black-glazed skyphos with stamp decoration (second quarter of the fourth century), a squat lekythos with impressed floral decoration, five figurines (mostly Argive peplophoroi), a Corinthian pyxis lid and a black- glazed cup-skyphos with stamped decoration (first quarter of the fourth century), three Argive pyxides, a squat lekythos and three bolsals. Tomb II, a sarcophagus (with the raised head-rest characteristic of local tombs of the first half of the third century) contained a female interment, plus the displaced remains of two earlier burials. Offerings in the last burial were a bronze mirror and lid, and three Argive alabastra (plus a fourth from an earlier burial) deliberately broken and placed in different parts of the sarcophagus. Between the bones of the earlier burials was an unguentarium of the first half of the third century. Two Argive handmade figurines on the floor of the sarcophagus should also be associated with these burials. Between tombs I and III was a disturbed female burial of the second half of the fifth century, close to which lay the disc of a bronze mirror, five Attic vessels (a Type B Glaux skyphos, a floral palmette lekythos, a black-glazed kylix of the Acropolis Group, a Cracow Class cup-skyphos and a Corinthian-type skyphos) and three Corinthian (two globular white-style pyxides with lids, and a skyphos). Tomb II disturbed two burials set partially under the peribolos. One, to the west, contained a bronze strigil, two handmade Argive figurines (a dove and a horse and rider) and a miniature kotyle. Pottery from the same layer includes two intact lids, a small Argive skyphos, part of a Vrysoula Workshop globular pyxis of the third quarter of the fifth century, black-glazed pottery of the same period (two Attic skyphoi of Corinthian type, an Attic one- handler, a kylix and Rheneia cup, and an Argive kylix) and seven Attic Vicups. The second tomb lay to the northeast, within a layer containing Middle Corinthian to LCorl pottery, including an amphora, a white-style globular pyxis and part of a kylix.</page><page sequence="32">32 CATHERINE MORGAN West of this group, tile grave IV contained a skeleton oriented north-south, beneath which were iron nails; Late Geometric to Archaic sherds and an Archaic Argive kantharos lay above the cover tiles. Pit grave IX, covered with two rough limestone slabs, contained a skeleton oriented north-south. The second tomb group, in the eastern part of the plot, contained four limestone cists oriented north-south. Their long sides were monolithic. Only the northern part of tomb V and the southern part of tomb VII were preserved: both had been robbed (V contained a little bone and many Hellenistic sherds). Tombs VI and VIII mostly fell within the neighbouring plot. The earliest remains discovered are the cist graves XI and XII (oriented east-west) and pithos burial X (oriented north-south). Tomb X contained a single burial without goods. Tomb XI contained a few bones plus fragments of four Geometric kyathoi. Tomb XII was damaged by the digger, but by its side were a Late Geometric krater of the Fence Workshop (Fig. 33) and a contemporary kantharos. Many Late Geometric sherds were collected in the course of cleaning this side of the tomb, including fragments of two kraters, an amphora and an oinochoe. 33. Argos, E. Roussou Street: LGII krater of the Fence Workshop. P. Marinou Street (Th. Apostolopoulou property). O. Psychoyiou (4th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 178-81) the excavation of a Hellenistic to Roman weaver's workshop on the northeast side of Ag. Petros Square, outside the ancient city walls (Fig. 34). This plot lies immediately north of the property of Ch. and G. Bousi where part of a late fourth/early third-century BC to first- century AD street was previously discovered {ADelt 47 [1992] Chr , 85-86). The complex had at least three Hellenistic to Early Roman phases: a pebble pavement of an exterior courtyard was largely excavated and the neighbouring spaces partially explored. The earliest, fourth-century BC, building was founded in riverine deposits containing much Geometric and Archaic pottery. Remains comprise an early phase of the paved court and, on its north side, a semi-open space beside a gravel floor. To the northeast, the pavement connects with a semi-basement room reached by steps in the north wall. This room contained much household pottery, millstones and stone tools, slag and charcoal, shellfish, fragments of terracotta figurines, coins and a variety of metal objects. In the western part of the plot was an enchytrismos of an infant in a Hellenistic skyphos. During the second phase, the pebble paving again borders semi-basement rooms to the norht and west. Two kilns on the northwest side of the excavation area also date to this phase. During the third phase (second century BC), the pebble pavement was relaid: in places it suffered later damage and parts of the surface were replaced with worked slabs. One group of six such slabs set in water- proof cement likely relates to an ancient well or cistern: a terracotta water channel runs from the east end of these slabs to join another conduit continuing east beyond the excavation area. To the north is a long, partially-roofed space (area 2) with many tile fragments on its clay floor: a stone wall or barrier divides it from the paved court. A probable door in its north wall leads into another room further north with a clay floor and a semicircular hearth. A further building of the third phase of construction continues into the neighbouring plots on the south and west (only the southeast portion of the north room is preserved, with a schist-paved floor). The corner of a building traced in the northwest corner of the excavation may belong to its extension, but in general the area is too disturbed to assess the relationship between the semi- roofed area and subsequent constructions, although spolia indicate continuous use of the area. Portable finds include some 190 loomweights of different shapes and sizes, found mainly in the semi-roofed area, as well as spools, bronze coins, a variety of metal objects, sherds of relief bowls and terracotta figurines. Herakleous Street (E. Nanopoulou property). E. Pappi (4th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 181-82) the discovery of a planned Late Middle Helladic cemetery in the northwest of Argos. Eleven tombs were investigated, arranged in two rows cut directly into riverine deposits. These are simple pits or pits with clay lining, generally defined with cobblestones. Each contained a single burial in contracted position, in seven instances without grave goods and in four with the usual offerings of cut-away necked prochoes, one-handled kyathoi and kantharoid skyphoi. Tomb 11, in the north of the plot - a cist of limestone orthostates covered by limestone slabs - contained a burial in extended position, with a bronze knife by the sternum, a second by the right shoulder and a bronze pin at the left shoulder. A bronze tongue- bladed knife lay among bones from a previous burial. In the southwest, a Hellenistic building with walls of roughly-worked stones was preserved to ca. 0.5-0. 7m high. Hellenistic activity was largely responsible for disturbance to the Middle Helladic tombs. Belinou-Zografou Street (M. Grammatikou property). E. Pappi reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 182) on rescue excavation in a plot in the centre of Argos, northwest of Stratonon Square. An Archaic level contained pottery, a few miniature vessels (mostly phialae), and human and animal figurines. No building remains were found, probably due to the small area excavated. On the north- eastern boundary of the plot, a built cist grave, probably of Geometric date and oriented north-south, contained a single inhumation with the cranium to the north. The deceased had a bronze pin on each shoulder and wore a bronze ring.</page><page sequence="33">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 33 34. Argos, P. Marinou Street: general view of the excavation. Makariou Street (K. Ioannides property). E. Pappi reports ( ADelt55 [2000] Chr , 182) the discovery of part of a Hellenistic cobbled road running northeast-southwest, with a probable ancient boundary stone above it (a stone base with a socket survives). A Hellenistic wall running north-south is not associated with the road. Two probably Geometric cist tombs at the northern edge of the plot (oriented north-south and east- west) were not investigated. Aigaiou Pelagous Street, Kapodistriou Lane (O.T. 24, G. Ksakousti and G. Ksabla property). Ch. Piteros (Director, 4th EPCA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 182- 83) on further excavation of this plot, immediately northeast of the Cultural Centre of Argos. Previous rescue excavation had revealed an ancient road-bed along the north side {ADelt 46 [1991] Chr , 102). Excavation in 2000, again in the north, uncovered black earth, ash and kiln debris, plus Byzantine fill. Beneath this was an ancient road with three construction phases and, in the lowest levels, silt deposits. The bronze balance rod of a pair of Early Byzantine scales was found in a Late Roman well. Kalmouchou Street (O.T. 19, A. and I. Boulmeti property). Ch. Piteros reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 183-84) on the continuation of excavation in the south- eastern part of the plot begun in 1998-1999 ( cf ADelt 54 [1999] Chr, 137-39). Foundations of small Hellenistic buildings and a well (0.8m in diameter) were found with sherds of Hellenistic black-glazed and household wares, amphorae, moulded bowls, Laconian roof tiles, figurine fragments, a lamp and bronze coins, plus a few Classical and Archaic sherds. In deeper levels, Geometric and Late Geometric burial pithoi were set into riverine sediments. Pithos 6 was disturbed and lacked goods. Pithos 7 contained the burials of a child and an infant with a bronze ring and a reported 11 small Geometric vases. In the southeastern corner of the plot was a cist for the burial or reburial of three disturbed adult skeletons and three enchytrismoi in Geometric amphorae: Geometric skyphos sherds were found between the skeletons and the amphorae. Below this, the small burial pithos 11 contained a (probably reburied) adult cranium, with a Geometric skyphos and cup outside. A further cist grave (13) contained the burial of a youth in contracted position without goods. To the north, a large burial pithos (14) with a limestone cover slab was set on its side, oriented north- south. Outside was a large Late Geometric krater and, inside, the burial of an adult in supine position without goods, with the displaced remains of earlier (Late Geometric) burials of an adult and a youth set to one side. Associated with these earlier burials were two fragmentary large kraters and a range of mostly small vessels - a tripod-amphoriskos with elaborate figure decoration, a small prochous, a pomegranate vase, two</page><page sequence="34">34 CATHERINE MORGAN handmade amphoriskoi, two small handmade open vessels, five bronze rings, three bronze pins and two small links, and an iron T-form pin. A Late Geometric seal (Fig. 35) in a reddish-grey stone, depicting a reclining bovine, is probably from the same workshop as an example from Vollgraf's excavation on the Larisa; the base depicts two standing female mourners framed by streamers to left and right. Remains of the funerary feast (animal bones and Late Geometric sherds) were found outside the pithos. Midea. The Greek-Swedish excavation on the Mycenaean acropolis of Midea continued in 2009 under the direction of K. Demakopoulou (Director Emerita, National Museum) with the collaboration of A.-L. Schallin (Director, Swedish Institute at Athens) and N. Divari- Valakou (then 3rd EPCA, now Director, 3rd EPCA, Director of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities, Ministry of Culture and Tourism). The Greek team excavated on the lower west terrace of the acropolis and the Swedish team in the area of the east gate. The Greek team completed investigation of the syrinx through the west section of the fortification wall, discovered in 2007. The area in front of the entrance to the sally port in the inner face of the citadel wall was further cleared, with the removal of a destruction deposit next to the north jamb containing rubble, large stones and boulders fallen from the fortification wall. The removal of this deposit revealed bedrock in much of the area sloping down to the syrinx. This is cut vertically at the east and south sides, forming a rectangular shaft in front of the opening of the sally port. Piles of stones probably come from ruined steps leading to the entrance. The remains of a stone pavement belong to a north-south path approaching the sally port. The interior of the sally port was investigated for 4.52m, and fill ca. 0.9-lm deep removed (Fig. 36). The syrinx is a passageway running east-west obliquely through the fortification wall, which at this point is 5.7m thick. The side walls are built of boulders founded on a layer of hard soil, small stones and pebbles. This layer is 0.55m deep by the entrance and gradually diminishes to 0.15-0.1m in the middle of the syrinx. The side walls curve slightly inward towards the top, while the roof is mostly covered with horizontal stone slabs. The floor, of levelled bedrock, slopes continuously with shallow steps at several points. The sally port is 1.4m high and 0.6m wide near the entrance, gradually reducing to 0.8m high and 0.45m wide as the passage runs deeper. Near the deepest point reached before the excavation was halted for safety reasons, the roof is lowered following the incli- nation of the floor, while the passage is so narrow as to be impassible. This is an effect of the devastating earthquake that hit Midea at the end of the 13th century BC, as evident in the distorted and tilted side walls and the fallen stones from the walls and the roof. In order to find the exit, some 1.2m outside the fortification wall, excavation continued in the three adjacent trenches opened in 2007 against the outer face of the wall. A large part of the outer face of the wall was exposed for a length of 10m and to a height of 3m. Examination of the exposed wall surface revealed that the construction of this section differed from that of most of the citadel wall and of the inner face of this part of the wall. Instead of boulders and large stones, medium-sized stones were used, with some boulders only in the lower part. Most of the outer face of the wall, plus part of the syrinx including the exit, collapsed or was severely damaged in the earthquake (noting many boulders and large stones in this area appar- ently from the collapsed section of the wall), and the wall 35.

Midea: interior of the sally port through the west section of the fortification wall. face was rebuilt in LHIIICE and the sally port blocked. This work coincides with the construction of room I against the inner face of the wall, near the entrance to the sally port. At the same time the megaron complex on the lower terraces, which was also destroyed by earthquake, was largely repaired. A substantial programme of repair and rebuilding was therefore initiated on the lower terraces of the acropolis following the destruction. The fill of the part of the sally port excavated this season was a dark, rather loose soil containing large and small stones, rubble and pebbles. A considerable quantity of mostly LHIIIB2 sherds was recovered. More abundant, and also fragmentary, pottery of the same date comes from the destruction deposit excavated near and in front of the entrance to the sally port. It is noteworthy that LHIIICE and M as well as Early Mycenaean and Middle Helladic sherds were found both in the fill of the sally port and in the destruction deposit, and that there were many joins between sherds from these two areas. The commonest shape among the LHIIIB2 decorated pottery is the deep bowl (of all types, with Group A predominating). Stemmed bowls (some monochrome) are abundant (Fig. 37); many stems of this shape were found, some trimmed and probably used as lids. Kraters and mugs also occur. A fine semi-globular bowl, partly restored from many sherds, is banded in and out with a fringe of joining semicircles on the exterior rim. Also abundant are closed shapes, such as jugs, amphorae and hydriae, stirrup and collar-necked jars and alabastra. Plainware examples include conical and carinated kylikes, deep bowls, mugs, dippers, shallow angular bowls, basins and jugs. Numerous stirrup jar sherds are decorated mostly with stylized octopus tentacles. One of two non- joining sherds of another stirrup jar of this type preserves a trace of a Linear B sign. The coarseware recovered includes many sherds of pithoi and other storage vessels. There are also cooking vessels, including some in a fabric containing silver or gold mica, plus sherds of handmade burnished-ware jars. A few stray LHIIIC sherds were found inside the sally port and in the destruction deposit. To LHIIICE belong sherds of kraters coated inside, and a fragment of an amphoriskos or collar-necked jar decorated with hooked stems. A large part of a shallow angular bowl with linear decoration dates to LHIIICM. Early Mycenaean sherds in both deposits include a number of LHIIA-B, mostly from Vapheio cups. The plentiful Middle Helladic sherds found in both deposits are of grey and black Minyan and matt- painted ware. Other finds from both deposits are fragmentary terra- cotta human and animal figurines and a part of a throne model, the rim of a lead vessel, a fragmentary bronze pin, fragments of stone tools, blades and flakes of obsidian and flint, pieces of fluorite, mother-of-pearl and ochre, many fragments of painted plaster, as well as animal bones, seashells and carbonized figs. Approximately 20-25m outside the northern section of the citadel wall was a massive Cyclopean terrace wall of boulders. Its north face, preserved to a height of 0.8- 1.1m, was cleared for a length of 30m. This strong retaining wall supported a road leading to the main (east) gate of the acropolis. It is comparable with the retaining walls of Mycenaean highways in the Mycenae and Berbati areas, and with those of the Tiryns-Epidauros highway. This newly-found road connected Midea with areas to the northwest of the acropolis and probably with the highway from Mycenae to Tiryns. Its construction likely coincided with that of the acropolis fortifications. Tiryns. J. Maran (DAI/Heidelberg) reports the completion in 2009 of the documentation and restoration of the ca. 1,000 fresco fragments and fragment groups found by the Archaeological Service near the West Stairs in 1999-2001 (Fig. 38). These finds belong to the same complex as the frescos found in 1910 (e.g. the large procession of women, hunting frieze, deer frieze). Study continues, but prelim- inary results may be noted. In certain cases, analysis of the 37. Midea: LHIIIB2 stemmed bowl.</page><page sequence="36">36 CATHERINE MORGAN 38. Tiryns: find-spots of wall-paintings in the area of the West Stairs. find conditions and contexts on the Tiryns acropolis permits paintings found in secondary debris to be allocated to particular ranges of rooms within the palace, and thus to their original architectural, functional and iconographical context. The large procession of women, of which new fragments could be identified, is such a case. Besides common motifs such as processions (now also identified in small format: Fig.. 39), the new finds expand the known repertoire at Tiryns with the addition of rare motifs such as the image of a female figure apparently holding a smaller figure, which may be connected with a small group of possible figurine depictions on wall- paintings from Mycenae and Tiryns. There are also images of marine creatures apparently drinking from or holding vessels; one of these occurred among the older finds and two among the new. The chronological significance of the new finds is already evident, as they were found in contexts clearly associated with LHIIIB2 ceramics. Thus the majority of the Tiryns paintings are connected with the final architec- tural phase of the palace, and not, as widely assumed, with some earlier phase. The possibility of cross- comparison on the basis of stylistic development is of importance for the relative chronology of Mycenaean wall-painting. Nauplion Venetian defences of Nauplion. Ch. Piteros (4th EPCA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 184-85) the discovery of two sections of the mina (underground defensive passage) along the east face of the fossa of the Venetian walls of Nauplion in the area of Kolokotronis Park (O.T. 100a). This vaulted passage, built of stone with lime plaster, was probably dug as a siege defence during the second period of Venetian rule (1689-1715). Part of it was previously discovered to the south, at the southeast corner of the city lawcourt building at the junction of 25th Martiou and Polyzoidou Streets. The first section was discovered during the opening of a drainage channel along the north side of Vasileios Konstantinou Street at the junction with Polyzoidou Street, 11.35-15m from the southwest corner of the park. This lies 60m east of the early Venetian city wall (on Vasileios Konstantinou Street), between Nikitara Square (and the lawcourts) and Kapodistrias Square. The mina here runs southwest-northeast; the interior west wall is 1.1m wide, the exterior east wall 0.9m wide and the intervening space 1.2m wide. The second section was revealed during trenching for electricity cables along the south side of Sidiras Merarchias Street (which defines the north side of the park). Lying</page><page sequence="37">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 37 39. Tiryns: small-format depiction of female participants in a procession, accompanied by a bird sitting on a palmtree. 31.7m east of the northwest corner of the park and the junction of Polyzoidou and Sidiras Merarchias Streets, a curved structure (oriented north-south) is probably an extension of the line of the mina. A strong wall oriented east-west is likely part of the north Venetian quay outside the east city walls and moat. This wall was traced for 59m west-east towards the northeast edge of the park, and probably continues further north. Its full height and width were not revealed (the latter is estimated at 1.5-2m). Charilaou Trikoupi Street (O.T. 380(3, G. and E. Sagioti property). Ch. Piteros reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 185) discoveries made during the excavation of a basement, north of the road. A probably Venetian stone conduit lined with lime plaster (internally 0.6m high, 0.23m wide, wall depth 0.25-0.3m, oriented northeast-southwest) likely brought drinking water from the Glykeia spring immediately southwest of the hill of Profitis Ilias to the eastern side of Nauplion harbour. Parts of the Venetian conduit (oriented north-south) have previously been located to the east on properties along the west side of Profitis Ilias Street. In the central part of the plot were sherds of household pottery and roof tile but no building remains. A destruction layer included Late Roman (fourth- to fifth- century AD) sherds. See AGOnline for antiquities discovered during the renovation of the Old Parliament Building. Dalamanara, Agios Panteleimon (ancient Temenion), (D. Diamantakou property). Ch. Piteros reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 189-91) on rescue excavation north of the Nauplion-Nea Kios road by the coast at Dalamanaras, 85m southwest of the Church of Ag. Panteleimon and immedi- ately east of a plot investigated in 1994 ( cf ADelt 49 [1994] Chr, 150-51). A Late Roman to Early Byzantine bath complex (Fig. 40), oriented northwest-southeast, extended across almost the entire plot. Part of the main bath was discovered in the west. In the south lay the hypocaust (with terracotta tiles and round support pillars), the caldarium and two small cisterns. Immediately to the north, the tepidarium was divided into two rooms (A2, A3) with walls of stone, brick and lime plaster as used for furnace construction. Vertical airways were built into the walls of A2; the floor is in opus reticulatum. The west space, A3, was later used for a kiln. A terracotta water channel covered with unworked limestone slabs ran along the east side of these rooms. The larger eastern part of the building contained rooms of varying sizes, with tiled floors laid over a substratum of small stones. The floors in what were probably adjunct areas were of beaten earth with local sea pebbles. One such room (B5), a storage area for household and cooking equipment, contained many typical fourth- to fifth-century AD household vessels. Outside the east side of the building was an underground channel. The various rooms and the hypocaust contained roof tiles, bronze coins, glass fragments, Late Roman lamps (third- to fourth-century AD) as well as Early Christian examples of North African type (fourth- to fifth-century AD). In the west part of the building, a hoard of 268 assaria and minimi of the fourth century AD (of the house of Constantine the Great and probably Constantine II) was found in the area of the hypocaust. Cleaning of a small sample revealed the emperor's head on the obverse and, on the reverse, different devices: a fallen rider in a scene of supplication which also includes a further figure with a spear, trees to left and right; a male figure dragging a smaller figure; and the emperor standing with a spear. A small clay prochous was found in the same area, as well as a fourth- to fifth-century AD lamp. In the southern part of the hypocaust (Al) a stone anchor, weighing ca. 20kg, was built into a wall. This complex extends beyond the excavation area to the west and south. Its southeast-northwest orientation differs from the east-west alignment of the large building of the same period discovered on the property formerly belonging to V. Tasopoulos on the north side of the road. A road running northeast-southwest on the west side of the bath evidently separated the two buildings, and formed the approach from the northeast and the Church of Ag. Panteleimon. These buildings form part of ancient Temenion, the harbour of Argos: blocks from the breakwater are visible in the sea to the south. The bath was destroyed in the fifth or more probably the sixth century AD. Lerna. M.H. Weincke (ASCSA) reports on continuing work on a conservation plan for the House of the Tiles and a programme to improve the Lerna display in Argos Museum. Analysis of the stone eaves of the House of the Tiles shows them to be made of a shale or siltstone (chlorite and illite) quarried locally. Kiveri, Hill of Profitis Ilias. Ch. Piteros reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 197-98) the discovery of spolia from an ancient temple within a later building on the top of this hill, 2.28km west of the village of Kiveri. Andritsa. O. Psychoyiou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 194-96) on assessments in seven locations west and northwest of Andritsa, in an area between Mounts Tzouma and Karvya extending to Parthenio in the southeast and up to the south bank of the Potamia river or Xombrio. This area is of interest in relation to the course of the ancient cart road linking Argos with Tegea via Hysiai, the so- called 'Trocho'. Prehistoric to Hellenistic and Byzantine remains were found as follows.</page><page sequence="38">38 CATHERINE MORGAN 40. Dalamanara, Agios Panteleimon (ancient Temenion): plan of the excavation on the Diamantakou property. Elliniko. On the north slopes of Mount Karvya, ca. 100m from the border between the Argolid and Arcadia, are remains of a square stone structure (with walls ca. 10m long) and scattered fragments of Corinthian roof tile. Koukouras. Approximately 500m north-northeast, beneath Elliniko on the same slope, a round stone tower or guard post ( ca . 6.5m in diameter) is preserved as up to three courses of roughly-worked stones. Visibility from this site extends as far as Profitis Ilias, Kiveri to the east and Achladokampo to the west. Palaiochori. On the top of a steep hill (338masl) in the northwest foothills of Mount Karvya are the remains of a round tower of small unworked stones. On the more even southeastern side of the hill are scattered sherds, and pithos and tile fragments. Wheel ruts in the rock and retaining walls indicate a cart road on the west side of the hill, leading from the northern foothills to the summit. Goulas/Kastro. A fortified ancient acropolis (with scattered worked blocks, linear stone foundations, Final Neolithic to Hellenistic sherds, obsidian, etc.) occupies a plateau on top of this hill (323masl). In the middle of the east side, where the approach road ends, the pseudoisodomic wall forms a corner. A larger section of the fortification on the south side of the plateau includes a round tower with two rooms to the east and west. The tower is built in polygonal style of limestone blocks roughly worked on the exterior face and is flanked to the west by a long narrow room with a gate in the southeast corner. The walls of this room are polygonal and pseudoisodomic. South of the tower is a probable courtyard with a cistern and an olive press. A polygonal wall defines the west side of the court. Agios Demetrios lies north-northwest of Goulas, close to Andritsa station and the Tripolis-Argos railway line. Over this entire plain are numerous traces of ancient settlement (prehistoric to Hellenistic and Byzantine sherds, tile and pithos fragments, and stone tools). Worked stone blocks were built into the peribolos of the Church of Ag. Demetrios, beside a large mortarium from an olive press. In the almost flat area extending north of the railway line to the south bank of the Potamia or Xombrio river, surface remains are concentrated in the following two locations. At Tou Triadou extensive (mainly Byzantine) remains include sherds of domestic pottery, pithoi and roof tiles, stone grinders and a mortarium from an olive press. Other finds are part of a probable stone cistern with a waterproof cement lining and a wall, 15m long and lm high as preserved. At Sta Lichadia, ca. 250-300m east of Tou Triadou, two parallel walls of small stones, tile and lime cement were preserved, and traces of limestone foundations appear in several places. In the same field, deep ploughing in 1950 revealed part of a Doric frieze in Doliana marble (a triglyph and part of an undecorated metope roughly</page><page sequence="39">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 39 worked on the back). The type corresponds to the frieze of the triglyph altar at the Shrine of Artemis Knakeatidos at Tegea (late sixth- to early fifth-century BC). In addition to these sites, remains of the ancient road ('Strata') linking Elaiochori with the valley of the Potamia/Xombrio and Myloi are reported. A further section of the Strata borders the west bank of a small stream east of Mount Karvya and stops at the Potamia/Xombrio river at the bridge over the Myloi- Andritsa road. Ancient Epidauros, B and T archaeological zones. Ch. Piteros reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 185-89) the discovery of antiquities in several locations within the protected B and T zones around ancient Epidauros. In the T zone (Gialasi, N. Pitidis Street, 900m south of the modern village) Roman roof tiles of Laconian type, a deposit of sherds of small domestic amphorae, Roman lekanes and kraters, and the stone foundations of a Roman house were found on the property of the Tsoli brothers, close to the Kalogeriko house (the ground floor of which dates to the Middle Byzantine period). A further 220m west, scattered Roman roof tiles were found on the property of T. Beka. In the B zone, 7m south of the junction between the public road to Gialasi and the lane leading to Gliati, what is probably the bed of the ancient road to Epidauros runs northwest-southeast. Trenching alongside the modern road from the village of ancient Epidauros and the ancient theatre to Gliati revealed Byzantine roof tiles and part of a wall with lime plaster at a location 14.2-33.5m north along the road. Ancient Epidauros village Ippokratous Street. Ch. Piteros reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 186-87) the discovery in the course of pipe-trenching of further tombs in the area of the west cemetery of ancient Epidauros. Three Roman cist tombs (first-century BC to first- century AD), oriented east-west and in direct contact with each other, were found 122m before the northern end of Ippokratous Street. Tomb 1, of limestone blocks and cover-tiles, contained a single adult skeleton (probably female), four unguentaria, a fragmentary lagynos, part of a shell and a lamp. Iron nails and fragments of wood probably belong to the bier. Tomb 2 was disturbed; it contained an adult burial and a glass vessel. Tomb 3 contained an adult burial, a lagynos, six unguentaria, a pottery vessel and an iron arrowhead. A further 194m south of the road, on the north side of the Mycenaean cemetery of Epidauros, the pipe-trench cut the dromos of a Mycenaean chamber tomb previously found (along with a group of six others) by V. Stais ( ADelt [1888], 155-58; see also ADelt 29 [1974] Mel , 70-87) and partially destroyed in the construction of the road. A few LHIIIB kylix sherds were collected from the dromos. Previous cleaning of the chamber in 1989 had produced sherds, two vessels, faience beads and a few human bones. Some 5.4-11. 9m before the junction of Hippokratous and Asklepiou Streets, on the south side of the road, was part of a Late Roman to Early Byzantine workshop destroyed by fire. Finds include an oval basin lined with lime plaster for workshop use, a large kados, terracotta floor tiles, a light floor of lime plaster and Laconian-style roof tiles. At the junction of Ippokratous and Asklepiou Streets, on the north side, sherds of LHIIIB-C hole-mouthed jars and kylikes were collected beside the property of A. Eleftherakou, where two Mycenaean tholos tombs were previously found. I. Metaxa Street. Ch. Piteros reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 187-89) on discoveries from the northern part of the street, between the junctions with Perikleous and Asklepiou Streets. A row of tombs was found ca. 1-1 .5m apart. Cist tomb 4, pit-cist tomb 6 and pit graves 9 and 11-16 contained single adult skeletons but no grave goods. Graves 5, 17 and 19 were disturbed. In pit grave 10, a small Hellenistic silver coin served as the danake. The majority of tombs without goods are likely Middle and Late Hellenistic. A few Protogeometric and Geometric sherds were also found further north and immediately east of I. Metaxa Street. The following tombs contained offerings and/or multiple burials. Cist tomb 7 contained three adult skeletons plus a tear- bottle, Hellenistic sherds, amphorae and small iron nails probably from shoes. Cinerary urns 8a and 8(3 were each set upright in a round pit. 8a (Fig. 41), an Attic Submycenaean to Protogeometric shoulder-handled amphora with a bronze phiale in the mouth and a schist cover slab, contained a bronze ring. 8(3, a LHIIICL amphora or hydria, contained a bronze fibula. Ash scattered between the two vessels and above 8(3 likely came from the pyre area. Tomb 18 (oriented northwest-southeast), cut directly into bedrock, is disturbed. Outside was a Hellenistic silver coin of Sikyon and a small domestic vessel. Inside were two adult skeletons, a small black-glazed prochous, a fourth-century BC bronze mirror with a relief Eros on the cover (Fig. 42) and a bronze needle. 41. Ancient Epidauros village, I.

Metaxa Street: relief Eros from a fourth-century mirror cover. Cist tomb 20 contained two adult skeletons, a Roman lamp, the small disc of a bronze mirror, a bronze needle and iron nails from the bier. Pit grave 21, contained one adult (apparently female) skeleton, five Hellenistic unguentaria, a small round pyxis holding white lead and a terracotta boar figurine. Cist tomb 22 contained one adult (probably female) skeleton, a fragmentary glass vessel, a glass unguentarium, two second century AD lamps and an iron needle. Further evidence was identified for the production of purple dye which supplements that previously recorded in this area. Just north of the junction with Perikleous Street were fragments of tile, domestic pottery, Middle and Late Hellenistic amphorae, and large quantities of murex shell. Murex shell was was also found north of tomb 17. In the same place, a wall ran northwest-southeast on the same orientation as the tombs. North of the street were sherds mostly of Hellenistic to Roman pointed amphorae. Ancient Epidauros, road to the sanctuary. Ch. Piteros reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, i92-93) on the cleaning of that part of the ancient road from the city of Epidauros to the Asklepieion which lies north of the sanctuary, from 2.5km after Klimaki until the site of Ag. Andreas or Galaneika. The surviving middle part of the road is ca. 2m wide. The road remained in use into modern times, and runs along the side of a steep gorge, on the south side of the flood stream. The western part, near Klimaki, is partially buried under construction debris from the modern road between Corinth and Epidauros which runs parallel to it (a route down to the ancient road has been created at the 55km marker). Ancient wheel ruts were preserved in several places, and a roughly-worked stone square pillar is probably a road-marker. The discovery at Klimaki in 1949 of an inscription - AAE OAOZ EI2 IA/PON KAEINOY ©E/OY Q TTAPIONTEI - indicates that this was the route taken by pilgrims to Epidauros. Franchthi Cave. K.D. Vitelli (ASCSA) reports on continuing study and analytical programmes. Study of the Franchthi ornaments was devoted to Neolithic assemblages, in particular from trenches FAN, FAS and L5. Eight phases and sub-phases are recognized, in general agreement with the lithic and ceramic phasing. Early and Middle Neolithic show strong continuity, whereas sharp breaks occur at the beginning of the Late and Final Neolithic. Microscopic study and photography of the manufac- turing and wear traces on the FAS and FAN material revealed variety among the apparently homogenous series of Late Neolithic beads. This obtains also for the 'small fired steatite' beads which may actually have been glazed. Study of cockle-shell bead blanks (Cerastoderma glaucum) was coupled with experiments to reconstruct manufacturing procedures and thus document different choices of blanks and different production steps for the Early and Late Neolithic cockle- shell beads. Study of the faunal sequence in trench Hl-B was completed in 2009. Trench Hl-B constitutes the longest Palaeolithic sequence at Franchthi Cave - at least 20,000 years of human occupation spanning numerous cultural and environmental changes. Basic trends in Upper Palaeolithic to Mesolithic foraging are identified as follows, based on these data. A terrestrial focus in diet defines the lower half of the sequence. The diet shifts fairly abruptly to a mixed marine-terrestrial focus above unit 172. Units 153-70 point to exceptional 'instability' in economic and other faunal patterns, some of which must relate to dramatic climate shifts leading into the Holocene. The shifts indicate major reorganization of human economic systems. Exploitation patterns resta- bilize as a new regimen above unit 150. As foragers started to turn to aquatic resources in earnest, they began by gathering pond turtles and marine shellfish. Marine fishing was also practised early on, but fishing became more important and diversified with time. The sequence in which aquatic resource types were integrated into the meat diet follows closely an optimality prediction, beginning with easily collected small animals, moving to greater use of fish and ultimately to fishing for tuna, large fish that are difficult to catch and land. The foraging regimens of units 172-58 were especially diversified, and this may indicate the first of several increases in occupation intensity at Franchthi Cave. Small game exploitation is somewhat less diversified above unit 154, but a variety of species continued to be exploited - in particular fish and carnivores. By unit 128, fish had become very important and more diverse, culminating in a heavy emphasis on tuna fishing. It is not yet clear whether the rising intensity of occupation at Franchthi reflects changes in local human population densities. However, the heaviest use of marine shellfish began around the same time, as did the heavy exploitation of land snails and labour-intensive collection and processing of small-grain grasses and legumes. Increased pressure on local resources is expected to encourage humans to exploit lower-ranked species such as these. Speculatively, we may have evidence from the Hi- fi faunal sequence at Franchthi Cave of feed-back relations between rising populations and expansion into new habitats and technological innovations that span the Late Palaeolithic to the Mesolithic.</page><page sequence="41">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 41 ARCADIA (39th EPCA: 5th EBA) Pallantion. M. Petropoulos (Director, 39th EPCA) reports {Ethnos, Eleftherotypia [09/09/09]) rescue excavation in the lower town of Pallantion in connection with the project to re-establish Lake Taka. Houses and part of the fortifi- cation of the lower city were discovered, plus a building of possible public function with a row of column bases. Ancient Manthyrea. M. Petropoulos reports ( Ethnos , Eleutherotypia [09/09/09]) the discovery, in the course of excavation connected with the project to re-establish Lake Taka, of Mycenaean and Classical walls in a location near Tegea which accords with Pausanias' placing of ancient Manthyrea. Tegea, Palaia Episkopl. A.-V. Karapanagiotou (39th EPCA), D. Athanasoulis (25th EBA) and K. 0degctrd (Norwegian Institute at Athens) report on the first season of collaborative excavation in 2009 (Ministry of Culture and Tourism press release [01/12/09]). West of the ancient theatre and the Byzantine church of Episkopi, the paving of the ancient agora was revealed in a succession of tile-packed surfaces of the Byzantine period, the latest dating to the 12th century AD. Slag from a Byzantine metalworker's shop was also found. To the north were the remains of Byzantine buildings, one of which was evidently linked to agricultural activity since the thick cement floor of one room fits its use as a wine-press. Mount Lykaion, Sanctuary of Zeus. M. Petropoulos (Director, 39th EPCA), M. Voyatzis (ASCSA/Arizona) and D.G. Romano (AS CS A/Pennsylvania) report on excavation and study in 2009. Stratigraphical evidence places the first use of the altar in the prehistoric period. Late Neolithic, Early, Middle and Late Helladic pottery was discovered, with Mycenaean especially well represented (noting numerous kylikes and other small finds). Strata above this include Submycenaean and Protogeometric material, and Geometric to Hellenistic sherds in an apparently continuous sequence. There were large quantities of Final Neolithic, Early and Middle Helladic sherds in nearly all layers of the altar. Dedications recovered include miniature bronze tripods, silver coins, metal objects and 43. Mount Lykaion, Sanctuary of Zeus: the stoa in the lower sanctuary. miniatures of various kinds. Quantities of animal bone continue to be found, but as yet no human bone. In the lower sanctuary, excavation was continued immediately north of the seats or steps: part of a terracotta water channel may relate to the use of these seats in the fourth century BC. Outside the northeast corner of the xenon was a long, sunken open-air corridor with carefully cut walls. More of the 67m long stoa was cleared (Fig. 43) and three trenches were opened in the hippodrome. Geological, topographical and architectural surveys continued alongside excavation, following directions outlined in 2008. Architectural study of the bath to the northeast of the hippodrome began. The project website is http://lykaionexcavation.org. LACONIA (5th EPCA: 5th EBA) Sparta Platanista Street (O.T. 6, I. Panagaki property). E. Zavvou (then 5th EPCA, now Epigraphical Museum) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 211-13) the discovery of a Roman residence during rescue excavation in 2000. Construction was in brick (with a plaster coating) on a stone foundation. Five of the six rooms uncovered had third-century AD mosaic floors with geometric motifs and central figure scenes. The probable triclinium (area 2) lay in the north and west of the plot: a double doorway communicated with an atrium to the south, although the orientation of the central emblema of the floor mosaic indicates that the main entrance was on the north. This exceptionally well- preserved mosaic has a rectangular border with geometric designs: on the east and west intersecting circles form four-leafed designs; on the south is a series of lozenges; the north is divided into three smaller areas (the east contains shields, the centre eight-point stars and the west is lost). The far side of the floor, bordered by a band of perspective meander swastikas with interspersed squares, contains a composition of lozenges within squares. In the central area (bordered by monochrome bands and a garland) is Dionysos in a chariot drawn by two panthers, with a Maenad to the left and an actor to the right. In the lower part of the scene is a basket with a snake coiled around it, and a cradle. The triclinium communicates with room 4 via a doorway with a marble threshold and a mosaic by the opening. Within room 4, beneath a destruction layer containing roofing material, was a floor mosaic. Two frames of geometric motifs border the further part, which is decorated with octagons in contact with parallelograms (an unusual motif in the Greek world); in the central area is a rectangular maze. Room 1, in the northeast corner of the plot, also has a well-preserved floor mosaic. The external border, a series of shields, is so far unique among Spartan mosaics. The second border contains meander swastikas with inter- spersed parallelograms. The further part has a compo- sition of intersecting circles forming four-leafed designs. In the central area (bordered by a stylized floral band) is a gladiator wearing a short-sleeved chiton and brandishing a spear against a wild beast rearing up on its hind legs. The orientation of the scene indicates that the main entrance was at the north.</page><page sequence="42">42 CATHERINE MORGAN Room 4 communicated with room 5; a threshold mosaic has a circle within a lozenge within a parallel- ogram. The floor mosaic in room 5 has geometric decoration: the frame is a row of parallelograms decorated with a double anthemion and the main area a grid of four- pointed lozenge stars. Only a few parts of the floor mosaic of the southeast room of the house (room 3) survive, all with geometric decoration. Large zones which may belong to the main area contain eight-point stars which delimit upright and perpendicular rectangles, a grid of lozenges forming four- point stars and a band with a repeated fusiform motif. Part of the framing band has a row of isosceles triangles (a common motif in Sparta). North of room 3, a room (6) has a terracotta tiled floor which continues east beyond the trench. In addition to Roman pottery, one Hellenistic coin of Sikyon and two Imperial Roman coins (third- to fourth- century) were collected. Further traces of this residence have been located in neighbouring plots (E. Zavvou: ADelt55 [2000] Ch, 213- 14, 227). On the property of S. and Z. Politi on Platanista Street (O.T. 141), directly opposite the Panagaki plot and next to the Moiragia-Doulia property, was a northeast-southwest stone wall founded on a layer of cement, pithos sherds and stone which probably stabilized the ground since the local water table is high. At the southern end of it was an enchytrismos in a fragmentary pointed amphora. An apsidal wall belongs to a later building phase. In front of the Moiragia-Doulia property, a trench dug by the water company of Sparta revealed part of a floor mosaic with geometric decoration, bordered to the south by a wall. Two bands are evident, the exterior with lozenge decoration and the interior with wave-spirals and four-point stars below. 98 Thermopylon Street (O.T. 122, G. and I. Katsichti property). E. Zavvou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 214-16) the completion of the second phase of excavation of this plot (see previously ADelt 54 [1999] Chr , 164) (Fig. 44). During the first phase (reported in ADelt 52 [1997] Chr , 187-89), Byzantine architecture was uncovered, founded directly onto a Roman building and bath. Continued excavation defined the different building phases and use of materials. The Byzantine buildings were founded directly onto earlier Roman structures and materials from the latter re-used, sometimes unmodified. The bath and other structures in the northern part of the plot are connected with discoveries made on the neigh- bouring property of N. Photopoulos to the east, and form part of a large Roman residence (cf ADelt 51 [1996] Chr , 116-18; ADelt 53 [1998] Chr , 152-53). The owner, evidently a member of the Spartan elite, was a successful athlete to judge from inscriptions inside the crowns depicted on one of the floor mosaics in the bath, which identify the victors and the contests concerned. It remains hazardous to assign this residence to any Spartan athlete known from other sources. 44. Sparta, 98 Thermopylon Street: overview of excavation.</page><page sequence="43">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 43 In the west of the bath was the caldarium with its hypocaust. The suspended floor was constructed of three layers of terracotta tile bonded with cement and with cement on top to secure a marble surface. It was supported on 24 unevenly spaced pillars: after an initial construction phase using square pillars round the edges of the floor, structural correction was required and round pillars were inserted towards the middle. These round pillars were carelessly built using drums of different dimensions (one contained part of a marble kioniskos). One of them partially blocked the airway bringing hot air to the caldarium to the west. The caldarium basement had a pebble floor. The walls of the bath were heated via a facing of tegulae mammatae, of which parts are preserved on the west wall of the caldarium, and through a gap between the suspended floor of the caldarium and its walls. Sections of tegulae mammatae were found in secondary use in various places within the Byzantine walls. West of the caldarium was a second room with a hypocaust. A narrow opening allowed communication between them, and the two basement areas were linked by two air conduits. Room 2 had a floor mosaic, and beneath this an earlier cement floor on which were strong traces of burning. The praefurnium, north of the caldarium, contained a large quantity of burnt matter. A channel brought hot air to the basement of the caldarium. In the initial phase, this channel was covered by a brick arch, meaning that the suspended floor must then have been at a higher level and that the floor uncovered does not belong to the first phase of the building. A pool belonging to the frigidarium had a thick water- proof cement lining and was originally faced, probably with marble slabs. A low wall fenced it on the south and bathers descended into it by two steps. When the bath was abandoned in Early Christian or Byzantine times, a low stone and brick wall built around the pool closed off the outflow channel. While it is difficult to interpret this later phase of activity, it clearly involved fire since there is burnt matter within the pool and traces of burning on its walls (although the caldarium cannot have moved into this area since no air conduits have been found). Beneath the herringbone-tiled floor in room 4 was a cement floor laid over a course of rounded pebbles and cement. This sloped down to the south. A further floor of the same construction lay beneath it. Beneath this lay the drainage channel from the frigidarium, as well as a lead water-pipe. In the centre of this area was a rectangular bathtub, which should also be connected to the frigi- darium. Successive phases of construction are evident in room 5. A Roman floor mosaic with geometric decoration lay to the south of the south wall. Inside the room, a second cement floor lay beneath the substrate of the upper floor level and, beneath that, a brick wall with a cement coating and traces of marble cladding on the south face. Finally, in this underlying level a stone and cement wall was partially destroyed by the construction of a tomb (containing one burial in supine position, head to the west, and a small gold leaf). Saketta Street. E. Zawou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 216-18) the discovery of antiquities at several points along this street in the course of public works. At Saketta 5 (Georgakoulia property), a wall bordered an area of stone paving. Parts of other walls were found at Saketta 7 and 9 respectively. At Saketta 13 (N.K. Koulougeorgiou property), an apsidal stone wall had on the south face a round stone structure (0.39m in diameter) with thickly applied cement, used as a support for a vessel. East of the wall were two cist tombs oriented north-northwest-south-southeast, both containing single burials in supine position, head to the west, without goods but with the remains of earlier burials. Tomb 1 had wall and cover slabs in secondary use and a tiled floor: the cover slabs of the earlier burial displaced within the tomb were set inside the cist along its long sides. Tomb 2 was built of unworked stone and tile. Further walls were found at 15-17 Saketta Street. Alcman Street (O.T. 124, G. Polychronakou property). A. Bakourou and E. Katsara (5th EBA) report {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 266, 268) the completion of excavation by the 5th EBA of a dense complex of buildings of the Late Byzantine, Early Christian, Late Roman and Hellenistic periods on a plot south of the acropolis walls (see previ- ously ADelt 52 [1997] Chr, 178; ADelt 53 [1998] Chr, 217-221; ADelt 54 [1999] Chr, 220). Trials were opened in the road revealed in areas I' and K': beneath the upper surface was a cement-lined water channel and there were three further road surfaces beneath. A full account of the site will be presented after study of the excavated material. 140-44 Vrasidou Street (O.T. 30, A. Koumoundourou and I. Krikela property, formerly Tsirigoti property). E. Zawou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 218-222) the discovery of Hellenistic to Late Roman building remains and groups of Roman and Late Roman tombs which represent a continuation of the cemetery excavated in the area of the public market and neighbouring Kleombrotou Street (cf ADelt 24 [1969] Chr, 135-37; ADelt 28 [1973] Chr, 168-70; ADelt 4 4-46 [1989-1991] Mel, 335-60). In the south, tomb group I (tombs 1-3 and 5) consists of brick and cement cists with cover slabs; tombs 1 and 3 were subsequently divided into two compartments. The north- ernmost tomb (1), with a tiled floor, contained a child inhumation with a Roman deep plate and large iron nails. Tomb 2 (also with a tiled floor) shared a common wall with tomb 1. It contained a single inhumation with the head on a tile 'rest', plus bones from a second burial; a very few sherds were collected from the fill. Tomb 3, with cover tiles, contained a child burial without goods. Tomb 5, which shared a common wall with tomb 2, was empty (and probably looted). The construction of tomb group I required the partial levelling of an earlier northeast-southwest retaining wall. Around this wall a large pit cut into stereo contained a quantity of Hellenistic and Roman pottery, namely miniature vessels, a black-glazed ring-based kernos (Fig. 45), a thilastron, Hellenistic calyx cups and red-figure sherds, plus part of a bronze pin and figurine fragments. East of tomb 1 was an intact Laconian Late Roman amphora. Further walls found in the area include two probably Early Christian structures north of tomb group I. Tomb 4 is a pit grave (oriented northwest-southeast) cut into stereo south of wall 3, with marble cover slabs in secondary use. It contained the supine inhumation of a youth, head to east, a first-century BC glass unguentarium and iron nails by the head and feet probably from the bier.</page><page sequence="44">44 CATHERINE MORGAN 45. Sparta, 140-44 Vrasidou Street: black-glazed kernos (Sparta Museum 15118). Tomb group II (graves 6-10) lies north of wall 3. Most of the graves were brick-built cists, oriented north- south. Tomb 6 contained an inhumation with a tile headrest (plus the remains of an earlier burial), a lamp and a glass unguentarium both dating to the second century AD, and part of a bronze surgical instrument with decorative silver inlay (Fig. 46). Tomb 7, covered with tiles, was robbed, leaving only scattered bones and fragments of gold leaves. Between tombs 6 and 7 was a North African-type lamp depicting a saint on the discus. Tomb 8 contained fragments of bone and iron nails. Tombs 9 (a stone-lined cist) and 10 were both badly damaged. To the north was an area of burning which included a coin of Valentinian II (AD 375-392). East of tomb group II, a well (1.2m in diameter, over 6.2m deep), cut into bedrock, contained a large quantity of Hellenistic pottery. Further to the north was part of a Roman bath destroyed by fire: among the debris were fragments of hypocaust column and tegulae mammatae. A stone water channel ran beyond the north side of the building, while to the west and north were further architectural remains (walls, some to the north with marble revetment, and sections of tiled floor). Two further funerary monuments in the north of the plot had been looted. Tomb group III, to the east, contained cist tombs 11 and 12, oriented east- west. Tomb 11 contained a Roman plate. Tombs 13 and 14, in tomb group IV, both oriented east-west, were looted. Seven further coins were found in the course of the excavation, including one of Eurykles (31-7 BC) and a Byzantine issue with a very worn depiction of an emperor on the obverse and on the reverse the legend XX CO[N]. Further finds include fragments of bronze and bone pins, part of a bronze stirrer, a glass bead and a piece of obsidian. Staufert Street (O.T. 98, N. Konstantaki property). E. Zavvou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 222) the discovery of an ancient road running southeast-northwest, bounded by walls on either side. Successive Hellenistic and Roman cobbled road surfaces (0.6m wide) are preserved. North of the north boundary wall lay an open area with a cistern and a round well. The well, constructed of two terracotta cylinders (1.4m high x 1.1m in diameter) with access steps, contained Classical and Hellenistic pottery. In the south and west of the plot was a section of a large stone- built sewer. Excavation continues. Letous Street (west side of O.T. 102). E. Zavvou reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 222-23) the discovery of a probable west continuation of the retaining wall for a road previ- ously discovered on the neighbouring property of A. Stavropoulou-Bouchali to the east (on which see ADelt 54 [1999] Chr , 166). To the north lay the corner of a building founded over a round structure (2m in diameter) of unknown function (perhaps a well), as well as Roman wall foundations which incorporated the lower part of a draped female statue, recut on its right side to serve as building material (Sparta Museum 15132). Finally, a limestone wall was found in front of the Vosinaki property on Letous 1. 145 Archidamou Street (O.T. 113, P. Theophilakou property). E. Zavvou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 223) the discovery of Hellenistic constructions and evidence for a potter's workshop on the west side of the Xenia hill. Three Hellenistic walls were uncovered, one of which incorporated an Egyptian boat quern of probable Classical date. The existence of a Late Hellenistic workshop in the area is indicated by almost intact pots among the walls, many of which were warped or misfired. Finds comprise two plates, a black-glazed wheelmade lamp, two black- glazed prochoiskoi, two black-figure oinochoae plus one with badly compressed walls, part of a probably lagynos, a red-slipped bowl, a kantharos, and part of a mould for imbricate moulded bowls. Small finds include a bronze coin of the reign of Eurykles, part of a tile stamped AAM02I[0Z]/ A[©]A[NA2] and a first-century BC pyramidal loom weight stamped A and P(?). Alcman and Lysander Street (O.T. 127, E. Philippopoulou property). A. Bakourou and E. Katsara report (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 265-66) further investigation of a Byzantine olive press in an area where a basilica and Middle Byzantine bath have previously been found. The proximity of the press to these buildings reflects its public character and place in local town planning. The conglom- erate press-stone was located, plus two further stones which form part of the press. The extension of excavation to the north revealed the northern walls of the complex (in places under destruction deposits), water channels and tile floors. The trapetum itself was founded in a layer of unworked 46.

A roughly- worked and rounded stone (3.2m in circumference), with a central socket (0.12m in diameter) and a rectangular cutting on the underside, must belong to the press used to extract olive oil from the pulp left after the whole olive had passed through the trapetum. A second similar stone was found nearby, as was the monolithic olive-crushing basin. Triakosion Street (O.T. 127, P. and S. Androutsou property). A. Bakourou and E. Katsara (5th EBA) report (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 268) the discovery of the eastwards continuation of a known Middle Byzantine basilica, with groups of tombs. The plot lies directly between the properties of E. Rigou and E. Dipla, where a Byzantine church and bath, respectively, have been discovered. Work will continue. Lysander Street (O.T. 126, V. Leopoulou property). A. Bakourou and E. Katsara report ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 268) the excavation of a further part of the Late Roman bath found on land belonging to the same owners as O.T. 127, which itself underlies a Byzantine bath ( cf. ADelt 20 [1965] Chr, 173-74; ADelt 21 [1966] Chr , 155-159). Sparta-Mystra Road (O.T. T444, P. and E. Kirkiri property). E. Zavvou reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 223) the discovery of the corner of a building. Excavation was continued by the 5th EBA. Unofficial ring-road (O.T. 131, A. and Z. Vergadou property). A. Themos (then 5th EPCA, now Epigraphical Museum) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 223-24) on excavation ca. 300m northwest of the Roman theatre. A northeast-southwest wall of field-stones and architectural spolia formed part of a building (noting the presence of intersecting walls and marble threshold blocks), however, the plan cannot be reconstructed from the small area excavated. Two channels in the south of the plot follow the orientation of the walls. The remains of a later construction also follow the same orientation. Pitanis Street (O.T. 6, M. Dagre property). A. Themos reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 224-25) the discovery of part of a Roman bath with walls in opus testacaeum. The hypocausts of the three heated rooms, A, B and T, of stone and plaster, were tiled with tegulae bipedales. The pillars of the hypocaust (mostly round but occasionally square especially in the corners) were preserved sporadically across the three rooms. In the southern part of room A was a plunge bath with a dedicated praefurnium to the west (with a connecting air conduit). A small adjunct room outside the bath building, and to the south of the praefurnium of room A, was perhaps a wood store. An air conduit linked the basement of the room A with room B (which also contained support columns for the suspended floor). The basements of rooms B and T were also linked by two air conduits (room V continues under the modern street). A terracotta water-pipe and a small sink-pit lay south of room l~. A sewer line below the south side of the plunge bath probably belongs to an earlier building. 12 Artemis Orthia Street (O.T. 102, A. Stavropoulou- Bouchali property). A. Themos reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 225) on ongoing excavation (see previously ADelt 54 [1999] Chr, 166). Clearance of the architectural remains previously reported, including an ancient road in the centre of the plot, was completed. A large volume of pottery was collected, along with iron nails, bronze items such as a hook, ring and pins, and an Archaic pin. Bronze coins include: two Laconian coins of the reign of Hadrian (Gruppe XXXVII); a worn Roman Imperial coin (with a Nile on the reverse); and a Lakedaimonian issue of 35-31 BC (Gruppe XXII, 3) with the legend OEIAIAZ on the obverse; two more dating 43-31 BC (Gruppe XVI and XVII, 76 respectively); another of 48-35 BC (Gruppe XV); and one of 7-2 BC (Gruppe XXXI); then two coins of Sikyon, one bronze and one silver; two Laconian coins of 31-7 BC (Gruppe XXVI); two worn coins likely dating 48-40 BC (Gruppe XIV); two Laconian coins of the reign of Commodus (Gruppe XLVI); and one probably of the reign of Claudius (Gruppe XXXVI). Oraias Elenis Street (Ch. Giatra property). A. Themos reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 225-27) the excavation of a fourth- to fifth-century AD building, part of which may have been a workshop. This is a continuation of the complex found in 1993 on the neighbouring Katsou plot to the south. In its first phase, the building consisted of two rooms with separate entrances, with walls of unworked stone, tile and mud (plaster was rarely used). Another building of this phase can be traced beneath later walls. To a later general phase of rebuilding belongs a well in the south of the plot which cuts through earlier structures. After the abandonment of the complex, two tombs were dug in room III - a Late Roman to Early Christian tile grave and a cist (including marble in secondary usage) containing two burials, the latter with an Early Christian lekythos. Late Roman to Early Christian pottery collected includes ARS plates and North African lamps, one- handled cups, an almost intact amphora, an inscribed Roman lamp and part of a pointed amphora. Small finds include iron nails, parts of bone pins and a needle, a glass bead, two bronze stirrers, fragments of glass vessels, part of a miniature bronze bell, a bronze figurine of Hermes and four fragments of stone inscriptions (of which M13856 is a part of Diocletian's Edict on Maximum Prices). One hundred and twenty three bronze coins were collected, most of them fourth-century AD. Electricity company works. A. Themos notes (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 221) several locations in Sparta where the opening of trenches for electricity cabling has revealed fragments of walls and drainage channels among other architectural remains. The most significant remains - an atrium with a marble-clad impluvium and an early fourth-century AD floor mosaic - lie beneath IX Merarchi Street on the west side of O.T. 150. The atrium was surrounded by a water channel; in its centre, a lead water-pipe connects with the impluvium. The floor mosaic, framed with a garland, has panels preserved on the north, east and west sides, although the south is largely destroyed. The north side has three parts: on the east, two erotes fish from a boat</page><page sequence="46">46 CATHERINE MORGAN with a net; in the centre, Poseidon is seated on a hippocamp; on the west, two erotes fish from a boat with rods. In the centre zone on the west side, Aphrodite is seated in a conch borne on the shoulders of two Tritons: two erotes are depicted above the heads of the Tritons and below Aphrodite. In the central zone on the south side is one of the first depictions of Hypnos' revelation to Dionysos of Ariadne sleeping on the shore of Naxos at the moment when she is abandoned by Theseus. The figures of Ariadne, Hypnos, Dionysos and Theseus are named. Magoula L and S. Prekeze property. A. Themos reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 227-28) the discovery of a round structure with two parallel stone walls (estimated diameter 31.4m and 23m) cut by a channel. A second channel runs parallel to the west face of the interior wall. This appears to be an open, unroofed space, of uncertain function. The corner of a later structure overlies the outer wall in the southwest of the plot. Kallikratidou Street. A. Themos reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 228) the discovery of ancient walls and sections of floor at several points along this street, as well as a cist tomb. Notably, on the property of P. Papagiannakos was part of a building with at least four rooms. Finds include a marble portrait head of a bearded man. Sparta-Kastorio road. E. Zawou and A. Themos report ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 228-29) on antiquities discovered during the construction of the section of this new road from Sparta to Karavas. Architectural remains and stone cist tombs were found 940m to 1.1km along the road, 160m from the west side in the former Karkoula property. Tomb 1 (oriented northwest-southeast), with stone cover slabs, contained one burial, head to the east, and a black-glazed lakaina. Tomb 2, oriented east-west, was badly damaged. Tomb 3 contained a few degraded bones. Excavation continues. The location helps to define the northern extent of the ancient city and the ancient road from Sparta to Megalopolis on the right bank of the Evrotas. The tombs probably belong to the north cemetery of Sparta. Mystras, Baloukorrachi, Church of Agios Andreas. A. Bakourou and E. Pantou report (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 245) on a study conducted in 1999 for the restoration of this single-aisled church, noting evidence for at least three building phases. To the first, Late Byzantine (14th century), phase belong the apse of the sanctuary and part of the side walls; to the second (Ottoman), the remainder of the walls; and to recent times the extension of the narthex and the roof pre-conservation. Amyklai, village (V. Politis property). E. Zawou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 229) on rescue excavation which revealed extensive debris from the collapse of ancient architecture, including marble column fragments and a crown-block with acanthus leaves surrounding an egg. Unglazed Roman sherds, plus some earlier black-glaze sherds, were collected, along with sherds of storage pithoi and a large quantity of tile. Small finds include a bronze coin, part of a bronze stirrer and a fragment of stamped red-slipped tile. Amyklai, Sanctuary of Apollo. E. Zawou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 230) the seizure of 16 architectural members from the property of K. Chroni at Kalogonia, Sparta. These include one piece with relief carving of lotus flowers intertwined with lotus buds, which probably belongs to the sculpted decoration of the Temple of Apollo. Press attention ( Ethnos , Eleftherotypia and Apogevmatini [24/06/10]) has been drawn to the decision of the Central Archaeological Council to permit the removal from the walls of the 12th-century Church of Profitis Ilias and the 13th-century Church of Ag. Theodoroi of seven architectural members from the Amyklaion throne and the altar of Apollo. Further spolia are noted in the churches of Ag. Nikolaos and Ag. Kyriaki. The seven members will be replaced with replicas, with no threat to the stability of the church buildings. Gytheion, Agia Triada Street (O.T. 15, S. Diakoumakou property). A. Themos reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 229) the discovery of part of a large Roman building complex with a north entrance. Two rooms were partially excavated: beneath a destruction level, the north had marble paving around the edge and a floor in opus sectile in the centre. Only part of the south room was explored since the structure continues beneath the neigh- bouring plot. East of this room was an area with a floor mosaic. In the western part of the excavation area was part of a north-south road crossed by two terracotta water-pipes: slight remains of the west retaining wall were recovered. This road lies above the building complex, confirming the impression gained from excavation elsewhere in the town that the Roman city was built on terraces on the slopes of the modern Palaiopolis. Lakonis cave. E. Panagopoulou, P. Karkanas, E. Kotzabopoulou, G. Tsartsidou, K. Charvati and M. Dinou (then EPS, now EPSNE) report (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 1199-202). A small underground hollow was identified and explored, excavation in the main area continued and study of geology, environment and cave formation processes pursued. In area 1, a succession of hearths was excavated and the carbonized material sampled. Both the technology of the stone tools and C14 dates verify occupation at the end of the Middle Palaeolithic. A similar sequence of burnt areas was explored in trench 2, where the upper levels have Palaeolithic tools and those beneath Middle Palaeolithic. More than 1,000 stone tools were recovered from the two trenches: full discussion of their technology, and of C14 data, is presented. Early bovine and deer species are well presented in the faunal record, and plant remains indicate wooded surroundings. Survey in the wider eastern Mani area (reported below) has produced, in addition to new Palaeolithic sites, evidence for a likely source of the principal stone used for tools 15km from the site. East Mani survey. A. Darlas (then EPS, now EPSNE) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 1204) on the second season of survey focused north of the Bay of Oitylos, between Chotasias and Trachilas. On the west coast in particular, numerous surface finds (mostly of stone tools of Palaeolithic, but also later, date) were made especially in caves and hollows (15 new sites are noted). Investigation</page><page sequence="47">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 47 of the Vathy Langadi tis Trachilas produced no prehistoric material, although medieval and modern were present. Thirteenth- to 14th-century wall-paintings are reported in the rock-shelter of Ag. Marina. Ancient Pyrrichos. As part of a programme of the 5th EPCA to extend and revise the legal protection given to the archaeological sites of Mani, a full account of the city of Pyrrichos and its territory is presented, including a map, analytical catalogue of archaeological remains known from this area and extensive bibliography ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 230-38). B' Kouveleiki cave, Alepochori. Ch. Kontaxi (then EPS, now EPSNE) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1202) continuing excavation in 1999 and 2000. The only new anthropogenic features reported are Neolithic pits dug into the lower cave fill. Pottery consists of roughly-smoothed (and uncoated) domestic plainware, mainly storage vessels of different sizes, but also wide-mouthed vessels and open shapes such as bowls. Pithoi with rope decoration date to Late Neolithic I and II. Almost all of the stone tools are of Melian obsidian (blades, scrapers, arrowheads, etc.), with a very few simple flint items: worked stone axes, rubbers and millstones are also present (noting the use of serpentine). C14 dates indicate a range of 4,458-3,710 BC. The results of micromorphological and DNA analyses are awaited. Agios Vasileios. A. Vasilogamvrou (Director, 5th EPCA) reports ( Eleftherotypia , Ethnos , Ta Nea [28/04/09]) the discovery of further remains of Mycenaean settlement in the course of rescue excavation. In addition to pottery and figurines, fresco fragments and fragments of three Linear B tablets indicate the existence of a higher-order centre in the vicinity. Tablet 1 preserves the word e-pi-zo-ta, referring to daggers or short swords, on one side in a large quantity (500-999) and, on the other, in a smaller (100). Tablet 2 has the name ti-jo-ko (Antichos). Tablet 3 preserves the following words on each line: -to-jo (line 1); wi-ti-mi-ja (Isthmia) (line 2); TELA-PA (ideogram for textile) followed by three (line 3); lines 4-5 are illegible; PTE- WE (woven fabric, as a dedication) (last line).

Church of Agia Anna or Our Lady of Malta. A. Bakourou and E. Pantou report (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 245-46) on remedial work focused on the east side of the church, where a large part of the sanctuary apse had collapsed. Following the removal of debris, part of the destroyed niche of the sanctuary was revealed, built in worked limestone blocks with white plaster on the interior. The remains were cleaned and stabilized. Pavlopetri. E. Spondylis (EMA) and J. Henderson (BSA/Nottingham) report on the first season of under- water survey of the submerged prehistoric town off the Pounta shore, opposite Elaphonisos. The site was first identified in 1904, rediscovered in 1967, and in 1968 surveyed by a team from the University of Cambridge using a fixed-grid system and hand tapes. The resulting plan, covering an area of 300m x 100m, included at least 15 separate building complexes, court- yards, streets, two chamber tombs and 37 cist graves. The underwater site continues south onto Pavlopetri island, on which were visible remains of walls and other archaeo- logical material. On the Pounta shore, a cemetery of at least 60 rock-cut graves was provisionally dated to the Early Helladic. A little Early to Late Bronze Age surface pottery was recovered from the seabed in 1968, but the submerged buildings were dated by analogy mainly to the Mycenaean period. Ceramic evidence for later use of the site comprises Hellenistic cooking pots, black-glazed wares, Roman ribbed ware and late sixth- to seventh- century AD sherds. In 2009 a new survey recorded the surviving architec- tural remains and recovered a range of surface finds from across the site. Two survey methods were employed: points were taken using a shore-based robotic total station; and trial survey was carried out using a Kongsberg-Mesotech MS 1000 sector scan sonar. In testing the sonar equipment, a wide range of scan radii were used from fixed positions, ranging from 150m scans of building complexes to very high resolution 5m scans. The MS 1000 sector scan sonar provides instantaneous high-resolution sea floor scans which consist of 3D point cloud data comparable to that produced by terrestrial laser scanners. The data produced will be manipulated in 3D environments to produce isometric images of the submerged building complexes. In addition to recording the 30,000m2 of buildings first identified in 1968, over 9,000m2 of new buildings were discovered to the north (Fig. 47). At least 25 co- joined square and rectilinear rooms (built of rough square limestone blocks as elsewhere on the site) began some 10m from the existing shore line. A 40m long street was lined with rectilinear buildings with stone foundations. One square building (3m x 3m) contains the remains of a central pillar-like structure. Two new cist graves were discovered alongside what appears to be a pithos burial in a corner of one of the newly discovered rooms. A large trapezoidal building, ca. 34m long and 12-17m wide, contains at least three separate rooms and is comparable in layout to Early Bronze Age buildings. Its size and prominent position within the settlement imply that it was of some importance. The extent of the town is now estimated at ca. 4ha. The pottery collected in 2009, while unstratified, covers the entire extent of the site as now known and provides a clearer picture of occupation history. Occupation began in the Final Neolithic. Ongoing study of the artefacts sampled, i.e. 442 ceramic items, an iron nail and an obsidian chip, provides the following chrono- logical breakdown: 3% Final Neolithic, 40% Early Bronze Age, 15% Middle Bronze Age, 25% Late Bronze Age, 3% Classical/Hellenistic, 0.5% Roman/Byzantine. Of the pottery, 13.5% is badly worn and provisionally charac- terized as Bronze Age. Early Helladic pithoi and storage jars bear a variety of rope-impressed and finger-impressed decoration. In addition to storage vessels (some with mat-impressed bases), standard Early Bronze Age shapes such as cups, sauceboats, conical saucers, askoi, portable hearths and dishes are represented, some showing close links with the Cyclades, western Crete and the northeastern Aegean. In contrast to the limited picture of Middle Helladic occupation from the 1968 survey, a quantity of Middle</page><page sequence="48">48 CATHERINE MORGAN 47. Pavlopetri: site plan following the 2009 survey. Helladic pottery was lifted in 2009, both local wares and a few imports possibly from Kythera, noting storage vessels with Middle Minoan decoration. Late Bronze Age sherds span the Middle Helladic/Late Helladic transition until the collapse of the Mycenaean palaces. Shapes represented include drinking vessels (mainly kylikes and cups), storage vessels (amphorae and alabastra) and vessels for serving liquids (squat jugs, skyphoi and kraters). Several sherds show strong Late Minoan influence; a clay strainer is provisionally dated to LMIB. The site was probably abandoned in post-palatial times. Limited Classical to Hellenistic reoccupation is indicated by fourth- and third-century skyphos and other sherds. Late antique pottery recovered in 1968 and 2009 may also indicate limited reoccupation and local involvement in trade in limestone and iron from the nearby ores at Ag. Elissaios and the exploitation of murex beds for the production of purple dye. Elaphonisos, M. Liarou-Psarommati property. E. Zavvou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 229) the discovery of Early Helladic and Mycenaean sherds during trial excavation in the area of Lefki, at Kato Nisi. Neapolis (ancient Boiai), 124 Akti Boion Street (G. I. and K. Kontraphouri property). A. Themos (then 5th EPCA, now Epigraphical Museum) reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 230) the discovery of walls and Late Roman pottery (amphorae, terra sigillata, and incised and combed ware) during excavation connected with the insertion of new supports into a house basement. The plot lies south of the central square of Neapolis, immediately bordering the site of a Late Roman bath previously partially excavated (see ADelt 25 [1970] Chr , 172; ADelt26 [1971] Chr , 120- 22; ADelt 28 [1973] Chr , 173-75, and noting the fragment of Diocletian's Edict on Maximum Prices previously found here: AE [1992], 165-77). The present remains must be part of this complex. MESSENIA (38th EPCA: 26th EBA) Messene. P. Themelis (ASA) reports on a further season of excavation in the theatre, the north stoa in the agora and the monopteros ( Ergon [2009], 42-48). In the theatre, the east retaining wall of the koilon was completely exposed to its lowest course. This is also the north wall of the skenotheke of which the east wall and the stylobate of the south side are preserved (Fig. 48). Three parallel channels in the floor of the skenotheke allowed the movement of wheeled wooden scenery into the orchestra from the end of the third century BC to the first century AD (Fig. 49). Behind the north wall of the skenotheke lay the sloping floor which led to the middle diazoma of the koilon. In the 10th to 11th century AD, the east retaining wall was levelled, and workshops and lime kilns built within the foundations of the koilon. Among the building material used is the base of a marble statue of a boxer victo- rious in the Pythian games and in the Basileia at Levadeia.</page><page sequence="49">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 49 East of the theatre, beside the spring of Arsinoe, is the TT-shaped stoa which forms the northern boundary of the agora. The western part was excavated in 2009; parts of the internal Corinthian colonnade had inscribed bases for bronze statues. One base fragment preserves a depiction of a conical helmet in relief. East of the apse of the basilica in the theatre area, and mostly beneath the basilica, lay the stylobate of a round Doric building (10m in diameter) with many of its columns collapsed around it (Fig. 50). Around and outside the stylobate was a second concentric circle of limestone slabs belonging to an older construction. A multi-coloured stone and glass mosaic floor between the two foundations depicts several over life-size figures named in black stone captions: one of the male figures carrying a staff is named Atticus, perhaps the father of Herodes Atticus (Fig. 51). An inscribed statue base west of the round Doric building bears a dedicatory inscription from the captains to Capitoline Zeus. 48. Messene: north wall of the skenotheke. 49.

Themelis (ASA) reports {Ergon [2009], 49) on excavation within the sekos of the temple (thought to be dedicated to Eileithyia and the Kouretes), which revealed an ivy-leaf shaped statue base. A stone shelf around the sekos was for the placing of dedications (Fig. 52). Ellinika, Antheia (G. Skartsili property). X. Arapogianni (then Director, 7th EPCA, now Director, 38th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 279) the discovery of a further Mycenaean chamber tomb (Ellinika 15). While this is not part of the previously known Mycenaean cemetery (being 400m away), it is a monumental tomb, second in size only to Ellinika 6. 50. Messene: round Doric building. 51. Messene: floor mosaic from the round Doric building. The near-square chamber (6.9m x 7.1m, 5.1m high) has a gabled roof: a bench was cut along the north and south walls. A north door leads into a side room (2m x 2.5m, 2.09m high). The dromos is cut by a farm road and only 9m of its length has been uncovered; it slopes down gently towards the tomb entrance. The tomb has a deep threshold; the dry-stone wall which sealed it was largely removed by looters in antiquity. Very few finds survive: by the door was part of a stone vessel plus gold shavings and a few sherds were scattered through the fill. Two burials without goods lay on the floor of the dromos just outside the chamber entrance: the first a single child burial and the second that of two individuals, one above the other. Finds are insufficient to indicate a date. 52. Ithome: temple sekos.</page><page sequence="50">50 CATHERINE MORGAN Kastroulia Ampheias. X. Arapogianni reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 280) the discovery of two tumuli, ca. 40m apart, on a small hill ca. 500m from the Mycenaean cemetery of Ellinika and 450m west of the village of Ampheia. Prehistoric sherds have previously been noted on and around the hill. Tumulus 1 had previously been the target of illegal excavation which may also have destroyed parts of the central elliptical structure of unworked stones. The rich sherd material from the fill dates exclusively to EHII. Tumulus 2 is scheduled for future excavation. Ancient Thouria. X. Arapogianni (ASA) reports {Ergon [2009], 33-41) on continuing excavation (Fig. 53). A large polygonal retaining wall (14m long, 3.1m high, oriented north-south) forms a corner at its northern end, continues east-west for 4m and is continued for 30m to the south by a more recent isodomic retaining wall. A stone staircase leads up to the platform, on which the north, south and east sides of the large isodomic building A (oriented east-west) were exposed. Inside were the remains of its Laconian tiled roof above an ash layer. Small cisterns of tile and lime mortar were later constructed around the building. 53. Ancient Thouria: excavation plan. The fourth-century BC building B lay 5m south of building A. The stylobate of its Ionic colonnade is preserved for a length of ca. 10m with three column bases in situ (Fig. 54). At the eastern end was an in situ monolithic engaged column with, beside it, part of the epistyle and other architectural members. This building 54. Thouria: building B, stylobate of Ionic colonnade. also had a Laconian tiled roof: its public function is confirmed by a number of tiles stamped AAMOZIOI. Building T (south of building B) had a monumental fagade and a two-stepped stylobate supporting a wall of orthostates intersected by Doric half-columns (the northwest corner column is three-quarters fluted). The architectural members of this building were covered in light white plaster. The interior floor is of white pebbles, and, on the exterior, colours include black and red. Inside the building, a limestone base (0.6m x 0.82m x 0.14m) contains a void (0.41m in diameter, 0.25m deep) to hold an object now lost. Next to it is the base of an offering table with lion-paw feet (Fig. 55). Finds from building A include Classical sherds and part of a terracotta relief plaque with an armed Athena. In the fill of building T is small relief metope of a satyr. The presence of three monumental buildings on the platform indicates that this was a public area of as yet undetermined character.

Chatzi-Spiliopoulou (7th EPCA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 281) on work to conserve and lift the black and white geometric floor mosaic originally noted by N. Valmin in 1930. The original farmhouse within which the floor was discovered had been 55.

The decorated area and white surround, as well as the later floor in opus pseudospicatum, remained untouched by this new construction, although Roman antiquities must have been destroyed by its foundation. Both floors were conserved, and the mosaic lifted for eventual museum display. Kastania, Pyrgos Douraki. V. Albani (5th EBA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 263) on a study for the dismantling and re-erection in museum conditions of this five-storey 18th-century tower-residence. Excavation of the founda- tions of the ground floor at the east wall revealed untrimmed bedrock at a depth of only 0.25-0.3m. Investigation of the interior wall plaster on the first and second storeys revealed that the wall, of stones with a lime and red-earth binding, was originally left bare. Iklaina. M. Kosmopoulos (ASA) reports {Ergon [2009], 50-56) on a further season of excavation. The LHII or LHIIIA1 house B was built on the remains of earlier structures. House T had two phases. The first comprises three rooms, one of which contained a central hearth surrounded by four column bases. In the second, four small storerooms were built in the southern part of the structure, containing many LHIIIA2-B sherds of kylikes, skyphoi, pithoi and rhyta, figurines and animal bones. House A had three rooms, one of which contained many sherds and figurines. Pottery from this structure dates to LHIIIA1 to LHIIIB. Investigation of one of the two rooms of the newly-discovered house E showed it to date to LHIIIA2/B. A conduit originating in that room suggests that the structure was used as a workshop; there were three further channels. A long wall on the north side of the excavation area is likely part of a peribolos. At the northern end lay a room containing a cup and two kylikes: its walls were built into fill containing LHIIIA1-2 pottery. Below this fill was a deposit of sherds and burnt animal bone, as well as a large pithos set into the hard earth surface. A helmet was found close to the wall in 2008 and, in 2009, the skeleton of a 12-13-year-old female suffering from anaemia was also discovered. An approach route to the site was identified; pottery in the fill dates to the Late Helladic and to the fourth to third century BC, and an 8m x 12m paved area is also preserved. There are the foundations of at least five rooms with LHII-IIIA1 pottery, part of a terracotta offering table and fragments of wall-painting depicting buildings, women and men with a ship. To date, finds from Iklaina indicate a complex destroyed at the end of LHIIIB. Pylos, Palace of Nestor. S. Stocker and J. Davis (ASCSA) report on the 2009 study season. Human remains from Mycenaean chamber tombs at Kato Rouga in Chora and from a third tomb in the Kokkevis group at Kato Englianos were examined. Study of wall-plaster and floor-plaster continued, and documen- tation of all painted plaster remaining in situ in the palace was begun. Study of Byzantine artefacts from the Northeast Gateway was completed, as was examination of Middle Helladic pottery from the so-called Petropoulos Trench. Progress was made in the documentation of pottery from the Pantries, while documentation of artefacts from graves is nearing completion. Christianoupoli, Church of the Metamorphosis of the Saviour. V. Albani reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 263- 64) on excavation in connection with the second phase of an architectural study for the stabilization of this 11th- to 12th-century complex. In the bishop's residence, by the southwest wall of the church, lay a marble offering table, metal and glass objects, and part of a floor at a depth of 1.37m. In the northwest corner of the residence was a Macedonian bronze coin of the reign of Hadrian. Two graves with complete skeletons were found in the northeast corner of the church, along with scattered bone, a bronze ring, a coin and a pot. On the north side of the junction of the bishop's residence and the church was a cist grave with tile cover, a metal clasp, clay pot and stone cross. West of the main entrance to the church and by the south wall was a large limestone structure, plus fragments of sculpture, architec- tural spolia and a pot. In the northeast corner of the central transept was a child's grave with stone cover slabs, plus a metal item and decorated metal sheet. Finally, there were broad walls between the central, north and south apses of the sanctuary. ELEIA, including TRIPHYLIA (7th EPCA: 6th EBA) Prasidaki, Temple of Athena. X. Arapogianni reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 274) on continuing excavation. The entire colonnade (6 x 13 columns) was exposed. The temple measures 35.3m long x 15.58m wide, with the krepis well preserved in the northeast and northwest corners. On the east and north sides, the building was destroyed down to the stereobate. The destruction level, which was intact along the long sides of the temple, contained, in addition to the roof, parts of the geison, epistyle, and column capitals and drums. Along the northeast side, at the level of the first step of the krepis, a clay drain removed rain-water into a terracotta sink and thence away from the temple via a closed conduit. The column capitals date the temple to the first half of the fifth century: it continued in use into the first to second century AD, on the evidence of the pottery and lamps found in front of the cult statue base. Finds include decorated simas and tiles, and many terracotta and bronze figurines, found mainly around the outside of the temple. An orthostat set in front of the pronaos, inscribed A0ANAI, confirms the identity of the deity worshipped. Taxiarches (Mophtika). D. Athanasoulis (6th EBA) reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 369) a study of the post- Byzantine and later churches in the listed historical settlement of Taxiarches. Three small, single-roomed, wooden-roofed 19th- century churches are noted: Ag. Georgios, Ag, Theodoroi and the Church of the Panagia. The main church of the village and the location of the cemetery, the Church of the Dormition of the Virgin, is a one-roomed, wooden-roofed structure, with three semicircular apses in the east side. Outside the village is the ruined, single-roomed Church of the Ag. Apostolon with a semicircular apse. Kakovatos. B. Eder (DAI/Freiburg) reports on the first season of renewed fieldwork in 2009, to investigate the spatial extent, building types and chronological span of the Mycenaean settlement on the so-called acropolis.</page><page sequence="52">52 CATHERINE MORGAN A geodetic study produced a topographic plan of the Kakovatos area and a terrain model of the archaeological zone (Fig. 56). Geophysical survey aimed both to find evidence for ancient structures and to trace the areas excavated by Dorpfeld in 1907-1908. A geomagnetic survey was made of the entire archaeological zone, with geoelectric tomographic sections, mapping and 3D tomog- raphy then applied in selected areas. Ancient structures appear to be concentrated on the acropolis, with anomalies observed especially in the west part of the plateau (the location of walls M and N partially excavated by Dorpfeld). No evidence for ancient buildings was observed in the east of the acropolis or further downhill. Built structures were documented and systematic fieldwalking of the acropolis and its surroundings under- taken. Walls M and N on the acropolis were cleaned and recorded. The densest concentration of finds was in the west of the acropolis plateau, and, in general, the find distribution on the hill and its surroundings coincides with the results of the geophysical survey. The pottery, which continues from the Middle Bronze Age via Early Mycenaean to the Early Palatial period (LHIIIA), indicates a comparatively long occupation of the acropolis, covering a much broader spectrum than the finds from the tholos tombs. Agios Nikolaos, Triada. D. Athanasoulis (6th EBA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 374) on excavation to locate the remains of this church, northeast of the village of Triada and 1km east of the Middle Byzantine Church of the Panagia at Zourtsa (Nea Phigaleia), undertaken in response to a local request to build a new church on the site. The cruciform building was decorated with wall- paintings of which only traces survive. Around it and especially under the stone-paved floor were many cursorily-built graves (local inhabitants also report the discovery of tombs during the ploughing of neighbouring fields). Tombs were revealed outside the southeast corner of the building and in the south transept (under the floor along the south wall) during the initial earth-moving which led to the involvement of the 6th EBA, confirming the use of the site as a cemetery after the destruction of the church. Fourteen tombs were found during the excavation, half inside the church and half out, with a further five at least found by local inhabitants. Burials were made inside the church wherever the generally high bedrock allowed: the deceased were laid, head to the west, in natural depres- sions in the rock which were sometimes artificially enhanced, with rough cover slabs set over them. Limitations of space meant that interior burials overlapped. One child burial was found in the centre of the building. There are a few exceptions to the general lack of grave goods: a bronze fibula (tomb 8), iron shoe heels (tomb 13) and a small closed pot with incised decoration (tomb 14). In one case the face of the deceased was covered with a tile. Portable finds from the excavation are few: fragments of glass vessels and of bronze sheet from lamp handles and three coins (an aspron trachy of John II Comnenos from the mint of Thessaloniki, an imitation denier tournois and a Venetian colonial lira). A more recent inscribed grave stele was found close to the church. Triphylia. J. Heiden (DAI) reports on the fourth campaign of study at ancient Triphylia. 56. Kakovatos: terrain model showing visible architectural remains on the acropolis.</page><page sequence="53">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 53 Resistivity survey at Makistos revealed a rectilinear grid which may be the street system of a Classical polis. A main street and a narrower side street are visible. At Samikon, the 1:1,000 plan was corrected and individual buildings mapped at 1:50. Based on a 3D laser scan, elevations of two towers of the city wall were drawn. Tower 6, east of the acropolis, was recorded. No pre- fourth-century BC pottery was found apart from two Middle Helladic sherds below the acropolis. At Platiana, the city plan was completed and building plans at 1:50 begun. The city wall and its towers, a large public building (perhaps the bouleuterion) and the theatre plateau were examined (Fig. 57). No pre-fourth-century BC pottery was found. Samikon and Platiana were appar- ently new foundations of the Triphylian League. At Lepreon, buildings were recorded at 1:50. Study focused on a tower on the west wall and on the two northern towers on the east wall and the wall between them. In the ancient settlement near Vrestos, the near circular city wall (with 11 towers) and all visible architecture in the inner city were recorded at 1:1,000. Much coarse pottery, very little fineware and a clay grill were collected. A funerary monument was found outside the city. In Anilio, work began on a fort-like complex above the modern village, described by Dorpfeld as a Mycenaean ruler's seat, but probably much later in date. A large foundation, probably of a temple, was cleared. Surface sherds date from the Late Archaic to the Hellenistic period. Aspra Spitia (Tourla). X. Arapogianni reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 272, 274) on continuing excavation. Mycenaean and Middle Helladic sherds plus fossilized bone were collected, the wall of a Middle Helladic building, with much Middle Helladic pottery, located, and Classical sherds found in certain upper levels. A prehistoric stone chisel was handed to the author- ities {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 283). Olympia, Sanctuary of Zeus. R. Senff (DAI) reports on continuing excavation in the southeast complex and geophysical survey in the area of the ancient hippodrome, undertaken in 2009. In the so-called southeast complex, the ancient layers immediately adjacent to the external wall were well- preserved, had not been washed away by the river and extended east at increasing depth, their slope indicating a shoreline escarpment. The wall, of rough limestone blocks and large river pebbles, shows several building phases. Excavation halted ca. 2m below the surface due to the unusually high water table, although pottery and metal objects indicate that stereo was not reached. There may be an infilled well in the northern half of the sounding, as the area contained a near complete Late Archaic kylix and a complete bronze cauldron lying upside down. Upon restoration, the cauldron proved to contain a bronze Corinthian helmet with deliberately bent cheek-guards (Fig. 58). In sounding Q 08.3, fifth-century BC layers contained fineware and coarseware sherds, as well as many bones, scorched tile fragments and metal objects. The debris covered a large, shallow basin-like pit, its walls reinforced with broken tile and covered with a reddish lime mortar, which may be connected with building work or a potter's workshop. 57. Triphylia, Platiana: theatre stage building. Geophysical survey south and east of the stadium was continued, with the additional use of geoelectrics. The visible structures cannot securely be connected with any ancient remains. Five test trenches dug in the locations of anomalies noted in 2008 revealed only natural soil and gravel layers. The exact position and shape of the hippo- drome therefore remain unclear. Further profiles were measured south of the Leonidaion, where the agora may be located according to Pausanias. Scant indications of ancient building remains were found. Further evidence of architecture was encountered on the slopes of the Kronion, northeast of the gymnasion. A project to re-erect the north column of the Ptolemaic dedication in front of the Echo Hall was begun in 2009. Specialist reports were completed, and first samples for the cleaning of stones and plaster casts of the broken surfaces on the column drums taken. 58. Olympia, Sanctuary of Zeus: bronze cauldron with Corinthian helmet.</page><page sequence="54">54 CATHERINE MORGAN Olympia, Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore. Ch. Liangouras (7th EPCA) reports (AAA 40-41 [2007-2008], 61-74) the discovery of a large building (A) and a Roman bath in a Sanctuary of Demeter 130m northeast of the ancient stadium. Excavation followed the discovery in 2006 of a wall, domestic pottery and two bronze Late Roman coins in the course of trenching for the Erymanthos-Pyrgos water-supply project. Building A (oriented east-west) was constructed in local limestone in the early fifth century BC and is preserved to foundation level. It is divided into four rooms, and likely served some cult function: a stone feature in the centre of room 1 may be an altar (surrounded by votives) and in the northwest of the room a limestone structure with a deep square cutting likely served as a repository. There was at least one episode of fire destruction, and evidence of continued cult activity and construction in the area down to the second to fourth century AD. Small finds include 34 bronze coins of the fifth to fourth century BC, and many terracotta figures and figurines of varying sizes depicting mainly human, female, subjects, but also animals, especially bovines and caprids, silens and masks. One unusual terracotta figure depicts a two-headed Kerberos with sacrificial cakes in its mouth. Another is inscribed: [AA]MATPI KOP[A] [BAJIIAEI A Roman bath lay 25m to the east: two rooms of the hypocaust and part of a cistern were revealed. The sanctuary may be that of Demeter Chamyne identified by Pausanias (6.21.1-2). Vartholomio. In the course of inspection along the coast of Arkoudi, an ancient limestone quarry was located and fragments of tile and a few, probably Roman, sherds, collected (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 282). Koskina, Lakkopholia. O. Vikatou (7th EPCA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 276) the excavation of a further tholos tomb at a site where six such tombs were previously found (see ADelt 25 [1970] Chr, 193; ADelt 49 [1994] Chr , 194). The dromos was excavated in 1998 (see ADelt 53 [1998] Chr , 230) and the rectangular chamber dug in 2000. The tomb, oriented east-west, had been robbed in antiquity. Close to the north wall were a few bones, a cup sherd and a bronze cup. In addition, a few bones were found in the two eastern corners of the chamber. Three pits were dug into the floor on the main axis of the tomb. The first contained a burial without goods. The second was empty and the third, which preserved its cover slab, again held a single burial without goods. Three spindle- whorls were found in the tomb. The very few objects found date from LHIIB (the bronze cup) to LHIIIA2 (sherds of a stirrup jar and rounded alabastron). Chance finds delivered to the authorities comprise a sealstone and whorl, part of a stirrup jar and three Mycenaean sherds (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 281). Trypes, Kladeos. O. Vikatou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 277) the resumption of rescue excavation in the Mycenaean cemetery (see ADelt 19 [1964] Chr , 177; ADelt 53 [1998] Chr , 230-33). Excavation was completed in the dromos of tomb 8, where sherds of a large amphora with an ekphora scene were previously found. The dromos had already been partly destroyed by the farm track which runs next to the cemetery. Two empty niches were found, one in each wall. In chamber tomb 12, a niche in the west wall of the dromos contained bones gathered from earlier burials. In the orthogonal sunken chamber were at least eight burials in the northwest, two burials side by side in the north and a further pair, one over the other, along the east wall. Grave goods comprise two large four-handled jars, eight stirrup jars, a straight-sided alabastron, a spouted cup, a two-handled amphora, two lekythoi, a small hydria, a small jug, seven whorls, four beads, fragments of bronze, sherds and two black steatite sealstones. In the western part of the chamber, a pit in the floor with a slab cover contained one burial without goods. One further pit in the southwest part of the tomb, beneath the burials, contained a contracted skeleton but no grave goods. Both pits were oriented north-south. The tomb was used from LHIIIA-C. Chamber tomb 13, in the far north of the cemetery, is the largest investigated and the richest, at least in terms of pottery (Fig. 59). Ninety two (mostly large) vessels date to LHIIIB and (mostly) LHIIIC. The upper part of the sunken, oval chamber was largely destroyed, but although the closing wall was displaced, the tomb had not been looted. The exact number of burials cannot be established because the skeletons had disintegrated. Finds comprise 27 (mostly large) four-handled jars, 39 stirrup jars (many large), five straight-sided alabastra, two pyxides, a spouted cup, five lekythoi, five small jugs, a bird-shaped askos, a composite vase, a collar-necked jar, an askoid vessel, a ring vase, three amphoriskoi, a bronze razor, a terracotta figurine, glass paste beads and five spindle- whorls. 59. Trypes Kladeos: chamber tomb 13. Four pits were dug into the chamber floor, two in front of the entrance and two in the northern part of the chamber. Pit 1, missing its cover slab, contained one inhumation with additional bone and four crania above it. One vessel and one whorl likely belong to the first burial. Pit 2, in front of the chamber entrance, was an ossuary with a cover slab preserved. Amidst the bone inside it were three spindle-whorls, sherds, a sard bead and a steatite bead with zig-zag line decoration. Pit 3, in the northwestern part of the chamber, contained cranial fragments and two spindle- whorls. Pit 4, with the cover slabs preserved, contained one disintegrated burial.</page><page sequence="55">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 55 Finds from the dromos are of particular interest. Apart from sherds in the fill, seven figurines, including a kourotrophos and a bovine, were found close to the northeast angle, together with the round base on which they sat. Two pit graves lay alongside the side walls of the dromos. Pit grave 9 lay close to the surface beside the west wall. Lacking its cover slabs, it contained only a few bones and a fragment of kylix base and stem. Pit grave 10, opposite grave 9 along the east wall, was very similar; it contained two burials, one over the other. Further chamber and pit tombs were located: excavation continues. Kaukanias, Gouvia (N. Milios property). X. Arapogianni reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 271) the discovery of a destroyed stone cist tomb with a tile cover. This contained a single inhumation, head to west, with a Roman prochous. A Middle Helladic sherd was found near the village water-supply line. Lalas. D. Athanasoulis reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 369) documentation of the Trani Vrysi and the Trypia Vrysi, typical fountains of the late Ottoman period. The Trani Vrysi consists of a built domed cistern with two monolithic spouts on its fagade, beneath a shallow, protruding stone arch. The Trypia Vrysi is also a cistern but with a deeper arch on its fagade; it is built of worked limestone blocks. Daphniotissa, Church of the Panagia. D. Athanasoulis reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 373-74) a small supple- mentary excavation and study of the finds from previous excavation (see ADelt 53 [1998] Chr , 309-10). Tile graves without goods were revealed on the hill on which the church is built, especially on the south slope. One grave, close to the apse of the church, contained a child burial. Pit graves were also excavated inside the narthex, below the floor of the main sanctuary. In the south corner of the narthex, in the same level of bones, was part of a vessel with 12th to 13th century AD Protogeometric decoration. From the same area come a 12th-century fine sgraffito cup, sherds of late glazed wares both plain and incised, part of a cup with an incised fish, a maiolica jug, fragments of glass vessels and iron nails, probably from the roof. Coins are late in date: a copy of a Venetian tornesello found in the west of the narthex and a Venetian silver soldino. In the surface level in the narthex was an Ottoman silver coin pierced for secondary use as a personal ornament. A small lead cross was found outside the southwest corner of the west wall, as well as the stone base of a press. Agios Ilias Pinias. X. Arapogianni reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 271) the discovery of two looted, probably Early Christian graves (one pit and one cist) in the course of investigation following illegal excavation at Ag. Dimitrios, beside the Pinios Dam. Agrapidochori, Kotrona. X. Arapogianni reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 272-73) the investigation of two chamber tombs following illegal excavation at a site where a chamber tomb had previously been discovered. In both cases, the dromos was cut by the modern farm road and could not be investigated. Tomb 1, exposed by the illegal excavation, had been completely looted. Oriented north-south with the entrance to the south, the chamber was oval and the stomion closed with a dry-stone wall. Scattered bone and sherds were recovered, from which two LHIIIA1 stirrup jars were restored. The chamber of tomb 2 escaped illegal excavation. Sited west of tomb 1, it adjoins its chamber and is on the same orientation. The stomion was closed by a dry-stone wall. The oval chamber contained five burials plus one displaced. The first burial on the east side of the chamber had three amphorae and a straight-sided alabastron, inside which was a miniature jug, plus a further alabastron. At the feet were two more alabastra, a stirrup jar, a ring vase, a jar, two faience beads and a straight-sided alabastron. The second burial, next to the first, had a ring vase and two stirrup jars on each side of the cranium, and by the right side two stirrup jars, a lekythos and parts of a bronze and bone pin. The third burial, on the north side of the chamber, had completely disintegrated. At head-level were a lekythos, three stirrup jars and two amphorae (Fig. 60). The cranium of the fourth skeleton was found on the west side of the chamber with two stirrup jars and a spouted cup; that of the fifth was on the northwest side. An ossuary pit (containing bone, a bone pin and three glass and faience beads) lay on the north side of the chamber opposite the stomion. Two vessels could not be associated with individual burials - a two-handled amphora from the southwest of the chamber and an alabastron beside the stomion. The tomb was used from LHIIIA2 to LHIIIC1. Goumero, Kamini. X. Arapogianni reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 272) the chance discovery of a burial pithos at Kamini (Kastro). The pithos (oriented northeast- southwest, with a sandstone cover) contained one burial without grave goods. At Kapoutsi, a destroyed pit grave was found on the north side of a farm track; a few undiag- nostic sherds were collected from it. A large bronze Mycenaean sword (M2271), 0.59m long, was handed to the authorities (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 283). Moni Askiti. D. Athanasoulis describes (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 369) an abandoned hermitage in a rock-shelter, dedicated to the laying down of the girdle of the Virgin. The entrance wall had a doorway and two windows; part of a Middle Byzantine marble epistyle from a templon was built into a niche above the gate. Deep inside, a rockfall had destroyed the large Middle Byzantine domed church. Alonia, Elis. O. Vikatou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 276) the discovery of a fifth-century BC pithos burial in the course of drainage work. The pithos (oriented north-south, with the mouth to the north, covered by a slab) contained three skeletons and a range of goods which cannot be assigned to any individual burial. These comprise a skyphos, a black- glazed hydria, two Attic lekythoi, two stemless cups, a phiale, a squat lekythos, a pointed amphoriskos, a bronze bracelet and bronze fibula and pin (Fig. 61).

Agrapidochori, Kotrona: pottery from burial 3 in chamber tomb 2. 61. Alonia, Elis: selection of pottery from fifth-century pithos burial. Toumbes (or Pleures), east of Markopoulos. The discovery was made in the course of sand extraction and the damage caused by the digger made it impossible to establish the number of tombs present. In the process of cutting a plateau into the lower slopes of the hill, the digger removed almost all of the dromos and chamber of a chamber tomb. The surviving part consists of the north wall and part of a burial pit containing bones over which were placed a stirrup jar and a ring vase. Some 2m away were three courses of a dry-stone wall from the entrance of another chamber tomb. While the dromos was completely destroyed, the oval chamber survived intact. To the right of the door, in the east of the chamber, lay bones displaced to the north and a burial along the side wall, the latter with two stirrup jars, two ring vases and a handmade cup. Finds date the tombs to LHIIIC. Bone and sherds were scattered across the entire area. Xenies. D. Athanasoulis reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 369) a study of the Church of the Panagia in the abandoned settlement of Xenies. The church, which has a tripartite apse on the east side, was founded in 1873, according to a stone inscription on the south wall. Inside is a carved wooden templon and a wooden ceiling with figurative carving. Vrina (Daphni) (G. Lambropoulos property). O. Vikatou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 275-76) the discovery of a large, stepped retaining wall close to previ- ously excavated cist tombs ca. 3km southeast of the village of Vrina (see ADelt 45 [1990] Chr , 119-20). The TT-shaped wall, of well-worked conglomerate blocks, was built against the edge of a low hill and likely formed a monumental fagade for two Early Hellenistic tombs behind it. Cist tomb 1 (oriented east-west) lay 4.4m inside the inner face of the wall, to the east. It was built of</page><page sequence="57">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 57 re-used masonry, and contained two burials plus a fragmentary vessel and a pointed amphora. Tomb 2, 1.8m away, was completely destroyed. Only a cranium, a fragmentary large vessel and a lamp were found. Excavation revealed no further burials inside the wall. Traces of further buildings in the wider area include foundations damaged by cultivation. Sherds were collected from the hilltop and upper slopes, but no further architecture was found there, probably due to cultivation and repeated landscaping. Daphni. X. Arapogianni reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 270-71) the discovery of two collapsed tholos tombs in the course of work on the rural road to the south of the Mycenaean cemetery at Lakkathela (Fig. 62). Tomb 14 lies 8.05m south of tomb 11, with the entrance to the east. The chamber is oval and the dromos slightly sloping. The chamber contained a single interment with, gathered together at one side, a cup, an alabastroid shape, an alabastron and a jar, which date the tomb to LHIIIA1. Tomb 15 lies 0.6m from the end of the dromos of tomb 9, with the entrance to the east. The large oval chamber is preserved to a height of 3.9m; the dromos slopes down steeply towards the stomion. The chamber contained four burials - three gathered on the south side and the fourth on the north. Two of the three were supine and the third was contracted, with around it two alabastra, an alabastron-like form, a stone and a terracotta weight, and a sard bead. The fourth body had at the feet an alabastron. The tomb dates to LHIIIA2 to LHIIIC. Kalyvia Ilidos (M. Sabaniotis property). X.

The porch (with its collapsed stone surround) was in the middle of the west wall; in a latter phase this was walled up. There were two smaller entrances in the middle of the north side and the east end of the south. Robbed cist tombs were found along the long sides of the building, and in the fill between them bone, and bronze and iron spurs. A large number of fragments of decorated glass collected from the tombs come from the church glassworks. More recent pit graves were investigated under the church floor and in the destruction fill of the church. Thirteenth- and 14th-century Italian glazed pottery is prominent among the portable finds. Kyllini Karavaki. D. Athanasoulis (6th EBA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 373) the cleaning of a probable kiln, of uncertain date, which had been severely damaged by the construction of the road from Kastro to Kyllini. Manolada, Church of the Palaiopanagia. M. Georgopoulou-Verra (6th EBA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 362-63) a study to locate evidence for wall-painting in the central part of the church, especially the west and south transept walls and vaults (the east having been inves- tigated in 1999), and the dome. In the south vault, as in earlier work on the angles of the dome, two layers of decoration can be detected, in a poor state of preservation. On the side walls of the south vault are mounted military saints on the east side and, on the west, scenes from the cycle of the Passion. ACHAEA (6th EPCA: 6th EBA) Santameri M. Georgopoulou-Verra (6th EBA) notes new studies of chapels in two caves on Mount Skollis {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 365-66). Cave of Agios Georgios. A study of the wall- paintings in two small chapels (of the Virgin and of Ag. Georgios) in this cave, on the northeast side of the mountain near Portes, reveals the use of two distinct styles. The first is closest to a good regional style of the mid 13th century with Comnenan technical influences and the second is a cruder, more popular style of approximately the same period. Cave of the Theotokos. Within this remote cave near the top of the mountain, behind and below a wide entrance area, a small church is founded on bedrock. It probably had an artificial roof in antiquity as today. A full description is given of the rich and well-preserved cycle of wall-paintings. While certain scenes (notably the Deisis) are executed in the fine Comnenan style used in the Cave of Ag. Georgios and may be by the same painter, the popular style is more common here. The paintings in the two churches are probably contemporary, and show similar subjects and use of colour. Three small and misspelled inscriptions offer a further connection. The cave continues west of the church, with two chambers (2m and 3.5m below the level of the church), invisible from the cave entrance, likely used to accommodate hermits. Vrachnaiika Sageikon (V. Papadopoulou property). A. Vasilogamvrou (then 6th EPCA, now Director, 5th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 318) the discovery of a small basement. Debris of fire destruction inside included stones, part of a stone mill, Laconian roof tile and a few sherds dating the event to the Early or Middle Hellenistic period. Araxos, Teichos Dymaion. M. Gkazis (6th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 318) on the third season of cleaning and conservation on the prehistoric acropolis. The founda- tions of five buildings of probable Hellenistic and later date were revealed following tree felling and clearance in the area around the acropolis. Within the acropolis, removal of accumulated fills around the middle tower revealed the foundations of a rectangular construction built while the acropolis was under military occupation and incorporating walling from a probable medieval precursor on the same site. Kato Achaia (ancient Dyme) Vigla (V. Lagou and A. Sparaki property). A. Vasilogamvrou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 308) the discovery of a stretch of the city wall on the northeast edge of the ancient city. Founded on bedrock, the wall is mostly built of fired brick with a stone facing on the south side, and is protected by a tiled roof. Asimakopoulou Street (Ch. Kokkinou property). A. Vasilogamvrou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 308) the discovery of a Hellenistic building complex. Late third- century BC pottery was found in and around the walls: pottery in the destruction deposits consists mostly of large vessels of the same period. At the southern edge of plot was the north face of another building of the same date and construction. Classical pottery was found below the foundations of the buildings. Daskalopoulou Street (O.T. 115, S. Kolila property). A. Vasilogamvrou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 309-11) the discovery of a Classical building with a pebble floor. Classical pottery was found inside the building and together with shell in deposits immediately over stereo to the east and northwest. A pithos containing olive pits lay in the northeast corner of the plot. A deposit of Archaic pottery was found in a deeper level at the east edge of the excavation. Daskalopoulou Street (O.T. 115 and 116). A. Vasilogamvrou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 311) the discovery of two Hellenistic walls and a pit containing a dense fill of tile and Classical pottery (with a probable second such nearby). Pausaniou and Aristainetou Streets (Th. China property). A. Vasilogamvrou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 311-14) the discovery of Hellenistic cisterns founded in a Classical level (which contained fifth- to fourth- century red-figure sherds, as well as phialae, lekythoi, kotylae, kylikes, plates, lamps, kothons and many miniature vessels and figurines). One cistern was built in the Early Hellenistic and repaired in the Middle Hellenistic: another was built in the Middle Hellenistic, cutting into a pithos which served as a reservoir in both phases. At least four water channels were found in the southeast: one connects with either the pithos or the adjacent cistern and the other three with a small third cistern. Other constructions include a substantial wall, buttressed on the west face, which was built in the</page><page sequence="59">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 59 Early Hellenistic and continued in use into the Middle Hellenistic (two second half third-century BC vessels were found at its north end) and, to the north, a hearth. During the Roman period, a pebble floor covered the third cistern and the hearth. To the south, a destruction level over the area of the water channels contained second-century AD pottery. Parodos Platonos (M. Kourousia property). A. Vasilogamvrou (then 6th EPCA, now Director, 5th EPCA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 314-16) the discovery of two potter's kilns in the northwest of the town, in an area where kilns had previously been discovered. Investigation focused on the southern part of a group of kilns which lies mostly under the modern road north of the Leivada property (see ADelt 53 [1998] Chr , 269-72). One large kiln (5.3m long) had three construction phases. In phase 1, the round chamber (3.5m interior diameter, maximum preserved height 1.5m) was cut into the natural clay and the walls built of tile packed with clay. Four successive layers of clay coated the interior. The floor covered an older pit full of tile fragments, lumps of burnt clay and plaster. Fragments of the support arches for the eschara were found, but not in situ. At a later date, the firing chamber was reduced (to 3m x 3m) by the construction of facing walls of tiles, kiln arch fragments and brick on the west and north sides. The floor was raised by 0.2m. The stomion remained unchanged, being founded at a higher level than both chambers. Both the initial construction and the modification fall within the Hellenistic period. In the final phase, the firing chamber was squared by the construction of two tile and brick walls in opus mixtum , and the eschara supported on a central column. The old stomion was closed and a new arched tile construction opened at the south. This stomion ends in an area bounded to the west by a wall of the same construction. The stomion of a second kiln identified on this property (but not excavated) also ends in this area. 59 Araxou Street (A. Barouni property). A. Vasilogamvrou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 316) a collection of stones and tiles from a Hellenistic construction probably destroyed in antiquity. Aristainetou Street (O.T. 273, P. Agapidi property). A. Vasilogamvrou and G. Alexopoulou (6th EPCA) report ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 317) the discovery of Hellenistic and Roman building remains. A rectangular room contained much Late Classical to Hellenistic (third- to second-century) pottery, probably from a pit in the centre. To the west, this is bordered by a poorly-built construction (with evidence of a second such). In the northwest was a Late Roman pebble and tile floor with walls to the north and south. Alkyes, Bostani. A. Vasilogamvrou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 316-17) on trial excavation at this coastal site 2km north of ancient Dyme. Two successive east-west walls of limestone blocks ran approximately parallel to the shoreline. A Broneer XV lamp (first century AD) lay above one block and Classical and Late Hellenistic to Early Roman sherds were found within the fill of the upper wall. A destruction deposit covered a compacted clay level inside the wall. To the southwest, further from the sea, were more sections of wall of different construction and founded at different depths. Next to one north-south wall, a destruction deposit contained tile and sherds of large Late Hellenistic to Early Roman domestic vessels. Immediately beneath the topsoil was a small concentration of tile and large vessel sherds, and elsewhere a destruction level and a part of a pebble pavement. Occupation coincides with that at Dyme, with which the site is in visual contact. While hard to characterize, activity here may be significant in the light of Strabo's description (8.7.5) of Dyme as a harbourless city. Katarraktis. G. Alexopoulou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 306-08) on finds made in the course of widening the road from Patras via Chalandritsa to Kalavryta. Bakalarou (Ch. Chamouza property). A group of three pithos burials on a low plateau to the left of the road to Kalavryta was located. Pithos I (oriented west- southwest-east-northeast, with a slab over the mouth) contained a Late Geometric krateriskos (Fig. 63). Pithos II lay west of pithos I on the same orientation but with the vessel mouths together. It was empty, but a black-glazed sherd of 325-300 BC lay outside it. Pithos III (oriented east-west), south of pithos I, contained no grave goods. A Hellenistic structure west of the pithoi is probably a farmstead. Two further pithoi (oriented west-southwest- east-northeast) were found 200m east of the first group, beside the road. Neither contained grave goods. 63. Katarraktis, Bakalarou: Late Geometric krateriskos from pithos I. Rizes (O. Diamanti field). West of Bakalarou, on the outskirts of Mirali, to the left of the road to Kalavryta, lie scattered orthostates, Laconian roof tiles and Hellenistic sherds. Skala (Karelia brothers' property). In the course of deforestation 300m east of Bakalarou, three vessels were found (including a prochous and a tear-bottle). Three tile graves were investigated. Tomb I (oriented northeast- southwest) covered a cremation with two broken vessels outside. Tomb II (oriented east-west) contained traces of a cremation and an iron object. Tomb III (oriented northeast-southwest) contained a supine inhumation with an undecorated unguentarium outside the tomb.</page><page sequence="60">60 CATHERINE MORGAN Xerokambos. G. Alexopoulou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 343) the discovery of four pithos burials during the digging of a ditch. They were arranged in a group, 3m apart, and oriented north-northeast-south-southwest. Pithos I contained a single burial with a plain black oinochoe, two bronze spirals and a ring, all dated to the Protogeometric period. Only the lower parts of the others survive. Phileika Kalyvia (Chasna). G. Alexopoulou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 343-44) the discovery beside the road from Patras to Tripolis via Tripotama of architectural remains and scattered Archaic(?) and Hellenistic pottery and tile. Two tile graves were found during the opening of a drainage channel, oriented north-south, plus Roman sherds. Kameniani, Panagia. G. Alexopoulou (6th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 344) two cist tombs, without goods, by the approach into the village. Kleitor G. Alexopoulou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 343) finds at four sites in this area. S. Douklia and A. Raptou property. Early Hellenistic sherds were found to the north and just outside the archaeological site of Kleitor. G. Papagiannopoulou property. Early Hellenistic sherds were found inside the settlement of Kleitor. Kleitor, archaeological site. After flooding of the river Karnesios, sections of ancient wall collapsed. Fourth-century sherds, sherds of a Hellenistic vessel and a bronze mirror were collected. Kotrones (Planatos). Northeast of Kleitor and west of the village of Tourlada, Roman walls and a potter's kiln, plus Hellenistic sherds, were exposed in a drainage channel. Mygdalia. L. Papazoglou-Manioudaki (National Archaeological Museum) reports on the second season of excavation at the Mycenaean settlement in 2009. Mygdalia is a naturally fortified hill bordered to the east and west by the rivers Philiouras and Xeropotamos. Previous discoveries include Geometric pithos burials and a LHIIB-IIIA1 tholos on the west slope of the hill. Mycenaean cemeteries are known immediately to the east at Koukouri (Achaia Clauss) and the west at Krini. Settlement covers ca. 6,500m2 over three terraces. Terrace 3 is supported from the southeast by a wall of large roughly-cut stones, now partly covered by a dry-stone wall. Parts of two earlier retaining walls lie beneath it. Sixty metres away on the southwest slope is a collapsed apsidal built grave. Only tiny sherds and animal bones were found in the mixed fill partly covering it: stones from the tumulus are visible outside. The settlement spans the Early Mycenaean to the end of LHIIIC. Surface finds on terrace 2 include part of a LHIIIC bovine figurine with linear decoration. A strong exterior wall, incorporating huge boulders, had collapsed in an earthquake: sherds in the fill include LHIIIB and C deep bowls. A pithos in front of the house entrance, plus LHIIICL sherds, date the final destruction and abandonment of the building. Fill inside a large room contained mixed Early to Late Mycenaean sherds, but the floor layers date to the Early Mycenaean. Finds include a stone axe-hammer (a rarity in mainland settlement contexts). Another wall of thin, almost rectangular, stones defines a semi-open space to the south of the building where the cutting back of the bedrock may denote a small courtyard. Abundant transitional MH/LHI domestic pottery in foundation strata, including matt-painted stemmed goblets and amphora handles, dates the construction to the Early Mycenaean: it remained in use over a long period. A small steatite disc may have been a balance weight or a game piece. Another building inside a strong retaining wall lay 1.5m to the east. Both structures follow the northwest- southeast orientation of the building(s) excavated in 2008. Inside, over the dirt floor, was a LHIIICL destruction deposit containing stones, pithos and domestic ware sherds, a bronze knife, spools, spindle-whorls, loomweights, whetstones and animal bones. The absence of burning or any other sign of violence suggests that the building was abandoned voluntarily or after an earthquake. The building had two main rooms: the north remained unexcavated but the south was further divided into two by a new cross wall. A handmade cooking jug (Fig. 64) and a pithoid jar were found in situ. Pottery dates mainly to the Early Mycenaean. Finally, Late Geometric sherds (including a pyxis) were found in a trench dug into the building in the eighth century BC. 64. Mygdalia: cooking jug from the east building. Excavation on the summit exposed three rounded stone column bases (two of which were in situ). A number of large, roughly rectangular, stone slabs may belong to a portico or a colonnade. To the northwest were the founda- tions of a prominent rectangular building: in the middle of one of the rooms is a flattened stone which may have supported a wooden column. The date of the complex remains unclear (the few sherds collected span the Mycenaean to Geometric period). A few Archaic tile fragments were found nearby on terrace 1 during the 2008 survey.</page><page sequence="61">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 61 Ovrya, Messatls (Philothei settlement), 6 Athanasiou Diakou Street. M. Petropoulos (then Director, 6th EPCA, now Director, 39th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 303-04) the discovery of a rectangular vat from a press, with four steps inside and a rounded hollow in the base. This must belong to a farmstead yet to be located. The press was built in the early first century AD and destroyed in the second century. The vat was then re-used and walls built around it. Further Roman walls remain to be investigated. Krini, Messatis M. Petropoulos and G. Alexopoulou report ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 304-05) the following discoveries at locations around Krini. Psarades (D. Karydi property): an undatable semicircular retaining(?) wall. The site is close to a previ- ously excavated Mycenaean cemetery. Voudousa: a tile grave (oriented east-west) containing a supine inhumation, head to west, without grave goods. Northwest of the tomb were mixed human bones. The site is 600m northeast of the Mycenaean cemetery noted above. A. Paraskevopoulou property: Hellenistic founda- tions plus a few third-century BC sherds. D. Drimala property: Early Hellenistic walls plus second half fourth- to third-century BC sherds. Settlement of Monodendri (S. Karabasi property): three stone enclosure walls (plus evidence of an earlier construction phase) and fourth- to third-century BC sherds. E. Sgoura property: two burial pithoi with slab covers, oriented north-northeast-south-southwest. Pithos 1 contained a disarticulated skeleton without grave goods. Pithos 2 was empty. G. Pagoulatou property: mid third- to mid second- century BC and Roman sherds, and a series of roughly worked stones. Saravali, Messatis (I. Karachaliou property). G. Alexopoulou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 305) the discovery of second half fourth- to late third-century BC and Roman sherds. Kallithea, Messatis (A. Papadopoulou and G. Thanopoulou property). G. Alexopoulou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 306) the discovery of Laconian tile fragments and undiagnostic coarse sherds. Riganokambos (junction 4-5 of the Patras by-pass). G. Alexopoulou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 306) the discovery of a Late Roman farmstead in a semi- mountainous location next to the Diakoniari river (the first to be found in such a location). The building, entered from the west, had three large rectangular areas with thick walls. The destruction deposit contains, in addition to Laconian roof tiles and iron nails probably from the roof, four bronze coins (a fifth- to sixth- century AD minimus, two badly-worn AES4 and an AES3 of Theodosius II from the mint of Cyzicus, of the VOT/X/MVLT/XX type). Pottery spans the fourth century BC to the fifth century AD. Two earlier construction phases, Roman and Late Classical, are evident. Petroto, banks of the Glaukos river (junction 5 of the Patras by-pass). G. Alexopoulou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 306) a section of early Ottoman road and a Roman cobbled road surface, both now within the river bank. The Roman road was likely a main route into inland Achaea. Ano Petroto, Chapel of the Pantokrator(?). A. Koumousi reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 373) on excavation conducted 1.5km outside the village, to the left of the road to Kalavryta, where local tradition locates the Chapel of the Pantokrator. A single-roomed stone structure with a paved floor had a three-sided apse and a built templon. Ottoman houses were found in the same area, along with a two-storey inn preserving tethering posts for horses. Patras Aiolou Street 8-14-16 (Georgiou brothers property). E.-I. Kolia and G. Alexopoulou (6th EPCA) report (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 291-93) the discovery of fragmentary remains of many periods. A large well (1.67m in diameter) in the southwest corner of the plot partially destroyed a Roman wall and water channel. The well was filled with post-Byzantine pottery. To the east, three Roman water channels ran northwest-southeast, and east of these again is a large wall on the same orientation, with two, Late Hellenistic and Roman, phases. This wall adjoins a Hellenistic basement storeroom with a stone-paved floor and access steps at the east, which is divided into two rooms. This shows the same two building phases as the large wall. A pit along the north wall of the west room, which contained Late Hellenistic to Early Roman pottery, postdates the first phase. In the southwest, a Hellenistic cobbled road (4.5m wide, crossed by a sewer line and a water channel) ran north-south. This road was abandoned in the third century AD when a building bordering it to the west was remod- elled. East of the road were two buildings separated by a lane across which ran a water channel. The building to the north contained two rooms with floor mosaics, plus a further two rooms to the north. West of the road, the front part of a third building with two rooms was exposed. In the fourth to fifth century AD, this area was probably given over to workshops (noting the existence of many water channels). Portable finds include many spindle- whorls and coins. 2 Panachaikou Street and Psila Alonia (G. Nikoletatou property). G. Alexopoulou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 293) the discovery of Hellenistic and Roman buildings during the enlargement of a house basement. In the northeast of the basement were Hellenistic walls of large upright slabs. Two rooms (plus two parallel walls and a tiled cistern) form part of a Roman building previously exposed west of the road (ADelt 28 [1973] Chr, 225-26). On the north side of the basement, a tile grave (oriented northeast-southwest) contained two interments and a glass tear-bottle. Both tile and cist graves have previously been found on the neighbouring plot to the north (Panachaikou 4-6: ADelt 29 [1973-1974] Chr, 374). 19-21 Lodou Street. A. Koumousi reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 372) the discovery of architectural remains (two spaces defined by crudely-constructed walls and a conduit running north-south). Finds include part of a marble architectural member with relief floral decoration, decorated metal sheet (possibly Ottoman) and five bronze coins including a Venetian gazzetta of the Isole type and a Frankish tournois.</page><page sequence="62">62 CATHERINE MORGAN 26 Papadiamantopoulou Street.

Alexopoulou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 293) the discovery of Byzantine water channels, two parallel Roman walls (2.2m apart) with red-painted plaster and Early Roman sherds between them, and an angle of two walls in opus testaceum. 170 Germanou and Palaiologou Streets. A. Koumousi reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 372) the discovery of a cist tomb inside a walled area. The structure incorporates re-used material including a Roman soft limestone angle block with carved decoration on three faces. Within the tomb was a second tile grave with a single burial. Two later walls were found in the northeast corner of the plot. Finds comprise a terracotta bread stamp, part of a white marble kioniskos, a bronze ring and 10 bronze coins (including two Venetian torneselli). S. Theocharopoulou Street - 65-67 A. Photila Street -V. Rouphou Street (A. Kaphetzi property). G. Alexopoulou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 293-94) the discovery of two Late Roman buildings in opus mixtum on either side of a lane. Their foundations destroyed earlier buildings: below that level were two Early Hellenistic walls. Portable finds include 13 bronze coins, a limestone column base, fragments of Corinthian tile and brick, and Early Roman sherds. The area continued in use into the Byzantine period. 104-06 Boukaouri Street (Amitsi property). L. Papakosta (6th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 294- 97) the continuation of a Roman cobbled road previously discovered to the north (120 Boukaouri Street: ADelt 52 [1997] Chr, 275-76) (Fig. 65). In the road surface were two terracotta pipes and a lead drinking-water pipe, and below these, the main sewer line. Along the length of the road to the east were three adjacent rooms of a hypocaust which probably forms part of a larger public bath complex (noting previous discoveries at 101 Boukaouri Street: ADelt 53 [1998] Chr, 256). The building was used continuously from the Early to Late Roman periods: it had at least three successive floors, and changes were made to the hypocaust structure, the hot air conduits and the opening to the praefurnium, as well as to the walls of the building. The rooms on either side of the hypocaust had some four floor surfaces of which two were cobbled and the other two paved in marble (probably with at least two cisterns). Two further floors (one with white mosaic and the other marble paving) probably belong to adjunct rooms. A Christian tomb, remains of Byzantine walls and an Ottoman kalderimi on the same orientation as the Roman road demonstrate the continuous use of this area. Portable finds include 12 bronze coins and the upper part of a white marble statute. A continuation of a large sewer channel from the bath complex at 101 Boukaouri Street is reported at Karatza Street, between Boukaouri and Agiou Dimitriou. Below it was a continuation of the Hellenistic cobbled street previously discovered at 109 Boukaouri and Karatza Streets (ADelt 34 [1979] Chr, 134). G. Papandreou and Dirphys Streets. L. Papakosta reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 297) the discovery of two tombs. Only the bottom part of the first was preserved, with a tiled floor and brick, tile and cement walls. The second was a tile grave containing an adult burial, head to the east. 65. Patras, 104-06 Boukaouri Street: general view. Adramyttiou Street. L.

A layer of burnt clay covered much of the interior, with sherds of large vessels beneath. 14 Kyprou Street (A. Meimaroglou property). M. Petropoulos reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 298-99) the discovery of a Roman farmstead outside and to the north of ancient Patras, one of a series lining the ancient road to Agyia. The workshop area of the complex consisted of four partially covered areas. A large round potter's kiln was found (3m in diameter), plus a second, smaller and older one of which only the central support survives. A tiled floor was later laid in this area, on which was a small monolithic basin for clay preparation. A well supplied water. A cistern and a drainage channel are related to the older kiln. A storage pithos was found in situ in the northern part of the plot. 14 Pineiou and Kladeou Streets (K. Tsoulou property). M. Petropoulos reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 299-300) the discovery of part of an Early Roman farmstead devoted to oil and wine production (Fig. 66). Presses and vats for wine were found, as well as fixed and portable oil separators, pottery kilns for the production of storage and transport vessels, and a grain press. The complex had two construction phases at the beginning and</page><page sequence="63">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 63 end of the first century AD. The farmstead lay beside the north bank of the Meilichos river (ancient Kallinaos). On the south bank was a large retaining wall for flood control (similar constructions are found on both banks of the river by the Roman bridge). 57-59 Zaimi and 38-40 Pouqueville Streets (M. Therianou property). M. Petropoulos reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 302) the discovery of a wall of a funerary peribolos in opus caementicium. The west wall of the neighbouring house to the east probably belongs to the same structure. A column capital was collected. Junction of Othon-Amalias and Kolokotronis Streets. G. Alexopoulou reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 302) the discovery of two walls. Zarouchleika (OEK property 'Patra XI'). A. Vasilogamvrou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 300) on continued excavation on the site of new planned workers' housing (grid rows 1, 2 and 4). A funerary building (structure A) occupies the northern part of row 4 ( cf. ADelt 53 [1998] Chr , 253) and an extensive, multi-roomed structure (B) the southeastern (continuing to the east). A bath complex (structure l~) continued beyond rows 1 and 2 to the north and east, under modern roads. The portion excavated includes a room with a hypocaust and a bench along the west wall. The abandonment of the bath building is dated to the second half of the second century AD. Together, these three struc- tures indicate the presence of a Roman villa destroyed in the late second century AD and abandoned to the flood- waters of the neighbouring Glaukos river. These remains will be conserved and presented in situ. North cemetery, site of the new Patras Archaeological Museum on the Patras-Athens new national road. M. Petropoulos reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 301) on excavation in 2000-2001. From the fifth century BC to the seventh century AD, the north cemetery of Patras extended along the via publica from Patras to Aigion. The closest section of this road previously known lies to the south on Thermopylae Street, north of the Roman bridge on Aretha Street (see ADelt 50 [1995] Chr , 213-15). Within the cemetery, the road was cobbled, while the section that crosses the bridge is paved. No evidence for the continuation of the cemetery was found on the museum site: here the road (traced for a length of 64m, ca. 34m from the national road) was a dirt track shaped by continuous use and sloping north-south following the natural contours. Pot-holes and wheel tracks were repaired with stones, tile fragments and soil. At least three episodes of surfacing were traced. In the first, the road surface was shaped in the natural soil and contained mostly Hellenistic (third-century) sherds. The two main episodes, Roman (second century AD) and Late Roman (fourth century AD), coincide with major phases of road construction elsewhere, including the erection of the bridge. Minor resurfacing with gravel and soil was under- taken from time to time. Wheel ruts, 1.15-1. 28m and sometimes 1.5m apart, were generally filled with stone, gravel and tile. In so far as the road width can be deter- 66.

A coin of King George I (1869) in the surface implies that the road remained in use and was succeeded by, or used in parallel with, the old national road. Rio, Ano Rodini, Roupakia (G Karaboula property). M. Petropoulos reports ( ADelt55 [2000] Chr, 302-03) the discovery of a Classical farmstead, of which two rooms were investigated. Storage pithoi (including some with lead mend-clamps) were found along with terracotta loomweights, good-quality Classical pottery and a destruction level with Laconian roof tile. The building was abandoned in the fourth century BC, probably after an earthquake (possibly that of 373 BC). The site's proximity to the modern road between Platani and Selmeniko indicates that the ancient road also followed this line. Sections of stone wall at Koukkistra, 1.5km along the rural road from Kato to Ano Rodini, likely belong to a second farmstead on the northern borders of the chora of Patras. Platani, Mavropodia (Phounta property). M. Petropoulos reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 303) the discovery of two ancient stone mounds with tile, pithos and a few Classical sherds. Sympoliteia, Meidana (E. Phaltakou property). E.-I. Kolia (6th EPCA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 341) the identification of a deposit of tile, domestic pottery and a few Late Classical to Early Hellenistic black-glazed sherds. Greca. M. Petropoulos and A. Vordos (6th EPCA) report (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 342-43) the remains of a large peripteral temple at Ag. Sostis, discovered in the course of survey to establish the existence of an ancient route between the temple of Artemis Aontia at Ano Mazaraki (Rakita) and that at Trapeza. Visible remains are the krepis blocks, the four sides of the peristasis, part of the sekos and an orthostat of the pronaos. The site is at l,100masl, within the ancient Rhypike and on a plateau with a clear view to the Meganeitas valley, the upland plain of Trapeza, the plain of Aigion and the Corinthian gulf. No traces of the road were discovered (although survey continues), but the location of the temple confirms the existence of a route on the west side of the Meganeitas valley (complementing that already known on the east) which links the coast road with inland Achaea and Arkadia via Rakita. Mavriki (A. Theophanopoulou, T. Gavali and M. Theodorou property). E.-I. Kolia reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 340) the discovery beneath the main road to Aigion of a Geometric pithos burial (oriented north- south), containing a single contracted burial, a skyphos, two bronze rings, an iron dagger and a bronze double axe. Aigion Vasileios Konstantinou Street (A. Antonini property). E.-I. Kolia reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 319) building remains of probable Roman date. The corner of a building is preserved, incorporating a soft limestone column capital in secondary use, and cut by a terracotta water-pipe. Outside, a pithos had a bronze coin in the base. 76 Aigialeos Street (Papakonstantinou property). E.-I. Kolia reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 319-20) the discovery of three walls (of which one is Roman) in a trench opened for the construction of a fuel reservoir. 12 Odos Dodecanesion (Ch. Spyropoulou property). E.-I. Kolia reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 320) the discovery of a small deposit of Early Hellenistic pottery, plus a limestone slab probably from a Hellenistic construction. Aigion, water company (DEYA) works E.-I. Kolia reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 320-24) the following finds made in the east of the city in the course of the extension and replacement of the pipe network. Omagyriou Dios Street: walls of field-stones beneath a layer of tile, running east-west, were encountered at several points along the street. A well at the west end contained second-century BC pottery, a lamp, a disc loomweight and a terracotta antefix. 13 Lysiou Street: the corner of a Roman building. Megalou Spilaiou Street: at varying depths and locations along the street were a Hellenistic wall, part of a Late Roman building and the fragmentary remains of two further walls. 127-35 Odysseos Street (previously Agion Apostolon Street): three tile graves, oriented north-south (with a few sherds in the fill), and an empty brick-built cist grave on the same orientation. 62 Agiou Alexiou Street: a northwest-southeast wall bordering to the east a well at the junction with parodos Ag. Alexiou. 49 Agion Apostolon Street: the wall of a funerary peribolos just west of the entrance to the precinct of the church of the Ag. Apostolon. Inside (west of) the peribolos, a limestone sarcophagus (oriented northeast- southwest) with a cover slab had been robbed: in the fill were Early Hellenistic sherds, lamp fragments and a gold danake. A similar tomb of the same group was previously excavated (see ADelt 45 [1990] Chr , 138). Nikolaou Plastira Street: a dense concentration of antiquities along this street. Architectural remains - chiefly sections of wall of various periods, also tile and pebble flooring and destruction deposits - were found mostly on the left side of the street, with Hellenistic and Roman tombs from the city cemetery on the right. In one instance, a soft limestone Ionic capital preserving geison footings from a building or funerary monument was re-used in a wall. Two cement-lined cisterns were located outside Plastiras 84. At number 94 was the brick-built firing chamber of a Roman kiln (2.1m estimated diameter, 1.94m preserved height; the floor had not been located when excavation stopped), as well as the stomion of small worked stones and lime plaster. A layer of burnt clay surrounded the kiln, especially on the north side. Twelve tombs were discovered. Four were Hellenistic cists of limestone slabs, oriented north-south: one contained two amphorae and a fragmentary bronze strigil; the second (which had been robbed) an amphora, an unguentarium, a skyphos and many bronze nails; and the third, two amphorae. An enchytrismos lay close to the first of these graves. The fourth was looted and re- used during the Roman period: inside were fragments of glass vessels, iron nails, a Hellenistic ceramic unguen- tarium, a bronze spiral arm-ring and a bronze mirror, and outside were gold jewellery attachments and a danake , and a glass tear-bottle. Three further damaged cist tombs of the same construction and orientation are likely also to be of Hellenistic date: one contained a bronze coin.</page><page sequence="65">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 65 The remaining tombs are all Roman in date. Two are brick-built cists with no grave goods. At number 67, the south side of a Roman tomb, with a brick-built vault, stone walls and a beaten-earth floor, was visible in the scarp but not excavated. Two monumental tombs incorporated spolia probably from earlier funerary monuments: one has a geison block with mutules as a cover, an architectural member with two half-columns at the west side and, at the north side, a slab with a relief ivy leaf. The other incorpo- rated part of a fluted column drum: it contained many glass vessels (mainly unguentaria), part of a bronze chain, three bronze rings, a bronze mirror, gold sheet, a bone pin, iron nails probably from the wooden bier and a prochous, plate and unguentarium. Ancient Helike. E.-I. Kolia reports (AD 55 [2000] Chr, 326-27) on geomorphological research undertaken by the University of Patras. Twenty one cores were taken, 10 mechanically to a depth of 13m (at Limnes, Paliotaratses Helike, Helike, Nikoleika, Rodia and Nea Keryneia) and 11 by hand to a depth of 7.5m (in the area of Limnes and sites between Rizomylos and Nikoleika). Magnetometry survey focused on the previously researched area of Helike (at Tsinoukeika and Paliotaratses) and a first exploration of Limnes and Rizomylos. Antiquities were found in five of the 10 test trenches opened for geological purposes. Three Byzantine and five Roman tombs were discovered. The Byzantine graves comprise one pit containing a double burial, one tile grave with a pair of bronze earrings, and one reburial. The Roman graves are one pit, three tile graves (one of which contained a red-slip prochous and a lamp, and another an unglazed prochous, a lamp and a bronze coin) and one reburial. Finds in other trenches include an angle of two Byzantine walls with a small portion of a cobbled floor(?) at a lower level, a further wall angle and part of a cobbled road(?) surface with a wall, which produced a bronze coin of Sikyon. Katholiko, Lobozino (Tou Kalamioti o Linos). E.-I. Kolia reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 342) further explo- ration, revealing terrace walls, building foundations and ancient spolia re-used in modern structures, and estab- lishing the extent of the remains on what has now been designated an archaeological site. Panagia, Oasi. E.-I. Kolia reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 341) the identification of architectural remains (including wall foundations and a column base), plus Hellenistic tile, a pithos and sherds. The area covered is extensive ( ca . 2ha) and likely represents an as yet unidentified ancient settlement on the right bank of the Krios river. Mavredi, Marmara. E.-I. Kolia reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 341) the discovery of a cistern and a Roman to Early Christian brick wall, plus scattered architectural remains. Aiges E.-I. Kolia reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 341) antiquities visible at three locations. Agia Sotira. Foundations of large conglomerate blocks were noted at the site of the old chapel of Ag. Sotira. At least two niches cut into the rock nearby, and scattered tile and sherds, may indicate a cult place. Plakopetra. A partly finished column and, to the north, the corner of an ancient structure which must have been destroyed with the opening of the old farm road were recorded. Pyrgos. Systematic description of what has now been declared an archaeological site followed the exposure of further remains after the fires of summer 2000. A large retaining wall, running almost parallel with the fortifi- cation and of the same construction, is preserved to a height of seven courses. Agios Ioannis Voudenis. E.-I. Kolia reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 342) the discovery of much Early Hellenistic pottery at the intended site of the new bell-tower of this church. Architectural remains, tile and pithos sherds were also found. Kato Salmeniko, Katoikia. E.-I. Kolia reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 342) the discovery of three looted and damaged tile graves. Trapeza. A. Vordos reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 324- 26) on the 2000 excavation season in the temple (see previously AAA 32-34 [1999-2001], 149-60). The north long side of the building had 15 adjoining stylobate blocks of varying length (up to 1.83m) and width (1.16-1. 22m). The south edges of a number were tooled, perhaps to engage the pteron blocks - all are sandstone with a 0.1m wide band of anathyrosis. The east side is preserved to the height of the euthyn- teria foundation. Only three euthynteria blocks survived modern quarrying in this area. The east and north sides interlock on the corner. In contrast with the blocks of the overlying courses, they are of local conglomerate roughly worked with a small pick. The blocks of the exterior face of the northeast corner have not been found, but the exposed area beneath indicates that the corner was founded on trimmed bedrock. The temple foundation is ca. 16.72m x 31.56m, making it a hecatompedon close in dimension to the Temple of Poseidon at Ermione. Inside the temple were parts of the north and east wall of the sekos and of the foundation of the wall between the pronaos and sekos. The north wall of the sekos, 2.1m from the stylobate, consists of an 8.63m long row of sandstone blocks at foundation level. The pteron was probably paved, although only the plaster underlay is preserved. The structure overlying the north wall of the sekos forms part of the toichobate from which two blocks are preserved in situ; one bears traces on its upper surface of the setting of the orthostates, and of the floor of the pteron (a ridge was cut along its length to accommodate the paving slabs) and of the pronaos (where their underlying course is also preserved). The east and north walls of the sekos bond. The foundation of this east wall, a double row of sandstone blocks, is traced for 4.56m, and that of the sekos-pronaos (a series of stones set on their sides, 1.32m wide at most) for 4.2m. The depth of the pronaos is thus established at 4.1m (the distance between the foundations of the two walls). A lime plaster substrate for a floor visible in the scarp may be that preserved over the entire area of the pronaos. Present evidence indicates that the temple was built towards the end of the sixth century BC. It occupies the flat part of the plateau, leaving an open area to the east before the terrain slopes down, on which the altar was likely located.</page><page sequence="66">66 CATHERINE MORGAN Portable finds include parts of the sculpted decoration of the temple, horse legs and hooves in sandstone, a terra- cotta foot probably of a sphinx and many fragments of roof tiles. There is as yet no evidence for the deity worshipped, although given the position of the temple in the heart of the fortified city, a poliad deity is likely. The identity of the city is also uncertain in the absence of unequivocal epigraphical evidence. In 2009, press attention was drawn to the discovery of the sculpture of the west pediment of the temple. Armed warriors and a figure of Athena indicate a battle subject, perhaps a gigantomachy ( Ethnos [24/11/09]). Kato Trapeza. A. Vordos reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 326) the discovery of a pithos burial 100m west of the Church of Profitis Ilias. The pithos (mouth to the east) was closed with a stone. The burial was disturbed: among the bones were sherds of a Late Geometric kantharos and seven bronze biconical beads. The site is outside the fortified area of Trapeza to the east. A Mycenaean cemetery was located in the 1930s on the southwest slope of Trapeza, and Protogeometric and Late Geometric finds were also made in 1995. It is likely that the city cemetery is located in this general area. Aigeira (I. Eustathiou and P. Oikonomou properties). E-I. Kolia reports (AAA 40-41 [2007-2008], 41-60) the discovery in the course of rescue excavation in 2006 of two fourth-century BC houses in modern Aigeira, 200m from the sea and west of the mouth of the Krios river. The houses were on the same north-south orientation and their outer walls approximately parallel. They likely formed part of a planned coastal settlement, perhaps the port of the city of Aigai 2.5km away. The variety of issues among the 23 bronze coins recovered indicates commercial activity. House I (on the Eustathiou plot) was built (probably in the second quarter of the fourth century) in mud-brick on stone foundations, with no evidence of a basement. It was remodelled at least once in the mid fourth century, when the eastern part was converted to a shop or workshop, noting the large quantity of (in many cases local) pointed amphorae in the destruction deposit. The central and western areas remained residential (noting, e.g., loomweights and fish-hooks, and the discovery of the andron, with a fine plaster floor, in the northwest corner). Plaster and the remains of pebble flooring in the destruction deposit indicate an upper storey. In house II (Oikonomou plot), only part of the andron (with a light-reddish plaster pavement and couch settings) and its antechamber lay within the building plot. Part of a terracotta sima with floral and meander decoration found in the andron dates the construction of the house to the second half of the fourth century (most likely in the third quarter). In both houses, violent destruction in the late fourth to early third century BC is indicated by a thick deposit with evidence of intense burning, including burnt wood, Laconian tile, pottery (a homogenous collection of the second half of the fourth century including black-glazed echinus bowls, kylikes and kantharoi, and an early unguentarium) and coins (notably a bronze issue of Sikyon with a terminus post quern of 340 BC). Slight remains of poor third-century construction were found on the Eustathiou plot, plus a fifth-century wall deeper in the northeast corner (noting a little pottery and a bronze bull figurine of the first quarter of the fifth century). Aigialeia. A. Pontrandolfo (SAIA/Salerno) reports on the seventh season of survey conducted in 2009 in collabo- ration with the 6th EPCA and the KERA/EIE (Centre for Greek and Roman Antiquity, National Research Foundation). This first season of a renewed programme was focused in the Krios valley, on the upper part of the fluvial basin towards the borders of Arcadia. The intent was to combine survey with the excavation record derived notably from the work of the Austrian Institute and the 6th EPCA around modern Seliana, identified with the ancient polisma of Phelloe (Pausanias 7.26.10-11), noting ongoing excavation conducted by C. Katsarou (6th EPCA) around the church of Ag. Vasileios. Extensive exploration of the greater part of the area was undertaken to assess potential variations in surface visibility, and to gain a general sense of the probable relationship between surface traces and buried remains. Prospection covered the ca. 30ha of the territory of modern Seliana as defined by the Evrostina mountains and to the west by the Krios valley. Oral and written testi- monia concerning site location were verified on the ground. Despite poor visibility, exploration revealed occupation from the Late Bronze Age to late antiquity.</page><page sequence="67">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 67 WESTERN GREECE By Catherine Morgan IONIAN ISLANDS, excluding Kythera Zakynthos (35th EPCA: 20th EBA) Zakynthos, Kastro. Z. Mylona (6th EBA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 353-54) that the first phase of conser- vation and restoration revealed a range of new information about the building's history and construction. The plan of the small Venetian powder magazine was established, as well as details of the roof construction. A stoa was discovered (10m long, 0.9m wide, 2.5m estimated height, facing west), also a 33m length of a paved road, the remains of public and private buildings, and a large part of the complex system of rain-water management (channels, cisterns and wells). Zakynthos, Signala reef. A. Dellaporta (then Director, EMA, now Director, 2nd EBA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 1215-20) the excavation of a 16th-century Spanish wreck one nautical mile outside Zakynthos harbour (Fig. 67). The northern part of the wreck was investigated in 1994-1997 and the southern part in 2000. The well- preserved ship's timbers give further details of its construction. Among the masses of material in the hold were the timbers of barrels some of which contained different grades of walnut. Other finds include domestic pottery, faience and glazed wares, metal cooking vessels, animal bones and olive pits, three Spanish coins, two tobacco pipes and cannon shot.

Rigakou (then 6th EBA, now Director, 21st EBA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 354-55) on continuing conservation and restoration, which revealed a variety of new information. In the Latin Church of San Marco, a slab from the floor bears an inscription with the date MC-CCC beneath a cross. Restoration of a retaining wall west of the Church of the Madonna della Guardia produced a range of imported Italian pottery of the 16th to 17th century. Agios Georgios, Gradou (Kranaia). A. Sotiriou (then 6th EPCA, now Director, 35th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 336) that cleaning and landscaping at the Classical sanctuary revealed that the west wall of the stoa and the peribolos wall of the sanctuary were both longer than previously understood, and that there were further cross walls and thus internal rooms in the stoa (Fig. 68). 68. Agios Georgios, Gradou: temple area after cleaning. Ellinika, Kateleios (I. and G. Mila property). A. Sotiriou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 336-37) on continuing excavation of a Roman to Late Roman settlement on a plateau 150-200m from the sea (see ADelt 54 [1999] Chr, 278-79). Room 1 (divided into two areas) contained Laconian pan and cover tiles arranged in stacks; a thick destruction layer over it contained stone, plaster, tile, pottery and pieces of floor mosaic with geometric and floral decoration which must have fallen from an upper storey or mezzanine. A quantity of slag of varying sizes was found in a destruction deposit with roof tile in the east of the plot. There must have been a workshop in the area, though remains of the structure have yet to be located. Sami, west cemetery A. Sotiriou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 337-39) the discovery of further tombs on two closely contingent sites. I. Metaxa Street (I. and G. Philippatou property). Six looted Hellenistic and Roman tombs (four cists and two tile graves) were found on a plot where tombs have previously been excavated (see ADelt 40 [1985] Chr, 146- 47). Three fragments of marble sculpture were recovered from the debris of landscaping: a hand, part of a male head and a section of drapery. Classical red-figure and Hellenistic sherds were also found. Souedias Street (parallel to I. Metaxa Street). Widening of the street caused the destruction of seven tombs (gold leaf, lamps, bronze coins, etc. were collected from the spoil): ensuing rescue excavation has to date revealed 50 Classical, Hellenistic and Roman tombs. Given the longevity of the cemetery, there is no consistent arrangement of graves, just successive levels. Most are tile graves, with eight cists (six of limestone slabs and two of Corinthian tiles). Reburial, common in the Hellenistic and Roman periods, is chiefly encountered in the stone cists. Classical tombs, by contrast, have one or two interments, dependent on their form. Cremation was also known on a limited scale; enchytrismoi of infants and children in amphorae or pithoi was common. At the southern edge of the plot was the burial of an animal in a tile grave, accom- panied by loomweights. Finally, piles of bones at several places in the cemetery likely came from earlier burials destroyed by later tombs. The tombs contained rich goods, including gold and silver jewellery, silver and bronze coins, bone pins, and glass and pottery vessels. Ancient Sami had three cemeteries to the east, west and north. Present indications are that the west cemetery is bounded to the west and east by Metaxa and Souedias Streets, and to the south and north by the Health Centre and telephone company (OTE) building respectively. Funerary periboloi, Hellenistic and Roman gravel paths, architecturally impressive tombs and rich goods combine to indicate an extensive and important cemetery extra muros (see previously ADelt 34 [1979] Chr, 266; ADelt 35 [1980] Chr, 199-200; ADelt 40 [1985] Chr, 146-47). The east cemetery lies on the hill of Ag. Phanedon (Kyatis), the second acropolis of the ancient city. Tombs here seem limited in number and looted. The north cemetery, also extra muros, is at Tseka; few tombs have so far been investigated here. Additional graves have also been found in other locations such as Palioura and Kaloirolongo. Yayana. D. Evangelistis (EMA) reports ( ADelt 50 [2000] Chr, 1220-224) a collaborative survey with the University of Trondheim, investigating a concentration of transport vessels in the Kephallonia-Ithaca straits, 400m north of the bay of Yayana, 40m from the shore and at a depth of 6m.

Sotiriou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 340) the discovery of the wall of a building south of the Roman cemetery. Fiskardo, Roman cemetery. A. Sotiriou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 339-40) the excavation of a funerary peribolos and a small area northeast of it (Fig. 70). Funerary peribolos 2, oriented northeast-southwest, is rectangular with loosely built walls (noting a central part in opus testaceum) preserved to 1.5m high, a paved floor and a monumental entrance. It contains three tombs. Tomb XX is a semi-subterranean built cist, set into a pit. Tombs XVIII and TXIX are sarcophagi set on low bases close to the walls and with relief sculpture on the visible sides: the interiors of both were explored in 1993. Both date to the second to third century AD. The sarcophagus in tomb XVIII was missing its southeast short side and half of the long side: the surviving part of the cover has a relief of a reclining woman. Depicted on the long side is the rape of Persephone with Artemis, Athena, Persephone, Pluto and two other forms. The cover of the sarcophagus in tomb XIX had relief tiles with a central hole: the main side had a male figure between two Nikai, joined by garlands adorned with fruit and birds; the space above the right garland had a female head, and one infers a similar figure above the left garland. The short sides were decorated with bucrania, garlands and rosettes. In the northeast area, three built cists (tombs XLV- XLVI) contain bronze coins, glass and pottery vessels, lamps, strigils, small metal objects and a pair of silver earrings. The cemetery continues under the modern road for some 150m. Excavation began in 1997, and the results can be summarized as follows. Fourteen graves belong to two funerary periboloi. The form of the tombs and the rich grave goods indicate that they belong to prominent families. The overall total of graves discovered can be categorized as follows: 13 are overground built cists, 17 are built cists set into pits in the bedrock, three are monumental (set on bases, with doors and vaulted ceilings), five are tile graves set into the cists or pits, one is a simple pit into which the bier was set, seven are tenta- tively identified as enchytrismoi and four are monolithic sarcophagi (two with relief sculpture). The ancient settlement is located at Tigania, although its identification with ancient Panormos remains uncertain. 70. Fiskardo, Roman cemetery: general view from the northeast. Ithaca-Kephallonia channel. A. Dellaporta reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 1224-25) the following wrecks located during a collaborative survey with the Norwegian Institute at Athens. Outside Fiskardo was a wreck with a cargo of Dressel 6A amphorae of the first century BC to the first century AD. Near the islet of Asteris was a Roman wreck with a cargo of amphorae of the Italian type Forlimpopoli/ Agora K114 or Dressel 6A of the first century BC to the second century AD, as well as part of the fabric of the ship. Finally, off Piso Aetos at a depth of 23m was a wreck with a cargo of large tiles, a storage vessel and the upper part of a Greco-Italian amphora type probably of the fourth to the third century BC. Corfu (8th EPCA: 21st EBA) Corfu town, Venetian fortification. F. Kephallonitou (Director, 8th EBA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 630) the exposure of a section of the inner face of the wall on Donzelot Street; this forms an angle at the junction with Mitropolis Square and continues parallel with the lawcourts. Large sections of the Venetian underground storm drain were also found. Pottery from the excavations dates to the 15th to 18th century, and features sgraffito and other glazed wares. Kanoni A. Papadea, K. Kanta-Kitsou, T. Provata, M. Nakou and A. Karamanou (8th EPCA) report (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 635- 44) on a series of rescue excavations. Figareto (property of D. Chalikiopoulou). The foundations of eight walls built in dry stone and roof tile, plus a mosaic floor were found. The remains are too fragmentary to determine the building's function. Limited finds include black-glazed pottery and five coins (two of which date between 229 and 248 BC). Nausikas Street (O.T. 610, Konofaou A' property). Further excavation was undertaken of a Hellenistic to Late Roman building complex, seven rooms of which were revealed in 1999 and 2000. An amphora storeroom (I) was found and another room (II) contained the base of a large pithos with lead clamps. Residues of pine resin were identified inside it. The largest room (IV) contained a paved area of densely-packed tiles and mortar. Next to it, a well-built rectangular structure held a pithos or lekane for the storage of liquids (possibly wine). In the opposite part of the room, a built semicircular construction was probably a furnace or kiln. The finds suggest that the complex was a small-scale workshop for processing resin, a necessary ingredient of wine. Dating of the pithos by the NCSR Demokritos places the peak of activity in the Roman period (AD 4-83). Seventy coins were recovered, mostly worn, of which five date to 229-48 BC and one to 400-300 BC. Finds also include three fragments of clay altars, three loomweights (two lead and one terracotta and inscribed), iron nails and numerous sherds of cooking pots of various sizes. The head of a Hellenistic male terracotta figurine in the foundation of a wall provided a terminus post quern for this part of the complex, while a fragment of a third- century AD Corinthian relief bowl gave a terminus ante quern. A prehistoric flint tool and a stone axe in the upper part of the excavated deposits indicate a prehistoric site in the area, possibly within the limits of the Kanoni peninsula.</page><page sequence="70">70 CATHERINE MORGAN On the adjacent plot (Konofaou B' property), parts of two buildings were separated by a street, with a thick ancient fill. Vrysoula (S. Vlachou property). Two parallel walls separated by a dense deposit of sherds, tile and stones, which is probably the substratum of a street on the same orientation as that on the Konofaou B' property, were located. This would connect the higher parts of the ancient city in the east with the Yllaiko harbour to the west. A row of structures beneath the street was probably part of the central sewer of the city. Various remains across the plot including a floor with a hearth and a well. Most of the pottery associated with architectural remains dates to the Classical and mainly Hellenistic periods, while Archaic material was found in the deepest soundings. Nausikas Street (Th. Souli property). A construction partially unearthed west of the street in 1992 was further revealed, without shedding light on its function. Nausikas Street (Catholic archdiocese property). A number of structures east of the street range from Archaic to Late Classical/Early Hellenistic in date. Initially a small stream ran through the area. During the Archaic period, a dam was constructed, the stream filled and a small building erected next to it. Due to the steep slope, a terrace wall was built which incorporated part of the city's central sewer (in use into the Late Roman period). In Classical times, a new terrace wall was erected above the old one. Abundant Archaic and Classical sherds include Attic imports (e.g. a black- figure krater rim, ca. 530-520 BC, with ivy on the exterior and a trireme stern inside). Other finds include fragments of small solid terracotta figures of the known Corfiot type of standing Artemis, as well as unfired clay and kiln wasters, nine bronze coins, a bronze object possibly representing a bed, iron and bronze arrowheads and an iron spearhead, and a small blue-green glass bead. These suggest a sanctuary, although the kiln wasters and raw clay may be connected with a workshop. Doukaki property. Important remains of the earliest settlement have previously been uncovered here ( ADelt 20 [1965] Chr , 392; ADelt 42 [1987] Chr , 337-40; ADelt 43 [1988] Chr , 340-42). The density of the walls (nine were uncovered) and high frequency of pottery are character- istic: Archaic to Roman finds include coarse monochrome pottery, moulded bowls, black-glazed and thin-walled painted vessels, as well as Hellenistic bronze coins. Mavriki O.E. property. Limited architectural remains (parts of three walls) and Hellenistic pottery were found. Rarri property, next to the Church of Agia Paraskevi. Trials within an existing building revealed part of a tiled floor and abundant pottery, including many lamps of various types (noting 642 handless miniatures). South of the building was a clay floor with an incomplete column drum immediately beneath it. Associated finds are mainly lamps, miniature vases, black-figure pottery and figurine fragments, as well as the bronze base of a mirror (a lion with human legs on its back). In the west of the plot was a deposit mainly of lamps (1,125 examples, whole and fragmentary), as well as figurines, miniature vases, Archaic pottery, black-figure sherds and bronze jewellery. The assemblage is Archaic in date. The lamps span around a century, had all been used and include ceremonial types (Fig. 71). Ch. Ioannou property. Walls and floors of four architectural phases were located. The earliest, Late Archaic, phase is associated with analogous finds from the neighbouring Orfanos property ( ADelt 51 [1996] Chr , 412-13, plan 6) where a ship-shed was previously revealed. The remains of the following two, Classical, phases were connected with coastal installations due to their sturdy construction and connection with analogous finds from the neighbouring Georgara property (ADelt 53 [1998] Chr , 522-23). The final Early Hellenistic phase produced only one wall. Corfu-Kanoni road (Pachi property). A. Vaxovanou (8th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 644-47) on finds covering a long span from the Classical to Byzantine and modern period. Four architectural phases were revealed, from Classical to Roman. The last, Roman, phase includes sections of crude stone-built walls. The fragmentary nature of the remains could be associated with the destruction of the city by Agrippa, prior to the battle of Actium in 31 BC. The earlier, Hellenistic, phase shows the transfor- mation of the Classical city plan. In the east of the plot, various walls and structures included a building with at least three rooms, a structure with a hard plastered floor of undefined function and a cist grave with a tile cover containing a single inhumation without grave goods. In the west of the plot was part of a street, 5m wide and running southeast-northwest, with buildings on both sides (walls and floors were excavated, plus one mosaic floor). Pottery included late fourth to second-century BC plain and decorated wares, unguentaria, terracotta figurines, a stone altar and bronze coins (300-229 BC). The two earliest, Early and Late Classical, phases had more carefully built walls with deeper foundations. A street, with parts of walls and floors on either side, was uncovered in the east of the plot; this was gradually abandoned as residential space expanded in the following phase. In the west there was evidence for filling and levelling of the surface with stones and tiles. Numerous finds include black-figure and red-figure pottery, fifth- century amphora types, as well as incense burners and ceremonial lamps and a bronze coin of 430-330 BC. A total of 124 coins were found during the excavation and a large number of loomweights, reflecting the domestic character of the buildings. 71. Corfu town, Kanoni, Rarri property: sanctuary lamp.</page><page sequence="71">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 71 Anemomylos, harbour of Alkinoos Church of Agioi Iason and Sosipatros. A. Karamanou and G.-K. Augerinou (8th EPCA) report ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 647) on excavation under the modern floor during restoration work carried out by the 8th EBA. Four trenches were opened, two in the narthex and two in the main church. The deepest sounding, at 2.47m, reached a wet layer of gravel and shell with Hellenistic sherds. Limited architectural remains, including part of an ashlar wall, probably a peribolos, and a tile grave, are Roman and mainly Late Roman in date. The area, where more tombs have previously been found, was part of the cemetery of Roman to Late Roman Anemomylos. N. Tata and M. Samoili property, next to the Church of Agioi Iason and Sosipatros. K. Kanta-Kitsou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 648-49) on excavation on a neighbouring plot. A square (6.7m x 6.7m) structure, of unworked hard and soft limestone bound with coarse red mortar, survives to ca. 2.5m high. It was founded within a marine deposit of coarse gravel. It seems to be associated with the installations of the harbour of Alkinoos, located in the Anemomylos area; it may be a tower at the edge of the harbour, analogous to, but later than, the Classical tower near the foundations of the Church of Ag. Athanasios at Anemomylos ( PAE [1955], 66-70; BCH 89 [1965], 834). Limited finds include five coins, three of which give a terminus post quem of 229- 248 BC and a terminus ante quem of AD 205 for the structure. Nikolouzou property. G.-K. Augerinou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 649-50) the discovery of further Roman buildings ca. 40m east of the Church of Ag. Iason and Sosipatros. A wall along the north side of the plot, including three plastered clay columns on rectangular stone bases, was probably the peribolos of major Roman buildings in the northeastern sector of the ancient city. South of it, the remains of public or private buildings included a area paved with re-used stone, at least two buildings (A and B) and a child burial in a pithos with a silver coin of Diadumenian (AD 218) used as a pendant. These finds confirm the expansion of the city into this area in Roman times, after the silting of the Alkinoos harbour during the first century AD. Arion Hotel ('Arion A.E.' property). F. Liapi (8th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 650-51) the discovery of installations associated with the southern part of the harbour of Alkinoos. Part of two sturdy east-west platforms belong to T7-shaped structures and niches, the main, north, face of which appears heavily eroded by the sea. Some 25m from the south face of these structures, a long terrace wall is associated with the harbour installa- tions. Building remains of the second to third century AD in the rest of the plot confirm the assumption that the harbour was already silted and abandoned by that time. City cemetery G.-K. Augerinou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 651-52) the excavation of burials from the city cemetery on three plots in Garitsa. Alkinoos and Lohagos Michail Vasila Streets (Sourianou property). An Archaic TT-shaped funerary monument of flat stones, open to the west, was found empty. An Archaic pit burial was also uncovered, plus parts of two parallel Classical walls, probably protecting the monument. In the northwest of the plot, just below the surface, was a Venetian wall (17th century) and a small hoard of eight Venetian coins. Junction of Chrysostomou Smyrnis Street and Vlahernon 28 (Makri property). Eight Hellenistic burials were located: three simple pits, two tile-covered cists and one tile grave, and two enchytrismoi (in chytres). The orientation of the burials varied. In the northeast of the plot, a long dry-stone structure, built directly upon the natural sandy soil and oriented east-west, is probably associated with the ancient harbour of Alkinoos. Andrikopoulou property (lane off Kyprou Street). The remains of destroyed Archaic and Classical tombs include tile, pottery, amphorae, pithoi and bones. New Lawcourt Building (Kolokotroni Street, Sotiras hill). G. Riginos (then 8th EPCA, now Director, 33rd EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 652-54) that excavation of 3,000m2 uncovered a significant part of the ancient city cemetery, including 131 tombs of different types, three pyres and pottery concentrations. Graves were arranged in clusters of varying density and at different depths, mostly oriented north-south. They included enchytrismoi in pithoi (19) or smaller funerary vessels mainly for children (13), which were mostly Archaic in date and contained mostly pottery. The female burial in grave 28 was exceptional for its rich grave goods, including a bronze mirror, clay figurines, a small glass jug and pottery. Four cremation urns were uncovered (in two cases the cremated remains were put first in bronze vessels and then in pots). Fifty one pots contain no evidence of cremation or bones and consequently cannot be associated with a specific burial practice. Seven structures (usually oval or elliptical) contain the remains of primary crema- tions - charcoal, burnt bones and grave goods, mainly pottery. Seventeen tile-covered cists and tile graves were excavated, varying from 0.8m to 1.7m in length, mostly with no goods or just one pot. Twenty pit burials mostly lacked grave goods. One sarcophagus, of soft gray limestone and covered with a limestone slab, contained a single main burial accompanied by a jug and juglet, two bronze rings and astragaloi, and a secondary burial including human and animal bones and sherds of at least five pots. Two crania were also uncovered in the same plot. Three pyres were located between the graves, as well as a structure of solid unfired clay. Concentrations of tile and sherds (seventh- to fourth-century BC) were located mostly in stratigraphically disturbed areas. Other finds include a number of metal objects (coins, jewellery, etc.) and parts of a limestone sphinx, capitals and a millstone. Vatos, Kleidia (property of M. Sneijders). G. Metallinou (8th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 654) on excavation at the southwestern edges of the settlement. A total of 282 sherds and 135 lithic artefacts were recovered, mainly from a surface layer 0.3-0. 63m deep. The pottery was characterized by grey cores and grey- brown surfaces: the more diagnostic sherds had plastic decoration (rope, diagonal groove and finger impressed) of Dakaris' category II, as is common throughout the Bronze Age and Early Iron Age in Epirus, the Ionian islands and Illyria. Lithic artefacts included high-quality tools of grey flint. No architectural remains were found. The limited quantity and extent of the prehistoric finds indicate the existence of a Bronze Age site on the southwestern slopes of Mount Ag. Georgios, possibly at a location higher than the site of Ermones.</page><page sequence="72">72 CATHERINE MORGAN Ermones (Mexa property). G. Metallinou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 654-55) on excavation west of Vatos, ca. 500m from the coast in the northern foothills of Mount Ag. Georgios. The plot is covered with rocks from seismic activity and landslides. Three sectors were excavated. In section E' was a circular stone structure, probably a pit (1.5-1. 7m in diameter), which contained pottery (including a globular miniature juglet and a one-handle kyathos), animal bones and ash. This, plus an adjacent (similar but smaller) round structure, contained Early Bronze Age settlement material. The pit was associated with a floor of packed clay and sparse gravel. Nearby, was an infant burial in a cist, with animal bone but no grave goods (a common practice throughout the Middle and Late Bronze Age in Northwest Greece and Illyria). This evidence, combined with finds from sectors P and J.t' confirms that the site was inhabited during the Early and Middle Bronze Age, was destroyed by earthquake and subsequent rock slides, and was then used as a cemetery during the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age. Sinarades. A. Papadea reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 666) on surface finds of flint artefacts, dated broadly to the Palaeolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age, from three locations on Corfu. At the foot of a low hill in Sinarades (I. Sagia property), 64 artefacts were collected. Thirty more, of good quality flint, came from a deposit of red earth and gravel at the top of Mount Agiou Panteleimonas at Ag. Gordis. A total of 118 flint artefacts was recovered from Lake Kalantzi, a basin in the vicinity of the village of Ag. Giannis. Gremna-Ochyra, Bardi tou Kavou (D. Makantani property). K. Kanta-Kitsou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 655-56) the discovery of a pit at the edge of the cliff, containing large amounts of pottery and tile, ash, shell and various metal objects, all Hellenistic (third- to second- century BC) in date. The pit was likely associated with a nearby installation, possibly a guard-post, due to the strategic location of the site overlooking the sea routes between the Ionian and Adriatic seas. AITOLIA AND AKARNANIA (36th EPCA: 22nd EBA) Publication: L. Kolonas, M. Stavropoulou-Gatsi and G. Stamatis, Ta apxccia dearpa TTjs AircoAoaKap- vavias (Athens 2009). Naupaktos Papachristopoulou Street (A. and K. Papadokostaki property). Ph. Saranti (then 6th EPCA, now 36th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 330-33) the discovery of architectural remains chiefly of the Late Roman/Early Christian and Hellenistic periods (noting that the plot continued in use into the Ottoman period). Late Roman to Early Christian walls are generally north-south in orientation and have red cement. Associated with them in different parts of the plot is a thin layer of fine pebbles generally at around a depth of 2.1m. A long brick and stone wall, which runs across the entire plot and continues beyond it, belongs to a major Early Christian building and incorporates architectural spolia. Its three doorways had all been blocked; at the northwest end is a large roofed space, and there is also an open courtyard off it. In general, walls of this period make extensive use of earlier architectural remains (columns, stele bases, threshold blocks, etc.). Hellenistic landscaping (0.5-lm below the Late Roman to Early Christian levels) used fill containing material of earlier phases (back to the fourth century BC at least). Hellenistic remains were largely confined to the northern part of the plot, and consisted of an ancient road and the roadside buildings which flanked it during its second building phase. The northeast building was carefully built of stone blocks, with an entrance taken out of use in the second phase. It had a tiled floor, a well with part of a pithos as the stomion, and a large pithos set on a base with lead clamps. The northwest building was a poorer structure and its western part was allowed to fall into ruin. A monolithic column probably belongs to its interior. The south roadside building was a simple construction with at least two interior spaces, in one of which was an open conduit leading to the road. The building was severely damaged by two large post- Byzantine deposits which contained rubbish, traces of burning, sherds, stones and shell. The road was traced east-west for a length of 9m (4.5m wide). Two phases were observed, the older, Early Hellenistic, being contemporary with the roadside buildings. The final surface was of pebbles, beaten earth, tile and parts of destroyed floors; the part of the road in contact with the north building was paved, with a small terracotta round well set into it. An extensive destruction deposit, containing whole tiles from the roadside buildings especially on the south, was found across the final surface; contemporary with the last phase was a covered waste channel which cut across the road (many of the cover slabs were in secondary use). In the older phase, a smaller water channel running north-south brought water from inside the north building into a square well/shaft in the middle of the road. This is probably a main road between the centre of the Hellenistic city and the harbour. Langadoula, Mesolongiou Street (Papakosta property). Ph. Saranti reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 333-34) on excavation of a significant part of the west cemetery of the city, beside a road from Naupaktos to Antirrio. This extends the known boundaries of the cemetery to the west and south. Sixteen Classical, Late Classical and Hellenistic graves were located in the southern part of the cemetery, organized into groups but with different orientations. They are simple pits bordered with small stones, tile graves and one cist. Many were child burials (mostly in the north- eastern group) in pits with tile covers. Tile grave V contained the burial of a woman with a child in her arms. An area of intense burning, burnt wood and bone, which covered tombs X and IX, probably came from a purifi- cation pyre. Most child graves did not contain goods (the exceptions were a small cup in grave VII and, in VI, which was probably a reburial, a lamp, a thilastron and two fragmentary vases). Adult graves had more offerings: tomb III had three plainware phialae, a lamp, part of an iron strigil and a few small objects. Tomb 5 had a black- glazed small lekythos. Tomb I, a cist built of large worked blocks, was disturbed but originally contained a bronze kalpis or hydria of which only fragments survive, the handles of a silver kantharos, a plain lamp, a terracotta</page><page sequence="73">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 73 female figurine, a small silver knob and other small objects. The most important find in the tomb was a mid fourth-century bronze mirror with a relief depiction of Dionysos and Ariadne, an Eros and a Silen. Palaiopanagia (Laourdeki property). Ph. Saranti reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 334) the discovery beside the road from Naupaktos to Antirrio of a room (externally 3.5m x 3m) from a Late Roman farmstead or other agricul- tural construction. Inside were rough reddish plaster and a stone paved floor. Noti Botsari Street (O.T. 139, Phrankanastasi property). F. Kephallonitou (Director, 8th EBA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 628-29) the discovery of an Early Christian building comprising a central room with a floor mosaic, a southeast room with two semicircular brick installations and a northeast storeroom. The floor mosaic had a border of geometric spirals and a central zone of a circular motif with a signature: the motifs date the floor to the second half of the fifth century AD (Fig. 72). This is likely part of a large basilica of which more was found on the Ikka plot. Dimolitsa Street (O.T. 235, Kaltsa property). E Kephallonitou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 629) the discovery of an extensive cemetery. Sixty graves were found containing 71 burials, comprising pseudo-cists (39), one tile grave, pit graves (10) and simple inhumations (10). A number of tombs have double burials and there are some reburials. Despite the shortage of portable finds, a Late Byzantine, 13th- to 14th-century, date is likely. Kozoni and Kosma tou Aitolou Streets (Ch. Samaleka property). E Kephallonitou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 629-30) the discovery of three brick-built cist tombs with limestone cover slabs following the lifting of a decorative marble floor. One contained three crania among other bones and strong traces of burning, with the remains of a wooden bier: the only goods were five bronze pins. Another had a similar bier, a bronze pin and a gold ring. The south grave had three burials and reburied bones, two pairs of bronze earrings, and a bronze pin and coin. Elsewhere in the plot, at greater depth, were the remains of an earlier building with a well, a water channel and two pithoi. Galani property. E Kephallonitou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 630) that exploration at the west end of the harbour revealed the level of the sea gate and the setting of the cannon bases and slits, also the remains of a late Ottoman house. Naupaktos by-pass. Ph. Saranti reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 334-35) the results of excavation for the construction of two sections of the by-pass, from Plataniti-Cheimarro Vareias to the Thermon junction and from the Thermon to the Ska junction. Work focused on the former section, which was almost completed in 2000. X.0. 4 +650: part of a kiln (1.9m x 3.75m, 2.1m preserved height) on the west side of the road, stomion to the east, with a firing chamber built of clay. No pottery was found around the kiln, but tiles were found 3m to the south. At Kato Lefka and Mandres Kastrakiou, remains will be further investigated by the 8th EBA. Vomvokou. Ph.

Three black-glazed lekythoi and a glass alabastron were found by chance during road construction at Makrynara, 1.5km northeast of Vomvokou. Trikorpho. Ph. Saranti reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 344) assessment of an extensive Hellenistic fortified settlement, northwest of the modern village. Kryoneri (Deka-Phounta property). E Kephallonitou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 627-28) on excavation in an area of known Byzantine remains. Early Christian walls containing re-used material were found, plus sections of a fifth-century AD floor mosaic with geometric motifs. During the sixth century the walling was incorporated into an apsidal structure which has a small antechamber with a mosaic floor. The variety of motifs, the technique and the composition reflect the popular art of the Peloponnese and central Greece, as well as Nikopolis (where there are parallels for all the motifs used here) (Fig. 73). A tabula has a partially preserved inscription. Inside the apse, a large limestone slab may be part of a second, sixth-century, floor surface. Cist graves without goods were found inside and outside the apse, as well as tombs built into the east side of the apse wall where the body was covered with tiles. After the sixth century the entire area was given over to burial (both simple inhumations and tile graves). Simple inhumations were 73. Kryoneri: floor mosaic.</page><page sequence="74">74 CATHERINE MORGAN also found on the sixth-century floor mosaic. The cemetery continued into the Middle Byzantine period, when the area fell out of use. During the 19th century, the customs house of Kryoneri was built here; this was demol- ished in the 1980s. Rivio, Chapel of Agios Stephanos. F. Kephallonitou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 602-03) that the south and east sides of the chapel exterior were excavated, revealing a continuation of the previously excavated cemetery. Galatas. Ph. Saranti reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 345) receipt of a bronze figurine of Hermes reportedly from a site next to the cemetery of Perithorio. Inspection of the site revealed only later pottery. Stamna. L. Kolonas (Ministry of Culture) and G. Christakopoulou report (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 330) the discovery of further tomb groups at Tragana, Stathmos and Phournoi during the construction of the Agrinion by- pass. Ninety seven Protogeometric and Geometric tombs were found, of the types previously discovered in the area (see, e.g., ADelt 53 [1998] Chr, 281; ADelt 54 [1999] Chr, 271-72). Pyrgos, Katochi. F. Kephallonitou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 603) that the Byzantine tower was built over a tile grave containing glass vessels and a bronze coin. Pottery recovered in the excavation dates from the Late Roman period to the 19th century. Chania Gavrolimnis. Ph. Saranti reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 335) the discovery of at least four well- preserved buildings from a Middle Helladic to Late Helladic settlement in the course of excavation for the new town hall building. The site lies on the southern slope of the Tapia hill, in the northwestern part of Chania: traces of ancient buildings destroyed by modern construction have also been noted on the eastern slope and close to the top of the hill. Excavation was scheduled to continue. Makyneia, Anemolakka. Ph. Saranti reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 344) traces of a long rectangular building. Associated finds - part of a bronze wire handle (perhaps from a miniature lebes), pieces of terracotta relief ornament, a layer of Corinthian tile and part of a lion-head sima - indicate that this was a temple or cult building. Anthophyta (Granitsa), Pylini. Ph. Saranti reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 345) receipt of three unguentaria, a relief bowl, a lead pyxis, a lagynos and a chytra, probably from a destroyed Hellenistic tomb. The tomb was reportedly exposed during quarrying, but no trace was visible upon inspection. Thermon Publication: I.

Stavropoulou-Gatsi (then 6th EPCA, now Director, 36th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 328- 29) excavation at the Sanctuary of Artemis Phistyis, at the northeast of the village and north of the Church of Ag. Triadha (which incorporates many inscriptions from the shrine). Eighty metres southeast of the church is a spring surrounded by ancient spolia. Excavation revealed a terrace and the wall which supported it, with a little tile and coarse pottery in the thin fill layers accumulated against it. Higher up the hill to the east were ancient wall foundations. Gavalou, Sanctuary of Asklepios. M. Stavropoulou- Gatsi reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 330) the results of excavation around and outside the main cult area under- taken in preparation for the roofing of the sanctuary. The stratigraphy of the sanctuary fills was clarified, as was the extent of the main open area and the area outside the peribolos. Pottery from the deepest levels dates to the main, Hellenistic, period of the sanctuary, but also earlier, to periods from the Geometric onwards. Pappadates. M. Stavropoulou-Gatsi reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 330) the discovery, by the southern approach to the village, of a stone cist tomb (oriented northwest- southeast) covered with Laconian tiles and with a stone headrest. It contains a single burial with a kantharos and an echinus bowl of the second half of the third century BC. On the southwest side of the road are groups of tombs or an entire cemetery (probably the west cemetery of the ancient city). Thus the extra mural cemetery should be located towards the northeast plain area (between the villages of Pappadates and Mataranga: see ADelt 51 [1996] Chr, 242-44). Ermitsa, Agrinion (Thomopoulos property). F. Kephallonitou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 630) further excavation within a known Christian cemetery. A further 43 graves are mostly simple inhumations defined by upright stones by the cranium, but with five tile graves and one pseudo-cist. Finds are poor - five bronze hoop earrings, an iron hook, two coins (a denier tournois and a coin of Othonos of 1851), a bronze rod from a necklace and a blue glass attachment. Pottery consisted of plain incised and combed ware. Phragkoskala Agrinion, Tsiprovouni (D. Papageorgiou property). M. Stavropoulou-Gatsi reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 329-30) the investigation of a two-roomed temple close to the bridge over the Zerva river, on the left bank of the river. Its northeastern long side was damaged in the construction of the modern road from Agrinion to Karpenisi. The temple (10m x 7.2m as preserved, oriented northeast-southwest) preserves the krepis of sandstone blocks with pry slots on the upper face and lifting bosses on the lower. It was probably built in the Archaic or Late Archaic period and remained in use into the Hellenistic period. It may house the cult of a female deity: figurine fragments include a seated female deity, perhaps Cybele. Finds include parts of a painted terracotta sima and floral antefixes for a Laconian roof, lead clamps, iron nails and flakes of bronze. The existence of a temple in this location was reported by Woodhouse in 1897, but his published plan refers to a different building which has yet to be located. The area is an extensive plateau at the base of the Tsiprovouni hill. Nearby was the retaining wall which supported the overlying soil. Traces of ancient settlement</page><page sequence="75">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 75 found in the general area extend over the opposite bank of the river. A trial trench 20m west of the temple revealed an orthogonal structure and the cist grave of a child with an iron knife. Spathari, Lepenous. M. Gkazis (6th EPCA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 328) the continuation of rescue excavation in the Archaic sanctuary. The burnt deposit identified in the two previous seasons continued to be exposed: in addition to pottery and fragments of the terra- cotta superstructure of the Archaic temple, a significant quantity of spearheads and arrowheads was found. Drymon Archontochori. I. Moschos (6th EPCA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 327-28) continuing rescue excavation in the Sanctuary of Artemis Epikrateia (a site discovered in 1993 after extensive looting had damaged the votive deposit). The better-preserved eastern part of the votive deposit was excavated: a little medieval pottery in the upper levels may relate to a short-lived settlement in the adjacent cave. Excavation of a votive deposit in a wide crevice in the rock south of the temple was completed: finds date from the late fourth to the second century BC. A large quantity of portable objects was found, of exceptional quality: notable are marble and soft limestone statuettes mostly from a local workshop, many figurines, statue bases, some of which preserve parts of votive inscriptions, small pots (lamps, small bowls, unguentaria, jugs and amphoriskoi), bronze and silver coins, and a quantity of Corinthian roof tiles stamped AAYZEIQN.

Leukas, area between Kalligonio and Karyotes (A. Vrettou property). G. Pliakou (then 12th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 576-78) the discovery of two poorly-preserved houses of ancient Leukas in continued rescue excavation, which extend beneath the road (Fig. 74). A stone-built water channel, preserved for some 10m, was further revealed (the greater part having been found in 1999). The eastern part probably originally extended to the east edge of the insula, but was destroyed in a later building phase of the houses. The house walls are poorly preserved and belong to different building phases: both are bordered to the east by a strong polygonal retaining wall supporting the terrace, preserved to ca. 1.5m high. To the east of this is the line of one of the main east-west roads of the town. The western part of the north house (house A) was fully exposed; many internal walls appear to have been removed in a later building phase or during more recent cultivation. The disturbed fill inside the house contains fifth-century and Late Hellenistic pottery. The south house, B, was better preserved: both the east and west external walls were traced, and parts of the north wall noted. The interior walls belong to different construction phases. In the eastern part of the house are two adjoining rooms with at least two building phases and two destruction deposits (the older of which contains architec- tural spolia). To the older phase also belong traces of a pebble floor in red mortar. In the western part of the house, which was probably a Hellenistic extension, there are three areas, the largest of which was an open court with a rain-water drain channel running across it. A further channel is traced outside, along the west wall of the house; this ran along the narrow lane dividing the houses. Finds date the main building phase and the main destruction deposit to the Hellenistic period, while use of the area dates back at least to the fifth century BC. Kalligonio, between Kalligonio and Karyotes (road improvement works). G. Pliakou (then 12th EPCA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 578-79) the results of work in three sectors along the Lefkada-Nidri road from the turn to Kalligonio to Spasmeni Vrysi, a route which runs the entire length of the ancient city from the north to the south arm of the fortification. In sector A (ca. 150m south of the north fortification) were walls defining a room, probably of an ancient house, in polygonal masonry, inside which was a destruction deposit. There was likely a further room to the east. In sector B the corner of a building in roughly -worked blocks was located, with architectural members and an inscribed grave stele of northwestern Greek type. Sector T had sections of small walls of small worked blocks. Area of Megali Vrysi M. Stavraka property. G. Pliakou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr 579-80) the discovery of a peribolos, eight graves and three reburials on the eastern slope of the Katharia hill, close to the area on its southern slope where a large section of the north cemetery of the ancient city has been found. Five of the graves and the three reburials were found inside the peribolos, and the other three outside. Outside the peribolos was a further retaining wall, with a passage between it and the peribolos. Four of the burials were cist 74. Leukas: area between Kalligonio and Karyotes, general view of houses.</page><page sequence="76">76 CATHERINE MORGAN tombs, two were tile graves, one a limestone sarcophagus and one a pit grave. The cists were built of hard limestone slabs, in one case including re-used grave stelae. The tile graves included re-used tiles marked AA. Two of the reburials were made in a simple pit-like opening defined with a row of stones: the third was included in the sarcophagus to the side of the main burial. Between the graves was an offering place with traces of burning and with broken pottery set on cover tiles. Most tombs were oriented northwest-southeast, apart from the tile graves which were east-west. Two of the cist tombs held child burials. One, of a boy, had two terracotta figurines, a doll, one iron and one bronze strigil and many astragaloi. Among the other tombs, one female cist burial had, apart from pottery, a silver pin and a bronze mirror. The grave goods date the tombs to the Late Classical and Hellenistic periods. In the fill above the level of the tombs were fragments of two stele bases. A. Lazari property. G. Pliakou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr 580) the excavation of the southwestern part of a Roman farmstead, much of which was found in 1997- 1998. Two further rooms were found extending to the south boundary of the house, making a row of six contingent rooms running east-west. The lower parts of the walls were preserved, in rubble and broken tile with mortar, with a mortar coating probably to support a cut block super- structure. An extensive deposit of roof tiles covered the whole building. Finds include an inscribed grave stele in secondary usage. Philosophon Street. G. Pliakou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 580-82) the discovery of part of a Roman building in the course of widening this road which runs round the south side of Lefkada. The walls are in opus reticulatum with some sections in opus testaceum. In the southwestern part of the plot were rooms of a second complex, built in unworked stone or re-used material. Expres (07/04/10) carries a report of further rescue excavation at Philosophon Street, which has revealed a further collection of (mainly cist) tombs of adults and children, as well as a part of a farmstead. Karya, Monastery of Agios Ioannis. P. Dimitrakopoulou (8th EBA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 604) on excavation around the exterior of the church. Three simple pit graves were found on the east and north sides of the church, without goods. Pottery from the excavation as a whole dates to the Early Christian period. Kastro Agias Mavras. P. Dimitrakopoulou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 604-05) the discovery, in the course of an extensive programme of cleaning and conservation, of a tower by the south wall which belongs to the oldest phase of the fortification, probably under Venetian rule. CENTRAL GREECE By Dominique Mulliez PHOKIS AND WEST LOKRIS (10th EPCA: 24th EBA) Amphissa (N. Kordoni and N. Desterli Streets, electricity company property). R. Kolonia (formerly Director, 10th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 460- 61) the discovery of part of the south cemetery of Amphissa. Eight Hellenistic tombs were excavated, containing pottery and glass dating from the mid fourth century BC to the beginning of the Roman period. Five of these were cist graves with limestone cover plaques, two were cists covered with terracotta plaques and one was a tile grave. Delphi Publication: R. Kolonia, To apxccioXoyiKO Mouoei'o AeAcpcbv (Athens 2009). Kirrha. J. Zurbach (EfA) and D. Skorda (formerly Director, 10th EPCA) report on the 2009 excavation season, which aimed to explore occupation on the Middle Bronze Age to Late Bronze Age transition and to establish a stratigraphically-based chronology for the region. Three sectors were opened to the side of the French excavations of 1937-1938 (Fig. 75), 1 on the east slope of the tell, ca. 20m south of the potter's kiln discovered in 1989, and 2 and 3 on the west slope. An LHIIIA ceramic deposit of some importance was found in sector 1, as well as several smaller ones of the end of the Middle Helladic in sectors 2 and 3. While it had been hoped that sector 1 would produce evidence of LHI- II occupation, corresponding to the period of use of the potter's kiln in the adjacent field, remains of this period proved to have been obliterated by the construction of two small kilns (probably potter's kilns) in LHII (Fig. 76), by a large ceramic deposit and by pits filled with animal remains. Evidence of this kind fits expectations of activ- ities at the edge of the settlement (which during this period was considerably reduced in comparison with previous periods). In sectors 2 and 3, examination of the last phases of settlement clarified the circumstances under which this part of the site was abandoned, after a LHII occupation phase attested by the test pits of 1989. Four tombs were excavated, revealing nine generally well-preserved skeletons which provide evidence for the funerary rituals practised. One cist was used for three consecutive burials; another was probably a secondary deposit of numerous skeletons; the third was a tomb enclosed in a circle of several courses of rubble (Fig. 77); and the fourth structure, built in clay probably shaped as bricks, was also framed by a stone circle. Their strati- graphic positions and the only vase recovered from one of them confirm that three of the burials postdate the settlement and may date to the transition period, while the fourth is contemporary with one of the last phases of occupation, in the second half of the Middle Helladic period. Kirrha (M. Pappa property). D.

The walls were of mud-brick on stone foundations. The wall of the long north side of house A (in phase II), found collapsed onto the floor of the building, consisted of mud-bricks of two types, one of pure clay and the other of clay mixed with sand and a limestone component. Material recovered dates the first construction phase to MHI and the following two to MHII. This consists mostly of grey Minyan (Fig. 79) and matt-painted pottery (Fig. 80), as well as stone tools and food waste (animal bones, shell, etc.). After the settlement was abandoned, the area was used sporadically as a cemetery, with tombs cut into the destruction levels of phases II and III. Eight graves (one enchytrismos and seven cist tombs) contained the burials of infants and children. 80. Kirrha, Pappa property: Middle Helladic matt-painted amphora. Antikyra. S. Raptopoulos (10th EPCA) and Ch. Koilakou (Director, 1st EBA) report ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 461, 160-61) the results of rescue excavations in 2000. At the Archaic cemetery (Elaionas Antikyras: Soultanaki-Tabitsika property) excavation in the north- western part revealed mostly simple pit graves covered with stone mounds and containing enchytrismoi and grave offerings. Traces of cremations were also found. The most important tomb contained two figurines, one of a warrior and the other of a rider. At the property of the Church of Agios Nikoiaos a large paved area, oriented towards the sea, may be related to the complex of Imperial Roman commercial warehouses, as indicated by ceramic evidence. At the property of O. Koureli, the toichobate of a monumental Hellenistic building was re-used for building complexes of the Late Roman and Early Byzantine periods. At Omirou and Karaiskaki Streets (O.T. 27) Early Byzantine pottery and architectural remains were found on the property of K.M. and F. Gerakari. On the neigh- bouring plots (of S. and K. Koureli), nine walls were discovered with three construction phases. The first phase is characterized by a careful construction of worked blocks; the second, to which most structures belong, is less carefully built, and dates to the Late Roman or Early Byzantine period; the third is represented by the continu- ation of a wall found on the neighbouring plot. Municipal gymnasium. S. Raptopoulos reports (AEThSE 1, 677-87; cf. BCH 128-29 [2004-2005], 1406) the discovery of an Early Helladic settlement. The remains of six oval houses were revealed, plus those of a wall which served as a barrier to protect them from flood. Traces of a peribolos - the boundary of one settlement quarter - were identified close to houses E and Tt. Among finds, mainly from house B, were millstones and mortars as well as obsidian blades, basalt and hard limestone axes, sea shells and wheelmade Early Helladic pottery. Material found in what are characterized as store- rooms could relate to a kitchen or to a workshop. Karakolithos. Ph. Dasios (10th EPCA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 462) the discovery of an inscribed block at this site, at the level of the tunnel in the main road from Livadeia to Delphi. The surface of the block is roughly worked: on the upper part, the word EYPOTTITA is contained within a moulding. Other blocks from a Hellenistic funerary monument were found nearby. West of the tunnel, a Classical and Hellenistic cemetery belonging to an unknown settlement has previously been excavated. BOEOTIA (9th EPCA: 23rd EBA) Publication: A.

Beneath the tiled floor were five tombs and numerous reburied skeletal remains. Under the narthex was a pit burial. The small quantity of material recovered comprised iron nails, fragments of glass and two bronze coins (half tetarteron of Manuel I Comnenos). North wing of cells. Ch. Koilakou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 159) the results of excavation in the north wing of monastic cells. The ground floor in Byzantine times, situated behind the post-Byzantine cells, was a single vaulted space. The post-Byzantine cells were built on a terrace created during the Byzantine period (10th to 11th century) at a higher level than the court to the west of the Church of the Virgin. A staircase was discovered in the vaulted post- Byzantine room explored in 1999, leading, via a ground- floor opening, north of the Church of the Virgin at the level of the prostoon (11th century) and the tribune of the Katholikon. Agios Vlasios (Panopeus). E. Vlachogianni reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 402-04) the discovery, in an agricultural area north of the village, of several Classical and Hellenistic tombs (pits, with black-glazed kantharoi and figurines, and tile graves containing few or no offerings), and part of a finial from the upper part of a Hellenistic funerary stele in local marble. Architectural remains (in field 199) are hard to characterize. Only one room is well preserved; the walls are crudely constructed and the levelling course of lime mortar from a tiled floor is preserved; two cisterns were dug in the southwest corner of the room. The lack of roof tiles or other roofing material is notable. The pottery - mainly domestic ware - dates to the Late Roman period. Chaironeia Cemetery (Platia Strata and Vourlies). E. Kountouri (9th EPCA) reports ( AEThSE 1, 781-82) excavation in a cemetery which extends over an area of ca. 1km2 northwest of the ancient settlement. All types of tombs were represented (tile graves, pits, cremations, cist graves and terracotta larnakes), dating from the sixth to the second century BC. Pottery from the tombs was mostly Boeotian, including black-glazed kantharoi, cups, kotylae, alabastra and bolsals, as well as figurines of women, birds and other animals; pyxides and kraters are less commonly found. Hellenistic farm. E. Kountouri reports ( AEThSE 1, 783) the discovery of a farmstead on municipal land northeast of Chaironeia. The complex has 14 rooms of 81. Thespiai, archaeological collection 218: inscribed funerary stele depicting 'hero-riders'. unequal size; five rooms continue beyond the boundaries of the plot. The strength of the wall construction indicates the existence of a second storey and the foundations are preserved of the colonnade of the peristyle court. Six structures of tiles found in the rooms and in the court are associated with the sifting and drying of agricultural produce. Coarse and semi-coarse domestic pottery (pithoi, amphorae and a lekanis) date from the first century BC to the first century AD. There is a significant quantity of loomweights, but no evidence to determine whether textile production exceeded the ordinary needs of the farm. The establishment of a farmstead on this site indicates that the northwest cemetery of Chaironeia was abandoned in the second century BC. Kovras-Agkortses. E. Kountouri reports ( AEThSE 1, 785) the discovery of a marble honorific or funerary statue of a male figure draped in a himation with the right hand resting on his breast. This is a fourth-century BC type revived in the Roman period.

Among the tomb contents were pottery and glass vessels (amphorae, jugs and unguentaria), a gold leaf and three coins - one of Antigonos Gonatas (277-239 BC) and two of the Boeotian koinon (244-197 BC). The cover slab is a funerary stele of the second half of the second century BC, re-used with the inscription EYAAMA OMOA- OIXE XAIPETE. The main phases of use of the tomb span the first to third centuries AD. Chaironeia. E. Kountouri reports (AEThSE 1, 785) remains of the Roman city revealed in a series of rescue excavations.

Vlachogianni reports ( ADelt [2000] Chr, 400) the discovery, in the course of work on the water-pipe network northwest of the theatre, of three sections of the conduit which transported water from the theatre spring into the town (over a distance of ca. 400m) (Fig. 82). The walls are built of blocks of the same type as those used for the acropolis fortifications, as well as inscribed blocks. The construction may date to the Roman period. Tombs. E. Vlachogianni reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 401-02) the discovery of tombs in two locations: on the Valaora property, two simple tile graves could not be dated due to the absence of offerings; on the Papangeli property, in the northwest of Chaironeia, eight Classical and Hellenistic tombs are reported (four tile graves, two cists and two pit graves). The offerings in the pit graves (black-glazed kantharoi and skyphoi) date to the fifth century, as does an ithyphallic figurine (Fig. 83). The tile graves date to the fourth and third centuries and contain very little (a lekythos in one grave and an unguentarium and a small oinochoe in the other). 83.

Koilakou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 144, 147-49) on restoration at this church (a long basilica in the southeast of the village, with a templon). The wall-paintings were mostly executed in 1751, slightly after the church was built. The narthex, with its wooden roof, is a later addition. Between it and the main part of the building is a tower. The walls were roughly built and contain several spolia (notably an inscription and a relief block), while the altar consists of an Early Byzantine epithima, with a cross and finials, set on a capital and column section. Research into the construction of the roof revealed a trefoil-mouthed jug of the mid 18th century. The wall-paintings were restored and a new study made of them (Fig. 85). Lake Copais, dyke. V. Aravantinos reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 393-94) that excavation along the road from Orchomenos to Kastro revealed a section (83.5m long, 8.1m wide and 0.7m high) of the dyke protecting local fields from flooding from Lake Copais. It was built of variously-sized stones set onto a clay foundation level and covered in a clay-rich earth. Sarakinos Cave (Copais Project). A. Sampson (University of the Aegean) and F. Megaloudi report (AEThSE 1, 593-606; cf BCH 124 [2000], 869-70) a study of faunal evidence from this excavation which shows that wheat, more precisely einkorn ( Triticum monococcum), which constitutes 99% of the grain recovered, was cultivated along with figs and pistachio during the Late Neolithic period. Vathy Aulidos, Church of Agios Ioannis Kalyvitis. Ch. Koilakou reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 151) a preliminary study of the oldest church in the village (which predates 1850).

Finds include Byzantine and post- Byzantine pottery (glazed tablewares, kitchen and storage vessels and utensils, and lamps), as well as five coins, animal bones, shells and small objects of iron, bronze and glass. 16 Tseva Street (O.T 379, V. Kolesia property). Ch. Koilakou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 152-53) poorly preserved architectural remains. Two walls apparently belong to a building which continues under the neigh- bouring plot. Much Byzantine pottery was recovered, as well as eight bronze coins, a bronze pin and a hook. Five pits with walls coated in hydraulic mortar contained Mycenaean to post-Byzantine pottery, Byzantine coins, scrap iron and, in pit 1, a lead seal (0.039m in diameter and weighing 38.13g) of the Despot Manuel Comnenus Doukas (AD 1230-1237). On the obverse is a bust of an unbearded Christ with the inscription C/OE/MM/A - XC/NOY/HA; on the reverse, Manuel Comnenos Doukas standing, with the legend MA/NOYHA/AEC /TTOT KOM/N/NOA/OYK/AC (Fig. 86).</page><page sequence="82">82 DOMINIQUE MULLIEZ 86. Thebes 16Tseva Street: lead seal of the Despot Manuel Comnenus Doukas (1230-1237). In the southwest of the plot, V. Aravantinos reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 390) a floor of bricks in lime mortar. The levelling course, of trimmed stones, is partially preserved. Pottery associated with this floor is mostly first-century AD terra sigillata. To the north of it, Mycenaean remains have been found, notably three walls associated with a floor of beaten earth and lime mortar on a bed of pebbles. Oidipodos and Pelopidou Streets (O.T 314, E. Kylaphi property). Ch. Koilakou reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 153) the discovery of a building of worked limestone blocks with a beaten earth floor and abundant Byzantine pottery. Two pit deposits contained post- Byzantine and modern pottery plus coins. Remains of the EHII-III settlement are found in deeper levels (reported by V. Aravantinos, ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 389-90). Eleven walls were revealed, defining at least two rooms; several refuse pits were also found. In one building, several construction and remodelling phases can be identified on the basis of six successive floors with postholes: associated dumps and storage pits contained Ag. Marina style pottery and grey Minyan. The building was destroyed in EHIII. Two terracotta arched structures in contact with one of the walls are identified as ovens. The east wall of a monumental Byzantine building was found in the north of the plot. Remains of earlier phases were destroyed in its construction - in particular, curved walls associated with floor levels pitted with irregular holes or cavities, under an EHIII destruction deposit. Kadmeion. Ch. Koilakou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 154-55) on rescue excavation on the ramparts. Two sections of the medieval rampart were revealed. In the eastern part of Oidipodos Street, a 17m long stretch, built of large re-used blocks, is dated to the 13th century AD by the pottery recovered. A further 11m long stretch on Threpsiadou Street, in the northwestern part of the Kadmeion, was built of unworked blocks and worked soft limestone blocks, and packed with brick and strong mortar (cf. BCH 128-29 [2004-2005], 1414). Part of the Late Roman rampart was revealed in the course of pipe-laying on Oidipodos Street - two walls of worked soft limestone, brick and mortar, preserved to a height of three courses. The Late Roman date is confirmed by a coin. Moschopodi (Karatza property), Church of Agia Photeini. Ch. Koilakou reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 155-58; cf. BCH 128-29 [2004-2005], 1416) the completion of excavation of this three-aisled basilica. Finds include a new tomb (Til) outside the north wall, dug into the rock (with three steps leading down into it), and covered with a slab. The upper levels of fill inside contained fragments of the painted decoration of the church, tiles, table and storage vessels, part of a ring from a beehive and fragments of glass vessels. South of the narthex, a rectangular cutting covered by two slabs leads to a rock-cut basement comprising four rooms with traces of plaster on the walls and floors. This must have served a funerary purpose, but only a very little material escaped looting. Two silver coins were found, including a tournois of Andrea Contarini (AD 1367- 1382), as well as scattered bone. Rampart of the lower city. V. Aravantinos reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 392-93) the excavation of an extension to the visible section of the rampart on Zoodochou Pigis Street. The exposed section, built of dressed blocks, forms a redan corresponding to part of a rectangular bastion. The interior face is not preserved. Athanasiou property. K. Kalliga (9th EPCA) describes {AEThSE 1, 758-68; cf. BCH 128-29 [2004-2005], 1411- 12) a fourth Hellenistic house discovered on a plot in the northeast of modern Thebes, close to others previously excavated on the opposite side of the Isminos river. Two rooms and a central court were revealed, as well as traces of a further series of rooms on the east side of the court. This court is paved in brick and had a pit in the northwest with a stone rim: two squares probably held columns to support a protective cover or lifting device. A water channel (of square section with a tile cover) ran across the court. Traces of an earlier phase were found in the northeast of the house. One almost complete room of a Classical house was excavated, containing a small rock-cut cistern: traces of fire were noted. The Hellenistic phase of the house is dated to the third century on the basis of the pottery recovered. Pyri. E. Kountouri and N. Liaros (9th EPCA) report {AEThSE 2 [2006], 853-62) the discovery of a round Late EHI refuse pit (lm in diameter, 2m deep) during the construction of a sewer. The pit contained rubble, pottery, animal bone and a spondylus shell. It seems to be a closed, single deposit, akin to the domestic dumps known from Eutresis, Lithares and Marathon Tsepl. The pottery from the pit was manufactured from two forms of clay paste. One, rich in iron, red or red-orange in colour and containing a variable quantity of inclusions, was used for coarsewares, semi-coarsewares and flnewares. The other, pure clay and black or pale yellow, was used only for fine ware. Among the coarsewares and semi-coarsewares, at least two pithoi are present, but most open shapes are bowls and cups, often with a rolled rim, and closed vessels generally have a wide-necked, full- bodied profile. A few sherds have incised, impressed or plastic decoration with simple linear motifs. Parallels for individual vessels are found especially at Eutresis and Lithares and, in general, this deposit appears very homogeneous. The impressed and incised decoration, which occurs at several sites across central Greece in EHI, indicates a chronological comparison with the period represented in the Cyclades by the Kambos group, although such connections are clearly a matter of influence rather than import as previously held. Thebes, cemeteries V. Aravantinos reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 391-92) on discoveries made in the course of pipe-laying by the water company. These include a child burial in a Late Geometric pithos with a grave offering of six vessels (on Kalatzi</page><page sequence="83">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 83 Street), a Late Hellenistic rock-cut water channel (on Isminion Street) and refuse pits on Amphionos Street. A tile grave and three refuse pits containing plain and glazed Late Byzantine pottery was found on Ag. Meletiou Street. On Kithaironos Street were three pit graves containing a little bone, pieces of limestone block, tiles and pottery of the late second to early first century BC. Settlement evidently contracted at this time, and the area was used for burials. Conservation of the upper part of a white marble grave stele found on Ag. Athanasiou street in 1999 was completed. The stele, decorated with finials in low relief, dates to the fourth century, but it bears a later inscription - KAEONYMOS / KAOI2A - of the second half of the second century BC (Fig. 87). 87. Thebes, Ag. Athanasiou Street: part of a funerary stele (Thebes Museum 32582). Northeast cemetery, OSE property. V. Aravantinos reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 377-88; AEThSE 1, 729- 49) on rescue excavation in 2000-2001 for the construction of the new Piraeus-Thessaloniki railway line. Part of this extensive cemetery was exposed at the site of Kokkala; through it runs the ancient road from the Proitides Gate to Chalcis, which predates the estab- lishment of the cemetery (Fig. 88). The cemetery occupies the site of a Final Neolithic II to EHI settlement and cemetery of which E. Tsota gives a full report {AEThSE 2, 863-80). Prehistoric levels are preserved to varying degrees across the entire site (in places being disturbed by later tombs). Of the 25 Neolithic tombs, one was an enchytrismos and the others simple pits - other finds comprise 12 refuse pits, nine stone piles, five floors and 18 postholes, as well as settlement remains and an apsidal building on stone foundations. In addition to the pottery found in seven of the 25 tombs, notable finds are four anthropomorphic terracotta figurines (an oval male head, a seated figure, a female and a steatopygous form). The nine stone piles, which form part of the settlement remains, were found in the northern part of the excavation area. They were associated with domestic or red monochrome pottery, medium-sized storage vessels and sherds of smaller vessels. The apsidal building in the southern sector is 12m long and has a maximum width of 9m: the pottery and the figurines noted above date its occupation to LNII. The later cemetery was excavated in two sectors, north and south of the railway line. Two hundred and sixty nine tombs were found in the southern sector (1,200m2), dating from the seventh century BC to the first century AD. The majority of the 30 cist tombs are Hellenistic (three are Classical), and many of them re-use older grave stelae (mostly inscribed) in their walls or as cover slabs. One is a double grave (N 52 and N 59) with a partition separating the burials. Among the tile graves, 15 contained child inhumations dating from the Classical period to the end of the Hellenistic. One burial (N 113), probably of a woman, had two amphorae in the corners, with two bronze pyxides (one of which contained bronze hooks and coins), carbonized wood, nails and strigils, as well as traces of linen cloth on the curved surface of one of the tiles fallen on the head of the deceased. The large number of pins found in this tomb further indicates that the deceased was covered in shrouds. The majority of the 47 cremations date to the Classical period (with several Archaic): they are rectangular, with settings to support the wooden superstructure (traces of the beams have been found, as well as of fixings for vertical posts). One terracotta larnax (N 148), covered by a tile, contained the bones of an infant. Finally, one should note the graves of two horses and those of dogs (10 successive burials in the same tomb, N 222) (Figs. 89, 90, 91). In the northern sector, the first tombs were found 87m from the ancient road, leaving an empty area for which there is no obvious explanation. A total of 173 tombs was excavated, including 16 cists, 73 tile graves, 55 pit graves, 10 enchytrismoi , 14 cremations, one larnax and two animal burials. Abundant offerings recovered from the graves include pottery, figurines, sculpture (Fig. 92) (including the head of a kouros of the end of the sixth century), small bronze items and iron nails. Carbonized fruits (figs and almonds) were found on the pyres in the northern sector. One notable find, in tile grave N 263, is a small hoard (of eight bronze coins and three glass paste beads) in a pot which served as a strong-box. E. Vlachogianni reports (Kepiuaria OiXias vol. 1, 69-79) in detail on this material. The coins, five of which come from mints close to Boeotia and the remaining three from Boeotia, give a terminus post quern of ca. 146 BC. The deceased, probably an adolescent (noting the small size of the tomb), was laid out supine with the hoard vessel at his feet. Northwest cemetery, property of P. Zoulamoglou. V. Aravantinos reports {AEThSE 1, 740-41) on rescue excavation conducted in the northwest cemetery in 2002. The discovery of 88 tombs on the Zoulamoglou plot (200m from the OSE property noted above) indicates the large area covered by the northeast cemetery. These tombs were organized into very tight groups, noting also the discovery of sections of peribolos and socles for grave monuments. They date from the sixth to the third century BC, with three enchytrismoi of the 12th century BC (LHIIIC), and comprise 11 cist graves, 25 pits, 16 tile graves, 24 cremations and eight urned cremations, as well as four ossuaries. Most sixth-century tombs were pyres, while in the fifth century most were pit graves. The cist graves postdate the fifth century. There were 19 child burials. Most tombs contained pottery, figurines, bronze and iron objects, beads and other small items, as well as fruits.</page><page sequence="84">84 DOMINIQUE MULLIEZ 88.

On the Liakopoulou plot, there are 88 tombs (64 inhumations and 24 cremations) of the eighth to second centuries BC. Thirteen date to the Archaic period (eight cremations and five enchytrismoi ), 34 are Classical (nine tile graves, 14 pits and 11 cremations) and 29 Hellenistic (including 14 cists, seven tile graves, six pits and one cremation). Where age could be determined, 12 were child burials and 44 those of adults. The tombs were arranged on both sides of an open space ca. 8m long, extending beyond the excavation plot. There is no evidence to identify a road here and one might rather see a passageway into the midst of the cemetery. Indeed, the main road linking Thebes to the Copais area passes only a short distance away. 92.

Fifty three tombs (30 tile graves, five pits, four enchytrismoi , three cists, a terracotta larnax, eight crema- tions and two severely damaged graves) date to the Archaic and Classical periods. The Archaic tombs contained a large number of aryballoi and horse figurines, with or without riders. The Classical tombs produced less material - mainly kantharoi, cups and figurines. The Hellenistic tile graves produced abundant grave goods - unguentaria, lagynoi, Macedonian-type amphorae, oinochoae, cups, skyphoi, beakers, plates and Tanagra figurines. Dilesi (ancient Delion).

One cover slab from a pit grave was a reused portion of a Hellenistic stele inscribed with the names TTPIAMOI! and EKABA. Subsequent systematic excavation (reported by A. Chamilaki, AEThSE 2, 1167-86) revealed 48 tombs dating from the Archaic period until the seventh century AD. These include 27 cist tombs, two Late Roman tombs with double chambers, six tile graves, 10 pits and two enchytrismoi. Twelve are child burials. The cist tombs may be divided into four groups according to their construction. The first incorporates many architectural spolia (including cover slabs). The second is made of worked blocks for the lower courses with smaller above, while the third and fourth are of rubble and brick. Grave goods consist of pottery (oinochoae, lekythoi, cups, amphoriskoi and lamps), glass oinochoae and bronze jewellery. EUBOIA (11th EPCA: 23rd EBA) Museum acquisitions Chalcis Museum.

Phases of construction and remod- elling can be distinguished, dating from the fourth century to the late second to early first century BC. The walls and interior structures clearly belong to rooms from one or more houses. A room at the south of the plot is paved (as is an area to the northeast, with three successive floors). One of the rooms west of the central wall (Tl) produced remains of hearths and a TT-shaped structure associated with burnt earth (it is conjectured that this may be due to the products - oil and wine - contained in the storage vessels here). Slabs indicate an arrangement of benches along wall Tl, while bone scattered in an ash layer associated with funerary-related objects (unguen- taria, fragments of relief bowl and a West Slope amphora with twisted handles) indicates that this area may have been used for burials after the second century BC. Finds include 112 bronze coins and three silver, bronze decorative elements from wooden furniture or a chest, as well as a seated Silen figurine in bronze (second-century BC). Michelakou property. Near to a plot excavated in 1997, where potter's kilns and a workshop of the second century BC were discovered, a stone and tile floor and a deposit of iron slag indicate that the workshop quarter extends beyond the area originally excavated ( cf.

Limestone blocks, evidently from a strong wall, belong to a section of the city's fortification. Some 50m to the south, numerous scattered blocks were observed. On the southeast side of the hill, the continuation of the forti- fication was not found: the church of Ag. Ioannis Prodromos stands in this area along with a pit, some 50m away, filled with stones and fragments of tile. Two worked soft limestone blocks found on the edge of the field by the church certainly belong to the fortification. Chalcis 75 Lilantiou Street (K. Oikonomou property). A.

Among the pottery recovered was a Roman lamp from a local workshop. Monis Erion Street, Eighth College/fourth High School of Chalkis (K. Oikonomou property). A. Karapaschalidou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 410) on excavation within the Hellenistic cemetery of Chalkis which revealed a broken inscribed grave stele. This was not in situ, but doubtless relates to the cemetery at Vrontou. Styrou Street (Kikera-Paitari property). A. Karapaschalidou reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 410-11; cf. BCH 128-29 [2004-2005], 1538) that excavation of a plot at Kamares, near the large paved Hellenistic commercial street discovered in 1985, revealed a further section (10.5m long, 1.75-1. 9m wide) of the ancient road between the north port (at Liani Ammos) and the south port (at Ag. Stephanos). The Hellenistic paved road served as the foundation of a Roman road of beaten earth with gravel and tile fragments. Four walls were also found, belonging to two construction phases and associated with coarse and domestic pottery, and Hellenistic and Roman black-glazed wares. In the north of the plot, a refuse pit contained pottery, a pithos, iron slag and shell. At the southern edge of the plot was a well with a terracotta wall-lining, which contained domestic pottery, two iron nails and 18 fragments of marble grave stelae. Vathrovouni (Karamouzi property).

Karapaschalidou reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 412-13) that rescue excavation for the construction of an underground car park revealed 11 enclosure walls (or walls separating tombs) and 21 tombs. Most tombs were rectangular and dug into the ground, but there were also a very few tile graves as well as a small vaulted tomb (IV) of the Early Byzantine period. East of wall T2 was part of a fluted column re-used as a door-jamb and a Hellenistic marble grave stele which bears the inscription rEAQN/MAIQTHZ.

This is the first grave stele to be found in the area of the cemetery of Ag. Stephanos-Arethousa. The preserved text - [ ]YK02TP[ 1 - is fragmentary, but the lettering supports a date in the third century BC. Attali, Churches of Agios Nikolaos and the Presentation of the Virgin. D. Petrou and P. Androudis report ( AEThSE 1, 1165-84) on the restoration of these two churches, which occasioned a detailed study of their architecture and sculp- tural decoration. Cleaning and excavation revealed their plan (cruciform with a dome and narthex): these are the earliest examples of this type of church in Euboia, with the Church of Ag. Nikolaos dated to the end of the 10th century or the start of the 11th, and that of the Presentation of the Virgin soon after on the same model. Both show distinctive architectural traits, such as the three polygonal apses on the exterior, as well as varied sculptural decoration, parts of which were found during excavation at the Church of Ag. Nikolaos and dispersed around the Church of the Presentation of the Virgin. Lefkandi. I.S. Lemos (BSA/Oxford) reports on the 2009 season, which focused on the building sequence of the 'megara' in region I (Fig. 93). This area was used continuously from LHIIIC (Lefkandi phase lb/2a) to the earlier phases of the Early Iron Age: some 50,000 sherds have been recovered. Preliminary reconstruction of the building sequence is as follows. During LHIIICE, the mud-brick walls of a house were demolished, and the material used to level the area for the construction of the first megaron. The mud-brick house was on the same orientation as all other contem- porary houses excavated on Xeropolis, but the megaron differed in orientation and plan. The use of megaron I falls within Lefkandi phase lb/2a. The main room had two phases. The earlier is mostly traced within the room, and includes storage vessels in its northwest area and a small mud-brick feature (perhaps furniture) against the west wall. Still within Lefkandi phase 2a, the main room was restructured to form the LHIIIC megaron 2. Above these levels, the Protogeometric fill covered the entire area of the LHIIIC megaron as levelling for later construction. This is a single deposit with pottery of LHIIIC (Lefkandi phase 2: the latest non-intrusive material being of Lefkandi phase 2b/3). The first building constructed above it had a series of postholes on its central axis and two large post bases in its main room; it is associated with the construction of a series of additional walls. The building dates within Lefkandi phase 2b/3 (LHIIICL/ Submycenaean), and probably had a Protogeometric phase, but Late Geometric disturbance removed the features likely associated with it especially in the north of the building (such evidence as we have for Protogeometric use comes mostly from the southern part). The large Subproto- geometric and Late Geometric pit 13 completely removed the earlier levels in the southwestern part of the building. The 'annexe' is closely associated with the later Protogeometric megaron 2. Here two pits contained much pottery of Lefkandi phase 2b/3, including restorable whole vessels, as well as animal bone. These may represent the remains of a foundation deposit related to the construction of this phase of the megaron. 93.

A new section of the embankment wall M23 dates to ca. 725 BC. This wall was abandoned at the end of the eighth century (when it was destroyed by a refuse pit containing much LGII pottery) and replaced by another embankment (M24) for flood control. A further section of wall belonging to a LGII apsidal building was revealed. Its function remains unclear, but several floors and three refuse pits in the area to the east, between the building and the embankment, indicate continuous occupation from the Late Geometric to the Subgeometric (second half of the eighth to the early seventh century BC). Although Archaic and Classical pottery was recovered, no walls of these periods were found. Several structures were disturbed by Hellenistic activity, but it currently seems that there was scant occuption in the area for more than three centuries. During the Hellenistic period, three roads, to the west, north and east, defined an area of more than 200m2 (the southern border is unknown). Several small walls relate to this first occupation phase, but it is hard to reconstruct the organization of the area. Several refuse pits date from the late fourth to early third century BC, and examination of these closed contexts shows a high proportion of cookwares. One pit contained fine pottery, including West Slope from local or regional workshops. A series of three rectangular rooms was built in the second half of the second century BC (the foundation trenches contain numerous moulded bowls of the long- petal type produced after 150 BC). They yielded no evidence for their function, although the furnace and slags discovered in 2008 indicate that there may have been a metalworker's shop outside room A. Sections of millstone in room B indicate the grinding of grain. The plan (noting the likelihood of further rooms to the south) could be inter- preted as a complex of shops or workshops opening onto the main north-south street, one of the most important in the city. These workshops remained in use into the Late Roman period (second to third century AD). In a second construction phase (dated to the third century AD by a coin of Caracalla), the foundation walls of the rectangular rooms were raised with a foundation of conglomerate and re-used limestone blocks. Communication with the main street was maintained via entrances defined with thresholds. A pit opened in the northwest corner of room A in the second century BC remained in use. 94.

Excavation in the west completed the plan of wall M6, which should be linked to the large Roman 'temenos' discovered by R Themelis ( cf PAE [1976], 72). The construction of this important public building required the destruction of many older buildings, levelling of the area and the abandonment of two roads in use since the start of the Hellenistic period. The date of the Roman monument remains uncertain (perhaps second-century AD?). That this commercial and manufacturing quarter remained important in Imperial times is confirmed by the discovery on O.T. 737 of probable shops and workshops along the main street leading to the temenos.

Roman remains are particularly numerous and well preserved, and it is likely that under the Principate, this quarter, at the foot of the acropolis, became the new city centre. The intent is to conduct an open area excavation covering some 2,000m2 (E/600 SW) in order to unite the various remains in a large archaeo- logical park. An exploratory campaign in 2009 aimed to locate the main axes of the ancient city grid. A north-south lane defines an extensive insula which was residential in the Hellenistic period and occupied by workshops in Imperial times. To the south lie the foundations of a monumental building of the Augustan period, with several water-supply installations of the second and third centuries AD. Two round Roman kilns (probably lime kilns) were found. River channel and west cemetery (Fig. 96). S. Fachard (ESAG) reports on rescue excavation conducted under the direction of A. Psalti (then 11th EPCA, now Director, 10th EPCA) following the torrential rain in central Euboia in early September 2009 which caused serious damage at Eretria. The river which borders the ancient city to the west flooded in several places, especially close to the West Gate, bringing with it cubic metres of soil and parts of its banks and of the modern road. Archaeological remains, which are particularly dense near the West Gate, were not spared: numerous tombs were opened or swept away by the torrent and 30 stelae (27 of which were inscribed) were 96. Eretria: plan of river channel and west cemetery area. dispersed on the river bed. Excavation took place in three sectors over a ca. 200m stretch of the river bank - in the south (close to the propyrgion of the West Gate), in the north (close to a funerary enclosure) and in the centre, where many ancient walls have been discovered. In the south, six tile graves were discovered on the river bank close to the propyrgion of the West Gate. Most had been damaged by the torrent, with the exception of tomb T10. This cist, carefully constructed of tiles and white mortar, contained two black-glazed cups, two lekythoi, an iron knife or razor, a bronze fish-hook and animal bones. In the north, the torrent had stripped an area of ca. 150m2, revealing part of a funerary enclosure defined by a large wall. A second, parallel wall behind it (M4) defined a second terrace containing cist tombs. There is a striking variety of grave types: tile tombs for an adult (T8) and for children (Tl, T5), a cist tomb built of large conglomerate blocks (T2), a terracotta larnax (T17) and pits with faced walls (T6 and T16). The torrent had swept away the tomb contents, both bone and grave offerings. It was nonetheless possible to distinguish three inhumations (T6, T8 and T17) and two possible cremations (T2 and T16). The larnax in tomb T17 is made up of two moulded terracotta sections, a type rarely used at Eretria: it contained a white-ground lekythos set at the feet of the deceased. In the central area, along the 200m stretch of river bank separating the north and south excavations, many walls were exposed (some previously known). These were cleaned, rebuilt and entered on the city plan. Several sections seem to align with the west embankment discovered by the West Gate, confirming that the river was canalized late, probably just before the seventh century. The masonry of the fine polygonal wall M6 is similar to that of the rampart built around 400 BC: it might belong to the west facade of a projecting tower or to a reconstruction of the Archaic embankment. A rectangular base of conglomerate blocks may be a funerary monument similar to that found behind the West Gate. One wall (M5) belongs to a large complex, the plan of which is incom- plete and hard to interpret: it might be part of defensive works or a bridge. Artemidoros Amarysias Avenue (Louka property). A. Karapaschalidou and A. Psalti report ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 413-15) on excavation between the Sanctuary of Isis and the ancient agora, which revealed two or three phases of construction. The area is cut by a main street (5m wide) which runs southwest-northeast towards the Sanctuary of Isis, bordered by walls on each side (that on the west is double). A pit was excavated to the west of the road. The area south of the road is occupied by many pithoi, 14 of which were found in situ. Nothing was found inside them, but they likely served to store grain (Fig. 97). Malakonta (Papadopoulou property). A. Psalti reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 415-16) on rescue excavation near the cemetery of modern Eretria. Part of a funerary enclosure was found (two walls of limestone blocks forming an angle) with the remains of a pyre inside, associated with third to second-century BC cup sherds. In the east of the plot is a built cist of limestone blocks covered with tiles and limestone slabs, following a tradition found at Eretria and at Oropos in the Classical period. The body was laid supine with a bronze ring, iron strigil and black-glazed olpe placed by the feet.</page><page sequence="91">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 91 97.

Karystos, cemeteries A. Chatzidimitriou reports tombs from two rescue excava- tions (AEThSE 2, 1067-84). Mazes (Gangou property). A funerary enclosure with three tombs and a large number of fragmentary and intact vases vases around them was located. A limestone sarcophagus covered with two limestone slabs contained a two-handled vase and a bronze cup (with Macedonian parallels which date to the fourth to third century BC) with, outside, fourth-century black-glazed plates. Under the sarcophagus was a small cist tomb of schist slabs, containing a white-ground lekythos and fifth-century pottery including a feeding cup, but no bone. Southeast of these two tombs was a tile grave, the goods in which (a black-glazed feeding cup and a white-ground lekythos, a kylix, and a lekane and lid) date to the fifth century. While no bones are preserved, it seems that the enclosure was used only for child burials. The tombs were surrounded by a semicircular enclosure. Close to the third tomb were two stone constructions, probably funerary repositories: little pottery was found within them, but outside were many vessels and figurines of the first half of the fifth century. This practice of placing pots and figurines beneath the loose stone surfacing covering the funerary structures is also found on a neighbouring plot (there involving lekythoi and other vases and figurines of the fifth and fourth centuries BC). Xanemo (Verouchi property). Nine tombs were excavated (six cists and three tile graves), of which three were single and four were multiple burials. Anthropological study has shown that the deceased were male and female, from five to 45 years of age. The burials were accompanied by a quantity of pottery (especially unguentaria and skyphoi), but also by glass unguentaria and amphoriskoi, and terracotta figurines. A number of gold leaves originally adorned clothing. The cemetery was in use from the second century BC to the second century AD. Xanemo (Baganiari property). M. Chidiroglou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 416-18) on rescue excavation conducted in 2000. Remains were revealed of a cist tomb and two separate buildings (one in the south of the plot and the other in the north). The tomb contained several burials of the early Imperial period. The building in the south of the plot is preserved to foundation level: three rooms were excavated. The entrance is via the easternmost room (an opening was made in wall 6). It may belong to a workshop of the Early Hellenistic period laid out behind the town and close to the cemeteries. Terracotta figurines from tombs. M.

M. Chidiroglou reports {AEThSE 2, 1085-1105) the results of rescue excavation. On the Alexopoulou property by the shore were two Late Roman semicircular walls (9.7m and 7.5m in diameter) with partitions towards the interior of the circle. These constructions should be considered together with harbour installations observed on the neighbouring plot when the sea retreated during a strong storm in 2005. In the north bay is a strong east-west wall with perpendi- cular walls against its south side (on the Keleri plot): there is another similar construction to the west of this. South of these walls were the foundations of two orthogonal towers, between which are traces of probable ship-sheds. These structures are likely fourth century in date. In the south bay are the foundations of four walls running northeast-southwest towards the sea, plus cuttings for further walls. Southeast of Kastri, on Cape Mandili, is a strong terrace wall inside which further construction is visible. Pottery indicates Hellenistic and Roman occupation; a Byzantine fortification is previously attested. Skyros Palamari. L. Parlama reports ( Kepiuaria OiXias vol. 2, 227-41) on excavation conducted under the aegis of the TDPEAE from 2000-2007, as part of a programme of restoration and site presentation completed in 2008. The focus was the fortification of the settlement inhabited between EHII and Middle Helladic. The fortification, in two major sections (northwest and south), encloses some 1.7ha, and has four or five horseshoe-shaped bastions, a ditch and a proteichisma in front of the northwest section. It is of the same type as the fortification at Chalandriani, dated to the end of EHII. Excavation at various points revealed a complete stratigraphy, and all the redevelopments and reworkings are visible, especially at the level of the bastions. Excavation between bastions H and Z revealed a series of rooms built before the rampart: they provide a terminus post quern for its construction and information about the first phase of occupation at the site (Palamari I).

The results are comparable with those from other Late Neolithic and Middle Helladic populations. Mitrou. E. Zachou (14th EPCA) and A. Van de Moortel (ASCS A/Tennessee) report on the 2009 study season. Study of the survey pottery established that material from the northeast area was mainly Early Helladic and Middle Helladic, with small admixtures of Late Helladic and later, supporting the hypothesis that the area northeast of building D was abandoned in LHI. Study of the architecture and pottery revealed that the 13.5m x 8.25m rectangular enclosure of building D belonged only to the second and third architectural phases of the building. In its first (LHI) phase, building D was a sprawling complex with mostly thin walls and earthen floors (with the exception of two rooms with fine plaster floors). There are no floor deposits with which to charac- terize the activities practised. At this time, building D was flanked to the west by the cobbled road 1. During the second architectural phase (LHI to LHIIB), the northeast of this complex became a funerary building. A rectangular enclosure, with walls ca. 0.7m wide of large, roughly squared stones, was set over the remains of the first phase, sometimes breaking through earlier walls. There is evidence to indicate that it had a mud-brick super- structure, although not for its height. Inside this enclosure, a large rectangular chamber tomb (5 m x 2m) was dug out and lined with mud-brick walls and sandstone orthostates. The tomb was accessed from the west by a dromos with a clay floor; this had a porch with at least two support bases at its west end. The porch bordered the pebble road, but is about 0.2m lower and probably accessed via a step. The tomb was looted, but multiple fragments of a Polychrome vase inside it, as well as a large Vapheio cup fragment found with looted human bones east of the tomb, testify to its use in EHI. The rooms outside the tomb and within the enclosure had earthen floors and appear to have been accessible during this phase, even though no artefacts were found (apart from a spindle- whorl). East of the tomb was a low rectangular platform of roughly squared stones, on top of which was a concentration of animal bone. East of the enclosure, building D possibly continued in use: smaller new walls were constructed and white plaster floors laid. In the third architectural phase (LHIIB to LHIIIA2E), the walls of the rectangular enclosure were enlarged to 1-1. 2m. They no longer had an interior face. Earthen floors of this phase are identified in most (but not all) rooms. No floor deposit has been recovered within the enclosure. The chamber tomb was now enlarged to 7m x 2m, and the dromos relaid (its clay floor now slopes up to the west, over the support bases of the previous phase, to join the resurfaced cobbled road 1). From this phase, four vases (three rounded alabastra and a piriform jar) must have been grave goods. In addition to a few items of gold and bronze jewellery, nine pieces of boar's-tusk helmet have been identified, indicating that at least one elite warrior was buried here. East of the enclosure wall, new walls were erected and floors laid: it is thus possible that the remainder of the complex continued to function as a living area. Some LHIIB pottery has been recovered here.</page><page sequence="93">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 93 Early in the Mycenaean Palatial period, widespread destruction at Mitrou was followed by a major decrease in building activity. The passage from the dromos to the chamber tomb was blocked in LHIIIA-B, and no burials were made after LHIIIA1. However, the dromos remained open, and road 1 was resurfaced eight times during LHIIIA. A narrow white plaster surface was laid at the edge of the road, near the dromos. In the vicinity of this surface, fragments of up to 10 clay figurines were identified (a high concentration in the context of the site as a whole). These roads were carefully constructed with pebbles and a cement-like surface layer, yet were little used. It is conjec- tured that road 1 was a ceremonial road not used by normal traffic. Road 1 was last resurfaced in LHIIIC, but the loose texture of this surface makes it likely that it was used even less than the earlier surfaces. Soon afterwards, a collapsed mass of large building stones, probably from building D, rendered it impassable for wheeled traffic. Later, in the LHIIIC phase, a rough gravel and cobble road was laid over these large stones, and the road was used again. This time it bordered building B and the contemporary LHIIIC buildings discussed in previous reports. Atalanti Property of K. and A. Vagia Ltd. M.-Ph.

Extending east from a long north-south wall, eight rooms belong to a Late Roman building which continues beyond the plot and five to a building of a later phase of the same period. These buildings were founded on the walls of seven rooms of a Hellenistic building which is partially preserved. Inside these Hellenistic rooms were two tile tombs containing child burials. In the destruction level and fills were Hellenistic architectural members, tiles, pieces of floor and water-pipe, and fragments of marble slabs. Portable finds include Hellenistic and Late Roman bronze coins, bronze and bone pins, terracotta figurines, iron and bronze objects, terracotta loom weights and fragments of glass vessels. A Herm was also recovered. S. Dimaki (14th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 445-46) the results of a series of rescue excavations. Pindarou Street (D. Tzintzira property).

Atalanti, Vagia property: general view. Temple and the subsequent provisional sanctuary. The adyton had three phases. Only the limestone foundation of the first phase survives - a TT-shaped structure open to the east, which forms part of the Late Geometric to Early Archaic South Temple and may have housed the oracle. In front of the open side, a monolithic limestone column (a cubic lower portion and an octagonally faceted upper part) must have supported a wooden column of similar shape (Fig. 99). Before the base was placed, a sacrificial fire was lit in its foundation pit, and votives (bronze pendants in the shapes of a ram [Fig. 100] and a bird) thrown into it. The base was then smoothed with an iron chisel, and the tool and a bird pendant placed beside it. 99. Kalapodi: column base from the Late Geometric to Early Archaic south temple.</page><page sequence="94">94 DOMINIQUE MULLIEZ 100. Kalapodi: bronze pendant in the form of a ram ( ca . 700 BC). When a provisional sanctuary was created after the destruction of the Late Geometric to Early Archaic South Temple, ensuring the continuity of the cult and oracle until the erection of a new temple, the 'adyton' was rebuilt in mud-brick on the old foundations as a small freestanding building, now with an east wall through which a door led to the interior. In the third phase, as the fill for the Archaic South Temple terrace was placed, the 'adyton' was kept open as long as possible, as indicated by the sloping layers of the fill. The Geometric South Temple, beneath the Late Geometric to Early Archaic temple for which it was demolished and ritually buried, has yielded numerous votives in recent years (Fig. 101). Further west is a deposit of weaponry, comprising 12 iron Naue type II swords (half of them with the tip to the west and half to the east), five iron spearheads, a bronze shield buckle, a large bronze pin and a charred wooden bow. These weapons were placed as a tropaion in front of the temple's north wall (Fig. 102), falling when the north wall collapsed. West of the South Temple, excavation explored the Classical bronze foundry and the Archaic surface outside the west front of the Archaic South Temple, with its second ramp. Initially, Hellenistic to Byzantine strata were reached. A Hellenistic limestone gravel surface contained into several circular pits, probably for storage pithoi. Three walls and the robbing pit of a fourth indicate a large Imperial Roman building. In Early Byzantine times, this area was robbed and partially rebuilt for residential and industrial purposes. To this phase belong the remains of a pottery kiln of fired brick and unfired mud-brick. Elateia, Sanctuary of Athena Kranaia. S. Dimaki reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 446-47) renewed excavation at the Sanctuary of Athena Kranaia (following the initial researches of Pierre Paris in the 19th century) - the most important city sanctuary of Elateia and the administrative centre of the koinon of the Phocidians. The peribolos around the sanctuary was cleaned, revealing the main entrance in the northwest. Trenches within the spoil from the early excavations produced a large quantity of pottery from LHII to modern, and exposed the retaining wall of the temple terrace inside the temenos. Further trenches between the opisthodomos and the peribolos exposed walls of rubble and mortar associated with a destruction layer of the second half of the fourth century AD. These walls rest in an older layer which contains rich material, the latest of which dates to 480 BC (i.e. before the Persian destruction of the sanctuary), as well as architectural terracottas and a Doric column shaft.

Dakoronia (formerly Director, 14th EPCA) describes the architectural remains of the Protogeometric settlement {AEThSE 2, 989-97). A building with three rooms lay beneath Roman and Early Byzantine buildings. The foundations are constructed of flat stones and the walls of mud-brick (noting pieces of clay found in the building debris). There is no evidence for the floors or the form of the roof. Pottery (both wheelmade and handmade) indicates that the building was occupied at the beginning of the Protogeometric period, perhaps as part of an organized settlement. Daphnousia. M. Vlachaki and V. Sythiakaki-Kritsimali (24th EBA) report {AEThSE 1, 1119-29) the results of rescue excavation conducted in 1995-1996 during the widening of the national road from Athens to Thessaloniki. A building with many large rooms was found west of the Early Christian basilica of Ag. Aikaterini and east of the public baths. Two main construction phases can be distinguished, the first at the end of the fourth or beginning of the fifth century, and the second in the mid sixth century AD. The building was abandoned at the end of the sixth or the beginning of the seventh century AD. The dimen- sions of this Early Byzantine construction with a triclinium , its proximity to the basilica and the number of coins and lamps decorated with the cross discovered in the fill indicate its dependency on the basilica, responding to the needs of the clergy and housing its administrative and economic activities. V. Sythiakaki-Kritsimali presents {AEThSE 1, 1131- 48) a study of the Ionic columns from the Early Christian basilica excavated by A. Orlandos in 1929. The Ionic capitals in white marble and the carved fanlights in a different marble belong to different construction phases and to a remodelling around AD 551/552. This type of capital does not appear in Greece in the fourth century, as maintained until now, but comes from Constantinople.

South of the south wall, a parallel wall closes a colonnade which runs along the entire south side (13.3m). A small cistern was found in the inside corner of this colonnade. Soundings inside the church revealed traces of at least two earlier churches. In the narthex were two pit graves with stone walls. One, destroyed by the construction of the church, contained scattered bone and a 12th-century coin. The other, covered by slabs, was found intact. The deceased had a small bronze and silver inscribed cross. These tombs appear contemporary with the first church, but are incorporated in the narthex of the third phase. Agios Dimitrios Kainourgiou. A Byzantine farm or rural installation, founded upon a Geometric cemetery, was discovered in the course of road widening at Thronio, 2km from Kammena Vourla. M.-Ph. Papakonstantinou and M. Sipsi report on the extensive Geometric cemetery ( AEThSE 2, 1029-42). Fifty tombs were organized into three groups, which surely correspond to tumuli or grave circles, noting the circular arrangement of the graves, the remains of stone mounds and a section of peribolos. The first group, beneath Byzantine remains, consists of 30 tombs: 25 cists (15 children and 10 adults), three pits and two cremations. The second group, at the level of the road-side verge, comprises six cist tombs with child burials, and the third group, in the area designated for the widened road, has six child graves (five cist tombs and a pit). Outside the third group is a further cist containing an adult burial and two pit cremations. The child burials are generally accom- panied by one or two vases, mostly one-handled cups and, in rarer cases, by a necklace or by one to three vases and bronze jewellery. Adult burials were richer, with one to four vases, bronze pins and other ornaments. The position of the ornaments in relation to the skeleton indicates that the deceased were buried clothed. The pottery indicates three phases of burial during a period of little more than a century (850-740/730 BC). A. Yalouri reports ( AEThSE 2, 1247-64) on the Byzantine rural installation. This complex covers some</page><page sequence="96">96 DOMINIQUE MULLIEZ 300m2, with rooms arranged in two wings and a large courtyard bounded by a stone wall. Two construction phases can be distinguished. To the first, Early Byzantine, phase belongs a tripartite rectangular building. During the second, in the 12th century AD, rooms were added to the north and west, and the court remodelled. In the west wing is a wine press - a crushing area with a built vat set below floor level. The floor in the press room slopes down (at an inclination of 1:10) towards an opening to allow the grape juice to run off into the vat (and the vat itself has channels to allow liquid to be drained off into containers). North and northwest of the press area is a series of rooms of uncertain function which must somehow be linked to wine production. The south wing of the complex has four rooms and a portico. One of the rooms contains two shallower vats which probably relate to a mass of lime found in the corner of the room. In another room, a millstone was found in situ : the raised edges of the surface indicate a first usage perhaps in a mobile press where it would have been used together with a receptacle. In the same room, two vats and a mass of lime in a slightly raised construction indicate a tannery (perhaps for the manufacture of wineskins to transport the wine). This type of built press is known elsewhere in the 11th to 13th centuries, especially in monastic complexes (e.g. on Mount Athos). Rengini. E. Phroussou (14th EPCA) reports (AEThSE 1, 641-56) that a rescue excavation for the construction of a railway line revealed an Early Neolithic settlement with a large quantity of pottery, flint and two round stone struc- tures of unknown function. Tithorea, Church of Agios Ioannis Theologos. A. Yalouri (7th EBA) reports the discovery during restoration work of three earlier phases at this church ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 540-42). The earliest phase consists of the apse and presby- terion of an Early Byzantine basilica. The apse was discovered in excavation outside the apse of the post- Byzantine church. The floor of the presbyterion had a mosaic (2.6m x 4.1m) in the west and marble paving elsewhere. The mosaic has a scheme of four rows of alter- nating squares and circles containing various motifs: four pit graves were cut into it (Fig. 103). The marble paving consists of re-used material from older structures and two inscribed stelae (decrees). The altar, on the paved floor, consists of an ancient marble stelae split into two and set on two low walls. The apse was not explored. Part of the barrier of the presbyterion was found, with cuttings for the setting of parapets and columns. The latest phase consists of a small one-aisled church which extends over the eastern part of the presbyterion and the apse. The western part of the church re-uses building material from the presbyterion. The north and south walls are almost parallel to the walls of the post-Byzantine church, while the west wall is at the level of its colonnade. The walls contain re-used material. To the west of the small church and over the mosaic floor is a destruction deposit containing material from the walls of the earlier basilica, and then six tombs (two cists and four pits). Three of the tombs contained child burials. The mosaic and the epithimata indicate a mid fifth- century date for the basilica, with repairs following the earthquake of 551. The small church dates to the Middle Byzantine period. 103. Tithorea, Church of Ag. Ioannis Theologos: south part of the floor mosaic. Lamia M.-Ph. Papakonstantinou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 431-36, 438) the results of rescue excavation at various locations within the city. Thermopylon Street (Lala property): part of the city fortification of the second half of the fourth century BC (the plot on the opposite side of the street has traces of the southeast gate). Diakou Street (Chormova-Kolkitsa property): Hellenistic and Byzantine remains. Two walls, on a foundation course and built of re-used blocks arranged as headers, form an angle. At the south end are two unfluted limestone columns. Inside the west wall, three rectangular cuttings, regularly spaced, are probably postholes. The associated pottery dates to the Hellenistic period, but the building's function cannot be determined. In the northeast of the plot, part of a Byzantine or post- Byzantine cist tomb was excavated: it contained a few bones and a very little pottery. Thermopylon Street (Polyzou property): six Hellenistic tombs, of which five are cist graves with limestone cover slabs and the sixth a terracotta larnax (Fig. 104). Some of the graves had been robbed. Grave goods include figurines, pottery, iron strigils, bronze pins and rings, a bronze pyxis and a mirror, bronze coins, plus a gold ring, necklace and coin. Corner of Leonidou and Patroklou Streets (Lamiakis Domikis property): two walls, one of which belongs to the foundation of a major Hellenistic building. Philolaou Street (Griva property): Classical pottery (especially tile), a pyramidal loomweight and a mass of iron. Karaiskaki Street (Politostathi property): the corner of a Hellenistic chamber tomb. Frantzi Street (Delli property): a north-south wall associated with Roman and Byzantine pottery and tile. Plateia Parkou: an east-west wall, roughly faced, associated with Hellenistic pottery, tile fragments and shell. Corner of Amalias and Zalongou Streets (Sokou property). P. Bougia (14th EPCA) reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 436-37) the discovery of 10 Hellenistic walls founded on Mycenaean (LHIIIC) fill. One wall (Tl), of fine isodomic construction, is associated with pottery of the late third to early second century BC and a hoard of coins of the Aetolian League (279-168 BC). The other rubble walls belong to a long building which was a storeroom and/or a weaver's shop (a number of loom weights were found).</page><page sequence="97">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 97 104. Lamia, Thermopylon Street, Polyzou property: tomb 1. Kalyvia, Tympanos (Papanagnou property). M.- Ph. Papakonstantinou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 437) the discovery of 13 tombs, of which two are tile graves and the remainder rectangular pits. Very few grave goods were recovered (just a little pottery in certain tombs). While the excavator does not indicate a date, the combination of a black-figure lekythos and black-glazed salt-cellar in tomb II implies a Classical (fifth-century) date for this tomb at least. Ano Ravenia. M.-Ph. Papakonstantinou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 438) the discovery of a tile grave with no grave goods. Tsaltaki Park. M.-Ph. Papakonstantinou reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 438) on discoveries made during work undertaken by the electricity company. At the corner of Dodonis and Papaphlessa Streets, a tile grave had Late Classical pottery in and around it (lekythoi, a kotyle and fragments of a figurine). A trench along Skoupha Street revealed a looted cist tomb covered with a limestone slab which contained a few Hellenistic sherds, tiles and a bronze strigil. The cover slab of a second grave was found 22m away, but the tomb itself continued under the pavement. A further tile grave containing two Hellenistic sherds was found at 15 Papaphlessa Street. West cemetery. A. Stamoudi (14th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 438-39) on tombs discovered in the course of laying water-pipes. At 17 Dolopon Street part of a lime mortar floor was discovered (report by M.Ph. Papakonstantinou). At 1 and 4 Argyrokastrou Street, three tombs were found. Tomb I (which lies partially under the pavement) is a rectangular rock-cut chamber tomb, with the entrance blocked by a hard limestone slab (Fig. 105). Entrance is via a passage with three steps (1.67m long) leading to an ante-chamber in which were found a figurine and four lamps. Inside, the tomb has a TT-shaped bench cut in the rock, and the walls were plastered. Skeletal remains (including crania) were scattered. Three lamps were collected, along with two unguentaria, the lid of an exaleiptron and numerous figurine fragments. In the centre was a 0.5m deep pit with three steps and plastered walls. This contained five lamps, an unguentarium, a bronze rod and bronze sheet, fragmentary iron objects, figurines, gold earrings, the bezel of a gold ring and other jewellery. The tomb was used at the end of the third century, during the second century BC and in the first century AD. Tomb II is a tile grave containing a plain ware vessel of the end of the second or early first century BC and the cranium of a child. Tomb III, immediately south of tomb II, is only partially preserved: a limestone slab survives, and a central pit (perhaps a sarcophagus) contained sherds and tiles, the head of an iron nail and an early first-century AD unguentarium. On Cheimaras Street, a chamber tomb was found, lying half under the street. The vault is partially collapsed: it is possible to identify a rectangular pit which contained bone and two Early Christian lamps. Mexiates, Koutsouraki. M.-Ph. Papakonstantinou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 450) the discovery of two chamber tombs, of which one was explored. Oriented east-west, this tomb has an oval rock-cut chamber with a vaulted ceiling and a dromos 4.8m long. The chamber was filled with soil and disturbed by looters: of the grave goods, only a bronze spearhead and a bronze object survive. The stomion was closed with a limestone slab. The second tomb, 3m to the northeast, was likely also looted. Amouri, Lianokladi. M.-Ph. Papakonstantinou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 449-50) on rescue excavation on the northern slopes of this known prehistoric settlement in the Sperchios valley, following the discovery during construction of Late Byzantine(?) settlement remains and probable tile graves. In addition to pottery, Byzantine activity is represented by one wall and the remains of tile graves with part of a cooking pot and a bronze coin. Most material from the upper level consists of sherds of glazed plates including sgraffito ware. Most of the pottery from the lowest levels 105.

The lower level contained the remains of three walls (two contemporary and one later), and a Middle Helladic tomb. On the northwest side of a drainage channel alongside the rural road which runs south-southeast of Amouri, within the archaeological zone, were four tombs (three tile graves and a pit) oriented northwest-southeast, which contained only a few sherds. No date is reported. On the banks of a small gorge 200m west-northwest of Amouri were four tombs (a cist, two tile graves and a rectangular pit) oriented east-west. A little pottery and tile is reported. Platystomo, Isiadia (Tsatali land). A. Stamoudi notes (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 454) the discovery of a cist tomb built of limestone blocks (two courses survive), which had recently been looted. Hellenistic sherds were collected. Archani. A. Stamoudi reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 454) the discovery of two tombs, during the widening of the road to Asvesti. The first is a tile grave containing one skeleton and a third-century BC lamp. The second is a cist grave built of tiles joined and then plastered over on the interior with mortar. The tomb contained two crania plus other bone, as well as pottery of the first to second century AD, three lamps of the second half of the second to the early third century AD, iron nails, fragments of a glass vessel and a bronze coin. Limogardi (Narthakion). P. Bougia reports (AEThSE 1, 927-44; ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 451-54) on excavation northwest of the hill of the city of Narthakion at the site of Zervo, Kastro. Twelve Hellenistic tombs date from the start of the third century BC to the end of the second. One group of double cists is surrounded by simple pits, tile graves and single cists, or underground chambers with couches arranged in a T7 form. Each double cist is topped by a tumulus ca. 4.5m in diameter and 2m high. Finds from the tombs include unguentaria, kantharoi, Macedonian-type amphorae and stamped Rhodian amphorae, lamps, pyxides, stone alabastra, bronze and silver coins, and bronze objects (such a strigils and a mirror), as well as terracotta figurines and gold leaves. Stylida. M.-Ph. Papakonstantinou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 447-48) that work on the city water supply revealed, at the corner of Kyprou and Lamias Streets, three cist tombs (of which one is partially destroyed and another may be Hellenistic in date), plus a tile grave containing a child burial. On Moustaka Street, the western part of a room defined by three walls was revealed, constructed from worked blocks. Achinos (municipal road, Armyrioti property). M.-Ph. Papakonstantinou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 440-44) the discovery to the west of Achinos of part of the Hellenistic cemetery of ancient Echinos (Fig. 106). Twenty four tombs were excavated (eight cists, 12 pits, two tile graves, a stone sarcophagus and a terracotta larnax), all oriented east-west. Rich grave goods include black-glazed pottery, lamps, unguentaria, bronze hooks and earrings, and figurines. Phteri. A.

M.-Ph. Papakonstantinou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 448-49; cf BCH 128-29 [2004- 2005], 1433) the extension of an excavation conducted in 1998 in order to expose the curved saddle of soil which extends from the TT-shaped building previously excavated. Ash and tile fragments are noted. The results of geophysical survey indicated inter alia six areas in which architectural remains are visible. Three trenches were opened north-northwest of the central trench. In the southern part of trench 1, a row of stones denoted a pit tomb containing an inhumation. Three further inhumations were excavated. North of these trenches was a stone mound set on a compacted brown soil containing a large quantity of carbon. Dismantling this structure revealed sherds, bones, flint blades and a fragment of loomweight. A three-legged terracotta table is also noted. Meleos Pelasgias. The Ephoreia of Maritime Antiquities has documented the remains of ancient tombs exposed by wave action on the west side of Pelasgia beach (Ministry of Culture and Tourism press release [06/06/10] cited in Ethnos [05/06/10]; Eleftheros Typos , Apogevmatini [07/06/10]; Rizospastis [08/06/10]). Koutroulou Magoula. N. Kyparissi-Apostolika (Director, EPSNE) reports (AEThSE 1, 607-17) on excavation at this Middle Neolithic magoula (5800-5300 BC), ca. 20ha in extent and 2km southeast of Neo Monastiri. Excavation in the west of the tell revealed the founda- tions of a well-built house. The walls must have been built of mud-brick and wood, and the roof, supported by stone and clay columns, was tiled (on the evidence of the destruction deposit). Beneath this level were storage vessels in situ. Tools (axes) and several millstones were also inside the house, and other finds include anthropo- 106.

Kyparissi-Apostolika reports (AEThSE 2, 839-52) on excavation at this Middle Neolithic settlement in 2002-2003. Three sectors were excavated: on the summit of the tell; a stratigraphical cut where the road in the west of the site was widened; and a trench on the edge of the site. These soundings revealed many floors as well as levels of crushed brick from the walls (at a time when the walls at Koutroulou Magoula were stone). Some of these bricks preserve traces of white and red coating. One room from a house built from clay has a square terracotta basin used for storage. Decorated pottery was plentiful and largely corre- sponds to that found at Koutroulou Magoula. Fragments of clay were also found, with or without the impressions of wattle and daub construction, as well as a number of terra- cotta figurines, bone and jewellery. Carbon samples taken from two trenches produced dates of the Middle Neolithic (5870-5720 BC, 5890-5730 BC and 5620-5470 BC), indicating continuing settlement though this period: further results are awaited. ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 99 THESSALY AND THE NORTHERN SPORADES By Dominique Mulliez THESSALY Nomos of Magnesia (13th EPCA: 7th EBA) Almyros Cholorema. A. Dina (then 7th EBA, now Director, 7th EBA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 534-35; cf. BCH 128- 29 [2004-2005], 1440) the continuation of rescue excavation for the widening of the motorway. A large quantity of Early Byzantine and Byzantine domestic pottery and glazed wares was recovered, as well as iron and bronze strips, iron nails, fragments of glass vessels, a steatite cross with incised decoration and a suspension hole, and coins (including one of Romanos II, AD 959-963). Halos, Agrielia. Z. Malakasioti (13th EPCA) reports ( AEThSE 1, 111-21) that the discovery of an iron Naue II sword at Agrielia (1km southeast of Halos) led to the excavation of a cemetery of pit cremations and cist tombs of various types organized within a tumulus, around chamber tombs. Grave goods comprise pottery, jewellery and dress ornaments, as well as tools, arms and sharpening tools. Many offering deposits were also excavated. The cemetery dates to LHIIIB2 and LHIIIC, and to the Protogeometric and Subgeometric periods (11th to eighth centuries BC). Halos, Voulokaliva. Z. Malakasioti reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 476-79) on excavation of a tumulus discovered north of Halos (Fig. 107). A total of 104 pit graves was excavated (these were surrounded by stones and contained cremations), plus four tholoi, 16 cist graves of children and four adult inhumations. The results of analysis of the alloys used in the weapons and jewellery from the pit graves are presented in a subsequent study (T. Rehren, E. Asderaki-Tsoumerkioti and Z. Malakasioti, AEThSE 2, 207-16). Certain iron phialae were covered in a tin-rich bronze (the earliest example of this technique in the Early Iron Age), and an unusually high level of copper in the original metal of certain iron objects raises questions of the provenance of the metal or the finished items (a Cypriot origin for the metal is proposed). In the northeast part of the tumulus are traces of a peribolos - a row of stones and, associated with it, small constructions of vertical and horizontal slabs identified as 107. Almyros, Halos, Voulokaliva: tumulus.</page><page sequence="100">100 DOMINIQUE MULLIEZ offering tables. There are 24 constructions of this type, some of which were found in cremation pits. Among finds from the tombs are metal weapons (swords, knives, spear- heads), personal ornaments (pins, fibulae, rings) and pottery of diverse shapes (small amphorae, skyphoi, oinochoae, jugs, cups, aryballoi) with Geometric decoration. The tumulus dates from the Protogeometric period (early 10th century) to the end of the seventh century BC. Halos. E. Nikolaou (13th EPCA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 479-80; AEThSE 1, 123-36; cf BCH 128-29 [2004-2005], 1438) on rescue excavation conducted for the widening of the national road. Work concentrated in the western and southwestern sectors. The junction between the circuit wall of the lower city and that of the upper was revealed, plus a monumental gate protected by two bastions (see H.R. Reinders, AEThSE 1, 137-44) (Fig. 108). The building discovered by the side of the paved court in 1999 was explored. This had two rooms, the east of which contained a rectangular hearth and, among portable finds, domestic pottery and bronze coins of 290 BC. A further building with three rooms was revealed towards the western part of the rampart, with a bronze coin of 369-338 BC. In the southern sector, inside the fortification, were two Geometric potter's kilns, 26.5m apart. The first is small and rectangular (2.1m x 1.8m), with an opening to the north-northwest. The walls were of clay and the firing chamber was divided into two with a brick partition. To the northwest is the kiln mouth with its brick-built passage. The second kiln was larger (3.65m x 2.7m) and the walls of the firing chamber were preserved to a height of 0.6m. The chamber was divided into four with three brick partitions. Numerous Geometric child burials were excavated in this sector. Demetrias Roman domestic complex. A. Batziou-Efstathiou (then 13th EPCA, now Director, 15 th EPCA) and P. Triantafyllopoullou (13th EPCA) report ( AEThSE 1, 193- 205) on a Roman (third-century) domestic complex (the discovery of which was reported in BCH 128-29 [2004- 2005], 1443). Excavation continued in 2002. The semi-subterranean space to the west of the court comprises semi-basement rooms accessed via three steps. Three rooms were excavated (a vestibule - a partially open area containing a well with a terracotta rim - and two rooms to the south used for food preparation and storage). In the first room, amphorae were found in situ , with smaller vases, noting in the middle a stone mortar and other vases. Two hearths of different types were found: on the first, to the southwest, was a lekanis and metal utensils and the second was found near the entrance. Amphorae were also found in the second room, as well as glass vessels and other vases, notably cups and oinochoae of different sizes. A third room, excavated in 2002, has the same equipment. This area showed traces of fire destruction. 108. Almyros, Halos: the walls and gate.</page><page sequence="101">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 101 The new excavation revealed that these three rooms were not simply storage areas, but also served as shops, mainly for the sale of wine and food. Batziou-Efstathiou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 465-66) on rescue excavation at two locations. Voulgari property. North of the Early Byzantine basilica A of Damokratia is a low hill with the remains of baths. Excavation here revealed the angle of two walls with exterior faces of worked blocks and the interior of rubble. The thickness of the west wall (1.6m) is due to niches within it. Traces of decorative surfaces were found, plus a room of the hypocaust to the south of the west wall. Ai'valiotika, Pefkakion Street (Sefel-Kounoupi property). Traces of a Late Roman house and part of the Hellenistic north rampart were found. Excavation continues on the neighbouring plot (Michalopoulou property). Ai'valiotika (Katsipha property). P. Triantaphyllopoulou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 466- 68) the discovery of a cult place, heated rooms from a bath and a courtyard with pits and a water channel. The krepis of the cult building is of stone and the elevation in brick. Traces of colour coating from the wall revetments were found. One of the rooms identified as a cult area contains a semicircular bench with traces of red mortar at the south end and black at the north. Three bases were also found, as well as numerous figurines of Demeter and Cybele. To the south, the heated area comprised two rooms with an entrance hall at the west of the courtyard of the bath. The walls were coated and the floors were of hydraulic mortar; in the southwest corner was a hearth and, in the southeast, a bath-tub connected to a round well by a water channel running across the court. These facilities were surely linked to the cult of the Phrygian deity Cybele, associated with purification rituals and known at Demetrias. The pottery dates to the third to second century BC, as do the coins, bronze objects and terracotta figurines (Fig. 109). An earlier phase was dated to the fourth century BC. Mikrothives V. Adrymi-Sismani (then Director, 13th EPCA, now Director, Archaeological Institute of Thessalian Studies) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 475-76; cf. BCH 128-29 [2004-2005], 1440) further excavation in the prehistoric settlement (transitional Final Neolithic to Bronze Age) in preparation for the widening of the motorway in this area. Two building complexes were revealed to the north of those explored in 1999. These are wattle and daub huts. Inside the west complex were rectangular clay construc- tions and, outside the building, in what is probably a partially roofed area, were two pithoi. In the east complex is another clay structure with pithos and other vessel sherds and tools, and, in another room, an oval clay construction with a terracotta spool-shaped object (Fig. 110). Numerous pieces of clay with wattle imprints were recovered, as well as abundant finds of tools of flint, obsidian, polished stone and bone, terracotta spindle- whorls and round weights, handmade domestic pottery and storage vessels. Epiplogrammi. A. Dina reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 537-39) the discovery of a potter's kiln and of large quantities of domestic and glazed pottery, as well as several metal objects, in the course of rescue excavation for the widening of the motorway. 109. Demetrias, Ai'valiotika: terracotta figurine of Cybele. The kiln is rectangular, built of clay and preserved to lm high (Fig. 111).

Mikrothives, Epiplogrammi: potter's kiln. floors and structures of uncertain function (one round structure with a tiled floor in room A and, in room l~, two constructions along the north wall). Finds comprise 140 bronze coins, including issues of Justinian I (AD 527- 565), earrings and a bronze ring, lead strips, glass vessels and Early Byzantine pottery. These remains are connected to the port of Nea Anchialos and the town fortification discovered nearby on Kasneti Street. Corner of Zarifi and Topali Streets (Tzaerli property). A brick-built Early Byzantine cist tomb with a tiled floor and two triangular openings in the north side was found. The tomb contained two disarticulated skeletons, a glass vessel, a pot and a gold coin. Excavation in the central square produced traces of what seem to be adjunct buildings in front of the basilica of Ag. Dimitrios. Finds comprise six walls of limestone blocks, the remains of two floors, one of which was of limestone slabs, an arch and a water channel, as well as marble architectural members. In the area of the airport of Nea Anchialos, remains of earthen walls, paved floors, pits containing Early Byzantine pottery and 15 pit tombs containing Christian burials provide additional information about the Early Byzantine settlement ( cfi BCH 117 [1993], 832). Southeast cemetery. S. Alexandrou (13th EPCA) and K. Almatzi report (AEThSE 2, 329-38; cf BCH 121 [2003], 885) the discovery of 153 Archaic to Roman tombs (including also four Middle Helladic graves) in rescue excavation between 2004-2006. While all tomb types are present, the majority are Classical and Hellenistic pit graves. From the 2004 excavation season are 25 cist graves, one tomb built of re- used inscribed stelae, 26 tile graves, 15 terracotta larnakes, 26 tombs built of field-stones, one brick-built tomb and 59 pit graves. The Middle Helladic tombs contained contracted inhumations, whereas inhumations of historical periods are extended. Often a dagger or spearhead was deposited outside the tomb; the presence of twisted iron nails is also noted. Burials of small babies (24 in total) were arranged beside or on the tomb of an adult. The pit graves contained rich goods. Finds include 450 vases, 10 glass vessels, two alabaster vases, two lead pyxides, 41 bronze coins, five gold pieces with the Macedonian star, bronze and iron jewellery, beads of bone, shell, terracotta and glass, and weights. The few terracotta figurines come from the graves of babies and children, and represent seated and standing figures and animals. Phthiotic Thebes (Nea Anchialos), Early Byzantine town near the Basilica of Martyrius A. Dina reports {AEThSE 2, 423-39) the discovery of remains of the Early Byzantine town in the coastal area close to this Early Byzantine basilica. Boliou property. Architectural remains and inhuma- tions of adults and children in 103 tile graves, two cist tombs with slab covers and 44 pointed amphorae used for burials were located. Finds comprise bronze coins, rings and clasps in bronze, a gold necklace, and glass beads and vessels, as well as abundant Early Byzantine pottery. Ziogka property. The eastwards continuation of the basilica was identified. Fourteen walls were excavated, plus three floors with limestone paving and a water channel. A large quantity of Early Byzantine pottery was recovered, plus lamps, glass vessels and four fourth- century AD bronze coins (including one of Constantine the Great). These remains belong to the first phase of construction of the basilica, in the fourth century AD. The floor mosaic in the narthex of the Basilica of Martyrius was restored and lifted. Iltsopoulou property. Remains of a bath with a hypocaust were found, ca. 60m from the basilica. The frigidarium had a floor mosaic with geometric motifs. The complex was built in the Roman period, but there is evidence of later restoration and reorganization. Papoutsi and Evangelaki property. Two rooms from a thermal bath were located, one at the west with an apse and the other to the east, occupied by a large cistern. Following the abandonment of the building, the space was transformed into a cemetery: 39 tile graves, three cists with cover slabs and two funerary urns were excavated. Finds include a bronze ring, bronze earrings and beads from a necklace, fragments of glass vessels, lamps and much Early Byzantine pottery. Tsiami property. A warehouse complex (18m long, 15.5m wide) with seven rooms arranged on either side of a central wall and constructed in rubble and earth was found. No floors are preserved, merely part of the levelling course for a floor in hydraulic mortar. Near to the northwest corner were a well and two round refuse pits with masonry walls, containing much Early Byzantine pottery, fragments of glass and a coin of Justinian I. Two tile graves were inserted after its abandonment. Bina property. Two of the three rooms of the facade of a luxurious villa with a peristyle court (the central room with a mosaic floor and the south room with a tiled floor) were located. Several column bases were found, as well as seven fragments of unfluted column shaft, three Ionic capitals and</page><page sequence="103">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 103 seven fanlights decorated on both faces. A water channel running from the fagade to the sea, passing throught the sea defence wall, was revealed for a distance of 12.8m. The construction technique and architectural ornament indicate that the villa dates to the sixth century AD. Papoutsi and Peka property. The remains of an Early Byzantine public building were identified. These consist of two parallel colonnades which communicate via arches carried on rows of columns and pillars. The facade is TT-shaped: two side rooms frame the colonnade. The north room has a tiled floor. East of the building was a near-square tower with strong walls, which is independent of the circuit wall and may be a lighthouse (and thus connected with the town's harbour zone). Finds include bronze coins of Justinian I, Early Byzantine pottery, lamps and glass vessels, as well as Early Byzantine architectural members. Sesklo. V. Adrymi-Sismani reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 468-70, 489-92) on excavation and restoration in the Neolithic settlement on the southeastern and northern slopes of the acropolis. The oldest remains are found on the southeastern slopes (Fig. 112). Four phases are identified, above a compact layer of earth and small stones. 112. Sesklo: Neolithic settlement. The first, Early Neolithic, phase is revealed by masses of clay, several traces of a clay floor, evidence of fire, animal bones, sea shells and pottery. In the second phase, walls define at least four spaces, . three of which can be identified as houses. The fill contains masses of clay and fragments of mud-brick. Pottery dates to the Middle Neolithic. The third phase includes the remains of three houses with successive floors indicating continuous occupation. There are remains of a hearth and a layer of mud-brick from a collapsed wall. The fourth phase corre- sponds to that of the Late Neolithic megaron. Dimini. V. Adrymi-Sismani reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 470-73; cf. BCH 128-29 [2004-2005], 1445) on geophysical prospection in unexcavated areas of the Mycenaean settlement and on continued excavation in the area of megara A and B begun in 1997 (Fig. 113). One wing, parallel to megaron A and towards the south, consisted of two rooms, A and B, of which B is a metalworker's shop (containing a bench with pots, a lead vessel and bronze waste). Other smaller rooms to the west of megaron A were storerooms (e.g. room 14), as were certain rooms to the north (containing pithoi in situ and plentiful LHIIIB2 to LHIIIC domestic pottery). Room 10, southeast of megaron A, is interpreted as a waiting room, with two T-shaped benches along the walls: in a later phase an entrance was opened to the court (area 7). To the west of room 10, room 1 opens onto a corridor (area 2) with a clay floor on which a LHIIIB2 stone tripod vase is preserved. Room 9, south of megaron A, is connected to rooms 18 and 19: together they form a workshop. Room 9 has a floor of lime mortar and contained LHIIIB2 and LHIIIC pottery as well as an offering table in lime mortar, and a pestle and mortar. Megaron A was destroyed at the end of the 13th century, resulting in the fall of wall-plaster (found in certain rooms not re-used thereafter). The building was abandoned piecemeal: only the large rooms 6 and 8 and the courtyard were used during the last phase of occupation. The pottery indicates that the megaron was reoccupied very quickly after the destruction, but for a short period of time. Megaron B developed in parallel with megaron A and was destroyed by fire at the same time. Excavation in the central area revealed walls of fired mud-brick plastered with clay, on a stone socle. The strength of the walls indicates the existence of an upper storey. On the floor of room 3 was a partially melted lead vase and olive, pine and oak roof timbers. V. Adrymi-Sismani reports ( AEThSE 1, 85-110) on the study of pottery from rescue excavations between 1977-1997 which more precisely defines phases of occupation and rebuilding in the settlement around megara A and B. In particular, study of the grey pseudo-Minyan and handmade burnished ware confirms that settlement continued after the destructions in LHIIIB2. Soros. A. Batziou-Efstathiou (then 13th EPCA, now Director, 15th EPCA) and P. Triantaphyllopoulou report (AEThSE 2, 257-67) on the 2005 campaign at Soros, southwest of Volos. The known remains, notably the fortification circuit were cleaned and surveyed. Trenches were opened to the east of the central gate and along the road to the acropolis (a road delimited by low curved walls). A little Classical domestic pottery and some flneware was recovered, a picture which coincides with the results of the preliminary study of pottery from the Sanctuary of Apollo (see G. Vitos and M. Panagou, AEThSE 2, 309-28). Rescue excavation in the town cemeteries has revealed cist tombs of schist slabs, containing one or two inhumations. Grave goods (including pottery, jewellery, gilded terracotta tokens, bone objects, gilded pins and two figurines, one of which is a Tanagra type) coincide with the final phase of occupation of the site, i.e. the beginning of the third century BC.

I. Leventi (Thessaly) presents (AEThSE 2, 295-308) a study of a votive relief and three statues of youths discovered in 1973 (Milojcic excavations), and of an inscribed base for similar statutes dedicated to Apollo by the fathers of the young men, which confirms the identity of the deity to whom the temple was dedicated.</page><page sequence="104">104 DOMINIQUE MULLIEZ 113.

The caldarium consists of three rooms with hypocausts (the columns are preserved in one room) and two rooms with baths (one rectangular room and one with an apse to the west) the walls of which have marble revetment. To the north is a vestibule with a tiled floor. Other walls defining three rooms, and marble column bases, also belong to the complex. Large quantities of pottery were recovered and 15 bronze coins.

A significant quantity of Early Byzantine and Byzantine pottery was recovered. Agioi Anargyroi (Doublioti property). A. Batziou- Efstathiou reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 463-64) excavation in the cemetery of Iolkos, where hundreds of cist and chamber tombs of the Geometric to Classical period have already been revealed. Twenty seven tombs were dug, of which 20 contained no grave goods. Those with goods were mostly Geometric or Classical cists of schist or grey marble slabs, containing pottery, lamps, unguentaria, iron pins and gilded beads. Kazanaki. V. Adrymi-Sismani and S. Alexandrou (13th EPCA) report ( AEThSE 2, 133-50) the discovery of Mycenaean and Roman tombs during the construction of the ring road north of Volos. An intact Mycenaean tholos tomb was excavated, plus nine further pit graves of which six are Mycenaean and three Roman. The dromos was revealed for a length of 8m, but continues into the next field. Excavation of the tomb itself was conducted via the relieving triangle since the heavy masonry closing the door was left in place. Two burials were found on the base of the triangle: the skeletons (complete but disarticulated) of a woman and a child were accompanied by an agate sealstone and a pithos, and by a tripod vessel respectively. Excavation inside the chamber revealed a thick layer of ash, carbonized material and burnt bone, and four pit graves dug into the floor. The central and largest grave, in front of the entrance, was empty; the others, around it, were sealed. One of the cover slabs had a relief hunting scene on the lower surface, dating to the late 15th to early 14th century BC. Fill from the chamber contained ash, burnt bone (plus some unburnt) and burnt objects, including 42 vases, fragments of jewellery in gold (over 1,000 scattered beads and a ring), faience and glass paste, pieces of ivory and gilded nails, plaques in gold or glass paste representing a bearded male, seals of amethyst, agate and rock crystal, as well as numerous pieces of decorated sheet gold perhaps from funerary clothing. The seven individuals buried were placed, dressed and adorned, on decorated wooden biers, and then on the pyre after a certain level of decomposition had taken place (a form of secondary burial ritual). The products of this cremation were placed in the pit graves, in the secondary pits, and finally dispersed over the floor of the tholos. Analysis of the gold jewellery and dress ornaments provides information about manufacturing processes (cold working, using a matrix), but few details with which to define the origin of the metal (M. Filomena Guerra, S. Rohrs, J. Salomon, R Walter and V. Adrymi-Sismani, AEThSE 2, 681-94). A study of the human remains is published by A. Papathanasiou ( AEThSE2 , 151-62). Lake Karla (ancient Voiveis). V. Adrymi-Sismani and A. Dina report {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, , 473-74, 539; AEThSE 1, 371-87) discoveries made in 2000 and 2001 during the development of this 420ha reservoir in the southeast of the Thessalian plain. Part of a Hellenistic and Roman main water channel, 0.6m wide and built in stone, forms part of a network. Trenches opened in advance of digging for reservoir 7 revealed three walls, one of which is preserved to 1.8m high. Between walls 1 and 2 were two pit graves which contained no offerings. Excavation of the reservoir produced Early Byzantine, Byzantine and Late Byzantine pottery. At Aerani (reservoir 6), excavation in five sectors in 2001 revealed two round potter's kilns next to each other, six built features, eight stone mounds, a refuse deposit and 35 tombs (mostly cists with some tile graves). Material from the kilns and tombs is Early Byzantine in date. Near to the Byzantine Church of Agios Nikolaos Kanalion, excavation revealed 67 intact tombs, mostly cists. The form of the burials and their east-west orien- tation indicates that they are of Christian date. Most offerings come from female burials and consist of jewellery - rings, bracelets and earrings - mostly of bronze and very occasionally of iron. Excavation at Palioskala (reservoir 3) revealed the foundations of two Byzantine buildings, which are probably stores for agricultural produce. Palioskala (reservoir 3). G. Touphexis (15th EPCA) reports {AEThSE 1, 55-70) on excavation conducted in 2001-2002. Palioskala lies on the east bank of Lake Karla, at the foot of the hill of Mavrovouni. Excavation covered 3.5ha of this prehistoric magoula. The Late Neolithic settlement is organized on the basis of a system of rubble and earth periboloi. The exterior circuit wall, which inclines slightly inwards, was revealed to a length of 45m, the preserved height being at least 2.3m. Some 3.5m further in is a second circuit wall; there is evidence of construction between the two walls at certain points where the separation between them is significant. This second circuit wall has a wide gateway which was later blocked by a further peribolos wall. Inside, several houses were built in the large area between this circuit and the core of the settlement (itself surrounded by a peribolos). A house with a hearth, a clay floor and a rectangular structure (2.2m x 1.75m x 0.3m) lined with clay was probably for storage. To the northeast of this house, a group of buildings belong to one or two houses with floors of yellow clay and gravel and a round hearth on the floor (plus others to the north of the complex). A room (5m x 6m) which forms part of a larger building, with broken storage vessels on the floor, was located. To the north of these buildings was a large round construction (2.2m diameter) with a clay floor (1.25m in diameter) surrounded by two parallel walls and probably covered by a vault: this is probably part of a kiln. Immediately to the north was a large rectangular house with rubble walls. Inside are traces of floors, three hearths and two storage vessels. Several phases of occupation and reorganization can be traced.</page><page sequence="106">106 DOMINIQUE MULLIEZ At least two of the peribolos walls surrounding the nucleus of the settlement have been identified: these are rubble constructions which also incline inwards. In the centre of the settlement is a further rubble construction (8.4m x 10.2m). South of this central structure and between the two central periboloi are three adjoining rooms belonging to a building complex developed in the heart of the settlement. A detailed study of this structure is published by G. Touphexis {AEThSE 2, 85-99). Fill in the structure produced terracotta animal figurines as well as 22 small finds - anthropomorphic figurines (two terracotta and one marble), flint and obsidian tools, a polished stone object, two terracotta spindle-whorls, millstones, etc. - including items which attest to the processing and storage of grain. Three terracottas, found in a triangular arrangement on the floor of the central room, depicted highly schematized horned animals. Their function remains uncertain. The building was destroyed by fire and succeeded by another on a different orientation. Above the periboloi and the central structures is a large building (22m x 8.3m, oriented northwest- southeast), preserved to foundation level, which dates to late antiquity. Other structures were partially excavated - clay hearths, earthen floors and walls. TTiree tombs contem- porary with the settlement were found on the south slope, plus five more of historical times. In addition to large quantities of pottery, finds include terracotta and marble figurines, shells, stone tools (mainly in flint), arrowheads, axes (including one in bronze), sharpening tools, millstones and bone weaving tools. Thermokipia, Mavrovouni. Subsequent press coverage (Ethnos [01/08/09]; Naftemboriki [17/06/09]) cites reports by V. Adrymi-Sismani of the discovery of earlier, Early and Middle Neolithic, settlement at Thermokipia, Mavrovouni, with a single-roomed house surrounded by a peribolos. A second site on the east bank of the lake shows evidence of Neolithic to Hellenistic occupation. Geomorphology. Lake Karla was drained in 1962 to resolve a number of problems related to flooding and public health. The results of a study of the geomorphology of this part of the lake, conducted in 2003, are presented by I. Vlastaridis ( AEThSE 1, 45-54). Koryphoula, Karla. V. Adrymi-Sismani reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 474-75) that the opening of a quarry 11km from Kanalia revealed three Late Helladic tholos tombs (tombs 1, 3 and 4) sunk into transitional Final Neolithic to Early Helladic levels, all under the poorly-preserved remains of a Hellenistic settlement. Tholos tomb 1 (oriented southeast-northwest) shows the same characteristics as other tombs discovered in the area, but is smaller (2.04m high, 2.6m interior diameter). The dromos was destroyed by the mechanical digger. The tomb was covered by a tumulus formed from Final Neolithic to Bronze Age debris. The chamber contained 11 skeletons laid on the floor. The abundant grave offerings date to LHIIIB (Psi figurines, spindle-whorls, shells, stone beads, pottery). Two pits to the the north and south of the entrance contained disarticulated bones: of seven individuals in the first ditch, with a stone necklace, earrings and bracelets in bronze, and sealstones; and of three individuals accompanied by Phi figurines in the second. 114. Koryphoula, Karla: tholos tomb 3. Tholos tomb 3 lies northeast of tomb I on the same orientation (1.7m high, 2.1m interior diameter). Six skeletons lay on the floor: no ossuaries were found. The grave goods date to LHIIIB 1 (Fig. 114). Tholos tomb 4, to the west of the others, is smaller (1.08m high, 1.4m interior diameter). The skeletons of 20 individuals were placed on the floor, with very few grave goods. Between Velestino and Kanalia, a rectangular Hellenistic building was discovered during the construction of reservoir 4. Closer to the hill of Koryphoula, traces of Neolithic occupation consist only of pottery. NORTHERN SPORADES Skiathos Kephala (ancient Palaiskiathos). A. Mazarakis-Ainian (Thessaly) and A. Doulgeri-Intzesiloglou (then Director, Archaeological Institute of Thessalian Studies, now Director, 13th EPCA) report on the 2009 campaign of survey and cleaning. Topographical plans were made of the site and especially the fortification and its fagade after the cleaning of certain sectors. The retaining wall on the south and outside the circuit was investigated, as well as a round building on the north of the plateau. Surface pottery was collected on the site of Kephala and in the wider area. The area between Kephala and Korakopholia was explored to locate the cemetery of the settlement: the remains of an agricultural facility, perhaps a Classical to Hellenistic farmstead, were found on the southeastern slopes. Several Hellenistic and Roman items were recovered to the northwest of the airport. http://extras.ha.uth.gr/skiathos/gr/index.asp Skopelos A.

Deriziotis (Ephor Emeritus of Byzantine Antiquities) reports ( ADelt55 [2000] Chr, 527- 28) research into two monuments - an Early Byzantine basilica (excavated in 1999 and 2000) and a bath. The three-aisled basilica, with a projecting apse and a narthex, had two projecting rooms to the north and south. The narthex communicated with the naos via a central doorway and with two rooms to the north and south via two bays. The walls, preserved to 1.5m high, are of roughly-worked blocks with lime mortar, but the floors are not preserved. Finds include many marble architectural elements (fragments of columns, Ionic columns, fanlights, and double colonnettes), fragments of painted wall decoration, tiles and pottery. The bath has three niches to the south, east and west (a modern building cuts the north side). The walls, preserved to a low height, are coated in hydraulic mortar. Finds include much pottery and tile, as well as fragments of hypocaust channel. Nomos of Larisa (15th EPCA: 7th EBA) See AGOnline for new accessions in the Larisa Museum. Kallithea. S. Karapanou (15th EPCA) and M. Haagsma (Canadian Institute in Greece/Alberta) report on the fifth season of excavation. Further research on the Hellenistic building 10, in the east of the town, revealed an east entrance from an alley running from avenue B to the south. The entrance is narrow (0.88-0.9m): no threshold has been found. Unit E in its earlier phase was a peristyle with an impluvium connected to a drain running north-south (Fig. 115), which in turn reached unit D (room 5) via a hole in the wall between units D and E. Unit D is paved with water-resistant cement which may indicate that it was used as a bathing area at some stage. In a second phase, a north- south wall divided the original open area of unit E. Few of the numerous roof tile fragments found in the building were stamped: two bore the names of Pheidon (unit C) and Theagenes (unit A). A hearth in unit C (room 6) (Fig. 116) had in its northeast corner a complete pyxis-like, lidless pot, with plastic snake decoration, supported by roof tile pieces. The pot was filled with ash and burnt bone, and may be evidence for domestic cult, probably a dedication to Zeus Ktesios. A second-century BC bronze finger ring with a cornelian intaglio depicting an incised jackal, was also found. Survey was undertaken in the southwest section, the south diateichisma , the east city gate (gate I) and the west city gate (gate II). In the southwest section, the fortifi- cation wall acted as a barrier to the erosion of material down-slope. Around gate II, there was little material, apart from a concentration just inside the gate to the north. Almost no material related to a large structure ca. 60m northwest of the gate. This may reflect poor visibility, but it may also suggest variation in post-depositional movement. The low concentration of material in the area of gate I, especially inside the fortification wall, was in marked contrast to high sherd counts (300-600 in comparison to 60) recorded ca. 40m west of the gate and enceinte in previous survey. 115.

House A had three rooms, one of which had a paved floor. Only one room of house B was partially excavated; the exposed area of floor was of sand and gravel. North of house B, were two rooms from two further houses. These buildings were preserved to foundation level: the superstructure, of brick, did not survive.</page><page sequence="108">108 DOMINIQUE MULLIEZ Corner of Plastira and Keleustou Mavrogeorgiou Streets (Zioga property). A Hellenistic house was revealed, preserving one room, part of two more and part of the courtyard. The walls are of local hard limestone. The floor of the room excavated is of beaten earth with gravel and pebbles, while the other floors are of beaten earth. In the northern part of the plot were 12 post- Byzantine inhumations without grave goods. West cemetery (Iakovaki property). Excavation on this plot at Thomaidi, at the western edge of the village, revealed 11 Hellenistic tombs of which three were partially destroyed. All but one were rock-cut pits. Six tile graves are reported, one covered with pithos fragments, two terracotta larnakes, a pit grave and one simple inhumation without goods, but where the skeleton was bound at the ankles with iron shackles (Fig. 117). 117. Pharsala, west cemetery: tomb 5. Zotou and Tzanaka property. In the context of a discussion of a coin hoard, S. Katakouta (15th EPCA) presents ( Kepuaria OiXias vol. 1, 159-75) a Classical house excavated in 1990. While ancient levels were disturbed by post-Byzantine tombs, several construction phases are identified. A building with three rooms beongs to the latest (fourth- century to Hellenistic) phase: two of these rooms have gravel floors and the third a floor of sand and lime. Beneath the foundations of this building lies a fifth- century house with four rooms and a courtyard accessed via the smallest of the rooms to the north. This room served as a strong room, in which was found a black- glazed skyphos and, beneath it, several fragments of gold jewellery (myrtle flowers) and eight silver coins (three Aeginetan staters of the last quarter of the sixth to the early fifth century BC and five hemidrachms of Pharsalos, struck ca. 440-425 BC). The room also contained much pottery and eight pyramidal loomweights, one of which has inscribed letters and another the name AYZMENTA. The letter forms indicate a fifth-century date. The imported pottery (Attic, Ionian and some Corinthian) dates to the second quarter of the fifth century (the local wares cannot be precisely dated. The coin hoard will thus have been buried after 425 BC. Kalamaki. M. Vaiopoulou (34th EPCA) reports ( AEThSE 1, 207-19) on excavation of a Hellenistic (second-century BC) settlement and Roman cemetery on the banks of Lake Karla (ancient Voiveis). Thirty tombs (oriented northwest-southeast) were excavated - nine cist graves with schist cover slabs, 12 cist tombs covered with tiles or rubble and nine tile graves - plus two ossuaries. The skeletons are generally supine, head to the south and arms by the side. Most tombs were re-used for several burials, with earlier burials pushed to the side. Remains of the Hellenistic structures were used in the tomb construction. The sandy soil mixed with the gravel found in most tombs suggests that the cemetery was destroyed by a sudden inundation from Lake Karla. The pottery from the tombs cannot be closely dated, but coins suggest that the cemetery was used from the third to the mid fourth century AD. Evidence from this site also contributes to the wider study of the geomorphology of the lake: a first inundation probably damaged the settlement in the Hellenistic period and a second is attested in the destruction of the tombs. Larisa Phrourio. L. Deriziotis (Ephor Emeritus of Byzantine Antiquities) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 523-25; cf. BCH 128-29 [2004-2005], 1454) on rescue excavation east of the Early Byzantine basilica of Ag. Achilleios and of the Bezesteni, west of Xanthou Street and south of Georgiadou Street. Sector B produced three walls associated with Middle and Late Byzantine pottery. In sector T is a small three- apsed bath preserving plunge baths with walls of hydraulic mortar (Fig. 118). A praefurnium (room I) lies south of room II. Rooms II and III contain hypocausts: the complex is dated to the fifth to sixth century AD. A further building (K2), of which three walls are preserved, has Middle to Late Byzantine pottery. In the northeast of the plot is a Byzantine church built in the ruins of an Early Byzantine basilica (Fig. 119). The single-roomed building, with an east apse, has a portico to the north and niches in the south. The remains of a floor were found at the level of the niches. Inside and outside the church were cist and tile tombs (and one vaulted tomb) 118. Larisa, phrourio: Byzantine bath.</page><page sequence="109">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 109 119. Larisa, phrourio: Byzantine basilica and church. established when the church was abandoned. Tombs in the south were arranged on a mosaic floor of the Early Byzantine basilica which preceded the church. Finds (jewellery and coins) date between the Comnenan era (Middle Byzantine) and the Late Byzantine period. The tombs were re-used on several occasions. An Ottoman potter's kiln lay in the area of the diakonikon. In the southeast, eight walls define three rooms of building K5. In one room were marble architectural elements (capitals, fanlights, column bases), a pithos and Early Byzantine coins. New market square. S. Sdrolia (7th EBA) reports ( AEThSE 2, 441-55) the discovery of a Late Roman settlement quarter, a bath complex and part of the Early Byzantine fortification in rescue excavation for the construction of an underground car park. The remains of at least two houses were revealed on either side of a 3.5m wide street. The better-preserved west house has rectangular rooms arranged around a courtyard with a well. The remains are generally preserved to foundation level, but a small area of floor was found in one room, associated with a threshold, fragments of wall-painting with a plant motif and fragments of marble veneer. Domestic pottery of the third to fourth century AD, sigillata and figurine fragments were found. The east house shows the same features. A water conduit, into which two further channels flow, links the east and west houses and continues to the south. The quarter was destroyed by fire at the end of the fourth century AD, as confirmed by the coins in the destruction deposit in the west house. Some rooms show signs of repair in the fifth century, when the main city basilica was also built (this lies to the west of the plot, but part of the buttressed apse was discovered in the course of excavation). In the north of the plot was a bath complex of three rooms. The long west room, sub-divided into three with brick partitions, may be the hypocausts of the caldarium. The apsidal north room would be the tepidarium and the third room, the frigidarium. The only evidence to date this building is its stratigraphical position, which places it in the fifth century AD. Its scale suggests that it was the bath for this quarter or that it was related to an ecclesiastical complex. The Early Byzantine fortification was built after the destruction of the Roman quarter. It is a strong construction, 2.2-2.4m in diameter, of rubble to a certain height and masonry above. A rectangular tower is joined to the circuit wall. Fifteen metres to the east is a lm deep proteichisma and a rectangular tower. Atrax, marble quarries. I. Lazzarini and S. Cancelliere (Venice) present ( ASMOSIA VII [BCH Supplement 51] [2003], 495-508) a study of the diffusion across the Mediterranean of marmor thessalicum (or lapis atracius) during the Imperial period, on the basis of samples from the quarries at Chasabali, ca. 10km from Larisa. The archaeometric problem presented is the similarity of the Thessalian marble to that from Tinos (from the Marias quarries). Milea, Agia Triada. L. Deriziotis reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 526-27; AEThSE 1, 392-93; cf BCH 128-29 [2004-2005], 1455) on work concentrated in the south, west and north of the Early Byzantine basilica A, and on the narthex and the structures in front of it. A group of rooms west of the basilica communicate with each other and with the narthex. Removal of the destruction deposit revealed the photisterion , with an entrance oriented towards the baptistry, and another building. The narthex floor was not preserved, but coins from the narthex date to the period from Constantine II (AD 337-361) to Zenon (AD 474-491). The cemetery within the ruins of the basilica and the Middle Byzantine church have produced much bronze jewellery and 1,039 Middle Byzantine coins. Mandra, Prophitis Ilias. G. Touphexis (15th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 503-505) on excavation in the Neolithic settlement on the hill of Prophitis Ilias, northeast of Mandra, in preparation for road widening. Five Late Neolithic occupation phases are identified (with C14 dates of 4940-4550 BC). In the oldest, a ditch containing pottery of Dimini IIIA type defined the settlement. In the second phase, this ditch was filled. During the third phase, the settlement extended beyond the line of the first ditch and was defined by two new ditches, B and l~. The architectural remains are very poorly preserved, but numerous pits were discovered as well as inhumations in or close to them. Painted pottery - black- on-red or brown-on-a-light-ground - is associated with this phase. In phase IV, ditches B and T were filled, and further constructions built. Two burials in ditch B and a third in the open interior of the settlement next to a large storage (and later refuse) pit are the subject of a separate study by G. Touphexis, S. Manolis, G. Phountoulakis and E. Petroutsa (AEThSE 2, 101-12). The first burial is the inhumation of a man 30-35 years of age in contracted position, and the second that of a woman over 35 years of age, missing the arm and leg bones. In a cavity dug into the wall of the ditch were two collections of bone separated by a limestone block: the upper consists of a cranium, a few disarticulated bones and a few sherds, and the second of long-bones (possibly those missing from tomb 2). The third burial was a supine inhumation with the legs tightly bent and the head turned down to the floor During the final phase (V), the settlement was surrounded by a circuit wall on a foundation of small to medium-sized stones. Inside the settlement, architectural remains include a building in the form of a megaron.</page><page sequence="110">110 DOMINIQUE MULLIEZ 120. Mandra: Late Neolithic stone figurines.

Pythio Elassonas. M. Vlachaki (7th EBA) presents (AEThSE 2, 489-504) an analysis of a hoard of 156 coins acquired by the 7th EBA, which consists of 156 aspron trachy dating from the second quarter of the 12th century to the first quarter of the 13th century. Azoros, Agios Athanasios. L. Deriziotis reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 525-26; L. Deriziotis and S. Kougioumtzoglou, AEThSE 1, 390) the discovery of a three-aisled basilica and a cemetery of 25 cist tombs (20 of which were child burials in the south aisle). The church floor is preserved in certain places; in the west and south it is paved in marble, while in the centre of the sanctuary hydraulic cement may have served as a base for a mosaic. Two building phases can be distinguished: in the first the church had a single aisle and, in the second, aisles were added to the north and south, as well as a round construction to the northwest, termed a 'phiale', which is identical to that at Palioklissi. Kastri Livadiou Early Byzantine basilica. L. Deriziotis and S. Kougioumtzoglou report {AEThSE 1, 393-96; AEThSE 2, 475-87) on two seasons of excavation at an Early Byzantine basilica, in 2002 and 2003. In 2002, the main, three-aisled, basilica, with a wooden roof and a semicircular apse, was discovered. Older marble elements were re-used, notably blocks and the pediments of stelae, including some with inscriptions: the excavators associate this material with the Roman city of Doliche. The ambo, on the south side of the central aisle, is of the type with double stair dated to the fifth to sixth century AD. The narthex was revealed along the entire length of the building. A cist tomb at the east end of the south aisle contained a skeleton missing the cranium. The building had two phases: the first is dated to the end of the fifth century AD by coin evidence and the second, a remodelling with the addition of the ambo and the enclosure of the bema, is dated by a coin of Justinian discovered on the mosaic floor. The church was abandoned after earthquake destruction. Excavation in 2003 revealed a further three-aisled basilica with a narthex and a semicircular apse. To the west the narthex opened into a court associated with several annexe rooms (some of which date the construction of the basilica). A later small cist tomb was found in the first of these rooms, built from re-used slabs. Coins from a destruction deposit date the final phase of use of the basilica after the second half of the sixth century AD. Fortification. L. Deriziotis reports ( AEThSE 2, 475- 87) research on the ramparts around Kastri, which defend an area of 1,300m2. At the southeast end is a square tower with strong walls (1.3m deep) of worked blocks in the lower part and rubble above. The tower had a north entrance and a staircase with two steps descending to a basement. In the fill of the tower and the destruction deposit was an ancient grave stele, a fragment of hypocaust channel, an iron spearhead, pottery and animal bone, as well as three inscribed bone plaques (third- century AD), a lead weight and a coin of Justinian. Excavation in the southeast revealed a complex of seven rooms with at least two building phases. The rooms, which had basements, served as stores: numerous pithoi were found in situ. There was also an underground water channel and, in room D, a concentration of objects related to textile manufacture. In the centre of this room was a small cist tomb (0.6m long) containing the bones of a young baby. Gonnoi. Eight Hellenistic tombs were exposed when heavy rains washed away part of a farm track in late January to early February 2010. Only one was preserved (without goods) and the others were destroyed by the flood. The tombs likely belong to the known cemetery of the city of Gonnoi. A late fourth to early third-century date is proposed ( Apogevmatini , Expres [05/02/10]). Tempi (Maliakos-Kleidi). S. Sdrolia reports (Apogevmatini, Expres [17/11/09], Ethnos [13/05/10], Adesmevtos Typos [31/05/10]) the discovery of an Early Byzantine building, perhaps an inn, during excavation in preparation for road construction. A marble quarry used during the third to fourth century AD was also found. In the upper part of the settlement, five cist graves are likely part of a cemetery. A large sixth-century AD building is likely a wine-press (part of a treading floor is preserved). Nomos of Karditsa (34th EPCA: 19th EBA) Argithea, Ellinika. L. Chatziangelakis (then 15th EPCA, now Director, 34th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 484-85) the discovery of five cist tombs from the city's east cemetery, built of hard limestone slabs. Tomb 5/230 contained three third-century askoi of guttus type, an unguentarium, a lamp, an oinochoe, a bronze mirror, gold earrings depicting an Eros and a fourth-century BC silver coin of Aiane.</page><page sequence="111">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 111 Karya, Agriokeraso. L. Chatziangelakis reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 484; AEThSE 1, 75) the discovery of a new cemetery site (previously looted) in the course of work by the electricity company at Agriokeraso, near the Acheloos river. In the coarse of widening a trackway for this work, three long apsidal stone constructions were found. They are oriented east-west and their gravel floors are preserved. Finds comprise handmade pottery, a two-handled skyphos, four one-handled cups of different sizes, double handles, spindle-whorls and a necklace of stone beads. A large number of stone tools, including hammers, millstones and objects in flint, indicates an area for tool production and the working of flint, just as the large quantity of arrow- heads attests to hunting. A small cist grave, for a child, was found to the west, empty. Philia, Sanctuary of Athena Itonia. Reappraisal of finds from the sanctuary by B. Intzesiloglou (13th EPCA) ( AEThSE 1, 221-37; cf BCH 127 [2003], 891) confirms the identification of the deity worshipped: the oldest finds date to LHIIIB, with offerings of the Protogeometric, Geometric and Archaic periods. Many metal objects were found in an ash layer, interpreted as the remains of an altar, scattered across the sanctuary, but here argued to be a destruction level following a fire in the wood around the sanctuary during the sixth century. Neochori, Avros. A. Yalouri (7th EBA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 520) the discovery of the west part (and northwest corner) of a large building. The remains of three rooms were preserved, plus a peribolos wall to the west of the building. The cuttings for wooden beams are preserved on the walls inside the rooms. The building was destroyed by fire. This may have been the seat of the Archbishop of Phanari and Neochori, since Neochori become an episcopal seat in 1588 and an archiepiscopal in 1596.

Mitropoli, Karkaletsi property: potter's kiln 1. Town Square. In the context of a wider discussion of the ceramic workshops of Mitropoli, A. Kalogianni, I. Oikonomou and V. Rondiri (13th EPCA) discuss (AEThSE 2, 381-93, see 384) two additional potter's kilns discovered during the landscaping of the square in 2003. The first kiln is rectangular and oriented north-south. The firing chamber is divided into five by four brick partition walls. Part of the brick chamber wall and of the kiln mouth were excavated, but the interior was not. The remains of a building complex were found nearby, as well as a refuse deposit containing abundant pottery and misfired fragments of Roman amphorae. The second, round, kiln was partially destroyed by a refuse pit. The walls are of clay and the kiln is delimited by tile and rubble fragments. The kiln floor, of beaten earth, was covered by a layer of ash with some sherds. Finds include pottery, weights, stamped tiles, decorated bricks, figurines, six coins and metal tools. The second kiln is Hellenistic in date, while the first (along with the neighbouring building foundations and the refuse pit) dates to the end of the Hellenistic and the Roman period. Stavroulaki field. V. Rontiri reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 488-89) the dismantling of a tumulus located 2km north of Mitropoli. The fill (to 3m deep) contained nothing but a bronze bracelet. In the northwestern part of the tumulus were six sandstone sarcophagi, oriented north- south, all of which had been looted, as well as an offering table and a grave stele (Fig. 122). 122.

Building remains were found in several places inside the fortification. Finds include Classical, Hellenistic and Roman pottery, fragments of lamps and loomweights, as well as tiles, some of which were stamped KIEPIQN. Cemetery. E. Nikolaou (13th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 480) the discovery of four cist tombs, with pottery and lamps of the end of the Classical period, from the cemetery of Kierion, at Mascholourio. Mataranga, Chomatokastro. L. Chatziangelakis reports (AEThSE 2, 778-79) the discovery of a small Protogeometric tholos tomb (2m interior diameter) preserved to 0.86m high. The main inhumation was found, in extended position, in the centre of the chamber, with several secondary burials (assembled bones) disposed around it (four crania were found). The tomb had been robbed and few goods remained - a Protogeometric cut- away necked jug, one stone and one gilded bead, and a bronze ornament. Ermitsi. L. Chatziangelakis reports (AEThSE 2, 775-76) the discovery of three apsidal buildings and the wall of a further structure in the course of excavation for the widening of the Karditsa-Larisa road. Associated finds date to the Middle Helladic period. Building A is an apsidal one-roomed structure, 8.4m long, preserved only to foundation level. Fragments of tile and the rim of a pithos were found inside. Building B, 9m northwest, is a one-roomed structure, 7.6m long and 4.5m wide as preserved, with an earthen floor. The apse, to the north, was destroyed by excavation for the road. Finds comprise grinding stones and stone tools, scrapers and polishers, flint blades, domestic pottery and Minyan ware. Building l~, 15m long and 0.4m high, is parallel to building B. Finds comprise grinding stones, stone tools, bobbins and spindle-whorls, domestic pottery and Minyan ware. Finally, a wall (9m long as preserved) probably belongs to a fourth building, D, 9m away. Palamas (Thermopylon Street). L. Chatziangelakis reports (AEThSE 2, 777-78) the discovery, on the east side of Papoutsi (Chandaki) magoula, of a section of fortifi- cation wall, 1.5m wide and 6.5m long, of worked limestone blocks and rubble. To the northwest of the internal face is a 5.7m wide street which follows the course of the fortification, as well as a well-constructed building parallel to it. Objects of bronze and gold, and Late Helladic pottery, were recovered. Astritsa. L. Chatziangelakis reports (AEThSE 2, 773-74) the discovery of a magoula on the Makri property east of Astritsa (in an area where Neolithic and Mycenaean remains have previously been reported). Architectural remains, deposits of burnt clay, postholes and a beaten- earth floor were found. The pottery, including a large fruitstand, and small finds date to the Late Neolithic period. Sykeon, Kastro. L. Chatziangelakis reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 481-84; AEThSE 1, 71) on rescue excavation on a hill north of Sykeon where Middle Helladic pottery was found in the 1980s. On the top of the hill is part of a probable defensive circuit, with traces of architecture visible to the southwest. A quantity of tiles was scattered around the buildings, some of which bear the name Ol AOSENOY (Fig. 123). A large public building of the Classical period, oriented northwest-southeast and 16.8m long, was built of schist blocks: the northeast and southwest walls (9.2m long), preserved to foundation level, were revealed almost in their entirety. The building had a central interior colonnade with six square bases for wooden columns. Finds comprise Classical pottery, Archaic and Hellenistic figurine fragments, stamped tiles and bronze coins of the fourth to third century BC, as well as nails and bronze hooks. Traces of a Middle Helladic structure were found in deeper levels beneath the Classical building. The remains comprise: a wall running east-west, 6.2m long, of small fieldstones; a small section of a parallel wall, 6m to the north; a small perpendicular wall, under the southwest wall of the Classical building; to the east, an apsidal structure (clay found in the interior surely derives from the mud-bricks used for the walls). In the middle of the long wall were numerous sherds and burnt earth, storage vessels in situ and two stone struc- tures, one identified as a hearth. The floor is of beaten earth. Finds include handmade pithoi and domestic handmade pottery (mostly for storage and cooking), two- handled skyphoi, pyramidal loomweights, spindle-whorls, figurines, and weights and tools in stone and flint.

A construction date at the end of the fourth century is confirmed. There was a small gate at the northwest and a gate at the west. A public building was revealed inside the town: finds include terracotta figurines related to the cult of Dionysos and a votive relief linked to the cult of Asklepios. A subsequent press report (Apogevmatini [11/06/09]) coverage emphasizes the range of Neolithic to Early Roman finds made in this area, graves included. EPIRUS By Catherine Morgan Nomos of Arta (33rd EPCA: 18th EBA) Arta Garouphalia Street (Ch. Theodorou property). A. Angeli (12th EPCA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 546- 47) continuing excavation of an olive press ( cf. ADelt 54 [1999] Chr, 460-62). Work on the main extraction area (B) was completed and the adjunct areas to the south investigated (Fig. 124). The complete extent of area B was revealed (7.5m x 8.75m). The oil reservoir lay at the north, with stone paving on either side laid on and secured with hydraulic cement. North of the reservoir is the base for the basin used to press the olive paste. A hearth to the east may have heated the water poured onto the paste to increase the amount of oil extracted. Area B also produced portable finds associated with the first stage of olive processing: three pieces of millstone, including part of a trapetum, and a large quantity of olive stones over the floor. A lane to the N leads into area T and the larger area Al. All were covered with a destruction deposit including Laconian roof tiles (stamped B) of the end of the first to the early second century AD. In the northern part of the lane was a rectangular monolithic base with postholes for the press levers. A further room lay to the west. North of Al was a room which communicated with an open area outside the workshop (with which it shared a common roof). A small storeroom containing storage vessels lay on the northeast side of area B. Large quantities of pottery date the use of the workshop from the mid second century BC to the early second century AD. Other finds include iron tools, Late Hellenistic and Roman bronze coins, glass vessels, bronze and bone pins, bronze fibulae, bronze nails and lead sheet. At a deeper level were walls from an earlier, Early Hellenistic, phase of the workshop destroyed in the early second century BC. Tzanetou Street (Rapti-Oikonomidi property). A. Angeli reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 547-48) the discovery of a house with at least four rooms, built of unworked limestone. Pottery from across the house implies a Classical date for the structure (noting also a little Archaic). Preservation is too poor to reconstruct the plan. In the northern part of the plot are two more recent round structures. Krystali Street (Charitou property). A. Angeli reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 548) a funerary peribolos and Archaic to Hellenistic tombs on either side of the modern road in the area of the east cemetery of Ambrakia on the Koutsomytas hill {cf. ADelt 47 [1992] Chr, 273-78). Tombs of various types (cists, pits, tiles and other reposi- tories) are arranged in groups or pairs. Priovolou Street (Manakanata property). A. Angeli reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 548-49) on excavation in the centre of ancient Ambrakia which revealed most of a house (18.5m long) and part of a north-south cobbled road to the east of it.</page><page sequence="114">114 CATHERINE MORGAN 124. Arta, Garouphalia Street: olive-processing facility. The external, street wall is built of roughly-worked blocks with a drainage channel to remove rain-water from an internal paved courtyard out to the road. The house had at least seven areas: a courtyard with a well, two rooms to the west and northwest, and, to the east, a room which had, hollowed into the bedrock, a deposit of Classical pottery sealed with a clay layer. The southeast room was a kitchen: beneath a thick layer of stone chips lay a closed deposit of domestic pottery, especially cookware. A room further to the east was damaged by a Byzantine deposit. The house was built in the Classical period and remained in use throughout the Hellenistic. Archaic pottery (chiefly skyphoi and small kotyles) was also found, but not in association with architecture. Small finds include eight silver coins and 183 bronze, mostly Hellenistic in date, plus a gold ring. Byzantine occupation is represented by a number of walls, part of a hearth and two deposits. Pouliou Drakou Street (O.T. 403, Papanikolaou property). A. Angeli reports ( ADelt55 [2000] Chr , 549- 50) the completion of excavation of a peristyle court plus two internal rooms of a Roman building in the southwest of Arta, outside the walls of Ambrakia (cf. ADelt 54 [1999] Chr, 462). Seven orthogonal limestone column bases belong to the north, west and south sides of the peristyle; on the south, two bases have parts of sandstone Doric columns in situ . The debris of the fallen roof covered the entire court. Two rooms opened onto the south side of the peristyle (the south room has a large limestone threshold block) and have exterior walls mostly in opus testaceum (with a small part in opus spicatum). In a later phase, the south corridor of the peristyle was closed off with a wall incorporating earlier spolia. A number of later walls are found in the north of the plot. An earlier, Hellenistic, phase is represented by small sections of limestone wall at greater depth, mainly in the southern part of the plot. Pottery dates to the third to second century. In addition to domestic pottery, finds include red-slip plates, bronze coins, glass vessels, and metal and bone small objects. Pieces of sandstone columns and a Doric column capital were scattered across the plot, perhaps after use in later constructions. Pouliou Drakou and Zarra Streets (O.T. 416, Tachou descendants property). A. Angeli and Th. Kontogianni (12th EPCA) report ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 550-52) the completion of excavation on this plot. Part of a north-south road leading to the city wall was flanked by buildings on each side. These buildings date from the fourth to the second century BC with small exten- sions and adaptations but no significant change to their internal arrangement. The cobbled road (5m wide) has a lm wide pavement along the left side. The east retaining wall of the road is also the external wall of a roadside house, of which four rooms were explored. All were covered with a thick destruction deposit of the first half of the second century BC which extends over the road. The north room is likely an andron, with a fine gravel and cement floor (the floor elsewhere was of stone chips and tile in beaten earth). The courtyard, with a well in the</page><page sequence="115">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 115 centre, lies immediately to the south. After the second- century destruction, the courtyard was paved in stone; a rubbish deposit north of the well contains Hellenistic tile and pottery as well as building material. West of the road two buildings were separated by a sewer which runs north-south parallel to the road. The first building has three large rooms with a street entrance and several smaller rooms to the west of them, although preservation is too poor to restore the plan. These areas preserve traces of stone, tile and sherd flooring, and there is a similar floor in a probable open court to the south. The building was destroyed in the first half of the second century BC: a thick destruction level is ubiquitous, and a large rubbish pit contains fourth to third-century sherds and building debris. The second building, west of the channel, was only partially explored due to a landslip: the south wall follows the course of the city's defensive circuit, 10-llm away. Many fragmentary vessels, terracotta figurines and relief plaques, and a large quantity of unfired clay in many areas of the two buildings and the water channel identify this as a workshop. The proximity of the buildings to the city wall, and the gate through which the road to the cemetery passed, also fits such activity. Finds include Hellenistic pottery, terracotta figurines and relief plaques, many bronze coins of Ambrakia (third- to second-century BC) and two of the Molossian koinon (fourth-century BC), as well as small metal objects. In the north, below the level of the building west of the road, was a layer of Geometric pottery mixed with unworked stones (not connected with visible architecture). This is the first evidence of this date found in the south of the city. Junction of Solomos and Makrygianni Streets (Dova property). Th. Kontogianni reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 552-54) the results of two excavations on the site of proposed buildings. The site was severely disturbed by later activity and the high water table precluded excavation to depth. Architectural remains revealed successive construction and use phases during the Classical and Hellenistic periods which, with minor modifications, preserved the basic arrangement of the structures. In sector A (Fig. 125), the west wing of the house partly uncovered in area B was found, noting two rooms with white pebble floors. The house, which has a 15m long fagade, neighbours two houses separated by a water 125. Arta, junction of Solomos and Makrygianni Streets: sector A. channel within the width of one insula; these insulae are defined by the parallel streets that run every ca. 31m across the city. The channel is covered with two large slabs at the south end: it runs northwest-southeast and joins at the southeast a channel discovered in 1998 on the neighbouring property. A cobbled lane runs obliquely to the channel, northeast-southwest, with a small conduit along its east side: it runs parallel to another excavated in 1997. In between the two lanes is the north house, of which two rooms are partially preserved. The east of these rooms was too severely damaged by later incursions and flood to investigate. Tlie west room is the andron, with a well-made paved floor, a shallow step round the walls and a small stone column. The south house had two main areas, one a room with a pebble pavement and the other the central court with a stone paving in its last phase. Beneath the Hellenistic court surface was a system of small channels which led into the lane and thence the main channel. The dense destruction deposit over the lane and much of the north house dates the destruction of this area to the second century. Pottery is mainly Hellenistic, but also includes fifth- to fourth-century material from the deeper levels, the lowest construction level and a deposit in the lane. A few coins and small metal objects were collected. In sector B (Fig. 126), an ancient road (4.6-4.8m wide), oriented northwest-southeast, forms part of the dense network of parallel streets which, together with the intersecting major avenues, define the city grid. Surfaced with cobbles and tile, it had a pavement along the west side; the retaining wall on the east was the boundary of the neighbouring building. West of the road is the central court of a house (4.5m x 4m), plus part of four rooms around it. In the last phase of use, this court had a stone paving in cement, as does the neighbouring room to the west; in the middle is a hearth. A thick destruction layer over the road, especially the west side, dates the destruction of the house to the second century. Finds include Classical and Hellenistic pottery, plus many bronze coins, mostly of Ambrakia, and small metal objects. Kosma Aitolou Street (Zerva property). Th. Kontogianni reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 554-55) the completion of excavation in the centre of the ancient city (cf. ADelt 54 [1999] Chr , 470) which revealed parts of 126. Arta, junction of Solomos and Makrygianni Streets: sector B.</page><page sequence="116">116 CATHERINE MORGAN three houses separated by water channels. These houses, with minor extensions and modifications, date from Archaic to Hellenistic times (seventh/sixth to second century BC). House A in the northwestern part of the plot included three rooms, one of which had a pebble pavement. Of house B to the south only a corner was preserved. Of house T, in the east of the plot, only two rooms can be traced, badly damaged by later building. The final construction phase dates to the fourth century BC, and the dense destruction deposit which covers mainly houses A and B and the water channels dates the destruction to the end of the third or the early second century BC. An earlier, early fifth-century, phase is recognized in sections of wall in house T and in a destruction deposit of the end of the fifth century in this area. Archaic construction is seen in the lowest levels of the walls of house B (first half of the sixth century BC) and in the foundation level of the walls of house T (seventh to sixth century BC). An extensive layer of (mostly local) Late Geometric pottery was found across the plot, with no associated architecture. There were also a few bronze coins of Ambrakia and small metal objects. Kosma Aitolou and Philellinon Streets (Rombou property). Th. Kontogianni reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 555) the discovery on a plot slightly to the east of the Zerva property of a road and a roadside house to the east. The cobbled road, one of the dense network of cross- streets in the city grid, running northwest-southeast, was 3.5-4m wide and was traced for a length of 17.8m. A pavement ran along the west side. The east retaining wall was also the front wall of the roadside house within which two main areas are noted - a courtyard with a pebble and paved floor and a water channel, and a tripart andron with a shallow step round the walls of the two southern parts and fine pebble pavements (white in the northern part, and grey and white in the others, with traces of red colour mainly in the east). The Classical phase of the house is seen in the lower parts of the exterior walls and in the courtyard where there is evidence for differences in the arrangement of the interior space. A group of miniature vases was found in a building dedication deposit in the courtyard. Beneath the road surface in the south was an Archaic pithos burial. Finds include Classical and Hellenistic pottery, with notable Archaic from the burial, many bronze coins of Ambrakia, mostly third- to second-century BC, and small metal objects. Arachthou Street (Andreou property). Th. Kontogianni reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 556) the discovery of part of a building and water channel outside the ancient city wall, between the wall and the river Arachthos. Ambrakia Street (Papazoglou property). Th. Kontogianni reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 556) the discovery of a destruction deposit of tile and building materials, and a cist tomb with Byzantine burials. Hill of Perranthi. V. Karatzeni (12th EPCA) reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 589) the discovery of ancient walling in worked blocks on the west slope of the hill. This is likely a fortress belonging to the defensive system of ancient Ambrakia. Nomos of Preveza (33rd EPCA: 18th EBA) Nikopolis Monument of Octavian Augustus. K. Zachos and Ch. Kappa (12th EPCA) report {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 557-60) continuing excavation of the victory monument (Fig. 127). At the east retaining wall the rain-water drain continued to be traced and its construction examined in detail. It stops at the level of the upper terrace and did not continue beyond the wall of the left part of the podium. Investigation also focused on the brick structure at the end of the channel {cfi ADelt 54 [1999] Chr, 471-73): the southeast and west sides are in opus testaceum, while the west has the same loose construction as the channel. It postdates the first, Augustan, phase of construction and its position, along with an Augustan Ionic column capital re- used in the structure, suggests that it marked the entrance to the monument from the upper terrace. More of the eastern part of the stoa was exposed, including the foundation of the median wall for a length of 18m. The lowest part of the foundation is in sandstone with hard limestone above. South of the altar, excavation continued between the central monumental altar and the water channel. The pavement of this area is not in contact with the altar foundation where there was a thick soil packing layer. Along the south wall of the altar was a destruction layer in situ of the marble sculpted decoration of the altar, with many pointed amphorae and evidence of burning. In addition to fragments of waves and garlands, there were depictions of the muzzle of a wild boar (AK 1937), of human figures and of the rostrum of a ship (Fig. 128). House of Manius Antoninus. K. Zachos and Th. Kyrkou (12th EPCA) report {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 561- 63) on the third season of excavation in this Roman house, focusing on the southern area (Fig. 129). Fifteen new rooms and areas were revealed, plus one floor mosaic, parts of four drainage channels and the cistern in the second courtyard. West of the tetrastyle court, excavation of the likely triclinium (room III) was completed {cf. ADelt 53 [1998] Chr, 508-11). This room, entered from the court via a doorway with a well-worked threshold block, originally communicated with the room to the north, but this was blocked. The floor mosaic has a design of 11 orthogonal areas with geometric motifs and a central emblema with a different subject, probably a figure but largely destroyed. A third-century AD date is proposed. Ancient damage was repaired with tiles on the east and west sides. Traces of wall-paintings with plant designs are noted on the north and west walls. Much plain domestic pottery was recovered from the room, as well as fourth-century coins. Room III communicates with two rooms, V and VI, to the north and west, with plaster floors; room VI has wall- paintings, and it is possible that both were andrones. North of the tetrastyle court, room IV, with a plaster floor and probably also marble cladding on the walls, was extended to the northeast. It is probably later than IV and V, and has original communicating doors blocked up. A small room with a hypocaust was found east of room IV; there were remains of burning over the floor, as well as three series of support columns and tegulae mammatae from the walls. East of this room was a well, perhaps linked to the operation of the hypocaust.</page><page sequence="117">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 117 127.

Nikopolis, House of Manius Antoninus. In the southwest were sections of four sewers. It is clear that the building extends to the north beyond the excavation area. Nikopolis. A full account of work to conserve and present the Roman cemeteries and fortifications is presented (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 563-76, 582-84, 586- 87). In attention to summary accounts of the monuments, the results of targeted excavation are reported (Fig. 130). At the south gate in the Roman fortification, excavation revealed details of the construction of the east and west towers and the sections of wall beside them. In front of the east side of the west part of the wall, finds include part of an inscribed funerary stele. South cemetery. Two mausoleia were investigated. Within the west tower lay mausoleum 1 (7.2m x 8.4m) with walls faced in opus testaceum and a cement floor on which were sarcophagi, and which had a central area of opus tesselatum. There was a niche in the west wall and two steps in the east side (where there was likely an entrance from the street of tombs). Mausoleum 2 (5.3m x 8.5m) has a tiled floor. On the north side was a second- to third-century BC stone sarcophagus of the Assos type inscribed on the lower part. Among the spolia in the area is a sarcophagus fragment inscribed: ANT I TO NH ETQN. Mausoleum 3 lies south of the eastern part of the south gate (5.2m x 4.2m, oriented east- west) with the entrance on the west in opus incertum and a clay floor. On the long sides are niches for cinerary urns. Two cist tombs, in contact with the north and south walls, each contained a built headrest; both were robbed, with only a few bones, pottery of the second half of the fourth century AD and fragments of glass vessels preserved. In the area around the eastern part of the wall, some 50 tombs were found, mostly robbed, of which 33 were brick- built cists and 17 tile graves. Among these, grave 19, a child cremation, contained six terracotta dolls, four terra- cotta female figurines, a gold ring, a glass cup and an unguentarium, a bronze nail and iron wheels from a toy. Finds indicate that the south cemetery was used from the first to the fourth century AD. Tombs arranged on both sides of the road that passed through the south gate respect the line of the wall, thus providing a terminus ante quern for its construction. North section of the Roman wall and north cemetery. Following extensive cleaning, excavation focused on the wall, the north gate, part of the ancient road and the north cemetery. Two stretches of the wall were exposed, 22m long east of the gate and 94m long to the west, plus most of the east tower (5.6m x 9m). A large number of bricks were stamped TVR and TN. The tower had a second storey; inside, a later partition wall includes a quantity of architectural spolia. Most of the west tower was exposed, revealing a construction very similar to the east tower; inside was part of a floor in opus spicatum. A strong wall linking the tower with the spring of the arch includes re-used material (bricks, stone blocks and sculpture). This looks like a temporary later structure contemporary with modifications elsewhere. The gate (a monumental arched</page><page sequence="119">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 119 construction with a stone parapet) is one of the main entrances to the city through which ran the cardo. The road through the gate had hard limestone paving. Excavation of, and outside, the Early Christian city wall revealed three building phases; three orthogonal towers and the inter- vening wall were traced (see also E Kephallonitou [Director, 8th EBA], ADelt55 [2000] Chr, 601). The north cemetery extends outside the city walls. Forty eight tombs were found within eight funerary periboloi. Tomb types are brick-built cists (often with built headrests), pits, tile graves, enchytrismoi (in amphorae), simple inhumations and built receptacles. Both adults and children were buried. Grave goods comprised terracotta lamps (Fig. 131), glass vessels (unguentaria), small bronze items (coins, needles) and occasional personal items such as a bone comb and necklace. Peribolos A contained four cists; peribolos B a cist with an inscribed marble stele in situ and a tile grave; peribolos T had six tombs (two tile graves, a pit, an enchytrismos , one disturbed grave and a cist with an in situ inscribed marble stele); peribolos A had only one badly damaged tomb; peribolos E contained 12 tombs with pottery and burnt material from funerary offerings in the fill between them; peribolos Zt had eight tombs including a cist with two inscribed marble stelae. Peribolos Z contained seven cists, a simple inhumation, four tile graves and two tomb receptacles; here several cists contained multiple burials, reburials and inurned crema- tions, and the tile graves single burials, often disarticulated and with poor goods in comparison with the cists. The receptacles were sealed with the strong mortar used to line the floor, and were either ossuaries or held inurned crema- 130.

The excavated portion of peribolos H contains three cists and, in the east, a probable mausoleum which postdates the earliest burials here. Finally, test excavation revealed the walling of a large Roman building on the southern borders of the city. K. Zachos, Th. Kyrkou and Ch.

Georgios. Ypsoma Paliokklisi. A cemetery was located on the southwest slopes of this hill: a stone cist tomb contained a few bones, probably of a child, and a second-century BC squat lekythos. On the top of the hill were the remains of a walled settlement. Agios Georgios, Chalikia, Ypsoma Diministra. Part of a Roman farmstead was identified, including a room (A) with a floor mosaic with geometric designs and parts of the marble interior decoration. The walls were built with field-stones and cement, with the exception of the area round the door which was in opus testaceum. Inside, the wall-plaster had a red colour. There is evidence for a second storey. Among the other rooms of the house to the south, one (B) had evidence against the south wall for a low step in opus testaceum and a TT-shaped structure with a column in the middle, perhaps a form of apse. In the area of the apse and the step were strong burning, glass fragments and a mass of clay with fruit impressions. A third room(?) neighbouring B contained a destruction deposit. Southeast of this was a water channel. Portable finds include bronze Imperial coins, fragments of tegulae mammatae confirming the presence of baths, sherds and glass vessels. The building was in use from the first/second to the fifth century AD. Nomos of Thesprotia (32nd EPCA: 8th EBA) Publications: A. Kanta-Kitsou, O. Palli and I.

K3 (also oval) is built of clay and mud-brick, and preserves the firing chamber with an oblong column in the middle. Inside the rectangular K4 was a small iron knife. The firing chamber of K7, built of mud-brick and coated with clay inside, is divided by a pair of small mud-brick walls. The large number of kilns in the area indicates an organized workshop which, according to local inhabitants, functioned until the late Ottoman period. Goupes. A partly-preserved Hellenistic building lay under a dense destruction layer. The walls, of unworked stones, are preserved to foundation level. Finds include sherds and a few complete pots, plus many iron nails. Inside was a silver-plated bronze ring with a gold nugget in the bezel. Perdika. G. Riginos reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 664- 65) on excavation at the fortified settlement identified as ancient Elina. Building A (30m x 30m) is located on the south side of acropolis A. The walls are of unworked 132. Perdika: bronze mask from building A.</page><page sequence="121">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 121 rectangular limestone blocks with no connecting material. To the south was a partly rock-cut road or passage. Excavation inside the building revealed parts of the walls of at least two rooms separated by aisles. Along the east side of the building, a stoa defines an atrium. The building's dimensions, its location in the fortified settlement and the finds inside it (e.g. a bronze mask depicting the head of a bearded god [Fig. 132]) suggest that building A was a public building. Building B was built on a rectangular terrace. The partly excavated walls delimit a wing (unit I) of at least two rooms. The walls of unit I are also built of unworked limestone. The roof was tiled. Finds include coarse and fine pottery, loomweights, five bronze coins, iron nails, lead sheet and part of a bronze clasp. Faskomilia, Syvota (Galanouli property). G. Riginos reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 663) the discovery of a layer of pottery and tile, stones and pebbles, probably connected with a stream running through the plot. The coarsewares are of different periods; the ancient pottery came from the neighbouring hill top (the site of the small kastro of Faskomilia). Ladochori, Igoumenitsa N. Vasilikou and F.

Part of a building, with three adjoining rooms running north-south, continues west beyond the excavation plot. The walls were of flat stones bound with mortar and the room floors of beaten earth. To the south of the south wall was part of a paved surface or road with two building phases. Fourteen graves were found, oriented east-west with no goods (four enchytrismoi , eight tile graves of different forms and two cist graves). Finds include 315 worn bronze coins, 68 bronze items (mostly nails), 32 fragments of glass vessels, six bronze pins, 21 broken pottery vessels (mostly lamps), sherds of plain domestic pottery and three marble fragments (one from a table). These are mostly Early Christian in date, but include material from earlier construction phases. O.T. 58/02, G. and S. Papavasileiou property. A room was defined by four walls of rubble and mortar, with an opening on the south side. Inside were sherds of large storage vessels with combed decoration, domestic pottery and a little tile. O.T. 52/07, V. Stavropoulou property. A room was found with three walls of stone and mortar, as well as part of a paved surface and a conduit. Finds are very few - mainly plainware sherds and small worn bronze coins. O.T. 60, no. 17, Daflaki property. The first stages of excavation, 50m east of the Sokoli plot, revealed tiles, domestic pottery, stones, glass fragments and six coins. A water channel was also found. K. and I. Loli property. Sections of wall were found from two rooms; surface cleaning produced 34 bronze coins, a lamp with a cross motif, a few bronze attachments and sherds of vessels, lamps and glass vessels. Igoumenitsa G. Riginos reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 666) the discovery of three tile-grave tombs within the area expropriated for the construction of the road connecting Igoumenitsa harbour with the Egnatia Odos (Ladochorio junction). G. Riginos reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 656-57) on excavations at two locations. In the southwest corner of the Kastro, a tile grave, oriented east-west, contained one burial accompanied by a lamp, a small pot and a glass unguentarium(?), plus an Imperial Roman bronze coin in the deceased's mouth. Excavation during restoration of the Pyrgos Ragiou revealed a rectangular, single-roomed Ottoman building (4.85m x 6m) beside the ancient walls. Metal horse-shoes and abundant iron nails indicate that this was a stable associated with the tower. Under its floor lay part of the foundation ditch for the ancient wall: finds from the area include two abraded bronze coins of Kerkyra of 300-229 BC. Nea Seleukeia, Lioubesi (landholding 319). G.

A pipeline system and a rectangular building (internally 2.9m x 5m) with at least two architec- tural phases were found. During the second phase the building had a plaster floor and a terracotta bathtub. Finds include much coarse pottery, a little Hellenistic black- glazed ware, pyramidal loomweights, and iron fragments and iron nails from the pipeline system. Bronze jewellery was also found, plus a fourth-century BC silver Corinthian drachma and a few Hellenistic bronze coins. Tsiota and Natsi property. Here, two robbed cist graves were constructed and first used in the Hellenistic period, although Roman and Early Christian coins indicate continuing use at least into Early Christian times. Byzantine baths. N. Vasilikou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 598-600) on excavation conducted in the context of restoration work. The walls of a probable apodyterion were found, with a domed roof and a stone paved floor. On the east side are built stone benches with indentations and, in the centre of the room, a marble-clad basin with supply and drainage channels. A small adjunct room leads to a further domed room which may be the tepidarium. The floor was likely paved in marble. The two next rooms, with a hypocaust system, were likely caldaria - the smaller being a private room off the main chamber. Remains of a vaulted cistern were found in the south and, below it, the main heating system with hot-air conduits leading from the furnace. Many water channels, with terracotta pipes, were found in the eastern part of the bath. Finds were mostly glazed Middle Byzantine sherds and a few Ottoman coins. A 15th-century date is suggested.</page><page sequence="122">122 CATHERINE MORGAN Thesprotia Expedition. B. Forsen (Finnish Institute at Athens) reports on the 2009 campaign. Magnetometry survey was conducted at sites PS 12 (Neolithic to Bronze Age), PS 13 (Late Roman farmstead), PS 14 (possible monumental Hellenistic heroon, noting ca. 20 large blocks re-used in a stone wall) and PS 37 (Late Classical to Early Hellenistic farmstead). No clear surviving walls were found at PS 13. At PS 14 the possible location of the heroon was identified but no clear plan was obtained due to later disturbance. At PS 37 the farmstead was located and beside it a probable pottery kiln as well as two large pits. At PS 12 only a small part of the site was surveyed, revealing the straight continuation for at least 15m of the wall traced for 9m in a trial trench. This wall is likely a terrace, following the contour lines. At PS 12, a C14 date of the start of the Late Bronze Age was obtained from a bone from the fill between the blocks of the terrace wall. Some 6m upslope from the terrace wall was a grave tumulus (ca. 9- 10m in diameter) with a perimeter wall and a fill of stones and soil (Fig. 133). Within it were two badly-preserved child graves and, in the centre, an intact cist grave with the remains of two adults but no grave offerings. A C14 sample from the burial dates it to the Middle to Late Bronze Age transition. The tumulus was built upon a ca. 0.2m deep layer containing Early Bronze Age pottery mixed with a few Neolithic sherds. The pottery includes several spoons and corded ware which ties the site into a wide Balkan Early Bronze Age network. Remains of daub, a possible fireplace, several spindle-whorls and flint sickles with gloss from cutting grain were also found. Several C14 samples date the layer to the beginning of the Early Bronze Age. A further cist grave ca. 75m to the south was of similar construction to that in the tumulus. It had been looted and half of the burial thrown out; no grave goods were found. A C14 sample from the burial dates it to the beginning of the Late Bronze Age. It remains unclear whether this grave was part of a tumulus and/or constructed on top of an earlier settlement layer. In sum, PS 12 seems to be a late Middle Bronze Age to early Late Bronze Age cemetery located on top of a mainly Early Bronze Age settlement. The terrace wall is roughly contemporary with the graves, and may form a border between them and the lower lying fields where the contemporary settlement may have been located. At Ag. Donatos Zervochoriou (PS 25), a small fortified Early Hellenistic acropolis, excavation was pursued to investigate the architecture of the Early Roman villa rustica identified in 2008. Two rooms of the villa were revealed in their entirety. One ( ca . 2.4m x 5m) had high-quality wall-paintings (panels in different colours with plant motifs). The other was a cellar with an entrance from the south and a dump of mainly Hellenistic pottery on the floor. Two small rooms were found to the north of the room with the wall-paintings. One was almost empty, whereas the other contained a thick layer of tiles below which was a dump containing a large quantity of animal bone and cooking pot sherds. The room was originally designed to collect rain-water: the floor and the lower parts of the walls are coated in hydraulic plaster, and a channel leads downhill from the room probably towards a cistern. Inside the channel, seven bronze coins were found: some are Early Hellenistic, but at least one, a first- century AD coin minted in Apollonia, has a direct connection to the villa. 133. Thesprotia Expedition: grave tumulus. Finally, a round room (ca. 5m in diameter), with hydraulic plaster on the floor and lower walls, was explored to clarify its function. Further cleaning and mapping of the visible opus incertum walls indicates that the villa measured ca. 90m x 40m, although the residents also used the Hellenistic tower some 20m to the east. Zervochori. G. Riginos reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 666-67) on the finds made during the land redistribution project on the plain of Paramythias. Concentrations of surface pottery and architectural remains (walls, tombs, etc.) were located in various fields in the vicinity of Zervochori. Eleftherochori Palaia Krini. N. Vasilikou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 619-21) the discovery of a potter's kiln and building during excavation for the construction of the Egnatia Odos. The round kiln, oriented north-south, had a two-storey subterranean praefurnium, furnace and firing chamber. The furnace chamber had clay walls and the firing chamber was built of unworked stone lined with brick and clay. Four supports for the eschara were preserved. The chamber contained fragments of tile and brick, as well as plain domestic pottery and decorated pithos rim - the products of the kiln cannot be precisely determined. Excavation east of Palaia Krini revealed the walls of an Early Christian multi-roomed building of rubble and mortar, which has more than one construction phase and which continued beyond the plot. Four tombs were found, oriented east-west, two of which contained grave goods (plain pottery, a glass vessel and a bronze coin). Finds from the area include 65 small bronze coins (some of the reigns of Theodosios II, AD 408-450, and Zenon, AD 474-491), much tile and brick, domestic pottery, glass vessels and small metal objects. Architectural members in marble and other stones are reported. The kiln and the building complex were likely contemporary. Lofos. N. Vasilikou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 621-22) the discovery of a building complex during excavation for the construction of the Egnatia Odos (Fig. 134). The northwest and southwest walls of the complex were discovered. Inside were the remains of three oval kilns along the northwest side of the complex, a cistern on the south, and different rooms and spaces. All three kilns were built of tile, brick and sandstone, with paved floors</page><page sequence="123">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 123 134. Eleftherochori, Lofos: plan of building complex. and air ducts. Finds from the complex include metal objects (mostly nails), 10 Ottoman coins, plain pottery, Ottoman clay pipes and glazed sherds. Krystallopigi (Selliani), Rachi Velli. N. Vasilikou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 625-27) on rescue excavation on a hill southwest of Rachi Velli, to the left of the road from Neraida to Paramythia. The foundations of a building complex were revealed, showing at least two phases of construction, along with tile graves without grave goods. To one building phase belongs a large three-aisled basilica with an apse, of rubble and mortar construction. On the west side is a rectangular construction which may be the Early Christian baptis- terion containing a font. Finds are few for a building of this size - sherds of glass and pottery vessels, the lid of a storage vessel, a column capital, a small part of a parapet, a terracotta lamp, bronze coins and a variety of other small objects. A stone plaque with an engraved cross may come from a parapet. Korytiani (irrigation of the plain of Riziani-Korytiani). G. Riginos reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 657-59) on rescue excavation at two sites. North of the national road from Igoumenitsa to Ioannina, the caldarium of a Roman bath was uncovered (dated by 10 bronze coins to the fourth to fifth century AD). A notable collection of pottery, including much relief ware,</page><page sequence="124">124 CATHERINE MORGAN was recovered. The complex was founded on the remains of two earlier (Hellenistic) architectural phases (Fig. 135). South of the national road and 300m from the junction to Dramesi, part of a large building was uncovered, of date and function as yet unknown. After the abandonment of this building, the area was used as a cemetery: 12 Byzantine cist graves contained limited grave goods. He further reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 666) two robbed cist tombs at site K23 of the irrigation project, south of the national road in the demos of Parapotamou. Geroplatanos, Doliani. G. Riginos reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 659-660) on excavation along the road connecting Geroplatanos with the new bridge over the Kalamas river, northeast of the ancient settlement at Doliani, at the base of the hill associated by Dakaris with the cemetery of that settlement. Eleven cist graves, all oriented northwest-southeast, contained mostly single and, in two cases, double, inhuma- tions. Six women and three men (aged 25-50) can be identified from the skeletal remains. The tombs were poorly furnished with only a little jewellery (three rings and three silver and bronze earrings) and a whole pot used as a grave marker, plus a few sherds from the fill outside. These finds date to the 10th to the 11th century AD and have parallels at the extensive Byzantine cemetery found 3km away at the site of the regional refuse disposal facility at Karytiani.

Pliakou (12th EPCA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 544-45) continuing excavation of this settlement on the northern slopes of the Rachi hill, ca. 2km southeast from the modern lake shore. Settlement remains lay immediately beneath the surface in the southeastern part of the site and deeper to the northwest. A destruction deposit covered the entire area. The western limit of the site was established, the eastern almost so, but continued work is required to the north and south. Settlement developed as a dense concen- tration of houses and support areas arranged around an open area or square. In the eastern part, a narrow lane running east-west was defined by the exterior walls of the buildings on each side of it. 135. Korytiani: Roman bath with earlier, Hellenistic, buildings. South of this lane was a complex of 14 rooms from which a thick layer of tile was removed and the area cleaned (Fig. 136). The rooms were irregularly arranged and tightly concentrated, making it hard to distinguish individual buildings which shared walls. To one house probably belonged the central room 12 with a hearth and the secondary areas 1, 8 and 9 to the south, 5 and 13 to the north and 4 to the west. Rooms 2 and 3 furthest to the west probably form a later addition used as a storeroom for pithoi. To the north, rooms 5 and 13 were also adjunct areas with large quantities of tableware. In the southwest corner of room 1 were 22 loomweights. Four coin finds date the use of the complex from the last quarter of the fourth century to the first half of the second. A second house immediately to the east had area 10 at its centre, with the smaller rooms 6 and 7 to the south, 11 to the west and one further room to the east. Only the northwest corner of a third house was exposed. North of the lane and the buildings so far described, lay the fragmentary remains of the eastern part of a house with two rooms. The building was likely destroyed and the debris removed since so little survives in the area. The western part of the settlement consists of a 12m x 12m open square, bounded by a double wall to the north (and probably also to the south). A layer of fallen tile along the east side likely comes from rooms 2 and 3: these are stamped with dolphins or baetyls and Y.XA, MH, AM and other combinations. Facing the square at the west are two large rooms (16 and 17) with at least two building phases. Room 16 has a wide entrance to the square and, inside, two successive destruction deposits: a terminus ante quern for the first building phase is provided by black-glazed pottery of the second half of the fourth century and a post-mortem Macedonian coin of Alexander the Great. Room 17 does not communicate with the square: it was originally part of room 16 but was later separated. To the west are substantial retaining walls. Portable finds include, in addition to black-glazed pottery and coins, two figurine fragments, an iron door key and a bronze pin.</page><page sequence="125">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 125 136.

Makednoi, Krepeni Mavrochoriou (Gkiole). Ch. Tsoungaris reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 810) on the opening of more than 20 test trenches on the Koumbouri property, southwest of the early Early Iron Age cemetery. A folded bronze Macedonian shield was discovered (the third shield of this type discovered in Macedonia, after those at Vegora and Dion). Unfolding and cleaning revealed an inscription which the excavator restores as Au[5coAeov]To$: the inscription names the king of Paeonia from 315-310 BC to 284-282 BC (Ch. Tsoungaris, Kepimxticx OiXias vol. 2, 579-89). In the south and west of the property, where many fragments of Hellenistic or Roman tile are found, lay the rubble foundations of two buildings of unknown date. One of these was under the Christian pit graves excavated in 1999. I. Sverkos publishes ( Kepuana OiXias vol. 2, 113- 19) an inscribed grave stele dated to the second half of the fifth century BC from Krepeni Mavrochoriou, which bears the name EENAP[XOY]. Kastoria, Psalida. Ch. Tsoungaris reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 809) on the fourth campaign of excavation within the Sanctuary of Zeus, Hera and Hermes. Attention focused on analysis of spoil from the initial excavation of the sanctuary. A limestone relief depicting an eagle (the third relief found with this subject and the seventh related to the cult of Zeus) and Early Hellenistic to Roman bronze and silver coins were recovered. Excavation revealed Early Helladic to Late Helladic pottery, flint flakes, a grinder and animal bones. Kastoria, medrese. K. Drosou (11th EBA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 827) on the registration of this monument within the National Network of Cultural Cities, with the intention that, after restoration, it should house the tradi- tional music workshop of the Centre for Byzantine Arts. The building was constructed under Ottoman rule in the mid 18th century and restored in 1897. It ceased to be a theological school at the beginning of the 20th century, and was then used as a caravanserai for the salt trade. It belongs to the type of medrese with an interior peristyle court surrounded on three sides by a vaulted portico (, revak ). Fourteen rooms surround the court, with a total area of 804m2; its eastern boundary is the Byzantine rampart of Kastoria. Akrites, Alevitsa Kalivrysis. Ch. Tsoungaris reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 810-11; see previously ADelt 54 [1999] Chr , 657) on excavation at a site where a chance discovery of a bronze figurine was made in 1999. This revealed ceramic, metal and stone finds principally of the seventh to sixth century BC, but no structures with the exception of two pithoi and a clay hearth. The identifi- cation of an observation post or a hilltop sanctuary as that at Psalida cannot therefore be confirmed. Nomos of Florina (29th EPCA: 16th EBA) Melite. E. Psarra (17th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 808-09) the discovery of a built wine press. This consists of two parallel walls forming an apse to the north, an internal partition and a channel linked to a pithos outside the building. Pithoi and domestic pottery date the press to the Late Roman period. Amyntaio, Agios Panteleimonas. P. Chrysostomou (17th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 804-06) on continuing research at this prehistoric settlement, ca. 3km from Lake Petra. The site was occupied for some 5,300 years, from the Neolithic to the Early Helladic, covering an area between 0.2ha and 0.7ha according to period. The Early Neolithic is represented by an oval clay structure and by a fill containing much pottery (mostly red burnished with several examples of white-on-red). No traces of Middle Neolithic (5800-5300 BC) construction have been found within the settlement area, and occupation of this period is attested only by scattered sherds, some rows of stones and stone mounds. Stone and bone tools, terracotta figurines and small objects have also been found in fill. During the Late Neolithic (5300-4500 BC), the presence of cuttings, trenches and tombs indicates a different use of the space. An elongated trench is identified as a water channel taking rain-water to the lake. Seven pit tombs (three adults, three children and a baby) belong to the last phase of occupation. Levels of this period contain a significant quantity of pottery, terracotta figurines, chipped and polished stone tools, spindle- whorls and numerous faunal remains. The Early Helladic (3300-1900 BC) is represented by a major destruction layer covering the entire site, containing ash, sherds, stones and whole vases containing carbonized grain, as well as masses of clay with the imprint of organic materials from the elevations of buildings. Vegora, Tsairia Ekklisias. E. Psarra reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 806-08) on excavation on the plain south of the village of Vegora and on the plateau. On the plain, a Roman to Late Roman building reported in 1979 was excavated (cf. BCH 112 [1988], 649). This is a long building with two strong external walls and foundations of worked blocks joined with mortar. The interior was divided into two by a less carefully built partition wall: to the north bases for five pithoi were found in situ with many pithos sherds, and in the south were eight pithoi in situ (Fig. 137). Five rectangular structures 2m apart and in contact with the central wall, of small stones</page><page sequence="127">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 127 and tile fragments covered in mortar, were used for some production purpose. Immediately to the north, an earlier (but also Roman) phase of the building was exposed; here too a pithos was found. Domestic pottery and many coins date the occupation of the building to the second to third century AD. Iron nails, pieces of millstone, loomweights and other objects indicate workshop and storage areas, and the processing of foodstuffs. Exploration on the hill revealed a fortification which may be part of the Hellenistic circuit. Nomos of Kozani and Grevena (30th EPCA: 17th EBA) See AGOnline for new accessions in Kozani Museum. Kastri Polyneriou, Alatopetras. S. Drougou and collab- orators (Aristotelian University, Thessaloniki) publish two synthetic accounts of 10 years of research at Polyneri (S. Drougou and Ch. Kallini, Egnatia 13 [2009], 231-35; S. Drougou, Ch. Kallini and L. Trakatelli, AEMTh 20thAnniversary, 75-82). Aiani, Church of the Panagia. A. Tsilipakou (11th EBA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 848-50) on excavation at several locations inside and outside the church in the context of restoration of the church and especially the south tribelon. In the exonarthex, fragments of the foundations of the south and west walls (of limestone blocks), and of the related floor, belong to a 16th-century building phase. The exonarthex communicated with the narthex via the same doorways used in later times: their thresholds (limestone blocks) were found at a level lower than their later counterparts. The exonarthex was destroyed by fire, after which the area was occupied by tombs and ossuaries (one cist tomb and 10 reburials are noted). West of the north threshold is a section of an older (Byzantine?) floor of compacted earth and trimmed tile. In the narthex, excavation in 1997 close to the northeast corner, by the tribelon , revealed limestone slabs of the first (Byzantine?) phase and a pillar from the phase when the church was covered by a dome. Inside the church, the west base of the south tribelon was exposed, with architectural members but no evidence of a floor. A trench opened in 1997 in the choir, south of 137. Vegora, Tsairia Ekklisias: storage area of Roman building complex with pithos burials in situ. the altar, revealed the end of the bench in the apse, as well as a floor of compacted soil and trimmed tile similar to that in the exonarthex. Outside the church, to the south, a limestone wall lm from the exonarthex corresponds to the remains of the didakterion which was in use until the beginning of the 20th century. To the east of this wall were ossuaries, a cist grave and six pit graves. Immediately south of the tribelon, under the paved floor, a rectangular structure by the side of the south wall likely belongs to a chapel: inside was a cist grave, ossuaries, post-Byzantine glazed and domestic pottery, and an Ottoman coin. North of the church were six cist graves and four ossuaries. Publication: G. Karamitrou-Mendesidi, Aiani: Archaeological Sites and the Museum (Kozani 2008, English and Greek editions). Trigoniko, Church of the Dormition of the Virgin. A. Tsilipakou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 850-51) on excavation inside and outside the church conducted in connection with a restoration programme which included the conservation of the 16th-century wall-paintings. The aim was to expose and restore the original floor. The post-Byzantine church is a remodelling of a single-aisled Byzantine church which is itself founded on the central aisle of an Early Byzantine basilica built on Hellenistic levels. Parts of the south wall and of the west wall of the south aisle of the basilica were revealed, as well as the entire north wall. Inside the north aisle, close to the choir, were eight tombs comprising five pit graves of babies, young children and adults, and three cist graves. These tombs produced six Early Byzantine bronze coins. Haliakmon. A. Chondrogianni-Metoki (17th EPCA) presents ( AEMTh 20th Anniversary , 449-62; cf BCH 124 [2000], 900) a synthetic account of the results of rescue excavation conducted from 1985-2005 on sites threatened by the Polyphytos reservoir, in a region occupied at least since the Early Neolithic. Paliambela Roditi. A. Chondrogianni-Metoki reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 800-02) on rescue excavation after illegal excavation within the prehistoric settlement at Paliambela Roditi. Surface finds on a low toumba on the northern edge of the valley of the middle stream of the Aliakmon indicate a settlement of ca. 3ha. Soil from illegal earthmoving by the landowner was sieved, and trenches were opened within one room of the planned building and at the entry of the proposed underground car park. The first trench revealed several structures (with three construction phases recog- nizable): in particular, three round floors (1.6-1. 7m in diameter) bounded by postholes, as well as other struc- tures associated with postholes. In the southeast, a pit contained a stone pile mixed with burnt earth, ash and much pottery; a second pit contained the burial of a baby in contracted position accompanied by an astragalos (an important find given the small number of Early Neolithic tombs known). The second trench produced only a few portable finds. The pottery indicates occupation during the earlier phases of the Early Neolithic and especially in the Proto- Sesklo phase.</page><page sequence="128">128 DOMINIQUE MULLIEZ Paliokastania. A. Chondrogianni-Metoki reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 802-04) on rescue excavation of an Early Iron Age settlement and Byzantine cemetery close to the Polyphytos reservoir. In the Early Iron Age settlement, a plan was made of the area where 22 pithoi were found in situ : these were set in pits and organized in two groups which defined two large storage areas. One of these areas (5m2) had six pithoi plus a finer vessel, and a structure identified as a small oven. Pithos lids and millstones were found within the stone mounds cleared at several points (which represent collapsed buildings). The pottery shows little variety, and represents a short occupation during the Protogeometric period. The two groups of Protogeometric tombs excavated at Kolitsaki in 1985 may relate to this settlement. The Byzantine cemetery consists of 17 cist tombs on the same orientation and arranged in parallel rows. The cover slabs were intact. Only one was excavated to confirm the date: it contained the burial of a woman with bronze earrings. Eratyra. A. Petkos (Director, 11th EBA) and K. Drosou (11th EBA) report (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 828-30) on archaeological and architectural study of three churches. Church of the Panagia. This is a three-aisled basilica with a large narthex-gynaikonitis at the west, an added dome and a pitched wooden roof. The wall-paintings and the construction itself are dated by an inscription to 1763. The carved wooden templon, showing notable western influences, dates to the last quarter of the 18th century. Church of Agios Nikolaos: This is a single-aisled church with a large narthex-gynaikonitis, a projecting apse and a triple-pitched wooden roof with skylights. The wall- paintings date to 1763. Church of Agios Georgios (19th century). A study for the restoration of the wall-paintings is noted. Sisanio. A. Petkos and K. Drosou report (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 830; cf BCH 127 [2003], 928 on the 1997 excavation) the completion of an archaeological and archi- tectural study of the Middle Byzantine church of Sisanio, which was among the great episcopal churches of Macedonia in the 11th century. TTie church has painted decoration of the second half of the 11th century in the choir and the prothesis , while the decoration of the central and lateral aisles, the narthex and the west faces of the pillars of the choir date to the 13th century.

Paisidou (then 11th EBA, now Director, 9th EBA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 846-47) that rescue excavation 2km south of the road between Xiphiani and Aridaia revealed part of a cemetery with 45 tombs of the fourth century BC. The majority were tile graves or brick-built cists. Among the finds are bronze coins (Charon's obol), dating to the reigns of Maximian and of Galerian, and vases - evidence of the persistence of Pagan rites. An agricultural facility with four pithoi in situ was found near to the cemetery. Almopia. A. Chrysostomou (17th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 814-15) the results of prospection in the region of Almopia: the base of a statuette with the foot of a male figure from Apsalos (Toumba); Bronze Age occupation at Hexaplatanos; Byzantine bronze jewellery from graves at Thodoraki (Ag.

Edessa Ancient Edessa, acropolis. A. Chrysostomou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 775-80) the results of rescue excavations inside the acropolis (Fig. 138). 14-16 Argyriou-Kytanou Street (O.T. 136, Papazisi property) (Fig. 138:1). Nine Ottoman refuse pits were revealed following the demolition of two modern houses. Pits 2 and 3 (1.35m and 1.8m in diameter respectively) were holes for fixing ladders, while pit 4 (to the east of which is a Hellenistic level) contains stone blocks from an ancient wall. Many cuttings were revealed, some containing prehistoric material mixed with modern, and others Bronze Age and Early Iron Age pottery, and Classical pottery and two small silver coins of Aigai and Eion. Traces of wall define a probable semi-basement space which produced Hellenistic material (coins, lamps, terracotta figurines and metal items, West Slope pottery and pithoi). Archiereos Meletiou Street (O.T. 112, Doumtsi property) (Fig. 138:2). Excavation was pursued in the north of the plot, some distance from a ruined Ottoman house. The paved courtyard of that house was encountered in every trench, as were Ottoman foundations. Ottoman pottery and a hoard of silver Spanish and Ottoman coins were recovered (Fig. 139). Ottoman refuse pits disturbed earlier levels. Nonetheless, two post-Byzantine walls were found, as well as the plan of a room with which a clay floor is associated; the same floor is also found outside, indicating the presence of a second room. Pottery inside the room dates to the Hellenistic and Early Byzantine periods, but the discovery of Early Byzantine pottery in a sondage beneath the wall provides a terminus post quern for the construction. Megalou Alexandrou Street (O.T. 112, Pouphli brothers property) (Fig. 138:3). Following the demolition of an Ottoman house, three trenches were opened. Trench E contained several pits, both ancient and modern, of uncertain function (perhaps storage or basement space). Trench Zt contained two pithoi, probably from a store-room now lost, and, in a deeper level, a building defined by three walls of river pebbles and associated with Bronze Age and Early Iron Age pottery. Trench Z contained modern constructions only, but portable finds in all three trenches comprise coins, pottery, iron tools, bronze items, and bone and bronze jewellery of the Hellenistic to modern period. Ancient Edessa. A. Chrysostomou presents ( AEMTh 20th Anniversary , 463-76) a synthetic account of Neolithic to Early Byzantine occupation at Edessa. Finds from recent rescue excavations in and beyond the ancient city not previously reported include the following. Built cist tombs of the fourth century BC from the south cemetery were excavated in 2002 and 2003 (noting that graves excavated up to 2000 were chamber tombs and rock-cut cists). Sections of carriage roads identified on the Kartsoli property (excavated in 2005) were very close to the line of the via Egnatia. 139. Edessa, Archiereos Meletiou Street: coin hoard. In the Kleisochori property, a large building, probably an Early Byzantine basilica, was found during work by the water company in 2003. Edessa, Palia Mitropoli. A. Petkos reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 827) a study of this former episcopal church dedicated to Christ and the Wisdom and Word of God. Numerous repairs, additions and acts of remodelling have altered its original appearance. In the first phase (14th century), it was a three-aisled basilica with a raised central aisle, protruding apses and a narthex at the west. The original decoration, dating to 1380, is visible in the choir, and on the colonnade, arches and pillars. Seventeenth- century additions are visible in the upper registers in the choir. On the wooden templon (carved in the mid 18th century) are icons by Apostolis Vodeniotis (1761). Edessa, Longos. M. Paisidou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 827) a study for the restoration and presentation of the floor mosaic of the Early Byzantine basilica. The floor mosaic of the choir, the marble veneer and the floor mosaic of the central aisle beneath the paving of the second building phase (probably sixth-century AD) were exposed. Edessa, region. A. Chrysostomou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 813-14) the results of prospection: surface pottery indicating prehistoric settlement near Vryta; Late Roman architectural members and part of a bath from Klisochori (now in store at Longo); Bronze Age sherds northwest of Loutrochori; 16 burial tumuli (all looted) at Prophitis Ilias, plus a peribolos and a stone vaulted structure; many Roman tombs (dated by a Roman silver coin) on the road from the Sotira quarry to Edessa; Early Byzantine to post-Byzantine surface sherds south of the hill of Sotira and, to the northeast, at Toupoles, Early Byzantine remains and a cemetery. Meniida Prophitis Ilias, Agriokarydia. P. Chrysostomou (17th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 765-68; cf. BCH 125 [2001], 934; AEMTh 14 [2000], 455-71) the discovery of a Roman funerary shrine and cemetery. A mystery cult is attested by an inscribed stone base for a statue of the priest Makki and the mystai found in the area, and was probably linked to a thiasos of Dionysos. A third- century BC naiskos (10m x 5m) has a north entrance and a chthonic altar (Fig. 140).</page><page sequence="130">130 DOMINIQUE MULLIEZ 140. Meniida: plan of the shrine and cemetery. Northwest of the naiskos was a potter's kiln, and, within a peribolos to the west, three intact monumental marble cist tombs (of a man and two women) and the brick-built cist grave of a child. The female burial in tomb A probably gave rise to the shrine; both women in tombs A and B were buried with glass vessels and rich gold and silver jewellery. South of the naiskos were 25 intact pit and cist graves, inhumations and cremations: grave goods (including gold jewellery, pots and glass vessels, and bronze coins) date after the beginning of the third century AD. Kali. P. Chrysostomou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 768-69) excavation of tombs in an area where part of the city wall, architectural remains and prehistoric and later pottery were previously found. Looted stone cist tombs were found in the north-north- western foothills of the hill of Meniida. Further such tombs lay 500m southeast of the hill. On a plateau of the hill were three rural buildings plus Early Iron Age tomb groups, most of which had been looted (one tumulus is preserved). Approximately 1.5km northwest of the hill (on the Kanaki property) were four large Early Iron Age burial tumuli. East of the Roman shrine at Prophitis Ilias, graves produced a Hellenistic kantharos and an Early Iron Age bronze bracelet. Approximately 100m east of the hill of Meniida was a Late Byzantine house. Further architectural remains, some with millstones and loomweights, are noted at other locations around the hill, as are individual graves and Early Iron Age tumuli. Aravissos. P. Chrysostomou reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 774-75; cf. BCH 127 [2003], 932) the results of two trenches opened in the toumba. The disturbed upper levels produced Hellenistic and Roman material. Below this, Geometric (ninth- to seventh-century) material (notably pottery, bronze jewellery and ornaments) is found, especially in refuse pits (Fig. 141). Thick and important Early Helladic (3300-1900 BC) levels include refuse pits containing large quantities of pottery, animal bones, stone and bone tools, and small objects, as well as the destruction deposit from a semi- basement house of unknown plan. South of this house, Final Neolithic levels (4500-3000 BC) include pieces of fired clay (from walls), plus sherds. TTie plan of a house destroyed by fire is identifed. Nea Pella. A. Petkos reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 846; cf. BCH 124 [2000], 921) research on the Early Byzantine basilica. Research concentrated on the narthex and exonarthex, as well as the north aisle.

The north door remained in use throughout the life of the church, while the south was blocked at a later date and stairs leading to the gallery were installed in front of it. In the north aisle, marble architectural members were discovered beneath the destruction deposit. The north stylobate was discovered, and, close by, another stylobate from a second construction phase. A mosaic floor with geometric motifs covered the entire aisle and several fragments of wall-painting with marbling were found. Pella Palaestra (building V). P. Chrysostomou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 764-65) the removal of the destruction deposit containing the debris of the Laconian-tiled roof which revealed the following. In the epistasion, the mosaic floor was fully exposed; a hole into a small water channel facilitated the drainage of water during cleaning. In the northeast corner of the room, the mosaic floor was framed by a stone block (another in the northwest was robbed out). The fill contained a tile stamped with the name BAZIAIK02, black and brown tesserae, and Hellenistic and Ottoman pottery, as well as iron nails and two Hellenistic bronze coins. In the western part of the ephebeion, finds include Hellenistic and Ottoman pottery, nails and an iron key of 'Homeric' type. In a room west of the epistasion, identified as the aleipterion, finds comprise Hellenistic and Ottoman pottery, an iron knife and four iron nails. Northwest cemetery. P. Chrysostomou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 765) the discovery of a cist tomb (2.05m x 0.92m) ca. 45m south of the road from Xiri Gephyra to Nea Pella and 45m west of the west hill of Pella and its fortification. The tomb had been looted and filled. The cover slabs rested in a cutting around the top of the walls, and small cuttings were also made for the feet of the funerary kline. Fragments of two unguentaria, a shell and a small bronze mirror date the burial (of a woman) to the third century BC. This is the first tomb of the northwest cemetery to be excavated, although a number of grave stelae have been found by chance in the area.

Koukouvou (17th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 786-87) excavation on a hill southeast of Vermion, in an area where remains of construction over ca. lha indicate prehistoric to Byzantine occupation. Remains of Early Iron Age rubble construction and sections of floor, as well as four Early Iron Age tombs, were found close to a water course. One of the women buried was adorned with elaborate bronze bracelets. A group of 11 tombs of the early fifth to mid third century BC contained pottery, bronze coins, strigils, iron weapons in male graves and bronze jewellery for women. 142. Asomata: potter's kiln with eschara preserved. A building of the second half of the fourth century BC, with a round hearth, an oven and fragments of millstone, must have been used for food production. Close by was a workshop with several phases of construction, and the eschara of a rectangular potter's kiln (2m x 3m) probably used for firing tiles (Fig. 142). Finds around the kiln indicate a date between the end of the Hellenistic period and the first century AD. Mavromouria. A. Tsilipakou (11th EBA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 845-46) on excavation undertaken for the construction of the Egnatia Odos in the section between Leukopetra, Veroia and Kouloura. South of the post-Byzantine church of Ag. Athanasios, excavation revealed foundations in rubble and limestone blocks, and sections of water channel with schist cover slabs, associated with Ottoman pottery and three bronze coins (one Byzantine). Remains of a two-roomed house with rubble walls were also revealed. A hearth was identified, but no floor. Finds include two Genoese bronze coins, Ottoman pottery (including an intact 15th- to 16th- century cup) and metal items. Trilophos (Andreadis property, plot no. 659). A. Koukouvou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 787) the discovery of the remains of a three-aisled basilica with a narthex (18.5m x 13.5m excluding the apse). South of the apse were eight cist tombs, some containing grave goods (bronze rings, glass and bracelets). Veroia Corner of 24 Kleonos and Ant. Kemintz6 Streets (O.T. 463, Yphantidi property). A. Koukouvou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 784-85) the discovery of four intact rock- cut chamber tombs belonging to the west cemetery, where several such tombs have previously been found. Tombs I- III are oriented north-south and tomb IV east-west. Tomb I had a northern entrance, walls coated in white mortar, a FT -shaped bench and a rectangular pit on the west side. Tomb II had a southern entrance flanked by monolithic soft limestone dooijambs. It contained a TT- shaped bench and an ossuary in the southeast corner holding bone and pottery. Tomb III had a southern entrance flanked by monolithic soft limestone doorjambs coated in mortar. Between a bench at the east and the south walls, two steps served to receive offerings. Tomb IV is smaller and less carefully constructed.</page><page sequence="132">132 DOMINIQUE MULLIEZ Grave goods comprise some 170 objects, including vases (Macedonian amphorae, unguentaria, skyphoi, pyxides, lamps, etc.) and metal items (strigils, needles, iron tools and gold earrings), which date the tombs to the third to second century BC. 26 Megalou Alexandrou Street (O.T. 149, Tsanaktsidi AEEE property). A. Koukouvou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 785-86) the discovery of remains of a large building connected with the neighbouring agora. Two parallel walls were preserved to two courses high and lengths of 5.5m and 3m (they continue beyond the plot). A section of water channel lay between them. Finds comprise Hellenistic sherds and 26 bronze coins, all but one (attributed to Demetrios Poliorcetes) in poor condition. Vergina, ancient Aigai Archaic cemetery. A. Kottaridi publishes ( AEMTh 20th Anniversary , 143-53) a synthetic account of research in the Archaic cemetery (which includes ca. 80 tombs) and of the royal tombs. City. S. Drougou (Aristotelian University, Thessaloniki) reports on excavations in 2008-2009 C Egnatia 13 [2009], 227-30). On the Tsakiridis property, in the centre of the ancient city, east of the Sanctuary of Eukleia and northeast of the palace, excavation in three sectors, north, east and west, revealed architectural remains of the first century BC to the first century AD. In the northern sector, the limestone columns noted in 2007 were re-used as water channels or open conduits (they were associated with fragments of tile with hydraulic mortar). These conduits crossed a street or open space. Pottery dates from the first century BC to the first century AD. A complex of rooms of the same period was found in the eastern sector. The walls were of brick on a stone socle which included re-used worked blocks. While the function of the complex is not known, the finds, which include glass implements, burnt glass (vases and pieces of paste), as well as slag, indicate a workshop. In the western sector were found the strong founda- tions of a retaining wall 20m long. No construction was found north of this wall, although some structures were identified to the south. There are very few portable finds from this area. S. Drougou publishes (Egnatia 13 [2009], 121-32) a study of the decline of Aigai after the fall of the Macedonian kingdom. The later town was unfortified and partially ruined, but remained occupied, as is clear from discoveries in the Tsakiridis property which indicate activity into the first century AD. Two further publications are noted. Ch.

The remains of a workshop were found (part of a pink clay floor and the lower part of a potter's kiln). The kiln is round (2.1m interior diameter) and preserved to a height of 1.12m; rather than an eschara , the firing chamber contained a bench on which the pots were set. Pottery recovered around the kiln (lamps and unguentaria) date it to the second half of the second century BC. Evropos. T. Savvopoulou (16th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 723, also 727 on recent work to present the archaeological site) the discovery of 61 tombs in the course of laying water-pipes. Forty three pit graves, 15 tile graves and three severely damaged graves were found, on several levels. The few grave goods recovered consist mainly of black-glazed pottery and Hellenistic bronze coins.

Drymos (Kanaki property). A. Keramaris (16th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000], Chr , 684-86) on excavation in the cemetery. Fifty tombs were found, mostly inhumations (but with eight cremations). Pit graves are most common, with 27 examples among which several types can be distinguished: eight rectangular pits without covers, containing grave goods (domestic and red-slipped pottery, bronze jewellery, bronze coins and fragments of gold sheet perhaps from the epistomion) of the Hellenistic period; eight rectangular pits covered with a schist slab and containing Hellenistic pottery; eight rectangular pits covered with a schist slab arranged within an original larger pit, of which six contain Hellenistic and Roman grave goods (pottery, gold and</page><page sequence="133">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 133 bronze jewellery, and bronze coins); and three rectangular pits with several cover slabs, two of which contained grave goods (gold and bronze jewellery). Seven Archaic cist tombs built of schist slabs contained pottery, gold epistomia , bronze jewellery and iron objects. Six Hellenistic to Roman tile graves contained pottery, gold and bronze jewellery, bronze coins and glass. Two probable storage pits and a cutting which predate the cemetery are probably to be associated with an Early Iron Age or early Archaic settlement. Nea Philadelphia. V. Misailidou-Despotidou (16th EPCA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 689-91; cf. BCH 124 [2000], 924) the discovery of further remains of a small Geometric settlement during the construction of a railway line close to the Gallikos river (Fig. 143). In the northern section, the one-roomed building 6 is a mud-brick construction on a rubble socle, with a beaten- earth floor: fragments of mud-brick were found inside. In the northwest corner is an oven or hearth with a handmade cup beside it (the only object found inside the building). Southeast of the building, at the same elevation, are three probable retaining walls. In the southern sector a complex of six rooms is defined by rubble walls. Three construction phases are identified. Rooms 1-5 were aligned to the south of a retaining wall; room 6 lies in front of room 2. Rooms 1 and 2 have stone paved floors: room 2 has two floor levels separated by a destruction deposit rich in pottery and burnt brick from the walls of the previous phase (phase 2, destroyed by fire). The north retaining wall, at the level of room 2, is founded in this destruction deposit and thus falls within the succeeding phase (1). The destruction deposit is also present in the other rooms. In room 3, the north wall forms a rectangular niche in which three vases were found in situ. In room 4, the destruction deposit was thicker and included 12 storage vessels and dining utensils (Fig. 144). The presence of mud-brick under the foundation of the west wall in room 4 confirms the nature of the structure in phase 2, while traces of a wall forming an angle under the floor belonging to phase 2 belong to a smaller structure of the oldest phase, 3. Northwest of this building, an extensive stone mound (11m x 19m) may indicate a destroyed building (no trace of walls has been found). Polichni (Pouliopoulos property). A. Lioutas (16th EPCA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 683) the discovery of four Hellenistic cist tombs covered with schist slabs.

Thessaloniki, upper city. E. Marki (9th EBA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 739-42) the Byzantine remains from rescue excavations in a number of locations. 7 Glafkou Street. The remains of six building phases from Early Byzantine to modern are noted. The oldest phases produced traces of walls of stone, brick and hydraulic mortar, and two walls of a workshop with an associated water channel. The fourth phase is represented by 16 Late Byzantine tombs, comprising 10 simple inhumations, a built tomb of a child and five built cists. Grave goods consist of glazed-ware cups. Remains of rough walls and a brick-paved floor date to the Ottoman period, while a bath (hamam) of the end of the Ottoman period was transformed into a house. 5 Kraterou Street. A Roman to Early Byzantine house with three construction phases has been identified. A party wall between two houses of the Roman, Early Byzantine and then Byzantine period was constructed during the first, Imperial Roman, phase. Related to it are sections of water channels. A tank from a workshop was installed during the Early Byzantine period in the area of a probable courtyard; this was used as a rubbish pit in the Ottoman period. Two Late Roman to Early Byzantine walls likely belong to the same construction phase. Part of a water conduit discovered close by dates to the end of the Early Byzantine period. 155 Agiou Dimitriou Street. Noted here are the remains of modern water channels, the wall of a modern building with domestic pottery, Ottoman glazed ware and three coins, and the remains of a potter's kiln and workshop. 1A Epimenidou Street. A large Early Byzantine cistern with three water channels is reported. Three of its walls (1.2-1. 5m deep) are preserved and lined with many layers of hydraulic mortar; the floor is of brick. During the Byzantine period the walls were reinforced with buttresses on the exterior and three relieving arches on the interior. 18 Sophokleous Street. N. Karydas (9th EBA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 748-50; cf. AEMTh 14 [2000], 259-69; BCH 125 [2001], 940) the completion of excavation of a large part of a Roman to Byzantine house, more of which has already been revealed in neighbouring plots (Fig. 145). In particular, the main reception hall was revealed (8.5m x 5.15m), with a polychrome floor mosaic with geometric decoration, which is described in detail. Many fragments of wall-painting were recovered from this room. A service room to the north shows nine phases of wall repair dating from the Roman to the Middle Byzantine period. A Middle Byzantine apsidal structure, founded on bedrock, was cleared, having previously been partially revealed in the neighbouring plot (Sophokleous 20). 97 Olympou Street. E. Marki reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 747) the results of rescue excavation. Three occupation phases are identified. Three earthen walls, 0.5m high, date to the Roman period. An east-west wall associated with a fragment of floor mosaic dates to the early fourth century AD. Three rubble walls belong to a bath complex previously discovered at the corner of Olympou and Platonos Streets in 1969. The building was destroyed at the end of the Early Byzantine period (seventh century AD). Thessaloniki, west cemetery. E. Marki and E. Doulgeri (9th EBA) present (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 743-47, 751-54; cf.

The laying of water-pipes along Nestoros Street revealed successive cist tombs and vaulted tombs, and, at the junction with Ag. Dimitrios Street, part of the monumental landscaping of the Letaia Gate. 24 Agion Panton. Twenty four fourth-century AD tombs, with fill dumped into them, comprise nine vaulted tombs, 13 cists and two tile graves. Three of the vaulted tombs were accessed via a paved path and another via stone steps: four preserved a mortar head-rest. The few grave goods recovered consist of bronze coins, a bone box lid, an iron pin and gold thread. The cist tombs produced bronze coins and pins, and pottery and glass unguentaria. The tile tombs contain child burials, one accompanied by an amphoriskos. 53-55 Apolloniados Street. Twenty six built cist tombs and two vaulted tombs laid out in groups, plus one Ottoman grave were identified. The tombs share party walls and are mostly oriented east-west: all have been looted and filled. The very few grave goods that survive comprise bronze coins, a bronze ring, an unguentarium, a fibula and a piece of bronze decoration. 3 Peleiadou Street. Twenty two tombs, grouped and single, comprise five tile graves, three pit, four cists and 10 vaulted tombs (two separate, one double and two groups of two and four chambers respectively) (Fig. 146). The tombs had been filled in and very little material was recovered (mainly jewellery and bronze utensils). One of the group of four-vaulted tombs was used as an ossuary and contained 26 crania. The double-vaulted tomb is of interest for its flat vault and offering table. The emsemble dates to the fourth to fifth century AD, but the tombs had a long period of use, as indicated by the reburials. Ambelokipi, 11 Sokratous Street. An orthogonal Early Byzantine cistern with two water channels was found, plus 22 third- to fifth-century AD tombs, comprising 12 tile graves, seven pit graves, two simple inhumations and an enchytrismos. The only offering is a bronze coin of the late third to early fifth century AD. Two intact stelae, plus further fragments, date to the third century AD. 145.

The second level contained pit graves and built cists of the fourth to fifth century AD. The upper level contained four tile graves, two built cists, two enchytrismoi , five simple inhumations and a pit with a schist cover slab. These tombs may be dated by a coin of Justinian. 10 Pargas Street. Noted here are a subterranean Byzantine cistern and a well, plus a funerary enclosure around a vaulted double tomb with lime mortar coating the interior walls. Thessaloniki, water company works. N. Karydas and E. Marki report ( AEMTh 20th Anniversary, 127-41, 205-19) the discovery of a number of Early Byzantine houses in the course of work on the city's water supply in 2000-2002. Corner of Agiou Dimitriou and Pasteur Streets. The northern part of an apse and the east wall of its side chamber, lm deep, in opus mixtum were found. No floor was preserved; finds indicate Early Byzantine occupation. Corner of Olympiados and Agias Sophias Streets. The southern part of the apse of the triclinium and part of the long hall south of it, and an entrance marked by a threshold at the west were located. The apse floor was mosaic and non-decorative, and the wall-plaster has painted marble decoration. The mosaic floor to the south had geometric decoration. Finds date from the late fourth to early fifth century AD. Agiou Dimitriou Street (between Photakou and Apostolou Pavlou Streets). Part of an apse oriented to the north and associated with a mosaic floor was identified. Toumba. S. Andreou (Aristotelian University, Thessaloniki) reports on the 2009 campaign which focused on the Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age transition and on building complexes B and E, at the east end of the summit (Fig. 147). Fill of phase IV, characterized by the presence of LHIIIC pottery, was excavated in complex E. Floors in this complex were carefully cleaned and frequently renewed. In room E3, a round silo (1.2m in diameter), accessed from a brick platform, had clays walls preserved to 0.3-0.4m above the floor. Hearths and ovens were found in three other rooms. Micromorphological analysis revealed in another room a fill rich in white plant matter arranged cross-wise, from a carpet laid on the floor. In street X3, between complexes E and B, were the burials of three individuals (an adult, a child and a baby) (Fig. 148). Excavation revealed that at the start of phase III (end of the 12th to the early 11th century) the northern part of complex B was filled with the local red-clay soil (the material which must have been used for floors and brick production). Slightly later in the main phase, an abandoned room in this complex and part of the road immediately to the north were used for the burial of four individuals (a man, two children and a baby). Another room in the same building was used for purple dye production, noting the abundance of murex fragments on the floor, a cooking vessel and grindstones to break the shells.</page><page sequence="137">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 137 147. Toumba Thessalonikis: plan of the Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age settlement. During phase IV (12th century), two rooms in the building B, B1 and B2-3, contained at least three pithoi in situ, used throughout the period. Many pithos fragments were found in two other rooms in the southern part of the building (one of which had a tiled floor). The discovery of six tombs gave rise to re-examination of burial within the settlement. Since 1993, 11 burials have been found in situ, while six further burials are recog- nized in the scattered bone material (probably destroyed by later occupation). Most tombs date to the end of phase IV and the start of III, i.e. the period of 20-30 years between the end of the 12th century and the beginning of the 11th. Some of the destroyed burials in building A predate phase IV, i.e. date to the early 12th century. All the rooms used for burials had been abandoned temporarily, and then filled before reoccupation. Of the burials found in situ, eight were children inhumed in shallow pits with no consistent orientation or arrangement (although the arrangement of the body or the hands may have varied according to sex). Age played a role in the burial rite, as shown by the presence of grave goods found only in the graves of adults or youths (a tusk, a bone bead and pin, a spindle-whorl, a terracotta loomweight, two handmade vases and two Mycenaean amphoriskoi) (Fig. 149). Residue analysis of vases similar to these has shown that they probably contained oil-based substances, perhaps to anoint the deceased's body. 148.

Toumba Thessalonikis: handmade amphoriskos and Mycenaean amphoriskos from adult burials of the end of phase IV. Lagyna (ancient Liti). K. Tzanavari (then 16lh EPCA, now Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 686-89; also K. Tzanavari and K. Philis, AEMTh 20th Anniversary, 369-84) the discovery of four farmsteads in the territory of ancient Liti ( ca . 2km from the city) during the construction of the Egnatia Odos. Farmstead A covers 802.5m2. The roof has Laconian tiles and the walls, of alternate courses of rubble and brick, have revetment in crustae on the interior faces. Rooms are arranged around an internal court: residential areas are on the north side, whereas rooms devoted to production and storage are on the south. A vat for wine production, found in the southeast of the house, communicates with a pithos magazine (pitheonas) for wine storage. The court is entered from the east, with a secondary west street entrance for the transport of produce. A bakery area and a bread oven were found inside the court. A second storey is restored: annexe buildings were not excavated. The farm was built in the second century AD, abandoned in the mid third century (based on a hoard of 12 coins of Gordian III) and then remodelled with a triclinium at the end of the third century. It was finally abandoned in the late fourth or early fifth century. Finds include a large quantity of cooking, storage and tablewares, red-slip pottery (Eastern Sigillata B), lamps, several bronze coins, terracotta loomweights, jewellery, and tools and millstones for grinding cereals. Farmstead B, northeast of farmstead A, has two buildings preserved to foundation level, with a Laconian tiled roof. The first covers 460m2 and the second 68.5m2. A rectangular courtyard in the middle of the first building is defined to the east and west by two long rooms. Traces of painted wall-plaster in the west room indicate that it was part of the proprietor's residence. A large quantity of terra- cotta loomweights attests to textile production. Pottery places the occupation of the farm from the first century BC to the first century AD. Farmstead T, west of A and B, covers an area of 690m2. The walls are preserved to foundation level. The size and arrangement of the rooms indicate that they belong to the proprietor's residence. A southeast entrance leads to a court surrounded by five rooms: a second entrance at the east probably leads to a second courtyard also surrounded by rooms. A corridor extending to the east probably leads to the staircase to the upper floor. Pithoi in situ in the rooms south of the courtyard link these rooms to production and storage. The farm was built in the Hellenistic period and abandoned in the mid first century BC. At farmstead A, two buildings to the southwest of the other farms are annexes to a farm of which the central part has not been found. These are a triclinium (ca. 207.5m2) and a long building (150m2) with two rooms. Southeast of the triclinium was a burial of two horses; the grave of a further horse in the long building identifies the structure as a stable. Zooarchaeological analysis identifies two draught stallions and a war horse. Finds, including third to fourth- century terracotta lamps and fragments of figurines repre- senting the Mother of the Gods, date occupation between the mid third and late fourth century BC (Fig. 150). 150.

Of the total of 125 tombs discovered, 85 were pits with schist or soft limestone cover slabs (several being marked with a circle of small stones), 19 were cists, seven limestone sarcophagi, one a tile grave, one an enchytrismos and there were also seven cinerary urns (one bronze and the remainder pottery). Grave goods were plentiful, comprising local and imported pottery, gold, silver and bronze jewellery (earrings, rings, pins, epistomia , beads, circlets), bronze and iron weapons (spearheads and daggers), as well as terracotta figurines. On this basis, some of the tombs are dated to the end of the local Iron Age (sixth to fifth century BC) and others to the fourth or early third century BC.</page><page sequence="139">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 139 Mandritsa Street. E. Skarlatidou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 677-78, 679) the discovery of 45 tombs plus settlement remains during work on the water supply. The tombs include 20 pit graves, three clay-lined cists, five cists, 10 sarcophagi, three inurned cremations and one pit cremation. Only 40 tombs were excavated, as some continued beyond the plot. Attention is drawn to the male cist burial, T32, which has a white coating on the walls and a red band on the upper part of each face, while a similar red colour covers the lip of the walls and the floor of the tomb. The grave goods, which date from the last quarter of the sixth century to the end of the fifth, comprise gold, silver and bronze jewellery, pottery vessels, and bronze weapons and banquetting equipment. Only one pit grave dates to the Byzantine period. The clay-lined cist T39 contains a male burial with an Illyrian helmet and other arms, as well as Late Archaic Attic pottery. Tomb T16 contains the burial of woman, adorned and accompanied by an Attic red-figure vase and bronze banquetting equipment: this, and the male burials in the sarcophagi T19 and T 20 (with spearheads and rings), date to the fifth century. Some tombs were destroyed by a later water-supply system of which part was excavated. This conduit, which is probably Early Byzantine, had a cover which is not preserved. O.T. 58, plot 2918. V. Allamani (16th EPCA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000], 678-79) excavation in the west cemetery of Thermi (Toumba). One hundred and twenty four individual burials were found - 25 Archaic and Classical, nine post-Byzantine and 90 modern (early 20th century). Two tombs date to the end of the Archaic period, but the majority of ancient graves are fifth-century (with one early fourth-century). The current tomb types of the period are represented: 19 pits, two brick and clay -built tombs, a cist containing a child burial and four inurned cremations (vessels include an olpe, a phiale-like form and a chytra-like form with a lid). Most pits are relatively shallow, oval or rectangular, but some are large and rectangular, and sometimes defined with pebbles. Grave offerings mostly consist of Attic pottery (black-glazed kylikes, skyphoi, kotylae and an exaleiptron) and local domestic wares; the male burials contained weapons and the female bronze and silver jewellery (bracelets, rings, earrings, fibulae, etc.). Terracotta bird figurines were found in three graves of young girls. The nine post-Byzantine tombs are shallower pits containing green- and yellow-glazed pottery and a very few necklaces. The 90 modern tombs are shallow oval pits, mostly without grave goods. In some cases the deceased was accompanied by white-glazed or porcelain cups, a drinking glass and bronze jewellery. Sokratous Street (O.T. 44, Klarnetsi property). E. Skarlatidou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 680) the excavation of pits - 32 rectangular and 21 oval. The absence of bone and grave goods precludes their identifi- cation as child graves. Rather, the presence of stones, millstones and pithos fragments in some pits suggests manufacturing or storage. No date is suggested. A Late Roman cutting found on the neighbouring plot may perhaps relate to these structures. Thermi, cemetery. E. Skarlatidou presents (AEMTh 20th Anniversary, 329-43) a synthetic account of the cemetery, which is located southeast of Thermi. A total of 4,200 tombs have been excavated to 2006. The cemetery was used from the Early Iron Age (eighth to seventh century BC) until the first century AD, and then re-used for burials in the 16th to 17th and early 20th centuries. Inhumation is the principal form of burial, with some inurned cremations of the second half of the sixth and fifth centuries. The oldest tombs are pits covered with schist slabs, with several enchytrismoi also. Tombs of the Archaic period include pits, cists with walls of limestone (and sometimes schist) slabs on which a small heap of stones was placed to cover an opening at head level. Pit tombs lined with clay were used in the Late Archaic period and the fifth century. Burials in pithoi or smaller vessels are very rare, but cremation burials in bronze or pottery vessels (e.g. an Attic krater by Lydos of ca. 560 BC) are more common. During the fifth century, inhumations were made in pit and cist graves or in sarcophagi, while pit graves, usually delimited by a border of pebbles, were most popular in the Early Hellenistic period. Tile graves and pit cremations were used in the first century BC to the first century AD. The post-Byzantine tombs belonged to a Christian population inhumed in pit graves which maintained a strict east-west orientation. Several tombs had been opened in antiquity, but grave goods were nonetheless quite rich. There were numerous child graves. Women were adorned with gold, silver and bronze jewellery, and men buried with their weapons and occasionally jewellery. Bronze vessels were also found in male tombs, and female and animal figurines with children. Local pottery is more common than imports in early tombs, but there is an increase in imports (especially from Athens and Corinth) from the sixth century onwards. Classical tombs also contained silver and bronze jewellery, as well as imported and local pottery and bronze banquetting vessels; the deceased was accompanied by a bronze coin. The settlement at Thermi contracted after the synoikism of Thessaloniki, but did not disappear completely - indeed, several tombs date to the third to second century BC. The few first-century BC to first- century AD tombs relate to temporary settlement, albeit not on the main, trapeza, site. These graves contain unguentaria and, in the cremation pits, terracotta figurines. The post-Byzantine burials, accompanied by glazed pottery and bronze jewellery, also correspond to temporary occupation, as do the early 20th-century tombs. Nomos of Chalkidike (16th EPCA: 10th EBA) Potidaia (Kassandreia). V. Allamani reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 701-02) the results of rescue excavation. At the Chatzikondyli property, two Late Roman tile graves plus a round structure of unknown function were found. At the property of Karastergios and Co. (O.T. 102), an open-air manufacturing area of the Hellenistic period was located. Remains comprise the foundations of two walls, of which the central part of one is founded on an ash layer; a thick later of tile on both sides of a wall; under a destruction layer including second-century BC pottery is an area of grey-black clay interpreted as the floor of a kiln.</page><page sequence="140">140 DOMINIQUE MULLIEZ Kriaritsi Sykias. S. Asouchidou (16th EPCA) presents ( AEMTh 20th Anniversary, 41-50; ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 704-09; cf. BCH 127 [2003], 979) a synthetic account of research conducted on a Bronze Age settlement and fourth- to third-century BC agricultural installations since 1998. Site 1 has produced architectural remains of three prehistoric to Roman phases of occupation on the hill. A round Roman structure is reported, plus the foundations of a rectangular, two-roomed Early Helladic building from which pottery, loomweights, spindle-whorls and stone tools have been recovered. Site 2 has a square, well-built, one-roomed building which may have a paved floor. Inside are a hearth and a terracotta bathtub. Site 3 has a round structure (6-8m in diameter), a fine isodomic construction of granite blocks, with an associated curved wall. Finds from the interior, under a fire-destruction layer containing masonry from the wall and 22 16th- to 17th-century silver coins, include 17 fourth- century BC bronze coins, bronze and iron nails, many lead strips to repair pots, loomweights and millstones, as well as pottery linked to agricultural activity and black-glazed pottery indicating occupation in the late fourth and third century. This structure was in direct contact with a storeroom (a pitheonas) containing 22 pits to hold pithoi and a wine press (in granodiorite). The agricultural and commercial character of this building is emphasized, in contrast with the defensive nature of the round structure. Site 5 has three phases of occupation: a storeroom ( pitheonas ) with 15 pits to hold pithoi of the late fifth to late fourth century; a rectangular building of the early fourth to third century; and two later round structures. Site 7 is an Early Helladic tumulus containing 30 funerary periboloi covered with a stone mound. Cremation of adults and children was exclusively practised: most periboloi contained a single urn receptacle, a few contained two, and one receptacle held a double burial. The cremation urns were handmade vessels, closed with small open shapes; some small cups were given as offerings. Ierissos (ancient Akanthos). E. Trakosopoulou (16th EPCA) reports ( ADelt55 [2000] Chr, 709-11) on the 2000 season of excavation in the cemetery and settlement. Cemetery. Excavation of that part of the seaside cemetery on plot 95 (Toubeli property) was completed: 316 Archaic and Classical tombs were found over an area of 200m2 in nine successive levels. The majority were inhumations (cremations constituted 6.5% of the tombs excavated). Tombs were mostly pit graves (129) and enchytrismoi (128: including 108 in amphorae, 15 in hydriae and three in chytres). In addition to adult burials, there is a large number of children and babies (229): infant mortality is estimated at 72.5%. There are also some tile tombs, pithos burials, larnakes and built cists (in stone or terracotta), and certain pit tombs contain wooden larnakes or coffins. Three enclosures unite what are probably tombs from the same family. Grave goods found in 145 tombs comprise vases, unguentaria and personal objects. Forty three bronze coins of Akanthos and Ouranopolis, plus numerous figurines, are also noted (Fig. 151). Plot 46 (Karakavouni property) produced 32 mostly Classical tombs, mainly pit tombs, tile graves and tombs with clay walls. Less than half have grave goods, and then in small quantities. Plot 45 (Karakavouni property) produced 10 Classical tombs. Plot 5a (O.T. 1, Tsakouli property) produced part of the southwest cemetery, which predates colonization. Six pointed pithoi with relief band decoration contain multiple inhumations (pithos 6 contained two babies, perhaps twins). The rich grave goods (jewellery in bronze, electrum, copper and gold) date the burials to the beginning of the Early Iron Age. Settlement. Conservation and restoration work was pursued. Excavation in advance of the planned expansion of Ierissos towards the southwest revealed, on plot 10a (Karla property), the remains of ancient terraces related to the ancient bed of the Souilos river. The pottery recovered dates these to the Classical and Hellenistic periods. See AGOnline for a study of coins from Nea Silata, Vrya and a coin hoard from eastern Chalkidike.

A rampart has been found, with stone foundations, as well as a workshop building which must be for metalworking to judge from the large quantity of slag. Sidirokastro, Phaia Petra. M. Valla reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 870) the discovery of three Late Bronze Age (LHIIIB-C) funerary enclosures at Kokkina Vrachia. Dry-stone walls define a space where both inhumations and cremations took place. Some metal offerings (bronze jewellery and weapons), pottery and animal bones were found. Lefkonas, Metochi. M. Valla reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 874) the discovery of a settlement and cemetery at the site of Ovatzik. The cemetery has cist tombs of schist slabs, all robbed. The surface pottery indicates Hellenistic to Byzantine occupation. Serres 43 Constantinoupoleos Street (Kalograiaki property). S. Dadaki (12th EBA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, , 905- 06) the discovery, in the centre of the Byzantine city, of a sizeable curved wall (0.9m wide) which runs across the entire plot; inside it is a rectangular structure, a kitchen, containing post-Byzantine glazed and domestic pottery and kitchen wares (17th to 19th century). These features were partly destroyed by a house built after 1913. The curved wall defines an insula with respect to the road, traces of which are evident in the post- 19 13 town plan. Beneath this was a rubble wall with Late Roman pottery. Funerary hoard. K. Liampi publishes (Kepuana OiXias vol. 1, 385-93) a funerary hoard of seven bronze coins of Nero from the mint ofThessaloniki. These diassaria and assaria were buried in a vase within a tomb in the Serres area discovered in 2003. Since there is no evidence of damnatio memoriae on the coins, they are seen as dating before the death of Nero or immediately after AD 68. Neos Skopos (Vacharopoulou property). M. Valla reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 870) the discovery of five Archaic tombs and part of a 19th-century cemetery estab- lished in a Byzantine cemetery. The five Archaic graves comprise two cist and three pit graves, of which one was covered with stones. They are dated to the Late Archaic period (end of the sixth to the first quarter of the fifth century) by the offerings in four of them. Grave goods comprise Attic and Thasian lekythoi and cups, gold jewellery, iron belts and coins. Ossuaries were discovered at the same level as the ancient tombs. The 19th-century tombs, mostly pits, included the remains of clothing, wooden coffins and Ottoman coins. Glazed pottery attests to Byzantine use of this area also. Agiochori Alistratis. M. Valla reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 874) the discovery of a settlement and cemetery south-southwest of the village. Surface pottery indicates a long period of occupation from the Bronze Age to the Byzantine period. Mesorrachi, Sphelinos. M. Valla reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 874) the discovery of a settlement and cemetery: surface pottery indicates occupation in the Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine periods. 152. Angista, rural villa: detail of floor mosaic in the triclinium. Angista. S. Dadaki (12th EBA, now Director, 12th EBA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 906-07) on continued excavation. The mosaic floor was excavated, and an area of 45m2 (of a total 165m2) conserved. This was decorated with various geometric motifs and with overturned kantharoi from which flow ivy tendrils, in squandrels, using yellow, blue, red and white (Fig. 152). Under the mosaic, an octagonal cistern was connected to a water channel. A trench to the north revealed the oldest wall found and a destruction deposit containing a coin of Trajan. Argilos Z.

Research focused on buildings C and E, and on the architecture of house A (notably the restoration of the roof) where three building phases are identified between the initial construction in the second half of the sixth century and the destruction of the entire sector in 357 BC. The results of excavation in house C are reported in BCH 128-129 (2004-2005), 1509. Acropolis. Exploration of the large building A was completed with the excavation of two rooms in the west wing. Rather than the expected large olive press, the rooms had a floor riddled with postholes for wooden struc- tures. Perhaps the smaller installations found elsewhere in the house (several marble slabs with a small run-off channel) met production needs. The stratigraphy in the west rooms indicates a destruction before the final abandonment of the building. Traces of the floor of a second storey were found in the southwest corner of the central room - a pebble mosaic with mortar, large pieces of tile and small stones. Other rooms were used for storage, as basins in the floor and pithos fragments indicate. Parts of the walls of the pre-357 BC building were found on the floors: rebuilding and reoccupation were contemporary with the reoccupation of the acropolis of Argilos in the mid fourth century. The oil press is the most monumental building in the sector; it was abandoned at the end of the third century BC.</page><page sequence="142">142 DOMINIQUE MULLIEZ Argilos, Kallithea (Theodoridi property).

Sixteen tombs were excavated in the course of work by the water company - 15 cist tombs and a cremation in a pit grave, all but two looted. Three tombs contained multiple burials. Fragments of a gilded bronze wreath, a gold coin of Philip II and a silver of Alexander III, vases and bronze strigils were found in tombs I and III. Amphipolis. P.

Northwest of the village, , on the hill of Ravenia, a defensive peribolos is reported. Nomos of Kavala (18th EPCA: 12th EBA) Dikili Tash. P. Darcque (EfA/CNRS) and Ch. Koukouli- Chrysanthaki (ASA) report on the 2009 study season on finds from the three excavation sectors of the 2008 campaign (dating to the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age in sectors 2 and 6, and the Late Bronze Age and historical periods in sector 7). Study of the housing in sector 6 demonstrates numerous changes and innovations between Late Neolithic I and II, and between the Neolithic and the Early Bronze Age: preferential use of specific raw materials, increasing use of ceramic fragments in the construction of ovens (both hearths and vaults) and the introduction of mortar in wall construction. Study of pottery focused on sector 7, which had the longest stratigraphical sequence encompassing various Late Bronze Age levels, followed by Helllenistic and a series of later, Byzantine and/or Ottoman, episodes. Dikili Tash was frequented between the seventh century BC and the seventh century AD, and then from the 14th to 15th centuries AD. However, as generally in the territory of Philippoi, there is a lack of securely datable remains of the seventh to 14th centuries AD, and this appears to be a period of widespread decline. The study of stone tools produced notable results. An Early Bronze Age flint blade seems to have been used to collect or work reeds, a raw material until now demon- strated only through impressions in the fabric of buildings. Another Late Bronze Age flint blade probably formed part of a tribulum for threshing cereal grain: this is the first evidence for this tool's existence in the Aegean during the Bronze Age. Philippoi. Ch. Koukouli-Chrysanthaki (Ephor Emerita of Antiquities) publishes (KepuccTicx 0i'ia$ vol. 2, 481- 503) an inscribed marble honorific base of the middle or second half of the fourth century BC, re-used in the wall of basilica T. The inscription, in two lines (ATTEAAAS[...]EIOY ATTOAAQNI / KQMAIQI KAI AP[TEMI]AI), confirms the existence of the cult of Apollo Komaios at Hellenistic Philippoi already attested in an inscription found in situ in the commercial agora and published by Lazaridis in 1961 (ADelt 17 [1961-1962] Chr, 239-40). These documents permit the restoration of a Hellenistic building, perhaps dedicated to Apollo Komaios and Artemis, in the centre of the Roman city of Philippoi. Perni, Toumba (Spartali property, no. 807). V. Poulios reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 852-54) the discovery of Classical to Roman settlement remains and an Early Byzantine to Byzantine (sixth- to llth-century) cemetery in an area of earlier settlement. The 34 tombs explored in the Byzantine cemetery comprise 16 cist graves, 10 simple inhumations, five pit graves, one tile grave, one cremation and one enchytrismos. Nineteen skeletons and crania were identified in 26 tombs (two cists contained double burials and a third cist had a second reburial). There were six child burials. Grave goods largely consisted of bronze or gold jewellery (especially earrings in the form of birds) and an iron dagger. THASOS (18th EPCA: 12th EBA) Limenas Area north of the Artemision. A. Muller (EfA/Lille 3), F. Blonde (EfA/CNRS), P. Petridis (EfA/Athens) and S. Dadaki (Director, 12th EBA) report on the 2009 season. Architectural analysis of the east and north wings of the house proceeded, and the pavements of three rooms of the Early Byzantine house (PCE13, PCE20, PCE21) were cleaned and consolidated. Cleaning of the mosaic from PCE21 confirmed the description given when the room was partially excavated in 1971, with the addition of an emblema in the centre of the floor. Among material studies, attention is drawn to a programme of research on Early Byzantine cookwares.</page><page sequence="143">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 143 Balloon photographs were taken of the area of the Early Byzantine house DOM5 from the passage of the Theoroi to the Dionysion (Fig. 153). The macellum. J.-Y. Marc (Ef A/Strasbourg 2) reports continued recording of the building complexes, notably the Ionic passage and room 48 in the northwest wing, with its successive phases of development. Study continued of the marbles used in the macellum. During the Imperial period (second century AD), the passages connecting the court of the hundred flagstones to the macellum, as well as the adjacent rooms, were decorated with marble and painted plaster following the common Western model. Analysis of the pottery reveals a low proportion of fineware and a high proportion of domestic and cookwares, reflecting the activities performed in this area. The recurrance of a specific form of handled pithos or pithoid amphora suggests that large quantities were stored in the area: distinctively shaped oval bowls (of ca. 15 litres capacity) may also have been storage vessels. Study of the sculpture recovered in previous campaigns revealed a significant number of honorific statues mainly from the southwest stoa. The Late Hellenistic or Imperial ensemble of stoa and exedra which defined the south side of the agora was in the second century AD enhanced by an apsidal room which contained the statue of the emperor Hadrian alongside three fragments of colossal statues, probably of emperors. The space organized around the large altar is directly related to the macellum via the Ionic passage. Two other portraits at the south and west of the macellum may belong to another honorific ensemble, of which the exedra of Limenas might be part, along the route leading from the Heracleion to the passage of the Theoroi. Initial examination of the rich faunal material from the south of the agora has revealed a heterogeneous assem- blage, including waste from the processing of ox carcasses and from the preparation or consumption of smaller cattle, fish and sea molluscs. The remains of ox butchery likely relate to animal sacrifices. Islet of Thassopoula. Y. Grandjean, T. Kozelj and M. Wurch-Kozelj (EfA) report on an architectural survey of a tower located on the central peak of the islet. In its first phase, the circular sixth-century tower was crowned both by a parapet and by anthropomorphic merlons. It was later roofed, renovated and/or rebuilt many times, as demon- strated by the different fragments of roof tiles. The tower was used mainly as an observation post with a wide field of vision. During the Early Byzantine period, the tower of Thassopoula ceased to exist in its previous form, and it seems that the rectangular building, built below re-using the blocks of the tower, was designed merely to observe the north coast of Thasos. Area of the Gate of Zeus. S. Papadopoulos (18th EPCA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 857-58) on excavation on the Kalogiannidou property, ca. 50m from the southern part of the rampart and the Gate of Zeus. There were four phases of occupation. The latest phase is represented by five marble sarcophagi of the second to third century AD, two of which are inscribed. Only one had not been looted. They all rest on bases of material re-used from Classical public buildings (probably the gates). At the end of the Hellenistic and Early Roman periods, the area was occupied by a cemetery: 20 tombs of babies and young children were found. These are all tile graves (apart from one enchytrismos and one receptacle of gneiss slabs). They contain very few goods (a glass bead and a gold ring are noted). In the preceding phase (Middle to Late Hellenistic), the remains of a workshop for wine or oil production were 153.

A 2m wide street, previously excavated to the southeast of this plot, separated the workshop from other structures on the plot. Beneath the road was an older road surface, 1.5m wide, bordered by large blocks and built of stones in the centre: this leads into the town from the extra-mural cemetery. The north-south wall found in all trenches may belong to a peribolos. Theatre. Z. Bonias (Director, 18th EPCA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 872-73) on continuing restoration, notable in the koilon, which has been cleaned. In the upper part of the koilon , an Early Byzantine cemetery was established after the abandonment of the theatre in the fifth to sixth century AD (in keeping with the tombs excavated near the rampart). Agios Vasileios. S. Dadaki (12th EBA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 907-10; on previous excavation cf. BCH 127 [2003], 1006) on excavation at the Church of Ag. Vasileios on the shore ca. 800m from the ancient city, in a bay protected from the northeast wind. The eastern side of this three-aisled basilica and its apse were excavated in 2000. Part of the collapsed colonnade was found in the north aisle, including a 1.95m high column which likely belongs to the ground-floor colonnade. No evidence of the floor was found. A small, single-roomed church was found in the central aisle at the level of the choir. These walls, preserved to 0.4m high, re-use blocks from the basilica. A single slab from the basilica floor was found in contact with its east wall; earlier walls were found under the floor. Excavation of the south aisle revealed a deposit from the collapse of the elevation, with bricks from the arcade, two capitals and four columns from the south colonnade. Property of A. and P. Petropoulou. In the neigh- bouring area, on the property of A. and P. Petropoulou, are the remains of a possibly commercial Late Roman building with two or three rooms (noting the numerous coin finds and sherds of storage vessels). The following phase is represented by poorly-preserved Early Byzantine walls. In the second sector on this plot is a rubble two- roomed structure. The finds - sherds of storage vessels, carpenter's nails, glass fragments and four coins including a follis of the age of Justinian - suggest that it is a sixth- century AD warehouse. Thasos, island Theologos. S. Papadopoulos reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 858) the excavation of the north and west sides of a defensive tower (12m x 6.7m) at the site of Babouras. The few finds comprise Thasian domestic pottery and two bronze Thasian coins of the end of the Classical period. Nearby is a cemetery which probably belongs to a small settlement to the southwest, of which several struc- tures have been found (notably a well-built well). The tombs were built of gneiss slabs set on the ground or of rough masonry. Six were excavated, and were completely empty, although the context suggests a Late Roman or Early Byzantine date. Theologos-Astris. S. Papadopoulos reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 859) the discovery of a Roman family tomb covered with three marble slabs at the site of Agelada (Diglia property). The tomb, built of rubble, contained at least three bodies without grave goods and probably belonged to a cemetery. Prinos. S. Papadopoulos reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 859-60) the discovery of a new site on the road between Mikros Kazavitis and the Monastery of Ag. Panteleimon. This is a small, rectangular installation built of flat gneiss slabs, comprising two roofed rooms and an open-air area, which was used for the production of foodstuffs and for domestic crafts. In the southeast corner is a complete Early Byzantine ribbed chytra (the only find to date the site). Close by, a second facility of the same type may be identified, but the walls have completely collapsed. Panagia. S. Papadopoulos reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 860-61) two sections of ancient road at Ag. Panteleimon, between Panagia and Limenas. These roads link the ancient city and the area of Ag. Konstantinos (the southern border of the city) with the ancient marble quarries at Saliari-Vathy and the settlement on the height of Panagia. These have not been uncovered along their entire course and no indication of date has been found, although they are clearly not contemporary. The first section is well preserved (2.5m wide, 300m long). The route takes sharp angles every 30-40m to adapt to the terrain. It is paved with slabs and rubble, with roughly-worked larger limestone blocks along the borders. The second section lies several metres to the south and takes a different course. It is narrower (1.5m) and preserved only for ca. 20m. It is surfaced with small stones and bordered only on one side with large blocks (the other side sits on rock). Rachoni (Paschali property). S. Papadopoulos reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 861-62) the discovery of a series of family tombs containing multiple inhumations. These belong to a single construction programme, using flat stones and worked gneiss blocks, with three gneiss slabs as covers. The four tombs excavated are included within a rectangular public structure. The architectural elements identified - a column capital and parapet blocks - indicate an Early Byzantine date. An Early Byzantine vaulted tomb with an access passage, an arch and a lintel over the low entrance, and plastered walls was discovered nearby. THRACE Nomos of Xanthe (19th EPCA: 12th EBA) Abdera Chortolivado (Sazli Tsair). K. Kallintzi (19th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 879-86) the discovery of a cemetery of the early Clazomenian colony (end of the seventh to the early sixth century) during construction of a water channel in 1997. Twenty two new tombs comprise 11 enchytrismoi in amphorae and eight in pithoi, two pit graves and a cremation pyre in a rectangular pit. The amphorae contain burials of babies and young children (up to four to five years old), while the pithoi contain single child burials and double burials of a woman and child (of nine to 10 years), of two women or of two men. The pithos burials also contain pottery (including an olpe, alabastra, aryballoi, kyathoi and cups). The rectangular pit contains the remains of the cremation pyre of a man on a wooden bier with an olpe and a chytra.</page><page sequence="145">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 145 One hundred metres from the water channel (site 2000.10), numerous fifth-century BC tombs were revealed, which had been damaged by cultivation. Near to Veloni (site 97.14), a 29.2m long section of an ancient road which probably led from the city gate to the cemetery was discovered in 1997-1998. The surface was paved, with larger blocks at the edges. Following further excavation, the road can be traced for a length of 61m. On the Stagoni property (site 2000.04), cultivation on a tumulus revealed in the centre two cist tombs and a cremation burial in a pit. Tomb 1 is a built cist (oriented northwest-southeast), with walls plastered and painted in three colours (red, white and blue), which re-uses earlier material including pieces of an inscribed grave-marker column. It contains the burial of a 35-43 -year-old man holding an iron strigil in his left hand. A cup, a wooden object, part of a bronze pin or fibula and an iron nail were also recovered. Tomb 2, southeast of tomb 1 (and oriented northeast- southwest) is a built cist with five cover slabs bearing mason's marks on four of the upper surfaces (A, B, T, AE) and white plaster inside. It contained the burial of a woman (40-48 years old) in extended position, accom- panied by cups, a lebes of the second half of the fourth century, a blue glass alabastron (end of the fourth to the early third century) and a lead weight. Tomb 3, close to tomb 2 and at the same depth, is a shallow pit: the relatively light burning on the walls indicates that the cremation fire was not intense. The deceased was a 25-35 -year-old man, accompanied by cooking vessels, unguentaria, lead items, a pot and a gold danake (late fourth to early third century BC). Below the level of the cremation were a bronze coin, a bronze bracelet, a lead weight and bone from an adult of 18-45 years, probably from a destroyed tomb. A further sarcophagus in well-worked stone and covered by a small tumulus was found in a field between Abdera and Veloni (site 2000.05). Church of Agia Paraskevi. K. Kallintzi reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 885-86) the discovery of two tombs in the course of landscaping round the modern church. In both cases, the bone was placed on the stone cover of a sarcophagus. These are Christian, post-Byzantine, burials related to the church. Agios Athanasios. K. Kallintzi reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 892-93) the discovery of Early Iron Age and later pottery on the top of a hill northeast of the modern village. Part of the hill was used as a cemetery by the Teans. A tumulus was found on the west side of the summit and an inscribed grave stele was found on the southwest slope (MA 3640). Final Neolithic pottery (4500-3800 BC) was found on the eastern edge of the summit, near the Church of Ag. Athanasios (of the second half of the 19th century). On the northwestern slope of the hill (Bairia, site 99.02), building material, much domestic and black- glazed pottery, and four stamped Thasian amphora handles are noted, plus local reports of pithoi (now covered). Hill of the Koritsia (Kizlar Tepe). K. Kallintzi reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 893) the discovery in the course of illegal excavation on the south slope of the tumulus (site 2000.01) of a series of blocks of local stone arranged in an arc to form a funerary enclosure, inside which was a child-sized terracotta larnax. Psila Vourla (Intze Kouva). K. Kallintzi reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 893-94) the discovery of a round stone structure of uncertain function (perhaps funerary or for storage). The fill inside contains stones from the walls, pottery, animal bone and shell. Beside the east wall was the rim of a pithos set down into the ground, plus abundant late seventh- or early sixth-century BC pottery and the head of a terracotta figurine. K Kallintzi reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 877-79) the discovery of several tombs. Almyri Limni (Tzoula Gkiol). A sarcophagus in finely worked stone (2.2m x 0.8m) with a monolithic cover slab was found set in the southwest slope of a tumulus on Pouliou property. The deceased, of indeterminate sex, was in extended position, with a silver ring on the left hand. Xirovrysi. In the Veloni area (Terzidi property), a mound covered fifth-century BC tombs, some of which were excavated while others were already looted. A further sarcophagus was found looted. Tragasia. Two new sarcophagi were found following illegal excavation in a tumulus on the Pouliou property (site 2000.02). The first (2.11m x 0.73m), carefully constructed, had been disturbed: the disarticulated skeleton of an adult (18-45 years old) and a bronze ring were recovered. The sarcophagus had a pitched roof broken during looting. The second sarcophagus (2.3m x 0.77m) was also finely worked. It too had been looted and only the broken bones of a man were recovered. The tomb has a pitched roof. Some sherds, two iron nails and fragments of glazed vases were recovered from the spoil of the illegal excavation. The two tombs should be contemporary (late sixth- to early fifth-century BC).

Eight small hydriae and a stone bead accessioned in the Museum of Komotini (AI~K 12093 and 12094) are probably from the known sanctuary of the Hero-Rider (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 892; cf BCH 123 [1999], 776). Anastasioupolis, Acqueduct of Justinian. K. Tsouris (12th EBA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 897) on cleaning and conservation work. The acqueduct supplied Late Roman and Byzantine Anastasioupolis with water from the springs of Rhodope. A terracotta conduit was laid on a causeway between two walls, which also facilitated the passage of men at arms between the city and Rhodope. The monument intersects the ancient via Egnatia and modern Egnatia Odos: the section in this area was cleaned, restored and buried. Arriana, Pontikia. Within a programme on the abandoned villages of Rhodope, S. Doukata (12th EBA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 900-01) the cleaning of the Byzantine basilica in the centre of Arriana - a building showing Bulgar influence which housed refugees from the Black Sea in the 1920s and was abandoned after the bombardments of World War II.</page><page sequence="146">146 DOMINIQUE MULLIEZ The basilica has three aisles and a narthex with a projecting apse (22.35m x 12.15m), the walls of which are preserved to ca. 3m high. There are entrances at the west and south, closer to the tower. The interior surfaces of the stone walls are plastered, but no wall-painting is preserved. The paved floor is preserved in the choir, and four bases of the north colonnade of the aisle and three of the south are preserved. The narthex had benches on the north, east and south sides. The wooden roof was covered in tiles of local stone. The building dates to the 19th century: a partially -buried vault from an older church is visible. Maroneia Kabana. Ch. Karadima (19th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 886-88) on excavation conducted in 2000 as part of a study for the restoration of the ancient theatre. Cleaning of the central water channel showed that its passage beneath the koilon was stepped (Fig. 154). In the area of the west parodos, research focused on study of the stratigraphy and the placing of remains of the west retaining wall of the koilon. Excavation in the area of the Roman brick-built proskenion aimed to reveal the surface levels of the successive phases of the theatre: finds include numerous Hellenistic and Roman lamps (mid first-century BC to mid fourth-century AD) and coins of the Classical, and of the same Hellenistic to Roman periods. In the course of transforming the orchestra into an arena, the cover slabs from the orchestra water channel (now hidden) were used to form the balustrade. An inscribed stele (AI~K 11512) was recovered from the spoil of earlier excavations (Fig. 155). 154. Maroneia, Kabana: central water channel beneath the koilon of the ancient theatre. Rachos. Ch. Karadima reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 888) on reconstruction of the Classical northwest fortifi- cation conducted in the area of the square tower. Nearby was a cist tomb with a tile cover, in which two fragments of a second half fourth-century BC grave stele (AIK 11514) were re-used. Parathyra (Skodra property). S. Doukata reports ( ADeltSS [2000] Chr, 910-11) the discovery of two further tombs on the site of ancient Maroneia, by the Kabana river, in the eastern part of the Middle Byzantine fortification (ie. within the Late Roman to Early Byzantine cemetery). The first is a vaulted tomb (the cover is lost) in rubble with worked corner blocks and with a floor of square bricks. The tomb contained brick from the collapsed vault, a fourth-century AD bronze coin, a fragment of a bronze ring, blue glass-paste beads, a bronze fish-hook and fragments of glass candlesticks. The second is a built cist tomb, the cover of which was no longer in place. On the beaten-earth floor was a bronze coin of the end of the fourth century AD, part of a fibula, glass fragments and glass beads. Paliochora. S. Doukata reports ( ADeltSS [2000] Chr , 911-14; cf BCH 125 [2001], 957-58) continuing excavation of Middle Byzantine structures in the ruins of the Early Byzantine basilica. Further pit and cist tombs were found (re-using older building material) as well as rooms (with walls in earth and rubble) opening onto a street, and, to the south of the Middle Byzantine chapel, a new fragment of the mosaic floor of the basilica with geometric decoration. East of the expropriated plot, the apse of the basilica was revealed. In the middle of stone piles was found the upper part of a grey marble altar bearing an inscription recording an alliance between Rome and the Maroneians in 167 BC (A.K. PMTT 1/2000. E.T7. 43).

Mesimbria, Zoni. P. Tsatsopoulou (19th EPCA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 888) the discovery of a Roman child burial in contact with the external face of the rampart. It contained three glass unguentaria, two terra- cotta figurines, a lamp and a cup. Seven tombs were excavated in the cemetery (property of Th. Minardou) - five in amphorae, one in a pithos and one larnax. Three contained no goods and the others objects of Archaic date. Traianoupolis, Chana. K. Tsouris reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 898-99) that restoration was undertaken in 2000 on the observation post, the only well-preserved monument of Traianoupolis which dates to the period of the Ottoman conquest (around 1400).

Geophysical survey revealed pits and ditches from further structures in the Late Neolithic (5300-4600 BC) settlement which were visible under the Roman tombs. Refuse pits noted in the survey were excavated, and produced monochrome red, black and brown pottery, with or without incised decoration, as well as several anthropo- morphic vases (Fig. 156), a few sherds with painted or graphite decoration and tools in stone, bone and horn. Among the Neolithic pits, two Roman (first-century AD) pit graves were excavated (as reported in BCH 127 [2003], 999). The first contained a child burial with a jug, an iron omphalos, an iron rod, a bronze nail and 20 iron nails from the wooden bier, and, from a deeper level, a small kantharos containing a bronze spoon, a feeding cup and a bone bracelet. The second tomb contained the burial of a foal with a rich iron and silver harness. Didymoteichon (ancient Plotinoupolis). M. Koutsoumanis (19th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 888-89) that excavation on the hill of Ag. Petra revealed settlement remains. The large round well (2.2m interior diameter) previously noted (BCH 127 [2003], 998-99) was excavated to a depth of 5m: the entry to a vaulted chamber was found at a depth of 2.5m. 156.

Greco (Director, SAIA) reports on the 2009 excavation season. House of the Columns. Exploration focused on the area of the late antique settlement which lies over the House of the Columns (partially revealed by Adriani in the 1930s). The limits of the house were identified, along with its destruction level (above which few traces of later occupation are visible). The destruction deposit contained numerous architec- tural members in white marble, notably fragments of the peristyle court of the house. In addition to columns, column bases and capitals, items from the fabric of the house include a large basin (over lm diameter), part of a rectangular basin with a moulded rim and a 'flower vase' (a chalice with human protomai). Other architectural members were found in a room in the northwest of the house. Removal of rubble from the western part of the portico revealed the plan and allowed reconstruction of the circu- lation between rooms and adjacent passages. Pottery dates the construction of the house between the end of the fourth and the early fifth century AD, and its abandonment to the seventh century. A deep sounding in a room west of the portico revealed evidence for Archaic and prehistoric occupation - a late sixth- to early fifth-century limestone pavement with traces of fire destruction and a brick wall beneath of LHIIIB-C masonry. Exploration behind the Archaic circuit confirmed the existence of occupation between the end of the Early Iron Age and the second half of the seventh century. Sanctuary on the Lazaridis property. Excavation in the cult building discovered in 2005 concentrated west of the adjacent rooms 1 and 2 in order to confirm the extension of the building onto this hillside. The end of the outside wall of a third room (3), built of large worked blocks preserved to lm high and on the same orientation as the other two, added a further 6m of length. A similar construction technique was used for the two walls which define rooms 1 and 2. Along the external face of the wall, a heap of large worked blocks on a larger foundation confirms the continuation of the cult complex (perhaps as an open space) west of room 3. Under the use level of room 3, a notable accumulation of stone building material comes either from the west wall or from the exterior wall (which lies beyond the excavation area and is no longer visible). The pottery recovered from the floor dates from the sixth to fourth century BC. Deep excavation around the west wall of room 3 revealed a lower rubble wall which predates the cult building and of which only the west face is visible. This is the foundation of a structure set upon a use surface and over a small pit containing Archaic pottery. As with rooms 1 and 2, the walls delimiting room 3, as well as the circulation and destruction levels, were covered by wall X, which had an east-west orientation (following the isthmus fortification) and which was built after the second century AD. Myrina. L. Acheilara (then 20th EPCA, now Director, 16th EPCA) reports the results of a number of rescue excava- tions (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 938-41). Tourkikos Gialos (Lagopoulou-Thalassinos Chrysaphis A.E. property). Two phases of construction, Archaic and Hellenistic, were identified. The Archaic level includes badly-preserved walls of rubble and large pebbles, and a section of a built water channel. The Hellenistic level includes a rectangular room with walls of rubble and earth and a beaten-earth floor. Inside is a round hearth. Four built water channels belong to this phase. Finds comprise pyramidal terracotta loomweights, spindle-whorls, stone tools and figurines, kantharos sherds, lamp moulds, protolemnian pottery, a fragment of a theatrical mask, a pottery lid representing an aulos player and decorated pottery. Garophallidou Lane (Despoti property). Remains of Late Roman to Late Byzantine construction were noted: two Late Byzantine rooms, one with a paved floor, plus a well of the same period; and eight rectangular Roman rooms with lime mortar floors, as well as a built conduit with a cover. Objects from the fill include loomweights, spindle-whorls, sherds of kyathia and a fragment of a figurine representing a child. Dimokratias Street (Koukoulithra property). Seven rooms of a Roman bath complex, built of rubble bound with earth or lime mortar, were investigated. In some places, column drums and capitals were re-used. The floors were of clay, rubble and glazed tiles. One room held a fragment of painted plaster and a section of mosaic. Hypocausts and five hearths were also found. Two other rooms with rubble walls belong to a second phase of construction. The following objects were found in the fill: a fragment of a white marble funerary lekythos representing a banquet; part of a twisted column; a marble lekanis; a column or altar; the panther foot of a table support; column bases and a fragment of column; pottery, glass and ceramic unguentaria; and stone tools. Tsoukalou property. In the adjacent lane, on the Tsoukalou property, the remains of a wall 0.9-1. lm wide, of medium to large worked blocks, is surely part of the flood defence previously found on a neighbouring plot in 1992. Pottery from the fill dates from the Roman to the Late Byzantine period. Plaphadelli property (OTE area). Two rooms of an Ottoman house were noted. P. Kyda Street (Polytaridi Street). The remains of walls and lime mortar floors of the Roman to Late Byzantine periods were investigated. The disturbed fill contained Hellenistic and Ottoman pottery. Myrina, Richa Nera (Rosvani-Daniel property). L. Acheilara reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 941) the discovery of a prehistoric settlement with three phases of construction, the earliest corresponding to the Blue Period at Poliochni and the latest to the end of the Green or start of the Red Period. The walls are too poorly preserved to restore a plan, but there is abundant pottery. Other finds include loomweights and spindle-whorls, a bronze hook, flint blades and flakes, and bone tools. Myrina, Soumbra (Sapera-Kouroglou property). L. Acheilara reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 941-42) the discovery of a group of three Late Roman tombs (a cist</page><page sequence="149">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 149 built of rubble, a pit and a simple inhumation, all covered with slabs of local stone). Nails indicate the use of a bier. Lardi. L. Acheilara reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 946) the discovery of Roman pottery and blocks probably from walls. The construction technique of three walls suggests a Hellenistic date. Plaka, Palaiokastro. L. Acheilara reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 946) that landscaping near the chapel of Ag. Ioannis, ca. 500m from the medieval fort, revealed several tombs, including a cist grave. These have no grave goods and cannot be dated. Lesbos Mytilini, Komninaki and Ladadika Streets (Malliarou property). L. Acheilara reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 916) the discovery of modern structures re-using ancient spolia, notably from the entablatures of Doric and Ionic buildings, and a piece of unfluted column drum. Mitropoli, Agiou Ignatiou Street (I. Kaxiri property). L. Acheilara reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 916) architectural remains, a well and part of a terracotta water channel of the post-Byzantine period. A section of Late Roman wall in worked limestone blocks was also found. The disturbed fill contained post-Byzantine pottery, Late Roman domestic pottery, sigillata, and Late Classical and Hellenistic black- glazed ware, as well as a Corinthian capital. Koulbara, Sarantaporou Street (D. Anezinou property). L. Acheilara reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 916) the discovery of a Hellenistic building oriented north- south, with rubble walls and floors of beaten earth and mosaic (for which only the mortar underlay survives). The disturbed destruction level contained post-Byzantine glazed pottery and abundant Roman domestic pottery, and the fill under the floors black-glazed pottery and West Slope, as well as black-glazed lamps, terracotta figurine fragments and bronze coins. Chryssomalousa, Mitrelia Street (I. Tsolakelli and E. Koukou property). L. Acheilara reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 916) the discovery of two walls of rubble, partially worked blocks and tile fragments bound with mortar. A built-stone conduit, with a paved floor and schist cover slabs, ran northwest-southeast and continued under a later structure comprising two rubble and mortar walls and with a floor of trimmed tile. In the southern part of the plot were three parallel walls, probably of a funerary enclosure. Between two of them were two looted tombs - part of a trachyte sarcophagus and a built cist with a very few bones and domestic pottery. Finds include portions of two unfluted marble columns, sherds of domestic pottery, black-glazed and red-slipped pottery, and two fragments of terracotta figurines. Kallithea, Iakovidou and Kleovoulinis Streets (Athanasoglou property). L. Acheilara reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 918) the discovery of a second-century BC cist tomb (2.15m x 0.9m) built in Phocaean stone (the cover slabs are not preserved). The deceased was accom- panied by an unguentarium and an iron object (a strigil?). Epano Skala, Ermou and Dikelli Streets (Kostaki property). A. Archontidou-Argyri (then Director, 20th EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 918) the discovery of a post-Byzantine well. The area west of the well had been stabilized against floods with rubble and re-used blocks. Part of the well is founded on the Hellenistic rampart revealed in the course of excavation on a nearby plot on Nicomideia Street. Epano Skala, Lesvonaktos and Perikleitou Streets (S. Kourouli property). A. Archontidou-Argyri reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 918-19) the remains of Roman baths incorporating post-Byzantine remodelling. An underground room (2.42m x 2.4m) was defined by walls of worked blocks and mortars. A strong wall 10m long and 2.5m wide belongs to the second phase of the building. The entrance to the hypocaust was blocked with a wall, and the caldarium floor, of square terracotta tiles, was destroyed by a cistern. The baths were founded on older remains which could not be excavated. Epano Skala, A. Panselina and N. Phoka Street (Paschou property). A. Archontidou-Argyri reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 919) the discovery of part of the water supply and sewer network of the ancient city. A built conduit and three terracotta channels were excavated. Roman architectural remains include a building with two rooms (11.2m x 2.4m). Finds include figurine fragments, loomweights, a bone pin and a piece of Ionic entablature. Epano Skala, Longou Street (Angeli property). A. Archontidou-Argyri reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 919- 20) the discovery of a large room (6.5m x 3.7m) cut into the bedrock and bounded by two monumental walls of worked blocks. In the northern part of the plot are remains of Late Byzantine structures and a section of terracotta water conduit. Domestic pottery, sigillata, a fragment of a terracotta figurine of a woman, a loomweight and two oxydized bronze coins were found in the fill. Epano Skala (Demos of Mytilini property). A. Archontidou-Argyri reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 920) the discovery of a section of the Hellenistic city fortifi- cation and a stoa following the demolition of the early 20th-century market. The Doric stoa is oriented east-west and stands against the Hellenistic fortification (Fig. 157). 157. Mytilini, Epano Skala: general view of the stoa.</page><page sequence="150">150 DOMINIQUE MULLIEZ It was exposed to a length of 88m and probably continues further west. Its short east side is closed and an upper storey is restored, supported by a central colonnade set on a row of square bases. During the Late Roman period, baths (12m x 11.5m) were built in the centre of the stoa. Both the stoa and the fortification were built in the local red-brown stone from Mistegna. Finds comprise black- glazed pottery (lamps, skyphoi, pyxides), as well as loomweights. Epano Skala, Naumachias Ellis Street (Diamanti property). A. Archontidou-Argyri reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 920) the discovery of architectural remains of the Hellenistic to Late Roman period. Sections of water channel from the city supply system were discovered (terracotta water-pipes and built drains). Hellenistic remains consist of a room (3.1m x 3m) defined by rubble walls and a strong wall in emplekton preserved to four courses. Above this were later walls and a Late Byzantine cistern. Fill contained seven oxydized bronze coins, two loomweights, domestic pottery, black-glazed and red- slipped ware. Panagi (Demos of Mytilini property, gypsy encampment). A. Archontidou-Argyri reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 921) the discovery of Late Roman agricultural installations on a plot in the northwest of the town, on the edge of the north cemetery and beside the ancient paved road from Mytilini to Methymna. The gentle slope was terraced with retaining walls: on the lower terrace was a trapezoidal room (6.13m x 5.6m). Most terraces have produced round or oval storage structures, with paved floors and walls preserved to 0.65m high. They are built of slabs re-used from cist tombs of the Classical cemetery below: one was inscribed. Mytilini. A. Archontidou-Argyri reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 921-32) on rescue excavation undertaken in 2000 on several streets in preparation for the installation of a water- purification system, and here presented by sector. 273-91 Ermou Street. At the level of the Yeni Tzami, a large vaulted Ottoman sewer runs along the length of Ermou Street; the masonry is of blocks of Mistegna stone with mortar. Two sections of early 20th-century terracotta conduit were revealed, as well as Ottoman architectural remains. At the corner of Ermou and Adramytiou Streets, a section of paved floor on a mortar course continues under the road. A second floor was revealed at a lower level, of the same construction and re-using older material. In a later stage of its use, this floor was coated in hydraulic mortar and built into the Ottoman sewer. Among the ancient blocks used in the floor is an Early Byzantine parapet slab with a relief on both faces, which dates the floor to the fifth century AD (when the channel of the Euripos was filled also). Other finds include an anta capital, part of an inscription (BE 41514), an honorific relief representing Aphrodite on a dolphin with Eros (BE 41496), and Roman and modern pottery. Ermou Street, between Pergamou and Maiandrou Streets. A paved street of the early 19th century was recorded on both sides of an Ottoman arched sewer. Twenty four modern walls belong to buildings which are later in date than two sections of sewer built of rubble and re-used ancient blocks. Beneath are remains of walls destroyed by the modern constructions: three rectangular buildings (preserved to a height of 0.48m), with foundation courses of monumental structures, founded on sand. The external faces of the walls are in re-used masonry bound with mortar, and the interior in rubble. Ermou Street, between Patriarchou Ioakim and Pittakou Streets (Fig. 158). The remains of post- Byzantine to late Ottoman rubble buildings were identified. A paved area of the Ottoman period is inter- preted as a street: a TT-shaped construction dates to the same period. Wall TX47 (0.74m wide, revealed for a length of 48.7m) is part of the west quay along the Euripos channel. It is built in emplekton , with a less careful internal face and polygonal masonry in trachyte on the exterior (adhering shells attest to long contact with water). During a later phase, the wall was covered in tile and shattered blocks. Hellenistic and Roman sherds were found in the sandy fill around it. 123-27 Ermou Street. Building K3 (1.2-2.8m wide x 16.7m long, l-2m preserved height) is preserved to four courses and founded on a layer of sand and shell. Hellenistic and Roman pottery was found in the fill. The building is located on the ancient shore, and forms part of the port facilities. K3 and wall TX47 are connected and belong to the oldest phase of development of this quarter. At the corner of Ermou and Tyrtaiou Streets, part of a Doric cornice was found (BE 41773). Ermou Street, between Patriarchou loakim and Agiou Georgiou Streets. Ottoman architectural remains (eight walls of rubble and re-used worked blocks, remains of a paved surface which is probably a road or the surface of a courtyard, as well as part of a sewer built in rubble) were noted. Ermou Street, between Aigaiou and Maiandrou Streets (Fig. 159). At the corner of Ermou and Symeon Streets (near wall TX47) is the quay wall K7 (over 11m long, 1.5m wide, oriented north-south). This is founded on sand and built in trachyte blocks from Mistegna set length- and cross-wise. The east face is encrusted with shells, the west face is less carefully built and there is an emplekton between them. Finds are Hellenistic and Roman in date. At a higher level were three modern water channels (two in terracotta and one built) and an Ottoman vaulted sewer. At this point the sewer passes under Chrysostomou Smyrnis Street and forks towards Ermou Street. Many remodellings and repairs can be seen, since this sewer is still in use. Kountouriotou Street, from number 35 to the Bank of Greece. Remains of the 20th-century quay were found in two places. At 35 Kountouriotou, a stretch 18.1m long and 1.17m high is built in rubble with hydraulic mortar. In front of the bank is a 9m long stretch: the upper part of the foundation is built of re-used blocks joined with hydraulic mortar. Four early 20th-century water channels, oriented east- west, were found at a depth of lm. One is terracotta and the others are built of re-used materials. Beneath this level were the remains of two post-Byzantine ships. At the level of 29-31 Kountouriotou are the keel, ribs and decking of the first boat, 20-22m long. At the level of 17-21 Kountouriotou are the keel, ribs, hold timbers and decking of the second boat, all covered in tar (2.64m preserved length).</page><page sequence="151">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 151 158.

Wooden stakes from the foundation of a post- Byzantine quay were found at 0.3-0.5m below the modern street level. A second such series (at 4.5m deep) is ancient, and perhaps supported a wooden landing stage. Agiou Therapontos Street, between Ermou and Karantoni Streets. Roman, post-Byzantine and modern architectural remains were noted. Several Ottoman walls were excavated, as well as water channels in terracotta and lead, and a cistern. Beneath this, a section of medieval terracotta water channel and five floors were excavated, as well as three Roman walls defining a room 2.93m x 0.85m. Corner of Vostani, Mitropolitou Iakovou and Mouson Streets. An Ottoman arched sewer was recorded. 8 Noemvriou Street. Roman and modern building remains comprise no fewer than 51 unrelated walls. The modern walls are constructed in rubble, while the ancient walls are of limestone blocks and earth and have associated floors (one of which is a mosaic with geometric motifs). Twelve terracotta water channels and one built channel were also found. At the level of the Chalibey house, part of the medieval rampart, 1.3m wide and preserved to ca. lm high, was exposed for a length of 4.5m. Finds include a Doric capital, a section of twisted column and a marble statue of Hekate. Naumachias Ellis Street. From Iliopoulou Street to the Church of Ag. Nikolaos, modern building remains, including a clay floor, were found. At the corner of Naumachias Ellis and Iliopoulou Streets, a rectangular building (2.4m x 2.37m x 0.36m) in trachyte and limestone blocks may be a tower in the fortification (a gate was discovered on the nearby Chatzisavva property in 1987). At the level of the Koraka Building (Naumachias Ellis 99B), the remains of a Roman workshop extended for a length of some 33.3m. Two rooms were excavated, one with a mortar floor and the other with Phokaian stone paving. The walls were of worked blocks, at some points resting on the rock face, and plastered with mortar. A hearth of brick, tile and mortar (1.65m x 1.45m) with traces of fire was preserved in one room. Under the floor was the water supply system - terracotta water-pipes and built waste conduits. Nearby, in front of the Kourtzi property, was a stone-paved warehouse floor (6.7m long), with pithos fragments in apsidal niches: the walls were built in rubble. A built sewer and a rectangular cistern lined with hydraulic mortar were associated with the workshop. Naumachias Ellis Street, between Kemeriou and Mitropolitou Ambrosiou Streets. Remains of Roman baths were excavated over a distance of a length of 27m. Three rooms were revealed, the central and best preserved of which (13.7m long) contains a hypocaust, with 25 brick columns preserved. The walls were coated in mortar, with traces of marble revetment. The floors were paved in marble laid in mortar: during a later remodelling, the floor of the central room was relaid with terracotta tiles laid in mortar. Parts of the water-supply system - small sections of terracotta water-pipe and built sewer - were found. To the north were the remains of Roman structures, and a kiln, filled with ash and soil. On the north side of the street, close to the fortifi- cation, structures are more sparse. Traces of Hellenistic workshops were found, with quantities of clay and abundant pottery. The large quantity of whole and broken murex shells found in the ash and sandy soil confirms the activity practised in one case. This particular workshop operated in the Hellenistic to Early Roman period and was destroyed for the extension of the north cemetery, as indicated by a tomb containing an unguentarium which was set over the hearth. The fill with the murex shells also contained sigillata, West Slope wares, bronze coins, figurine fragments, loomweights, a small marble altar, and a marble stele base, column fragment and capital. Naumachias Ellis Street, section between Lesvonaktos and 53 Naumachias Ellis Streets. A built sewer was found, also a Late Roman cistern for water collection (3.45m x 1.8m) built in rubble and lined with hydraulic mortar. The cistern is founded on a bed of broken shell and worked blocks. A collection of Roman rubble walls was found at the level of 47-51 Naumachias Ellis, and at the level of 43-47 the Hellenistic fortification was preserved for a length of 5.8m. This section is preserved to two courses, 2.6m wide, oriented east-west and founded on a layer of stone, sand and pebbles. Roman pottery in the lowest levels dates its destruction. It probably belongs to a tower of the fortification, analogous to that built at the start of the east mole of the north harbour. Part of the sea wall, 11.65m long and 2.8m wide, at the corner of Naumachias Ellis and Krinis Streets, is preserved to a height of three courses and oriented northwest- southeast. It is founded on a levelling course of rocks. Two courses of the fortification wall, built in emplekton and 3-3.45m wide, were revealed for a length of 7m running north-south in front of 51 Naumachias Ellis. Corner of Kavetsou and Vournazon Streets. A 6.69m long stretch of the sea wall was revealed, 1.56- 2.18m wide and oriented north-south. Built in Sarmosak stone with blocks set cross-wise, as headers, it is founded on sand and pebbles. Immediately south of the wall was an apsidal structure which is later in date. At the beginning of Kavetsou Street and ca. 10m from the fortification on Vournazon Street, is the west end of a Roman road, 18.5m in length, paved with re-used blocks and oriented northeast-southwest. Architectural members from the surrounding buildings were found in the fill, including a monolithic column. 6 Kavetsou Street. The remains of a cemetery were located on several levels. At a depth of 2.78m, three simple inhumations were accompanied by oxydized bronze coins, four unguentaria and a loomweight, while figurine fragments and Hellenistic pottery were recovered from the fill. At a depth of 3.2m, were two grave monuments defined by peribolos walls of trachyte slabs, with a rectan- gular receptacle made of re-used masonry by each. The burials date to the second half of the fourth century, and included two red-figure pelikes, a bronze kados, a bronze amphora and lid, an iron strigil and a figurine. These monuments are founded on the ruins of older structures. 12-14 Kavetsou Street. Architectural remains of several periods were recorded. In the upper levels are Ottoman walls defining rooms. Beneath are a Roman to Late Roman building and tombs. The building is in rubble work with re-used blocks also. The best-preserved wall was coated on the exterior with mortar containing volcanic tufa and on the interior with hydraulic mortar. A terracotta water-pipe is associated.</page><page sequence="153">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 153 160. Mytilini, 12-14 Kavetsou Street: funerary peribolos 28 and tomb 41. A rectangular Roman funerary enclosure is defined by parallel walls 2.45m wide, built in emplekton and preserved to a length of 5.4m and a height of four courses. It contained two simple inhumations and a monumental sarcophagus, and there was another simple inhumation outside the peribolos (Fig. 160). At an intermediate level between these features was a 6.6m long section of fortification, preserved to two courses (1.15m) high and 4.04m wide. Built in emplekton, , it is oriented east-west. The upper course is in polygonal style whereas the lower, isodomic course forms the foundation. A tower is added at its west end, close to the south gate; nearby was part of a floor paved with various blocks. A 6.19m long section of Hellenistic wall (TX69), perpendicular to the rampart, is preserved to three courses. Upon the remains of the the rampart and of this wall is a monumental, semicircular construction, oriented north- south and preserved to four courses high (the upper two are in large marble blocks joined with TT-shaped clamps). At almost the same depth is a monolithic marble receptacle, in the form of a temple entablature, which contained burnt bone and several black-glazed sherds. Corner of Kavetsou and Agias Irinis Streets. Early 20th-century remains lay immediately beneath the road. At a lower level, two post-Byzantine cisterns were found, lined with hydraulic mortar (as were the water channels associated with them). The cisterns were built of re-used material, notably a piece of Doric architrave and a theatre seat. In a deeper level, a cist tomb contained an iron strigil, a mirror and a third-century AD stamnos. Two further cist tombs, a simple inhumation and two cinerary urns were discovered under the first tomb. The cists contained multiple burials and one held traces of a cremation: goods in these tombs comprise unguentaria, black-glazed cups, a miniature vase, a figurine, a lamp, a bronze mirror and a gold danake. Beneath these tombs was a building with several rectangular rooms, as well as remains of a well and a second associated with water channels of the fourth century BC. 18 Kavetsou Street. Beneath the remains of an Ottoman cistern in Phocaian stone lay a funerary monument founded on sand and preserved to three courses. This contained a receptacle with burnt bones, covered by a slab on which was placed a fourth-century red-figure pelike. Nine further burials (four repositories, four cists and a simple inhumation) were found, all disturbed and with the bones dispersed. Corner of 16 Kavetsou and Agias Irinis Streets. A grave monument (2.76m long) had foundations in which 11 columns of limestone and Sarmosak stone are re-used, and a superstructure of rubble work. This monument contained 11 tombs which had been looted and filled, with numerous bones. Finds from the fill include unguentaria, loom weights, oxydized coins, bronze and iron objects, the upper part of a Hellenistic grave stele, and Roman and Late Roman domestic pottery. Kavetsou Street, between Eressou and A. Deli Streets. One hundred and three tombs from the south cemetery were identified - stone cists, three sarcophagi, four receptacles, five simple inhumations, tile graves (cists and pitched), 12 enchytrismoi (in amphorae, chytres and lekanides) plus five grave monuments which extend outside the excavation area. Grave goods date from the fourth century BC to the third century AD. The tombs extend along the western side of the main road excavated in 1992: six fourth-century BC tombs were laid out between Eressou and Naumachou Papanikoli Streets, closer to the fortification, while the other, Roman, tombs were in the further sector of the cemetery, towards Deli Street. Sourada, 65-89 Eleutheriou Venizelou Street. Excavation revealed building remains (seven walls and a water channel), as well as three cist tombs and an enchytrismos in a pithos from the cemetery. Two of the cists were built tombs, while the third was of slabs of Sarmosak stone. The bone in the tomb was badly degraded and no goods were found. Pottery in the fill around these graves dates from the Roman to Byzantine period. Corner of Chatzimichail and Voutyra Streets. A cist tomb, built in Sarmosak stone and covered with an andesite slab, contained an unguentarium, a black-glazed kyathos and a greyware pelike of the second century BC. Epano Skala, Naumachias Ellis Street at the level of Kydonion Street. Part of the north cemetery was identified. One hundred and thirteen tombs were found, 73 of the Classical period and 40 Roman (Fig. 161). The Classical part of the cemetery consists of sarcophagi in Phocaian stone and andesite, placed side by side in their pits in two rows. They are often poorly preserved and only their floors survive. A monolithic, pitched cover was discovered nearby. Grave goods consist of black-figure lekythoi, kylikes, aryballoi, kantharoi, skyphoi, oinochoae, pelikes, alabastra, figurines, bronze mirrors, pins, fibulae and gold earrings. The Roman part of the cemetery spans the southern part of the Classical sarcophagi up Kydonion Street (partially excavated in 1998). It consists of built cist tombs, cists of stone slabs containing up to five individuals and ossuaries, tile tombs, receptacles built of stone slabs, enchytrismoi in a lekanis and in amphorae, and simple inhumations. Grave goods include ceramic and glass unguentaria, kyathia, small amphorae, terracotta and glazed figurines, coins, bone pins and metal objects (especially bronze mirrors, rings, fibulae, nails, locks and strigils). In addition, A.-Ch. Loupou (Director, 14th EBA) reports ( ADelt55 [2000] Chr, 956-57) briefly on the work conducted by the 14th EBA in connection with this project. Among numerous finds, the following are noted.</page><page sequence="154">154 DOMINIQUE MULLIEZ 161. Mytilini, Epano Skala, Naumachias Ellis Street at the level of Kydonion Street: sarcophagi 43-51. At 8 Noemvriou were numerous house walls and sections of built and terracotta sewers and conduits, and a fountain-like structure. In front of the Veterinary Clinic, an Early Byzantine mosaic floor in polychrome opus tessellatum, analogous to contemporary examples from Kos was discovered. Fills were generally disturbed, but contained very great quantities of post-Byzantine and especially Ottoman material. On Kountouriotou Street, notable finds are fragments of Ottoman marble relief grave stele and two small cannons by the post-Byzantine quays. Mytilini, Tabakaria. L. Acheilara reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 934-35) the discovery of part of the north cemetery in the course of widening the road between Mytilini and Thermi. A total of 143 tombs were found, arranged in groups and in successive strata: the cemetery was used continu- ously from the Classical to Roman period. In addition, a 7.17m long stretch of the cemetery road was discovered (1.8m wide). The two main burial rituals were both practised. Inhumation took place in built cists, in recep- tacles, sarcophagi, simple inhumations, pits, tile graves (cists and pitched tiles) and enchytrismoi. Cremations were found both as primary cremations on pyres set directly into the grave pits (tombs 1-7) or as secondary burials in ceramic or bronze urns (tombs 54, 58, 99, 110 and 129). The tombs were covered with stone slabs and earth or with a stone mound. They were used for multiple burials, with the oldest removed into ossuaries at the side. The majority of burials are of adults, with a very few tombs of babies and young children found, and one grave of an animal. Grave goods comprise pottery vessels, alabastra, glass unguentaria, lead pyxides, earrings in gold and bronze, and other jewellery in gold or gilded terracotta, iron and bronze strigils, bronze mirrors, figurines, astragaloi, bronze locks and keys, and, in the child graves, anthropo- morphic and animal figurines, miniature vases and astra- galoi. Inscribed marble grave stelae were also found (BE 41645, 41646 and 41643). Mytilini, conservation and restoration The following are notable among the discoveries recorded during such work at several locations in the city {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 950-51): Yeni Tzami (1830): a late Ottoman cistern and sewer, as well as whole vases; Tarsi Hamam (17^ century): sections of paved floors and of a hot room of a bath; Valide Tzami: the inscription on the lintel over the entrance, which mentions the date 1615, is shown to come from another monument; Kastro: the vaults of the Byzantine cistern. Loutra, Tsesmedes. A.-Ch. Loupou (Director, 14th EBA) reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 958-59) on excavation within the Early Byzantine basilica A, on the ruins of which was built a modern church. Besides the floor mosaics with plant motifs, excavation confirmed the plan of the basilica (studied by Evangelidis in 1932): a narthex and main church, the interior of which is partially occupied by a rectangular presbyterion. Loutropoli Thermis, Tsiliki (Kolyva property). L. Acheilara reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 935) the discovery of a Late Roman building with two rooms and an earthen floor, identified as a warehouse by the pithoi found in situ. A built sewer was also found. The fill contained mostly domestic pottery, plus an unfluted marble column. Gera, Perama, Chalatses (Vousvouni property). L. Acheilara reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 937) the discovery, in continuing excavation, of Mycenaean archi- tectural remains (potter's workshops, houses, a paved street 0.91m wide and 10.35m long, and water channels). In the western part of the plot were two Mycenaean houses comprising two principal rooms with annexe rooms, plus a third Mycenaean house with two rooms and a paved corridor in the south. A Mycenaean potter's kiln (1.4m in diameter) was found in the eastern part of the plot, as well as another structure with walls lm deep. A Hellenistic to Roman potter's workshop was found above the Mycenaean remains. The refuse deposit of the workshop lay in the northern part of the plot. Finds from the fill include Mycenaean, Hellenistic and Roman objects, notably bronze spearheads, terracotta spindle-whorls, Mycenaean pottery, Hellenistic figurines and sherds of Roman amphorae. Methymna (Delivei-Ziabara property). L. Acheilara reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 937) that excavation, begun in 1990, continued into the earliest levels, revealing fragments of Roman and Late Roman tiled and paved floors (in terracotta, limestone and marble). Goods from the fills include sherds of Roman amphorae and domestic wares, sigillata, an unguentarium, fragments of marble tile and a terracotta pyramidal loomweight.</page><page sequence="155">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 155 Petra (Skarakaki property). L. Acheilara reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 937) the discovery of part of the peribolos of a Late Roman agricultural installation, with domestic pottery. Petra, islet of Agios Georgios. L. Acheilara reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 945) that the islet was used for cultivation and pasture until the mid 20th century. The numerous dry-stone terrace walls which define land- holdings cannot be dated. On the summit of the hill are the remains of the medieval fort, and, beside the chapel of Ag. Georgios, an ancient well still in use. Methymna. L. Acheilara reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 945-46) that prospection in this rural area in preparation for barite mining resulted in the following discoveries: Palaiokastro: a near-circular fort; Monastirelia: two kilometres southeast of Vapheio, Byzantine and post-Byzantine remains round the chapel of Ag. Dimitrios, itself founded on the remains of an Early Byzantine basilica; Deres: approximately 500m north of the previous site, a quarry with worked blocks and walls of trimmed rock; Panagia Stypsis: five hundred metres from Stypsi, a chapel built beside the remains of a Byzantine church, of which part of the choir, the altar and several re-used blocks are visible. A cist tomb was noted nearby. Kavos Plomariou: Bronze Age and Roman pottery. Plomari is the site of ancient Polion, noted by Stephanos of Byzantion. Traces of walls and numerous tiles are reported here. Kato Chorio Plomariou: ancient blocks were re-used for the outside wall of the choir of the Church of Ag. Andreas and in the peribolos wall. Skiamouda: in the area of Antissa, the remains of a near-circular fort in Lesbian masonry. Eressos, Xokastro. L. Acheilara reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 937-38) that work on the water supply revealed three tombs without grave goods. Two were cist tombs built from re-used material and containing multiple burials, and the third was a sarcophagus. Roman pottery was recovered from the fill around these tombs. Beneath this are Roman building remains - two large rooms with walls in rubble work. Evidence of destruction by fire is provided by an ash layer 0.3m deep which covers the entire complex. Finds from the fill include oxydized bronze coins, glass unguentaria, terracotta figurine fragments, fragments of lamp mould, and Roman pottery. In the lowest level excavated was Hellenistic pottery. Sigri. A. Dellaporta (then Director, EMA, now Director, 2nd EBA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 1209) the discovery of a large quantity of pottery bound in a layer of beach-rock at a depth of 5m in the eastern part of the fortress of Sigri. It was probably part of the cargo of a Roman ship. Chios (20th EPCA: 3rd EBA) Publication: Oaves: emypacpes Kai apxocioAoyiKa Evprmara (Weilheim 2009) Chios town Maximou Street (Koukoutsi property). A. Archontidou-Argyri reports (Delt 55 [2000] Chr , 942) the remains of Archaic to Late Byzantine constructions, noting a Late Archaic house with two rooms, as well as a built sewer. Above this is a Late Roman refuse pit. A Late Roman building was found in the southwest of the plot. Kanavoutsi Street (Krousoulidi property). A. Archontidou-Argyri reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 943) the discovery of a Hellenistic building with four rooms. The walls, of rubble work, are preserved to one course (or seven in one case). Part of the Roman cemetery was found: 29 tombs were explored (tile tombs, built cists, simple inhumations and enchytrismoi). Grave goods were mostly glass and ceramic unguentaria. One of the built cists had lime mortar on the walls and rich grave goods: glass and ceramic unguentaria, bronze objects, figurines and a gold ornament. Enchytrismoi in Chian amphorae are of babies. Psara, Archontiki. A. Archontidou-Argyri reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 943-45) the following discoveries. Cemetery. Excavation in the Mycenaean cemetery revealed 10 cist tombs, two receptacles, a pithos and a primary cremation in a pit. The cist tombs were built of worked blocks and slabs, with cover slabs. They contained multiple burials, with the oldest burial pushed to the side with their offerings thus forming ossuaries. Grave goods comprise objects in daily use, as well as objects such as vases, loomweights, bronze arrowheads, daggers, beads in semi-precious stones and glass-paste seals. The two rectangular receptacles were made of slabs and rubble and covered with slabs. They were empty. The pithos contained multiple burials. The pyre was that of a child, accompanied by a skyphos and a bronze ring. Southeast of the cemetery, a refuse pit contains Archaic material. Settlement. Excavation in the Mycenaean settlement west of the cemetery revealed three rooms of a megaron- type house, plus two more to the north. Pithoi found sealed and in situ indicate that the rooms were storage areas. SAMOS (21st EPCA: 3rd EBA). Pythagoreio Georgoudi (O.T. 51) and Chatzieleftheriadi properties. M. Viglaki-Sophianou (21st EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 969-71) the discovery of Roman and Byzantine settlement remains . On the latter plot, two construction phases are visible in the walls of flat stones, rubble and lime mortar. The south wall has a window towards the sea. Under the destruction deposit is a floor of terracotta tiles with a hearth; a chytra, set on a hearth close to a wall, contained bone and a second chytra was found nearby. Finds date mainly to the Late Roman period, but Archaic pottery was also found in the deepest levels. Kalligiani property (O.T. 81, no. 787). M. Viglaki- Sophianou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 969) the discovery of a marble two-stepped krepis, 1.6m wide, from an ancient public building.</page><page sequence="156">156 DOMINIQUE MULLIEZ Pavlou property (O.T. 27, no. 471). M. Viglaki- Sophianou reports ( ADelt55 [2000] Chr , 971) the remains of a rectangular building (1.15m x 1.4m) in the north of the plot, as well as walls, of which one, lm wide and 2.23m high, is identified as a rampart of the port of Samos. A Late Roman potter's kiln (5.5m diameter) was found in the middle of the plot. The walls are in rubble work, bricks and mortar, with soil containing pebbles and seashell. The floor is tiled. Piles of clay were found in front of the kiln. Southeast of the kiln are the remains of a basin or storage space. Kasdagli property (O.T. 34, no. 397). M. Viglaki- Sophianou reports ( ADelt55 [2000] Chr , 971-73) a small water channel with built walls and a mortar floor, as well as a carefully built wall of which only one face is exposed. Built of roughly-worked blocks mixed with brick and lime mortar and with brick courses, it is probably the successor to the Byzantine fortification of the port. In the southeast of the plot, the remains of a built Roman sewer and column drums were found, as well as several tombs in rubble work from the Byzantine cemetery. Tilianaki-Antonadou property (no. 617). M. Viglaki-Sophianou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 973-76) three phases of construction. The Archaic phase is represented by two walls of small flat blocks in mortar and a small water channel. The Roman phase comprises part of a paved road (3m x 2m) and a sewer in the northwestern part of the plot. The road crosses the ancient Sacred Way linking the town with the Sanctuary of Hera. Another section of water channel and a sewer are connected with the Byzantine level of the same street. South of the street is a colonnaded building with large rooms: three long parallel walls running the length of the excavation area have marble revetment on their interior faces. The floors preserve the mortar course for mosaics now lost. This public building was destroyed in the third century AD (perhaps by an earthquake in AD 267), and the area reoccupied by workshops, storerooms and shops in the Early Byzantine period, as indicated by the round hearths and the line of pithoi in the northern part of the building. Finds comprise Geometric to Byzantine pottery, fragments of Archaic, Hellenistic and Roman terracotta figurines, 57 bronze coins, iron and bronze nails, lead objects, pieces of marble blocks (one of which is inscribed) and many fragments of column shaft in red marble. Skouphou property (O.T. 44, no. 98). M. Viglaki- Sophianou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 977-80) the discovery of further traces of the Hellenistic and Byzantine houses discovered in another part of this property in 1972, as well as a section of a paved road belonging to this densely settled quarter. Potha property (O.T. 47, no. 297). M. Viglaki- Sophianou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 980) the discovery of two walls of a public building located close to the port. Only the south face of the one wall, in worked blocks, must have been visible (the north was in rubble and earth). Other walls of less careful build were found, plus a section of a tiled floor. Finds comprise Archaic and black-glazed pottery, Late Roman domestic pottery and many stamped amphora handles. Kanakaki house (O.T. 62, no. 624). M. Viglaki- Sophianou reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 980-81) the discovery of a vaulted construction in brick and lime mortar, founded in rock, within which was a small drainage channel. This was explored for a length of 9.5m. Finds comprise sherds of Roman amphorae and of glass vessels, fragments of wall-painting and bone. The structure likely belongs to a large bath complex opposite the agora. Primary school of Pythagoreio. M. Viglaki- Sophianou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 981-83) the discovery of marble blocks in the school courtyard, one of which (from a bench) is inscribed. Also, the discovery of a stepped marble exedra (11.8m x 6m), with blocks joined by T7 clamps. The exedra faces towards the north, where the course of the Sacred Way has been traced (wheeltracks are visible on its surface). Immediately north of the road is an area paved with large marble slabs which continues beyond the excavation area and a fragment of mosaic floor. In addition, Byzantine tombs in the eastern and western parts of the plot indicate the establishment of a cemetery in this area. Tower of Logothetes. P. Valakou (3rd EBA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chrf 1005) that excavation conducted in the course of restoration of the tower revealed walls associated with a beaten-earth floor and the threshold of an entrance. The disturbed fill contained items dating from the Hellenistic period to the early 20th century. Geometric cemetery (Sophianou-Psycha property). M. Viglaki-Sophianou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 983- 84) excavation of the Geometric cemetery, situated inside the Archaic fortification, west of the baths. In use from the ninth to the seventh century BC, the cemetery contains pit graves, enchytrismoi and primary cremations. Certain enchytrismoi , in large pithoi, amphorae or hydriae, were grouped together, while other burials were organized under round grave tumuli. In one case, a tumulus covered a rectangular receptacle with the cremated remains of two individuals. A rectangular structure containing the remains of cremations (ash, animal bone, sherds of Geometric kraters, oinochoae and hydriae, and metal items) is similar to the ash deposits from Minoa on Amorgos. Remains of the foundation of a public building below the tumuli probably belong to the palaestra of a sporting complex, other parts of which have been identified in previous excavations in the same area. Under the 'palaestra' floor, a hoard of 29 silver coins, of Samos, Miletos, Ephesos and Priene was found in a lead pyxis. Heraion. W.-D. Niemeier (Director, DAI) reports on renewed excavation in 2009, focused on the Early Bronze Age settlement preceding the sanctuary and the origins of the sanctuary. The Early Bronze Age settlement belongs to the same type of proto-urban settlement as Troy, Poliochni on Lemnos and Thermi on Lesbos. Remains have been encountered repeatedly in previous excavations, but only partially published. Following geophysical study of the area, excavation began to the north and beside the Sacred Way, where remains of the Early Bronze Age settlement were found in 1980/1981 (indicating that it is larger than previously assumed). Four later Imperial Roman (first- to fourth-century AD) settlement strata contained archi- tectual remains and older objects, including fragments of the feet and plinth of a seventh-century BC Cypriot limestone Kore (Fig. 162).</page><page sequence="157">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 157 162.

Of the two EBAII early ( ca . 2750-2550/2500 BC) layers below, the upper contained the east wall of a northwest-southeast oriented trapezoidal house, as well as as east-west oriented rectangular house consisting of at least two rooms. This latter yielded pottery on pebble floors, as well as cooking and grinding installations, and storage vessels (Fig. 163). A terrace of red clay on which these structures were built forms the older stratum. Terracing was necessary to protect the northern extension of the settlement from floods of the Imbrasos river. The third excavation of the so-called cult tree (after those in 1963 and 1984), a tree stump associated with the paving of altar 3 (second half of the eighth century BC), disproved the arguments of H. Walter (that it was a Bronze Age cult tree forming the core of the sanctuary) and of H. Kienast (that it grew here accidentally during the Archaic period). The stump does not belong to a tree that grew here (it has no roots), but bears axemarks at the bottom and must have been deposited as a stump. Its temporary removal revealed a paving of flat limestone slabs, on which conical cups of Cretan-Minoan type were placed upside down. 163. Samos, Heraion: house remains of the Early Bronze Age (below) and imperial Roman period (above). Trenches were opened south and east of the Great Altar. That in the south revealed only soil and traces of roots - probably, the location of the sacred grove of Hera. In the east, however, underneath Roman and late antique layers, a band of gravel, created around 560 BC in conjunction with the so-called Altar of Rhoecus, contained numerous votives that probably once stood by the preceding altars: figurines of terracotta, limestone and faience, and bronzes from Greece, Cyprus and the Near East, e.g. the bronze statuette of a bearded man with a dog (Fig. 164). Below were alluvial deposits from the Imbrasos river, as well as three Bronze Age paved areas with no noteworthy finds. 164. Samos, Heraion: Neobabylonian bronze statuette of a man and dog. Underwater survey. Th. Theodoulou (EMA) reports (Ministry of Culture and Tourism press release [29/10/09]) on underwater survey to locate a number of wreck sites. Northeast of Samos, a wreck carrying a cargo of amphorae of the third century lay at a depth of 25-40m. To the east of the island, amphorae and tile from an as yet unlocated wreck were found off a rocky point. In the south of the island, sherds and amphora fragments were found at two locations. Underwater exploration at Kokkariou, in the area of Ag. Nikolaos, revealed submerged Byzantine building remains. The deepening of the harbour at Pythagoreio revealed quantities of pottery of many periods, including Classical Attic black-glazed sherds with graffiti.</page><page sequence="158">158 DOMINIQUE MULLIEZ Ikaria Publication: G.

A flight of four well-built steps leads to the top of the hill and the Byzantine Church of Ag. Irini. CYCLADES (21st EPCA: 2nd EBA) Andros Strophilas (Kontorousi property). Ch. Televantou (21st EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 960-64; Ergon [2009], 57-63) on the 2009 season of excavation in the Neolithic settlement. Trenches were opened at the level of the fortification, which is 1.5-1. 7m wide and has two faces with a rubble fill. In front of the rampart, a wall of large blocks links two rocky promontories at the edges of the plateau (the bottom course is visible under a modern dry-stone wall) and served as a proteichisma (Fig. 165). It dates to the end of the Late Neolithic or the start of the Final Neolithic. Behind it, a curved wall defines a refuse deposit containing rich and varied finds, which are doubtless debris of a fire to judge from the consistency and colour of the deposits inside the ditch and the area of the rampart. 165. Strophilas: promontories and proteichisma. Many buildings were found, apsidal or rectangular in plan, with several rooms. Floors are of clay. Research focused on the Apsidal Building and building B, which provided evidence for the relative chronology of this part of the settlement (Fig. 166). The oldest structure is the Apsidal Building (6m x 10m), to which another apsidal building is attached. This is partitioned into two rooms: the east produced abundant pottery and other objects dating to the end of Late Neolithic II, notably a fragment of a round pyxis with decoration of the Pilos-Lakkoudes ECycI and a terracotta figurine with a triangular head. The southwestern part of the Apsidal Building was destroyed by the construction of building B (12m x 15m) which consists of a large room and two smaller rooms to the east. Half of a pithos was found in the small southeast room and the other half was in the large room, around the door. The belly of the pithos was pierced to aerate the contents. Close to the pithos fragments in the large room was an Early Cycladic bronze dagger. Finds, including abundant pottery, obsidian, bronze objects, terracotta and stone figurine fragments, place occupation between the end of Late Neolithic II and the Final Neolithic or Chalcolithic (a period to date attested only at Za on Naxos). Ypsili. Ch. Televantou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 965- 66) the excavation of a Geometric building discovered in 1982, some 20m east of the temple. A series of rooms was revealed, containing benches on which storage vessels were placed, hearths, a stone with a circular cavity and a run-off channel, a complete hydria and other broken vases around the benches. One of the rooms beside the rampart has two building phases (Protogeometric and Geometric), separated by an ash layer. Research in the temple revealed no new information, but the paved street which links the temple to the settlement was revealed in trenches at the south. On the road surface were a bronze fibula and a large quantity of fine pottery. Publication: Ch. Televantou, 'Av8po$: q apxccia ttoXt] tt)s YyrjXris (Athens 2008). Palaiopoli. L. Palaiokrassa (Athens) reports ( Ethnos , Eleftherotypia [21/09/09]) on the 2009 excavation season. Work continued in the large basilica: finds include a fifth- century AD mosaic floor (with two names) from the central aisle, as well as sections of the building's rich sculptural decoration (notably from the ambo and the presbyterion). A stoa, with a paved road in front of it, produced fragments of marble statues and Hellenistic to Roman monument bases (some inscribed). Kythnos Port. A. Mazarakis Ainian (Thessaly) and D. Kourkoumellis (EMA) report (http://www.ha.uth.gr/ resources/downloads/kythnos2009.pdf; Ministry of Culture and Tourism press release [06/11/09]) on the third season of underwater research in the bay of Mandraki (the ancient port of Kythnos) in 2009. Three second-century AD marble pillars from Hermaic stelae were found in the area where a cuirassed torso was found in 2008: they were re-used in the eastern extension of one of the harbour walls, parallel to the shore and immersed to a depth of 2- 2.5m. This may belong to the sea wall, ca . 3m wide and preserved to lm high. Ship-sheds were established here in a first construction phase, and then in the Late Roman period, when they were no longer in use, the area was closed as a matter of protection before the port was abandoned in the sixth or seventh century AD. Other finds include a fragment of drapery from a marble statue, a prehistoric(?) stone anchor, numerous sherds and lead fishing weights. Upper town. A. Mazarakis Ainian (Thessaly) reports on the excavation in the sanctuary. Research focused on the monumental terrace west of the temple, ca. 60m long and 20m wide, to define its chronology and function.</page><page sequence="159">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 159 166. Strophilas: plan of Neolithic Apsidal Building and building B. The terrace was constructed in the Archaic period and extended to monumental proportions in the Hellenistic. Inside the terrace, earlier retaining walls were found. Fill in the northwest corner contained many vases and metal offerings, including sherds previously found around the temple (building 3): seventh- to sixth-century decorated sherds, bronze pins and rosettes. Fill from outside the retaining wall (to the north) produced Hellenistic finds, notably terracotta female figurines. Building 5 is a rectangular structure (17m x 10m), partially visible. The eastern part is relatively well preserved, as is the northwest corner, while the south- eastern part has collapsed. The building, oriented north- south, has at least two rooms. The floor of the southeast room is paved with schist. In the middle of the northeast room, a rectangular structure defined with schist slabs is probably a hearth. Its fill contained stones and tiles and, at a lower level, a large quantity of ash, charcoal and many Classical small finds, including terracotta female figurines, small drinking vessels, a miniature lamp, an iron dagger and a lead weight. South of this structure and close to the east wall of the building, a significant collection of mostly fourth-century BC finds confirms the public, and perhaps commercial, character of the building, while the central rectangular feature seems to have served a cult function. The public character of building 5 and the finds from the monumental terrace may be clues to the location of the agora of the city of Kythnos. See http://www.ha.uth.gr/resources/downloads/kyth nos2009.pdf. Syros Chalandriani. M. Marthari (ASA) reports {Ergon [2009], 64-67) on the 2009 season of excavation on the hill of Kastri (Fig. 167). Research concentrated inside the semicircular fortification on the top of the hill and at its southeast end. Abundant pottery permits chronological refinements. In particular, the small black-polished kraters which are found in funerary contexts, especially in the tombs of Chalandriani, are conventionally dated to the beginning of ECycII: those tombs which contain only these kraters should perhaps date to the end of ECycII. The settlement was organized in insulae divided by streets. The houses, elongated in form but with rounded corners, both contingent and isolated, are laid out very close to the north fortification. 167.

The recording of scattered blocks concluded, and study focused on the votive monuments (those capitals, bases and drums of votive columns not studied in 2008). The visual impact of votive columns is emphasized. Estimated totals are 13 unfluted columns, seven Ionic or Corinthian, three Doric and one fluted drum, although not all block faces could be fully examined. A graphic recon- struction was made of an Ionic monument with two columns which probably supported the statues of Alexander the Great and Philip II. Study of the Roman pottery from the Prytaneion well began: preliminary indications are that the pottery does not postdate the second century AD, when the well would have been filled. House of Fourni. Chr. Le Roy and H. Wurmser (EfA/Strasbourg) report. Architectural study focused on the peristyle and the pavements. Mosaic fragments from at least three upper floor pavements were studied, one of which had an emblema in opus vermiculatum which probably represents a Nilotic scene. This representation is at present unique, as are other motifs on fragments in the museum (notably the diamond point and cubes in relief). The first stage in a restoration programme, in collabo- ration with the mosaic restoration workshop from the Musee de 1' Aries Antique, was dedicated to the cleaning, restoration and conservation of the large mosaic in room 2. The nature of the decorative themes of the pavements, as well as the homogeneity of the pottery, date the last phase of occupation of the house to the first century BC. 168. Paroikia, Tholos: Hellenistic potter's workshop. Warehouses and systems of storage in the ancient Mediterranean. V. Chankowski (EfA) reports. In 2007 and 2008, the storage potential of multi- functional rooms in houses from the theatre district was studied. In 2009, the commercial buildings were examined, principally those in the southern district, situated on the coast. Initial examination of the buildings allowed closer definition of their similarities and differ- ences: study of the mezzanines in the multi-functional rooms which occupy the facade of the Shop of the Columns and shops a and (3 then followed. These mezza- nines are more strongly constructed than those in the multi-functional rooms of the theatre district, and were probably designed to accommodate heavier storage, creating a need for additional support because of the heavy loading on the beams. The deterioration of the commercial buildings of the southern district, due especially to the rising water level, was documented. Agora of Theophrastos, Circular Building. J.-Ch. Moretti and M. Fincker (CNRS/EfA) in collaboration with V. Chankowski (EfA) report on study of a circular building found in 2008 in the western part of the Agora of Theophrastos, following the present coastline. This consists of two concentric walls (10.75m and 19.29m in diameter), on the outer of which one can restore two heads of a marble coping on both sides of an opening in a low wall. It bears the inscription ID 1835, erected at the beginning of the first century BC by a former agoranomos, and dedicated to Apollo and Hermes. The monument is identified as a kyklos, a form well attested in texts on the Athens Agora as a space used for auctions. Paros Paroikia Tholos. G. Kouragios and S. Detoratou (21st EPCA) report ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 966-67) on excavation on two neighbouring plots. On the Sarri property, two walls and a cistern of schist blocks (0.8m x 2m) were revealed, as well as a terracotta water channel which runs along one of the walls and ends up at a block cut through to allow water to pass. In addition, pits contain debris from a workshop on the neighbouring Skiada plot. This Hellenistic potter's workshop has six kilns, two settling tanks and annexe rooms (Fig. 168). The central kiln (2.5m diameter) is built of schist blocks and preserved to 3m high. The entrance is lm wide, and the two drying bays though which pots are placed on the eschara are preserved. The other kilns are made of Archaic pithoi with broken necks and have brick-built escharas. One of the tanks is lined with schist slabs, and has a marble drainage channel and features inside for working clay, while the second was established during the Hellenistic period in one of the rooms with Classical mosaic floors. Excavation on the modern road revealed the entrance to the workshop, a threshold and door jambs, two further hearths (one built, the other in an Archaic pithos) and a second entrance probably to another workshop. Below this was an Archaic wall under which was a cist grave of a child and a further cist of schist slabs (with the deceased in contracted position under a schist slab). The former Oikonomides house and the Mavrogenni house. G. Kouragios and S. Detoratou report {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 988) the discovery in the former Oikonomides house of the torso of a Roman marble statue of a male figure wearing a himation (inv. 1484) (Fig. 169). Inside the Mavrogenni house at Kastro, re-used marble architectural blocks were found under the floor. Port. I. Kraounaki and D.

A first sondage revealed ca. 300 marble funerary urns, most inscribed, as well as a significant quantity of ancient marble architectural spolia and wooden posts. A section of the foundation of the sixth- to seventh-century AD fortifi- cation of Paroikia was also found, and it is likely that some of the spolia were used in the superstructure. Among the ancient blocks are column shafts and a pedimental relief stele with a scene of a young girl holding a pyxis and a fan between a man and a women (Fig. 170). Pottery recovered is mostly Late Roman and Byzantine. A second sondage revealed a thick layer of pottery and a marble column. Kastrovouni, Cultural Centre. G. Kouragios and S.

Kouragios and S. Detoratou report ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 987-88) that clearance at Mandra has revealed a large building and scattered marble architec- tural members. In the area around Mandra, several sites are identified: ancient walls on the route to Zoumbari; architectural remains in the bay of Livadi and to the west of it; tombs to the east of the bay of Livadi; to the southeast of Mandra, opposite the islet of Tsimindiri, traces of walls which may belong to a Classical or Hellenistic settlement; and settlement remains at Tsimindiri. Mandra, Sanctuary of Apollo. G. Kouragios reports (Ministry of Culture and Tourism press release [15/07/10]) the discovery in 2010 of three Archaic walls related to the south buildings and the peribolos of the sanctuary. A 'well' found in 2007 northwest of the building complex proved to be a cement-lined cistern. Architectural members revealed in cleaning the building complex included some which confirm an earlier building phase. Finds include the head of an Archaic marble kouros, the hand of a marble statue, an iron spearhead, three bronze coins and fragments of an Attic red-figure krater of the last quarter of the fifth century BC. Keros Kavos-Dhaskalio. C. Renfrew (BSA/Cambridge) reports on the 2009 study season. The stratigraphic sequence at Dhaskalio is divided into three main phases, the first two coinciding with the use of the Special Deposit. Most levels are assigned to a late phase in the Early Cycladic, succeeding that of the Kastri Group and approximately equivalent to ECycIII, partially contemporary with the First City at Phylakopl. The Dhaskalio settlement thus flourished after the heyday of the Special Deposit South. Finds characteristic of the Special Deposit South (e.g., broken marble figurines or the multiple-headed lamps found in fragmentary form at Kavos) are not found on Dhaskalio, although Dhaskalio has produced a high proportion of imported materials. Study of several categories of object (pottery, stone spools and marble bowls, vessels and figurines) confirms that, with few exceptions, breakage did not occur locally, but fragmentary material was brought here for dedication. Study of the typology of the marble figurines continues. No examples of the types common in Early Cycladic cemeteries have been found at the Dhaskalio settlement, 170. Paroikia, port: grave stele.</page><page sequence="162">162 DOMINIQUE MULLIEZ despite their abundance in the Special Deposit South. However, the 11 schematic figurines found on Dhaskalio include examples of a type now designated the Dhaskalio sub-variety (Fig. 171). Most belong to settlement phase C, when the Early Cycladic cemeteries had gone out of use, although the Special Deposit South continued. Among a range of specialist studies in progress, analysis of plant materials reveals evidence of the domes- ticated olive, not hitherto well documented in Early Bronze Age contexts. 171.

Further walls were found, plus Geometric to late antique pottery (Fig. 172). On the southwest slopes of the hill, by the ruins of the Church of Ag. Georgios, are five courses of the corner of a small Hellenistic building; part of a statue of Aphrodite comes from this area. Tis Baronas to Phroudi. Z. Papadoulou (21st EPCA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 989-90) that in the area of Kalamitsi, southwest of Siphnos, is a LHIIIC acropolis on a naturally fortified rocky spur. At 240m high, it dominates the bay of Chlochlakou, where its epineion was surely located. Architectural remains visible on the summit include a street and part of the fortifications. Surface pottery indicates LHIIIC occupation, and several Archaic and Classical sherds have also been recovered. POLYAIGOS E. Spondylis, G. Koutsouphlaki and E. Stathi (EMA) report (Ministry of Culture and Tourism press release [26/01/10], widely reported in the Greek press) the recording of a wreck first noted in 2004. The ship, which dates to the late fifth or first half of the fourth century BC, lies at a depth of 25-49m. It carried a cargo of amphorae of at least three types (from Peparithos and the north Aegean). Four transport and two table amphorae were lifted intact, and sections of the ship's anchors were also recorded. Thera Kamari (Kaistele-Karamolegou property). Ch. Pennas (2nd EBA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 1014-15) the remains of seven rooms from a wine-production complex with a press, south of a corridor. On the other side of the corridor several rooms include the remains of hypocausts. Pottery indicates that the complex dates to the second to third century AD and continued in use in the Early Byzantine period and into the 10th century.

Siphnos, Kastro: open vessel of the Ad group. Thee construction phases (Hellenistic, Roman and Early Byzantine) were identified in the walls of three buildings. In the first house, no interior walls were found, but there were tiled floors of the Late Roman period on which pithoi were set and a well with a terracotta rim. The second building is founded on a layer containing fourth- century BC material, notably sherds of Koan amphorae. Marble architectural decoration indicates a public building rather than a house. Pits were dug in Late Roman or Early Byzantine times during a reorganization of the area following a destruction, probably by earthquake: they contain fragments of Roman painted wall-plaster. The west walls of the three buildings form the border of the north-south street, 4.3m wide, a portion of which was revealed in 1992 on a plot further north. This is preserved to a length of 65.8m. Nine road levels were identified - three Early Byzantine, three Roman and three Hellenistic. This road crosses another (4.2m wide), the border of which is formed by the north wall of the first building. The discovery of this crossroads confirms hypotheses about the road network after the synoikism (366 BC). Corner of Makrygianni and Ironda Streets (Mania property). D.

Kos, east sector, Ironda Street: general view.</page><page sequence="164">164 DOMINIQUE MULLIEZ Marmaroto. On the property of A. Eustratiou, 36 Hellenistic and Early Roman tombs were found, most disturbed. There are two cist graves and the remainder are tile graves or pits covered with tiles set flat. Three Roman grave monuments with one or more chambers preserved to a low height were found in the eastern part of the plot: these had been robbed. One of these monuments was extended to the south during a second phase of construction; the extension was set over a refuse pit containing what is probably the debris of an earlier workshop. The continuation of the cemetery was found on the neighbouring plot on Asklepiou Street (D. Eustratiou property). A funerary enclosure surrounded at least three poorly-preserved tile graves, and parts of two further enclosures were also found. The first enclosure was set over the remains of earlier tombs, notably a pit covered with flat tiles and a cist containing a Roman burial and an ossuary. Outside the enclosure were four tile graves, five cist graves, a double cist and two sarcophagi: these date to the end of the Hellenistic period or the Early Roman, and several contain the burials of two or three individuals. Asklepiou Street (Kastellorizou property). Thirty two tombs were found on this neighbouring property, including 16 cists, eight tile graves, three simple inhuma- tions and two pits covered with flat tiles. Most had been damaged or disturbed by the construction of later graves. Only two cist graves and a pit with re-used stelae as cover slabs were found intact: these contained Hellenistic olpai, cups and unguentaria. In the southwest of the plot was a quadruple cist, with common partition walls, to which an elongated cist was added, perhaps as an ossuary. Several Roman funerary structures as well as stone ossuary urns were found in the eastern part of the plot. Platani, Asklepiou Street (Christodoulidou property). In the upper levels were modern tombs of muslim gypsies. Below were a double cist, two triple cists, a cist of flat tiles and a pit grave, of the Hellenistic and Roman periods.

Dellaporta reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1208-09) the discovery by a sponge diver of coins near the islet of Syrna, off the coast of Astypalaia. Some 30,000 coins and a mass of 250 coins adhering together come from a wreck lying at a depth of 47m which is dated by the coins to the third century AD (Fig. 177). Symi Island of Nymos, Tholaria. A Giannikouri (then 22nd EPCA, now Director, Archaeological Institute of Aegean Studies) reviews {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1163) discoveries at the Kastro sta Tholaria. Twenty rooms of a building complex have been identified, as well as vaulted struc- tures. The complex is identified ais a military installation linked to the defence system of the Rhodian state. Rhodes Archaeological Museum, epigraphical collection. A. Dreliosi-Iraklidou reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1114-15) the completion of the cataloguing and identification of the collection of squeezes made by the Italian mission and held in the library of the Archaeological Institute. Of a total of 973, 767 squeezes from Rhodes, Lindos, Kos and the Dodecanese, Crete and Halicarnassos have been identifed. Rhodes, ancient city Within the medieval city. E. Karantzali (22nd EPCA) reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 1115) that excavation of the Mylonaki House on Ag. Phanouriou Street revealed the right side of a monumental Roman gate with the base of the arch opposite street P31. This is probably the entrance to the Roman agora (second century AD): a piece of the crown of the epistyle likely comes from the elevation of the gate. Acropolis. M. Filimonos (Director, 22nd EPCA) and A. Dreliosi-Iraklidou report {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 1115- 16) research into the location of the gymnasium east of the stadium, a complex consisting of a palaestra and a library. Traces of street P26 were found, oriented north-south, which must lie east of the gymnasium. Several street levels of compacted earth and stones were found, as well as terracotta water-pipes. A. Dreliosi-Iraklidou reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 1116-19) the resumption in 2000 of excavation on Enoplon Dynameon Street, on the east slope of the acropolis (an excavation which began in 1972 and revealed luxurious floor mosaics and a settlement insula between streets P26y and P5). Beneath a destruction deposit, two new mosaic floors were found. K. Ba'frami (22nd EPCA) reports {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 1119) the discovery on Pindou Street of street P5 and its foundations, as well as a rectangular construction of unknown function, the fill of which contained fragments of wall-coatings and pottery.

The area excavated in 2000 produced Early Byzantine building remains and further Hellenistic and Roman remains of street P32b. Southern sector. M. Filimonos and the staff of the 22nd EPCA report {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 1120-30) the results of a series of rescue excavations which enhance our understanding of the ancient topography of the city of Rhodes. 177. Islet of Syrna: mass of 250 coins from a Roman shipwreck.</page><page sequence="166">166 DOMINIQUE MULLIEZ At Romanou Melodou and Agion Anargy ron Street (Malliaka property) a series of honorific bases discovered in 1992 identifies the Sanctuary of Asklepios at Rhodes. Also, the foundation trench for the walls of a long monumental building, oriented east-west, was identified in 2000. At the corner of Agias Sophias and Vasileios Irakliou (Pipinou property) the extension of street PI 8 and a workshop, perhaps a potter's kiln, built in limestone blocks and tiles were located, along with the remains of a Late Roman building comprising mosaic floors with geometric motifs. At Agias Sophias Street (Mamaligka property) the remains of a third-century BC house in an insula between streets P18b, P19b, P28 and P38 were located. The fagade faces east, towards street P38. Three rooms were found, aligned with a large courtyard to the south. The easternmost was a dining room with a black and white mosaic floor and settings for nine couches. South of the Panagiota property, where the remains of workshops and part of street P28a were found in 1985, excavation of the Pipinou property on Volonaki Street revealed two rooms with plastered walls of limestone blocks. Street P28a must have run along the east side of these two rooms. At Theotokopoulou Street (Photi Street) the west side of street P39 was discovered (revealed to 2.5m wide, 9.8m long), as well as a Hellenistic house. The street is defined by a wall of worked blocks. Excavation at one point revealed up to 10 successive road levels, while at another point further south, five additional levels indicate that the street continued to be used after the house was abandoned. Two rooms of the house were revealed, with an entry at the west. The threshold is built into the wall bordering the road. Many floor levels were identified, below which a refuse pit containing, among other finds, Minoan conical cups is evidence of occupation of the area before synoikism. At the corner of Megalou Konstantinou and Konstantinou Palaiologou Streets (Diakogeorgiou- Spanou property) and to the west of the monumental peristyle building identified as the second gymnasium of Rhodes, excavation revealed the crossroads of streets P30 and P20a, with a conduit and underground cistern, and also the remains of two houses on two insulae west of street P30 and on either side of P20a. Coins from the fill in the houses date their destruction by fire to the end of the first century AD. The widening of Megalou Konstantinou Street revealed rubble walls forming an angle, another east-west wall, as well as the corner of a cistern which continues beyond the excavation area, west of street P30. Further along, five niches cut into the rock, with well-finished sides, recall those known from extra-urban sanctuaries, and may relate to the sanctuary on a hill or terrace nearby, to the southwest. Water company work on Grigouriou E' Street revealed a 4m long segment of the fortification known from the Italian excavations of 1918. Rhodes, west cemetery Apollonos Street (Alvanaki Street). E. Karantzali reports ( ADelt55 [2000] Chr , 1130-33) the discovery of a Late Roman house with four rooms in the east wing and two (plus adjunct storerooms) in the west. The house is built entirely from re-used material derived from the Hellenistic cemetery on which it rests. Under the floors, which are made of re-used blocks (stelae and architectural spolia) and limestone slabs, lay several tombs. Notable among these is a vaulted tomb, square in plan, built of limestone blocks and reused material with, inside it, an intact inscribed altar decorated with garlands and bucrania. Under the rooms to the northwest and west are two funerary hydriae, three receptacles containing cinerary urns and two rectangular pit graves with numerous bones: plentiful grave goods date the burials to the third century BC. A second half second-century BC cist tomb containing two inhumations was also found under the floor in the northwest corner. Kamirou Street (Papapavlou property). Ph. Zervaki (22nd EPCA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr. , 1133-36) the discovery of 87 burial receptacles, some rock-cut and others built, containing ossuaries or cinerary urns, as well as 21 pit graves, three cist tombs and tile graves. Two groups of vaulted chamber tombs were also found, as well as two walls oriented north-south and two wells apparently belonging to earlier occupation in the area. The excavated tombs date from the Hellenistic period (fourth to third century BC) to the Late Roman (second to fourth century AD). Kamirou Street (Parassou property). E. Karantzali reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1137-40) the completion of an excavation which has revealed 44 new pit graves covered with four to six limestone cover slabs, six built cist graves, three cist tombs with pitched covers, four burial chambers containing stone ossuaries and three funerary periboloi containing two or three tombs. Thirty five of the pit graves were closely arranged in eight rows in the southern part of the plot. The rich grave offerings date the graves to the fourth to third century (Figs. 178, 179). Zakynthou Street. P. Triantaphyllidis reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1140-41) the discovery of six Hellenistic or Early Roman cist tombs, which had been looted. Rhodes, central cemetery. V. Patsiada (22nd EPCA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1142-44) on two rescue excavations. Corner of Lindou and Anastasiadi Streets (Karageorgiou property). Four robbed pit graves were found, plus eight receptacles (four of which contained Hadra hydriae) and a Hadra hydria set in a pit surmounted by a funerary structure which may be an altar. This last is later than the other tombs, dating to the second half of the third century BC. One of the receptacles contained the enchytrismos of a baby in a Hadra hydria. These tombs date to the first half of the third century BC. Water company work on Kazantzaki Street revealed the continuation of the funerary monument excavated in 1992 on the Asvesti-Papaioannou property. There were four burial chambers arranged to the west of the central part of the monument and one tomb on the south side. Engaged columns and wall blocks from the fagades were also found. While looted, the tombs still contained some items, notably four cinerary urns in one of the tombs on the west side. Grave goods date the monument between the first century BC and the first century AD. Rhodes, east cemetery Koilia property. P. Triantaphyllidis reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1144-45) that excavation beside the road from Rhodes to Kallithea revealed 10 tombs and 12 rock-cut round and rectangular receptacles of the Hellenistic</page><page sequence="167">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 167 178.

Bairami reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1145-46) that excavation beside the road from Rhodes to Kallithea (at the level of Delphon Street) revealed a stone ossuary-urn with a lid, placed on worked limestone blocks, and containing burnt bone. A further limestone coffer block found nearby may come from a small temple. Rhodes, medieval city A.M. Kasdagli (4th EBA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1187-88) the discovery of a medieval quarry and ancient (fifth- to second-century BC) water conduits in the moat of the medieval city wall, sector of the Tongue of Germany. D. Kotriklas (4th EBA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 1188-89) the discovery on Demosthenous Street (Karydaki property) of four Early Byzantine tile graves without goods, which are probably part of a larger cemetery. An Early Byzantine cistern lined with hydraulic mortar was also found, as well as three refuse pits containing Hellenistic, medieval and Ottoman material. Excavation for public services revealed walling of limestone blocks which probably formed part of the forti- fications (on Pythagoras Street), while sections of the Byzantine rampart were excavated on Sokratous and Apellou Streets. Remains of the Ottoman baths were found on Eudemou Square and three round wells on Ermoii and Platonos Streets. Part of the quay was found outside the sea wall, between the Tarsanas and Akantia Gates, and, on Platonos Street, a cist tomb containing two burials. Amother cist without a burial was found on the Museum Square. P. Psarri (4th EBA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1190-91) on excavation around an anonymous church on Thiseos Street for the installation of a protective cover which revealed walls, sections of pebble flooring and architectural spolia (including an inscribed ossuary). Portable finds date mostly to the Ottoman period. 179. Rhodes west cemetery, Kamirou Street: west side of tomb 56.</page><page sequence="168">168 DOMINIQUE MULLIEZ L. Platon (4th EBA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1191-92) continuing excavation on the Mole of the Windmills, focused on the redan which forms the rampart on its external face. The rampart here was strengthened by a large rectangular tower; tiles from the tower roof were found in a fire destruction deposit inside it. Tombs - of a child and an adult - were found to the north in 1999, disturbed by successive use surfaces. Other tombs were found along the east side of the tower. In the modern city, at the corner of Pavlou Mela and Cheimarras Streets (Chatziandreou property), L. Platon reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1192-93) the discovery of a large Early Byzantine three-aisled basilica. At the level of the polygonal apse, the rock was trimmed for a conduit to drain off water from the roof of the apse. Under the conduit, a refuse pit (2.05m x 1.2m) contained a large quantity of Hellenistic fine pottery. Ialysos (Trianta). T. Marketou (22nd EPCA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1146-52) excavations at three locations. Ialysos (Paraskeva and Margariti properties). Continuing excavation revealed more of the prehistoric settlement, notably a LMIIIA1/2 potter's kiln near to the previously discovered weaver's workshop to the south. Continued excavation of the xeste on the Paraskeva property revealed a pavement with two layers of pebbles and an older cobbled floor level. C14 dating of charcoal on the older floor gave a latest date of 1689/1680 BC and a probable date of 1765-1716 BC (LMIA) for the cutting of this wood. Trianta (Nikita property). Sections of Hellenistic walls from the enclosure around funerary monuments excavated further north were revealed, as well as three tile graves and an enchytrismos in a Late Roman amphora. During water company work on the Iraklidon-Ixia road, four Late Roman tile graves were found. One of them was set on the floor of a Hellenistic cistern, the walls of which were lined with hydraulic mortar (the remains were traced to the north and are associated with a multi- roomed structure). To the north were two successive Late Roman or Early Byzantine tile graves. Kremasti. Two Geometric tombs and a Minoan building were found. Theologos, Sanctuary of Apollo Erethimios. I. Papachristodoulou (Ephor Emeritus of Antiquities) and L. Marangou (Ioannina, now Emerita) report ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1152-53) on further excavation (particularly on the Grigoriadi property) of the colonnaded building found in 1996. An entrance was found in the west wall, beside which were ash and Hellenistic and Roman sherds. Further finds are an enchytrismos of an infant in a small amphora, with goods of the first century AD, as well as a built conduit. Salakos (Palioklissia). I. Volanakis (4th EBA) reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1194) the excavation of an Early Byzantine basilica with three aisles and annexe rooms. Kastellorizo Kiolia. K.

Leukos survey: Kato Leukos.</page><page sequence="169">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 169 Karpathos Pigadia, Xenonas (Tsekou property). Ph. Zervaki reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1162) the remains of three structures belonging to two phases dated between LHIIIA1 and LHIIIB1, within a known Bronze Age settlement (LMIII/LHIII). Remains of walls were also found on the Velonaki property. Leukos Survey. I. Begg (Canadian Institute/Trent), M. Nelos (Canadian Institute in Greece/Queens College) and T. Brenningmeyer (Maryville) report on the 2009 season of topographic and architectural survey at Kato Leukos (Fig. 180). Preserved architecture mostly consists of walls (0.6- 0.9m deep) of roughly-hewn local limestone blocks and rubble. Individual buildings are difficult to identify, but structures C and D are two of the better preserved; C has two rooms, the larger containing a small semicircular niche, while D is a low barrel-vaulted, two-storeyed building. The bedrock of the southwest and north peninsula was worked either for foundations of dwellings or as cisterns. Structure N on the north Peninsula is the largest surviving bedrock cutting ( ca . 22m x 4m), aligned approximately northwest-southeast. In space Na, a square (ca. 1.5m x 1.5m) plaster-lined settling basin was sunk further into the bedrock in the east corner. On the south side of the southwest peninsula, at least three apparently single-roomed buildings were erected against the precipitous limestone face. The bedrock was cut and smoothed to form a flat vertical surface which served as the buildings' north wall. Rubble walls running perpendicular to the bedrock cuttings abut the bedrock walls. The Byzantine city clearly extends beyond the limits of the survey. The settlement as a whole was composed of small, single-storeyed buildings with perhaps two or three larger buildings. The presence of thick plaster coating some of the walls and the bedrock cuttings suggest that some of buildings served as cisterns.

G. Brokalakis (13th EBA) reports on excavation and restoration conducted in 2005-2006 at the church of Ag. Nikolaos, Bourouni ( AWiC 1 [2010], 223- 32). Inscriptions on the dome are noted. Pairs of rectan- gular holes (later infilled with stones and plaster) high on the north and south walls likely anchored a wooden support structure used in the erection of the dome. On the exterior, similar, if smaller, holes secured scaffolding. A clay pipe in the southwest corner of the roof channelled rain-water to a cistern to the north. Investigations along the outside of the south wall and at the southeast corner, prompted by finds such as a marble pillar base and an Early Byzantine brooch, revealed four graves, comprising three pits (one with a double burial) and a cist. The double burial (of a woman and child) contained bronze jewellery (pendants of Western saints; a cross), a necklace of 68 bone beads and a reliquary wrapped in paper which contained leaves, cotton, a crystal and a bronze coin of Comnenus (AD 1176-1180). The cist tomb was well-built of local limestone: it too held two burials. A 'false' coin was placed in the mouth of the deceased, and a bone pendant and a later Venetian torne- sello were also offered. K. Sidiropoulos reports on the coins from this site in AWiC 1 (2010), 233-37. Lasithi area. G. Moschovi (13th EBA) reports on restoration of the churches at Kritsa (Panagia Kera), Kroustas (Ag. Georgos) and Limnakaro (Ag. Pnevma) in 2005-2008 (AWiC 1 [2010], 251-63). The wall-paintings were dated to the 13th to 14th century AD for the first; as two phases (14th-century and late 16th at the entrance) for the second; and also as two (the later to around AD 1875) for the last. The 14th century is seen as a period of great construc- tional activity in Crete generally (all three churches were founded at this time). At Kritsa, Venetian influence is more obvious, e.g. in the treatment of the aisle and dome windows, whilst the other two churches are smaller, with tiled roofs and low entrances closer to the local vernacular tradition. In the 16th to 17th century, the Cretan Renaissance made inroads: plastered vaults replaced tiled roofs, walls were raised and the building made more impressive, wall-painting was neglected in favour of icons and carved stone enhanced the interiors. All these traits are evident here: e.g. Kritsa received gables. Standards were not maintained in the Ottoman period, but in the later 19th century political requirements lead to improve- ments. Potamos. S. Apostolakou (Director, 24th EPCA) reports on inscriptions from the known Hellenistic and Roman cemetery at ancient Kamara ( ADelt55 [2000] Chr , 1042), where to date 140 tombs have been investigated (pit graves and tile graves). One dressed stone grave marker is inscribed on both faces with two epigrams (MAN 13348). A funerary stele (MAN 13141) is inscribed: EYOPOIYNOI XPI5THN THN IAIAN TYNAIKA MNHMHI XAPIN KAI ETT'ArAQON Spinalonga. M. Andrianakis (then 13th EBA, now Director, 13th EBA and 28th EBA) reports on the continuing programme of works on the island (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1087-88). The focus in 2000 included the Ottoman market of the 17th and 18th centuries AD and the seaward walls. The start of a thoroughfare was revealed and an Ottoman cemetery cleaned; a marble inscription of Hieronymus Marini of 1651 found in the wall gives a terminus post quem for the final phase of work on the Rangone. Demos of Ierapetra Azoria. D. Haggis (ASCSA/North Carolina) and M. Mook (ASCSA/Iowa State) report on the third season of study and site conservation, focused on determining the date of urban transformation and on examining differences in food storage, processing and consumption in domestic and public contexts (Fig. 181). A major transition probably occurred in the early sixth century BC when, following continuous occupation throughout the Early Iron Age and seventh century, a horizon of architectural renovation involves significant changes in the use of the settlement and the organization of public and private space. Novel architectural forms, such as those of the Monumental Civic Building and the putative andreion , suited newly determined civic spaces and institutions, and the large-scale building projects conducted required mobilization and organization of labour. The food storage and processing facilities associated with these two buildings demonstrate changes in the control and mobilization of agropastoral produce for various occasions of public consumption. Houses built at this time remained unchanged until the site's abandonment and destruction in the early fifth century. The types of food processing equipment, and the distribution and condition of grain and other produce in the houses, point to the decentralization of storage and primary processing. Households in the city centre were principally consumers; their assemblages reflect final stage processing and consumption (and storage for conspicuous consumption) rather than multiple-stage processing and storage of staples. Olive and vine, well represented in the botanical record, were processed into oil and wine in contexts removed from the locus of consumption. The large urban house represents the centre of a complex oikos , whose dependents, storerooms and work areas were located away from the south acropolis. The city's civic buildings show different kinds of resource allocation and dining activities. The Monumental Civic Building accommodated various kinds of ceremonies. The open plan encouraged communal feasting in which status distinctions were expressed through the nuances of rituals and ceremonial allocation of sacrificial meat or special meals. By contrast, segregation was the rule in the putative andreion , where a multiplicity of connected but separate dining rooms enabled partici- pants to dine together as part of the civic community, while at the same time expressing corporate or kinship distinctions. The nature of the ceremonies and feasts in these two civic contexts suggests distinct but parallel modes of interaction and expressions of sociopolitical identity in the early city.</page><page sequence="171">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 171 181. Azoria: general aerial view from the southwest. Chryssi Island. S. Apostolakou reports on excavations at this small Minoan island settlement conducted in 2008 ( AWiC 1 [2010], 143-54; Kentro 12 [2009], 3-5). The site, marked by large deposits of murex shells, lies at the northwestern edge of the island and consisted of ca. 12-20 residences. Surface sherds suggest an EMI-II phase followed by a strong MMIIB presence, then reduction in MMIII to LMIA. The five houses investigated have two to three architectural phases within LMIB. They are single- storey structures of mud-brick on stone foundations, with well-made floors. Finds are typical for eastern Crete: decorated and domestic pottery, stone vessels, fish-hooks, daggers and a bronze saw, bronze and silver pins, glass and faience beads, and a seal of red jasper (said to be obtainable on Chryssi). Over 300 ceramic samples were taken for analysis, as well as samples of the numerous shellfish found and soils from floors and hearths. Initial results from houses Bl, A2 and A3 demonstrate the island's role in the Minoan economy, especially in the production of purple dye. In a small room in A2 (a kitchen and store), a tripod cooking pot was found by a hearth in the northeast corner, as well as quantities of olive pips which were likely used as fuel. One room in Bl had a small stone hearth against the north wall, whilst a tripod jug stood on a broken cooking dish amidst thick ash. Many stone tools and clay cups were scattered on the floor around the hearth, with a huge amount of crushed murex and triton shells, and almonds. Another jar stood in the centre of the room, with a whole triton. Covering the floor was a thick layer of black burnt earth, broken shells, and almonds and olives (again used as fuel). In room 1 of A3 is a bench alongside a possible water container of stone slabs; the slope of the floor to the northwest, where there is a receptacle set into the floor, indicates the use of liquids here. Episkopl. A. Mylopotamitaki (13th EBA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1089) on cleaning and restoration at the church of Ag. Georgios and Charalambos (an llth-century AD bath-house converted to ecclesiastical use in the Venetian period). Ierapetra Paramithas (Chaniotakis property). S. Apostolakou reports on excavations conducted in 2000 (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1043). Twenty five first- to second-century AD tombs were found in the north of this plot, adding to the total of 62 previously discovered ( cf. ADelt 52 [1997] Chr , 1047-49). They were arranged in three groups, broadly aligned east-west. Almost all contained single burials in supine position with the head to the east (there are two examples of multiple burial), and with the exception of one pit grave, all are tile graves made of Corinthian-type tiles. Most have been robbed: among the few surviving goods are clay vases, lamps, parts of bronze vessels and pins, and a few bronze coins.</page><page sequence="172">172 DON EVELY Pavlou Kouper Street (Maniatakis property). S. Apostolakou reports on the results of a small excavation conducted in advance of building work in 2000 ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 1043). Slight remains of a Roman building were located, plus two clay water-pipes laid in parallel running north-south. The only finds in addition to pottery were a large quantity of loomweights, a lamp and a bronze coin. Poles (Kyprou Street, Dedelatakis property). S. Apostolakou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1043-44) on excavation south of the Roman cemetery of Ierapetra, where much pottery and part of a marble column had been observed on the surface. A rectangular structure with hollows (of unclear function) in the floor, a hearth, a well lined with stones below and clay rings above, part of a paved road and poorly-preserved house foundations were discovered in different trial trenches. Viglia (Assariotakis property). S. Apostolakou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1044-45) on rescue excavation conducted in 2000 in the centre of the ancient city, on Pavlou Kouper Street, southeast of the Church of the Archangel Michael. Extensive evidence of house foundations and walls was discovered, with at least one Hellenistic and two Roman building phases. In the northeast, a Roman well, stone built at the top, was dug 5m deep in the natural rock: its mouth was closed by a large stone and nearby was a depression suitable for a stamnos. A paved lane passed nearby, heading east. The ruins belong to an atrium house. A terracotta drain ran under the wall footings and part of a paved floor was located outside the line of the structure; elsewhere gypsum slabs marked out the atrium and a later destruction level included tesserae of glass and stone from a floor mosaic. The ancient walls continued beneath a neighbouring modern structure. Amongst the small finds are the torsos of two small marble statues, a terracotta figurine, a large pithos, a lamp, terracotta loomweights and many bronze coins. Ierapetra wall. M. Mari (13th EBA) reports on the restoration (in 2000-2006) of a 160m long stretch of the Byzantine town wall near the sea, including a gate and a tower (AWiC 1 [2010], 200-10). While Early Byzantine connections are strong, there is clear evidence for a Roman predecessor. The wall is preserved in places to 2.3m high, and is generally 1.6m deep; the gate is 5.5m wide and the tower is semicircular in plan. The building is in opus incertum mixtion. Two broad phases may account for the three main components of the structure: the gate and tower are the oldest, dating back to the second to fourth century AD, and the west and east stretches of walling belong to the fourth to sixth century AD, the west being slightly earlier. Parallels in Early Byzantine fortifications at Nicopolis and Thessaloniki are noted. Kato Episkopl. M. Katiphori (13th EBA) reports on excavation and restoration at the Church of the Apostles conducted between 2005-2007 (AWiC 1 [2010], 211-22). The structure began as a Middle Byzantine bath-house (10th to 11th century AD). Its elaborate system of piping can be traced: water from a heated cistern at the east was taken to a hot plunge bath at the northern apse, and then drained out through the wall; hypocaust channels heated the middle large room from below; cold water, bypassing the cisterns, went straight to the cold plunge bath at the southern apse, and then drained out. Vertical flues in the walls circulated the warmed air. The entrance and changing area were set at the west. In this respect, it is typical of such baths of the late Christian, Byzantine and early Islamic periods. Its conversion to a church occurred during the Venetian period (probably late Venetian, perhaps 16th century AD). In the Ottoman period it fell into disuse: stores and animals were quartered there. In 1896-1897 it was reconsecrated. Six main burials were located within the structure, all Venetian in date. Kavousi Publication: G.G. Gesell and L.P. Day (eds), Kavousi IIA: the Late Minoan IIIC Settlement at Vronda : the Buildings on the Summit (Philadelphia 2009). Gournia Survey. L.V. Watrous (ASCSA/Buffalo) reports on EDM mapping in the area of Sphoungaras (Fig. 182). The main construction is the Shore House (1): its location and two galleries running out to sea recall the shipsheds of Kommos and Herakleion (Poros). The best-preserved western wall is built of Cyclopean-sized blocks of bright white limestone; the original floor is a packing set on the natural conglomerate. Behind the galleries, three rooms are entered at the northeast; the eastern room contains the base of a staircase. The block size and the colour of the limestone recalls a deliberate use such as that on the north fagade of the palace at Gournia: the Shore House may also date to MMIII to LMIA. Its destruction in the Theran tsunami in LMIA is indicated by the way in which these blocks have fallen into the galleries. Later (perhaps in LMII-III), a platform was constructed on the eastern side. Three different sets of walls were also recorded. The first set is seen as a fortification protecting the coast: five stretches lie to the west and south of the Shore House. (2) is a casement wall (2.5m deep), at present seen in two segments to the west; (3) to the south is a long wall cutting off the promontory, leaving an opening at the west; (4) lies on the eastern promontory, with a buttress tower recalling those at Ag. Photia. (5), which was excavated by Boyd, runs east of the river to a north-south cobbled street connecting the coast to Gournia (6). (7) runs east- west from behind the tower to the same road; it corners at the west, turning south to connect to the first (8) of four east- west terrace walls. Another set of eight east-west terrace walls (pezoulia ) lies to the south of wall (5). Its south face rises up above ground level and may have acted as a wind-break. The terraces are often enclosed with an entrance at a corner. The few sherds date mostly to MMIII to LMI. Complex (10) to the very south, excavated by Boyd, has a long north-south wall at the ends of which smaller walls enclose rectangular spaces, probably rooms. Plentiful sherds date them to MMIA-II. Demos of Itanos Itanos. N. Coutsinas (EfA) reports on the defence systems employed by this city-state (AWiC 1 [2010], 188- 99) based on work undertaken during the 1990s and the early to mid 2000s. On the west acropolis, traces of walls were found at the west, and on the east acropolis, a rectan- gular Roman tower is constructed of dressed sandstone masonry. Probably the two fortifications were erected at the same time. Three smaller towers - two on the east acropolis and one at the west by a road - may be part of a</page><page sequence="173">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 173 182. Gournia Survey: area of Sphoungaras. network of such watch-towers. On the southern hill, the line of the wall may be traced on four sides, though the north is less reliable. Its construction is typical: facings filled with rubble and earth. It has rectangular towers at the corners; at the southeast is a fortified enclosure with a guardhouse (10m x 6m). The characteristic construction of the southwest tower suggests that it was built between the mid fourth to mid third century BC, perhaps by the Ptolemaic garrison under the admiral Patroclus for Ptolemy Philadelphus ( ca . 270-260 BC). Surveys of the wider territory of Itanos in 2005-2006 produced 107 sites dating from the Neolithic to the Byzantine period, with most being Late Minoan and Hellenistic. Eight watch-towers were visited, from which the sea is visible as well as a sight-line back into the central plain. Some, e.g. Vai, had associated structures of some size (17m x 10m); others, e.g. Karoumes, had antecedents going back to Minoan times. Minoan Roads Survey: Zakro region. S. Chrysoulaki (Ministry of Culture and Tourism) reports on further research in 2000, focused in three areas ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 1046-49). At the fort at Choiromandres, study of finds and further excavation concentrated upon the earliest phase. A trial was dug in the Paved Area to bedrock: lower walls of the First Palace period were found, re-used as supports for the pavement on which lay LMIB material. In area I, there is an entrance at the south and furniture (a bench or pot- stand) at the west, post-dating LMIA. In area III, the fill below the LMIB floor contained a cross wall of First Palace date and a large slab which may have been a base for a wooden pillar: associated pottery is mixed MMII to LMI, with murex shells, a terracotta pendant in female form, bronze pins and sheet (perhaps from a dagger) and a seal with a sketchy depiction of a speared goat and sun. Area IV was dug deep at the south: in its LMIB form it had a beaten earth floor and a door to the north. Earlier walls relate to others in area III to create a sizeable room slightly to the west, with an earth floor beneath which was mixed fill of First Palace date. The North Terrace was constructed after the main building: it yielded MMIIIA to LMIA material, again with First Palace period material below. Lastly, area VI may have served ritual purposes: it is entered from the outside only at the east, where there is a bench. Pots lay on the floor and on the bench, which had traces of burning: the floor itself dates to LMIB, and there was MMIII to LMIA fill below it. Finds include parts of a female figurine and two rhyta. Post-LMIB, the area was left open to the air. Study of the pottery from the 'Sea-Fort' at Karoumes revealed three principal periods of activity, in MMII, LMIB and the second century AD (the latter two producing evidence of destructions with much associated pottery). Surface survey was conducted around the broader area of Zakros. In the upland flat-zone of Kastri, Sitanos was a Late Neolithic to EMI settlement: later in Minoan times, small quantities of burnt pottery and clay bull figurines indicate a small peak sanctuary. There are many sites in the region of Pyrkaia: in the Mavro Avlaki gorge, a megalithic wall guards the entrance and others form a fort structure. At Kato Zakro, there is a series of megalithic structures at the South Cove - buildings A, B and f, with</page><page sequence="174">174 DON EVELY A a little to the west. The oldest part of these is the south side of building B (the north being open to the air), with building T the most 'house-like' and A no more than a large walled space. As a complex, they may have served a function related to the harbour. Zakros. E. Platon (ASA/Athens) reports on continuing study of material from the main excavations {Ergon [2009], 77-78). In the Palace, work was concentrated on finds from the 1966 excavations in the south workshop and east wing: here a mere 5% of the LMIB pottery is decorated, though by contrast much decorated ware was found in room LVIII (the Lustral Basin) in the east wing. Pottery from the artificial terracing on the hill of Ag. Antonios includes Roman material; that from Hogarth's house A and its surrounds includes Minoan conical cups. Conservation of the 1980 pottery and small finds was completed. Highlights include a kyathos with spiral decoration; a tripod cooking pot with clay lugs below the canonical loop handles which act as heat shields when handling the pot on the fire; a First Palace period vase with a heron depiction; and a jug handle with seal impression (a goat and an unidentified quadruped). Bronzes conserved include small tools, a large prochous and a long saw, folded. Publication: L. Platon, ZaKpos Ir]T£ia $: to avaKTopo kcci o ijivcjiko^ oikioijos (Athens 2009). Demos of Leuke Skiadi. S. Triantaphyllou (Thessaloniki) reports on the skeletal material from the Early Minoan tholos tomb of Livari ( Kentro 12 [2009], 19-23). Just over 1,000 long bones have been processed. It is suggested that these bones were removed from their original place of disposal after they were dry and skeletonized. They were subject to burning and trampling associated with reopenings of the communal tomb. Over half were damaged by lengthy and systematic burning, perhaps whilst fat and soft tissue still adhered. No selection process within the skeleton groups was evident, though sub-adults are under-represented. Demos of Malia Malia, Quartier Delta. M. Pomadere (EfA/Picardie) reports on the 2009 study season, which focused on material from the excavation of building TT with the aim of providing closer chronological definition and an initial interpretation of the building's spatial and functional organization. The area seems to have been permanently occupied between EMU and LMIA, when this part of the town was abandoned. A wide range of domestic activities in the Neo-Palatial building TT will be more closely defined by future study. Demos of Neapolis Dreros. A. Farnoux (Ef A/Paris 4), S. Apostolakou (Director, 24th EPCA) and V. Zographaki (24th EPCA) report on the first season of collaborative fieldwork in 2009. Remains excavated during the campaigns of 1917, 1932, 1935 and 1936 in the agora (sector 1), around the cistern (sector 2) and at the andreion (sector 4) were cleaned and studied. In the agora, the principal aims were to date the first occupation (generally described as Archaic) and to clean the steps unearthed in 1932 and 1936 with a view to their restoration. The results indicate that what had been interpreted as a flight of steps may merely give access to the large cistern (excavated in 1936) which borders the area to the south. This cistern, dated to the Hellenistic period via an inscription, was probably built to retain the rain-water which runs off onto the terrace below. On the summit of the hill, a complex of a terrace and a building was identified where Xanthoudides had seen only the single large building with benches identified as the andreion. A small terrace below and to the north of this building accommodated hydraulic works designed to gather run-off from the terrace above. Below the summit of the west acropolis, a new area (3) consists of an extensive esplanade, partially natural and partially supported by artificial terracing. A trench in the centre of the terrace helped to define the stages by which the esplanade was created after the bedrock was levelled. A second was opened in the corner of a room visible on the surface. Beneath a destruction deposit was a built altar (0.41m wide x 0.75m high; [Fig. 183]), the lower part of which preserved plaster. Four terracotta figurines were found in this destruction deposit (a peplophoros, a male figure wearing a himation, a woman breastfeeding an 183. Dreros: area 3, altar.</page><page sequence="175">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 175 infant and a mask of Silenus) plus many complete or near complete vases. Among numerous objects connected with the altar are an iron knife blade, two arrowheads and three complete vases. Immediately south of the altar and related to it was a small pit ( ca . 0.35m in diameter) full of ash and calcined bone. The overall picture is of destruction and forced abandonment in the Hellenistic period. Finally, a new topographical plan of the visible remains, the various terraces and communication routes, will facilitate understanding of the overall layout of the city (and notably now its southern limits). Publication: H. van Effenterre, La necropole de Dreros (Etudes cretoises 8.2) (Athens/Naples 2009). Sissi. J. Driessen (Belgian School/UC Louvain) and I. Schoep (Belgian School/KU Leuven) report on the third season of excavation at the Minoan settlement and cemetery on the Buffo (Kefali tou Agiou Antoniou), during which work continued on the six zones already opened. In zone 1, the cemetery, several Prepalatial structures were investigated. Building 1.10 was cleared. This held the remains of some 20 people in a mix of primary and secondary depositions, with the deposits sealed by layers of pebbles: beside it, 1.9 was an ossuary containing secondary depositions only. The EMIIA structure 1.11- 1.12 was also completely excavated. Above the original burial layer, which contained at least four primary but disturbed depositions and a number of clay containers holding perinatals, later burials were made, especially to the south, including another MMIIB pithos burial. Several other heavily eroded burial structures were cleared. Work was started on a burial structure to the west, where a solid and large rectangular structure with internal partitions was visible before excavation. Its surface layer yielded at least one pithos burial. In zone 2, excavation of a second megalithic structure (BC) north of the Davaras building confirmed that this too dated to the Neopalatial period, with a similar size and construction. Its floor deposit yielded several coarseware vessels, stone and clay weights, and stone and metal tools, all suggesting that it too had an industrial function. However, on the floors of the two northern rooms were found two small stone figurines of Cycladic inspiration. Excavation of the southeast room yielded a large tub set on its side within the floor, covering a neonatal burial. In zones 3-4, on the summit of the hill, more of the large Postpalatial LMIIIB building was revealed. The centre of the complex was occupied by a small shrine in which were found another clay tube, which clearly supported a bowl, and a series of conical bowls (typical for Sissi) placed in a row behind a triangular stone which perhaps served as an altar. Next to the slab was a complete triton shell and several larger vessels, including two stirrup jars, which may originally have stood on a bench against the east wall. This room opens to the south into a large hall (3.1) with two worked sandstone bases on the long axis of the room with traces of a fireplace between them. On the clay floor of this hall were at least two small tripod cooking pots, a large stirrup jar, a stemmed goblet and two fragmentary clay tubes, one of which was quite large (they must also have served as vase supports). The hall is accessible from the south; in front of it were fragments of a krater. To the north and northwest of the large hall, a series of rooms against the north fagade was examined. The north- eastern room had a large grinding stone, a pounder and a large shell deposited on its latest floor. A room to its west contained a series of conical bowls, a triton shell, stone tools and a stone mortar; this room had originally been plastered and had a terracotta drain which ran through its eastern wall to the space beyond. In its latest levels, this latter space had a cooking dish, but lower in the floor a stone drain continued the line of the above-mentioned terracotta drain; this was set in a level which contained LMIIIA1 pottery. A room to the southwest yielded a complete stirrup jar and a fragmentary stone axe, as well as large concentrations of fallen white plaster. It is still unclear whether zone 5, set on the lower southern slope of the summit, forms a separate construction or is part of the complex seen in zones 3-4. It does not have such large units and may have had a mostly industrial and storage function (several small bronze tools were found): there is evidence for the relaying of floors and the modification of walls at several spots. Between zones 3-4 and 5 was a large, shallow pit containing much animal bone and pottery. On the eastern side is a sequence of three rooms, all with pebble floors. The northern room (5.13) is one of the larger spaces in zone 5: it had plentiful traces of fire destruction and yielded yet another complete clay tube, a poppy-shaped rhyton, a jug and a larnax fragment. Some vases seem to have fallen from above. It was accessed from the east from a small room also with traces of fire destruction; in this room lay a deposit of small vases including several cups as well as much carbonized wood. The area to the east may have been an internal court; a tripod mortar, found upside down with a stone tool on it, was recovered in situ to the east, as well as a small shell deposit. The final destruction in LMIIIB seems to have been contemporary with that of zones 3-4. Surface clearing in zone 6 revealed a large rectangular stone with many depressions (a kernos). The unfortunate discovery of a World War II mortar grenade interrupted work here. A sounding was then opened against the Cyclopean wall at the southwestern foot of the site; dense fill here contained much Early Minoan and Middle Minoan pottery, perhaps brought in for the construction of the wall, which seems not to have lasted beyond the Neopalatial period.

Mochlos: new site plan. Mochlos. J. Soles (ASCSA/North Carolina) and C. Davaras (Athens) report on a new excavation, aimed at the discovery of earlier, especially Prepalatial, remains under the Neopalatial settlement, exploration of the northern limits of the LMIB town and the completion of partly- excavated areas. A new map of the whole site in all its phases was begun using a Differential GPS system (Fig. 184). Work below LMI levels across the site has identified parts of six Prepalatial houses and three streets in what seems to be an open-plan arrangement. In 2005 a workshop for stone vases was recovered; in 2009 an obsidian blade workshop was sampled below a LMI artisan centre (C.7). The latter has evidence for metal- working in gold: a small crucible, a gold strip fragment (like those from the Prepalatial cemetery) and two small bronze tools (one a punch capable of making dot repousse work). EMIII, MMII, LMI and Hellenistic levels made a wider appreciation difficult. Other isolated pockets of EMU were uncovered: all revealed a broad destruction horizon at the end of EMIIB. Three MMIIIA houses were recovered, two of which lay under the terrace in front of the LMIB Ceremonial Building (B.2), the main approach route from the Neopalatial settlement to a sunken shrine at its southwest corner. Remains of two people were identified here in 2008; it is believed to have been a centre of feasting and of communing with the ancestral dead. The MMIII houses were enclosed deliberately in the terrace and their presence marked by votives left thereon. In themselves, the houses were modest: small rooms and narrow rubble walls suited to single-storey structures. A large hearth lay outside one house, accompanied by a full set of cooking wares, and a three-sided prism (radiating whorl, two standing men and a long saw, a bucranium with horns 'arrondies') arguably made by the artisan who worked at the Atelier des Sceaux at Malia. The third MMIIIA house lay to the north of block C, on an extension of the main north-south street separating blocks B and C. After making a sharp turn to the east at the northwest corner of the block, this road turns again, continuing diagonally to the northeast. On the eastern side lay the house, badly damaged in the Hellenistic period. LMI floor levels were removed then; but a MMIIIA floor deposit, with abundant pottery, survived intact, as does its roadside fagade. This in turn suggests that the street is of MMIIIA date and that the Neopalatial settlement was laid out at this early period.</page><page sequence="177">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 177 On the west side of the same road, the well-preserved house C.ll was completely excavated. The house is large, built on bedrock, with no earlier deposits below it. The entrance vestibule has an ashlar bench, an upright ashlar slab, perhaps designed to support a lamp, and a mortar carved from an ashlar block. An interior staircase led from the ground floor both down to a basement level and up to a first storey. It is not yet clear when the house was built, but it was certainly renovated in the LMIB period when ashlar was introduced as a building material on site. Badly plundered at the end of this period, it yielded only a few bronze tools and a stone sword hilt to suggest the wealth of its original contents. Publication: R.A.K. Smith, Mochlos IIB: Period TV. The Mycenaean Settlement and Cemetery: the Pottery (Philadelphia 2010). Papadiokampos. Ch. Sophianou (24th EPCA) reports on the 2008 season of excavation in the Minoan settlement (AWiC 1 [2010], 134-42; Kentro 12 [2009], 6-9), which also produced some Hellenistic finds. House remains have been located along a 250m long stretch of cliff. House Al, by the sea to the northwest, was a two- storeyed structure with a yard and perhaps a garden to the south (a stream-course runs nearby). Ten rooms remain on the ground floor, with two more probably lost to the sea; some walls stand to 1.4m high. Downstairs rooms, with hearths, were used for food storage and processing. Finds comprise some 500 pots (many associated with foodstuffs - such as cooking pots including one with a modelled agrimi head on it, basins, jars and jugs), 200 stone tools, two bronze daggers, a lead weight and a sealstone. Two architectural phases are known: MMIIIB to LMIA, ended by the Theran eruption (noting pumice in the debris), and then LMIB, restricted to the northern rooms only, which is clear evidence of the consequences of the disaster. One hundred and fifty metres to the east are other structural remains: the massiveness of one fagade, with large dressed masonry, as well as associated finds (a copper ingot and a bronze dagger) indicate the superior status of the building, though it too has lost rooms at the north to the sea. House B1 to the southwest had (below a thick destruction deposit) remains of a well-beaten earth floor and a hearth from an upper storey. Associated vases include two amphorae, two bridge-spouted jars, a cooking jar, and sundry cups and juglets, all LMIB in date. Stone weights, two querns, two stone tools (for making vases), a clay loomweight and a bronze fish-hook comprise the other finds. On the ground floor two complete pithoi were found set in pits: one was stamped 10 times by two seals on its rim and handle bases. The seals bore the motifs of a boat and a palm tree between hands: they look to be from a prism seal with hieroglyphic signs (such as those produced in the MMII Malia workshop). This and the pithos shape suggest they were made in MMII-III and would have been 'heirlooms' by LMIB. Surface finds of LMIIIB pottery include a kylix. Environmental research is an important goal of the project. Some 350 samples have been collected from various layers, hearths and inside pots. For example, house Al (room 5) has yielded olive pips and grape seeds. Workshop activities were investigated by sampling stone tools and storage vessels, which indicated the household processing of oil and wine. Fig seeds, almond and lentils have also been found. From the hearth and floor of house B1 came more olive pips and lentils, and from the pithoi, seeds of grapes, perhaps from wine production. The large quantities of olive pips found in the hearths of two houses argue for their use as a fuel (as does the scarce indication of carbonized wood). Animal bones indicate that the inhabitants of house Al ate goat, sheep and pig meat, and were especially partial to seafoods. More than 50kg of various shell and crab remains were collected. Even at the time of the destruction, they were preparing such fare in the yard: as demonstrated by a plate of bivalves and a bronze knife. A skeleton of a small dog covered by stones was found at the east of the yard. Prospection and survey of the site and its hinterland indicate that this was a large town (5-8ha) with a local strategic role, located as it is between two major Minoan centres at Mochlos and Petras. Its inhabitants also traded: pots from the Dodecanese appear in house Al and the ingot in house B1 came from Cyprus. The role of the Thera eruption in its LMIA destruction is strengthened by a 0.15m deep layer including tephra over the ruins in the eastern part of the town Kephala, Petras. M. Tsipopoulou (Director, National Archive of Monuments) reports on excavations conducted between 2004-2006 and in 2009 ( AWiC 1 [2010], 121-33; Kentro 12 [2009], 19-23). A Late Neolithic settlement lies on the eastern slope (as well as LMIII habitation, linked perhaps to larnax burials on another hill); on the northern side is an extensive EMI settlement (as well as Late Neolithic structures and traces of metallurgy) not yet fully under- stood. The MMIB-II cemetery includes five built house tombs, as those at e.g. Mochlos, of several constructional phases and with multiple rooms in each. An EMU presence is indicated by Vasiliki ware and ties to the Cyclades are indicated by four marble figurine fragments (Fig. 185). 185. Kephala, Petras: marble figurine fragment.</page><page sequence="178">178 DON EVELY On the western side of Kephala an undisturbed rock- shelter was investigated in 2006; this is now ca. 3-4m square, but was once larger. Parts of a large MMI larnax were found, along with bone. In 2009, systematic investi- gations cleared a lm deep secondary deposit (or series of deposits), probably from one or more of the house tombs, with only a minimum of covering soil. At least 95 skulls were retrieved. Finds comprise five stone and 100 EMI to EMIII/MMI clay vases, including Cycladic examples as at Ag. Photia, 10 silver and seven bronze items (including daggers), stone beads and obsidian, four gold bands and items of jewellery, two stone and three bone seals (the last with close ties to central Crete, and perhaps specifically Malia). Later awareness of the shelter is seen by the presence of a LMI jug with religious connotations and a conical cup, found close to the surface. Use of the shelter apparently ceased when the Palace was founded. S. Triantaphyllou (Thessaloniki) comments on the ca. 7,000 human remains. The bones were transported when skeletonized, with limited evidence for articulated units at the west side in particular. All age categories and both sexes are present. Traces of burning scattered in the deposit suggest fumigation events in the original location. Small animal bones may relate to funerary offerings. The population was prone to the usual ailments of the period: arthritis, healed fractures and dental problems, along with evidence of non- specific infections. One female may have experienced artificial cranial deformation (giving her a long-shaped skull) and underwent trephination shortly before death. Publication: M. Tsipopoulou and E. Hallager, The Hieroglyphic Archive at Petras (Athens 2010). Praisos. J. Whitley (BSA/Cardiff) reports on study of material from the 2007 excavation southwest of the andreion. The initial impression that the upper levels represent Bosanquet's excavation dump is confirmed. Most of the pottery is Hellenistic and Cretan, including large jugs or hydrias and bowls with incurving rims; on one closed vessel the letters A A were incised pre-firing. Non-Cretan imports comprise less than 1% of the total (no more than five possibly Attic black-glazed sherds and two pithos fragments in a possibly Anatolian/Cycladic micaceous fabric). Cretan necked cups with profiles consistent with a Late Classical to Early Hellenistic date comprise a large part of the assemblage. At least three distinct cup fabrics can be identified. At least two of the pithoi found close to the hearth on the floor level ( cf. AR 54 [2007-2008], 97, fig. 91) are Archaic rather than Hellenistic. One is made in a fabric with red phyllite inclusions, and may be local. The other is considerably larger: both its style (with pendent tongues) and its fabric suggest that it is a product of the Afrati workshop, active around 600 BC. Archaic pithoi are found in Middle Hellenistic contexts elsewhere in Crete, e.g. at Knossos, Phaistos and Trypetos (the last two connected, as in this case, with mid second-century BC destruction or abandonment horizons). Twenty metal objects were cleaned and conserved: the bronze coin previously reported from above a floor is a third- to second-century BC issue of Praisos; the lead weight from the adjoining room weighs 0.995kg. Praisos shrine. Ch. Sophianou reports on rescue excavation conducted on Acropolis A in 2005-2006 (AWiC 1 [2010], 179-87). A landslip following a wildfire revealed wall traces close to the area of the underground chamber explored in 1996. Work in 2005 revealed a large room (7m x 4.5m), partly dug into the bedrock and integrated with a large wall previously surveyed. This room 1 had two entrances at the west and one to the north (leading to the chamber). A thick destruction layer of tiles and building debris lay over eight large Archaic pithoi and an amphora. At the north was a clay model of a seated female with other female figurines nearby. A hoard of 22 silver coins, mostly Hellenistic, was retrieved from the floor (with hints of cloth, perhaps a bag), as were jugs, amphoriskoi, cups, braziers, lamps and other vases, loomweights and metal items. Scattered about the floor were the bones of a large animal, perhaps an ox. In 2006, room 2 (5.5m x 2.15m) was discovered in front of the chamber opening. Similar finds were made, including a lead astragalos, salt-cellar and braziers. The last were stacked on a rock-cut bench and in corners, along with a Rhodian Hellenistic silver coin. Recleaning of the underground chamber (4.1m x 2.1m x 1.92m high) revealed that it was painted red and equipped with three niches; nails in the walls and roof were perhaps to hang offerings. Traces of the inward opening doors are visible as wear on the floor. Holes in the floor at this entrance were perhaps connected to scaffolding and supports for some external roofing (as many tile fragments attest). The complex is identified as a shrine to a female deity with chthonic attributes, who was worshipped at night and with aspects of mysteries. Discussion of the 0.25m high clay model of the seated personage centres on her identifi- cation as Rhea/Cybele, perhaps derived from an earlier Potnia Theron. The Phrygian cap and bird in her left hand are attributes not normally seen in Greece. The figurine is dated to the fifth century BC, with the facial modelling recalling Archaic representations. Pseira. P. Betancourt (ASCSA/Temple) and C. Davaras (Athens) report on continuing investigation of the geology of Pseira and of Minoan exploitation of the local natural resources. A third metacarbonate quarry was located: this altered limestone was employed in the cemetery as well as the town. Reconnaissance of the two Minoan dams was made in preparation for a broader study of water management: it is believed that the Minoans responded to a drying and warming climate by constructing dams and terraces. Photographic documentation accompanied architectural study of the construction practices adopted to cope both with the need to build on rugged and steep terrain, and with seismic activity.

Triada in 2008 (AWiC 1 [2010], 378-</page><page sequence="179">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 179 89). The ruins were choked by destruction debris, including worked stone, brick and wall-plaster (indicating at least two phases of use) with traces of burning. Re- used elements include an Ionic column and a Roman column capital: a later floor was cobbled. Other finds include part of a carved stone embellishment from a window, a bronze lock and an iron pyxis. Ceramic evidence indicates that the building was in use from the 11th to 15th or 16th century AD, although most pottery dates to the 12th and 13th centuries. As well as domestic wares, there was a continuing presence of glazed vases (often small vessels such as cups and basins), including various incised styles. In the narthex and outside the church to the east were nine cist tombs, some with multiple burials (e.g. tomb 7 held 27 skulls), but three with singles. Venetian bronze coins were found in tombs 1 and 6. Pyrgos. E. Theocharopoulou (13th EBA) reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1063-64) on excavation, repair and landscaping at the church of Ag. Georgios and Konstantinos in 2000, which provides considerable additional detail of the building's construction history and the execution of its wall-paintings. Different hands can be detected in the wall-painting. The artist of the Ag. Georgios cycle shows technical affinities with the painter of the scenes of the life of Ag. Konstantinos, with close reference to the styles of the late 13th century AD. Two contemporary signatures in the shrine of Ag. Konstantinos refer to the builder Georgios Pachnoutis: one on the eastern wall dates the paintings to AD 1314-1315. The paintings on the western wall are in the Palaeologan tradition, emphasizing the ties between Venetian-occupied Crete and the Imperial centre: they are by two hands. In the course of landscaping, a group of eight tombs was recovered outside and in contact with the southern end of the western wall, of which four were child burials; one more was located south of the southeastern corner of the church. All are cist graves - slabs bonded with mud and covered by irregular slabs. The few finds associated are glazed-ware sherds, a brick stamped IC XC NI KA and a Venetian coin. Demos of Arkalochori Choumeri. E. Theocharopoulou reports on the programme of restoration and conservation at the Church of the Presentation of the Virgin Mary (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1057-59). The iconography and technical execution of the wall-paintings are described in detail. The themes and techniques of execution are well-established by the early 15th century AD (although executed here in local Cretan idiom): a date in the middle or second half of the 15th century is likely. Kasanoi. E. Theocharopoulou reports on excavation at the Church of Christ the Saviour (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1056- 57). South of the church is a cemetery of cist graves and ossuaries in close proximity, arranged following the natural contours of the ground; the area explored is a small part of a larger burial ground. The graves were covered by large sandstone slabs (without plaster). Associated pottery is mostly Christian, with some Ottoman. Kastelliana. E. Theocharopoulou reports (AD 55 [2000] Chr , 1062-63) on excavation and repairs to the Church of the Presentation of the Virgin Mary. The construction sequence at the single-aisled church is described. The narthex to the west is a secondary addition. The original entrance was at the south: a Gothic style door of Venetian date was later added in the western wall of the narthex. Two phases can also be seen in the wall-paintings, the latter dating to the 14th century AD. Lefkochori. P. Epitropakis (13th EBA) reports on conser- vation undertaken in 2006-2007 at the mortuary Church of the Metamorphosis of the Saviour (AWiC 1 [2010], 390-99). The 14th-century AD wall-paintings (some dated AD 1320-1330, according to Borboudakis) display two pictorial styles. The main nave mostly displays a mixing of the flowing Palaeologan school with the linear mannerisms of the previous century, a style widespread in Crete. Those paintings by the High Altar and inside the north transept are freer in execution and more expressive, reflecting the influence of contemporary popular styles. Many explanatory and dedicatory inscriptions are listed. Demos of Chersonesos Chersonesos. Zotou Philonidou Street (A. Piperopoulou property). C. Galanaki (23rd EPCA) reports on excavation conducted in 2000 (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1016). Parts of the foundations of a Roman building were discovered, along with a paved and cobbled courtyard and a pit (1.5m in diameter) containing a large quantity of amphora sherds. Numerous sherds of plain, thick-walled Roman domestic pottery were recovered along the western side of the building. Below the Roman level was a layer with Early Hellenistic sherds. Small finds include fragments of painted plaster, glass vessel fragments, lamps, bronze coins, bone pins and shells, iron nails and terracotta loom weights. Publication: N.

In the west, building IV was fully exposed, with part of yard B6. In the north lay a new terrace, with structures on the same orientation as elsewhere. An east- west road may have run between it and buildings III and IV.</page><page sequence="180">180 DON EVELY 186. Gortyn, Prophitis Ilias settlement: view of the excavation from the west. The structures of the eighth- to seventh-century BC settlement are now better defined. Despite its irregular- ities, there are clear signs of a planned approach: hence the articulation of the terraces that slope from north to south and the presence of the main east-west road, with its north-south subsidiaries. The buildings vary in size and number of rooms. As with building IV, all were accessed from the smaller north-south lanes and not from the main road. The larger yards (B12, 6 and 19) lie adjacent to the main east-west road and span the entire house frontage. Yard B6 was apparently shared by buildings III and IV. In building I, a series of rooms was explored: the northern side of court B12 was formed by a terrace wall supporting a massive stone structure (B24) at a higher level. Further north again, a large area (B26) is covered by a thick layer of stones eroded down from the settlement higher up. B24 is defined to the east by B23, a rectangular room divided by an east- west wall: to the south is a kitchen (noting extensive traces of burning and a tripod pot crushed on the floor) and to the north is a probable dining room entered by a door at the west end. Building IV (Geometric to Archaic; cf. AR 54 [2007- 2008], 105, fig. 102) is the largest complex yet discovered, with seven rooms in three sets running at different levels north-south and two entrances (one from the western side of lane B18, the other on the eastern side of yard B6). Though the bonded corners suggest a single-phase construction, both the structure and the rooms within are not squared. Nor is the pattern of internal circulation clear: the four rooms at the south are paired on a north- south axis but do not communicate east-west, and of the three northern rooms only B22 and B17 are linked. Near the western wall of B22, a large lekane was sunk in the floor with a protective kerb of stones around it, while a pit occupies the centre, perhaps connected to a channel running across the wall-line between B22 and B17. In the centre of B17 was an oval stone hearth with a whole cup and other ceramic items upon it, which had burnt soil inside it and a scatter of burnt bones around. The northern wall supports a small bench; a curving platform at the northwest may have been used for the processing of cereals. Building V lies west of a small north-south lane, B18. Its yard (B19) was covered in a deposit, thinning from the north, which yielded Geometric/Orientalizing and Hellenistic pottery, but was disturbed by a large modern pit. Collapsed bordering structures may account for the extensive spread of stones at the south. The settlement was gradually deserted over the second half of the seventh century BC and perhaps into the early sixth. Abandonment layers of the seventh century BC in building IV contain collapse from the structure (e.g. rooms B21 and B22). Over room 20 lay earth and massive stone slabs: a stone kerb at the east is probably part of a road running northeast to the top of the hill, which forms part</page><page sequence="181">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 181 of the Hellenistic settlement to judge from the sherds associated. In the fill of the upper terrace was late seventh-century BC to Hellenistic pottery, including Ionian cups of B1 and B2 type, and Classical Attic black figure, reflecting a continuity of religious activity in this area. The thermal baths south of the so-called praetorium. G. Bejor (SAIA/Milan) reports on continued excavation in this large complex (over 1,500m2) that extends for some 50m between the Hellenistic stadium and the road separating the Pythion from the praetorium. Focuses of research were the large rectangular basin (room E) that opens onto the frigidarium at the south and the area east and north of the frigidarium. The opening from the frigidarium into basin E (10m x 5m) was flanked by two marble columns with Ionic bases; bathers passed down three steps into the water. The walls, of irregular stones, were brick-faced on the interior. Sections of the original polychrome floor mosaic show how this and the walls were later covered with waterproof mortar, probably as part of the Justinianic repairs which marked the conversion of the immersion bath into a simple tank. With the collapse of the building in the final decades of the sixth century AD (devastating earthquakes struck between AD 580 and 618), this cistern became filled with debris. It has previously been reported ( AR 54 [2007- 2008], 106) that the collapse of the floors in the suite of warm rooms between the frigidarium and the praefurnia led to the ground sinking. Simpler dry-stone walls were then erected. Excavation in 2009 clarified the transformation of the original double-apsidal tepidarium (where remains of the walls and floor of its hypocaust survive). This communicated with another warm area to the east where parts of the floor and columns of the hypocaust are preserved: its position immediately next to the praefurnium N1 clearly indicates that it must be the caldarium. To the north, a second praefurnium (N2) runs perpendicular to the first. North of these two heated rooms, L and K, and connected with both, was room J which also communi- cated with the apodyterion H to the west. Their original threshold of cipollino marble was replaced in limestone. Room H has another doorway in its northern wall, which is mostly removed (the threshold remains, again of limestone and re-used). These baths were installed between the era of the Tetrachy and that of Constantine. From the beginning, they extended along the northern side of a large colon- naded square; building began from the praefurnium (Nl), which was erected over the abandoned Hellenistic stadium, and continued into the reign of Gallienus when cistern C was enclosed. The frigidarium (with its four corner pillars indicating that it was roofed in ribbed vaults rather than with a dome) then began to collapse. Major changes were effected in the heated rooms: J and L were converted to cold-water usage (their floors were repaved in irregular and re-used marble slabs, and room L was equipped with two immersion tubs); thresholds were raised and the apodyterion H renovated. At the time of the severe earthquakes in the late sixth to early seventh century AD, the complex became choked with rubble: the settlement took over part of it (such as room H) with new cisterns created along the southern side. The Hellenistic temple. E. Lippolis (SAIA/Rome) reports on continued excavation of this temple, which is situated at the southwestern corner of block N of the praetorium (Fig. 187). The neighbourhood has a high proportion of public and governmental buildings. The temple, now well explored and reconstructed in detail, is unusual, and even experimental, in the details of its construction and appearance: hence the two dominant pilasters attached to the side walls inside the porch. Work in undisturbed parts of the emplecton produced ceramic evidence for a date between the last quarter of the second and the first half of the first century BC, complementing material found in the emplecton of the stadium. A monumental hall was built between the temple and the Nymphaeum, perhaps in the first century AD. At least half of a large threshold block in white limestone has been found, set against the eastern wall of the temple, making an open passage ca. lm wide between two lateral antae. This new building, which forms an integral part of the south fagade of the insula, is only partially preserved, making it difficult at present to determine its function. The late Imperial and Early Byzantine phases are already much researched. Work is now focused on the final stages of habitation in the northeastern rooms of a public building constructed over the temple in the second half of the fourth century AD (which was itself set over a cistern of the first half of the fourth century). During the seventh to eighth centuries AD, prior to the final abandonment of the area, the space became a form of temporary shelter. Underneath the partially collapsed ruins of the highest part of the wall was a hearth set in a beaten-earth surface; beside it stood a lidded jar, crushed in a later stage of masonry collapse. The Baptisterion. This building, the so-called Rotonda, has in recent years been investigated by M. Ricciardi (SAIA) (AWiC 1 [2010], 336-47; cf AR 53 [2006-2007], 110) (Fig. 188). It is now mostly exposed, but not completely since on the eastern side it lies under another property. This is an essentially circular construction, ca. 15m in diameter, the outer part of which is occupied by an ambulatory 3.65m wide with a gypsum paved floor and a tiled roof. Two rectangular rooms cut through this at the south to border the central complex, leaving a small entrance into the ambulatory at the southwest. The core area is also circular, 8.5-9m in diameter, with four entrances from the ambulatory (at the quarters). The outer face of this central area is divided into eight deep 'apses', with a column set on a high squared base between each; in the centre is a cruciform font. Domed in opus cementicum , the apse-like sections have opus sectile decoration of plant motifs in marbles of various colours; their floors have geometric patterns in the same technique. The columns of Karystos marble have capitals of high quality (showing influences from Constantinople), noting in particular an example with paired eagles at the corners. The font was made of marble slabs, frescoed and with opus sectile on the exterior. The building is dated to the late fifth to early sixth century AD on architectural and stylistic grounds: although there are signs of phased construction and restoration, this cannot be securely dated. The building was partially destroyed by an earthquake. Thereafter, there is evidence for some habitation beneath the damaged dome in the late seventh to early eighth century AD, until this was brought to an end by a second earthquake.</page><page sequence="182">182 DON EVELY 187.

Below the layer of opus signinum which supported it was a tomb made of stone set in compacted soils; its northern side made use of an earlier wall. This is contemporary with other tombs related to a pre-Justinianic basilica. To the west ran another wall, part of the water-supply system. A series of stone slabs seems to have damaged both this and the tomb. Work in processing the material (especially the small finds) from the Christian basilica continued.

Mapping of the cave by 3D laser scanning is now completed: the considerably different elevations within the cave and between the excavated areas make their topographic and geological relation- ships difficult to understand using traditional 2D data.

L. Starida and E. Kanaki (13th EBA) present a synthetic account of new information about the city's topography and urban development based on work undertaken in 2006-2008 {AWiC 1 [2010], 402-13). Old city walls: sections of the earlier Venetian walls were found in Chandakos Street (where they follow the lines of still earlier Arab and Byzantine fortifications) and in the basements of the Vikeleia Building. Parts of the Voltone Gate were also explored. Churches: the importance of the identification of Santa Catarina Ruinata in the area of Bedenaki is empha- sized. The church was in existence by the late 13th or early 14th century AD, on the evidence of its wall-paintings: parts of a strong wall of large isodomic masonry, probably an earlier coastal defence, were later incorporated into it, and in Venetian times graves were dug through the floor. The eastern part of the Catholic Monastery of Ag. Fragiskos and sundry annexes were extensively excavated. Various cist graves of the Venetian nobility and important members of the monastery yielded valuable goods; a second area was given over to those who died in the course of the siege; and finally, alongside a stretch of the Arab to Byzantine walls to the east lay a later group of vaulted cist graves for Ottoman officers. The complex stratigraphy of a town like Herakleion is well illustrated in a number of recent excavations. On the Ergoexpert plot stout lime-plastered walls were unearthed, as well as arch foundations. Successive associated destructions are dated first by plentiful 13th- century plain and glazed wares, and then early Venetian glass vases and drinking vessels. Scattered in the levels were coins of the later Byzantine Comnenes, of the Macedonians and 100 of the Arab period. From a depth of ca. 4m, Arab period levels produced good structural remains, glazed and plain ceramics (lamps and vases of Palestinian type) and coins. A unique Islamic-style well is dated by the ceramics and coins on its marble floor. The later walls contain many Roman and late Christian archi- tectural spolia, which are themselves important evidence for the existence of buildings of these periods in this area (at present the earliest structure unearthed is probably late Christian). On the Kastelis plot further Arab material included a range of small finds, pottery and many coins of the Emirs of Crete. A thick destruction layer separated this from a cemetery of the second Byzantine period below. This produced 22 tombs of infants, teenagers and women, with much associated pottery, jewellery and other personal ornaments (crosses, belt fastenings, buttons, etc.). Excavation on the Koubenakis plot revealed the first Late Byzantine (12th- to 14th-century) ceramic workshop to be found within the city, with a large quantity of pottery and kiln furnishings, waste and raw products. The later toponyms and a church name attest to the memory of this centre. An important general report by I. Volanakis (13th EBA) in AWiC 1 (2010), 55-73, presents comparable evidence from a range of other building plots. Baths: along Koronaios Road, two bath complexes were excavated in the 1980s and 1990s on the Paravoliasakis and Xekardakis properties, and a third in 2008 on the Xenakakis property. This last preserved parts of the warm rooms, with hypocausts and hot-air flues, thick plaster floors and white-plastered walls with red lines from tiles. Low benches range along the walls; the floors were surfaced in marble. The bath went through phases of re-use and remodelling, as blocked doorways indicate. Among the tumbled debris were marble architectural remains. The plentiful pottery is mostly plain and domestic. An underground cistern (45m3) below the Union of Agricultural Co-operatives building was revisited: built into its walls were arches and pillars (often taken from Roman and late Christian structures as attested by a sixth- to seventh-century AD inscription on a base), architectural spolia and part of a Roman statue. Knossos Knossos Urban Landscape Project (KULP). M. Bredaki (Director, 23rd EPCA), A. Vasilakis (23rd EPCA) and T. Whitelaw (BSA/London) report on study seasons in 2009 and spring 2010, in which the initial sorting and recording of material collected from units in 2008 was completed, as was the sorting and dating of the supple- mentary grab samples collected in all three field seasons (Fig. 189). Preliminary dates have now been assigned to ca. 90,000 feature and decorated sherds (of the ca. 420,000 sherds and tile fragments collected). A second task was the preliminary dating of the plain body sherds recovered in 2007 and 2008 and the listing of the majority of the uncatalogued other finds. Based largely on sherds retained from major excavations at Knossos, the prehistoric and Early Iron Age pottery specialists have begun to define criteria with which to date under-published categories of pottery such as coarsewares and cooking wares; this will be of particular importance in refining the dating of the plain body sherds. Initial study of the material collected from all outlying areas in 2007 and 2008 confirms the highly nucleated character of settlement and deposition throughout antiquity: only small outlying scatters or very low-density spreads are apparent outside the urban site. The ability to date plain body sherds at least in general terms, thus increasing the available sample five-fold, is particularly helpful in defining low-density outlying scatters and the edges of the main urban distributions. While this study has fllled-out considerably the various period distribu- tions, there is no material change to the patterns previously reported (AR 55 [2008-2009], 94-96). One clarification may be noted. Throughout antiquity, occupation material is liable to blend into the immediately surrounding cemeteries: yet a distribution of lighter scatters surrounding the urban site on most sides is likely to represent discrete outlying cemeteries, such as those excavated at Sellopoulo, Mavrospelio and Upper Gypsadhes for the late prehistoric, and at Fortetsa and the North Cemetery for the Early Iron Age and later Hellenistic and Roman phases. A series of more extensive but low-density scatters roughly 750-1, 500m north, southwest and east of the centre appear insufficiently focused or dense to represent subsidiary hamlets (the exceptions are two later prehistoric concentrations on the summit of Ailias to the east). Instead, they may indicate investment in the landscape, such as huts, to facilitate the exploitation of fields at a distance from the centre. Kephala. P.

Knossos, Knossos Urban Landscape Project: clockwise from top left, sherd densities of the prehistoric, Hellenic, post- Roman and Roman periods.</page><page sequence="185">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 185 hill. The growth of the Neolithic settlement is recon- structed via a combination of archival research, macro- scopic ceramic study, geophysical survey and GIS modelling, which relates more than 200 separate earlier excavations in 3D. The hill originally consisted of two knolls, connected by a saddle to form a north-south ridge beneath the west wing of the Palace. The earliest settlement phases (Initial and Early Neolithic) were focused on the gently sloping terrain immediately east and southeast of this ridge, and ran up and probably over the saddle. Following the work of Evans, it has been assumed that the extensive levelling and terracing which transformed the hill from a place of residence to a place of ceremony was associated with the construction of the MMI palace. It now appears that the transformation occurred more gradually, in a series of episodes. The earliest, at the very end of the Final Neolithic (FNIV), created a formal open space or court on the site of the later Central Court, flanked to the west by two houses. Early in EMI, these houses were rebuilt or modified and the court surface relaid, while the entire northern slope was transformed into a series of wide east- west terraces, stepping down from around the level of the present Central Court to that of the present North Front. EMI-II deposits on these terraces have generally been seen as mixed fills, but most are stratified deposits in which floors and, more rarely, house architecture can be identified. An EMI house can be detected below and to the east of the North East Hall, via pottery from the 1903 and 1905 tests, walls sketched by Fyfe and walls still visible. Similarly, EMIIA or IIB structures are noted below the North Portico, around the North Lustral Area and below the North East Magazines. Study of a series of tests around the Early Keep revealed that these correspond to a massive and deep Middle Neolithic to FNI and EMI-III fill, which provides an EMIII terminus post quern for the construction of the Keep. Elsewhere around the hill there is evidence for additional, major terracing operations in EMIIAE and L, EMIIB, EM III and MMIA. The Central Court rests on a platform that probably reached its present extent during EMU. In 2009, a geophysical survey, conducted in collabo- ration with D. van der Roest (GT Frontline) and the Free University of Amsterdam, aimed to map and visualize the subsurface archaeological and geological deposits on the Kephala hill. The prospection system combined a trans- verse-mounted Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) antenna with Direct Contact continuous measurement of minor differences in the natural potential of the earth, giving very high-resolution shallow and deep measurement irrespective of the conductivity of the soil. Below the Central Court, the GPR detected a dense array of features at different depths down to ca. 4.5m. In the first, 0.5m below the surface, it is possible to observe one or perhaps two drainage systems, the southern retaining wall of the Court (reconstructed by Evans) and the position of tests dug by Evans and Mackenzie between 1901 and 1904. Also detectable are portions of walling that correlate with the FNIV house excavated by Evans and Mackenzie in 1924 and an earlier eastern retaining wall for the Central Court, immediately to the west of the present one and recorded on an early plan by Fyfe. Most enigmatic is a feature that appears to be on the same orien- tation as the court and thus may belong to an earlier phase of the Palace. Direct Contact data from the Central Court cannot be separated into specific depth slices, although image intensity gives an approximate indication of relative depth (lighter features being high, darker features low). Several features, familiar from the 0.5m GPR image, show up as intense pale features (e.g. a drainage pipe, early tests, terrace walls). However, the Direct Contact image also shows a set of very dark linear features absent in the GPR data and therefore probably deeper than ca. 4.5m. These are clearest below the southern half of the Central Court, where the walls of two large structures, oriented northeast-southwest and separated by a wide northeast- southwest passage, appear. In the middle of the Court, these dark linear features are interrupted by trench AC (excavated to bedrock by John Evans in 1957-1960), before resuming immediately to the north. The orien- tation of the two southern structures parallels the orien- tation of the contours of the bedrock in this area as well as the orientation of an Initial Neolithic wall, excavated in 1970 in trench X at the southern edge of the Central Court. It is thus highly likely that the two southern struc- tures belong to the very earliest phase of occupation at Knossos (ca. 7000-6500/6400 BC) and consequently are the earliest known farmer's dwellings in Greece. If so, the dark linear features on the Direct Contact image are likely to correspond to mud-brick architecture in use during the Initial and Early Neolithic. At present, the dark linear features beneath the northern half of the Court appear, on the basis of their relationship with mud-brick structures recorded in area AC, most likely date to the Early Neolithic. Images from other areas of the hill confirm that coherent, high-resolution imaging of walls and structures is not confined to the Central Court. Highlights include probable EMI structures immediately north of the North West Platform and a series of probable EMU structures beneath the western half of the Theatral Area and the Royal Road. Publication: H. Landenius Enegren, The People of Knossos: Prosopographical Studies in the Knossos Linear B Archives (Uppsala 2008). Demos of Kastelli Kastelli (K. Galanaki property). S. Mandilaki (23rd EPCA) reports on excavation conducted in 2000 ( ADelt55 [2000] Chr, 1019-21). Beneath an extensive mound of field-stones lay two Early Christian or Early Byzantine tombs, a stone-built water channel of the same period and a Minoan destruction layer with plentiful MMI-II pottery. The tombs are of somewhat makeshift construction and contained single inhumations in extended position without grave goods. The better-built one, of upright stones, housed a female burial; the other, probably for a male, was delineated by small stones in a row at the east and an earth/stone 'wall' at the north. Dating evidence is provided by the sherds collected from the vicinity. The water channel is contemporary with the stone mound: traced northwest-southeast for 2.9m, it is made of small stones, lined inside with plaster and covered with stone slabs (0.8m wide overall; channel 0.25m wide x 15m high internally). A bronze coin was found by the opening of the channel.</page><page sequence="186">186 DON EVELY The Minoan destruction level lies over stereo: it was not associated with architectural remains and appears to be a dump of domestic debris. Among large quantities of sherds, 27 intact or near-intact vessels (kalathoi, tripod vessels, jugs and conical cups) and local wares of the First Palace period were recovered, as well as an obsidian blade, a stone pounding tool and whetstone, and a clay cylin- drical weight. A pit dug into stereo was packed with sherds of the same period, as well as five whole conical cups of different sizes and some traces of burnt wood and bones. A segment of rough wall from a structure was also found beneath the stone mound. Smari. D. Hatzi-Vallianou (Archaeological Institute of Crete) reports on the 2000 season of excavation at this Bronze Age and Early Iron Age settlement, as well as on environmental studies, geological survey and conservation and presentation of the site as a whole ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1091-102, 1106-07). For references to other compa- rable and comprehensive annual accounts, cf. AR 49 (2002-2003), 83. On the upper acropolis, excavation of the central hearth in the main hall of Megaron B was completed and its supporting layers investigated: the stones of the hearth were then restored (Fig. 190). Megaron T (probably a guardhouse) has as its southern and eastern walls the acropolis circuit, and was probably a later addition, built onto the circuit wall. It has two entrances: excavation here revealed six stratified layers over bedrock with sherds, two loomweights, animal bones and seeds. The House of Athena yielded Early Minoan and Middle Minoan material below its paved floor and an early level with traces of fire. Numerous rooms were excavated within the acropolis, some attached to the circuit wall, others free-standing. Rough pavements and yard spaces are noted, as are pottery and stone tools. Minoan levels are often noted at lower depths (e.g. area Ml): often dated to MMII, they include pithos sherds, conical and carinated cups, jugs, stone tools and stone vases. Outside the acropolis, work continued on Megaron 2B, east of Megaron T and the acropolis circuit wall. A long rectangular form with three doors, it contained sherds and animal bones, stone tools, spindle-whorls and loomweights, as well as three bronze fish-hooks. The floor had charcoal and ash to the west, as did a bench there: the destruction can be dated to LMIIIC. Structures continued to be located on the southern slopes. Surface survey began in 1977 in a radius of 3km around the modern village, in combination with rescue excavation locating tens of new sites and monuments attesting to continuous exploitation from the Early Minoan period to the present day. In 1999-2000, the survey was extended into the wider area of the demos of Kastelli, with numerous Neolithic to modern sites recorded. Settlements, farmsteads, shrines and churches and cemeteries of Minoan and early historical times were well attested around the modern village and the hill of Profitis Ilias (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1112). Demos of Thrapsanos Galatas. G. Rethemiotakis (Herakleion Museum) reports on the 2000 season at the Palatial site and settlement ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 1016-19; cf.

The use of stones other than the more mundane sorts is noted - e.g. gypsum for pillar bases, schists for floors and limestone as in the lightwell of room 48b. Room 39, behind the entrance off the central court, has a plaster floor and a bench along the northern and western walls; it also had a large window (as does room 40) and two doors at the northeastern and southwestern corners. The large, rectangular room 42, with a plaster floor, had divisions at floor level in dressed stone: it was used for storage (a large jug remained), and had a gourna and a bench to the south. Several rooms here have windows onto the central court. Room 46 had a number of vases at its southeast, including an inscribed stirrup jar and animal bones. Room 45 has a bench on its southern side and traces of burning on its earthen floor, along with cups and juglets. Room 41, with a plaster floor, had a few vases and a stone offering table. Room 44, which had been cut off from the original circulation pattern before the site's destruction, produced LMIA pottery; above the floor was a layer of collapsed schist slabs from an upper floor. Room 47 contained vessels fallen from above, with plaques of limestone. The staircase in rooms 50-53 has a double placement for two flights, with associated gypsum bases, probably reflecting an original partition wall. The small unit 49 had many domestic vases. Corridor 52 leads to rooms 48(3-54, a typical Minoan hall with lightwell, colonnade and polythyron, a plaster floor and coloured-stone decoration (Fig. 191). The ashlar blocks of the lightwell and colonnade bear masons' marks (tridents, H and stars). Rooms 55 and 56 are clearly subsidiary to room 54: 55 had a plaster floor and a small rectangular hearth in the northwestern corner. From the southwestern corner of the lightwell, a door leads to room 48a where an ascending staircase is set in the middle. Broadly, the ceramics are LMIA in date, continuing to the destruction of the Palace. External parts of the complex were revealed to the east and west. To the east is a fine wall of dressed stone, in places up to 2m high. Much MMIIIB pottery was unearthed (having been dumped after an earthquake): this is mostly heavy domestic ware, but finer vessels are also represented, with cups in their hundreds in all the forms known in the Neopalatial repertoire being witness to feasting in the northern wing. To the west, between the Palace wing and the eastern side of building 2, was a small enclosed yard originally linked to the west entrance of the palace.</page><page sequence="187">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 187 191. Galatas: rooms 54 and 48(3. Galatas Survey. L.V. Watrous (ASCSA/Buffalo) reports on the final study season. Work concentrated on Early Iron Age and Byzantine to Ottoman pottery, and both chipped and ground stone tools. The Byzantine ceramic tradition represented a clear break from the Roman: shapes may continue (e.g. African Red Slip and LPC/Phoceaean Red Slip), but the fine, soft and orange Roman fabric is displaced by a darker and harder fired, much more micaceous one, perhaps as early as the seventh or eighth century AD. Imports then were few, comprising Constantinople White Wares, sgraffito, perhaps from northern Greece, and a sherd of 13th-century Zeuxippus ware. During the Ottoman period, imports included (Janakkale and Grottaglie wares, slip-painted wares from Didymoteicho, transfer-printed wares from Europe, and Chinese porcelain and its imitations. Demos of Tylissos Kavrochori. Ta Nea (06/03/10), Ethnos (01/10/09) and Eleftheros Typos (26/02/10) report the rescue excavation by A. Vasilakis (23rd EPCA) of an Early Iron Age tomb (1000-800 BC) begun in September 2009. The entrance to the single chamber (2.5m wide) was blocked by a large schist slab. Six cremation urns were recovered, out of a total of 84 vessels large and small (from amphorae to cups), along with faience beads, a metal pin and a 'killed' iron spearhead. An imported Cypriot vessel was also recovered. Demos of Tymbaki Agia Triada. V. La Rosa (SAIA/Catania) reports on the 2009 study season of material from old and recent excava- tions, particularly from the Casa delle sfere fittili o dei muri di argilla (hereafter Casa ... argilla) which was excavated in 1904-1905, 1912 and 1914, a lower status structure at the western border of the settlement, north of the large wall (Muraglione a denti) and south of superior buildings such as the Casa del Lebete. Material from room D of the West Building was also reviewed. Excavation was also carried out in the Casa ... argilla in 2009. The common goal of both study and excavation was the recovery of a LMIB phase after the destruction of the Villa, which has additional bearing on the nature and the stratigraphical autonomy of a phase which, like LMII, is otherwise known at both Ag. Triada and Phaistos from pottery in mixed deposits. The Casa ... argilla had two distinct architectural phases (the core of the earlier building lay in the northern part), and was almost certainly never structurally linked to the Casa del Lebete. In the southwestern corner (rooms 9- 10) of the later structure, which was partly investigated by Halbherr, an earlier floor corresponds to other floors both in this building and in the Casa del Lebete. A violent fire destroyed it: among vessels in the floor deposit was an amphora. An inverted tripod pot under the floor marked a foundation deposit. This destruction, as that of the Villa and the Casa del Lebete , dates to mature LMIB. Further, above the early floor a second floor was isolated, with small postholes (probably for some purpose connected with a craft installation). This had pottery, which, while LMIB, clearly heralds LMII in some forms and decoration. It is suggested that such finds indicate a swift reoccupation after the main LMIB destruction and abandonments elsewhere here. Reinterpretation of structures excavated by Halbherr has permitted the distinction of a third phase of construction of great importance. The erstwhile room 10 of the Casa ... argilla is now interpreted as a stepped altar, such as that seen on the painted sarcophagus from this site. A stone-filled rectangular platform (1.75m x 1.3m), it had an extension to the west and probably a couple of steps (Fig. 192). Stratigraphical and architectural concerns date it to LMII. It is seen as a rededication of the once residential area, amidst a sea of ruins. This was followed in LMIIIA1 by the construction of shrine E, just to the east of the ruined Casa del Lebete. The process of reclamation was taken further in LMIIIA2 with the creation of the large Casa dei vani aggiunti progressivamente , partly over the Casa del Lebete. With this went the abandonment of shrine E, replaced by that to the southeast of the original Villa (with its painted marine-life floor). Kommos. J.W. Shaw and M.C.

Longo (SAIA/Salerno) report on the continuation of survey in and around the town in 2008-2009, in collaboration with the 23rd EPCA. A local network was established to enable effective use of GIS referencing and to combine it with other bodies of information such as structures located on the hill of Kastro and the Middle Acropolis, the building at Ag. Georgios at Phalandra, the Hellenistic walls on Christos Effendi, the neighbourhood of Chalara, the section of road north of the Phaestian Tavern, the Hellenistic complex at the southern foot of the hill of the palace and the remains of Minoan and Hellenistic structures near the road to Matala (excavation at Ag. Ioannis). At Marathovigla, Geometric material was discovered in the course of survey. More intensive survey was conducted at two locations: on the hill southeast of the palace and immediately south of Ag. Ioannis. At the first site, structures still partly visible as well as material provisionally classified as Minoan and Hellenistic attest to the existence of a densely- populated area close to the Matala road and immediately north of the cemetery at Ag. Pavlos. The scant evidence of the intervening periods includes a Cretan Late Geometric aryballos (late eighth- to seventh-century BC) and a Late Archaic black-figure fragment. In the second area, close the so-called Baths, the remains of a Roman structure in cocciopesto , not mentioned in the literature, have been identified, as well as displaced limestone blocks perhaps from the southern section of the fortifications. The pottery collected here is mainly Roman and Byzantine in date. Pitsidia. D. Hatzi-Vallianou reports on a subsidiary season of excavation in 2000 at a Minoan rural villa, ahead of the creation of a cover for the site ( ADelt55 [2000] Chr, 1102-05, 1108-11). Tests to the east and west showed walls, Middle Minoan sherds and the occasional stone tool or vase fragment. It seems that a First Palace period settlement existed in the area, and that it was levelled and filled for the construction of the new villa. The ceramics display typical Phaistian features. The recovery of good quality Classical and Early Hellenistic pottery to the southeast argues for a community of this date in that region. Surface survey in 1999-2000 has expanded the results obtained from earlier work in 1978: it has shown the region to have been continuously settled from Neolithic times to the present day.

Sakellarakis (ASA) reports {Ergon [2009], 72-73) on the excavation of a burial cave, the second to be located on the Psiloritis massif. The cave holds a LMIIIA2 warrior burial. Remains of at least three people were recovered, much damaged (as were other finds) by rock falls and the activities of shepherds. The sides and cover of a larnax were recovered, with abundant pottery including stirrup jars, jugs, cups and conical cups, a kylix and a jug; blossom and pithoid-shaped vases also occur. Metal finds are a wire bracelet, a pin and a ring- band; a steatite whorl was also recovered. Under the vases and small finds, a pit contained a bronze knife and spearhead, three bronze vessels and two monochrome clay cups, one footed. These seem to have been placed there in the course of the funerary rites and before the larnax was positioned. Zominthos. Y. Sakellarakis reports on continuing excava- tions in 2009 at this upland centre {Ergon [2009], 68-72). Three goals were pursued: the investigation of rooms 14 and 15 at the northwest, along with 19 and 28 to their immediate south; that of room 29; and that of the north- eastern part of the Central Building which had been disturbed by looters. Work in rooms 14 and 15 focused on the consolidation of vulnerable walls, removing fill and tumble to reveal the lower courses in position. Numerous vases of several forms, including conical cups (fallen from above), 12 cups and a juglet, were recovered, as well as querns. In room 19, a pile of large stones and flat slabs at the east came from a collapsed stairway to the upper floor. Finally, in the southeastern part of room 28 was a quantity of pots; 11 cups (mostly conical), an amphora, a bucket and a base sherd with a mat impression. Various ornaments were also found: a bronze heart-shaped pendant which should be associated with two beads of carnelian and agate, finds which belong to the previous period, a pin, and a large piece of rock-crystal. To the west in the same room fallen floor slabs of schist came from the upper storey, along with a few conical cups, a jug and a grinder. Investigations of the southeast corner of the Central Building, damaged by looters, produced animal bones, carbon and one kalathiskos. In room 29 to the north, part of a more recent wall and a bronze arrowhead were found, and, in a deeper level, a series of paving or wall slabs, two conical cups and parts of six fruitstands. A more recent wall was also found in the western part of room 29. Demos of Arkadi Arkadi Monastery. M.

The stables, to the west of the monastery, are typically late Venetian in style; the 'cheese-dairy', to the north, is a simple 19th-century AD structure; the raki- distilling room is also early 19th century in date; finally, a footpath and spring area lie to the north. Chamalevri. M. Andreadaki-Vlazaki (then Director, 25th EPCA, now Director of Antiquities, Ministry of Culture and Tourism) reports on work undertaken at four localities in 2000 (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1031-32). Between 1998 and 2000, Minoan wall footings were located over a distance of 32m at the northeastern foot of the Kakavella hill (Lambiris-Vasileiadis field); another wall lay to the north, seemingly marking off an open space. Beneath a thick layer of debris were the remains of a Middle Minoan workshop: associated finds included 11 clay vases (mostly conical cups), loomweights, obsidian, stone vases and a clay figurine. At Palaioloutra on the southern site of the Kakavella hill (Kallergis field) is a MMII to LMIIIB settlement, with further MMI and LMIIIC1 building remains opposite on the eastern flank of the Tsikouriana hill. Close to the latter is Konostasi (Skepetzis field), where architectural remains (part of a room and a cobbled road) were confined to the northwestern part of the field. Finds comprise five clay vases (four conical cups and a one- handled cup), obsidian, a loomweight, bronze and clay items. Finally, Hellenistic material (including terracotta loomweights, cups, stone querns, obsidian and a lead clamp) was found on the south of the same hill, at Dagkouliana (Deredakis field). Eleutherna. Ethnos (28/08/09), Ta Nea (28/08/09), Eleftherotypia (28/08/09) and Apogevmatini (28/08/09) report on the 25th season of excavation by N. Stambolidis (Crete/Museum of Cycladic Art). Particular reference is made to three eight-century BC burials from the cemetery at Orthi Petra. A rectangular structure ( ca . 3-3. 5m long) with walls standing to a height of 2.1m - effectively a built chamber tomb complete with door - was constructed in an area previ- ously utilized for Mycenaean tombs (17th- to 10th- century BC). Some late eighth- to early seventh-century pottery was located ca. lm above the floor. On the floor were three female skeletons in close proximity, one 65-70 years of age, the others around 16-17. Organic remains indicate some form of cloth cover, adorned with faience beads and gold foil ornament. Rich grave goods include scarabs of Egyptian Blue, seals of amber and rock-crystal (their motifs often hark back to earlier times: double-axes, deer, horses, starfish and squid), bronze bracelets, brooches, earrings and hair ornaments. The gold jewellery is notable, being decorated with granulation and inset stones (now all lost). Some are pendants, like the Daedalic female heads and the tortoise, and other larger pieces may be pectorals: some depict lions and carry meander motifs. Over the structure were remains of pyres of later date (similar to others found in the area) and other types of burials, including that of two small hunting dogs. The tally of burials at Eleutherna has now reached some 400. Publication: P.G. Themelis (ed.), Ancient Eleutherna: Sector 1. Vol. 1 (Athens 2009). E.

Kapranos (25th EPCA) reports on the excavation of an unplundered Minoan chamber tomb (AWiC 1 [2010], 476-89) of typical type (an irregular rectangular chamber with a domed roof and a long dromos). There are several such isolated LMIII tombs in this region. One person was interred in a larnax at the northern side, along with 21 ceramic vessels and one of stone, concen- trated at the southeast and, to a degree, southwest (Fig. 193). The larnax is footed and decorated. One long side has two octopuses flanking a central group of two double-axes and horns of consecration set over an 'altar' pattern; the other an arrangement of the latter two symbols. The stone vase is a Blossom Bowl, an heirloom from Neopalatial times. Clay vessels include an amphoroid krater with octopus design with its stand (also with octopuses and spirals), a thilastron, a kalathos, an incense burner, an alabastron, an amphora, two kylikes, three shallow bowls, two conical cups, a spouted cup and three miniatures - a bridge-spouted jug, a stirrup jar and a flask (Fig. 194). They date to LMIIIA2, perhaps tending to LMIIIB. 193. Pigi: larnax burial. Viran Episkopl. N. Pyrrou (28th EBA) reports on excavation and restoration conducted in 2008 at the three- aisled church of Ag. Demetrios ( AWiC 1 [2010], 543-55). The irregularities of the plan and the obvious additions attest to more than four structural phases, during most of which the building was used as a bath (from the Middle Byzantine era). Evidence for this original use includes cisterns, holes in the roof and pipes in the walls. The original, rectangular structure (central and south aisles) was elaborated towards the end of its life as a bath, the newer north aisle itself having at least two phases. The floors were of tiles and plaster, and the walls plastered and painted red and yellow. The transformation into a church may be roughly dated by the gothic doorway (mid 15th century AD), though the lack of ceramic evidence makes dating imprecise. Alterations were undertaken in the Venetian period. Some tombs were located below the floors. Demos of Geropotamos Charakas. E. Theocharopoulou reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1059-62) on excavations and repairs to the fortress of Charaki near Kophinas. The fortification wall (which is double on the western side, but absent on the eastern where the terrain was natural defensive) enclosed a long hall with three rooms;</page><page sequence="190">190 DON EVELY 194. Pigi: pottery from the larnax burial. the northern room contains a water cistern, partly dug into the ground, on the eastern side. There are three rectan- gular, two-storeyed towers, two of which are attached to the long hall at the northwest and southwest, and the last of which is free-standing to the east. At the south is a small church with frescoes. The fortifications began to be put in place in the second Byzantine period and were remodelled during the Venetian period in the fronte bastionato manner of the 16th century. The central hall for the garrison was erected at this time. The Ottoman period saw more alterations, the last noted dating to the early 18th century. Melidoni. I. Gavrilaki (25th EPCA) reports on excavation in the Gerontospilios cave from 1987-2008 (AWiC 1 [2010], 657-69). The cave was used for habitation in the Final Neolithic/Early Minoan era, whilst from the Middle Minoan to the second- to first-century BC cult activities were dominant. The first phase, a yellow soil over the bedrock, is represented by typical occupation debris: stone tools and axes, obsidian and bone tools, as well as a wide range of pottery including storage vessels. Later evidence shows varying foci of activities spread throughout the cave interior. Indications of fires of varying sizes (around which lie conical cups, jugs and jars, and cooking pots) stand alongside heaps of stones and more deliberate arrangements of slabs (like TTs) which are usually Middle Minoan to Late Minoan in date. A large stalagmite to the north attracted numbers of mouldmade female figurines ( ca . 680-600 BC), and then seated females and lamps of the third to fourth century BC. Roman bone pins also appear here. A very large collection of mixed figurine types of Bronze Age and later date underline the devotional aspect of the cave's use. Other finds typical of Hellenistic and Roman contexts include horns of deer and goat, lamps and astragaloi. The focus of this worship may have altered by the second to first century BC, when inscriptions mention the god Hermes. The latest activity is also situated more towards the cave mouth. From the 15th century AD onwards, large numbers of graffiti and inscrip- tions record the names and dates of visitors of many nations. Pera Galinoi. E. Tsivilika (National Museum, Athens) and E. Banou (25th EPCA) report on the second season of excavation on the Minoan peak sanctuary in 2000 ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 1032-34). The aim was to excavate completely the rooms begun in 1993. Slight subsidence in the schist pavement of room 2 was due to the presence of a small space below (room 2a); this had a medial wall and conical cups on a floor that showed traces of burning. Below room 1 was a similar space (room 3), again with a medial wall. The upper fill contained large schist slabs from the ceiling of room 3/floor of room 1. Traces of wood inside the west wall might indicate an access ladder. In lower levels of the fill of the room, alternating red and brown soils may derive from mud-brick. In the southeastern corner, an L-shaped installation of two rows of mud-brick, earth and a plaster coating may perhaps be a couch. Other fittings of mud- brick and phyllite are recorded. It is suggested that this room might be a forerunner of the Lustral Basin; a lamp was found and, on the floor, two conical cups. Room 6 yielded a whitewashed earthen bench on its southern and western walls. On it and the paved floor were conical cups. Room 8 held a broad staircase (over 2m wide) with nine steps and three landings. Room 8a continues the sloping arrangement of the architecture to the southeast: at</page><page sequence="191">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 191 the east is a paved corridor. By means of a pair of steps it links the stairs of room 8 to the west with yet another stairway to the south. This stairway, with five steps, is defined by walls on its two sides, much damaged by an earthquake. The fill on the stairs produced traces of fire (carbon and ash) and much pottery (cooking wares, tripod pots, conical and one-handled cups, as well as a Kamares- style piece with white banding). Also present are animal bones, agrimi horns, jaws and teeth, seashells and urchin spines. Plaster is mostly left white, but there is evidence of solid red and brown, as well as some polychromy. Lastly, metal finds include bronze tools (points and fish- hooks) and gold foil. Southwest lies room 8(3 with a similar fill and finds. Room 12 is a double narrow corridor, with walls at times 2m high, with the western side covered in lime plaster; finds include a clay rhyton, conical cups and two stone offering tables. It is noted that various openings in this room had been bricked up and plastered over. Perama. A. Phraidaki (28th EBA) reports on the excavation between 2004-2006 of a three-aisled basilica at Palaiokklisia (AWiC 1 [2010], 532-42) (Fig. 195). Excavation was taken down to the floor levels, with only the narthex (at the west) unexcavated. There are two main constructional phases: the earlier traces are relatively modest and detectable by the use of field-stones and sturdy lime plaster. The later consists of most of what is visible today, often building on the earlier wall-lines: this probably includes the floors. Re-used masonry includes a limestone column and two more of marble. Below the destruction debris (stones, bricks and plaster), the nave floor is paved with rectangular marble slabs, the south aisle with bricks and the north again of marble slabs. Built benches exist in all aisles. The monument is simple, with no mosaics. A very late cist grave of a child was found set in the north aisle. Nearby was the cruciform baptisterion: shallow, paved in marble, with a drainage pipe at the north and a few steps down to enter the area at the west. Much vessel glass was found mixed with the debris at the east. Most of the pottery from the north aisle dates between the early fifth and early seventh centuries AD. This suggests a parallel with the sixth-century baptisterion in Panormo; certain internal arrangements are reminiscent of those at Fodele of the fifth to sixth century AD. 195. Perama: basilica. Finds include the bronze container of an oil lamp, iron sheet and nails, glass and two Early Byzantine bronze coins of Eleutherna (of the reign of Constantine IV, AD 668-685). Burial evidence has been detected east of the north aisle. The re-used pillars suggest the existence of Roman and Late Roman structures in the area. The date of the original construction is unknown. After an early fifth-century AD earthquake there must have been an immediate rebuild as pottery of that date appears throughout. In the mid sixth century the floors were laid in their present form and the baptisterion erected. The final destruction is poorly understood, but is probably due to the strong earthquake in the seventh century. It remains possible that the nave was rebuilt and continued in use, whilst the aisles remained in ruins. Demos of Kouloukonas Axos. E. Tegou (25th EPCA) reports on excavations at several spots on the acropolis in 2005-2006 ( AWiC 1 [2010], 490-97). On the northern side, at Ag. Ioannis, architectural remains (walls and pebble floors) were visible in fields south of the church. One demarcated a threshing floor, the others cobbled surfaces and destruction debris of tiles. The pottery dates from the Late Minoan period to modern. A pair of late Christian cist graves was excavated. Walls of another five rooms were found on the northern slopes, amidst a wide range of (mostly Byzantine) pottery and a fragment of a Hellenistic inscription. To the southeast lies a Venetian aqueduct into which an honorary inscription of the first century BC to the first century AD had been built. A hoard of nine coins of the city-state of Axos dating to 200-175 BC were found, as well as four later Hellenistic, six Roman, one Byzantine and two Venetian coins. At Sto Mouri, Venetian architecture was uncovered, as well as three terracotta animal figurines similar to those recovered from the open-air sanctuary of Demeter at Stou Gerakaro to the west. From Madopa, chance finds of an amphora, a perfume bottle and an aryballoid lekythos revealed the presence nearby of an Early Hellenistic cemetery (mid fourth- to early third-century BC). In 2008, geophysical survey at a number of separate locations succeeded in identifying the exact location of the lost Temple of Aphrodite. Demos of Kourites Phourphouras. P. Varthalitou (28th EBA) reports on restoration from 2007 onwards at the Church of the Virgin in a ruined monastic setting ( AWiC 1 [2010], 556-67). This small church was shown to have two construction phases; architectural alterations in the early 18th century AD included the use of 'accoustic' pots (the vessels themselves being re-used from late in the previous century). The surviving frescoes in the east of the building date to the original construction in the last decades of the 14th century AD: one main hand and at least one assistant can be detected. A painted inscription of five lines (white on black) on the north wall records the name of Nicholas Arkoleo, after whom the settlement was once named. At the west, a simple stone-built tomb yielded a bronze coin, probably a tornesello of Michael Steno (Doge 1400-1413).</page><page sequence="192">192 DON EVELY Demos of Lappa Argyroupoli. M. Andrianakis (then 13th EBA, now Director, 13th EBA and 28th EBA) reports on restoration and excavation in 2000 at the single-aisled church of Ag. Kyriaki ( ADelt55 [2000] Chr , 1083). A Roman bath here was converted into a church: the original walls are visible nearby and incorporated into the secondary structure. Two layers of wall-painting are evident, the more recent belonging to the first decades of the 13th century AD. A medieval cemetery was located within the walls of the earlier bath. Demos of Phoinika Plakias Mesolithic Survey. T. Strasser (ASCSA/Providence), P. Murray (ASCSA/Boston), E. Panagopoulou (EPSNE), C. Runnels (ASCSA/Boston) and N. Thompson (EPSNE) report on the findings of two seasons of survey. Numerous reports have appeared both in the Greek press (e.g. Kathimerini [17/02/10], Ethnos [20/01/10], Eleftheros Typos [12/01/10]) and in foreign periodicals (e.g Archaeology May/June 2010, 9). Twenty eight sites associated with caves or rock- shelters have been investigated in the area from Plakias to the Preveli gorge and around Ag. Pavlos. Of 2,139 lithic artefacts, microliths of Mesolithic type come from 20 sites, with Palaeolithic from nine locations. At Preveli 2, 3 and 8, finds from both groups were made, but such overlaps do not usually occur. The targeted methodology, the site distributions and the basic definitions of the industries have been discussed in AR 55 [2008-2009], 98-99. Most scatters yielded 80- 100 artefacts, some (e.g. Schinaria 1) number in the thousands. Locally available cobbles of quartzite and chert as well as massive quartz were exploited: all can be knapped. Chert occurs only in the Mesolithic assemblages and in small quantities: it is arguably brought in from elsewhere. The Mesolithic artefact clusters are found in front of small caves or rock-shelters, and are limited in size and yield. The full range of assemblages (cores, debitage and retouched tools) suggest residence for long enough to acquire the raw materials and reduce them to tools. The largest collection was made at Schinaria 1; 564 artefacts were selected from several thousand pieces visible on the surface (Fig. 196). The assemblage consists almost entirely of quartz artefacts, and is rich in cores and retouched tools. The latter include notches and denticu- lates, pieces with retouch, geometric microliths, spines (piercers and borers of various types), truncations and small end scrapers. The Plakias industry has affinities with both the Lower Mesolithic (Lithique Phase VII) and the Upper Mesolithic (Lithique Phase VIII) at Franchthi Cave, but it would be hazardous to attribute any sites to one or other of these specific phases. The Palaeolithic material is found downslope from rock-shelters, eroding out of associated conglomerates or trapped beneath them in pockets of sediment amongst limestone outcrops. Terrarossa earths, both in situ and more extensive in distribution, or even redeposited, may contain lithic artefacts (e.g. Preveli 3 to a depth of lm or more). A typical example might be seen in Timeos Stavros 4: here a debris flow appears to be preserved in a field below a limestone fault scarp. In an area of approximately 40m x 90m, a large concentration of stone tools was found mingled with angular pieces of limestone and travertine, suggesting a derivation from the caves and rock-shelters upslope. The lithic artefacts may belong to more than one Palaeolithic industry, including, in traditional terms, the Lower and Middle Palaeolithic (Fig. 197). These indus- 196.

Considerable variability in the morphological tool types suggests opportunism in the selection of flake blanks and edges for retouch. Many blanks have only one edge retouched, often partially and discontinuously, frequently bifacially. Raw material was plentiful and there was much expediency in the use of blanks and a tendency to discard tools after only short periods of use. The Palaeolithic materials resemble the Acheulean sensu lato : this may be defined as consisting of large flakes used to configure big tools, with a diversity of morphotypes of small retouched tools and standardized knapping methods, among which the bifacial centripetal technique of core reduction stands out. The Acheulean may have a high frequency of large-sized flakes as blanks for the production of bifaces, the use of side-struck or corner struck flakes, the presence of techniques involving prede- termination ('approximate Levallois patterns'), attempts to thin the bifaces in the area of the bulb of percussion and a minimal investment in bifacial retouch. These descrip- tions would serve for the artefacts from Plakias. Some cores and bifacial scrapers, however, resemble Middle Palaeolithic artefacts and it cannot be ruled out that we are dealing with more than one Palaeolithic industry or facies in Crete. Demos of Rethymno Agia Irini. M. Andrianakis reports on work on the three- aisled church ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1085). Where the katholikon now stands, traces of an earlier and smaller church, with wall-painting, have been recovered. Agia Irini settlement. N. Karamaliki (25th EPCA) reports on excavation in a Hellenistic settlement (AWiC 1 [2010], 512-24) of the early third to late second century BC. Sited on a hilltop, it is defined to the north by a fortification wall of isodomic masonry. Beyond probably lay the cemeteries, to judge from scattered pieces of funerary vases, such as lamps. In the Koulakis plot lay a building terraced to follow the slope of the land (higher to the west). Parts of two rooms were excavated, with a further two less well under- stood: typically the walls are set on bedrock and still stand quite high; better dressed stone serves for jambs and thresholds, the floors are beaten earth and the roofs tiled. Room 1 has a squared stone base (perhaps to support a beam) by the east wall, a stone hearth and a large quern set just west of the doorway. These, plus the tablewares, suggest that food was prepared here. A terracotta model of two standing warriors armed with shield and spear on a support frame shows that other activities were practised in the area, as is also suggested by the presence of a column krater, a lamp and more than five braziers. To the east, room 2 is a storeroom with a covered drain set below the earth floors (of which three can be recognized). At the southwest, a structure built of stone slabs may be a hearth; in the centre of the room is a structure of four slabs with a hole within. To the south and east, eight or more pithoi and four amphorae are set by the walls, and of the 56 loomweights found in the room, 16 were inside a smashed pithos. The pottery from room 1 (especially the oinochoe and phiale) reveals clear ties to Knossos: other Cretan tradi- tions are strong in such shapes as cylindrical cups. Indeed, the braziers seem to recall the Minoan era. The structure was in use for about a century from the late third to the late second century BC. On the Koulakis-Liodakis plot, two walls (north and south) of a room were found, with hints of the east wall preserved in the rock. At the centre of the room was a hearth, with a stone cylinder to its east. Outside, under a stone pile, a cistern was cut into the bedrock; this was probably covered with hydraulic cement. Associated pottery indicates its use in the second century BC. Further settlement remains were found on the Politakis plot, comprising at least four covered spaces with a large yard to their east. Room A had destruction debris (tiles and stone) over its largely earth floor; stone slabs had been set on this surface at the northwest, with a small stone bench to the south and two further stone slabs, all perhaps to accommodate the storage vessels retrieved. What may be a stone hearth lay inside the entrance; vases, loomweights and burnt wood were recovered at the north. Along with the storage pithoi, the plain domestic wares (basins, jugs, plates and cups) date to the third century BC. A similar picture pertains in rooms D and E to the north. The yard had a rock surface sloping slightly to the east, into which were cut three small, rectangular pits running parallel to the wall and ca. 0.5m from it, which may have held wooden uprights for a lean-to shelter. Finally, on the Spandagos plot to the north, three walls of a room were recovered plus a little pottery of the late second century BC. Rethymnon. M Andrianakis reports on the continuing restoration in 2000 of the Fortetsa that dominates the town ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1077-80). He comments on the broad structural appearance and history of the East Gate Complex, the Rector's Palace, the Councillors' Lodge and the Bastion of Ag. Loukas. Evidence of a Hellenistic settlement below is known. Vrysinas. G. Kordatzaki (University of Crete) reports on the initial results of macroscopic and microanalysis of the ceramic fabrics found in the Vrysinas Survey ( AWiC 1 [2010], 464-75). Material from two chronological phases was selected for comparison and contrast. The first set - from the Middle Minoan Peak Sanctuary - is characterized by a wide range of fabric compositions and is believed to represent local production by the various populations who gathered there. The second - LMIIIC and Early Geometric pottery from the surrounding slopes - has a much more restricted range of fabric recipes; high concentrations of calcium in some are thought to reflect social dynamics within the catchment area. In technical terms, this latter period also marks a distinct change in the preparation of the clays themselves. Quite coarse sand and gravel are now employed as temper within the Ca-richer mixes: their grain size covers a wide range and is not especially evenly distributed. It is suggested that this effect is due to the quarrying of alluvial sediments after strong flooding and similar actions had laid them down. Such events may have caused damage to the lowlands, thus encouraging the movement of peoples to higher altitudes.</page><page sequence="194">194 DON EVELY Demos of Sybritos Amari. M. Andrianakis reports on the work done in 2000 at the Church of Zoodochos Pigis ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1080). The original form of the church was a cross-in-a- square; later a single-aisled chapel was added to the northwest. Subsequent collapses and reconstructions created a final amalgam that marries a three-aisled basilica with pillars to a cruciform-based structure. The Gothic doorframe at the south suggests a late 14th-century date for this. The few wall-painting fragments visible in the chapel date to the mid 13th century. Nephs Amari. M. Andrianakis reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1080-82) on work done in 2000 at the single-aisled church of Ag. Anna, where a smaller vaulted church was added at the southern side. The original form of the structure and the nature of the subsequent building phases were revealed: the north wall was rebuilt in the later 13th century AD, while the visible wall-paintings are of the second Byzantine period, with evidence of the flourishing local traditions of the 12th century AD remaining. Ano Meros. M. Andrianakis reports on restoration work in 2000 at the Monastery of the Saviour Kaloeidenas {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1085). In an exterior space by the katholikon, simple pit graves of the 16th to 17th century AD were discovered. Veni. E. Tegou reports on excavation on this upland plateau conducted in 2006, south of the Venetian Church of Christ the Saviour (AWiC 1 [2010], 525-31). Parts of two rooms were found in separate areas. In the first (Tr 5), a lamp, a pithos, a loomweight and part of a stone vase were retrieved from within the corner angle of two walls. From similar circumstances in the second (Tr 9), destruction debris contained a bronze lamp, three coins (of Eleutherna, Rethymnon and perhaps Sybrita), seven clay vases and 21 loomweights of varied shapes. The coins and the vases (which are mostly domestic wares) indicate a second- century BC date. A total of 96 loomweights was recorded. Patso. V. Niniou-Kindeli (25th EPCA) reports on continued restoration and excavation at the Sanctuary of Hermes Kranaios conducted in 2000 ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1035-37). The goals were the complete exposure of the ancient temple, the improvement of its surroundings and the protection of the Christian shrine of Ag. Antonios. The recovery of large and undisturbed (if often mingled) levels of pre-Christian ceremonial deposits produced a large quantity and quality of finds. The earliest material is Middle Minoan. To the north lay a concen- tration of Hellenistic and Roman material, as already known from earlier excavation. The natural slope is here sufficiently great to cause erosion from the top, where the Hellenistic pyres were placed. Vases, often of small size, were recovered, being mostly cups for liquids in Hellenistic times, then Roman lamps. In the rock-shelter, under debris from the present shrine, were thick layers of a sacrificial nature dating from earlier periods. Minoan deposits, of basically comparable character, were located in the present-day central area. Thronos. N. Karamaliki (25th EPCA), L. Rocchetti and A-L. D'Agata (CNR) report on the continuing Greek- Italian excavations in 2000 at Thronos Kephala ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1034-35; partly reported in AR 47 [2000- 2001], 143). Three areas were investigated on the central, northern and southern plateaux. The main aims were to establish the limits of these zones of activity, especially those of the ritual pits in the central plateau and of the Early Iron Age settlement on the northern. Building 3, with its LMIIIC floor with a hearth and Protogeometric and Geometric destruction deposits, produced a stone basin with a low relief swordfish (a motif seen on contem- porary pithoi). WESTERN CRETE (Nomos of Chania) (25th EPCA: 28th EBA) Demos of Armenoi Armenoi. M. Andrianakis reports on restoration in 2000 at the single-aisled church of Ag. Ioannis Theologos (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1071). Re-use of late Christian architectural elements in marble was revealed, as was the existence of an older church. Simple pit graves were located under the floor. Stylos (Nikolakakis field). M. Andreadaki-Vlazaki (then Director, 25th EPCA, now Director of Antiquities, Ministry of Culture and Tourism) reports on excavation conducted in 2000 in a late antique hilltop community (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1028). In the extensive spread of the settlement, a destruction horizon is marked by collapsed roof tiles and plentiful ceramics (often small vessels such as cups). Demos of Chania Among the activities of the 25th EPCA reported in ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 1026-27, we note the display of the Mitsotakis Collection within the extended exhibition area at Chania Museum. Alikianos. Ch. Bourbou (TDPEAE-Chania) reports on the excavation in 2007-2008 of graves associated with the three-aisled Church of Zoodochos Pigi (AWiC 1 [2010], 754-66). Of the 77 tombs investigated, 21 were inside, mainly in the narthex, with the others lying close to the walls all around the exterior. Fifty were cist graves, roughly rectan- gular and wider at the head, built of stones or a mix of stone and tiles, with stone covering slabs and earthen floors. Tomb 1 was larger and probably served as an ossuary, to judge from the mixed skeletal remains. Eleven were pit tombs: simple holes with rounded corners, but still at times covered with slabs. Eight were tile tombs: simple covering slabs or with tiles on their sides as a A. Most were single burials, but 23 were multiple burials in which earlier interments were displaced. Thirty nine were burials of sub-adults. The deceased was placed directly onto the earth floor (some may have lain on wooden biers to judge from the presence of nails, e.g. 12 in tomb 54), supine, with the upper limbs arranged in various ways. Stones might be used to support the head or the jaw. Grave goods were rare, with just 22 items (of jewellery, clothing and coins) registered, half accompanying adults. Tomb 54</page><page sequence="195">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 195 contained four glass and three bronze bracelets, a necklace and a pair of silver earrings; the only ceramic vessel was placed over the face. Preliminary dating indicates the late 11th to 12th century AD, though the coins found allow some burials to be Venetian or even Ottoman. Chania Co-operative Bank property. E. Kataki (25th EPCA) reports on excavations conducted in 2005-2006 ( AWiC 1 [2010], 709-18; Kania/Kydonia 21, 96-107). Ancient remains had been badly damaged by modern foundations: largely pits and wells remained, with some settlement features to the west and north. Ottoman clay pipes and glazed wares were collected. A Classical to Hellenistic structure with at least three phases (late fourth to late third/early second century BC) was found with beaten earth floors, into which amphorae were sunk in two rooms. In a room at the southwest, a number of loomweights lying on the floor marked the position of a loom. A cobbled area contained a water-pipe to its south and a cistern for water management. Associated pottery, and that found in contemporary pits, includes a wide range of domestic equipment - amphorae, pots, basins, plates and lamps. There are many stamped amphora handles and even a potter's name (TTAYZANIA), as well as loomweights and terracotta figurines of seated figures of the sort most often found in tombs and sanctuaries. During the Early Iron Age and Archaic to Classical period (eighth to fifth century BC), the site seems to have been a refuse area, with 10 associated pits. Beneath lie Minoan structural remains, with two to three pits: three phases can be determined between EMU and MMIA. The walls lie on or slightly sunk into the bedrock; with the exception of two paved examples the floors are earthen, and the enclosed areas may have been open to the air. One floor, associated with a MMIA pithos in the next room, had traces of a clay hearth; outside was a cobbled way. A large EMU structure is also visible, set in a deep foundation trench with plastered walls on the interior, associated with which were jugs, 'egg-cups' and basins; also tools including obsidian and a Neolithic stone axe. 27 Kritovoulidou Street (G. Spyridakis property). M. Andreadaki-Vlazaki reports on a rescue excavation conducted in 2000 (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1027). Two chamber tombs were located adjacent to a LMIIIA/B cemetery (on the Rovithakis plot) recovered in 1996. Only the well-made dromos of tomb A, to the northeast, could be excavated, as the remainder of the tomb lay under a neighbouring plot. Tomb B, ca. 6m to the southeast, has a steep dromos, the stone blocking of which had been disturbed by tomb-robbers. The chamber contained two burials accompanied by a LMIIIB stirrup jar, a one-handled cup, many small stone beads from a necklace, plus a gold bead and bronze tweezers. To the south, ca. 13.3m west of tomb B, was the start of the dromos of tomb f (which lay entirely under the neigh- bouring plot). Phirka fort. M. Andrianakis reports on excavation and continuing repairs to the fort of Rivellino del Porto ( ADelt 55 [2000] B2, 1065). In continuous use since its construction under Enrico Pescatore in the early 13th century AD, it has undergone many alterations. It was initially built on two levels (the piazza alta and piazza bassa). On the upper level is a large vaulted cistern and a large (once-paved) courtyard; below, successive drainage systems removed rain-water from the fort. The latest of these drainage systems was built of the Vesuvian black stone known to have been used in the harbour works of the late 19th century. Kastelli. fY. Spantidaki and Chr. Moulherat (Paris) report on the results of the examination by scanning electron microscope of a small strip of cloth from the Ag. Aikaterina Square excavations in 2006 ( AWiC 1 [2010], 696-708). The cloth was found inside a tripod pyxis on the floor of room C, house IV, a building which, like all its contemporaries, was destroyed by a fierce fire in LMIB. The fibres used in its manufacture are identified as linen for the warp and goat's hair for the weft, with a supple- mentary thread of nettle fibres. Odos Katre. M. Andreadaki-Vlazaki reports on further excavation in 2009 (Ministry of Culture and Tourism press release [02/02/10], cited by To Vima , Ta Nea , Eleftherotypia , Apogevmatini , Ethnos, Expres, Kathimerini, Eleftheros Typos , and Nautemboriki [03/02/10]). The west entrance of the Mycenaean palatial instal- lation (LMIIIB) has now been recognized. Part of it is a large external yard with a 0.05m deep plaster floor with boundaries as yet unknown. The worked stone blocks, mud-bricks and a column base collapsed into it indicate the presence of an important structure nearby; traces of a collapsed wooden structure are also visible. The yard was also the scene of sacrificial activity: as well as burnt seeds, finds to date include numerous bones of sheep/goat, a pig and two oxen, all uncooked. They have been variously covered in stones. Along with them, and accorded the same treatment, are parts of a young woman. The hypothesis that this last represents a human sacrifice is still under careful consideration; other commentators have pointed out the growing list of candidates for such behaviour, e.g. Anemospilia and Knossos on Crete, Mycenae, Prosymna, Argos and Dendra on the mainland. The final destruction debris in the yard contained part of a Linear B tablet with a male name: earlier debris strewn even later contained part of a Linear A tablet and an inscribed roundel. Elsewhere, a rectangular structure with a frescoed exterior may be an altar. To its south, and over a yard floor, five pairs of agrimi horns and four pots of local manufacture lay amidst a burnt deposit. This event can be thus dated to the early 13th century BC, forming yet another instance of widespread fire destruction in the settlement at this time. Publication: M.

Fiolitaki (28th EBA) reports on excavations conducted between 2005-2007 at an Early Byzantine farmstead ( AWiC 1 [2010], 745-66). Five rooms were opened: four of essentially the same constructional phase form a cluster, with the fifth (room A) off to the southeast.</page><page sequence="196">196 DON EVELY The first unit is served by two entrances, from the north and the east (the latter serving rooms set three steps down from the others). Rooms Bl/2 were used for storage, as shown by 17 pithoi, sunk and plastered home in their pits (two cist graves, one with plaster poured over it, must have been placed there after the building had been abandoned). Rooms A and E combine storage with living: more pot-pits and low stone benches on the east, south and west walls were found, as were knife blades, a lead handle for a box, a small bronze pin and two finger-rings. Room A probably had two storeys: roof tiles were found along with irregular stone slabs and traces of wooden support beams for the upper floor. Two shallow pits and a V-shaped drainage system were cut into the rock inside the room at one end. Outside the east and south walls were further drains and parts of three stone mortars. Other spaces in the open zones around the rooms were defined by stone (e.g. a circular space to the northwest). West of room A were two ovens. Ceramic evidence dates most of the floor deposits of the first unit to AD 530-580, with some lamps and amphorae allowing an upper limit of the early seventh century AD. This accords with the two coins found, of Phocas (AD 602-607) and of Constans II (AD 642-643). Vaphe. M. Andrianakis reports on excavation and repairs at the single-aisled Church of Ag. Asomatoi ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1070-71), built in the 15th century AD. The church is itself sited on the foundations of a comparable earlier church, and is situated amidst ruins and scattered sherds. Outside the lines of the earlier church walls to the east and west, and in its narthex too, were cist graves made of irregular slabs. A sixth-century AD clay lamp was recovered from the western group of graves, whilst those in the east yielded three trefoil-mouthed jugs. A child's grave had a bronze pin in the shape of a cross (seventh- century AD). A half-column re-used in a grave to the east had a dedicatory inscription (dated to the sixth to seventh century AD by letter forms): MNIITI(TI) K(YPI)E TON AHQN EN APrYPO(N) KOIMA KAI AAMIA ANO(Y) KAI TO(N) lYNAPAMO(N) TO(N) Ell KTIIIN AYTON ENTEKIQ(NOI) A ET7E TOY AHQTATOY ErTIIKOn O(Y) ETTIOANIO(Y) MNI5TI(TI) K(YPI)E KAI TON TEXNITON A test north of the church revealed a house with three rooms: sixth- to seventh-century sherds were recovered from a pit in the northern room. Elsewhere to the north, two Roman coins were found, plus fragments of glass vessels with blue-drop decoration and fourth- to fifth- century AD pottery. Demos of Kolymbarios Deliana. M. Andrianakis reports (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1072-74) on cleaning and excavation at the single-aisled Church of Ag. Ioannis Prodromos, which may once have been a Catholic monastery to judge from structures later incorporated at the southwest. Its architectural history is described, and its wall-paintings of various cycles of work discussed. The earliest paintings date to the second half of the 13th century AD (in the style of the second Byzantine period); a later painting, of the second decade of the 14th century, is the work of Michael Venetianeri. Under the paved floor of the church were found two layers of tombs. Seven more recent graves with sawn and prepared stone slabs and blocks belong to the upper level, with older and simpler pit graves beneath. Episkopl. M. Andrianakis reports on excavation, cleaning and restoration which was continued in 2000 at the Church of the Archangel Michael (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 1074-75). Architecture, mosaics and wall-paintings of the late Christian period to the 14th century AD were revealed. The entire complex was built in one phase, dated by the floor mosaic and corresponding wall-paintings to the second half of the 6th century AD. Later wall-paintings can be assigned to the late 12th and to the late 13th/early 14th centuries AD. The surrounding cemetery continued to be excavated: at the north were simple pit graves and slab cists with rough covers. Two empty tombs were found, plus a tile grave where the deceased was laid out on the natural rock. A fill was later spread over these. Later interments lay to the east. Finds here were scarce, comprising bone and glass fragments, plus metal sheet. Earlier burials on the western side contained some grave goods - a plain jar, glazed wares and an anthropomorphic figurine. Kalyves. M. Andrianakis reports on excavation in 2000 at the two-aisled Church of the Panagia Keras and Ag. Nikolaos (ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1072). This was erected in the later 19th century AD, partly (at the east) over a three- aisled basilica: a marble stylobate from the templon was re-used in the sanctuary. Simple pit graves were found inside this church; a grave inside the sanctuary contained a small trefoil-mouthed oinochoe of a type paralleled in sixth- to seventh-century AD contexts. Demos of Kissamos Kamara. G. Fandakis (25th EPCA) reports on excavations in 2007 within the late Christian cemetery east of Kissamos (AWiC 1 [2010], 732-44). Six broadly fifth- to seventh-century AD cist graves were recovered at the east, of which two were undisturbed (tombs 1 and 4). These are built of large slabs (three per side) held in place with smaller stones, and with three to four limestone cover slabs covered with thick layers of strong plaster: the floors are mostly earthen, though tomb 6 contained two large tiles. The undisturbed graves contain supine inhumations and a few grave goods which may be more closely dated to the fourth to early fifth century AD - a hoop ring with a little gilding, a whorl and a distaff hook, and a lightly decorated bone pin. Traces of a structure with at least two building phases were found 7m to the southwest. The first phase consists of two walls, with five Late Roman coins dating the construction: a thick destruction layer contained tiles and nails from the roof. Against the north wall was a pithos base and, close by, one coin of Arcadius and a second of a member of the dynasty of Constantine the Great (third- to fourth-century AD). A Venetian tornesello was introduced in later disturbance. A bronze surgical probe with cast</page><page sequence="197">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 197 linear decoration is of fourth- to seventh-century AD date. Later in the Early Byzantine phase, further walls extended the building to the east: to this phase belong coins of the second year of Heraclius' reign and of Constans IV. A sixth- to seventh-century bronze hemispherical, legged censer with simple decoration was also retrieved. A small semicircular kiln was recovered southwest of tomb 6, built from re-used stone blocks. A small hearth built from a pot base and many large tiles was also found: metal sheet and plentiful slag suggest a connection with metalworking. Mostly domestic pottery was recovered, dating first to the third to fourth century AD, and then with plentiful sixth- to seventh-century AD material with simple linear decoration. Other finds include fragments of glass vessels, especially stemmed cups, of the fourth to sixth century AD, and 27 bronze coins which date mostly to the fourth to fifth century AD. Kissamos A. and A. Chochlaki property. M. Andreadaki-Vlazaki reports on extensive excavations conducted in 1994-2000 on a plot south of the national road between Kastelli and Platanos, at the junction with the road to Lousakies ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1029-31). A Late Roman town house was revealed with around a dozen separate rooms and other areas constructed in two successive phases. A late Christian wall and floor were also recovered at the far northeast. Most floors were of beaten earth, though remnants of mosaics were located in room A and dispersed tesserae came from the drain below room L; the central atrium has a floor of thick hydraulic plaster. The north and south walls of the atrium (walls 10 and 15 respectively) carry at regular 0.5m intervals a total of 10 surviving carved stone bases, which probably bore the wooden structural supports for the atrium. Those on the north wall are disturbed by the later insertion of an east-west water-line with a tiled cover. A stone-built drain on the southern side (belonging to the initial phase of construction) collected rain-water from the atrium and transported it to a nearby cistern. In the southeast corner, fallen tiles over the floor mark the building's destruction. Room A demonstrates even more complex changes. An original doorway in the east-west wall (7) between it and room T (to the south) was closed, and room A was later narrowed by the insertion of an east- west double wall (5). At the west end of wall 7 is a north-south stone drain, which terminates in what is now a circular structure of hydraulic plaster, tile and pebbles (once a tank for collecting rain-water from the roof). Room E, at the northeast, has three successive earthen floors, below which is a sizeable stone-built east-west drain. Two niches are built into its south wall (21) 0.6m above the floor. On the floor of room B to the northwest was fallen wall-plaster (coloured red and black), with more still attached to the east wall here (wall 9). West of this room, a narrow north-south space is defined by walls 32 and 33 (both with signs of burning): on the earth floor were sherds and six third- to fourth-century vases. The presence at the north of large sandstone plaques laid flat, perhaps as threshold slabs, may indicate that there was an entrance to the complex here. Just beyond this, outside the house to the north, were two round (lm in diameter) ceramic hearths of the same date, with eight more vases of the third to fourth century AD on the surface between them. This is likely a workshop space. South of the atrium, in rooms Zt and Z, there is again evidence for remodelling. The two doors in the southeast angle were both closed up, and the east-west wall 18 between the two rooms has evidence for three periods of construction. The walls of room Zt are well built and have high-quality plaster. In the southwest corner of the room is a potter's kiln preserved to a maximum height of 0.8m, with the mouth to the north, where a burnt area yielded much pottery which dates the kiln to the early fourth century AD. Next to the kiln there was a staircase beside wall 19; two third- to fourth-century pots lay on the floor beside it. In the southeast corner of room H is the base of another kiln (0.95m in diameter) made of tiles, seemingly associated with a mass of black glassy material: this belongs to the first phase of construction. An east-west drain (5), which runs across room A and is carefully made from strong hydraulic plaster tiles, transports rain-water from the roofs off to the southwest. Many tesserae found within it indicate the presence of a further mosaic somewhere nearby, perhaps from the first building phase. Room I, which was later parti- tioned, has signs of intense burning on the floor and a large refuse pit crammed with broken pottery, probably indicating that it forms part of a workshop. In the southern part of the room, a drain (6) capped with tiles conducts water away from the roof. To the north of room I, room © also contains numerous pits with ceramics, significant amounts of slag, tesserae, animal bones and shells, as well as a large east- west drain taking water from the atrium. Finds from this excavation totalled 61 clay pots, 82 bronze coins and 428 other items (mostly bone pins, terra- cotta loom weights and bronze utensils). Just north of this plot, work on a modern road revealed the ancient paved street, with the main sewer line below the flags. Health Centre plot. S. Markoulaki (25th EPCA) reports on continuing excavation in 1999-2000 ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 1029; cf AR 49 [2002-2003], 87; Kritiki Estia [2002], 270-71). New rooms were discovered in the southern and eastern parts of this Roman villa, including a kitchen and a private bath-suite. Within the now semi-roofed area of the Health Centre was a room with immediate access to a paved public road (with a drain below), which confirms that the villa occupied an entire insula in the urban plan. It also provides further evidence for the impact of the earth- quake of AD 365 (estimated at 10 on the Richter Scale): in addition to a destruction level, it adds to evidence obtained from other excavations in Kissamos for the establishment of open-air kitchens and bread ovens by the roadside to meet the temporary needs of the local population. Stimadorakis Plot. M. Andreadaki-Vlazaki reports on excavation conducted between 1998-2000 in Roman Kissamos {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 1031; cf. AR 49 [2002- 2003], 87; Kritiki Estia [2002], 266). Settlement remains of the third to fourth century AD include a newly-founded building complex (of which four rooms were excavated) and related constructions for water management, namely seven drains of various types, a cistern and a well. Traces of late Christian occupation were also found. Finds include two whole vases, 58 bronze coins and 118 small finds. A rare find in this area is a round construction containing parts of a Late Minoan pithos, in the southern part of the plot.</page><page sequence="198">198 DON EVELY Demos of Mithimna Kopetoi. M. Andrianakis reports on excavation and restoration undertaken in 2000 at the single-aisled Church of the Holy Apostles {ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1075-76). In addition to discussion of the building's construction and the (first half 14th-century) wall-paintings, the discovery is reported of a number of simple pit graves with schist cover slabs under the church floor, which were a contributory factor to the instability and partial collapse of the structure. Demos of Nea Kydonia Psathi (Theodorogiorgakis field). M. Andreadaki- Vlazaki reports on excavations conducted from 1999- 2000 in this Prepalatial settlement ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1027-28; cf.AR 49 [2002-2003], 88; KritikiEstia [2002], 250-52). In 1980, excavation at the west end of this field revealed substantial quantities of Prepalatial pottery. Renewed fieldwork has revealed the extent of damage caused to the settlement (which occupied the southern part of the hill); apart from large quantities of surface pottery and piles of stones, only traces of the settlement remain. Parts of a building with three structural phases were recovered, occupying a triangular area which seems to have served as a workshop: parts of further rooms were noted, one of which runs onto the neighbouring property. The floors were earthen and paved, and stone receptacles were built at the base of two walls. Two stone querns and some pounders were retrieved; the ceramics are typical of this phase for western Crete. Demos of Pelekanos Paliochora. M Andrianakis reports on the third year of work (in 2000) at the fortress of Castel Selino ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr , 1076-77). Details of the Venetian defences (built during the 13th century AD to guard sea routes to North Africa), in the Ottoman period and the German protective measures during World War II are all discussed. Of interest too is the discovery of a single-aisled church with wall-paintings in the centre of the fort. A large quantity and range of pottery has been found, especially of the 16th to 17th century AD, both local and imported, including glazed cups and jugs with incised decoration, marbled vessels and maiolica (with floral and animal motifs), a significant number showing traces of burning. M. Andrianakis reports further on excavations at this fortress ( AWiC 1 [2010], 41), emphasizing the impressive amount of Venetian and Ottoman pottery collected. Demos of Souda Aptera. E. Papadopoulou (25th EPCA) reports on a tomb excavated in 2008 (AWiC 1 [2010], 686-95). This lies 150m northwest of five other LMIILA2-B chamber tombs excavated in the late 1960s at Kalami. It was partly destroyed by road-works and had also been looted. The two underground chambers are unusual: one is less regular (A), the other better fashioned and approached by three steps (B). The far ends of the chambers had been destroyed by road building and their roofs had fallen in. The dromos was not fully excavated. Skeletal remains comprise 23 skulls and some long bones 198. Aptera: chamber A.</page><page sequence="199">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 199 retrieved from chamber A, plus a few fragments in the dromos. Some 100 vases are listed: 72 in chamber A (Fig. 198), some 15 from chamber B. The five vessels in the dromos (jars, an incense burner and cups) are a typical assemblage associated with rituals concerning the dead. Three bronze pins and a clay whorl were also found. Some of the decorated wares are smaller shapes dating to LMII (e.g. Ephyrean goblets and cups) (Fig. 199). Others, such as kalathoi, stirrup jars, juglets and domestic wares, date to LMIIIA. Apart from one Mycenaean import, the pottery is from the Chaniot workshop. The two chambers appear to be virtually contemporary, and it is therefore possible that the tomb marks a transition between multi- chambered Minoan tombs and the more regulated Mycenaean variety. Aptera. V. Niniou-Kindeli reports on work undertaken in 1999 and 2000 across the settlement ( ADelt55 [2000] Chr, 1037-40) (Fig. 200). Six foci of research are reported. (1) A massive T -shaped cistern (up to 55.8m long), which was dug into the bedrock, partly built in opus caementicium and lined with hydraulic plaster. The original roof is now lost, and it is likely that the cistern was left open after the devastating earthquake of AD 365. Shafts and drains for its operation were also found. The cistern was filled with debris from a nearby monastery. (2) A tripartite cistern, of similar construction to that above but with a third of the capacity ( ca. 3m3). Its exterior is supported by buttresses and the interior by square pillars, with a stairway for access and an overflow shaft. (3) Bath-house I. This has large standing walls at the north, and, while the full extent of the building is unknown, it clearly forms part of a public bath complex, with a likely construction date in early Imperial times. Trials revealed a destruction layer from the seventh- century AD earthquake. Four hypocaust systems have so far been discovered, with related praefurnia. A kiln in room A indicates a change in use of this area in Late Roman times. Quantities of ceramics, broken statuary and parts of inscriptions, including a dedication slab, were located. (4) Bath-house II. Thus is better preserved, with walls standing to a greater height due to the quantity of fill in the rooms. Excavation was taken to floor level in two areas. The largest area, the frigidarium, has a pebbled floor, with two pools in side chambers (one semicircular, the other rectangular); the smaller rooms contain a hypocaust, praefurnium and flues. Following the earthquake of AD 365, temporary use was made of the space within the walls, perhaps with some perishable covering over open spaces. Many sixth- to seventh-century AD lamps were recovered, along with cooking vessels amongst burnt layers. The physical proximity of the two cisterns and two bath buildings, and the presence of channels between them, likely indicates that they form part of a single scheme. (5 and 6) Pathways. A large cobbled pathway linked the northeast of the kastro with the prison of Itzedin during the Ottoman period, and remained in use until recently. A medieval path, which linked the west side of the fortifi- cation with the centre of the village during the period of the monastery, was cleaned along its whole length. Immediately below surface levels, cleaning revealed part of a building as well as pieces of sculpture and inscriptions 199. Aptera: LMII pottery. used as construction material for the path. In the process of cleaning operations to facilitate connecting the path to the modern road in the area of the main entrance to the city, the fill covering the slope between the road and the fortification was removed. Part of the ancient road was revealed, built from large slabs, as well as part of a Heroon. Between two groups of robbed cist tombs were five pillar-shaped bases, with inscriptions preserved on the four most complete. One can be read in its entirety: H rTOAI2/nPASIOXON/&lt;DIAETAIPOY/HPOA. One further cornerstone, which must belong to a sixth base, reads: AIMIAION/XAPIAHMON/HPQA. The inscriptions are dated by letter forms to the first to second century AD. Between the bases were the stratified remains of ritual pyres, dating from the late first century BC to the early second century AD. Ritual equipment includes very large plates as well as vessels for liquids. Together with the burnt remains of liquid offering containers were carbonized olive pips and almonds. A deposit of numerous Hellenistic lamps of the second to first century BC relates to a similar ritual; these were found within an irregularly-shaped pit, together with lead and stone shot. Heroes were honoured in this place from at least Hellenistic times. Fallen architectural remains, as well as the krepis of a building with a column in situ, indicate the likely presence of a funerary monument connected with a hero. A marble relief with the busts of a man and woman, while unusually fine for a Cretan work, is typical of early Imperial funerary monuments and dates to the Trajanic period.</page><page sequence="200">200 DON EVELY 200. Aptera: city plan. Kalami (Chalakatevakis- Ventolins property). K. Tzanakaki (25th EPCA) reports ( AWiC 1 [2010], 719-31) on excavations conducted in 2007-2008 which uncovered much of an Early Hellenistic structure overlying Late Classical remains. The initial Hellenistic structure (of which three rooms are noted) was constructed on at least three levels to fit the lie of the land. In the later second century BC extensive renovation, perhaps following an earthquake, divided rooms into smaller units with the insertion of internal walls, leading to an east-west internal division. A total of 13 closed spaces/rooms were examined: most had earth floors, with one paved (room 8). Earthquake destruction probably caused the final abandonment in the later first century BC (stone and tile destruction deposits are traced on the floors). The early house was a site of olive and wine production on some scale: a wine press is preserved on the west side, with parallels from Black Sea sites such as Mirmeki and Olbia. A re-used oil press with Cypriot parallels was found in room 11; an inverted pot with olive pips (room 1) and a small cistern underscore the connection. In room 10, a small hollow capped by a marble altar held a pair of clay figurines of Cybele and Attis alongside stone and clay ritual vessels of the third century BC. Lead and bronze objects were also retrieved from room 10. Though the structure retained its agricultural connec- tions in the later phase of occupation, the nature and scale of operations changed. Finds now include many bronze coins, clay vessels (including amphorae from Kos, Knidos, Rhodes, etc.). Room 4 was partly open to the air: on the floor were scattered lead ring-links, with pumice and shells. Room 13, always partly sunken into the ground, was employed for storage, with benches situated along the walls. In the stone and tile destruction debris were broken amphorae, stone tools and items of bronze. The presence of a pig jaw, plus another below the floor, look like delib- erate deposits of a ritual character. Demos of Therisos Perivolia. M. Andrianakis reports ( ADelt 55 [2000] Chr, 1068-69) on excavation and restoration in 2000 at the two-aisled Church of Ag. Panteleimon and Dimitris. Though the wall-paintings were obscured in the 19th- century AD building of the bell-tower, explorations in the newer north aisle revealed some with distinct western influences and a Latin inscription. A link to the Viaro family who held the nearby (now ruined) villa is a possi- bility. Structural phases were determined during excavation under the floor, which also revealed seven simple pit graves. In the south aisle was a funerary inscription, now largely illegible, in charcoal on white plaster (the year 1509 is legible).</page><page sequence="201">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2009-2010 201 ABBREVIATIONS Chronology : BA Bronze Age E Early Cor Corinthian M Middle Cyc Cycladic L Late G Geometric F Final H Helladic M Minoan N Neolithic Also used in combination, e.g.: MBA Middle Bronze Age Specialized Ephoreias: EBA Ephoreia of Byzantine Antiquities EMA Ephoreia of Maritime Antiquities EPCA Ephoreia of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities EPSNE Ephoreia of Paleoanthropology and Spelae- ology for Southern Greece (formerly EPS: Ephoreia of Paleoanthropology and Spelaeology) EPSVE Ephoreia of Paleoanthropology and Spelae- ology for Northern Greece (formerly EPS: Ephoreia of Paleoanthropology and Spelaeology) Institutions : ASA Archaeological Society at Athens ASCSA American School of Classical Studies at Athens BSA British School at Athens DAI Deutsche Archaologische Institut EfA Ecole frangaise d'Athenes ESAG Ecole Suisse d'archeologie en Grece SAIA Scuola Archeologica Italiana di Atene TAP Archaeological Receipts Fund TDPEAE Management Fund for the Execution of Archaeological Projects Bibliographical: AA Archaologischer Anzeiger AAA Athens Annals of Archaeology ADelt Archaiologikon Deltion (Chr = Chronika; Mel - Meletai) AE Archaiologiki Ephemeris AEMTh Archaiologiko Ergo sti Makedonia kai Thraki AEThSE Archaiologiko Ergo Thessalias kai Stereas Elladas AJA American Journal of Archaeology AKunst Antike Kunst AM Mitteilungen des Deutschen Archaologischen Instituts, Athenische Abteilung AR Archaeological Reports BCH Bulletin de correspondance hellenique BSA Annual of the British School at Athens DeltChAE Deltion tis Christianikis Archaiologikis Etaireias JDAI Jahrbuch des Deutschen Archaologischen Instituts JHS Journal of Hellenic Studies PAE Praktika tis en Athinais Archaiologikis Etaireias SOURCES OF ILLUSTRATIONS Andreou, S. 147-149 Archaeological Institute of Crete 190 ASA 48-55, 165-167 ASCSA 1-2, 18-21, 43, 181-182, 184, 196-197 BSA 47, 93, 171, 189 Canadian Institute in Greece 115-116, 180 DAI 25, 38-39, 56-58, 99-102, 162-164 Demakopoulou, K. 36-37 EfA 26-27, 75-80, 153, 183 Finnish Institute 133 Ministry of Culture and Tourism 1st EPCA 3 2nd EPCA 15-17 3rd EPCA 4-9 4th EPCA 28-35, 40-42 5th EPCA 44-46 6th EPCA 63, 65-66 7th EPCA 59-62 8th EPCA 71 9th EPCA 81-84, 87-92 12th EPCA 136 13th EPCA 107-110, 112-114, 121- 122 14th EPCA 98, 104-106 15th EPCA 117, 120 16th EPCA 143-144, 150-151 17th EPCA 137-142 19th EBA 154-156 20th EPCA 157-161 21st EPCA 168-170, 172 22nd EPCA 173, 178-179 25th EPCA 193-194, 198-200 26th EPCA 10-14 32nd EPCA 132, 135 33rd EPCA 124-131 34th EPCA 123 35th EPCA 68, 70 36th EPCA 74 1st EBA 85-86 4th EBA 176 6th EBA 22-24 7th EBA 103, 111, 118-119 8th EBA 72-73, 134 9th EBA 145-146 12th EBA 152 28th EBA 195 EMA 67, 69, 174-175, 177 Herakleion Museum 191 Papazoglou-Manioudaki, L. 64 SAIA 186-188, 192 ESAG 94-97 Tsipopoulou, M. 185</page></plain_text>
