I don't care whether the world is good or bad - not on any particular day." - Robert Frost, from "Education by Poetry." The tendency of criticism since Trilling to stress the "terrible" in Robert Frost's works has led to what is at best an oversimplification, and at worst a distortion - namely, that Frost is allied to Hawthorne, Melville, and other forces out of the nineteenth century which imposed a Puritan perspective upon the basic problem of evil in the world. A careful examination of Frost's work reveals, on the contrary, an essential indifference to moral perspective. I do not mean this in a derogatory sense. Frost himself repeatedly insisted that poetry is "for griefs, not grievances," and when he attempted political and social moralizing in the terse "editorials" of his later career, the shallow artistic quality of some of these poems demonstrated the validity of his own axioms. We in the Judaic-Christian tradition find it hard to conceive of the matter in our universe as morally neutral, for as Frost's poetry also demonstrates, we project the imaginative capacity of our minds upon this matter, endowing it with relationship, perspective, and what Frost so aptly called "Design." We cannot imagine God in any other sense than as an arbiter of good and evil; the Greek concept of anthropomorphic deities carousing, scheming and otherwise diminishing Olympus to Eden is foreign to our spiritual natures. It is, therefore, tempting for critics to find in Frost's great sonnet "Design" a whiteness to be equated with Melvillian malevolence. But the spider is not the whale, after all. For one thing, it is so diminutive that the poet even doubts whether in this case "Design govern in a thing so small." And the luring of the moth to its destruction by the spider is in itself a manifestation that Frost views Nature as morally neutral. The destruction of the moth serves to sustain life for the spider, and in the Darwinian view, this is the only significance of the act. The "terrifying" aspects of the poem are a kind of confidence trick. The terror is in the creative imagination of man - not in the outside world. 22</page><page sequence="2">The same concept is demonstrated in a lesser-known poem, "Range- Finding." The bullet catapulted across the battle field is to the human consciousness an instrument of evil, yet "before it stains a single human breast" it disturbs the world of Nature by bending double a stricken flower. And Nature's emissary, once again in the form of a spider, mistakes the bullet's impact for welcome prey: The indwelling spider ran to greet the fly, But finding nothing, sullenly withdrew. Once again, man's imposed value judgments are not to be confused with external reality. This view of Nature is consistently upheld by Frost. In "The Onset" the melting snow being assimilated by the brook is described through the image of a "disappearing snake." This indeed suggests that to the mind of man good (the spring) will ultimately be obliterated by evil (winter). Yet to Nature itself winter is as right as spring. Likewise, the seemingly sinister obliterating power of the summer woods in "Spring Pools" serves a function to Nature which is in fact positive unto itself. And we are reminded how the phoebes "see nothing sad" in the abandoned home that has been destroyed by fire in "The Need of being Versed in Country Things," though man finds it hard "not to believe the phoebes wept." But what of moral actions outside the world of Nature? The callous stabbing of "The Draft Horse" by the sinister figure out of the woods is in the human consciousness senseless and cruel. But the couple riding the outmoded buggy do not condemn the act, for human intuition cannot comprehend it. Similarly, Frost does not condemn Brad MacLaughlin of "The Star Splitter" for burning his house down for the fire insurance, since he used the money to buy a telescope To satisfy a life -long curiosity About our place among the infinities. Nor does he condemn the hired hand in "The Code" who nearly murders his boss to demonstrate a code of farm ethics. Even the "Witch of Coos" is not judged by Frost - in many respects she is at least as comic as she is tragic - and her tragedy somewhat alleviates the natural inclination for the reader to judge her for having instigated a murder. But perhaps the outstanding expression of this moral neutrality on the part of Frost is his depiction of God in A Masque of Reason. No longer the arbiter of right and wrong, God emerges as a victim of a twentieth century scientific determinism. He rationalizes that Job's loyal submission to His injustice has liberated Him from moral responsibility to the Human race: The only free will there at first was man's, Who could do good or evil as he chose. I had no choice but I must follow him With forfeits and rewards he understood - Unless I liked to suffer loss of worship. I had to prosper good and punish evil. You changed all that. You set me free to reign. You are the emancipator of your God, And as such I promote you to a saint. 23</page><page sequence="3">But Job's wife insists upon anthropomorphizing Him: If you're the deity I assume you are (I'd know you by Blake's picture anywhere) - And since beyond the mind of man there are only "roughly zones" of good and evil, God explains that: There's no connection man can reason out Between his just deserts and what he gets. Frost's depiction of God in the Masque has been labeled everything from blasphemous to ludicrous, but the fact is that He is above all morally neutral - the antinomy of God as Almighty Judge. Neither providential nor just towards Man. He is the remnant of a dead tradition. My forte is truth, Or metaphysics, long the world's reproach For standing still in one place true forever; While science goes superseding on. Even if we read these lines as an ironic attack on scientific method, we can also sense that this is an attack on what our tormented, doubt-ridden and psychology-permeated age has done to God. Those who do not realize Frost's modernity in the twentieth century are misreading the implications of A Masque of Reason, which is strikingly allied to existentialism in presenting man's predicament through the words of Job: We don't know where we are, or who we are. We don't know one another; and don't know You; Don't know what time it is. Elsewhere in his poetry, Frost had indicated that "the time was neither wrong nor right," for the old values had been superseded with the very passing of time. In a world seemingly stripped of purpose and moral values, man becomes a drifter, akin to the flux of Nature. And because of the Darwinian degradation of Man, God is dragged down also, so that by the end of the poem God, Job, and the devil pose for a snapshot. They are, as it were, equals. Man's creativity itself becomes the only "stay against the confusion of the world." The one substantial value to which Man can cling is to the fruit of his creativity. This is why in the Masque of Mercy Frost's only prayer "worth praying" is: May my sacrifice Be found acceptable in Heaven's sight. To fail to live out one's life on the altar of sacrifice becomes the only sin, since existential choice is what makes life have any meaning. This in the process takes Frost out of the puritanism of Jonathan Edwards, and places him in the mainstream of twentieth century thought. 24</page></plain_text>
