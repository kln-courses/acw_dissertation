Recent studies have shown that positive mood has a facilitating effect on  multimedia learning. Though literature has shown that negative mood encourages an individual to engage in a  more systematic, elaborate, and analytical cognitive processing, this effect has not been empirically tested in the  context of multimedia learning. The work is supported by two experiments. Experiment 1 was conducted to  determine if the facilitating effects of positive mood found in previous works can be replicated with a  multimedia learning system that teaches basic programming algorithm to learners at an Asian university.  Experiment 2 investigated the effects of induced negative mood on learners’ cognition and motivation in a  multimedia learning environment. Results revealed that negative mood enhanced intrinsic motivation and  germane load, while reducing learning transfer. Learning transfer was enhanced by the presence of positive  moods among males. Moreover, positive mood had a favorable effect on germane load, extraneous load, and  intrinsic motivation. Theoretical and practical implications related to affective learning are discussed in this  paper.     Keywords  Multimedia learning environment, Cognitive-Affective Theory of Learning with Media, Mood, Gender, Motivation    Introduction    In a typical e-learning and computer-based learning environment, learners are confronted with information presented  in the format of text, narration, animation, and graphics. Hence, learners engage in the cognitive process known as  multimedia learning (Mayer, 2008). The cognitive process of multimedia learning describes an information  processing in which learners select relevant visual and verbal materials, organize these visual and verbal mental  representations in coherent structures in working memory, and integrate the visual and the verbal mental  representations with one another and with prior knowledge (Mayer, 2008).    Complementing this process model, the cognitive load theory (CLT) provides a capacity model of multimedia  learning (Kalyuga, 2011). The CLT model highlights the inherent limitation of working memory and describes three  types of cognitive load: intrinsic, germane, and extraneous. Intrinsic cognitive load is the inherent level of difficulty  associated with a specific instructional topic. Germane load defines the amount of mental effort invested by the  learner in comprehending the materials, whereas extraneous load describes processing demands of information that  are not directly related to the learning task (Kalyuga, 2011).     Multimedia learning design has been primarily based on cognitive models such as dual-coding theory and cognitive  load theory (Mayer &amp; Moreno, 2003). However, Moreno’s (2006) Cognitive-Affective Theory of Learning with  Media extended the framework by integrating emotional and motivational factors in multimedia learning design.  According to this framework, the process of multimedia learning is mediated by emotional factors that influence  learner’s willingness to invest mental effort to the learning process (Park et al., 2015). In addition, the framework  assumes that multimedia learning process is mediated by learner’s metacognition such as cognitive styles and  abilities (Moreno &amp; Durán, 2004; Park et al., 2015). Hence, a learner's working memory, motivation (i.e., germane  load), and cognitive style is affected by his or her emotional states.     Recent studies have attempted to validate the importance of emotional factors in the design of multimedia learning  environments. In a seminal work by Um et al. (2012), it was demonstrated that learners who were induced with  positive mood outperformed learners who were induced with neutral mood in comprehension and transfer tests. The  researchers also showed that positive emotion can be transferred to learners through interface designs, such as  anthropomorphism and bright colors. In the attempt to replicate these findings, Plass et al. (2014) tested the effects of  104  ISSN 1436-4522 (online) and 1176-3647 (print).

It was shown that positive  emotional design in multimedia learning environments enhanced positive emotion, motivation, and comprehension.  Moreover, positive emotional design in a multimedia interface significantly reduced learners’ perception of task  difficulty. However, the study failed to replicate the facilitating effect of positive emotional design on transfer scores.     Mayer and Estrella (2014) tested the effects of positive emotional design in multimedia learning environments.  Mirroring earlier findings (Plass et al., 2014; Um et al., 2012;), results from their experiments showed that positive  emotional design via anthropomorphism and appealing colors enhanced retention scores. In an eye tracking  experiment, Park et al. (2015) revealed that learners who were induced with positive mood had higher learning  outcomes in comprehension and transfer tests and showed longer fixation durations on the relevant information of  the multimedia learning environment than learners who were induced with neutral mood. Their findings empirically  indicate that emotional state influences cognitive and attentional processing in multimedia learning.       Moods in multimedia learning environment     There are different constructs when defining “emotion” (Ekkekakis, 2012; Russell, 2003). “Affect” is an umbrella  term that bounds both “emotions” and “moods” (Russell, 2003). Moods differ from emotions in two key aspects.  First, moods last longer than emotions (Ekkekakis, 2012). Secondly, moods are diffuse and operate at a lower  intensity than emotions (Fridja, 2009). Unlike emotions, which are often prototypically labeled (e.g., surprise, fear,  anger, and shame), moods can be generally described as feeling “good” or “bad” (Ekkekakis, 2012). While emotions  are intense and trigger action-oriented responses, moods have a potentially more enduring, subtle, and insidious  influence on people’s cognitive processes than do distinct and intense emotions (Forgas, 1995).     In addition, Brave and Nass (2003) provide a research framework for distinguishing the effects of emotion and mood  in human-computer interaction. The researchers described the differences between emotion and mood from a  functional perspective. Emotions bias action as they prepare the body and mind for an apt and instantaneous  response, whereas mood affects an individual’s sentiment and cognitive style over a longer duration. Taking this  functional viewpoint, we focused on mood rather than emotion in this research for three reasons.    Firstly, interacting in multimedia learning environments often requires a substantial amount of time. Hence, we  focused on the effect of moods experienced by learners as enduring states (e.g., feeling “good” versus “bad”) rather  than short-lived emotions (e.g., surprise, fear, anger). Secondly, the experience of mood is constantly influenced by  physical surroundings (Forgas, 2013). A recent framework by Choi et al. (2014) posits that environmental factors,  such as lighting, noise, and temperature, influence learners’ mood when studying in multimedia learning  environments. Hence, a learner’s mood (rather than emotion) is regarded as a subtle and enduring experience that is  caused by environmental attributes. Thirdly, our focus on mood helps to link potential findings to the design of  multimedia learning environments. As shown in literature, interface design, such as colors, website layouts,  decorative graphics, and anthropomorphism, affect learners’ emotional and arousal states. Because these design  factors are meant to be subtle and not overly seductive or distracting (see Magner et al., 2014; Mayer &amp; Estrella,  2014), interface design factors tend to bias learners’ mood more than intense emotion.     The Cognitive-Affective Theory of Learning with Media provides us with the insights of how mood might mediate  cognition and motivation in multimedia learning environment (Moreno, 2006; Park et al., 2015). From this  framework, three crucial cognitive and metacognitive aspects are highlighted: working memory, motivation (i.e.,  germane load), and processing style. The following sections provide theoretical reviews related to mood, working  memory, motivation, and processing style.      Effects of mood on working memory    Literature has predominantly shown that negative mood impairs cognitive performance by depleting resources in  working memory (Brose et al., 2012). One argument is that negative mood prompts an individual’s mind to entertain  irrelevant and ruminative thoughts (Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 2008). Moreover, sad individuals will engage in mood- repair strategy to alleviate negative mood, resulting in split attention in working memory between cognitive task and  mood correction (Brand et al., 2007; Riediger et al., 2011). Lastly, the resource allocation hypothesis (Ellis et al.,  105  </page> <page sequence="3"> 1988) argues that sad individuals tend to lessen their cognitive effort for difficult tasks that potentially further erode  their mood.    However, research has also indicated that positive mood may interfere with working memory (see Mitchell &amp;  Phillips, 2007). The activation of positive mood has been shown to impair memory tasks, such as Tower of London  (Phillips et al., 2002), the complex Stroop task (Phillips et al., 2002), and the running span task (Cowan et al., 2005).  Drawing parallels to negative mood, positive mood may also prime individuals to entertain irrelevant thoughts,  causing reduction in working memory capacity (Seibert &amp; Ellis, 1991). This notion may explain the association  between positive mood and increased distractibility during cognitive tasks (see Biss &amp; Hasher, 2011)      Effects of mood on motivation    Affect-as-information theory (Schwarz &amp; Clore, 1996) suggests that happy individuals are more likely to use  heuristics to interpret their mood in order to evaluate their external environment (see Forgas, 2013). Hence, positive  mood primes individuals to elicit favorable judgments regarding the target stimuli, resulting in enhanced motivation  and engagement towards tasks (Isen &amp; Reeve, 2005). In the context of multimedia learning environments, positive  mood has been associated with increased intrinsic motivation and germane load in learners (Plass et al., 2014; Um et  al., 2012).    Negative mood has been shown to increase effort and motivation in cognitive tasks (Erber &amp; Erber, 1994; Forgas,  2013). The hedonistic discounting hypothesis argues that sad mood increases an individual’s expectation of future  hedonistic value of a task, hence prompting him/her to invest more effort in the task (see Forgas, 2013). This notion  may be related closely with control theory (Carver &amp; Scheier, 1990); that is, negative affect may signal to individuals  that their current progress is under certain expectations, thereby encouraging them to invest higher levels of  motivated effort to reach their goals. Moreover, as part of mood-repair strategy, sad individuals tend to recruit  effortful and motivated processing in tasks, in order to provide distraction from negative thoughts (Erber &amp; Erber,  1994; Erber &amp; Tesser, 1992; Forgas, 1995; Forgas, 2013).      Effects of mood on processing style    In his book, The Emotion Machine, Marvin Minsky (2006) states that when we change our emotional states, we are  switching between different ways to think. From the literature, there is a general consensus suggesting that positive  mood leads an individual to use less effortful and heuristic information processing, while negative mood recruits a  more systematic, analytical, and elaborate style of thinking (see Forgas, 1995; Forgas, 2013). Forgas (2013) asserted  that “negative mood, by recruiting more accommodative and externally focused processing, should improve attention  and encoding” (p. 226). Hence, it has been contended that negative mood may benefit learning through the  recruitment of more effortful thinking (Forgas, 1995; Forgas, 2013), elaborate memory encoding (Bäuml &amp;  Kuhbandner, 2007; Forgas et al., 2009) and cautious interpretation of new information (Bless &amp; Fiedler, 1995;  Gasper, 2003).    However, it has also been highlighted that negative mood causes an individual’s attention focus to be too narrow and  rigid when processing external data, thus interfering with flexible thinking (Gasper, 2003). On the contrary, the build  and broaden hypothesis (Fredrickson &amp; Branigan, 2005) suggests that attention span and global processing of  external information improves in the presence of positive mood. Under this view, happy individuals are more likely  to exhibit flexible thinking that allows for more global integration and creative analysis of newly acquired  information (Gasper, 2003), thus resulting in enhanced creativity and problem solving skills (Isen, 1999).       Gender as moderating factor to effects of mood    Negative and positive moods are processed differently by males and females (Martin, 2003). Martin (2003) notes that  “females have a greater propensity for detailed processing, whereas males tend toward more heuristic processing” (p.  253). As a consequence, males and females approach mood-repair differently. Sad males engage in mood-repair by  106  </page> <page sequence="4"> using distraction and therefore are less likely to pay attention to difficult tasks that potentially worsen their mood  (Nolen-Hoeksema, 2001). On the other hand, under the influence of negative mood, females tend to recruit detailed,  comprehensive, and elaborate thinking in processing external environments as a whole, including stimuli that  potentially worsen mood (Martin, 2003). This is to say that sad females are more likely to engage in more motivated  and effortful processing when dealing with difficult tasks compared to sad males.      Research gaps and research objectives    It is tempting to intuitively proclaim that positive mood will always enhance cognitive performance and motivation  in the context of learning, while negative mood will hinder cognition and motivation. However, as discussed in the  previous section of this paper, the findings from psychological research showed that the association among mood,  cognition, and motivation remains contradictory. For instance, though initial studies has shown the benefits of  positive mood with regards to multimedia learning (Park et al., 2015; Plass et al., 2014; Um et al., 2012), literature  from cognitive psychology has also pointed out the association among positive mood, decreased working memory  and increased distractibility during cognitive tasks (Biss &amp; Hasher, 2011; Mitchell &amp; Phillips, 2007).     As noted by Heidig et al. (2015), research related to the effects of mood on multimedia learning is still in its infancy.  Thus far, the facilitating effect of positive mood has been demonstrated for a representative sample of students from  Western (Mayer &amp; Estrella, 2014; Um et al., 2012) and European universities (Park et al., 2015; Plass et al., 2014).  However, the effects of positive mood on multimedia learning have not been tested for learners in Asia. Moreover,  the same multimedia learning topic (i.e., immunization) was used in previous studies (Mayer &amp; Estrella, 2014; Park  et al., 2015; Plass et al., 2014; Um et al., 2012). As highlighted by Mayer and Estrella (2014), there is, therefore, a  need to extend this research by using different subject domains and sample populations. Hence, the first objective of  this study is to determine if the facilitating effects of positive mood found in previous works can be replicated in a  multimedia learning system that teaches basic programming algorithm to learners from an Asian university.    Secondly, the role of negative mood in multimedia learning environments is still unclear (Heidig et al., 2015). While  negative mood is generally undesirable, its potential to promote a more systematic, elaborate, and analytical  cognitive processing (Bless &amp; Fiedler, 1995; Forgas, 2013; Gasper, 2003) should be tested in the context of  multimedia learning. Furthermore, negative mood may act as a signal for an individual to put in more effort (Erber &amp;  Erber, 1994) and encourage learners to be cautious and pay more attention to information in the environment (Bless  &amp; Fiedler, 1995; Forgas, 2013; Gasper, 2003). As there are currently no empirical studies that investigate the effects  of negative mood on multimedia learning, it is uncertain whether negative mood can enhance or decrease learners’  motivation and cognition in multimedia learning environments. Hence, the second objective of this study is to  determine the effects of negative mood on learners’ cognition and motivation in a multimedia learning environment.     Previous mood researches tend to directly compare between positive and negative mood, rather than comparing them  with neutral mood (control group). However, because positive and negative mood has been shown to trigger different  systems of cognition and motivation in individuals, control conditions (i.e., neutral mood) are crucial to isolate the  effects of positive and negative mood. For example, if both positive mood and negative mood are assumed to  enhance motivation, a direct comparison between these two conditions (i.e., absence of a neutral condition) may  yield obscure findings. Hence, we included the control conditions in two separate experiments: (1) positive mood  versus neutral mood and (2) negative mood versus neutral mood, in order to isolate the effects of positive and  negative mood, respectively. Additionally, both experiments were conducted separately because we used different  surveys for measuring positive mood and negative mood in learners.      Research questions    From the literature, mood theories offer contradictory predictions regarding the effects of mood on cognitive load,  germane load, intrinsic motivation, and learning performance in multimedia learning systems. Hence, we aim to  answer the following questions:  (1) How does positive mood affect cognitive load, germane load, intrinsic motivation, and learning performance in  multimedia learning environments?  107  </page> <page sequence="5"> (2) Does gender differently affect the impact of positive mood on cognitive load, germane load, intrinsic motivation,  and learning performance in multimedia learning environments?  (3) How does negative mood affect cognitive load, germane load, intrinsic motivation, and learning performance in  multimedia learning environments?  (4) Does gender differently affect the impact of negative mood on cognitive load, germane load, intrinsic  motivation, and learning performance in multimedia learning environments?      Experiment 1    We aimed to compare the effects of positive mood and neutral mood on learner’s cognition and motivation in  multimedia learning environments.       Participants    Freshmen (n = 172: 88 males, 84 females; mean age = 19) at a university were recruited to participate in exchange  for extra course credits. All participants were business majors who had no experience in programming-related  subjects.      Multimedia learning environment    The multimedia learning environment delivered lessons on basic computer programming (see Figure1). Participants  were required to learn to (1) comprehend computer algorithms of if-statements, if-else statements, and nested-if  statements and (2) predict the output from C-Programming statements. Within the multimedia learning environment,  participants first needed to study the fundamental program concepts, such as initial value, condition, and statement.  To be able to predict program outputs, participants must form correct mental models on program algorithms by  grasping the relationship between the initial value, condition, and statement. Sample programs and flowcharts were  included to highlight these relationships, and subsequent working demonstrations were presented to show how to  predict the program output. The ability to identify programming concepts and to predict program outputs are  consistent with the cognitive skills of knowledge retention and comprehension of Bloom’s taxonomy in computer  sciences (as cited in Thompson et al., 2008).      Figure 1. Multimedia learning environment      Dependent measures    Positive mood    To measure a learner’s positive mood, the positive affect scale (PAS) from PANAS-X was utilized (Watson et al.,  1988). This survey has been formerly used in studies that examine emotional responses to interface design in  108  </page> <page sequence="6"> multimedia learning environments (Plass et al., 2014; Um et al., 2012). The survey asked respondents to indicate the  degree to which they experienced 10 types of positive feelings, using a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (very  slightly or not at all) to 7 (very much; coefficient alpha = .84). The total score for positive affect was obtained by  adding the 10 responses from the items.      Intrinsic motivation    The learner’s motivation was measured using a self-report instrument, consisting of an 8-item questionnaire with 7- point Likert style items, developed by Isen and Reeve (2005) for measuring intrinsic motivation. Participants were  asked to rate how interesting and enjoyable they found the experience (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree).  One point was assigned for each item, and each participant’s total score, obtained by adding responses from the 8  items, was used for the data analysis. The measure was used by prior studies related to multimedia learning (Plass et  al., 2014; Um et al., 2012).      Learning performance    The learning performance of participants was measured as a total score of the transfer post-tests. The comprehension  test asked learners to predict the output of ten short program statements. The transfer tests require learners to apply  algorithmic rules as learned in the virtual lessons to the new situation, in order to achieve the correct output. The  maximum score obtainable is 10. These measures were consistent with the cognitive skills of knowledge retention  and comprehension in computer sciences (Thompson et al., 2008).      Learners’ germane and extraneous load    To measure the cognitive load experienced by learners, participants completed a 9-point Likert style Cognitive Load  Subjective Experience Questionnaire targeting invested mental effort (Paas, 1992) and a 7-point Likert style survey  on their perceptions of task difficulty (Kalyuga et al., 2000).      Procedure    Participants were randomly divided and ushered to into either one of two identically designed lecture rooms, thereby  forming the control group or the experimental group. To induce neutral and positive mood, the Velten procedure was  administered (Velten, 1968; Jennings et al., 2000). Participants in the control group were asked to read 30 positively  valenced statements twice, while participants in experimental group were asked to read 30 neutrally valenced  statements twice (i.e., statements which were neither self-referent nor pertaining to mood). After the mood  inductions, the PAS survey was administered. Next, participants viewed and listened to a 20-minute virtual lesson  that was projected onto a 7000 mm x 7000 mm screen with attached PA speakers. After the virtual lesson,  participants were instructed to complete the surveys for measuring positive affect, intrinsic motivation, cognitive  load, and germane load. They were then given 20 minutes to complete the transfer posttest. Using a scoring rubric,  each learner’s posttest was scored blind with respect to experimental conditions set by the second author of this  study.      Experiment 2    We compared the effects of between negative and neutral mood on cognition and motivation in the multimedia  learning environment. Freshmen (n = 96: 40 males, 56 females; mean age = 19) who had no programming prior  knowledge were recruited to participate in exchange for extra course credits. The details and the procedure of this  experiment are identical to Experiment 1 except for two variations. First, the negative affect scale (NAS) instead of  the positive affect scale (PAS) from PANAS-X was used. Secondly, to induce a state of negative mood, 30 negatively  valence statements were read by participants twice in the experimental group (Jennings et al., 2000).    109  </page> <page sequence="7"> Research question revisited    RQ1: How does positive mood affect cognitive load, germane load, intrinsic motivation and learning  performance in multimedia learning environment?    Based on data from Experiment 1, we conducted a series of independent samples t-tests to compare scores for PAS 1  (administered immediately after mood induction), PAS 2 (administered after virtual lesson), perceived task difficulty,  mental effort, and posttest scores between learners in the control (neutral mood) and experimental (positive mood)  groups. Table 1 shows the means, standard deviations and p-values of the t-test analysis.    Table 1. Means, standard deviations, and p-values of t-test analysis.   Control (Neutral Experimental (Positive p-value (2-tailed)  Mood) Mood)  [Mean, SD] [Mean, SD]  PAS 1 (after mood induction) 34.50 (9.77) 41.69 (9.78) .000  PAS 2 (after virtual lesson) 34.76 (11.49) 41.13 (12.05) .000  Perceived task difficulty (Extraneous load) 3.61 (1.51) 3.12 (1.53) .061  Mental effort (Germane load) 3.71 (1.38) 4.62 (.91) .000  Intrinsic motivation 29.05 (8.88) 34.23 (9.95) .000  Posttest scores 5.78 (3.39) 6.05 (3.15) .582    Positive mood induction was shown to be successful; PAS 1 scores for learners in the experimental group were  significantly higher than PAS 1 scores for the control learners. Pairwise comparisons using paired samples t-tests  showed no significant differences between PAS 1and PAS 2 for the control learners, t(75) = 2.411, p = .759 and  learners in the experimental group, t(95) = 2.411, p = .547. That is, for both the control and experimental groups, the  levels of positive mood in participants were not affected by the learning task in the multimedia learning environment.     Positive-mood learners reported significantly higher mental effort, t(170) = 2.411, p = .000, and intrinsic motivation,  t(170) = 2.411, p = .000 than did negative-mood learners. For perceived task difficulty, participants who received  positive mood induction rated the difficulty of the learning material as lower than learners who received neutral  mood induction,  t(170) = 2.411, p = .061. Posttest scores did not significantly differ between learners in  experimental and control groups.      RQ2: Does gender differently affect the impact of positive mood on cognitive load, germane load, intrinsic  motivation, and learning performance in multimedia learning environments?    Using the data from Experiment 1, we conducted a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) with mood  condition (neutral, positive) and gender as between-subjects factors and perceived task difficulty, mental effort,  intrinsic motivation, and posttest scores as dependent measures. The analysis showed there was an interaction effect  between gender and mood condition for posttest scores, F(1,168)= 4.104, p = .044, partial eta squared = .024, and for  mental effort,  F(1,168) = 12.644, p = .008, partial eta squared = .041.     In terms of posttest scores, pairwise comparisons using t-tests revealed that positive-mood males (M = 7.43, SD =  2.08) significantly outperformed neutral-mood males (M = 6.09, SD=3.41), t(66.68) = 2.194, p = .032 and positive- mood females (M = 4.78, SD = 3.43), t(81.94) = 4.619, p = .000. For mental effort, post-hoc analysis revealed that  positive-mood females (M = 4.84, SD = 1.39) significantly invested higher mental effort than did neutral-mood  females (M = 3.35, SD = 1.20), t(82) = 5.075, p = .000. Taken together, it was found that positive mood enhanced  learning performance in male learners, while promoting a recruitment of higher mental effort in female learners.      RQ3: How does negative mood affect cognitive load, germane load, intrinsic motivation, and learning  performance in multimedia learning environments?    Independent samples t-tests were conducted using the data from Experiment 2 to compare scores for NAS 1, NAS 2,  perceived task difficulty, mental effort, and posttest scores between learners in the control (neutral mood) and  110  </page> <page sequence="8"> experimental (negative mood) groups. Table 2 shows the means, standard deviations, and p-values of the t-test  analysis.    Table 2. Means, standard deviations and p-values of t-test analysis   Control (Neutral Experimental (Negative p-value (2-tailed)  Mood) Mood)  [Mean, SD] [Mean, SD]  NAS 1 (after mood induction) 21.41 (5.29) 44.41 (9.18) .000  NAS 2 (after virtual lesson) 17.50  (9.42) 26.91 (11.95) .000  Perceived task difficulty (Extraneous 2.83 (1.56) 3.37 (1.74) .113  load)  Mental effort (Germane load) 3.62 (1.29) 4.25 (1.78) .052  Intrinsic motivation 23.25 (9.32) 29.25 (9.47) .002  Posttest scores 6.42 (3.91) 3.92 (3.21) .000    Like in Experiment 1, the negative mood induction was proven to be successful; learners who received negative  mood induction reported higher negative affect scores (NAS 1) than did learners who received neutral mood  induction, t(75.15) = 15.02, p = .000. Paired-samples t-tests revealed that the levels of negative affects dropped  significantly from NAS 1 to NAS 2, for both control groups,  t(47) = 2.75, p = .008 and experimental groups, t(47) =  8.65, p = .000. This suggested that the learning process in the virtual learning system activated mood repair strategies  that lessen negative mood in learners.    With respect to posttest scores, negative-mood learners performed significantly worse than neutral-mood learners,  t(94) = 3.94, p = .000. The magnitude of the differences in the means was large (eta squared =.14). Hence, the notion  that negative mood can improve learning by recruiting a more systematic, analytical, and motivated processing was  not supported by our data. However, we observed that negative-mood learners recruited higher mental effort, t(94) =  1.96, p = .052 and intrinsic motivation, t(94) = 3.13, p = .002  than did neutral-mood learners. This finding supported  the notion that negative mood increases motivation and mental efforts in cognitive tasks.      RQ4: Does gender differently affect the impact of negative mood on cognitive load, germane load, intrinsic  motivation and learning performance in multimedia learning environments?    A 2(gender) x 2(mood condition) MANOVA was performed, with perceived task difficulty, mental effort, intrinsic  motivation and posttest scores as dependent measures. There was a significant interaction between gender and mood  conditions for intrinsic motivation, F(1,90) = 25.59, p = .000, partial eta squared = .221. Following the guidelines by  Cohen (2013), the value of the partial eta squared suggests a large effect. Post-hoc comparisons revealed that  negative-mood females (M = 34.35, SD = 7.04) reported higher intrinsic motivation than did neutral-mood females  (M = 20.53, SD = 7.82), t(52) = 6.83, p = .000. Whereas, there was no significant difference between the level of  intrinsic motivation in negative-mood males (M = 23, SD = 7.61) and neutral-mood males (M = 26.45, SD = 10.08),  t(38) = 1.199, p = .238.     Moreover, it was also found that in the neutral-mood condition, males (M = 26.45, SD = 10.08) reported higher  intrinsic motivation than did females (M = 20.53, SD = 7.82), t(46) = 2.287, p = .027. Whereas in the negative-mood  condition, females (M = 34.35, SD = 7.04) attributed higher intrinsic motivation than did males (M = 23, SD = 7.61),  t(44) = 5.174, p = .000. As part of exploratory analysis, planned comparison t-tests (split by gender) revealed that the  presence of negative mood significantly enhanced mental efforts in females (negative mood, M = 4.35, SD = .91;  neutral mood, M = 3.53, SD = 1.3), t(44.387) = 2.656, p = .01. With respect to mental effort, no significant difference  was found between negative-mood males (M = 3.77, SD = 2.51) and neutral-mood males (M = 3.72, SD = 1.31),  t(24.5) = .077, p = .935. Taken together, it was shown under the influence of negative mood; female learners were  more likely to increase their intrinsic motivation and mental effort in learning task than did male learners.      111  </page> <page sequence="9"> Discussion    Consistent with the findings from previous related studies (Mayer &amp; Estrella, 2014; Park et al., 2015; Plass et al.,  2014; Um et al., 2012), our data from Experiment 1 demonstrated the facilitating effect of positive mood on learner’s  cognition and motivation  in multimedia learning environment. Specifically, we observed that the induction of  positive mood enhanced learner’s intrinsic motivation and mental effort in the multimedia learning system. It was  also shown that the presence of positive mood lowered the perception of task difficulty in learners. This finding  supports the affect-as-information theory (Schwarz &amp; Clore, 1996). That is, learners who were put under the  influence of a positive mood employed their interpretation of their current mood to guide their judgment, thus giving  rise to positive evaluations regarding the multimedia lesson itself. As a result, happy participants were more likely to  recruit higher mental effort and intrinsic motivation when interacting with the multimedia lesson than did the control  participants.     Moreover, positive mood was found to improve learning transfer, albeit for male learners only. Hence, the notion that  positive mood may stifle working memory by causing distraction (Biss &amp; Hasher, 2011; Mitchell &amp; Phillips, 2007;  Riediger et al., 2011) was not supported in this study. Rather, the results supported the hypothesis that positive mood  may enhance learning, plausibly through the enhancement of learners’ attention span, thought flexibility, and global  integration of external information (Fredrickson &amp; Branigan, 2005; Gasper, 2003). These heightened cognitive  aspects may be particularly useful when interacting with multimedia learning systems, as multimedia learning  involves attention and integration of multiple sources of information, i.e., narration, animation, and pictures (Mayer,  2008).    On the other hand, learning transfer was impaired under the influence of negative mood (Experiment 2). Learners  who were induced with negative mood performed significantly worse in transfer test than did control learners.  Therefore, our data generally did not fit with the notion that negative mood can promote learning by encouraging a  more systematic, analytical, and comprehensive cognitive processing to new information (Forgas, 2013). In the  context of our experiment, it is unclear whether sad learners might have been overly focused on processing certain  data from the multimedia learning environment, causing thinking process to be too narrow and rigid to effectively  integrate and relate new information in novel ways (see Gasper, 2003).     Moreover, the presence of negative mood might have caused the cognitive aspect of learners to account for both  learning process and mood-repair, resulting in a decrease in working memory capacity (Brand et al., 2007; Riediger  et al., 2011). The fact that learners in Experiment 2 experienced a significant decline of negative affect after the  multimedia lesson provided evidence of mood-repair during multimedia learning. Nevertheless, it is interesting to  note that negative mood heightened learners’ intrinsic motivation and willingness to invest mental effort in  multimedia learning. This effect was more pronounced among females than males, plausibly because females are  more likely to engage in detailed processing while males tend to limit their cognitive effort, thus relying on heuristic  processing (see Martin, 2003).     Why did negative mood encourage learners to invest higher mental effort in multimedia learning? Two reasons may  account for this observation. Firstly, negative mood could have led learners to recruit a more motivated and effortful  processing as part of their mood repair mechanism (Erber &amp; Erber, 1994; Forgas, 2013). Because the cognitive  process in multimedia lesson is potentially engaging, sad learners took the opportunity to draw their mental focus on  learning, while leaving little mental space for negative rumination. Secondly, according to hedonistic discounting  theory (see Forgas, 2013), negative mood might have increased learners’ expectation of hedonistic value of future  success, which resulted in heightened perseverance and intrinsic motivation towards the cognitive task in the  multimedia environment. Perhaps, sad learners might have used their negative mood as information to interpret their  status as underperforming, which prompted them to invest higher cognitive endeavor towards the multimedia lesson  to achieve a sense of self-worth and achievement.     As discussed earlier, we like to point out that negative mood may be beneficial in cautioning learners to recruit more  effort and deliberate processing in cognitive tasks. Forgas (2013) reported that sad participants demonstrated higher  persistence and answered more questions in a challenging cognitive task than happy participants. Furthermore, as  negative mood signals that the environment is problematic, Gasper (2003) notes that a more cautious approach is  used by learners when paying attention to new to update and alter their knowledge base. Hence, if we assume that  negative mood causes a learner to put in extra effort and vigilance in cognitive task, can multimedia learning benefit  112  </page> <page sequence="10"> from negative mood? Effectively, our experiment design involved a 20-minutes multimedia presentation that did not  allow learners to control the pace or repeat the multimedia instructions. Therefore, if learners were given the  flexibility to control the pace and study the multimedia material for as long as they like, we wonder if negative mood  would have encouraged learners to spend more time and repetition in the multimedia learning environment, resulting  in enhanced transfer performance. Further studies should be conducted to seek clarification regarding this issue.      Conclusion    Our study generally showed that positive mood had a facilitation effect on cognition and motivation in a multimedia  learning system, whereas negative mood had a detrimental effect on multimedia learning. These findings  demonstrated that positive mood is desirable for learning in multimedia learning systems, while the presence of  negative mood should be mitigated. How can multimedia learning be designed to promote positive mood and to  reduce negative mood? One approach is to focus on the visceral design of the multimedia learning interface to induce  positive mood. There is a recent research trend that posits emotional design and aesthetic factors, such as colors,  anthropomorphism, layouts, and illustrations in multimedia learning systems (Heidig, 2015; Plass et al., 2014; Um et  al., 2012).     Yet another approach is to design emotionally intelligent systems that interpret learners’ mood profile and provides  appropriate feedback as part of a mood regulation strategy (see Sottilare &amp; Proctor, 2012). There is also a huge  potential for embodied emotional agents to provide social and emotional support necessary for mood corrections in  multimedia learning systems. To conclude, we highlight the need for future works to further explore the relationship  among mood, cognition, motivation, and emotion-adaptive strategies in multimedia learning environment. For  instance, because negative moods are thought to recruit systematic, cautious and deliberate processing patterns when  analyzing new data (Gasper, 2003), it would be interesting to determine if negative moods may actually promote  cognitive performance in simulation-based systems that require experimentation, hypotheses testing and discovery- based learning (Liew et al., 2014). In addition, research on how virtual agents and interfaces can be designed to  regulate learners’ moods in learning systems warrants further attention.
