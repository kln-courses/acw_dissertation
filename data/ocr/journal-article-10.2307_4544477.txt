<plain_text><page sequence="1">Meeting of the Aristotelian Society at 2 , Bedford Square, London, W C. I, on November 27th, 1950, at 7.30 p.m. II.-TIME, TRUTH AND INFERENCE. By D. F. PEARS. I. Mc Taggart's way of thinking about' time leads in the end to paradoxes of reduplication. These paradoxes are the revenge which time takes on philosophers who deprive it of its proper means of expression, temporal verbs. For temporal verbs, when they are banishedfrom their natural logical level, persist in re-appearing at a higher logical level. The usual origin of the preference for timeless verbs which generates this regress is an obscure misconception about the eternity of truth. For it is dimly felt that thoughts about the future somehow have eternal truths as their contemporary objects. Thus thought, itself a symbolic reduplication of objects, when those objects are not contemporary with it, generates surrogate contemporary objects. And, since this spurious reduplication is the ultimate source of McTaggart's conception of time, it is not surprising that McTaggart's conception of time led to more and more puzzling reduplications. And McTaggart's argument for the unreality of time, which used that conception and its attendant regress, was only a complicated way of expressing a mistaken prejudice against temporal verbs. The sun wiil rise tomorrow if and only if tomorrow's sunrise is an event which will happen. And tomorrow's sunrise is an event which will happen if and only if to- morrow's sunrise is an event which will become present. These two equivalences, taken together, express McTaggart's way of thinking about time. Now McTaggart went further B</page><page sequence="2">2 Dl. F. PEARS. down this road than most people. But most people follow it in its earlier stages. For it is such a natural way of thinking about time that it is almost unavoidable. "We may, indeed, say that the hour of death is uncertain, but when we say so we represent that hour to ourselves as situated in a vague and remote expanse of time, it never occurs to us that it can have any connection with the day that has already dawned, or may signify that death--or its first assault and partial possession of us, after which it will never leave hold of us again-may occur this very afternoon, so far from uncertain, this afternoon, every hour of which has already been allotted to soxne occupation."' But, although McTaggart's way of thinking about time is almost inevitable, it leads in tlle end to puzzling reduplica- tions. For it suggests that the death becomes present in the same way that the man dies, that the sunrise becomes present in the same way that the eastern sky becomes pale. And, if this suggestion were correct, we could ask how quickly the sunrise becomes present. But, as Smart pointed out, this question could be answered only by someone who possessed a second time-scale.2 And we can neutralize the suggestion which led to the question by pointing out that temporal predicates are not like non- temporal predicates, that " present " is not like " pale." McTaggart's way of thinking about time also suggests that time causes the- sunrise to become present in the same way that the spinning of the earth causes the eastern sky to become pale. Now tim.e is usually made into a cause only when it is difficult to name an ordinary cause for an event " Hans Castorp's hair and nails grew too, grew rather fast. He sat very often in the barber's chair in the main street of the Dorf, wrapped in a white sheet . .. First time, and then the barber performed their office upon him."3 But, if time is ever a cause, it is always a cause. And, if time is always a cause, then wherever we succeed in finding another cause we shall have two causes on our hands. But this is an idle 1 Proust: Remembrance of Things Past: Tr. Scott Moncrieff, Vol. VI, p. $3. 2 Smart: " The River of Time ": Mind, October, 1949 3 Mann The Magic Mountain, c. VII.</page><page sequence="3">TIME, TRUTH AND INFERENCE. 3 reduplication of causes. And we can neutralize it by pointing out, as Smart pointed out, that events are unlike things, that the sunrise is unlike the eastern sky, so that it is impossible for a cause to alter the sunrise in the same wvay that a cause alters the eastern sky. Now to point out that temporal predicates are unlike non-temporal predicates and that events are unlike things is to neutralize the suggestions contained in the second equivalence ; that tomorrow's sunrise is an event which will occur if and only if it is an event whicth will become pre-sent. So it might appear that it is this second equivalence which is solely responsible for the two reduplications. But in a way which is almost too obvious to be noticed the two reduplications are also partly the fault of the first equivalence: that the sun will rise tomorrow if and only if tomorrow's sunrise is an event which will occur. For this equivalence throws the main verb into the present tense, and relegates the future tense to a subordinate clause. And this transformation in itself contains the suggestion of a falsehood. It suggests that tomorrow's sunrise is somehow a con- temporary thing. And, though it does not go as far as the second equivalence goes, though it does not suggest that tomorrow's sunrise is a genuine thing which genuine causes alter with genuine celerity, yet the suggestion which it does contain, that tomorrow's sunrise is somehow a contemporary thing, is much more primitive and fantastic.4 For, if tomorrow's sunrise were a contemporary thing, then one of its contemporary properties would be that it would happen in the future: it would be about to happen in the same way that at a later date it would be happening. Yet, at the time when it was still only about to happen, an inventory of relevant contemporary items would contain at the most a man believing that it would happen, his belief, perhaps the words in which his belief was expressed, and the evidence and memories on which it was based. Contrast the man 4 Cf I. Silone, " The Seed Beneath the Snow," tr. Frances Frenaye, p. 352: "With the use of the infinitive " (instead of temporal verbs) " evervthing becomes present ; there is no more past or future, only a sense of the infinite. Even in speaking of an event long since gone by, or of a future action, as if by magic the past repeats itself and the future becomes imminent." R ?.</page><page sequence="4">4 Dl. F. PEARS. who believes that the sun is actually rising. If he is correct, lhe can have before his eyes the rising sun, or, if he wants an event, the sunrise. Only he will not find this reduplication in the presence attractive. For, as Wisdom has pointed out,5 the sunrise is only a sort of logical shadow of the rising sun ; and who would care about the shadow when he has the thing which casts it ? But the other man, who believes that the sun will rise, cannot have the thing which casts the shadow. And, since beliefs about contemporary properties of contemporary things are the most likely to be correct, he consoles himself by pretending that the logical shadow, which is timeless, is really a contemporary thing, and that one of its contemporary properties is that it will happen in the future. For mnost of us the surrogate contemporary things which duplicate the past are less imposing. This is partly because there is memory, and impersonation of the familiar is more difficult ; and partly because the future is in a practical way more interesting. But for McTaggart, who followed this way of thinking to what he believed to be its conclusion, the past was impersonated by tim.eless events just as much as the future. Languages show how exceptional this disinterested thoroughness of McTaggart's was. For according to Jesperson, the way in which many languages form their future tenses makes them less independent of the present than their past tenses are.6 For, though it is true that the perfect tense expresses what has happened by its effects in the present, the other past tense usually stands on its own feet. Contrast the future tense, which often expresses -what will happen by its causes in the present. English and French use the idea of motion: " It is going to," " II va." English and Modern Greek use the idea of volition: "It will," " Oa." And English and Italian use the idea of obligation: "I shall," " Scrivero " (from the Romanic form scribere-habeo, I have to write). Per- haps the reason why these future tenses are not detached from the present is that they are referring to the present 5 " Logical Constructions," II, Mind, 1931, p. 460. 6jespersen; The Philosophy of Grammar, pp. 260-261 and p. 269.</page><page sequence="5">TIME, TRUTH AND INFERENCE. 5 signs of future events on the principle that a statement which is based on flimsy evidence ought to contain a reference to that evidence. For in a way the going to be, the wishing to be, and the being obliged to be are contemr- porary evidence. Or perhaps these future tenses should be regarded as impostors which desperately misuse anthro- pomorphic ideas in order to build between the present and the future the sort of logically unshakable bridge which Hume showed to be logically impossible. For sometimes the future tense does impose on us in this way. But anyway McTaggart's conception of time does not depend on a projection of present evidence beyond the bounds of logical possibility into the future. It uses another device, which is in a way the opposite of this one. This is the device of making the timeless shadows of the future (and the past) into contemporary things. And this is achieved by making the timeless present tense refer to any time when really it refers to no time. This misconception about the eternity of truth is so bizarre that it must have been thrown up by a strong desire to know the future. For if I say " That sunrise is an event which will occur," it is obvious that the main verb is timeless and that the indication of the time of the event has been delegated to the subordinate verb, which must change its tense with the time of utterance. After all, if the main verb really referred to the present time, it would be premature. For " being an event " is a sort of ontological diploma awarded to a possibility which has been successful in the competition for actuality ; and the award must await the result. The main verb, by detaching itself from the time of the event, has not left itself free to be attached to the time of utterance. When it shuffled off its only proper time it shuffled off all time. Now " being true " is another ontological diploma of success, like " being an event" only, unlike " being an event," it is awarded not to possibilities but to the sentences and propositions which describe them. And, if I say " It is true that the sun will rise tomorrow," it is equally obvious that the main verb is timeless, and that the indica-</page><page sequence="6">6 D. F. PEARS. tion of the time of the event has been delegated to the subordinate verb, which must change its tense with the time of utterance. Now Tarski's equivalence, " The sun will rise tomorrow if and only if it is true that the sun will rise tomorrow," makes no attempt to conceal its ascent to the timeless heaven of logicians. For, unlike an event, a truth is quite overtly a timeless logical shadow. A truth does not even masquerade as a substance. It is merely a lucky substantival clause. Yet it is the eternity of truth which lies beneath McTaggart's conception of time and its attendant reduplications. This comes out very clearly in his celebrated argument for the unreality of time.7 For he claimed that events have properties which do not change. His example was the death of Queen Anne. " . . . That it has such causes, that it has such effects-every characteristic of this sort," he claimed, "never changes." And this claim is a conflation of two sentences. The first is "The death of Queen Anne is an event which was caused by r and which caused A.." And the second is: " It is true that Queen Anne died because y, and that because she died B" Only McTaggart failed to put the subordinate verbs in his compound sentence into the past tense. He said " That Queen Anne's death has such causes, that it has such effects . . The largest block capitals in the world would not over- emphasize this mistake of McTaggart's. It is the most important point in his argument for the unreality of time. And I shall use it as a pivot on which to turn his whole argument upside down, and show that his conclusion ought to have been not the unreality of time but the unreality of timelessness. McTaggart showed that the subordinate verbs which link temporal predicates to events must change their tenses with the time of utterance ; that, for instance, in the twentieth century we can only say that Queen Anne's death is an event which was future. And he showed that, if we want to relieve this subordinate verb of the duty of changing its tense with the time of utterance, we must drag in another 7 McTaggart: Philosophical Studies, c.V.</page><page sequence="7">TIME, TRUTH AND INFERENCE. 7 subordinate verb to perform this duty.8 This co-opting of another subordinate verb is achieved if we say: " There is a moment, at which Queen Anne's death is an event which is future, and which is past." And in this sentence the fourth " is " is temporal, and must change its tense with the time of utterance. And McTaggart showed that this fourth " is" can be made timeless only if we enfold the whole sentence in yet another logical wrapping : " There is a moment, at which . . . , and which is present." And here again the last " is " is temporal. And this, he said, quite rightly, is an infinite regress. But what drove McTaggart down this infinite regress ? He was haunted by the mistaken idea that an event possesses timelessly the three incompatible characteristics, pastness, presentness and futurity. And he realized that he could escape this spurious contradiction only by making the subordinate verb, which linked a temporal predicate to an event, change its tense with the time of utterance. But he thought that making this verb temporal was tantamount to saying, for instance: " There is a moment at which Queen Anne's death is an event which is future, and which is past." And he thought this only because he had an obsessional preference for timeless verbs. And this obsession created the spectral contradiction which pursued him down the infinite regress. For this spectre, when it had been exor- cized from one logical level, only reappeared on the next higher logical level. He thought he could free an event froni the factitious contradiction inherent in its timeless possession of the three incompatible temporal predicates only by transferring this factitious contradiction to a moment: and that he could free this moment only by sacrificing another moment ; and so ad infinitum. But the spectre was only the creation of his prejudice against temporal verbs. And the regress was only the result of attempting the impossible operation of freeing from temporality the subordinate verbs which link temporal predicates to events. Now McTaggart failed to see that this operation cannot be performed even on the verbs which 8 Cf. Broad: Examination of McTaggart's Philosophy, Pt. I, p. 314,</page><page sequence="8">8 D. F. PEARS. link non-temporal predicates to events. And he failed to see this because he made the crucial mistake of saying " That Queen Anne's death HAS such causes, that it HAS such effects-every characteristic of this sort never changes." But it is not caused in a certain way: it was caused in a certain way. And McTaggart made this crucial mistake because, like most logicians, he was too pre-occupied with adjectives to pay any attention to verbs. For, when the predicates are non-temporal, the alleged incompatibility cannot lie in the predicates, but only in the verbs which link them to events : whereas, when the predicates are temporal, the alleged incompatibility can lie in the predicates. But this difference is only the result of making events into substances, so that what was previously expressible only by a temporal verb can now be expressed by a temporal predicate. And why should one be worried by an alleged incompati- bility of predicates, and not by an alleged incompatibility of verbs ? And, if McTaggart had realized that the operation of freeing from temporality cannot be performed even on the verbs which link non-temporal predicates to events, he might have seen that the regress is not peculiar to temporal predicates. And, if he had seen this, he might have realized that his whole argument against the reality of time is only the expression of a general prejudice against temporal verbs. And, if he had realized this, he might have abandoned this prejudice and accepted in its place the natural tendency of ordinary people to use temporal verbs. And, if he had done this, his conclusion would have been not the unreality of time, but the unreality of timelessness. Now, because McTaggart was a disinterested meta- physician, he treated the past just like the future, and he did not try to reintroduce his timeless shadows into the present moment. But most people are metaphysicians who are not disinterested. And it is because they want to have the future somehow in the present that they try to make timeless shadows into surrogate contemporary things. But the unreality of timelessness baffles all their attempts to reach iInto the future and drag something out of it into the</page><page sequence="9">TIME, TRUTH AND INFERENCE. 9 present. For they only succeed in grasping more and more absolutely transparent logical wrappings, which will not be noticed in the future when they clothe things, and which cannot be seen when they have got them into the present where there is nothing for them to clothe. For who, in the presence of the thing, would bother to say "There is a moment, at which .. ., and which is present " ? And who, in the absence of the thing, would say it with as much conviction as he would say it, if he bothered to say it, in the presence of the thing ? The reason why McTaggart's way of thinking about time leads to reduplications is that it springs from thc very nature of thought, which is itself a sort of symbolic re- duplication of reality. For beliefs in a way reduplicate objects. And those beliefs which are contemporary with their objects are the most likely to be correct. Hence thlose beliefs which are not contemporary with their objects, in a spirit of rivalry, treat timeless shadows as if they were contemporary objects. A perfect example of this self-deception is cited by Aristotle in the De Interpretatione.9 He there presents and refutes the argument that, if today it is true that there will be a sea-battle tomorrow, then there will be a sea-battle tomnorrow: but that today it is either true or not true ; and so that we must either accept determinism or reject the law of excluded 'middle. Few people are deluded by this overt argument. For it is difficult to believe that one could determine the whole future if only one could utter true sentences sufficiently quickly. And it is easy to see that truth is not a contemporary property of sentences like being chanted. But it is easy to be deceived when the same argument is put more covertly, as in : " If I knew the future it would all be determined," or in: "If I could see future events they would be bound to happen." For people want to be deceived. They want to have the future in the present. But they can only have its shadow. And, since one reduplication leads to another, they find that they have not only shadow-things but a shadow-time and a shadow-cause. This is time's revenge. 9 18 A 33 ff.</page><page sequence="10">10 D. F. PEARS. IL This conclusion, that the truth of a sentence is a timeless shadow and therefore cannot determine the event which the sentence describes, can be extended so as to apply not only to categorical sentences, but also to hypothetical sentences, both singular and general. But in the case of hypotheticals, if" determine" means not " make- the opposite logically impossible " but " make the opposite causally impossible," there is something which can determine the event described in the consequent, and that is the event described in the antecedent. To say this is to speak anthropomor- phically, but anthropomorphism is harmless so long as it does not confuse causal and logical necessity. And it is important to be thoroughly anthropomorphic and not to forget that the verb in the antecedent which describes the determining event is temporal. For failure to realize this generates one of the puzzles of determinism. The suggestion that the truth of a categorical sentence determines the future event which it describes is unconvinc- ing. For one event can be determined only by another event, and not by a timeless shadow. And the mistake in the argument cited by Aristotle is the mistake of taking the samne inference twice over, once as a deductive inference, and once as an inductive inference. And this is yet another of the illicit reduplications which spring from McTaggart's conception of time. No inference can lead to a novel conclusion with logical certainty. And anyway " making the opposite logically impossible " is a degenerate case of determination. It is completely effective, and yet its effect is never felt. In fact the event might be described as self- determined if we were not too jealous to extend this description to events whose seats are not persons but things. For, if there is nothing to determine an event except the truth of the sentence which describes it, there is no lever in the present which could move the event in the future. And this applies not only to categorical sentences but also to hypothetical sentences. However the suggestion that the truth of hypothetical sentences determines the future events to which they apply,</page><page sequence="11">TIME, TRUTH AND INFERENCE. 11 though equally false, is less unconvincing. It is less un- convincing because in the case of some hypotheticals there is something to do the determining ; there is the antecedent event. Now we should not say that the antecedent event determined the consequent event unless we believed that the hypothetical was true. But from this it does not follow that it is the truth of the hypothetical or the truth of any other sentence which determines the consequent event. Nor could it follow. For the timeless cannot determine. Nor does " determine " here mean " make the opposite logically impossible," but " make the opposite causally impossible." For the inference now leads to a novel conclusion and therefore forfeits logical certainty and affects to follow the track of causal necessity. But what is causal necessity? This is a difficult question. For whereas logical necessity achieves nothing in a way which can easily be described, causal necessity achieves much in a way which defies description. For in the case of a singular hypothetical the antecedent event either is made to happen by us, or is made to happen by some other event, or just happens (since we do not know that every event has a cause). And, however it happens, it is a lever in the present, which, we say, moves the consequent event in the future. But we should say that it was logically impossible for the consequent event not to happen only if we had been given not only the truth of the antecedent, but also the truth of the hypothetical. But unfortunately we never are given the truth of the hypothetical until we have been given the truth of the consequent (I omit consideration of those queer cases where the antecedent is false). So, though we have a lever in the present, we have no fulcrum until the future event has happened. And then the lever and fulcrum are no longer needed. And a general hypothetical is an endless conjunction of singular hypotheticals, only one of which applies to a particular future event. And, though we have not yet been given the truth of this or any other singular hypothetical which applies to a future event, often we have been given the truth of many of the others which apply to past events.</page><page sequence="12">12 D. F. PEARS. And it is easy to overlook the incompleteness of the particular singular hypothetical which interests us, since so many of the others are already complete. But unfortunately we shall not have been given the truth of the general hypothetical until we, have been given the truth of this particular and singular hypothetical and per impossibile of all the others too. So, though we may have a large set of levers, they are no use to us. For each one either has no fulcrum, or else the event which it was to move has already happened anyway. The universe is like a signal-box constructed by Kafka, and we are the signal-men. We desperately try to alter the signals, but always the rod on which the levers are pivoted is just not quite long enough to reach the particular lever which we want to use. And, by the time that we have succeeded in extending it so that it will provide this lever too with a fulcrum, the signal which we wanted to alter has already altered itself. And, even if we were signal-men living in the sort of utopia in which all the levers moved themselves, they could never move quickly enough to be any use. Yet the extraordinary thing is that, if the lever is the last of a long row of levers, it seems to us that it moved as if it already had a fulcrum. This description of causal necessity, like any other description of causal necessity, is a ghost story. If a real signal-man told it we should call him superstitious. We might ask him if he really thought that someone was holding on to the lever at its pivotal point. Superstition, as Wittgenstein said,10 is the belief in the causal nexus. But we say this only when we compare causal with logical necessity. And this is all that my analogy does. It pretends to mechanize logical necessity in a way which suggests that it competes in the same field with causal necessity. And it ensures that causal necessity will lose in this unreal com- petition by making it work in an uncanny way. After all, if causal necessity is a poltergeist, logical necessity is the sort of traditional ghost whiclh very conspicuously does nothing. 11 Tractatus, 5.1361.</page><page sequence="13">TIME, TRUTH AND INFERENCE. 13 But, quite apart from superstition, this description of causal necessity is anthropomorphic. However, such an- thropomorphism is natural and harmless so long as it does not confuse causal and logical necessity. But, if we are going to adopt this anthropomorphic manner of speaking, we must be thorough about it. We must realize that, when one event determines another, this determination, or making the opposite causally impossible, is something which happens in time. And that those events, whose causes, if they have any, are unknown to us, for all we know determine themselves. And that, once an event has been determined by another event or has determined itself, no subsequent event can determine it any further. For failure to grasp these three points leads to a curious puzzle. The puzzle is this. An objection might be made to my assumption that only the earlier determines the later. For it might be urged that this is a mistake, since, wherever there is a causal inference, we say that the event which is the sufficient condition of the other event determines that other event; and some sufficient conditions are later than the events which they are said to determine. And from this it would follow that the future determines the past, or, dropping the reference to the time of utterance, that the later determines the earlier. But this is absurd. Therefore the whole anthropomorphic presentation of causality must be abandoned. And I failed to see this only because I confused the consequent with the subsequent. But the objection and the puzzle which it presents are both ill-considered. For those who say the future deter- mines the past forget that " the future " is a phrase of success which must not be used prematurely. And they forget that determining is something which is done in time, and so should properly be described with a temporal verb. The very most that they could be entitled to say-and in a few moments we shall see that even this is too much-is that what will happen, when it happens, will determine what has happened. But will it happen ? In a way the future tense can be an impostor. For it suggests that there is something now happening which guarantees that some-</page><page sequence="14">14 D. F. PEARS. thing else will happen. And this suggestion becomes almost irresistible when the task of indicating the time of the event is delegated to a phrase of success, like " the future," and the main verb is made timeless, like " determines." Now of course the suggestion might be correct. It might be the case that somne third event was a sufficient condition of the particular future event. But, if this third event were past, and had happened at an earlier date than the other past event, then, though we might say that the future determines the past, we should also say that the pluperfect determines the future, and so that, indirectly, it is really the pluperfect which determines the past. Or, dropping these timeless distortions and the elaborate system of reference to the time of utterance, we should say that the earlier event, as always, determined the later event, but indirectly, through an even later event. But, supposing that either there was no present or past event which was a sufficient condition of the future event, or that there was but that it was not earlier than the original past event, what should we say then ? Surely in both these cases we should be driven to say that the later event deter- mines the earlier event ? Well the very most that we can say at the time when the earlier event happens is that the later event will determine it. But even this is too much. For, when an event has already happened, either it has already been determined by an earlier event or it has already determined itself. And in either case there is no determining left for its later sufficient condition to do. An event cannot have done more than have happened. And there is something very odd about saying that a later sufficient condition will make it causally im.possible for it not to have happened. For one cannot obey a perfect imperative in the same way that one obeys a present imperative. After all, if the event had already not hap- pened, the most that its alleged sufficient condition could achieve by happening would be to falsify the relevant general hypothetical and so prevent itself from being a sufficient condition. In short, if we are going to describe this situation anthropomorphically, we must be thorough</page><page sequence="15">TIME, TRUTH AND INFERENCE. 15 about it and take account of temporal priority. We must say not that the later event will make it causally impossible for the earlier event not to have happened, but that the earlier event made it causally possible for the later event to happen. Of course we mnight say both. But we cannot really mean both. For, if we did, we should be taking the same causal nexus twice over: and this reduplication, which is yet another remote result 'of McTaggart's conception of time, would defeat the whole purpose of anthropomorphism, which is to locate the responsibility for an event. Curiously enough it is easier to accept this thorough anthropomorphism when the later event is a necessary condition. Yet the two cases are precisely symmetrical. For, when an event has already not happened, there is no determining left for its later necessary condition to do. An event cannot have done less than not happen. And there is something very odd about saying that a later necessary condition, by not happening, will make it causally impossible for it to have happened. After all, if the event had already happened, the most that its alleged necessary condition could achieve by not happening would be to falsify the relevant general hypothetical and so prevent itself from being a necessary condition. In short here too it all depends on which comes first, and consistent anthropomorphism should lead us to say that the earlier event, by not happening, made it causally possible for the later event not to happen and not that the later event, by not happening, made it causally impossible for the earlier event to have happened and not both. It is this anthropomorphism which lies beneath the traditional distinction between ratio essendi and ratio cognoscendi. But unfortunately this distinction is not quite sharp enough, and so does not succeed in developing anthropomorphism to the point at which it is free from puzzles. For it is easy to say that conditions of events, both sufficient and necessary, are rationes cognoscendi and rationes essendi when they precede their events, but that, when they follow their events, they are only rationes cognoscendi. But somneone might object, in the spirit of</page><page sequence="16">16 D. F. PEARS. Hegel, that surely all rationes cognoscendi must also be rationes essendi even when they are subsequent to their events. For surely the gerund " essendi " is timeless, and can refer to past time so that the event can precede its condition. And, if this objection were made, it could be countered only by the introduction of a new kind of ratio, ratio efficiendi. Then -ratio cognoscendi would always also be ratio essendi, but not also ratio efficiendi unless it preceded its event. For, though the gerund " efficiendi " is timeless, the meaning of " bringing about " ensures that it can only refer to a time previous to the event. And thus the anthropomorphic weltanschauung is made consistent and impeccable. The chief source of the puzzle about the future determin- ing the past is the old mistake of tampering with temporal verbs. And the temptations to make this mistake are in this case many and insidious. First there is a general prejudice against anthropomorphism because some philosophers have misused it against Hume: but this misuse is avoidable. Secondly logicians generally deal in truths 'and falsehoods, and so -readily forget that the truth of the antecedent of a singular hypothetical, though a timeless shadow, is never- theless the timeless shadow of a temporal event: but, if it were not, there would be nothing to do the determining. Then, more particularly, all inductive inferences can be cast in a form in which there is an element of deduction, and logical necessity cannot figure on time's stage because it is not that sort of ghost: but there is always also an element of induction, and causal necessity can figure on tim.e's stage. And finally all inductive inferences depend somehow on an open general hypothetical, and open general hypotheticals are expresseo timelessly : but this is only because they are in a way too full of time to express it in one verb. Russell said11 that time's arrow is irrelevant to determin- ismn. And, if I an right, his arguments for this thesis illustrate the mnistakes which I have been trying to expose. He dwells on the fact that inductive inference often runs 11" )On the Notion of Cause " in Mysticism and Logic.</page><page sequence="17">TIME, TRUTH AND INFERENCE. 17 counter to time's arrow, and claims that therefore later events can determine earlier events. And, in the only other sense of " determine," the sense in which it means " make the opposite logically impossible," he claims that the future is as determined as the past: for, though what has happened has happened, there is an equally good tautology about the future, that what will happen will happen. Now the first of these two claims would be valid if the second was. For, unless past events had already been determined in some sense in which future events had not already been determined, future events would sometimes be able to determine past events. But according to the second claim past events are not determined in any sense in which future events are not also determined. But this second claim is erroneous. For " What will happen will happen " only says " x (x will happen ) x will happen) " : and this is only a general sentential function which could be completed in various ways so as to yield a series of tautological singular hypo- thetical sentence-s about future events. But, if the future events described in the consequents of these hypotheticals are only determined by the future events described in their antecedents they are only self-determined. For the two sets of events are identical. In fact it is just like saying that there will be a sea-battle tomorrow if it is true that there will be a sea-battle tomorrow. And, if they are only self- determined, since they are future events it is more correct to say that they will be determined when they happen. And this future tense is important. For past events, which in a similar way are only self-determined, have been determined already. And this difference in tense is an important difference between the two tautologies. Russell ignored it only because, like McTaggart and most logicians, he was preoccupied with adjectives and neglected verbs. But it is a sufficiently important difference to invalidate Russell's second claim. And, since his second claim is false, his first claim is false too. The timneless heaven of logicians has been lifted above the world of temporal happening. But this elevation is merely the work of thought. And, though traffic in truths C</page><page sequence="18">tl. F. PEARS. and falsehoods is usually harmless, it can sometimes be dangerous. It is dangerous when people descend again from the logicians' heaven to the world of temporal happen- ing without making it clear that they are descending. This is what Russell does when he uses " determines " timelessly. The remedy is to take the particular sentence -which has a timeless verb and rewrite it with a verb which does indicate time. And this simple transcription is all that is needed against McTaggart, who makes the same mistake on a much larger scale and much more tendenti- ously. 'For the reinstatement of temporal verbs is the best possible, indeed almost the only possible vindication of the reality of time. Moore said that there are temporal facts. Anyone who is thorough about the reinstatement of temporal verbs is really saying that there are no non-temporal facts. III. Inquiries into the source of this temporal weltanschauung never progress very far. Either they reach the unexciting result that we use temporal verbs because events happen in time: or else they go a little further and come back with definitions of the past and the future. But these definitions, which ought to be very important, are curiously inadequate. The reason for the baffling inadequacy of this result is that time is a category. When Russell said that what will happen will happen, it seemed not quite enough to answer very loudly " Yes, but what has happened has happened." Something more than mere emphasis of temporal words seemed to be needed. For instance it would be more satisfying to know why we talk like this. And it is not good enough to say that we talk like this because events happen in time. Some more detailed reasons are needed, perhaps some definitions. For, if we could produce some good definitions of the past and future, we should be able to say that we could not talk about the past or future unless we could also talk about their definientia: and that we could not taik about their definientia unless we experienced them. And this might represent some progress. For it would enable us to point to</page><page sequence="19">TIME, TRUTH AND INFERENCE. 19 those features in our experience which are Necessary and Sufficient conditions of the use of temporal verbs (I use capital letters to indicate conditions which are not causally necessary or sufficient, but logically Necessary or Sufficient). Now Russell12 admitted that " we all regard the past as determined simply by the fact that it has happened." But he immediately neutralized this admission by suggesting that " but for the accident that memory works backward and not forward we should regard the future as equally determined by the fact that it will hiappen." But this suggestion either does not go far enough, or else, in a self- frustrating way, it goes too far. The way in which it would not go far enough is this. Russell may have meant that we might have no memory of the past, but that we might have instead some faculty for knowing the future which was in every other way just like memnory, say precognition. And then, he suggested, we should say that the future was determined. Now I waive the difficulty that if we could not remnember the past we should not say anything, if " waive " is a strong enough word for this difficulty. For I want to concentrate oxi the difficulty concealed in the words " in every other way." Precognition cannot differ from memory only in telling us about the future. For, if it tells us about the future, it tells us about something which usually has not yet been deter- mined; whereas memory, which tells us about the past, tells us about something which has always already been determined. Of course this might be called part of the same difference. But in that case this difference is big enough to ensure that we should not say that the future was determined. And so Russell's suggestion would not go far enough. And the way in which it would go too far is this. Russell may have meant that we might have no memory of the past, but that we might have instead, in the fullest sense, memory of the future. 13 But now there is a difficulty concealed in the words " in tlle fullest sense." If we really remembered the 12 L.c., p. 202 (1921 edition). 13 Cf. Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking Class, c.V.</page><page sequence="20">20 D. F. PEARS. future it would not be the future but the past. For one good definition of the past is " what it is logically possible to remember." Now this is not the definition of the past, since there may be others equally good. But, even if it is only one definition among many, being something which it is logically possible to remember is at least a Sufficient Condition of being past. And so Russell would have made the toy soldier turn right about only by turning the toy parade-ground right about; and in this self-frustrating way his suggestion would go too far. Bradley once executed a similar manoeuvre and overshot the mark in a similar way.14 He said that we necessarily look forward to the source of events in the same way that fishes necessarily face the direction from which their food comes. And that events come from the future, just as fishes' food comes from upstream. And he suggested that, just as a river might flow backwards, so in the Absolute the direction of the flow of time might be reversed ; so that events would come from the past, and consequently we should look forward to the past. Now enough has been said about the general difficulties of this metaphor. Here there is an additional particular difficulty, which is that, whereas it is only a contingent fact that a river flows in a certain direction, it is not a contingent fact that events come from the future. For one quite good (but not very good) definition of the future is " the source of events." And so events would not come from the past unless the past became the future. And, if we are like fishes at all, we are like fishes which can never see either the bed of the stream or its banks. There is little left of the river of time. So far my enquiry has led to two definitions: that the past is what it is logically possible to remember ; and that the future is the source of events. But neither of these definitions is very satisfactory. For memory itself can hardly be defined without somne reference to the past: and we can explain the phrase " the source of events " only by saying that the events meant have not yet happened, or had not yet happened, or will not have yet happened. And other 14 Appearance and Reality, p. I89.</page><page sequence="21">TIME, TRUTH AND INFERENCE. 21 definitions of the past and future seem to lie along the circumferences of equally small circles. Suppose, for instance, that we tried defining the future as what our wishes (and other things too) can alter. Now there is something wrong with saying that the future can be altered, since the future is necessarily the successful survivor of alterations whose victims are only possible futures. The future cannot be altered in the way in which a man cannot change his clothes until he has dressed ; whereas the past cannot be altered in the way in which, when he has dressed, he cannot now succeed in having changed his clothes then. However we can evade this difficulty by saying that our wishes can make the future different from what it would have been without them. But then we are beset by another difficulty. For making is causal efficacy: and temporal priority is a Necessary Condition of causal efficacy. And thus we here come round a circle which has a circumference which is only a very little longer than the others. Now Russell and Ramsey were worried because no attempts to push this inquiry further have met with any greater success. Russell complained that it is a mere tautology that our wishes can cause the future to be different from what it would have been without them. And Ramsey said :15 " It is, it seems, a fundamental fact that the future is due to the present, or, more mildly, is affected by the present, but the past is not. What does this mean ? It is not clear, and, if we try to make it clear, it turns into nonsense or a definition." I shall now try to discover the precise deficiencies of these definitions or tautologies, and the reason for them. Now first of all we have no right to complain because our inquiry has led only to definitions. For definitions are not always adopted capriciously, but are often firmly based on contingencies. For instance, if we noticed that a certain substance always exhibits a certain property, we should be justified in making that property a defining property of the substance. But, though there is nothing wrong with 15 The Foundations of AMathematics, p. 249.</page><page sequence="22">22 D. F. PEARS. definitions in general, definitions of the past and future are peculiarly inadequate. For, whereas the defining properties of a substance can themselves usually be defined without reference to that substance, the definientia of the past and future themselves immediately involve again the past and future. Now, as Wisdom has shown,16 one of the things which metaphysicians do is to seek definientia which in no way involve their definienda. But it is impossible to define the past and future in this way because, whereas gold and its melting-point are separately observable, time and its definientia are not. For time figures in all our experience without ever obtruding itself. In fact it is a category. And, because time is a category and figures unobtrusively in all our experience, it is possible to define the past and future in many different ways and yet none of these defini- tions is very convincing. For the sentences which give the logical relations of temporal words exhibit a curious feature. They are not synthetic a priori, but they are, as it were, weak tautologies.- And they are weak tautologies not only because we are so accustomed to using temporal words correctly that we need no strong reminders, but also because their structure is peculiar. For most tautologies are constructed like columns, by placing terms squarely one on top of another like marble drums. But the tautologies which give the logic of temporal words put their terms together like the stones of a vault. No single conjunction of terms is indispensable or could stand alone. But together they form the vaulted ceiling on which the fresco of know- ledge is painted. And, because time is a category and figures unobtrusively in all our experience, it gives logicians no room to manccuvre. Russell thought that memorability is some- thing which is necessarily connected with being determined, but only contingently connected with being past. But, on my second interpretation, he was wrong, since it is also necessarily connected with being past. And Bradley thought that being the source of events is something which is 16 '" Metaphysics and Verification," Mind, 1938, p. 465 if.</page><page sequence="23">TIME, TRUTH AND INFERENCE. 23 necessarily connected with being what we look forward to, but only contingently connected with being the future. But he was wrong, since it is also necessarily connected with being the future. And we cannot even say -that these definientia of the past and future, like the definientia of gold, were originally discovered to be attached synthetically and only afterwards attached analytically. For time is not an object of discovery, but a sort of elusive atmosphere in which discovery is done. And, since the definientia of the past and future never were attached synthetically to the past and future, if we try to detach them, we are embarking on a gedankenexperiment which can only end in one of three ways. Either, like Russell on my first interpretation, we choose something which is only synthetically connected with being past, and then, through this looseness in the apparatus, the experiment never really begins. Or-and this is what happens to most people-the experiment begins, we do some indescribable violence to our concepts, destroy the vital atmosphere of thought and come out with our heads reeling. Or else, like Russell on my second interpretation and like Bradley, we succeed in shifting the definientia of the past and future, but only by shifting the past and future with them. In short temporal tautologies are so firmly based that it is impossible that we shall ever succeed in dismantling them and exposing their foundations. Of course we can always say that temporal tautologies are based on the fact that events happen in time: but this is no more informative than saying that the foundations of a building go down into the site on which it stands. But how exactly does time figure as an unobtrusive category in all our experience ? If we look at the words which report this experience we find that time is expressed predominantly by the tenses of verbs. For even other ways of expressing time are usually reinforced by temporal verbs. Now one of the things which Aristotle meant by a category was a mode of verbs. And it is partly because the category of time is the temporal mode of verbs that it is so elusive. For most logicians"7 have concentrated on nouns and adjec- 17 Reichenbach is a conspicuous exception. Cf. Elements of Symbolic Logic, C. VII, ? 51.</page><page sequence="24">24 D. F. PEARS. tives and have neglected verbs except where they can be reduced to present participles attached by a timeless copula. And this neglect of tenses is now so natural to us that we do not recognize that tenses can play an important part in tautologies. Yet, if we replace tenses by temporal nouns or adjectives, though the tautologies which we get are much more fashionable, they are somehow not sufficient- ly closely connected with ordinary language. For people do not talk about the future and the past nearly so often as they use temporal verbs. Nor do people, for instance, learn the meaning of " past " explicitly and separately ; that it is no good crying over spilt milk and that the past cannot be altered. But this particular inadequacy of temporal tautologies, though real, is the result of an illusion. For tautologies which depend on temporal verbs are as good as those which depend on temporal piedicates. And so there is no need to replace " what has happened " by " the past" or "what will happen " by " the future," no need to adopt inadequate versions of temporal tautologies. But the other ways in which the categorial nature of time is responsible for the inadequacies of temporal tautologies are in no way illusory. For we cannot make temporal tautologies less circular, stronger or easier to dismantle. We must accept that in these three ways temporal tautologies cannot be improved, and we can console ourselves with the reflection that we have a good nam.e for the source of this limitation-the categorial nature of time.</page></plain_text>
