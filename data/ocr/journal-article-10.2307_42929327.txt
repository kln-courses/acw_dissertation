<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE S ABARA-BHÃSYA TO RGVEDA EXEGESIS/1 OR THE TREATMENT BY S ABARA OÇ THE RGVEDA PASSAGES CITED IN HIS BHÃSYA. By D. V. Garge. Group 2 : Passages ci ted for determining the nature of the Vedic Deities. JSIX.i. 6-10 forming what is known as the Devatādhikaraņa, discuss an interesting topic viz. the nature of the Vedic Deities. We read in Vedic literature graphic descriptions of various Deities- their parentage, physique, their associates and various interesting anecdotes connected with them. The problem raised here is whether the Deities have in reality, material bodies of flesh and blood ; or the descriptions seen in the Vedic texts are mere allegories ? The Pūrvapaksin states that the motif of the entire Vedic ritual is to please the Gods so that our happiness in this life as well as in the next might be ensured. These Gods or Deities who are the objects of our worship and adoration, accept with their material bodies, all that we offer them in sacrificial performances and they in return, extend their favour and protection towards us. The deities are, therefore, just like our guests whom we entertain with gift and service, the only difference being that a Deity is invisible to the mortal eye. That the Deities have got limbs like human beings is indicated beyond doubt, by the following Vedic passages. Smrti texts and custom also corroborate this view regar- ding the form of the Deities. RV X. 47. lab srçwïT ft ^uiÍH'3 q&amp;TH 1 ] Trans : - Desirous of treasure, we have taken hold of the right hand. O Indra - Lord of treasures.

RV VÍII. 17. 8. ^ I f^ÍM II Trans : - Indra, strong in his neck, fat-bellied and stout-armed, intoxicated with juice, smites down the vrtras (demons). These passages speak of various limbs of the material body of the Deity, Indra. Again, RV X. 116. 7. [ ^ tiž qícť ļprra i fíí 3 ] Il Trans: - Accept the oblation presented to thee, O Sovran Ruler, free from anger. The juice is pressed for thee O Bountiful One, and (the oblation) cooked. Eat it Indra and drink of that which is made ready. RV I. 95.10c fWT I o Trans : - He puts into his maw all kinds of food. RV VIII. 77. 4. mfà í^T&lt;W I II Trans : - By a single effort, Indra desirous of soma , drank thirty vessels (filled with soma). These passages indicate that a Deity eats and drinks as human beings do. Further, RV X. 89. 10. ^ I sfïïT ^ II Trans: - Indra lords over Heaven and Earth, Indra lords over water and also mountains. Indra the Master of the prosperous and the wise ; Indra must be invoked while resting and exerting. RV VII. 32. 22cd WÍř{: il Trans : - We praise thee, O Indra, Lord of this moving world, looker on heavenly light and Lord of what does not move. These passages indicate that the Deity lords over land and wealth. This is impossible without corporeal body.</page><page sequence="3">CONTRIBUTION OF THE S'ABARA-BHASYA 317 Similarly, RV II. 26. 3, ?î %r « H «HT 1 » Trans : - He with his people, his clan, his family, and his sons, gains food for himself, and wealth with the heroes ; - ( he ) who with a true believing heart serves with oblation Brahmaņaspati, the Father of the Gods. This passage indicates that the Deity when pleased grants booty and splendour. This too speaks of the corporeal nature of the Deties. t Sabara dismisses the view as follows : The Pūrvapaksin is labouring throughout under wrong impression. The idea that the Deity is the prompter of every sacrificial performance is not correct. It is, as a matter of fact, the transcendental merit ( apūrva ) arising out of the sacrificial performances, that should be regarded as the principal factor in bringing about the desired fruit. It is the fruit that is desired by the man ; all his activities are with a view to achieve his own purpose and not that of the Deity. The Deity which is spoken of in connection with a sacrifice is only a subordinate factor 1 and presents itself only as a receptacle of the offerings. It is clear from this that it is the objective of the sacrifice i. e. apūrva ( for the time being ) that induces a man to go in the sacrificial per- formances. Coming to the form of the Deities, it must be remarked that the Pūrvapaksin bases all his ideas about the form of the Deities oil a superficial study of the texts. The Smrti passages and customs that speak of the bodied nature of the Deities have their origin in the misinterpretation of those Vedic passages. Careful study of those passages will clear off those notions. It is nowhere declared in terms clear and distinct, that the Deities are possessed of physical forms. The indicative texts, adduced by the Pūrvapaksin , do not prove beyond doubt his thesis. They present no difficulty of interpretation, even without assuming physical forms of the Deities. Thus, RV X. 47-1 does not mean that Indra has a right hand ; what it means is that 41 we have taken hold of what is Indra's right hand. " This does not necessarily imply that Indra has a hand ; it is simply a glorification of Indra's sovereignty . Even if it be granted 1 Vide J S VIII. i. 32-4, 7</page><page sequence="4">318 D. V. GARGE that Indra has a hand yet the grasping of it is not a perceptible fact and hence to that extent the statement must be taken ( even by the Pūrvapaksin) as a mere eulogistic description, in order to save it from absurdity. The verse, therefore, simply indicates the presence of the Deity Indra ; the sense of the eulogy being as follows : 14 The Deity, Indra is such an efficient instrument oř accomplishing the desired result that it accomplishes on being invoked, in the same manner as being endowed with intelligence, body limbs etc. " Indra is thus invoked and told, 44 We have taken hold of your right hand " - which only means, " We depend on you " ; and the purpose served by the mantra is only to remind us that we should proceed to perform the rite in honour of this particular Deity-Indrav Similarly, RV X. 18- Ie, ^ sfíífà ( " I invoke thee o c posssessed of eyes " ) does not indicate the presence of eyes of Indra but is a mere glorification of him. It should be noted here that eulogy is possible even by superimposing attributes that do not really exist. Vedic literature abounds in eulogies of this kind. For instance, in the verse RV X. 94 2. fà|ì *FÏ#î: II Trans : - These (soma-pressing stones) speak like hundreds and thousands ; they roar with their green-tinted mouths. The meri- torious stones due to their merits, ate up from the sacrificial obla- tion that was meant for eating, even before the Hotr-priest did. RV X. 75. 9a W ^ 33^ i Trans : - Sindhu yoked a comfortable horse-chariot. In the first verse the power of speech is attributed to stones ' and in the second the river Sindhu is spoken of as a sentient being yoking her own chariot to rush forth. The passages adduced by the Pūrvapaksin , therefore, do not prove the existence of any physical body of the Deities ; conse- quently the mention of various limbs of the Deities should be taken in a metaphorical sense. Sabara in another place2 records in all, three views regarding the conception of a Deity prevalent in his time ' 2 Under J S X. iv. 23.</page><page sequence="5">CONTRIBUTION OF THE S'ABARA-BHASYA 319 (i) A Deity is a being who is described in Itihāsa and Purāņa as living in heaven, for example Agni, Indra, etc. This view has been rejected as it excludes terrestrial Deities such as ' Sārdūla ' ( Tiger ) as well as those that preside over ( Divisions of ) Time, such as ' Māsa ' ( Month ) and ' Samvatsara ' ( Year ), which are spoken of in orthodox literature. (ii) The term ' Deity ' denotes just those to whom the name has been applied in Vedic texts ; e. g. Agni, Vãta, Sürya (VS 14. 20) This definition excludes the non-Vedic Deities and even some of the Vedic ones. (iii) A Deity, therefore, is that to whom either a hymn3 or an oblation is dedicated as prescribed in the scriptures, may it be sentient or non-sentient, corporeal or incorporeal. NOTES : - It is clear from the above controversy that the Mīmāmsakas do not regard the Deities as objects of worship nor believe that they -.exist anywhere except in the words of the Vedic texts. They are only eternal concepts, since they are described by the eternal, self-evident Vedas. It is interesting to note that while the Rgveda hymns are inspired by the living faith in the Deity which was an object of worship, the Mīmāmsaka wonders how the deity can be simultaneously present in different places where She is invoked.4 Pārthasārathi and Khandadeva, however, cannot bring themselves round this view propounded by older Mīmāmsakas. Pārthasārathi says5 that the Gods serve in the sacrifices even after assuming that they possess physical form. Khandadeva observes : ' My speech gets soiled by uttering the above view (about Gods) ; and hence I take recourse to the remembrance of Lord Hari. *6 This leads us to the question as to what may be the reason of making all these attempts to deny the existence of the bodies of the Gods ? There is a doctrine of the Mīmāmsakas that the letters of the mantras are unalterable. If a single syllable is omitted or trans- posed or if in the place of a particular word any synonym of it is used, the mantra will be defective and will not produce the desired effect. Hence it is necessary that a mantra should be correctly pronounced. The sacrificer and the priests are not required to see that the Gods are present at the time of the performance, but they s E. g. RV I. 94. * PrakaranapañcikU, 185 ( Chowkhambã ed ) * àastradîpika, 580 ( Nirnavasāear ed. ) 6 BKāttadīpika, 3*53 ( Mysore ed. )</page><page sequence="6">320 D. V. GARGE should only take care that they commit no mistake in uttering the mantras. They have nothing to do with the Gods as actual persons but they have only to deal with their names. Hence arises the belief that the Gods exist in names, and the Mīmāmsakas have arrived at the conclusion that the Gods are identical with their names. It will be noticed that the Vedic conception of God had no active place in the Mīmāmsā scheme and as a natural conse- quence it gradually faded away. In its zeal for the Veda, the Mīmamsā manages to preserve the Book only to miss the spirit including a living faith in God.7 The Deities being so materialised, the Mīmāmsaka freely allowed the tendency of deifying animals and such other objects in nature. An old version of the present discussion regarding the conce- ption of a Vedic Deity, is found in Jļirukta VII. 6-7 wherein Yäska gives in all four views, and Sabara concurs with the last and the established one viz. 4 though really unanthropomorphic, the Deities assume anthropomorphic appearance for receiving sacrificial gifts. ' Besides the two classes of Deities viz. Sūktabhak and Havirbhãk, Yaska gives two more : Rgbhāk ( to whom a verse or verses are addressed ) and Tļipatabhak ( who are incidentally mentioned ). Of the ten Rgveda verses cited by Sabara, five viz. RV III. 30-5 ; X. 1167 ; X-95-10 ; X-94-2 and X-75-9 are reproduced from Kirukta VII. 6-7. Group 3 : - Passages that are shown to be the sources of rules in non-Vedic works like Smrtis. JS I. iii. 1-2. Context and the contents of the Sutras A number of commands like the following, are laid down in various Smrii-works ( a ) 1 Drinking booths should be set up ' ( b ) 4 One should keep a tuft of hair on the head ' The question whether these commands are as much authorita- tive as Vedic texts themselves, in the matter of dharma , is discussed by Jaimini in I. iii. 1-2. Apparently it would seem that the rules and regulations laid down in Smrti-texts ( like the two quoted above ) cannot have the same authority as the 4 Sruti ' ( i. e. the Vedas ) has. The former 7 CHATTER.TEE and D ATTA, An Introduction to Indian Philosophy , 384.</page><page sequence="7">CONTRIBUTION OF THE S'ABARA-BHASY A 321 treatises are attributed to persons in flesh and blood and hence can be fallible, as against the latter which are eternal, impersonal and hence infallible. Consequently, all Smrti- rules should be disregarded on the ground of their being human deliberations with no autho- rity on matters religious. This view is refuted in the second Sūtra "The non- Veda texts ( like the smrtis ) are trustworthy, as there would be inference ( i. e. assumption of the basis in the Veda ) from the fact of the agent being the same. " The non-Vedic texts like smrtis , too, are authoritative because it is well known that the authors of these works were very scrupu- lous and staunch followers of the Veda. They would not have tolerated even the slightest deviation from what is stated in the sacred texts, much less they themselves would lay down any course of action, not authorised by those texts. The only thing that those smrii-writers did, was that they restated in their own words and in a well arranged manner, the same rules and dictates of the Veda. It is therefore, no unwarranted assumption to hold that every statement of theirs, has some basis in the Veda i. e. the 1 revealed texts. ' Coming to the smrti-passages cited above, it can be said that 4 setting up a drinking booth ' is a philanthropic action referred to in the Rgveda verse X.4-lcd . : spifêpî *NT arm [ sri* i ] Trans : - You are like a fountain in the desert, O Agni, to a man who worships you, O Ancient King. Again, the custom of 1 keeping a tuft of hair ' which serves the purpose of indicating the gotra of a person, is alluded to in the Rg- veda verse VI. 75-17. ^ ïïMî: f *TTCT I [ črsrt ÏÏT ll ] Trans. Where the ( flights of) arrows fall like boys with their locks dishevelled, there may Brahmaņaspati and Aditi grant us protection for all days. These examples sufficiently illustrate the fact that every rule laid down in orthodox smrtis has for its basis some or the other Veda-texts ( may it be extant or otherwise ). It is in this way, that the trustworthy character of smrti- treatises is established by the Mīmāmsakas.</page><page sequence="8">322 D. V. GARGE NOTES: - The above discussion, it will be seen, iâ importanti as it explains the Vedic basis of Hindu customs, secular law, duties of castes and states in life etc. etc.. From the most ancient times the Vedas have been looked upon as a source of dharma.8 -However, they do not lay down positive precepts on those various topics, they contain only incidental references to these matters. Such references which are found scattered in the entire Vedic literature9 are all relegated to the arthavāda section by the Pūrva.Mīmāmsā System. Yet these arthavādas form a syntactical unity with the positive injunctions ( vidhis ) in the Veda10 and hence are equally authoritative. They indicate with sufficient clearness the state of things in that ancient society and it is no wonder that the authors of the orthodrx smrtis who had sufficient knowledge of that state, laid down their precepts in strict conformity with the Veda-indica- tions. It is due to this basis of the smrtis that they are held in such a high esteem by Jaimini who is very critical in examining the vali- dity of human statements. Group 4 : - Passages cited to illustrate the Mitnāmsa stand-point with regard to Vedic ritual . (A) The subject matter of the Pūrva-Mīmāmsā System is dharma ( i. e. duty ) ; and the Veda is the only means of obtaining valid information on that subject. In order to establish the validity of the Vedic texts, the eternality of 1 word ' and what is denoted by it, has to be proved. Jaimini, therefore, discusses the pros and cons of the problem in greater detail and finally asserts that his view is authorized by the Veda itself. Sabara quotes the relevant text which reads as follows : RV VIII. 75. 6ê [ ČR* I [ ?wť Ķļfii I! ] Trans : - Now, O Virūpa, rouse for him, the mighty God, who is ( kindled ) at dawn, a fair praise with speech that is eternal. 11 Regarding the general nature of dharma prescribed by these eternal 1 revealed text, ' Sabara remarks that sacrificial performance is its essential feature, as is declared in the Veda itself. 8 Vide Gautama-Dharma-Sütra, 1-1-2; and Apastamba-Ďharma-SU tra I-I«! *2. 9 Vide RV 1-124-7 ; II.17-7 ; IV-5-5.

Consequently, works on Mīmāmsā are found to be replete with Vedic texts discussed or referred to, in order to determine the most correct sacrificial procedure. (B) The Vedais defined as 'the collection of mantras and brahmanas . 12 Of mantras no scientific definition is possible ; hence more logical writers on Mīmāmsā have contended themselves with explaining mantra as a name including all those passages to which the learned apply that name. Jaimini defines mantra as 4 the texts that are expressive of mere assertion of things that are connected with prescribed acts ; * the rest of the Veda is known as brãhmana . This definition is only illustrative as there are certain texts which are not expressive of any assertion and are yet called 4 mantra ' e. g. VS 24-20. Mantras are classed under three heads- 13 (1) a Rk (2) a Saman and (3) a Yajus . A Rk is defined in JS II. i. 35. as a mantra divided into *feet' that is, into certain well-defined parts, on the basis of meaning. As an instance, Sabara quotes RV I. i, 1. mmiê [ q^rî qfrcq ' I II ] Trans : - I praise Agni, the Priest-God, the Rtvij of the sacrifice, the Hotr-( -priest ) , the best treasure of wealth. The phrase 4 on the basis of meaning ' in JS II. i. 35, should not be taken in its strict literal sense ; that is to say, the name mantra does not cease to apply to those Rks in which the metrical foot does not make a complete sense ; for example, RV I. i. 2. 3TÍR: - [ fī§sfī I tf ^fif H ] Trans : - Agni, by ancient seers and by new, is worthy to be praised. He shall bring hitherward the Gods. The name 'Saman' is applied to the music to which certain mantras ait set14. The term Yajus is applied to all those mantras that are neither arranged in metrical feet, nor set to music15. 12 Apastamba-Paribhasa- Sutra , I. i. 33. 13 TB. 1-2-1-26. 14 J S II. i. 36 and VII. i, 1-21. ** J S II. i. 37.</page><page sequence="10">324 D, V. GARGE Besides this main threefold classification of mantras , there is also another classification based upon the difference in character of signification, of accentuation and so forth. Saiikarabhatta in his Mimãmsabalapràkãsa describes and exemplifies in detail all the 323 kinds into which mantras are divided. The Vrttikãra in his Vrtti mentioned in the Sabara-Bhasya, has exemplified fourteen kinds : (1) Mantras ending in %asi' (2) those ending in Ļtva% (3) expressive of eulogy, e. g. RV VIII. 44. 16, (4) questioning ( e. g. RV I. 164. 34 ), (5) description ( e. g. RV. I. 164. 35 ) etc. etc. This classifi« cation is by no means exhaustive, e. g. the mantra RV I. 24. 11" has the word 'tva in the middle instead of in the end as said above. As regards the brahmana portion, the Vrttikãra, quoted by Sabara, exemplifies twelve divisions based on some characteristic marks : (1) Frequent use of the word Hti' (2) containing the expression 'so he says', (3) narrative, (4) ratiocinative, (5) expres- sive of derivation, (6) deprecatory, (7) eulogistic, (8) indicative of doubt, (9) injunctive, (10) descriptive of other's action, (11) descriptive of ancient custom, and (12) indicative of emphasis. This classification of brahmana passages is not scientific ; it is only illustrative. The above-mentioned characteristics are shared by mantras also. Sabara points out ten such cases : RV X. 119. Ia ; VII. 41. 2d ; I. 116. 3V6 1. 2. 4C ; X. 117. 6a ; VIII. 44. 16d ; X. 129. 5b; X. 117. 5a ; VIII. 21. 18d ; and X. 90. 16a are exceptions to characteristics Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 respec- tively. (C) J S II. i. 30. It has been proved in JS II. i. 1-3 that in Vedic sentences the verb enjoins an act in view of some reward for the agent. This naturally leads to the question whether every Vedic verb, may it be in the mantra section or in the brahmana section, has got the same injunctive force. Jaimini here declares that a verb in a mantra , expresses merely an assertion ( * abhidhana ), not injunction ( 4 vidhana ' ), because it is only while the sacrifice is being performed that the mantra comes to be recited. A mantra, as the very name shows, is meant for chanting at the performance of some rite, thereby speaking of or describing the action to be done. The definite injunction of the rite, however, occurs in the corresponding portion of the brahmana text. 16 All printed editions of the Sabara Bhasya read Ļugroy instead of originai 1 tugro • in the Rgveda* It is not traced in any of the Vedic texts.</page><page sequence="11">CONTRIBUTION OF THE S'ABARA-BHASYA 325 Sabara, illustrates the conclusion, with a verse from the RV. RV 6. 28. 3. *T ČTT I ^ ^ÍTFPrmH' : nrfmt ^ u Trans.: - These (i.e. kine) are never destroyed, no robber can harm them; no foe ever injures them. Their master lives long with the cows with which he conducts his sacrifice and serves the Gods. The verbs 4 yajate ' and 1 dadatx express the acts of 'serving with a cow,' and 'giving a cow as a gifť, which are directly enjoined in TB 2. 8. 8. 11 and TB 1. 1. 6. 11 respectively17. The manrta , there- fore, when recited in connection with those rites simply reiterates what has been enjoined elsewhere. NOTES : - The whole hymn RV VI.28 is in praise of kine. TB 2. 8. 11-12 gives all the verses, including the present one, in a section which gives the lya]yas and 4 anuvakyas (the Offering -and Invita- tory verses ) for kamya pasus like a lVehať ( a cow that has mis- carried or is barren ). TB 2.8.8.11 quotes this verse only in a pratika while TB 2. 4. 6. 9 gives it in full, where pada 'b* reads differently. Kumārila in his T antravãrtika, points out that the rule declared by the Bhãsyakara regarding the injunctive force of verbs is not invariable or absolute ; for instance, verbs in the mantra VS 24.20 are found to be injunctive ; while those in the brahmaņa-ņassage TB 3. 7. 17 are mere assertions of what has been already enjoined elsewhere. According to Kumārila what the JS II. i. 32 states is that there are not only two functions of a Vedic verb as said in JS II. i. 6 viz. enjoining a primary acťand a subordinate act, but there is yet another function of a verb, that of simple assertion ( 4 abhidhana? ) which function takes place when the injunctive function is precluded by the presence of another injunctive word.

SB 4. 2. 1. 29 declares that the residue should be drunk by the priests. Here the question arises as to who should first drink from the residue.

NOTES : - The Mīmāmsakas claim to be the strictest adherents of the ancient Vedic culture which was pre-eminently a sacrificial cult. They were therefore, most scrupulous even in the most minor details of religious performance and did not tolerate even the slightest deviation from the directions of the Veda which is the only sacred source of information regard- ing dharma . In the absence of these directions, they sought for their guidance, some allusions if any, on that point embodied in the Veda itself. It was only when neither of them could be found, that they allowed human reasoning ( laukika nyãya ) to creep in. This explains why the Sutra 1 7 which refers to Veda indica- tions occurs every now and then in Jaimini's work.19. Conclusion The following facts may be pointed out in connection with Sahara's method of dealing with Rgveda verses : (1) Sabara highly speaks of the immense help20 rendered by the Science of Etymology and Grammar in interpreting Rgveda verses. 19 Vide supra Group III for the Vedic basis of customs and practices. 2 0 Vide under J S I, ii. 41 and I. iii. 10,</page><page sequence="13">CONTRIBUTION OF THE S'ABARA-BHASYA 327 (2) Sabara seems to have been very much influenced by the canons of Etymology laid down by Yaska in his Jiirukta .21 Moreover he reproduces a number of etymological explanations of words22 given by Yäska. t (3) Sabara is inclined to interpret Rgveda verses as well as words, in a sense suited to the ritualistic purposes. He looks upon the Rgvedic Gods as mere recepients of oblations and not as repre- senting some physical phenomena as Yäska holds. (4) Besides their use at the sacrificial procedure, Sabara (and all Mimämsakas for the matter of that ) looks upon Rgveda verses as containing the most authoritative record of customs and laws, religious as well as secular.
