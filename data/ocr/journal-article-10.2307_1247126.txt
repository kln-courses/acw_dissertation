Chemical Week, July 6, 1957, pp. 64, 66, 68. [w.c.] Operation researchers at Arthur D. Little, Inc., have come up with the following differential equa- tion formula to measure advertising response: ds fA (M-S) _ LS dt M Where S is sales volume, A, the rate of advertis- ing expenditure, M, the saturation level or maxi- mum attainable sales in a given campaign, L, the rates of sales decline, and r, a constant measuring the sales attributable to advertising. Studies from which this formula was derived lead to the following conclusions: (1) the first dollars spent in an advertising campaign are the most ef- fective in producing sales, (2) promotion is much more effective in attracting new customers than in retaining old customers, (3) individual campaigns have a "saturation level" beyond which additional promotion of the same type fails to generate extra sales, (4) campaign pretesting is feasible and relia- ble. 1.3 An Operations-Research Study of Sales Response to Advertising. M. L. Vidale and H. B. Wolfe, Operations Research, June, 1957, pp. 370-381. [W.L.] This article reports the results of experimental studies of the interaction of sales to advertising in the advertising campaigns of major industrial con- cerns. The response of individual products to an advertising promotion is characterized by three parameters: the sales decay constant, the .saturation level, and the response constant. Sales histories ex- emplifying each of these parameters are presented. A mathematical model of sales response, which has proved useful in analyzing advertising campaigns is developed. A further model for determining the total advertising appropriation and the allocation of the advertising budget among products is pre- sented. 1.4 The Advertising Budget: National and Local. A. M. Millholland, Journal of Retailing, Sum- mer. 1957, pp. 99-100. [s.c.H.] Criticism of co-operative advertising plans by a large advertiser, centering around belief that na- tional brand advertising has far stronger impact, that insistence upon co-operative arrangements forces retailers to accept inferior lines, and that in many cases the co-op plan is simply a poorly dis- guised rebate. 3. BIBLIOGRAPHIES 3.1 Patents, Trademarks, and Copyrights. Business and Technological Services Bulletin, January- June, 1957, Cleveland Public Library. [K.A.G.] This is a classified bibliography on the national and international aspects of this subject. Covers periodicals and services and gives brief statements of content. 4. BUYING AND PURCHASING 4.1 Trading Stamps and the Consumer's Food Bill. (MRR-i69) Market Organization and Costs Branch of AMS, U. S. Department of Agri- culture, May, 1957. [J.K.S.] Consumers appear to have accepted trading stamps as a form of promotion according to recent studies reported in this publication. As pointed out, in 1956, about half of the families in the U. S. were saving one or more of the different kinds of stamps being distributed by retail merchants. Some consumers showed great enthusiasm for saving stamps even though they thought this practice in- creased the prices they paid for food. Evidence of increases in the price of food due to the use of trading stamps has been hard to obtain. To explore the problem from the consumer's point of view, a small study was made in 1956 in Washington, D. C., to illustrate returns a consumer might expect for saving stamps. About twenty-five items of merchandise similar to those offered in a stamp company's catalog were priced as several local department stores and discount houses. This study showed that if consumers had obtained these items in exchange for filled stamp books, they would have received an equivalent of from $3.46 to $5.22 per book of 1,500 stamps, or a return of from 2.3 to 3.4 percent on an expenditure of $150 when manufacturers' list prices were used as the basis for comparisons. At discount store prices, returns would have been considerably less-ranging from 1.5 to 2.3 percent. This indicates that if food prices are raised to cover the entire cost of a trading stamp plan which is estimated to be about 212 percent of gross sales, a consumer who usually pays list prices would, in exchange for books of stamps, be getting such items on a prepayment plan. If these could be purchased at discount store prices, a loss to the consumer would result. 8. FINANCING 8.1 Credit Control in Selected Retail Farm Supply Co-ops. (FCS-General Report 35), John M. Bailey, U. S. Department of Agriculture, June, 1957. [J.K.S.] New and improved methods of credit control are being sought today by many businesses. Farmer co- operatives are among these. A preliminary study of MARKETING RESEARCH 317</page><page sequence="3">3UAa eight selected retail farm supply associations faced with this problem has just been concluded. The results may be of interest to other firms having credit accounts. Credit sales and accounts receivable increased ap- preciably over a 5-year period in these eight asso- ciations. Adverse economic conditions, changes in production technology, and inadequate administra- tion of credit operations were factors in the un- favorable trend. These associations were better than average in their credit operations. While total sales and credit sales were up 12 and 13 per cent respectively from 1952-1956, ac- counts receivable over the same period were up more than 6o per cent. While up to 90 per cent of patrons used credit some time during the year, only about 19 per cent of the patrons had accounts outstanding at the end of the last fiscal year. The ten largest accounts in each association rep- resented about 1.9 per cent of the patrons but ac- counted for 27 per cent of total accounts receivable. Detailed cost estimates by seven associations in- dicated a credit cost of $1.70 for $100 of credit sales. The report describes their policies and practices and makes suggestions for improved credit control. 8.2 Diverse Accounting Procedures, Price-Level Changes, and Financial Statement Ratios. Alan Robert Cerf, The Journal of Business, July, 1957, pp. 180-19,2. [s.c.H.] Financial statement ratios have important mar- keting implications, especially in connection with mercantile credit decisions. This paper seeks to ex- plore the effects of FIFO and LIFO inventory evaluation techniques upon some of the common ratios. The alternative valuation techniques give simi- lar results during periods of price stability. More- over, analysis of a number of "representative mod- els" indicates small differences equalized by tax effects for the current and "acid test" ratios. Work- ing capital, turnover, and reported inventory, profit and tax liability figures are likely to be affected much more seriously and may prove very poor guides to judgment. 9. FOREIGN MARKETING (including Marketing by Domestic Firms in Foreign Countries, and In- ternational Trade) 9.1 30 Guideposts to Overseas Marketing. Elmo C. Wilson and Alexander 0. Stanley, Dun's Re- view and Modern Industry, July, 1957, pp. 63-69. [R.L.C.] As export sales and overseas plant investment break through to new high levels, management is turning to marketing research to increase its mar- ket penetration. To make best use of the compara- tively new technique of international market re- search requires an understanding of its limitations and a readiness to improvise solutions by methods that might seem disturbingly unconventional to domestic researchers. The 30 points which are outlined by the authors offer a fundamental approach to the problem of mapping out the safe or stormy areas of markets abroad. By eliminating much of the guesswork this approach can be helpful in introducing new prod- ucts in a new overseas market or pretesting a new product in an established world market. 9.2 In British Expansion-A Shrinking Market for U. S. Chemicals. Chemical Week, June 29, 1957, pp. 80, 82, 84. [w.c.] For most segments of the British chemical indus- try, 1956 was a peak year, and 1957 is expected to be better. As a result exports of chemicals from the United States to Britain are generally declining. The British, however, are also worried about their export market. There appears to be almost general agreement that it would be a serious blow to British Chemical exports if the United Kingdom remains outside a European free-trade area. Chemical output in Britain in 1956 was about 5 per cent higher than 1955. But total value of im- ports of chemicals and allied products dropped from ?112 million in 1955 to ?107 million in 1956, a drop of 41/2 per cent. The U. S. is the leading supplier but the U. S. share dropped about 15 per cent from ?26 million in 1955 to ?22 million in 1956. Leading products shipped from the U. S. to Britain are potassium chloride, channel-type car- bon black, and styrene monomer. 9.3 British Retail Institutions. Minnie B. Tracey, Journal of Retailing, Summer, 1957, pp. 93- 98. [S.C.H.] A description of several important British de- partment stores and retail chains. One of the in- teresting thoughts that seem to emerge from the descriptions is that there is no "natural" or "in- herent" bundle of goods and services which uni- versally comprises the sole and proper area of de- partment store activity. British department stores seem to handle food lines much more successfully than their American counterparts. Insurance and real estate departments are also common. Attention is also paid in this article to relatively narrower margins, the relatively minor role of advertising, and to the resale price maintenance controversy. 9.4 How Europe Will Meet Sulfur Demands. Chem- ical Industry Economics Group, Stanford Re- search Institute, Chemical &amp; Engineering News, July 29, 1957, pp. 40-42. [w.c.] Europe will up sulphur consumption some three 318 THE JOURNAL OF MARKETING January 1958</page><page sequence="4">MARKETING RESEARCH ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Ip10 million tons by 1965 over 1955.

M. M. Zimmer- man, Super Market Merchandising, July, 1957, pp. 87-88 ff. [W.L.] M. M. Zimmerman, President of Super Market Merchandising, delivered a series of lectures on super markets and self-service to the Modern Mer- chandising Methods Convention of Sydney, Aus- tralia. In this article Mr. Zimmerman writes about his visit and the progress of self-service retailing in Australia. Australians are eager to learn about super mar- kets and self-service techniques of retailing. The most aggressive Australian food retailers are op- erators of department and variety stores. There are about 1,700 self-service stores in Australia, with new stores opening at the rate of 30-40 per month. The largest self-service food store is 4,000-5,000 square feet and 20 per cent of all food stores com- mand 60 per cent of the business. Two-thirds of this 20 per cent are independent operators, and about one-third of these independents have self- .service stores. Governmental and labor union regulation and control is restricting the development of retailing in Australia. Store hours, prices, and advertis- ing (premiums, coupons, prizes) are "controlled" thereby hindering competition. A few retailers, however, have started keeping open evenings and reducing prices. Two department stores completed building mod- ern shopping centers in May and June. Since Aus- tralians in big cities live essentially like Ameri- cans, it is expected that more shopping centers will appear. The author concludes that Australia will realize an expansion in super market and self- service retailing and will offer American manufac- turers an outlet for their branded merchandise. Australia lacks three essentials: (i) more popula- tion, (2) more capital, and (3) increased productivity. 9.6 Worldwide Squeeze on U. S. Chemicals? Chemi- cal Week, July 27, 1957, pp. 20, 21. [w.c.] The European common market is but the first and most apparent of similar schemes for common markets shaping up throughout the world. U. S. chemical processors sold these amounts of products in 1956 in areas where common protected markets may come into existence: Million Dollars Europe ....................... 347 South America ................. 326 Central America ................ 272 Far East ...................... 243 Total . ...................... 1,188 U. S. producers are not too concerned because prospects for common markets are far off. However, they are increasing production in their own foreign plants. A recent estimate is that 76 per cent of U. S. goods sold abroad are manufactured there. Com- mon market areas should improve their regional economies and result in enlarged markets for prod- ucts. 11. GOVERNMENT REGULATION 11.1 Letters Patent for Inventions: Their Use and Misuse. G. A. Bloxam, The Journal of Indus- trial Economics, July, 1957, pp. 157-179. [S.C.H.] Particularly interesting in this thorough general description of the British patent system is the dis- cussion of the possible use of patents to suppress useful inventions-something common belief holds to be a frequent practice. Although British law for more than fifty years has provided for compulsory licensing in cases of "abuse of monopoly," includ- ing suppression, extremely few actions have been brought before the Controller-General of Patents. An investigative committee which sat just after World War II was unable to locate any evidence of suppression. In general Bloxam concludes that through different means, both British and Ameri- can law provide adequate safeguards against patent abuse. 11.2 New Weapon Joins Antitrust Arsenal. Chemi- cal Week, July 6, 1957, pp. 21-23. [w.c.] The U. S. Senate Antitrust and Monopoly Sub- committee has had its staff prepare a report on con- centration in industry which gives 1954 data as compared with previous years. In 1954, the fifty largest manufacturing compa- nies accounted for 23 per cent of value added by manufacture, as compared to 17 per cent in 1947. In 1954 the per cent of shipments in dollar value by the eight largest companies in certain chemical industry sectors was: MARKETING RESEARCH 41Q</page><page sequence="5">320 THE JOURNAL OF MARKETING January 1958 Value, Total Per Cent Shipped Shipments by Eight Largest Commodity Million Dollars Firms Chlorine................................................ 87 82 Synthetic Ammonia and Derivatives ........................ 297 83 Aluminum Compounds .................................... 235 96 Cyclic D yes . ........................................... 156 80 Plastics ................................................. 1,463 61 Synthetic Rubber ........................................ 392 79 Synthetic Fibers ......................................... 1,202 95 Industrial Natural-Ethyl Alcohol ........................... 27 99 Soap . ................................................ . 481 73 Paints and Varnishes ...................................... 1,458 37 F ertilizers ............................................... 855 45 Carbon Black . .......................................... 103 97 14. MANAGERIAL CONTROL (including Ac- counting Control, Inventory Control, Statistical Control) 14.1 High-Speed Operations Research. Melvin E. Salveson, Harvard Business Review, July-Au- gust, 1957, pp. 89-99. [J.M.R.] The author visualizes a business as made up of a number of closely inter-related and interconnected activities which are carried out in pursuit of a common purpose, measured in terms of profits, customer preference, return on investment, employ- ment stability, or in other ways. Thus, the enter- prise may be considered a large, complex system, made up of a number of sub-systems. Mr. Salveson identifies these sub-systems as the management processes of operations (sales, for example), plan- ning (sales forecasting, for example), and control (sales analysis, for example), not the functions of management (marketing, production, accounting, etc.). With regard to current operating decisions, OR has little, if any, role, whereas high-speed com- puters have had their widest application in this area. In planning, OR analyses and formulation followed by computer solution are most useful; for example: economic analyses and forecasting; budgeting; location selection; personnel selection and recruitment; plant layout; inventory planning. Likewise, OR and computers can assist significantly in control; for example: cost accounting; quality control; sales analyses and reporting. Summing-up, the author details the major con- tributions of OR and the electronic computer to management: a. Top management can use OR to help in the continuing process of redesigning or adapting the business to its ever-changing environment-includ- ing the changes induced by the electronic com- puter. b. OR is useful in designing the structure and flow of information in planning, operations, and control-so that all planning, decision, and action in the enterprise are consistent, complete, and valid. c. Managers can use the electronic computer to aid them in making better decisions in planning, operations, and control-by increasing the speed and power of computation available to them. 16A. MARKETING OF SPECIFIC GOODS AND SERVICES: AGRICULTURAL GOODS AND RAW MATERIALS 16A.1 Possibilities for Futures Trading in Florida Citrus Fruit and Products. (Marketing Re- search Division Report No. i56) William T. Wesson, U. S. Department of Agriculture. [J.K.S.] This study was concerned with the feasibility of organized futures trading in frozen orange concen- trate and oranges. It was undertaken because of the strong interest on the part of the Florida citrus in- dustry in the possibility that futures trading would be helpful in (i) providing an aid to short-term financing, and (2) reducing the magnitude of price movements. The author concludes that the possi- bilities for the development of futures trading in these products are unfavorable at present. This conclusion is based on the following characteristics of the products and the markets for these products. To a substantial degree, the various phases of production and marketing of frozen orange con- centrate and oranges are vertically integrated; that is, two or more phases of production or marketing are controlled by the same firm. Consequently, the numbers of buyers and sellers tend to be low, and the volume of trading in these commodities that take place under open or free market conditions is relatively small. Orange concentrate is, for the most part, pro- duced and marketed under brand names and con- siderable significance is assigned the brand name in the buying and selling of the product at all levels of trade. Because of the importance of brands in this respect, it appears impossible, under present conditions, to establish a futures contract that is in line with trade interests.</page><page sequence="6">MARKETING RESEARCH 321 Market information on orange concentrate and oranges is not very widely distributed. The limited distribution reflects the absence of a demand for such information by individuals outside the citrus industry who might be interested in futures trad- ing. This is a condition that is to be expected, since it is difficult for these individuals to make use of such information in an integrated industry. There is a high degree of concentration of con- trol in the citrus market. The nature of futures trading is such that its use as an aid to financing would necessitate a greater division and redistribution of the owner- ship responsibility in the manufacturing and mar- keting of orange concentrate and oranges. The de- velopment of the citrus market has been in the direction of increased concentration of ownership at the manufacturing, storage, and distribution levels, including retailing in a few instances. Among other effects, this consolidation of owner- ship enables price risks to be spread over a large number of items, none of which may follow the same price pattern. This development has increased capital requirements of the firms operating in this industry. In the case of financing through futures trading, part of the gains or losses that otherwise would be received by the integrated firm go to participants in the futures market. Thus, the ad- vantages expected from integration of .successive phases of the production and marketing process are best achieved through financing by some other means, such as the sale of securities. Futures trad- ing moderates the effect of integration, since par- ticipants in the futures markets become claimants to the yield realized from certain phases of the process. 16A.2 Costs of Packing Colorado Peaches in 1956. Marketing Research Report No. 179, Lloyd C. Martin, Agriculture Marketing Service, U. S. Department of Agriculture, June, 1957. [J.K.S.] Total costs of packing a bushel of peaches in Colorado averaged almost 99 cents in 1956. Ranch sheds that packed peaches in the standard fruit box had total packing costs of over 56 cents, while these costs in the larger central packing sheds averaged slightly over 44 cents. In Mesa County, Colorado, approximately one- third of the peaches packed for fresh market are packed in the seven central sheds, four of which are owned by two cooperatives, the remainder by two independent packers and shippers. The re- mainder of the crop is packed in smaller ranch sheds. However, the entire crop is sold through and physically handled by the central sheds which maintain extensive selling organizations and ship- ping facilities during the peach marketing season. The costs considered in this report were those for labor, overhead, and materials. Labor costs in- cluded those from receiving the bulk fruit into the shed, through the packing process, to loading out for shipment to market. Labor costs comprised approximately 27 per cent of total packing costs regardless of the type of pack produced, while overhead costs accounted for 17 per cent of the total. The cost of packing materials was the largest cost category, averaging slightly over 56 per cent of total packing costs. Components of total costs to pack a box of peaches in the central sheds consisted of over 12 cents for labor, 6 cents for overhead, and almost 26 cents for packing materials. Costs in ranch sheds that packed the standard fruit box averaged slightly over 15 cents for labor, almost io cents for overhead, and 31 cents for materials. Packing costs in packing peaches in bushel baskets for fresh mar- ket consisted of 24 cents for labor, 18 cents for overhead, and 56 cents for materials. Although the bushel basket contains over 2/2 times as much fruit as the box, costs were not proportionately higher because peaches packed in boxes were indi- vidually wrapped while peaches packed in bushel baskets were not. Differences in packing methods are apparent when packing costs are converted to a per-ioo- pounds basis. Total costs to pack ioo pounds of peaches in bushel baskets averaged $2.o6. To pack a similar quantity of peaches in boxes cost $2.48 in the central sheds and $3.13 in the ranch sheds. Data presented in this report indicate that in- creased efficiency and lower costs could be obtained by some consolidation of packing operations. Copies of the complete report are available at 25 cents a copy from the Superintendent of Docu- ments, U. S. Government Printing Office, Wash- ington 25, D. C. 16A.3 Coordinated Marketing-Would It Help Co- operative Fruit and Vegetable Processors? (FCS-General Report 33), Irwin W. Rust, U. S. Department of Agriculture, June, 1957. [J.K.S.] What kind of a coordinated marketing program would the majority of fruit and vegetable proces- sors prefer, and to what extent would they support such a program? To get the answers to these question's, Farmer Cooperative Service sought information from all known cooperative fruit and vegetable processors in the United States and from several rice and dried pea and bean associations. It asked these processors about their current sales practices, their problems, and their ideas for an effective marketing agency. Processors reported they were having difficulty meeting the large-scale requirements of chain stores and other quantity buyers. They had other serious problems related to market coverage, brand competition and acceptance, rising costs, and changes in consumers' preferences and demands. This study showed fifty-three co-operative proc- MARKETING RESEARCH 321</page><page sequence="7">322 THE JOURNAL OF MARKTIN Tna-----rv 158 essors in nineteen States were definitely interested in marketing their products through a joint sales agency. All customarily sold through brokers, al- though a number sold direct to customers when- ever feasible. Development of a coordinated sales program probably would foster greater emphasis on direct sales, in keeping with current trends in that direction. Initially, processors would make about 50 per cent of their volume (approximately nineteen mil- lion cases of canned, bottled, frozen and packaged foods) available for sale through a central agency. Several processors indicated willingness to use the agency exclusively from the start. Several others said they would increase their amounts as the pro- gram progressed. All cooperatives interested in a joint marketing program said they would be willing to accept uni- form quality requirements. 'Processors showed less unanimity on the question of brands. Forty-six per cent favored an exclusive central agency brand; 32 per cent would want to use both central agency and individual association brands. A number of processors reported they did no advertising. Expenses of those who did advertise ranged from 3.5 to 10 per cent of sales. If a coordi- nated sales agency wished to establish a nationally recognized and accepted brand, it would undoubt- edly need to advertise. 16A.4 Finishing 1957's Food-Chemicals Fracas. Chemical Week, August 17, 1957, pp. 21, 22, 23. [w.c.] Congress last week completed its 1957 study of proposed new controls of chemical food additives. In the course of the hearings it became plain that far more stringent broad-range legislation will be enacted with a powerful effect on an over $16o mil- lion a year chemical food additive business, broken down in 1956 as follows: Million Dollars Phosphate and Acidulants ....... 40 Colors ........................ 5 Nutritional Supplements ......... 12 Sweeteners.................... 2 Thickeners and Emulsifiers ....... 38 Flavoring Agents ............... 41 Spoilage Protectants ............ 11 O thers ........................ 13 Total . ...................... 162 16B.1 Building Codes Stymie More Plastics Use. Chemical Week, August 17, 1957. pp 95, 96, 98, 100oo. [w.c.] U. S. plastic marketers aren't too exuberant about the 1957 expected record consumption of about 540 million pounds of plastics by the con- struction industry, because it represents a disap- pointing increase of less than six per cent over 1956. Part of the cause of the small gain is the result of a general slack in the building business. Other reasons holding back plastics use are: (i) many still consider plastics only "substitutes" for orthodox materials; (2) obsolete building codes; (3) unaware- ness of engineers and designers of properties and uses of plastics; (4) poor communication of pro- ducers with users. The potential building market for plastics by 1966 may be $2 billion-in 1957, roughly that much worth of plastics was sold for all purposes. Whether this goal is achieved depends on overcoming pres- ent difficulties.

Chemical &amp; Engineering News, July 23, 1957, pp. 86, 87. [w.c.] Perfume and flavoring materials used in every- thing from luxurious cosmetics to dog food reached a new production high of 44 million pounds in 1956, four per cent over 1955. But unit value declined from $1.47 to $1.36 per pound from 1955 to 1956. The largest item is 18 million pounds in 1956 of the flavor enhancer monosodium glutamate, twice the 1950 output. One company produces about 75 per cent of U. S. consumption from beet sugar processing byproducts. Second largest item is 31/2 million pounds in 1946 of methyl salicylate or synthetic wintergreen oil, 13 per cent over 1955. This low cost flavor is used in mint candies, root beer, pharmaceuticals, to a lesser extent as an odorant for space sprays, linaments, etc. 16B.4 Second Half Should Beat the First. Chemical &amp; Engineering News, July 22, 1957, pp. 12-14. [w.c.] Chemical marketers in the second semiannual survey of expectations conducted by the American Synthetic detergents will continue their sales growth, but less rapidly than in the past. Butyl rubber, despite a drop in production every year since 1953, is expected to increase over ten per cent in the second half of 1957 as compared to the sec- ond half of 1956. Polyethylene production in 1957 is expected to go up very substantially. Sulfa drugs are expected to go up substantially but 1957 pro- duction value is only expected to be a little over half the all time peak year of 1943. 16B.5 Chemico-electronics Scramble Gets Hotter. Chemical Week, July 27, 1957, pp. 34, 36, 38. [w.c.] New electronic industry developments spell out an anticipation of a near-fantastic growth in use of semi-conductor high purity materials for the manu- facture of transistors, rectifiers, and diodes. Transistor sales in the first five months of 1957 were 9 million units worth over $25 million as compared to 3.6 million units worth about $o10 million in the corresponding 1956 period. Still transistors represent only 5 per cent of vacuum tube sales whose function they often more advan- tageously perform. One important chemical material required for certain types of transistors is high-purity silicon. Use in 1957 will be about 20,000 pounds (at over $250 per pound). By 1962 demand may be oo100,000ooo pounds a year. With this rapid growth, many new producers are entering the field, and supply is expected to be more than sufficient to meet demand. 16C. MARKETING OF SPECIFIC GOODS AND SERVICES: MANUFACTURED CONSUM- ERS' GOODS 16C.1 Food Consumption of Households in the U. S., Northeast, North Central, South and West. Survey Reports 1-5, Marguerite G. Burke, U. S. Department of Agriculture, De- cember, 1956. [J.K.S.] In April-June 1955, a sample of about 6,ooo households in 42 states was used to obtain current</page><page sequence="9">324 THE JOURNAL OF MARKETING January 1958~~~~~~~.7 information on patterns of food consumption, ex- penditures, and dietary levels. The survey and basic tabulations, a joint project of the Agricultural Re- search Service and the Agricultural Marketing Serv- ice, were made by National Analysts, Inc., under contract. ARS provided leadership on technical de- velopment and liaison with the contractor. The series of reports with basic statistics from the survey are being issued jointly. (Single copies may be obtained from the Office of Information, U. S. Department of Agriculture.) The AMS staff is now directing its efforts toward description and analysis of marketing aspects of the data. The ARS staff is concentrating on dietary levels and house- hold food practices revealed by basic data and further tabulations for their research on house- hold economics. A current list of descriptive and analytical arti- cles and speeches based on the survey reports, as well as announcements of publication of the re- ports, is published in each issue of the National Food Situation. That quarterly periodical, which may be obtained from the Marketing Information Division of the Agricultural Marketing Service, U. S. Department of Agriculture, Washington 25, D. C., also carries series of articles describing food consumption in each region and each urbaniza- tion category, and for each commodity group. 16C.2 1955 Survey-Frozen Food Locker Plants. Utilization Research Report i, P. C. Wilkins, L. B. Mann, and B. D. Miner, Farmer Coop- erative Service, U. S. Department of Agricul- ture, May, 1957. [J.K.S.] Frozen food lockers have proved one of the major keys to better food storage and better eating in the past two decades, particularly in smaller rural communities. Locker plants are especially valuable in processing, storing, and merchandising local foods. Latest figures show that about one family out of every eight in the United States was getting some of its basic food needs through a frozen food locker plant. On January I, 1955, some 10,550 of these plants were serving about 5 million patrons. More than 3 million of these patrons rented lock- ers at these plants. Other plant patrons were nearly 2 million home freezer families who hired the locker plant to process and freeze the food for home storage. Indications are that future expansion in the frozen food locker industry will be in the field of processing and merchandising. While renting of lockers will continue as an important phase of the business, revenue from this service will probably decline in relative importance. All told, during 1954 locker plants processed about i.6 billion pounds of food-that is, they slaughtered livestock; they chilled, cut, ground, wrapped, froze, or cured meat; and they quick froze fruits and vegetables into consumer size packages for their patrons. They also dressed, eviscerated, wrapped and froze poultry. The large and rapidly expanding zero storage space in locker plants and in home freezers under the control of the consumer is changing buying and eating habits. Instead of purchasing in small quantities many housewives now buy perishable foods in wholesale quantities during periods of heavy marketings. The report provides a broad view of the frozen food locker industry. It describes the industry in terms of location, size, services, rates, patronage, and volume and draws comparisons with informa- tion secured in earlier surveys. 16C.3 Electronic Detection of Bloodspots in Eggs. J. A. Hamann, Agriculture Marketing Serv- ice, U. S. Department of Agriculture, pp. 8-9, June, 1957. [J.K.S.] Commercial tests of a USDA-developed electronic blood spot detector indicate that it is more accurate than human candling. Capable of scanning up to 7,200 eggs per hour, the detector makes use of a light source coupled with an electronic device that is sensitive to the color of blood. When the light encounters blood, a tripping device automatically diverts the egg. On a commercial grading line it increased grad- ing line production about half a case per hour within certain quality limits. USDA graders re- checked for blood spots behind the candlers and the electronic detector. More than 21,000 eggs that had moved through the detector were re- checked. Rejecting blood spot eggs at a rate of 2.2 per cent, the detector missed 0o.38 blood spots per thousand. When the licensed graders rechecked eggs coming through the line without the detector, they found the candlers had rejected blood spot eggs at the rate of 0.02 per cent, but had missed 3.9 blood spot eggs per thousand. This means the electronic detector decreased the error in blood spot detection by some 90 per cent, under test conditions involving high quality white eggs. 16C.4 Men's Ownership of Selected Clothing Items and Their Fiber Preferences. AMS-i8i, Mil- ton Jacobs and Daniel Levine, U. S. Depart- ment of Agriculture, April, 1957. [J.K.S.] Preliminary results from this national study based on 2,379 personal interviews with men 16 years of age and over indicate that cotton leads in men's summer wear. Considered a representative sample of all men in the country, this group said they owned more summer sport shirts, business dress shirts and summer slacks made of cotton than of any other fiber. The reason most men preferred cotton for their summer clothes was simply because "it's cool." Some mentioned that it was "light- weight or thin." A good many like the way cotton launders, pointing out that it "washes well" or is 324 THE JOURNAL OF MARKETING January 1958</page><page sequence="10">MARKETING RESEARCH 325 "easily laundered." Durability and wearing quali- ties as well as general appearance were also men- tioned. This summary presents selected findings of im- mediate interest and use to those concerned with men's apparel. Items included are sport shirts, business dress shirts, summer slacks or separate trousers, summer suits, summer sport coats, swim- ming trunks and walking or Bermuda shorts. In addition to these items of men's apparel, the full study includes sport coats or jackets worn during seasons other than summer, pajamas, bathrobes or lounging robes and socks. Information on all of the items will be included in the final report. Copies of this preliminary summary are avail- able upon request from the U. S. Department of Agriculture, Washington 25, D. C. 16C.5 Ready Mixes Sweeten Dry Flavor Sales. Chemical Week, August 3, 1957, pp. 78, 8o. [w.c.] Already prime contributors to the success of cake and pudding mixes, spray-dried flavors are key in- gredients of a new tableted carbonated drink con- centrate. Spray-dried flavors were introduced about ten years ago, and have over five per cent of the $60 million a year flavors and perfumes market. The principal use is in packaged cake mixed about 4 ounces dry flavor to loo pounds cake mix. These mixes sell at about 600o million packages a year as compared to 360 million in 1954, and 33 million in 1947. A twenty per cent increase in a few years is predicted. Powdered soft drinks are a $30 million a year consumer field using 12 ounces dry flavor to 100 pounds powder. The latest variety is carbonated. Getting the right formula to combine fizz and flavor is not easy. Other increasing uses of dry flavors are in phar- maceutical compounding, confectionary, gelatins, pudding, powders, powdered icings, etc. The future for these concentrated flavors looks good as long as the housewife continues to favor speedily prepared foods. 16C.6 Perspective on Consumer Durables. N.I.C.B. Business Record, July, 1957, pp. 322-324 ff. [J.M.R.] This interesting analysis attempts to account for the wide fluctuations in consumer durables (ex- cluding automobiles) production in the face of a stable level of consumer expenditure. The study considers and discards (with factual evidence) the following factors: rate of new home construction, extension of installment credit, price movement. Actually, the trouble seems to lie with rather abrupt turns in consumer demand for various con- sumer durables along with the fact that "no one knows when the consumer is about to initiate one of these shifts in preference." The result is a rapid pile-up of stocks through- out the pipeline. Unfortunately, the signals do not work back to production promptly. The net effect, then, is an accentuation at the production end of the pipeline of shifts at the consumption end. Con- current opposite movements of production and consumer sales indices are shown clearly in this analysis. 16C.7 Soap, Detergents, Paint, Varnishes; Market- ing Techniques in the United States, Project No. 299. (Washington, D. C.: Organization for European Economic Cooperation) April, 1957, 99 PP. [K.A.G.] This is a capsule review by the representatives of seven European counties of what it is that makes U. S. manufacturers successful. Their observations are not limited to the organizations named and should be of general interest to teachers and to those interested in selling in Europe. This volume also presents a useful quantitative synopsis of the structure of these industries in Europe with diagrams of "distribution circuits" in various countries. 18. PRICES AND PRICE POLICIES 18.1 Do Retail Prices Follow Wholesale Prices? W.I.C.B. Business Record, June, 1957, pp. 269-276. [J.M.R.] Over the long term, wholesale and retail prices move in roughly parallel paths. A comparison of BLS monthly indices of wholesale and retail prices over the past thirty years shows this to be true especially for the 1926-1949 period. For the more recent period, cyclical movements have shown slightly less similarity. However, short term changes in the two price indices diverged considerably. Conference Board analysts compared BLS figures for the preceding ninety-nine monthly periods with the following results: a. The wholesale price index advanced forty- eight times, dropped back forty-seven times, and remained unchanged four times. b. Retail prices increased sixty-four times, de- clined twenty-eight times, and remained unchanged seven times. c. Coinsiding movements occurred in fifty-one months and opposite movements in forty-eight. d. Assuming a time lag of three months between wholesale and retail price movements, only forty- four changes occurred in the same direction. Some of the reasons given for short run varia- tions are: a. The two indices do not measure identical things or cover identical groups of things. b. The wholesale index includes commodities only, whereas the retail index includes services such as rent, telephones, etc. MARKETING RESEARCH 325</page><page sequence="11">3A c. There are varying time periods which elapse before price changes are passed on from the raw material stage to the retail level. d. Differences in distribution costs will also pro- duce divergence. e. Individual commodities carry varying weights in the construction of the two indices. f. The competitive situation and changes in productivity may significantly affect the degree to which retail prices reflect wholesale prices. g. The existence of inventories, a desire to main- tain relative retail price stability, varying channels of distribution may also act upon extent to which cost changes are passed on. h. On the buyer's side, consumer tastes, income, and expectations help to determine whether whole- sale prices changes are reflected at retail. 18.2 Flour Pricing and the Miller's Margin. Joyce M. Bellamy, The Journal of Industrial Eco- nomics, July, 1957, pp. 202-219. [S.C.H.] This description of flour pricing in the United Kingdom is interesting as an example of pricing in a highly cartelized industry. The millers' associa- tions publish "recommended" prices, based (appar- ently) upon an honest effort to estimate forthcom- ing supplies and costs. The great bulk of British millers observe these prices in negotiating contracts with bakers and other outlets. However, over the past four years flour prices and millers' margins apparently have risen, due to overestimates of cost increases. Moreover millers' prices rose particularly when foreign competition was curtailed, due to transport difficulties and to agreements with a leading buyer. 18.3 Crude Oil Prices in the United States at the Gulf Coast. Wayne A. Leeman, The Journal of Industrial Economics, July, 1957, pp. 18o- 191. [S.C.H.] The long run stability of crude oil prices has led many economists to believe that these prices are administered or controlled prices. An examination of pricing on the Gulf Coast (the leading area) convinces the author that while oligopoly is pres- ent, and state control of production fosters price stability, other factors work to create a result closer to the competitive equilibrium than would be expected. One is the matter of rivalry between pro- ducing states, another is the ease of entry since any developer can demand a quota, and third is the availability of imports. 20. RESEARCH AND RESEARCH TECHNIQUES 20.1 Sampling in a Nutshell. Morris James Slonim, Journal of the American Statistical Associa- tion, June, 1957, pp. 143-161. [E.J.K.] This article was first published as a series of eight short installments in the United States Air Force Statistical Services Technical Letter. The objective of the series was to provide in brief compass a gen- eral survey of current sampling procedures. The series described the meaning of sampling, its poten- tialities, the principal types of sample design and their differences, the use of varied types of estimat- ing procedures to improve sample estimates, and precautions to be observed in sample selection and data gathering. The treatment of the subject is elementary, brief, and characterized by the light approach. The series has been well received by statistical neophytes and sophisticates. It has been printed in pamphlet form by the Air Force. Readers of the THE JOURNAL OF MARKETING may find the article helpful in ex- plaining the subject of sampling to others in their organizations or classes. Two other articles on sampling which were not aimed at statisticians in the field of sampling have appeared in the Journal of the American Statistical Association. These were the papers on "Principles of Sampling" by Cochran, Mosteller, and Turkey (March, 1954) and "The Applications of Sampling Procedures to Business Operations" by Howard L. Jones (September, 1955). The first article was intended for social scientists and the second di- rected primarily at telephone company personnel. These two articles, plus the Slonim article, can be of considerable use to statisticians and market researchers who have to explain sampling funda- mentals to others. 20.2 Limitations of the Scientific Method in Man- agement Science. Ernest H. Weinwurm, Man- agement Science, April, 1957, pp. 225-233. [W.L.] "It is the purpose of this paper to examine the problem of the universal applicability of the scien- tific method with a view of the peculiar conditions of management." Essentially the article is con- cerned with a few fundamental trends and characteristic examples in the development of man- agement science. The application of quantitative methods and mathematic models, the use of the concepts of probability and randomness, and the minimization or neglect of human factors in scientific decision making are discussed as problems of applying the scientific method to management. 20.3 Dim Promotion Prospects Gnaw at Morale. Chemical Week, June 29, 1957, pp. 48, 49, 50. [w.c.] Serious morale problems may be fermenting in many chemical company's market research depart- ments. The top problem of market analysts is ap- parently their limited opportunity for promotion according to a recent survey. Analysts earn 27 per- cent less than their managers (cf. Chemical Week, April 27, 1957, p. 68) but their average age of 3812 years is only one less than managers. Other com- parisons are: 326 THE JOURNAL OF MARKETING Tanuary 1958</page><page sequence="12">MARKET__ _ING REEAC 327_ ~ _ Analysts Managers Master's Degrees 48% 53% Doctor's Degrees 15% 11% MBA Degrees 20% 11% Chemical Industry Experience 14? yrs. 12 yrs.

Koopmans and Martin Beckman, Econometrica, January, 1957, pp. 53-76- [E.J.K.] The authors discuss two problems in the alloca- tion of indivisible resources. Both problems can be interpreted as problems of assigning plants to locations. Apparently the price system fails as a means of sustaining an optimal location assignment. The first problem, which ignores the cost of trans- portation between plants, is found to be a linear programming problem. Associated with this prob- lem is a system of rents that sustains an optimal assignment. But the recognition of cost of inter- plant transportation in the second problem intro- duces unresolved complications which make diffi- cult the establishment of meaningful relationships between location rents and transportation costs. A list of twenty references is included. 20.5 Bibliography on Linear Programming. F. Vir- ginia Roble, Operations Research, February, 1957, pp. 45-62. [W.L.] Presents a 266 item bibliography covering various aspects of linear programming. 20.6 Twelve Years of Unconscious Level Testing of Marketing Tools. Louis Cheskin, Advanced Management, May, 1957, pp. 9-14. [J.M.R.] One of the most significant developments in un- conscious level testing has been the creation of optical instruments that measure involuntary reac- tions to three aspects of a package: visibility from the shelf, readibility of the brand and product names, and eye movement. Another recent develop- ment is the use of accumulated data on color and imagery; it is no longer necessary to conduct ex- tensive tests since the evidence of twenty years of study and experiment is available. A third advance is the formulation of association-type tests that may be conducted on the unconscious level. Finally, there is the indirect preference test which is de- signed to disclose sensation transference from the package to the product. Mr. Cheskin believes that people reveal their preferences and attitudes in spontaneous expres- sions and in unconscious reactions. He believes that neither quantitative nor qualitative research are sufficiently reliable. He feels a combination of asso- ciation tests and indirect preference tests are the best for determining consumer reactions to a package. 20.7 Subscriber vs. Non-Subscriber Method for Studying Effects. James E. Brinton, Journal- ism Quarterly, Winter, 1957, pp. 92-93. [W.L.] In studying the effects of communications, material is often presented to one group and with- held from the other and the groups are measured before and after communication. Such experimental designs have numerous limitations. Recent work at Stanford University indicates that some of these limitations may be overcome and the essential qualities of the experimental design may be preserved by researching subscriber and non-sub- scriber groups of a given medium. With the cooperation of a newspaper it is pos- sible to print much material on a given .subject. The logical assumption is that subscribers will be exposed to a larger amount of material than non- subscribers. To study increases in the information levels and attitude changes, the groups are studied before and after the printings. Results with the technique seem to indicate that: (1) Subscribers score significantly higher on in- formation tests about the subject. (2) Subscribers more often designate the news- paper as their source of subject information. (3) Intensity of attitude toward the subject is higher among subscribers. (4) Where the subject matter is of a nature that requires community action, subscribers seem to desire such action. "With further refinement the technique should offer a workable plan for determining the nature and degree of attitude formation and change in real audiences of media." 20.8 Operations Research-A New Science? Malcolm W. Hoag, The Journal of Business, July, 1957, pp. 162-171. [S.C.H.] Defining operations research as an analytical technique emphasizing mathematical models, Hoag discusses several problems implicit in its use. One is the criterion problem, since the model usually in- volves optimization or maximization in terms of some selected criterion. If the criterion does not coincide with the client's true needs, the results may be worthless or harmful. A somewhat related value problem concerns the extent to which the re- searcher should make recommendations which help his immediate client, but which are sub-optimal to society or some component of it. Study design also involves judgment problems in avoiding exces- sive study of all conceivable alternatives, yet also avoiding undue restriction. Finally there is the problem of feeding valid data into the model. Hoag feels that some researchers will justify poor data 327 MARKETING RESEARCH</page><page sequence="13">328 THE JOURNAL OFMRK N J on one variable or a poor assumption, on the grounds that "it doesn't materially affect the final result," without adequate attention to cumulative errors resulting from many such assumptions in the model. 21. RETAILING 21.1 The Doubtful Logic of Layout. Super Market Merchandising, June, 1957, pp. 52-78. [w.L.] Marketers interested in the problems of layouts, or specifically in the layout of supermarkets will find this article to be of technical and general interest. The article is organized around six major topics: the problems, the lady and the layout, lay- outs-hopeful and helpful, a free design for pleasant shopping, plan for a super supermarket, grocery bays-a novel layout dimension. 21.2 Patterns of Business Growth and Survival in a Medium-Sized Community. Sidney Goldstein and Kurt Mayer, The Journal of Economic History, June, 1957, pp. 193-206. [E.J.K.] Since 1951 an interdisciplinary research seminar at the University of Pennsylvania has been study- ing the population, social structure, and economy of Norristown, Pennsylvania. A variety of investiga- tions have been under the central theme of tech- nological change and social adjustment to discover the impacts of industrialization and urbanization in the Norristown community. One such study, using city directories as the data source, attempted to reconstruct the industrial and business structure of the community and the changes that have oc- curred since 1900oo. Much interesting information was accumulated and analyzed about the number and type of businesses entering and leaving the Norristown economy and on the survival patterns of different classes of business over an extended time period. The findings on business mortality were similar to those of other studies. One of every three new enterprises did not survive for three years, and only one lasted more than ten years. No con- sistent differences appeared among the various fields of business activity with regard either to length of survival or turnover rates. On the other hand the Norristown data seems to suggest a close connection on the local level be- tween the development of human and business populations. It was found that the stabilization of the Norristown population reflected itself in in- creased stability in the growth and composition of the business structure. The patterns of survival in Norristown exhibit greater longevity than do other local studies, and increasingly so in recent decades, when business turnover declined as the population of the city became more stable. A hypothesis is suggested that continued in- creases in population on the local level stimulate a too rapid growth of business enterprises. Because some excess businesses cannot be supported, the rate of new business mortality is very high and the average length of business longevity lowered. The economic atmosphere generated by a stable popula- tion results in the number of new enterprise forma- tions conforming more closely to the number sup- portable by the stable population. This suggests the importance of evaluating the economic and demographic development of a city when con- sidering business mortality and turnover. 21.3 Let's Look at the Facts. Curt Kornblau, Super Market Merchandising, May, 1957, pp. 63-68. [W.L.] Curt Kornblau, director of research for Super Market Institute reports the preliminary findings of the ninth annual report by members of S.M.I. These findings are based on the first 280 companies that returned their questionnaires. The survey refers to 1956 and represents a total of 2,953 stores with a sales volume of $4,o88,ooo,ooo. Among the main findings are: 1. An average sales gain of 18 per cent over 1955. 2. An average sales gain of 5 per cent in those stores which were open throughout both 1955 and 1956. 3. One out of every six supermarkets operated by S.M.I. members (17 per cent) was added in 1956, and 7 per cent of the established stores underwent major remodeling. 4. While 44 per cent of the member operators expanded; purchases or mergers accounted for a larger portion of the expansion-22 per cent. 5. Members have definite plans for opening 23 new markets for every ioo operating in Janu- ary, 1957. 6. Store operating expenses rose at a faster rate than sales. 7. Net profit ratios (after taxes)-44 per cent re- ported a lower net, 39 per cent a higher net, and 17 per cent no change over 1955. The report also includes information on operat- ing ratios, trading stamps, self-service frozen foods, non-foods, productivity and sales ratios, incentives, and overall store management. 21.4 Supermarkets Face the Future. William Apple- baum and David Carson, Harvard Business Review, March-April, 1957, pp. 127-135. [J.M.R.] After reviewing the emergence of the super- market as the significant food distributor today, the authors draw upon statistics and business judgment to make certain predictions covering roughly the next decade. Some of their more note- worthy estimations concerning the immediate future of supermarkets are as follows: a. Pace of expansion is to continue until 196o and then slacken off. THE JOURNAL OF MARKETING Tanuary 1958 . 328</page><page sequence="14">MARKETING RESEARCH 329~~~~ b. Competitive pressure is to become stronger. c. Major expansion of lines will be in processed "'convenience" foods that require a minimum of home time and effort. d. Supermarket operators expect an increase in private brands. e. Less "selling" and more merchandising will be evident in retailer-wholesaler-supplier relations. f. Although newspapers will continue to be the principal promotional medium, large chains will make greater use of television and national publi- cations. g. Overall size is likely to stabilize in the range of 20,000 to 30,000 square feet. h. Store designs will come in for rigid scrutiny. i. Personnel problems will gain increasing atten- tion: executive recruitment and development; gen- eral administrators to supercede specialists at all levels. j. Some increase in margins and expenses is anticipated. On balance, the authors see no major break- through in food distribution similar to the emergence of the chains or to the mass merchan- dising techniques of the supermarkets; yet they warn that merely moving with the tide will not be adequate in view of the trends they visualize. 21.5 Premium Preferences of Retailers. Super Mar- ket Merchandising, July, 1957, p. 107. [W.L.] This article is a brief report on some of the results of a detailed market study of premium use in 1955 just released by the Premium Advertising Association of America. "Straight giveaways top the list of premiums offered by store retailers." Trading stamps rank second-41 per cent of the retailers used them as customer incentives. 51 per cent of the retailers re- ported that they intended to increase the amount of stamps given to customers while only 24 per cent planned to use more giveaways. Premiums were reported to be an effective draw- ing card for new customers and a means of keeping present customers loyal. More than 54 per cent of the respondents stated that premiums increase average size of purchases. Of the retailers surveyed who use premiums, 14 per cent spend over $100,000 per year on them, 35 per cent spend between $o10,- ooo and $100,000 and 51 per cent spend up to $10,000. 21.6 Soldiers Eating Irradiated Meals. Super Mar- ket Merchandising, July, 1957, p. o106. [W.L.] "Irradiated foods are closer than you think . .. United States troops will begin swallowing gam- marayed foods in the coming year." All sorts of food from bacon to berries will be sterilized and pasteurized by an atomic process. While atomically treated food is harmless it is going to be hard to convince the consumer of this fact. Since irradia- tion has suffered a barrage of adverse criticism from both scientists and layman a strong educa- tional program will have to be aimed at the general public. 21.7 For More Potency . . . Big Chains Decentral- ize. Super Market Merchandising, July, 1957, pp. 59-64. [W.L.] Several food chains are redesigning management methods so that every branch or division can func- tion almost as a separate chain. The objective is to split the "monarchy" up into a "republic" of self- contained, free-wheeling divisions, each able to pursue policies designed to fit operating conditions of its area. The article discusses the reorganization plans of Safeway, Kroger, Colonial, and Grand Union, which led to increased profits, and explains what each company did and why. 21.8 Characteristics of Retail Trade Employment. Jules Backman, Journal of Retailing, Summer, 1957, pp. 79-92. [S-C.H.] The fourth in a series of articles by Dr. Backman. Among the characteristics of retail employment noted is high cyclical stability of full-time per- manent employment, largely due to relative sta- bility in sales volume but partly due to the existence of a buffer or cushion in the more-easily adjusted part-time and seasonable staffs. Retailing uses. higher proportions of women and young people (many of whom are not available for full- time work) than most other industries. Educational requirements are not high and the degree of unionization is low. 21.9 Leasing Space in a Planned Shopping Center. Robert L. Smith, Journal of Retailing, Sum- mer, 1957, pp. 63-68. [s.c.H.] This case study of four branch stores operated by one hardware retailer in four suburban shopping centers leads to some generalizations of interest to all small retailers considering entering a shop- ping center. Two of the branches proved success- ful, two did not. Management adopted similar policies and practices for all four branches, and external evidence indicated that the volume of center-traffic provided the key to success or failure. The volume of traffic in the center seemed to vary directly with the size of the center and also with the rate of growth in the supporting community. On the other hand, the existence of strong com- petitive shopping centers affected traffic adversely. 21.10 How Vulnerable Are Supermarkets to Reces- sion? Dwight Gentry, Journal of Retailing, Summer, 1957, pp. 57-60. [s.c.H.] Low percentage margins, high ratios of fixed costs to net profits, considerable volume in food and non-food luxuries and impulse items suggest MARKETING RESEARCH 329</page><page sequence="15">3JOTu that many supermarket operations could be hurt by any sizable reduction in consumer purchasing power. 23. SALES MANAGEMENT (including Salesman- ship) 23.1 Automobile Allowances for Salesmen. N.I.C.B. Management Record, March, 1957, pp. 82-83. [J.M.R.] This annual survey by the National Industrial Conference Board covers automobile ownership plans, methods of reimbursement, and the expense items that are included. Seven cents is still the modal mileage rate paid to salesmen in the United States who drive their own automobiles. In Canada the figure is ten cents; the higher rate in the latter country is due presumably to higher gasoline costs and differences in territory coverage. Other sig- nificant findings: 1. Salesmen-owned automobiles are used ex- clusively or in part by about 80 per cent of the reporting companies; 2. Salesmen-owned automobiles cost more to operate, on the average, than do company-owned or company-leased automobiles; 3. In addition to the basic allowance, most com- panies also pay for variable expenses such as tolls and parking. 23.2 Spotlight Shifts to Nontechnical Salesmen. Chemical Week, August lo, 1957, pp. 54, 56, 58. [w.c.] Non-technical salesmen have always been used by the chemical industry. But as technology expanded, companies hired more with chemical or engineer- ing training. Now the move is to greater use of non-technically trained men. Here are the reasons: (i) shortage of technical manpower; (2) disinterest of technical graduates in sales; (3) higher salaries in non-sales jobs initially; (4) unfamiliarity of technical people with sales careers. For the chemical company, hiring non-technical men for sales, there are important advantages: (i) the policy allows sales departments to be adequately staffed; (2) the pool from which selection can be made is greatly widened; (3) the non-technical salesman brings a different viewpoint to the staff. 23.3 How Do You Handle Travel Expenses? Chemi- cal Week, August 17, 1957, pp. 69, 70, 72. [w.c.] A recent survey of 320 companies shows some in- teresting guideposts in sales cost budgeting. In 41 per cent of the companies, salesmen use personal cars exclusively. In another 33 per cent of companies, company cars must be used. In the rest, both approaches are used. About half the firms own the cars, the rest lease. Mileage allowances vary widely. About 51 per cent of the companies allow six to eight cents per mile. Only nine per cent permit charges over eight cents a mile. In 40 per cent of the companies, salesmen can use the company-owned vehicle for personal use, in the rest only for business. 24. SALES AND ECONOMIC FORECASTS 24.1 A Forecast in Retrospect. William Copulsky, Chemical and Engineering News, August 12, 1957, p. 116. [w.c.] Five years ago the President's Material Policy Commission's Report ("the Paley report") contained a number of forecasts for the 1955 production of synthetic organic chemicals. Of forty-one such fore- casts analyzed, only about one-third came to within 15 per cent of actual, and only two-thirds within 30 per cent of actual. For slow-growing products, the forecasts generally tend to be too high, and for fast-growing products, the forecasts are too low generally. 24.2 Two Important Problems in Sales Forecasting. James H. Lorie, The Journal of Business, July, 1957, pp. 172-179. [S.C.H.] The two problems are (i) combining statistical analysis with subjective judgment and (2) evaluat- ing economic forecasts. The first problem involves developing objective reconciliations between the intuitive insights of experienced businessmen and the more rigid, but not necessarily more satisfac- tory, techniques of the statisticians. Conventional methods of forecasting have serious limitations. Regression analysis involves danger- ous assumptions as to the linear relationship of the dependent to the independent variables, except for some residuals which are presumed normally and independently distributed about the same standard deviation, regardless of the values of the "inde- pendent" variables. Moreover, regression analysis merely changes the problem to one of forecasting the "independent" variables (Lorie does not discuss lagged variables). Salesmen's forecasts benefit from close and continuous contact with the market (or at least some part of it) but are prepared by poorly trained analysts subject to considerable turnover, and surveys of consumer intentions are still rela- tively untested, expensive devices capable only of measuring direction of change. Two alternative techniques are then recom- mended for achieving objective reconciliation. The "filter technique" involves creation of a simple statistical model, testing it by projecting it back- wards, noting all deviations between actual sales and what the model would have projected, using executive insights to provide explanations for the deviations, assigning statistical values to the ex- 330 THE JOURNAL OF MARKETING January 1958</page><page sequence="16">MAKTN R C planations, revising the model and retesting it. The skeptic's technique involves projection of trend lines for each product through statistical tech- niques, and the preparation of independent esti- mates by executive experts. If the experts' estimates fall within two standard deviations of the statistical projection, they are accepted. Otherwise manage- ment has a problem for which no solution is presented here. Evaluation of economic forecasts is in a crude state compared to techniques developed in analyz- ing meteorological forecasts. Recommended steps include emphasis upon written, unambiguous fore- casts, without "weasel-words," whose predictive scores can be measured; consideration of the rela- tive difficulty in preparing forecasts for different economic variables, and dollar measures of the success or failure of various predictors. 26. STATISTICAL DATA (including Sources, Types, Revisions, and New Series) 26.1 Dallas Southwest Map and Business Data Sheet for Dallas Southwest Area. (Dallas, Texas: Dallas Chamber of Commerce.) [J.E.S.] The Dallas Southwest map and accompanying data sheet give information by county for Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Arkansas, New Mexico and Western Tennessee. For the 6io coun- ties covered by the map and revised data sheet, information is given on population, retail sales, wholesale sales, manufacturing employment, esti- mated effective total buying income, number of families, per family buying income and farm income. This information is summarized by states, and additional information on a statewide basis is shown covering value added by manufacturing, construction contract awards, bank deposits, life insurance in force, motor vehicle registrations and value of mineral production. The same information is broken into oo mile radii circles from Dallas. The data have been gathered from U. S. Govern- ment Census information, Sales Management's "Survey of Buying Power," State Motor Vehicle Departments, and other familiar sources, and is conveniently compiled on the data sheet for those concerned with this area. 26.2 Errors of the Third Kind in Statistical Con- sulting. A. W. Kimball, Journal of the Ameri- can Statistical Association, June, 1957, pp. 133-142. [E.J.K.] The thesis of the article is that inexperienced statisticians, including most of those fresh from the graduate schools, are not equipped, nor even aware of the existence of a third kind of error; the error committed by giving the right answer to the wrong problem. Examples of such errors are given. One implication for marketers is to always discuss the problem in complete perspective with the statistician for errors of the third kind are basically caused by inadequate communication between the consultant and the research worker. 26.3 Standard Industrial Classification Manual. Re- vised Edition, GPO, Washington, D. C., July, 1957. [K.A.G.] This important revision, based in part on much organized advice from industrial marketing men, represents a minor milestone in industrial market- ing research, important to most marketing men and research economists who use the U.S. Census of Manufactures or other Federal Government figures. For at least some readers it may not be redun- dant to add that while many significant improve- ments have been made, this system of classification is still far from foolproof. For reasons inherent in any currently practical method of accumulating Government figures, each user of these figures will be well advised to walk carefully and to draw his conclusions warily. The true division lines between most industries and between most industrial mar- kets are blurred at best. 28. TEACHING OF MARKETING 28.1 Retail Training and Certification-The British Experiment and American Analogies. Stanley C. Hollander, Journal of Retailing, Summer, 1957, pp. 69-78. [s.c.H.] A description of a British program developed by the Ministry of Education and the City and Guilds of London Institute for the award of a "National Retail Distribution Certificate" testifying to the successful completion of certain educational quali- fications for retailing. The program is compared to some American certificates in such fields as finance, insurance, credit, real estate, banking, secretarial work, and jewelry distribution. 29. THEORY OF MARKETING (including Com- petition) 29.1 The Value Added Concept as a Measurement of Output. Theodore N. Beckman, Advanced Management, April, 1957, pp. 6-9. [J.M.R.] From the premise that management has to do with the most effective and economical use of all factors of production in the attainment of a desired output, Professor Beckman argues that current measures of output (production, shipments, sales, receipts, etc.) are inadequate, primarily because they involve duplication-that is, the costs of materials, parts, and supplies purchased from others. He believes that value added best measures the output of all segments of the economy. Although value added as reported by the Census of Manufacturers theoretically relates to the process MARKETING RESEARCH 331</page><page sequence="17">332 THE JOURNAL OF MARKETiNG January 1958~~~~~~~.7 or function of manufacture, actually, it is an insti- tutional concept and covers all activities of the manufacturer, including distribution and market- ing. The author cites the following advantages deriv- ing from use of value added throughout the economy: a. It is the best reasonably available absolute measure of value created. b. It is the best reasonably available relative measure of value created. c. Helps place costs in their proper perspective; cost is a measure of input (of all factors of produc- tion); value added is a measure of output. d. Its use will result in improved public relations in that it would shift emphasis from costs and wastes to value added. Finally, Professor Beckman makes a strong argu- ment for the need to relate increased productivity (the ratio between output and input) to productive factors truly responsible rather than to direct labor alone as is conventional practice today. 29.2 A Conceptual Model for Communications Re- search. Bruce H. Westley and Malcolm S. MacLean, Jr., Journalism Quarterly, Winter, 1957, pp. 31-38. [W.L.] Those readers interested in the theory of face-to- face or mass communications should find this arti- cle to be thought provoking. The authors "attempt to develop a single communications model which may help to order existing findings" and to provide "a system of concepts which will evoke new and in- terrelated research directions." A conceptual model of the communications process, designed to be sufficiently general to treat all kinds of human communication, is developed. The roles and processes needed in communications are isolated and defined. The principal elements in the model are: (i) advocacy roles (the communi- cators), (2) behavioral system roles (the receivers), (3) channel roles (agents in selecting and transmit- ting non-purposively the information the behav- ioral system roles require), (4) the objects and events communicated about, (5) the channels of communication, (6) the processes of encoding and decoding, and (7) feedback. 32. WHOLESALING 32.1 Storage in Motion . . . by the Numbers. Dis- tribution Age, June, 1957, pp. 58-6o. [W.L.] This article describes the new Woolworth two- story distribution center, a 35,000 square foot Bronx warehouse. The latest physical distribution tools, including a punch-code identification system, a fleet of 21 lift trucks, a 2,100 foot-in-floor truck dragging conveyor, 750 floor and selector trucks, 6o0 feet of power roller conveyor, 12 miles of pal- lets and platform racks, 19,ooo pallets, an airtube system, and hydraulically operated dock level de- vices are used to speed merchandise to 800 retail stores located east of the Mississippi. The entire warehouse is laid out to duplicate the stock loca- tion plan followed by all Woolworth stores. 32.2 Flexible Distribution via Public Warehousing. John H. Frederick, Distribution Age, July, 1957, pp. 42 ff. [W.L.] Public warehousing may be the answer to the problem of establishing branch house facilities and still maintaining flexible low-cost warehouse op- erations, which is facing many companies. Before utilizing public warehousing facilities, however, management must consider the type of product, concentration of sales, factory production schedules, possible savings in distribution costs, financing needs and whether the company wishes to avoid rigidity in their system of distribution. 32.3 Modem Distribution-Plain and Fancy. Law- rence M. Rogers, Distribution Age, July, 1957, pp. 32-34 ff. [W.L.] Describes in detail the new plant designed, and process adopted by Lambert-Hudnut Manufactur- ing Company, to develop a modern system of physi- cal distribution which integrates warehousing and automated order picking. 33.

[s.c.H.] This interesting editorial, written by the founder of a large specialty mail order business, suggests that business ethics have declined dangerously in recent years. Failures of suppliers to meet prior commitments are cited as evidence in support of this thesis. 33.3 Papers and Proceedings of the 69th Annual Meeting of the American Economic Associa- tion. American Economic Review, May 1957- [S.C.H.] As usual, practically all of the papers in this AER supplement have interesting implications for marketing. Especially pertinent, perhaps, are sec- tions on monopoly, income distribution, and con- sumption. In the monopoly and antitrust session, Edward H. Levi, "The Monopoly Problem as Viewed by a Lawyer," pp. 293-302, considers antitrust legislation as a device to curb economic power. Earl Latham, "Anthropomorphic Corporations, Elites and Mo- nopoly Power," pp. 303-310, compares Galbraith's theory of countervailance (here considered inade- quate unless broadened to include government as one of the countervailers) with C. Wright Mills' theory of an interlocking political, economic and military elite (criticized as an over-simplification). Carl Kaysen, "The Social Significance of the Mod- ern Corporation," pp. 311-319, notes the extent to which the modern large corporation, which is aban- doning the traditional economic calculus, is never- theless inculcating business values into society. "Changes in the Size Distribution of Income" by Selma F. Goldsmith, pp. 504-518, reviews the share of income (under various definitions) going to the top 5 per cent of consumer units and offsets pre- vailing views on the decreasing inequality of in- comes. Irwin Friend and Irving Kravis, "Consumption Patterns and Permanent Income," pp. 536-555, pre- sent an analysis of BLS-Wharton data showing that consumers with changing incomes have con- sumption patterns strongly resembling those of steady-income consumers. In "Government and the Consumer Interest," pp. 556-568, Warren J. Bilkey</page><page sequence="21">336 THE JOURNAL OF MARKETING reviews the history of consumer protection in the U. S. and also notes recent developments abroad. Bilkey argues that the role of government in this field should be defined by a "Solidarist" norm which would accept extension of federal controls, development of grass roots measures and increased consumer education within the existing politico- economic framework, since the public has rejected laissez faire, Marxian, Socialistic and countervail- ance norms. A joint session with the AMA (also available in Adaptive Behavior in Marketing), includes papers by this abstracter, "Theoretical Implications of Empirical Research on Retail Pricing," pp. 252-265; Morris A. Adelman, "The 'Product' and Price in Distribution," pp. 266-273, and Richard B. Hefle- bower, pp. 274-287, "Mass Distribution: A Phase of Bilateral Oligopoly or of Competition?" Adel- man concludes that the monopoly elements in wholesale and retail trade are offset to some de- gree by the low entry requirements while Hefle- bower explores a considerable number of dimen- sions in retail competition. january 1958 33.4 Ideas From Outsiders Can Be Dangerous. Bes- sie A. Lepper, Chemical Week, August 17, 1957, pp. 108-114, ii6, 118. [w.c.] Beware the individual with the bright idea for your company. If not handled right, an unre- quested idea can cost a great deal in damages and legal costs. One company is now fighting a four million dollar claim. The incidence of these cases, moreover, is growing every year. Any management man from board chairman on down can have an unsolicited idea unexpectedly foisted upon him. Here are eight ways to answer an idea contribu- tor and keep damages at a minimum: (i) Refuse to accept the idea in confidence; (2) return all docu- ments stating that no copies were made; (3) keep all documents in a sealed file until the contributor signs an agreement; (4) cite references if the infor- mation is published; (5) refuse to admit the idea is new, novel, concrete, or unknown; (6) send an agreement form if the idea is worthwhile; (7) re- quest the invention be remitted as a patent appli- cation; (8) request the contributor to meet with company officials to negotiate further. .1 i</page></plain_text>
