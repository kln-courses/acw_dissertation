<plain_text><page sequence="1">PIERO BOCCARDO Gregorio De Ferrari, Giovanni Palmieri, Bartolomeo Steccone and the furnishings of the Palazzo Rosso, Genoa* TH E gift in 1874 of the Palazzo Rosso to the city of Genoa by Maria duchessa di Galliera (1811-88), the last representative of the house of Brignole-Sale, included not only the well- known collection of paintings but also sets of furnishings which were further augmented after the donor's death and constitute an outstandingly fine and coherent ensemble. Their historical significance has further been enhanced by the subsequent transferral to the city of the family archive by the heirs, the principi Carrega Bertolini; and now that the archive has become available to scholars after the customary period of restriction it has begun to yield information fundamental for the full study of this rich heritage.' By way of introduction, it is necessary to give a brief account of how the principal nucleus of the collection was assembled. The generation of Brignole who flourished dur- ing much of the eighteenth century consisted of four brothers - Giovanni Francesco, Giovanni Giacomo, Ridolfo and Giuseppe - each of whom, usually on marrying, furnished his residence in a manner appropriate to the taste of the time with the ample means provided by the family fortune. As the two elder brothers died without male issue, the greater part of the inheritances of three of the brothers eventually came together in the Palazzo Rosso, which had since 1711 been entailed on the primogenital line of the family (see Appendix I, below). From the end of the eighteenth century up to the donation of 1874, however, the family occupied the palace only infrequently, while maintaining it excellently, and for this reason the majority of the grand furnishings that had thus come together were preserved without suffering the usual consequences of changing fashion. Study of the archival documents concerning the patri- monies of these four brothers leads to a reassessment of the contribution each made to the final ensemble that has come down to us. In particular, the r61le of the eldest, Giovanni Francesco II Brignole-Sale (1695-1760) needs to be modi- fied. His important contribution to the formation of the col- lection of pictures has led to the assumption that it was he who was responsible for the extremely high quality of all the furniture in the palace that dates from the first half of the eighteenth century. This view has been supported by what we know of his ostentatious embassy to Paris in 1737-39 and of the works he commissioned for his ancestral home: these Awqw JI rY i ov 1.

It now appears, for example, that it was the second brother, Giovan- ni Giacomo Brignole (1696-1734) who acquired the slab of *I am extremely grateful to the director, Liana Saginati, as well as to Raffaella Ponte and all the staff of the Archivio Storico del Comune di Genova who have always been of the greatest help in my research into the Brignole-Sale inheritance.

(Galleria di Palazzo Rosso, Genoa). alabastrofiorito that forms the top of the pier-table now in the Sala dell'estate.4 The fact that it was acquired - in Rome - in 1728, implies that the table supporting it (Fig.4) was probably also carved at the end of the 1720s, though like two others in Genoese palaces it shows slightly retardataire stylistic affini- ties with French examples dating from the end of Louis XIV's reign. On the other hand it was the youngest brother, Ridol- fo Brignole (1708-74) who paid, during 1738, for the ornate mirror which has hung over this pier-table since at least the nineteenth century (though they were not, as we shall see, placed in the Sala dell'estate until 1961). The detailed bill, which amounts to 1260 Genoese lire (excluding the mirror- glass) describes it minutely as having: 'intaglio con puttini, teste et altro' at the bottom, with 'guarnizioni difogliami efruttipendenti' and 'rapporti d'intaglio figurati in aquilotti, leoni et altro che servono per divisioni di gionte delli pezzi piccoli di specchio' at the sides, with a 'cimasa, o sia lavoro che adorna la mezza luna sopra la luce [di spec- chio] grande' and a 'cornicetta di noce stretta, intagliata e traforata, attorno'. When publishing this document in her recent book, Laura Tagliaferro did not connect it with the existing mirror (Fig.2) - which is undoubtedly the most beautiful of its type in the Palazzo - and also failed to give the name of its maker.5 The latter is recorded as Bartolomeo Steccone, a wood carv- er who is known to have been recommended by Domenico Parodi to Filippo Juvarra in 1735, on the strength of which Juvarra procured him an order to make thirty pier-tables for the Spanish court at Madrid that year.6 Other papers in the Brignole-Sale archive show that Stec- cone maintained commercial links with Spain, but his docu- mented authorship of this mirror will undoubtedly prompt other attributions to him. A first, tentative, one might be a second pier-table, also made for Ridolfo II, which is one of the most celebrated pieces of furniture in Palazzo Rosso on account of its splendid top of veneered amethyst (Fig.3). A set of payments dating from betweenJune 1738 and September 1739 shows that this amethyst slab was made at Rome by Francesco Perini, described as 'capo maestro scarpellino alla Chiesa nova nella Piazza di Sforza'. The staggering of the pay- ments was perhaps due to the slab's almost incredible cost, which - including packing and transport, an assessment by the 'architect' Agostino Frontoni and an export licence from the Cardinal Camerlengo - amounted to 1599 Genoese lire, about four times more than the already high price Giovanni Giacomo had paid for one slab of alabastrofiorito ten years ear- lier. In this case too, the payments have been published and connected to the amethyst slab, although a misunderstanding of the phrase 'con opera alla Chinese intorno' has led to the assumption that the original support of carved wood had been lost.7 In fact no such support was made in Rome, for the documents, which are concerned only with the slab, clearly indicate that the phrase is used to describe the decoration of the rim of the table-top where there is an applied band of gilt 4See ASC, BS, registro 87, fol.54, and TAGLIAFERRO, op.cit. at note 1 above, p.94, who does not, however, identify the piece. Two slabs were acquired at a cost of 868 Genoese lire, and it is thus unclear whether the pier-table that survives in Palazzo Rosso is that which is later documented among the goods inherited from Ridolfo or whether it is the one which may, one presumes, have been assigned to the eldest brother Giovanni Francesco. 5ASC, BS, Filza XL, 21stJuly 1738; TAGLIAFERRO, op.cit. at note 1 above, p.97 and p. 122, note 113.

Mirror and frame by an unknown Genoese carver. Second half of the 17th century. Ebony and gilt wood, 180 by 120 cm. (Galleria Nazionale di Palazzo Spinola, Genoa). copper, characteristic of Roman work.8 It has not yet proved possible to identify any document specifically concerned with the carving of the table's base, but it is clear that this must have been done at around the time the amethyst slab was acquired. Several of the carved figurative details on the table - the dragons on the stretcher, and the eagles and posies of flowers on the apron- are so close in style and execution to similar elements on Steccone's mirror that one is tempted to suggest that both are by the same hand, although the daring and elegant curve of the bracket-shapes at the top of the legs speaks of a rather more up-to-date style than Steccone had employed only about a year earlier in the mirror.9 It should be noted in passing that the leonine elements in the legs- the paw feet and protome heads - are references to the Brignole family coat-of-arms. The most important new information to have emerged, however, concerns the celebrated 'Brignole mirror' (Fig.6) whose complex history can now begin to be unravelled; and although certain episodes remain obscure, it is nevertheless clear that everything that has been written about it up to now needs radical revision. The fame of this monumental piece of furniture goes back to 1875 when the Genoese historian Federigo Alizeri attrib- uted its execution to the sculptor Filippo Parodi.1? Although there is no mention of it in any early source, the attribution has continually been repeated in the literature - only one voice, in 1949, damning the mirror as 'secentescamente macchi- noso'." In 1961 when the palace was re-arranged and the col- lections redisplayed, the curators Franco Albini and Caterina Marcenaro, set out to celebrate its presumed author and to emphasise the sculptural qualities that make it so much more than a mere piece of furniture by moving it from the wall between the two windows of the Sala dell'estate where it had, as we shall see, always been located (Fig.8), and exhibiting it in the great Salone, not placed against a wall but isolated in all its grandeur." From this position - which has come to seem more and more incongruous - its fame grew further: Paola Briasco, who devoted a lengthy discussion to it in her monograph on Parodi of 1962, counted it among the artist's best works; and more recently Ezia Gavazza has sought to confirm its autograph status and to establish its date of exe- cution by publishing four interesting documents, three of which are payments to Parodi made between 1st December 1679 and 24th November 1680.13 These are somewhat ambiguous, for the first is specified as being 'a conto dell' orna- mento d'intaglio ordinato . . . per sopra cornici alli dui specchi grandi', while the third and fourth speak of only one mirror ('dell' orna- mento del specchio'), and Gavazza tentatively concluded that only one mirror was brought to completion. But in spite of the publication of these, in any case rather vague, docu- mentary references, Alvar Gonzailez-Palacios has always remained sceptical, considering the mirror unworthy of Par- odi's hand, and the force of his opinion has induced Lauro Magnani to adopt an equivocal position in a recent survey of Genoese sculpture, although he attributes the design to the sculptor.14 The history of the Brignole-Sale inheritance in the seven- teenth century makes it clear that the documents published by Gavazza cannot refer to the great Brignole mirror. The payments they record were made by Ridolfo I Brignole-Sale (1631-83) who died before completing the furnishings of his apartment in the second piano nobile of Palazzo Rosso. He left only one child, a girl, and by the terms of the Brignole-Sale entail his dwelling and the titles passed to his younger broth- er Giovanni Francesco I (1643-94; see Appendix I, below), while all furniture and paintings not subject to the entail went to his daughter. From her Giovanni Francesco I purchased back some items which it was convenient to keep in the palace, but these did not include any mirrors.5 In any case, Ridolfo I's payments to Parodi - accounts which were not brought to a final quittance - surely refer to one or two mir- rors which, because of the relatively low sums involved, must have been considerably smaller than the great Brignole mir- ror. It seems much more likely that they were similar in appearance to that of a mirror in the Galleria di Palazzo Spinola di Pellicceria at Genoa (Fig.5) which shows exactly the sort of carved ornament above the frame mentioned in the payments.

Starting at the base, close inspection reveals various oddities, such as the position of the lions which almost entirely conceal the elegant volutes behind them, to say nothing of the floating putto in the middle, whose glance is directed, quite incongruously, at the ground. Although all the gilding appears to be old, that of the two hor- izontal shell elements on either side of this putto's head is clearly different in tone from the gilding of the other ele- ments, while the lions, the volutes and these two shells retain metal brackets, grooves and screw-holes left over from some earlier and very different installation. The projecting hori- zontal moulding which runs behind the shells and separates the base from the frame of the mirror itself is in four pieces which have clearly been adapted from some other use, while the two volute elements above the tops of the shells turn out to be factitious and were originally intended to contain an arrangement of small pieces of mirror within individual com- partments. The slip-frame with an elongated egg-and- dart motif immediately surrounding the two large sheets of mirror-glass is in an entirely Settecento taste (Fig.9)- and, as we shall see below, appears to be a later addition to to"' 8.

The boy at the top right - the only large-scale figurative element on the mirror to recall Parodi's naturalistic style - is different from the other three putti in quality and physical type, while the rigid butterfly wings of all four figures are fashioned in different ways and in more than one case are clearly later additions. From purely internal observation, then, it seems clear that neither the design nor the execution of the Brignole mirror in its present state is consistent with the work of the great sculptor of the Genoese baroque, and comparison with the equally famous monumental mirror in the villa Durazzo Faraggiana at Albisola (Fig. 7), which was attributed to Parodi as early as the eighteenth century, only clinches the matter. Although recent restoration has shown that the Durazzo mir- ror has been increased in height at some time in the distant past, the carving is much more homogeneous and the result- ing ensemble more successful; there is no reason to doubt its attribution to the master.17 If the Brignole mirror is not by Parodi- and no documen- tation has been found to suggest that it might be - the "bThe restoration, not yet entirely completed, was undertaken by Franco Aguzzi and Maria Profumo under the direction of the present author and Marzia Cataldi Gallo.

They do, however, provide useful glimpses of its history. The first explicit and unequivocal mention of it dates from the inventories drawn up after the death in 1760 of Giovanni Francesco II Brignole-Sale, the eldest of the four eighteenth-century Brignole brothers. The Palazzo Rosso and all the goods within it were then inherited by the youngest brother, Ridolfo II, and in the inventory (which, alas, does not include valuations) of furniture destined for him appears the 'specchio con luce grande, e sua cimasa con cornice antica, con putti e piedi con due lioni, e due branche di legno da lumi 3 per ognuno, ii tutto dorato, nel salotto dell'Estate'.'8 With this descrip- tion in mind we need to turn back half a century, to the divi- sion of property made in 1717 between the two eldest of the brothers, Giovanni Francesco II and Giovanni Giacomo whose father, Anton Giulio II had died in 1710. Among the items assigned to Giovanni Francesco II we find a 'luce di spec- chio nel secondo salotto [i.e. the Sala dell'estate, with] all'intorno figure pitturate e lavori d'intaglio di legno dorato' valued at 760 Genoese lire.9 The fact that this costly mirror occupies the same position as the one specified in the 1760 inventory sug- gests that both documents describe the same object, and that any apparent discrepancies may probably be accounted for by the imprecise vocabulary of the anonymous compilers of these two inventories rather than by any alterations or addi- tions to the carved elements in the fifty years that separate them. The 1717 deed of division contains another interesting ref- erence, this time in the list of the goods destined for the sec- ond brother, Giovanni Giacomo, where we find 'due leoni e quattro putti dorati per un letto', valued at 180 lire.20 These items, which correspond both in number and in appearance - four putti, two lions - and in their gilt finish to those on the mir- ror do not reappear in the archive and there is no trace of them in any documents concerning Giovanni Giacomo's legacy. But although, as we shall see, it is unlikely that these particular lions and putti are the same as those found on the mirror, this entry of 1717 is of crucial importance to the story. First, it alerts us to the fact that a number of carved and gilt elements from or for a bed were present in the palace at this time and thus suggests a possible source for the decorative elements assembled in the mirror. Secondly, it allows us to hypothesise that, given the strictly equal division of the inher- itance, Giovanni Francesco II may well have been allocated an equivalent group of objects, and if this was indeed the case - they may already have been integrated into the mirror at the time the deed of division was drawn up. But before this hypothesis can be tested, it is necessary to look for the bed. The first major clue to the possible existence of a bed from which such objects could have derived presented itself serendipitously. The phrase 'due leoni e quattro putti . . . per un letto' put me in mind ofa recently identified sheet in the Gabi- 9.

This unpublished drawing (Fig. 10) was inventoried among the anonymous sheets - it had taken some while for even its obvious Genoese late sev- enteenth-century context to be recognised- and its subject had been misinterpreted as a fountain!" It is, in fact, clearly recognisable as a mature work by Gregorio De Ferrari, for it not only shows his characteristic graphic style, but the expres- sive force of the ornamental parts are very close to those found in other sheets by him."2 And rather than being a foun- tain, it is a design for a monumental carved bed, whose prin- cipal decorative features are heraldic lions, eagles and putti in various poses. Although the perspective is distorted and diffi- cult to read, the form of the bed appears to be as follows: at each corner of a contoured base with a moulded edge, are robust S-shaped brackets supporting lions whose hindquar- ters are raised higher than their heads; these are surmounted by curving foliate scrolls on which perch eagles with out- spread wings and from which leafy branches sprout. As far as can be interpreted, each side is enclosed by further large foli- ate scrolls among whose fronds sport pairs of putti, and one must suppose that these volutes along the sides would have been hinged allowing them to open, rather like an altar chan- cel, to give access to the bed. No indication is given of the 8See ASC, BS, Inventari: Inventario dei mobili del Palazzo Rosso toccati in divi- sione all'Eccellentissimo Ridolfo M.

The mirror retains no trace of them, and it is impossible to tell whether they were originally integral to its structure.

Whatever the final form of the bed, it is worth remarking on the significance of this sheet for expand- ing our knowledge of the tiny group of seventeenth-century state beds known today, with which it conforms well."2 While this is obviously not a final design, there can be little doubt that the resulting piece of furniture must be the source not only of the two lions and four gilt putti listed in 1717 as being 'per un letto', but also of the lions and putti we see on the mirror today. The lion at the extreme right of the drawing, for example, corresponds very closely - down to the smallest details of expression, posture and attitude - with that on the right side of the mirror (Figs. 1 1 and 12), providing almost cer- tain proof that some, at least, of the decorations on the mirror originated from a great carved bed. And in addition to the lions, which must be the two flanking the head of the bed, we can see an analogous correspondence of the two inwardly curving foliate scrolls at the lower part of the mirror with those on which the putti lie in the drawing, and also between at least three of the actual putti - those on the central axis and that on the left of the mirror - with those shown in the drawing. There may well be other elements, insufficiently explicit in the draw- ing, which also recur in the mirror, and it is worth mentioning that the moulded base on which the structure of the mirror rests appears sufficiently close to the bed's footboard to sug- gest that it too was adapted from it. It is now necessary to reconstruct the history of this monu- mental bed. Ironically, the only published source to mention such an item in the Palazzo Rosso attributes it to Filippo Par- odi, and the sculptor whose involvement with the mirror we have dismissed thus comes back to haunt us from the pages of an eighteenth-century historian. In his biography of Parodi published in 1769, Ratti records among his works 'un magnifi- co letto, che conservasi in una camera del maestoso palazzo Brzgnole di Strada Nuova . . . un complesso, anzi un miracolo dell'ingegno e dell' arte'; and he adds: 'questo letto, veramente degno di ogni gran per- sonaggio, servi ad uso dell'Elettore di Baviera, poi Giuseppe II Imperatore, allora che passa per Genova. Ci fu l'anno 1716'.24 How- ever, this story (which does not appear in Ratti's original manuscript)"5 contains at least one obvious error.

Detail of Fig 10. Palazzo Rosso by the twenty-year-old Giovanni Francesco II Brignole was Karl Albrecht, heir to the Elector of Bavaria and later Emperor Charles VII from 1742 to his death in 1745, notJoseph II, who was born only in 1741 and had been four years on the throne when the second volume of Ratti's Vite was published."2 Ratti's whole account of the bed is in any case dubious, for, as we shall see, it is most unlikely that the bed Karl Albrecht slept in was still extant in 1769. But it is clear that a magnificent state bed was indeed made for Palaz- zo Rosso. A series of payments for a 'letto da ricevere' is record- ed from between 1696 and 1698 among the accounts of Anton Giulio II Brignole-Sale - son of Giovanni Francesco I and father of the four Brignole brothers (see Appendix IIA below). The greater part of the sums disbursed were paid to an 'intagliatore', whose origins are hinted at in two places by the appellation 'Romano'.27 As we shall see, his identity can be tentatively established, but it is first necessary to examine the wider context of the decorations undertaken in the palace during the last two decades of the seventeenth century. When Ridolfo I Brignole-Sale died in 1683 without male issue, his younger brother Giovanni Francesco I - the father of Anton Giulio II - became the sole proprietor of the palace which the two brothers had constructed as their joint resi- dence, with a piano nobile for each, during the previous decade. Giovanni Francesco I decided to take the upper piano nobile, originally apportioned to Ridolfo I, as his own dwelling, and within five years had initiated a cycle of frescoes by Domeni- co Piola and, more particularly, by Gregorio de Ferrari, the first phase of which - comprising the great salone, the four ,9-p ?"

Detail of the 'Brignole mirror' (Fig.6). salotti named after the Seasons, and the new gallery made by enclosing the loggia at the back - was completed in 1689.2" It was as part of this great decorative campaign in which all the elements - architecture, decoration and furnishings - were intended to create a unified ensemble exalting the status of their owner, that Giovanni Francesco I commissioned a great silver mirror and a costly chandelier, also of silver, for the salone. Both these items have long since been lost, but from the payments detailing their long and expensive manufacture (see Appendix II below),29 an interesting collaboration between the artists involved emerges. The payments made between 1689 and Giovanni Francesco's death in 1694 are to several craftsmen, one of whom, the silversmith Giovanni Battista Bozzomo, seems to have initially taken on a substan- tial part of the work. In 1695, by which time Giovanni Francesco's son, Anton Giulio II had inherited, Bozzomo was paid off after some disputes, and from 1696 Anton Giulio paid another silversmith, Giovanni Palmieri, for work on both the mirror and for completing the chandelier. The account-book in which the payments for 1696 are recorded refers to him as follows: 'a Giovanni PalmieriArgentiere Romanoper giornate di lavoro al lampadario d'argento lasciato imperfetto e non agiustato da Bozomo, havendo in piu ii detto Romanofatto il gzglio che serve per pomo al medesimo lampadario epesa oncie 66', specifying a payment of 316 lire.3" Although the fact that Palmieri is referred to as 'Argentiere Romano' is in itself insufficient to iden- tify him with the 'Romano intagliatore' paid for work on the bed in this same year, it should be noted that he is here referred to as 'il detto Romano' as if this is what he was normally called.

The fact that models were required is in itself interesting, and we can infer that the model of the bed was made from the drawing (or type of drawing) that we have attributed to Gregorio De Ferrari on the ground that a parallel pro- cedure seems to have occurred in the case of the chandelier, there being a payment to Gregorio in 1694 from Giovanni Francesco II's widow for 'sua assistenza e opera contribuita per i modelli del lampadario d'argento'.3" Given the interconnexions between artists and craftsmen of different specialisations in the service of the Brignole dur- ing these years and Gregorio De Ferrari's participation in almost all the great decorative undertakings conducted in the Palazzo Rosso - to the extent that his r1le was essentially that of artistic director - it is worth asking whether the painter was also involved in designing the lost silver mirror. Among the accounts concerning this costly object one of the most elo- quent is that of April 1693 in which the 'intagliatore' Pellegro Olivari was paid for 'piede intagliato con due figure sotto al specchio grande' (see Appendix III below), that is to say for the base of the pier-table designed to go under the mirror. This reference brings to mind another drawing clearly by Gregorio De Fer- rari's hand, a design for a pier-table which must have made an enormous visual impact - appropriate, one assumes, to the superabundant decoration of the silver mirror that hung above it - when realised in three dimensions. The drawing shows two semi-recumbent youths among luxuriantly grow- ing foliage supported by a moulded base and holding a slab with a moulded border (Fig. 13).33 And although the account is too laconic to provide a secure link between this drawing and the work undertaken by Pellegro Olivari, it is possible to point to several similarities between elements shown in the drawing and elements incorporated in the frame of the great Brignole mirror. Both the physiognomy and the posture of the two youths in the drawing are quite close in morphology to those of the boy - putto is not really the correct term - at the top right of the mirror; there are similar correspondences between the leafy clusters in the drawing and those which crown the mirror; and finally the profile of the moulding of the table-top is identical to that of the horizontal moulding between the base of the mirror and its frame. All this suggests that the pier table made to go under the splendid silver mir- ror may also have provided a source of carved decorative ele- ments for the grandiose gilt mirror. An admittedly modest payment of 16 lire, recorded in December 1716 to the car- penter Giacomo Maggiolo 'per aver aggiustato ilpiede e cornici neri guarniti d'argento dello specchio',34 may well provide, from this point of view, the final coincidence in the story of this piece of 13. Design for a pier-table, by Gregorio De Ferrari. Pen and brown ink with black chalk, grey wash and white heightening on grey paper, 16.1 by 25.5 cm. (Gabinetto Disegni e Stampe di Palazzo Rosso, Genoa) furniture. The removal of elements to complete the wooden structure of the new mirror might well explain why it was necessary to repair the older pier-table that year. Given the complexity and fragmentary nature of the evi- dence, it seems, in conclusion, worth giving a broad outline of the histories of the bed and mirror, and to add some rele- vant details. It would appear then, that in 1696 Anton Giulio II Brignole-Sale, continuing his father's policy of making the family residence as splendid as possible and perhaps influ- enced by the furniture he would have seen in the grander houses of Rome during his long sojourn there only a few years earlier, decided to enrich the furnishings of the Palazzo Rosso with the addition of a monumental state bed.3" The general design was entrusted to Gregorio De Ferrari, known today principally as a painter, but obviously a much more versatile practitioner than has traditionally been assumed,36 who found countless opportunities to demonstrate his excep- tional skills as a decorator and decorative designer in the Palazzo Rosso. It is at this stage that the project drawing for the bed must have been produced, but although the pair of lions, three of the putti and some of the foliate scrolling on the surviving mirror correspond so closely to those shown in the drawing as to leave little doubt as to their provenance, the final appearance of the bed cannot be established with cer- tainty. For example, the list ofpayments given in the 'Quader- netto di spese straordiarie' (see Appendix II below) mentions 'braccie per lumi allefigure', and one wonders whether the leafy branches supporting the eagles in the drawing may have been replaced by anthropomorphic figures holding candelabra in the finished bed.37 (It is of course impossible to know whether these might correspond to the 'branche di legno da lumi' which appear in the description of the mirror in the inventory made after the death of Giovanni Francesco II after 1760.)

BACCHESCHI, in Palaz- zo Durazzo Pallavicini, Bologna [1995], pp.345-46), especially in the light of an addition to the manuscript (in the Archivio Storico Comunale, Genoa) of RATTI'S Vite (cited at note 24 above), which reads: 'In casa Durazzo di Filippo Parodi sono sei statuini di marmo, quattro delle qualifurono lavorate per ornamento d'un letto magnifico'.

In the first instance, he appears to have made a three-dimensional model - something not inconsis- tent with the activities of a silversmith - and he also appears to have been responsible for carving much of its decoration, and specifically three putti, suggesting an unusual compe- tence in several branches of the plastic arts. Palmieri's name has not hitherto been known to historians of the decorative arts, butJennifer Montagu kindly informs me of a payment, dateable to the early 1680s, among the papers of Giovanni Battista Pallavicini in the archive of Palazzo Pallavacini in Rome, recompensing Isidoro Chieti and Giovanni Palmieri for a silver 'bacile lavorato'."8 If this is the same man, it shows him active as a silversmith in Rome during the previous decade, and his employment by the Pallavicini may not only account for his link with Genoa - where he seems to have married into a local family of silversmiths and craftsmen39 - but also perhaps places him in the ambient of the silversmith Giovanni Giardini, long active for Niccol6 Maria Pallavicini in Rome, whose rather later set of prints of Disegni Diversi include projects for pier-tables and mirrors.4" The other craftsmen involved, the gold-beater Badaracco and the gilder Piccozino were paid considerably less than the carver. Their skilled work was supplemented by the ironwork necessary for assembling the bed and work by an anonymous joiner, whose account also shows him as working on the mon- umental ebony and silver mirror on which several other of the craftsmen participated as well. The greatest lacuna in our knowledge is the location in the palace for which the bed was intended, but the most likely place is the Stanza dell'alcova in the second piano nobile which still survives, though greatly altered, and contains as its name implies a substantial alcove for a bed. According to the tradition reported by Ratti, the bed seems to have been in use some eighteen years later, in July 1716 when Karl Albrecht Wittelsbach was lodged in Palazzo Rosso, and it is unlikely to have been dismantled before this date since the man who commissioned it, Anton Giulio II had died only six years ear- lier in 1710 when his four sons were still minors, and there had been no obvious occasion, such as a wedding or the divi- sion of the inheritance, for the arrangement of the palace to be altered. On the other hand, the visit of so august a per- sonage as the prince may well have prompted a decision to make radical changes in the state rooms, especially in view of the upheavals consequent on the division of the inheritance between the two brothers the next year, which must already have been being planned at this time. As we have seen, the bed seems to have been dismantled by the time of the deed of division of 1717, where its disjecta membra appear, but in which there is no mention of a bed of such obvious importance. If it did occupy the Stanza dell'alcova its demise can probably be dated to 1717, when that room was radically transformed, with major alterations to the masonry to provide new spaces and change the orientation so that the alcove was no longer aligned with Giovanni Andrea Carlone's fresco of the Dis- prezzo del mondo on the vault.41 It is also around this time that we find the mirror in the Sala dell'estate described as having 'figure pitturate all'intorno', and the weight of evidence strongly suggests that by this time the mirror must already have sub- stantially acquired its present appearance, composed out of elements from the bed and elsewhere. It cannot be established, at least for the moment, who was responsible for the creation of the mirror, but Parodi's involvement can certainly be discounted for chronological reasons as well as those already stated. But given the fact that the ensemble and composition of the frame is so coherent with the decorations of the vault and coving of the Sala dell' estate (see Fig.2), it is worth considering the possibility that Gregorio De Ferrari might have been consulted in some way. Subsequent additions or alterations to the mirror can only be guessed at, but the presence of the egg-and-dart slip frame bordering the sheets of glass (Fig.9) which we have already noted as being in a French regence style not current in Genoa until about twenty-five years later than the putative date of the mirror, is fairly easy to explain, though here too the archive fails to cast any light. This is probably an addition made after Giovanni Francesco II's return from his period as ambassador in Paris in 1739 when he did much to refurbish the interior decoration of the palace. Although the payments are insufficiently specific to help in this case, one can well imagine this cosmetic alteration being made at this time to bring the mirror into line with the new requirements of fash- ion. We also know of two later occasions on which the mirror was dismantled. The first occurred in the mid-nineteenth century when the floors of the second piano nobile were relaid, and the second at the end of the 1950s when the mirror was moved to the great Salone as part of the new arrangement of the museum. It is clear from pre-War photographs that the structure of the mirror was not affected on the later occasion, but given the changing concerns of restorers one fears that during neither of these interventions would there have been much concern to document or preserve the original joinery, attachments and structural hardware. If, after this examination of its physical structure and com- plicated history, the great Brignole mirror emerges as a very different piece of furniture from the one described in the lit- erature up to now, it nevertheless remains one of the most remarkable Genoese objects of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century, and a testimony to the profound and long lasting impact of Gregorio De Ferrari as a designer.

"In one of the accounts relating to payment of silver commissioned by Anton Giulio II in 1702 and 1706, the 'Romano argentiere', that is to say Giovanni Palmieri, is referred to as 'genero di Picaluga' (ASC, BS Filza XXIV, 31st December 1702; and Filza XXV, February 1706). The goldsmith Picaluga in turn, appears in the accounts for 1716 when he repaired various items of silver together with Giovanni Battista Bozzomo.

From the beginning of the seventeenth century, that is to say from the time of Anton Giulio I (the subject of Van Dyck's celebrated equestrian portrait in the Palaz- zo Rosso) the holder of the Brignole entail had the right to augment this surname with that of the Sale family (whose last representative, Geronima, had married Anton Giulio I's father) and to use the title of marchese di Groppoli. For similar reasons the first two sons of the holder of the entail were entitled to equal shares of the inheri- tance, and it was for this reason that the Palazzo Rosso was built with two indepen- dent piani nobili, even though the death of Ridolfo I without male heirs caused the entire property to go to his surviving brother Giovanni Francesco I. After the death of Anton Guilio II the double inheritance was allocated to Giovanni Francesco II and Giovanni Giacomo, but to give the latter a greater independence from his elder brother, the Palazzo Bianco was acquired for him in 1711. At his death it was inher- ited by the third brother, Giuseppe Maria, who, on Giovanni Francesco II's death in 1760, also attempted to acquire the eldest brother's patrimony. In this he was unsuc- cessful, as Giovanni Francesco II had named the youngest brother, Ridolfo, as his universal heir, and it was from Ridolfo that the duchessa di Galliera was descended.

Chronological lists of payments relating to the Brignole bed, the silver mirror and the silver chandelier These lists are excerpted from two different sources in the Brignole-Sale archive housed in the Archivio Storico Comunale, Genoa. First, there are the account books which comprehend (almost always within the same Registro) both cartulari and manu- ali). The cartulari have numbered pages and the accounts are divided into categories, while the manuali are not foliated and expenses are listed only by dates (which can be notional); given the considerable overlap between the manuali and cartulari only the most pertinent entries are cited here. Secondly, there are the Filze, containing bills, receipts and other papers, some of which are detailed and others only schematic; these are supposed to be filed chronologically, but can appear in later files according to date of payment and are sometimes extremely random.

He impris- oned the British consul in Ethiopia and over the next three years seized several other Europeans and their families. Queen Victoria did not take this indignity lightly and in the autumn of 1867 dispatched from India an expeditionary force of more than twelve thousand men, led by Sir Robert Napier, to liberate them. After traversing nearly four hun- dred miles of difficult terrain, the army laid siege to Tewodros in his highland fortress of Maqdala. Following a brief encounter, the king committed suicide on 13th April 1868 and the fortress fell into British hands.' Tewodros had for years been collecting manuscripts and church paraphernalia from his conquered territories to donate to the church of the Saviour of the World built in his new capital at Dabra Tabor. The most valuable objects came from the churches of the old Ethiopian capital at Gondar, sacked by the king in 1854. In keeping with the antiquarian interests of the day, the British government sent out to accom- pany the expedition, with an allowance of ?1,000, Richard R. Holmes, assistant in the Department of Manuscripts of the British Museum who subsequently became Royal Librarian at Windsor. 'It was hoped that Mr. Holmes would be able to visit sites of importance, to collect antiquities, and to procure valuable manuscripts'.' This he did, selecting from Tewodros's Treasury, with the assistance of the prominent Swiss scholar and governor of Massawa, Werner Mtinzinger, some 350 Ethiopian manuscripts, making the British Library's collection thereof the best in Europe.3 Other reli- gious items, such as crosses, censers, wooden altar-tablets (tabot), chalices, priests' prayer sticks and a panel from a large tablet-woven4 curtain made of thick spun silk (Fig. 15) were also sent to the British Museum.5 The remainder of the Maqdala treasure was either sold for the benefit of non-commissioned officers and soldiers at an auction which took place on the Dalanta plain on 20th April 1868, or was looted by individual members of the expedition. Some articles were later purchased by various museums from the officers' families, but numerous objects and manuscripts still remain in private hands and it is only when they occa- * The authors are indebted to Anthony North of the Metalwork Department of the Victoria and Albert Museum for his generous assistance in identifying the probable origin and date of the guns appearing on BM1.

There, the hanging is erroneously identified as an altar- cloth, a mistake deriving from the Museum's hand-written Register of Acquisitions for 1868 where, among the objects 'obtained in Abyssinia by R.R. Holmes Esq.', it is described as an 'altar cloth of woven silk in various colours with fringe at each end [and] six sets of figures (chiefly three) down the centre: borders on each side with six single frames. L. 16ft 2, W 2ft.' Holmes apparently had the authority to purchase on behalf of the Realm whatever objects he deemed worthy of the Museum's collec- tions. 375</page></plain_text>
