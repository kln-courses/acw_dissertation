<plain_text><page sequence="1">Shelley's Unwriting of Mont Blanc Christopher Hitt Today, the critic who would tackle "Mont Blanc" must confront more than one kind of mountain. Along with the eponymous subject of the poem looms an overwhelming mountain of criticism, accumulated over the years like (to mix metaphors only slightly) snowflakes on an alpine gla- cier. We might say, borrowing another image from Shelley's poem, that the critic who ventures to write on "Mont Blanc" may well have the nag- ging sense that any new tributary to this "vast river" of ink will amount to little more than a "feeble brook."1 In recent years it has become something like a prerequisite for commentators to allude to this predicament - sometimes explicitly, but more often implicitly, by noting the poem's status as central or pivotal not only within the Shelley oeuvre but also within the discourse of Romantic or nineteenth-century studies. Thus, in a paradox Shelley might have enjoyed, the assertion of a given critical work's importance (by virtue of the poem's importance) is shadowed by the distinct possibility of its relative triviality (since so much has already been written). In opening my essay with these observations, I am, of course, attempting to stake my own claim in the debate. My direct acknowledgement of the vast mountain before me is admittedly a rhetorical gambit, a tacit assurance to the reader that this snowflake is unique - that although it may not, as in the description of the avalanche from Prometheus Unbound, loosen "some great truth" that leaves literary critics "shaken to their roots" (II.iii.37- 42), at least it will make a meaningful contribution to the critical discussion. Yet my opening is not merely strategic. My description of "Mont Blanc" as a sort of occasion for the textual sublime is also a convenient analog for the way I believe Shelley himself experienced the landscape about which he wrote. Just as critics must consider the poem in the context of a vast discur- sive network, so Shelley was cognizant of a comparable network as he viewed, contemplated, and poetically represented Mont Blanc. The speaker of the poem, after all, as he faces the alpine scene, becomes aware of a ca- cophony of voices: the Ravine of Arve is a "many-voiced vale" (13), a conduit of "ceaseless motion" and "unresting sound" (32-33), its caverns" echoing to the Arve's commotion" (30).

In my view, readers have tended to overlook or greatly underestimate the importance of this aspect of "Mont Blanc." Even those critics who have explicitly focused on the poem's intertextuality,2 or who have rightly recognized the poem's self-reflexivity - its awareness of both its internal workings and, more germane here, its situation within a larger literary and aesthetic context - have fallen short in pursuing the implications of that recognition. Not the least of these implica- tions, I shall argue, is a new perspective on one of the great conundrums in all of English literature, the famously enigmatic question with which the poem concludes: And what were thou, and earth, and stars, and sea, If to the human mind's imaginings Silence and solitude were vacancy? (142-44) My reading will thus be part formalist and part historicist. That is, in addition to reading the text closely, with attention to its thematic concerns and its rhetorical operations, I shall show how the poem demands to be understood in the larger context of literary history. A third concern, more- over, will become explicit toward the end of my essay. For I shall ultimately argue, against those critics who regard the poem as an expression of philo- sophical idealism, or who see the actual mountain as more or less irrelevant to the text,3 that "Mont Blanc" expresses a radical but redemptive skepti- cism which accepts, even embraces, the otherness of wilderness. In a sense that I shall explain, my aim is to recover - or, rather, to show that Shelley aims to recover - the mountain, the real mountain, of the poem. I. Letters from Abroad That Shelley was truly enthralled upon visiting the Alps in 1816 has been amply documented, the primary source being the poet's own firsthand account of his travels. In a series of letters (modestly revised and pub- lished the following year in a History of a Six Weeks' Tour) addressed to Thomas Love Peacock, Thomas Jefferson Hogg, and Lord Byron, sent from Geneva and dated from 15 May to 25 July, Shelley describes the region in tones often rhapsodic: "But how shall I describe to you," he asks Peacock, "the scenes by which I am now surrounded. - To exhaust epi- thets which express the astonishment &amp; the admiration - the very excess of satisfied expectation, where expectation scarcely acknowledged any boundary!?]" (I.495).4 Angela Leighton has shown how Shelley's language here and elsewhere in the Geneva letters falls clearly within the tradition of the sublime as it had developed throughout the eighteenth</page><page sequence="3">Shelley's Unwriting of "Mont Blanc" 141 century.5 Although his expressions of "astonishment" and "admiration" are conventional, and even "histrionic" at times (Leighton, 38), the feel- ings they describe are clearly genuine. Of course, as Leighton points out, few writers would have been more keenly aware than Shelley of invoking literary conventions. Thus we might posit - at this juncture, as merely a preliminary hypothesis - that even as he recognized the sublime aesthetic to be the appropriate idiom to express his wonder, he must have also found it entirely inappropriate for an experience so extraordinarily unconven- tional.6 Indeed, that dilemma is evident in the quotation above: the phrase "how shall I describe to you" plainly registers Shelley's awareness of the insufficiency of his words, as does the suggestion that whatever epithets he might offer would be quickly "exhaust [ed]." Yet even such expressions of speechlessness, as Leighton notes, were themselves standard fare in the literature of the sublime - an ironic complication that the poet must have found at once vexing and intriguing. In a similar vein, by mentioning that the scene exceeds his "expecta- tion" Shelley directs our attention to the gap between preconception and actual experience. This proves a recurrent motif in the letters, as when he writes that the scene near Mont Blanc "exceeds and renders insignificant all that I had before seen, or imagined" (L 1.494). An apparent displace- ment occurs, reminiscent of Wordsworth's description (which Shelley could not have known) in The Prelude of his own first glimpse of the mountain: That day we first Beheld the summit of Mount Blanc, and grieved To have a soulless image on the eye Which had usurped upon a living thought That never more could be. (1805, 6.453-56) Although their emotional responses are markedly different - Wordsworth "grieve[s]" whereas Shelley celebrates - both poets describe their impressions of the alpine landscape in terms of a disparity between what they had imagined and what they behold. "I never knew I never imagined what mountains were before," Shelley proceeds to comment (L 1.497). The ostensible logic here is that the mountains, perceived in their stunning immediacy for the first time, supercede and thus obviate prior conceptions. But the influence of preconception is stronger and more du- rable than Shelley would have his reader believe, even in these heightened moments. For the supposedly pure perception is always represented negatively, in terms of its difference from what it would displace. Therefore, Shelley is unable to gesture toward the real, immedi- ate presence of the mountains without summoning the ghosts of past experience - just as he cannot describe the landscape without invoking a</page><page sequence="4">142 Christopher Hitt prescribed idiom. Indeed, preconceived notions, images, and expecta- tions assert themselves most forcefully at the very moment they are being denied. This complication, I shall argue, will become the centerpiece of his poetic treatment of the same landscape. We shall need to be more specific about what these preconceptions are and where they originate. To a certain degree, they were likely shaped by Shelley's previous encounters with mountainous terrain: his travels to Scotland and Wales, and his first visit to France and Switzerland in 1814 (during which he and Mary, newly eloped, apparently tended to steer clear of the high country). A more significant and elementary source, however, must have been visual and literary mediums. Before he had ever set foot on the European continent Shelley had seen mountain scen- ery portrayed by painters such as Salvator Rosa, Caspar David Friedrich, and J. M. W. Turner; by natural historians such as Comte de Buffon and James Hutton; and by a broad range of writers from Homer to Byron. Hence he could write in some detail about alpine scenery in his own early work, as in his two "romances" Zastrozzi and the unfinished St. lrvyne, works indebted especially to the gothic novels of Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Dacre, and others.7 Shelley had also read his share of travel writing - "I too have read before now the raptures of travellers," he tells Peacock (L 1.495) - a genre still very much à la mode in Georgian England. In the "Preface" to History of a Six Weeks' Tour he alludes to its popularity by remarking that the scenes of the Alps "are now so familiar to our country- men, that few facts relating to them can be expected to have escaped the many more experienced and exact observers, who have sent their journals to the press" (V.87).8 That the Alps were likewise "familiar" to Shelley himself even before he saw them firsthand and up close is corroborated by the Geneva letters, and most clearly demonstrated by his frequent ref- erences to Rousseau's Julie; ou, La Nouvelle Héloïse. As Shelley explores the same country that provides the setting for Rousseau's novel, his habit is to see the landscape through the lens of that text: "A thousand times, thought I, have Julia and St. Preux walked on this terraced road, looking toward these mountains which I now behold" (L 1.486). In other words, Shelley routinely projects imagined scenes - here, the characters and events described in Julie - onto the real mountain scenes before him. As he had commented a few pages previously, "the imagination surely could not forbear to breathe into the most inanimate forms, some likeness of its own visions" (L I.481). In the letters, then, we see Shelley being pulled in two directions at once: on the one hand, he is awestruck by the rugged glacial terrain and seeks both to imagine and to express that awe appropriately; on the other hand, he finds it difficult to describe or even to experience the landscape except through conceptual filters which familiarize the object of perception.</page><page sequence="5">Shelley's Unwriting of "Mont Blanc" 143 I contend that this opposition, the fundamental tension between these two antipodes, emerges as the crux of "Mont Blanc." My perspective on the poem is therefore very different from the many scholars who focus only on one pole or the other. Critics have especially gravitated toward the latter, rightly noting that landscape description in "Mont Blanc" seems always to refer to more than just landscape. For example, Earl Wasserman, one of the most influential commentators on the poem, declares that its "objective ... is not merely the imaginative ascent to the sensorily inaccessible realm of Power, but the application of the imagination's vision to the world of the senses" (Shelley: A Critical Reading, 237). In an earlier study, Harold Bloom likewise sees nature in the poem as a canvas for Shelley's imaginative vision, specifi- cally his project of "mythmaking" (19-35). More recent critics have made comparable claims.9 My point of departure from these readings is the suggestion that imaginative projection is Shelley's "objective" in the poem. On the con- trary, I contend this is the very obstacle against which he struggles. After all, if the main point of "Mont Blanc" were to demonstrate the poet's fac- ulty of imaginatively investing the world with symbolic significance, it would be a rather unremarkable poem indeed in the Shelley canon. The power of "Mont Blanc" (not to mention the "Power" of Mont Blanc) is that the poet is aware of and compelled to seek that which lies beyond the circumference of the imagination despite the irresistible urge to mythologize, allegorize, or otherwise project outward.10 Shelley's encounter with an extraordinary landscape has extraordinary conse- quences: it compels him to revise his aesthetic and epistemological assumptions, as well as to compose an extraordinary poem. Confronting directly and self-consciously what he presents inchoately in the letters, he discovers that insight is generated in the gap between the mountain and "the human mind's imaginings." II. "When the Voices of the Desart Fail" I have already noted Shelley's self-consciousness about the tradition of the natural sublime. One of the few points on which critics universally agree is that "Mont Blanc" participates in, or presents itself as participating in, this aesthetic discourse. The poem also falls within the tradition of the locodescriptive poem, so popular in the eighteenth century. Furthermore, Shelley demonstrates an awareness of his own contemporaries - those writ- ers we have since taken to calling the Romantics. For example, as many scholars have pointed out, "Mont Blanc" reads somewhat like a response to Coleridge's "Chamouny; the Hour Before Sunrise. A Hymn" (1802),11 and there is at least anecdotal evidence to suggest that Shelley had the Coleridge poem in mind when he toured the Alps. Most famously, in signing the hotel</page><page sequence="6">144 Christopher Hitt register at Chamounix, Shelley identified himself as "Democrat, Philanthro- pist, and Atheist," a remark many consider an allusion to the rhetorical question Coleridge posed in his headnote to the "Hymn": "Who would be, who could be an Atheist in this valley of wonders?"12 Others focus on Shelley's debt to Wordsworth. Kenneth Neill Cameron, for example, asserts that the "Power" Shelley describes in "Mont Blanc" "pervades both mind and mat- ter, man and nature" and is thus "a concept similar" to what Wordsworth expresses in the "sense sublime" passage of "Tintern Abbey" (251). And Judith Chernaik likewise detects a "resemblance" between the two poems (48), suggesting that Shelley's poem is ultimately Wordsworthian in its "attempt to give poetic expression to the 'great whole'" (40).13 Looking be- yond Romantic poetry, commentators have asserted that passages in "Mont Blanc" allude, variously, to Plato, Homer, the Bible, Virgil, Ovid, Lucretius, Hesiod, Shakespeare, Milton, Locke, Hume, Buffon, Godwin, and William Drummond. Whether or not one finds every alleged allusion credible (I for one do not), it would be difficult to deny that Shelley's poem was profoundly shaped by his extensive reading. Indeed, we are at pains to find a single sentence that does not arguably point beyond itself to another text. No other Shelley poem, I would submit, is more densely intertextual than "Mont Blanc." The critics who have ferreted out these allusions tend to be interested in questions of influence and dissent: to whom does Shelley owe a literary or intellectual debt, and from whom does he diverge? My own interests here lie closer to the latter question; I agree, for example, with those who argue that in "Mont Blanc" Shelley invokes certain poems or passages from Coleridge and Wordsworth only to define his own ideas in opposi- tion to theirs. If, as seems likely, Shelley saw Coleridge's "Hymn" as exemplifying the "conventional Christian response to viewing Mont Blanc" (Bleasdale), then it seems certain he saw his own poem as offering an al- ternative response. However, I see the ultimate significance of the poem's intertextuality in a much broader sense: in my view, Shelley's agon con- cerns not so much a particular author, or even a particular literary, aesthetic, or mythological tradition, but the very fact of mediation. The alpine scene, filtered through a vast discursive web, is at once perfectly familiar (as text) and utterly remote (as matter). Shelley's remarks from his fragmen- tary essay "On Life" are relevant here: "The mist of familiarity obscures from us the wonder of our being. ... As men grow up, . . . they become mechanical and habitual agents. Their feelings and their reasonings are the combined result of a multitude of entangled thoughts, of a series of what are called impressions, planted by reiteration" (CW VI.195-96). The literary allusions in "Mont Blanc" thus represent the "mist" that "obscures" the "wonder" of the mountain. And so the task of the poem is to demystify, to "de-mist-ify," so that this sense of wonder might be regained.</page><page sequence="7">Shelley's Unwriting of "Mont Blanc" 145 In other words, Shelley writes the mountain only to unwrite it. This is the overall trajectory of "Mont Blanc" - its telos is "vacancy" - but it is also a recurrent trope within the poem. Its characteristic pattern is to in- troduce conventional or intertextual elements in the service of its quest for some positive truth about universe, mind, or nature. But no such truth is ever fully articulated, for whatever might be provisionally posited is inevitably reexamined, questioned, and finally left to collapse in on itself. Thus in the opening 29 lines of the poem, the many sounds of the ravine ultimately give way to a "strange sleep / Which when the voices of the desart fail / Wraps all in its own deep eternity" (27-29). For now, I want to focus on these first two lines; we shall have to defer until later our consid- eration of what exactly is yielded by this failure of voices, enigmatically described as an enveloping "deep eternity." John B. Pierce is certainly right to say that the "strange sleep" is an "image of total absence"; and I can accept, with appropriate qualifications, his contention that the pas- sage thus demonstrates an "absolute materialism" (107). But I cannot follow Pierce in his assertion that this breakdown "adds to the idea of a weakness on nature's part." Our disagreement hinges on the word "voices," used once already in the poem (in line 13). Pierce apparently assumes that the voices are generated by the landscape itself, a reading which I believe takes the poem too literally. As I have already suggested, I see these voices as emanating from the poet's own consciousness as he gazes at the scene before him. Thus the "strange sleep" marks a momen- tary cessation of the din - or, to use the phrase that Shelley had originally drafted here, a "sudden pause."14 In support of this idea, I would point out that the very language of the poem here is, like the vale it describes, "many-voiced." Not only does the poem figuratively represent the chatter Shelley hears, it also performs that chatter through its highly allusive verse. I am in agreement, for ex- ample, with those critics who hear echoes of "Tintern Abbey" in "Mont Blanc," beginning immediately with its opening lines: "The everlasting universe of things / Flows through the mind, and rolls its rapid waves," Shelley writes (1-2).15 Also arguably Wordsworthian is the poem's subse- quent assertion of an analogy between the human mind and nature, as the mental process described in the first two lines is likened to "a vast river [which] / Over its rocks ceaselessly bursts and raves" (10-11). 16 But Wordsworth is not invoked as a model to be followed.17 Rather, his is just one of the many voices Shelley hears and proceeds to echo. Lucretius is another, in the view of Jane E. Phillips (73-75); so is Byron, according to those readers who see connections to the Third Canto of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage (much of which was written that summer in Shelley's com- pany.) To this list I would propose adding another name, Shelley's friend and correspondent Thomas Peacock. Here are the opening lines of</page><page sequence="8">146 Christopher Hut Peacock's Palmyra (1807), a poem we know Shelley had read a few years prior to that Geneva summer (L 1.325): As the mountain-torrent rages, Loud, impetuous, swift, and strong, So the rapid stream of ages Rolls with ceaseless tide along. (1.1-4) This will not be the last of the noteworthy intertextual connections be- tween "Mont Blanc" and Palmyra. As the poem progresses, it becomes increasingly clear that the speaker's quest for truth involves turning to an array of voices not his own. Indeed, Shelley makes this outward turn explicit at the beginning of the third section: Some say that gleams of a remoter world Visit the soul in sleep, - that death is slumber, And that its shapes the busy thoughts outnumber Of those who wake and live. (49-52) The crucial words here, of course, are "Some say": it is an external author- ity that represents the prospective source of truth. For our purposes, this point outweighs any speculation about the particular identity of these "some," although critics have made their suggestions: Leighton assumes Wordsworth (66-67), while Hogle sees in the lines allusions to Milton, Shakespeare, and Ovid (84). Whoever they are, they are summoned only to disappear. A dash follows, emphasizing the caesura, the "sudden pause" in the line. The speaker's next words are an abrupt shift to the peak of Mont Blanc: "I look on high." And then, just as abruptly, we are returned to the voices from the previous lines, now joined by a chorus of new voices: Has some omnipotence unfurled The veil of life and death? or do I lie In dream, and does the mightier world of sleep Spread far around and inaccessibly Its circles? (53-57) According to Hogle, Plato and Hesiod inform these images (84); I would add that we hear another echo of Palmyra, for in that poem Peacock presents "Death, in solemn state unfurl'd" (1.7). Furthermore, the image of the veil is widely prevalent in Shelley's own poetry - itself a text that must certainly have echoed in his mind as he viewed the terrain around Mont Blanc.18</page><page sequence="9">Shelley's Unwriting of "Mont Blanc" 147 But these echoes too fade away as quickly as they had emerged. An- other collapse immediately follows - "For the very spirit fails" - recalling that earlier failure, "when the voices of the desart fail." The questions posed are left unanswered, the possibilities raised never to be revisited. Instead, new questions take their place: Is this the scene Where the old Earthquake-daemon taught her young Ruin? Were these their toys? or did a sea Of fire, envelop once this silent snow? (71-74) Pondering the origin or prehistory of the mountains that surround him, the speaker invokes both mythology ("daemon") and perhaps contempo- rary geology. In so doing he unleashes, to judge by critical commentary on the passage, a Babel din of allusions: Byron, the Bible, Heraclitus, Virgil, Vico, and a bevy of scientists including Georges Cuvier, James Hutton, and James Parkinson are all proposed as potential sources here.19 Many scholars read these lines in the context of two references Shelley makes in a letter to Peacock: the first to "Buffons [sic] sublime but gloomy theory" as Shelley knew it from Histoire Naturelle (1749), the second to "Ahriman," or Ahrimanes, the spirit of evil in ancient Persian cosmology and the subject of a fragmentary poem by Peacock (L I.499).20 Buffon, however, specifically called into question the belief "that all the moun- tains have been formed by earthquakes, or by the explosions of volcanoes" (II.62).21 A more relevant name might be the English naturalist John Ray, whom Buffon singles out as a proponent of that misguided theory.22 Shelley was undoubtedly familiar with Ray's influential The Wis- dom of God Manifested in Creation (1691), a manifesto of proto-deistic thinking (as its title implies) framed in part as a refutation of Shelley's beloved Lucretius.23 Thus it seems at least possible that Shelley associated earthquake- and fire-based theories of mountain formation with deism, a paradigm so inimical to Shelley and to "Mont Blanc" in particular. Shelley's tendency, after all, is to invoke voices only to expose them as utterly inadequate in the face of the mountain's inscrutability. Finally, in addition to this vast web of possible allusions, we should note a verbal echo of these lines from Charlotte Smith's 1807 poem Beachy Head: Does Nature then Mimic, in wanton mood, fantastic shapes Of bivalves, and inwreathed volutes, that cling To the dark sea-rock of the wat'ry world? Or did this range of chalky mountains, once</page><page sequence="10">148 Christopher Hitt Form a vast basin, where the Ocean waves Swell'd fathomless? (378-84) Smith's passage mirrors Shelley's both syntactically and thematically: like the speaker of "Mont Blanc," the speaker of Beachy Head turns from viewing the sublime landscape to contemplating its sublime geological mysteries.24 However, Shelley's poem diverges from Smith's by abruptly refusing to answer these questions: "None can reply," he continues (75). Once again, the speaker is led to a dead end. Steadfastly refusing to confirm or deny the speaker's musings about it, the landscape yields only a blank. The voices have failed yet again, leaving the speaker staring at a vacancy. III. The Mysterious Tongue of the Wilderness As I shall go on to suggest, the pattern described here will recur at least twice more during the remainder of "Mont Blanc." First, however, we shall want to pause over the passage that follows this blank, so crucial it is to the poem. "None can reply - all seems eternal now," Shelley writes. We cannot miss a parallel between this line and the earlier passage in which "strange sleep" yields "deep eternity," occurring just "when the voices of the desart fail." In both instances the poem pivots toward what seems to offer (judging by the connotation of the words "eternal" and "eternity") illumination or revelation. But whereas in the earlier instance that sense of revelation is left entirely undefined, now the poem will proceed to develop it: The wilderness has a mysterious tongue Which teaches awful doubt, or faith so mild, So solemn, so serene, that man may be But for such faith with nature reconciled, Thou hast a voice, great Mountain, to repeal Large codes of fraud and woe; not understood By all, but which the wise, and great, and good Interpret, or make felt, or deeply feel. (76-83) The first thing we should notice here is that the many "voices" of the land- scape have been supplanted by a single "voice," a "mysterious tongue," ascribed to Mont Blanc and to the surrounding wilderness. And in con- trast to the earlier voices, this voice seems capable of communicating something meaningful - a significant advance in the poem. Shelley seems to imply that the vacancy left by the collapse of textuality is the necessary precondition for insight. The nature or content of this insight, however, is still uncertain. Although the possibility of "reconciliation]" with nature appears central to this lesson, Shelley's wording vexes clear paraphrase.</page><page sequence="11">Shelley's Unwriting of "Mont Blanc" 149 "[A]wful doubt, or faith so mild" sounds equivocal, if not contradictory, and the phrase "But for such faith" is notoriously ambiguous.25 The re- mainder of the passage does little to clarify these uncertainties. Shelley does not articulate what the mountain says, but merely states that its voice "repeals" or negates oppressive "codes." What it says is left unspecified, just as the lesson of the "mysterious tongue" is left mysterious. I do not propose to decipher this riddle, for to do so would be to fill in the blank upon which Shelley insists. The voice of the mountain, he im- plies, is mute - it makes no positive assertion and has no determinate meaning. Thus its content can be described only negatively, and its conse- quences presented only as contingencies, possibilities, never as certainties. As Shelley says of the landscape in the Peacock letter, "it exceeds and renders insignificant all that I had before seen, or imagined." The lines above seem a reformulation of that statement. In both cases wilderness is presented in negative terms, defined by what is exceeded or displaced, or "repeal[ed]" to use the language of the poem. In this sense, both state- ments are illuminated by Shelley's claim in Essay on Christianity that the "universal Being can only be described or defined by negatives. . . . Where indefiniteness ends idolatry and anthropomorphism begin" (VI.232).26 That second sentence is especially significant here, as Shelley gestures toward the implications of such negative description. While the letter to Peacock registers no such awareness, "Mont Blanc" does, by hinting that the mountain's voice must be left indefinite lest it be reified, reintegrated into the imaginative and discursive structures it should exceed. "The deep truth is imageless," Demogorgon says in Prometheus Unbound (II.iv.116) - and so, apparently, is "the deep eternity" glimpsed on Mont Blanc. There is another important (and related) difference between the epis- tolary and poetic versions of Shelley's statement. In the letters, Shelley's explicit focus is on the new image or idea that has supposedly displaced the old one. In "Mont Blanc," by contrast, he focuses on the very fact of displacement. Put another way, he seems to realize that the significance of this experience lies precisely in its opening up of a vacancy. This is the same realization he would articulate in "On Life," referring to the "intel- lectual philosophy": "It establishes no new truth," he writes, but rather "destroys error, and the roots of error. It leaves, what is too often the duty of the reformer in political and ethical questions to leave, a vacancy. It reduces the mind to that freedom in which it would have acted but for the misuse of words and signs, the instruments of its own creation (CW VI.195). We remember that elsewhere in the same essay Shelley refers to a "mist of familiarity," a "multitude of entangled thoughts" which obscures the "won- der" of the world. So "familiarity," "thoughts," and "words and signs" are, like the "Large codes of fraud and woe," the "roots of error" which structure, codify, and constrict our experience. What Shelley suggests here</page><page sequence="12">150 Christopher Hitt and in "Mont Blanc" is that "vacancy" is the key to rediscovering "won- der," or to behaving ethically. The errant alternative is to establish a "new truth" and thus to replace one word, image, or code with another. Although the last phrase in the above passage suggests that "words and signs" are ultimately produced in individual minds, we should not infer that Shelley therefore subscribed to the (solipsistic) view that lan- guage is monologic, a closed system existing independently of the social realm. As he makes abundantly clear throughout his prose and poetry, he was well aware that individual minds are influenced by others - and es- pecially by their words. Likewise, the "Large codes" of "Mont Blanc" clearly originate on a social level, even as people conform to them on an individual level (much like Blake's "mind forg'd manacles"). Hugo Donnelly addresses this point in a fine essay on "Mont Blanc," arguing that "the plural 'codes' takes in not only theological speculation but also ... the ontological assertions of rational discourse, whereby human lim- its are circumscribed by 'public' language" (579). In Donnelly's account, the poem thus reflects Shelley's "deepening distrust of the limitations and the ideological coloring of language in normative social discourses" (573). I linger on this point in part to emphasize how this key passage in "Mont Blanc" relates to my overall argument. The "voices" Shelley hears in the landscape are of course his own projections, but as snippets of public dis- course their origin is external, and usually textual. The voices and the codes are part of the same restrictive framework. But the division between public discourse and private language (porous though it may be) is relevant here for another reason. For as I have suggested earlier, one of Shelley's challenges in "Mont Blanc" is to find his own poetic voice amidst the chatter of others' voices - to repre- sent his experience of the mountain without lapsing into conventional and formulaic language. That task is especially difficult given the dispropor- tionate number of literary and artistic representations of this particular landscape, which is "familiar" to Shelley even before he sees it for him- self. On the other hand, it is at the same time radically unfamiliar, overwhelming, disorienting. "[W]hen the voices of the desart fail" we are left with nothing but our own blank consciousness and the blank world before us. "We are," as Shelley writes in "On Life," "on that verge where words abandon us, and what wonder if we grow dizzy to look down the dark abyss of - how little we know" (CW VI.196). I believe it is this expe- rience he has in mind in the second section of "Mont Blanc": Dizzy Ravine! and when I gaze on thee I seem as in a trance sublime and strange To muse on my own separate phantasy, My own, my human mind, which passively</page><page sequence="13">Shelley's Unwriting of "Mont Blanc" 151 Now renders and receives fast influencings, Holding an unremitting interchange With the clear universe of things around[.] (34-40) Here Shelley is explicit in identifying the "influencings" as coming from "the clear universe of things." They are not the "influencings" of public discourse, as the emphatic "my own separate phantasy, / My own, my human mind" makes unmistakable. That chatter has subsided - words have abandoned him - leaving the "universe of things" finally "clear," or vacant. Succeeding the "voices of the desart" passage by only a few lines, this passage should be read as a restatement of the same idea. Here are the lines in their proper order: the strange sleep Which when the voices of the desart fail Wraps all in its own eternity; - Thy caverns echoing to the Arve's commotion, A loud, lone sound no other sound can tame; Thou art pervaded with that ceaseless motion, Thou art the path of that unresting sound - Dizzy Ravine! and when I gaze on thee I seem as in a trance sublime and strange . . . (27-35) Just as the "strange sleep" had earlier replaced the "old and solemn har- mony" of the landscape (24), here the pervasive "commotion" of the Arve gives way to a "strange" "trance." There seems to be no similar precedent in the poem for Shelley's intro- duction of a mysterious "loud, lone sound" (later "that unresting sound") which drowns out the din of "other sound[s]." The figure is initially unclear, but in retrospect it seems another expression of what Shelley will later call the voice of the mountain and the "mysterious tongue" of the wilderness.27 The main difference is that, at this early stage in the poem, the speaker does not fully articulate (or perhaps even fully realize) the power of the "lone sound." Rather than claiming that it can "repeal / Large codes," he suggests instead that it incites poetry: the speaker, still in his "trance," visits the still cave of the witch Poesy, Seeking among the shadows that pass by Ghosts of all things that are, some shade of thee. (44-46) In these "strange," visionary moments, the poet is inspired to seek his own voice.28 And because for Shelley poetry and ethics are intertwined, we are in fact not as far from the doctrine of the "mysterious tongue" as</page><page sequence="14">152 Christopher Hitt might first seem. But poetry is ultimately only a secondary concern in "Mont Blanc." As we shall see, Shelley will place his emphasis elsewhere as the poem progresses. Immediately after the "mysterious tongue" passage, Shelley reverts to the conventional and intertextual language we have so often seen in the poem. The catalog with which the next section begins - The fields, the lakes, the forests, and the streams, Ocean, and all the living things that dwell within the daedal earth; lightning, and rain, Earthquake, and fiery flood, and hurricane (84-87) - seems part "Tintern Abbey," part standard imagery of the sublime from eighteenth-century aesthetic discourse. The first dozen or so lines of this fourth section of the poem are rife with such allusive language29; then, as has been the pattern of the poem, voices dissolve into vacancy: Power dwells apart in its tranquillity Remote, serene, and inaccessible: And this, the naked countenance of earth, On which I gaze, even these primaeval mountains Teach the adverting mind (96-100) The most obvious marker of blankness here is the adjective "naked," by which Shelley emphasizes the barren emptiness of the scene before him. However, we should note that a certain emptiness is also conveyed by the deictic pronoun "this." Since the word does not represent but merely points, it is devoid of any positive content of its own. The same is true for "that" (43) and "there" (48, 127), words which likewise emerge in the poem at those moments when voices fail.30 Deictic language is often (like the voice of the mountain) ambiguous - indeed, notoriously so in "Mont Blanc" - and is meaningful only in terms of that to which it points. In this sense it is analogous to negation, which is meaningful only in terms of what it points away from. Both draw our attention to language's limita- tions: they are markers of ineffability, of "that verge where words abandon us." This abyss is the locus of Power. Following this passage, voices again return to fill the void. One of the more noteworthy of the many literary allusions critics have noticed in this section of the poem is a series of strong verbal echoes between lines 120-125 of "Mont Blanc" and Coleridge's "Kubla Khan," a poem not published in August 1816 but, Desmond King-Hele speculates, conceivably known to Shelley by way of recitations by Byron (71). Rather than focusing on the poem's intertextuality, however, I want to pause to consider the significance</page><page sequence="15">Shelley's Unwriting of "Mont Blanc" 153 of these relapses given that the poet has now located Power, that he has heard the voice of the mountain and understands its capacity to "teach." Does the recurrent resumption of the voices therefore signal an equivoca- tion, perhaps a loss of faith in the voice of the mountain? I believe it does not, though it certainly does acknowledge the difficulty of maintaining the "strange sleep" for very long. Except in those rare moments of illumination, moments which cannot last, the familiar external voices exert a strong influ- ence on consciousness. Nevertheless, as we enter the fifth and final section of the poem, there is evidence that the speaker's confidence in the power of the mountain over these external voices has deepened. "[T]he power is there," he writes, gesturing to the peak of Mont Blanc, "The still and solemn power of many sights, / And many sounds, and much of life and death" (127-29). The first "of" here (following "power") is nearly as tricky as the "But for" we saw earlier. At first glance the lines seem (oddly) to ascribe power to the "many sounds" and so on. However, it is also possible to read the lines as stating that these human affairs fall within the jurisdiction of the mountain's power (with "of" used in the same sense as in the phrase "the ruler of Mongolia"). Although the ambiguity is probably deliberate - a familiar Shelleyan maneuver - it must be emphasized that the first interpretation would run counter to everything the poem has thus far asserted. Conversely, the latter interpretation would express a renewed affirmation that the pow- erful voice of the mountain is the "loud, lone sound" that can "tame" all "other sound[s]." Such a reading is also consistent with the poem's penultimate state- ment: The secret strength of things Which governs thought, and to the infinite dome Of heaven is as a law, inhabits thee! (139-141) The speaker of the poem has at last come to the realization that "thought," whether that of his "own . . . human mind" or of human minds gener- ally, is ultimately subject to the power of "things," to the "secret strength" they wield. This is the same idea Shelley obliquely implies in his letters to Peacock: that the physical landscape as raw, brute matter has primacy over others' voices and indeed over the speaker's own "imaginings." There is a complication, however. For the poem has al- ready warned that to utter a truth is to hypostatize it, and thus to fill vacancy with a new dogma. Accordingly, "Mont Blanc" cannot end with such an emphatic declaration. Shelley will instead conclude with an open-ended musing that, although it follows logically from that asser- tion, destabilizes whatever firm foundation of truth we might have been tempted to find there:</page><page sequence="16">154 Christopher Hitt And what were thou, and earth, and stars, and sea, If to the human mind's imaginings Silence and solitude were vacancy? The question is unanswered, unanswerable, ambiguous, and obscure - and perfectly consistent with the rest of the poem. IV. "Silence and Solitude" as Vacancy Ever since the original publication of "Mont Blanc" in 1817, readers have been perplexed by the poem's ending. Harold Bloom called these lines "much disputed" in his 1959 study Shelley's Mythmaking (34), and despite the wealth of critical attention the poem has received in the nearly half century since, our sense is that his words still ring true today. However, a reader encountering the poem in the first Norton Critical edition of Shelley's Poetry and Prose, published in 1977, might have reasonably sup- posed that the mystery had been solved. Editors Donald Reiman and Sharon Powers provide the following explanatory footnote: The very power of imagination to realize the nature of Power, so remote and foreign to all mortal experience, illustrates the supremacy of that imagination over the silence and solitude that threaten it. The poet is equal to Mont Blanc, for though the amoral Power can destroy him, only he can comprehend its meaning. (93, n.3) This gloss, consistent with the readings of such influential commentators as Bloom, Charles Vivian, Earl Wasserman, and Judith Chernaik,31 re- flected the prevailing current of critical opinion in 1977. And although Reiman and new co-editor Neil Fraistat have excised the footnote from the recently published second edition, this current seems still to prevail: most commentators on "Mont Blanc" see its closing lines as an expression (whether triumphant or muted) of the power of the creative imagination, usually over and against nature. To cite just one of many more recent ex- amples, Paul Endo declares that "Shelley's rhetorical question transmutes silence and vacancy into the human mind's imaginings without hesita- tion, without pause for self-doubt. Indefiniteness ends, yielding to the self-idolatry of the egotistical sublime" (296).32 There are dissenters, to be sure, but the vast majority of critics under- stand the lines according to the basic premises of these readings. Much of the "dispute" in fact revolves around subtle shades of meaning - questions of emphasis, degree, implications, and so forth - and can have the appearance of hairsplitting. The few critics who clearly reject this reading of the poem's conclusion tend not, unfortunately, to offer specific</page><page sequence="17">Shelley's Unwriting of "Mont Blanc" 155 readings in support of their alternative, usually because they are busy pursuing other agendas.33 Such is the case, for example, with Mary Jacobus's intriguing paraphrase of Shelley's question: "What if moun- tains really refuse the subjectivity that so powerfully projects its own apotheosis on to them?" (8). Jacobus makes that comment in passing, in a book not on Shelley but on Wordsworth. In the remainder of this essay, then, I shall make my own case for a new way of understanding Shelley's famous lines. The crucial phrase in Shelley's question is "silence and solitude." A clue to its significance is offered by the fact that as we read the poem's conclusion, the word "silence" is still reverberating in our ears. Shelley had used the word twice a mere eight lines earlier: "Winds contend / Silently there, and heap the snow with breath / Rapid and strong, but silently!" (134-36). These lines, in turn, point us back to Coleridge's "Hymn," as Jonathan Wordsworth among others has noticed (106-7). In that poem Coleridge, like Shelley, uses a form of the word "silence" twice within the space of two lines: "thou, dread mountain form, / Risest from forth thy silent sea of pines / How silently!" (4-6). In "Mont Blanc," then, "silence" appears to mark the presence of others' voices. The irony, of course, is that the word denotes precisely the absence of voices, the ab- sence of sound. Indeed, the word "silence" encapsulates the central paradox Shelley confronts in "Mont Blanc." On the one hand, it is an apt metaphor for the mountain's capacity to exceed the chatter of words that would purport to describe it. On the other hand, the word was a staple in sublime poetry and aesthetic discourse, a shopworn emblem of ineff abil- ity. Endo himself makes this very point: "For Shelley and 'Mont Blanc,' the received interpretation of silence, the accepted conversion of pre- meaning into meaning, had long since hardened into the formulaic: the silence of nature, that is, invariably gave voice to the majesty of God" (287). We find a noteworthy illustration in James Thomson's The Seasons (1744) - significantly, the final line of his "Hymn" which follows Winter and with which the poem concludes: "Come then, expressive Silence, muse HIS Praise" (118).34 "Solitude" is another word that was strongly associated with the experience of the sublime. My contention about "silence and solitude," however, is more pointed: it is precisely these two words in combination that had become a virtual cliché by 1816, a stock phrase used liberally throughout the eighteenth century and into the nineteenth to signify sublimity. Shelley uses the phrase at least twice elsewhere in his own writing, once in the unpublished sonnet "To Laughter," scrawled in the same notebook as an alternate version of "Mont Blanc,"35 and once in his adolescent (and derivative) novel St. lrvyne. In the latter, the main charac- ter Wolfstein has retreated to his cave in the mountains and reflects "in</page><page sequence="18">156 Christopher Hitt solitude and silence" on his life "in the wild and trackless deserts of the Alps" (CW V.113). The sentence evokes Radcliffe, whose gothic romances Shelley certainly had in mind as he wrote St. Irvyne; and indeed Radcliffe uses the words "silence" and "solitude" in close proximity at least seven times, by my count, in her novels. For example, in the opening chapter of The Mysteries of Udolpho she presents her heroine Emily marveling at "the mountain's stupendous recesses, where the silence and grandeur of soli- tude impressed a sacred awe upon her heart, and lifted her thoughts to the GOD OF HEAVEN AND EARTH" (6; italics mine). The precise phrase "silence and solitude" occurs three times in that novel, always in the con- text of sublime affect (206, 260, 319). In The Romance of the Forest we find the similar phrases "solitude and silence" and "the deep silence of soli- tude" used to the same end (11.48 and III.88). But so prevalent is the phrase in eighteenth-century literature of the sublime that we cannot possibly identify any one specific text or author as Shelley's "source." It would be more accurate, and would better convey the utter conventionality of the phrase, to observe that "silence and solitude" were simply in the air. We have no direct evidence, for example, that Shelley had read Burke's Philosophical Enquiry on the sublime (1759), but regardless, that well-known treatise influenced subsequent literary representations of the sublime and consequently informed Shelley's work at least indirectly. Burke identifies "solitude, and silence" as among the "privation[s]" that "bring about feelings of the sublime" (71). Hugh Blair would echo Burke in his Lectures on rhetoric and belles lettres (1783), writing that "the hoary moun- tain, and the solitary lake; the aged forest, and the torrent falling over the rock" are sublime because they evoke ideas "such as darkness, solitude, and silence" (214). Nor do we have any evidence that Shelley had read Smollett's popular adventure novel The Expedition of Humphry Clinker (1771), but we find the phrase there too.36 Smollett's main epistolary narrator, Matthew Bramble, comments upon seeing the Highlands of Scotland: "This country is amazingly wild, especially towards the mountains, which are heaped upon the backs of one another, making a most stupendous appearance of savage nature, with hardly any signs of cultivation, or even of population. All is sublimity, silence, and solitude" (244; my italics). Similarly, in his Journey to the Western Isles of Scotland (1775), Samuel Johnson makes a nearly identical re- mark about the same "mountainous and wild" landscape: "all was rudeness, silence, and solitude," he writes (31). The phrase appears in inverted form ("Solitude and Silence") in James Beattie's 1760 poem The Triumph of Melan- choly; it is verbatim in Anna Barbauld's 1773 essay "On Monastic Institutions" (211), in Sidney Owenson's 1807 The Lay of the Irish Harp, and in Mary Tighe's 1811 poem Psyche.37 Again, to conjecture upon particular influence seems pointless given the ubiquity of the phrase. Still, it is worth noting that "silence and</page><page sequence="19">Shelley's Unwriting of "Mont Blanc" 157 solitude" appears in at least six works which we specifically know (from lists kept by Mary and from references in letters) Shelley to have read. The phrase is verbatim in three of these - Matthew Lewis's The Monk (1796), Walter Scott's Waverley (1814), and Peacock's Palmyra - and approximate in the other three: Thomson's The Castle of Indolence (1748) has "solitude and perfect silence," Rousseau's Confessions (1782) has it verbatim but of course in French ("le silence et la solitude"), and Owenson's O'Donnel: A National Tale (1814) renders it as "silent solitudes."38 Always the phrase is used to describe the characteristics associated with the sublime: moments of dread or pathos (Thomson, Lewis), natural scenes such as mountains (Scott) and a "turbulent ocean" (Owenson), and gothic imagery including ruins (Rousseau, Owenson, Peacock) and a dungeon (Lewis). There is, finally, an echo of the phrase in Rousseau's Julie, the book that weighed so heavily on Shelley's mind as he composed "Mont Blanc." St. Preux writes to Julie: "J'entre avec une secrète horreur dans ce vaste désert du monde. Ce chaos ne m'offre qu'une solitude affreuse où règne un morne silence" ("I enter with a secret horror into this vast desert of the world. This chaos presents me with nothing but horrible solitude, wherein reigns a dull silence") (190; italics mine).39 Although far from exhaustive, this survey should suffice to make the point. We should recall, too, that Shelley had by all accounts an uncanny verbal memory. And he was acutely aware of the tendency of language to congeal, to become stale with overuse. As he writes in Speculations on Metaphysics: "We combine words, combined a thousand times before. . . . Our whole style of expression and sentiment is infected with the tritest plagiarisms. Our words are dead, our thoughts are cold and borrowed" (CW VII.62). Shelley would repeat this observation in the Defence of Poetry, remarking that "words become through time signs for portions or classes of thoughts instead of pictures of integral thoughts," which renders lan- guage "dead to all the nobler purposes of human intercourse" (CW VII.lll). In light of these observations, I submit that the "silence and soli- tude" of the poem's concluding line alludes to what Shelley saw as an outdated idiom, a prescriptive and formulaic mode of experiencing the wild landscape. Read in this way, the question at the end of the poem takes on a very different meaning: What would the mountain be if, in- stead of imagining it in terms of such cold, dead language, we could experience it freely, as a "vacancy"? What if "the mist of familiarity" did not obscure "from us the wonder of our being"? For the reasons already stated, Shelley's question cannot be posi- tively answered. However, his implication is now clear: To hear the pure voice of the mountain (rather than the many voices that would prepack- age the mountain for us), to stare down the abyss of "how little we know," would be to discover a world we had not seen before. Having unwritten</page><page sequence="20">158 Christopher Hitt the mountain as text, Shelley leaves us with only a vacancy and an invita- tion to consider nature through that vacancy - as nothing but solid, inert matter, "the naked countenance of earth." Indeed, nature is all that is left at the end of the poem, along with the speaker's sense of mute, blank wonder. And as Shelley has already asserted, this experience of blankness has a practical benefit: it "teach[es]" us to avoid "fraud and woe," that is, to behave ethically. Critics have shown how the ethics of "Mont Blanc" are potentially far-reaching: Donnelly, for example, convincingly reads the poem as a broad critique of "rational discourse." Yet to understand the poem only in those terms would be to allegorize the mountain, to con- vert it into a mere symbol of human affairs. Since, as I have argued, the poem inveighs against precisely that impulse, I would insist that we must include Shelley's primary subject, sublime wilderness, within its ethical agenda. By implying that human thought (the epistemological uncer- tainty and contingency of consciousness, of one's "own separate phantasy") is, in an important sense, subordinate to material nature (the ontological autonomy of solid rock), by reminding us that mountains are after all independent of minds, Shelley's poem reflects what we might even be tempted to call, in hindsight, an incipient environmental ethic.40 If Shelley's ethics depend on repealing the discursive codes that ob- scure the world, on replacing "silence and solitude" with vacancy, then it is highly significant that the mountain itself has the capacity to repeal these codes. Or as Shelley puts it in a fragmentary line from his working notebook, "The wilderness has a mysterious tongue / And teaches doubts - of all that words of-" (Brinkley, 259). That is to say, it is the unsettling, unfathomable mystery of wilderness that prompts us to doubt the comfort and familiarity of words. The very blankness of Mont Blanc jolts the viewer into blankness: its opacity and recalcitrance ("remote, serene, and inaccessible") undermine our complacency and restore the freshness of the world. Thus, Shelley makes the same ambitious claim about nature that he makes about poetry in the Defence. Like a great poem, a mountain like Mont Blanc is not merely valuable intrinsically. It is also valuable because it has the power to change us and our relationship to the world.

In addition to the many critical sources which identify specific writers as influences on Shelley, two are especially noteworthy here in that they share my interest in the role of intertextuality per se. The first, chronologically, is Hogle's important 1988 study Shelley's Process: Radical Transference and the Development of His Major Works, a work unparalleled in the sheer number of allusions it claims to find in Shelley generally and in "Mont Blanc" in particular. While these allusions sometimes seem strained, Hogle's discussion of the poem as a "primal clinamen," a site of the dialectical interplay of competing textual authorities, is both compel- ling and relevant to my reading of the poem. For Hogle, however, the "darting from one [textual authority] to the next in a half-playful, half-serious dance among difference codes" (85) is precisely the point of the poem: this kind of "radi- cal transference," he argues, destabilizes dominant truth structures by constantly shifting their ground from one assumption to the next before any one of them can assume mastery. Therefore - contrary to what I argue in this essay - Hogle un- derstands allusive language as the site of a new order of meaning. This premise is shared by the second study, Stuart Peterfreund's recent Shelley among Others: The Play of the Intertext and the Idea of Language, published in 2002. Peterfreund builds upon Hogle's notion of "transferential" language by considering it in the context of Shelley's theory of poetic language. In his account, Shelley engages other poets in intertextual "conversation" in order to participate in a mode of language that seeks to "mov[e] beyond historical contingency if not beyond temporality out- right" (24). Although Peterfreund has a well-deserved reputation as an erudite and intelligent Shelley scholar, I must confess that I don't find his book particu- larly persuasive. In any case, my argument has little in common with Peterfreund 's aside from its focus on intertextuality 3. 1 shall confront these critical commonplaces later in my essay, most directly in my discussion of the poem's closing lines; see also notes 31 and 32 below. For now, suffice it to say that the majority of critics discuss "Mont Blanc" within the theoretical framework Earl Wasserman describes in his important early essay in The Subtler Language (1959). Wasserman argues that Shelley's poem reflects a ten- sion between "the materialistic and the subjectively idealistic extremes" (201). These extremes, he goes on to suggest, need not be mutually exclusive: "both positions are tenable if one assumes that the only knowable reality is the body of mental impressions and yet that an unknowable external something is respon- sible for these impressions" (202). I am largely in agreement with Wasserman up to this point, though I don't share his idea that precisely this tension (as he de- scribes it) is the central thematic concern of the poem. However, like so many critics since, Wasserman proceeds to read "Mont Blanc" as ultimately privileging the operations of the human mind over the materiality of nature (see especially 237-40), and this is my main point of disagreement. Stated in these broad terms, this view of the poem is applicable even to many critics not explicitly interested in the issue of "idealism," or indeed who reject its importance outright; see, for example, Bloom, 28-30; Spencer Hall, "Shelley's 'Mont Blanc'" (Studies in Philol- ogy 70 [1973]: 199-221); John Rieder, "Shelley's 'Mont Blanc': Landscape and the Ideology of the Sacred Text" (ELH 48.4[1981]: 778-98); Hogle, 85-86 and 354, n.24; and Jonathan Wordsworth, especially 102-03.</page><page sequence="22">160 Christopher Hitt 4. This and all quotations from Shelley's letters are taken from Jones, The Letters of Percy Bysshe Shelley, hereafter cited in the text as L. 5. See especially Leighton, 36-47. 6. Leighton offers a somewhat different assessment of Shelley's use of traditional sublime language. In her account, Shelley is torn between his attraction "to an aes- thetic which idealises the immaterial and numinous properties of the landscape" and his aversion to its conventional association with the divine. Ultimately, she argues, Shelley embraces a skeptical rather than a religious sublime whose locus of "power" is not God but "vacancy." In this aesthetic mode he finds an early expres- sion of the theory of inspiration he will later formulate in the Defence of Poetry. 7. The fact that Radcliffe had not actually visited the rugged landscapes she so colorfully portrays in A Sicilian Romance, The Romance of the Forest, and The Mys- teries of Udolpho (all three were penned before her first trip to the Continent in 1794) is consistent with my point that literary representations of nature often tell us at least as much about an author's reading as about her attention to empirical detail. See Duprée's introduction to Udolpho, viii. 8. In Ingpen and Peck, The Complete Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley, subsequently cited in text as CW. All Shelley prose (other than the letters) quoted here comes from this source. 9. For example, Stuart Peterfreund sees in the poem's frequent allusions to ancient myth a characteristic "temptation to allegorize" (125); and John Bleasdale writes that "Mont Blanc" reflects "Shelley's boldness in projecting his mind onto the landscape." 10. In this respect my argument approaches that of Frances Ferguson, who ob- serves that "[a]t moments Shelley seems almost defiantly trying to think of the mountain ... as a brute physical existence" instead of a famous landmark in- vested with historical, social, and otherwise symbolical significance (202-3). In Ferguson's account, however, this impulse fails utterly and completely: the speaker cannot resist anthropomorphizing the mountain, in part as a defensive gesture against the "apparent threat . . . that man (and mind) might be reduced to mere matter" (213). As I shall explain, my view is that Shelley makes a point of dodging the question of success or failure: whether Shelley is able (in Ferguson's words) "to let Mont Blanc be merely a blank" (204) is left unresolved. The poem's significance lies rather in its very hypothesis of a blank, of an inaccessible materi- ality that exceeds human thought and language. 11. See, for example, Bloom, 11-19; and Ronald Tetreault (The Poetry of Life: Shelley and Literary Form [Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1987]), 67-69. 12. Among the many accounts of this episode, see Richard Holmes, Shelley: The Pursuit (London: Weidenfeld, 1974), 339-43; Timothy Webb, Shelley: A Voice Not Understood (Atlantic Highlands, N.J.: Humanities Press, 1977), 140^42; and Leighton, 59-60. 13. The most extensive study of the relationship between Wordsworth s and Shelley's verse is G. Kim Blank's aptly titled Wordsworth's Influence on Shelley: A Study of Poetic Authority (New York: St. Martin's, 1988); see especially 175-182. 14.

Wordsworth's most famous expression of an analogy between mind and nature is in his "Prospectus" to The Excursion (1814), which the Shelleys owned (see "Shelley's Reading," Appendix VIII to The Letters of Percy Bysshe Shelley, Vol. II, 467-88; subsequent references to books in the Shelleys' library will reference this list with the appropriate page number, unless otherwise indicated). Wordsworth writes: "How exquisitely the individual Mind ... to the external World / Is fitted: - and how exquisitely, too ... The external World is fitted to the Mind" (63-68; line numbers refer to the poem as it appeared in the original 1814 edition of The Excursion). Ferguson alludes to Wordsworth's statement in her dis- cussion of the opening section of "Mont Blanc" (204). 17. In other words, allusion need not signal influence. My sense of what Shelley is doing here is not far from Blank's contention that "the opening section of 'Mont Blanc' is a sort of parody of Wordsworth's model of the Man-Nature relationship" as Shelley understood it (175). As Leighton writes, "it is useful to look at [Shelley's] debt [to Wordsworth and Coleridge] as one of dissent rather than imitation" (49). 18. Indeed, we should not overlook that passages from "Mont Blanc" often seem to echo Shelley's own earlier writing. A good example, cited by a number of critics, is the passage from Speculations on Metaphysics in which Shelley compares thought to a "river whose rapid and perpetual stream flows outward" (CW VII.64). 19. See Hogle, 84 and 356, n.43 and n.44; Peterfreund, 127-28 and 346, n.41^5; Nigel Leask, "Mont Blanc's Mysterious Voice: Shelley and Huttonian Earth Sci- ence" (The Third Culture: Literature and Science, Ed. Elinor S. Shaffer [New York: de Gruyter, 1998]: 182-203); and Duncan Wu's footnote to the poem in Romanticism: An Anthology, 2nd. ed. (Oxford: Blackwell, 1998), 847, n.17. 20. Although it is tempting to see the "Earthquake-daemon" as a direct refer- ence to Ahrimanes, the connection is somewhat tenuous. Although the Zoroastrian deity was associated with destructive natural forces, he was also childless and gendered male. If Shelley did have Ahrimanes in mind here, he may also have had in mind (in addition to Peacock) the historian Edward Gibbon, whose The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire he knew well and referred to fre- quently in letters (see "Shelley's Reading," L 11.474-75). In his discussion of Persian mythology and religion, Gibbon writes that ever since the unleashing of Ahrimanes upon the world, "deluges, earthquakes, and conflagrations, attest the conflict of Nature" (The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire [New York: Modern Library, 1932], 1.173). Byron also features the deity as a minor character in Manfred, describing him in similar terms: "He moveth - Earthquakes rend the world asunder" (II.iv.8). Manfred, however, was not composed until 1817. 21. Hogle thus seems to make a factual error in including Buff on among those who "base the growth of earth-forms on a series of cataclysmic earthquakes forcing mountains out of the ground" (84). For a thorough discussion of "Mont Blanc" in the context of eighteenth-century geological theory, see Leask (cited in n.19 above). 22. See 9-13 of Ray's Three Physico-Theological Discourses, 4th ed. (London: William and John Innys, 1721). Ray explains: "When I say, that this Mountain was raised by an Earthquake, I do not mean, that the meer Succussion [sic], or Shaking of the Earth, raised up the Mountain; but that the same Cause which</page><page sequence="24">162 Christopher Hut shook the Earth, that is, subterraneous Fire, cast up the Materials which raised the Mountain . . ."

As readers have long noticed, the phrase "But for such faith" seems to have two possible meanings which seem antithetical: "But" can be an adverb meaning "only" (so that the phrase would mean "only through such faith"), or it could be a preposition meaning "except." Critics have long debated these alternatives. In fact, Michael Erkelenz reports, textual scholars have found support for both posi- tions in earlier drafts of the poem; see his article "Shelley's Draft of 'Mont Blanc' and the Conflict of 'Faith'" (Review of English Studies 40.157 [19891: 100-103). 26. Compare Kant's similar remark in The Critique of Judgment (1792) that "a presentation of the infinite . . . can never be anything more than a negative presentation - but still it expands the soul. Perhaps there is no more sublime pas- sage in the Jewish Law than the commandment: Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven or on earth ..." (The Critique of Judgment, ed. and trans. James C. Meredith [Oxford: Clarendon, 1992], 127). 27. Michael O'Neill makes a similar statement about the line. The word "lone" in "Mont Blanc," he writes, "does much to sensitize the reader to the fact that the poem is more than a rehearsal of epistemological commonplaces. It is the 'moun- tains lone' in the first section that bring into the poem one of its most haunting and bewildering notes: that is, a sense that outside human discourse there is a world indifferent to the human" (147-48). 28. That this poetry fails to capture even the "shadows" of reality is consistent with Shelley's view of poetry in the Defence: "the most glorious poetry," he writes, "... is probably a feeble shadow of the original conception of the poet" (CW VII.135). Nevertheless, he insists in that essay, the true poet "participates in the eternal, the infinite, and the one" (CW VII.112). Likewise in the poem, the "strange sleep . . . Wraps all in its own deep eternity," and "All seems eternal now." My thinking here is not far from Leighton's idea that the "Power" de- scribed in both "Mont Blanc" and the "Hymn to Intellectual Beauty" is a name for "the original impulse to write" (44); see 44-72. Leighton's account differs funda- mentally from mine, however, in regarding poetic inspiration as the primary concern of "Mont Blanc." 29. See, for example, Phillips, 80-82. 30. In his ecocritical essay on Mont Blanc and literary representation, Mont Blanc': Shelley's Sublime Allegory of the Real" (The Greening of Literary Scholarship, ed. Steven Rosendale [Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 2002]: 207-23), Aaron Dunckel argues that deixis can make us "fully cognizant of the real through distanc- ing" - that is, by merely pointing to the real rather than attempting to represent it linguistically (220). For a provocative account of deixis in "Mont Blanc" from a</page><page sequence="25">Shelley's Unwriting of "Mont Blanc" 163 deconstructionist perspective, see Deborah Elise White, Romantic Returns: Supersti- tion, Imagination, History (Stanford University Press, 2000), 106-20. 31. See Bloom, 34-35; Vivian, "The One 'Mont Blanc' " (Powers and Reiman 569-79), 578-79; Wasserman, The Subtler Language, 237-40; and Chernaik, 49 and 59, n.12. 32. I cannot resist making three brief observations about this statement by Endo - no straw man here, for his article is in most respects astute, well-reasoned, and persuasive (indeed, one of the better articles on "Mont Blanc" out there, in my estimation). All three points are, in any case, applicable to a great many other critics as well. First, Endo assumes that Shelley's question is rhetorical. That as- sumption, I think, takes too much for granted: perhaps the question is in earnest, and the lack of a response does not imply a tacitly understood answer, but rather its unanswerability ("None can reply"). Second, he sees the closing lines as an abrupt reversal of the rest of the poem. This position seems at odds with Shelley's use of the conjunctive adverb "And" rather than "But," which would have sig- naled such a shift (O'Neill makes the same point in a slightly different context; see 149). Third, he indefensibly conflates "silence and vacancy," the very distinc- tion upon which Shelley's question hinges. Compare Leighton's much more provisional but still fundamentally similar paraphrase of the closing lines: "In the end, the presence of a 'thou' in the landscape becomes a last and precarious prop of 'the human mind's imaginings.' It is still a way of resisting 'vacancy'" (72). 33. Other critics whose interpretations of the poem's conclusion are somewhat closer to mine are Martin Priestman, Romantic Atheism: Poetry and Freethought, 1780-1830 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), p. 234-35; Nicholas Birns, "Secrets of the Birth of Time: The Rhetoric of Cultural Origins in Alastor and 'Mont Blanc"' (Studies in Romanticism 32.3 [1993]: 339-65), 363; Karen A. Weisman, Imageless Truths: Shelley's Poetic Fictions (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1994), 70; and Dunckel, 209. When I suggest that these essays fail to offer specific alternative readings, I mean that they perform no careful ex- plication of the closing lines. The same can be said for the vast majority of criticism on the poem. Critics tend to offer instead loose paraphrases of Shelley's question, which serve either to confirm or to complicate the conclusions they have drawn from elsewhere in the poem. I hope this essay redresses that deficiency. 34. Compare Barbauld, from "A Summer Evening's Meditation" (1773): "How deep the silence yet how loud the praise!" (47). òo. lhe poem is part or the bcrope Davies manuscript, discovered in 1976. bee Neville Rogers, "The Scrope Davies 'Shelley Find,'" {Keats-Shelley Memorial Bulle- tin 28 [1977]: 1-9); and Bleasdale, whose article on "To Laughter" discusses its relationship to "Mont Blanc." 36. The Shelleys did, however, have at least two Smollett novels in their library, The Adventures of Roderick Random (1748) and The Adventures ofLauncelot Graves (1762). See The Journals of Mary Shelley, ed. Paula R. Feldman, Paula and Diana Scott-Kilvert (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1987), Vol. II, 676. 37. See stanza 39 of The Triumph of Melancholy and stanza 57 of Psyche. Owenson's poem is actually a collection of separately titled "fragments"; the phrase "silence and solitude" appears in the first line of the second stanza of "Fragment XXXII," entitled "Canzona."</page><page sequence="26">164 Christopher Hitt 38. Lewis, p. 350; Scott, p. 188; Peacock, line 101; Thomson, Canto I, line 260; Rousseau, p. 243; Owenson, Vol. I, p. 167. 39. Note also Julie's reply to St. Preux's sublimely melancholy remarks: "I dread these equivocal excesses, all the more dangerous because the imagination that excites them is limitless" (194). 40. Indeed, I think "Mont Blanc" could be productively read from an ecocritical perspective, by which I mean a critical approach which foregrounds its own evaluative judgments about human beings' relationships to the nonhuman world (as they are reflected in the subject text). I am aware of one ecocritical study of the poem, Aaron Dunckel's recent "'Mont Blanc': Shelley's Sublime Allegory of the Real" (cited in n.30 above). Although Dunckel's article bears little resemblance to mine, I do tend to agree with his main claim about "Mont Blanc" - that it can be seen as demonstrating a "distancing" form of representation more sophisticated, and ultimately more ecological, than mimesis. I might note, though, that his essay is less a reading of the poem than a theoretical meditation on literary representa- tion that uses Shelley's poem as (in his words) its "primary example" (211).
