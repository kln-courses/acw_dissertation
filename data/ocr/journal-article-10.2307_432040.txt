<plain_text><page sequence="1">BERLEANT, ARNOLD. The Aesthetics of Environment. Temple University Press, 1992, 240 pp., $34.95 cloth. The Aesthetics of Environment calls for an all-inclu- siveness of outlook, for the integration and recon- ciliation of seemingly conflicting perspectives, for the active engagement of human beings in and with their complete world of experience. Distance, objec- tification, and alienation from art and life are dis- eases to be conquered. An emphasis upon sensory richness and the appreciative nature of engagement give the enterprise its aesthetic quality. To achieve such thorough engagement requires acceptance of the comprehensive unity and totality of the world we experience, our environment. As Arnold Berleant sees it, environment, the sphere of aesthetic experience, indeed of life itself, is wholly unfenced. Moreover, it is never depleted, because Berleant's "integrative view" comprehends it as "the natural process as people live it, however they live it. Environment is nature experienced, na- ture lived" (p. 10). Environment is cultural too (p. 21). What is Nature? Again, we're wanting noth- ing. All we need is a "Leibnizian acceptance: What-</page><page sequence="2">478 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism ever is, is" (p. 9), an acceptance of "everything as a legitimate aspect of the natural realm" (p. 8). This choice of an unbounded environment as the sphere of experience fully suits Berleant's theoretic posture. We must, he thinks, respond to experience with everything at our disposal and see ourselves as immediately enmeshed in it all. The payoff is a vastly enhanced sense of experiential belonging, of being fully at home in the world; plus we cast off the arbi- trary imprisonment of conceptual boundaries which constrain our capacity to appreciate the world. So we achieve through a sense of environment a dissolution of boundaries between Subject and Object, Art and Nature, City and Country, Looking and Making, Thinking and Doing, the Aesthetic and the Moral, Contemplating and Living, etc., etc.; dualisms all, and each one sapping experience of its true richness. The book is built on and builds up to such a holistic vision. Berleant offers no metaphysical exposition, but instead clothes his holism in proposals for the human- izing of cities, the preservation of the countryside, the improvement of museums. The proposals follow decent secular Humanist suburban liberal lines- smaller buildings, less traffic, more public areas, less pollution, more green space, etc.-all laudable but none requiring the purchase of stock in Monism. A number of important metaphysical themes emerge through the book, some of which might have enjoyed more explicit articulation and dialogue. The following play through and underpin the study. 1) Experience does not just come to us as passive receivers but is fashioned by us at the immediate level of perception and influenced by deep cultural and historical forces. This has implications for disinter- estedness and detachment which are not, for Berleant, real desiderata of experience, and, for that matter, are not psychologically possible. Disinterestedness and detachment distort experience by creating an artifi- cial dualism between subject and object. Once we reject this subject/object distinction, we are no longer at a remove from the objects of our experi- ence. Hence, we properly realize ourselves as engaged with them, makers and viewers, so to speak, partici- pants in a joint venture. This view doesn't comfortably accommodate sci- ence, which seems predicated on our powers of dis- tancing. If it cannot, then a dualism between the scientific and aesthetic world views emerges. But this account cuts against the widely-accepted view that increased scientific knowledge enhances appre- ciation. Again, Berleant cavalierly refers to "the pre- tense of objective measurement" and tells us that "perception is as cultural as mythology" (p. 20). At the least, Berleant is obliged to meet basic and famil- iar realist objections. At best, Berleant's claims about perception and objectivity are debatable; but he never makes the metaphysical argument for them. 2) Experience is not particulate, does not come as a series of discrete packages. This applies not only to the boundaries of things in space, but also to the sensory divisions traditionally recognized. Experi- ence comes essentially as an integrated fusion of sensory qualities, inner and outer. To concentrate upon one aspect of experience; e.g., visual or aural, is to abstract from our real experience of the world. Such abstraction is distortion. Any invitation to limit experience thus undervalues experience. Here we are invited to conceive experience as a biotic soup through which we must make our way, a soup whose ingredients are unavoidably intermin- gled. This neo-Humean view does not, however, sit well with the first theme, in which it is suggested that experience qua construction can in principle take on any number of culturally impressed patterns, includ- ing the discrete packaging science requires. 3) The aesthetic perspective is a mode of experience itself and is only partially exercised and fulfilled in the context of art appreciation. Full aesthetic experience extends to experience generally as a way of appre- hending, appreciating, and giving value to experience. "The entire sensible world is included within the pur- view of aesthetics ... A universal aesthetic is an aes- thetic of the universe" (pp. 174-175). Thus the aes- thetic perspective characterizes a view of life much as moral, scientific, and religious perspectives do. What- ever absorbs the aesthetic outlook at any given time is environment. Since nothing can fail to be environment for a subject, everything falls within the domain of aesthetic apprehension. Everything has an aesthetic dimension. The proper appreciation of art involves drawing it under the same aesthetic light anything else may enjoy. "All aesthetic response requires both recep- tivity and engagement" (p. 143). Just as Berleant's prescriptions for improving our living space are con- sistent with environmentally-expanded liberalism, so his rejection of academicism and the primacy of ana- lytical distance connects with the rejection of founda- tions and the subsequent re-discovery of the value of the immediate world of the subject. Disinterestedness is not objectivity but more like indifference of the kind elicited by butterflies behind glass, pinned, labeled, dead. Whom does he admonish here? Only those few for whom the aesthetic is a cold-blooded critical venture. But visceral romantic aestheticism never died. It received sophisticated treatment in Sircello's New Theory of Beauty and has flourished in the ecofemi- nism of Elizabeth Dodson Gray's Green Paradise Lost. What exactly does this comprehensive engage- ment amount to? Often it seems like little more than an affirmation of seeing things positively, of liking spontaneously whatever one may about the contents of experience. If the misgivings I have already expressed smack</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 479 of moral complaint, this will not, I hope, be taken as out of order. After all, Berleant's entire outlook, his critique of cities, and his treatment of the countryside are openly moral. My fundamental concern is that Berleant's integrative engagement, with its emphasis upon acceptance and sense of home, may not assist in or even point to a better world. The vaunted cre- ativity of perception may well foster playful acquies- cence, if not powerless subjectivism. The acceptance of whatever may well leave activism for improve- ment without an ally. The holism of integration may well undervalue the pursuit of objectivity. In a way, even Berleant's universal sense of being at home con- duces to the revival of anthropomorphic and anthropo- centric prejudice. Engagement excludes our apprecia- tion of the foreign and the alien which are necessary for full experience. No one today will deny that environ- mental ethics and aesthetics are inextricably bound up with one another. Below I offer a variety of criti- cisms relating to this interconnection. (i) Berleant's concept of Nature will not comfort those who fear Nature is vanishing before our very eyes. His environment bears no relation to the plun- dered battleground of environmentalists. His person- based environment leaves nothing to protect for its own sake even if there may be human interests that might suffer at the hands of stock villains such as architects on contract to McDonald's or Exxon Cor- poration. Nor does Berleant's environment preserve the special sacredness accorded to Nature by inspired trampers like John Muir. After all, Berleant's inclu- sive nature takes in "city as well as countryside, fac- tory as well as museum, desert wastes as well as glacier-fed fjords" (p. 11). (ii) Environment concerns what's out there versus what's ours. The integration of everything simply destroys any notion of Nature that can possess any distinctiveness. Grassy pastures and gardens have nothing to do with Nature. Or, if they do, so do bricks (culturized clay) and baseball bats (culturally enfran- chised hickory). But this is unacceptable. Assimilation tames and domesticates. Once that happens-through science, art, aesthetic conquest, religion-we're all that's left. (iii) Should we welcome invocations to find every- thing, or even most things, engaging? I think not. Why? First, such views limit experience by devaluing our efforts at distance, efforts which are more difficult to achieve than any state of engagement. Secondly, there is nothing intrinsically wrong with alienation as such, nothing pathological, however painful it may become. Alienation, particularly from Nature (which I regard as endemic), furnishes experience as rich, com- plex, and appreciative as any other, however dark and unhappy. That we may wish to be rid of it doesn't sap its value. Life without it is like life at the equator, seasons without winter. Value in engagement can be enhanced only by the reality of the repulsive, the frightening, whatever is unapproachably different. Without the contrast, experience becomes shallow, sheltered, insipid. But the need to have both simply re- affirms the dualisms Berleant deems alienating and, accordingly, experientially destructive. Once again, the root problem is Berleant's exces- sive holism. However sincere, "this Spinozistic order of things" (p. 9) falsifies experience by riding rough- shod over distinctions we need and cannot help drawing. Berleant is free to call a spade a club but these "ideas of inclusion and continuity" (p. 5) make nonsense of Gin Rummy, not to mention the true bits in Naive Realism. (iv) We scarcely make our environment in the way Berleant suggests we do. At the very least, he needs to do more than suggest what is involved in this "making." How, exactly, is it done? How can it suc- ceed? How and when can it go wrong? Town plan- ning and museum design won't work as general para- digms because they are exclusively and merely human. No one will protest the emphasis given to aesthetic values in such ventures. But this emphasis neither needs nor implies some underlying Kantian theory of experience. Besides, if we are so creative, so versatile in our power to engage, we should be able to re-construct everything after our own aes- thetic muse. Carl Sandburg celebrated the energy of heavy machinery. With sufficient constructivist pow- ers, anything can become aesthetically engaging, even beautiful. But if this is so, what strength re- mains to the aesthetic outlook in any critique of whatever exists? If you give too much creative aes- thetic power to the subject, you lessen the power of criticism of the environment others have made. You re-affirm in this criticism the very existence of an offending external object which the view about the creativity of experience is designed to dissolve. (v) The Aesthetics of Environment leaves one with questions about participation and engagement. En- gaged to what extent? Can one appreciate music fully without making it? Can one appreciate making music properly without making one's own instrument? I personally don't think so; but Berleant gives me no boundaries. But if boundaries are possible, Berleant's sense of participation remains spectator-like. This calls the dreaded object of experience back in. Is engagement a matter of degree? Is there a spectrum ranging from full alienation to full engagement? Is there a recipe for lessening the distance? But if both full alienation and full engagement are possible, another dualism is born. Berleant's hyper-monism shares much with Deep Ecology and its New Age echo. The search for one- ness and integration is underwritten by metaphysics. If there's only one thing, there's only one thing to experience. But experience and the subject of experi-</page><page sequence="4">480 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism ence cannot themselves ex hypothesi be other than whatever exists. So, the boundary between the knower and the known collapses, as does that between the knowing subject and that subject's experience. The Aesthetics of Environment, alas, builds all too care- lessly on this foundation. Without a firmer epis- temological and metaphysical groundwork, Ber- leant's story is destined to seem reverie-like, perhaps something like a diary of what must be a very happy life, or an exercise in psycho-aesthetics. But as phi- losophy plain and simple, it just doesn't engage. STAN GODLOVITCH Social Science Group Lincoln University Canterbury, New Zealand</page></plain_text>
