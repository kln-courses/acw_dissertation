<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS 791 God's World and the Great Awakening. Limits and Renewals 3. By Stephen R. L. Clark. Pp. ix + 246. Oxford: Clar endon Press, 1991. isbn ο 19 824284 ο. £30. In a review of Parliament of Souls (the predecessor of God's World) in JTS NS, 42 (1991), 821, I suggested that in a properly developed Neoplatonic metaphysics and philosophy of man human sin and guilt should perhaps play a more significant role than Clark (or Plotinus) normally allows. In the new book Clark seems at times to have taken this sort of point: 'The real reasons why atheism seems to rule supreme are ethical, that is, they have to do with people's wishes and long-term strategies' (p. 30). Roughly speaking, that would suggest that the atheist (as Aug ustine held) would tend to produce an argument of the following sort: Ί want to commit adultery; the Church (or whoever) does not approve of that; therefore God does not exist.' Clark's new book is ambitious. More bluntly than many defenders of the 'ancients' against the 'moderns', he starts with two challenges: first (p. viii) that Christendom (and others) must recover their intellectual inheritance or die. By that he really means recover, not replace; he sees no future in replacing tradition with some variety of modernism in the hope of eventually retaining some (shadowy) part of tradition itself. Secondly, he insists that it would be helpful if not only the defenders but the opponents of 'tradition' had rather more knowledge of what it is. For, as he quotes (p. 2), we are now largely in the dark, as a result of habitual misrepresentation: 'When people want to get rid of Heaven, it is logical to start by making an atmosphere in which spiritual things appear out of place.' The tradition which Clark wants to restate is Chalcedonian orthodoxy, understood as the culmination of a long 'Platonic' tradition of pre-Christian and Christian philosophy and theology. The enemy, properly, is above all Nietzsche and his contemporary successors—whether they know they are his successors or not— for unless we procure Nietzsche's 'death', it is pointless to take 'precautions against intellectual dishonesty, spiritual corruption or any of the obstacles that good moderns have detected to right reason'. 'It is the refusal to admit that one might be wrong that has led so many moderns to deny "objective values'" (p. 211). For, as Clark rightly says, the alternative to believing in objective values is to believe (utterly) in oneself, or in nothing at all. Yet the former preference, as Heidegger proclaimed, leads to Hitlerism (if you like), while the latter undercuts all faith in the value of toleration</page><page sequence="2">792 REVIEWS or of scientific enquiry, reducing the former to cosy self righteousness and the latter to collecting cigarette ends in the gutter. Nietzsche saw the options clearly enough, and thus 'was by far the more interesting and valuable a philosopher than those who reject the principles and possibilities on which all civil peace and progress have depended while themselves still making a good living by professing knowledge and expecting others to respect their peace'. Derrida, in a classic piece of chutzpah, comically complained about being misquoted without recanting a jot of his habitual thesis about the essential ambiguity of authorial inten tions (p. 209). Clark's restatement of the perennial philosophy is, once again, too dense, at least within chapters. He leaps from topic to topic, from quotation to quotation, with bewildering rapidity. It would be merely churlish to complain that he expects us to think hard, but it is reasonable to suggest that he could be more persuasive— and he clearly wants to persuade and thinks it urgent to per suade—if the almost stream-of-consciousness and associative style could be somewhat abated. Too many friends and enemies are flashed before our wearying eyes in an extravagant succession of 'vision-bites', and though it seems (at least to me) that almost all Clark's targets deserve much of what he says about them, he looks at times almost like a mad gunman in a restaurant, spraying bullets in every direction. Yet there is pure pleasure in seeing him castigat ing contemporary theologians for their infatuation with Heidegger (pp. 152, 176), a man who transformed a proper recognition—in Clark's and Plato's terminology—of our need to awaken from a dream-world into an ideology of 'inflicting and facing Death'. For, as Clark observes (p. 152), 'romantic nihilism is hardly the same thing as being rooted in the eternal'. Clark's claims are both philosophical and historical. At the philosophical level he argues that to be human is to be understood as being a member of a community, but above all as a member of the community which is the body of Christ. Christ, understood at Chalcedon as Truly Man and Truly God, incarnates the Logos in such a way as to save the Father from suffering (p. 139), for if the Father suffers he is liable to change, and if he is liable to change he is not yet perfect. But if he is not yet perfect, there is no reason to suppose he ever will be. Thus, or similarly, Clark finds an argument for the 'necessity' of the Incarnation and a means of avoiding patripassianism (for if I, or God, have no feeling, we are empathetic in only a notional and sentimental sense (p. 143)) while in the Incarnation lies the only way to understand the fact that we are 'naturally' not what we are now. Christ is</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 793 Man and a man as he ought to be. As for ourselves, we can possess an unambiguous personal identity only in Him. On the historical front Clark faces the much controverted ques tion of the corruption of pristine Christianity by Hellenism, or of religion by metaphysics. Properly, he finds much of such anti theses to be bogus, or insignificant at a serious level. The funda mental ancient-modern controversy about the existence of objective values and the 'meaning' of the cosmos—not to speak of propositions about it—finds most Greek philosophers and their Jewish-Christian counterparts in the same camp. But pedants (not to speak of scholars like David Furley) might quibble about how far the Platonic tradition, with its objective values and unrecon structed final causes, should quite so readily be labelled as typically Hellenic—though it is certainly what survived as Hellenic into the Middle Ages. They might wonder too about how Philo (a prevalent Clarkean saint) is quite as typical of Hellenistic Judaism as Clark seems to believe. And I am still unwilling to concede that the 'personalist' side of Abrahamic religion does not push it further from 'Greek metaphysics' than Clark will (sometimes) allow. Yet ultimately in his insistence that the Chalcedonian version of Chris tian Platonism (well displayed by Maximus the Confessor, another favourite) is the best form so far available, Clark comes down in favour of the superiority of the Christian synthesis to its incom plete and less personal predecessor. But less personal, not impersonal. Which brings us to a surprisingly neglected topic. If Clark had had more to say about love and eros, he would have strengthened his case about the common road down which the Christian and the Platonist are travelling. Certainly by the end of his book Clark has recognized the importance of such questions (p. 216). He quotes to the effect that 'it is love, the love of persons sharing a life in freedom and fidelity that is the primordial human relation ship. When it is broken its components can become autonomous, degraded'. In contrast to that theological ideal Clark notes that 'Xenophanes' god ... is anthropomorphic but inhuman'—that is, merely rational. But eros and agape hardly appear in Clark's story. Had they done so, some of the emphases would have been differ ent. For Clark's Christianized and Chalcedonian Plato makes good metaphysics and good sense, but, as Augustine learned in Milan, to see the truth (or some of it) is not to want it, and not to be saved. Plato saw that too, thus insisting that Socrates was an erotic figure; to which the Christians did (and should) add that human love (whether desire, inspiration or affection) is not enough. Clark's book, like much of his recent work, is honest; it tells it</page><page sequence="4">794 REVIEWS like it is. The alternative to a Platonic and 'divine' universe to which we must be awakened, is a meaninglessness and triviality which we may pretend, if we find it convenient and attractive to do so, to be morally (though not spiritually) saturated. On every page of God's World we find something well argued, helpful and serious, though often with a good measure of wit thrown in. If we want an alternative to maximizing our preferences—and recog nize that it is mere commonsense to want such a thing—and if we decline to pick up some casual (but brutal) ideology, Clark has something old and new to offer: on the mindless distrust of meta physics; on anti-realism as closet scepticism; on persistent misrep resentations of Christianity, its history and its effects (e.g. on its supposedly formative role in the contemporary contempt, and hence exploitation, of the environment); on the willingness of liberal people to hold ρ and not-p at the same time, while smugly, and 'morally' claiming to be superior to the ancients—'If only we had been at Golgotha, the crucifixion would never have happened' (p. 39); on the trahisons des clercs which haunt much contemporary theology. Unnecessarily complicated and over-stuffed with learn ing and literacy though it sometimes is, God's World needs to be read and read and (if you can) thoroughly digested. John M.
