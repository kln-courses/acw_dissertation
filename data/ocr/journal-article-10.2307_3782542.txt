KELLERT, Yale University, 205 Prospect Street, New Haven, CT 06511 JOYCE K. BERRY, Yale University, 205 Prospect Street, New Haven, CT 06511 The wildlife profession has become increas- ingly aware of the need to learn more about how women view animals. This recognition has arisen in part from a greater interest among females in the conservation of wildlife, as well as a growing realization that rational wildlife management policy must be based on some understanding of the general public. Unfor- tunately, information on how men and women differ in perceptions of and interactions with animals is limited, and marked by speculation, bias, and lack of reliable data. Most studies of male vs. female wildlife-re- lated recreation have found higher participa- tion rates among males. This contrast is espe- cially striking when activities involve consumptive use, for example, hunting, trap- ping, or fishing (Hendee and Potter 1971, Schole 1973, Bryan 1979, Boddicker 1980, U.S. Fish and Wildl. Serv. 1982). Historically, higher male participation rates in various wildlife activities, as well as tradi- tional employment patterns, may account for the substantially greater numbers of men working in wildlife and other natural resource professions. In forestry, for example, women account for about 4.5% of all employees (M. Morales, Jr., Soc. Am. For., Bethesda, Md., pers. commun.) and, while comparable figures are not available for the wildlife profession, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service statistics indicate 38% of their white-collar work force are women, although females account for just 8% of higher level positions and nearly 80% of lower status white-collar jobs (J. Butler, U.S. Fish and Wildl. Serv., Washington D.C., pers. commun.). The possibility of significant future increases in the number of women in the wildlife and forestry professions is suggested by the finding that about 25% of presently enrolled professional students are female (Hodgdon 1982; Burrus- Bammel 1983; R. Christensen, Soc. Am. For., Bethesda, Md., pers. commun.). Few data have been collected comparing male vs. female perceptions of animals. Two relatively consistent results have been greater knowledge of wildlife among males (Dahlgren et al. 1977), and a much greater degree of antihunting and antitrapping sentiment among females (Applegate 1973, Shaw and Gilbert 1974, Shaw 1977, Wywialowski 1977). Among children, greater knowledge of an- imals among young males has been revealed (Kress 1975; Pomerantz 1977, 1985; LaHart 1978; Kellert 1985), while a more esthetic and anthropomorphic orientation appears to be more typical of young girls (Pomerantz 1977). Boys in grades 1-12 were found to be more inclined to rank fish, reptiles, and biting and stinging invertebrates as more appealing than did girls; in contrast, girls ranked flowers as their second most preferred aspect of the nat- ural environment, whereas boys ranked flowers last (Badaracco 1973). We present data from a study of adult Amer- icans which provides additional information concerning differences between males and fe- males regarding attitudes, knowledge, and be- haviors toward wildlife. We also discuss the theoretical and management implications of the findings. METHODS Our data base came from personal interviews with 3,107 adult (&gt;18 years) Americans residing in the 48 contiguous states and Alaska. An additional sampling in Alaska and the Rocky Mountain states was conducted to ensure sufficient numbers in these important areas.</page><page sequence="2">364 Wildl. Soc. Bull. 15(3) 1987 Table 1.

Women totaled 1,407 and men 1,048 of the weighted sample. The interviews were conducted in 1978 and 4 interview attempts were required before the potential respondent could be dropped from the study. The sample reflected the de- mographic composition of the American population (Table 1). A largely closed-end survey was used as the basis for the respondent interview and covered critical issues involving animals (e.g., endangered species man- agement, animal damage control, habitat preservation, etc. [Kellert 1980c]; consumptive and nonconsumptive wildlife and domestic animal uses [Kellert 1980a1; and public attitudes, knowledge, and preferences for ani- mals [Kellert and Berry 1981]). A minimum of 5 pre- tests was conducted in developing each section of the survey. Animal-related knowledge was assessed with a true- false and multiple choice scale. The 33-item scale had an overall sample mean of 52.8 on a scoring range of 0-100. The knowledge scale included questions based on personal experience, books, practical encounters with animals, and folk knowledge. Knowledge questions covered a variety of topics including "taxonomy" (e.g., "koala bears are not really bears"), "biological char- acteristics of animals" (e.g., "spiders have 10 legs"), "superstition" (e.g., "when frightened, an ostrich will bury its head in the sand"), "endangered species" (e.g, "timber wolves, bald eagles, and coyotes are all en- dangered species of animals"), "domestic animals" (e.g., "veal comes from lamb"), and "injury to humans or their property" (e.g., "North American tarantulas are extremely poisonous to man"). Additionally, knowl- Table 2. Types of human attitudes toward animals (Kellert 1980b). Attitude Definition Naturalistic Primary interest and affection for wildlife and the outdoors. Ecologistic Primary concern for the environ- ment as a system, for interrela- tionships between wildlife species and natural habitats. Humanistic Primary interest and strong affection for individual animals, principally pets. Regarding wildlife, focus on large attractive animals with strong anthropomorphic associa- tions. Moralistic Primary concern for the right and wrong treatment of animals, with strong opposition to exploitation or cruelty toward animals. Scientistic Primary interest in the physical at- tributes and biological functioning of animals. Esthetic Primary interest in the artistic and symbolic characteristics of ani- mals. Utilitarian Primary concern for the practical and material value of animals or the animal's habitat. Dominionistic Primary interest in the mastery and control of animals, typically in sporting situations. Negativistic Primary orientation an avoidance of animals due to indifference, dis- like, or fear. edge questions covered all vertebrate classes and 5 questions focused on invertebrates (e.g., "Lepidoptera is an order of insects that includes bees"). (Scientific names of species are not given because this could mis- represent the responses of survey participants.) A typology of basic attitudes toward animals and the natural environment (Table 2) was developed (Kellert 1980b) to describe fundamental values and meanings people attach to the nonhuman world. Cluster and correlational analyses of the individual attitude ques- tions resulted in the development of scales to measure the relative presence of eight of the attitude types. (A valid esthetic scale was not developed. It also proved impossible to obtain independent negativistic and neu- tralistic scales; therefore, 1 combined scale was devel- oped.) Sixty-nine closed-end attitude questions were used for the 8 attitude scales, with the smallest scale (humanistic) consisting of 5 items while the largest (utilitarian) included 13 questions. All responses to the attitude questions were based on a 7-point, agree-dis- agree, Likert-style response format and, whenever ap- propriate, the strength of the response (e.g., strongly</page><page sequence="3">EFFECTS OF GENDER * Kellert and Berry 365 vs. slightly agree or disagree) was included in the scale scoring. Scale scores ranged from 0 to 11 for the hu- manistic scale and from 0 to 27 for the utilitarian. The relative independence of the attitude scales was indi- cated by scale intercorrelations of &lt;0.20, with the ex- ception of a -0.42 correlation for the negativistic and naturalistic attitudes, and 0.41 correlation between the naturalistic and ecologistic scales. RESULTS Knowledge of Animals Males had significantly higher knowledge- of-animals scores than did females. The knowl- edge scale mean score of males was 55.4, while the female knowledge scale score was 51 (F = 66.8, 1 df, P &lt; 0.0001). Male vs. female dif- ferences were greatest when the questions con- cerned rare and endangered species or inver- tebrate animals. For example, regarding endangered species, 48% of males vs. 22% of females knew the snail darter is not an endan- gered butterfly; 31% of males vs. 22% of fe- males were aware the passenger pigeon and Carolina parakeet are extinct; and 38% of males vs. 29% of females recognized pesticides as a major factor in the decline of brown pelicans. Differences in knowledge of invertebrates were exemplified by the following results: 74% of males vs. 50% of females knew insects do not have backbones, 52% of males vs. 26% of fe- males were aware that herbicides are not used to control aphids, 22% of males vs. 8% of fe- males knew Coleoptera is a group of insects not including the ants, and 41% of males vs. 32% of females knew North American taran- tulas are not poisonous to humans. The only knowledge questions with insignificant male vs. female differences concerned domestic an- imals. A further reflection of male vs. female knowledge differences was their respective awareness of 8 relatively prominent wildlife issues. For example, 45% of males vs. 34% of females reported a moderate to great knowl- edge of the leghold trap issue, 28% of males vs. 18% of females indicated a similar aware- Table 3.

The only issue with insignificant male-female differences was the killing of harp seal pups for fur. Attitudes Toward Animals Male vs. female differences in attitudes to- ward animals were dramatic (Table 3). The strength and consistency of male vs. female differences were so pronounced as to suggest gender is among the most important demo- graphic influences on attitudes toward animals in our society. An especially striking contrast was the higher humanistic attitude scale scores of females.</page><page sequence="4">366 Wildl. Soc. Bull. 15(3) 1987 Table 4.

Women tended to express far stronger emo- tional attachments for individual animals, par- ticularly domestic pets. Additionally, females were more likely to reveal anthropomorphic feelings toward animals, especially in relation to large and esthetically attractive species. Females also obtained significantly higher scores than males on the moralistic scale (Table 3), indicative of a greater concern for a variety of animal cruelty issues and less support for the exploitation of and dominance over ani- mals. Relatedly, women voiced significantly greater opposition to laboratory experimen- tation, rodeos, use of leghold traps, killing of nonendangered animals for fur, and hunting for recreational and meat-gathering purposes (Table 4). Males, in contrast, had significantly higher scores on the utilitarian and dominionistic at- titude scales (Table 3). Utilitarian results re- flected a greater willingness among males to endorse exploitation of animals, or the usur- pation of wildlife habitat to yield increased material gains to human society. Dominionistic scale results indicated a greater tendency among males to derive personal satisfactions from the mastery and control of animals. Naturalistic and ecologistic scale differences were less pronounced but still significant (Ta- ble 3). Men were more inclined to express a desire for direct contact with wildlife in the context of exposure to nature and the out-of- doors. Also, higher ecologistic scores among males reflected a greater concern for main- taining viable relationships between wildlife and natural habitats and for ecosystem balance and functioning. Male vs. female differences on the ecologis- tic and moralistic scales (Table 3) reflected an important contrast between sexes in protec- tionist sentiment toward animals. Males ex- pressed greater concern about species and hab- itat conservation, while females indicated opposition to presumably cruel and exploit- ative treatment of animals, especially toward esthetically appealing and evolutionarily "higher" animals. Females also obtained significantly higher scores on the negativistic attitude scale (Table 3). Despite strong emotional attachments to</page><page sequence="5">EFFECTS OF GENDER * Kellert and Berry 367 pets, women expressed substantially more fear and indifference toward all animals, particu- larly in relation to wildlife. The higher nega- tivistic scores of females may provide some basis for understanding their significantly low- er knowledge-of-animals scores. The degree of gender differences in basic attitudes toward animals prompted an assess- ment of the possible influence of other de- mographic factors, particularly age and edu- cation. The influence of age on male vs. female attitudes toward animals was examined by di- viding the adult population into 4 age groups. Significant attitude and knowledge scale dif- ferences occurred between men and women at every age level, with the exception of insig- nificant utilitarian differences between 18-25 year olds, and insignificant naturalistic and ecologistic results between male and female respondents 65 years and older. Utilitarian re- sults suggest that greater concern among males for the practical value of animals occurs after early adulthood, typically when job and f a- milial responsibilities become important. The decline of male vs. female naturalistic and ecologistic differences among elderly respon- dents may reflect less interest and opportunity for outdoor wildlife experiences among older males. Among both males and females, higher ed- ucation was associated with more knowledge and appreciation and greater protectionist sen- timent toward animals (Table 5). Conversely, less emotional attachment for individual ani- mals, and a limited concern for wildlife, were observed among males and females of less ed- ucation. Education, thus, appeared to exert substantial influence on male vs. female knowl- edge and attitudes toward animals, but largely in a similar rather than divergent fashion.

On the other hand, men were far more likely to award a positive rating to predatory animals (e.g., wolf, snake), invertebrates (e.g., beetle, spider), or game animals (e.g., trout, moose). Men reported far more participation in var- ious "consumptive-use" activities such as hunt- ing, trapping, and fishing (Table 6). Eighty- five percent of the total hunting population was male, and 29% of all men reported having hunted during the previous 2 years, compared to 4% among females.

On the other hand, male anglers reported a substan- tially greater amount of fishing activity, with nearly 3 times more men than women fishing for 36 or more days. This smaller gender dif- ference in fishing activity, in comparison to hunting and trapping, may reflect a differen- tial perception among females of the capacity of fish vs. mammals and birds to experience pain and suffering. Male vs. female participation differences in various "nonconsumptive" wildlife activities were far less divergent (Table 6). Women were significantly more active in 4 of 8 activities including "casual" bird watching, feeding of birds, zoological park visitation, and animal- related photography. (The distinction of "casu- al" vs. "committed" bird watching was based on at least 41 days participation and the per- ceived ability to identify at least 40 bird species.) In contrast, men were more likely to participate in such nonconsumptive activities as "committed" bird watching, natural history museum visitation, and the amateur scientific study of animals. Men were more likely than women to belong to any animal-related organization, and com- prised a significantly greater proportion of members of sportsmen (89% male) and envi- ronmental protection organizations (62% male). In contrast, women were more likely than men to be members of humane and animal welfare organizations (80% female). DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS A number of significant results have been presented indicating substantial differences in male vs. female attitudes, knowledge, and be- haviors toward animals. The outstanding impression is that most women value animals for fundamentally different reasons than do men, and that the sexes contrast considerably in their interests and satisfactions derived from animals. The work of Gilligan (1982) on variations in moral development between the sexes provides a theoretical basis for interpreting the results. Although Gilligan's research involved a dif- ferent focus, its potential relevance to our re- sults warrants a brief review of her findings. Based on research (and the work of Kohlberg [1981] and Chodorow [1978]), Gilligan con- cluded that varying socialization experiences produce major differences in the moral and ethical perceptions of men and women. Among the most important aspects of this contrast is a tendency among women to stress the role of nurturer and caretaker, in contrast to a male inclination to emphasize work, competition, and assertiveness. These varying sexual role behaviors encourage women to define them- selves more frequently than men in terms of relationships to other people, particularly close</page><page sequence="7">EFFECTS OF GENDER * Kellert and Berry 369 associates, and the related ability to maintain interpersonal harmony and social intimacy. As a consequence, women appear to be more in- clined than men to stress obligations to inti- mates, the caring for others, and the sustain- ment of cordial personal relations. Gilligan (1982) further suggested that men view the world in more distinct, rational, and logically differentiated ways. The male ten- dency is to achieve personal autonomy and a defined relationship to others by emphasizing abstract positional ties, distributions of power and authority, the importance of "rights" based on formally enunciated rules, and a hierar- chical structure of roles. The female moral in- clination is to emphasize a highly articulated sense of responsibility to others, caring and compassion, and the attributes of sympathy and empathy. In effect, Gilligan's theory sug- gests moral development for the male is de- fined largely in terms of fairness, logic, hier- archy, assertiveness, and individual rights, whereas women appear to stress interpersonal responsibility, nonaggressiveness, and caring for others. Gilligan's (1982) theory helps to elucidate a number of the results presented on male vs. female differences in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors toward animals. The postulate of a female moral emphasis on caring for intimates, nonaggressiveness, and compassion is consis- tent with our findings that women tend to as- sert strong emotional attachments to individual domestic animals and object to a wide variety of activities involving the possible infliction of cruelty, harm, and suffering on animals. Also, the apparent contradiction of females obtain- ing high scores on the humanistic and nega- tivistic attitude scales may reflect a female dis- position toward familiar animals, accompanied by a tendency to be relatively unconcerned about unfamiliar and remote wild animals. Also consistent with Gilligan's (1982) model, males were characterized by a more cognitive and logically abstract perception of animals, reflected in substantially greater knowledge of animals and ecological concern for the rela- tionship of wildlife to natural habitats. A fur- ther consistency was the tendency of males to derive greater satisfactions than females from competition and mastery over animals, as well as from their exploitation. Male vs. female differences in perceptions and uses of animals were, thus, not only sta- tistically significant but compatible with the- oretical and empirical work in moral devel- opment and psychology. The challenge for the wildlife management profession is to use these results in a positive and practical fashion. The identification of fundamental differences in male vs. female relationships to animals cer- tainly does not imply the superiority of 1 per- spective over the other. Instead, these results suggest the need to extrapolate from the "best" of each viewpoint, and to reconcile widely con- flicting attitudes and concerns about animals and the natural environment. Without ques- tion, women were far more bothered than men about the possible infliction of pain and suf- fering on individual animals. This concern manifested itself in much greater opposition to such activities as hunting, trapping, and predator control. Also, women constitute a larger proportion of those involved in efforts to halt such practices as the harvesting of harp seals or use of leghold traps. Relatedly, women comprise the great majority of humane and animal-welfare organization members. In contrast, most wildlife managers tend to view many wildlife conservation issues and ac- tivities largely from the perspective of whether or not populations can sustain particular rates of harvest, or provide diverse practical and recreational benefits for human society. Per- haps relatedly, most wildlife managers are male, often of rural background, and tend to be socialized into an ecological and scientific perspective. The implication is that marked variations in viewpoint on many aspects of wildlife conservation and management may partially reflect differences in how males and females perceive animals. This does not mean</page><page sequence="8">370 Wildl. Soc. Bull. 15(3) 1987 that opinions on controversial wildlife issues are so lacking in scientific merit that they can be reduced to a mere demographic and atti- tudinal artifact. But the results of this study do suggest that major contrasts in how males and females view animals are relevant to an understanding of wildlife controversies. It may be necessary for wildlife managers to recog- nize the role of these gender variations in the clash of positions and, in the pursuit of policies that serve all constituencies, attempt to fashion new management formulas based on fairness and consensus. On the other hand, the rela- tively low knowledge and ecologistic and com- paratively high negativistic scores of women suggest that another management challenge is to cultivate greater understanding of animals and ecological awareness among females, while developing in men a more empathetic and less emotionally detached concern for wildlife. Part of the needed change is some alteration in prevailing assumptions about who and what is a wildlife and natural resource professional. As indicated previously, women comprise a relatively small proportion of the wildlife and forestry professions, as well as a negligible frac- tion of higher level decision-makers. In Gilli- gan's (1982) terms, the perception of the wild- life and natural resource manager is largely based on male imagery emphasizing qualities of assertiveness, emotional detachment, and abstract scientific logic. This role model is sim- ilar to one Kennedy (1982:86) described in his study of the forestry profession: "the tradi- tional (masculine) forester role model [is] achieved by having our rational intellectual process (our will) dominate our emotions and other weaker aspects of our human nature.... Dominance and control (not mutuality, sup- port and relationship) are the traditionally re- spected thought and management styles." We are not suggesting that the traditional role model of the natural resource manager is some- how wrong, but that it may be alien to many aspiring women professionals and, in effect, constitute a subtle bias against females enter- ing the field. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION Various results have been presented dem- onstrating significant differences in male vs. female attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors to- ward wildlife. Females especially valued wild animals as objects of affection and expressed considerable concern regarding the consump- tive exploitation of wildlife. Males were far more knowledgeable and less fearful of wild- life and more inclined to value animals for practical and recreational reasons. These re- sults were somewhat elucidated by the theo- retical work of Gilligan (1982) regarding moral and cognitive differences among males and fe- males. Male vs. female variations in perceptions and behaviors toward animals appear to have con- siderable theoretical and practical importance. We must conclude that gender is among the most important demographic factors in deter- mining attitudes about animals in our society. Major efforts to broaden the scope and effec- tiveness of wildlife management should, thus, consider and understand the influence of gen- der. LITERATURE CITED APPLEGATE, J. E. 1973.
