      <p>A set of thirteen tapestries of the <italic>Story of Gideon</italic> has hung in the long gallery at Hardwick Hall, Derbyshire, since the end of the sixteenth century (fig. 1). The tapestries survive along with detailed information on their original purchase and use, and have seen very little physical intervention in the past four hundred years. As such they are a unique document, both of Flemish tapestry production and of English taste in the sixteenth century. The tapestries are dated 1578 and were woven for Sir Christopher Hatton, one of Elizabeth I’s most flamboyant courtiers, for his palace of Holdenby Hall. The set was sold scarcely a decade later to pay off Hatton’s debts and was purchased by Elizabeth, Countess of Shrewsbury (“Bess of Hardwick”), for the new Hall she was building at Hard-wick: the tapestries thus formed the centerpiece of two of the most important interiors of the Elizabethan age. Made not in Brussels but in the less prestigious center Oudenaarde, and at a time when the Flemish tapestry industry is usually said to have been in decline, the <italic>Gideon</italic> set is nonetheless vast in scale (nearly 20 feet high and over 230 feet in length), making this one of the most ambitious tapestry sets of the sixteenth century, rivaling the great princely projects of the 1530s and 1540s. The <italic>Gideon</italic> tapestries are the largest tapestry set to survive in Britain today, exceeding even Henry VIII’s <italic>Abraham</italic> tapestries at Hampton Court in scale, if not in quality. At the same time, the tapestries bear witness to the troubled political and religious climate surrounding their manufacture, and ongoing conservation has revealed many unique features that shed new light on the conditions and regulations governing the tapestry industry. This article will trace the design, manufacture, and early history of the <italic>Gideon</italic> tapestries, and argue for their unique status in the history of late-sixteenth-century Flemish tapestry production, and of English patronage in the same period.<fig id="fg1" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <title>Description of the Tapestries</title>
         <p>Today the appreciation of the <italic>Gideon</italic> tapestries is obscured by two main factors: their dirty and faded condition (now partly remedied by a conservation program initiated in 1990), and the large number of portraits that hang over them. For this reason no attempt has ever been made to identify the subjects of the tapestries, or to evaluate them visually. The set comprises thirteen tapestries, each around 20 feet high and between 7.5 and 29.5 feet in width, with a total length of over 230 feet. Each tapestry is woven with wide borders with a design of strap work and foliage interspersed with decorative and allegorical figures, and the prominent coat of arms of Sir Christopher Hatton (sometimes overlaid with that of the Countess of Shrewsbury; see below) is in the center of each border. The side borders are the same on left and right for each tapestry and include figures of Justice and Minerva above and below the coats of arms, and putti at the upper and lower corners. The upper and lower borders are also the same for each tapestry, and include figures of Fame blowing trumpets to either side of the central coat of arms, small fauns, women holding olive branches, and bunches of flowers, with some of these elements omitted for the narrower tapestries. Christopher Hatton’s initials are woven in blue letters into the lower galloon of each tapestry beneath the coat of arms (see fig. 25). Two of the panels, obviously made to fit narrow stretches of wall, are woven without side borders.<sup>1</sup>

         <p>The tapestries tell the story of Gideon, following the Old Testament book of Judges. Gideon was called upon by God to bring an end to the worship of false gods by the Israelites, and to defeat the oppressive Midianites. He began by building a new temple with a small group of followers, and eventually gathered an army and chased the Midianites from Israel. The most famous event in his story, and the most frequently represented, is the calling down of dew onto the fleece of a sheep, which acted as a sign from God that Gideon had been chosen. This event was seen as prefiguring the Annunciation in medieval typology, and Gideon’s association with the fleece also led to his adoption as patron of the Order of the Golden Fleece—an event which, as we will see, has an important bearing on the design of the tapestries at Hardwick.</p>
         <p>Gideon himself can be recognized in each scene, as he is bearded and wears sandals and stockings with arabesque patterns and a band of studs around the top. The first tapestry, <italic>The Children of Israel Cry Out to the Lord</italic> (fig. 2), shows a group of people weeping and wringing their hands, with houses being burned in the background, representing the persecution of the people of Israel by the Midianites. In the foreground, pointing to the sky, is the prophet who was sent to rebuke them for their disobedience. The next tapestry, <italic>The Angel Appears to Gideon</italic> (fig. 3), shows Gideon speaking to the angel that appeared to him under the oak tree in Oprah while he was threshing wheat, telling him that he would save the people of Israel. The conversation continues in <italic>Gideon’s Present to the Lord</italic> (fig. 4), where Gideon slits the throat of a goat that he plans to present to God as a sacrifice, and in the background he appears again catching the goat, while women bring cakes and broth as part of the offering. In the fourth tapestry, <italic>Gideon’s Offering Bursts into Flames</italic> (fig. 5), Gideon watches in astonishment as the goat is suddenly engulfed in fire when touched by the angel’s rod, and two men in the background flee in terror. In the fifth tapestry, <italic>Gideon Destroying the Altar of Baal</italic> (fig. 6), Gideon and his companions attack the temple of the false god Baal with pickaxes and clubs, demolishing the building and smashing statues. In the background men cut down trees to make a sacrifice, and Gideon himself appears on a distant hillside receiving instructions from God, represented by a tetragrammaton in the clouds. The scene is set at night, and a moon appears prominently in the sky surrounded by stars. In the next scene, <italic>Gideon Building an Altar to the Lord</italic> (see fig. 20), Gideon and his men build a new altar to replace the one they have destroyed, and Gideon appears again in the distance conversing with God. The seventh tapestry, <italic>The People Asking Joash to Bring Out His Son</italic> (fig. 7), shows a crowd of angry people at the house of Gideon’s father, Joash, demanding that he give up his son so that he can be punished for destroying their temple. Joash himself stands steadfastly in the doorway, above which are inscribed the words “cvstodi nos dñe [domine]” (Lord protect us) and the date 1578 (see fig. 17), probably the date that the tapestry set was begun or completed.<fig id="fg4" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>The last six tapestries deal with Gideon’s war against the Midianites, and in these scenes his costume is augmented by a breastplate and a plumed helmet. <italic>Gideon Sending Messengers to Various Cities</italic> (fig. 8) can be identified thanks to a related tapestry in Rome, which has a Latin inscription identifying the subject.<sup>2</sup> Gideon is in the center, at the head of an army carrying trumpets and flags, handing a letter to a messenger calling for more followers to fight with him against the Midianites and Amalekites. The next tapestry is <italic>Gideon and the Fleece</italic> (fig. 9), which, as already mentioned, is the scene most usually associated with Gideon, often seen as a cipher for the whole story. Before going to war Gideon asked God to give him a sign by letting dew land on a fleece that he left out overnight, but not on the adjacent ground. The next night Gideon asked that the dew land only on the ground, and not on the fleece. Gideon appears in the center of the tapestry wringing out the fleece, and again in the background kneeling before the fleece as the dew falls onto it. For the next scene, <italic>Gideon Selecting His Army</italic> (fig. 10), Gideon stands in the center, now fully armed, directing his army to drink from a river. God had told him to select three hundred of the men who had come to fight for him, so he asked them all to drink and selected those who cupped the water in their hands, not those who lapped like dogs. In the distance on the far left Gideon kneels before God, who appears in the sky, and near the center one soldier carries a banner decorated with a fleece. The preparations for war continue in the next scene, <italic>Gideon Entering the Midianite Camp as a Spy</italic> (fig. 11), where Gideon’s army appears on the left carrying flags with the sign of a fleece, and the enemy encampment is in the distance on the right. The exact event represented here is unclear, but the group of men by a tree near the center may represent Gideon and his servant preparing, under cover of darkness, to approach the Midianite camp, where they will overhear one of the soldiers telling of a dream in which Gideon’s army defeated them. The penultimate scene, <italic>Gideon Attacking the Midianites</italic> (fig. 12), is a huge battle, with Gideon’s army charging in on the left and Gideon himself in the foreground blowing a trumpet, while the Midianites are represented by a jumble of men and horses on the right. Gideon had planned a surprise attack at night, and told his men to carry lamps, which they were to hide inside pitchers, and trumpets; at the sound of his trumpet they blew theirs and smashed the pitchers to reveal their flaming lamps, and the Midianites were driven mad with fear. In the tapestry the soldiers carry streaming torches and blow large, curved trumpets. The final scene, <italic>The People Bringing Looted Gold to Gideon</italic> (see fig. 9), shows Gideon standing over a cloak spread on the ground, which is covered with gold objects looted from the defeated enemy. These would be melted down and turned into an ephod, which became the object of idolatry after Gideon died. The more brutal events in the aftermath of the war, including Gideon ordering his son to execute the Midianite princes, are omitted.<fig id="fg8" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <title>The Medici <italic>Gideon</italic> Tapestries, 1561</title>
         <p>The Hardwick <italic>Gideon</italic> tapestries are related to an earlier set with the same subject bought for Cosimo I de’ Medici in 1561, which also numbered thirteen panels, although only three survive today.<sup>3</sup> Made in Brussels, the Medici <italic>Gideon</italic> set was purchased in two installments and was sent directly to Spain, where it formed part of the extensive trappings and furnishings that accompanied Francesco de’ Medici, Cosimo’s eldest son, on his journey in courtship of Joanna of Austria, daughter of the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II.<sup>4</sup> The subject of the series was clearly intended as a compliment to Francesco’s Habsburg hosts, in reference to their chivalric order of the Golden Fleece. The Order was founded in 1430 by Philip the Good of Burgundy and was originally devoted to Jason and his quest for the Golden Fleece, but in 1431 it was felt that an order of Christian knights needed a biblical patron, and so Gideon was chosen, thanks to his association with a sheep’s fleece. In 1448 Philip the Good commissioned a magnificent series of tapestries of the story of Gideon, which was still in use at ceremonies of the Order in the sixteenth century.<sup>5</sup>
         </p>
         <p>The subjects of the three surviving Medici <italic>Gideon</italic> tapestries are <italic>Gideon Interrogating a Young Man of Succoth, Gideon Sending Messengers to Various Cities</italic>, and <italic>Gideon Entering the Midianite Camp as a Spy</italic>, and there is also a border whose Latin inscription describes <italic>Gideon Choosing His Army</italic>.<sup>6</sup> The latter three subjects all appear at Hardwick, and direct comparison suggests that the same cartoons were used for both weavings.<sup>7</sup> For the Hardwick set small changes were made within the designs, and there are also differences in the execution of the foliage and background elements.<sup>8</sup> Most notably, however, the Hardwick set has been increased substantially in size: the surviving Medici tapestries measure around 13.75 feet in height, whereas those at Hardwick are an enormous 20 feet high. This additional height has been achieved by extending the main fields at the top and bottom with additional areas of landscape and sky, and through the addition of unusually broad borders of over three feet in width. The unusual size of the borders suggests that they were created especially for this weaving, albeit incorporating elements from the borders on the Medici set and other standard motifs. The resulting height of the tapestries is such that a standard loom was inadequate, and the upper and lower borders were woven separately and stitched onto the main field.<sup>9</sup>

The two earliest were woven in Brussels ca. 1560; however, neither is currently thought to represent scenes from the <italic>Story of Gideon</italic>. The first, which corresponds closely to <italic>Gideon Sending Messengers to Various Cities</italic>, is part of a set of five tapestries in the Bavarian State Collection, most recently described as a <italic>History of Saul</italic>.<sup>10</sup> The second, a single panel at Bunratty Castle, Ireland, corresponds to <italic>The People Asking Joash to Bring Out His Son</italic> at Hardwick but is known under the title <italic>David and Absalom</italic> (fig. 13).<sup>11</sup> In both cases a design appears to have been reused to describe a different narrative episode, a not uncommon phenomenon. The existence of these two panels, and the fact that the Munich <italic>Saul</italic> tapestries have different maker’s marks from the Medici <italic>Gideon</italic> set, suggest that at an early stage the cartoons were being shared between entrepreneurs; some subjects may even have been “poached” for the <italic>Gideon</italic> series from earlier sets of tapestry designs. It is also worth noting that <italic>Gideon</italic> tapestries are recorded in a number of important sixteenth-century collections,<sup>12</sup> but these were not necessarily after the same designs, as various other sets of <italic>Gideon</italic> cartoons were also in circulation.<sup>13</sup>

         <p>Nonetheless, the Medici <italic>Gideon</italic> series was to prove popular in the second half of the sixteenth century. A set of four tapestries derived from the same designs is now at the Château de Châteaudun and includes the subjects <italic>The Children of Israel Cry Out to the Lord</italic> (fig. 14), <italic>Gideon’s Offerings Burst into Flames, Gideon’s Present to the Lord</italic> 
            <italic>and</italic> 
            <italic>Gideon and the Fleece</italic> (in one tapestry), and <italic>Gideon Entering the Midianite Camp as a Spy</italic>. Here the designs are reversed and the costumes and other details are interpreted very freely, combining some scenes and adding new elements to others. A highly simplified rendering of <italic>Gideon Selecting His Army</italic> in the Cleveland Museum of Art indicates the existence of cruder versions.<sup>14</sup> Further evidence of the distribution of the <italic>Gideon</italic> designs is provided by a painting by the German artist Wolfgang Heimbach (ca. 1615–after 1678) of a <italic>Night Banquet</italic> (fig. 15). On the back wall wide strips of tapestry hang between the windows, including two sections from <italic>Gideon Destroying the Altar of Baal</italic> and, on the right-hand wall, <italic>Gideon Building an Altar</italic>.<sup>15</sup> The fairly narrow borders composed of fruit and flowers are similar to those found on the panels in Munich and at Bunratty Castle. The combined evidence points to a series that was probably created in around 1560 for Cosimo de’ Medici, and then rewoven in both Brussels and Oudenaarde in the years that followed. The <italic>Gideon</italic> set at Hardwick is by far the most complete version of the series to survive, and was almost certainly the largest ever woven.<fig id="fg14" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <title>The Manufacture of the Tapestries</title>
         <p>In the past, tapestry scholars have been divided over the origin of the Hardwick <italic>Gideon</italic> tapestries, and attributions have been suggested to both Brussels and Oudenaarde.<sup>16</sup> This uncertainty can now be resolved by a previously unnoticed maker’s mark in the form of a six-pointed star that appears in the upper right corner of the galloon on two of the tapestries (fig. 16). Similar stars appear on four other known tapestry sets: a pair of <italic>Planets</italic> (Victoria and Albert Museum), a <italic>Large Leaf Verdure</italic> (Art Institute of Chicago), a set of five <italic>Large Leaf Verdures with the Labours of Hercules</italic> (split between the Louvre and the Provincial Paleis van Oost, Ghent), and a set with <italic>Scenes from Roman History</italic> (Philadelphia Museum of Art).<sup>17</sup> This entire group of tapestries has been attributed to Oudenaarde on the basis that one of the <italic>Labours of Hercules</italic> bears the mark of the city, a pincenez over a yellow shield with three horizontal red bands. The <italic>Gideon</italic> tapestries at Hardwick can now be attributed on the same basis. The date 1578 above a doorway in <italic>The People Asking Joash to Bring Out His Son</italic> (fig. 17) can be compared with the dates of 1599 and 1601 that appear similarly “hidden” within the design of the Victoria and Albert Museum <italic>Planets</italic>.<fig id="fg16" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <title>The Tetragrammaton and the Reformation</title>
         <p>The Hardwick <italic>Gideon</italic> set includes five scenes where God appears in the clouds, watching over, or speaking to, Gideon, and in each case he is represented by a tetragrammaton, the Hebrew name for God. In the Medici <italic>Gideon</italic> set only one representation of God survives, but here he appears instead as a bearded man leaning out of a cloud, and the same is true in the corresponding scenes in the Châteaudun weaving. The modification of an anthropomorphic God to a textual one helps to contextualize the production of the Hardwick <italic>Gideon</italic> tapestries, as it relates directly to Reformation strictures on representation. The use of the tetragrammaton is a literal interpretation of the Calvinist doctrine that God cannot be represented in visual form, but must instead be known through his word. The motif first appeared in Christian art in the 1520s.<sup>18</sup> Its use increased during the sixteenth century and became widespread in the Netherlands and elsewhere following the iconoclastic riots of 1566.<sup>19</sup> In some cases the tetragrammaton was imposed on existing images, a pertinent example being a series of prints of the <italic>Story of Gideon</italic> after Maarten van Heemskerck, first published in 1561 with a large bearded figure of God sending the dew down onto the fleece, and reissued the following decade with God replaced by a tetragrammaton (figs. 18, 19).<fig id="fg18" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>The religious situation in Oudenaarde in the 1570s strongly suggests that the use of the tetragrammaton was the result of a choice made by the manufacturers, not the patron. Like many southern Netherlandish centers the town was wracked by religious conflict for much of the sixteenth century, as the Catholic Spanish governors sought to suppress the reformist ideas that were sweeping the region. As Martine Vanwelden has shown, Oudenaarde tapestry weavers were closely involved in reformist activity from as early as the 1520s.<sup>20</sup> In 1578, the date woven into one of the <italic>Gideon</italic> tapestries, a Calvinist government was established in Oudenaarde and controlled the city for four years. In this context the use of the tetragrammaton can be seen as a statement of the religious orientation of those who produced the tapestries, perhaps even an act of defiance against Catholic rule in the Netherlands. It may also be significant that directly below the date 1578 are the words “cvstodi nos dñe [domine]” (Lord protect us), the only inscription to appear anywhere in the series (see fig. 17).</p>

         <title>The Physical Character of the Tapestries</title>
         <p>The physical characteristics of the <italic>Gideon</italic> tapestries can also be read in terms of their origin in 1570s Oudenaarde. They are woven in wool and silk at twelve warps per inch, with around 20 percent silk to 80 percent wool, which puts them at the middle to lower end of the Flemish tapestry market at this period; the Medici <italic>Gideon</italic> set, woven in Brussels, has eighteen warps per inch and around 30 percent silk.<sup>21</sup> The Hardwick tapestries have faded considerably, and in those that have been cleaned and restored pale blue, yellow, and grayish tones dominate. The cleaning and conservation process has revealed the astonishing strength of the colors that survive on the reverse of the tapestries, protected by lining since they were in Hatton’s ownership. A comparison of the colors on the front and the reverse reveals that the yellow and blue tones have simply faded and become paler with time, while a deep pinkish-red color has completely disappeared (figs. 20, 21). Dye analysis has revealed the use of three main dyes: indigotin, luteolin, and lichen purple.<sup>22</sup> Indigo and luteolin were standard blue and yellow dyes in the medieval and early modern cloth industry;<sup>23</sup> however, lichen purple was not so widely used, partly because it was known to fade much more quickly than most other natural dyes—so much so that its use was prohibited in some cloth-producing centers.<sup>24</sup> In the <italic>Gideon</italic> tapestries this dye seems to stand in for the more expensive red dyes such as cochineal and madder, which commonly appear in higher-quality Brussels tapestries of similar date.<sup>25</sup> The absence of madder in the <italic>Gideon</italic> tapestries and the fading resulting from the use of lichen purple are evidence of debased production standards, and would certainly have affected the cost of the tapestries.<fig id="fg20" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>A second major discovery made during conservation is that the tapestries have been substantially retouched with paint. This is especially visible in areas of foliage and on the borders, where outlines have been reinforced with dark brown lines. This retouching occurs fairly uniformly over the entire field of the designs, and it is used exclusively to strengthen outlines, not for shading (fig. 22). As Sophie Schneebalg-Perelman has shown, there is evidence that tapestries were routinely retouched with paint at Oudenaarde and other Flemish centers during the sixteenth century.<sup>26</sup> The most extreme cases involved painting in faces that were woven blank, or painting in large areas of background, and complaints about such practices from foreign merchants led to an edict regulating paint use in Brussels in 1525.<sup>27</sup> In 1539, following further complaints, the regent of the Netherlands, Mary of Hungary, began an extensive investigation that involved the confiscation of large numbers of tapestries from Brussels, Enghien, Oudenaarde, and elsewhere. Finally the Oudenaarde City Elders wrote to Mary in protest, arguing that retouching had long been part of standard practice in the manufacture of tapestries in Oudenaarde, and that in any case no regulations had ever been in place in their city forbidding it.<sup>28</sup> The confiscated tapestries were released, and a series of draft regulations was drawn up and would form the basis of a nationwide edict in 1544. The new regulations specified that tapestries could be retouched only in the city in which they were woven; that retouching could be done only by a specialized “lustreur” or by a master dyer; that the only liquid colors permitted were “encre” and “follegraine”; and that these materials could be used only to mark the contours of fruits, leaves, nude bodies, and so on, but not to add things that had not already been woven.<sup>29</sup> The retouching evident on the <italic>Gideon</italic> tapestries appears to follow these regulations to the letter, being restricted to dark brown (“encre”), and to the outlines of fruit and foliage.<fig id="fg22" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>The coarse weave, extensive surface retouching, and use of defective dyestuffs in the Hardwick <italic>Gideon</italic> tapestries are typical of Oudenaarde production in the late sixteenth century and are not surprising in themselves, but these characteristics sit uneasily with the vast scale and bespoke nature of the set as a whole. We are used to sets of this scale being commissioned by princes and kings from brand new cartoons, and woven to the highest standards with quantities of silk and gold thread, while smaller tapestries produced for the market commonly have the coarse weave and simple palette of the <italic>Gideon</italic> set. It took an unusual client of great ambition but limited time to produce the <italic>Gideon</italic> tapestries: a man who desired to create a magnificent effect as quickly and as cheaply as possible, and who was perhaps not overly concerned with the judgment of posterity.</p>

         <title>Sir Christopher Hatton</title>
         <p>That man was Sir Christopher Hatton (c. 1540–91), whose arms appear in the center of each border of the <italic>Gideon</italic> tapestries (fig. 23). The son of a Northamptonshire squire of moderate means, Hatton reputedly came to the attention of Elizabeth I through his skill at dancing. He quickly rose to a position of confidence with the queen, who showered him with gifts and lucrative sinecures, not to mention honors and political appointments. His rapid rise led one contemporary to describe him as “a mere vegetable of the Court, that sprung up at night, and sunk again at his noon.”<sup>30</sup> In the mid-1570s Hatton began rebuilding his family seat of Holdenby Hall on a vast scale with the self-stated aim of creating a palace for his queen; in one letter he even boasted that he would leave Holdenby “still unseen until the holy saint may sit in it, to whom it is dedicated.”<sup>31</sup> Holdenby’s size and grandeur were legendary even before it was completed, coining the epithet “as bright as Holdenby” for its many glittering windows, and for the few decades that the house survived it was the largest private residence in England.<sup>32</sup> It was almost certainly for the long gallery at Holdenby that the <italic>Gideon</italic> tapestries were commissioned.<sup>33</sup> In 1578, the date woven into the <italic>Gideon</italic> tapestries, Hatton was monitoring the troubled political situation in the Netherlands and was in constant communication with diplomats in Brussels and elsewhere, giving him ample opportunity to arrange a tapestry commission.<sup>34</sup> By this date Holdenby’s ground plan was laid out and the walls built up to the first story. A survey of the house made in 1606 indicates the position and size of a long gallery on one of the upper floors.<sup>35</sup> This gallery was 160 feet long and 22 feet wide, with a protrusion of approximately 30 by 25 feet in the center (fig. 24). The courtyard wall would have been almost entirely taken up by windows, so there would have been a total of about 260 feet of wall space.<sup>36</sup> The total length of the <italic>Gideon</italic> series (including now-missing borders) would have been around 236 feet, enough to fill the long gallery at Holdenby, with doors and fireplaces accounting for the remaining 26 feet. Like the gallery at Hardwick where the tapestries now hang, Holdenby’s gallery must have been double-height, to accommodate the height of the tapestries.<fig id="fg23" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>We are left to guess what role the <italic>Gideon</italic> tapestries played in the iconographical scheme at Holdenby, but one intriguing possibility is suggested in the personal correspondence between Hatton and Elizabeth I. In his letters Hatton portrayed himself as a perpetual suitor, styling himself as a knight with untiring devotion to his queen and engaging in an elaborate rhetoric of chivalric compliment. As part of this rhetoric Hatton referred to himself as her “sheep” or her “mutton,” one of many examples of punning pet names used by Elizabeth for her favorites. For example, a letter from Hatton to the queen of 1573 refers to the Earl of Oxford, whose crest was a boar: “Reserve it to the Sheep, he hath no tooth to bite; where the Boar’s tusk may both rase and tear.”<sup>37</sup> On another occasion the queen reassured Hatton “that you should remember she was a Shepherd, and then you might think how dear her Sheep was unto her.”<sup>38</sup> Comic though it may seem, the choice of the story of Gideon, with its cipher of a mutton’s fleece, may have been dictated by nothing more than a punning courtly game. It seems likely that Hatton intended to commission his tapestries from existing designs, rather than having a new series designed, with the additional time and cost that this would have entailed. Few available sets of cartoons could have been expanded to fit the vast dimensions of his projected long gallery at Holdenby, and, faced with what was probably quite a limited choice, the story of Gideon, with its strategically important sheep, would have appealed for obvious reasons. But if he did not commission the cartoons, Hatton did his best to personalize the <italic>Gideon</italic> tapestries. He determined their enormous scale and the size of each panel; and he made sure that his elaborate coat of arms, which he had paid a genealogist to fabricate in 1572, was woven no less than four times on each tapestry.<sup>39</sup> Hatton’s ownership was reinforced by the initials “CH” woven into the lower galloons (fig. 25) and embroidered, the letters taking exactly the same form, through the lining in blue linen thread (fig. 26).<sup>40</sup>

         <p>If Hatton was in debt before he began rebuilding Holdenby, by the time the building was finished he had effectively bankrupted himself. On his death in November 1591 his estates, and his debts of over £40,000, were settled on his nephew Sir William Newport, who changed his name to Hatton on inheriting.<sup>41</sup> William Hatton kept Holdenby but stripped and sold the contents to pay off his uncle’s debts.</p>

         <title>The Tapestries in Bess’s Time</title>
         <p>The <italic>Gideon</italic> tapestries were purchased from William Hatton by the Countess of Shrewsbury in 1592, and were intended to hang in the long gallery at Hardwick New Hall, which Bess had begun building a year earlier.<sup>42</sup> The house was intended as a legacy for Bess’s second and favorite son, William, and the dynasty she hoped he would found. Construction began within weeks of the death of Bess’s estranged fourth husband, the Earl of Shrewsbury, in November 1590, and proceeded, as the surviving building accounts show, at record pace.<sup>43</sup> The detailed inventory drawn up in 1601, five years before Bess’s death, shows that rich textiles dominated the interiors at Hardwick, not just for furnishings and bed coverings but also for the walls of every major room. This contrasts markedly with Chatsworth, whose building Bess had overseen three decades earlier, and where the main staterooms were lined with inlaid paneling. At Hardwick Bess was an old woman in a hurry, and elaborate woodwork took too long to make: instead she filled the house with embroidered textiles garnered from her other properties, and with secondhand tapestries bought on the open market.</p>
         <p>The <italic>Gideon</italic> tapestries were bought on a trip to London undertaken a year to the day after the death of the Earl of Shrewsbury, possible after an official period of mourning. The goal of the trip was to secure Bess’s legal ownership of her estates, which was being challenged by her stepson Gilbert Talbot.<sup>44</sup> She also took the opportunity to buy furnishings and other material for the new house. Bess bought quantities of plate and jewels from various sources including, in January 1592, William Hatton,<sup>45</sup> and she also bought tapestries of the <italic>Story of Abraham, Tobias</italic>, and <italic>Verdures</italic>, as well as embroidered hangings.<sup>46</sup> Finally, in the week of 9 July 1592, just a few weeks before returning to Hardwick, Bess bought the <italic>Gideon</italic> tapestries. The purchase is recorded in her accounts as follows: <disp-quote>

         </p>
         <p>The number of seventeen tapestries almost certainly includes the thirteen <italic>Gideon</italic> tapestries and a second set of four tapestries of <italic>Old Testament Subjects</italic>, very similar in quality to the <italic>Gideon</italic> set and also woven with Hatton’s arms, which were in their present location in the withdrawing room at Hardwick by 1601.<sup>48</sup> Following the purchase Bess traveled home to Derbyshire, stopping on the way at Holdenby, where she no doubt contemplated the former site of her new tapestries and compared it with the long gallery she herself was building at Hardwick.<sup>49</sup> The tapestries themselves were transported separately, and were perhaps included in a load of goods that arrived at Hardwick from London in February 1593.<sup>50</sup>
         </p>
         <p>The rebate granted to Bess on the price of the tapestries “for makinge of new Armes” is testament to the importance of heraldic display on large-scale tapestry sets at this time, but also to the priorities of the purchaser. Bess famously managed to turn the situation to her advantage by employing one of her servants, Abraham Sheldon, to paint rather than weave new coats of arms, which cost her a mere £1.10.4d, as opposed to the £5.9.9d she had gained on the price of the tapestries.<sup>51</sup> The technique was to apply a patch of woolen cloth painted with Bess’s arms over Hatton’s shield, and to convert his crest, a golden hind, into the Cavendish crest, a stag, by painting it brown and adding antlers (see figs. 23, 25).<sup>52</sup> The new arms were added in July 1598, and the tapestries were hung shortly afterwards.<sup>53</sup> The <italic>Gideon</italic> tapestries appear in the long gallery in the 1601 inventory of Hardwick and have remained there virtually untouched ever since, save for the gradual accretion of portraits hanging on top of them.<sup>54</sup> Some have suggested that the <italic>Gideon</italic> tapestries actually dictated the size of Hardwick’s long gallery, but this cannot be true, as the house was built to second-floor level when they were purchased.<sup>55</sup> What is certain, however, is that their size and decoration influenced the interior modeling of the room, where the cornice and the tops of the two chimneypieces are exactly level with the tops of the tapestries, which hang to the ground, and the space between the two chimneypieces is exactly wide enough to accommodate the two largest tapestries. The painted decoration above the cornice also seems to refer to the decoration of the tapestry borders, including strap work and suspended ribbons that appear nowhere else in the house, and in the carved figures of Justice and Charity on the two chimneypieces we see echoes of the figures of Justice and Minerva in the tapestry borders.</p>
         <p>The <italic>Gideon</italic> tapestries were the largest and most expensive single item purchased for Hardwick, and were intended for what was arguably the most important site of display in the house. The long gallery was the centerpiece of a series of state rooms on the second floor, which included a presence chamber (known as the high great chamber) with a throne and canopy, a state bedroom, and a withdrawing room. The long gallery and high great chamber are both double-height, and the latter is decorated with a prominent royal coat of arms, indicating readiness for a potential visit from Elizabeth I. Significantly, the high great chamber and withdrawing room were also decorated with Flemish tapestries with historical or mythological subjects, while embroidered or woven hangings, and verdure tapestries, tended to be used in Bess’s own apartments and other more private spaces. While the other state apartments were probably used infrequently, the long gallery would have had an important role in the life of the household. As Coope has shown, the Elizabethan long gallery was a site of recreation, exercise, and communication, and also an intermediary space between the public and private realms of a large household; but above all it was a space of display. For these reasons the decoration of the walls was a question of paramount importance.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>Although the Hardwick <italic>Gideon</italic> tapestries are one of a number of repetitions of designs first woven for Cosimo de’ Medici, they are by no means debased copies. The designs have been significantly enlarged to create a tapestry set that was and still is exceptional in its scale and monumental ambition. Recent histories have noted that from the 1570s the effects of war and emigration meant that the large-scale figural tapestry sets of the mid-sixteenth century were largely abandoned in the Flemish weaving centers, and producers increasingly favored smaller, more decorative works with landscapes and small figures that were cheaper and easier to produce.<sup>56</sup> The <italic>Gideon</italic> tapestries thus represent one of the last great narrative tapestry sets produced in the sixteenth century, not just in Oudenaarde but in the Netherlands as a whole. This exceptional enterprise was an expression of the unrelenting showmanship of one of Elizabeth I’s most enigmatic and devoted courtiers, Sir Christopher Hatton. From relatively modest beginnings he rose to a position of unrivaled confidence with the queen, amassed great wealth and even greater debts, and built the largest palace of his age, Holdenby Hall; on his death his family sank back into relative obscurity, and his palace was dismantled soon after. The <italic>Gideon</italic> tapestries represent one of the few surviving relics of what must have been a truly breathtaking environment at Holdenby. This aspect of their history is astonishing enough, but another chapter began on Hatton’s death when the <italic>Gideon</italic> tapestries were bought by Bess of Hardwick: often celebrated as the second-richest woman of her age (after the queen), she was certainly the foremost female collector of decorative textiles in sixteenth-century England. The <italic>Gideon</italic> tapestries were installed at the newly built Hardwick Hall in the most important public space in the house, the long gallery. All traces of Hatton’s ownership were quickly obliterated and the tapestries subsumed into the dynastic rhetoric of Hardwick’s interior scheme by replacing the Hatton arms, themselves of dubious legitimacy, with those of Hardwick—arms which Bess as a woman was not technically permitted to bear. The tapestries themselves are today a shadow of their former selves, but this is a reflection of the brilliant but fleeting character of Hatton’s enterprise; their survival in the long gallery at Hardwick for the past four hundred years is, however, a testament to the lasting reach of Bess’s ambition.</p>
