<plain_text><page sequence="1">Of What One Cannot Speak: Doris Salcedo's Political Art by Mieke Bal University of Chicago Press, 2010 Reviewed by Robert J. Belton Mieke Bal would be the first to admit that readers interested in "standard" art historical approaches to the work of Colombian political artist Doris Salcedo would be wise to look elsewhere. Indeed, she suggests several alternatives throughout Of What One Cannot Speak, all of which are more conventionally informative about the art in question (for example, by identifying the original context in which the works were made and by offering different explanatory frameworks).1 Bal differentiates her approach in several important ways: As in her previous books, she is not particularly interested in the artisf s intentions (2-3), she is not interested in recounting the specific details of the violent events that haunt Salcedo (57), and she uses Salcedo's work not as an end in itself but as a means to identify and describe the conditions that make any art political. In other words, she is not defining what is political in Salcedo's work but "moving through that work to make visible some features that enhance the chances that art can manage to be political" (246). Like someone refusing to be pinned down to a fairly obvious point of view, Bal maintains that her book is not a biog raphy, a monograph, or a theoretical trea tise (5). Well, it certainly isn't a biogra phy—readers interested in the details of Salcedo's life will be completely disap pointed—but it very clearly is both a monograph (a scholarly work on a single topic) and a speculative exercise concern ing what makes political art political. The book is fluidly written and cogently argued, yet it is deeply intersubjective. It escapes me, however, why that would disqualify it from being a theoretical trea tise. If nothing else, the frequency of the oretical-forerunner-name-dropping— Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Hubert Damisch, Gilles Deleuze, and Ludwig Wittgenstein loom especially large—marks it unmistakably as a contri bution to a postmodern ontology of art, or at least the political subset thereof. In Bal's view, art is not political because it (a) depicts or is otherwise "about" politics, (b) is sponsored or cen sored by a state in such a way that the latter's identity colors that of the artist or artwork, (c) makes a statement concern ing what she calls a one-issue protest, or (d) represents violent events or their effects (58-60). Instead, art can become political if it (1) enables "metaphoring," (2) fosters anthropomorphism, (3) pro duces an elastic, if not anachronistic, sense of time that flows in both direc tions, (4) exists in a space whose open endedness allows intersubjectivity to happen, and (5) cuts across types of memory to produce projective identifica tion with political trauma as a liberating phenomenon. These five themes, each corresponding to one of the five chapters of the book, are so densely argued that they need to be unpacked a little in order to understand how they recombine in the end. In chapter one, Bal uses what she calls "a non-existent verb, to metaphor" to refer to the process in which meaning Vi T I ' "f .4 !j K V i' Ï! T b 7* i V »fgh v &gt; k n M m + I K Fig. 1.

She writes, [B]etween maker and viewer, something happens that cannot be of the order of understanding only. For art to be politically effective ... its context of emergence, not necessarily knowable to the receiver, must somehow be "translated" into a context from within which the receiver might be sensitive to the work's urgency. This mediation takes place through the activity of "metaphoring" (33).2 © WOMAN'S ART JOURNAL t k i I *t 4 } K V4 X.</page><page sequence="2">In metaphoring, viewers take on the responsibility of generating meaning in collaboration with the work and the various contexts in which both sender and receiver exist. (This, of course, is intersubjectivity.) The Salcedo work that captures Bal's attention in this regard is the very well known Atrabiliarios (1992-93; Fig. 1), a variable installation in which slightly worn women's shoes are propped up in niches veiled by animal hides seemingly stitched to the wall with surgical thread. That the shoes are fashionable confounds simplistic thematic comparison to working class shoes (e.g., Vincent van Gogh), as might be attempted by a conventional art historian. Similarly, that the shoes are veiled prevents comparison to, say, Andy Warhol's shoes, thus confounding readings of them as an indictment of consumer culture. However, despite these disambiguating constraints, Bal concludes that the presence and unique context of the viewer reambiguate the work in a manner that increases its political potential as a site of fluid interaction rather than a fixed depiction of a political event. Chapter two develops the type of political reambiguation that Bal calls "anthropomorphism." This is an imagi native projection that leads to intersubjective metaphoring by inter preting works as implicitly humanoid. For instance, a portion of La Casa Viuda II (1993-94) consists of a door being pene trated by a smallish cabinet that has a zipper in an unexpected place. Despite no resemblance at all, Bal sees it as "a bent-over figure inside the cabinet ... , forever imprisoned in a cruelly confin ing space ... , a figure in blue jeans bending over" (105). Salcedo herself pointed out this was "'wrong' in terms of the work's genesis and its representa tional clarity" (106). Bal, however, had earlier concluded that "even ... 'wrong' interpretations can do their political work simply by holding the viewer to her agency" (71). In consequence, she argues that her "wrong" insight "is 'right' in that it did the political work of [moving] me to bring in my own bag gage ... [in a] process of affective contagion" (106-07). Bal associates this contagion with Deleuze's "encountered sign: a sign that enforces thought" (105) but does "not prescribe what to think" (108). In other words, getting the details right is less important than being moved to imagine a performative identification with violence in a manner that the author regrettably characterizes as "homeopath ic"—that is, indulging imaginatively in a little bit of violence "cures" us of indulging in a lot (97). Needless to say, we are very far away indeed from any notion of political art as merely some thing "about" politics. Chapter three reintroduces one of Bal's older ideas and a new one. The first is her redefinition of the Baroque as not a period in art history but a "visual philos ophy or perception through the body" (143). One consequence is that a pair of Caravaggio paintings "seem to change into a post-Salcedo commentary" (148).3 This creative anachronism gives priority to audience over artist, and that's accept able to a degree. That kind of trade-off is a key part of intersubjectivity, after all. The second idea is a little harder to swal low. She introduces the concept of temporal foreshortening—a kind of col lapsing of the past into the present that facilitates the "affective contagion" of the previous chapter: "Foreshortened time is distorted—made wider or thicker—and condensed. It thus comes forward to touch the viewer, so that she experiences the almost tangible pull of time" (149). Bal needs this idea to support her conta gion/homeopathy metaphor, so she bolsters it by arguing that tire reductive definition of foreshortening in conven tional art history doesn't account for its putative existence outside of the realm of linear perspective: "With foreshorten ing," she writes, "the mode of the artwork shifts away from representation, with all its illusions, into a realm of per formance that binds the work to the viewer. I cannot help but see the trick ... [but] I willfully allow it to impose engagement" (143). Well, this is just inane. The whole point of foreshortening is to shift the mode of the artwork towards representation, but no educated person is fooled by the device in a way that would give substance to Bal's self-important assumption. Moreover, her assertion that foreshortening is "much older than the perspective it is alleged to serve" is both reductive—for perspective is much more than the systems described during the Renaissance—and unnecessarily cap tious. I suspect that she does this because she is compelled to find ways to dispar age art history (which she reduces to caricature on pages 68, 71, 141, 143, and, to a more implied extent, 206) in order to provide ground for an unnecessary and unhelpful metaphor. Chapters four and five treat installa tion and memory, respectively. As a formal device, installation creates ample space (both literal and figurative) for the viewer to undertake the kind of idiosyn cratic interpretation that Bal associates with political agency. For example, she criticizes an exhibition of works by a number of noted political artists (includ ing Leon Golub) for having been overcrowded to the point of stifling per sonal, imaginative projection and therefore any hope of real political agency (163). As for memory, the author condescendingly characterizes Salcedo's work as cutting across the "somewhat facile distinctions in cognitive memory theory," by which she means psycholo gy's practice of sharply distinguishing declarative or language-accessible mem ory from non-linguistic or procedural memory. Salcedo's Noviembre 6y7 (2002), in which a multitude of chairs are very slowly lowered and raised over the side of a building, shows that consigning non linguistic memory to the domain of physical routine is wrong. Predictably, mainstream psychology's error is never excused and re-established as part of a productive theory in the way that Bal's own errors are. Bal clearly feels that art that hopes to be political should not simply illustrate violence or trauma. Much less clear and convincing is her deployment of trauma theory deriving from Pierre Janet and Sigmund Freud. Janet explained the inaccessibility of trauma to memory as "horizontal" and dissociative, whereas Freud's model was "vertical" and repressive (210—ll).4 In the latter, trauma is elided—actively forgotten or pushed under the level of consciousness.5 In the former, trauma is redistributed by dissociation, which separates the unbearable from center stage and relegates it to the wings. (The image SPRING / SUMMER 2012 o</page><page sequence="3">taps into a mostly unconvincing theatre metaphor that runs through chapter five.) In both cases, "traumatic events elude subjective elaboration and remain rigorously outside the subject's grasp" (210). The goal, therefore, is to create art that fosters subjective elaboration through affective contagion in order to restore political agency to the viewer. By the way, Bal does not allude to any research indicating that trauma is never repressed in the way most trauma-based cultural theory takes for granted.6 Of What One Cannot Speak is certainly an amusing, if occasionally challenging read, for it does eventually recombine the five themes—metaphoring, anthropo morphism, time, space, and memory—to create a model of political art as projec tive identification with trauma as a liberating phenomenon. However, it will not replace works more directly focused on the background and inter pretation of Salcedo's work. Bal respects those sources to a seemingly greater degree here than in her earlier books, but she nonetheless finds it necessary to point out that their emphasis on political violence in Salcedo's native Colombia is reductive and "just a little too close to an apologetic identity politics" (92-93). The book is beautifully constructed and quite well illustrated, but I would rec ommend it only to those fascinated by Bal's unfalsifiable musings more than by Salcedo's art. • Robert J.

Bal seems to be unaware of Kuang-ming Wu's On Metaphoring: A Cultural Hermeneutic (Leiden: Brill, 2001), The term Bal adopts in other writings to describe this interpretative time-warp effect—"preposterous history"—only appears four times in this book, without elaboration. Both it and her rethinking of the Baroque are explained in more detail in her book Quoting Caravaggio: Contemporary Art, Preposterous History (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1999). Freudian scholars may note that this metaphor contradicts others in which Freud's characterization of dissociation or "splitting" is described as "horizontal" in one regard—the one involving repression— and "vertical" in another. See, for example, Heinz Kohut, The Analysis of the Self: A Systematic Approach to the Psychoanalytic Treatment of Narcissistic Personality Disorders (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1971), 176-77. This is occasionally called "motivated forgetting." See, for example, Bernard Weiner, "Motivated Forgetting and the Study of Repression." Journal of Personality 36.2 (1968): 213-34. The first major work to make this claim was Elizabeth Loftus and Katherine Ketcham, The Myth of Repressed Memory: False Memories and Allegations of Sexual Abuse (New York: St. Martin's, 1994). More recent work includes Marcia K. Johnson, Carol L. Raye, Karen J. Mitchell and Elizabeth Ankudowich, "The Cognitive Neuroscience of True and False Memories," Nebraska Symposium on Motivation 58 (2012): 15-52.</page></plain_text>
