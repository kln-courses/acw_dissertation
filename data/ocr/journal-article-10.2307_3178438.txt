<plain_text><page sequence="1">CYBORG AND ECOFEMINIST INTERVENTIONS: CHATJIF.NGES FOR AN ENVIRONMENTAL FEMINISM STACY ALAIMO The writings of Donna Haraway and the texts of ecofeminism offer radi- cally different approaches to negotiating a feminist environmentalism. Whereas ecofeminisml seeks to strengthen the bonds between women and nature by critiquing their parallel oppressions and encouraging an ethic of caring and a politics of solidarity, Haraway seeks to destabilize the nature/culture dualism that grounds the oppression of both women and nature. Ecofeminism, like other cultural feminisms, advances "female" values, but much of Haraway's work engages nature from a postmodern feminist perspective exemplified by the cyborg. Although ecofeminism espouses a "pronature" stance, Haraway's theories of "artifactualism" and the cyborg break down the divisions between nature and culture and even nature and technology, thus radically destabilizing the entire concept of "nature." Drawing upon cultural studies2 and post-Marxist theory, this article questions the ideologies of cyborgs, ecofeminists, and popular cul- ture texts in order to map out a feminist ecological position within and between the cyborg and ecofeminist poles. On the one hand, Mother Earth and ecofeminist glorifications of nature play into the pockets of pa- triarchal capitalism; on the other hand, cyborgs forsake alliances between women and nature and may bolster a destructive technophilia. Articulat- ing women and nature as agents in a mutual struggle, however, could strengthen environmental feminism's political impetus while opposing the appropriation of nature as passive resource. INI'lRVENTIONS Cultural studies, with its emphasis on intervention,3 and poststructuralist Marxist theories of "articulation" guide the following exploration: when the same ideologies of woman and nature are used for antithetical politi- Feminist Studies 20, no. 1 (spring 1994). ? 1994 by Feminist Studies, Inc. 133</page><page sequence="2">Stacy Alaimo cal purposes, how can one assess the politics of particular ideologies and intervene in ways that will benefit both feminism and environmentalism? Ideologies that feminize nature and blur the boundaries between humans and animals can be deployed for contradictory political goals. The post- Marxism of Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe accounts for this by en- visioning the social as an infinite, unfixed field of meaning; ideologies have no essential meaning or relation to class positions; what they mean depends upon how they are "articulated." They define articulation as "any practice establishing a relation among elements such that their iden- tity is modified as the result." The identity of the elements is modified because articulation partially fixes meaning.4 In contrast, Stuart Hall ar- gues that everything cannot be articulated with everything else; historical predilections shape the articulatory possibilities. Considering the histori- cal tenacity of certain ideologies and determining which ideological for- mations are more resistant to change can help determine the efficacy of interventions. 5 CRITIQUES OF ECOFEMINISM As environmental destruction increases, interest in ecofeminism grows. The new Ms. includes ecofeminism as a regular feature, and Hypatia6 re- cently devoted an entire issue to it. Yet critics charge that recent ecofemi- nist writings neglect politics. For example, Ariel Salleh critiques the latest ecofeminist anthologies: "Both Plant's Healing the Wounds (1989) and Dia- mond and Orenstein's Reweaving the World (1990) are, with the exception of one or two essays, largely preoccupied with ethics, life-style, self- realization, cultural ritual and art-this, while 465 million people starve to- day, and one more species will have died out by midnight."7 Similarly, Stephanie Lahar contends that the "reference to political praxis has de- creased relative to earlier discussions" and asks: "Can we afford not to have an action-oriented philosophy at a crisis point in social and natural history, when we are literally threatened on a global scale by annihilation by nuclear war or ecological destruction?"8 These critiques may signal a move back to the politically engaged ecofeminism exemplified by the 1983 anthology Reclaim the Earth: Women Speak Outfor Life on Earth, edited by Leonie Caldecotte and Stephanie Leland. Although the above critiques still share the basic values and goals of ecofeminism, Janet Biehl's Rethinking Ecofeminist Politics rejects ecofeminism in favor of Murray Bookchin's social ecology. Much of Biehl's dismissal stems from her repu- diation not just of women/nature metaphors but of all metaphors. "Insofar as the ecofeminist bases for ethics-interconnectedness, aliveness, 'women's 134</page><page sequence="3">Stacy Alaimo caring'-are mediated by the metaphors of 'woman=nature,' they avoid the problem of objectivity in the real world. Thus, if an ethic is to be based strictly on metaphors, it becomes wholly tenuous." She later explains that meta- phors should not found political movements because "one of the func- tions of a political movement, let alone a radical one, is to explain the world, not to obscure it."9 Biehl critiques ecofeminism from an episte- mologically simplistic ground where "reality" and "metaphor," "reason" and "myth" stand as pure polarities. But any ethics or politics- indeed, any way of thinking-is shaped via metaphors and ideologies. Instead of castigating ecofeminism's use of metaphors, it would be more produc- tive to analyze the specific effects of those metaphors within their con- text. Haraway critiques the ecofeminist positions on nature and science by analyzing them via a non-Western context. In Primate Visions: Gender, Race, and Nature in the World of Modern Science, she criticizes ecofeminism (and African-centered views on science) by comparing them with Japan- ese primatology, which shares many of the same values and methods of cultural feminism yet is antifeminist. Holism, appreciation of intuitive method, presence of "matriarchal" myth systems and histories of women's cultural innovation, cultivation of emotional and cognitive con- nection between humans and animals, absence of dualist splits in objects of knowl- edge, qualitative method subtly integrated with rigorous and long-term quantification, extensive attention to the female social organization as the infrastructure grounding more visible male activities, and lack of culturally reinforced fear of loss of personal boundaries in loving scientific attention to the world are all perfectly compatible with masculinism in epistemology and male dominance in politics.10 As striking as it is that Haraway found within Japanese primatology a correspondence to several salient points, not only in ecofeminism but in radical and cultural feminism as well, from a post-Marxist perspective, it is not surprising that all these elements can be articulated with an an- drocentric epistemology and masculinist politics. Yet, one cannot dis- miss ecofeminism in the United States by exposing its similarities to Japanese antifeminism, because ecofeminism challenges contemporary American culture, in which, holism, empathy, and "fluid ego bounda- ries" are widely coded as "feminine" and are therefore devalued terms in a gender-coded hierarchical opposition. Ecofeminism, like radical feminism, seeks to overturn such hierarchies by reversing the valences of the terms. The next sections of this article illustrate the complica- tions these reversals encounter. 135</page><page sequence="4">Stacy Alaimo EARTH MOTHER WARNS: "K EFH THOSE POTS TIGHTLY COVERED!" "Love Your Mother" demands a bumper sticker bearing the image of the planet. Mother Earth, the single most popular image of feminized na- ture, has been promoted by ecofeminism, male-dominated environmen- talism,l and capitalist patriarchy. In 1980, Carolyn Merchant, in The Death of Nature: Women, Ecology, and the Scentific Revolution, an ecofemi- nist analysis of the scientific revolution, warned about the Earth Mother image. It is not the purpose of this analysis to reinstate nature as the mother of humankind nor to advocate that women reassume the role of nurturer dictated by that historical identity. Both need to be liberated from the anthropomorphic and stereotypic labels that degrade the serious underlying issues. The weather forecaster who tells us what Mother Nature has in store for us this weekend and legal systems that treat a woman's sexuality as her husband's property are equally guilty of perpetuating a system repres- sive to both women and nature.12 This warning has gone largely unheeded by the environmental move- ments that have reclaimed this image. Although the ecofeminist celebra- tion of Mother Earth attempts to recover the image in support of a femi- nist environmentalism, portraying the earth as a mother strengthens a pa- triarchal, capitalist discourse harmfil not only to women but also to the environment.13 For example, the way Mother Earth was used in the 1990 television Earth Day Special14 undermines both the environmental and feminist movements. Mother Nature, played by floral-crowned Bette Midler, stars in this program. The basic plot of the media fest is this: poor Moth- er Earth is sick, victimized by humanity. This perfectly selfless mother doesn't really mind that she herself is dying but worries about the people who need her. She is placed in the town hospital and doctored by male physicians. Yet what saves Mother Earth is not medical science but, lo and behold, capitalist consumers and good housekeepers. The old associ- ation between women and the earth is deployed here in a contradictory way. Mother Earth is a near-dead victim, to be saved by commercial cap- italism (buying the right products); this echoes Merchant's account of how during the Scientific Revolution "living animate nature died, while dead inanimate money was endowed with life."15 The way that the show manages to articulate environmentalism with capitalism supports Hall's explanation of why the Right has been more successful than the Left in connecting with popular trends: "Their strategy has been to align the positive aspirations of people with the market and the restoration of the 136</page><page sequence="5">Stacy Alaimo capitalist ethic, and to present this as a natural alliance."16 The Earth Day Special not only supports a capitalist ethic but also a patriarchal one, be- cause it portrays the planet as a victimized female and suggests that every- day environmental problem solving is "women's work." Even though the program displays both men and women suggesting environmental solu- tions, the message of the program (and, it seems the whole mainstream Earth Day mentality)-"what you can do at home to save the earth"- places the blame and responsibility on women, who do the majority of the shopping and housecleaning. Domestic imagery makes earth saving just another domestic chore. For example, the Bundys' bad housekeeper is admonished: "Imagine that your house was the earth. If you just dust- ed your house once in a while, imagine what the earth could be like." And, as the Cosbys inform us, if we just wouldn't open the lids on stove- top pots, well save energy and save the earth. Domestic dust and escap- ing steam cloud our view of more threatening substances such as nuclear waste or incinerator smoke. Furthermore, these pat solutions to systemic problems cast environmentalism as women's work, thus tightening wom- en's domestic ties while letting corporate and governmental polluters off the hook. Ironically, the program opens with Robin Williams as a smarmy Everyman boasting of Man's great exploits, technologies, and environ- mental dominations. Williams's many phallic allusions to missiles and power worship show an ironic awareness of feminist critiques of phallo- technology. The program quickly transforms systemic shortcomings into mere personal failings, however, as Everyman and the industrial polluter who confess their misdeeds are both represented as bad boys who have disappointed their mother nature. The industrial polluter says the gov- ernment controls and the system are fine and don't need to be changed- he just has to start behaving. Mother Earth ideology here codes the earth and by feminine association, women, into passive victims at the same time that it depicts polluters as mere naughty boys, thus making the problem personal and familial instead of political and systemic. It shifts the focus from patriarchal capitalism to the home and places the blame and responsibility, not on corporate polluters, scandalous lack of govern- ment controls, or waste-oriented capitalism but ultimately on homemak- ers, who had better use cloth diapers and keep those pots fully covered. Just as patriarchal capitalism can pocket Mother Earth, a conservative environmentalism can embrace the "nurturing" discourse of ecofemi- nism. In The Conservator, the magazine of the Nature Conservancy, the title of the 1990 article, "Stewardship: Empowering the Land," juxtaposes 137</page><page sequence="6">Stacy Alaimo the conservative Christian idea that God appointed Man as the Steward of nature with the leftist language of empowerment that places the land in the position of oppressed groups, leaving us with a weird amalgama- tion of an oppressed-but-soon-to-be-empowered land with an old-timey land that needs to be managed. This article about volunteers borrows the language of ecofeminism: "Linda Wark may have articulated the leader- ship role of stewards best when she said, 'stewardship is not only the care and nurturing of natural areas, it's the care and nurturing of volun- teers."''7 Why does the Nature Conservancy, an organization seemingly untouched by feminism, here employ its "care and nurturing" language? The feminized language supports The Conservator's conservative politics: by alluding to the motherly realms of care and nurturing it places the ecological volunteer work into the sphere of the domestic, fencing it off from the public sphere of business, economics, and politics-issues that this organization, partly funded by big business, does not disturb. Deane Curtin warns that an "ethic of care provides a very important beginning for an ecofeminist ethic, but it runs the risk of having its own aims turned against it unless it is regarded as part of a distinctively feminist po- litical agenda that consciously attempts to expand the circle of caring for."18 Limiting the realm of caring to the private world leaves govern- ment and corporate polluters undisturbed. Of course, the what-I-can- do-at-home-to-save-the-earth movement has increased recycling and consumer awareness of environmental problems. People can have an effect as consumers; and women, who constitute the majority of household shoppers, may be empowered by our potential to promote ecological causes even while shopping. Yet, as beneficial as these gains may be, they are achieved with the risk that the environmental movement will get sidetracked into a depoliticized, indeed, procapitalist, privatized mode- and the potential for ecologically conscious consumerism to save the planet is limited. Thus, the ecofeminist exultations of Mother Earth and the exhortations to mother the earth are congruent with a patriarchal, capitalist politics that casts the earth as a feminized victim and throws the blame on to housekeeping, nurturing women-leaving capitalist America free to mind its own business. ADOPTING WHALES OR ADOPTING CYBORG SELVES- TRANSGRESSING THE HUMAN/ANIMAL BOUNDARY Misogynist caged-women scenes, ecofeminist animal embraces, Hara- way's postmodern cyborg, and even a whale adoption project all violate 138</page><page sequence="7">Stacy Alaimo the boundary between animals and people (especially female people). When similar myths are used for opposing ideological ends how does one assess the terrain and intervene? What meanings does the dismantling of this wall hold for feminist and environmental movements? In the 1978 Woman and Nature: The Roaring Inside Her, Susan Griffin blurs the ani- mal/woman boundary in order to create an ecofeminist subject position that supports a politics of feminist solidarity with an oppressed nature. The book begins by juxtaposing Western misogynist ideas about women with exploitive conceptions of nature to show how patriarchy has em- ployed similar systems of domination for both. The parallels between the two systems multiply their oppressive force. The odd, striking similarities take seemingly benign situations and reveal how they nourish the systems of domination. For example, in a section entitled "Love," a horse in her stall waiting for her master mirrors a housewife waiting for her husband. Though she loves her stable because of the comfort, because she can always count on it to be there, because it is her private world and it is where she rests and is fed, she waits there. It is in the stable that she waits for her rider. ... The horse has no wish for freedom. She waits the occasional visits of her master, who day after day seems more powerful, more wise, taking on a majesty the horse would never dream of for herself. When he is in her presence her thoughts are riveted on him. Lacking the complexity of a Hegelian master-slave dialectic, relying on a naive epistemology that assumes one can imagine what it is like to be a horse, this story nonetheless attempts to reveal a common ground of op- pression between the horse and the romantically enthralled, domesticated woman. Here, as elsewhere in the book, Griffin increases women's em- pathic solidarity with animals and the earth by showing how women and nature have been similarly dominated and exploited. Through this method Griffin attempts to create a feminist subject who won't just de- mand her own liberation but will demand the liberation of the earth as well. Although Griffin is often criticized as essentialist, in Woman and Na- ture at least, the bonds between animals and women are not "natural" but a carefully constructed alliance. For example, in "Mules," which com- pares mules to slave women and lower-class African Americans, Griffin writes that "nature did not create us: we were bred for domestic labor."19 Thus, Griffin's ecofeminist blurring of animal-woman boundaries strengthens feminist struggle by giving women the earth itself as a com- rade and creating a feminist subject who does not aspire to equal partici- pation in the domination and destruction of the planet. Nonetheless, Griffin erases class, race, and cultural differences when she speaks as and for a monolithic "woman." Furthermore, this woman- 139</page><page sequence="8">Stacy Alaimo animal solidarity casts animals and women as victims. That is, the blur- ring between animals and women supports the historically ingrained po- sition of women and animals as the Other to a male subject, roles that easily fit misogynist narratives of oppression. For example, in advertise- ments for animals sold for use in laboratory experiments, the animals are often pictured as feminine sexual victims, "drawn in poses and costumes that conform to gender stereotypes: subordinate female animals lure, al- lure, and invite abuse." These ads play into the rape-justification myth that women secretly want it, thereby attempting to alleviate any guilt ani- mal experimenters may have by suggesting that, like women, animals "want it" too. Andree Collard describes advertisements for animal "home cages": "The only 'animals' they are about to house are mini-skirted, white-coated women draped over the cages, stroking the metal in seeming eagerness to enter the larger ones themselves."20 Whereas Griffin and the lab-animal ads blur the boundary between women and animals, the cyborg and a whale adoption project blur the animal-human boundary. In Donna Haraway's "Manifesto for Cyborgs: Science, Technology, and Socialist Feminism in the 1980s," the utopian cyborg allows us to think of ourselves in ways that subvert the dualisms of domination. Certain dualisms have been persistent in Western traditions; they have all been systemic to the logics and practices of domination of women, people of color, nature, workers, animals-in short, domination of all constituted as others, whose task is to mirror the self. Chief among these troubling dualisms are self/other, mind/body, culture/nature, male/female, civilized/primitive, reality/appearance, whole/part, agent/resource, mak- er/made, active/passive, right/wrong, truth/illusion, total/partial, God/man.21 The cyborgian transgression of human/animal boundaries works as part of a larger project to breach the nature/culture divide and other dualisms that ground systems of domination. Since cyborgs complicate male/fe- male designations, the animal/human blurring doesn't play into misogy- nist discourse the way that blurring between women and nature does. Although cyborgs link women and men with animals in a way less prone to cooptation by domination narratives, women give up their privileged ecofeminist position as comrades with nature. Animal rights and environmental activists ofen break down the wall between animals and humans in order to gain support for their projects. Whereas the postmodern cyborg rejects the unified Western self, some environmental and animal rights movements bridge the human/animal distinction by attempting to construct animals as individuals. For exam- ple, the Whale Adoption Project addresses its fundraising letter: "Dear 140</page><page sequence="9">Stacy Alaimo Fellow Creature" and urges us to adopt whales, "not just any whales, but whales that have been identified, named, and tracked." The letter stresses the individuality of each whale, "each with distinctive markings and per- sonality," and reminds us that when we adopt whales we will be adopt- ing "not just some nameless whales, but special whales, whales you pick out." Research showing that one of the most "astonishing discoveries is that individual whales, like humans, have distinctive personalities" sup- ports this appeal.22 The letter includes a Whale Adoption list featuring the names, tail portraits, and personality sketches of each of the whales (fig. 1). Constructing the whales as individuals with personalities fosters empathy and blocks their appropriation into discourses of victimization. Ideologies of individualism, however, have historically depended upon the contrasting ground of the Other. When whales become individuals do they disrupt this pattern of domination or do humans cast less lovable life forms as the natural background from which higher subjectivity emerges? In any case, "elevating" whales to the status of "individuals" helps free them from their position as Other and denies humans their presumptuous position as the only species comprised of unique individu- als. Unfortunately, although the Whale Adoption Project blurs the ani- mal/human boundaries, it still casts the whales as inferior. They need to be "adopted" by humans, thereby relegating the species to child status. Despite this problematic recasting of power relations, whale-tail portraits discourage the domination of nature by representing animal-human affinity and kinship. GLORIMIJD, RAPED, AND ARTIFACTUAL NATURES The social organization, communicative actions, and "personality" of an- imals makes blurring boundaries between people and animals much easi- er than crossing the broader human-nature divide.23 How should an eco- logically conscious feminism engage nature? Ecofeminism, as Carolyn Merchant explains, valorizes both women and nature: "The radical form of ecofeminism is a response to the perception that women and nature have been mutually associated and devalued in western culture and that both can be elevated and liberated through direct political action."24 Par- allel to the way Luce Irigaray reverses the values of traditional female- male oppositions, ecofeminism recognizes that women and nature have long been linked in Western systems of thought, and instead of trying to break the ties that many would argue keep women oppressed, ecofemi- nists reaffirm them in order to fight for both women and nature.

Even when ecofeminists strive toward a nonessential- ist connection between women and nature, they still describe women primarily as mothers and homemakers: "Women who are responsible for their children's well-being are often more mindful of the long-term costs of quick-fix solutions. Through the social experience of caretaking and nurturing, women become attentive to the signs of distress in their com- munities that might threaten their households."25 Despite its shortcom- ings from a poststructuralist feminist perspective, ecofeminism would seem a productive oppositional discourse for contemporary U.S. culture. In Ynestra King's words (paraphrased by Judith Plant), it is a "strand of feminist thought that, indeed, was not interested in an equal share of the same old carcinogenic pie."26 Ecofeminism's conception of ordinary "fe- male" activities and experiences as the basis of planet saving could attract women who feel left behind by what they perceive as a feminist move- ment that is only concerned with women achieving "successful careers." The potential for ecofeminism to attract women who define themselves in traditional roles could benefit both the environmental and feminist movements. The ecofeminist strategy of glorifying nature promotes a more re- spectful attitude and encourages a less exploitive relationship with the earth; however, it often falls into mysticism, widening the great divide between nature and culture. Take this passage from Woman and Nature, for example: "Behind naming, beneath words, is something else. An ex- istence unnamed and unnameable." One could read these lines as ex- pressing epistemological cynicism, an awareness that language is not a natural description of reality but in part creates reality. The lines that fol- low, however, suggest an essentialist view of nature. "But in a moment that which is behind naming makes itself known. . . . Air knows grass knows water knows mud knows beetle knows frost. ... And all this knowledge is in the souls of everything, behind naming, before speaking, beneath words."27 In this utopian moment, Griffin puts forth a sort of material knowledge that precedes and exists apart from language and therefore culture. Like Luce Irigaray in "When Our Lips Speak Togeth- er,"28 she seeks to express something that cannot be expressed within pa- triarchal discourse. Yet the crucial difference is that whereas Irigaray con- tinually marks the impossibility of her project with ironic linguistic fail- ures, Griffin plants hers in a mystical realm that solidifies the nature/cul- ture divide. Mystically, poetically, Griffin emerges into the world of na- ture, leaving language behind, thus reinforcing the vision of nature as an 143</page><page sequence="12">Stacy Alaimo unsullied, distant realm. Octavia Butler, in Adulthood Rites and Imago,29 shares Griffi's ecofeminist epistemology that prevents the separation of the knower from the known, a relationship she embodies in her science fiction creatures. The Oankalis Butler creates don't perceive the world through vision, which separates the knower from the known, but through sensory organs that, with a certain eroticism, taste and feel the world around them. In contrast to Buter's more concrete portrayal of an alternative epistemology, Griffin's work evokes a mysticism that retains the dualism between nature and culture. Although the ecofeminist glorification of nature seems fruitful for a culture in which nature is dangerously exploited, glorifying nature by mystifying it may fortify a discursive chain inimical to ecofeminism. A recent commercial for "Navajo" trucks30 begins with a male "Indian- sounding" voice saying: "He stirs." The "Indian" voice presumably au- thorizes this as nonracist. Fast-paced images coupled with dramatic drumming then appear: a misty kiva, suggesting the unconscious (kivas aren't Navajo, incidentally); a beautiful, "mysterious" sand painting; vari- ous shots of the landscape; and the "Oriental," seductive Native Ameri- can woman. Interspersed with these "mysterious" images of Indians and nature are shots of a man breaking a horse and a truck climbing up a steep hill, suggesting a narrative of domination. In the final scene the truck stands triumphantly in the center; on the right side of the screen the man's groin thrusts further and further into the foreground, as a woman sings: "It justfeeeels right." Emotional naturalness justifies rape, as the white man with his powerful machine and his phallus conquer the glorified Native American woman, the horse, and nature. Here, glorify- ing Native American culture, nature, animals, and women does not truly valorize them but, instead, transforms them into the exotic, sexualized feminine Other, in order to eroticize the conquering by making the man, his phallus, and his truck feel more masculine, powerful, and solidly "real" by contrast. Just because ecofeminist glorifications of nature, emotion, and women can be rearticulated into a racist, phallocentric truck commercial does not of course mean they are inherently counterproductive, because the erotics of domination that cast woman, nature, and Native Americans as the mystified Other precede ecofeminism; ecofeminism attempts to sub- vert this system by speaking from the position of woman, or even, from the position of nature. However, attempts to valorize women and nature via glorification and mystification may only bind them more securely to narratives of phallic domination. 144</page><page sequence="13">Stacy Alaimo Merchant and Haraway disrupt this narrative by casting nature as an active agent, not an ahistorical, passive resource for human domination. Despite Ynestra King's charge that socialism "accept[s] the anthropocen- tric notion that humanity should dominate nature and that the increasing domination of nonhuman nature is a precondition for true human free- dom,"31 Haraway and Merchant envision a socialist feminism that doesn't exploit nature. Merchant defines environmentalist socialist feminism: "Socialist feminism views change as dynamic, interactive, and dialectical, rather than as mechanistic, linear, and incremental. Nonhuman nature is dynamic and alive. As a historical actor, nature interacts with human be- ings through mutual ecological relations."32 By refiguring nature as an agent, Merchant destabilizes the categories of active and passive, resource and user, casting nature as an actor on the historical stage. Haraway re- veals how envisioning the agency of nature has epistemological-political consequences. Redefining the concept of "objectivity" as critical posi- tioning, she states: "Situated knowledges require that the object of knowledge be pictured as an actor and agent, not as a screen or a ground or a resource, never finally as slave to the master that closes off the di- alectic in his unique agency and his authorship of'objective' knowledge." Not surprisingly, Haraway does not promote the Earth Mother; she visu- alizes nature instead as the Coyote, which, like the cyborg, is not overtly gendered. Ecofeminists have perhaps been most insistent on some version of the world as active subject, not as resource to be mapped and appropriated in bourgeois, Marxist, or mas- culinist projects.... There are, however, richly evocative figures to promote feminist visualizations of the world as witty agent. We need not lapse into appeals to a primal mother resisting her translation into resource. The Coyote or Trickster, as embodied in Southwest native American accounts, suggests the situation we are in when we give up mastery but keep searching for fidelity, knowing all the while that we will be hoodwinked.... I like to see feminist theory as a reinvented coyote discourse obli- gated to its sources in many heterogeneous accounts of the world.33 The Coyote Trickster not only resists glorified mystification, the Coyote also destabilizes the dualism of active/passive, resource/user, knower/ known on which an epistemology and a politics of domination is based. The Coyote, like the human, is both part of nature and a creator of "ar- tifactual" nature. Haraway's theory of "artifactualism" further upsets the walls between nature and culture by figuring nature as something made, not something existing "out there" in some pure form. Conceiving of nature as made, as artifactual, seems to risk a wholesale appropriation of nature by culture, yet Haraway defines nature as "made, but not entirely by humans; it is a co-construction among humans and non-humans." 145</page><page sequence="14">Stacy Alaimo The nonhumans have their own way of participating in this "co-con- struction": "for our unlike partners, well, the action is 'different,' perhaps 'negative' from our linguistic point of view, but crucial to the generativi- ty of the collective. It is the empty space, the undecidability, the wiliness of other actors, the 'negativity."'34 Artifactualism recognizes the agency of nature without personifying it into a mirror of human actions. Desta- bilizing the grounds of appropriation and domination by emphasizing the agency of nature and thus breaking down the borders between sub- jects and objects, nature and culture is an immense project, but one po- tentially rewarding for environmental feminism. Whereas ecofeminist glorifications of nature risk cooptation, the Coyote's destabilizing tricks may transform the very terrain that encourages exploitation. OUR MACHINES, OUR SELVES: HOW TO BE A CYBORG IN A NUCLEAR AGE In her utopian essay, "A Manifesto for Cyborgs," Haraway celebrates the feminist possibilities of embracing technology by blurring the human/ machine boundaries. In doing so, she radically departs from much femi- nist sentiment and theory that demonizes technology. In "Seeing Ele- phants: The Myths of Phallotechnology," for example, Jane Caputi dis- cusses the evils of popular images of technology. Her argument assumes a series of oppositions-technology/reality, machine/nature, man/woman- and concludes with an epistemologically and politically simplistic plea that we "see through the unrealities, the deceptions." The blurring of humans and machines is one of these "deceptions": "Under the influ- ences of such metaphors, humans and machines slur/blur ever into one another, the humans becoming more cold, the machines acquiring soul."35 Octavia Butler reveals her unease with machines by replacing them with organic beings in her future world: Chkahichdahk, an ani- mal-like space ship, has a circulatory system and flesh; also, "plants" as "big as high-rise office buildings" grow "living quarters, storage space, in- ternal support structures . . . food, clothing, and other desired substances such as paper."36 These life forms were not manufactured by genetic "engineering" but generated from genetic transformations produced by pleasurable "tasting" and feeling. Taking ironic pleasure in blasphemy, Haraway departs from the anti- technology bent in feminism and constructs her utopian cyborg. Her boundary blurring between human and machine is based on contempo- rary material realities: "Late twentieth-century machines have made tho- 146</page><page sequence="15">Stacy Alaimo roughly ambiguous the difference between natural and artificial, mind and body, self-developing and externally designed, and many other dis- tinctions that used to apply to organisms and machines."37 Although Joan W. Scott criticizes the "scientific/technological determinism in the essay which echoes back to arguments about base and superstructure,"3 Haraway's cyborg myth is not determined by technology; instead, it imaginatively deploys technology to open up new possibilities for a post- modern feminist politics. It is not just that science and technology are possible means of great human satisfac- tion, as well as a matrix of complex dominations. Cyborg imagery can suggest a way out of the maze of dualisms in which we have explained our bodies and our tools to ourselves. ... It means both building and destroying machines, identities, categories, relationships, spaces, stories.39 More specifically, Haraway argues that the cyborg, precisely by blur- ring human-machine boundaries, can discourage the worship of tech- nology and encourage a greater responsibility among humans for ma- chines: "The machine is not an it to be animated, worshiped and domi- nated. The machine is us, our processes, an aspect of our embodiment. We can be responsible for machines; they do not dominate or threaten us. We are responsible for boundaries; we are they."40 But thinking of machines as part of ourselves doesn't necessarily mean that the machines won't be worshiped or feared. Caputi describes several amazing examples of "phallotechnology," confirming feminist suspicions that phallus wor- ship propels the technology of destruction. For example, an ad featuring a huge closeup of a fighter plane's "control stick" reads: Pilot and aircraft are one. He thinks; the plane responds.... Systems and human engi- neering . . . have coupled the pilot with the world's most advanced avionics through an anatomically designed control stick. All vital controls are strategically positioned on the stick and throttle.... The competitive edge is his. Similarly, Caputi cites Ronald Reagan's scheme for the Los Angeles Raiders: "If you would turn them over to us, we'd put them in silos and we wouldn't have to build the MX missile." She comments: "Idealized virility is thus gleefully fused to weaponry and to an unprecedented and earth-destroying lethality."41 Carol Cohn analyzes a multitude of phallic, even orgasmic, images in the "technostrategic discourse" of nuclear weapons.42 The super bowl-like television coverage of the 1991 war in the Persian Gulf enthusiastically diagrammed, pictured, and praised mis- siles and other weapons. One episode showed a fighter pilot picking out a special missile, stroking it, and honoring it by signing it with a dedica- tion to his wife. Thus, if Haraway's argument for machine/body blurring 147</page><page sequence="16">Stacy Alaimo is to make our machines less threatening, more controllable, less Other, a phallocentric discourse has already accomplished these goals with a de- structive twist. What these examples show is perhaps obvious. In this cul- ture the predominant ideology connected to the blurring of machines and humans is one of masculinist force and domination, an erotics of power particularly terrifying in a nuclear age. This seems like an insur- mountable difficulty for the feminist cyborg. Feminism could benefit from an alliance with technology's cultural power, but could such a femi- nism be separated from phallotechnology in order to open up the possi- bility of a feminist cyborg? Are the pleasures of boundary confusion ap- pealing enough to disengage a technophilic ideology from a phallocentric politics of domination, or does a feminist technophilic position merely bolster the dominant ideology of technoglorification that seems so strongly sutured to phallic domination? In other words, how can one be a cyborg in a nuclear age? This question echoes Christina Crosby's more general concern: "I wonder how a cyborg, which has multiple points of connection, knows how to say no. How can we determine the proper (although not natural, not necessary, not essential) limits and boundaries of coalitions? . . . I want a politics of exclusion as well as inclusion."43 I think it is important that feminists do not simply demonize technology; on the other hand, within a culture that worships technological power, particularly in the form of weapons, spends ghastly amounts of money fueling the military industrial complex (at the expense of women, who constitute the major- ity of the poor adults in this country), and pollutes the environment in the process, it is crucial that feminism maintain an oppositional voice against the military industrial complex. Women against Military Madness, based in Minneapolis, acts as a cy- borg feminist group in that its nonhierarchical network of women con- tinually forges new alliances between feminist concerns and various other issues including military recruiting, nuclear proliferation, poverty, racism, environmental issues, Native American rights, and whatever other issues any of their members want to tackle. Breaking down the boundary be- tween humans and machines would be of no use for them, because they vehemently oppose the ideologies that support the dangers, environmen- tal destructions, and economic waste of this nation's hugely powerful mil- itary industrial complex. If the cyborg doesn't "know how to say no" and beds with this insidious institution, the cyborg would be no ally for femi- nism and environmentalism, not to mention peace and justice. Even though Haraway recognizes that the cyborg is the "illegitimate offspring 148</page><page sequence="17">Stacy Alaimo of militarism and patriarchal capitalism," and hopes that the cyborg will, like other "illegitimate offspring," be "exceedingly unfaithful to [its] ori- gins,"44 it is doubtful that the cyborg's transgressions could disengage a technophilic ideology from a recalcitrant politics of domination. TOWARD AN ACTIVIST ALLIANCE Cyborgs, Coyotes, and other socialist feminists attempt to destabilize the epistemologies and politics of domination by transgressing and disman- tling the dualisms upon which these systems of domination are founded. The cyborg transgression of the machine/human boundary, however, seems inimical not only to an environmental feminism but also to any politics that opposes the military industrial complex. Thus, the wily Coy- ote and an artifactual nature seem more effective agents for an environ- mental politics. Although ecofeminism attempts to rearticulate the age-old associations of woman and nature in order to make them comrades in a struggle that would benefit them both, many of the connections it affirms can be readily deployed to support patriarchal capitalism and the domination of Others. The Mother Earth image feeds capitalist consumerism by playing into the hands of a public/private division that threatens to contain the political force of the environmental movement within the home. Not only Mother Earth, but any feminine image of nature carries dangers: the articulation of woman-native-animal-other is so deeply entrenched that to attempt to rearticulate those terms into a feminist environmentalism seems extremely difficult. Yet, abandoning a female connection with na- ture leaves that whole discursive field undisturbed. Leaping to a "postgen- der" environmentalism ignores the interdependent constructions of woman and nature. Simply promoting an antihierarchy stance as Murray Bookchin does in saying that "both men and nature have always been the common victims of hierarchical society"45 is not enough because some "men" have been more consistently dominated than others. Recognizing the need to critique misogynist constructions of woman and nature does not tell us whether we should ground a politics on that connection. The dangers of ecofeminism seem to result from a positive alliance that depends upon the very associations that are detrimental to both women and the earth-woman and nature as victims, women as ma- ternal, nature as a mystified pure realm. Can we construct female alliances with nature that don't mystify nature or pose women as essentially vic- tims or mothers? Perhaps Diana Fuss offers a fruitful direction. Instead of 149</page><page sequence="18">Stacy Alaimo grounding politics in affinity (which often slides into essentialist defini- tions of "woman"), an environmental feminism could ground affinity in politics. Fuss sees "politics as the basis of a possible coalition of women."46 By extension, an environmental feminism could stress possible political alliances of women and nature instead of grounding an ecofeminist poli- tics in affinities of victimization or motherhood. By envisioning women and nature as political allies, an environmental feminism would empha- size the importance of women as political activists and stress the agency of nature. Focusing on the agency of women and nature can help keep environmentalism in the political arena and can oppose the appropriation of nature as resource by stressing nature as an actor and by breaking down the nature/culture divide, thus undermining the systems of domination. By articulating both women and nature as agents in a mutual struggle in- stead of as passive victims, celebrating an activist alliance between women and nature could hamper the appropriation of other ecofeminist connec- tions into narratives of domination. Then an environmental feminism can take on both caring for and fighting for, "healing the wounds" while "re- claiming the earth."

Because cultural studies combines the relational study of a cultural object, institution, or issue with a sense of political purpose, the concept of intervention exerts a guiding force on the field. By refusing economic determinism and a definition of ideology as merely false consciousness, 150</page><page sequence="19">Stacy Alaimo Antonio Gramsci's theory of cultural battle opened the way for cultural analyses that investigate particular cultural struggles while attempting to affect them. Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe explain how the poststructuralist idea that there is no "out- side" of the text, nothing that is not discursive, broadens the possibilities for political effects and analyses: "The main consequence of a break with the discursive/extra-discursive dichotomy is the abandonment of the thought/reality opposition, and hence a major enlargement of the field of those categories which can account for social relations." (See Emesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe, Hegemony and Socialist Strategy: Towards a Radical Demoaatic Politics [London: Verso, 1985], 110.) Breaking down the thought/reality opposition casts discourse as material. Donna Haraway ex- plains that "meanings are applications; how meanings are constituted is the essence of politics. No one can constitute meanings by wishing them into existence; discourse is a material practice." See her Primate Visions: Gender, Race, and Nature in the World of Modem Sa'ence (New York: Rout- ledge, 1989), 111. The materiality of discourse both gives discourse its social force and restricts it, because "the intervention must work from within, constrained and enabled by the fields of power and knowledge that make discourse eminently material" (288). This pragmatic theory aims for in- terventions that unflinchingly accept the current social terrain in order to destabilize or restruc- ture it. Instead of emphasizing the sheer virtues of the opposition, attention turns to strategic ef- fectiveness, although determining strategic effectiveness is no straightforward task. In "Feminism, Medicine, and the Meaning of Childbirth," in Body/Politics: Women and the Discourses of Science, ed. Mary Jacobus, Evelyn Fox Keller, and Sally Shuttleworth (New York: Routledge, 1990), 132, Paula Treichler explains that any innovative structure-or a deviant definition-lives a double life, for it has grown out of a struggle with a domi- nant structure which continues to shape it, even cannibalize it. Counter-discourse does not arise as a pure au- tonomous radical language embodying the purity of a new politics. Rather it arises from within the dominant discourse and learns to inhabit it from the inside out. If a counterdiscourse arises from, works from within, and is cannibalized by the dominant dis- course, these incestuous relations may make it difficult to recognize, locate, and judge which dis- courses are fruitfully oppositional. 4.

Max Oelschlaeger, for example, although quick to dismiss ecofeminism because it would be ineffective in an androcentric world and because it falls into "feminarchy" (317), is nonetheless enamored of Mother Earth. He concludes The Idea of Wilderness: From Prehistory to the Age of Ecol- ogy (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1991) by asking: "Is the Magna Mater, who has borne in her life all the flora and fauna, a child of cosmic process? And is Sol the Father, whose photons energized the womb of the Magna Mater, himself a child? And who are we but beings who have lost their animal innocence.... We, the spoiled children of the Great Mother, we who refuse to see, to hear and heed her message, her laws" (353, emphasis added). Not only does this passage dramatize the global ecological crisis as a family quarrel, but it also portrays the masculine as an active, energizing principle and the earth (and people with wombs) as passive matter. 12.
