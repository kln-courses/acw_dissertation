<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Et la lumiere fut": The Meanings of David d'Angers's Monument to Gutenberg Michael Paul Driskel Public monuments serve a variety of functions in the dif- ferent contexts in which they are conceived and constructed. Some are peripheral to the primary social and cultural concerns of their era, while others directly intersect the most significant issues of their day. The present essay takes as its focus a project that decidedly falls into the latter category. This is a monument by David d'Angers, the most important French sculptor of the the first half of the nineteenth century, which was dedicated to Johann Gensfleich Guten- berg and inaugurated at the city of Strasbourg on 24 June 1840 (Fig. 1).' Given the prestige of the sculptor, the cultural importance of the personage honored, and the highly charged symbolic meaning of the printing press during the July Monarchy, it is strange that the work has received so little scholarly attention.2 The purpose of this essay is to examine how the monument functioned in its specific social environment and to recapture the various meanings with which it was endowed. David's bronze effigy of Gutenberg, measuring eleven feet in height (331 cm), stands on a sandstone pedestal in a former marketplace that was renamed in honor of the famous printer after the decision was made to erect his monument there. From a detail of a map published in 1842, one can see that the place Gutenberg occupies a central position in the ancient city (Fig. 2, site A). The square is located on a primary north-south axis, and the rue des Grands Arcades, the widest street in the center of town, opens onto the monument and terminates there. When one stands directly in front of the statue, its backdrop is the northeast corner of the Hotel du Commerce, a building constructed in 1585, formerly the City Hall, and one of the principal architectural monuments of the city.3 Gutenberg is shown holding up for inspection a proof sheet for his famous bible, which is inscribed with the French words from the opening of the book of Genesis (1:3), "Et la 'In content and method, this essay is closely related to my two previous articles in this journal: "Painting, Piety, and Politics in 1848: Hippolyte Flandrin's Emblem of Equality at Nimes," Art Bulletin, LXVI, 1984, 270-285, and "Singing 'The Marseillaise' in 1840: The Case of Charlet's Censored Prints," Art Bulletin, LXIX, 1987, 604-625. Its relevance to the first article lies in the fact that both investigate the social meanings and functions of monumental works of art executed in the 1840s in provincial centers in France riven by opposed political ideologies and by conflicts between Catholics and Protestants. The second article is relevant to the present one in concerning the theme of freedom of the press and its political context in France in 1840, the date that David d'Angers's Monument to Gutenberg was inaugurated, and it amplifies the discussion of the work at Strasbourg. 2 The most important interpretative work on the sculptor's career is the recent monograph by Jacques de Caso. This book provides many valuable insights and offers a paradigm of scholarly excellence for future studies of moder sculpture, but it does not discuss the Monument to Gutenberg. I am personally indebted to the author in numerous ways and it was in his graduate seminar at the University of California, lumiere fut" ("And there was light"). Behind him is a bronze replica of the printing press from which this page has issued. The printer's long beard, cascading luxuriantly down his torso toward this vellum sheet, adds to the visual complexity and appeal of the figure, whose apparel is composed of rich textural juxtapositions of fur, wool, and leather. Below the statue, on the sides of the pedestal, are four bronze bas- reliefs illustrating the benefits the printing press brought to each of the continents. The continent of Europe is posi- tioned on the front and represented by a heterogeneous assemblage of famous men who profited from Gutenberg's invention (Fig. 3). Its central position and its placement on a structure that suggests an altar table stress the sacerdotal implications given to the machine. In the relief to the right of Gutenberg, representing America, the Declaration of Inde- pendence is held aloft by Benjamin Franklin and shown to a variety of beneficiaries of the printed word (Fig. 4). To Gutenberg's left, Asia is personified by a collection of figures from all parts of the Middle and Far East who owed a debt to the invention of printing (Fig. 5). On the back of the pedestal, the end of slavery in Africa is represented (or predicted), as shackles are removed from slaves, children are returned to their mothers, and books are distributed to the newly emancipated (Fig. 6). In all four scenes the modeling is deliberately shallow, the compositions are distinctly two- dimensional, and a deliberate awkwardness is evident in the pose and placement of the figures and the representation of the locations of the actions. When the sculptor was formally asked to execute the statue is undocumented: no contract was issued by the munici- pality or the committee supervising the public subscription for the monument, since David agreed to provide the plaster models for the statue and the reliefs free of charge.4 Evi- dently he considered the work of enough importance to waive any fees for his creative labor on the project. From his Berkeley, a number of years ago, that I first encountered the art of David d'Angers. 3 For a plan of the Place Gutenberg and an elevation of the monument and the Hotel du Commerce, see C. Gourlier, Choix d'edifices publics projetes et construits en France depuis le commencement du 19e siecle, III, Paris, 1851, 32, pl. 320. 4 Funds from the public subscription and from the city government were used to pay for the cost of bronze casting, done by the Parisian firm of Soy6 et Inger Fils, which amounted to 14,000 francs for both the statue and the reliefs. David's only compensation was a present from the committee for the monument of a silver medallion by the local sculptor Kirstein. See the Archives Municipales, Strasbourg (hereafter A.M. Stg.), Div.

The claim of Strasbourg was based on circumstantial evi- dence that Gutenberg had experimented with his revolution- ary idea of employing movable metal type while residing in the city in the later 1430s and early 1440s. Mainz was his birthplace, however, and the city to which he returned in 5 In a letter dated 27 June 1837 from David to Cottard, the chair of the committee on the monument, the sculptor apologized for not having completed the model and declared that it would certainly be done by the end of the following month and that the bronze caster should be able to finish the work by October. See A.M. Stg. Div. VI, 183. 1448, and where he continued his experiments for the last twenty years of his life. In the centuries since his death, both cities had held ceremonies commemorating his invention, but Mainz became the first to honor him with a public monument when a statue by Bertel Thorvaldsen was un- veiled there on 14 August 1837 (Fig. 7).6 Modeled in Rome between 1833 and 1835 by an assistant of Thorvaldsen working from his sketches, the bronze figure in medieval dress stands in a rigidly frontal pose on his pedestal, holding his bible in one hand and movable type in the other.7 6The best study of this monument is H. Imiela, "Das Gutenberg Denkmal von Bertel Thorvaldsen in Mainz," in Bertel Thorvaldsen: Untersuchungen zu seinem Werk und zur Kunst seiner Zeit, Cologne, 1977, 367-384. 7The monument also includes two narrative bas-reliefs by Thorvaldsen on the pedestal. In one, Gutenberg examines a sheet that has emerged from his press, and in the other he shows his movable type to an assistant, who leans on the carved planks that were used before his invention. These works contain none of the libertarian message found in David d'Anger's reliefs.</page><page sequence="4">362 THE ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 1991 VOLUME LXXIII NUMBER 3 3 David d'Angers, Europe, bronze relief, detail of the Monu- ment to Gutenberg (photo: the author) 5 David d'Angers, Asia, bronze relief, detail of the Monument to Gutenberg (photo: the author) 4 David d'Angers, America, bronze relief, detail of the Monu- ment to Gutenberg (photo: the author) Not long after the inauguration of the monument at Mainz, the French journal Le Magasin pittoresque described the ceremony in glowing terms and reproduced what it claimed was the first engraving of Thorvaldsen's statue.8 It also announced that when David d'Angers's monument was completed at Strasbourg, one would have the opportunity to make a comparison between works representing the same theme by the two most distinguished sculptors of the epoch. There appears to be no evidence that David d'Angers actually saw the statue by Thorvaldsen, but he surely knew the engraving of the work. And inasmuch as he disliked the sculpture of Thorvaldsen, it may be concluded that he expended so much effort on this unremunerative project explicitly in order to surpass his rival.9 More important, however, is the likelihood that certain formal qualities in his own work are the result of his attempt to establish the difference of his conception from that of the Danish sculptor. Thus, David's richly caparisoned figure, who offers a page from his book to the implied beholder, is almost baroque in contrast to Thorvaldsen's austerely iconic effigy, who clutches his bible close to his body and whose form is tightly contained in a stiff overcoat with heavy, columnar folds. 8Anon., "Inauguration de la statue de Gutenberg a Mayence," Le Magasin pittoresque, vI, March 1838, 89-90. 9 For his opinion of Thorvaldsen's art, see Les Carnets de David d'Angers, I, 362, Notebook 28, dated 1835. 6 David d'Angers, Africa, bronze relief, detail of the Monument to Gutenberg (photo: the author) The Printing Press as a Republican Symbol While pride of place may have provided the initial motive force in the construction of the Gutenberg Monument, the great importance that the printing press assumed in the rhetoric of the political opposition during theJuly Monarchy must be considered a contributing factor. The struggles of the political and satirical press with the regime of Louis- Philippe in the early years of the July Monarchy, both before and after the so-called "September Laws" of 1835 reestab- lished censorship, have been recounted frequently and need not be dwelt upon here.?1 It will suffice to state that the printing press came to be considered both a fundamental political weapon and a symbol worthy of veneration by republicans. The central role of this instrument in the political conflict of the day is made manifest in a lithograph executed by J. J. Grandville in 1833 (Fig. 8). This print was published as part of a series by Charles Philipon's Association '0 A discussion of their content is found in E. Bechtel, Freedom of the Press and L'Association Mensuelle: Philipon versus Louis-Philippe, New York, 1952, 37-40. For a recent attempt to relate this context of struggle to several works of sculpture, see J. Ribner, "Henri de Triqueti, Auguste Preault, and the Glorification of Law under the July Monarchy," Art Bulletin, LXX, 1988, 486-501.</page><page sequence="5">THE MEANINGS OF DAVID D'ANGERS'S MONUMENT TO GUTENBERG 363 7 Thorvaldsen, Monument to Gutenberg. Mainz (photo: Roger-Viollet) Mensuelle, a venture created to raise money to defend his satirical journal, Le Charivari, in its courtroom battles. The action takes place in a printer's office as Louis-Philippe attempts to stifle a female figure, representing both liberty and republican ideals, and his henchmen attack Gutenberg's invention upon which she is braced. Placed in the immediate foreground with figures disposed symmetrically on either side, the printing press acquires quasi-religious associations, while at the same time the phrygian cap and fasces ornament- ing the top of the vaguely anthropomorphic machine assert its affiliation with republican beliefs. Whereas this image depicts the press attacked by the legal henchmen of the July Monarchy, a lithograph by Daumier issued the same year could be considered a representation of the counterattack. Here a journeyman printer uses his press to crush the head of a figure with the features of Louis- Philippe (Fig. 9). The printer wears a cap bearing the name "Le National," a straightforward reference to the leading opposition newspaper in Paris, which was headed by Armand Carrel, the militant republican lawyer and leader in the campaign for freedom of the press. As the "liberte de la presse" became a rallying cry of republicans, the printing profession itself came to be perceived as eminently republi- can. This displacement is seen in a lithograph Daumier published in the Association Mensuelle series in 1834 (Fig. 10). The printer, wearing the paper bonnet of the journey- man like a phrygian cap and posed in a pugilistic stance, has delivered a knockout punch to the Bourbons, in the right background, and stands ready to administer similar punish- ment to Louis-Philippe, who foolishly rushes onto the scene from the left. Daumier's displacement of republican values from the printed word to the workers who physically produced it was not without some basis in reality. Real-life counterparts to Daumier's fictive personage were certainly to be found in the profession in Paris and other major cities in France. Journey- men printers were very active in republican political clubs and secret societies throughout the July Monarchy and many were under police surveillance as potential subversives." Possibly the most radical printer in Paris at the time was Martin Bernard, a contributor to the Revue republicain in 1834 and 1835, member of the revolutionary Societe des Droits de l'Homme, and a director of the Societe Libre Typographique, which was brutally suppressed by the Pari- sian police for propagating subversive ideas.12 His most dramatic confrontation with the government occurred on 12 May 1839 when a revolutionary group of around six hundred members, known as the Societe des Saisons, seized the Palais de Justice in central Paris and attempted to start an armed insurrection. In the call-to-arms published by the group, Bernard was listed as a commandant of a division of the "Armee Republicaine."'3 Although certainly not members of the proletariat, a small group of radical publishers also lent their moral and finan- cial support to these dissident workers. Perhaps the most prominent of these was Laurent-Antoine Pagnerre, who specialized in literature destined for a working-class audi- ence. Like Bernard, Pagnerre was a member of the Societe des Droits de l'Homme and other secret societies during the July Monarchy and was the publisher of a republican alma- nach and a Dictionnaire politique, to which David d'Angers contributed, as will be seen.14 1 These clandestine activities are amply documented by P. Chauvet, Les Ouvriers du livre en France de 1789 a la constitution de la Federation du livre, Paris, 1964, 115-170. 12 See ibid., 155-158, for information on Bernard's career and politics. 13 This brochure is found in the Archives Nationales, Paris (hereafter A.N.), CC.726, dr. 1. 14 Pagnerre's papers, documenting his political activities, are in A.N., 67AP1-10.</page><page sequence="6">364 THE ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 1991 VOLUME LXXIII NUMBER 3 II l1 i I i i 11 I I!

At Strasbourg, several printers and journalists were like- wise in the forefront of a strong republican movement.15 Although there were a number of ephemeral republican societies or clubs in the city, most of the radical republicans were members of an organization called the Cercle Patri- otique, which was active until the passage of the September Laws. These laws, it should be noted, not only instituted press censorship, but also stringently regulated public gath- erings for political purposes. A conspicuous member of that group of 120 members was Gustave Silbermann, the most celebrated printer in Strasbourg. Known today for several innovations in color printing and typography, Silbermann was a member of a prominent Protestant family, a lawyer and one of the owners of the Courrier du Bas-Rhin, the largest daily newspaper in Alsace and the voice of republican politics in the region.16 As might be expected, the paper was prosecuted under the September Laws in June 1836 for criticism of the king and for the subversive opinions it 15 The essential work on the political climate of the period, to which the present article is indebted, is Felix Ponteil's book cited in the Sources. Another important discussion of the social history of the town during the period is C. Staehling, Histoire contemporaine de Strasbourg et de l'Alsace, 1830-1852, I, Nice, 1882. Although the monument at Strasbourg was sponsored by the city, not the state, a recent study of state patronage and politics during the July Monarchy provides valuable background for the political climate in France as a whole during the period.

At the trial, held in Stras- bourg, it was defended by Louis Liechtenberger, a radical republican lawyer and the head of the republican party in Strasbourg, who also wrote for the journal. Despite the government's attempt to quell the opposition in this trial, the verdict of the jury was for acquittal.17 It should be noted that while the composition of the committee in charge of the subscription and construction of the Monument to Gutenberg originally included a range of individuals with differing social and political alignments, radical republicans were in the vanguard of those promoting the monument. Early in 1836 Silbermann wrote an impas- sioned article in the Revue d'Alsace urging haste in raising the necessary funds for the structure and the naming of a permanent committee for its construction that would be more active than the initial one.18 This was followed several months later in the same journal by another article promot- ing its construction by Charles Boersch, a member of the Cercle Patriotique and a former editor of the Courrier du Bas-Rhin. It is unclear exactly when radical republicans replaced the original members of the committee, but in a brochure published on 30 March 1840, announcing the dates for the inauguration of the monument, five of the seven signatures were those of former adherents to the Cercle Patriotique. More important, Gustave Silbermann was the president and Louis Liechtenberger was the vice president.19 17 See ibid., 451-459, for an account of the incident. 18 G.

It is easy to reconstruct the event, since it was widely covered in both the provincial and the Parisian press. To assist at the three-day celebration, delegations traveled from Paris and most of the provincial centers in France and other countries in Europe. From a historical point of view, this pageant is of great interest because it offered a panoramic display of the various trades that composed the quotidian life of a provin- cial city. On the first day of the ceremony, the statue was inaugurated and the appropriate speeches were made by civil officials, but the real spectacle was reserved for the second day, when a huge parade was held in which the traditional trades and corporations marched in sections accompanied by floats decorated with the symbols and tools of their professions. Tanners, tailors, barrel-makers, and bookbinders were among the crafts represented in the thirty-eight divisions of the procession. Fortunately, the appearance of these floats and the order of the sections involved are known from an album of colored lithographs produced to commemorate the festivities. Near the end of this parade came the section representing lithography, whose float was surmounted by a large plaster bust of Alois Senefelder, the inventor of this reproductive means, and a team of lithographers who executed prints on a lithographic press while the parade was in progress (Fig. 11). Bringing up the rear of the procession was the profession of Gutenberg; on the float representing typography, journeymen from the committee, which included Raess, the future bishop of the city, see the pamphlet Fete seculaire de l'invention de l'imprimerie par Gutenberg qui sera celebree d Strasbourg en 1836, Strasbourg, 1835.

The principal address at this gathering was by Louis Cormenin, a celebrated political pamphleteer and a deputy who sat with the extreme left in the Chamber of Deputies. Although Cormenin was not present, his speech was read by Pagnerre, who earlier delivered a toast in the same vein. It concluded with a prediction: "Printing will change the conditions and form of modern society. Printing will finish the revolution that the bible began; the bible brought to all men civil equality, and printing will bring to them political equality.... To Guten- berg, the emancipator of mankind!"24 All this is to say that many in Strasbourg viewed the Monument to Gutenberg as a tribute to a proto-republican, to an individual whose invention paved the way for the use of the press as a forum for political debate and for the dissemination of republican or revolutionary ideas. In addi- tion, for many the monument was undoubtedly a means of protest against the hated September Laws. Thus, while the activity of the republican opposition may have been only one motive for the erection of the monument, by the time it was dedicated, its meaning was largely controlled by this faction. Another Monument to Republicanism The Monument to Gutenberg should not be considered in isolation from other monuments in Strasbourg. Instead, it is part of a system of symbols, conceptually and geographically linked, which unified the city and made its social and cultural features visible. Essential to the meaning of the Gutenberg statue is another monument paired with it in contemporary criticism. This work, inaugurated on 14 June 1840, ten days before David's work, is the statue and tomb of Jean-Baptiste K1lber, the renowned general of the revolutionary armies and the city's most famous military hero (Fig. 13). Executed by the Alsatian sculptor Philippe Grass, it occupies the largest and most centrally located public space in Stras- bourg, which is directly connected to the place Gutenberg by the rue des Grands Arcades (Fig. 2, site B).25 Grass's monument to the general, due to a series of political vicissitudes, was inaugurated forty years after his assassination in Egypt in 1800. The preliminary resting place for Kleber's remains was the Chateau d'If in Marseilles, and they were only transferred to the Cathedral of Strasbourg in 1818. At that time the mayor of Strasbourg and the Munici- pal Council made the first attempt to erect a commemorative monument in a prominent position in the town. This structure would have consisted of a mausoleum-pedestal with a standing figure of the soldier by the Alsatian sculptor Ohmacht. As one might expect, this plan was vetoed by the Restoration government of Louis XVIII, which pointed out 24 The speech was reprinted in full in C.d.B.-R., 28 June 1840, 1-2. 25 On the history of this monument, see A.

This was a convenient way of denying a public monument to someone considered an exemplary republican, particularly one known for his political opposition to the Bourbon monarchy. The functionaries of the Restoration were also undoubtedly aware of the republican cult growing around the figure of Kleber, a late expression of which is seen in an essay published in Strasbourg in 1838, where he was termed the "Republican soul of the war in the Vendee" and his memoirs were declared to be "imprinted with the purest republican enthusiasm."26 After this rebuke the project continued to be discussed in administrative circles, but no action was taken until the July Monarchy came to power, at which time the campaign to erect a commemorative monument was resumed. Finally, in 1834 permission was obtained to hold a public contest for the project. Among the democratic reforms that many supporters of the July Revolution expected the new regime to implement was the practice of employing open contests to determine the authors of public monuments. This was part of the political credo of republicans in the wake of the overthrow of the Bourbons and became even more en- trenched in republican ideology as Adolphe Thiers and Francois Guizot, two powerful ministers of Louis-Philippe, made known their opposition to the idea of contests.27 Thus, when the exhibition of the nineteen projects in the contest opened at Strasbourg in 1835, there was considerable inter- est in many other parts of France.28 Among the strongest advocates of public contests was the journal L'Artiste, whose wholehearted endorsement of open competitions is found in an article announcing the event at Strasbourg. This contest was described as a "recompense, very feeble it is true, for all the deceptions which our hopes for public contests in Paris have encountered." The article concluded with a declaration that all sculptors in France must enter the contest and so, "by 26 E. Barrois, "Kleber," Album Alsacien, Strasbourg, 1838, cols. 630-640. 27 On the widespread and insistent demand for democratic distribution of patronage during the July Monarchy, see my "By Competition or Administrative Decree? The Contest for the Tomb of Napoleon in 1841," ArtJournal, Spring 1989, 46-48. The demand for public contests during the period will be discussed at much greater length in my forthcoming book on the tomb of Napoleon. One should note that Marrinan (as in n. 15) discusses in detail the 1830-31 contest for paintings to decorate the Chamber of Deputies in Paris and concludes that, "A few months later-and with the hindsight of experience- almost no one wanted to renew the competition experiment" (p. 80). In fact, just the contrary was the case. 28 The complete documentation for this contest is found in A.M. Stg., Div. VI, 180. There were thirty-one entries in the early stages of the contest and nineteen in the exhibition, including prominent figures such as Pradier, Seurre, and Lemaire and one woman of lesser renown, Catherine Sichler, a student of Ohmacht and the sculptor in charge of the sculptural restoration of the Cathedral. The choice of Philip Grass, a student of Ohmacht and a native son of Strasbourg living in Paris, tended, of course, to undermine the notion of contests as democratic and unbiased.

At Strasbourg there was even more political rhetoric surrounding the contest for the monument to the republican hero. In its discussion of the entries in the competition, the Courrier du Bas-Rhin set forth in the most emphatic terms its belief in the necessity for contests and its confidence in the ultimate wisdom of the masses, rather than that of specialists or appointed functionaries, as the judges of them: The bestjudge [of contests] is the crowd with its instinctive feeling for the beautiful; with that ideal which it bears, confused and obscure, in itself; the crowd belongs to no school, no party, no coterie; the work of art that is the most perfect is that which awakens in the crowd the sentiment of the beautiful, common to all men and which strikes it the most vividly.30 This is an extreme form of the populist beliefs that underlay the demands for public contests being voiced in many different cities in France and the kind of rhetoric that reinforced the legendary republicanism of Kleber and the republican implications of his memorial. The program for the contest stated that the monument was to be constructed on the place du Broglie, an area at the northeast periphery of the old city and near one of the branches of the Ill River (Fig. 2, site C).3' Before the event was concluded, however, the demand of the republican press that the monument be placed at the place d'Armes, in the center of the municipality, gained many adherents. Principal among those advocating this location was Louis Liechten- berger. His position was made emphatically clear in an article he published in the Revue d'Alsace in 1834; he declared that the appropriate place for the monument to this "republican soldier who died a republican!" was not the edge of the town, but the largest and most central public place in its confines.32 Hence, the monument, when finally inaugu- rated, was seen by many as much more than an homage to a famous native son. It was a monument to republican values and a counterpart to the monument soon to be unveiled at the place Gutenberg. Each inflected the other. One might argue, then, that the two open spaces, directly connected by the major thoroughfare, formed an "axis of republicanism" at the heart of the city. 29 "Monument de Kleber a Strasbourg," L'Artiste, vIII, 1834, 82-83. 30 "C.B.," "Concours pour le monument Kleber; Exposition des modeles," C.d.B.-R., 31January 1835, 1. 31 A copy of the detailed written program provided to potential entrants, which included a carefully drawn plan and elevation of the site, is in A.M.

The position finally adopted placed the figure of Gutenberg and the bas-relief on the front of the pedestal opposite a series of undistinguished buildings on the east side of the square, which raises the question of why it was oriented in this particular direction, rather than in one of the other three. Also in need of explanation is the fact that the monument is situated at the terminal points of the two main streets that lead into the square, the rue des Grands Arcades and the rue des Serruriers, yet it faces neither. If the intention were to create a dramatic or monumental effect, it would seem that the statue would have been placed in such a way as to confront beholders as they approached the place Gutenberg from either of these two heavily traveled arteries. It might be argued that the structure was placed in its present direction so that the Hotel du Commerce would form a background. However, only one corner of this building is visible behind the monument. A more convincing reason for the placement might be found by standing in the place Gutenberg, behind the monument, and looking skyward. Looming over the build- ings across from the monument and over the isolated figure of the printer is the enormous north tower of the Cathedral (Fig. 14). From the center of the square, the presence of the flamboyant Gothic spire is inescapable, and one has the immediate impression that the printer is offering or exhibit- ing his proof sheet, with the words "Et la lumiere fut" inscribed on it, to the towering symbol of Roman Catholi- cism. But what is the deeper meaning behind Gutenberg's gesture and the dramatic confrontation? Perhaps the most extraordinary aspect of the encounter of printer and Cathedral is that it appears to be a very literal representation of a chapter in one of the most famous novels written during the July Monarchy, Victor Hugo's Notre-Dame de Paris 1482, first published in 1831. In a scene set in his cell at the cloister of Notre-Dame, the villainous Archdeacon Claude Frollo holds a conversation with two visiting scholars, one of whom is Louis XI in disguise, during which he points to a book on his table with one hand and the cathedral, visible from his window, with the other, remarking enig- matically that "Ceci tuera cela." Hugo then proceeds with a lengthy exegesis of the archdeacon's claim that the book will kill the cathedral, and puts forth his own theory about human progress and the significance of the printing press: 33 See Silbermann (as in n. 18), 189, and idem, "Celebration de la fete seculaire de l'invention de l'imprimerie dans les siecles anterieurs," Revue d'Alsace, I, 1836, 428. 14 View of place Gutenberg, looking toward the Cathedral (photo: the author) To my mind this idea has two aspects. It was first of all the thought of a priest. It was the fear of the clergy confronted with a new force-printing. It was the fear and bedazzle- ment of a man of the sanctuary before the luminous printing press of Gutenberg.... It was the cry of a prophet who already hears the distant rumblings of humanity emancipated; who sees that in the future intelli- gence will undermine faith, opinion dethrone belief, and the world will shake Rome; the prognostication of a philosopher who sees human thought, galvanized by the press, evaporating from the theocratic receptacle.... This signified that one power was going to supplant another. This is to say that the printing press will kill the Church.34 Hugo continued with an explanation of the second meaning implicit in Frollo's assertion: the printed text has inevitably supplanted the "book of architecture" in the progressive movement of history from theocracy to democracy. While the Gothic Church, according to this theory, marked a transition from theocratic architecture, dogma writ in stone, to a more 34 V. Hugo, Notre-Dame de Paris 1482, Paris, 1961, 209.</page><page sequence="12">370 THE ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 1991 VOLUME LXXIII NUMBER 3 democratic era, it in turn was supplanted by a yet more democratic medium, the printed book. It should be stressed that Hugo was not hostile to Gothic architecture, nor did he claim that it should be forgotten or denigrated. Another passage makes this clear: "The past should be read in these marble pages; it is necessary to both admire and reread continuously the book written by architec- ture; but one cannot deny the greatness of the edifice, which in its turn printing raises."35 But if Hugo saw the destruction of one medium by the other as an example of historical inevitability, his view was not shared by many of his contem- poraries, who believed that society was still locked in a struggle of uncertain outcome between the forces of faith and reason, or between blind authoritarianism, repre- sented by the cathedral, and democracy, symbolized by the printing press. In order to understand the confrontation of the Catholic religion and the religion of the printing press as others perceived it, one must remember that the revolution that ushered in the regime of Louis-Philippe in July 1830 also brought into the open a substratum of violent anticlericalism that had grown steadily during the Restoration. The close bond between throne and altar promoted by the Bourbons, measures such the censorship laws of 1822, making it possible to suppress newspapers that endangered the "re- spect due religion," and absurdities such as the law of 1824 prescribing severe penalties for sacrilege, including the death penalty for profanation of the Host, made it difficult for a committed republican to adhere to the tenets of institutional Catholicism. Thus, the revolution that over- threw the Bourbons in 1830 witnessed the most emotional public manifestations of hostility to the Church since the Revolution of 1793. In response to this climate of antipathy for the Church, a group of Catholic intellectuals began a counteroffensive that was to have major ramifications for the shape of Catholicism in nineteenth-century France. Their strategy was to revive the principles of ultramontanism in religious life, on one hand, while promoting the liberal ideas that proliferated after the fall of the Bourbons, on the other. As it was used at the time, the term "ultramontane" designated those Catho- lics who looked beyond the Alps, or to Rome, rather than the Gallican Church, for authority over and direction of religious and social life in France. During the Restoration, Joseph de Maistre was the most militant representative of this religion of authority. For de Maistre and the Catholic minority that shared his world view, the reverence for religious authority was allied with a belief in absolute authority in the political sphere, and it followed that almost all ultramontanes were ardent legitimists. Hence, the separation of the sources of religious and political authority by liberal Catholics after 1830 marked a dramatic shift in religious ideology in France. However, this change was to be of short duration. After 1840 the situation was gradually reversed, as the fundamental contradiction between reverence for absolute authority in religion and the celebration of social and political liberties 35 Ibid., 223. became untenable. For many Catholic militants the term "ultramontanism" once again signified a return to the principle of absolute authority as the ground for both social and religious life.36 Undoubtedly the most focused effort of the ultramontane movement during the July Monarchy was its struggle for "liberte de l'enseignement," or its concerted campaign to abolish the State's monopoly on higher education. The ultramontane party conducted a fierce battle over the issue in the press, the courtroom, and in legislative chambers throughout the 1830s and 1840s. In the rhetorical struggle the issue became schematized as a combat between Catholi- cism and a hostile, secular state, or between the teachings of the Church and those of the atheistic university. The most prominent defenders of the system of secular education were two luminaries of the University of Paris, Jules Michelet and Edgar Quinet, each of whom published vitriolic denuncia- tions of ultramontanism and what they called Catholic obscurantism. For both men ultramontanism and "Jesuitism" were interchangeable, and the Jesuit order was considered the primary agent of the ultramontane reaction in its attempt to use religion as a means of social control and to repudiate the intellectual advances of the Enlightenment. Ultramontanism had strong support not only in Paris, but also in many provincial cities, Strasbourg being one of its strongholds. The leading advocate and theoretician of the movement in the city was the philosopher and polymath Abbe Louis Bautain, who was a professor at the University of Strasbourg at the time of the inauguration of the Monument to Gutenberg. A central thesis in Bautain's many publications was that reason was incapable of discovering any higher certainty and that only Catholicism, supported by authority and tradition, could teach the truth. Another standard- bearer for the cause was Andre Raess, who became a bishop and the second-ranking ecclesiastical official in the diocese of Strasbourg in 1840 and its archbishop in 1842.37 From the date of his appointment as bishop, Raess began a campaign in his sermons, writings, and diocesan activities to promote the cause of ultramontanism and the absolute authority of the Vatican. In this cause Raess had the support of the Alsatian clergy, which had traditionally been characterized by its fidelity to the Papal See. Raess was also known for his friendship with and protection of the Jesuit order in his diocese.38 One of the more visible signs of the growing importance of the ultramontane party in Strasbourg was the controversy known as the "Ferrari Affair," which began in 1842, when Bautain resigned his chair at the University of Strasbourg to 36 On the aesthetic and political ideology of ultramontanism and its relationship to other social ideologies of the day, see my "The Gothic, the Revolution and the Abyss: Jean-Philippe Schmit's Aesthetic of Authority," Art History, xIII, June 1990, 193-211. 37 The religious conflict at Strasbourg and the activities of the ultramon- tane leaders are discussed in great detail by R.

Nat.) take a another post and an Italian philosopher, Giuseppe Ferrari, was appointed as his successor. Almost immediately after Ferrari began teaching, he became the butt of charges in the Catholic press that he was a materialist and anti- Catholic. Important members of the Church joined in the chorus of accusations and began a campaign to have him removed. Their efforts came to fruition in January 1842 with a decree of the Minister of Public Instruction suspending his courses at the University. The response of the political opposition and of Protestants might be summarized by the remarks that the Dean of the Faculty of Protestant Theology at Strasbourg addressed to Edgar Quinet regarding the affair in a letter of May 1843: The Jesuit clique has vast projects which are made more dangerous by the connivance of the bishop, the falsest individual I have ever known, and it exercises an immense power over the clergy in our province.... Supported by several deputies from the Bas-Rhin and the Bautain clique, they succeeded in having the Minister of Religion issue this memorable decree, which ought to be known to all newspapers of the capital, a decree that is a master- piece of injustice. . . . The appearance of this decree provoked expressions of joy from the jesuitic party; and the Protestants have been profoundly afflicted.39 In response to the plea for help Quinet discussed the climate at Strasbourg in the preface to his book titled Les Jdsuites (1843), a work that was only one prong of his passionate attack on the Society ofJesus and ultramontanism.40 An anticipation of how the battle against ultramontanism during the July Monarchy was to intersect the issue of 39 This letter dated 7 May 1843 is reproduced in full in Ponteil, app. XII, 951-953. 40 See E. Quinet, Les Jsuites, in Oeuvres completes de Edgar Quinet, Paris, 1875, 8. freedom of the press is found in a caricature by J. J. Grandville, published in La Silhouette on 7 August 1830 (Fig. 15). In the foreground a group of Jesuits with heads in the form of bellows are holding a book-burning party, while in the background other members of the order, whose heads serve as eteignoirs or candlesnuffers, are putting out the light of the candles, a metaphor for the printed word. The caption, "Eteignons les lumieres et rallumons le feu" ("Extin- guish the light and relight the fire"), is from an anticlerical poem by Beranger, the most popular poet of the era, and refers not only to the extinction of knowledge but also to the fires of the Inquisition. The theme of the candlesnuffer soon became a standard part of the vocabulary of caricature and until the end of the century served as a metaphor for ignorance, clerical or otherwise.41 Thus, the figure of Guten- berg holding the sheet upon which the words "Et la lumiere fut" are emblazoned would have been read by anticlericals familiar with the prominent metaphor of the candlesnuffer as a direct challenge to the symbolic edifice that he con- fronts. The juxtaposition would have been seen as a monu- mental parallel to Grandville's caricature. For anticlericals, Gutenberg was holding an emblem of reason up to Abbe Bautain, Bishop Raess, their ultramontane followers, and, most important, the Jesuit order. A Further Dimension to the Confrontation It is not only the orientation of the Gutenberg Monument in relation to the Cathedral that gives it symbolic meaning. Further significance lies in the fact that it occupies a position on an imaginary line running from the square in front of the Cathedral to the church of St.-Thomas, on the western edge 41 On the prevalence of this theme, see R.

At either end of this axis are edifices that represent the competing belief systems that had divided the city since the Reformation. From the standpoint of architectural style, the church of St.-Thomas, which was reconstructed for the fifth and final time in the late thirteenth century and is essentially Ro- manesque in design, with some Gothic elements, offered an austere architectural counterpart to the exuberance of the Cathedral (Fig. 16). This stylistic contrast, which of course had long preceded the Reformation, acquired a symbolic dimension at the end of the seventeenth century and came to signify the fundamental difference between the two religions. Thus, facing the Cathedral, with his back positioned toward the Protestant church, the effigy of Gutenberg seems to mark a boundary between them. But his placement further sug- gests that the printer is on the Protestant side of the divide, or that he is a defender of the ideas represented by the Reformed Church. He stands on the side of individual reason and faith and in opposition to blind obedience to religious authority. To give this interpretation greater plausi- bility, one might briefly recall the history of religious strife in the city. 42 For an informative history of the Reformation at Strasbourg, see L. Abray, The People's Reformation: Magistrates, Clergy and Commons 1500- 1598, Ithaca, 1985. As early as 1523, the ideas of Luther and the Reformation gained a foothold in Strasbourg. In this year the German Protestant reformer Martin Bucer, recently excommuni- cated from the Catholic Church, took up residence in the city. By 1531 the Reformation had triumphed there and the Catholic bishop was forced to leave and reestablish the archdiocese in the neighboring town of Molsheim. From then until 1681, when Louis XIV captured the city, the Cathedral of von Steinbach was in Protestant control. After the Sun King restored the Cathedral to Catholicism, the church of St.-Thomas, where Martin Bucer was the pastor from 1531 to 1540, became the seat of the Reformed Church.42 The historic religious divide between Catholicism and Protestantism was still much in evidence during the July Monarchy. The census of 1842 showed that the population, which totaled 70,381 residents that year, was almost evenly split between those professing allegiance to the Catholic Church and those loyal to various Protestant groups, with the Catholics holding a slight majority.43 That the figure of Gutenberg would have been perceived as standing with the reformed church and against the power of the Catholic Church is more understandable if one remembers another passage by Hugo in his Notre-Dame de Paris: "The sixteenth century destroyed religious unity. Before printing, the Reformation would have been only a schism; printing made it a revolution. Take away the press and heresy is exhausted. Whether a matter of providence or destiny, Gutenberg is the predecessor of Luther."44 This linking of Gutenberg and Luther, the one the inventor of the means of propagating the message of the bible to a mass audience and the other the individual who employed this means to transform society, was to become a commonplace of political discourse. It was a connection found, for exam- ple, in a poem entitled Gutenberg und Luther, which the local poet Theodor Klein composed for the inauguration of the Gutenberg Monument in 1840.45 Thus, many in the town could have well imagined that the figure facing the Cathedral on his pedestal in the place Gutenberg was equivalent to the prime mover of the Protestant Reformation and that the monument was an homage to the Reformation. Another way the figure of Luther was used in political discourse of the period was as the liberator of human intelligence. This interpretation appears, for instance, in the preface to the monumental edition of his writings, Memoires de Luther, translated and published with a commentary by Michelet in 1835. After discussing the adherence of Luther to the idea of grace and his denial of free will, Michelet stressed that he was nonetheless the champion of individual liberty because he advocated the principle of "the sover- eignty of individual reason; or put differently, the resistance to the principle of tradition, to authority." Even if he did not 43 The results of the census, broken down by religious denominations, were published in tabular form in "Population de Strasbourg," L'Abeille, 8July 1842, 177-178. 44 Hugo (as in n. 34), 220. 45 T.

An Embattled Bas-Relief The model for the statue of Gutenberg was finished months before the bas-reliefs were given their final form, and the numerous sketches for and variants on their composition bear witness to the difficulties they caused the sculptor. From a print of the monument that was offered for sale in 1840, probably shortly before the dedication ceremony, it can be seen that the lithographer was familiar with the basic format of the relief destined for the front of the pedestal, but was 46J.

The sketchy image of the relief in this print was probably based on a drawing provided by David, similar to one in the collection of the Musee d'Angers, in which the printing press is placed on an elevated altar at the top of a pyramidal composition and children reading books are arranged on the steps below. In that sketch, representing historical figures who utilized the invention of printing for the benefit of Europe, the names of the representatives for various countries are written in, but their positions in the composition are unclear.47 The existence of numerous and widely differing sketches for the bas-reliefs may help explain why they were not ready for permanent installation at the time of the dedication ceremony. In lieu of presenting the final works in bronze, it was decided to paint replicas to scale of the reliefs on three sides of the pedestal and to install a plaster cast of the one representing the continent of Europe on the front.

Like the others, it was composed of a panoply of famous personages, but one of its figures provoked immediate outrage from Catholics in the town. In the center of this composition, to the immediate right of the iconic printing press, was the figure of Martin Luther. Thus, not only did Gutenberg assume a position of symbolic confrontation with the Cathedral, but so did the principal instigator of the Reformation. Here may be another reason for the physical orientation of the monument. So objectionable was David's image of Luther that the sculptor was soon obliged to modify the relief in an effort to pacify some of the opposition. The first attempt at quieting the outcry of protest by Catholics in the city was a proposal to change the composition, adding and giving equal promi- nence to the figure of Bossuet, the famous seventeenth- century bishop, orator, and writer. After the approval of this compromise solution, the temporary plaster relief was re- moved from the pedestal and David proceeded with the new version, which placed the effigy of Bossuet, dressed in his episcopal robes, in a conspicuous position at the extreme left of the composition. On 27 May 1842 the artist wrote to the mayor announcing that the bronze cast was complete and that it was ready to be permanently mounted on the pedestal. This attempted balancing act, a work likewise never permanently mounted on the monument, is known from plaster and terra-cotta sketches by the sculptor, but, more important, it exists in a cast-lead version in the courtyard of the National Printing Office at Paris. In 1842 David autho- rized this establishment to make a copy of the statue and the reliefs from his plaster casts, and the relief containing both Luther and Bossuet was the one installed at Paris, when this second version of the monument was finally completed (Fig. 19).48 The most strident voice at Strasbourg in the campaign to have the image of Luther expunged from the monument was Antoine de Humbourg, editor of L'Abeille, a weekly political and literary journal founded in April 1842. De Humbourg was a militant spokesman for the ultramontane movement, an undisguised legitimist, and, like de Maistre, a fervent enemy of Protestantism, which he believed to be the most dangerous enemy of civilization. In a series of articles consecrated to it, de Humbourg denigrated the sponsors of the project, but his most telling accusation, and one that was certainly not without foundation, was that the committee for the erection of the monument had set a deliberate trap or "embuscade" for the Catholics in the city by enlisting their contributions for its construction and seeking their assistance 48 This line engraving is found in Relation complete des fetes (as in n. 20), 51. The chromolithographs of the statue of Gutenberg and the bas- reliefs by Silbermann are found in Revue generale de l'architecture et travaux publics, I, 1840, pls. 29-30. at the inauguration ceremony, but then unveiling an image on the pedestal that was a direct attack on their most deeply held beliefs. This plot, according to de Humbourg, was conceived by the same group of Protestant radicals who were the panegyricists of the "philosophico-socialico-communistes" doctrines of Guiseppe Ferrari and other supporters of the pagan University. The charge that the monument was an ambush or a "guet-apens" reappeared in a more forceful way in a petition that de Humbourg initiated and dispatched to the Minister of Public Works in Paris in October 1842 demanding the expurgation of the offensive image.49 Soon after de Humbourg drafted his petition, the ostensi- ble raison d'etre of the campaign dissolved when it was decided to remove the figures of both Luther and Bossuet from the relief. In letters to Gustave Silbermann and the mayor of the city, dated 22 October 1842, the sculptor agreed to change the composition of his cast of characters yet once again, and to substitute Erasmus and Montesquieu for the figures of Bossuet and Luther. At the same time he expressed his dismay at this display "of intolerance, which I thought had been extinguished forever."50 Finally, after these changes had been made and the models cast in bronze, the committee for the monument was able to announce on 6 June 1844 that all the reliefs were complete and ready for installation.51 This task was then accomplished with little fanfare on 15 July. What the Monument Signified to the Artist After determining with a reasonable degree of certainty the meanings the Gutenberg Monument held for residents of Strasbourg, we should turn to the question of what it meant to its author. It was no accident that David d'Angers was asked to execute the work. He was the most esteemed sculptor in France, with many public monuments to his credit, and his political views appear to have been in complete accord with those of the radical republican faction that ardently promoted the project.52 One manifest expression of the sculptor's political convic- tions is found in a small terra-cotta statuette entitled La Liberte, which he executed in 1839, and later cast in bronze with several significant changes. In the bronze version a 49 A letter from the Minister of the Interior to the Prefect of Strasbourg announcing receipt of the petition is in the A.D.B.R., dossier M.D.H. 1840-48.

Also Jouin's description of the cast of characters on the relief representing Europe includes Luther and Bossuet, and therefore does not describe the version as finally installed at Strasbourg. 51 Letter signed by all the members of the committee in A.M.

On the base of the pedestal are words from the famous martial hymn and call-to-arms La Marseillaise, which further reinforce this message. That this sculpture was intended for more than a limited number of collectors of small-scale bronzes can be inferred from an advertisement, dating from around 1840 and initiated by the publisher Laurent Pagnerre, that offered plaster models of the work for twelve francs, a price that would have made them available to a mass audience.53 The rhetorical counterpart of this statue can be found in several entries that David d'Angers published in 1842 in 53 The purpose of the work is discussed briefly by de Caso, 216, n. 45. In the forthcoming English translation of his book, this footnote will be greatly expanded. I thank the author for permitting me to read the additional information concerning Pagnerre before its publication. As for his personal relationships with members of the republican opposition, we know that from at least the late 1830s he was a close friend of Felicite de Lamennais, the charismatic writer, former priest, and political activist. In a letter written in March 1840, for example, one learns that he had passed several hours in the quarters of Lamennais, who read fragments from his work in progress to the sculptor.55 This visit occurred less than a year after Lamennais let his name be used as one of the members of the "Gouvernement provisoire" that the Societe des Saisons was attempting to establish with its insurrection.56 Although Lamennais was not prosecuted for his connection to this revolutionary organiza- tion, he was sentenced to a year in prison in January 1841 for his attack on the July Monarchy in a book, Le Pays et le gouvernement (1840), which he may have been writing at the time of David's visit. The strongest indication of the extent of David's personal involvement with radical republicans attempting to over- throw the July Monarchy, however, is a portrait drawing dated 2 May 1840 (Fig. 21). A note in the artist's handwriting at the bottom of the sheet indicates that it was done at the time the revolutionary activist Auguste Blanqui was hiding from the police in David's quarters. Blanqui had been a fugitive since his participation as "Commandant en chef' of the Societe des Saisons's revolutionary army. For his role in this fiasco he was sentenced to death in absentia, and then, in an act of clemency, his sentence was reduced to deportation. It was this penalty that he was attempting to avoid when he sought refuge with the artist. Hence, this portrait drawing constitutes prima facie evidence that at least in this instance David's political sympathies extended beyond words-to the act of harboring a fugitive from justice. Of the numerous funeral monuments executed by David, the one honoring an individual with political convictions closest to his own may be that marking the grave of Armand 54 David d'Angers, "Arc-de-Tromphe ou Arc Triomphal," in Dictionnaire politique, ed. L. Pagnerre, Paris, 1842, 87. 55 David describes this encounter, during which Lamennais read from his Esquisse d'un philosophie, in a letter to another friend dated 9 March 1840. See H.

Paris, Musee Carnavalet (photo: Giraudon) Carrel in the cemetery of St.-Mande. The lifesize effigy of Carrel, founder of the republican newspaper Le National, was inaugurated in 1839. Carrel, who had been killed in a duel three years earlier, is represented in the act of giving a speech before the Chamber of Peers in 1834, when he defended the manager of his newspaper against charges of publishing an article injurious to the state. It is possible that David regarded his work at Strasbourg as a complement to this tomb sculpture just outside Paris, or a tribute to an individual whose invention made possible the growth and dissemination of Carrel's republican values. Another bit of circumstantial evidence that David d'Angers perceived the sculpture at Strasbourg to be a monument to republican beliefs is a note, accompanied by a small drawing, on one of his studies for the project, which shows that he considered including "Louis David, seated near the statue of liberty, meditating on his republican art."57 The Gutenberg Monument also offered the sculptor a means of expressing his sympathy for another cause that preoccupied him much of his life and was an intrinsic part of his commitment to republican ideals: the abolition of slavery. There was pervasive debate about the issue of slavery in the French colonies during the July Monarchy and until its abolishment on 27 April 1848 in the early weeks of the Second Republic, but remarkably few works of public art in France depict the evils of slavery or commemorate its abolition.58 Drawings and notes for an imagined Monument to Emancipation survive to document David d'Angers's own meditations on the issue, but that project was never real- ized.59 Thus, the monument at Strasbourg provided a unique occasion to treat the theme in a public space. In the relief representing the continent of Africa on the back of the pedestal, Clarkson, Condorcet, and Abbe Gregoire, all of whom relied on the printed word in the emancipation struggle, are engaged in freeing slaves from bondage, while providing them with books (Fig. 6). To the left of the iconic printing press, the abolitionist Wilberforce places one hand on the invention of Gutenberg and the other on a recently freed slave and serves as a mediating link between the two. By representing the printing press as the primary instru- ment in the liberation of African slaves, this relief also appears to enter a passionate debate of the day over the historical position of the Church on the issue of slavery and to comment on a popular platitude. In Gustave Flaubert's Dictionnaire des idees refues this cliche is found under the letter "C": "Christianisme: a affranchi les esclaves."60 Flaubert's inclusion of the assertion that Christianity had freed the slaves was certainly justified considering its prevalence in literature of all kinds in nineteenth-century France, as Frank Bowman has amply demonstrated.61 But the issue of whether the Catholic Church had promoted the abolition of slavery, either in the Early Christian period or since its rise to a position of dominance in Europe, had also become a subject of intense scholarly debate at just the time David d'Angers was at work on his Strasbourg monument. In 1837, for example, the Academie des Sciences Morales et Politiques opened a contest for the best essay on the question of the causes of the abolition of slavery in Europe during antiquity. The winning essay, by the historian Eugene Biot, published in 1840 under the title De lAbolition de l'esclavage ancien en occident, had of necessity to address the role of the Church in this historical development. Biot argued that both the changes in the Roman legal system and the Christian doctrine of human equality were the chief historical determi- nants of abolition in antiquity. Biot's essay was quickly praised by the ultramontane press, which took the supposed historical role of Catholicism in the freeing the slaves as one 58 For examples of this theme in the visual arts, mostly found outside France, see A. Boime, The Art of Exclusion: Representing Blacks in the Nineteenth Century, Washington, D.C., 1990.

One could have heard this counterargument presented forcefully, for instance, by a minor painter at a meeting of the Societe Libre des Beaux-Arts in 1841: "I do not think that Christian society is justified in making this claim, because has it not suffered in this servitude from the fall of the Roman Empire to our own day? And in America, is it not still there as a living remorse that weighs on the conscience of the nineteenth century ... ?"64 Therefore, one might consider the relief at Strasbourg to be David's re- sponse to this dispute. Rather than answering the question of whether the Church had historically supported the abolition of slavery, however, he represented the means by which slavery was to be ended in the modern era. His solution was the book, not the cathedral. It has recently been suggested that this relief on the monument at Strasbourg implies the dependency of slaves on their white benefactors and their inferior status because the black youth in the foreground is given a small stature and "outsized lips and the exaggerated prognathism of popular caricature."65 Though it is true that, despite his concern for the abolition of slavery, David may have viewed blacks through the stereotypes of his time, there is also another reason for the "caricatural" appearance of this figure. The entire composition of this relief and the other three are stylized in such a way as to suggest their affinity with popular art of the day and they deliberately appear caricatural or naive in relation to high art of the period. They reflect the sculptor's interest in crude woodcut broadsheets of the kind produced by the Pellerin firm at Epinal and other types of popular imagery of limited technical sophistication.66 This choice of a primitivizing stylistic modality, calling to mind "art of the people," appears to be directly related to David's democratic political beliefs. 62 See, for instance, H. Ferrand, "Economie sociale. Fondations, instituts et oeuvres de charite pendant le moyen age," L'Institut Catholique, I, 1842, 250. 63 Anon., "Rome chretienne, ou Tableau historique des souvenirs et des monuments chretiens de Rome par M. Eugene de la Gournerie," LAmi de la religion, no. 5765, 20June 1843, 554. 64This address by Auguste-FranSois Dreuille was delivered on 21 December 1841. See Annales de la Societe Libre des Beaux-Arts, xi, 1842, 326. 65 Boime (as in n. 58), 171. H. Honour, The Image of the Black in Western Art, Cambridge, Mass., 1989, 167, also discusses the exaggerated physiognomical features of the slaves in this relief and cites a passage from David'sjournal in which the receding foreheads of blacks were held to be signs of their lack of the powers of reflection. Since Meyer Schapiro's seminal essay on Courbet and popular imagery, the close connection between popular art, populist social ideology, and republican values in the dis- course of mid-nineteenth-century France has been generally recognized.67 Schapiro also attempted to demonstrate that the work of Courbet borrowed or appropriated certain stylistic features, as well as thematic content, from this mass-produced imagery. Subsequently, other writers have found sources for realist art, in particular the work of Manet, in popular imagery of various sorts. Recently, however, Lorenz Eitner has convincingly argued that the actual stylis- tic relation between realist art of the period and popular imagery is in fact "very slight, a matter of general character and flavor rather than of style or motif."68 What is interesting about this discussion from our perspective is that the work of David d'Angers, a member of the French Academy who was never associated with the realist movement, demonstrates a closer parallel to popular imagery of the day than any of his contemporaries affiliated with it. Before the. Gutenberg reliefs, David's conscious primitiv- ism is perhaps best seen in the reliefs he executed for the Arc de Triomphe at Marseilles, which was dedicated in June 1835. Like the works at Strasbourg, the scenes on the arch have many personages engaged in complex actions, but there is little spatial illusionism or concern with creating a convincing perspectival space in which to position them. The figures, many of whom overlap, are placed primarily in one focal plane, and the relief of the composition is flattened out in the manner of popular woodblock prints. Heavily incised lines are used more than sculptural modeling to separate them and to mark divisions in the composition. At Stras- bourg David employed a similar technique and augmented the primitive qualities further by incising the names of the figures into the background of the composition in a childlike fashion, leaving the name Leibniz conspicuously misspelled in the image on the front of the pedestal. The same sculptural practice was pursued even more emphatically in a series of reliefs he executed for the tomb of General J. N. Gobert, dedicated at the Parisian cemetery of Pere Lachaise in 1847. In this commission, the images of blacks appear in even more stereotypical form than those on the relief at Strasbourg. Their caricatural style is once more in keeping with the naive appearance of the relief as a whole.69 66 See de Caso, 151-152, for a discussion of David's primitivism and its relation to popular imagery. 67 M.

This difference may be explained by David's simultaneous espousal of populist values, expressed in popu- lar imagery, and of the idea of genius, which was best represented in a more elevated style. His concept of the nature of genius and its relationship to the social order appears frequently in his writings, expressed in different ways. For him, like the members of the Saint-Simonian movement, an ideal society was one in which genius replaced royalty, kings were toppled from their pedestals and re- placed by uniquely talented individuals, and the rule of merit supplanted that of birth. A typical expression of David's views on the relationship between genius and the herd is seen in a passage in his journal in which he imagined a monument appropriate to the "grands hommes" of France: "To indicate a great genius, devoured by the envious, one could represent an immense oak tree that raises its branches toward heaven and the miserable insects that devour its bottom."70 Elsewhere he describes the great individual as offering the means for the solution to social problems and for the spiritual elevation of the masses. In all his lucubra- tions on the state of society, however, David never seems to have perceived clearly any contradiction between his concern for the proletariat and for democratic ideals and his belief that a handful of superior individuals should guide human destiny. In keeping with his belief in the guiding light provided by the gifted few, the artist maintained that sculptural monu- ments to individuals of genius ought to convey the difference between the hero and the crowd. To achieve this goal, he held that the exceptional individual should be dressed in the "costume of apotheosis" and isolated on his pedestal. Ide- ally, the sculptor would employ "heroic nudity," but barring that, the timeless costume of antiquity. At Strasbourg, how- ever, for unknown reasons, historical accuracy prevailed and instead of draping Gutenberg in classical dress or rep- resenting him nude, David clothed him in the costume of the late Middle Ages. Nonetheless, the famous printer is represented in a dignified pose and much attention is paid to the classical principles of ponderation, weight, and balance in his figure. Knowing his opinions on the mode of rep- resentation appropriate for genius, it is difficult to imagine David rendering the effigy of the famous printer in the primitive manner of the figures in the bas-reliefs. There- fore, the disparity in styles between the effigy and the reliefs might be accounted for by the fact that two different, and perhaps contradictory, concepts, the "people" and the "genius," are given visual form in one and the same monument. As for intentional anti-Catholic implications in the monu- ment at Strasbourg, it is clear from scattered references in David's journal that the sculptor, whose religious views seem to have been vaguely pantheistic, was no friend of the 70 Les Carnets of David d'Angers, I, 217. Catholic faith. Furthermore, at the time he was at work on the Gutenberg project, his most important sculptural commis- sion was embroiled in a dispute involving the Catholic clergy and press. This battle was fought over the cast of characters in his pedimental sculpture at the Pantheon in Paris. Origi- nally constructed as a church, the building had been rededi- cated to France's great men during the Revolution, only to be returned to its religious function during the Restoration. Thereafter, however, Louis-Philippe once again turned the structure into a secular Pantheon and David was commis- sioned to execute the pediment. When his frieze, represent- ing the distribution of laurel crowns to France's great men, was completed in 1837, the government refused to dedicate it on the vague grounds that the composition was unaccept- able. No official documents exist to show specifically what the government objected to in the work, but in David's unpub- lished accounts of his discussion of the matter with Mon- talivet, Minister of the Interior, and in accounts of the affair in the press, the reason for this demand appears to have been the inclusion of certain republican figures and in particuliar the prominence of Voltaire in the work, whose presence on the faqade of this former church enraged Catholics.7' This attempt of the government to prevent David's composition from being unveiled in turn provoked a storm of criticism in the opposition press, and the administra- tion eventually caved in and let the work remain as it was. But the inauguration of the secular sculpture generated the expected chorus of indignation and cries of infamy in the Catholic press. One suspects, therefore, that when David included a prominent image of Voltaire in the relief at Strasbourg, representing the continent of Europe, he could not help having in mind the response to his project at the Pantheon. Even though the monument at Strasbourg seems to be placed in a symbolic confrontation with the Cathedral, there is little direct evidence that David himself chose the direction of its orientation. From his correspondence, we know that he journeyed to Strasbourg to work on the placement in September 1838.72 One can safely assume that at that time, if not earlier, he must have stood in the center of the place Gutenberg and discussed the problem of lines of sight, the height of the pedestal, and the obtrusive elements of the architectural environment with Gustave Silbermann and the members of the committee. He certainly would have been aware of the spire of the Cathedral looming over the square. It is tempting to believe that during this site inspection he looked up at the massive religious 71 On this commission see the important article by N. McWilliam, "David d'Angers and the Pantheon Commission: Politics and Public Works under the July Monarchy," Art History, v, 1982, 426-447. The author reproduces excerpts from David's four different unpublished accounts of his meeting with Montalivet and of the affair, and commentary from the press, but was unable to locate any official government document providing specific details as to what was objectionable about the composition. 72Jouin (as in n. 55), 388.

David greatly admired Hugo and had established a friendship with him during their participation in the same romantic cenacle during the Resto- ration period. In 1842 he executed the model for a portrait bust of Hugo, crowned with laurel leaves, and later presented him with the marble version of the work.73 In turn, Hugo's admiration for David is recorded in several of his major poems, where his sculpture is praised extravagantly.74 Like Hugo, David had a genuine love of Gothic architec- ture, if not the religion for which its monuments were produced. It is known, for example, from a note in his journal that he visited Strasbourg Cathedral after the inaugu- ration of his monument and was profoundly moved by it: "In seeing these sublime creations of genius and the human heart, one feels that it was impossible for mankind to create anything better...."75 If David perceived his figure to be in a stance of symbolic defiance vis-a-vis the Cathedral, it was not the architecture of the famous building that was at issue, but the residue of theocratic ideas that Hugo and many other writers had declared to be moribund. Conclusion At this point I would recapitulate the principal claims made in the preceding pages concerning the meanings this monu- ment held for its beholders and its maker. From its inception this project was charged with significance due to the socio- political configuration of the city in which it was erected and the political situation in France as a whole. The importance of the issue of freedom of the press in the mid-1830s made Gutenberg a particuliarly appropriate symbol for republican opposition to the July Monarchy and the printing press a fitting emblem for republican ideology. And the city of Strasbourg had both a direct relation to the origins of printing and a very active republican contingent within its boundaries. Yet, Strasbourg, like most other cities in France, was divided politically, and it would probably have been impossible to construct a civic monument in the heart of the city that was simply an expression of the political beliefs or aspirations of one segment of its population. As we have seen, committed republicans, Protestants, and anticlericals seem to have been instrumental in bringing it to completion, yet civic pride among many townspeople, who were none of these, seems to have played an important role in its construc- tion. Indeed, some who had promoted the project were undoubtedly surprised at the time of its unveiling by its unforeseen social and religious implications. 73 For details on this bust and a letter of Hugo to David concerning it, see S. Lami, Dictionnaire des sculpteurs de l'colefranfais au XIXe siecle, II, Paris, 1916, 102. 74 See Feuilles d'automne (1828) and Rayons et les ombres (1839). 75 Les Carnets de David d'Angers, II, 278. Entry dated 29June 1840. Had the monument been erected in any major city in France at the time, it would probably have conveyed the same political ideas, but probably not as emphatically. In Strasbourg, with its long history of religious conflict be-tween Catholics and Protestants, the monument also assumed an additional dimension and became directly implicated in the religious struggles of the day. It was both a symbol of anticlerical opposition to the Catholic Church and a represen- tation of Protestant resistance to its au-thority. The resur- gence of ultramontanism in the period, which was especially conspicuous at Strasbourg, gave the monument even more immediacy in the minds of those sympathetic to the Protes- tant cause or antipathetic to Catholicism. Of particular importance in interpreting this monument is its actual physical location within the city. An accident of geography-that is, the availability of the place Gutenberg as a site for the monument and the spatial relationship this site bore to other monuments in the city-played a major role in giving it meaning. The republican coloration of the work was amplified by its close geographical relationship to the Kleber monument, with which it was often compared, and its religious implications were greatly heightened by its position vis-a-vis the Cathedral and the primary Protestant church in the city. In its confrontation with the Cathedral, it seems to illustrate a famous passage from the famous novel by Victor Hugo, and it is probable that David d'Angers and certain of the monument's sponsors consciously intended it to do so, but this dramatic illustration of Hugo's text could have only been possible in this particular location, which was to some degree fortuitous. This certainly does not mean that its meanings were determined by chance, but that its physical location and the social and political situation of the time provided a ground of possibility for both creative and interpretative acts. It appears clear from what we know of the beliefs and actions of David d'Angers that he wished his monument to intersect these political and religious ideas in this manner, and that he was in accord with the beliefs of the republican and Protestant forces in the city. His execution of the work free of charge is but one indication of the importance he placed upon it. One of the reliefs also offered him the opportunity to express his support for a personal cause, the abolition of slavery, a subject that had little obvious relation- ship to the figure of Gutenberg. The primitive style in which the reliefs were rendered is likewise an expression of David's interest in popular art and the social values he saw attached to it, and a means of putting his personal artistic signature on the work. But there were limits to the realization of his ideas. The social constraints within which he was working are demonstrated by the Catholic reaction to the relief with the prominent figure of Luther and the pressure that was exerted upon him to remove the offending personage, which he finally did against his will. All this points up the complex relationship that often exists between authorial intention, physical and social determinants, and the public reception of a work of art.</page><page sequence="22">380 THE ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 1991 VOLUME LXXIII NUMBER 3 Michael Paul Driskel writes primarily on the social history of French art during the nineteenth century.
