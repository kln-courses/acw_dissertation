<plain_text><page sequence="1">Identifying Resources from Which Children Advance into Pictorial Innovation N. H. FREEMAN Psychology is one of the foundation disciplines that feed into the complex of undertakings devoted to education. Developmental psychology is sup- posed to come forward with explanatory models of change during child- hood, models which, if all goes well, might eventually help educators to foster the kinds of change to which they are professionally committed. There has been a great deal of debate over how well the aim has been trans- lated into practice (did classical stage-theory help or hinder education?) and over divergent conceptions of evidence in psychological research and in educational attainment. And yet with all the turmoil, no one denies the va- lidity of the aim of making psychology serve education: the turmoil is over how to get from aim to specifiable objectives. One way of contributing is for psychologists to feed forward information about new lines of research be- fore they harden into formal models. At the early stage of research it is sometimes easy for educators to pick up whether an idea shows promise, whether connections can now be made between conceptions that had hith- erto defied synthesis, or whether psychology seems to them to be reinvent- ing the wheel. In the long run it makes no difference at all whether it is a matter of psychology catching up with what educators know or of educa- tors catching up with what psychologists know, as long as the two do come together in a useful way. In that light, here is a progress report on a way of challenging children to make a pictorial innovation in such a way that an inference can be made about the child's internal resources which have de- veloped to a point where the child herself can exploit them or be led to exploit them by a cooperative adult. At the outset it would be reasonable to be wary about the phrase "in- ternal resources." Identifying and fostering pictorial giftedness is a collabo- rative activity within a cultural context, and all attempts to separate out internal and external resources run the risk of destroying the necessary N.

Freeman interconnections that give meaning to the enterprise. To cite a warning from D. Crystal about the dangers-in his case language analysis-in tak- ing apart symbolic actions: "We must beware of the Humpty Dumpty syn- drome. We should never take language apart without the intention and ability to put it back together again."l But Crystal also warns that it is essen- tial to keep trying to make distinctions and reconcile them. A useful anal- ogy given by Crystal concerns a hypothetical child who gets on just fine in a supportive context by avoiding certain speech constructions; the child has a disability that he has avoided turning into a handicap: "My prediction would be that Johnny's speech is a little like an injured leg: it holds you up while you are using it normally, but as soon as you put too much weight on it, it gives."2 Let us adapt the analogy by simply reversing the negative term "injured" to a positive asset, and the negative term "pressure" to a positive opportunity. We want to know whether children who get on just fine at studio work will show that they have a resource for leaping ahead given a window of opportunity. And we also want to know whether that resource is a little like having unusually strong legs with which the child can kick- start herself, or whether the leap is more like alertly espying a handy rope hanging in the environment on which she can swing out, as it were. That is about as far as the analogy can usefully go; as will be shown below, it is not too difficult to discern when a young child reaches for a culturally given model to solve a problem in innovation or develops a representational solu- tion of her own. The crucial point, though, is that one cannot easily tell from looking at the finished product what resource has been mobilized. The plan of the article is as follows. The next section is made up of a brief note on resources, followed by a section on a recent psychological model that was devised to explain how a child is impelled to mobilize her internal resources in a variety of domains. The model is a general one but has be- come applied to the study of how children are creative in drawing some- thing that they have never tried before. A section is devoted to two such studies and the new evidence that has been generated. Finally, the account returns to the start with a brief discussion of how the approach already shows signs of being useful in the perennial task of integrating psychology and education. General Characterization of Resources for Innovation Psychology used to characterize talent as though it were necessarily excep- tional: "Influenced by the romantic tradition, art was thought to be extraor- dinary, a result of rare genius.... Now we see art as less rare."3 If the prod- uct is seen as less rare, the inference is that the potential talent should be seen as correspondingly less rare. But there is no reason to fear that the re- vised vision is simply due to revising standards downwards, for writers</page><page sequence="3">Resourcesfor Pictorial Innovation 25 have maintained their respect for the resources that need to be mobilized in order to generate the act of insight that produces art. As E. Winner put it: "The moment of 'insight' is simply the final step in a chain of reasoning."4 Accordingly, if psychology is to be useful in diagnosing the necessary pre- conditions of the insight, it has to delve into the resources that sustain the chain of pictorial reasoning. Creative reasoning is undeniably difficult to analyze. However, a lead has been given by P. N. Johnson-Laird: "Any pro- cess that does not depend on magic can be modelled," and it is prudent to begin at the start of the process since "a creative process must start with some existing 'building blocks."'5 The task is to identify those building blocks, to model the processes that are deployed to give a dynamic to their use, and to discern the provenance of the building blocks and of the dynamic. To reiterate, it would be sterile, at best, to assume that modelling can be done in a cultural vacuum. But in all cultures a child must contribute some- thing off her own bat, otherwise there will be no substrate for the culture to take on. The assumption is that there are resources internal to the child that enable her to join in cultural practices and are available for cultural prac- tices to amplify. And once the amplification takes hold, it becomes an open question how far any individual child will push the process by exploring the elements of visual experience,6 to the extent that the culture encourages exploration. The first step in identifying the roots of the child's resources is the bold- est step, that is, the question psychologists have increasingly asked about the resources a child is bor with. A mass of evidence has served to docu- ment the proposal that we are born with a propensity to interest ourselves in the appearance of other members of our own species and to attend to and attempt to emulate the actions of others. Some of the brain mechanisms that serve those functions are in active operation within minutes of birth, others take some weeks to be activated. (For recent statements on human-figure processing in infancy, see the work of J. L. Locke and M. H. Johnson and J. Morton).7 That fascination with the human figure does not diminish in early childhood and comes to pervade all domains of symbolic exploration. The child's visual system has evolved to be precociously sensitive to visual patterns that match aspects of the human figure, and the primary represen- tations of the patterns serve as an apparently inexhaustible resource for subsequent symbolic activities. Of course, cultural practices can intervene to inhibit symbolic expression, by legislating against anthropomorphic ico- nography on religious grounds or by reserving such depiction for adults in the less accessible reaches of caves. But the resource is not thereby ablated. Indeed, it is no accident that human-figure drawing is the most heavily ana- lyzed topic in children's drawing and is the only topic there to have mono- graphs devoted to it.8 It is not too difficult to enrich the bare account of why</page><page sequence="4">26 N. H. Freeman we have a head start if we come to practice our graphic gifts in contexts where humanity is topicalized. And yet any account that rests only on the two foundation stones of mental contents/interests and products without modelling the resources that go into their production is really only a form of the magical argument against which Johnson-Laird warned. It was the achievement of A. Karmiloff-Smith to produce a specification of how initial representations can be mobilized in action.9 The specification is contentious. At the time of the writing of this article, an issue of Behavioral and Brain Sci- ences was being prepared for press in which a panel of researchers debated the adequacy of the dynamics of the model. But we need here only describe how the model has already begun to provoke research into graphic innova- tion and to draw out the implications for current study of the prevalence of artistic talent. Particular Resources for Innovation Karmiloff-Smith's model is called the Representational Redescription Model (RRM for short). The aim is to explain how the initial resources of a child, resources such as precocious attentiveness to the human face or to human speech sounds, become transformed in the course of development by influences both from outside the child and from within the child. That aim is in itself not new. Many researchers have made statements about re- sources when explaining how they understand both normal and excep- tional competence. Thus, E. Waters and L. A. Sroufe characterized the com- petent person as being able "to make use of environmental and personal resources to achieve a good developmental outcome."l? The question is, of course, who decides what counts as a "good developmental outcome." That question weighs heavy when dealing with the arts. But there is a resource internal to the child that is not driven by external judgment; instead, Karmiloff-Smith argued, the resource has its own dynamic, which gener- ates some very odd developmental outcomes as a necessary product along the way. Such products eventually make it possible for judgmental proce- dures to be brought to bear both by the child and by an adult. There are four basic concepts involved in the RRM analysis. In order to expound them economically, let us start with an extreme example of one of those rather odd developmental outcomes. Consider a resource that is the endowment of every intact child (except those afflicted with autism). The resource is an understanding of pointing with a forefinger, an action that seems to be unique to our species among species with hands. Pointing is used to indicate a referent for symbolic ac- tion as well as simply to secure joint attention to something interesting. As far as is known, children need no tuition to develop pointing in those re- spects. When a child points to herself, it is taken as transparent that she</page><page sequence="5">Resources for Pictorial Innovation 27 wants to direct someone's attention to herself or to focus the meaning of a pronoun "me." Similarly, the child can point to someone else with the same intentions which thereby become brought to bear on the other instead of the self. That is presumably why deaf children find it easy to acquire the signs for "me" and "you" in American Sign Language: those signs are transpar- ently nonarbitrary. And yet many deaf children go through a phase during which they show pronoun reversal. That is surely odd, for it defies the al- ready potent transparency of pointing to self to mean "me" when a child starts pointing to the other person to mean "me." And it is similarly odd to see a child point to self to mean "you." Karmiloff-Smith argues, noncon- tentiously, that those pointings have altered their significance in the child's mind from transparent gestures to opaque words. The pointings have be- come redescribed in the child's mind as a pair of oppositional arbitrary signs, perhaps as fully arbitrary as the spoken sounds "me/you" or "moi/ toi." So now that the pointings have become redescribed as an oppositional pair, there is scope for the child to muddle them up now and then. That muddle is a sign of an underlying representational advance. Of course, not all representational advances are accompanied by oddities and error, but enough of them are for the case to merit consideration. Accordingly, let us move straight on to the four basic concepts of the RRM model and then discuss how Karmiloff-Smith applied the concepts to the case of creative drawing. The RRM model is a model of how the developing cognitive system re- peatedly reworks the representations it contains. At the initial level there are constraints built in biologically, such as precocious processing of speech sounds, and these become mobilized in actions such as babbling. At this ini- tial level, and for a long while thereafter, the mental representations are en- tirely implicit in actions: the child can do things but can often do them only in a fixed order and has no conscious access to the way her mind guides her actions. The first crucial concept is thus that the initial period of mastery in any domain occurs at the behavioral level: the establishment of behavioral mastery consolidates the initial-state representations and secures their ex- pression in action. The second concept in the RRM model is that an auto- matic mechanism, which may possibly be unique to our species, takes those representations as input to a higher level of processing. In the course of so doing, the representations necessarily become redescribed and there may be some loss of the original connections with action. But there is a gain in linking elements within the domain that have hitherto been stored sepa- rately. Hence the rise of a new type of speech error, for example. The third concept is that as the new mastery becomes established, the redescription becomes repeated, more than once, and with each repetition the child has more opportunity of spotting innovatory cross-links within the domain, of detecting rules that operate within the domain, and eventually of spotting</page><page sequence="6">28 N. H. Freeman commonalties and analogies between domains. With each redescription, the representations become more explicitly organized, eventually becoming available to the child's reflective awareness. Thus, to focus again on the lan- guage domain, the initial phase of using possessives appropriately may be succeeded by a phase of overelaborating redundantly, and last of all the child can return to the simplicities and explain the rules she uses. That par- ticular example has been documented, and the best guess is that it normally needs something like four years for the redescriptions to run their course in the average child with average social support. The focal concept is that each set of redescriptions runs its own course, so that the child's thinking tends toward increasing modularization, and representational insight may surge ahead in one domain, leaving another behind. The child might become adept at manipulating representations in notational systems such as map making or drawing, yet remain relatively unsophisticated in, say, basic phys- ics and technology. There is no rigid timetable for representational advance in any given domain, and indeed one of the familiar clues to talent is often a speeding up in a domain. The emphasis on uneven phases of development tallies with a decent number of independent psychological models.1 As has been said above, the achievement of increasingly explicit representations in different domains gives the child an opportunity to spot commonalties and analogies, and that is her internal resource; but whether she uses the re- source for creative thinking might well not depend on her alone. That is the sense in which adults who offer themselves as a resource base in the studio can foster the expression of talent. The compressed account above has necessarily been rather too abstract for comfort. It is now time to consider how Karmiloff-Smith applied the RRM model to the case of innovation in drawing. In the next section I shall summarize her attractively simple experiment and then go on to show how a pair of limitations in her approach have been overcome in such a way as to enable us to assign due weight to internal and external resources, and to predict something of the relative difficulty of different challenges to the child to be creative. It is hoped that at this point it will become obvious how the approach connects with a familiar practice in talent spotting in art edu- cation, so that the final section will be seen simply as returning to the aim stated at the outset-the aim of building another bridge between psychology and education. Innovation in Drawing: Two Studies The quickest way of seeing whether a child has the internal resource for in- novation is to ask her to draw something that one assumes she has never seen and never drawn before. That challenge is usually simply thought of as asking the child to draw from imagination or to express herself in fantasy.</page><page sequence="7">Resourcesfor Pictorial Innovation 29 Those are good terms, but they are not sufficient. Imagination must have something to work on; and if the child has not yet developed the necessary representations to carry out her project, she will be left buried in thought or will turn out a mundane drawing in her accustomed routine, perhaps not realizing that that is what she has done. An active imagination or a lively fantasy life cannot in itself guarantee an innovation in expression or action. That is because, according to RRM, early mental representations are (a) not fully explicit and so are not easily accessed by the child at will, (b) are liable to be stored in the mind separately so that their connections are not avail- able to the child, and (c) are connected with the organization of practiced actions and so are not easily disembedded for the purpose of organizing innovatory action. For all those reasons, the child's aspirations and imagi- nation are as liable to run ahead of her ability to realize the aspirations as they are to be dragged back by the representations the child can mobilize, and thus eventuate in a mundane drawing. The trick is to find a challenge to the child's pictorial imagination in such a way that it becomes possible to diagnose the representational resource of the child in both its strength and limitation. Karmiloff-Smith simply asked children to draw a man (and a house and an animal) that does not exist. Five-year-olds readily drew incomplete people (houses, animals), altered the size of a body part by, say, giving the person a gigantic foot, and went in for altering the shape of a body part by drawing, say, one hand as triangular. All those graphic devices are familiar as being devices for generating what are literally monstrosities. Just as a monster results from a hitch in the normal programming of an embryo's de- velopment, so these graphic innovations are only cautious tamperings with the graphic routines that children of such an age have practiced in the course of establishing behavioral mastery. The behavior is very much as ex- pected from a system of representations that has not achieved the highest level of explicitness. What is of interest is what did not happen with the five-year-olds. With rare exceptions, the children did not make cross-cat- egory drawings; that is, they did not draw, say, a house with wings (con- nection of building and bird categories). That crossing of categorical bound- aries was attempted by nine-year-olds. It was congruent with that high level of redescription of representations that nine-year-olds also went in for freely transposing anatomical relations (e.g., drawing an arm where an ear should be) so that their monstrosities were more radically monstrous than those of the five-year-olds, monstrosities generated by playing with the connections between body parts. Thus, in the way predicted by RRM, de- velopment was accompanied by awareness of the possibilities afforded by connections and by cross-category interconnections One conclusion we can draw is that although it appears rather a humble response to the challenge of drawing a nonexistent man if the child were to</page><page sequence="8">30 N. H. Freeman move a leg to the chest and to add a lion's tail, if that were to be done by a five-year-old, one would infer that that particular child had developed her internal representational resource to a rather unusual level. Note that we are not here discussing how well that child draws the shapes she has con- ceived of drawing: the account concerns the resources she can summon up for her particular project. Thus, the RRM account would not credit that child as being necessarily more imaginative than her peers, but as having precociously explicit resources for her imagination to draw upon. So far, the study falls into the fairly traditional format of a psychological model of development that throws up in a predicted manner some worka- day signs of potential talent whose significance may not have been appreci- ated by some educators. But if we now regard the study as a first step in the right direction, it becomes straightforward to take another step. That next step is where it becomes possible to make a much clearer statement about potential resources for graphic innovation. Modifications to Karmiloff-Smith's design are easy to undertake. The following account is taken from six ex- periments reported in a working paper by A. E. Berti and N. H. Freeman,12 focusing on the first and final experiments in that series. The first experiment involved 62 five-year-olds and 62 nine-year-olds. The modification was simply to ask the children to explain how they had managed to draw their "man who does not exist." That should enable one to distinguish a child who relies on an external resource like "a ghost" or "a giant" from a child who relies on an internal resource and generates a pic- ture entirely "out of her own head." Sadly, not all children were explicit enough in their accounts to make the judgment, a point to which I shall re- turn; but from those who were sufficiently explicit (36 five-year-olds and 52 nine-year-olds) a neat cross-over in the data occurred. A majority of the younger children (61 percent) named an external fictional character as their model, and a majority of the older children (67 percent) explained how they had made up their innovation from their internal resources. The difference was statistically significant. The reason why that finding is interesting is that the shift from external to internal resources occurred despite the older children's familiarity with a greater range of fictional characters. That ac- cords with RRM: increasingly explicit representational redescriptions ren- der children increasingly self-reliant in innovation. Now we may pick up on the remark that not all children were very explicit in their accounts. We asked a pair of judges separately to assess how innovative each drawing was and how pertinent and explicit each accompanying explanation was. There was over 92 percent immediate interjudge agreement, so we can be fairly confident about the public status of the following results. First, among those children who relied on an external named model, there was no association between how pertinent their verbal account was and how creative the drawing was judged to be. That is reasonable, since a reliance</page><page sequence="9">Resourcesfor Pictorial Innovation 31 on an external model does not entail that the child will be successful in dis- tinguishing the drawing from her normal drawing of an existing man that we had solicited before the experiment began. In contrast, among the re- maining children, whom we take to have relied on internal resources in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, there was an almost perfect asso- ciation between drawing innovation and verbal report. That is indeed inter- esting, since there are no reasons for thinking that graphic skill and verbal skill are in general correlated. But it fits RRM: the more explicit the child's representations become, the greater the probability that they will be acces- sible to reflective awareness and translatable into verbal report. That sug- gests that as internal resources for graphic innovation increase, so does the verbal material one can effortlessly get from the child for the purpose of discussing the enterprise, and perhaps feeding in useful ideas. That first experiment gave another result that tallied with the experi- ment of Karmiloff-Smith: only 8 percent of the younger children attempted a cross-category drawing compared with 39 percent of the older children. One wonders whether, if one were to suggest to the children that they should draw cross-categorically from their own resources, they would be able to rise to the challenge. That is what we did in the last experiment of the series, using 46 five-year-olds. We first obtained from each child a drawing of a person, an animal, and a house. We then asked for a "man-animal, that is, something which looks both like a person and like a... [whatever animal the child had previously told us she had drawn]." We also asked for a "man-house." In contrast to the first experiment where only 8 percent of five-year-olds drew cross-categorically, 28 percent drew both times cross- categorically in this study. So RRM had underestimated resources rather a lot. However, even with the explicit encouragement, 20 percent of the chil- dren signally failed with both drawings, so RRM was right in positing that connections come late in development for some children. There was actu- ally a reason for asking for two innovations; and it is here that our account diverges from RRM in order to take greater consideration of the peculiar nature of drawing as a domain of specifically social competence. More will be said on that in the next and final section of this article. For the present, RRM should predict that it will be easier for the child to draw a man-animal than a man-house, since people and animals belong to the biological do- main where representational cross-links should be relatively easy to set up, whereas people and houses are categorically rather widely separated de- spite their episodic connectedness (people tend to live in houses). It was not easier to draw a man-animal than a man-house. Indeed, of the children who succeeded in only one of their drawings, nearly three-quarters succeeded only with the man-house. So RRM seems to point us away from the facts here. We were pleased by that since, as may have been surmised, we had predicted the outcome. The basis for that will now be explained in the context</page><page sequence="10">32 N. H. Freeman of returning to the concern of the opening of this article, whereby a closer link between psychology and education can be forged. Constraints on Resources for Innovation So far, putting RRM to work has proved its worth in helping to compare drawing with other developments, has helped in spotting some of the signs of innovation resources in children, has shown a shift with age toward self- reliance in innovation, and has found an association between explicitness of representation in drawing and expression in pertinent language. Such things are potentially useful in education to the extent that an educator might put some of the emerging research to use. Thus, a neat test that bears on the development of talent, Clark's Drawing Abilities Test,13 includes soliciting a fantasy drawing from the child's imagination. As I noted previously, there is scope for using RRM research to bring out resource implications underly- ing the exercise of imagination. But there is, I suggest, a deeper potential for building bridges. Let us take a functional approach to art, and rather than asking what children can do in art, let us start in a time-honored way by asking what art can do. D. Brook caught an important function in the words "Pictures are the most potent of... non-verbal representations by means of which we ambivalently seek to open and close the gap between the actual and what is possible."14 Freeman pointed out that the gap problem applies to the challenge of drawing something that, on the one hand, will seem to be clearly and necessarily a fiction at the same time as, on the other hand, it will trigger the recognition of a person,15 a recognition that will be trig- gered only if the drawing is mundane enough for the purpose. Why should the child not sidestep the problem? Indeed, one of the adults on whom we piloted our work suggested leaving the page blank, and one ten-year-old in Karmiloff-Smith's experiment wittily drew a pencil.'6 The reason why those drawing ideas are rare is, I suggest, that they break a social contract between artist and spectator. The contract is that if a referent is verbally agreed upon, then it should trigger a visual recognition. That contract is what even five-year-olds respect, and that is a high-level conceptual achievement. Now we can see why it was easier for the children to draw cross-cat- egorically between a person and a house than between a person and an ani- mal. People and houses take rather different shapes, so it is not too difficult to select forms on the page and still trigger two recognitions (house, person) simultaneously. People and animals have taken rather similar shapes under the forces of evolution as they deal with cognate biological problems, so it is rather hard for a drawing to trigger the requisite pair of simultaneous rec- ognitions. It is even possible that a fear of failing to secure the recognitions is responsible for five-year-olds' caution in innovation, as seen in two of the studies above. That is a different account from that of RRM. Without denying</page><page sequence="11">Resourcesfor Pictorial Innovation 33 the useful nature of the new empirical results noted at the start of this sec- tion, it may be high time to move away from RRM in the following respect. I noted above that the social contract is an impressive conceptual attain- ment for a young child. It may be time to track the child's emerging theory of depiction.17 But a theory is an internal resource, Karmiloff-Smith argues, for a theory can arise only through repeated representational redescriptions that tear away from normal input-output relations and thereby can power innovation. So it may be that there is a lot more mileage yet in RRM. How- ever, the basic point remains that the social contract to secure recognitions may be something of an impedance to cross-categorical visual thinking: it would be nice if a little training in exploring abstracts were to enhance the drawing of nonexistent referents. But that may be a bit much to hope for. NOTES 1. D. Crystal, Linguistic Encounters with Language Handicap (Oxford: Blackwell, 1984), p. 39. 2. Ibid.,p.84. 3. N. Smith and C.
