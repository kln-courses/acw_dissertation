Why do working- class young males in Britain wear white leather trainers? Why are women's shoes in pastel colours and normally have names such as 'Lady' or 'Com- fort'? What is the role of very potent marketing strategies in influencing our perception of shoes?4 The focus on the twentieth century makes it difficult to appreciate fully the relationship between footwear and culture in its dynamic aspects. A relevant exception is an essay by Christopher Breward on 'Men's Footwear and Modernity'. He proposes an unexpected and fortunate combination between his- tory of dress and twentieth-century theories of archi- tecture and design. Men's shoes are taken by Le Corbusier as 'masculine' objects characterized by hygiene and modernity. Even more so, in Loos men's shoes are the embodiment of standardisation and functional convenience. The twentieth-century men's shoe is thus the result of a complex, dichot- omous process of evolution of male clothing from the 'criminal and corrupted female dress'. This excursus to the late nineteenth and early twentieth century high- lights a weakness of the book. To imbue shoes with certain social and cultural values does not mean to explain why and how a number of signs and meanings conveyed by shoes were created, while others dis- appeared or were transformed. In the book, the association between high heels and women (or between high heels and female castration), although minutely analysed, is taken for granted. Until the first decade of the nineteenth century high heels were used both by men and women and expressed class rather than gender differentiation. In the twentieth century the issue of social and cultural transformation is strictly linked to changes in footwear itself. The most import- ant case relates to trainers. They are representative of age differences as well as class differences. They embody a 'post-industrial' way of living and at the same time reinterpret the key elements of more traditional values. They are not only shabby footwear (as maintained by older generations) but attain 'macho' and technological elements within a symbol of the late twentieth-century genderless society. These questions should not be perceived as placing a limitation on what the book explains. They are underlining the book's usefulness as a means of raising a series of stimulating questions. The book gives to cultural historians and historians of fashion and design a new and fresh analysis of the way individuals relate to a part of their body and to the apparel associated to it. A mixture of sophisticated and learned discourse and more factual evidence taken from personal and empirical records is corroborated by a widespread use of visual material. The book allows footwear to be recognized as an integral part of the lives of billions of people. This is surely a step forward.

The House Beautiful: Oscar Wilde and the Aesthetic Interior Charlotte Gere with Lesley Hoskins.

The House Beautiful: Oscar Wilde and the Aesthetic Interior was published to accompany the exhibition of the same title at the Geffrye Museum in London, organized to commemorate the centenary of Wilde's death in November 1900. One of the first things the visitor encounters on entering the exhibition is the 'Aesthetic' Teapot produced by Worcester Royal Porcelain Co. in 1882 and entitled 'Fearful conse- quences through the laws of Natural Selection and Evolution of living up to one's teapot.' This extra- ordinary anthropomorphic object, is a caricature of Aestheticism, satirizing one of Wilde's most famous 370</page><page sequence="2">Reviews witticisms about his collection of blue-and-white china, also the objects of desire found in most artistically aspiring middle-class homes. The 'Aesthetic' teapot is an appropriate object with which to open a discussion about The House Beautiful because on several levels it illustrates the book's rationale. This is to 'locate Wilde in the context of London's cultural life during the 1880s, to track his influence on the course-and demise-of the Aes- thetic Movement and to look in detail at his con- tribution to artistic house decoration' (p. 12). As David Dewing states in his introduction, the Aesthetic Movement happened without Wilde and was little changed by him but the book sets out to illustrate how Wilde provided the movement with its public identity and allowed it to reach a wider audience. The book is split into two different sections. The first five chapters, written by Charlotte Gere, cover significant episodes in Wilde's life and the develop- ment of the Aesthetic Movement, tracing the influ- ences that informed his opinions on taste and interior design and discussing how these manifested them- selves in creating Wilde's own concept of 'The House Beautiful'. Some of the material on Wilde is particularly indebted to Richard Ellmann's acclaimed biography.1 The final chapter, written by Lesley Hoskins, explores the characteristic styles and decoration that made up the Aesthetic interior and considers how these were assimilated and displayed within the urban middle-class home. This theme is more closely aligned to the content of the Geffrye Museum exhibition, which illustrates, primarily through objects and related material such as retail catalogues, the archetypal Aesthetic Movement style. One of the most interesting elements of the book and one of the most persuasive, is Charlotte Gere's presentation of Wilde's Aestheticism as a form of plagiarism. She utilizes a wide range of sources to describe how Wilde observed and absorbed the ideas of others and cleverly reinvented them as his own hallmark of taste. Gere describes how in becoming the archetypal Aesthete, Wilde took over Whistler's crown, adopting many elements of the artist's style and taste in collecting and decoration. As Gere points out, their friendship also give Wilde access to the houses of Whistler's friends and patrons, providing him with an entree into the exclusive artistic and wealthy 'in' crowd of late Victorian London society, known as the Souls. The second chapter of the book, focusing on the origins of the Aesthetic Movement in the decorative arts, is arguably the most disappointing. This is split into three main topics, design reform, the influence of Morris, and the discovery of Japan, and Charlotte Gere sticks to the established textbook histories in each case, following a well-trodden and familiar path. There is a lost opportunity here to explore other characteristics of late nineteenth-century Aestheti- cism. For example, the term 'Queen Anne' inevitably crops up regularly throughout the book but without any real exploration or attempt to define its meaning. This is a shame because as other historians have outlined, the eclecticism and historicism of the style encapsulated many of the primary characteristics that could be found in the design and decoration of the Aesthetic home.2 More positively, the variety and breadth of illus- trations included in this book are one of its biggest strengths. In an exploration of the artistic circles of Kensington and Chelsea, the homes of the wealthy, and the Bohemian society with which Wilde became associated is brought evocatively to life for the reader by the inclusion of colour illustrations of interiors painted by artists such as John Atkinson Grimshaw, James Tissot, Whistler and jewel-like watercolours by Anna Alma Tadema, which capture the essence of the most opulent Aesthetic interiors of the day. Charlotte Gere's penultimate chapter, taking its title, The Art of Decoration, from one of Mrs Haweis's advice books, considers the dissemination of Aes- thetic Movement principles through the literature of home decoration manuals that proliferated in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, from Eastlake's Hints on Household Taste, to the 'Art at Home' series published by Macmillan &amp; Co. Gere makes an important point that, 'the reach of the 'art movement' was enormously extended as it moved down the financial ladder' (p. 80), with the publication of more affordable advice books on home decoration. What is largely missing here, however, is any sense of the ideology surrounding the Victorian home and the cultural tension that can be detected behind these manuals of instruction. Similarly, the social and economic changes and complexities of the growing middle classes and their aspirations and desires are not really addressed. 371</page><page sequence="3">Reviews The second half of this chapter provides a detailed account of Wilde's lecture tours of America in the early 1880s. Here the reader encounters the extent of Wilde's adoption and adaptation of other people's ideas. Charlotte Gere outlines how his acquaintance with Whistler and Godwin provided Wilde with inspiration for his talks on handicrafts and house decoration, supplemented by other published mater- ial. Gere notes that during his tour Wilde requested copies of the Reverend Loftie's Plea for Art in the Home and Mrs Haweis's Art of Dress. At his most extreme, Wilde could be found blatantly plagiarizing Morris, with a minor adaptation of the famous maxim, 'have nothing in your house that is not useful or beautiful' (p. 92). Even the name given to Wilde's lecture on interior decoration, 'The House Beautiful' was not his own invention but came from the title of a successful advice manual written by the American art critic Clarence Cook. All this was going on, Gere reminds us, at a time, when Wilde, 'was still without the slightest practical experience of home decorating' (p. 92). The final chapter in this section, focuses on Wilde's own 'House Beautiful', tracing the appearance inside the terraced house at 16 (now 33) Tite Street, Chelsea through eye-witness accounts, from surviving letters to Godwin over its decoration and in the catalogue of the bankruptcy sale of the contents in 1895. Charlotte Gere points out that despite Wilde's desires to set new standards, he failed to practice what he preached and the interior of his own home deviated considerably from that advocated in his lectures, containing no real innovation in its decora- tion. This evidence is drawn from contemporary comments from visitors and friends who, one cannot help but think, must have had high expecta- tions of what they would find. Gere quotes Yeats's disappointment at the lack of any medieval or Pre- Raphaelite artefacts when he came to stay with the Wildes at Christmas 1888. The Aesthetically attuned Marion Samboure, wife of the Punch cartoonist Linley Sambourne, was clearly unimpressed, record- ing in her diary that she found Wilde's house 'weird and dullish' (p. 104). Lesley Hoskins has written the final chapter of the book and concentrates more closely on the influ- ence of the Aesthetic Movement on the urban middle-class home. This emphasis is important because the Aestheticism advocated by Wilde and his circle of friends can be seen as very much an urban phenomena. The chapter is presented thematically, divided, in the same way as the exhibition, into subheadings with a consideration of each decorative element within the home from wall and floor coverings, fireplaces and over mantles to furniture, textiles, lighting, and ornaments. Hoskins' sources of analysis are the manuals on decorating, manufacturers and retailers' catalogues and, to a lesser extent, contemporary comments in letters and diaries. There is rather an overlap here with earlier parts of the book but this is such a rich and fascinating resource of material that it is good to see it being utilized in more detail. The irony of the Victorian middle-class home, as Lesley Hoskins points out, is that historians are presented with a very rich resource of surviving material but largely without the documentary evid- ence to accompany it. Taste makers, such as Mrs Haweis and Mrs Loftie, were prolific in their writing, women's journals were flourishing and publications such as The House (from the 1890s) were the first consumer magazines on interior decoration. Surviv- ing visual sources include photographs of interiors- usually minus occupants-paintings and illustrations, all of which are well represented in this book. From these enticing fragments the design historian has to uncover evidence of how the Victorian middle classes transformed these sources of information into practice within their own homes. Lesley Hoskins acknowledges the discrepancy found between the advice book model and the reality of the middle- class interior but it would have been useful if there had been references to other existing material, such as novels and trade journals, to substantiate or refute her claims. Instead, the predominant approach through- out the book is to provide a descriptive narrative of the decoration and styles espoused by the authors of the manuals. This sometimes leaves an incomplete picture. For example, in a discussion about the market for old furniture Hoskins comments that, 'there was a limited stock, and although householders were advised to try visiting auctions in out-of-way country towns, costs were rising' (p. 126), but what is not mentioned here is the burgeoning number of antique shops that sprang up to support this demand. Neither is the growth of reproduction furniture, which Hoskins 372</page><page sequence="4">Reviews refers to in relation to retail catalogues, considered as a part of this phenomenon. Overall, The House Beautiful is an engaging book, pitched to appeal to a wide audience, which accounts for its tendency to provide a more general overview rather than an in-depth analysis. The book is more convincing in locating the sources of Wilde's ideas rather than in proving his influence over a wider public. It leaves the reader with an important remin- der that despite Wilde's position as a leading expo- nent of Aesthetic Movement ideals, it is pertinent that history continues to remember him for his wit and literary achievements rather than for his contribution to late nineteenth century decoration and design.

The Theory of Decorative Art: An Anthology of European and American Writings 1750- 1940) Isabelle Frank (ed.). Yale University Press, 2001. 391 pp., 29 b&amp;w illus. ?15 paper. ISBN 0300088051. In 1993, at a conference entitled 'Re-Thinking the Decorative Arts', Charles Saumarez-Smith stated: One of my propositions concerning the problems of the decorative arts as a subject area was that it suffered from its lack of critical mass; that there are not at the moment enough posts, positions, people and books to give it cur- rency. There are some signs that this is beginning to change.1 It could justifiably be claimed that, through the publication of volumes such as the one under review, the Bard Institute continues to make a significant contribution to this, albeit rather slow, change which he identified. Isabelle Frank has elected to emphasize the theory of the decorative arts, leaving to others, as she suggests, the analysis of their social and economic history. Her selection of writings is intended to represent an overview of the subject, a mapping of relatively unexplored territory. Processes of selection and omission ensure that the construction of an anthology can never be a neutral act: what Frank presents here might be described as 'anthology as polemic'. She has identified three key themes, which, she argues, emerged and developed over two centuries of discourse on the nature of the decorative arts, and has organized her selected writ- ings with the aim of reconstructing the history of the debate. Under her three thematic headings, 'The Function of the Decorative Arts', 'Materials and Techniques of the Decorative Arts' and 'Ornament and Style in the Decorative Arts', she presents a selection of forty-three writings (with translations by David Britt), each chosen to communicate a particular theoretical viewpoint. At the same time, they represent a 'sampling' of different literary forms, such as, 'historical studies, learned treatises, public lectures and manuals of instruction.' Such variety ensures that a few complete pieces are included, but most are excerpts from more substantial works, although each is long enough to sustain a particular argument and convey a sense of individual style. Frank's chosen writers are allowed to speak for themselves, but their work is effectively framed and contextualized by their editor. The thought and care that have gone into this compilation are obvious from the very beginning, in the clarity of her explanation of her selection and organization of the writings. This is followed by a substantial historiographical intro- duction, in which Frank presents her rationale for the timeframe (1750-1940) that she has adopted. 'Between the late-eighteenth and early-twentieth centuries,' she argues, '. . there was a clear, if fragile, consensus about the nature of the decorative arts.' The eighteenth century is identified as the period during which art theories originating in the Renais- sance were consolidated in the construction of a 'theoretical border between the fine arts and all other arts.' The potential for defining what the decorative arts were, in opposition to what they were not, resulted in a particularly fruitful period of intense debate during the nineteenth century, a subject well addressed by Paul Greenhalgh in The Culture of Craft.2 At the other end of her period, Frank lays the blame for the demise of the decorative arts, and their theoretical base, squarely on modern- ism's exclusion of ornament. In her narrative, this is the point at which the consensus breaks down, leaving only a few sociologists and social historians, 373</page></plain_text>
