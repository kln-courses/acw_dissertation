S the course of just over a century, an enormous change has taken place in the industrialized world in our re lationship to other animals. For mil lions of years we lived among species that we hunted (or were hunted by), farmed or worked. And now, in the space of a couple of generations, we have split ourselves off almost com pletely from the rest of the animal kingdom. Apart from a few pests, such as rats, mice, ants and cockroaches, with whom we keep our interactions as brief as possible, our only inter course with other species is with our pets and with hunks of meat on plastic trays with nothing to remind us of the living animal. So firsthand knowledge of the behavior and habits of other species is more limited than it has ever been. And our affection for animals, uninformed by experience of them, distorts our perceptions and inclines us toward anthropomorphism. Stephen Budiansky sees this problem clearly. The Truth About Dogs can be summarized very simply: Dogs are not people! "Dogs are dogs; humans are humans; and the remarkable and en nobling thing is that the twain can meet, and communicate, and enrich one another's lives despite having very different minds and very different ways of conceiving the world." It is the fail Clive D. L. Wynne is a senior lecturer in the De partment of Psychology at The University of West ern Australia, Nedlands. ure to notice these points of difference between dog and human minds that can lead to problems. Budiansky, who may be the best writer around on animal behavior, is a terrific prose engine, motoring through a finely chosen set of facts and anec dotes to produce just the effects he wants. His style is emphatic, yet engag ing: Fully one-quarter of the U.S. dog population is euthanized each year? how can this be if we love them so much? Broad brush strokes set the scene, and colorful metaphors bring the details out against the background: In a year, the production of urine by dogs in the United States would fill as many wine bottles as do the vineyards of France, Italy, Spain and the United States?"if, as Groucho Marx once said in a slightly different context, that's your idea of a good time." Budiansky's complaints about dog habits come as bitter punch lines setting off sympathetic descriptions of the plea sures of dog company. His puzzlement at our patience with dogs starts with himself: Knowing what he does about the costs of dog ownership, how is it that he still feels affection for dogs? Anyone who has read Budiansky's earlier books (particularly The Covenant of the Wild) will not be surprised that he sees dogs as active agents in their own domestication. Dogs hung around hu man settlements, stealing food and be ing a general nuisance, for a long time before people found any use for them. Nearly all of the more than 300 modern breeds of dogs originated within the past two centuries. Budiansky's scholarship is impres sive. In addition to discussing behavior and a kind of cross-species sociology that almost nobody else attempts, he ranges freely over physiology, anatomy, evolution and genetics, explaining all with admirable clarity as he goes. Though Budiansky does not offer ex plicit guidance for dealing with dog be havioral problems, he keeps coming back to the idea that people need to re member that dogs are fundamentally pack animals watching out for the so cial hierarchy. They are exquisitely sen sitive to social signals, and many prob lems stem from a reticence on the part In The Engines of Our Ingenuity: An Engineer Looks at Technolo gy and Culture (Oxford Universi ty Press, $25), John Lienhard brings a relentless optimism to his exposition of "the complex mirroring processes that define technology-driven evolution." The anecdotes included range widely in time, from the domes tication of wheat around 10,000 years ago to episodes from Lien hard's career as an engineer and educator. Readers will find short treatments of ancient pumps, Gothic cathedrals, Victorian bridge engineers and many fa mous and not-so-famous air planes, all loosely organized into chapters. The book has a celebratory tone: Lienhard writes that "We are always up for one more saga of a heroic technology carried out by a self sacrificing hero."

Below, "The author first confronts the conceptual riddle of the wheel." 2001 March-April 173</page><page sequence="2">In the late 19th century, the possibility that physical systems might be described in proba bilistic ways, rather than deterministically, was anathema to most scientists. Ludwig Boltzmann was one of the first iconoclasts to declare that heat?as the energy of motion of atoms?should be described statistically. In Boltzmann's Atom: The Great Debate That Launched a Revolution in Physics (The Free Press, $24), science writer David Lindley describes engagingly and broadly the scientific and personal struggles Boltzmann suffered as he tried over three decades to gain acceptance for his explanations of thermo dynamics and his concept of atoms (at that time a novelty). Ironically, in the last years of Boltzmann's troubled life, Max Planck and Albert Einstein used his ideas in statistical mechanics to lay the foundations of quantum physics. Science is a discipline character ized as much by mystery and wonder as by experimentation and reproducible results. In The Barmaid's Brain and Other Strange Tales from Science (W. H. Freeman, $23.95), Jay In gram purports to expose some of that mystery. The mythical Norse merman, for example, a beast of the sea regarded as a sign that a storm was imminent, may have been nothing more than a distant walrus seen through the "distorting lens of the atmosphere." The bar maid's exceptional ability to re call orders is offered as proof of the human brain's incredible adaptability. The eccentric behavior of young women accused of being witches in 17th-century Salem may have resulted from eating rye bread contaminated with ergot. In gram's rational explanations for a handful of natural phenome na only add to their wonder, and the book is often amusing. Nanoviewers: Brian Hayes, Thomas J.

Since the color vision of dogs resembles that of color-blind humans, a dog would not be able to distinguish one photo from the other. From The Truth About Dogs. of the owner to impose the necessary social order on the dog. Nicholas Dodman, author of Dogs Be having Badly, appears to share many of Budiansky's beliefs about why dog human relationships go wrong. Dod man's approach to addressing this is to attempt what might be called inter species cognitive-behavioral therapy. When people undergo cognitive behavioral therapy, they receive re inforcement to alter their behavior and are also told what to think about the be havior, in the belief that this cognitive component may help them to change. In Dodman's hands, the behavioral part of the therapy is intended for the dog, which is nothing surprising, since re wards and punishments are pretty much the only way to communicate with non humans. Dodman's ingenuity lies in the cognitive part of the equation: He places beliefs in the dog owner's mind about what the dog is thinking, so that the owner may be more inclined to carry out the necessary reinforcement training. At a theoretical level, this cognitive compo nent is just so much hot air?even if we accept that dogs have thoughts (a tricky concept at best), these thoughts must be unknowable to a human observer. But as a practical measure for getting hu mans to cooperate in the necessary train ing of their animals, it is close to genius. The alphabetical structure of Dogs Be having Badly did not strike me at first as a good idea. There are, after all, no 26 dog behavioral problems conveniently named with different letters of the al phabet. "Destructive Behavior" is large ly about separation anxiety, presumably because S was needed for "Sexual Be havior." Consequently a fair amount of searching may be required before the desired section is found (an excellent in dex helps in that regard). "X-Files" is fairly pointless within the purely func tional purposes of the book, since it is just a bunch of funny dog stories. It does, however, help leaven what is, de spite the engaging writing style, a sur prisingly serious work. And the alpha betical conceit works better than I expected. The entries vary greatly in length, depending on how much there is to be said about a particular topic. There is also a very clear (though somewhat short) appendix on behavior modifica tion for dogs. I was expecting Companion Animals and Us: Exploring the Relationships Be tween People and Pets, as the only acade mic volume in this trio of books, to pack a critical punch that Budiansky and Dodman could not approach in their trade publications. I was sorely disap pointed. Edited volumes are always a mixed bag with little consistency of style or quality, but Companion Animals and Us has very few contributions that do more than dress platitudes about an imals in scientific language. Things do not get off to a good start with the edi tors' introduction.

A few chapters did strike me as in teresting. I learned much from Liliane Bodson's chapter on pets in ancient Greece and Rome. Norine Dresser's chapter on "The Horse Bar Mitzvah: A Celebratory Exploration of the Human Animal Bond" sneaked under my criti cal radar and left me strangely moved. And Piers Beirne's contribution on "Re tliinking Bestiality: Towards a Concept of Interspecies Sexual Assault" expand ed my awareness of the range of human animal interaction; his account of the things people do to get their kicks was quite a shocker. After that, I think I need to take the dog for a walk. H</page></plain_text>
