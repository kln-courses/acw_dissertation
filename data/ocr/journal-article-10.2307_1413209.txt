I. Root Co., Medina, Ohio, 1907. pp. 48. It is a pleasure to welcome, in an English version, this account of bee psychology by a German master of it. The work appeared first as a series of papers in the Biologisches Centralblati, Vol. XX, 1900oo, as a counter blast to Bethe's stimulating but inadequate studies of ants and bees (Bethe: Diirfen wir Ameisen und Bienen psychische Qualitiiten zuschreiben? Pfliiger's Archiv, LXX, 1898), but is contro- versial only in presenting vividly the contrary facts. The work is full of interesting first hand observation with abundant references to lit- erature and cannot fail, in its present form, to be useful to English students of bee behavior. The difficulties and defects of psychological terminology are con- siderable at the best, but in comparative psychology they stand out in all their enormity.

"We seethat bees show signs of an admirable memory in their orienta- tion, and also in other activities; further, I believe I have shown that the bee possesses a perception for color and form, and develops a rich capacity for communication . . . that, further, it is able to gather experience, to learn, and to form associations of impressions, etc." It is perhaps fair to say that Dr. v. Buttell gives us warning elsewhere that he does not always mean as anthropomorphic as he says. The printing of the work in this English edition leaves not a little to be desired. Lines five inches long in type as fine as that used in the body of the pages is none too easy to read, and when it becomes still finer type in the footnotes it offers positive difficulties. E. C.
