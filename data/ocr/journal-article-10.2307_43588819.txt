The excavations were directed by Professor Benjamin Mazar on behalf of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the Israel Exploration Society and the Israel Department of Antiquities (now the Israel Antiquities Authority). The Temple Mount excavations were conducted on a huge scale and eventually extended over an uninterrupted area of about eight acres. The remains of monumental structures were exposed in most of the area. The excavation frequently reached consid- erable depths, including the excavation of subterranean cisterns, channels, caves and other installations hewn in the bedrock. The ten years of excavation greatly illuminated many chapters of Jerusalem's rich and unique history. Monumental building complexes dating from the First and Second Temple, Roman, Byzantine and Umayyad periods were exposed. In addition, significant building complexes of the Hellenistic, Hasmonean, Roman, Crusader and Mamluk periods were uncovered. During the excavations the best professional and artistic talents were set to work in drawing the area plans, detailed plans and reconstructions, permitting an overall view of the remains. This investment bore immediate fruit in a better and more complete under- standing of the remains. Special attention was paid to study of certain categories of finds, such as the thousands of coins, the pottery lamps, the various kinds of inscriptions and stamps, etc. A great effort was made by the expedition to study, as comprehen- sively as possible, the hundreds of decorative architectural fragments. On the conclusion of the excavations in 1978, the finds did not immediately undergo further processing towards the publication of the final reports. Two preliminary reports written during the excavations appeared in Hebrew in Eretz-Israel 9 (1969) and 10 (1971). The first volume of the final reports (though it was not designated as such at that time), which dealt with the remains of the First Temple period, was written by Prof. Benjamin Mazar and Eilat Mazar and published in 1989 as Qedem 29. Other than these, numerous general descriptions, summaries, discussions and conclusions were published during and after the excavations. Especially noteworthy are three publi- cations written by Prof. B. Mazar: his book The Mountain of the Lord : Excavating in Jerusalem (New York 1975), the chapter "Jerusalem that Appears" in his book Excavations and Discoveries (Jerusalem 1986), pp. 15-76 (Hebrew) and the chapter "The Archaeological Excavations near the Temple Mount" in Jerusalem Revealed (ed. Y. Yadin, Jerusalem 1975), pp. 25-40. The great efforts made by Prof. B. Mazar to prepare a final report bore fruit only after he passed away in 1995, when the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities bestowed its patronage on the publication project and provided initial funding for the project's first steps. We are also most grateful to Prof. H. Tadmor for his support. The Temple Mount final reports project is being carried out according to a well-defined plan and timetable. Its aim is to publish comprehensive publi- cations for the various periods within a short time. In the first phase, which lasted from November 1997 until February 1998, three containers packed with thousands of excavation finds were transferred from the Israel Antiquities Authority to the Institute of Archaeology. During the many years between the end of the excavation and the transfer to the custody of the Antiquities Authority in 1989, the finds had been moved from storehouse to storehouse, suffering severe damage. Some of the finds, and part of the archive of notes, drawings and photographs, had been stolen or burnt, and many of the remaining items were in a state of disorder. The condition of the finds crammed into the containers was commen- surate with the hardship they had endured. Fortunately, dozens of area plans and many notes, including detailed data on loci and elevations, had been transferred directly to the Institute of Archaeology at the conclusion of the excavation. On the arrival of the containers at the Institute, several archaeology students were employed in the preliminary sorting of the finds, the notes on the thirty excavation areas and their loci, and the partial lists of topics prepared by the excavators. While processing the data we encountered numerous difficulties in connection with the excava- tion's documentation. We owe special thanks to the late Menahem Magen, who worked for seven years VIII</page><page sequence="6">PREFACE General plan of excavation areas. as a field archaeologist in the excavations and was also in charge of the recording and cataloging of the finds. Menahem, who passed away in 1999, was able to follow the publication project closely and encouraged us as the realizers of his heartfelt wish to see the publication of the excavation through to its conclusion. He advised on numerous matters regarding the form of the publication and elucidated the sometimes problematic field notes. His untimely death has left us deeply saddened. The reader will note that for some of the drawings and photographs published here no scale is given, since regrettably the scale is sometimes lacking from drawings and photographs of objects that cannot be physically located. Moreover, since in certain cases the archive contains only copies of drawings, some of the illustrations are inferior in quality. A few of the photographic negatives could not be found and we have thus been forced to publish working photographs used and annotated by the excavators during preliminary analysis. We wish to thank Dr. D. Bahat and Dr. R. Reich for their assistance in locating some of the negatives and slides of the excavations. According to the publication plan, the assemblages from the Byzantine, Roman and Herodian periods are to be published in the current phase. It was decided that the material would be best presented according to building complexes defined by period, an approach that conforms with the methodology of the excavators. The building complexes from the Byzantine period are relatively well preserved and their limits coincide more or less with their excavation areas. Congruity between a building complex and an excavation area greatly facilitates the processing of the data. For example, the large Byzantine structure that we have identified as a monastery lies entirely in Area XV at the foot of the Triple Gate, and the "House of the Menorot" is located in Area VI at the foot of the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount enclosure. This volume also presents a multi-room structure, which we suggest was a hospice, located mainly in Area XVII at the foot of the eastern end of the southern Temple Mount wall, and three probably residential dwellings in Areas III and XII, south of the central part of the southern Temple Mount wall (see the general plan). The building complexes were documented with emphasis on their architectural and stratigraphie characteristics and the diversity of their contents. The publication project of the Temple Mount IX</page><page sequence="7">PREFACE excavations is being carried out on behalf of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University in association with the Ingeborg Rennert Center for Jerusalem Studies and the Jerusalem Project of the C.G. Foundation at Bar Ilan University. The first phase of publication, which is partly represented by the present volume, is supported by the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, the Reuben and Edith Hecht Foundation and the Yad Hanadiv Foundation. Members of the scientific advisory board to the publication project are Dr. D. Bahat, Prof. G. Foerster, Prof. L. I. Levine, Prof. A. Mazar, Prof. Z. Safrai and Prof. Y. Schwartz. The research assistants of the project were Noam Adler, Yoni Mizrahi, Oved Pele, Orit Peleg and Lior Shapira. To all we extend our heartfelt gratitude. Every effort was made to allow as many scholars as possible to participate in the publication project; their contributions to this volume, which relate to special assemblages, appear as separate chapters. Consequently, some of the finds are presented within the context of their locus, while the special assemblages are discussed at the end of each Part. Many of the coin identifications were originally made by Prof. Y. Meshorer. Other identifications were made in 1993 by H. Sokolov and G. Bijovsky of the Israel Antiquities Authority. Selected coins were reviewed in 2002 by D. T. Ariel of the Israel Antiquities Authority, who updated their identifi- cation or dating in some cases. We are grateful to them all. The finds were drawn by Nili Cohen, Sara Halbreich, Margaret Ichelberg, Lilia Kirillov, Martha Ritmeyer, Marcel Sagi, Mika Sarig and Dalit Weinblatt-Krauss; the plans and reconstructions were prepared by Jeanie Greenwood, Ramona Kareis, Mark Kunin, Brian Lalor and Stas Stark; and the photographs were taken by Leonid Fedrol, Avinoam Glick, Gabi Laron, Micha Pan, Zev Radovan and Joseph Schweig; the final plates were prepared by Yiftah Shalev and Talya Goldman. The photograph of Prof. Mazar that appears on p. VII was taken by Stanley I. Batkin. We are especially grateful to Sue Gorodetsky, the editor of this volume. The excavators of the Temple Mount excavations took on themselves an enormously demanding task and, despite all the difficulties, succeeded in uncovering the remarkable remains that can be seen today in the excavation area. We hope that bringing the final reports to publication as planned will do justice to the excavations and to their great scientific contribution to the study of ancient Jerusalem. Although it is not possible to mention here the names of each and every individual who participated in the excavations over the years, we wish to express our sincere thanks and appreciation to all members of the expedition, some for the entire period and others for part of it. These include archaeologists, architects, photographers, artists and other profes- sionals, as well as thousands of volunteers from Israel and abroad and dozens of paid laborers. It was due to their skills and efforts that the fascinating history of this central quarter of the city came to light. We also owe gratitude to the bodies and insti- tutions in Israel and overseas and to the private individuals that were partners and supported the excavation project both materially and in spirit; to each of them we express our appreciation.

These complexes include a large Byzantine structure which we identify as a monastery, the adjacent small structure to its north which we reconstruct as a winery, and a large public building which may have served as a hospice. The first two structures extend over most of the western side of Area XV and the third structure, which is exceptionally well preserved, extends over the eastern part of Area XV and most of the western part of Area XVII. 1. THE LARGE BYZANTINE STRUCTURE IN AREA XV (THE MONASTERY) 1.1. Introduction The large Byzantine structure in Area XV was excavated in 1971-1972 (Photos 1.2-7). Though the Temple Mount publication project focuses on the results of the excavations conducted in 1968-1977, the structure's importance and the fact that its plans were incomplete prompted the decision to re-survey the structure and to include the revised plans in this volume (Mazar 1999). The Byzantine structure was built above earlier architectural remains. These remains consist primarily of an early cave of indeterminate age, which was probably used for burials, and a monumental building dating from the Second Temple period. These two early elements will be discussed prior to the discussion of the Byzantine structures. 1.2. Burial (?) cave (Locus 15099) A room was hewn into the bedrock of a natural cave located in the rear of the basement, north of Room 15022 (Plan 1.3 below; Photos 1.8-9). The western and northern walls of the room were hewn from the bedrock, while the southern and eastern walls were stone-built. Though the latter walls were almost entirely destroyed, the contours of the room were clearly visible along the ceiling, which was hewn flat into a rectangular shape measuring 2.70x4.80 m. It was possible to discern from the marks on the ceiling that the hewn room originally extended also over the area of the northern niche in Room 15022. W. 1582, which was built in the cave only during a later phase, separated the hewn room from Room 15022 to the south. The dimensions of the room following the construction of the wall were 3.25x5.20 m. The eastern and southern walls of the room were built from small and medium-sized fieldstones. About 1.50 m of the eastern part of the northern wall, W. 1580, was also stone-built. The eastern wall, W. 1581, separated the burial chamber from the eastern part of the cave, which could be accessed from the street located next to the eastern side of the building. A 75 cm wide entrance leading into the hewn room was located in the center of the southern wall. The entrance threshold was at the same level as the floor of the room. Burial (?) benches, 40-60 cm high, were hewn into the bedrock along the western and northern walls. The bench in the north was 60 cm wide and that in the west was 1 .70 m wide. The room resembles burial caves with burial benches that are characteristic of the First Temple period. In that period, however, it was not customary to bury the dead within the city limits and certainly not in this specific place, to the south of the Temple Mount where the fortified royal quarter of the city was located (Mazar and Mazar 1989: 58-60; Barkay 1990: 102-123). There is some evidence for burial 3</page><page sequence="10">CHAPTER ONE &gt; X -o Â§ &gt; X c Â« cd &lt;L&gt; &lt; #C T3 0 *c D Oh &lt;L&gt; .g *4-* 1 N &gt;&gt; m (D Â£ O (Z) Si S O c Â« (D Â£ &lt;4-H 0 Â§ E h- H 1 EC 4</page><page sequence="11">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY OF AREAS XV AND XVII Photo 1.1.

The research of the early burial caves on the Temple Mount is still in progress, and the characteristics of these burials will be discussed only after the publication of all the excavation areas. No finds were recovered from this room, nor were any burials found; they were probably removed from the chamber during later construction in this area. 1.3. The courthouse "at the Temple Mount's entrance" B. Mazar noted in his field diary that he had the impression that the large Byzantine building in Area XV incorporates earlier remnants of a large Herodian structure (Plans 1.2-3 below; Photos 1.10-16). This impression, which we share, was based primarily on . the character of the building's eastern wall and northern entrance courtyard (15005). In contrast with the typical Byzantine construction, both of these elements were built from large, finely dressed stones that were smoothly polished and very carefully fitted into place. Because of the excavators' desire to preserve the Byzantine building, the earlier remains on which the structure was built were not excavated and it was therefore not possible to evaluate their date. More remains that seem to belong to the Herodian construction were discerned in the outer walls of the Byzantine structure. The northern part of the building's outer, eastern wall was built of smoothly dressed and closely fitted stones which were covered with white plaster, with delicate molding indicating the joins between the stones. This construction style is very different from the construction visible in the southern part of the same wall, which is built of fairly coarse stones with many small fieldstones in between. In the Herodian wall there was apparently a doorway leading in the direction of Staircase 15031. The stairs of this staircase are well built of neatly dressed, rectangular stones and perhaps also belong to the Herodian construction in this area. The large niche in the eastern wall probably indicates the location of the early doorway. The walls of the two shops on either side of the entrance to the southern courtyard ( 1 5026) were also built in the Herodian style, as well as the lower part of the outer southern wall. Definite 8</page><page sequence="15">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY OF AREAS XV AND XVII Photo 1. 10. The eastern outer wall of the structure (at bottom of photograph), ground-floor rooms 1 5025 and 1 5028 A and basement rooms 15028 and 15032. View to the west. indications of the existence of an earlier building in the foundations of the Byzantine structure were recently obtained when the area was prepared to serve as an archaeological garden. In the course of this work, a thin wall abutting the building's outer, western wall was removed and the Herodian wall beneath it, including a sealed entrance, was exposed. Several of the Herodian floor's paving slabs were preserved at the height of the entrance's threshold. The remains of the extensive Herodian building exposed in the area of the Byzantine structure join the Herodian remains adjacent to the Temple Mount's southern wall, east of the Triple Gate, to form one large structure or complex. Mazar raised the possibility that this Herodian building, which was constructed in a most central place in the city where masses of pilgrims gathered in order to enter the Temple compound, was the courthouse "at the Photo 1.11.

Mazar 's proposal to identify the building as one of the three courts of the SanhÃ©drin on the Temple Mount is supported by the fragment of a Hebrew inscription (Photo 1.17) found in the excavations near the Triple Gate, close to the western side of the structure. In the inscription, the word [...zjkenim can be read, probably referring to the elders of the SanhÃ©drin (B. Mazar 1986: 26-27). The script greatly resembles that of the Aramaic burial inscription of King Uzziahu from the first century CE. In the nineteenth century de Saulcy discovered another fragment of this inscription in the same place, at the foot of the Triple Gate (Fig. 1.1). He proposed that this fragment was part of an Aramaic warning inscription, similar to two Greek warning inscriptions discovered on the Temple Mount that were intended to warn pagans against entering the sanctified compound (Sukenik 1931: 292). Naturally, de Saulcy was not familiar with the fragment discovered in the Temple Mount excavations, from which it is clear that the inscription is written in Hebrew, in a formal Jewish script of the first century CE, and not in Aramaic. Moreover, Josephus Flavius writes that warning inscriptions were written only in Greek and Latin 10</page><page sequence="17">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY OF AREAS XV AND XVII Photo 1.17. Fragment of a Hebrew inscription. Fig. 1.1. Drawing of the two joining fragments of a Hebrew inscription. {War, V, 193-194). The "elders" inscription may well have been a dedicatory inscription fixed to the wall of the courthouse. 1.4. The plan of the structure The plan of the large structure in Area XV (Plan 1.2) is that of a typical courtyard house of the Byzantine period (Hirschfeld 1995: 57-85). The structure is square, measuring 17.90x18.50 m, with a central courtyard around which the rooms are arranged. Of its three stories, the basement (Plan 1.3) and ground floor are in a surprisingly good state of preservation. However, only one small anteroom (15003) of the second floor has survived. The ground floor contained two entrances; the main entrance was on the south and a secondary entrance was at the northern end of the building's outer, western wall. The southern entrance led to what appears to have been a courtyard (15026), which was probably paved with stone slabs, like all the other courtyards in the structure. The paving stones were not preserved and were perhaps removed and used in construction during the second phase of the structure (see below). In the eastern wall of the courtyard was an entrance leading into a large rectangular room (15061). On the western side of the courtyard was a separate room (1 5063) whose only entrance was from the street. This room most likely functioned as a shop throughout the structure's existence. A set of stairs led from the southern entrance up to the central courtyard (15008), which measured 6.30x5.20 m. A gallery in the courtyard, supported by two decorated columns, roofed the entrances to the various wings of the house. An entrance in the courtyard's western wall led into a single room paved with stone slabs (15007). Shelves were built along the length of two of its walls. Two entrances were located in the courtyard's northern wall. The western entrance led to a paved secondary courtyard (15012) that served as an anteroom for those entering into the structure from the north. The opening of the central cistern was located in this anteroom. West of the anteroom was a room paved with mosaics (15006), which served as a storeroom. On the other side of the anteroom was a room (1501 1) in which many jars were found in situ. A cooking oven was built next to this room's northern wall, implying that this room served as a kitchen. An additional entrance to the kitchen was from the central courtyard. To the east of the kitchen was a room (15025) that was only partly preserved. In view of its proximity to the kitchen, it may have served as a storeroom. Two entrances were located in the eastern wall of the central courtyard. One led to the staircase descending to the basement ( 1 503 1 ). The other doorway was reached via a staircase with a decorated stone banister running along W. 1514 11</page><page sequence="18">CHAPTER ONE Plan 1.2.

From the top of the stairs one could turn right and ascend the steps to the gallery, from which the second-floor rooms could probably be entered. The secondary entrance to the ground floor of the building was located at the northern end of its outer, western wall. From this entrance one entered a paved courtyard ( 1 5005), in the corner of which was the opening of a large cistern. In the middle of the courtyard's southern wall was an entrance to the anteroom (15012). A round stone basin, probably used for washing, was found in situ to the left of this opening. An entrance in the courtyard's eastern wall led to a room with a mosaic floor (15019) in which were an oven and a plastered shelf. The basement extends beneath the eastern part of the ground floor (Plan 1.4). In the southern part of the basement was a room (15028 lower) with a plastered installation. A cross and a Greek inscription were painted in red on the lintel of the room's entrance. The inscription is an invocation, typical of the Byzantine period. In the northern part of the basement level was a room (15032) containing a plastered installation. Another room (15022) separates this room from the burial (?) cave (15099). Two niches were hewn into the bedrock along the western side of Room 15022. An ossuary of the Second Temple period, probably in secondary use as a reliquary, was found in the southern niche. There is clear evidence indicating that at some time modifications were carried out in several rooms (Plan 1.5). In the southern entrance courtyard (15026), which was originally open to the street, a ceiling and a southern wall with an entrance from the street were added to create a closed room. The original southern entrance of the structure in W. 1532 was sealed. We suggest that in this phase Locus 15026 functioned as a shop, detached from the main structure. The doorway from Locus 15026 to the large room to its east (15061) was also sealed, and a new entrance from the street was opened in the southern wall of Locus 15061. Consequently, the three rooms (with Locus 15063) on the south had no direct access to the rest of the building, and their only doorway faced the street. Following these changes it was necessary to create a new approach to the entrance of the main structure; access from the street was apparently from the roofs of the shops via a staircase that was not preserved. Thus, the level of the structure's southern entrance was raised to match the level of the rooftops and of the central courtyard. Several other changes were made in the interior plan of the structure. The two doorways in W. 1510, the northern wall of the central courtyard, were sealed, dividing the remaining part of the structure into two separate units. The only connection between them was through two windows that remained open in this wall. 1.5. Architectural characteristics The courtyards were stone-paved. A gallery in the central courtyard roofed the entrances to the ground floor rooms. Via the gallery one could also reach the rooms on the second story. Waste water was drained from the courtyards through openings hewn in the paving slabs to pipes leading out of the building. An outlet of this system of pipes can be seen in the outer face of the structure's eastern wall, coming from under Staircase 15031 (Photo 1.18). Two such drainage openings in the form of three-petalled Photo 1.18.

Similar drainage openings were found at the Monastery of Martyrius (Magen 1993: 61) and the monastery at Khirbet ed-Deir (Hirschfeld 1999: Fig. 64). A completely separate system of pipes that ran along the walls conveyed clean water from the roofs of the rooms directly into two large cisterns beneath the floors. The central cistern's opening was situated in the unroofed Anteroom 15012, and the opening of the other cistern was in the northern entrance courtyard (15005). There were two kinds of doorways in the structure. The first, intended to be fitted with a door, is wider on the inside, towards the room, and the stone jambs have hewn sockets for locking the door. The second type of doorway is of uniform width and was not closed with a a door. Doorways of the latter type are located only between the anteroom (15012) and the central courtyard (15008) and between the kitchen (15011) and its adjacent room (15025) and are indicative of functional connections between the rooms. Two windows facing the northern entrance courtyard (15005) were preserved. Both had downward-slanting sills to diffuse the light (Hirschfeld 1995: 258, Fig. 189). Similar windows were also preserved in the building's outer, eastern wall. These windows were originally fitted with grills, probably made of iron, as evidenced by the holes drilled in the stone window frames. The walls of most of the rooms were coated with plaster, in some cases of a bluish shade (Loci 15012 and 15006). The plaster was applied to the wall in three stages. First, a thick layer of coarse plaster containing numerous small stones was applied to the stone wall. A second, finer layer was then applied and impressed with triangular depressions to improve the adherence of the last layer of plaster, which was fine and smooth. This method of plastering is typical of construction during the Byzantine period (see, e.g., Crowfoot and Fitzgerald 1929: 48-49). Two rooms (15006 and 15019) were paved with plain white mosaics. The floors of the other rooms were either made from tamped earth or paved with stone slabs (15007). The floor of Room 15025, mostly stone-paved, was paved in one part, along the northern wall, with ceramic bricks. The brick- paved part of the floor may have had some connection with the niches built in the wall above it. THE SECOND FLOOR 1.6. Anteroom (Locus 15003) This small room functioned as an anteroom for the building's second story and was the only room preserved on this floor (Photo 1.19). The room was entered through a doorway in its western wall, directly from the level of the street (15023) that ran along the northern side of the building. From the anteroom one entered the rooms of the second story, probably through a doorway in the southern wall that was not preserved. The anteroom was rectangular and measured 1.50x3.30 m. Its walls were W. 1522, 1582, 1581 and 1519 on the north, east, south and west respectively. The walls had an Photo 1.19. General view of the structure, looking south. At the bottom left is Anteroom 15003, leading to the second story. 17</page><page sequence="24">CHAPTER ONE Photo 1.20. Iron door socket (Locus 15003, Reg. No. 15003/01; scale 1:2). average thickness of 50 cm and were preserved to a maximum height of two courses or 60 cm. The western wall was preserved only to the height of its threshold, 10 cm above the floor level. The threshold consisted of three stones with a groove 4 cm deep and 89 cm long running across their center. An iron door socket set in the northern part of the threshold was found in situ (Photo 1.20). Of the northern wall, only two stones of the first course above floor level were preserved, though the exterior side of this wall facing the street (15023) was preserved to a considerable height. Two plastered courses of the eastern wall were preserved above the floor level. The southern wall was preserved only in the western part of the room, to a height of two courses above the floor. The stones in this wall were smooth and closely fitted. The floor of the room (723.22 m) was made from smoothly dressed rectangular stone slabs measuring 60x70 cm that were precisely fitted into place. The eastern face of W. 1520 was also plastered, apparently indicating that there was another room to the east. An earlier wall built on the bedrock was partially preserved to the north of the building's outer, eastern wall. This wall was probably reused as a foundation for the room built above it. THE GROUND FLOOR 1.7. Northern entrance courtyard (Locus 15005) The courtyard was rectangular and measured 3.70x9.60 m (Photos 1.21-22, Fig. 1.2). Its walls were W. 1506, 1524, 1523 and 1598 in the north, east, south and west respectively. Along the outside Fig. 1.2. The northern entrance courtyard (15005), looking east (drawing by Jeanie Greenwood). 18</page><page sequence="25">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY OF AREAS XV AND XVII Photo 1.21. The northern entrance courtyard (15005), looking east. of the courtyard's northern wall ran Street 15023. Six courses of the wall were preserved to a height of 3.90 m; the lower 1 .20 m of the wall was hewn into the bedrock and was aligned with the face of the wall built above it. Four courses of the eastern wall were preserved to a maximum height of 2.30 m. The lower part of its northern end was also hewn from the bedrock, a continuation of the hewn base of the courtyard's northern wall. Five courses of the southern wall were preserved to a height of 2.00 m. As with the northern and eastern walls, the lower, western end was hewn from the bedrock to a height of 25 cm in line with the face of the stone-built wall above it. At the western end of the courtyard, abutting the northern and southern walls, were two arch-bearing pilasters measuring 50x60 cm. Nine courses of the northern pilaster were preserved to a height of 2.90 m, and three courses of the corresponding pilaster abutting the southern wall were preserved to a height of 50 cm. The walls were not plastered, nor was the courtyard apparently roofed; the numerous roof tiles found on the courtyard floor probably derive from the roof of the adjacent rooms on the second floor. The entrance into the courtyard was probably open between the two arch-bearing pilasters. Two fragments of the large stone threshold remained in situ ; since the continuation of this threshold is visible to the north of W. 1506, it is probably of the Herodian period. The southern part of the threshold consisted of a stone slab, 1 .20x 1 .50 m, with two steps hewn into it. The upper step was 65 cm deep, 1 .00 m long and 20 cm high and had a notch 20 cm wide and 6 cm deep running across its center. The lower step was 20 cm wide and 2 1 cm high. In the northern fragment of the threshold, the upper step also had a notch running 19</page><page sequence="26">CHAPTER ONE across it, which drained into a square plastered pit measuring 45x55x55 cm high. Of the lower step, only three stones remained. Two rectangular openings measuring 45x20 cm in the courtyard's northern wall were set 5.35 m apart at a height of 1.90 m above the floor. At some stage the western opening was blocked. Since these openings are below the level of the street to the north of the courtyard, they could not have served as windows. Their purpose may have been to drain excess rainwater from the fill beneath the street. A doorway in the courtyard's eastern wall led into Room 15019, and a doorway in the middle of the southern wall led into the rest of the building via Anteroom 15012. The latter doorway was flanked on either side by a window. The eastern window opened into Kitchen 15011 and just east of that was a chimney vent for the oven located in the kitchen. The western window opened into Storeroom 15006. The floor of the courtyard (719.72 m) was made from large, rectangular stone slabs, averaging 45x70 cm, which were finely dressed and fitted together. The paving slabs in the western half of the courtyard were smaller than those in the eastern half. This difference, as Mazar suggested in his field diary, may indicate that the two parts of the courtyard were paved in two different periods: the eastern part of the courtyard was originally Herodian, while the western part was paved with smaller stones in the Byzantine period. In one of the paving stones next to the threshold leading into Anteroom 15012 was a rosette-shaped drain opening, similar to that found in the anteroom. The water that drained into these openings was conveyed, along with the rest of the waste water, to the outside of the building. A large, round stone basin was discovered in situ next to the eastern side of the entrance into Anteroom 15012. It was 80 cm in diameter and 60 cm high and was apparently used for washing. The opening of a large cistern (15010) was found in the northwestern corner of the courtyard. The cistern opening, located in the center of the cistern's ceiling, was formed from a square stone slab measuring 80x72 cm that protruded 16 cm above the floor level. The round opening was 45 cm in diameter and had margins 10 cm wide. During the excavation several paving stones were removed from the courtyard's floor at the foot of W. 1506, Photo 1.22. The northern entrance courtyard (15005), looking east. 20</page><page sequence="27">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY OF AREAS XV AND XVII opposite the entrance into Anteroom 15012. Beneath them was a round hole quarried into the bedrock (15016), apparently an earlier cistern that was filled in to facilitate the construction of the courtyard above it. In the courtyard's northeastern corner was a very small rectangular room or instal- lation (15009; see description below), whose function is unclear. Pottery (Chapter 2) The pottery sherds found in the courtyard are typical of the end of the Byzantine period. Among them are a krater with thin walls (PL 1.16:3), complete jars with ribbed walls (PL 1.16:5-9), the upper part of a "Gaza jar" (PL 1.16:26) and a complete jug (PL 1.16:28). Other finds Numerous finds were recovered from the courtyard. These included an intact limestone capital that probably adorned a column that stood in the entrance (PL 1.1:1), four broken flat roof tiles, including two decorated on the edge with a combed pattern (Pl. 1. 1 :2) and two stamped with a plain cross (Pl. 1.1:3-4), and fragments of three convex roof tiles, one with an incised square (Chapter 9, Pl. 1.20:3), the second with two adjacent circles and the third with three adjacent circles. Fifty iron nails of various sizes, some with remains of partially burnt wood, were found about 1.50m above the floor level (Pl. 1. 1 :5). One of the nails was probably a cotter pin, resembling that found in Locus 15019. Also found was a copper alloy chain probably used to suspend an incense bowl, similar to the chain found in Locus 15019, and a copper alloy pendant decorated with a cross (PL 1.1:6). Especially interesting are a decorated copper alloy lock and clasps (PL 1.1:7), apparently from a large wooden box that has not survived. Similar clasps from the Byzantine period were discovered at Herodium and at Mount Nebo (Netzer 1981: 111. 11:13; Sailer 1941: 111. 135, Fig. 1:19). Similar but undecorated locks were found in the Tyropoeon Valley and were dated to the sixth century CE (Crowfoot and Fitzgerald 1929: 95, Fig. XIX: 16, 18). This lock is unusual in that its decoration apparently depicts an arched entrance or the domed apse of a church. A similar stylized depiction appears on an ampulla from the sixth century CE (Weitzmann 1979: No. 524). One of the most impressive finds from the courtyard floor is a large copper alloy cross (PL 1.1:8), typically Byzantine in style (Weitzmann 1979: No. 557). It measures 42x65 cm. On its back are three hooks with lumps of iron attached to them. This cross may have originally hung in the center of the apse of a chapel located on the second floor, and fallen to the courtyard after the destruction of the structure. 1.8. Small room (installation?) (Locus 15009) Locus 15009 was a small room, whose function is unclear, built on the stone pavement in the north- eastern corner of Courtyard 15005 (Photo 1.23). The room was rectangular and measured 1 .20x2.20 m. It was delineated by W. 1530, 1529, 1526 and 1524 to the south, west, north and east respectively. The southern and western walls, preserved to a height of 1.60 m and 35 cm wide, were made from small and medium-sized coarse fieldstones and considerable amounts of mortar. The cornerstones were partially smoothed and dressed. The lower parts of the northern and eastern walls were hewn from the bedrock. A 50 cm wide entrance to the room was Photo 1.23. The small room or installation (15009) in the northeastern corner of the northern entrance courtyard (15005), looking east. 21</page><page sequence="28">Pl. LI. Locus 15005.

The lower part of the eastern doorjamb consisted of one stone measuring 50x40 cm by 76 cm high. The floor was paved with stone slabs. Pottery A complete large candlestick lamp (Chapter 3, PL 1.17:7) was found in the locus. Other finds Two bronze coins (Chapter 4) were recovered, one dating from the reign of Anastasius I (498-518 CE, PL 1. 18:9) and the other apparently from the reign of Tiberius Maurice (593/4? CE). 1.9. Room (Locus 15019) Locus 15019 consists of a large rectangular room measuring 3.50x5.90 m, delineated by W. 1525, 1533, 1523 and 1524 on the north, east, south and west respectively (Photos 1.24-28). The walls were 88 cm thick and built from medium-sized and large square or rectangular stones, with many small and medium-sized fieldstones between them. Five or six courses of the room's walls were preserved to a maximum height of 1.80 m. The lower part of the western wall was built on the bedrock, which was hewn in line with the face of the wall. The western part of the northern wall was also hewn from the bedrock. In this place the bedrock protrudes half a meter into the room. The built part of the wall was plastered, and the plaster was preserved on most of the wall. We assume that the plaster also originally covered the hewn part of the wall that protrudes into the room. Remains of plaster were also preserved at the base of the eastern wall. In the center of the northern and southern walls were arch-bearing pilasters, each preserved to a height of 1.50 m; the pilasters were also plastered. The northern pilaster measured 65x45 cm and the southern pilaster 60x40 cm. They were built directly on the pilasters in the room below (15022). The room's entrance was located in the southern part of the western wall. The doorway, 1.20 m wide on the outside and 1.35 m wide on the inside, was narrowed to 0.90 m at some time. The doorway was preserved (without the lintel) to a height of 1 .75 m. The outer, narrower part of the threshold was built from one course of flat stones 7 cm high (719.93 m). The wider part of the threshold was flush with the room's floor. Cooking installations were built in the room's northwestern corner. The westernmost installation Photo 1.24. Room 15019, looking northwest. was an oven facing south, hewn into the bedrock protrusion. In its base was a horizontal line of five round hewn openings. Above them were two hewn plastered recesses, one round and the other more elongated. There was a vertical hole, 6 cm in diameter, apparently meant for a ceramic pipe, in the Photo 1.25. The northwestern corner of Room 15019, looking east. 25</page><page sequence="32">CHAPTER ONE Photo 1.26. The northwestern corner of Room 15019, looking north. oven's western wall. East of the oven was a plastered, built partition, 15 cm wide, and preserved to a height of 70 cm. The partition separated the oven from a plastered rectangular shelf measuring 0.45 X 1 .00 by 0.75 m high to the east. The floor of the room, at elevation 719.86 m, was paved with a plain white mosaic. It was preserved Photo 1.27. A close-up view of the burnt layer in Room 15019. Photo 1.28. The northwestern corner of Room 15019 during the excavation, looking north. only in the western part of the room, since the rest of the floor had collapsed into the room below. The excavators stated in their notes that there was evidence of a significant conflagration among the destruction debris in the room. Pottery (Chapter 2) Among the pottery recovered from the locus were a complete, deep small bowl similar to bowls found in the other rooms of the building (Pl. 1.16.1), a fragment of a small black bowl with an applied decoration of two human faces (PI. 1.16:2), large fragments of two jars with ribbed walls (PL 1.16:18), a complete amphoriskos with an incised body and a long neck (PI. 1.16:27), two complete juglets with high, thickened bases, decorated with diagonal incisions on the shoulder (PI. 1.16:32-33) and an amphoriskos-shaped votive juglet (PI. 1.16:38). Other finds A fragment of a small marble Corinthian capital (PI. 1.2:1) was found, as well as a ceramic pipe (PI. 1.2:6). There were several exceptionally well Pl. 1.2. Locus 15019. No. Object Reg.

Also found were lumps of iron, about thirty iron nails of different sizes (PL 1.2:4) similar to those found in other rooms in the building, a large iron ring, iron clasps and many pieces of iron strips with the remains of nails in them, all perhaps deriving from some sort of wooden object that was not preserved. A few burnt pieces of woven cloth were found on the floor of the room, next to the oven (PL 1.2:5). Four of the pieces were examined in the laboratory of the Division of Identification and Forensic Science, Police Headquarters, Jerusalem. These pieces measure 4.5x3.5 cm, 2^5 cm, 4x1.5 cm and 4.5x4.5 cm. Though the pieces are badly burnt, there are indications that they had multiple layers. The cloth is a 2x2 basket weave, in which the threads all have an S-twist and appear to consist of a single strand. The cloth is too badly burnt for identification of the type of fiber.* The delicacy of the cloth indicates that it was used as a cover of some sort. A fragment of a clay disk, about 10 cm in diameter, bears an inscription and stylized decoration in relief of what seems to be a church with a cross (see Chapter 6, PL 1.19:4). Five bronze coins were found, two of which were poorly preserved. Two, of Theodosius I, are dated to 383 and 383-392 CE (Chapter 4); another (No. 1952), not currently in our possession, was dated in the excavators' notes to the sixth century CE. 1.10. Anteroom (Locus 15012) Locus 15012 was a rectangular anteroom measuring 4.60x3. 10 m and delineated by W. 1523, 1531, 1510 and 1508 on the north, east, south and west respec- tively (Fig. 1.3, Photos 1.29-35). The walls of the room were 80 cm wide and built from medium-sized and large square and rectangular stones with small * We wish to thank Mrs. Avigail Sheffer, who studied the fabric pieces, and Mr. Azriel Gorski of the Division of Identification and Forensic Science, who examined them in the laboratory. 28</page><page sequence="35">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY OF AREAS XV AND XVII Fig. 1.3. Anteroom 15012, looking west (drawing by Jeanie Greenwood). and medium-sized fieldstones between them. Six courses of the plastered walls of the room were preserved, to a maximum height of 2.65 m. In each of the room's walls was a doorway. The doorway in the western part of the northern wall was also the northern entrance to the building's ground floor. The inside of the doorway was 1.20 m wide and the outside 1.00 m wide. The threshold consisted of a large stone, 1.55x0.81 m, with a recess surrounded by raised margins hewn into its top. The narrow part of the threshold was 8 cm higher than its wider part Two door sockets were hewn into the corners of the Photo 1.31. The western wall of Anteroom 15012 including a Herodian building stone in secondary use. Two of the three plaster layers on the wall are visible. threshold. Although the lintel did not survive in situ , the entrance was preserved to its full height. In the southern part of the eastern wall was an entrance leading to Kitchen 15011. The lintel consisted of a finely dressed stone that was completely preserved and measured 0.40x0.45 x 1 .40 m. Another doorway, 1 .20 m wide, was located in the eastern part of the southern wall; this doorway was blocked in the building's later phase. Its fully preserved lintel, consisting of a finely dressed monolith, measured 0.40x0.55x1.77 m. Two steps led down from this doorway into the central courtyard (15008). Since it Photo 1.32.

The entrance into Storeroom 15006 was located in the southern part of the western wall. The lintel was not preserved. The floor of the room (719.34 m) was paved by white limestone slabs with an average size of 1 .10x0.70 m, which were chiseled smooth and fitted together into place. The opening of a large cistern (15017), which served as the building's main water reservoir, was located at the base of W.1508, just north of the entrance to Storeroom 15006. The cistern opening had a 70 cm square stone frame, was 25 cm high and had margins 10 cm wide. Southeast Photo 1.34. An architectural fragment from the Herodian period in secondary use in W. 1508. of the cistern opening was a rosette-shaped drain opening cut into the floor, similar to that in the northern entrance courtyard (15005). The drain was not connected to the cistern and apparently led into the drainage system that conveyed waste water out of the structure, probably via the pipe that passed beneath the stairs in Locus 15031 and outside through the building's eastern wall. This room served as the building's anteroom and was apparently unroofed, like Courtyard 15005. Pottery (Chapter 2) Many pottery sherds dating from the end of the Byzantine period were found. There were also a complete juglet decorated with diagonal incisions on the shoulder (PL 1.16:34) and a fragment of a flask decorated with a stamped floral design on the body (PL 1.16:40). Other finds A large architectural fragment of the Herodian period was found in secondary use in the western wall of the room (Photo 1.34). Also found in the destruction debris was a fragment of a marble Corinthian capital (PL 1.3:1). Numerous roof tiles were found, including two convex tiles and a flat tile, each stamped on the edge with a plain cross (PL 1.3:2) and three convex roof tiles, one incised with a three-toothed comb on the edge (Chapter 9, PL 1.20:9) and the other two stamped on the edge with two concentric circles (PL 1.3:3-4). A rectangular stone basin, 30x60 cm by 20 cm high, was found not in situ on the floor of the room, near the southeastern corner (Photo 1.35). Also found were fragments of ceramic pipes of various sizes, two fragments of an Photo 1.35.

Storeroom (Locus 15006) A rectangular room, 4.60x3.50 m, delineated by W. 1523, 1508, 1510 and 1513 on the north, east, south and west respectively (Photos 1.36-40). The room's walls, 75 cm thick, were built from medium-sized to large square and rectangular stones, with numerous small and medium-sized fieldstones in between. The walls of the room were covered with plaster, which sometimes appears to have a bluish tint. Five courses of the walls were preserved to a maximum height of 2. 1 5 m. The lower parts of the northern and western walls were lined with square, orange ceramic tiles measuring 27x27 cm, protruding 15 cm from the wall. The tiles were laid in two courses to a height of 60 cm in the northwestern corner of the room, and continued as one course along the entire continuation of the northern wall and for 2.95 m of the western wall. Two large fragments of Herodian- style building stones in secondary use were incorpo- rated in the walls of the room. The entrance from Anteroom 15012 was at the southern end of the eastern wall. The entrance was 1.00 m wide on the 31</page><page sequence="38">CHAPTER ONE Photo 1.36. Storeroom 15006, looking southeast. inside and 80 cm on the outside. The lintel was not preserved. The threshold was hewn entirely from the bedrock. The wider part of the threshold was 20 cm below the level of the floor of the room and 3 cm lower than the narrow part of the threshold. From the narrow threshold one descended 12 cm to a step built from a stone slab that was 14 cm higher than the floor level in Anteroom 15012. A door socket was hewn in the northern side of the wide part of the Photo 1.37. The western wall of Storeroom 15006, showing the ceramic tiles at the base of W 1513. threshold. A plastered niche 40 cm wide was located in the southern wall of the room, 1.30 m above floor level. The upper portion of the niche was not preserved. In the eastern side of the northern wall, there was a plastered window whose upper part was not preserved. The width of the window tapered from 85 cm on the inside to 75 cm on the outside. The floor of the room (719.81m) was of plain white mosaic. Excavations were continued in the area in 1998 on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority, during preparation of the site as an archaeological park. The western face of the building's outer western wall was exposed. It is now clear that this wall, W. 1513, predates the Byzantine structure and that it extended the entire length of Storeroom 15006 and continued to the south. An earlier opening at the southern end of W. 1513 was sealed up. The threshold of the doorway was at elevation 721.50 m, indicating that the floor of the earlier, Herodian construction was higher than that of the Byzantine period. Photo 1.38. The western wall of Storeroom 15006 with a Herodian building stone in secondary use. The "negatives" of the ceramic tiles that lined W. 1513 are visible along the base of the wall. The excavators stated in their field notes that on the floor of the room were large quantities of ash and evidence of a severe conflagration and that the destruction debris contained many fragments of stone window frames. They also recorded that complete storage jars filled with legumes were found in the room. One jar contained beans and others lentils, as well as a small quantity of chickpeas. 32</page><page sequence="39">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY OF AREAS XV AND XVII Photo 1.39. A funnel-shaped window in the northern wall of Storeroom 15006. Photo 1.40. The smoothed plaster in Storeroom 15006. Pottery (Chapter 2) A considerable number of pottery vessels were found in the room. Among them were a wide variety of bowl sherds, including examples with painted decoration, incised wavy patterns and Red Ware bowls. Three complete, small bowls are of particular interest: they are tall and delicate and resemble small bowls found elsewhere in the building (e.g. PL 1.16:1). Other types found in the room include a complete casserole and its lid (Pl. 1. 16:4), at least six complete jars (PL 1.16:10-13, 19-20), a strainer jug with a decoration of dribbled black paint (PL 1.16:30), a complete juglet with a brown slip (PL 1.16:39), a complete Fine Byzantine Ware juglet (PL 1.16:36) and a flask decorated with black and brown painted geometric patterns on a white slip (PL 1.16:41). Other finds Finds in the locus included a copper alloy cross with the remains of the nails used to hang it and part of the hanger from a doorknocker ring attached (PL 1.4:1); an identical cross, which is excellently preserved, was found in Room 15019. Part of a decorative attachment from a multi-armed copper alloy lamp was recovered from the destruction layer (PL 1.4:2). The attachment is intentionally sinuous in shape, with a dragon-like head at its end. It resembles the multi-armed copper alloy lamps of the sixth century CE with a stylized cross in the center (Weitzmann 1979: No. 557). The similarity between the decorated arm of the lamp and that on an ember pan discovered in the Monastery of Martyrius from the sixth century CE (Magen 1993: 66-67) should be noted. About 150 iron nails, of various sizes and bent from use (PL 1.4:3), were found, as well as two iron doorknocker rings of identical size (PL 1.4:4) and a copper alloy lamp attachment ending in a leaf (PL 1.4:5). Two copper alloy lamp handles were discovered, one decorated with a small cross (PL 1.4:6-7). This type of lamp appears in the sixth century CE and is similar to the lamp with a lid and stake-like base found in Room 15019; these lamps often have split handles (Weitzmann 1979: No. 556). A group of iron weapons found in the room was probably the personal equipment of a soldier (see Chapter 11) and included a sword (PL 1.27:2), a scabbard (?) (PL 1.27:3), a pickaxe (PL 1.27:4) and a dagger (?) (PL 1.27:5). Other finds included an architectural fragment (PL 1.4:8) and a fragment of a convex roof tile stamped with a plain cross on the edge (PL 1.4:9) The following miscellaneous small items were also found in the room: a fragment of an ivory tablet decorated with incised circles and lines (PL 1.4: 11), seven flat ivory beads (PL 1.4:12), all of the same type, a black stone weight perforated in the center (PL 1.4:13) and a round object made from ivory, perhaps the top of a staff, split and scorched by fire (PL 1.4:10). Five bronze coins were also recovered from the room (see Chapter 4). Two date from Year Two of the Jewish Revolt (67/68 CE), one was minted in Aelia Capitolina and dates from the second century CE, apparently from the reign of Elagabalus, one is from the reign of Trajan Decius (249-251 CE) or Herennius Etruscus (25 1 CE) and the latest is from the reign of Constantine I (330-337 CE, PL 1.18:1). 33</page><page sequence="40">Pl. 1.4.

Kitchen (Locus 15011) The room was rectangular, measuring 4.65x3.25 m, and was delineated by W. 1523, 1514, 1510 and 1531 on the north, east, south and west respectively (Photos 1.41-44). The walls were 85 cm thick and built from medium-sized and large square and rectangular stones. Numerous small and medium- sized fieldstones were used in conjunction with the larger stones. The walls of the room were plastered. Seven courses of the walls were preserved to a maximum height of 2.70 m. Two steps led down into the room from the entrance located at the southern end of the western wall. The doorway was 1 .00 m wide on the inside and 85 cm towards the outside. The lintel was preserved in its entirety. An oven was built against the center of the northern wall. Above it, a ventilation opening measuring 80^30 cm and tapering in size down to 40x25 cm was cut through 35</page><page sequence="42">CHAPTER ONE Photo 1.41. Kitchen 15011, looking northeast. the wall into Courtyard 15005. A window, 73 cm wide, was set into the western end of the northern wall, 1.80 m above floor level. The stone-built windowsill was plastered and sloped steeply downwards towards the room. The upper portion of the window was not preserved. In the southern part of the eastern wall was an entrance into Room Photo 1.42. Kitchen 15011, looking north. 15025, with two steps leading up to it. A window, 65x55 cm, was located 1.45 m above floor level in the eastern part of the southern wall. A doorway in the western part of the southern wall led into the room from the central courtyard (15008), and a doorway in the western wall gave access from the anteroom (15012). The entrance from the courtyard was 90 cm wide on the inside and 76 cm on the outside. The lintel, made from a finely dressed stone measuring 0.50x1.10 m, was preserved intact. There was a rectangular socket for closing the door in the wall of the eastern doorjamb. During the later phase of the building's use, the lower half of the entrance was blocked, leaving a square window 90 cm above the floor. The floor of the room (719.00 m) was made from tamped earth. Nine complete jars were found on the floor. A complete cooking oven, built on the floor, was found next to the northern wall of the room. The oven was made from small and medium- sized stones with quantities of mortar between them. The oven's two walls were perpendicular to the northern wall and parallel to each other; they were 36</page><page sequence="43">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY OF AREAS XV AND XVII Photo 1.44. The oven and the ventilation opening in the northern wall of Kitchen 15011. 60 cm apart and 80 cm in length, 20-30 cm wide and 90 cm high. The top of the oven was barrel-shaped and reached a height of 1 .20 m above the floor. The southern side of the oven faced the inside of the room and was completely open. A whole thermos jug was found next to the western side of the oven. Beneath the floor of the room, next to the entrance to Room 15025, was an early shaft hewn into the bedrock with steps leading down into it (15027). This shaft was originally connected to the natural cave that extended over a considerable area of the basement level in the northeastern part of the structure. The shaft, whose original function is unclear, was blocked with the Byzantine construction. A complete pink marble column, 30 cm in diameter by 2.15 m in length, was found in secondary use in a horizontal position at the base of the southern entrance into the room. The column was found cracked and in situ. We assume that it served as a shelf after the doorway was sealed in the building's later phase. Pottery (Chapter 2) Many fragments of pottery vessels were recovered from the room. These include two complete small, deep bowls identical to complete bowls found in Storeroom 15006 (PL 1.16:1), at least nine complete jars found on the floor, five of them (PL 1.16:14-17, 21) with wide, ribbed bodies and two decorated with white painted stripes (PL 1.16:22-23), a holemouth jar with a wide, ribbed body (PL 1.16:24), a holemouth jar with a sort of perforated gutter on the shoulder and combed decoration (PL 1.16:25), a jug with a ribbed body and mold-made lamps. Noteworthy among the sherds are one of a juglet with a thickened flared rim (PL 1.16:37), a fragment of a juglet with incised lines adorning the shoulder (PL 1.16:35) and the upper portion of an amphora. Of special interest is a spouted jug whose lower part consists of a perforated stand (PL 1.16:31). This vessel, found intact near the cooking oven, is the earliest pottery thermos jug known to us. Other finds A pink marble column was found in secondary use at the foot of the southern doorway. Also found were seven convex roof tiles with stamped circles on their edges, Ave with one circle (PL 1.5: 1-4; Chapter 9, PL 1.20:2), one with two concentric circles (Chapter 9, PL 1.20:5) and one with three adjacent circles (Chapter 9, PL 1.20:4); four flat roof tiles, two with a stamped circle (PL 1.5:5), one stamped Photo 1.43.

Four bronze coins were found (Chapter 4); one is from the reign of Demetrius II ( 1 62-1 50 BCE, PL 1.18:4), the second from the reign of the procurator Valerius Gratus (17-24 CE) and the two latest from the reign of Valentinius II (378-383 CE, PL 1.18:5). 1.13. Room (Locus 15025) This locus consists of a rectangular room measuring 4.20*4.80 m, defined by W. 1523, 1533, 1510 and 1 5 14 on the north, east, south and west respectively. The walls were 80 cm wide and built from medium- sized and large square or rectangular stones with many small and medium-sized fieldstones between them. The walls, of which up to six courses were preserved to a maximum height of 2.17 m, were plastered. The entrance into the room, with a uniform width of 90 cm, was located in the southern part of the western wall. The lintel was not preserved. The threshold was built from stones set flush with the level of the floor. Only the lower half of the northern wall was preserved, along with two plastered, rectangular niches that were missing their upper parts. One niche, 35 cm wide by 40 cm deep, was situated in the middle of the wall, 96 cm above the floor. The other one, 85 cm to its east, was 45 cm above the floor and measured 40 cm deep by 40 cm wide. The eastern wall was preserved only in the northeastern corner of the room, where it stood to a height of two courses. The southern wall too was completely destroyed in its eastern part; its western part was preserved diagonally up to its full height in the southwestern corner of the room. The floor of the room (719.49 m) was preserved only along the northern wall. The paving consisted of square ceramic tiles measuring 24x24 cm immediately below the niches in the northern wall and stone slabs in the rest of the room. Destruction debris was found on top of the preserved portions of the floor, but most of the contents of the room apparently fell, together with the bulk of the floor, into Room 15032 located in the basement below. Some of the finds from this room relate to those from the adjacent room to the north (1501 9), such as the small incense bowl and its suspension chain, each found in a separate room. In view of its proximity to the kitchen, the room may have served as a storeroom. Pottery Many fragments of pottery vessels were found, including a small fragment of the stamped base of a Red Ware bowl (Chapter 2, PL 1.16:42) and a candlestick lamp (Photo 1.45). Photo 1.45. Candlestick lamp (Locus 15025, Reg. No. 15025/08; scale 1:2). Other fÃ¬nds A fragment of a marble altar table (PL 1.6:13), similar to one found at Khirbet ed-Deir in the Judean Desert and dated there to the early sixth century CE (Hirschfeld 1992: 39, 125, Fig. 62), was found in the locus. The following objects were also found: a piece of a chancel screen (PL 1.6: 1) and another with a floral pattern (Chapter 10, Pl. 1.25:1), seven archi- tectural fragments, some decorated with acanthus leaves (PL 1.6:3-9), a fragment of a convex roof tile with a plain cross stamped on its edge (PL 1.6: 10), a fragment of a flat roof tile with a stamp of the Tenth Legion (PL 1.6:11) and a complete copper alloy incense bowl (PL 1.6:12). On the bowl's rim are three rings for connection of the suspension chain. The bowl's chain was found in the adjacent room (15019). This type of incense bowl dates from the sixth and early seventh centuries CE (Weitzmann 1979: Nos. 563, 564). A body fragment of a jug (PL 1.6:2) bears a Greek inscription painted in red, apparently the name Theodorus. One bronze coin dating from the reign of Anastasius I (498-518 CE) was also found (see Chapter 4). 1.14. Central courtyard (Locus 15008) The building's central courtyard, which measured 5.30x6.35 m, was delineated by W. 1510, 1514, 1532 and 1512 on the north, east, south and west respectively (Photos 1.46-52, Figs. 1.4-5).

The central courtyard ( 1 5008), looking north. medium-sized square and rectangular stones, with only a few small fieldstones in the spaces between them. Seven plastered courses, were preserved to a maximum height of 3.06 m. A doorway, which served as the main entrance to the building from the south through the outer courtyard (15026), was located in the western part of the southern wall. From the outer courtyard (15026) one ascended about a meter by a staircase that was not preserved to the doorway, from which a flight of stairs 1.60 m high led up into the central courtyard. The doorway, built from finely dressed, smooth rectangular stones, was 1 .20 m wide on the inside and 1 .05 m on the outside. Its height was originally higher than that of the other doorways in the structure. Seven courses of the doorjambs were preserved, to a height of 2.80 m. A cross with broad arms was hewn into a recess in the third course of the doorway's eastern doorjamb. During the later phase of the building's use the entrance was blocked, the stairs leading up to the courtyard were dismantled and the level of the entrance area was raised to that of the courtyard. This change necessitated only a small change in the southern wall of Courtyard 15008, because the doorway was originally exceptionally high. Access into the building was now probably via stairs, which were not preserved, by which one ascended to the roof of the shop at the front of the building. A doorway in the northern part of the courtyard's western wall led into Room 15007. In the northwestern corner of the courtyard was an installation plastered both inside and out. The floor of the installation was hewn out of the bedrock and was a few centimeters higher than the floor level of the courtyard. The rectangular installation measured 60x90 cm, 60 cm high and 35 cm deep on the inside. There were two drainage openings at the base of the installation, the eastern drain conveying waste water outside the building and the northern drain conducting clean water into the building's central cistern. The lower parts of the walls in the north- western corner of the courtyard were hewn from the bedrock and formed the northern and western sides of the installation. A doorway in the western part of the courtyard's northern wall led into Anteroom 15012. This doorway was of a uniform width of 1 .20 m and was one course higher than the other doorways in the structure. In the building's later phase the doorway was completely blocked. A doorway in the eastern part of W. 1510 led into Kitchen 15011; this doorway too was sealed during Photo 1.47.

A small rectangular window, 65x50 cm, located just to the east of the doorway and 1.82 m above the floor, opened onto Kitchen 1 50 1 1 . A doorway in the northern part of the eastern wall led to the staircase (15031) descending to the rooms in the basement. The lintel of this doorway consisted of a single stone measuring 0.46x0.32x1.73 m. Immediately to the right of the doorway were seven stairs, each a meter wide with an average height of 16 cm, built along the eastern wall. The stairs were made from smooth, finely dressed rectangular stones, closely fitted together. A decorative banister that enclosed the staircase on the west was preserved only at its northern end, at the foot of the stairs. The post at the front of the banister was shaped like a column with a Corinthian capital. The banister was built from stone slabs with incised lines delineating the margins. The landing above the seventh stair was not preserved. There was a ceramic pipe next to the wall in the southeastern corner of the landing. From the landing one could turn left towards Room 15028 (upper), continue 44</page><page sequence="51">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY OF AREAS XV AND XVII Photo 1.50.

The courtyard's floor (718.77 m) was paved with finely dressed, smooth, rectangular stone slabs averaging 40x60 cm in size. A Herodian architec- tural fragment in secondary use was incorporated into the floor at the bottom of the staircase, next to the doorway that led to the staircase (15031). During the building's later phase a small rectangular room, 2.95 X 1 .80 m, was built in the southern portion of the courtyard. Its walls, which were mostly destroyed, were W. 1596, 1597, 1532 and 1595 on the north, east, south and west respectively. The walls were about 50 cm wide and were best preserved in the northeastern corner, where three courses stood to a maximum height of about one meter. In this phase the bases of the two columns that supported the gallery were incorporated into the northern wall of the small room. The bases of the columns were made from two octagonal drums 50 cm in diameter. The upper drum was decorated with a pattern of arches, while the lower drum, preserved only in the eastern base, was plain. Only half of the eastern column was found in situ. To the west of the western base, the courtyard's bedrock floor was hewn flush with the bottom level of the base (7 1 8.76 m) for a distance of 2.15 m. The three stones arranged in a straight vertical line in the northern wall are probably the remains of the doorjamb of the entrance to the small room. It is not clear whether the room was roofed. During the building's first phase there was a staircase 1.60 m high and 3.30 m long in the south- western corner of the courtyard. In the later phase, the stairs were removed and the area was leveled to the height of the courtyard; this fill was designated Locus 15035 (see below). Pottery (Chapter 2) Many pottery vessels and fragments were found, including the base of a Red Ware bowl stamped with a gazelle (Pl. 1. 14: 1 1), an intact small, deep bowl (PL 1.14:4) belonging to a type found in the other rooms (e.g. PL 1.16:1 from Storeroom 15006), a complete cup (PL 1.14:5) and a complete jar decorated with diagonal parallel lines and spirals in white paint (PL 1.14:6).

A cross hewn into the eastern doorpost in the southern entrance to the central courtyard (15008). Other finds An architectural fragment decorated with a pattern of running triangles was incorporated, in secondary use, among the paving slabs of the floor of the courtyard (PL 1.7:1). It is similar to the table fragment from Locus 16063 (below, p. 64). Also found were a fragment of a Corinthian capital (PL 1.7:2) and a fragment of a small marble column, fragments of four ceramic pipes of different sizes (Pl. 1.7:3), a piece of a convex roof tile stamped with a plain cross, a complete iron hammer head (PL 1.7:4) and poorly preserved pieces of a second hammer, and a seal-ring with the Greek inscription Theodulus Olybr(ius) (son) of Olybri(us) and additional monograms (see Chapter 6, Pl. 1.19:6). Two bronze coins were recovered from the locus (Chapter 4), one dating from the reign of Honorius (395-408 CE, PL 1.18:3) and the other, badly worn, dating from the late fourth to early fifth centuries CE. 1.15. Fill beneath courtyard floor (Locus 15035) This locus contained the fill beneath the south- western corner of the courtyard's floor. The fill was deposited during the building's later phase, when the entrance stairs from the south were removed and the area was leveled to match that of the floor of Courtyard 15008. Pl. 1.7.

Other finds A flat roof tile stamped with a plain cross was found in the fill. Twelve coins were found, only some of which could be identified (Chapter 4). The earliest two date from the reign of Alexander Jannaeus (103-76 BCE, PI. 1.18:9). The others include one from the reign of Constantine I (316 CE, Pl. 1.18:10), one from the reign of Valentinian I (367-375 CE, Pl. 1.18:11), one from the late fourth or early fifth century CE and one from the reign of Justinian I (538-542 CE). 1.16. Room (Locus 15007) This locus was a rectangular room that measured 5.20x4.05 m and was delineated by W. 1510, 1512, 1532 and 1513 on the north, east, south and west respectively (Photos 1.53-57). The walls, 75 cm wide, were built from roughly dressed medium- sized and large square and rectangular stones. Small and medium-sized fieldstones filled the spaces between them. Of the plastered walls five courses were preserved, to a height of 2.50 m. The entrance into the room, in the northern part of the eastern wall, was from the central courtyard (15008). The doorway was 1.00 m wide on the inside and 85 cm on the outside. The lintel comprised a single stone that measured 0.45x0. 30x 1 .75 m and was preserved in situ , 1.75 m above the floor level. The threshold, hewn from the bedrock, was 2 cm higher in its narrow part than its wider part. A rectangular instal- lation hewn into the bedrock, whose function is unclear, ran along the entire northern wall. The width of the installation varied from 55 cm near the entrance to 65 cm further west. The installation was bordered on the south by a hewn channel that predated the construction of the Byzantine structure; its continuation was visible outside, beyond the building's western wall. The installation was best preserved on its western side. The floor of the instal- lation, laid on the bedrock, consisted of ceramic tiles that were bordered on the southern edge by a Photo 1.53. Room 15007, looking northeast. stylized pedestal with a small column base above it, lying on its side in secondary use. There was a ceramic pipe in the room's western wall 28 cm above the installation, though it is not known where the pipe led. Most of the room's southern wall and southwestern corner were severely damaged. In the field photographs taken at the time of the excavation, the remains of a built installation, the upper portion of which was plastered, are visible along the eastern part of W. 1532. The floor of the room (718.92 m) was paved with smooth, rectangular stones averaging 45x25 cm. A layer of burnt destruction debris was found on the floor. Photo 1.54.

The installation in the northwestern corner of Room 15007, looking north. In the course of work conducted in 1998 during preparation of the area for the archaeological park, the western face of the building's western, outer wall was exposed. It was ascertained that this wall, W. 1513, predates the construction of the Byzantine structure. This earlier wall, which probably dates from the Herodian period, was preserved in the northern segment of Room 15007's western wall. In addition, several paving stones of the earlier room's floor were discovered in situ at elevation 721.50 m, 2.50 m higher than the Byzantine floor. Pottery (Chapter 2) Many pottery sherds were found, including three decorated bowls (PL 1.14:2, 9, 10), a small deep bowl belonging to a type found elsewhere in the 48</page><page sequence="55">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY OF AREAS XV AND XVII Photo 1.56.

Other finds A pedestal with a small column base was found in secondary use in the installation in the northwestern corner of the room. A limestone lintel (?) (PI. 1.9:1) decorated in relief with a wreath of leaves and a cross in its center was also found. The lintel is currently not in our possession; however, there are a sketch and drawing of it in the excavators' notes. The decoration of the wreath and cross is character- istic of lintels and chancel screens from the Byzantine period (see Chapter 10). Also found were an architectural fragment (PI. 1.9:2), three flat roof tiles, one stamped with a leaf (Chapter 9, PL 1.20:8) and two stamped with an eight-spoked wheel (Chapter 9, PL 1.20:6), a convex roof tile stamped on the edge with a plain cross (Chapter 9, PL 1.20:1) and two roof tiles with stamps of the Tenth Legion, one (PL 1.9:3) possibly belonging to Type IIg6 in Barag's classification (Barag 1967) and the other an unidentified type of stamp. A complete iron umbo (Chapter 1 1, Pl. 1.27: 1) was found on the floor of the room. A complete copper alloy hearth with decorative animal legs (PL 1.9:5) was also found on the floor. The hearth is equipped with two copper alloy rings for suspension on each side. An iron ladle (PL 1.9:4) with a 30 cm handle is very similar to a ladle found in Syria that dates from the sixth century CE (Weitzmann 1979: No. 537). Other copper alloy items found in the locus include a delicate chain (PL 1.9:6) and two thin coin-like discs connected by a short chain (PL 1.9:7). A bronze coin dating from the reign of Justinian I (544/5 or 546/7 CE; Chapter 4, PL 1.18:2) was also recovered from the destruction debris. Photo 1.57.

Room (Locus 15028 upper) This room belongs to the level that was half a story higher than the other rooms on the ground floor. Access to the room was via the stairs that ran along the eastern wall of the central courtyard (15008). The room was rectangular and measured 3.10x4.80 m. W. 1599, 1533, 1532 and 1514 delineated the room on the north, east, south and west respectively. The walls were 85 cm wide and built from medium- sized and large square and rectangular stones with numerous small and medium-sized fieldstones between them. The walls were plastered and were mostly destroyed. Four courses of the room's western wall were preserved to a height of 1.10 m. The entrance into the room was in the southern part of the western wall. The doorway was 90 cm wide on the inside and 80 cm on the outside. The upper part of the doorway was not preserved. The narrow part of the threshold was 4 cm higher than its wider part. The floor of the room was completely destroyed. Thus, we assume that some of the finds recovered from Room 15028 lower originally belonged to Room 15028 upper and fell down to it when the building was destroyed. THE BASEMENT 1.18. Staircase (Locus 15031) The staircase was aligned east to west and led from the ground floor down to the basement level (Photo 1.58). The room was rectangular, measuring 1.50x4.30 m, and was delineated by W. 1514, 1510, 1533 and 1599 on the west, north, east and south respectively. Eight courses of the walls were preserved to a height of 2.35 m. They were built from medium-sized and large square and rectangular stones with small fieldstones between them. The walls were not plastered. The entrance to the staircase was in the western wall. The doorway was 1.10 m at the widest point, 90 cm at the narrowest point and 1.65 m high. The threshold in the narrow part of the doorway was only a few centimeters higher than the floor of the central courtyard (15008), whereas the widest part of the threshold was about 10 cm lower than the courtyard floor. The lintel above the doorway consisted of a single stone measuring 0.35x0.40x 1 .36 m. From the threshold one descended 14 cm to the top step, which at 97 cm was also the widest step. The other five steps were 40 cm wide by 24 cm high. The staircase floor was especially well built of neatly dressed, rectangular stone slabs, which were carefully fitted into place. The landing at the bottom of the stairs was rectangular and measured 1.55x1.25 m. From the landing a doorway in the eastern end of the northern wall led into Room 1 5032. In the center of the eastern wall, about 70 cm above the floor, was a plastered rectangular niche, 0.52x1.05 m, whose upper portion was not preserved. At the eastern end of the southern wall was a doorway leading into Room 15028 lower. The doorway was completely preserved. From the field photographs taken at the time of the excavation, one can discern a cross and Greek inscription painted in red on the lintel (see Chapter 6). Even at that time the cross and inscription were quite faded, and today they are no longer visible in the field. However, red painted crosses, albeit faded, are still visible today on the walls of the structure located east of the large Byzantine structure in Area XV. Pottery (Chapter 2) An intact small flared bowl (Pl. 1. 14: 1) was found in the locus. 51</page><page sequence="58">CHAPTER ONE Photo 1.58. General view of the structure with Staircase 15031 in the center, looking west. Other finds A bronze coin possibly dating from the reign of Heraclius (?) (610-641 CE; Chapter 4, PL 1.18:8) was found 3.50 m above the highest step; it therefore belongs to the destruction of the upper story. 1.19. Room (Locus 15028 lower) The room was located in the basement level of the building. It was rectangular, measuring 3.30x4.70 m, and was delineated by W. 1599, 1533, 1532 and 15 14 on the north, east, south and west respectively. The walls were plastered and preserved to their original height of seven courses (2.25 m). The walls were built from medium-sized and large roughly dressed stones with smaller fieldstones between them. The only entrance into the room was at the eastern end of the northern wall. The entrance was 80 cm wide on the outside and 1 .00 m on the inside. All six courses of the doorway were preserved to a height of 1.75 m. The lintel consisted of a single stone, which was adorned with a red painted cross and Greek inscription (Photo 1.59; see also Chapter 6, PL 1.19:3), like that in Locus 15031. The narrow part of the threshold was flush with the landing at the foot of the staircase (15031), while its wider part was 6 cm below the level of the landing and 28 cm above the floor of the room. A rectangular arch- bearing pilaster, 50x60 cm, abutted the center of the northern wall; five of its courses were preserved to a height of 1 .06 m. A plastered window, the upper part of which was missing, was situated in the middle of the eastern wall, 90 cm above the floor level. The window was 1.10 m wide on the inside of the room and tapered to 80 cm wide towards the outside of the Photo 1.59. The lintel of the entrance to Room 15028 (lower) decorated with a red painted cross and Greek inscription, looking south. 52</page><page sequence="59">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY OF AREAS XV AND XVII wall. The windowsill was about 29 cm deep and sloped down towards the room. In the center of the southern wall was a pilaster, opposite the northern pilaster, measuring 40x60 cm and preserved to its original height of five courses (1.60 m). A ceramic pipe ran down the entire height of the room's north- western corner. The floor of the room (716.65 m) was paved with square and rectangular stone slabs averaging 35x50 cm in size. The entire western part of the room was occupied by a plastered installation whose function is unclear. The walls of the room formed three of the installation's sides. W. 1587, which was plastered on both sides, was erected to the east, between the two arch-bearing pilasters. The wall was 2.25 m long, 84 cm high and 25 cm wide. The floor of the installation (716.83 m) was of tamped earth. Pottery A small selection of pottery sherds from this locus has reached us. Among them are a complete candlestick lamp decorated with a cross (Photo 1.60) and a fragment of a lamp handle decorated with a human face (Chapter 3, PL 1.17:15). Photo 1.60. Candlestick lamp (Locus 15028, Reg. No. 589; scale 1:1). Other finds A square ceramic tile, 24x24 cmx2 cm wide and identical to the tiles recovered from the adjacent room to the north (15032), was found in the locus. Two bronze coins were found (Chapter 4), one from the reign of Honorius (408-421 CE) and the other, the latest coin found in the structure, from the reign of Constans II (657/8 CE). 1.20. Room (Locus 15032) The room was in the basement level of the building. It was rectangular, 4.40x4.20 m, and was delineated byW.1510, 1586, 1585 and 1533 on the south, west, north and east respectively. The walls were built from roughly dressed medium-sized and large square and rectangular stones. Numerous small fieldstones filled the spaces between the larger stones. The walls of the room were plastered and were preserved to their original height of eight courses (2.30 m). The northern and western walls, built in line with the hewn bedrock, were 1.00 m wide and thicker than the other two walls. There was a 9 cm wide protrusion in the eastern wall, whose purpose is unclear, 42 cm below the window. The entrance to the room was at the eastern end of the southern wall. The doorway was 91 cm wide on the outside and 1 .08 m wide on the inside of the room. Six courses of the doorway were preserved to a height of 1.87 m. The lintel was not preserved. The threshold in the narrow part of the doorway was flush with the lower landing of Staircase 1 503 1 . The wider part of the threshold consisted of two levels: the southern and northern levels were 4 cm and 1 8 cm lower than the narrow part of the threshold respectively. The northern level of the wider part of the threshold was 27 cm higher than the floor of the room. A rectangular pilaster, 65x60 cm, abutting the center of the southern wall, was preserved to a height of seven courses (1.86 m). In the southern part of the western wall, the wall was hewn in the bedrock to a height of 1.09 m above the floor and stone-built above. A window measuring 36x69 cm was built 60 cm above the floor in the northern part of the western wall. This window connected the room to an alcove, hewn in the bedrock, in Room 15022 (see below). In the western part of the northern wall was a passageway leading into Room 15022. Its ceiling was hewn in the natural bedrock, which is visible in the upper portions of the passageway on both sides as well as along the base of the northwestern corner of the room. A pilaster, 60 cm wide, abuts the center of the northern wall of Room 15032. Its western face was 1.45 m long and its eastern face 78 cm long. 53</page><page sequence="60">CHAPTER ONE In the middle of the eastern wall were two plastered windows, 78 cm apart and about 1.50 m above the floor, whose upper portions were not preserved. The windows narrowed towards the outside of the wall; the northern window was 70 cm wide on the inside of the room and 40 cm wide on the outside. Holes for an iron grill that was not preserved were drilled into the sides of the stone window frame (Photo 1.61). The southern window was 60 cm wide on the inside of the room and 55 cm on the outside. The northern windowsill was 30 cm deep and sloped down towards the room. The southern windowsill was 20 cm deep and sloped similarly. Photo 1.61. View from above of the holes drilled in the window frame for a window grill in Room 15032. The upper part of the window was not preserved. The floor of the room (716.59 m) was made from tamped earth. The finds from above the floor included debris that fell into the room with the collapse of the floor of Room 15025 above. Around installation that was plastered on the inside was built into the southwestern corner of the room. The instal- lation's southern wall, W. 1580, was 15 cm wide and was built along the room's southern wall, reaching the bedrock at the base of the western wall. A curved wall, W. 1584, built from roughly dressed medium- sized stones, extended from the pilaster in the southern wall to the middle of the western wall. Three courses of this wall were preserved to its full height of 61 cm. Pottery Very few pottery sherds from this locus have reached us. Small, deep, thin- walled bowls similar to those found elsewhere in the building (e.g. Storeroom 15006; Chapter 2, PI. 1.16:1) are noteworthy. Other finds Two complete ceramic tiles and a fragment of a third were found in the room. They are identical to the tiles in the floor of Room 15025. The tiles are square and measure 24x24 cm&gt;&lt;2 cm thick. About 30 iron nails of various sizes, similar to nails found elsewhere in the building, were found in the locus, as well as two doorknocker rings with nail connectors. 1.21. Room (Locus 15022) A passageway led from Room 15032 into Room 15022 (Photos 1.62-65). The western part of the room conforms with the shape of the bedrock, in which marks from earlier chiseling are discernible, and includes two openings to a niche and an alcove in the bedrock. The eastern part of the room was apparently blocked off by W. 1583, which was built between two pilasters situated in the middle of the room's northern and southern walls. W. 1583 was not completely preserved for its entire length. To its east are massive remains of early (Herodian?) construction, including W. 1533. We suggest that the eastern part of the room was not in use during the Byzantine period and that W. 1 583 was built in order to close off these remains, functioning as the eastern wall of the room. The room was entered by a passageway at the western end of the southern wall. The doorway was 80 cm wide and preserved to a height of 1 .83 m. The ceiling hewn from the bedrock comprised the lintel. The threshold was apparently built from stones, of which only one rectangular slab remained in situ. The blocked-off eastern portion of the room was rectangular, measuring 1.90x3.10 m, and was delineated by W. 1583, 1582, 1533 and 1585 on the west, north, east and south respectively. The northern wall predates the Byzantine construction. Only its core was visible, since its southern face was not preserved and it was supported by a retaining wall on the north. It apparently served as the foundation on which the second story in the building's northeastern corner was constructed. The eastern wall was probably also a remnant of an earlier monumental structure, incorporated into the outer, eastern wall of the Byzantine structure. A plastered, rectangular window, which was completely preserved, was cut into the center of the 54</page><page sequence="61">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY OF AREAS XV AND XVII eastern wall. Its inner dimensions were 1 . 1 Ox 1 .00 m and outer dimensions 77x60 cm. Holes were drilled in the stone on both sides of the window for anchoring a grill, probably made of iron, which was not preserved. The western wall, W. 1583, was 40 cm wider than the two pilasters located at either end, which were probably built to support the corre- sponding pilasters in the room in the story above (15019). The pilasters were rectangular, measuring 60x40 cm, and were built from finely dressed rectangular stones fitted closely together. The southern wall was mostly hewn from the bedrock, in line with the part of the wall that was completed with stone construction. The floor of the room (7 1 5.79 m) was of tamped earth. A rectangular alcove, 2.50x1.50 m, was hewn into the southern part of the western wall. The alcove's northern and western walls were hewn from the bedrock, whereas the walls on its southern and eastern sides were built from stone. Its ceiling sloped down towards the walls. The entrance, 85 cm wide by 1 .45 m high, was located at the northern end of the alcove's eastern wall. The eastern wall of the alcove was in fact the northwestern corner of Room 15032. A rectangular stone-constructed window, which opened onto Room 15032, was located in the southern end of the wall. The southern wall of the alcove was built from small and medium-sized stones using a large amount of mortar. A small niche for a lamp was hewn in the northern wall. The floor of the alcove (717.80 m) was made from tamped earth. A Second Temple period ossuary containing the broken skull of an adult was found inside the alcove. In the Byzantine period it was probably used as a reliquary (see Chapter 8). A niche, divided into two sections, was hewn into the northern part of the western wall of Room 15022. The L-shaped southern part was hewn entirely from the bedrock. It measured 0.95x2.55 m from east to west and 0.85x1.45 m from south to north. The eastern side of the niche was open; the wall that separated this niche from the alcove was hewn only at its eastern end, where it was 60 cm wide. The bedrock widened to 1 .40 m in the western Photo 1.62. Room 15019 and below it Room 15022 in the basement level, looking northwest. 55</page><page sequence="62">CHAPTER ONE Photo 1.63. An ossuary of the Second Temple period, apparently in secondary use as a reliquary, as found in situ in Room 15022. Photo 1.64. A window in Room 15022, looking west. continuation of the wall. The eastern part of the northern wall of the northern niche was actually the original southern wall of the burial (?) cave with benches (Locus 15099) located north of Room 15022. The floor of the niche (717.26 m) was made from tamped earth. A bench, 60 cm wide and 50 cm high, was hewn along the niche's entire western wall and also bordered part of the northern wall. The northern part of the niche was originally a niche that formed the southern part of Locus 15099. This is quite obvious from the hewing marks made in order to straighten the ceiling. The niche was rectangular and measured 1.00x1.50 m. Its eastern side was left completely open. To the south, this part of the niche was separated from its southern counterpart by a wall, 1.85 m long by 40 cm wide, which was hewn from the bedrock. The western end of this partition wall does not abut the western wall of the niche. The wall on the northern side of the niche separated the niche from Locus 15099. That wall was 2.10 m long and was actually a section of the northern wall of Room 15022. In the middle of the northern wall of Room 15022, opposite the room's southern doorway, was a passageway that led into Locus 15099. We assume that the door to the burial chamber was attached to a hinge installed in a hole that was hewn in the ceiling. Very few finds were recovered from the room; some of them were probably the contents of Room 15019, most of whose floor collapsed into Room 15022. Photo 1.65. Holes drilled for a window grill in the window frame in Room 15022, looking northwest. 56</page><page sequence="63">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY OF AREAS XV AND XVII Pottery Of the few pottery sherds from the room, there is a small Red Ware bowl stamped with a cross (Chapter 2, PL 1.14:12) and a complete ovoid lamp with a large filling hole (Chapter 3, PL 1.17:1). Also found were the rim of an Early Roman jar and fragments of two large burnished bowls of the Iron Age II. Other finds The following finds were recovered from the locus: a stone spindle whorl 4.5 cm in diameter and 8 cm thick, two fragments of a large fiat stone bowl 50 cm in diameter with a straight rim 8.5 cm wide, a fragment of a limestone flan mold (see Chapter 5) and a bronze coin dating from the mid-sixth to early seventh centuries CE (Chapter 4). UNDERGROUND INSTALLATIONS 1.22. Cistern (Locus 15017) A cistern was located beneath the entire area of Storeroom 15006. There was apparently an earlier opening to the cistern, which was sealed. The cistern's opening was at the base of W. 1508 in Anteroom 15012, to the right of the entrance that led into Storeroom 15006. The cistern was 5.10 m in diameter and its opening was 35 cm in diameter. Pottery The earliest pottery sherds found in the cistern date from the Early Roman period and consisted primarily of jar fragments. The latest sherds are from the fifth and sixth centuries CE; they include a complete jug decorated with incised diagonal lines (Chapter 2, PL 1.16:29) and fragments of two small candlestick lamps, one decorated with a cross (Photo 1.66) and the other with an amphora (Chapter 3, PL 1.17:4). Other finds A large fragment of a white marble chancel screen 2.5 cm thick was found in the cistern (Chapter 10, Pl. 1.22:1). It was smooth and finely dressed with a delicate relief on it depicting the lower forequarters of a hart. Other items found in the locus include a fragment of a marble capital with a cross (Photo 1.67), a section of ceramic pipe 23 cm long (Photo 1.68), pieces of iron nails including a whole nail 14 cm long and two bronze coins (Chapter 4), one dating from the rule of the procurator Nero Festus in the year 59 CE (Pl. 1.18:6) and the other from the fourth or fifth century CE.

Pit beneath the floor (Locus 15027) Beneath the floor level in Kitchen 15011 was a pit hewn in the bedrock, which was sealed up when construction of the room commenced. This pit was part of the natural cave that extended under the entire eastern side of the building. Five steps hewn 57</page><page sequence="64">CHAPTER ONE in the bedrock led down into the pit from east to west. The highest step exposed in the excavation (elevation 717.58 m) was probably not the uppermost step. The opening, located in the northern part of the pit's eastern wall, was 1 .02 m high. The eastern wall of the pit was hewn diagonally towards the east for 60 cm. The southern and western walls were 90 cm and 1.00 m long respectively. The northern wall of the pit was hewn to a distance of 1 .20 m and continued an additional 85 cm to the east beyond the limits of the pit. The maximum height of the wall was 2.20 m, the top of which was just 10 cm below the level of the floor in Kitchen 15011. The corners of the pit were curved and its floor was hewn to two levels: the upper level 40 cm below the lowest step and the lower level 58 cm below that. The maximum depth of the pit was 2.41 m. Pottery One rouletted bowl (Photo 1.69) and two complete Beit Nattif lamps (Chapter 3, PL 1.17:2-3) were among the pottery recovered from the locus. All of the pottery dates from the Early Byzantine period. Photo 1.69. Rouletted bowl (Locus 15027, Reg. No. 121-0; scale 3:5). Other finds A fragment of a Corinthian capital (Photo 1.70) was found in the pit, as was a bronze coin of Year Two of the Jewish Revolt (67/68 CE; see Chapter 4). 1.24. Cistern (Locus 15010) The opening of a cistern was located in the north- western corner of Courtyard 15005. The cistern was 3.00 m in diameter and extended beneath the Photo 1.70. Fragment of a Corinthian capital (Locus 15027, Reg. No. 15027/01; scale 1:1). courtyard and its northern and western walls. The hewn opening was in the center of the cistern's ceiling; next to it stood a large hewn column, the lower part of which was round and the upper part square in section. The column was aligned with the arch-bearing pilaster at the western end of the northern wall of Courtyard 15005. Pottery A complete large candlestick lamp (Chapter 3, Pl. 1.17:8) was found in the cistern. 1.25. Cistern (Locus 15016) This locus consisted of the northern portion of a cistern that extended from beneath the floor of Courtyard 15005 to the base of W. 1506 (Photo 1.7 1). The excavators' notes state that the excavation of the cistern was halted at a depth of one meter since further digging was likely to cause the collapse of the courtyard floor that was built over it. THE SHOPS 1.26. Southern courtyard/shop (Locus 15026) This locus consisted of a rectangular room, 4.30x4.45 m, located in the center of a row of rooms abutting the southern part of the building. The entrances to the rooms faced south towards the street during the latest phase of the structure (Photos 1.72-75). W. 1594, 1593, 1532 and 1592 delineated the room on the south, west, north and east respec- tively. Six courses of the walls, which were 70 cm thick, were preserved to a height of 2.56 m. The eastern and western walls were built from large, finely dressed rectangular stone slabs that were 58</page><page sequence="65">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY OF AREAS XV AND XVII Photo 1.71 . The filled-in cistern beneath the paving of the northern courtyard (15005), looking north. smoothed and closely fitted together. In the earlier phase there was no southern wall and the room functioned as an open entrance courtyard in the facade of the building. The well-built walls of the courtyard were apparently not plastered. We assume that the floor of the courtyard was surfaced with paving stones similar to those used in the northern entrance courtyard (15005) of the building. Access into the building via Courtyard 15026 was blocked during the later phase, when the southern wall was built and converted the courtyard into a room. The southern wall was attached to the walls of the adjacent rooms, though their southern facades were not constructed along the same axis. At that point, the room was completely separated from the building, its walls were plastered and its only doorway, in the middle of the southern wall, faced the street. The doorway was 1.00 m wide on the outside and 1 .20 m on the inside. The narrow part of the threshold was 30 cm higher than the floor. Four courses of the doorway were preserved to a height of 1.37 m. Immediately to the east of the doorway was a rectangular pilaster, 40x60 cm, which supported an arch and was preserved to a height of five courses. A plastered, rectangular niche measuring 33x53 cm was built into the wall between the pilaster and the room's eastern wall, 1.50 m above the floor. The top of the niche was not preserved. A Photo 1.72. Two of the shops at the front of the structure (Loci 15063 and 15026) during the last phase of its existence, looking south.

A second arch-bearing pilaster abutted the eastern part of the northern wall. The pilaster was rectangular, measuring 34x59 cm, and was preserved to a height of 1.35 m. A rectangular opening, 15x47 cm, was located in the fourth course of the wall between the pilaster and the room's eastern wall. This opening apparently functioned as a drain for the fill behind the wall, as seen in other walls of the structure (e.g. W. 1506). A well-built doorway in the middle of the eastern wall originally led into Room 15061. This doorway was sealed up during the building's later phase. The floor (716.00 m) was made from tamped earth. Numerous broken roof tiles were found in the collapse debris in the room. Pottery The base of a Red Ware bowl stamped with a cross (Chapter 2, PI. 1.15:1) was found in the locus. Other finds Finds from the room included an architectural fragment decorated with a guilloche (PL 1.10:4), a small marble column with a capital (PL 1.10:1), a similar limestone capital for a small column (PL 1.10:3), a limestone capital decorated with a cross for a large column (PL 1.10:2) and two fragments of marble chancel screens (PL 1.10:5), one of which is decorated with a hart (Chapter 10, PL 1.22:2). Fragments of four convex roof tiles stamped on their edges were found: one with a circle, one with two Photo 1.74. The northwestern corner of Shop 15026.

Rectangular room/shop (Locus 15061) This locus was a rectangular room, 3.90x6.50 m, delineated by W. 1591, 1592, 1532 and 1590 on the south, west, north and east respectively (Photo 1.76). The walls of the room were plastered. Ten of the wall's courses were preserved to a height of 3.26 m. The walls were built from medium-sized and large square and rectangular stones with numerous small fieldstones filling the spaces. The walls were about 80 cm thick. The original entrance into the room from Courtyard 15026, which was completely preserved, was located in the middle of the western wall. The doorway was 80 cm wide at its narrowest point and 95 cm at its widest. One descended 5 cm from the narrow part of the threshold in the west to the wider part, and from there an additional 40 cm to the floor of the room (715.60 m). In the building's later phase, the entrance was blocked and access to the room was now through a narrow doorway in the southern wall fronting the street. Two rectangular arch-bearing pilasters, 35x60 cm, stood 1 .70 m apart abutting the northern wall of the room. The western arch was preserved in its entirety. During the building's later phase the western part of the northern wall was reinforced, apparently after damage to that portion of the wall. The eastern wall constituted the continuation of the outer, eastern wall of the building with a slight deviation towards the west. Along the southern wall, two pilasters correspond with the arch-bearing pilasters on the northern wall. The pilasters were plastered together with the walls. The narrow doorway of the later phase, in the western corner of the southern wall, faced the street. The doorway was 55 cm wide at its narrowest point and 70 cm at its broadest. We assume that some of the finds related by the excavators to this locus actually originated from the upper rooms. Pottery (Chapter 2) Noteworthy among the pottery sherds found are two Red Ware bowls, one stamped with a cross (PL 1.15:2) and the other stamped with an amphora (PL 1.15:3). Other finds On the floor of the room were found a fragment of a marble altar table (PL 1.11:1) and marble chancel screen fragments bearing depictions of a hart (PL 1.22:3) and a column (PL 1.11:6, 10); see Chapter 10.

Shop (Locus 15063) This room was square, measuring 3.30x3.30 m, and was located along the southern facade of the building. Other than the fact that it abuts W. 1532, there was no direct connection with the rest of the building in either phase. W. 1589, 1588, 1532 and 1 593, on the south, west, north and east respectively, delineated the room. The walls were about 80 cm thick and were built from finely dressed medium- sized to large rectangular stones closely fitted together. The high-quality construction of the walls was also apparent on their outer faces. Seven courses of the walls were preserved to a height of 2.61 m. The walls were probably plastered in a later phase, like the walls in the adjacent courtyard/shop (15026). The room had a single entrance in the center of the southern wall (1589) facing the street. The entrance was 85 cm in its narrower part and 95 cm in its wider part. The narrow part of the threshold was 4 cm higher than the wider part. Four courses of Photo 1.77.

CONCLUSIONS The large Byzantine structure in Area XV was generally preserved to the top of its ground floor, and in several places to the lower part of its second floor. The good state of preservation enables us to date the different phases of the building. The monumental Umayyad construction that covers the area to the south and west of the Byzantine structure did not encroach on the structure; it was therefore well preserved, without any signs of Umayyad disturbance or intrusion. After the destruction of the Byzantine structure, most likely by the Persians in 614 CE, the building was not repaired and remained covered by its own collapse until it was exposed in the excavation. Because of the structure's excellent state of preservation, the excavators decided not to continue digging beneath its floors in order to present it to the public in its entirety. This prevented any further investigation or evaluation of the earlier architec- tural remains below it. The earliest finds from the excavation in the building are a number of sherds dating from the Iron Age II, including the fragment of a handle with a LMLK stamp and the head of a fertility figurine (Mazar and Mazar 1989: 139, No. 158; 125, No. 269k). The Iron Age pottery appeared only below the level of the ground floor. Since the level beneath most of the floors remained unexcavated, it is difficult to determine the date of construction of the Byzantine building. The floor of only one room (15011) was excavated. Beneath the tamped earth floor was a pit hewn into the bedrock (15027), which contained two Beit Nattif lamps dating from the third-fourth centuries CE (Rosenthal and Sivan 1978: 99). These finds ftpm the pit allow us to establish a terminus post quern of the fourth century CE for the construction. The original plan of the structure consists of a central courtyard with rooms and smaller courtyards around it. The dimensions of the structure, which seem too large for a private house, suggest that it was a public building. Several objects of ecclesias- tical nature attest that the building included a chapel within its boundaries. These finds include a reliquary found in situ in the basement of the structure (Locus 15022), fragments of marble chancel screen panels (Loci 15017, 15021, 15061), an altar table (Locus 15025), a large copper alloy cross (Locus 15005) and many crosses that adorned the capitals, walls, doorknockers, a copper alloy lamp, etc. Since the ground floor of the structure yielded no architectural evidence for the existence of a chapel, we suggest that it was located in the second story, which was not preserved. Because of the collapse of the second story, the contents of the chapel were found in the debris that filled the ground floor rooms. An entrance leading from the street north of the building into the second story may have enabled direct access to the chapel without passing through the rest of the building. The presence of a chapel inside a public building strongly implies that the large Byzantine structure in Area XV functioned as a monastery (Fig. 1.7). The structure extends over an area of 17.90x18.50 m., a small area in comparison to the cenobitic monasteries known so far in the vicinity of Jerusalem and the Judean Desert. The largest monastery is that of Theodosius, measuring 100x70 m, while the smallest is Khirbet el-Qasr, measuring 13.70x11.40 m. However, monasteries within the boundaries of a city, where space was scarce, would naturally be smaller. These monasteries usually had more than one story; in most cases the chapel was located on the ground floor, north of the central courtyard with the apse facing east (Hirschfeld 1992: 42^19). The proposed location of the chapel on the second floor of the monastery in Area XV probably stemmed from the fact that the monastery was built on remains of a Herodian structure; these remains were massive enough to influence the archi- tectural plan of the Byzantine structure. Another factor that may have favored the location of the chapel on the second floor was the fact that the monastery was located in a densely built-up quarter of the city, where space would have been scarce. In the monastery of Khirbet el-Kilya in the northern Judean Desert the chapel was built on the second floor. Here too, the architectural plan of the monastery was influenced by that of an earlier structure from the Roman period (Magen 1990: 331). The large Byzantine structure in Area XV is 65</page><page sequence="72">CHAPTER ONE Fig. I.7Ä£ Suggested reconstruction of the monastery (drawing by Stas Stark). located near the foot of the southeastern corner of the Temple Mount compound. In his book, "The Topography of the Holy Land," the pilgrim Theodosius, who visited Jerusalem in the early sixth century CE, describes a closed monastery of reclusive virgins (the "Enclosed Convent") in this area: "Down below the Pinnacle of the Temple is a monastery of virgins, and whenever one of them passes from this life, she is buried there inside the monastery. All their lives they never go out of the door by which they entered this place. The door is opened only for a nun or penitent who wishes to join the monastery, but otherwise the virgins are always shut in. Their food is let down to them from the walls, but they have their water there in cisterns" (Wilkinson 1977: 66, No. 11). From the shape of the burial (?) cave (Locus 15099) and its location at the rear of the basement, we presume that it was used as a burial chamber for the nuns of the monastery. In his description of the monastery, Theodosius recounts that when one of the nuns passed away she was buried inside the monastery. No finds were recovered from this room, nor were any burials found here; they were probably removed from the chamber following the destruction of the monastery. In his translation of the same paragraph, Bernard (1893: 12) refers to six hundred nuns 66</page><page sequence="73">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY OF AREAS XV AND XVII residing in the monastery. This number is based on Bernard's proposal to read "dc" (=600) instead of "de" in "monosterium de castis" in the manuscript. The identification of the building with the "Enclosed Convent" was first proposed by Y. Hirschfeld after he saw the results of our work. Another location for the convent was put forward by Y. Tsafrir with reference to Theodosius' description: "Paragraph 11 tells about the enclosed convent of virgins below the pinnacle" (Tsafrir 1986: 133). Tsafrir further writes: "It is possible that the Enclosed Convent of Virgins was built on the slope below the Temple Mount and has not yet been discovered. However, it is also possible that it was to be found in the hollows of the Temple Mount itself, the Herodian vaults, which are known today after a period of Crusader building as 'Solomon's Stables'" (Tsafrir 1986: 133, n. 11). However, Tsafrir 's latter suggestion relies only on the existence of the large cavities below the south- eastern corner of the Temple Mount compound, where nothing was discovered to indicate the presence of a monastery. As shown above, there is clear evidence for major architectural changes in the structure. It seems that these changes, such as the sealing of entrances and construction of walls, were carried out at the same time as part of an overall change of the structure's plan. We therefore suggest that the structure had two phases of use (Plan 1.5): in the first phase the entire building was used as a monastery and in the second phase the building was divided into three separate units. The southern part, which in the first phase comprised two rooms and a courtyard, was converted into a row of three shops, detached from the rest of the structure. The northern part was also separated from the main unit; according to the finds found in it, including an oven in one of its rooms, we suggest that this unit served as a public kitchen. The main part of the structure continued to function as a monastery, but on a smaller scale. The public kitchen included two rooms with cooking ovens, two storerooms and two paved courtyards, an outer one and inner one, each with a cistern below. These cisterns provided the monastery, in its first phase, with an independent water supply. During the second phase the monastery remained without a cistern. Although the doorways in W. 1510 were sealed, two windows were left open that enabled the transfer of water and food between the public kitchen and the monastery. The only access to the public kitchen was now via the entrance in the western wall of the northern courtyard (15005). The central unit, which continued in use as a monastery, included the central courtyard ( 1 5008), a single room to its west ( 1 5007), two rooms half a floor higher than the courtyard to its east and south and the basement level. In the room to the west of the courtyard (15007), which is closest to the public kitchen, a brazier and several ceramic bowls were found. The room had a paved floor and a built installation along its northern wall. We therefore suggest that food cooked in the public kitchen was heated up and prepared for serving in this room. The dining room was probably 15028 upper, half a floor above the courtyard, in which fragments of a mosaic floor were found. We assume that no changes were made to the plan of the second floor and that during the second phase it remained part of the monastery. The second phase of the building is dated by the fill beneath the courtyard's floor (Locus 15035). In this phase the stairs leading into the courtyard from the south were no longer in use after the blocking of the southern entrance, and the gap between the stairs and the courtyard floor was raised to the height of the central courtyard. The latest coin in the fill, from the reign of Justinian I (538-542 CE), provides a terminus post quern for these alterations. The alterations in the monastery's plan were probably a result of the increase in population density in the city, as the number of pilgrims flowing into it steadily increased. This was probably also the reason for the reinforcing of the Ophel Wall at about the same time (E. Mazar 1995: 48-63). The large number of finds discovered on the floor of the building enables us to fix the time of its latest use to the late sixth and early seventh centuries CE, namely to the end of the Byzantine period. The remains of destruction and conflagration in the rooms in the western part of the building imply that the building was destroyed during the Persian conquest and was not subsequently used. No finds postdating the Byzantine period were found in any of the rooms, apart from one coin from the reign of Constans II, dating from 657/8 CE, found in the building's destruction debris. We can only assume that this late coin somehow made its way into the ruins after the destruction. 67</page><page sequence="74">CHAPTER ONE 2. THE SMALL BYZANTINE STRUCTURE IN AREA XV (THE WINERY) A Byzantine structure (Locus 15002) was built above two or three of the vaulted chambers beneath the level of the Herodian street running along the southern wall of the Temple Mount enclosure (Plan 1.6, Photos 1.79-84). The walls of these vaulted chambers were hewn in the bedrock in their lower part. Herodian building materials were found in secondary use in the Byzantine structure, including a fragment of a large column, 75 cm in diameter, incorporated into the southern wall. A vaulted chamber with a plastered installation built into its southern wall were the only preserved remains of the Byzantine structure. The vaulted chamber was two meters south of the Temple Mount enclosure wall and six meters east of the Triple Gate. A narrow street to its south separated it from the large Byzantine structure. The Photo 1.79. The inside of the vaulted chamber (15002), looking east. Note the sloping floor and the depression in its eastern end. chamber was rectangular and measured 2.20x5.90 m and 2.50 m high. Its walls and ceiling were entirely covered with a thick coat of reddish plaster. The floor sloped down from west to east. In the center of the lower eastern side was a round depression, one meter in diameter. The vaulted roof was constructed from medium-sized stones hewn to fit one another. Two openings, 50x55 cm, were located in the center of the ceiling, 45 cm from the eastern and western ends of the chamber and 3.85 m apart. The openings were funnel-shaped, broadening towards the inside. The eastern opening was positioned above the round depression in the floor. A narrow channel was hewn along the vaulted roof towards the eastern opening. There was no entrance to the chamber other than the openings in the roof. The southern wall of the chamber also Photo 1.80. The small Byzantine structure between the southern wall of the Temple Mount and the Byzantine street (15023), looking east.

The total preserved length of the wall was 16.5 m. The installation built into the southern wall of the chamber was circular, 50 cm in diameter, and was preserved to a height of 65 cm. There was a drain opening in the upper part of the installation's southern side that faced the street. The function of the installation is unclear. From the structure that was built above the vaulted room, only the entrance threshold at the western end of its southern wall has survived. The threshold was at the same level as that of the street to the south of the structure and that of the threshold of the large Byzantine structure on the other side of the street. Thus, the vaulted chamber served as the cellar of a structure whose ground floor was completely destroyed. We assume that the structure extended right up to the southern wall of the Temple Mount enclosure. Photo 1.81. The roof of the vaulted chamber and the drainage channel leading to the eastern opening, looking west. Photo 1.82. The roof of the vaulted chamber, looking east. It was originally suggested that the plastered and vaulted chamber served as a water reservoir. However, two factors invalidate this suggestion. Firstly, the sloping floor and the depression at its lower end enabled the collection of the liquid from the chamber to the very last drop. There are no known examples of sloping floors with a collecting pool in cisterns, in which a floor like this would be unnecessary. Secondly, there is an abundance of very large cisterns hewn into the bedrock in the vicinity of the Temple Mount and the Ophel. No built cisterns were found in the entire excavation area; this is not surprising, since the hewn cisterns provided a sufficient supply of water for the needs of the residents of the area. We suggest that the vaulted chamber served as a collection vat for wine and that a winepress was positioned above it. It should be mentioned that no other example of a stone-built collection vat has been found. However, in contrast to this winery Photo 1.83. The western opening in the roof of the vaulted chamber, looking southwest. 70</page><page sequence="77">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY OF AREAS XV AND XVII located in a densely built-up quarter of the city, most collection vats known to us are located in open areas. In these cases it was possible to hew the winepress into the bedrock and there was no need for any construction, certainly not to a height of two stories. The total volume of the vaulted chamber was about 25 cubic meters, a very large capacity in comparison to most other collection vats (Frankel 1984: 254, 256, 301). The huge size of the collection vat can be explained if we assume that it served not only the residents of the area surrounding it but also the large numbers of pilgrims who visited Jerusalem. The winery, built in the southern part of the Temple Mount, was intended to meet an especially large demand for wine. It was constructed in a densely populated built-up quarter; hence, there was no choice but to build it in two stories in an area of very limited size. Though another built winery located inside a residential area has not yet been found, similar ones may have existed in large settlements during the Byzantine period. An example of this type of winery from the Roman period was found in Etruria in Italy (Carandini and Tatton-Brown 1980: 15). The close proximity between the winery and the monastery may indicate a relationship between them, since the presence of winepresses in the vicinity of monasteries is a common phenomenon Photo 1.84. The structure during the excavations, looking east. during the Byzantine period (Hirschfeld 1992: 106-109). Geographically, the closest example is the winepress discovered in the compound of the Dominus Flevit monastery on the Mount of Olives dating from the end of the Byzantine period (Bagatti 1956: 268-270). However, it is more likely that the winepress served the public kitchen during the second phase of the large Byzantine structure. 3. AREA XV: ADDITIONAL LOCI 3.1.

PL 1.12:1 is a complete bowl with a thickened rim, curved, flaring sides and low ring base.

Another find was an ossuary lid of the Second Temple period decorated with an incised pattern of two parallel lines running across the entire lid and circles inscribed with a compass between them (Chapter 8, Photo 1.124, Fig 1. 11). A hole was drilled through the lid, apparently to facilitate the pouring of holy oil into the ossuary while it was in secondary use as a reliquary. Fifteen iron nails of various sizes, similar to dozens of such nails from the large Byzantine structure, were found. A fragment of a mold-made figurine depicting the forequarters of a harnessed horse (PL 1.13:4) was also found; identical figurines dating from the sixth century CE were found in the Tyropoeon excavations (Crowfoot 1927: 77-78, 111.

There is one complete Byzantine bowl (Photo 1.91); a similar bowl was discovered in Locus 15068. Photo 1.9 1 . Complete Byzantine bowl (Locus 1 5023, Reg. No. 15030/01, IAANo. 1986-217; scale 2:3). Other finds A bronze coin of Year Three of the Jewish Revolt (68/69 CE) was found in the locus. 3.6. Fill between walls (Locus 15034) A fill between the southern wall of the Temple Mount enclosure to the north, the vaulted chamber (15002) to the south and W. 1577 and W. 1579 on the east and west respectively. Pottery A large number of jar rims from the Early Roman period were found. The rest of the sherds are from the Byzantine period and include a complete jug (Photo 1.92) with an everted rim and a very short neck that constitutes the continuation of the body. The body is ovoid and ribbed over its entire height. A loop handle extends from the rim to the body. The base is a disc base. The jug is decorated on its shoulder with incised diagonal lines. An identical jug was discovered in a cistern (15017) inside the large Byzantine structure and dates from the mid- sixth to early seventh centuries CE (Pl. 1.16:10). Other finds Three bronze coins were found in the locus, two of Year Two of the Jewish Revolt (67/68 CE) and one dating from 351-361 CE. 75</page><page sequence="82">CHAPTER ONE Photo 1.92.

Drainage channel (Locus 15036) The drainage channel extending from the large Byzantine structure under the Byzantine street (Locus 15023, Photo 1.86 above) was exposed for a distance of 8 m. The locus was excavated down to the bedrock. Finds Fragments of a wide ceramic pipe and five bronze coins were found in the locus. The earliest dates from the reign of Agrippas I. Of the other four, one is of the procurator Festus (59 CE), one of Year Two of the Jewish Revolt (67/68 CE) and two of Year Three of the revolt (68/69 CE). 3.8. Fill beneath the street (Locus 15038) The fill beneath the Byzantine street and above the early drainage channel 15048 (Photo 1.87 above). Channel 15048, running from east to west, was exposed for a distance of 5 m. We possess no finds from this locus. 3.9. Steps (Locus 15040) Steps leading down to the narrow street in Locus 15050. Pottery The shoulder of a jar with traces of a red painted inscription on it (Chapter 6, PL 1.19:7) was found in the locus. 3.10. Main street (Locus 15043) The eastern continuation of the main street that ran north of the large Byzantine structure (15023). This portion of the street was very poorly preserved. Since this eastern part of the street was higher than the western, pedestrians had to ascend a series of steps in order to reach its upper level. The eastern part of the street was wider than its western part (Locus 15023). Together both parts of the street ran parallel to the southern wall of the Temple Mount for the entire length of the two large Byzantine structures in Areas XV and XVII. We assume that it continued eastwards, in the direction of a city gate that we believe was located not far from the south- eastern corner of the Temple Mount but has not yet been exposed. Pottery A complete jug with a flared rim and short neck that tapers near the rim was discovered in this locus (Photo 1.93). It has a biconical, rounded body, a strap handle that extends from the rim to the shoulder and a concave base. A similar jug, decorated with combed horizontal bands, was discovered in Cistern 3111 in Area III (PL 111.5:6). Two jugs of this type dating from the sixth to seventh centuries CE were found in Stratum IIA at Ramat Rahel (Aharoni 1 964: 122, Fig. 23:9-10). This type of jug is defined by Magness as "FBW jugs lc," which she dates from the mid-sixth to eighth centuries CE (Magness 1 993 : 237-239). Photo 1.93. Jug (Locus 15043, Reg.

Introduction This large public structure (Plan 1.1, Photos 1.96-107) was contemporary with the large Byzantine building in Area XV to its west. Together they produced an architectural continuity extending along the entire length of the street (15043, 15023) that ran parallel to the eastern part of the southern wall of the Temple Mount enclosure. The structure was a two-story building that extended over Area XVII and the eastern part of Area XV. The main entrance to the structure was from the street that ran along the northern facade of the building (15043). The structure was almost square. Of its outer walls, the western wall is 14 m long, the northern wall is 25 m long and the eastern and southern walls are each 25 m long. The impression one receives from the plan is that of a public structure, though it lacks the central courtyard characteristic of public structures of the Byzantine period. The remains of earlier construction that probably stood in the area may have influenced the plan of the building. The ground floor consisted of about thirty well- preserved rooms. In several of the rooms there were openings to underground cisterns. Some rooms had white mosaic floors; in a number of places it was possible to identify simple colored patterns in the mosaic floors. Several of the rooms were paved with orange ceramic tiles. In the center of the structure, the natural bedrock was high and exposed. At the northwestern end of the structure the rooms (15064, 15047 and 15049) were built on bedrock at a high level, corresponding to that of the second-story rooms in the other parts of the building. Portions of the walls in some of the second-story rooms have remained in situ in the eastern part of the structure. Some of these rooms had mosaic floors and poorly preserved, simple drawings in red paint on the walls. Two small funnel-shaped windows located 1.50 m above the floor were preserved in the northern wall of one of the rooms in the northeastern part of the building. There were at least three entrances into the building. The main entrance was at the northern end of the eastern wall. From the entrance, one entered a Photo 1.96. The southeastern part of the structure, looking west. 78</page><page sequence="85">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY OF AREAS XV AND XVII Photo 1.97. The northwestern part of the structure during excavation, looking west. narrow corridor (1). Two plastered installations, apparently used for washing, ran along the entire southern wall. The inner, monumental entrance was at the end of the corridor. The doorway's lintel was preserved in situ and bore the remains of a red painted cross. There were protrusion resembling pilasters on either side of the lintel. From the entrance one descended wide steps to the entrance courtyard (2), from which one could turn east and enter a closed wing on the east of the building via a corridor consisting of three rooms (3-5), one of which (3) had an opening to an underground cistern. At the end of the corridor was a room (6) with three arches to support the ceiling. From the corridor one could also turn south into a wide room (7) in which were an opening to an underground cistern and various installations. In the northwestern corner of the entrance courtyard well-preserved steps led up to the second floor. From the entrance courtyard one could also reach the ground floor rooms on the south. All of the rooms were either small or Photo 1.98. The entrance from inside the building, looking east. 79</page><page sequence="86">CHAPTER ONE Photo 1.99. The entrance and entrance corridor (No. 1), looking west. Photo 1. 100. The monumental lintel of the entrance with the remains of a red painted cross, looking west. medium-sized. Arch-bearing pilasters were preserved in many of the rooms. One room (11) was hewn entirely into the bedrock; in its southern and western walls were rounded niches with shelves. The orientation of this room differs from that of the other rooms, and we assume that it predates the building and was incorporated into it. In one of the rooms (16), a red painted cross enclosed in a circle was preserved on the western wall next to the entrance. The building had at least two other entrances. One, at the northern end of the western wall, led directly to a room (15047) containing many installa- tions that perhaps required a separate entrance. Another entrance, in the middle of the western wall of Locus 15065, is clearly related to the open space at the front of the building (15067) and the plastered pool (15039) in the northwestern corner of this space. We suggest that this entrance was intended for guests arriving with donkeys, which were watered at the pool. From the excavators' notes it is clear that numerous roof tiles were found in some of Photo 1. 101. The entrance to the anteroom (No. 2). 80</page><page sequence="87">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY OF AREAS XV AND XVII Photo 1. 102. Arch-bearing pilasters in the northern wall of the anteroom (No. 2). the rooms; thus we can assume that the structure was at least partially covered with a tiled roof. We did not find any data in the excavators' notes pertaining to the excavation or contents of the structure, apart from a few finds from the rooms at Photo 1. 103. The courtyard at the rear of the corridor (No. 6) and the remains of the second-story walls above it. Photo 1. 104. A red painted cross in a circle on the western wall next to the entrance into Room 16. its western end that were excavated together with the adjacent large Byzantine structure in Area XV. Despite this, we have included here a general field plan of the structure that was prepared on the basis of the architectural remains visible in the area today. When referring to the plan, one should take into account the uncertainty of many of its details because of the reconstruction of the building. The reconstruction activities were carried out during the preparation of the site as an archaeological park on a massive scale and to considerable heights. In many cases an archaeological basis for the reconstruction was lacking, and there are no marks differentiating between the original structure and the reconstructed portions. Nevertheless, we have chosen to include Photo 1.105. The remains of two second-story rooms in the northeastern part of the structure. Two narrow windows are preserved in the middle of the northern wall in the western room. 81</page><page sequence="88">CHAPTER ONE Photo 1.106. The remains of the walls of the second-story rooms in the northeastern part of the structure, looking south. the plan in the publication of the Byzantine finds of the excavations to give an impression of the structure's position in the overall plan of the area in the Byzantine period. It should be noted that much remains to be excavated and researched in connection with this structure. In light of all the available data, and because of the proximity of the structure to the large Byzantine structure in Area XV identified as a monastery, we suggest that it served as a hospice, apparently in the service of the many pilgrims that visited Jerusalem during the Byzantine period. It is reasonable to assume that what we have identified as a public kitchen in the adjacent monastery also served the residents of the hospice. Structures which served as hospices for pilgrims during the Byzantine period sometimes also functioned as hospitals or public dwellings for the aged (Hirschfeld 1992: 199). Because our knowledge of the structure is only partial, we cannot determine its exact purpose with certainty. Photo 1. 1 07.

Plastered pool (Locus 15039) A plastered pool adjacent to the western wall of the large Byzantine structure (Photos 1.108-109).

Most of the vessels are attributed to the building's later phase, in which the original structure was divided into three separate units: 1) the main unit, which apparently continued to function as a monastery; 2) three shops facing the street along the southern facade; and 3) a kitchen complex on the north of the building, which in our opinion functioned as a public kitchen. The most comparable pottery assemblages come from excavations in the Tyropoeon Valley in Jerusalem (Crowfoot and Fitzgerald 1929), in the southern part of the Armenian Garden (Tushingham 1985), in the Monastery of Martyrius in Ma'ale Adummim (Magen 1993) and at Ramat Rahel (Aharoni 1964). Crowfoot's excavation area in the Tyropoeon Valley, south of the Dung Gate, is adjacent to the area of the Temple Mount excavations and actually constitutes a continuation of the settlement in the south of the city during the Byzantine period. In an extremely well-preserved Byzantine residential quarter exposed in Crowfoot's excavation, two strata were discerned. The earlier one dates from the mid-sixth century CE and the later stratum, which was damaged during the Persian conquest of 614 CE, was no longer occupied following the Arab conquest in 638 CE. J. Magness's book on Jerusalem's ceramic chronology from 200 to 800 CE (Magness 1993) greatly aided in providing up-to-date comparative material for the pottery assemblage from the monastery. The study by Hayes (1972) also served as a source of parallels for the imported pottery. * See Chapter 3 for the pottery lamps from Area XV. I. POTTERY FROM THE MONASTERY (PL. 1.14) 1. Small bowl with straight, flaring walls The upright rim of this bowl is folded and the base is flat (Pl. 1. 14: 1). The bowl was found in the staircase (Locus 15031) that leads down to the basement level. Bowls of this type are included by Magness among "FBW Bowls Form 2B", which comprises a variety of types. The bowls most similar to the example from Locus 15031 date from the sixth and seventh centuries CE (Magness 1993: 198-199). Many small bowls of this type appear in the Monastery of Martyrius, which dates from the end of the Byzantine period (Magen 1993: 40, 62). 2. Rouletted bowl A fragment of the rim of a bowl (Pl. 1. 14:2). The rim is inverted and folded. The walls are curved and treated with a rouletted decoration on the outside and a stamped herringbone pattern below the rim. The fragment was found in Room 15007. Small bowls of this type, without the stamped decoration, are classified by Magness as "Rouletted Bowls Form 2 A", which she dates to the sixth century CE (Magness 1993: 188-189). 3. Small, deep bowls These small bowls with plain, flared rims, straight walls that are slightly flared and flat bases (PL 1.14:3-4) were found in Room 15007 and Courtyard 15008. Magness defines these small bowls as lids or stoppers for jars. Based on parallels, she dates them to the sixth to mid-eighth centuries CE (Magness 1993: 247). Large numbers of these bowls were found in the kitchen complex (see below, Â§ III. 1). 4. Cup This cup has a plain rim, straight walls and slightly 86</page><page sequence="93">THE POTTERY ASSEMBLAGE FROM AREA XV concave base (PL 1.14:5). The single example was found in Courtyard 15008. Magness includes this form among the various types classified as "FBW Bowls Form IF" (Magness 1993: 194, 197). The closest parallel is a cup from Bethany dated to the second half of the sixth to seventh centuries CE (Sailer 1957: 53.3187). 5. "Bet Shean" jar This type of jar has a square rim, upright neck and two loop handles on the curved shoulder (Pl. 1. 14:6). A prominent ridge separates the shoulder from the elongated, sack-shaped body. The shoulder and body are ribbed and the base is curved. The body is decorated in patterns of diagonal parallel lines and spirals in white paint on the jar's dark gray clay. This was the only jar found in the main unit (in Courtyard 15008), in contrast to the large number of jars found in the kitchen complex. This type of jar does not appear in Magness 's ceramic corpus. A parallel was found in Crowfoot's excavations in the Tyropoeon (Crowfoot and Fitzgerald 1929: PL 14, Fig. 31). Its origin is apparently in Bet Shean, where it was found in large numbers. The "Bet Shean" jars were probably produced in order to contain the city's wines, which were renowned. These jars, which date from the early fifth to eighth centuries CE, constitute the most common type of jar in the Jezreel and Jordan Valleys (Landgraf 1980: 80). 6. Jugs Two body sherds of jugs with incised decoration were discovered in Room 15007. One fragment (PL 1.14:7) is decorated with incisions similar to those that characterize the FBW jugs, which date from the mid-sixth to early eighth centuries CE (Magness 1993: 237-239). The second sherd (Pl. 1.14:8) is decorated with an incised net pattern and concentric circles. No parallels were found for this decoration. 7. Imported pottery (Red Ware) One complete and three fragmentary Red Ware bowls were found in the main unit. The complete bowl (PL 1.14:9), from Room 15007, has a plain rim, straight, flared walls and a ring base. Two incised concentric circles surround the center of the interior. Bowls of this African Red Slip Ware type were made in North Africa in the early sixth century CE (Hayes 1972: 134, Fig. 24:88). A fragment of the base of a bowl (PL 1.14:10) was found in Room 15007. It is decorated on the inside with two incised concentric circles surrounded by a border of densely placed dots, which in turn is encircled by a rouletted decoration. This decoration characterizes African Red Slip Ware bowls manufactured in North Africa and dating from 430-500 CE (Hayes 1972: 130, Fig. 23:82-84). The second fragment is a bowl base found in Courtyard 15008 (PL 1.14:11). It is decorated with a stamped gazelle with its head turned back and a dotted body. This type of stamped decoration, including an identical parallel, appears on Late Roman C Ware bowls made in Asia Minor and dating from 470-580 CE (Hayes 1972: 358, Fig. 76:4 If). The third fragment is a bowl base found in Room 15022 (PL 1.14:12). This fragment is decorated with a stamped cross, with a quarter circle adorning each of the spaces between the arms and upright of the cross. This decoration appears on Late Roman C Ware bowls manufactured in Asia Minor and dating from around 500 CE (Hayes 1972: 364, Fig. 78:68j-l). II. POTTERY FROM THE SHOPS (PL. 1.15) Three shops stood along the entire southern facade of the structure in its later phase. Very few of the finds from these shops have reached us, but three fragments of bases of Red Ware bowls were found in Loci 15061 and 15026. Two of these (PL 1.15:1-2) are decorated with a stamped cross, similar to the one on a bowl discovered in Room 15022 in the monastery (see above, Â§ 1.7). On the top of the cross on the bowl fragment found in Locus 15061 (Pl. 1.15:2) is the stamped Greek letter P, which together with the cross forms a monogram of Christ (Hayes 1972: 364). The third sherd (PL 1.15:3) is decorated with a stamped amphora, the top of which resembles a lotus bud and whose base is triangular. Red Ware bowls decorated with stamped amphorae were manufactured in Asia Minor (Late Roman C Ware) and date from 440-580 CE (Hayes 1972: 364, Fig. 78:59a). III. POTTERY FROM THE PUBLIC KITCHEN (PL. 1.16) 1. Small, deep bowl One complete small bowl (PL 1.16:1) was found in Storeroom 15006; see above, Â§ 1.3. 87</page><page sequence="94">Pl. 1:14.

Bowl decorated in relief A fragment of a bowl made from dark gray clay and decorated in relief below its rim (PL 1.16:2) was discovered in Room 15019. The bowl has a slightly everted ledge rim, carinated wall and two mold- made human faces in relief decorating the wall below the rim. The contour of the faces is schematic and the hair is notched in bands, framing the face on both sides of the cheeks. Three bowls decorated with similar mold-made heads were discovered in Jerusalem and its vicinity. One was found at Giv'at Ram in Jerusalem and dates from the first to second centuries CE (Herschkovitz 1987: 318, Fig. 7) and the other two were found at Ramat Rahel, where they date from the Herodian period (Aharoni 1964: Pis. 10:20, 28:15). A similar bowl decorated with mold-made flowers rather than human heads was discovered in the Tyropoeon and dates from the sixth century CE (Crowfoot and Fitzgerald 1929: 125, PL 15:1). Unlike these examples, the bowl from Room 15019 is much more delicate and made from gray clay. The execution of the decorative relief is also finer and more precise. It seems to us that this bowl represents a more developed phase of the examples dating from the Roman period and it should be attributed to the Byzantine period. 3. Krater with ledge rim A large fragment of a krater (Pl. 1.16:3) was discovered in Courtyard 15005. The krater is deep and has a ledge rim and straight walls. A parallel was found in the City of David excavations and dated to the mid-sixth century CE (Magness 1993: Fig. 6:19). 4. Casserole and lid A casserole with a lid (PL 1.16:4) was discovered in Storeroom 15006. The rim of the casserole is tapered, conforming to the angle of the lid's rim. The walls of the vessel are straight and ribbed and there are two horizontal handles next to the rim. The lid has a slightly everted rim to fit the casserole. In the center of the lid is a lug handle perforated in order to enable the release of steam. This type of casserole is included among Magness's "Casseroles Form 1", characterized by its straight horizontal handles and dated to the early sixth century CE (Magness 1993: 211-212,215). 5. Bag-shaped jars This is one of the most common vessels found in the assemblages from the kitchen complex (PI. 1.16:5-21). The jar has a plain rim and a neck that is short and straight or narrows towards the top. At the base of the neck is a prominent ridge. The body is wide and ribbed. The ribbing is dense on the shoulder of the jar, stops below the handles and reappears less densely several centimeters below. There are two vertical loop handles on the shoulder. There are slight variations in the body shape and the location of the ribbing. Fourteen complete jars of this type come from the kitchen complex. Five were found in Courtyard 15005 (PL 1.16:5-9); four others were discovered in Storeroom 15006 (PI. 1.16:10-13) and four additional complete jars were found in the kitchen itself, Locus 15011 (PL 1.16:14-17). A variant of this jar, with a swollen mid-neck, was found in Room 15019 (PL 1.16:18). Two similar jars were found in Storeroom 15006 (PL 1.16:19-20). A variant with a wide neck was found in Kitchen 15011 (Pl. 1.16:21). The bag-shaped jar appears in Magness's corpus as "Storage Jar Form 5A" and is dated to the late sixth to early eighth centuries CE (Magness 1993: 226). 6. "Bet Shean" jars Two "Bet Shean" jars (Pl. 1. 16:22-23) were found in Kitchen 15011 (see above, Â§ 1.5). 7. Holemouth jars A large storage jar lacking a neck and with a stepped rim (Pl. 1.16:24) was found in Kitchen 15011. The body is wide, almost round and has a ring base. There are two loop handles on the shoulder and the walls are ribbed. This vessel is classified by Magness as "Holemouth Jar Form 2" and dated to the sixth to early eighth centuries CE (Magness 1993: 233-234). A unique vessel is a large storage jar with a very short, slightly flared neck (PL 1.16:25), also found in Locus 15011. Around the neck is a gutter 6 cm wide in which several equidistant holes, each 8 mm in diameter, are preserved. A total of 16 holes can be reconstructed. The gutter has a rim that extends above the vessel. Another unique feature of this vessel is its three vertical loop handles on the shoulder instead of the usual two, though it is no larger than an average- sized holemouth jar. The body is wide, almost spherical, and has a ring base. The vessel is decorated on the shoulder with two horizontal combed bands. A wavy band appears above the lower horizontal band. The general shape of this 90</page><page sequence="97">THE POTTERY ASSEMBLAGE FROM AREA XV vessel is similar to the aforementioned holemouth jar and it should probably be attributed to the same period. 8. "Gaza" jar An elongated, cylindrical jar (PL 1.16:26), of the type known as "Gaza" jars, was found in Courtyard 15005. The jar has a slightly inverted thickened rim, lacks a neck and has short, slightly sloping shoulders. The body is cylindrical, long and narrow. Two loop handles extend from the shoulder to the body. The jar is densely ribbed below the shoulder and is characterized by clay smeared on the rim and below it, probably the remains of the clay used to seal the vessels. These jars, which originated in the Gaza region, are most common in sites in the south of Israel and along the coast. They were used for storing wine and preserved fish and date from the fourth to early seventh centuries CE (Zemer 1977: 61). Such jars were discovered in Jerusalem in the excavations at the Armenian Garden (Tushingham 1985: 383, Fig. 31:1), in the Akeldama tombs (Ben- Arieh and Coen-Uzzielli 1996: 81, Fig. 4.7:7) and at Ramat Rahel (Aharoni 1964: Fig. 24:9). 9. Amphoriskos A complete amphoriskos with a slightly everted rim and a long, cylindrical neck (PL 1.16:27) was found in Room 15019. The body of the amphoriskos is round and tapers down toward a flat base. Two loop handles extend from the middle of the neck to the shoulder. Amphoriskoi of this type were found in the Monastery of Martyrius and dated to the end of the Byzantine period (Magen 1993: 23). 10. Short-necked jugs One complete jug was found in Courtyard 15005 (Pl. 1. 16:28). This vessel has a plain slightly everted rim and a very short neck that constitutes a continu- ation of the body. The body is an elongated ellipse with a concave base and a loop handle extending from the rim to the shoulder. This type of jug dates from the sixth-seventh centuries CE (see the discussion of Type 3 A jugs from Locus 3 1 1 1 in Area III). The second jug was found in Cistern 15017 (PL 1.16:29). The jug has a slightly everted rim and a very short neck that constitutes a continuation of the body. The ribbed body is an elongated ellipse in shape and has a disk base. The handle extends from the rim to the shoulder. The jug is decorated on the shoulder with incised diagonal stripes. This jug is an intermediate type between Magness's "FBW Jugs Form 2", characterized by a disk base, ribbed body and incised diagonal decoration on the shoulder, and her "FBW Jugs Form CI", which have an elongated body and a short, wide neck. The two types are contemporary and date from the mid-sixth to early eighth centuries CE (Magness 1993: 237-240). Similar jugs, though slightly narrower and lacking the incised decoration, were found in the Monastery of Martyrius, which was destroyed in 614 CE (Magen 1993: 40). 11. Strainer jug The upper half of a jug with a strainer at the base of its neck was found in Storeroom 1 5006 (Pl. 1. 16:30). The rim of the jug is missing. The neck flares outwards and the body is round, with a slight carination at the shoulder. The shoulder is decorated with a pattern of broad, horizontal painted stripes (colors not noted), with dotted and semicircular designs on the unpainted areas. This style of decoration is typical of the Byzantine pottery found in northern Egypt and Sinai. A jug with a similar shape and decoration was discovered at Kellia in the Nile Delta (Egloff 1977: Pis. 64:4, 62:11). 12. "Thermos jug" A complete "thermos jug" (PL 1.16:31) was found near the oven in Kitchen 15011. The jug has a slightly inverted rim with a prominent ridge below it. The neck is cylindrical and elongated, with a strainer in its base. The body of the vessel is round and there is a spout on the shoulder. A handle extends almost at right angles from the rim to the shoulder. The base of the jug is a high omphalos. The jug is attached to the top of a cylindrical stand with a high ring base. The walls and base of the stand are perforated with holes, 8 mm in diameter. There is a large square aperture in the wall of the stand below the jug's handle. The perforated stand was designed to hold heated coals to keep warm the contents of the jug. The coals were inserted into the stand via the large aperture, and the small holes provided oxygen to support combustion. Avessei of this type could be transported while its contents remained hot. We know of the use made of these vessels from references to them in the rabbinical sources (Zevulun 1985-86: 52). No parallels were found for this composite vessel, though the upper part is a typical Byzantine cooking jug (Zevulun 1985-86: 52). 91</page><page sequence="98">Pl. 1.16.

Juglets Juglets with ridged rims (Pl. 1. 16:32-36) were found in various loci (15006, 15011, 15012 and 15019) of the public kitchen. The juglets have an upright rim with a prominent ridge below it. The neck is narrow and slightly concave and the body is round with a thick disk base. The handle extends from the rim to the shoulder. In most cases the shoulder is decorated with incised diagonal lines. This type of juglet is especially common at sites in the vicinity of Jerusalem and is classified by Magness among "FBW Juglets Form 2 A", which she dates to the mid-sixth to early eighth centuries CE (Magness 1993: 240). A juglet with a high neck (Pl. 1. 16:37) was found in Kitchen 15011. The vessel has a plain rim and high, slightly flared neck. The body is cylindrical, elongated and ribbed. The handle extends from the rim to the shoulder and there is a thick disk base. The closest parallel to this vessel was found in the City of David and dates from the fourth-fifth centuries CE (Magness: 1993: 242, Fig. 1). Asimilarly shaped jug was found in the Tyropoeon excavations and was dated to the sixth century CE (Crowfoot and Fitzgerald 1929: 52-53, PL 13:10). A complete, small juglet was discovered in Room 15019 (PL 1.16:38). The rim is everted and folded. The neck is long and cylindrical, widening towards the bottom. A flat handle descends in a curve from the middle of the neck to the shoulder of the vessel. The body is triangular and forms a straight line with the tapered base. An identical juglet was found in the Tyropoeon excavations and dated to the sixth century CE (Crowfoot and Fitzgerald 1929: 52-53, PL 15:11). One juglet that is actually a cup was found in Storeroom 15006 (PL 1.16:39). It has a plain, slightly everted rim, lacks a neck and has a round body. A loop handle extends from the rim to the middle of the body and the base is flat. The juglet is treated with a brown slip; the lower half of the vessel is entirely covered and its upper half bears vertical smears of slip. Though no parallel was found for this type of decoration, juglets of this form dating from the end of the Byzantine period were found at Ramat Rahel (Aharoni 1964: 122, Fig. 23:8) and in the Tyropoeon excavations, where they were dated to the sixth century CE (Crowfoot and Fitzgerald 1929: 52-53, PL 15:16). 14. Flasks The upper part of a small flask was found in Anteroom 15012 (PL 1.16:40). The rim is plain and is a continuation of the cylindrical neck. The shoulder curves gently and two loop handles extend from the middle of the neck down to the shoulder. The shoulder is decorated with stamped flowers. A similar flask, though with a different decoration consisting of stripes and dots, was found at Ramat Rahel and dated to the end of the Byzantine period (Aharoni 1964: 122, Fig. 10:11). A body sherd of a flask was found in Storeroom 15006 (PL 1.16:41). The flask is made from black clay and has thin walls. It is decorated in black and brown colors atop a white slip. The main design is a spiral surrounded by a band decorated with triangles, crescents and dotted circles. Pottery decorated in this style is typical of Byzantine sites in Egypt (Coptic Ware). A jug decorated in a similar but cruder style was found in the same room (see No. 1 1 and the reference there). 15. Imported pottery (Red Ware) A fragment of the base of a Red Ware bowl (PL 1.16:42) was found in Room 15025. The sherd is decorated on the inside with a stamped decoration of a cross. At the top of the cross is the Greek letter P and there are two round elements below the cross's horizontal arm. This design of the monogram of Christ, which appears on imported bowls from Asia Minor (Late Roman C Ware), dates from about 500 CE (Hayes 1972: Fig. 78:68). IV. SUMMARY All the pottery in the assemblage represents the last phase of use in the building, which was apparently destroyed with the Persian conquest of Jerusalem in 614 CE. The assemblages accord well with this date; the vessels presented here are typical of the end of the Byzantine period, beginning from the middle of the sixth century CE. There are no sherds that are typical only of the Early Muslim period. This date is supported by the coins found in the ruins of the building (see Chapter 4). The pottery assemblage represents the building's last phase, in which it was divided into three units, which we interpret as the monastery, three shops and a public kitchen. Only five complete vessels were found in the monastery: a small bowl with flared walls, two small deep bowls that were 102</page><page sequence="109">THE POTTERY ASSEMBLAGE FROM AREA XV apparently used to serve portions of food prepared in the public kitchen, one plain cup and one "Bet Shean" jar. The small number of complete vessels found in the monastery is especially striking in comparison with the rich assemblage of complete vessels from the public kitchen. It may be assumed that this is a direct result of the existence of the nearby public kitchen, which apparently provided food to the monastery on a regular basis.The large number and variety of jar types within the pottery assemblage from the public kitchen are also remarkable. The finds from Storeroom 15006 are illustrative; according to the excavators' notes, jars containing various legumes such as beans, lentils and chickpeas were found here in situ. The thermos jug, found standing unbroken near the oven in Kitchen 1 50 1 1 , is a unique find. This portable vessel is especially suitable to a public kitchen in which mobility in serving is needed. The existence of the kitchen complex as a separate unit rather than as part of a public complex such as a monastery, hospice or hospital is an unknown phenomenon. We may assume that it was set up to answer the needs of the thousands of pilgrims that visited the city. The pottery assemblage from the monastery and the public kitchen is one of the largest and most varied assemblages of the Byzantine period discovered in Jerusalem. The majority of the assemblage consists of what is known as "Fine Byzantine Ware", typical of the Jerusalem region in that period. However, there are also jars attesting to ties with the Bet Shean area and the Jezreel Valley. Wine produced in this region was probably brought to Jerusalem in these jars. The "Gaza" jars were apparently brought from the Gaza region as containers of wine and preserved fish. The fragments of imported bowls from North Africa and Asia Minor, as well as the jug and flask sherds from Egypt, should also be mentioned in the context of ties with other regions.

It also includes a group of decorated lamp handles representing lamp types of which no complete examples were preserved. The pottery lamps in the assemblage belong to six main types, the earliest dating from the second half of the third century CE and the latest from the fifth to seventh centuries CE. 1. OVOID LAMP WITH A LARGE FILLING HOLE A complete lamp of this type (PL 1.17:1) was found in the large Byzantine structure in Locus 15022. The lamp is mold-made and ovoid in shape, with a large filling hole surrounded by a prominent ridge. The nozzle is round and constitutes a direct continuation of the body. The lamp has a plain ring base. Instead of the typical pyramidal knob handle, there is a double knob handle similar to that on a lamp of this type from Ramat Rahel (Aharoni 1964: Fig. 32:3). The lamp is decorated around the filling hole with a geometric pattern consisting of two rows of intersecting diagonal lines between stylized branches. Between the filling hole and the wick hole are two volutes and a horizontal band of rope pattern, decoration characteristic of this type of lamp (Israeli and Avida 1988: Figs. 368-373, 375-380). This type of ovoid lamp with a large filling hole dates from the third and fourth centuries CE (Rosenthal and Sivan 1978: 99). It is common at Beit Nattif in the Judean plain and at sites around Jerusalem. A group of lamps belonging to this type was found in burial cave No. 784 at Ramat Rahel, dated to the third century CE (Aharoni 1964: 81, Fig. 32:1-7). 2. LAMPS WITH A BOW-SHAPED NOZZLE (BEIT NATTIF LAMPS) Two complete lamps of this type (PL 1.17:2-3) were discovered in Locus 15027, which is sealed below the large Byzantine structure's floor. The lamps are mold-made with a rounded body and a ring base. The filling hole is large and surrounded by one or two prominent ridges. The nozzle is bow-shaped and has pinched sides. There is a small pyramidal knob handle on the shoulder lamp. The lamps are decorated with delicate geometric patterns. One of the lamps (Pl. 1.17:2) is decorated with a row of circles and dots around the filling hole and a double volute between the filling hole and wick hole. The other lamp (Pl. 1. 1 7:3) is decorated around the filling hole with a row of circles within squares separated by dots. Between the filling hole and wick hole is a circle containing rhombi arranged like petals around an inner circle. This type of lamp with a bow-shaped nozzle dates from the second half of the third century to the fifth century CE (Rosenthal and Sivan 1978: 105). A large quantity of lamps belonging to this type was discovered in Cistern II at Beit Nattif (Baramki 1936: Pl. X), and it is found at other sites in the Judean plain and Judean hills (Rosenthal and Sivan 1978: 105). 3. SMALL CANDLESTICK LAMPS Four complete lamps of this type were found in Area XV, one of them in Locus 15017 in the large Byzantine structure (PL 1.17:4) and another in the street to its north (Locus 15023, PL 1.17:5). Numerous fragments of lamp of this type were found throughout the entire area. Lamps of this type are also referred to as "Ain Yabrud lamps", after the site in which they were first discovered, and as 104</page><page sequence="111">POTTERY LAMPS FROM AREA XV "small slipper candles" because their shape resembles that of a bedroom slipper. The lamps are mold-made and oval in shape. They are charac- terized by a large filling hole surrounded by a single ridge, a tapered nozzle that constitutes a direct continuation of the body and a ring base. With the exception of one example (PL 1.17 :4), the lamps lack handles and instead have a small knob. There is a radial decoration of diagonal lines around the filling hole and a single varying motif appears between the filling hole and the wick hole. The most character- istic motif consists of a vertical line from which diagonal lines extend upwards (Pl. 1.17:6), usually defined as a palm branch (Rosenthal and Sivan 1978: 112) or a candlestick (Sussman 1972: 24). However, our example has an unusual shape in that there is a small circle at the end of each diagonal line. A similar motif appears on a lamp of this type from the Ophel excavations (Macalister and Duncan 1926: Pl. XXI: 8). The lamp in Pl. 1.17:5 bears a cross, also a very common motif on lamps of this type (Rosenthal and Sivan 1978: Figs. 453-460). An unusual motif depicts an amphora between two stylized branches (PL 1.17:4); a lamp of this type with an amphora motif was discovered at Bethany (Sailer 1957: Fig. 16:5). The small candlestick lamp is usually dated to the second half of the fourth and the fifth centuries CE (Rosenthal and Sivan 1978: 112-113), though some scholars extend its use to the mid-sixth century CE (Magness 1993: 250). 4. LARGE CANDLESTICK LAMPS Seven complete lamps belonging to this type were found in Area XV, of which two found outside the large Byzantine structure (PL 1.17:7-8) are presented in the plate. Lamps of this type are also referred to as "large slipper candles" because of their shape. These lamps are larger and more elongated than the small candlestick lamps. They are characterized by a large filling hole surrounded by one to three prominent ridges, a nozzle that constitutes a direct continuation of the body and a ring base. They lack handles and instead have a small knob. Around the filling hole is a relief decoration of radial diagonal lines, while on the nozzle there is a palm branch/candlestick motif. The large candlestick lamp is the most common lamp of the Byzantine period found in Israel (Sussman 1972: 24). It is usually dated to the fifth and sixth centuries CE (Rosenthal and Sivan 1978: 116), though some scholars extend the use of these lamps to the late seventh or early eighth century CE (Magness 1993: 251). 5. DECORATED LAMP HANDLES Seven decorated loop handles with rounded contours (PL 1.17:9-15), as well as a cross-shaped handle (PL 1.17:16), were found in Area XV. The handle decoration was mold-made; while the clay was leather hard it was attached to the loop handle and was worked to conceal the marks resulting from the pressing of the clay into the mold. Three handles (PL 1.17:10-11, 13) are decorated with geometric patterns similar to those on lamp handles from Stratum IIA at Ramat Rahel (Aharoni 1964: Fig. 26:13), from Stratum IIIA in the Armenian Garden in Jerusalem (Tushingham 1985: Fig. 32:40), and from Bet Shean, dated there to the sixth century CE (Hadad 1992: 44, 171). One handle (Pl. 1.17:12) is decorated with a cross surrounded by dots. A similar decoration appears on a lamp handle from Ramat Rahel (Aharoni 1964: Fig. 26: 13). A bird is depicted on one handle (Pl. 1.17:9); no parallel was found for this decorative motif. A human face portrayed on another handle (Pl. 1.17:15) resembles the face on a lamp handle from Hammat Gader (Coen-Uzzielli 1997: PL VI:3). One of the handles (Pl. 1.17:16) is in the shape of a cross. Similar handles were found at Ramat Rahel (Aharoni 1964: Fig. 26:14) and at Bet Shean (Hadad 1992: 170). The handles with various mold-made decorative patterns probably vary in shape and derive from different types of lamps. Based on the parallels, the lamps with these decorated handles should be dated to the sixth and seventh centuries CE. 6. NORTH AFRICAN LAMP One fragment of a lamp imported from North Africa (PL 1.17:17) was discovered in Locus 15007 of the large Byzantine structure. The lamp is mold-made and oval in shape. The large discus contains two perforations used as filling holes. A straight, broad channel leads from the discus to the wick hole and the bow of the lamp is elongated. The lamp is treated with a reddish slip. The center of the discus is decorated with a cross in high relief. Flanking either side of the channel on the nozzle is a decoration that 105</page><page sequence="112">Pl. 1.17. Pottery lamps from Area XV.

This lamp is classified by Hayes as Type lib, which he dates to the second quarter of the sixth century CE (Hayes 1972:314). SUMMARY The assemblage of Byzantine pottery lamps from Area XV includes a variety of types that date from the sixth and seventh centuries CE. ThÃ© most common types in the assemblage are the large candlestick lamp, the small candlestick lamp and the decorated lamp handles. The assemblage contains only a few examples of the ovoid lamp with a large filling hole and the Beit Nattif lamp; these were found in loci that date the construction of the large Byzantine structure (e.g. Locus 15027), rather than its destruction.

Ariel Two flan molds have been located so far from the excavations of B. Mazar beside the southern and western walls of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. An earlier discussion of two other flan molds from the City of David noted twenty published and unpublished flan molds from the region (Ariel 1990: 116). The count of twenty noted there included four unpublished fragments from Mazar's excavations; two of these are discussed here, but the other two, shown to me by the late B. Mazar and noted in 1990, have not yet been relocated. Though only one of the fragments published here belongs to one of the excavation areas presented in this volume (Area XV), both fragments are similar. We are therefore publishing here the second fragment (from Area VII) as well. The first fragment (Reg. No. 180, Locus 15022, Photo 1.116) derives from a room in the northeastern part of the basement level of the monastery. The finds recovered from the room comprise remains from the Iron Age II to the Byzantine period, including remains from the Second Temple period. The irregular-shaped fragment consists of the upper part of a flan mold, made of soft limestone. This is the flat portion of a two-piece mold. It has no drilled hollows, or channels connecting the hollows, but rather only the blackened remains of the flans and channels, and cut funnels - literally half-funnels. This fragment is large in comparison to other flan molds found in Jerusalem; its maximal preserved dimensions are 19.9 cm high, 28.0 cm wide and 4.3 cm thick. Parts of two sides are preserved: the top, where the funnels are located, and one of the vertical sides. The fragment as it is preserved is smaller than the best-preserved specimen of these flan molds, from Kh. Rafi' (Kloner 1976: 112). The largest fragment found there, Slab C, measures 31x22 cm. Our fragment, however, could easily be restored to those dimensions. Moreover, it is similar in organi- zation, having a plain side with blackening and funnels, and an exterior side roughly smoothed with a chisel. Another element similar to the Kh. Rafi' mold is the fact that the funnels (six are preserved) do not appear to take into consideration the upper- most hollows, as if they were added afterwards. Though it is technologically similar to the mold from Kh. Rafi', our fragment produced larger flans. Blackened marks representing nine roughly parallel rows of hollows are visible. The longest preserved row has seven hollows, and a restoration would give a maximum of nine hollows per row. The mold from Kh. Rafl' produced flans with a diameter of 12-13 mm. It is of course more difficult to estimate the diameters of the flans produced by our fragment, as the only indication is the blackenings left from the casting process. A slightly jogged attachment of the two pieces of the mold would have caused larger blackenings. Nevertheless, the blackenings indicate that the flans produced by this fragment were roughly 17-18 mm in diameter. So while this fragment is technologically similar to the mold from Kh. Rafi4, it is not identical. Another difference is the thickness of the fragment, which at 4.3 cm is clearly less than the 6-7 cm of the mold from Kh. Rafi'. Another point of interest in this fragment is the linear incision located on the upper edge (with the funnels), 2.0 cm from the preserved corner of the mold. This appears to be a guideline for the binding of the molds. On the mold from Kh. Rafi' there are two more elaborate markings which may have indicated the correct orientation of the inner slab vis- Ã -vis the outer slab to the worker in the mint. The simpler guideline found on our fragment has a parallel on at least one of the new unpublished fragments from the City of David (below). The second fragment (Reg. No. 6489a, Locus 7034, Photo 1.117) was found in a Herodian pit cut into bedrock in Area VII at the foot of Robinson's Arch. Its maximal preserved dimensions are 13.7 cm 115</page><page sequence="122">CHAPTER FIVE Photo 1.116. Flan mold No. 1 (scale 1:3). Photo 1.117. Flan mold No. 2 (scale 1 :3). high, 16.7 cm wide and 4.1 cm thick. None of the original sides of the mold is preserved; nor is there evidence for the funnels, which usually appear on the upper edge. In this fragment some of the hollows themselves (rather than the blackenings as in the fragment above) are preserved, yielding flans of 12-13 mm. These hollows are similar in size to those on the mold from Kh. Rafi'. Five rows, each of at least eight hollows, are preserved. DISCUSSION Dating In the 1990 report, flans with a diameter of 17-18 mm were not noted (Ariel 1 990: 116-117). This may support the suggestion made above that the blackenings are larger than the flans produced, which may have been 15 mm in diameter. This seems to have been the case for another flan mold fragment from the excavations of Y. Baruch in the same area as B. Mazar 's excavations in Jerusalem, near the "Hulda Gates", in 2000 (this author has been entrusted with the fragment's publication). There, the jogging of the blackenings is quite clear, and 17-18 mm blackenings reflect the casting of what were probably 15 mm flans. Both flan molds published here may thus have minted coins for one of the Hasmonean or Herodian rulers. If, however, the first flan mold did produce flans larger than 15 mm, then we may extend the range of possible use of the mold until as late as the second third of the first century CE. Distribution Additional flan molds have been uncovered since the summary of the known material in Ariel 1990. Flan molds from Nea Paphos in Cyprus were originally noted in 1970 and their Hellenistic context was consequently discussed (K. Nicolaou 1972). Sixteen pieces were noted there. Nine have since been fully published, together with flans and a connected pair of flans (I. Nicolaou 1990: 131-143). (Others not noted in 1970 have now been noted, but not published; see I. Nicolaou 1990: 131, n. 135, where fourteen more molds are reported from Paphos, and Michaelidou-Nicolaou 1993: 20.) It is not known whether these numbers include the three moulds from the Polish excavations (Daszewski 1972:232; Daszewski 1977). Five more have been excavated in the City of David (R. Reich and E. Shukron, pers. comm.) and three more have been found in the renewed excavations in the same precinct as B. Mazar's excavations (R. Reich and Y. Bilig, pers. comm.). Another unprovenanced mold now in the MusÃ©e Bible et Terre Sainte of the Institut Catholique de Paris has been published (Elayi and Elayi 1995). Finally two additional molds may be noted. One is from the excavation of M. Broshi and S. Gibson on Mount Zion in 1972 (now entrusted to this author for publication). A second was reported as having been uncovered in Sepphoris in the 1985 season of the Joint Sepphoris Project of E. Meyers and E. Netzer (D. Hendin, pers. comm., confirmed by E. Meyers and Z. Weiss), but was not examined by me. 116</page><page sequence="123">FLAN MOLDS FROM THE TEMPLE MOUNT EXCAVATIONS Despite the new data, the known distribution of flan molds has not changed. There may therefore be said to be two groups of known flan molds, Cypriot and Judean, with no technological difference between them. Typologically, also, they are almost indistinguishable. The published flan molds from Cyprus also vary in diameter. One visual difference, however, may be noted: the Cypriot flan molds have longer channels; i.e., the hollows are much more widely spaced. As for their dates, no significant chronological span appears to separate the Cypriot and Judean flan molds. This conclusion is based upon three criteria: the date of the workshop for casting flans excavated in Paphos, the date of the beginning of Hasmonean coinage, and the details of the flans themselves. The workshop in which the Cypriot flan molds were found lacked sealed loci (K. Nicolaou 1972; I. Nicolaou 1990: 131-133). Nevertheless, they were found with seventeen coins that fit the dimensions of the flan molds, and most of these coins point to a date of deposit in the late second century BCE ( contra K. Nicolaou 1972: 315, who suggested a much longer range of 217-51 BCE; our thanks to I. Nicolaou for her written clarification of this issue, dated March 28th, 2000). Judging from the shape of the Hasmonean coins, the characteristic technology of casting flan molds is apparent with their first issues. The date of the beginning of the Hasmonean coinage has been thoroughly argued. It most likely postdates the two- year issue of bronzes by Antiochus VII in Jerusalem ending 131/130 BCE (Ariel 1982: 280-281; Meshorer 1997: 35). While there is now a consensus that the first Hasmonean coins were minted by Hyrcanus I (Meshorer 1997: 3 1), it is not clear when during his reign the minting began. Meshorer has dated the beginning of Hasmonean coinage to as early as 128 BCE (Meshorer 1997: 35). We have suggested that the minting of the first coins was connected with Hyrcanus I's military activity (Ariel 1982: 281; 282, n. 27). Barag (1992-1993) and Finkielsztejn (1998) have redated Hyrcanus I's most famous campaigns to ca. 112 BCE, but there were earlier campaigns (on the coastal plain in 127-125 BCE; see Bar-Kochva 1996: 291-292). The shape of the flans of late Ptolemaic coins minted in Cyprus is remarkably similar to that of flans of Judean coins. The curved edge of the upper portions of the flans and the protruding remains of the point of the original drilling in the stone are especially similar. The struck coins of these two categories preserve the characteristic curved edge and, on rare occasions, the protruding central point. It has been tempting to locate another source of this technology in Ptolemaic Egypt. In fact, while flan molds have not been reported from Egypt, still- connected flans have been published (Dattari 1908: 165, Pis. 11:1, 2). Dattari viewed them as deriving from clay molds (Dattari 1908: 160). However, while no stone flan molds have been found in Egypt, remains of single-use clay molds have not been discovered either. In the light of the finds from Paphos, it should be suggested that the molds that produced the still-connected flans from Egypt were made of stone. In discussing the technology of coin production in the Alexandrine mint, Davesne has referred to the same finds of flan molds from Cyprus (Davesne 1998: 436). Another piece of evidence is a Ptolemaic coin "en chapelet" from a hoard found in Egypt (Davesne 1998: 436, Fig. 8); however, it is clear from the photograph that this coin was minted in Tyre. It has also become difficult to relate the fact that flan molds are not reported from Egypt to a lack of publications concerned with ancient technologies in classical Egypt. In a recent summary of the coin finds from the Graeco-Roman Museum at Alexandria, finds relating to ancient coin technol- ogies are noted (Kamel 1998: 426). Pottery molds for the production of forged coins of the second and third centuries CE, as well as genuine dies, are noted, but flan molds are not. In sum, secure evidence for expanding the distribution map of flan mold technology to Egypt is lacking. Leaving Egypt, another closely related find, from Mleiha in eastern Arabia, is also worth noting. It is not a flan mold but rather a coin mold of similar design to the flan molds from the eastern Mediter- ranean (Boucharlat and Drieux 1991). The coin mold has the following features in common with the flan molds: 1. It is made of "very fine-grained, white limestone" (incidentally, a material apparently not locally found). 2. A funnel leads to a row (at least five) of hollows connected by channels. 3. It is roughly dated close to the date of the flan molds (the first century BCE to first century CE). Nevertheless, the visual and chronological affinities are counterbalanced by the essential technological difference: after the casting of coins in 117</page><page sequence="124">CHAPTER FIVE this coin mold, no further processing was necessary besides separating the coins from their tenons. Moreover, this method is generally viewed as a later technological development (Hill 1922: 2). Finally, north of Mleiha, it has been claimed that similar flan molds were used to produce flans for coins from Susa and Seleucia on the Tigris (Le Rider 1965; reference from K. Nicolaou 1972: 314). There, too, no flan molds were actually found. Technology There is a considerable amount of literature on flan production in the ancient world (e.g. Hill 1922: 6-12; Clifford 1961: 144-147; Frere 1983: 30-32). Most (e.g. Cooper 1988: 9-10) are influenced by the finds of molds (all Celtic?) from at least nineteen different sites in England and Europe (W. Malkmus, pers. comm.). These are flan molds, despite the fact that they are invariably called coin molds. Although their dating is sometimes similar, they are quite different in appearance from those of the eastern Mediterranean (Elayi and Elayi 1995: 1086, n. 12). A different technology for producing flans, also very similar in date (the second half of the first century BCE) and closer geographically, did not require flan molds. This is the technology of cutting or chopping segments from bronze rods, as described by Kroll for finds from the Athenian Agora (Kroll 1993: 292-295). Though Hill (1922: 10) viewed this method as less common in these early periods, the cutting of flans may have been a very commonly used technology. This may explain why, despite the quantities of coins produced in the ancient world, so few flan molds of any type have been found. Hill (1922: 12-13) suggested that the easiest way to procure flans was to begin with existing coins of the right material and weight. He was clearly correct, but his observation seems to beg the question. Surely, even if many new coins were produced by recycling older coins, enormous quantities of new flans would also have been needed. The use of different technologies by minters may be a matter of different technological preferences. In the technology of cutting segments from bronze rods, the resulting thick flans had to be further treated (hammered?), or at least heated to a high temperature, before striking. In the case of the cast flans of the eastern Mediterranean flan mold type, the bronze was molten for the casting process, but the resulting flans did not need to be reheated to as high a temperature (or otherwise treated*) before striking, as they were already close to their intended shape. Hill (1922: 7) disagrees with this, claiming that the thicker the flan, the better its heat retention. Yet another possible advantage of the eastern Mediterranean technology is, as suggested by I. Nicolaou (1990: 132), that the coin striking took place while the flans were still attached to the tenons. One could heat a strip of ten or more flans together, and strike them quickly one after another. It seems likely that this would have speeded up the striking process. The clipping of the coins would have taken place after striking rather than beforehand, making the whole procedure more efficient in terms of manpower. * Wells (1977:21) presumed a flan production technology similar to the Cypriot-Judean type for Ptolemaic coins, including those from Egypt. He suggested that additional tooling took place after the production of the flans. But his rationale was related to the fact that the post-casting and pre- (and post-?) striking tooling technique was developed for particularly large coins. BIBLIOGRAPHY Ariel, D. T. 1982.

Inscription on a chancel screen (PL 1.19:1) An inscription engraved with a fine instrument on the upper border, 56 mm wide, of a marble chancel screen, broken in several pieces, the preserved portion measuring 92.5^59 cm, found in Area XV (Chapter 10, PL 1.21:1). The letters are 15 to 23 mm high. The beginning of the text is missing, together with the upper left corner of the screen. The inscription ends with a cross and a palm leaf. - - KAPnOOOPIACKAICWTHPIACTIMO 0EOYHPECB YTEPOY + [+ 'Yrcep] Kap7co(popÃ­aÃ§ Kai aa&gt;Tr|piaÄ TtpioOÄou 7rpeaÃuiepoD + [For] the offering and the salvation of Timotheus the priest. The opening formula is new in Christian inscrip- tions from our region, but it closely resembles a well-known formula of identical meaning, imsp Kap7cocpopÃ­aÃ§ Kai 7rpoocpopÃ£Ã§, which is attested in several inscriptions from Mount Nebo. One is from the upper church at 'Uyun Musa, dated to the second half of the sixth century, a funerary church belonging to the monastic community of Mount Nebo but in whose mosaic pavement several lay benefactors were commemorated;1 another, dated 535/6 CE, is from the church of St. George at Kh. al- Mukkhayyat;2 and two are in the chapel of Priest John, attached to the church of Amos and Kasiseos in the same large village of al-Mukkhayyat.3 In all four instances the first part of the formula invokes "salvation" for living benefactors, not necessarily spiritual revival in the next world but principally life and health in the present one. The second part of the invocation may be interpreted as a request for a blessing on the object of the offering (a mosaic, or in our case the screen itself), but in my opinion it can be better understood as a request for a reward for the benefactor's offering. A palm-leaf often occurs on epitaphs of men and women who died unmarried, either because of an early death or because they chose a monastic life. In this case, however, the palm may be merely a decorative element, for the donor, like all priests at the time, could marry, and nothing is said of his being a monk. On the other hand, one cannot exclude the possibility that Timotheus elected to remain celibate without being a monk, and that as a symbol of his choice he had a palm-leaf engraved on the screen that he presented to a church. If this screen was offered to the chapel of the monastery, he shared this choice with the inmates of the place. The shape of the characters in our inscription fits a dating in the mid-sixth century, contemporary to the occurrence of the parallel formula on Mount Nebo. No priest called Timotheus and active in Jerusalem is known from the sources of the time; on the other hand, a TijxÃ³GeoÃ§ (piX[Ã³xpicjToÃ§ 7rp8opÃT8p]oÃ§, or less probably 1iova%]Ã³Ã§,&lt; is commemorated in a funerary inscription on a marble slab found on the Mount of Olives, which was dated to the fifth century by the editor but is probably rather later.4 Though the inscription was interpreted as a simple epitaph, its opening formula "For the memory and the rest of Timotheus the Christ-loving [priest] (or [monk])" points rather to some commemorative structure, perhaps a mortuary chapel. This would mean that the man buried on the Mount of Olives was a person of some standing and substance, who would have had the means of offering an expensive chancel screen. However, the name was too common in the Byzantine period for us to risk an identification. The practice of inscribing chancel screens with the name of the benefactor who had donated them was very common. The following is a partial list: the offering of Priest Procopius in the cathedral church of Hippus (Susita),5 that of a mother and son (?) in the Monastery of Martyrius at Ma' ale Adummim,6 others in Bethlehem,7 at Kh. et-Tira in Samaria,8 120</page><page sequence="127">GREEK INSCRIPTIONS FROM AREA XV Deir Diwan near Ramalla,9 Umm er-Rus10 and Kh.

Fragment of chancel screen (PL 1.19:2) A fragment of a second chancel screen, also made of marble, was discovered in the excavation (exact location unknown). The fragment is irregular in shape and shows part of a molded border in its upper portion; below, in the panel itself, are engraved five letters 24 to 32 mm high, similar in shape to those of No. 1 and probably belonging to roughly the same period. The letters are THPIA, and they obviously represent part of a similar dedicatory inscription, which reads: ['Yrcep GÃ´)]xr|pÃ­a[Ã§ - [For the saljvation [of the donor]. 3. Inscribed lintel (PL 1.19:3) An inscription painted in red on a lintel found in situ above the entrance to Room 15028 (lower), in the basement of the monastery. Today, no traces of the paint remain, but a tentative reading can be obtained from three color slides taken at the time of the excavation.21 In the lower part of the lintel, to the right, a large cross on a triangular base is clearly recognizable. + KEBOH0I K(Ãºpi)e poiÄ¼0i ANTONIOY + AvtovÃ­od Lord, help Anthony. It must be stressed that the reading is far from certain. The Roman name Antonius (the correct transcription would be AvxcovioÃ§, but the interchange of long and short vowels is frequent in Byzantine spelling) was not uncommon in the region in the Byzantine period too: possibly it was given in honor of Saint Anthony, the father of Egyptian monasticism, who was commemorated on January 17th.22 4. Fragment of eulogia (Pl. 1.19:4) A fragment (about one third) of a molded disk made of light brown clay, ca. 8 cm in diameter in its original state, was found in Locus 15019. The central part bore a picture of which very little can be made out: a tower-like structure (or perhaps a staircase) surmounted by a cross; on the border, 1 cm wide, was a Greek inscription of which only 17 letters remain: - - OriAKYAIIOTHCKATA - - [ ? EÃ­&gt;A,]oyÃ­a K(upÃ­o)i) arcÃ² xfjÃ§ Kaxa[ - - ] Ablessing of the Lord from the (holy place) of [ ] The object is obviously a eulogia , a souvenir sold at holy places and stamped with their name and a picture representing the church or the saint venerated there. They might take the form of ampullae that held holy water or oil or some other liquid substance originating from the holy place, or of small round cakes. Eulogiae were not only brought home by the pilgrims as a memento of their visit to the holy place, but also jealously kept as a relic-like object of supernatural power. In the case of ampullae, the liquid could be used to cure sickness, and in the case of clay cakes, the clay could be crumbled, reduced to powder and drunk by sick people hoping for a miraculous cure.23 In our fragment the name of the sanctuary is lost, as is the picture which might have helped in identifying it, but luckily an almost whole exemplar of a similar eulogia is known from the collection at Bobbio (Pl. 1. 19:5).24 The picture represents a soldier pursuing a woman with a child in her arms; an angel above points to a rock beside the woman, which opens to hide her and the child. It is a representation of the legend of St. Elizabeth's flight, which is told in the apocryphal second-century Gospel of James. According to this story, Herod's soldiers were sent to kill all the infants in the hill-country between Bethlehem and Jerusalem, in order to be certain to do away with the newborn King of the Jews, whose birth had been announced by the comet. The soldiers came to the mountain village (later identified by Christian tradition with 'En Karem) where Elizabeth lived with her six-month-old son John, later to become John the Baptist, the "Prodromos", i.e., the herald of the coming of Christ. Elizabeth fled from the pursuing soldiers and was saved by the miraculous opening of a rock in the mountainside, which hid her and her child.25 The above-mentioned eulogia from Bobbio bears the inscription: + EÅ¯^oyÃ­a K(upÃ­o)u Ã rcÃ² xfjÃ§ Kaxa[(puyfjÃ§ xfjÃ§] Ã¡y(Ã­aÃ§) 'EAaoaÃeG, that is "A blessing of the Lord from the refuge of Saint 121</page><page sequence="128">Pl. 1.19.

The scholars who first published the eulogia from Bobbio judged it to be of Palestinian origin and Byzantine in date, despite some doubts due to the fact that it was discovered in an Italian collection of objects, some of which belonged to a much later period.26 The discovery of a fragment of an almost identical eulogia in a Byzantine context in Jerusalem justifies this hypothesis. Our fragment, which may well have come out of a very similar mold despite its broken state, provides an additional piece of information, namely, the existence of a sacred structure (represented by the tower-like building surmounted by a cross) on the rock venerated as "the refuge of Elizabeth". The veneration of a cave as the hiding- place of Elizabeth and the production of relics from this holy place are attested by two parchments kept in Rome, containing certifications of authenticity of relics from the Holy Land. The writing is of the seventh century, and the Latin texts, both incomplete, read "Soil from the cave where Elizabeth [hid] with John" and "Stone from the cave where Eliza[beth hid with John]".27 A church above the cave that had been Elizabeth's hiding place (a different church from that of St. Zachary and St. Elizabeth at 'En Karem, on the site of Mary's visitation, which is mentioned in seventh- to eighth- century sources) is mentioned for the first time by the Russian Abbot Daniel, who visited the Holy Land in 1106-1 107. 28 The tower-like structure on our eulogia indicates that at least a small sacred building, perhaps only an aedicula or a small chapel, already stood there during the existence of the monastery in Jerusalem where the eulogia was found. 123</page><page sequence="130">CHAPTER SIX 5. Seal-ring (PL 19:6) A copper alloy ring with a flat oval bezel was found among the debris on the pavement of the monastery's central courtyard (Locus 15008). An inscription is incised on the bezel, which has a diameter of 14 mm. The letters are inscribed within a trapezoid frame; outside the frame, three marks are incised on each side, which may represent a repetition of the owner's name, in monogram form and upside-down. In the central inscription the upright marks resembling a iota in lines 2, 3 and 5 are really shallow stigmas used to mark truncation of the words. The text reads: 0EOAO 08ÃÃO- 2 VAIOA vX(o Ã§) m- VBPIÃ vPp(ioÃ§) 'O- 4 AVB toÃ- PII pÃ­(ou) Theodulus Olybr(ius) (son) of Olybri(us). The marks on the sides are apparently decorative shapes arranged symmetrically and mirror-like, but when we look at the ring upside down, the marks look like letters: one can discern a cursive theta on top to the left, an omicron on top to the right, two monogrammed OY on both sides at the bottom, while the crossed squares may contain an angular epsilon , a delta and a lambda. All the characters together seem to form once again the name 0eoÃ´oÃºX,ou, "of Theodulus". 6. Fragment of Byzantine jar (PL 1.19:7) Three letters, 5.5 cm high, are painted in brownish red on a fragment of ajar found in L. 15040. A long diagonal stroke cuts the foot of the rho and the stigma. The inscription appears to be complete. nps This is probably the abbreviation of rcpoacpopÃ , "offering", used especially for offerings to ecclesi- astical institutions. 7. Fragment of ossuary (Pl. 1.19:8) Two fragments of an ossuary of the Second Temple period were found in L. 15012, in the anteroom of the monastery. On one were remains of ornamen- tation and an inscription in two lines. The fragment is now lost and all that remains is a sketch drawn by B. Mazar, which shows the inscription, on the right- hand side of a lattice border, and indicates a break that interrupts the second line. Unfortunately, the contours of the fragment are not indicated, and we have no way of knowing whether additional letters were missing at the end of the first line, or possibly on the left side of the frieze. The surviving letters read: MAPOY PIWNIW The first line obviously contained the genitive of MapriÃ§, a Greek transcription of the Semitic name inÂ» or on&amp;.29 In the second line, the last two letters are the beginning of TÅ[Ã wou], "of John", the dead man's patronymic, but the name PIWN is unknown. Moreover, it is unusual for the names of two deceased to be inscribed on the same ossuary, unless they were related. Here no relationship is indicated and there is no connecting particle (icai) between the two names. A not implausible solution would require only the restoration of two letters, KY, at either the end of line 1 or the beginning of line 2, beyond the ornamental pattern. The inscription would then read: MÃ¡pou [Ku]picÃ»v(oÃ§) Tco[Ã¡wou], that is, "Of Mares Kyrion (son) of John". Kyrion is the Greek translation of Mares, and we would thus have one man called by his Aramaic and his Greek name. There is nothing surprising in the presence of a broken ossuary of the Second Temple period among the ruins of a Byzantine sacred building. Such an object could easily be invested with an actual religious meaning in the eyes of the Christians who inhabited or frequented the building, through the belief that it contained the relics of a New Testament personage or an early Christian martyr. Fragments of ossuaries were discovered, for instance, in the church of St. Salome near Beth Govrin, a Second Temple period tomb with loculi which was enlarged and transformed into an underground chapel in the Byzantine period. The name of the saint to whom the church was dedicated makes it clear that the ossuaries were not merely a leftover from the earlier stage, but were recognized as the repository of the bones of a holy woman, probably Salome the midwife, a figure of the apocryphal gospels.30 In Byzantine eyes an ossuary would certainly be recognized as antique, but no chronological judgement could be formed: therefore, a Christian of that time might easily have taken it for the receptacle of bones of a Christian martyr of one of the great persecutions ordered by the Roman emperors. A Kupicov was listed among the famous Sebastene 124</page><page sequence="131">GREEK INSCRIPTIONS FROM AREA XV martyrs, the forty soldiers of the Legion XII Fulminata who froze to death in a pond near Melitene in Asia Minor rather than deny their faith during the persecution of Licinius. They had an early and widespread cult in the East, and their relics were brought to Jerusalem by Melania the Younger at the beginning of the fifth century.31 Another martyr whose name is a simple variant of Kupicov was the child Kyrikos, martyred in Cilicia with his mother Julitta: KupucÃ³Ã§, sometimes spelt KrjpiKÃÃ§ or KupiaicÃ³Ã§, is another common translation of the Aramaic Mares. St. Kyrikos had several churches dedicated to him in Palestine32 and his cult is also documented in Jerusalem.33 It is worth noting that in the Syriac dialect spoken in Byzantine Palestine, the term mÂ» had come to signify "saint",34 so whoever read the inscription on the ossuary at that time and place was apt to understand that the bones therein were those of St. Kyrion. It is very likely, therefore, that this ossuary was kept in the chapel of the building as a reliquary related to the cult of the Sebastene martyrs or of the child-martyr, both well- known elements of the liturgical life of Byzantine Jerusalem.

It is inscribed on a dressed, rectangular building stone measuring 27x20 cm. The right side of the stone is missing. The following inscription appears on the left side of the stone: in rrn[nÂ¡D...] The style of the script is formal. The left leg of the taw rises so high that the top of the letter almost cuts it in half. The left end of the top of the taw extends beyond the left leg and angles sharply downward. In contrast, the base of the leg, which faces left, is shorter than usual. Despite the letter's formal shape, the influence of cursive script upon it is apparent from the manner in which the taw is made in a loop descending from the left which rises and returns to the right. The yod is long and can hardly be distin- guished from a waw. The top of the yod is adorned with a small triangle. The left leg of the he does not touch the top of the letter. The bet , dalet and resh all have a small tag affixed to their upper left-hand corner. The script is very similar to that of many inscrip- tions from the Herodian period, starting with the Uzziahu inscription and ending with the inscriptions on ossuaries. These inscriptions are written in formal script (Yardeni 1991: 58-59). The triangular decoration atop the yod also appears in the Uzziahu inscription and the open form of the he appears intermittently over the years. The he appears mainly in its closed form on the ossuary inscriptions, which date from the first century CE until the destruction of the Second Temple. It occurs in its open form in the Uzziahu and zkenim inscriptions (Sukenik 193 1 : 288-290; Mazar 1975: 146-148), as opposed to the inscription from Beth Hateqi'ah (Mazar 1975: 138-139), where it is closed. Though the three latter inscriptions cannot be dated absolutely, it is reasonable to assume that they date from the late first century BCE; all of them can be attributed to the period of monumental construction in Jerusalem in the time of Herod. In the rabbinical sources the shape of the letter he is said to be of chrono- logical value (Palestinian Talmud, Megillah , 10 b). However, there is no knowing which period was intended. Since there are no letters here that enable the inscription to be dated more precisely, a date in the early first century CE would be appropriate. Photo 1.118. The inscription in situ. Photo 1.119. The inscription (scale 1:4). 127</page><page sequence="134">CHAPTER SEVEN The language of the inscription is Aramaic, as proven by the word "bar". The name "Matityah", or in its shortened form "Matyah", is very common among the Jews of Jerusalem in this period and it appears frequently in the ossuary inscriptions and the writings of the Sages from this time. There are traces of abrasion beneath this inscription, which may in fact be erased letters. The height of the erased line, however, is less than the height of the letters in the first line. It is possible that a different person added another inscription there, perhaps in cursive script, and that inscription was later erased. Since this is not a burial inscription but rather a given name that is inscribed on a building stone, this inscription may be viewed as a commemorative inscription for a donor or perhaps as a dedicatory inscription.

The ossuary was found on the floor of the alcove, placed on two fieldstones in the southwestern corner. One field photograph and three studio photographs of the ossuary are all that remain from the excavation records. Apart from the short notes that Prof. Mazar recorded in his diary, we have no further details. Though we were able to ascertain the position in which the ossuary was found from the field photograph, our efforts to locate the ossuary itself have been unsuccessful. Consequently, many details of the ossuary cannot be established, including its dimensions, which we can only approximate. The ossuary is shaped like a rectangular chest on four short legs (Photo 1.120). It was found without its lid, and the upper part of the ossuary was broken and damaged in a way that seems intentional. Chisel marks are visible on the inside of the walls. It was made, probably by local craftsmen, from the soft limestone that is characteristic of the hundreds of ossuaries found in Jerusalem and its surroundings. The ossuary is small in comparison to those intended for adult burials and was probably originally designed for the burial of a child (Rahmani 1994: 6). It contained only the partially broken skull of an adult, resting on its side. The skull occupied the full width of the ossuary and half its length; the lower jaw was placed next to the side of the ossuary. * I would like to thank L.Y. Rahmani and A. Kloner for their useful comments. The outside of the ossuary is decorated with what appears in the photograph to be a typical decoration. A pair of incised lines running close to the edges serves as a border. In the middle of the ossuary's long side is a pair of vertical incised lines that divide the side into two parts. Each part consists of a square with a border and an incised six-petalled rosette in its center. In the middle of the double line between the two rosettes is a hole 7 mm in diameter that was drilled from both sides of the ossuary (Photos 1.121-122). An identical rosette pattern is also incised within a border on the ossuary's narrow side. Since the decorations on ossuaries are usually duplicated on opposite sides, we can assume that there were identical rosettes on the sides of the ossuary that are not visible in the picture. The outline of the rosettes' petals was made with a compass, while their interior was deeply carved in a technique similar to wood carving. A triple incised circle surrounds each rosette. The treatment of the right-hand rosette on the long side of the ossuary was left incomplete and one petal is indicated only by an incised line. Unfinished ossuary decorations should probably be attributed to a certain degree of negligence on the part of the craftsman. The origin of the rosette decoration appearing on ossuaries in different variants should be sought in the decoration on tomb facades of the same period in Jerusalem. The six-petalled rosette is the most popular variant; this decoration is easily executed by drawing circles with a compass (Rahmani 1994: 7-9, 39-40). Rosette decoration that is very similar to that on the ossuary under discussion appears on other ossuaries from Jerusalem. The most similar of these was found in Jerusalem, though its exact provenance is unknown (Rahmani 1994: No. 267). Another similar ossuary (Rahmani 1994: No. 123) comes from Mount Scopus, not far from the Temple Mount. 129</page><page sequence="136">CHAPTER EIGHT Photo 1.120. The ossuary, decorated with incised rosettes. Note the hole drilled in the center of the side. There was apparently another ossuary in secondary use in the monastery, since two additional fragments were found in the collapse debris in the anteroom (Locus 15012). One of these fragments has an incised zigzag decoration and a Greek inscription (see Chapter 6, PL 1.19:8). A fragment of an ossuary lid, probably that of the ossuary found in the alcove in the basement, was found in the destruction debris on the street (Locus 15021) that runs along the monastery's eastern wall (the alcove is on the other side of this wall). The lid is a flat slab 3.2 cm thick and 20 cm wide. The slab is broken and its original length is unknown. Running along the center of the outside of the slab is an incised decoration consisting of a band 6.5 cm wide within which are wavy lines and concentric circles. Next to the edge of the incised strip is a hole that was drilled from both sides (Photo 1.123, Fig. 1.9). The holes in the long side of the ossuary and in the ossuary lid were probably used in the cult of relics, during which holy oil was poured over the relics in the chest. Following this, the oil was collected and dispensed to the faithful, who Photo 1.121. The hole in the center of the ossuary's side, close-up from the outside. Photo 1.122.

The ossuary lid with a drilled hole. considered it to be imbued with healing qualities (Aviam 1993: 58-59). Another possibility is that the holes were used to close the chest and safeguard its contents. This method of closing was used, albeit extremely rarely, in ossuaries (Rahmani 1994: 9-10) and in reliquary chests (Weitzman 1979: 633, No. 572). The use of ossuaries in Jewish burialÅ first appeared in Jerusalem and the surrounding area in ca. 20 BCE and was widespread until the destruction of the city in 70 CE. All of the ossuaries discovered in Jerusalem (except for fragments that should probably be attributed to different phases of production) were found outside the settled quarters of the city. This is in accordance with Jewish religious law and the custom practiced in Jerusalem during the Second Temple period of burying the dead beyond the city walls (Kloner 1980: 145-150). The find spot of the ossuary under discussion, a few meters south of the eastern Hulda Gate and of the area that served as a central ritual bath for pilgrims visiting Jerusalem, is inappropriate to a Jewish burial in situ. It seems likely that the ossuary was originally used for a Jewish burial during the Second Temple period, probably on the nearby Mount of Olives, and was emptied of its contents and transferred during the Byzantine period to the basement of the monastery. The alcove on whose floor the ossuary was found was designed to contain the ossuary and safeguard it. The window connecting the alcove to the adjacent room attests to the importance placed on airing and lighting the room. The assemblage in which the ossuary was found, as well as the skull placed in it, are indicative of the secondary use of the ossuary as a reliquary. This skull may have belonged to a saint who was revered by the occupants of the monastery. 131</page><page sequence="138">CHAPTER EIGHT Since the shape of the ossuary is highly reminiscent of that of Byzantine reliquary chests, it is not surprising that it was chosen for this purpose. On the other hand, no other ossuaries have been found to date in secondary use as reliquaries. In fact, only one other ossuary from the Second Temple period is known to have been put into secondary use, probably during the Byzantine period. The ossuary was found in the vicinity of Jerusalem and has two Greek letters on it (Clermont-Ganneau 1899: 411-412, No. 29). Many Jewish burial caves in the vicinity of Jerusalem that were first used in the Second Temple period were reused for Christian burials during the Byzantine period. The ossuaries in these caves were preserved without being damaged by the Christians (Avni 1993: 272-275). In this light, the use of the ossuary as a reliquary should be viewed as an anomaly.

We have only 39 stamped ceramic tiles from the area, 36 of which were recovered from within the remains of the monastery structure. Consequently, no statistical research could be carried out. The tiles were found in all of the ground- floor rooms, which also contained the collapse of the second story. There are two types of roof tiles: flat ( tegulae ) and convex {imbrices). The roof was constructed from a combination of the two types, with the convex tiles overlying the flat ones. Different kinds of stamps appear on both types of tiles. The convex tiles were stamped along the edge of the broad side, while the stamps on the flat tiles do not occur in a fixed location. In examining the wide range of stamped designs on the tiles, one can assume that these do not represent different workshops but rather are technical aids, probably for counting quantities and output. Nine designs appear on the tiles from Area XV, of which eight are from the monastery structure. The most common is the round stamp with a plain cross inside it (PL 1.20:1). Others are round stamps consisting of a single, complete circle (Pl. 1.20:2), a dotted circle (PL 1.20:3), three adjacent circles (PL 1.20:4) and two concentric circles (Pl. 1.20:5). Two other round examples are a wheel with eight spokes (Pl. 1.20:6) and a circle containing the letter B (PL 1.20:7). Another stamp is a leaf design (PL 1.20:8). Another method of marking the tiles was by incising them with a three- or four-toothed comb (Pl. 1.20:9). The same group of designs, occasionally with slight variations, appears on roof tiles discovered in both residential and public structures of the Byzantine period in the Jerusalem area. Based on parallels, the stamps date from the fifth-seventh centuries CE (Aharoni 1960: 76-81; Crowfoot and Fitzgerald 1929: 81-84; Hamilton 1944: 1-55; Tsafrir and Hirschfeld 1979: 291-329). Since the monastery may have been constructed in the fourth century CE, the date of the tiles can perhaps be extended to include this century. BIBLIOGRAPHY Aharoni, Y. 1960.

Among them were a small column with a small Corinthian capital, larger capitals, altar tables, etc. However, most of the assemblage consists of ecclesiastical chancel screen panels. Although in Israel marble objects are generally less frequent in sites of the Byzantine period than in Roman period sites, the distribution of the former is wider and encompasses more sites, primarily churches. Among the marble ecclesiastical objects, the chancel screens, which in churches separate the nave from the enclosed sanctuary or bema , are of great importance. Some of the chancel screen panels were imported already carved from the cities of Asia Minor and Greece, while others were brought here in an unfinished state and their carving was completed in local workshops. Local artists who worked in those workshops are mentioned in the historical and epigraphical sources (Fischer and Grossmark 1996: 474-475). There is also archaeo- logical evidence that local artists worked on some of the chancel screens. An example of this is the chancel screen from Susita, now on exhibit at the Israel Museum. An unsuccessful attempt at carving the reverse side of this screen was made and was ultimately considered unsatisfactory. It is incon- ceivable that this screen was sent to Israel from abroad in such a condition (Tsafrir 1984: 394). The chancel screen panels from the Temple Mount excavations are very finely carved and all of them are decorated in relief. The range of subjects depicted on them is impressive. Although the panels were not discovered intact, it is possible in most instances to reconstruct their decorative patterns on the basis of parallels of complete chancel screens found in Byzantine sites in Israel and Transjordan. Most of the screens discovered in the monastery and its surrounding area are characteristic of the region. The fragments of chancel screen panels found in the monastery were not discovered in situ , but rather scattered throughout the area of the monastery. They do not appear to have been reused as building material or brought together in one place to be crushed into lime, as was done at other sites. Their dispersion throughout the various rooms of the monastery resulted from the collapse of the second story, in which the church to which the chancel screen panels belonged was probably located. One chancel fragment was discovered in Room 15025, next to the kitchen (Locus 15011). It is presumed that the church was located above both of these rooms. Other chancel fragments were discovered in the central water cistern (Locus 15017) and in the shops (Loci 15026 and 15061). Together with the chancel screens from the monastery, we present here additional types found in other excavation areas. The very large quantity of fragments of chancel screen panels discovered in the Temple Mount excavations attests to the presence of a number of churches in this area during the Byzantine period. Most of these fragments were discovered in secondary use, incorporated in later construction (Photos 1.124-125). Only represen- tative examples of each type are presented here. CHANCEL SCREEN PANELS Type Is Chancel screen panels decorated with a laurel wreath (Pl. 1.21) A large laurel wreath in the center of the panel is the most common decoration on chancel screens of the Byzantine period in churches in Israel and Transjordan.

Occasionally, when the panel is narrow, the wreath occupies most of the panel's area, the tendrils are short and not enough room remains for the crosses. Laurel wreaths also constitute the most common decoration on the chancel screens from the Temple Mount excavations. Two of them (Nos. 1 and 2) were discovered in Area XV. 1. Ten fragments of this panel were preserved. The dimensions of the preserved portion are 59 cm high, 92.5 cm wide and 3.6 cm thick. The panel is rectangular and delineated by a border, 12.5 cm wide, consisting of three rectangular mouldings. A Greek inscription is incised along the upper part of the chancel screen's border and ends with a diagonal branch (see Appendix 5, PL 1.19:1). In the center of the panel is a round shell encircled by a wreath. The Fig. 1. 10. Reconstruction of the complete form of chancel screen panels decorated with a laurel wreath containing a shell. Photo 1.125. A chancel screen post in secondary use. wreath is made from two branches, each of which consists of five groups of four laurel leaves. Each of these groups slightly overlaps the bottom of the group above it. An ovolo at the top of the wreath connects the two ends of the branches. The two lowest groups of leaves on the wreath are tied together by a ribbon or tendril that extends to the left in a wavy line right up to the edge of the panel. On each side the tendril splits into two, with one of its shoots rising towards the cross and the other shoot descending towards the corner. At the end of each tendril is a heart-shaped ivy leaf. On either side of the wreath was originally a cross. It is clear that the crosses have been removed with a chisel from this panel and No. 2, without polishing of the resulting roughened area. It seems likely that the crosses were removed by the Muslim conquerors of Jerusalem, who put the panels to secondary use of some kind. 2. Eighteen fragments of this panel were preserved. The dimensions of the preserved portion are 86 cm high, 81 cm wide and 4.4 cm thick. The panel is rectangular and delineated by a border, 12.5 cm wide, consisting of three rectangular mouldings. A wreath made from two branches, each consisting of seven groups of three leaves, surrounds a round shell in the center of the panel. To the left and right of the wreath were originally crosses. Although not all the pieces of Nos. 1-2 were preserved, the screens of this type can be recon- structed in their entirety (Fig. 1.10) by analogy with similar fragments discovered in the excavation and parallels from other sites. 138</page><page sequence="145">CHANCEL SCREEN PANELS AND POSTS FROM THE TEMPLE MOUNT EXCAVATIONS 3-8. Fragments of panels. These fragments were discovered in the Temple Mount excavations, though we lack information regarding their exact provenance. Together with many other similar fragments, they are attributed to the type of chancel screen panels decorated with laurel wreaths. A few were decorated with a shell within a wreath, and others with a cross of varying type within a wreath. The laurel wreath, originally a pagan symbol of victory, became in Christian symbolism a symbol of eternity and triumph over death because of its evergreen nature (Ferguson 1966: 33). In most cases, the wreath on the chancel screen panel contains a plain cross or a cross with a fleur-de-lis (lily). The Greek term for a laurel wreath surrounding a cross is axsÃ­pavoGxaupÃ­ov (, stephanostaurion ), according to the inscription found in the Monastery of the Lady Mary at Beth Shean (Sailer 1941: 288; Fitzgerald 1939: 3). Chancel screen panels decorated with a cross within a wreath from which tendrils emerge, sometimes flanked by crosses, were discovered at the Ophel in Jerusalem, at the Dominus Flevit church on the Mount of Olives, at Mount Nebo and Umm al-Rasas in Transjordan, at Nessana, Shivta, Mampsis, Oboda and Rehovot-in-the-Negev, at Horvat Hesheq in Galilee and in many other sites in Israel and Transjordan (Crowfoot and Fitzgerald 1929: PL XVIII: 13, 16, 19; Bagatti 1956: Fig. 2; Sailer 1941: PL 125:24, 26-28, 30; Piccirillo and Alliata 1994: 229:22; Colt 1962: PL XIX:5; Segal 1988: 252; Negev 1988: 93, Fig. 9; Negev 1997: Photo 164; Patrich 1988: 111. 187: Aviam 1990: 364, Fig. 20). The chancel screens vary in a number of respects, such as the number of leaves in each group, the number of groups of leaves on each branch, the way in which the branches are tied at the bottom of the wreath, the shape of the leaves at the end of the tendrils and the dimensions of the various elements. This kind of chancel screen panel was common not only in churches but also in synagogues of the Byzantine period. In the latter there was a seven- branched menorah instead of the cross within the wreath; these were found, for example, in the synagogues at Rehov, Hammat Gader and Ashdod (Foerster 1989: 1811, Figs. 6, 8, 9). In contrast to the chancel screen panels decorated with a cross within a wreath, panels containing a shell within a wreath are very rare. Most examples include a small cross in the center of the shell. An example of this type of decoration is the chancel screen found at Mount Nebo (Sailer 1941: Pl. 125:22, 29b). A panel from Nessana was reconstructed by the excavators, probably on the basis of parallels, with a cross in the center of the shell (Colt 1962: PL XVIII: 1). Like the laurel wreath, the shell, which in pagan art was associated with the birth of Aphrodite from the foam of the waves, took on the meaning of resurrection and triumph over death in Christian art. The shell motif is commonly found on Late Roman and Byzantine sarcophagi (Goodenough 1958: 104). 9. A small fragment of a panel (27 cm high, 16.5 cm wide) lacking exact provenance. The fragment is decorated with a rosette consisting of eight narrow petals, each ending in a small circle. A small portion of the border is preserved at the top. Similar six- petalled rosettes appear at Rehovot-in the-Negev on disks that adorn the upper corners of a panel decorated with a wreath containing a cross (Patrich 1988: PL X:46, Ills. 188-189). Similar rosettes appear in all four corners of a chancel screen panel decorated with a wreath containing a cross from Humayma in Transjordan (Schick 1995: Photo 4, PL 44). A six-petalled rosette in a medallion of acanthus leaves appears on a chancel screen panel found on Mount Nebo. Though the rosette on fragment No. 9 is not identical to the rosette from Rehovot-in-the- Negev, one can assume that it similarly adorned the upper part of a chancel screen panel with a wreath in the center. Type 2: Chancel screen panels decorated with harts (Pl. 1.22) A large number of fragments of marble chancel screen panels depicting the lower portion of the body of a hoofed animal were discovered in the Temple Mount excavations. Five of these fragments were recovered from the area of the monastery: 1. Three fragments of a panel, which fit together, found in the central cistern (Locus 15017). The preserved portion of the panel is 43.5 cm high, 38 cm wide and 2.7 cm thick. A portion of the border is preserved along the bottom of the fragment and above it are the forequarters of a hoofed animal (excluding the lower right hoof and the head). The lower portion of the right hind leg is also preserved. The animal is depicted facing left. On the belly, behind the right foreleg, are three parallel stripes that are probably meant to depict the ribs. The 139</page><page sequence="146">Pl. 1.22.

A portion of the border is preserved along the bottom of the fragment, and above it the two hind legs of a pacing animal facing right. The cleft hoof and leg joints are portrayed in a naturalistic style. 3. Two fragments of a panel, which fit together, discovered in a shop at the front of the monastery (Locus 15061). The preserved portion of the panel measures 26 cm high, 19.8 cm wide and 3.2 cm thick. The forelegs of an animal facing the right side of the panel are depicted on the fragments. Indication of the ribs is visible along the belly. 4-7. Fragments of panels. The provenance of these fragments is unknown. All of them belong to the same type. 8. Fragment of a panel (15.7 cm high, 19.8 cm wide, 2.4 cm thick). The provenance of this fragment is unknown. Part of the panel's border is preserved along the bottom, and above it are three wavy lines depicting a hill and the lower part of a cross atop it. The manner in which the hill is depicted creates the illusion of water flowing out from it. This fragment assists in reconstructing the complete form of the chancel screen panels of Type 2 (Fig. 1.11). Panels from other Byzantine sites in our region depict two harts opposite each other flanking a cross that stands atop the Hill of Golgotha. On the panel fragments of found in the Temple Mount excavations the harts stand with their heads upright in front of the cross. A slightly different scene is portrayed on panels that are now in Fig. 1.11. Reconstruction of the complete form of Type 2 chancel screen panels. 142 collections in Baltimore and Washington. On these panels of unknown provenance, as well as on a silver case originally from North Africa and now in the Vatican Library Museum, is a scene depicting harts with one foreleg raised and their heads lowered to drink water flowing from Golgotha (Weitzmann 1979: Figs. 577-578; Morey 1953: Fig. 98). Two panels portraying harts standing upright with one raised foreleg were found in a church at Nahariya, which the excavator dates from the first half of the sixth century CE to the Persian conquest (Lazar 1978: 20, Fig. 18). Two marble panels dating from the sixth century CE are still in situ near the altar in the church at St. Catherine's Monastery in Sinai. Unlike the panels from Nahariya, on these panels the harts stand upright with all four hooves touching the ground, like those on the Temple Mount panels (Forsyth and Weitzmann 1965: Pis. lxxxiv, lxxxv, lxxxvi :a-b). A fragment of a marble panel portraying the hindquarters of a hart was discovered in a Byzantine church at Tell Hassan in Jericho (Baramki 1936: PI. LVI:5). Another panel, of unknown provenance and almost completely preserved, has a scene depicting two harts on either side of the cross of Golgotha (this panel is displayed in the courtyard at the entrance to the offices of the Israel Antiquities Authority in the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem). The composition of harts facing each other on either side of the cross of Golgotha appears to be charac- teristic of the chancel screen panels of our region. There is evidence that some of the panels now in collections should be attributed to Israel or Syria (Weitzmann 1979: 638). The composition of the chancel screens decorated with harts combines two common Christian symbols. The first symbol is that of the hart, which according to Psalms 42:1 ("As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after Thee, O God") is a symbol of devoutness and strong religious belief. Because the hart tends to seek shelter in high terrain, the early Christians also viewed it as a symbol of solitude and pure living. The zoological identity of the hart is frequently confused with that of a gazelle, ibex or hind (Ferguson 1966: 25). The second symbol is the cross on the Hill of Golgotha, depicted here as the "Tree of Life" from which flow the four sacred rivers of the Garden of Eden: the Pishon, the Gihon, the Euphrates and the Tigris. This symbol frequently appears on ampullae. In these instances, the cross on Golgotha alludes not only to the crucifixion itself</page><page sequence="149">CHANCEL SCREEN PANELS AND POSTS FROM THE TEMPLE MOUNT EXCAVATIONS but also to the redemption of which humanity was deemed worthy in the aftermath of the crucifixion. According to Christian tradition, the four rivers flowing from the rock are analogous to the four Gospels emanating from Christ. The rivers or the Gospels quench the spiritual thirst of mankind, like the rock struck by Moses to release water to quench the thirst of the people of Israel (Ferguson 1966: 43-44; Weitzmann 1979: 638). Two of the harts (Nos. 2-3) appearing on panel fragments found in the vicinity of the monastery face towards the right. Neither is of the same thickness as fragment No. 1 , and thus neither can be joined to it to form one panel. Hence, there were at least three chancel screen panels decorated with harts in the monastery. It is interesting to note that on most of the fragments of this type of chancel screen panel discovered in the Temple Mount excavations, the harts are portrayed as tall and thin. This depiction contrasts with that of the full-fleshed harts on the panels from Nahariya and St. Catherine's Monastery. Thus, a different workshop probably supplied the panels to the churches south of the Temple Mount. Type 3: Chancel screen panels decorated with an architectural structure (Pl. 1.23) Two fragments of marble chancel screen panels depicting parts of an architectural structure were found in a shop at the front of the monastery (Locus 15061). Additional fragments of this type of panel were discovered elsewhere in the Temple Mount excavations. From these fragments it is possible to reconstruct, at least partially, the shape of the panels. 1-4. Fragments of chancel screen panels. No. 1, depicting a column atop a base, was discovered in secondary use in the paving south of the Double Gate (Locus 1 1005). No. 2, whose provenance in the excavation is unknown, depicts the upper end of a column with a Corinthian capital and above it the lower corner of a gable. Nos. 3-4, also of unknown provenance, depict a column and its base. The two fragments of this type found in Locus 15061 are: A. Dimensions: 10.9 cm high, 20 cm wide, 2.4 cm thick (Chapter 1, PI. 1.11:10). Part of the border is preserved along the bottom. Above it is a vertical recessed line. This line most probably denotes the edge of a column or other architectural element. B. Dimensions: 12.7 cm high, 13.5 cm wide, 2.3 cm thick (Chapter 1 , Pl. 1. 1 1 :6). On the fragment is a rather prominent column atop a base. Chancel screen panels decorated with architec- tural structures are not common in churches in Israel and Transjordan. Three fragments of a panel of almost identical type were found in the Church of St. Stephen at Umm al-Rasas in Transjordan, which dates from 587 until the ninth century CE. From these fragments it is possible to reconstruct the architectural structure as a gabled aedicula supported by columns with Corinthian capitals. Ribbons or floral tendrils emerging in a wavy fashion from the base of the gable adorn the upper part of the panel (Piccirillo and Alliata 1994: 291, Figs. 10-12). Similar aediculae portrayed on the panels of altar tables were discovered in large numbers in Ravenna, the capital of the Western Empire in this period. On the complete altar panels, there are crosses standing in the center of the aediculae (Martinelli 1968: Figs. 3-10). It is assumed that crosses also stood in the center of the chancel screen panels discovered in the Temple Mount excavations and in the Church of St. Stephen at Umm al-Rasas in Transjordan. Type 4: Chancel screen panels decorated with pomegranates (PI. Äª.24) Three fragments of chancel screen panels decorated with pomegranates were found in Area XV, though their exact provenance is unknown. Another fragment was found in Area XII. 1 . Fragment of the upper portion of a panel (11.5 cm high, 11 cm wide, 2.4 cm thick). Below the border is a pomegranate, which is placed at an angle towards the left side of the panel. 2. Fragment of the upper portion of a panel (14.2 cm high, 18.5 cm wide, 2.6 cm thick). A pomegranate on the end of a branch is preserved below the moulded border of the panel. To its left is a rope medallion; the ends of the rope are visible to the medallion's right. 3. Fragment of a panel (19.5 cm high, 17.1 cm wide, 2.6 cm thick).

In Christian symbolism the church is likened to a pomegranate because of the uniformity of its innumerable seeds, all equal and contained within the same fruit. In pagan mythology, the pomegranate was an attribute of Proserpine, goddess of the underworld, and symbolized her cyclical return to the earth in the spring. The pagan symbolism of the pomegranate, associated with the coming of spring and the rebirth of vegetation, was preserved in Christian art, in which the pomegranate was used to symbolized resurrection and immortality (Ferguson 1966: 37). This explains the frequency of the pomegranate as a decoration on mosaic floors and lintels of churches. Despite this, pomegranates are not very common on chancel screen panels. They occur in Israel on two panels from the northern church at Oboda in the Negev, dated between the mid-fourth century and the Muslim conquest in 636 CE. These panels are decorated with acanthus scrolls separated by pomegranates (Negev 1997: 122, Photos 174-175). The panels lack the borders, rope medallions and shells that appear on the fragments from the Temple Mount excavations; it therefore appears that the latter belong to panels decorated with a different composition, which we are unable to reconstruct. Type 5: Chancel screen panels decorated with floral or geometric patterns (Pl. 1.25) A fragment of a marble chancel screen panel (No. 1) decorated with a floral pattern was discovered in one of the monastery's rooms (Locus 15025). A similar fragment also derives from the Temple Mount excavations, though its exact provenance is unknown. In addition, fragments of panels decorated with vine tendrils and other floral elements or geometric patterns were discovered in various areas of the excavation. A selection of these is presented below: 1. Fragment of a panel (17.1 cm high, 16.9 cm wide, 4 cm thick). This fragment is decorated with a branch flanked by two groups of leaves facing each other. Each group consists of four leaves. 2. Fragment of a panel (18 cm high, 12.1 cm wide, 2.5 cm thick). This fragment is decorated with a branch pattern flanked by groups of leaves, similar to fragment No. 1. The decoration on the two fragments depicted above belongs to an acanthus scroll or branch. In many cases, such as the acanthus scrolls on the chancel screen panels found at Oboda (Negev 1997: 122, Photos 174-175), the acanthus leaves extend from the branch in only one direction. However, there are also examples of panels decorated with acanthus branches from which the leaves extend in both directions, like the one on the chancel screen panel from the synagogue in Ashdod (Foerster 1989: Fig. 9). 3-6. Fragments of panels decorated with a variety of floral and geometric patterns. CHANCEL SCREEN POSTS (PL. 1.26) Many marble and limestone chancel screen posts were found in secondary use in different areas of the Temple Mount excavations. The posts are square in section, decorated on the front and frequently on the back with double or triple rectangular borders. This decoration creates a play of light and shadow and gives depth to the smooth surfaces of the post. In most cases the inner rectangle is plain, but occasionally it is decorated with a geometric or floral pattern, filling the entire area of the rectangle. Most of the undecorated sides of the posts have slots cut into them in which the chancel screen panels were inserted. The corner posts have slots in adjacent sides. The tops of the posts are either round or in a variety of hemispherical shapes. The posts and their tops were made as one piece. 1. Fragment of the upper part of a marble corner post (51 cm high, 18.5 cm wide, 18 cm thick). The front of the post is decorated with a shallow double rectangular border. The top of the border is concave. Chancel screen posts with rectangular borders that are concave at the top were found in the Monastery of the Lady Mary at Beth Shean (Fitzgerald 1939: PI. v: 3) and at Hittin, apparently from a synagogue located there (Ilan 1991: 138: Fig. 2). The right side and back of the post are slotted. The left side of the post was not dressed or smoothed. The top of the post is hemispherical, tapering towards the top. 2. Fragment of the upper part of a marble post (56 cm high, 21 cm wide, 18 cm thick). The front and back of the post are decorated on top with an incised horizontal line, below which is a double rectangular border. The post is slotted on both the right and left sides.

The tops of the posts from the Temple Mount excavations differs slightly from these examples in that they are in the shape of a tapered hemisphere rather than a tapered complete ball or two-thirds of a ball. 3. Fragment of the upper part of a marble post (51 cm high, 16.5 cm wide, 15 cm thick). The top of the front is decorated with an incised horizontal line, below which is a double rectangular border. The back of the post is smooth and the sides are slotted. The top of the post, which is slightly broken, is spherical. 4. Fragment of the upper part of a limestone post. The top of the front is decorated with an incised horizontal line, below which is a triple rectangular border. The top of the border is concave. The top of the post is spherical and relatively small. We have no information on the dimensions or the other sides of the post, since only a photograph of this object is available. Chancel screen posts with spherical tops that are not tapered are somewhat less common in sites in Israel and Transjordan. Limestone chancel screen posts with spherical tops, decorated with geometric patterns inside the borders, were found in the northern church at Rehovot-in-the-Negev (Patrich 1988: PL IX:39). 5. Fragment of the upper part of a marble post (61 cm high, 22 cm wide, 19.5 cm thick). The front and back of the post are decorated with a double rectangular border. The other two sides are slotted. The top of the post is spherical and slightly oblate, with a round knob on top. No parallels were found for posts with this type of top. 6. Fragment of the upper part of a marble post (43 cm high, 23 cm wide, 25 cm thick). The front of the post is decorated with a wide double rectangular border. The other three sides of the post are slotted; this is a rather uncommon occurrence and the post probably functioned as a partition post. The top of the post is truncated, with a round depression in its center. A similar example was found in the crypt of the northern church at Rehovot-in-the-Negev (Patrich 1988: PL X:49). The top of the post was probably cut intentionally for the insertion of an architectural element above it. Chancel screen posts with truncated tops, without depressions, were also found in other areas of the Temple Mount excavations. These posts were meant to support round columns of a smaller diameter. Similar posts were found in churches at Shivta, Mount Nebo, Umm al-Rasas and other sites (Segal 1988: No. 21; Sailer 1941: PL 132:3, 7, 10; Piccirillo and Alliata 1994: 299: No. 29). 7.

The decoration on the front of the post is identical to that of fragment No. 8. The back was left unworked and the sides are slotted. The excavators reconstructed these posts, inserting between them chancel screen panels decorated with shells surrounded by wreaths (Fig. 1.12). Since such panels were discovered with post fragment No. 8 in Area XV (see above, Type 1, Nos. 1-2), it is conceivable that they belonged to the chapel in the monastery or to a church located somewhere in its vicinity. 10. Fragment of the lower part of a marble post (25 cm high, 19.5 cm wide, 19.5 cm thick). The front is decorated with a double rectangular border. The area within the border is decorated with a floral or geometric pattern that is not easily identified, since only a small part of it was preserved. It would appear that the post was deliberately cut for secondary use. The right side of the post is slotted and its other original sides are not preserved. 11. Fragment of a marble chancel screen post (42 cm high, 23 cm wide, 19.5 cm thick). The front is decorated with a rectangular border, with a row of acanthus leaves within it. The bottom of each leaf is hidden by the upper edge of the leaf below. Posts with similar decoration were found at Bethany, Oboda and Mount Nebo (Sailer 1957: PI. 78:1; Negev 1988: No. 145; Sailer 1941: PI. 132:3). The other sides of the post are not completely preserved. SUMMARY The large quantity and impressive variety of the decorations of the chancel screen panels and posts discovered in the Temple Mount excavations, of which only a selection is presented here, provide evidence that there were several churches in the area to the south of the Temple Mount. Besides the chapel in the structure that was identified as a monastery in Area XV, we know from the historical sources of only one other church in the vicinity. A church whose identification is disputed appears on the Madaba Map in the southeastern corner of the city. This is usually identified with the church that stood in the southeastern corner of the Temple Mount and was dedicated to James, the brother of Christ, who according to the Christian tradition was martyred here (Avi-Yonah 1996: 48). However, some scholars contend that there were no churches on the Temple Mount during the Byzantine period 150</page><page sequence="157">CHANCEL SCREEN PANELS AND POSTS FROM THE TEMPLE MOUNT EXCAVATIONS and that the church should therefore be located east of the Tyropoeon Valley or south of the Temple Mount (Tsafrir 1996: 73). Judging from the quantity of chancel screens, it would appear that there were several churches in the area. This assumption is further reinforced by the discovery of large columns (one decorated with a cross), Byzantine Corinthian capitals and a fragment of a monumental stone lintel decorated with a cross within a wreath and the Greek letters alpha and omega (Photo 1.126). The lintel was found incorpo- rated into the outer, eastern wall of the large Umayyad Building II, over which the Turkish city- wall was built. One may suggest that there was a church in Area XI and perhaps another in the northern part of Area XII, immediately to the south, where some of the chancel screens and the monumental lintel were found. In these areas, situated west of the Triple Gate and adjacent to the southern wall of the Temple Mount, the bedrock is at a very high level. Since the Umayyad construction Photo 1.126. A monumental stone lintel in secondary use in an Umayyad wall. occupying the entire area made massive use of earlier remains (including unmistakable Byzantine architectural elements), nothing of the churches remained in situ.

Stiebel THE CONTEXT The year 614 CE saw the capture of Jerusalem by the Persian army that swept through Palestine.1 The historical sources present two versions of this event. According to the first, the city surrendered to the Persians, an act followed by a Christian uprising that was harshly crushed by the conquerors. The second version mentions only a refusal to surrender and a successful Persian siege of the city. In any case, the city suffered from an aggressive occupation that left its mark on the large Byzantine structure in Area XV, which has been identified as a monastery. In two of the rooms of the structure, a large number of metal fragments were uncovered, amongst which is a group of weapons (Photo 1. 127). The rarity of military artifacts from this period in the Near East invests this assemblage with special interest. THE ARTIFACTS Umbo (PL 1.27:1) A well-preserved iron boss (umbo) was found above the stone-paved floor of Room 15007 (see below). The object consists of a hemispherical bowl with a narrow annular flange. Quite remarkably, the boss still retains its gripping apparatus. In profile the bowl has short, almost vertical edges, which curve into a subconical dome. Eight dome-headed iron Photo 1.127. Arms of the Byzantine period. 153</page><page sequence="160">Pl. 1.27. Arms from the large Byzantine structure in Area XV. CHAPTER ELEVEN 1 3 5 4 2 154</page><page sequence="161">ARMS FROM AREA XV studs, spaced symmetrically about the flange, fixed the boss to the shield board. Seven studs are preserved, as observed by X-ray examination, while the eighth is represented merely by a fixing hole. One stud that has survived to its entire length is square in section. It was riveted through the boss and the board and then bent over to secure the attachment. The space between the bent shank and the boss's inner face indicates that the board was 4 mm thick at this point. The circular outline of the boss suggests that it was set in the center of a round shield, as was common in the Roman period. Oval bucklers, however, appear to have been the preferred shape during the Late Roman and Byzantine periods.2 For the latter we possess mainly pictorial evidence, such as mosaic floors,3 ivory diptychs,4 manuscripts5 and silver artifacts,6 depicting oval shields. The gripping device is of special interest, due to its excellent state of preservation. Made of an iron strip whose central part was designed to serve as a grip, this rare apparatus actually served a dual function. The iron strip stretched across the shield beyond the boss's margins, reinforcing the shield's structure. On each side of the inner bowl's perimeter, the strip widens in a circular form to hold the heads of two studs that attached it to the board. The extension of the strip beyond the two studs is unfortunately damaged at both ends, making estimation of the original length difficult. The primary purpose of the device, however, was to serve as a grip for the shield. The central element of the iron strip was bent inward, forming two alae with a U-shaped section which enabled comfortable gripping. Parallels have been found in Carnuntum,7 Strasbourg8 and Dura-Europos.9 The bowl of the boss conveniently contained the carrier's hand and simultaneously protected it. The fact that the grip is not placed along the boss's diameter allows us to determine its orientation. The grip divides the inner bowl asymmetrically into sections 45 mm and 25 mm high. As the holder's fingers and wrist were placed in the larger space while the thumb required less room, it is clear that the larger inner cavity was at the top. This asymmetry corresponds with the assemblage of shield boards unearthed at Dura-Europos (275 CE), in the center of which two holes were cut.10 A wooden strip divides a large upper semicircular hole from a smaller trapezoid hole. The striking match between the structure of the gripping device and the cut pattern of the shields from Dura indicates that similar boards were probably still in use in the early seventh century. Supporting evidence may be found in the grip of the boss from Jerusalem, whose structure would accommodate the dividing wooden strip. The boss and the grip are evidently two separate items, as they were not fixed to each other. Observing the inner face of the boss, one may note that the two studs pierce only the iron strip, as one of the stud's shanks is clearly bent over it. The comparison with the boards from Dura furnishes us with a better understanding of the grip's design. The extensions of the grip seemingly provide not only a comfortable grasp but also an additional means of attachment. These alae , when bent over the above- mentioned wooden dividing strip, would have had a strengthening effect on the center of the shield board. Close examination of the artifact's inner face reveals some oxidized organic remains, which cluster mainly near the two attachment points of the grip and boss. These patches are the remains of the wooden shield board to which the umbo was affixed. When the wooden board decayed, the iron gripping and enforcing device landed on the bowl in its Pl. 1.27.

This may explain the slight distortion of the grip, which is located a little off- center. Otherwise, we have every reason to believe that it reflects the original position. Before discussion of the umbo , it is important to dedicate a few words to the stratigraphy of Locus 15007. The tag attached to the umbo specified that it was found "above the floor" (i.e. the Byzantine floor of Room 15007), a term reserved by the excavators for material found immediately above a floor. Consequently, though early intrusive material, mostly ceramic in nature, was indeed unearthed in the locus, it seems likely that the context of the umbo is Byzantine. This information is of importance in the analysis of the umbo. As it bears a remarkable resemblance to Roman bosses, two options are conceivable: either it manifests a continuing tradition from Roman times until deep into the Byzantine period or it is indeed an intrusive Roman item. The almost complete lack of umbones in the Byzantine repertoire of weapons in the East makes it hard to be decisive. A group of arms found in a shop (armory?) in the Mamilla quarter in Jerusalem is dated to the Late Byzantine/Early Arab period.11 It contains six swords in addition to five12 umbones and two spearheads. The umbones found in Mamilla were similarly deposited during the destruction of 614 CE, but are utterly different in shape. If we accept the notion that the umbo under discussion is not intrusive, then there is an interesting variability in the arms present in Byzantine Jerusalem. The diversity between the finds from Mamilla and those under discussion, both deposited in 614 CE, is also exhibited with regard to the sword (see below). This diversity may indicate a non-centralized production process in the seventh-century East.13 In any event, the excavations have enriched us with a fine example of a shield boss with a rarely preserved gripping device. Dimensions : diameter of flange 173 mm; diameter of bowl 120 mm; height of umbo 70 mm; thickness of flange 3-4 mm; length of shank of stud 45 mm; diameter of studs' heads 13-17 mm; width of grip 42 mm; width of strip 7-14 mm; thickness of strip 6 mm. Weight : 761.30 g. Sword (PL 1.27:2) A large number of oxidized scraps of ferrous metal were unearthed in Storeroom 15006, above its mosaic floor. Though most are unidentified, a fragment of an edged weapon stands out. The fragment comprises the entire tang and part of a sword's blade, with an additional fragment of the blade. The tang is of a unique and irregular shape, comprising a straight bar of rectangular section that widens gradually to evolve into strongly waisted shoulders. Between the shoulders, a triangular area is raised. From the shoulders emerges a flat blade with parallel edges, rectangular in cross-section. The blade surface has suffered much from oxidation, resulting in the thinning of the blade since its deposition. No trace of a handle assembly has survived. Its dimensions and weight indicate that the sword belongs to a longsword type, the spatha. Only a few swords are reported from the Late Roman-Byzantine Eastern Mediterranean. Longswords are reported from Late Roman contexts at Dor,14 Khisflne,15 Dura-Europos16 and Nawa.17 Iron longswords from the Byzantine period were documented at Sardis18 and Shiqmona.19 However, the most notable find is the hoard of weapons from Mamilla in Jerusalem,20 which includes six longswords. Traces of wooden handles and scabbards have been preserved on the swords. As the details of the Mamilla swords are sadly meager, one may compare only their outlines with this blade. The swords differ in shape, particularly the tang. As asserted above, such distinctions may exhibit the variability of the arms of late Byzantine times. The peculiar shape of the tang may be paralleled with the grip of a sword depicted on a fifth-century ivory diptych of one Stilicho.21 Though they have the same contours, it must be stressed that the latter depicts a complete grip rather than just a tang. Dimensions : overall length 260 mm; length of tang 145 mm; width of tang 19-38 mm; thickness of tang 6-7 mm; width of blade 52 mm (at shoulders) to 58 mm; thickness of blade 9 mm. Weight : 410.37 g. Dimensions of blade fragment : length 125 mm; width 59.5 mm; thickness 4.5-9 mm. Scabbard locket plate? (Pl. 1.27:3) Amongst the iron debris associated with the sword, a rectangular hoop was found in Storeroom 15006. Coated with corrosion, the artifact is constructed from a thin strip of iron, part of which is now lost. One face is rounded, while the opposite face is straight. Judging by its shape and dimensions and the fact it was associated directly with the sword, one may suggest that the object is a scabbard locket plate, which reinforced the uppermost part of the scabbard. 156</page><page sequence="163">ARMS FROM AREA XV Dimensions : length 79 mm; width 33 mm; height 25 mm; thickness 3 mm. Weight : 62.35 g. Pickaxe (PL 1.27:4) The finds from Storeroom 15006 included an iron pickaxe with a vertical blade and an opposing tine. Its socket retains the carbonized fragments of the tool's wooden haft. Similar items were recorded in the hoard from KÃ¼nzing in Germany (third century CE).22 The inclusion of the pickaxe in the soldier's gear is a long tradition.23 In the Roman period the tool was used both in battle and for non-fighting activities.24 The fact that it has been similarly utilized in modern armies make it likely that this was the case during the Byzantine period too. Josephus Flavius, in his account of the Bellum Judaicum , itemized the equipment carried by the Roman legionary.25 Among this appear "both mattock and axe", which presumably designates the Roman dolabra.26 The pickaxe has not been overlooked in several lists of military equipment throughout history. Hence, Vegetius refers to pickaxes in his late fourth to mid-fifth-century Epitome.11 In the Byzantine period we learn that each unit of 16 soldiers had two pickaxes.28 The direct association of the article with the sword hints at military use. However, such tools were in civilian use throughout the Roman and Byzantine periods. Dimensions : length 266 mm; length of blade 51 mm; height of socket 26 mm; diameter of socket 39 mm. Weight : 460.87 g. Dagger? (Pl. 1.27:5) An elongated single-edged backed iron blade was unearthed in Storeroom 15006. The blade is coated with heavy corrosion products and the part next to its haft is missing. Numerous storage jars found in the room still contained food products. This, in addition to the other definite evidence for the existence of a kitchen in the complex to which the room belongs, suggests that it functioned as a storeroom. This may provide a plausible context for a domestic employment of the blade. Indeed, at first glance, its profile resembles the two choppers from the Cave of Letters (132-135 CE),29 though the choppers' blades are much broader than the blade from Jerusalem. Interest- ingly, Yadin wrote that "in time of need" these blades "could also have been used as weapons".30 Nevertheless, the length of the blade and its tapering tip, which is very suitable for stabbing, may support its identification as a dagger. Dimensions', length (damaged) 195 mm; width of blade 53 mm; maximum thickness of blade 60 mm. Weight (damaged): 139.73 g. CONCLUSIONS The military identification of the pickaxe, and even more so that of the small blade (dagger?), are questionable, as either can be associated with civilian activities. However, the assemblage discussed here appears to contain well-dated items of clear military association. The importance of these arms, namely the boss and the longsword, is emphasized by the scarcity of similar finds in Byzantine times. The identity of the warriors who used these arms is somewhat obscure. The above-mentioned resemblance of some of the arms to the Late Roman arsenal seems to suggest a Byzantine identity. The rarity of arms from that period may explain the diversity described above, unless some were of Persian origin. The latter notion is less plausible, as one may trace a line of continuity from the Late Roman period onwards. Be that as it may, the finds from the Temple Mount, taken as an assemblage, portray a unique and to date unparalleled example of seventh-century panoply.

MIENIS* During the excavation of the large Byzantine structure in Area XV, a large shell (Photo 1. 128) was found in the collapse on the floor of Room 15058. The shell is 104.3 mm high and 71.6 mm wide. It is damaged at the top and the entire bodywhorl is also lacking. This specimen, a Triton shell, clearly belongs to a complex of closely related forms of Charonia. Charonia tritonis (Linnaeus 1758) occurs in the waters of the Red Sea, while the subspecies Charonia tritonis variegata (Lamarck 1816) inhabits the Mediterranean Sea (Beu 1970). The specimen found in the Byzantine building undoubtedly belongs to the Mediterranean form. According to the width of the intact penultimate whorl, it is even more referable to the forma seguenzae (Aradas and Benoit 1870), a diminutive form occurring in the Eastern Mediterranean. Along the coast of Israel it is found today rather infrequently in the infralittoral zone at depths of 3-15 m, especially in the north of Israel (Barash and Danin 1992), but also as far south as off Palmahim (Mienis, unpublished). During historic times it was probably a much more common species, judging from the frequent occurrence of Triton shells at archaeological sites. Today it is considered an endangered species and protected throughout the Mediterranean Sea (Russo et al. 1990). Throughout the history of mankind Triton shells have been used intensively as trumpets (Astrom 1990; Reese 1990). One has only to cut of the top of * Curator National Mollusc Collection, Institute of Life Sciences, Hebrew University of Jerusalem. the shell or to make a hole in one of the early whorls in order to transform the shell into a trumpet. However, although the excavated shell has a broken top, it cannot be considered a trumpet, because the hole is filled by a natural plug. This damage was most probably caused when the animal was still alive and able to repair the damage to the shell. Triton shells have also been used as containers and as votive or symbolic objects (even in the form of models made of alabaster or terracotta) in sanctuaries (Reese 1990). The shell from the Byzantine building more likely fits in one of the latter categories. Photo 1.128. Triton shell (Locus 15058, Reg.

This area was excavated primarily in 1971 and intermit- tently in the years thereafter, especially 1972 and 1973. The dominant structure here is the large Umayyad Building III, whose northeastern corner extends over Area VI. Its deep foundations were set into a massive landfill intended to level a very large area up to the height of Building Ill's floor. The construction of these foundations is primarily responsible for the preservation of architectural remains from earlier periods, which were almost completely covered up by the deep fill (Ben-Dov 1973; Baruch and Reich 1999). However, the foundations were sunk into the midst of the early buildings, thus disturbing their archaeological contexts and introducing intrusive finds. This was the situation in Area VI in the Byzantine building that we refer to as the "House of the Menorot" (see below). The building itself was preserved to a height of two stories due to the later fill that supported it, nonetheless, no floors were preserved and no finds in situ were revealed in any of the excavated rooms. However, in the eastern part of the courtyard and the rooms adjacent to it on the east and northeast the excavation did not reach the floor level, and thus floors may still be revealed here. Likewise, it was not possible to isolate intrusive finds on stratigraphie grounds. Due to the chronological continuity between the end of use of the building and the construction of the Umayyad Building III above it, the finds could be related to either phase. 1. Introduction From 1971 to 1973, a courtyard house of the Byzantine period was exposed in Area VI. It was situated twenty meters southwest of the south- western corner of the Temple Mount's enclosure (Plans II. 1-2, Photo II. 1). This building is of particular interest because of the four painted seven- branched menorot (candelabra) found within it, which are indicative of the structure's Jewish character. Thus, the structure is referred to in this publication as the "House of the Menorot". We suggest that this structure fulfilled a public function, most likely that of a synagogue, which was established in the Jewish quarter of the city at the beginning of Muslim rule during the second quarter of the seventh century CE. Photo II. 1. The "House of the Menorot", looking north towards Robinson's Arch in the Western Wall. 163</page><page sequence="169">CHAPTER THIRTEEN Plan II.l. Ground plan of the "House of the Menorot" and the street to the north. 2. Plan of the building The plan of the building is that of a typical Byzantine courtyard house consisting of a central courtyard surrounded by rooms (Hirschfeld 1995: 62-63). Earlier structural remains dating from the Herodian and Roman periods are incorporated in the building. Since the western end of the "House of the Menorot" was not entirely excavated, the complete plan of the building remains unknown. The eastern portion of the building was only partially excavated; the excavation in the eastern part of the central courtyard did not reach the floor level and the rooms to the east and northeast were not excavated at all. Two arched openings in the courtyard's eastern wall were originally part of an earlier structure, apparently of the Roman period. The southern half of the northern arched opening was blocked when the "House of the Menorot" was built, whereas its northern half remained open and served as either a window or an entrance to the room. This question will be clarified only when this part of the building is excavated. It may be assumed that the entrance to the central courtyard was from the east via the southern arch. It seems likely that, like the northern arch, the southern arch was half blocked and its 164</page><page sequence="170">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY OF THE "HOUSE OF THE MENOROT" Plan II.2.

This assumption too can only be verified when the area is fully excavated. The building's central courtyard (6056) measured 5.7x6.7 m. Two small rooms (Loci 6054 and 6999) located north of the courtyard were each 3.20 m square. Two additional rooms were located to its west. The northern room (6028 lower) was rectangular and measured 3.00x4.80 m; the southern room (6030) was 3.20 m wide and its length is unknown, since the western side of the room was never fully excavated. Both rooms were accessed from the central courtyard via entrances, each with jambs that have two different widths to enable the fitting of a door. The entrance to the room northeast of the courtyard (6999) was not completely excavated. The entrances to all the other rooms were fully excavated, revealing in each case a recess, probably for a mezuzah, hewn into the base of the upper third of the right-hand doorjamb. The entrances to the building's rooms from the central courtyard had a square window above the doorway. Though windows above doorways do not appear in any other buildings of the Byzantine period in the Temple Mount excavations, they are a common phenomenon in Byzantine architecture (see, for example, the residential dwellings at Umm el-Jimal; Hirschfeld 1995: 46). It can be assumed that this system was used in the "House of the Menorot" because most of the ground-floor rooms lacked other windows; when the doors were closed these windows were the rooms' sole source of light and air. The part of the building that was excavated had an upper story, of which all of the walls were partially preserved. From these remains it is possible to reconstruct a room larger than the others (6028 upper), which measured 4.80x6.50 m. The western wall of the large room, W. 614, was preserved to its full height and leaned slightly to the east, probably as a result of the severe earthquake that occurred in 747/8 CE (B. Mazar 1969: 20). The floor of the large room was probably supported by the western wall (W. 634) of the smaller room situated below, on the ground floor (Room 6028 lower). A niche, 70 cm wide, was preserved in the large room's southern wall (W. 620). It was located about a meter from the southeastern corner and 80 cm above the level of the floor. This niche was adorned on one side, and probably on the other, with a painted seven- branched menorah. The entrance to the ground floor of the building was probably from the east, via the central courtyard. An additional entrance into the building was from the street that ran parallel to the northern wall of the building. The street was higher than the level of the ground floor of the "House of the Menorot", enabling direct access to the large room on the upper floor. The fill beneath the street covered the northern facade of the building to the entire height of the ground floor. Only one stone of the doorjamb of the northern entrance leading into the large room was discovered in situ and recorded at the time of the excavation. A lintel decorated with two painted seven-branched menorot, which was found in the destruction debris, probably belonged to the entrance to this room. 3. Architectural characteristics The building's walls were constructed using two different techniques. Most of the ground- floor walls were built from roughly dressed medium-sized stones with smaller stones packed between them. In contrast, most of the second-floor walls were built from well-hewn medium-sized square stones, closely fitted into place, on the side facing the courtyard. Some of the walls in the structure's rooms (e.g. W. 618) were covered with a thick layer of plaster containing many small stones. The entrances to the rooms of the building were constructed from well-hewn stones carefully set in place. A horizontal row of round holes in the upper portions of the walls, clearly visible in the field even today, attests to the fact that the ceilings were supported by wooden beams anchored in the walls. The excavators mentioned in their field diaries the large number of mosaic tesserae found in the collapse of the large room (6028 lower). The consid- erable number of square and triangular bricks found in the collapse of other rooms of the "House of the Menorot" probably served as flooring (see Chapter 16). Also noted in the field diaries are the numerous fragments of roof tiles found in the destruction collapse. Accordingly, it should be assumed the building was at least partially covered by a tiled roof. 4. Central courtyard (Locus 6056) The building's central courtyard (Photos II.2-5) measured 5.70x6.50 m. Its northern and western walls were preserved to the entire height of the ground floor and several courses of the upper story. The courtyard's southern and eastern walls were 166</page><page sequence="172">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY OF THE "HOUSE OF THE MENOROT" damaged by the construction of the foundations of the large Umayyad Building III. The western wall, W. 618, was 5.40 m long, 75 cm wide and preserved to a maximum height of 5.90 m. At the northern end of the wall, next to W. 631, was a doorway leading into Room 6028 (lower) with a square window above it (see the description of Room 6028 lower). The entrance to Room 6030 (lower) was 2.30 m south of the doorway. Only the lower portion of this segment of the wall was preserved, but the excavators reconstructed a window above the doorway similar to the one to the north of it. A step cut into the bedrock, 80 cm wide by 15 cm deep, led from the courtyard up into the doorway. In the northern part of the wall, above the square window, there is a horizontal row of round holes, 10 cm in diameter and spaced at intervals of 10 cm. These holes apparently served as anchor points for the wooden beams supporting a gallery that ran around the courtyard's walls. The northern wall, W. 631, was 6.65 m long and 0.75 m wide. The upper portion of this wall's eastern end was destroyed and its lower courses were not entirely exposed. A doorway leading into Room 6054 (lower) was situated 1.15m from the western end of the wall. A doorway in the eastern part of the wall, which was not fully excavated, led into Room 6999. The courtyard's eastern wall, W. 699, 65 cm wide and preserved to a length of 3.30 m, continued northwards and served as the eastern wall of Room 6999. It was probably a wall from an earlier construction dating from the Roman or Herodian period. Two arched openings, both 3.00 m wide, were visible in W. 699. The northern half of the northern arched opening was blocked; its southern half apparently served as a window, though this is uncertain since excavation of the courtyard was not completed. Only the northern part of the southern arched opening was preserved, and we assume that it served as an entrance into the courtyard; the completion of excavation here would also answer this question. The southern wall, W. 698, was the most severely damaged of the courtyard's walls and only 85 cm of its western end were exposed. There was probably an additional row of rooms belonging to the building, which has yet to be exposed, on the southern side of W. 698. The courtyard walls on the ground floor were built from roughly dressed medium-sized stones with Photo II.2.

The second-story construction differs markedly, consisting of well-hewn medium-sized stones carefully fitted together.

The courtyard's eastern wall, W. 699, was constructed entirely from small and medium- sized fieldstones, with the exception of the two arches, which were built from well-hewn medium- sized stones closely fitted together. The walls were plastered. Photo II. 5. The northern arched opening in W. 699, looking west. 168</page><page sequence="174">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY OF THE "HOUSE OF THE MENOROT" PL ILI.

IAA No. 1 989- 1 62 1 The courtyard was not excavated as a discrete entity separate from the intrusive foundation trenches of the Umayyad Building III. According to the excavators' field notes, the courtyard's floor level was not preserved and the roof tiles and bricks dispersed throughout the courtyard down to bedrock attested to its disturbed state. The western part of the courtyard was excavated down to bedrock, while the eastern part was not excavated. In the resulting balk traces of the Umayyad building's foundations, which extend down to bedrock, can be discerned. In the western part of the courtyard, the bedrock was exposed at an elevation of 713.28 m; it should be noted that the level of the bedrock in the courtyard was not uniform and deep cavities are discernible in the field photographs. Pottery A few sherds of Herodian pottery were found in the lower levels of the locus. In the upper levels, two fragments of glazed Islamic pottery were found. The overwhelming majority of the ceramic assemblage recovered from the locus dates from the end of the Byzantine period. Three complete vessels were found in the locus. A small bowl with a simple inverted rim, curving sides and a low ring base (PL II. 1 : 1) relates to Magness's "FBW Bowls Form IB", dated by her from the mid-sixth to early eighth centuries CE (Magness 1993: 193-195). A krater with an arched rim, straight sides decorated with a combed design of wavy and horizontal lines and a flat base (PL 11.1:2) relates to Magness's "Arched Rim Basins Form 2 A", dated by her from the sixth to the early eighth centuries CE (Magness 1993: 206-207). The third vessel is a jug with a simple everted rim and a loop handle that descends from the rim to the body (PL II. 1 :3). The jug has no neck and the body is cylindrical, with ribbing over its entire height and incised diagonal lines on the shoulder. It has a disk base. This is actually a composite of two jug types: the disk base and incised decoration are characteristic of the jugs and juglets belonging to Magness's "FBW Jugs and Juglets Form 2A" (Magness 1993: 239-240), and the slightly biconical cylindrical body without a neck is typical of Magness's "FBW Jugs and Juglets Form 2B" (Magness 1993: 241). Both types are contemporary and date from the mid-sixth to early eighth centuries CE (other jugs of this type were found in the large Byzantine structure in Area XV; see Chapter 2, PL 169</page><page sequence="175">CHAPTER THIRTEEN I.16:29). Variants of this jug, slightly narrower and lacking the incised decoration, were found at the monastery of Martyrius, destroyed in 614 CE (Magen 1993: 40). Also of interest is a fragment of a lamp decorated with fish that dates from the early eighth century CE (see Chapter 14, PL 11.4:10). A large candlestick lamp (Chapter 14, PL 11.4:5) was also found in the locus. Other finds Scores of bricks stamped with Greek names were found in the locus (see Chapter 16, PL 11.6:3, 5). It seems most likely that they were used for flooring, though the excavators did not record the elevation at which the bricks were found and we do not know their exact provenance within the locus. Typical Byzantine roof tiles were found at various levels in the locus. These include nine convex tiles stamped with a plain circle, one stamped with two adjacent circles, four stamped with a simple cross and one with a stylized cross (Photo II. 6). Dozens of copper alloy holders for glass lamps were found in the locus in two large concentrations, one at elevation 715.80 m (30 holders) and the other at 717.40 m (20 holders) (see Chapter 15, Photo II.37, PL 11.5:16-17). In addition, numerous examples of two types of glass lamps were found at various levels in the locus. One type is a bowl- shaped lamp with a long, narrow stem which fits into a copper alloy holder (Chapter 15, Photo 11.36, PL 11.5:7, 9, 11-13). This type was found in two main concentrations, at elevation 713.30 m (seven lamps) and at 7 1 7.20 m (33 lamps). The second type of lamp is a suspended bowl-shaped lamp with three handles Photo II. 6. Roof tile stamped with a stylized cross (Locus 6056, Reg. No. 999-2; scale 1:2). Photo II. 7. Copper alloy pins for fastening marble slabs (top: Locus 6028, Reg. No. 6028/03; bottom: Locus 6056, Reg. No. 6056/03; length 12 cm). and a vertical tube at its center (Chapter 15, Photo 11.35, Pl. II. 5: 1-5). The locus yielded 28 handles and 10 tubes belonging to this type of lamp, mostly at elevation 7 1 7.20 m. A copper alloy pin for fastening marble slabs (Photo II. 7) and dozens of coins from the end of the Byzantine period were also found in the locus. Among the later coins found are some dating from the reign of Tiberius Maurice (582-602 CE) and one dating from the reign of Constans II (641-668 CE). A fais of Al-Zahir Ghyath Al-Din Ghazi (1186-1216 CE; IAA 41356) is considered intrusive. 5. Room (Locus 6030 lower and upper) This locus is a room located west of the courtyard (Photos II. 8-11). A number of courses of the upper story's walls were preserved in the east and north. The western part of the room was only partially excavated; consequently, it is impossible to establish the dimensions of the room and the nature of the walls in that direction. The walls of the room were built from partially hewn stones with smaller stones filling the spaces between them. The entrance into the room was constructed from well-hewn, large rectangular stones fitted together. The walls were plastered. The eastern wall is W. 618. A doorway leading from the courtyard into Room 6030 via one step hewn in the courtyard's bedrock was located in the middle of W. 618. The doorway was 80 cm wide on the courtyard side and 90 cm wide on the room side. The threshold was cut into the bedrock at two levels, the outer one at 713.81 m and the inner one at 713.78 m. The inner threshold was rectangular, measuring 1.27 by 0.85 m, and extended into the room. A square door socket was cut into the southeastern corner of the wider part of the threshold. The entrance was preserved to a height of 1 .73 m above the threshold. At the base of 170</page><page sequence="176">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY OF THE "HOUSE OF THE MENOROT" Photo II.8. The eastern wall and entrance into Room 6030, looking east. the upper third of the northern doorjamb was an 8- cm long recess cut into the stone, presumably for a mezuzah. Wide notches cut into the inside of the southern doorjamb apparently served for locking the door. The excavators reconstructed a square window above the doorway similar to the window that was preserved above the entrance to Room 6028 (lower). Only 1.90 m of the eastern end of the southern wall (W. 638) were preserved; most of the upper wall was destroyed by the Umayyad construction activity and the lower part was not completely exposed during the excavations. The northern wall, 0.75 m wide, was preserved to a length of 2.00 m and stood to a height of 5.03 m above the level of the bedrock. Only the eastern part of the wall was preserved, whereas its western part was completely destroyed. The wall was built atop a stepped pool that was probably a ritual bath (miqveh) dating from the Herodian period. The room's floor was not preserved and there are intrusions of potsherds and glass of the Islamic period down to the level of the bedrock. In the eastern part of the room the bedrock was leveled to elevation 714.03 m. Portions of a mosaic floor with layers of gray plaster were found half a meter above the level of the bedrock, in the room's northeastern corner and further to the west in the center of the room. Roof tiles placed one above the other, some of which had small stones adhering to them, were found at the same level as the mosaic floor. It seems very likely that the fragments of the mosaic floor were originally part of the upper story floor and the tiles were part of the roof above it. Pottery Late Byzantine sherds were the predominant finds in the locus, though it should be pointed out that some Herodian pottery was found there, as well as a number of glazed Islamic pottery sherds. Finds The shoulder of a jug inscribed in black paint (Fig. II. 1) was found in the locus. The inscription is Photo II.9.

An iron key (Photo 11.12) was also found here, as well as fourteen coins, the latest of which dates from the reign of Justinian I (534-539 CE).

Room (Locus 6028 lower and upper) Room 6028 (lower) was a rectangular room measuring 4.80x3.00 m (Photos 11.13-22, Figs. II. 2-6). The earlier part of the northern wall, W. 633, was built from well-hewn, large rectangular stones that were fitted into place. The other walls in the room were built in typical Byzantine fashion using roughly dressed medium-sized and small stones with many smaller stones filling the spaces between them. The doorposts, however, were built from well- hewn large stones carefully fitted into place. The western wall of the room, W. 634, was not exactly perpendicular to W. 633 and W. 620. This wall was built from fieldstones of various sizes, which in part were fitted to the hewn bedrock in a manner that suggests that the wall predates the Byzantine construction. The eastern wall, W. 618, was preserved to the full height of the ground floor and most of the upper story. At the southern end of the wall was a completely preserved entrance, 80 cm wide on the outside and one meter wide on the inside. The threshold was cut into the bedrock at elevation 713.85 m. Adoor socket was hewn into the northeastern corner of the wider part of the threshold. At the base of the upper third of the northern doorpost was an 8-cm long recess for a mezuzah. Recesses were cut into the northern side of the doorway to facilitate the closing of the door. The lintel, probably made from a wooden beam that was not preserved, was 1.95 m above the threshold. Above the lintel was a square window that measured 80 cmx85 cm. The eastern end of the room's southern wall, W. 620, was preserved to the full height of the ground floor and included several courses of the upper story.

The western portion of W. 620 was destroyed (see Room 6030). In the west, the lower courses of W. 634 were preserved to elevation 715.33 m. The wall was 4.80 m long and 82 cm wide and was built on the bedrock. The lower portion of the room's northern wall, W. 633, was part of an earlier wall, probably of the Herodian period. It was 2.80 m long and of unknown width. Only the lower part of the wall was preserved, to an elevation of 715.50 m. A one-meter wide doorway in the western part of the wall, with a threshold at elevation 714.78 m, was blocked by Byzantine construction. No floor was registered as being preserved, but one of the field photographs (Photo II. 1 8) shows the top of a storage jar that was described by the excavators as being on the floor of the room. The uneven surface of the bedrock was exposed in the Photo 11.17.

The southwestern corner of Room 6028 (lower) was built above a stepped pool that was probably a ritual bath ( miqveh ) dating from the Herodian period. At this spot the wall was completely destroyed and the excavation reached its maximum depth, to the level of the bedrock at elevation 713.70 m. Room 6028 (upper) was rectangular and measured 5.15x6.55 m. The eastern wall, W. 618, was preserved to a height of 2.53 m (719.93 m) and had a one-meter wide entrance at its southern end. The elevation of the threshold was 717.45 m. Only one course of the doorway was preserved; it was situated directly above the entrance to the room on the ground floor. The southern wall, W. 620, was preserved to elevation 719.06 m, 1.66 m above the level of the floor. Only the eastern part of the wall was preserved. The excavators described a rectangular niche 70 cm wide at a point one meter from the eastern end of the wall and 80 cm above the level of the floor. The upper part of the niche and its western side were destroyed, as was the western end of W. 620. A seven-branched menorah was painted on two stones of the plastered wall east of the niche; the plaster attests that the drawing was indeed painted onto the existing wall of the building and not on stones in secondary use. The painting was very poorly preserved when it was exposed during the excavation, and it was impossible to identify additional painted elements associated with the menorah. The excavators removed the stones, which we were unable to locate until June 1999, when 174</page><page sequence="180">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY OF THE "HOUSE OF THE MENOROT" Baruch Brandl, keeper of the State Collection of the Israel Antiquities Authority, ascertained that they are deposited in the IAA's storerooms. A plastered stone bearing an additional painted seven-branched menorah was found in the destruction debris at the base of the niche in the southern wall. To one side of the menorah were traces of red paint, which the excavators refer to in their field notes as possible signs of writing. Unfortunately, we have been unable to locate this stone. Professor Mazar assumed that it stood on the other side of the niche: "We may assume that another menorah was painted to the left of the niche, on the destroyed continuation of the wall. And indeed, a stone with a menorah painted on it, which had obviously fallen from the destroyed wall, was discovered among the debris" (B. Mazar 1986: 40). W. 614, to the west, was 5.50 m long and 95 cm wide. This wall was preserved to its full height (up to elevation 720.70 m) and leaned slightly to the east, probably as the result of a severe earthquake that occurred in the region in 748/9 CE. The wall did not collapse but remained in place, resting on an earthen fill that was probably part of the Umayyad building's massive fill. The room's northern wall was completely destroyed, apart from one stone found in situ that was identified by the excavators as part of the western doorpost of an entrance to the room from the street. This determination was based on the location of the stone and the fact that it had two different widths, typical of doorposts. W. 634 in the ground floor supported the floor of the room in the upper story. Each wall of Room 6028 (upper) was built differently. W. 6 1 8 was built from fieldstones placed haphazardly one above the other, while W. 620 was built from well-hewn, square stones closely fitted into place. The different construction techniques of these walls reinforce the assumption that some of the walls were part of a later construction phase in the building. A further argument in favor of this assumption is seen at the base of W. 618, in a spot where the plaster had fallen and a level containing a large number of fragments of typical Byzantine roof tiles was visible. The continuation of W. 618 was built above these tiles to the height of the upper story. In contrast to this, W. 6 1 4 was built in a typical Byzantine manner, like all the walls in the ground floor. The wall was built from semi-hewn, medium- sized stones, between which were smaller fieldstones. The walls were plastered. Photo 11.19.

The floor of Room 6028 (upper), together with some of the walls, collapsed into the ground floor (Room 6028 lower). Consequently, part of the collapse on the lower room's floor belongs to the room above. At elevation 7 1 8.80 m the fragments of many roof tiles were found. At elevation 715.30 m, about half a meter above the assumed floor level of the ground-floor room, many fragments of white mosaic were found. A rectangular stone lintel with a rounded back that measured 1 .20x0.30 m was found south of W. 633 at elevation 715.40 m. A Greek cross within a round frame was carved in the center of the lintel.

The juglet has an incurved rim and a protruding, thickened ridge at the base of the rim. A strap handle extends from the ridge down to the shoulder of the vessel. The neck is cylindrical. The shoulder of the vessel is at right angles to the continuation of the body, which tapers down towards the flat base. There is a resemblance between this juglet and one found at Bethany, which belongs to a group of juglets dating from the fourth-fifth to the seventh centuries CE (Sailer 1957: 313, PL 128b: 14, Fig. 58:202). A complete candlestick lamp (PL 11.4:2) was found in the locus, as well as fragments of other typical Byzantine lamps, including a lamp handle decorated with a twisted snake (PL 11.4:6) and two lamp sherds with Greek inscriptions (Photo 11.24) (see Chapter 14).

Some of the tiles have typical Byzantine stamps such as a circle, a stylized cross, combed lines or a combed crossed pattern (PI. 11.2:4). Some paving bricks were stamped with Greek names (see Chapter 16, PL 11.6:6). Other finds included a bone loom weight (Pl. 11.2:1), a fragment of a clay horse figurine (PL 11.2:2) similar to the one found in Locus 1 502 1 of Area XV, a carved ivory pin (PL 11.2:3), a flower-shaped bead made from blue glass (PL 11.2:5) and an iron pin for fastening marble slabs. Fragments of two types of glass lamps were found at various levels in the room: 16 lamps with long stems and one copper alloy holder, and 13 three-handled, suspended lamps, including three vertical tubes (see Chapter 15). Dozens of coins were found: several of the later ones date from the reign of Tiberius Maurice (582-602 CE) and one from the reign of Heraclius (613 CE). 7. Room (Locus 6054 lower and upper) Locus 6054 was a square room measuring 3.05x3. 1 5 m (Photos 11.25-27). The walls of the room were preserved to the full height of the ground floor and to almost the full height of the upper story as well. The walls of the room were built from roughly dressed small and medium-sized stones with smaller stones filling the spaces between them in the lower story, and from well-hewn, fitted stones in the upper story. The walls were coated with white plaster. The entrance to the room was located 1.10 m from the western end of the southern wall, W. 631. Its threshold was cut into the bedrock at elevation 713.54 m. The doorway was 70 cm wide on the outside and 85 cm on the inside. We assume that there was a square window above the doorway, which was not preserved. The top of the window would have reached elevation 716.30 m. Between the bottom of the window and the top of the doorway was a wooden lintel, which has not survived, at an Pl. II.2. Locus 6028.

There was a row of holes similar to those found in Loci 6056 and 6028, along the internal face of the wall at the height of the ceiling (717.65 m). The holes were 10 cm in diameter and 10 cm apart. They were intended for the wooden beams that supported the floor of the upper story, which was not preserved. In the center of the western wall, W. 618, was a square recess measuring 37^37 cm. This recess was located directly below the level of the ceiling at elevation 717.65 m and received the main wooden beam that supported the floor of the upper story; presumably there was another such recess in the wall opposite (W. 630). The lower part of the northern wall (W. 629) was the earlier wall, W. 633, which probably dates from the Herodian period and protruded about 35 cm further into the room than W. 629 above it. A row of holes for ceiling beams similar to that in W. 631 was exposed in W. 629, at elevation 717.65 m. The Umayyad foundation trench destroyed the eastern end of W. 629 as well as the northern part of the room's eastern wall, W. 630. The floor of the lower story was not preserved except for two small plastered portions, one in the northern part of the locus at elevation 713.75 m and the other in the southern part at elevation 713.54 m. The southern wall, W. 631, of the second-story room (6054 upper) was preserved to a height of only six courses and reached a maximum elevation of 719.31 m. The doorway into the room was in the center of W. 63 1 , directly above the entrance to the ground-floor room. The threshold, 90 cm wide, was at elevation 717.70 m. The western wall, W. 618, was preserved to a maximum elevation of 719.93 m. Only the lower courses of the northern wall, W. 629, were preserved; the Umayyad foundation trench, with a north-south drainage channel at its base, cut the upper courses of the wall. The eastern wall, W. 630, was preserved to a maximum elevation of 716.85 m and was completely destroyed by the foundation trench of the Umayyad building above this level. A level in W. 630 that contains a large quantity of broken roof tiles, testifying to two phases in the building's construction, is visible above the level of the ground floor ceiling at a spot where the plaster had fallen from the wall. The second-story floor did not survive and its elevation (717.70-717.65 m) has been determined based on the holes used to anchor the wooden beams. The destruction remains in the locus came from Photo 11.25. Room 6054, looking northwest. the two superimposed rooms. Although the deep foundation trench of the Umayyad building cut through the eastern side of the rooms, we assume that most of the finds belong to the original contents of the rooms.

Apart from these sherds, most of the pottery was typically Byzantine. The following items are noteworthy: a complete lamp belonging to the transitional Byzantine-Umayyad type (Chapter 14, PL 11.4:8), a small candlestick lamp (Chapter 14, PL 11.4:1), a fragment of a candlestick lamp with a Greek inscription (Fig. II. 7), a tall lamp handle decorated with a cross (Chapter 14, PL 11.4:7) and a fragment of a Roman lamp with a beetle decoration (Photo 11.28).

Other finds Many roof tiles were found in this locus, including three convex tiles, seven flat tiles with a simple cross stamped on their edges and one flat tile with a stamp of a stylized cross decorated with dots (PL 11.3:1). Dozens of fragments of bricks were also found, among them square and triangular bricks, most bearing stamps of Greek names (see Chapter 16, PL 11.6:1-2, 4). Other finds included a copper alloy scale weight decorated in repoussÃ© (PL 11.3:2), a triangular copper alloy object decorated in repoussÃ© (Pl. 11.3:6), a ring with an abraded decoration (PL 11.3:3), a plain ring (PL 11.3:4), a copper alloy earring (PL 11.3:5) and a copper alloy pin for fastening marble (PL 11.3:7). Many fragments of glass lamps were found in the locus, as well as a chain for suspending a lamp (Chapter 15, Photo 11.34, PL 11.5:6, 8, 10, 14-15). 8. Room (Locus 6999 lower and upper) Only a small number of stones remained from the walls of Room 6999 (upper). Room 6999 (lower) was square, measuring 3.00x3.28 m. The upper courses of the southern wall, W. 631, were destroyed, and the rest of the wall was not excavated. The entrance to the room was probably located in the wall. The western wall, W. 630, separates this room from Room 6054. W. 629 was the building's outer wall, separating it from the street to the north. W. 699 to the east predated the building and was probably Roman in origin. An arched doorway at the southern end of W. 699, which belongs to the earlier phase of the wall, was blocked up by later construction. Only the upper portion of the room, high above the floor level, was excavated. The walls of the room were poorly preserved. Three of them were built from roughly 180</page><page sequence="186">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY OF THE "HOUSE OF THE MENOROT" Pl. II.3. Locus 6054. No. Object Reg.

The room is assumed to have been entirely plastered based on plaster remnants discerned on W. 630. We have no finds from this room. 9. Street north of the "House of the Menorot" (Locus 6077) A street ran from east to west along the entire northern facade of the building (Photos 11.29-32). The street was at elevation 717.80 m, also the level of the floor of the building's upper story. The street was 6.30 m wide. South of the street was the building's northern wall, W. 629. The northern side of the street was bordered by W. 642, which was preserved to a height of 1.92 m above street level. The wall was built from roughly dressed medium- sized and large stones with many smaller fieldstones filling the spaces between them. This locus was not defined in the excavators' field notes as a street. However, Mazar (B. Mazar 1975: 38) refers to a street that runs along the northern side of the structure (the "House of the Menorot") and there can be no doubt that this is the locus to which he referred. Pottery Three lamps were found in this locus (see Chapter 14). Two are large candlestick lamps (PI. 11.4:3-4), one bearing a Greek inscription, and the third is a transitional Byzantine-Umayyad type (PL 11.4:9). 181</page><page sequence="187">CHAPTER THIRTEEN Photo 11.29.

Conclusions The "House of the Menorot" was partly published by Mazar (B. Mazar 1975: 38-39) and was identified by him as a public building used for a short period by the Jews who were allies of the Persian conquerors of Jerusalem in the year 614 CE. We have suggested that the building fulfilled a public function in the Jewish quarter of the city, most likely that of a synagogue, at the beginning of Islamic rule during the second quarter of the seventh century CE (E. Mazar 1998; E. Mazar and Peleg 1999) * Thg following sections discuss the finds from the "House of the Menorot" on which our suggestion is based. Stratigraphy and dating The "House of the Menorot" was preserved beneath the remains of the large Umayyad Building III, constructed at the beginning of the eighth century CE (B. Mazar 1969: 19). This structure, as well as the other large Umayyad buildings next to it, had wide foundations with wooden beams incorporated into them, the "negatives" of which are visible deep in the ruins of the "House of the Menorot". In order to provide a level surface for the floor of the Umayyad building, a massive fill was necessary. This fill rose to a substantial height and contained within it earlier structures, including the remains of the "House of the Menorot". The Umayyad Building III was constructed directly above the "House of the Menorot". There is no factual basis for Ben-Dov's claim that "there is no possibility of attributing this construction [of the "House of the Menorot" - E. M.], including the change in the symbols, to the Jewish settlement located in this place at the onset of the Muslim conquest before the beginning of the Umayyad construction. This is because there is an additional phase between the destruction of the building and the construction of the Umayyad public building" (Ben-Dov 1973: 76, 111. 3). The channel built together with the foundations of the northern wall of Building III, to which Ben-Dov points as the primary evidence for an additional phase, is actually a drainage channel belonging to the Umayyad * I wish to thank Prof. Haggai Ben-Shammai for his advice on the historical sources of the period and Prof. L. I. Levine and Dr. Zvi Uri Ma' oz for their guidance in the subject of early synagogues. building. An identical channel is visible at the same level in the foundations of the Umayyad building's eastern wall. The remains of sparse installations that were indeed found above the level of the Byzantine building may at most attest to the presence and activity of the builders of the Umayyad complex. Such poor installations have been exposed in various other excavation areas. The construction of the deep foundations of the Umayyad building and the massive amounts of fill beneath its floors were responsible for the intrusion of finds contemporary with the Umayyad building deep into the remains of the "House of the Menorot". No floors were preserved in any of the rooms excavated in the "House of the Menorot". It should be mentioned, however, that if excavation is ever renewed there is a very good chance of exposing the floor levels in the eastern half of the central courtyard and the adjacent rooms to the east and northeast. A level containing a large quantity of broken roof tiles that testifies to two phases in the building's construction is visible in W. 618, the eastern wall of Room 6028, above the level of the ground-floor ceiling, in a spot where the plaster had fallen from the wall. The upper continuation of the wall was rebuilt to the height of the upper story on top of this collapse. A similar level exists in W. 630, the eastern wall of Room 6054, north of the central courtyard. Approximately ten complete pottery vessels found in the destruction debris of the "House of the Menorot" date from the end of the Byzantine period or the beginning of the Umayyad period (the sixth and early seventh centuries CE). A lamp with a linear pattern found in Room 6054 does not appear in assemblages from the Temple Mount excavations that end with the destruction of the Byzantine settlement in 614 CE. It should be dated to the transition between the Byzantine and the Umayyad periods in the first half of the seventh century CE (Rosenthal and Sivan 1978: 137). This lamp dates the last phase of use of the "House of the Menorot" to the first half of the seventh century CE. Seven-branched menorot A red painted seven-branched menorah was discovered in situ, west of the niche in the southern wall of the large second-story room (6028 upper, Photo 11.20, Fig. II.2). Another stone decorated with a menorah was discovered in the destruction 183</page><page sequence="189">CHAPTER THIRTEEN collapse of the room (6028 lower). Professor Mazar raised the possibility that this menorah originally adorned the other side of the niche, where the wall was later destroyed (B. Mazar 1975: 38). A stone lintel bearing a carved cross and two painted seven-branched menorot was found amongst the collapse adjacent to the northern wall of the ground floor room (6028 lower, Photo 11.22, Figs. II. 4-5). Mazar assumed that the lintel belonged to the entrance in the northern wall of Room 6028 upper: "The lintel of the doorway in its northern wall, facing the street, bears a depiction in red paint of two seven-branched menoras flanking an incised cross. It is apparent that the painter of the menoras disregarded the cross, or even purposely covered it over" (B. Mazar 1975: 38). Unfortu- nately, since we have been unable to locate the lintel, we are unable to verify Mazar 's assertion that the cross in the center of the lintel was covered with plaster when the menorot were painted on it, nor do the pictures we have of the lintel provide an answer to this question. Lintels decorated with a cross in the center are well known from Byzantine sites such as Mount Nebo, Umm el-Rasas, Mampsis and Oboda (Sailer 1941: Pis. 55:2; 56; 57:1, 4, 7, 10; Piccirillo and Alliata 1994: 314, 316; Negev 1988: 94, Photo 93; 1997: 178, Photo 286). All four menorot from the "House of the Menorot" are painted in the same style in dark red paint. The branches are decorated with buttons and the tops of the branches are joined by a horizontal bar. All of the menorot have a tripod base, apart from the one found in situ in Room 6028 upper, which stands on a solid, stepped base similar to the bases of the menorot depicted in the sixth-century mosaic in the synagogue at Na'aran (Avi-Yonah 1992: 1075-1076). There were traces of red paint to the right of the drawing of the menorah found in the destruction collapse in the eastern part of the room. The excavators suggested in their notes that these were undecipherable traces of writing. Conclusions and proposed reconstruction The plan of the "House of the Menorot" is that of a typical Byzantine courtyard house. The size of the building and the carved cross on the lintel above the entrance to the building from the street imply that it functioned as a public building. The Byzantine structure was probably abandoned and damaged during the Persian conquest in the year 614 CE. A short time thereafter, the structure was rebuilt and served new tenants. This second phase is dated by the pottery vessels found in its collapse to the beginning of the Islamic period. The most important finds from this final phase are the seven-branched menorot painted on the lintel and on the southern wall of the large second-story room (6028 upper). The recesses intended for mezuzah parchments that were cut into the doorways also attest to the Jewish character of the structure. In the destruction debris of the building, fragments of about 20 suspended bowl-shaped glass lamps with three handles, 116 fragments of long- stemmed glass lamps and 86 copper alloy lamp holders were found (see Chapter 1 5). Lamps of these types are usually found in churches and synagogues. The large number of glass lamps found in the "House of the Menorot" indicates that there was a need for strong lighting within the building and strengthens the suggestion that it served as a synagogue. Together, all of these finds suggest that the "House of the Menorot" was a public building of Jewish character, probably used by Jewish settlers during the transitional phase from the Byzantine to Umayyad periods. The menorot flanking the niche in the southern wall of Room 6028 (upper) and the lintel decorated with menorot above the entrance to the room from the street both raise the possibility that this room functioned as a synagogue sanctuary (Fig. II.8). The large numbers of glass lamps that were found in the different rooms of the building were perhaps needed for Torah study in close proximity to the synagogue's sanctuary. A document from the Cairo Genizah attests to the existence of a Jewish neighborhood in the southern part of Jerusalem, next to the Temple Mount walls, at the beginning of the Early Islamic period. This document, part of an Arabic chronicle written in Hebrew script, tells of a meeting between Jews and Caliph 'Umar ibn al-Khattab (634-644 CE). At this meeting, the Caliph permitted seventy Jewish families from Tiberias to settle in Jerusalem for the first time since the Roman and the Byzantine periods, during which Jews were forbidden to reside in the city. This is how the Jewish settlement is described in the chronicle: "...And the Caliph said, 'In which part of the city do you want to reside?' And they said, 'In the south of the city, which is called the Market of the Jews,' for they wished to be 184</page><page sequence="190">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY OF THE "HOUSE OF THE MENOROT" Fig. II. 8. Proposed reconstruction of the "House of the Menorot". close to the Temple and its gates and the waters of the Siloam for the ritual bathing. And the Caliph granted them these things. Then these same seventy households with their wives and small children moved [to Jerusalem] from Tiberias and the surrounding area and built their houses from [the stones of] the buildings that were destroyed generations before them" (Gil 1983: 3). This portion of the chronicle is the only mention among the Genizah documents of the seventh- century Jewish settlement in Jerusalem. Following this, there is a gap of about three centuries in the historical sources until the middle of the tenth century CE. In light of the descriptions appearing in later sources, it seems that the Jewish quarter had remained in the south of the city until the eleventh century CE (Prawer 1947: 138-139, Gil 1992: 636). The "House of the Menorot" apparently served as a synagogue in the Jewish quarter following its establishment during the reign of Caliph 'Umar ibn al-Khattab. The construction of the large Umayyad buildings (including Building III) at the beginning of the eighth century CE required the evacuation of the structures in the Jewish quarter that occupied the area intended for the new construction, including the "House of the Menorot". 185</page><page sequence="191">CHAPTER THIRTEEN BIBLIOGRAPHY Avi-Yonah, M. 1993.

The assemblage comprises five main types: the earliest date from the end of the Byzantine period (the fifth and sixth centuries CE) and the latest from the transitional Byzantine-Early Islamic period (the seventh and early eighth centuries CE) or the Early Islamic period (the eighth to tenth centuries CE). I. SMALL CANDLESTICK LAMP One complete lamp of this type was discovered in Locus 6054 in the "House of the Menorot" (PI. II.4:1). The lamp is mold-made and ovoid in shape. It is characterized by a large filling hole surrounded by a single ridge and a pointed nozzle that constitutes a direct continuation of the body. The lamp has a small knob in lieu of a handle. A decoration in relief consisting of a radiate pattern of diagonal lines adorns the surface around the filling hole. The area between the filling hole and the wick hole is decorated with a horizontal line, the ends of which curve back in opposite directions. Lamps of this type decorated with a similar pattern were found at Bethany (Sailer 1957: Fig. 16:12-13) and at 'Ain Yabrud (Husseini 1938: PI. VII:3). The small candlestick lamp is usually dated from the second half of the fourth to the fifth centuries CE (Rosenthal and Sivan 1978: 112-113), though some researchers extend the use of these lamps to the mid-sixth century CE (Magness 1993: 250). For discussion of this type of lamp, see Chapter 3 on the Byzantine pottery lamps from Area XV. 2. LARGE CANDLESTICK LAMPS Four complete examples of this type of lamp were found in the "House of the Menorot" (PI. 11.4:2-5). The lamps are mold-made and ovoid in shape. They are characterized by a large filling hole surrounded by two or three prominent ridges, a nozzle that constitutes a direct continuation of the body and a ring base. These lamps lack handles. Two of the lamps are decorated in relief with a radiate pattern of diagonal lines around the filling hole and a palm branch/menorah pattern between the filling hole and the wick hole (PI. 11.4:2-3). In place of the handle on PI. 11.4:3 there is a decoration of a crescent flanked by two circles. The other two lamps are decorated with Greek inscriptions around the filling hole. Lamps of this type with an inscription were probably intended for Christian pilgrims that visited Jerusalem. The fact that the inscriptions on the lamps also appear on ampullae reinforces the connection between the lamps and the holy places. The most common inscription, which also appears on lamps from Area VI (PI. 11.4:4-5), is OWC XPICTOY OENI nACIN, which means: "The light of Christ shines for all". This inscription is apparently connected to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre (Magness 1996: 40-41). The large candlestick lamp is the most common lamp type of the Byzantine period and is usually dated to the fifth and sixth centuries CE (Rosenthal and Sivan 1978: 116). Some scholars, however, contend that this type of lamp was still in use in the late seventh or early eighth century CE (Magness 1993: 251). For discussion of this type of lamp, see Chapter 3. 3.

CHAPTER FOURTEEN 1 2 3 5 6 4 7 8 9 10 188</page><page sequence="194">POTTERY LAMPS FROM THE "HOUSE OF THE MENOROT" discovered in the "House of the Menorot". One handle has a round section (PI. 11.4:6) and is decorated with a snake coiled around itself and surrounded by circles. The second handle is in the shape of a cross (PL 11.4:7). In the center of the handle is a cross within a circle, and each arm of the cross-shaped handle is decorated with an X. These handles have parallels that date from the sixth and seventh centuries CE. A large number of similar lamp handles was discovered in Area XV; see the discussion in Chapter 3. 4. LAMP DECORATED WITH A LINEAR PATTERN A complete lamp of this type was discovered in the "House of the Menorot" (PL 11.4:8). The lamp is mold-made and almond-shaped. It is characterized by a straight channel that runs the length of the nozzle and connects the round filling hole with the wick hole, a knob handle and a low ring base. The entire surface of the lamp, apart from the channel, is decorated. A decoration of geometric patterns in relief surrounds the filling hole and the nozzle is decorated separately with a herringbone pattern. Similar lamps were found at Bet Shean and are dated from the sixth century through the Umayyad period (Hadad 2002: 74-78). According to Rosenthal and Sivan, this type of lamp should probably be dated to the seventh and eighth centuries CE (Rosenthal and Sivan 1978: 137). 5. EARLY CHANNEL-NOZZLE LAMPS A complete lamp of this type (PL 11.4:9) and two fragments of a lamp of the same type decorated with a unique fish pattern (Pl. II.4: 10) were discovered in Area VI. The lamps are mold-made and almond- shaped. They are characterized by a large filling hole surrounded by a ridge, a channel connecting the filling hole with the wick hole, a conical handle and a low ring base. The surface around the filling hole is decorated in relief with geometric or zoomorphic patterns. The complete lamp (PL 11.4:9) is decorated with lines and dots around the filling hole and a single cross in the center of the channel. A lamp with an almost identical decoration is in the Schioessinger collection (Rosenthal and Sivan 1978: No. 538). Similar lamps were discovered in Stratum IIA at Ramat Rahel, which was dated by the excavators to the sixth and seventh centuries CE (Aharoni 1964: 38, Figs. 10:7, 26:4), and at Bethany Pl. II.4.

The lamp in PI. 11.4:10 is decorated in relief with what were originally four fish arranged in a circle around the filling hole. A lamp with a similar fish decoration was discovered in the Early Islamic stratum of the excavations in the Ophel (Macalister and Duncan 1926: Pl. XXI: 12). Another lamp with the same decoration is in the Schioessinger collection (Rosenthal and Sivan 1978: No. 537). The early channel-nozzle lamps are dated from the seventh to the early eighth centuries CE (Magness 1993: 255). This type of lamp coexisted with a similar type characterized by an upright tongue handle that is folded forward, dated from the sixth to the eleventh centuries. It seems, however, that the type with the conical handle went out of use earlier (Rosenthal and Sivan 1978: 130-131). CONCLUSIONS In the "House of the Menorot" the floors were not preserved in the rooms exposed and the foundations of the Umayyad building penetrated down to the level of the bedrock, bringing with them later material. However, the bulk of the pottery assemblage, including the lamps, is typical of the end of the Byzantine period and the latest lamp is typical of the transitional Byzantine-Early Islamic period.

The lamps may be divided into two types: TYPE 1 This lamp type comprises a small bowl with straight sides, a tubular rim made by folding out and down and three handles (Photo 11.33, PL 11.5:1-5). Such lamps were suspended from chains attached to the handles (Photo 11.34). The only part of these lamps that was preserved was a handle and a small part of the rim, though some of the vertical tubes that were originally at the lamps' center were discovered separately. Sixty-five handles and 22 tubes were found. The lamps are made of light bluish-green and light green glass. Type 1 parallels Crowfoot's and Harden's Type C, dated to the fourth-seventh centuries CE (Crowfoot and Harden 1931: 199), Isings's Form 134, dated to the late fourth century CE through Middle Ages (Isings 1957: 162), Barag's Types 12 and 13, dated to the late Byzantine period (Barag Photo 11.33. Fragments of glass lamps of Type 1 from Locus 6056. 1970: 184), Sardis Type 2, dated about 400-616 CE (von Saldern 1980: 46-49, with extensive discussion of this type), and Uboldi's Type 1. 1 , dated to the late fourth-eighth centuries CE (Uboldi 1995: 104-108, Fig. 2:1, 5). Type 1 lamps were discovered in the excavations of the American expedition on Tel Bet Shean (Fitzgerald 1931: 42-43, PL XXXI:4), in a synagogue at Bet Shean which, according to the excavator, went up in flames at the hands of the Byzantines after they reconquered the region from the Sasanians in 624 CE (Zori 1967: 161-162, Fig. 11:9, 10), and in the excavations of the Hebrew Photo 11.34.

This lamp type was dated to the fifth-seventh centuries CE at Nessana (Harden 1962: 84, PL XX:47), to the fifth-sixth centuries CE at Samaria (Crowfoot et al. 1957: 418-419, Fig. 99:2, 3), and to the late fourth through seventh centuries CE at Mezad Tamar (Erdmann 1977: 100, PL 1:3-7). Lamps of this type were discovered at Shavei Zion, where the glass was dated to the fifth-sixth centuries CE (Barag 1967: 68-70, Fig. 16:21-22). A Type 1 lamp was also discovered at 'Ain Karim (Bagatti 1948: 77-78, Fig. 34: 1). Lamps of this type were discovered at Jerash (Baur 1938: 153, No. 4, Fig. 9:4; Kehrberg 1986: 381, Fig. 9:35-36; Meyer 1987: 212, Fig. 12:P-T), and such lamps from Mount Nebo were dated to the Byzantine period (Sailer 1941: 315-316, Pl. 140:1-17). A lamp of this type was discovered at Kellia in Egypt and dated to 450-550 CE (Egloff 1977: 174, No. 365, PL 91:6). Lamps of this type from Pella were dated to the first quarter of the eighth century CE (Smith and Day 1989: 114-115, Fig. 32, PL 60:4). Lamps with a tube were discovered in Tomb 156 at Gezer (Macalister 1912: 362-363, Fig. 189) and at Kh. Siyar el-Ghanam (Corbo 1955: 75-76, Fig. 25:5). Judging from the finds at Bet Shean, this type, which is especially common in synagogues and Photo 11.35. Fragments of glass lamps of Type 2 from Locus 6056. churches, was in use until the eleventh century and perhaps into the Mamluk period (Hadad 1998: 64, 68). TYPE 2 Lamps of this type are characterized by a smooth, hollow, wide, rectangular stem, which widens towards the top, and a small bowl (Photo 11.35, PL 11.5:6-15). A total of 116 fragments were discovered. They are made of light bluish-green and light green glass. This type corresponds to Crowfoot's and Harden's type B.2.b, dated to the fourth-seventh centuries CE (Crowfoot and Harden 1931: 198-199), Sardis Type 3, dated to about 400-616 Pl. II.5.

CE (von Saldern 1980: 49-52), and Uboldi's Type IV.2, dated to the late fifth-sixth centuries CE (Uboldi 1995: 121-124, Fig. 5:30-31). Type 2 lamps were found in the synagogue at Bet Shean (Zori 1967: 161-162, Fig. 11:5), in the excavations of the Hebrew University expedition at Bet Shean (Hadad 1998: 69-72), and at Shavei Zion (Barag 1967: 68-70, Fig. 16:25), Samaria (Crowfoot et al. 1957: 414-415, Fig. 96:6) and Nazareth (Bagatti 1969: 310-314, Fig. 237:34). Lamps discovered at Jerash were dated to the late Byzantine-early Umayyad periods (Meyer 1987: 203-206, Fig. 1 1 : J- L). Lamps of this type were discovered in the Byzantine bathhouse at Gadara (Nielsen 1993: 172-173, PI. 43:431-432). This lamp type was dated to the fourth-fifth centuries and the beginning (?) of the sixth century CE at Apamea (Pirling 1978: 145-146, Fig. 5), and to the first quarter of the eighth century CE at Pella (Smith and Day 1989: 114-115, PI. 60:10). Judging from the finds at Bet Shean, lamps of Type 2 seem to have gone out of use at the end of the Umayyad period (Hadad 1998: 72). About 86 copper alloy lamp holders of varying size were found with the glass lamps (Photos 11.36-37, Plate 11.5:16-17). These holders were attached to the walls and held lamps of Type 2. A holder of this type was found in a church at Umm al-Rasas (Piccirillo and Alliata 1994: 329, PI. 32:2). BIBLIOGRAPHY Bagatti, B. 1948. Il Santuario della Visitazione ad 'Ain Karim (Montana Judeae).

Large concentrations of bricks were found in various levels in the rooms of the complex. Four male personal names recur on the stamped bricks. 1 . EIPHNIWN (Irenion) 2. nOYnAIOY (Poupliou) 3. HPAKAOIY (Herakliou, misspelled) 4. KA (apparently the initials of a name) The largest concentration of bricks in Area VI was found in Locus 6056, which is the central courtyard of the "House of the Menorot". Considerable numbers of bricks of this type were also discovered in various loci in Area VII, especially in the loci of the Roman-Byzantine bathhouse, north of the "House of the Menorot". The impressions of Types 1-3 were made with identical stamps or possibly with the same stamp. In these types the name was divided into two rows of four letters each, one above the other. Most of the bricks are made from red clay, and a few from yellow clay that is lighter in weight. Traces of cement can be discerned on most of the bricks. 1. EIPHNIWN (Pl. 11.6:1-2) Twenty-four bricks bearing this stamp were found in the "House of the Menorot", four in Locus 6054, 16 in Locus 6056 and four in Locus 6065. Though some of the impressions are complete and legible, on others only a few letters can be identified. The impressions measure 5.00x10.50 cm. Since the size and spacing of the letters are identical on all the impressions, they were made with the same stamp or identical stamps. The impression is in a different location on each brick. Dimensions of the bricks: 22x28 cm, 3.00-3.80 cm thick. A brick of this type found in Locus 6054 is in the shape of an isosceles triangle, measuring 38.50 cm along its base and 28.50 cm along the sides (PI. 11.6:2). Another brick from the same locus was bisected down its center with a diagonal line meant to mark the division of the brick into two triangular bricks (PI. 11.6:1). 2. nOYIIAIOY (PI. 11.6:3) Thirty bricks bearing this stamp were found in the "House of the Menorot," one in Locus 6028, seven in Locus 6054, 18 in Locus 6056 and four in Locus 6065. The impressions, measuring 4.50x9.50 cm, all appear to have been made with the same stamp or identical ones, since the size and spacing of the letters are identical. The location of the impression differs between the bricks. Dimensions of the bricks: 22x23 cm, 3.00-3.80 cm thick. Pl. II.6. Byzantine bricks from Area VI. No. Locus No. Reg.

HPAKAOIY (PL 11.6:4) Two bricks bearing this stamp were found in the "House of the Menorot", one in Locus 6054 and the other in Locus 6056. The end of the name is misspelled (...OIY instead of ...IOY), a common phenomenon in stamp impressions of bricks of this period (Mango 1950: 20). Dimensions of the impressions: 4.50x9.50 cm. In both the examples found, all of the letters are legible except for the letter P. Since these bricks are no longer available for study, we were unable to measure them; the only information that we possess is derived from the excavation's field diaries. 4. KA (PL 11.6:5-6) Fifty-one bricks bearing this stamp were found in the "House of the Menorot," six in Locus 6028, six in Locus 6054, 35 in Locus 6056 and four in Locus 6065. Most of the impressions on the bricks of this type are complete and legible and measure 2.20x3.20 cm. On a small number of impressions only one of the two letters is legible. Two different stamps can be discerned from the impressions: 1) a stamp with wide, flat letters and 2) a stamp with narrow prominent letters, in which the right leg of the A is shorter than its left leg and touches the end of the stamp. In most instances, the impression on this type is placed in the center of the brick. This impression is an abbreviation of a personal name. The use of initials in brick stamps is common in the Byzantine period (Mango 1950: 20). Dimensions of the bricks: 23x23 cm, 2.60-3.00 cm thick. DISCUSSION Bricks bearing stamped Greek names were first used in the fourth century CE and their distribution reached its peak during the sixth century CE (Mango 1950: 20). The bricks found in the "House of the Menorot", which date from the end of the Byzantine period and the beginning of the Umayyad period, coincide chronologically with this period. During a visit paid to us by Frs. M. Piccirillo and E. Alliata from the Franciscan Archaeological Institute, we were told that bricks identical to ours, bearing the stamped names EIPHNIWN and nOYnAIOY, were found in the Franciscan Institute's excavations at the Dominus Flevit church on the Mount of Olives (these bricks have not yet been published). The church dates from the end of the Byzantine period and the beginning of the Umayyad period. Other than the bricks found at the Dominus Flevit church, no other local parallels to this type of Byzantine brick were found. Since the majority of bricks with stamps of Greek names were produced and found in Constantinople (Mango 1950: 22), it has been suggested that they were imported. However, pÃ©trographie examination of the bricks (see Chapter 17) revealed that the source of these bricks is in the clay member of the Motza Formation; hence they were not imported but rather were locally manufactured. The different names that appear on the bricks can probably be attributed to various workshops. Another possibility is that the bricks were made in one workshop that used a number of stamps to control output. BIBLIOGRAPHY Mango, C. A. 1950. Byzantine Brick Stamps.

Hence, despite the likelihood that the bricks were made near the place they were used, pÃ©trographie analyses were conducted on four bricks bearing the inscriptions EIPHNIWN, nOYnAIOY, HPAKAOIY and KA. RESULTS Thin sections of the sampled bricks were examined under a pÃ©trographie (polarizing) microscope. Three bricks (Reg. Nos. 6056/2, 6056/3 and 9056/1, with the inscriptions EIPHNIWN, nOYnAIOY and HPAKAOIY, respectively) are made of a fine clay mixed with Terra Rossa soil, which appears as mudballs in the matrix. The nonplastic components consist mainly of well-sorted dolomite sand particles that exhibit a typical rhomboid shape Photo 11.38. Photomicrograph of a Byzantine brick: fine dolomite sand exhibiting a rhomboid shape embedded in Motza clay. D = dolomite sand. Scale (white bar) = 0.5 mm. (Photo 11.39). The clay was most likely quarried from the clay member of the Motza Formation and the dolomite particles from the 'Aminadav Formation. These formations are exposed in the Cenomanian section of the Judean hills. The matrix of another brick (Reg. No. 6054, with the inscription KA) from the same building consists of tiny rhombohedral dolomite crystals mixed with Terra Rossa soil. This raw material is identified as the marl member of the Motza Formation, located underneath the clay member of this formation. All the bricks but 6056/3 were fired at a rather high temperature (about 1000Â°C), which decomposed the calcium carbonate and left isotropic holes. CONCLUSIONS The four Byzantine bricks were locally made in or near Jerusalem. This is in agreement with previous pÃ©trographie studies, which have shown that similar raw materials were commonly used during archaeo- logical periods for making pottery and bricks in Judean hill sites and especially in the Jerusalem area (see e.g. Arubas and Goldfus 1995: 107; Goren 1996:51-52).

Area XII lies to the east of the Turkish city- wall and Area III to its west. In 1970, the excavation of the Umayyad Building II was expanded eastwards in order to ascertain the entire plan of this structure and to expose its eastern entrance, as well as the remains beneath it. Remains of Byzantine structures were partially exposed in Areas III and XII (Plan III. 1 , Photos III. 1-3) and were described extensively in the report published in the following year (B. Mazar 1971: 34-36, Fig. 8, Pis. V-VII). Though the overall impression is that the remains belong to three private houses, we must take into account the fact that none of them was sufficiently exposed for its complete plan to be established. Moreover, because of architectural remains from later periods, the spaces between the remains of the Byzantine constructions were not excavated. Thus, we cannot reconstruct with certainty the plan of these structures. Although there is no clear connection between the units, the fact that they were built so close to one another raises the possibility that they actually constituted part of the same building, like the multi-room structure (the hospice) in Area XVII.

The central east-west passageway of the Umayyad Building II and the southern part of Area III, looking south. 1. AREA III: THE NORTHERN HOUSE 1.1. Introduction Only one entire room and the partial remains of a second room to its south were exposed in this building (Plan III.2, Photo III.4). The southern part of the building was not excavated because the central passageway of the large Umayyad Building II passes above it from east to west. The Byzantine building continues to the east beneath the Turkish city-wall constructed on the outer, eastern wall of the Umayyad Building II, and to the north beneath a large structure, attributed to the Crusader period, which adjoins the southern Temple Mount enclosure wall. The western wall of the Byzantine building is apparently W. 382; consequently, we can reconstruct only the western limit of the structure. B. Mazar referred quite extensively to the northern building in Area III in the preliminary excavation report (B. Mazar 1971: 34-36). He assumed that there was a small courtyard located east of Room 3068 from which the room was entered. He reconstructed the room on the south (3077) as a roofed courtyard that served the domestic needs of the household. 1.2. Room (Locus 3068) The room was square, measuring 4.30x4.60 m, and its walls were preserved to their entire height. The room's walls were built from roughly hewn medium-sized stones with small and medium-sized fieldstones filling the spaces between them. The doorjambs of the main entrance were made from rectangular slabs of stone that were finely dressed and fitted together into place. The walls of the room were plastered. The eastern wall (W. 384) stood to a height of nine courses (2.92 m). The wall was 3.60 m long and 80 cm wide. At the southern end of the wall 205</page><page sequence="208">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN Plan III. 2. The Byzantine structure in Area III north. Photo III.3.

The threshold (7 14.78 m) was 24 cm lower than the floor of the room. The doorway was 1.00 m wide on the inside and 84 cm wide on the outside. Recesses cut into the doorjambs were used for barring the door. A low arch was built above the entrance lintel. The eastern pilaster bearing the arch for the room's roof was 20 cm north of the doorway. The pilaster, 55 cm wide, was built as an integral part of the wall. A rectangular, funnel- shaped window measuring 1 .10x0.65 m was located 80 cm north of the pilaster and 1.68 m above the room's floor. The lower window frame sloped downwards into the room, where it joined a horizontal windowsill that served as a shelf. Nine courses of W. 391, to the south, were preserved to a maximum height of 2.93 m. The wall was 4.60 m long and 70 cm wide. In the center of the wall, 2.10 m from its western end, was a doorway that was mostly destroyed. The threshold (714.98 m) was flush with the floor of the room. A pilaster that protruded about 55 cm into the room was constructed in the eastern part of the wall, 30 cm from the doorway. Since the pilaster was not built in accordance with the square layout of the room, it may predate the Byzantine construction. Twelve courses of the western wall (W. 382) were preserved to a maximum height of 3.16 m. This wall was 4.20 m long and 75 cm wide. A built shelf, 20 cm wide, extended the entire length of the wall 1.38 m above the floor. The western pilaster of the arch that supported the roof was built into the center of the wall. A rectangular window (40x55 cm) was located 75 cm from the southern end of the wall, at a height of 2.40 m above the floor level. A finely dressed triangular stone sunshade was affixed to the outer part of the window. To the north, ten courses of W. 383 were preserved to a maximum height of 2.98 m. The wall was 4.10 m long and one meter wide. The floor of the room (715.01 m) was entirely paved with a white mosaic decorated with patterns of black, orange and red flowers (Fig. III. 1).

Mosaic patterns decorating the mosaic floor in Room 3068 in the northern house. entrance was a square geometric pattern. Another geometric pattern in the shape of a rhombus was situated next to the threshold of the southern passageway. Mazar pointed out the similarity between the decorative patterns on the mosaic floor in this room and the decoration of the mosaic floor in the "House of Eusebius" uncovered in Macalister's excavations in the Ophel (B. Mazar 1971: 35, n. 26, Pl. V). In the mosaic floor, next to the northern doorjamb of the room's entrance, was a round depression that served to collect water, 50 cm in diameter and 17 cm deep. An arch that was entirely preserved and reached a maximum height of 2.56 m above the floor supported the room's ceiling, which had not survived. The arch, 55 cm wide, was supported by the pilasters incorporated into the middle of the room's eastern and western walls. The arch was built from smoothed, finely dressed stones that were fitted together into place. Pottery The room was filled to a height of 1 .80 m above the floor level by an earthen fill that contained fragments of pottery vessels characteristic of the end of the Byzantine period. Above them was a later fill that reached the height of the ceiling and included intrusive sherds of Early Islamic pottery. 1.3. Room (Locus 3077) This locus is a room of which only the northern part was exposed. This limited exposure was due to the foundations of the Umayyad Building II, which severed the southern part of the room. In his report, Mazar defined this room as a roofed courtyard that was used for the household's domestic needs (B. Mazar 1971: 35). The eastern wall (W. 392) was preserved to a height of 3.22 m and for a length of 1.80 m. An entrance was located 30 cm from the northern end of the wall. The narrower part of the threshold (714.78 m) was 12 cm higher than the wider part of the threshold and probably also than the floor of the room, which was not preserved. The doorway was 76 cm wide on the outside and 85 cm on the inside. Recesses hewn into the doorjambs were used for locking the door. The doorway's lintel was made from a large, finely dressed rectangular stone. Further to the south, the eastern of the two pilasters bearing the arch that supported the roof of the room was incorporated into the wall. The southern continuation of W. 392 was severed by the Umayyad construction, which also cut the room's southern wall and the southern continuation of its western wall. The northern part of the western wall (W. 382) was preserved to a height of 3.58 m for a distance of 1.90 m. There was a funnel-shaped window 45 cm from the northern end of W. 382. The window measured 30x64 cm on the inside and 50x64 cm on the outside. The western pilaster bearing the arch that supported the roof of the room was incorporated into W. 382, 1.70 m from the wall's northern end. Several courses of the arch, which were made from finely dressed rectangular stones fitted together into place, were preserved, though the ceiling had not survived. The northern Photo III. 5.

At the eastern end of this wall was the doorway leading to Room 3068. The floor of the room was not preserved. The finds were retrieved from between the top of the walls (elevation 717.10 m) and elevation 714.50 m, which is lower than the presumed level of the room's floor at 714.66 m. Pottery A complete small candlestick lamp decorated with a cross (Photo III. 5) was found in the locus at elevation 714.50 m (see the discussion of similar lamps from Area XV in Chapter 3, PL 1.17:5). The pottery from the locus, which includes large sherds and the complete candlestick lamp, is characteristic of the end of the Byzantine period and does not contain any intrusive Early Islamic pottery. The construction of the foundations of the Umayyad Building II severed the southern part of the room and in doing so most certainly disturbed its contents and those of the northern part of the room. Never- theless, the nature of the pottery found in the locus strongly suggests that it indeed belonged to the room's original contents. Other finds A pottery sherd with the Greek letters epsilon and kappa painted in red (Photo III. 6) was found in the locus, as well as a bone spindle whorl (Fig. III.2) and a fragment of a roof tile with a stamp of the Tenth Legion (Type IIf7?; see the discussion by N. Adler in a forthcoming volume). Photo III. 6. Ajar sherd with a Greek inscription painted in red (Locus 3077, Reg. No. 5239; scale 1:1). Fig. IIL2. Bone spindle whorl (Locus 3077, Reg. No. 5 1 54y; scale 1:1). 2. AREA III: THE SOUTHERN HOUSE 2.1. Introduction The southern house in Area III includes the south- western part of a private dwelling (Plan III. 3, Photo III. 7). One room with a mosaic floor (3067) was exposed, as well as an enclosed courtyard paved with stone slabs (3041) to the south. There was probably another room east of the courtyard that was not preserved. A staircase led down from this room to a basement room (3042) below it. Mazar assumed that there was a small central courtyard located north of the staircase (B. Mazar 1971: 35, PL VI). Since the structure was only partially uncovered, its plan cannot be fully reconstructed. From the basement room there is a blocked entrance into another room to the east. Another entrance in the northern wall led into a large cave (3066) that extended beneath the building. In the cave there is a staircase hewn in the bedrock, leading to a deep cistern (3111). The northern part of the building was not exposed, since above it passes the main east- west passageway of the Umayyad Building II. The building continues to the east below the Turkish city-wall. 2.2. Room (Locus 3067) The room was rectangular and measured 3.00x4.50 meters. The walls of the room were built from roughly dressed medium-sized stones, with small fieldstones filling the gaps between the larger stones. The walls were plastered. The eastern wall 209</page><page sequence="212">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN Plan III.3. The Byzantine structure in Area III south. (W. 370), which was 2.50 m long and 75 cm wide, was preserved to a maximum height of 2.44 m. An entrance into the room, 80 cm wide, was located in the middle of the wall. This doorway, which was not closed with a door, was built from six courses of rectangular stones that were finely dressed and fitted together into place. The doorway was found sealed with medium-sized stones that were apparently placed there at the time of the later phase of the use of the structure. The southern wall (W. 367) was 4.60 m long and 75 cm wide and was preserved to a height of 2.12 m. A rectangular niche, measuring 85x35 cm and 45 cm deep, was built into the wall, 55 cm from its eastern end and 94 cm above the floor 210 level. A passageway leading to the courtyard (3041) to the south was located 1 .20 m west of the niche. This doorway was 75 cm wide and its threshold was 20 cm higher than the level of the floor. At some point in time, this doorway was sealed and plastered over. The western wall (W. 368) was preserved to a height of 2.79 m. and was 3.05 meters long and 75 cm wide. A rectangular window, 20 cm high, was located 2.31 m above the level of the floor at the northern end of the wall. The funnel-shaped window was 45 cm wide on the inside and 20 cm on the outside. The northern wall (W. 369) was preserved to a height of 2.75 m and was 4.45 m long and 75 cm wide. A rectangular niche, measuring 48x55 cm and</page><page sequence="213">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY OF AREAS III AND XII Photo III. 7. The rooms of the southern house in Area III, looking southwest. 45 cm deep, was built into the wall 65 cm from its western end. The niche was 1.04 m above the floor level. A second rectangular niche, 48x75 cm and 40 cm deep, was located 1.10m from the first niche at a height of 1.33 m above the floor level. The floor of the room (713.21 m) was paved with a white mosaic decorated with a design in the center, consisting of geometric patterns in red, orange and black (Photo III. 8). The mosaic floor near the entrance into the room was decorated with a red and black floral design in the shape of a cross. The western part of the floor, 1.30 m wide, was not paved with mosaics and it seems likely that an installation stood there that was not preserved. The room's ceiling was not preserved. All of the finds from this locus that have reached us were recovered from a height of 1 .80 m above the floor level. Judging from the nature of the finds, it is assumed that they constituted part of the builders' fill of a post-Byzantine level that preceded the massive Umayyad construction, whose walls followed the layout of the Byzantine structure. The nature of this building phase has yet to be clarified. Photo III. 8. The mosaic floor in Room 3067, looking south. 211</page><page sequence="214">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN Photo III. 9. Large candlestick lamp (Locus 3067, Reg. No. 1902, IAANo. 1989-1300; scale 1:1). Pottery A complete large candlestick lamp was found in the locus (Photo III.9; see also Chapter 3, PL 1.17:7-8). No sherds were found that postdate the end of the Byzantine period. Other finds Two fragments of a clay figurine of the Beit Nattif type were found (see Chapter 20, PL 111.8:2). 2.3. Courtyard (Locus 3041) Locus 3041 was a rectangular courtyard that measured 5.00x3.30 m (Photo III. 10). The walls were built from roughly dressed medium-sized stones with small fieldstones between them. The walls were plastered. Six courses of the courtyard's northern wall (W. 367) stood to a height of 2.57 m. This wall was 3.00 m long and 75 cm wide. A doorway in the western part of the wall led into Room 3067 and was sealed in the last phase of the courtyard's use. The eastern wall (W. 344) was 5.40 m long and 65 cm wide and was preserved to a Photo III. 10. The courtyard of the southern house of Area III when it was first exposed, looking west. Note the foundations of the Umayyad Building II that cut into the Byzantine structure. 212</page><page sequence="215">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY OF AREAS III AND XII height of 2.27 m. The southern part of the wall was built on an earlier wall which most probably dates from the Roman period. During the Byzantine construction phase, the alignment of the wall was slightly changed, leaving the northern part of W. 344 protruding about 40 cm to the west. A doorway, 75 cm wide, was located 2.40 m from the northern end of W. 344. The threshold was 72 cm higher than the floor level of the courtyard. The doorjambs were preserved to a height of 1 . 12 m and were built from finely dressed large stones fitted together into place. It is assumed that this doorway led to another room, which was not preserved, above Room 3042. The southern side of the courtyard was delineated by W. 343, which was 3.65 m long and 75 cm wide and was preserved to a height of 2.14 m. The western wall Photo III. 11, Fig. III. 3. Beit Nattif lamp (Locus 3041, Reg. No. 3179; scale 1:1). (W. 342) was 4.40 m long by 75 cm wide and was preserved to a height of 2. 10 m. The courtyard's floor (712.76 m) was paved with roughly dressed square and rectangular stone slabs. Portions of the floor were discovered in situ only in the center of the courtyard and near the southern wall. A stone basin (50x50 cm) was discovered in situ , incorporated among the paving slabs next to the southern wall. Pottery One complete Beit Nattif lamp (Photo III. 11, Fig. III.3), which dates from the fourth century CE, was found in the locus (see also Chapter 3, Type 2). The ceramic finds in this locus were recovered from elevations ranging between the courtyard floor level and 1.5 m above it. However, our impression is that the finds relate not to the floor but to a fill deposited in the courtyard after it was no longer in use. Though most of the sherds in the locus are characteristic of the Byzantine period, the few fragments from the Early Islamic period are those that date the fill. 2.4. Room (Locus 3042) Locus 3042 was a rectangular room measuring 3.21x2.10 m located in the basement level (Photos 111.12-15). The room was constructed above the remains of an earlier passageway (Locus 3112) that led to the cistern (Locus 3111). The northern wall of Photo III. 12.

A hewn entrance in the middle of the wall led into Cave 3066. At the western end of the wall was a built staircase, 80 cm wide, that descended from north to south along the entire western wall to the basement level. There were 13 steps, each with an average height of 28 cm. The eastern wall (W. 399) was hewn in the bedrock in its lower part and stone-built in its upper part. A passageway, 65 cm wide, was located 1.75 m from the northern end of the wall. This doorway probably led to another room that was part of the southern building's basement, or through which one accessed the complex in Area XII. The southern wall (W. 345) was 3.00 m long and 62 cm wide and was preserved to the entire height of the basement level and in some places to the ground- floor level. Two rectangular, funnel-shaped windows, each 37 cm wide, were built into the upper continuation of this wall at the ground-floor level. The western wall (W. 344) was 3.10 m long and 60 cm wide and was preserved to its full height. A door 85 cm from the southern end of W. 344 at the level of the ground floor led into Courtyard 3041. This doorway and the windows in the southern wall (W. 344) were part of the room above Room 3042 whose floor was not preserved. The walls of Room 3042 Photo III. 13.

The lower part of the western wall was built over earlier walls whose plan and relationship to one another are unknown. The walls of the room were plastered. Nothing from either the floor or ceiling of the room survived; however, the excavators recorded in their field diary the presence of numerous roof tiles and mosaic fragments, which presumably fell into the locus with the collapse of the room above. Pottery The pottery assemblage from this locus includes a small number of Beit Nattif lamp fragments. However, the overwhelming majority of the assemblage consists of vessel fragments Photo III. 15.

A small, deep bowl (PL 111.1:1) found in the locus is similar to the many bowls discovered in the large Byzantine structure in Area XV (see Chapter 2, Pl. 1.14:3-4). These bowls date from the sixth to the mid-eighth centuries CE. A complete small candlestick lamp (Pl. 111.1:2) decorated with a cross was also found. This type of lamp is dated from the first half of the fourth to the sixth centuries CE (see Chapter 3, Type 3). A complete ovoid lamp (Pl. 111.1:3) was recovered from the locus. The lamp has a large filling hole and is decorated with guilloche pattern and a rosette. There is a molded radial decoration on the base. This type of lamp dates from the third and fourth centuries CE (see Chapter 3, Type 1). Other finds The head of a female figurine (Pl. 111.8:3) and an animal figurine (PL 111.8:7), both belonging to the Beit Nattif type, were found in the locus (see Chapter 20). Also found was a Greek inscription on a rim sherd of a Byzantine krater (see Chapter 19, Photo 111.53). Two coins were found in the locus, the later one a silver coin of the reign of Justinian I (557/8 CE, Photo 111.16). Photo III. 16. A silver coin of Justinian I (557/8 CE, Locus 3042, Reg.

Passageway (Locus 3112) This locus is defined as a passageway beneath the presumed floor level of Locus 3042 down to the bedrock at elevation 706.33 m (Photos 111.17-18). Collapsed stones blocked the original doorway to the hewn staircase passage that led to the cistern (3111). In the photograph of the collapse one can discern the finely dressed stones that were apparently vaulting stones from the ceiling of the room that existed here prior to the construction of Room 3042. The existence of this vaulted chamber is further attested by the quarrying of the bedrock in the northern wall of the locus and that of Locus 3042 above it. 215</page><page sequence="218">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN Photo III. 17.

Pottery Though a few sherds are attributed to the Byzantine period, the majority of the pottery assemblage of this locus is Herodian. The upper part of a mold-made red-slipped lamp, with a cock depicted on its decorated discus (Photo III. 19, Fig. III.4), was also found. This lamp is an imitation of an imperial Roman lamp commonly found in the eastern provinces in contexts of the second and third centuries CE (Rosenthal and Sivan 1978: 85, No. 363).

Cave (Loci 3066, 3080, 3081) A large cave extends beneath the area of the southern building in Area III (Plans III. 4-6, Photos III.20-33). Within the cave are recognizable signs of changes in the plan and function of the cave. This natural cave, which was enlarged by quarrying during several periods, was accessed from the south via Room 3042 in the basement level of the southern building. The rectangular cave, measuring 5.00x9.00 m, has a maximum height of 5.20 m. The southern wall of the cave is 6.50 m long. In the eastern part of the wall is an entrance hewn into the bedrock, which is wider on the inside. The lower Photo III.20. The entrance threshold of the cave, looking northeast. part of the doorway is rectangular, one meter wide and hewn in a manner that enabled it to be closed by a door. The door socket is located in the western end of the doorway. A recess hewn into each of the two doorjambs was for the beam that barred the door. The upper part of the doorway, which is 1.50 m wide, was apparently produced by cracking and collapse. The height of the doorway following the collapse was 1 .97 m above the threshold (709.33 m). One stepped down a large, irregular stone step from the entrance to the floor level of the cave (Locus Plan III.4.

Cave 3066: section 4-4, north-south, looking west. 3081). There is another hewn doorway measuring 0.80x1.40 m below the entrance; via this earlier doorway one reached the stairs that led to the cistern (Locus 3111) and to the building in Area XII. This doorway, located below the presumed level of the floor of Room 3042, was no longer in use after the upper doorway to the cave was hewn above it. An additional doorway is located in the center of the cave's southern wall, approximately two meters from the eastern entrance. The elevation of the threshold is 708.80 m. The lower part of this doorway is finely hewn; since it is wider on the inside than on the outside, it was meant to be closed with a door. In its upper part the doorway widens from 1.00 to 1.95 m., an irregularity that can be explained by the cave's different phases of use (see below). This doorway was found sealed by a wall built from well-hewn stones and a rubble of collapsed stones behind it, which was not excavated. The western wall of the cave is 4.45 m long. A rectangular entrance hewn in the bedrock, measuring 1.35x3.45 m, is located 75 cm from the southern end of this wall. The threshold is at elevation 707.30 m. The upper part of the doorway is irregularly hewn, perhaps by someone who wanted to find out what lay beyond the doorway at a time when most of it was buried. This doorway, which was also found blocked, led to another space to the west which was not excavated. A rectangular niche, measuring 1.00x0.50 m and 0.70 m deep, was hewn into the northern end of the wall. The base of the niche is at elevation 709.45 m. The cave's northern wall is 10 m long. The western part of the wall was coated with gray plaster and decorated along its upper part with two reddish-brown, horizontal stripes. A rectangular protrusion 90 cm wide, hewn from the bedrock, extends the entire height of the cave, 1.60 m from the western end of the wall. A stone wall, 50 cm wide, was built perpendicular to the cave's northern wall, 4.30 m. from its western 219</page><page sequence="222">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN Photo III.21. The entrance to the cave and below it the earlier entrance to the staircase passage leading to the cistern (3111), looking northeast. end. In the northern wall of the cave, 1.80 m east of the stone-built wall, is a rectangular hewn niche, 1.45 m deep and 2.10 m wide. The ceiling of the niche is more than a meter lower than that of the cave. The height of the niche, 3.35 m, apparently reflects the massive quarrying activity that took place on the floor of the cave and not on the floor level of the niche, which is probably the original floor level of the cave. The cave's eastern wall is 3.90 m long. It is entirely occupied by a hewn rectangular niche and on its south a narrow stepped passage leads to the eastern cistern (3111). Only the eastern part of the niche was preserved, since the western part had been quarried away. The eastern wall of the niche is 1.56 m long. The ceiling of the niche is more than a meter lower than the ceiling of the cave, similar to that of the adjacent niche to the north. Only a small portion of the niche's floor was preserved along the length of the wall. The original entrance to the passage was outside the cave, below the entrance in the southern wall. The passage was originally 70 cm wide and 6.20 m long, with 18 stairs each 30 cm high and 30 cm deep. In a later phase of the cave's use, the passage's original doorway was sealed and it was accessed from within the cave. Thus, the passage was shortened to about 3.50 m and only 11 of the stairs leading up to the cistern (3111) remained in use. A wide, square landing measuring 75x75 cm is located at the upper end of the staircase. From the landing the passageway turns 90Â° to the north with two more steps leading to a second landing identical in size. From that second landing one could either turn west to ascend to the building in Area XII or turn east to the cistern's doorway (Locus 3111). Throughout the entire area of the cave and especially on its floor, there are clear signs of the Photo III.22.

The western wall of the cave as it appears today, looking west. quarrying of rectangular blocks. There were holes through the ceiling and walls in several places, probably used either for removing the quarried stones or for tethering livestock. Running along most of the walls at a high elevation was a thick layer of fine granular material, light gray in color and mixed with ash (Locus 3080). This layer appears to have seeped into the cave through the Photo III.24.

The eastern wall of the cave at the start of the excavation, looking east. western doorway in the southern wall. It was not discerned in the western part of the cave or on either side of the staircase passage in the eastern wall. In the western part of the cave there were industrial installations that include the remains of an oven damaged by later quarrying. Next to the northern wall was another oven, 65 cm in diameter, hewn into the bedrock. Its southern side was cut open. Mazar summarized the principal phases of the cave: "Firstly, it underwent several changes over the years: in the lowermost levels, the finds indicate that it was in use already in the Roman period. We may note also that additional doorways were made on the west and south, undoubtedly leading to rooms Photo III. 27. The eastern wall of the cave at the end of the excavation, looking east. beneath the rock surface. The walls of the cave had been decorated with colorful paintings, of which only several strips and other traces have survived" (Mazar 1971: 35, Pl. VII). Mazar's description is compatible, in part, with the suggested principal phases of activity in the cave that we present below. This analysis is based on the excavators' notes, the material finds and a rÃ©Ã©valuation of the field data. Phase 1 : cave with large niches From the first phase, an entire rectangular niche and half of another one were preserved in the north- eastern part of the cave. Neither the contour of the original cave nor the location of the entrance during this phase can be determined; each of the three entrances now visible in the cave could have been in use. The cave was probably used for burials, like many others on the Temple Mount during the Bronze Age (Gonen 1985: 44-55, E. Mazar 1999: 29-30). However, it should be noted that this hypothesis was not confirmed by finds of bones or other objects. Phase 2: industrial installations From the second phase of the activity in the cave several industrial installations remained, mostly in the western part of the cave. We assume that other installations were originally located in the eastern part and were removed as a result of later quarrying activity. The installations that have survived include an oven next to the cave's southern wall and another oven, its southern side cut open, adjacent to the northern wall of the cave. This oven was not fully excavated. Another installation is a pit hewn next to and partially below the middle of the northern wall. Medium-sized stones were found in the pit during the excavation. Black soot was preserved on the walls near the ovens in the western part of the cave. The raising of the entrance in the western wall of the cave should be attributed to this phase. During the excavation, the doorway was found completely sealed with a wall of medium-sized stones. The nature and relationship of the installations can only be ascertained when excavation is extended westwards on the other side of the doorway. It can be assumed that in this phase, if not even earlier, the hewn stepped passage leading to the cistern (3111) was in use. However, it cannot be assumed that in this phase there was a connection between the cave and the passage to the cistern. It is presumed that in the first phase the southeastern part of the cave was 222</page><page sequence="225">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY OF AREAS III AND XII Photo III.28. The northern niche in the eastern wall of the cave, looking north. separate from the stepped passage to the cistern, which was located below the level of the floor of the cave, beyond its southeastern corner. Both the industrial installations and the passage to the cistern create the impression of an industrial complex in the basement of a public building, dating from any time from the Iron Age to the Roman period, when the installations were put out of use by quarrying activity. Phase 3: quarry In the third phase of the cave's use, at some point before the fourth century CE (the date of the coins found above the quarrying in Locus 3081), the cave was used for quarrying medium-sized and large rectangular stone blocks. When similar signs of quarrying were exposed east of the house in Area III, they were thought to be part of the construction activities of Aelia Capitolina during the second century CE (B. Mazar 1971: 36). The quarrying activity damaged the contour of the cave and the industrial installations inside it. The cave and the stepped passage leading to the cistern were connected, probably because of the quarrying activity and the removal of the partition between the niches in the southeastern part of the cave. It is assumed that during this phase the raised doorway in the western wall still served as the entrance into the cave. Phase 4: the basement level of dwellings (Locus 3081) In the fourth phase of the cave's use (which, based on the numismatic evidence, began at the earliest in the mid-fourth century CE), the entrance in the western wall was sealed and the floor of the cave was leveled with earthen fill. The cave's area was apparently divided into two separate parts by a stone-built wall, of which only a few courses were discovered. The wall was built on the natural bedrock, which rose to a high level in the middle of the cave. Photo III.29. The western entrance in the southern wall of the cave, looking south. 223</page><page sequence="226">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN Photo 111.30. Remains of fresco on the western part of the northern wall of the cave. There were carefully hewn entrances, one to each part of the cave, at each end of the southern wall of the cave. Both doorways are wider on the inside than the outside, a characteristic of doorways meant to be closed with doors. The western part of the cave is domestic in character, as attested by the remains of plaster decorated with red painted stripes on the northern wall and a rectangular niche hewn into the western wall. In contrast, there are no visible remains of plaster on the walls of the eastern part of the cave and it is assumed that this part served only as a passageway to the cistern (3 1 1 1) or perhaps for keeping livestock. The floor of the entire area of the cave in this phase, characterized by a layer of tamped soil atop an earthen fill, was designated Locus 3081. In this phase, the cistern served the southern building in Area III and its residents could access the cistern from the basement level via the eastern part of the cave. Additional access to the Photo III. 3 1 . The remains of quarrying activities that cut through the early installations in the western part of the cave, looking southwest. cistern was provided by a doorway next to the entrance to the building in Area XII; hence, it is assumed that the cistern served the needs of both buildings. Phase 5: the last phase of use In the last phase of the cave's use, the western entrance in the southern wall of the cave was blocked, as was the stepped passage leading to the cistern (3111) in the eastern part of the cave. It is also assumed that the southern portion of the partition wall separating the two parts of the cave was removed, allowing free movement between the two areas. In this phase the entire area of the cave was accessed by the entrance at the eastern end of the southern wall, which was part of the basement level of the southern building in Area III. The residents of the building during this phase did not have direct entry to the cistern, to which the only remaining access was from the building in Area XII. Judging from the finds from the cave (Loci 3080 and Photo III. 3 2. An installation hewn half into the floor and half into the cave's northern wall. 224</page><page sequence="227">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY OF AREAS III AND XII Photo III.33. The sealed opening of the staircase passage leading to the cistern (3111), looking east. 3066), this last phase may be attributed to the end of the Byzantine period. It is noteworthy that during the later phase of the southern building, the doorway between the room with the mosaic floor (3067) and the courtyard to its south (3041) was sealed, probably for the same reasons as the alterations in the cave. After this phase the cave was no longer in use and it remained abandoned and open to the deposition of eroded soil, including the layer of fine granular gray material mixed with ash that was designated Locus 3080. This layer can be traced through almost all parts of the cave. At some later point in time, after the erosion deposits reached a considerable height, attempts were made to break through the bedrock above the early entrances in the southern and western walls. It is assumed that these attempts were made in order to find out where the doorways led, but when it became clear that the passages behind the doorways were blocked by stone collapse, the attempts were abandoned. Pottery Hundreds of pottery sherds of the widest possible variety of types were found throughout the entire area of the cave. The earliest pottery finds from the cave are fragments from the Iron Age II. A small number of complete vessels from the cave are from the Roman period. These include a red-slipped deep bowl with a ledge rim (PI. 111.2:1). This is an imported vessel belonging to the African Red Slip Ware from North Africa; it is classified by Hayes as Type 52A, which he dates to approximately 300-350 CE (Hayes 1972: 78). The complete base of an imported Red Ware bowl (PI. 111.2:2) with a stamped cross decoration on the interior's center was also found. Similar impressions appear on bowls from Asia Minor that were discovered in the large Byzantine structure in Area XV and date from ca. 500 CE (see Chapter 2, Imported Pottery Pis. 1.14:12, 1.16:42). Also found was a fragment of the nozzle and upper part of a lamp (PI. 111.2:7) belonging to the "Darom" lamp type, dated to 70-135 CE (Sussman 1972: 28). A fragment of a red-slipped lamp base (PI. 111.2:3) belongs to the group of round lamps with a decorated discus that imitates imperial Roman lamps dating from the second and third centuries CE. A complete lamp (PL 111.2:4) belonging to the same group was also found in the cave; the decorated discus of this lamp was intentionally broken (Rosenthal and Sivan 1978: 85). Two large fragments belonged to ovoid lamps with large filling holes (Pl. III.2: 5-6), one decorated with a radial pattern and the other with two inter- secting volutes and two birds on the shoulder. These lamps date from the third-fourth centuries CE (see Chapter 3, Type 1). The great majority of the pottery is from the Byzantine period, by the end of which the cave was no longer in use. Complete vessels from the Byzantine period discovered in the cave and in the stepped passageway to the cistern include two complete small candlestick lamps (PL 111.2:8, 10). One is decorated with a cross and the other with a branch design. The small candlestick lamp first appeared in the first half of the fourth century but is characteristic mainly of the fifth century CE (see Chapter 3, Type 3). Four large candlestick lamps were found, of which two are complete and two are broken (Pl. 111.2:9, 11-13). One is decorated with a Greek inscription and a cross and the other with a Greek inscription and a branch design. Both of these lamps were found in the passage leading to the 225</page><page sequence="228">Pl. III.2. Locus 3066.

Other finds Six roof tiles with Tenth Legion stamps (Types I, lib 12, IIf2, IIf4, IIf5; to be discussed by N. Adler in a forthcoming volume) were found in the locus, as well as a fragment of a clay Beit Nattif female figurine (Chapter 20, PI. 111.8:1).

Peleg in a forthcoming volume). A copper alloy bell (PI. 111.3:3) was recovered from the locus, as well as four bronze coins. The earliest coin dates from the time of Probus (279-282 CE), 227</page><page sequence="230">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN Pl. III.3. Locus 3066. No. Object Reg.

Erosion layer (Locus 3080) This locus was defined by the excavators as a thick layer whose traces were throughout the cave, covering the Byzantine layer. This layer is stratigraphically the latest in the cave and it probably represents the time when the cave was deserted and no longer in use. This thick layer was 1.20 meters above the thin layer of the Byzantine floor (Locus 3081) and contained fine, gray, granular chalky material mixed with large amounts of ash. Pottery The earliest fragment found in the locus is part of a 228 holemouth jar of the Iron Age II. A number of sherds are attributed to the Herodian period. Two large fragments of fairly complete ovoid lamps with large filling holes were found in the locus (Fig. III. 7-8, Photo 111.34). One of these lamps is decorated on its upper surface with a ladder pattern and branch design and its base is adorned with a radial pattern. The second lamp is decorated with diagonal lines forming a zigzag pattern. This type of lamp dates from the third-fourth centuries CE (see Chapter 3, Type 1). A small number of vessel fragments that are characteristic of the end of the Byzantine period was also found in the locus. Other finds An incised copper alloy bead (Photo III.35, Fig. III.9) was found in the locus, as were three coins dating from the mid-fourth century CE.</page><page sequence="231">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY OF AREAS III AND XII Fig. III.7.

Fig. III.9, Photo III.35. Copper alloy bead decorated with double incisions (Locus 3080, Reg. No. 5430y). 2.6.2. Floor Foundation (Locus 3081) This locus was assigned by the excavators to the thin foundation layer of a floor (708. 1 3 m), which has an average thickness of about 10 cm. At the base of the floor's foundation were two thin gray layers separated by an earthen fill containing small stones and mosaic tesserae. It is assumed that this stratifi- cation indicates the existence of two floor phases. The floor overlay an earthen fill which contained several layers of small stones and reached a maximum depth of 1 .90 m. No finds were related to this fill. Only a segment of the floor was preserved at the foot of the cave's western wall. Two stairs led down from the eastern doorway in the southern wall to the level of the floor. The top stair was hewn into the bedrock of the doorway's threshold, while the lower one was made from a roughly dressed irregularly shaped rectangular stone placed on medium-sized stones. Stratigraphically, this floor relates to the cave's fifth phase of use, and the lower layer of the floor foundation probably relates to the cave's fourth phase. On the basis of the finds from the locus, we can date the construction of this floor to the fourth century CE at the earliest. Pottery A number of bowl fragments of the Iron Age II were found in the locus, as well as several Hellenistic sherds. The assemblage also includes fragments of Roman lamps and a considerable number of fragments of rouletted bowls. The assemblage does not contain Late Byzantine pottery. A number of complete vessels were found in the locus, among them a red-slipped carinated bowl with a ring base (Fig. III. 10). This bowl is an import from North Africa and belongs to the African Red Slip Ware (Hayes 1972), though no exact parallels to it were found. A complete ovoid lamp with a large filling hole and relief decoration consisting of a pattern of triangles separated by flowers surrounding the filling hole (Photo 111.36; Fig. III. 11) was also Fig. III. 10.

Other finds Other finds recovered from this locus include two stone beads and a faience bead (PL 111.4:1-3), two ivory pins (Pl. 111.4:4-5), a copper alloy pin (PL 111.4:6) and a clay animal figurine or vessel decoration (Pl. 111.4:7). Twenty-five coins were found, representing a chronological sequence; the earliest dates from the reign of Antiochus IV (175-164 BCE) and the latest from the reign of Constans II (641-668 CE, PL 111.4:8). Photo 111.37. The base of the cistern (3111). 2.6.3. Cistern (Loci 3111, 3115) The cistern, measuring 3.00x2.50 m and 4.50 m deep (Photos III. 37-38), was hewn into the bedrock with its base at elevation 708.59 m. According to the excavators' field diaries, the upper level of the cistern was defined as Locus 3111, while its lower part was designated Locus 3115. The opening of the cistern was in its western wall, 3.90 m above the base. The cistern could be accessed by ascending the stepped passage from Cave 3066 in the west or by descending from the residential dwelling in Area XII to the north. Based on the phases identified in Cave 3066, it is assumed that in the cistern's earliest phase it was not connected to the cave and was used independently in the building complex that predated the Roman period (see Phase 2 in Locus 3066 and B. Mazar 1971: 35). The last phase of the use of the cistern is represented by a very rich assemblage of pottery vessels, primarily jugs that are characteristic of the end of the Byzantine period.

IAA No. 39579 Pottery Many complete vessels were discovered in the cistern. The largest quantity of vessels consists of jugs with a wide variety of decorations and shapes. The principal types within the assemblage are: Type 1 : Ajar with a wide neck (PI. 111.5:1). The jar has an everted triangular rim, a wide, high neck with a protruding ridge at its base and an omphalos base. There is wavy and horizontal combed decoration on the shoulder. Similar jars were discovered in Jerusalem and at Ramat Rahel and date from the sixth century CE (Tushingham 1985: 103, Fig. 31:12; Aharoni 1962: 27, Fig. 17:23). Type 2 : An amphoriskos with a funnel-shaped neck (PI. 111.5:2). This vessel has two loop handles that extend from the base of the neck to the shoulder of the vessel, which has a dense horizontal combed decoration. A parallel to this amphoriskos found at Bethany dates from the second half of the sixth to the seventh centuries CE (Sailer 1957: 148, Fig. 43:2704). Type 3 : Six short-necked jugs characterized by a flared or upright square rim, a neck that continues the line of the elliptical body and a concave base. This type may be subdivided into a number of variants. Variant 1 (PI. 111.5:3-5) is undecorated and is characterized by a long, narrow body. Similar jugs were found at the Dominus Flevit monastery, at Ramat Rahel and at Bethany and date from the end of the Byzantine period (Bagatti and Milik 1958: Fig. 30:13; Aharoni 1956: 109, Fig. 5:3; Sailer 1957: 148, PI. 124:10, Fig. 58:3273). Variant 2 { PI. 111.5:6) is characterized by a wider, conical body and a horizontal combed decoration at the base of the neck. Two jugs of this type were discovered in Stratum A2 at Ramat Rahel and date from the sixth to mid-seventh centuries CE (Aharoni 1964: 122, Fig. 23:9,10). Magness classifies this variant as "FBW Jugs and Juglets Form 1C", which she dates from the mid-sixth to early eighth centuries CE (Magness 1993: 237-239).

This variant has a wavy and horizontal combed decoration just below the neck. We did not find an exact parallel for this jug, though it appears to represent a more developed phase of Variant 2. The combed decoration is typical of the Byzantine pottery of Jerusalem from the mid- sixth century CE onwards (Magness 1993: 206, 227, 232). Type 4' Seven high-necked jugs characterized in general by an upright, thickened rim with a square profile, a high, broad neck and a loop handle that extends from the rim to the shoulder of the vessel. The body of the jug is elliptical or round with an omphalos base. Within this classification there are five variants. Variant 1 (PL 111.5:8-10) consists of three vessels found in the locus. They are undecorated and have a biconical, elliptical body. Jugs of this type were discovered at the Monastery of Martyrius and at Bethany and date from the end of the Byzantine period (Magen 1993: 40; Sailer 1957: 148, Pl. 129a 10, Fig. 62.4218). Variant 2 (Pl. 111.5:11) has a globular body with a combed horizontal decoration on the shoulder. This type of jug was found at Bethany, where it was dated by the excavator to the second half of the sixth century CE (Sailer 1957: 148, Fig. 60:4660). Variant 3 (PL 111.5:12) has an everted rim, a prominent ridge midway up the neck and another ridge at the base of the neck. The body is elliptical with two horizontal strips of combed decoration on the shoulder. No exact parallel was found for this vessel, which is probably a more developed version of Variant 1 . Variant 4 (PL III. 5: 13) has an everted rim, ridges on the neck and a spout on the shoulder, which is decorated with deep diagonal, incised lines. Magness classified this type of jug as "FBW Jugs and Juglets Form IB". Parallels dating from the mid-sixth to early eighth centuries CE were found at Bethany, at the Armenian Garden in Jerusalem and at the Monastery of Martyrius (Sailer 1957: 148, Fig. 59:2705; Tushingham 1985: Fig. 31.22; Magen 1993: 35; Magness 1993: 237-238). Variant 5 (PL 111.5:14) has a trefoil rim and a flared neck with a prominent ridge at its base. The shoulder is treated with a horizontal combed decoration and deep, diagonal notches. Similar jugs were found at the Monastery of Martyrius and date from the end of the Byzantine period (Magen 1993: 35). Three complete lamps were found in Locus 3115, the cistern's lower level. Two of them (PL 111.5:15-16) are large candlestick lamps and the third (PL 111.5:17) a small candlestick lamp (see Chapter 3, Types 3 and 4). Other finds Alead weight (PL III. 6: 1), an ivory bead (Pl. 111.6:3) and a coin of 498-538 CE (PL 111.6:2) were found in the cistern. Pl. III.6. Locus 3111. No. Object Reg.

Introduction The area, excavated in 1971 and the beginning of 1972, includes part of a dwelling of which three rooms were exposed (Plan III. 7, Photo III. 39). The excavation was not continued to the north of the building because of the presence of the path that led to the eastern part of the excavation. On the east the building was bordered by an Umayyad wall running north-south. On the south the upper part of the building was not preserved; the only surviving ground-floor room (12002), whose sole entrance faced south, probably functioned as a shop, separated from the rest of the structure. The building was not exposed further to the west because of the presence of the outer eastern wall of the Umayyad Building II and the Turkish wall atop it; conse- quently, the excavators were unable to ascertain the relationship between this structure and those located in Area III. The cistern (3111) had entrances from the buildings in both Areas III and XII, and was thus probably used by the residents of both buildings. 3.2. Room (Locus 12002 lower and upper) The room is rectangular, measuring 4.30x3.25 m (Photos III.40-42). The southern wall (W. 1203) is 5.51 m long, 95 cm wide and is preserved to a maximum height of 2.93 m above the level of the floor. An entrance, 1.05 m wide, is located 1.15 m from the western end of the wall. Its threshold is flush with the floor level of the room (711.14 m). The upper part of the doorway was not preserved at the time of its exposure and was later reconstructed by the excavators. Unfortunately, the lintel, which was found in the collapse debris near the doorway, was incorrectly set in place; it should have been positioned two courses lower. The excavators recognized this error, which they recorded in their field diaries and noted on the field photographs, but the reconstruction was not corrected in the field. At some point in the structure's use, the level of the entrance into the room was raised and a stone staircase consisting of five steps, each averaging 1 8 cm deep, 22 cm high and 45 cm wide, was built into the doorway from which one descended into the Photo III.39. General view of the house in Area XII, looking east. 235</page><page sequence="238">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN Plan III.7. The Byzantine structure in Area XII. 236</page><page sequence="239">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY OF AREAS III AND XII room. It is assumed that these stairs are associated in some way with the partition that was built in the center of the room (see below). A funnel-shaped window (40x64 cm) was located 85 cm from the eastern side of the entrance and 1.46 m above the floor level. A second funnel-shaped window (29x64 cm) was located at the same height, 80 cm to the west of the first window. The room's western wall (W. 1205) was 5.00 m long. The width of this wall is unknown, since its western face was not exposed and the area to its west up to the Turkish city-wall was not excavated. The relationship between the two walls and their chronological sequence conse- quently remain unclear. A square pilaster (60x60 cm), which was preserved to a height of 1.42 m, abutted the middle of W. 1205, 95 cm from its southern end. The arch itself was not preserved; nor was the corresponding pilaster on the eastern wall, which was reconstructed by the excavators from stones discovered in the collapse debris. The northern wall (W. 1202) was 5.20 m long and 75 cm wide and was preserved to a maximum height of 2.35 m. The eastern wall (W. 1204) was 4.20 m long and was preserved to a maximum height of 2.97 m. The floor level was defined by a thin white chalky layer at elevation 711.14 m. During a later phase of the room's use, a fieldstone partition was built on the floor level and was preserved to a height of 35 cm. This partition, which divided the room into two for some unknown purpose, was built from the northern edge of the pilaster in the western wall up to the eastern wall. The entrance to the room's second story was preserved in the southern wall (W. 1203), 80 cm from its eastern end. The threshold was 2.93 m above the level of the floor of the room. This doorway was 75 cm wide on the outside and 85 cm on the inside. The plan of Locus 12002 is that of a single room whose sole doorway faces south, which suggests that it probably functioned as a shop that faced a street or was a room in a building complex that extended to the south. The area south of the room was not excavated. The fill that was excavated beneath the room's floor was designated Locus 12018 (see below). Pottery Locus 12002 contained many fragments of pottery vessels from the Byzantine period and several sherds from the Early Islamic period. Photo III.40. Room 12002, looking south towards the entrance. Photo III.41. Room 12002, looking southwest (annotated by excavators).

The line marks the point above which the wall was reconstructed; the box marks the approximate position where the lintel should have been reconstructed. 3.3. Fill beneath floor (Locus 12018) This locus consists of the fill beneath the eastern part of the floor in Room 12002 (Photo III.43). The fill was excavated to a depth of more than 2 m. A 6 cm thick layer of gray earth was exposed 25 cm below the room's floor. Below this layer was a paved surface made from medium-sized, irregularly shaped stone slabs (7 1 0.86 m), and below the paving was an earthen fill containing numerous finds. Pottery Numerous finds were attributed to the various strati- graphic elements in the locus. The fragments of pottery vessels recovered on the stone paving (between elevations 711.14 m and 710.86 m) are typical of the Byzantine period. The finds from below the paving slabs down to elevation 709.80 m include Herodian, Hellenistic and Iron Age pottery. Though a very small number of sherds could be 238 attributed to the beginning of the Byzantine period, this level did not yield pottery that is unequivocally Byzantine in date. The lowest part of the locus, from elevations 709.80 m to 709.40 m, yielded Roman, Herodian, Hellenistic and Iron Age sherds. The relatively large amount of Iron Age pottery present in the locus is especially interesting. Other finds Two iron knives (Photo III.44) were found in the locus, as well as the head of a clay figurine (Fig. III. 1 2), probably of the Beit Nattif type (see Chapter 20). Seven coins were recovered from the level between the floor foundation and the slab paving, the latest dating from 383-395 CE. Of the 94 coins found beneath the stone paving, the latest date from 383-395 CE. The find of such a large number of coins in a small area is probably indicative of a hoard. Photo III.43.

Courtyard (Locus 12047) This locus, probably a courtyard, is a rectangular stone-paved space. The eastern wall (W. 1207) is 5.25 m long and 40 cm wide. There is a doorway in the southern part of the wall that led into Anteroom 12010. W. 1202, which delineated the locus on the south, was preserved only in its eastern part for a length of 80 cm. Of the western wall of the locus (W. 1299), only 35 cm of the northern end were preserved; its southern continuation was severed by the outer, eastern wall of the Umayyad Building II on top of which the Turkish city-wall was built. The locus is delineated on the north by W. 1206, which is 2.00 m long. Because of the undifferentiated recon- struction that was carried out in the area, the elements of the locus could not be reexamined in depth. Pottery The ceramic finds, recovered between elevations 714.45 m and 713.90 m, comprise a homogenous Byzantine and assemblage. A fragment of the base (Photo III.45) of an imported North African red- slipped bowl (African Red Slip Ware) was found in the locus. The bowl is shallow, with two concentric circles incised around its inner surface. In the center Photo 111.45. African Red Slip Ware bowl stamped with a dove (Locus 12047, Reg. No. 4860; scale 1:2). of the base is a stamped impression of two doves, of one of which only the tail remains. On the complete vessel there were probably three stamped doves. A very similar impression appears in Hayes's Type 209B, which he dates to the second half of the sixth century CE (Hayes 1972: 260). An imported bowl decorated with a similar dove was discovered in the Tyropoeon excavations (Crowfoot and Fitzgerald 1929: PL XIV:5). Other finds A copper alloy buckle (Photo III.46) and two coins were found in the locus. The coins are of the sixth century. Photo 111.46. Copper alloy buckle (Locus 12047, Reg. No. 810-0). 3.5. Anteroom (Locus 12010) Locus 12010 is a small anteroom measuring 1.80x2.00 m. The western wall (W. 1207) is 1.85 m long and 40 cm wide and is preserved to a maximum height of 77 cm. At the northern end of the wall is an 239</page><page sequence="242">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN entrance, 1.10 m wide on the outside and 90 cm on the inside. The northern wall (W. 1208) is 2.75 m long. Its western end is preserved to a height of 70 cm. There was probably another entrance into the anteroom from Courtyard 12001 at the eastern end of this wall, where it is not preserved; a doorway from this direction might explain the orientation of the inscription on the floor (see below). The eastern wall (W. 1209) is 2.65 m long and 60 cm wide, and is preserved to a height of 32 cm. The lower part of a column is incorporated in an upright position in the northern end of W. 1209, at the corner with W. 1208. The locus is enclosed on the south by W. 1202, which is 2.00 m long. All of the anteroom's walls were plastered. The floor (714.29 m) is paved with a white mosaic decorated with red and black florets and sprigs (Photo 111.53). The northeastern part of the pavement is damaged. In the center of the mosaic were two concentric rectangular frames measuring 1.10x1.15 m and 85x95 cm. Within the double frame is the three-line Greek inscription: "Good luck to those who live here" (see Chapter 19). The beginning and end of the inscription are decorated with a branch. It should be noted that although the entrance to the anteroom was in the western wall, the fact that the inscription was oriented towards the north implies that there was originally an entrance in the northern wall. 3.6. Courtyard (Locus 12001) Locus 12001 is a rectangular courtyard measuring 2.50x3.70 m. The courtyard is bordered on the north by W. 1206, which is 4.65 m long and 60 cm wide and is preserved to a height of 41 cm. A doorway, 1.15m wide, is located at the eastern end of the wall. The eastern wall (Wall 1211) is 1.95 m long and 65 cm wide and is preserved to a height of 32 cm. A doorway, 1 .25 m wide, is located at the northern end of this wall. The doorway's threshold is flush with the level of the courtyard's floor (714.89 m). The courtyard is enclosed on the south by W. 1208, which is 2.40 m long. At the eastern end of the wall is a doorway 1.30 m wide with a threshold consisting of two steps, each 30 cm high. The courtyard's western wall (W. 1207) is preserved to a height of 59 cm and is 3.50 m long and 40 cm wide. The walls of the courtyard were probably decorated with stucco, fragments of which were found in the fill. Some of the fragments are decorated with incised horizontal and vertical lines. The courtyard's floor (714.89 m) is paved with medium-sized and large stone slabs that are roughly dressed and fitted loosely into place. A plastered stone-built channel (Locus 12012) extends across the courtyard from east to west. The channel is 3.97 m long and 28 cm wide and its sides are preserved to a height of 29 cm. The elevation of the channel's floor is 714.48 m. The channel was originally covered by stone slabs that lay flush with the courtyard's floor. The channel emerged from the eastern wall of a rectangular stone basin (1.00x0.60 m) that abutted the courtyard's western wall. The basin is sunk into the floor of the courtyard for about two-thirds of its height. The channel continued to the east beyond the limits of the courtyard. A second channel, stone-built and covered with stone slabs, emerged from the southern wall of the basin and probably led to the cistern located beneath the building. South of the entrance into the room in W. 1208 and east of W.1209 is a small area at an elevation of 714.41 m measuring 1.66x1.50 m. This area is paved with rectangular stone slabs that are finely dressed and closely fitted together. From here one could continue northwards into the courtyard, turn east into Room 1 2004 or perhaps also turn south to another room that was above Room 12002. Finds Two Byzantine roof tiles were found, one flat with two stamped circles and the other convex with one stamped circle (see Chapter 16). Two coins were recovered from the locus, one dating from the fourth or fifth century CE and the other from the seventh century CE. 3.7. Room (Locus 12004) This locus is the western part of a room whose limits are unknown, located east of Courtyard 12001. The Umayyad building severed the eastern part of the room. A stone-built channel (12013), 28 cm wide, ran in an east-west direction beneath what appeared to be the floor level in the southern part of the locus. It may be assumed that, like Channel 12012, this channel was covered with stone slabs that were not preserved. Pottery The ceramic assemblage is mixed and includes a substantial amount of Iron Age sherds, primarily of wheel-burnished bowls. There are also Hellenistic, Herodian and Byzantine sherds. 240</page><page sequence="243">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY OF AREAS III AND XII Photo III.47, Fig. III. 13a- b. Fragment of marble slab decorated with a bird and the base of a pedestal (Locus 12004, Reg. No. 666): photograph, drawing (scale 1:3) and proposed reconstruction. Other finds A fragment of a marble slab with a rounded base (Photo III.47, Fig. III. 13) was found in the locus (E. Mazar and O. Peleg 1999: 70-72). A bird standing next to a tripod pedestal is carved in relief. The excavators suggested in their notes that this design should be reconstructed as a seven-branched menorah flanked by two standing birds. 3.8. Corridor (Locus 12045) This locus consists of a small rectangular corridor measuring 1.15x2.15 m that connected Courtyard 12001 with the rooms in the northern part of the building. The corridor was accessed from the north- eastern corner of the courtyard via a doorway 1.15m wide. The doorway takes up the entire width of the corridor. W. 1298, to the west, is 2.35 m long and 42 cm wide. W. 1216, at the northern end of the corridor, contained a doorway leading into Room 12046 (see below). To the east is W. 1210, which is 2.35 m long and 67 cm wide. The floor of the corridor was not preserved. Pottery The pottery finds in this locus were recovered from elevation 713.95 m. The pottery sherds are typical of the Byzantine period and include one small, deep complete bowl with a flared rim, slightly curved sides and a disk base (Photo 111.48). Similar bowls were discovered in the large Byzantine structure in Area XV and date from the end of the Byzantine period (see Chapter 3, PI. 1.14:3). 3.9. Room (Locus 12039) This rectangular room measured 4.10x1.80 m. and is located west of Corridor 12045 (Photo 111.49). The western wall (W. 1299) is 2.48 m long. A doorway, 80 cm wide, is located in the center of the wall, 1.20 m from its southern end. It should be noted that W. 1 299 is very poorly preserved and only its eastern face survived as a consequence of the construction of the outer, eastern wall of the Photo III.48. Deep bowl with flaring rim (Locus 12045, Reg. No. 241/606, IAANo. 1978-2255). 241</page><page sequence="244">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN Photo III.49.

The northern wall (W. 1226) is 3.80 m long and 75 cm wide and the eastern wall (W. 1298) is 1.50 m long and 45 cm wide. The upper part of W. 1298 is built from a single finely dressed rectangular stone that probably originated in an earlier building. W. 1206 delineated the locus on the south. The floor of the room is not preserved. A round plastered installation, built from small stones and 50 cm in diameter, is located in the northwestern corner of the room. Pottery Fragments of pottery vessels that are character- istic of the end of the Byzantine period were recovered from between elevations 715.50 m and 714.50 m. 3.10. Room (Locus 12046) This locus consists of the southern part of the room to the north of Corridor 12045 (Photo III.50). Only the southern part of the room, which measures 3.00x3.45 m, was exposed during the excavation. W. 1216, to the south, is 3.00 m long by 60 cm wide. A doorway located in the western end of the wall is 75 cm wide on the outside and 85 cm on the inside. A door socket is hewn into the threshold next to the eastern doorjamb. The room was bordered on the west by W. 1297, 68 cm wide, of which 3.49 m were uncovered in the excavation. W. 1296, which enclosed the room from the east, was exposed for a distance of 3.30 m. The eastern face of this wall was damaged by a north-south oriented Umayyad wall that passed to the east of the building. A photograph taken during the excavation shows fragments of pottery vessels, presumably in situ , distributed over a uniform level. Since all the pottery sherds discovered in this room are registered as coming from a single elevation (714.58 m), we presume that this was the floor level. Pottery The pottery finds are exclusively Byzantine in date. A complete juglet (Photo 111.51) found in the locus has a square, flared rim, a short broad neck and an elliptical, ribbed body atop a high disk base. It is decorated with three diagonal incisions. A loop handle extends from the rim down to the middle of the body. Such juglets are characteristic of sites in Jerusalem and the vicinity at the end of the Byzantine period (Magness 1993: 239-240).</page><page sequence="245">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY OF AREAS III AND XII Photo 111.51. Fine Byzantine Ware juglet decorated with three diagonal incisions (Locus 12046, Reg. No. 551, IAA No. 1978-2255; scale 1:2). 3.11. Room (Locus 12038) Locus 12038 is the southeastern part of a room that was only partially excavated. It is bordered on the east by W. 1297, 68 cm wide, which is exposed for a distance of 3.49 m and on the south by W. 1226, which is 3.80 m long and 75 cm wide. The elevation of the floor is unknown. Pottery The pottery recovered from this locus came from elevations ranging from 1.00 to 0.24 m below the top of the room's walls. The assemblage is homogeneous and Byzantine in date. Several complete vessels were found in the locus. A small hemispherical bowl (PL 111.7:1) has a plain rim, a low ring base and thin walls decorated with an incised wavy pattern below the lip. This type of bowl is quite common at Byzantine sites around Jerusalem such as Ramat Rahel (Aharoni 1964: PL 22:14) and dates from the mid-sixth to early eighth centuries CE (Magness 1993: 193-194). A cylindrical krater (PL 111.7:2) has a ledge rim, straight walls and a flat base. The sides of the vessel are decorated under the rim with wavy combed lines between two sets of horizontal combed, lines. This vessel is unique, since kraters of the Byzantine period generally have flared sides. Nonetheless, the clay color, rim shape and decoration on the cylindrical krater are all similar to those of kraters characteristic of the end of the Byzantine period (Magness 1993: 206). An amphoriskos with a funnel-shaped neck (PL 111.7:3) is similar to one found in the Cistern 3111 (see the discussion above, Locus 3111, Type 2, PL 111.5:2). A jug (PL 111.7:4) has a narrow neck that widens down towards the shoulder, a loop handle that extends from below the rim to the shoulder and a cylindrical body that tapers down to a button base. Almost the entire height of the jug's body is ribbed. We did not find a parallel for this type of jug. A jug (PL 111.7:5) has a flared, square rim and a short neck that tapers towards the rim, a loop handle that extends from the rim to the shoulder and a body that is elongated and elliptical, ending in a concave base. Similar jugs were found in Cistern 3111 (see the discussion above, Locus 3111, Type 3, Variant 1, PL 111.5:3-5). A lantern (PL 111.7:6) has a vertical round handle on the upper part of the vessel and a narrow neck that widens towards its base. The body of the lantern is spherical and perforated with holes in its upper part. The vessel was made from three separate pieces consisting of a handle, neck and body, which were connected when leather hard. It is assumed that the opening for inserting fuel was in the side of the vessel. Lanterns like this one have occasionally been found at Byzantine sites around Jerusalem, for instance at Khirbet Siyar el-Ghanam between Bethlehem and Jerusalem, dating from the sixth century CE (Corbo 1955: Fot. 73:2, 4). CONCLUSIONS The three structures in Areas III and XII were only partially exposed and their plan is incomplete. Mazar dated the construction of these buildings to the late Byzantine period, to the reign of Justinian I (527-565 CE), and their destruction to the Persian conquest of 614 CE (B. Mazar 1971: 35). However, the suggested construction date is not supported by the large quantity of coins found in Locus 12018, which is the only locus of clean fill beneath the floor of a room in the house from Area XII. This fill contained no material later than the fourth or early fifth century CE, implying an earlier date for the construction of the structures. Since no other excavation was carried out beneath the Byzantine houses in Areas III and XII, no remains predating them have been found in those areas. Mazar pointed out the great importance of these areas for the history of the city and suggested that the western 243</page><page sequence="246">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN Pl. IIL7. Locus 12038. No. Object Reg.

Consequently, it is of primary importance to conduct further excavations in this area in order to investigate these key questions of the history of Jerusalem. BIBLIOGRAPHY Aharoni, Y. 1956.

Greek inscription on krater rim (Photo 111.52) A fragment of the rim of a Byzantine krater (Locus 3042, Reg. No. Ill) bears a four-line inscription in dark ink. A - - . . .KICOCAKRI AIA I The first letter of line 2 might be a N, a A, an A or part of a M. In his registration note, B. Mazar suggested reading the name N[ap]iciGGoÄ in line 2 and 8(i)vÃ¡(pia) in line 3, but the latter at least is unlikely, for SrÄ¼vapia is never abbreviated this way in inscriptions or papyri. One is tempted to restore the well-known formula: AÃ²Ã§ ico Scivi KpiGiÄ¼v Sia tÃ²v Ã´sÃ¯va ("Give barley to so-and-so through so- and-so"). The abbreviation KPI for KpiGiÄ¼v is quite common.1 However, the remains of letters in line 2, though they may form the ending of a feminine name in the dative, do not yield a plausible name; moreover, the I in the fourth line is clearly isolated and seems more likely to be a number than the initial or symbol of a personal name. We cannot suggest a plausible reading of this inscription. Photo 111.52. Greek inscription on krater rim. 2. Greek mosaic inscription (Photo III.53) A mosaic pavement in Room 12010 (Area XII) bears a three-line inscription in black tesserae within a square frame (1.1x1.15 m). The letters are 7 cm high. The white background is decorated with florets and sprigs. The inscription was previously published by S. Applebaum, B. Isaac and Y. Landau2 from a photograph which appeared in Qadmoniot 5 (1972), p. 85. In their edition the text is given as follows: EÅ¯ti )x[ÅÃ§ toÃ¯Ã§ co8s [fÄ¼]Ä¶ODGlV Photo III.53. Mosaic with Greek inscription. 246</page><page sequence="249">GREEK INSCRIPTIONS FROM AREAS III AND XII Though the editors do not provide a translation, their restoration of the beginning of line 3 (fÄ¼KODGiv, with a rough breathing, the present participle of fÄ¼Keiv) implies that they interpreted the text as meaning "Good luck to those who come here". Since the inscription was probably symmetrical, it seems reasonable to surmise that there was space for only one character before the K, which justifies the editors' reading. However, the verb fÄ¼Keiv is consistently used with prepositions with accusative indicating motion, like eÃ­Ã§, napÃ¤ or rcpÃ³Ã§, or with adverbs of motion, like ev0Ã¡5e or Ã´eupo, whereas co 8e rarely indicates motion ("hither") and is usually found in the local sense ("here"), especially in the Roman-Byzantine period. It seems better, therefore, to suggest a different restoration of line 3. The most likely is [oiJkodgiv, "those who live (here)". A diphthong with I would not take much more space than a single letter; alternatively, the word might have been written phonetically, with an H or Y instead of the diphthong. Though the spelling rjicoÃ§ for OÃKOÃ is known,3 a substitution of Y for OI seems more common,4 and thus the reading ukodgiv is no less likely than fÄ¼Kouaiv. The formula "Good luck to..." is common on objects intended for personal use, as well as at the entrance of buildings, in both the public and the private domain. Good luck is invoked upon the builder or builders,5 on those who enter,6 or on the members of the family (Stephen, his wife and children in an as yet unpublished mosaic inscription from Caesarea7). The latter is decorated with Christian symbols, the absence of which, in the case of our inscription, is noteworthy. NOTES 1 M.

The cisterns contained a rich concentration of pottery lamps and figurines as well as several stone molds for producing lamps. Based on the numismatic finds, the contents of the cisterns were dated to the late third to early fourth centuries CE (Baramki 1936: 3-10). Seven figurine fragments of the same type (Photo III. 54) discovered in the Temple Mount excavations (Mazar 1971: 35-36) are discussed here. Four were discovered in Area III, one in Area XII and one in Area VII. The exact provenance of a seventh figurine found in the excavations is unknown. An eighth fragment (p. 239, Fig. 111.12) also appears to be of the Beit Nattif type. Photo III.54. Beit Nattif figurines (scale 2:3). 248</page><page sequence="251">BEIT NATTIF FIGURINES FROM THE TEMPLE MOUNT EXCAVATIONS A. FEMALE FIGURINES 1. Woman with hands resting on the stomach (PL 111.8:1) Area III, Locus 3066, Reg. No. 5018; bright orange clay, white slip. This is a fragment depicting the lower part of a nude woman facing forward and probably standing on a base. The body is full and round. The palms of the hands rest on a protruding stomach, in the center of which is a round depression representing the navel. The fingers are long and curved. The genital area is flat and the genitalia are not depicted. The thighs are solid and full. There are thick bracelets on the ankles and right arm. Parallels to this type of figurine are exhibited in the Louvre and Israel Museums (Singer 1993: 16, Figs. 13-14). 2. Woman with raised arms (PL 111.8:2) Area III, Locus 3067, Reg. No. 1907y; yellow clay, white slip and traces of black paint. These are two fragments from the same figurine, one of the head and the other of the lower section of the body up to the middle of the stomach. The two fragments were found next to one another and were given the same basket number. On the lower fragment the stomach is prominent and the thighs are full. The genital area is flat and the genitalia are not depicted. There are thick bracelets around the ankles. Traces of black paint are preserved on the right ankle and a black horizontal stripe at the bottom of the feet denotes the base upon which the figurine stands. The head of the figurine is wide and the chin is pointed. On the head is a tall, cylindrical hat decorated with diagonal stripes. The coiffure consists of a row of curls around the face of the figure. The arched eyebrows are very long and extend to a triangular nose. The mouth is small and is no wider than the nose. There are no traces of the eyes, which were probably delineated with paint that has not survived. Plain hoop earrings are depicted in relief on the ears. Traces of black paint are visible around the contours of the face. This figurine belongs to the group of nude female figurines, of which there are three types. In the first two types, one or both hands rest on the stomach or cover the genitalia. In the third type of figurine, the arms are raised and a thin clay connection joins them to the head. The figurine under discussion apparently belongs to the third type, since a clay connection to the left arm protrudes from the head. Parallels to this type of figurine were found in both cisterns at Beit Nattif (Singer 1993: 13-16, Figs. 7-8). B. HEADS 1. Female head (Pl. 111.8:3) Area III, Locus 3042, Reg. No. 1717y; yellow clay, white slip and traces of black paint. The head of the figurine is wide and ends in a pointed chin. There is a cylindrical hat, broken at the top, on the head. The coiffure is arranged around the face in stylized curls that are emphasized with black paint. The hair ends in two spiral braids. The eyebrows are arched and extend to a triangular nose, below which is a small well-shaped mouth. The back of the figurine, of which only the contour of the left shoulder is preserved, was also mold-made. 2. Female head (Pl. 111.8:4) Area VII, Locus 7072, Reg. No. 236-1; orange clay, bright orange slip and traces of black paint. The head of the figurine is elliptical and the chin is pointed. On the head is a cylindrical headdress decorated with vertical stripes. The hair is arranged in clusters of locks around the head and down to the cheek line. Black paint emphasizes the hairline and the headdress. The figurine has a large and excep- tionally prominent nose. The eyebrows are almost imperceptible and the large eyes are depicted in black paint. The style of the head is slightly less rigid than the uniform style of figurine heads discovered in Area III; this figurine was probably the product of a different workshop. Parallels to both female heads were discovered in both cisterns at Beit Nattif (Singer 1993: 18). 3. Male head (Pl. 111.8:5) Area XII, Locus 12008, Reg. No. 1919Z; orange clay and white slip. This is a fragment of the head of a male figurine. The head is wide and the chin is pointed. The facial features are similar to those of the female figurines, with arched eyebrows, a triangular nose and a small, well-shaped mouth. The eyes were probably depicted with paint that has not survived. The coiffure consists of three carefully combed rows of hair close to the head and a ponytail along the right side. There are traces of white slip on the hair. 249</page><page sequence="252">Pl. III. 8. Beit Nattif figurines. CHAPTER TWENTY 250 1 2</page><page sequence="253">Pl. III. 8.

C. Mounted horseman (PL 111.8:6) Provenance unknown; orange clay, white slip and traces of red and black paint. This is a figurine of a cavalryman on a horse. The rider's head and lower body are missing, as are the lower part of the horse and its hindquarters. The horse is portrayed in a schematic manner. Its mane is fashioned from diagonal lines accentuated by red paint. The ears protrude to the sides. No trace remains of the eyes, bridle or harness, which were probably depicted with paint. The body of the cavalryman is portrayed in a frontal view with his left hand extending forward to grasp the harness. A belt depicted in relief around the waist of the rider probably girdled a short military tunic. Traces of black paint visible around the contour of the chest constitute a border around the body. Similar figurines of mounted cavalrymen were discovered in Cistern No. 1 at Beit Nattif (Singer 1993: 23-25). D. Crouching animal (Pl. 111.8:7) Area III, Locus 3042, Reg. No. 1728y; orange clay, white slip and traces of red paint. This is a figurine of a crouching animal, apparently a lion. The front of the body is missing. The muscles of the legs are accentuated and prominent. The claws, with remains of red paint on them, are visible at the end of the lion's right foot. The beginning of the tail curves to the right and its continuation is broken. Though no parallels were found for this figurine, it undoubtedly belongs to the family of Beit Nattif figurines. Not only is it similar to the horse and camel figurines in the Beit Nattif family, but it is the product of an identical manufacturing technique, including the use of white slip and color to emphasize the various details. METHOD OF PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION The Beit Nattif figurines discovered in the Temple Mount excavations were produced by a double mold method from which a hollow figurine is derived (Singer 1993: 32-33). The figurines reflect a popular local style with unique characteristics: The human figurines are depicted with emphasis on the front of the body; the heads and eyes are relatively larger than the other body parts. There is a distinctive minimalist style of portraying the facial lines, head coverings and hairstyles by the use of geometric motifs. Some parts of the body, such as the eyes and body contour lines, are depicted with red, black and white paint. The figurines discovered in the Temple Mount excavations in Jerusalem, together with those found at Beit Nattif, may perhaps indicate that the principal workshops producing these figurines operated in the Judean plain and hills. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FIGURINES IN THEIR HISTORICAL SETTING In the late third and early fourth centuries CE, art in the Middle East began to undergo a fundamental change with the decline of Hellenistic influences. This change stemmed primarily from the rise of Christianity as an official religion, bringing with it changes in the perception of culture and crafts. As stated by Avi-Yonah (1944: 107), "In this period of the 'triumph of religion and barbarism' whatever remained alive in art was hostile to western influences." This change is also expressed in the clay figurines of the period, which exemplify the way in which popular local creativeness withdrew from Hellenistic and Roman art and returned to the traditional fundamentals that characterized the cultures of the region. The Beit Nattif figurines discovered in the Temple Mount excavations certainly illustrate these changes. The most common types of figurines in this family are those of nude women whose thighs and stomach are accentuated. Although it is impossible to determine whether these figurines depicted local goddesses, their overt femininity does indicate a connection with fertility (Singer 1993: 81). This subject was now resurrected within local art after having been dormant during the Hellenistic and Roman periods. The figurine of the mounted cavalryman and the parallels to this type found at Beit Nattif were meant to depict mounted warriors. These figurines express a craving for defense and security. The figurine of the crouched animal as a motif of power can also be attributed to this idea. The Beit Nattif figurines should be viewed as proof of the strengthening of the creativity and 253</page><page sequence="256">CHAPTER TWENTY popular beliefs that survived throughout the Hellenistic and Roman periods. It endured in the popular consciousness and found its expression in this period, when Hellenistic influences weakened. It is noteworthy that most of the Beit Nattif figurines found in the Temple Mount excavations came from Area III, where they were concentrated in and around a large cave. The concentration of figurines in one area is perhaps indicative of a popular cult that was conducted in the late third and early fourth centuries CE in or near the cave.
