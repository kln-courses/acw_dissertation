M.HagigahM.Hagigah II.l "The subject of forbidden sexual relations1 may not be expounded in the presence of three, nor the work of creation מעשה כראשית, in the presence of two, nor the work of the chariot, מעשה מרכבה, in the pres ence of one unless he is a sage and understands of his own knowledge."2 Of these three subjects that are not expounded before more than a very few, the reason for two of them is fairly obvious. The investigation of מעשה בראשית, the esoteric aspects of cosmology, and מעשה מרכבה meta physics, taking its name from Ezek l:4f and 10: Iff, are considered to be detrimental to the spiritual and mental state of the believer. Only a few could pursue them without danger to themselves. This is illus trated vividly by the story of "the four who entered the garden"3 and the disastrous consequences which befell three of the sages. The one which is not as obvious is "that one does not expound the laws of prohibited sexual relations, Heb. נילוי עריות, to more than three." In commenting on this prohibition the talmudic rabbis concentrate on the limitation of number, but not the reason for the limitation. They take the repeated expression you shall not reveal the nakedness (Heb. ערוה) in Lev 18 as meaning you should not reveal their mean ing to the many rather than the literal meaning of you shall not have sexual relations.4 R. Ashi is vague when he states that it must mean that the secrets of the forbidden sexual relations may not be expounded 1 Listed in Lev 18. 2 M.Hag.

He likewise states that such a discussion is likely to inflame lustful desires.5 To explain the limitation placed on such discussion because of its sexual nature is not at all convincing since all sorts of sexual matters were discussed by the rabbis openly and in great detail. Is there some thing singular about these particular laws, חוקים, for which no expla nation is offered in the biblical text nor can be explained by rational inference which sets them aside from other □חוקי for which there is no limitation on their discussion? Maharsha does not clarify the issue by saying that it refers to the secrets of the reasons for the prohibition. The apparent reason for the limitation on such discussion is based both on omissions and inclusions in the levitical list. Rashi seems to be on the right track citing some forbidden relations that are not explicitly cited in the passage but are inferred, e.g. a man's daughter by a woman he violated, his father-in-law's mother or his mother-in-law's mother.6 Ibn Ezra, too, realized that there are several omissions which can only be explained by referring to the Oral Tradition, Heb. 7.קבלה We sug gest several specifics more cogent than these that might confuse and upset those not sufficiently grounded in the Oral Tradition which sup plies many explanations to obviate difficulties in the written word. The list of prohibited unions includes practically all of the most obvi ous ones involving consanguinity and close legal relationships. One, very close relationship is missing, namely one's own daughter. This omis sion was bound to startle and perplex the serious student. It is of note that this problem of omission is given scant attention in the tannaitic sources. R. Ile'a argued that the prohibition of a daughter is expressed in Lev 19:29 Do not degrade your daughter and make her a harlot.8 Another rather weak attempt to explain it is to argue that since sexual relations are forbidden with one's grandchild certainly it is forbidden with one's daughter.9 This line of inferential reasoning could be applied to many others which in fact are spelled out in the text. A second strange element in the list is the prohibition involving an uncle and an aunt, each of whom has the same degree of consan guinity to a niece or nephew. Nonetheless a union between uncle and 5 Ibid. 6 Rashi on Sanh. 75a. 7 See Ibn Ezra on Lev 18:14. 8 Sanh. 76a. 9 Rashi to Lev 1:8,9. See also Teb. 51b.</page><page sequence="3">82 SAMUEL TOBIAS LACHS niece is permitted while union between aunt and nephew is forbidden.10 The problem seems to be irreconcilable. Conceivably the reason for the prohibition was based on the family structure. The young, both male and female, were entrusted to the care of the women. An aunt and her nephew were therefore in close proximity to each other, a situa tion which did not obtain with an uncle and his niece. Biblically no distinction between a paternal aunt and a maternal aunt is made, both were forbidden. This raises the problem of Moses' ancestry. According to Ex 6:20 Amram, Moses' father, married his father's sister, Jochebed, and she bore him Aaron and Moses This, according to the levitical law, would have made Moses a mamzer. This marriage was justified and explained by stating that before the revelation at Sinai only mater nal relationships were subject to the laws of prohibited marriages, hence the marriage of Amram and Jochebed was legal." Sa'adia comments that the marriage took place before Jochebed would have been pro hibited to him.12 In all likelihood this was thought to be difficult for many to accept. To this difficulty one could add the prohibition of marrying two sisters in the lifetime of both, Lev 18:18. This raises the problem of Jacob marrying Leah and Rachel which can only be justified on the basis of occurring before Sinai. This is an explanation of last resort. In most cases conflict between actions of pre-Mosaic personages and the laws promulgated at or after Sinai were explained or recon ciled by aggadic treatment. With Leah and Rachel no such explana tion is proffered presumably leaving the majority of readers perplexed. These and other cases could be cited to account for the prohibition of discussing them among more than three. Bet Bet Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel on Festival Offmngs On the three pilgrim festivals every male was expected to bring both a peace-qffaing or חנינה, the pilgrim offering, as well as a festal offering, the ראייה. The pilgrimage, three times a year, is based on Deut 16:16 10 Louis Μ. Epstein, Marriage Laws in the Bible and the Talmud (Cambridge, Mass, Harvard U. Press, 1942) 235 by-passes the problem of consanguinity and states, "The direction of the prohibited degrees of kinship, therefore, always starts with the man. An uncle is to his niece what an aunt is to her nephew, but since we count from the man the directions are different. The uncle counts in lateral direction, for his niece counts in the upward direction, his aunt being next prohibited but a niece is not." "" See Sanh. 58. Onq. to Ex 6:20 emphasizing that Jochebed was Amran's sister. 12 Sa'adia to Ex 6:20.</page><page sequence="4">REREADING SOME TALMUDIC AND MIDRASHIC PASSAGES 83 and Ex 23:14. The pilgrim-offering in the Bible is the שלמים, peace offering (Lev 3:15), and in the Mishnah it is also called חנינה. Only the fat-pieces, the kidneys and the blood were offered on the altar, and the rest was consumed by the one who brought it and by his family. The ראייה or festal offering derives its name from the command to appear in the Temple (lit. appearing). It was to be offered on the first day of the festival and wholly burnt on the altar. The Schools of Shammai and Hillel differ on the minimum to be spent for each. "Bet Shammai say: The ראייה offering must be worth [at least] two pieces of silver, and the festal offering one מעה of silver. Bet Hillel say: The ראייה offering must be worth [at least] one מעה of silver and the festal offering two pieces of silver.'"3 The talmudic comments on the differ ence between the two schools are helpful in explaining their respec tive positions. The School of Shammai requires more to be spent on the ראייה because it is offered up entirely to God, being burnt entirely on the altar. The School of Hillel takes the opposite position. Accord ing to them the hagigah. is more important because in it there are two meals, the entrails offered on the altar and the rest eaten by the fam ily. Each School adds a scriptural argument. The School of Shammai points out that there are more burnt offerings than peace offerings offered on Shavuot. The School of Hillel states that in the case of the princes (see Num 7:87-88) more peace offerings are enjoined than burnt offerings.14 The underlying difference on the cost of the sacrifices is based on their respective theological views which are vastly different. The School of Shammai follows a theocentric approach while the School of Hillel an anthropocentric one. In the pages of this journal I have offered exam pies of these approaches in their rulings on order of the Sabbath and Holiday kiddush and in their aggadic reading of the Creation narrative.15 In advocating spending more on the ראייה that was entirely burnt on the altar the School of Shammai felt that this showed a deeper respect for God than if they spent more for a sacrifice which was to be eaten by the family. The Hillelites with their anthropocentric approach to life as well as to religious ritual said that more should be allocated for the purchase of the חנינה which was to be enjoyed by the family and that the offering of the entrails was sufficient symbolic recognition of the Deity. 13 M.Hag. 1.2. 14 TB Hag. 6a; TJ ibid. 1.2. 15 JSJ 25 (1994) 59-60.</page><page sequence="5">84 SAMUEL TOBIAS LACHS Hagar's Get In depicting the lives of biblical personalities the rabbis superim posed upon them their values and institutions. There are several rea sons for this. One is to ascribe antiquity and thus authority to practices and institutions of their own day, some of which were instituted closer to their own times. For example, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are said to have instituted the morning, afternoon and evening prayers respec tively.16 King Solomon observed the laws of the 17.ערוב Abraham is said to have sent Isaac to the Academy of Shem and Eber.18 One source states that Jacob, while still in the womb was moved to break out of the womb when Rebekah, his mother, passed a synagogue.19 Another reason is that in view of their accepted religious laws and practices they questioned why the early worthies did not, according to the Bible, act in the same fashion. Aggadists were quick to rectify the problem. A striking example of this is that the Bible makes no men tion of a marriage ceremony for Adam and Eve. For this glaring omis sion one rabbi commented that God prepared a lavish wedding and He, Himself, presided over their marriage ceremony.20 A third reason is that on occasion the rabbis were disturbed by the actions of some of their biblical ancestors that they considered less than acceptable. The elaborate plan of deception by Rebekah and Jacob is a notable example and gave rise to many justifications for their actions. One biblical narrative incorporates all three elements, Abraham's expulsion of Hagar (Gen 21). The act appears heartless especially for one like Abraham who is portrayed as the paragon of righteousness. Hagar was, after all, the mother of his son Ishmael, his own flesh and blood, and she was his concubine who did have standing in the family. According to an aggadic tradition Abraham had actually married her. This act of expulsion from the household is made more pathetic in that Abraham sent her out with only some bread and a skin of water (Gen 21:14). Contrast this with Abraham's generosity and hospitality toward strangers {ibid. 18: Iff). The rabbis, in order to exculpate Abraham, saw in two words of the story that Abraham wrote out a bill of divorce for Hagar. The first is in the phrase, Cast out (Heb. נרש) that slave woman 16 TB Ber. 26b. " TB Et 21b; Shab. 14b; Yeb. 21a. 18 Gen.R 25.27; 26.11. 19 Ibid., 63. 20 PRE 12 et al.</page><page sequence="6">REREADING SOME TALMUDIC AND MIDRASHIC PASSAGES 85 and and her son {ibid. 21:10). The verb נ1~ש yields נרושי, divorce. The second is in the word וישלחה, and he sent her away [ibid. 21:14). The verb שלח is used specifically in the Bible for divorce (Deut 24:1,3,4).21 This interpretation ascribes antiquity to the bill of divorce, placing it in pre-Sinaitic times. It likewise softens a bit the harshness of the ex pulsion scene since divorce proceedings during the rabbinic era required the husband to pay to his wife the amount to which she was entitled as stipulated in her ketuba. By this interpretation Abraham acted fairly by providing Hagar the where-with-all to support herself and her son Ishmael. By this act of divorce and its monetary accompaniment Hagar and Ishmael were provided for and Abraham was exonerated from any criticism of harsh behavior. Two Two Two Celestial Thrones "One verse says, His throne was tongues of flame (Dan 7:9), and another says, Thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took His seat (ibid.).22 There is no contradiction, one [throne] for Him, and one for David, this is the view of R. Aqiba. R. Jose the Galilean said to him, Aqiba, how long will you make the Shekhinah as profane! Rather it means one is for Justice and the other for Righteousness. Did he accept this explanation from him or not? Come and hear: One is for Justice, the other for Righteousness.23 This is the view of R. Alibi. R. Eleazar said to him, Aqiba, what do you have to do with Aggadah? Go to the laws of ritual defilement through signs of leprosy and tent-covering. It means one for a throne to sit upon, the stool for a footrest, for it is said, The heaven heaven is My throne and the earth is My footstool (Isa 66: l)."24 All three explanations are examples of aggadic fantasy. Why were both R. Jose the Galilean and R. Eleazar b. Azariah so critical of R. Aqiba's interpretations? The reason for their criticism of his state ment "that one was for David" was not that a mortal should not occupy a seat with God and thereby "profane the Shekhinah." The verse in Ps 110:1 The Lord said to my lord, Sit at My right hand while I make your enemies your footstool has been interpreted as referring to Abraham because 21 Ibid. 30. 22 The plural implies two thrones, but the beginning of the verse refers only to one. 23 In Sank 38b the reading is "mercy." He probably derived his interpretation from Ps 89:15, righteousness and justice are the base of Your throne. 24 TB Hag 14a. See also TB Sank. 38b with variants.</page><page sequence="7">86 SAMUEL TOBIAS LACHS of reference to Melchizedek in the psalm (v. 4).2d There is no indica tion that anyone objected to this designation of a mortal sitting next to God's throne. The reason for their objection is that reference to David means the Messiah who then occupies one of the thrones.26 This was a dangerous teaching since the Christians maintain that Jesus, the messianic figure, is said to sit at the right hand of God: "But when this one had offered for all times a single sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God, then to wait until his enemies should be made a stool for his feet."27 R. Eleazar b. Azariah's objection to Aqiba's second explanation, suggested by R. Jose the Galilean, that the two thrones were for Justice and Righteousness (var. Mercy) is that sepa rates two aspects of Divinity thereby impinging on the monotheistic concept of God. Louis Finkelstein, in citing this passage, makes the point, "In his student days he [R. Aqiba] retained the simple anthro pomorphic concept which, as a shepherd, he had shared with other unlettered peasants."28 This is not convincing. R. Aqiba's comments are no more anthropomorphic and simplistic than those of R. Eleazar b. Azariah who was of aristocratic birth. In support of this interpretation of the passage it is of note that in the parallel, TB Sank. 38b, it appears in material dealing with polemi cal interchanges between Jews and minim, many of whom were cer tainly Judeo-Christians who held that Jesus was the Davidic messiah. TBTB Ta'anit 4a . . the congregation of Israel further asked and said, Ruler of the World! Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm (Cant 8:6). The Holy One, blessed be He, replied to her: My daughter, you have asked for something that is visible at times and not visible at others. I will make of you something that is visible at all times, as it is said, See, I have engraved you on the palms of My hands, your walls are ever before before Me" (Isa 49:16).29 The assumption of the commentators is that in the proof verse See I have engraved you upon the palms of My hands this 25 TB Ned 32b; Lev.R 25. 26 See TB Sank. 98a; RH 25a; Mid.Ps. 5; 75 II ARM 45. et al. 27 Heb 10:12-13.

Although the palms are not covered by garments the engraving would not generally be visible unless specifically held up to view.3' The visible seal (Heb. חותם) refers to a signet or seal made of stone or metal and worn on a cord around the neck which would be visible on the chest. The signet was also worn as a ring on the finger.32 Clearly when they are taken off they are no longer visible. What is required is a seal which is always visible. The first part of the verse makes no mention of a seal. This can, however, be supplied from the second part of the verse in Is. Your walls (Heb. חומותיך) are constantly before Me. By a reversal of the letters of חומוחיך, common practice in midrashic interpretation, it yields "]ΤΪΏΓΠΠ, "your seals." They represent the seals of circumcision, the sign of the covenant between God and Israel, first entered into by Abraham,33 which is sealed in the flesh and hence always visible. Note that the phrase "are constantly before me" in this second half of the verse adds support to this reading of the passage. Note also the phrase "and the covenant that You have sealed (Heb. שחתמת) in our flesh" in the birkkat hamazon, the grace after meals. Deut.R.Deut.R. 6.3 "This is what the text says, For they are a gracejul wreath upon your head (Prov 1:9). The rabbis say: The words of the Torah are grace in your poverty (Heb. לרשיוחך). How? When a learned man becomes old all come and flock around him and ask him of matters of Torah.5'34 The difficult word לרשיוחך is a play on לראשך, "your head". The com mentators understand it as meaning "poverty" although in this form it appears to be a hapax in rabbinic literature. The more common word for "poverty," using the same root, is 35.רשות Their reasoning is that when a man becomes old and feeble he becomes poor because he 30 Cf. Rashi ad be. suggests that when one is naked both the arm and the chest are visible but not visible when he is dressed. 31 H. Malter in his edition of M. Ta'anit to obviate the problem suggests that kapayim means fingers! 32 See M. Pope, Song of Songs (Anchor Bible, Garden City, N.Y., 1970) 666. 33 See Ex.R. 19 "the seal (hotam) of Abraham our father." 34 Deut.R. 6.3. 35 E.g. Mid. Ps. 24; Yal, Gen. 147; Gen.R. 89; Yal. Koh. 971.</page><page sequence="9">SAMUEL TOBIAS LACHS cannot earn a living. Mirkin, in his commentary, carries it a bit fur ther saying that people generally shun the elderly as they shun the poor. The Soncino translation of the Midrash actually translates the word "for your old age." This is a highly forced explanation. While it may be true that the elderly, particularly the indigent, may be neglected by society, it is a bit much to compare all the elderly to the poor. It is therefore better to read lereshutekha not meaning "your poverty" but your "private domain," a common use of reshut in the literature. Despite your old age, if you are learned people will not avoid you. To the contrary, people still frequent your home to learn words of Torah from you. This is the reward for a life of study whether you are rich or poor. Death Death by Divine Decree In a talmudic passage citing various explanations for the various lengths of years allotted to humans and the duration of the process of dying, one sage commented that death at the age of sixty is called "death by Divine decree." Heb. מיתה בידי שמים for one who reaches it is truly fortunate.36 The proof verse cited is Job 5:26, You will come in jull vigor to to the grave, Heb. 37.תבא בכלח אלי קבר The explanation for the choice of this verse is that the gematria of בכלח is sixty and sixty is said to be the on-set of old age.38 As appealing as this explanation is, in no way does it indicate that death at sixty is the result of a Divine decree. This missing element can, however, be supplied if the verse be read, "you shall come to the grave [at sixty] by the vigor of God בכלח אל," duplicating אל from אלי. 36 IB MQ_ 28a. 37 Alternate translation of bekhleh is "in ripe of age" (JPSNT). The meaning of the term is uncertain. See M. Pope, Job (Anchor Bible, Garden City, N.Y., 1965) 47. 38 See M. Abot V.21.</page></plain_text>
