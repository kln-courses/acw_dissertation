On the level of a genetic imagery that is recurrent to the point of the obses- sional, for instance, there seems to be little chance for the identification, much less the survival, of a family tree threatened in Nerval's case by the chimerae of youth, in Proust's by the disillusionments and sterility of old age, and in Mallarme's by the improbability of even being born. But this appears to be an insoluble problem only as long as we remain stuck at the naively elementary level of the image or theme. For once the question is enlarged enough to include the specifically textual moment of writing that is implied in the constitution of any theme, no matter how negative or barren, things begin to assume a somewhat different and more promising shape. It can be argued, and some of the most productive readings of these authors have in fact argued, that it is precisely by writing out those images of chimerae that Nerval's text passes beyond them into its maturity, and that by writing about the impossibility of being born that Mallarme's text can overcome this same obstacle in exemplary fashion. In a similar way, A la recherche du temps perdu could be said to constitute in its very existence as text the discovery or recovery of that which is stated as lost and in need of search throughout: the moment of its own conception and birth. The appar- ent concatenation of theme and structure that results is both circular and complementary, the beginning of the writing of the text we have before us coinciding with the end of the thematic search contained and recounted YFS 79, Literature and the Ethical Question, ed.

This specular system of relationships established between beginning and end as well as between structure and statement effects at the same time a figural and temporal balance that helps to restore the picture of a symbolist family of writers or a genealogy of symbolism that would include the branch running from Nerval to Proust. By insisting on the various moments of negativity that must be faced in order to be overcome in the necessary passage and return from birth to youth and from youth to maturity, death, and rebirth, Nerval, Mallarme, and Proust make of the symbolic correspon- dence between theme and statement, or image and text, a task that is to be effectuated across time rather than something that is given as immediately accessible. "The only paradises worthy of the name," Proust reminds us near the end of his recherche, "are ones we have lost."1I Hence the ambivalence of the critical interpretations with which this brand of symbolism tends to be assessed: when the negativity inherent in symbolist poetics is seen as the turning back, by means of a mere aesthetic representation, to what by defini- tion remains buried in the past, it is considered a formalism and a flight from objective reality; but when it is seen as the prelude to an act of understand- ing that recuperates all the discrepant levels of lived experience by bringing to light the synthesis of a universal meaning, it is considered a necessary step within an ongoing engagement with social and historical realities. In any event, whether they are seen as regressive or prophetic, "symbolist" writers like Nerval, Mallarme, and Proust become in this way corresponding moments in a larger family history that includes romanticism as its imme- diate predecessor and our own postmodernity as its heritage. In the case of Proust, one can begin to appreciate the stakes of this genetic scheme more clearly by focussing on the debate that gets played out around the question of "memory" inA la recherche du temps perdu. What is the role of memory in Proust's text, with its concomitant stress on ques- tions of time and especially on time past? Although the general tendency in the first part of this century was to emphasize those aspects of the Proustian oeuvre that tied it firmly to a past seemingly closed off to everything but nostalgia, of late we have begun to distinguish ourselves from precisely these first readers of Proust by situating the Recherche at the furthest pos- sible remove from this sort of nostalgia.2 Such changes in the barometric readings of literary masterpieces help to remind us that rather than compos- 1.

Thus Gilles Deleuze, with his avowed interest and investment in the postmodern condition of the contemporary age, seems anxious to align Proust as closely with us as possible by distancing him from a lopsided orientation toward the past when he says that, "no matter how important its role, memory only occurs here as the means of an apprenticeship that exceeds it both in goal and principle. The Search is turned toward the future, not toward the past."3 The future the recherche is turned toward starts to sound very much like our own present when Proust is later credited with having found a truth capable of "displacing" the age- old Platonism of the Logos by turning thought itself into a form of creation, a mode of "production," or a kind of "machine" to be put into public "service" (134, 177, 184). Despite significant differences of emphasis, we find once again the familiar pattern in which the origin or beginning-doubly present in Deleuze's counterreference to the Platonic conception of reminiscences or "memory"-is only ameans, a necessary, and necessarily negative detour towards the goal or end of a historical process in progress, and of which we would be the latest avatars. The question remains, however, whether any simply temporal scheme can do justice to the complexity of a text that is constantly attempting to articulate the passage of time with the simultaneity of a multiplicity of points in space. Memory in Proust is never simply a matter of the before and after, or past and future, of a completed entity, it always includes at the same time the necessary reference to a spatial structure constituted around the mutually dependent elements of an inside/outside relationship. The locus of this differential relation between interior and exterior is of course nothing other than the self-conscious subject itself, which is in turn composed of the delicate interplay between mind and empirical reality. A great deal is at issue in passages such as the one where Marcel claims that, "at last, by continuing to follow from inside to outside the states of mind simul- taneously juxtaposed within me, and before reaching the actual horizon enclosing them, I can discover pleasures of another kind. . ." (1:87). The pleasure that is intimated at here proleptically would itself be the subject's ultimate discovery in the work of art of a perfect adequation between tem- poral duration ("continuity") and spatial extension ("simultaneous jux- taposition"). Drawing attention to the nature and importance in A la re- cherche du temps perdu of this spatializing process of juxtaposition that 3.

But when Poulet then goes on to quote the reference to Elstir's painting- "Elstir was incapable of looking at a flower without immediately transplanting it into that interior garden where we are forced to remain forever" (2:943)-we can see that things are considerably more complicated than a one-step process. For de- spite the narrator's tone of discouragement or despair at this point, it is not simply a case here of bringing the outside inside, unilaterally transporting or transplanting objective reality into the imaginary, even and especially if this segment of the movement first appears as life imprisonment. Unlike Swann, then, Elstir can become a model for the narrator precisely because he refuses to be confined within this prison that seems to separate empirical experi- ence once and for all from the ideal space of a mind.5 Clearly, what is of most consequence in this passage, and even emblem- atic for the novel as a whole, is not just the bringing of the flowers into an interior garden-which can always appear as a defensive strategy of security and protection as well as a form of alienation-but rather the indisputable fact that in the act of painting they have in some way been put back out into the world again. It can only be by "bringing whatever [has been] experienced back out of the shadows," the narrator reminds us at the end of the novel, that we can ever hope to have access to anything like our "true life, a life finally discovered and illuminated." And the sole means of achieving this exteriorization, of course, is through the "production of a work of art" (3:879,895). The passage in question on Elstir's painting, in fact, goes out of its way to emphasize the importance of just such an outward turn of thought. It stages a mock confrontation in Mme Verdurin's dining-room between the living roses that once provided the painter's-model and Elstir's portrait of them. Whereas the "real" flowers are available now only through 4. Georges Poulet, L'Espace proustien (Paris, Gallimard, 1963). Further references in the text. 5. Claudia Brodsky's interpretation of the Recherche is interesting for the way it suggests the inadequacy of the model of memory presumed by most readers of Proust, but by using Swann in order to do so it remains overly tied to the binary structure of experi- ence/recollection it seeks to displace. It may be true that the Recherche never manages to recapture anything, but that is not to say it does nothing to the idea that there was something out there to capture in the first place. See, "Remembering Swann," in The Imposition of Form (Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1987).</page><page sequence="5">154 Yale French Studies Mme Verdurin's passive recollection of them, Elstir's portrait, actually there and propped against a chair, serve to bring la Patronne and her idealized reminiscences face to face with something that is neither natural nor imagi- nary, but which nonetheless "almost resembles them." What functions as the tablepiece for the luncheon in question, then, is neither the objective reality of the flowers, long gone, nor Elstir himself, who has fallen from favor, but rather this portrait of objectified thought. As such it is "almost," but not quite, equal to both sides of the inside/outside relationship, and so is finally identified by the narrator as an unheard of flower, "a new variety with which the painter, like an ingenious horticulturist, had embellished the family of Roses" (2:943). Taking a hint from the narrator's own horticultural comparison, it could be argued that the process which is first described as simply "transplanting" a rose from one soil to another when it goes from objective reality to the imagination next resembles the insertion of an entirely foreign "transplant" when the inner rose is put back out to enhance, embellish, and transform the family of Roses-both empirical and ideal-it also serves to replace. It would hardly be an exaggeration at this point to say that the operation engaged in by the self when it transplants between inner and outer gardens is at least twofold: it is both an interiorization that transports the self-same flower from one place to another, from world to mind, for instance; and an exteriorization that leaves its mark on both regions in such a way that neither inside nor outside would ever be able to remain the same.6 This passage on Elstir's paintings seems merely to confirm in the language of flowers, or rhetorical figures, what we have known all along, or will be reminded of once again later on by Proust. The transfer from outside to inside is a grafting operation as well as a simple transplanting. In other words, the painting of ideal ressemblances must also be supplemented by a kind of nonmimetic graphesis, or writing, in which the subject will have to participate if it is to survive at all. But if the result of such grafting is the production of a truly unheard-of variety of flower, "a new variety of roses which without him would have never been known," then how can we still call that a survival, and who or what would be the "identity" that is thus preserved as something totally different? One of the most comprehensive readings of the Recherche from this point of view is undoubtedly that of Gerard Genette, which is scattered through a number of essays written at various times and for differing con- 6. The narrator himself is not wholly unaware of the complexity of this double move- ment when he dubs the transplanting operation of his own writing "translation": "I realized that the essential book, the only true book, is not something a great writer has to create, since it already exists in each one of us, but rather it has to be translated. The task and duty of a writer are those of a translator" (3:890).</page><page sequence="6">KEVIN NEWMARK 155 texts, but which aims above all at refining and complicating the terms of Poulet's original insights.7 Thus, Genette is able to retain the basic focus on the subjective phenomena of time and space while also accounting for the additional complexity introduced into this dual scheme by the passage in the novel to an overtly written dimension. By translating slightly what Poulet sees as a rivalry between experiences of time and space into the complementary rhetorical structures of metaphor and metonymy through which these experiences are articulated textually, Genette is able to accom- modate the sequential and diachronic movement of a narrative to the jux- tapositioning within it of simultaneous layers of subjective consciousness. Rather than forming mutually exclusive experiences, time and space are necessarily related to each other in a unified system of textual connections produced by the narrative itself between spatiotemporal analogies (meta- phor) and spatiotemporal proximities (metonymy). The key to this system is the writing subject, who is nothing but the sequential narrative, or temporal unfolding, of the cumulative analogies that can finally be revealed to exist between all the spatial relations of outside to inside that constitute the experience of a self. The obvious model for this totalizing coordination of spatiotemporal identities and proximities is provided of course by Proust's "petite Madeleine." According to Genette, the Madeleine is both metaphorical and metonymical since it functions both as a temporal identity and a spatial proximity: "the true Proustian miracle is not that one Madeleine steeped in a cup of tea would taste the same as another madeleine steeped in tea, and would awaken its memory; it is rather that this second madeleine resusci- tates along with it a bedroom, a house, an entire town . . ." ("Metonymie chez Proust," 57-58). The only thing that is missing in this excellent de- scription of the miracle of resuscitation is the recognition that when the temporal metaphor and the spatial metonymy that constitute this Madeleine are then swallowed and taken into the body of the narrator, there is produced at the same time-but "where?" is the question-the supple- mentary analogy between inside (madeleine) and outside (madeleine) as well as an unexpected proximity between before (youthful experiences) and after (adult vocation). Obviously, the confused exclamations of the narrator himself at this point- "the essence was not in me, it was me.... Clearly, the truth I am seeking is not in [the steeping Madeleine], but in me" (1:45)- do not begin to do justice to the complexity of this operation. Where is the truth, then, in relation to the subject that experiences it-in him, with him, 7.

Had he recognized the answer to this question at this point, the narrator would not have needed the following three thousand pages of stumbling around in the dark to understand his vocation as author. Closer to the truth than the simple miracle of the Madeleine, perhaps, is Genette's characterization of the "auto-illustrative" structure of the novel. Such a structure would, like the madeleine, combine analogies and proximities, but it could only be said to come into being when the narrator has passed from the status of mere personage to that of self-conscious author. This moment would constitute, according to Genette, "the Text, in the full sense of the term." Still, the question would seem not so much whether there is something like a "text," for the existence of the Recherche is as undeniable as it is productive of endless critical commentary, but rather to document with as much analytic precision as possible what the text is in the full sense of the term. This would entail looking for the actual constitution by the text of the claim for the text that the dimensions of time, space, and the self can appear in their "truth" ["la vraie vie"] only by means of the completed text. And it would further require an examination of the consequences of such an auto- illustrative claim by the text for the text in order to determine whether the resulting "life" in it is produced as a continuous identity or a mutant and unrecognizable species. Such, at any rate, is the reading strategy adopted by Paul de Man when, with respect to slightly different claims made in the novel, he tests the aesthetic and metaphysical statements made in the text on reading against the literary practices illustrated by the text read and finds an irreducible discrepancy between them.8 Such a discrepancy could in fact be said to account as well for Marcel's befuddlement when he tastes the Madeleine in "Combray." It could be that this moment of confusion, the overcoming of which constitutes the thematic development of the rest of the novel, is of interest for more than just its thematic role. Rather than forming the first step in the successfully completed search for self-identity recounted in its wake, this unresolved split in the narrator between what he is and what he can say he is may be the only legitimate thing the text can ever do about what it is saying. If this were to be the case, and only a detailed analysis of specific passages can be used either to contest or to bear out such a hypothesis, then considerable care would have to be taken in reading not only the self-assured pronouncements made by the narrator at the end of his vocational itinerary, but also in reading those critics who, like Genette, take these truth claims at face value.9 The binary 8.

There could be no better description than this, in fact, for the autoillustrative writing of the Recherche, which, as text, is both the writing self and the means of access to this self. That there should be not only a grave uncertainty about the out- come of this search, but an uncertainty as well as to who or what (self) could ever write about the uncertainty of its (own) coming into being, deserves to be taken seriously, seriously enough, at least, to return once again to the supposed source of the journey. It was Harry Levin who pointed out the link between the singularity of the Madeleine experience and the figural pattern through which it oper- ates. 10 This pattern, which does not remain unchanged by its rearticulation in Proust's novel, is basically that of Biblical exegesis: "the name and shape of that little tea-cake are traceable to the shells that pilgrims wore on their hats as badges of their vocation. Let us make no mistake; we are at the commencement of a religious pilgrimage" (390). Whatever one thinks of the etymological gesture that attempts to link the name as well as the shape of the Madeleine directly back to the shell and emblematized pilgrimage it stands for, it would be difficult to deny the structural affinity which the Madeleine scene in the novel exhibits with certain easily recognizable topoi of the Biblical tradition. Thus M. H. Abrams is wholly within the spirit of the text when he suggests that the Recherche is actually "a displaced and reconstituted theology, or else a secularized form of devotional experi- ence."11 Even French critics, preoccupied as they are with local historical, thematic, and formal concerns, have had to note the obvious ritual subtext for the tea-soaked Madeleine: "allowing for the numerous religious con- notations.... I am tempted to compare this gesture to the Christian rite of communion: the infusion and Madeleine replacing the bread and wine; the aunt officiates and holds out the host: 'this is my body, this is my blood."'12 It becomes an easy matter at this point to reestablish all sorts of historical and generic connections between Proust's text and the rest of the literary canon, constituting in this way a comprehensive system of classification in which the individual text communicates with the universality of the tradi- tion and the unique moment with an entire history. By conforming to the 10. Harry Levin, The Gates of Horn (New York, Oxford University Press, 1963). Fur- ther references in the text. 11. M. H. Abrams, Natural Supernaturalism (New York, W. W.

Such innova- tions and displacements would include the formal devices of the auto- biographical voice and the figural language used to constitute it which are analyzed by Genette, as well as the highly complex and untraditional forms of sexuality that are suggested by both Lejeune and Doubrovsky. Finally, though, that the madeleine can function simultaneously as an original psy- chic symbol for Marcel's (or Proust's) repressed sexuality, as a derived meta- physical symbol for the possibility of rediscovering life after death (that is, the transcendence and redemption of meaning), and as a formal symbol for the "symbolist" program of its author, merely confirms the symmetrical dynamic of exchange that mediates here between the individual work and its place within a historical and generic continuum of aesthetic forms. Such intertextual schemes of coordination of thematic statement and poetic structure are already familiar to us from their implication on the intratextual level of the Recherche as well, and they always manage to by- pass the essential question regarding the status of this totalizing system within a given text. They do so by assuming its unproblematic completion within any given text in order to compare with it a number of other texts in the same tradition, thereby establishing a coherent system of classification out of the similarities and differences that are constituted between them. The question, once again, is not whether writing the oeuvre is possible for the subject-since clearly this writing has occurred-nor whether such writing can communicate across differences of time and geography with all the versions of the same model (in this case, the liturgical rite of the eu- charist)-since clearly it does-but rather to test the claim that the passage leading from individual experience to writing, from death-in-life to "the true life," which is accomplished by the structure of the symbol, can be made accessible to the subjects whose ultimate definition and identity de- pend on it. In other words, does the beginning communicate, or commune with the end of the work in such a way that the initial question, "what does it mean? " (1:45), can be fully accounted for without disturbing the voice that would consume and reverse it in the final assertion, "and I now understood that my past life was nothing but the material for a literary work" (3:899)? As Genette aptly notes, the function of the madeleine is precisely that of providing connections, and first of all a connection from the incomprehensi- ble and obsessional stutter of the first section of the novel to the three- thousand pages that spread out along symmetrical axes from it and eventually redeem it. Until the moment Marcel, now a full-grown man, and at the invitation of his mother, tastes once again the madeleine drenched in tea, his past is restricted to the repetitive scene of bending to the paternal</page><page sequence="10">KEVIN NEWMARK 159 law by climbing the stairs at Combray to his bed and the separation this means from his mother. Even though there is in the nightly ritualistic kiss he receives from his mother a prefiguration of a "communion of peace," these opening pages stand clearly under the sway of an arbitrary and inex- plicable law of the father. At that terrible moment on the staircase when Marcel is all but lost in the eyes of his mother as well as in his own, the father who grants a last-minute stay is compared to Abraham himself: "I stood there without daring to make a move; there he was before us . . . with the same gesture Abraham is making in the Benozzo Gozzoli print that M. Swann had given me . . ." (1:36). And like the old testament law represented by Abraham, the law that speaks to Marcel through his own father is like the dead letter separated from its spirit, since the boy remains as blind to its ultimate meaning as he does to the source of its power, for "when [his] anxieties had been assuaged, [he] was no longer able to understand them" (1:43). To be saved like Isaac, then, is to be condemned at the same time to a formalistic, ritualistic repetition of an empty law that awaits its fulfillment in the incarnation, the word made flesh, the transcendence of meaning. The economy that regulates this fulfillment is a dialectic of loss, or sacrifice, and redemption; and as we have already noted, in Proust, the model for this economy is the eucharistic feast. In addition, though, this eucharistic model, which remains to some extent a filial ritual, displaces the tradition of paternal authority by mediating it through a maternal figure: in Proust there is no access to the recovery of lost meaning without taking into account the place of the mother. The madeleine and the tea, then, are the transposition of the mechanics of transcendence into a nontheological code whose meaning would be conditioned by the place occupied by the mother within it. The reason for this maternal transposition or displacement from the eucharistic ceremony to the partaking of the madeleine seems perfectly clear, moreover, since it is a direct result of the narrator's theory of the symbol. The fundamental distinction between the eucharist and the madeleine is that the eucharist, worn down through age-old layers of habit, has become a merely conventional symbol, an ideal object that is totally exhausted in its hypothetical meaning for the intelligence, and for this reason it cannot give access to the truth as it actually exists. The madeleine, on the other hand, a material symbol that has been experienced indepen- dently of its eventual meaning, always preserves some of the reality it origi- nally shared with what Proust will call the "essence" of reality. Obviously, the distinction here between conventional and material, which is also a question of sexual difference as well as "essence," can be operative only from the point of view of the thinking subject that is in the process of constituting itself thanks to such "symbols." For, to judge by the wholly conventional link that now obtains between</page><page sequence="11">160 Yale French Studies the madeleine and Proust's Recherche, there is nothing inherently more "material" (or maternal) about the madeleine than there is about the eu- charist, except in the consciousness that registers it as such. This process of registration is described near the end of the novel as the writing out of a book whose pages are accessible only to those truths that leave a material trace on them: "This book, the most difficult of all to decipher, is also the only one that has been dictated to us by reality, the only one whose 'impression' has been made in us by reality itself. Whatever idea is left in us by life, its material figure, the trace of the impression it has made on us, remains the token of its necessary truth. Ideas formed purely by the intellect can only have a logical truth, a hypothetical truth . . ." (3:880, emphasis added). Far from being an aesthetic idealism, then, Proust's symbolism is a materialism at the furthest remove from the merely abstract truths of logic and specula- tion. Truth, as it is being described here, is not simply the formal beauty of an aesthetic object or the logical beauty of a proposition, but is in addition the literal truth of what actually happens, what intervenes in reality with the necessity of a material event that leaves it mark on the world. 13 For this reason, the means of recovering the truth and thereby tasting the joys of what the narrator will refer to as "the celestial food" has itself to achieve materiality, "even if the simple taste of a madeleine seems logically unable to contain the basis for this joy" (3:873). The way the madeleine achieves materiality and is allowed to write the truth in the book the narrator will eventually have to decipher as his very own is through the repeated communion services Marcel attends on the Sunday mornings of his boyhood in Combray in tante Leonie's bedroom. The scene, in which Marcel is the acolyte and tante Leonie the celebrant, ends with Marcel's receiving the bit of madeleine steeped in tea from the outstretched hand of his aunt. But because, just as with the eucharistic service, the preparation of the sacrament is what guarantees the effective- ness of its consummation, the scene deserves quotation in its entirety: 13. The best description of how this concept of truth effects Proust's understanding of the symbol and its relation to a "material" rather than an ideal beauty, remains the following passage on Giotto's frescos, cited and read by Paul de Man: "But later on I came to understand that the overwhelming strangeness [1'6tranget6 saisissantel, the peculiar beauty of these frescos consisted in the important place taken up in them by the symbol, and that the fact that it was represented not as a symbol, since the thought symbolized was not expressed, but as real, as actually endured or materially handled [effectivement subi ou materiellement manieJ, lent to the significance of the work something more literal and more precise, and to its teaching something more concrete and striking" (1:82). Proust is not here denying the existence of logical truths or "immaterial symbols" in which the symbol would itself coincide and with the thought symbolized in it. Like the distinction between voluntary and involuntary memory, this one involves the question of the material effect or effectiveness when something occurs as an actual "event" rather than a mere "idea."</page><page sequence="12">KEVIN NEWMARK 161 After a moment I would go in to kiss her; Franqoise would infuse her tea; or, if my aunt were feeling agitated, she would ask for her tisane instead, and I would be in charge of measuring out onto a plate the amount of linden needed to put into the boiling water. The drying out of the stems had turned them into a capricious trellis in whose interlacings pale flowers opened up, as though a painter had arranged and placed them as ornamentally as possible. The leaves, having lost or changed their ap- pearance, resembled the most disparate things-the transparent wing of a fly, the blank side of a paper label, the petal of a rose-but as though they had been stacked on top of one another, ground together, or interwoven as in the construction of a bird's nest [mais qui eussent ete empilees, con- cassees ou tressees comme dans la confection d'un nid].

Soon my aunt, who relished the taste of dead leaves or wilted flowers in the boiling infusion, was able to steep in it a petite madeleine [Bientot ma tante pouvait tremper dans l'infusion bouillante dont elle savourait le qout de feuillemorte ou defleurfanee une petitemadeleine], from which she would hold out to me a small piece when it had become soft enough. [1:51-52]</page><page sequence="13">162 Yale French Studies What becomes immediately evident to even the most cursory glance at this passage is the disproportionately small place allotted in it to the Madeleine. Stranger still perhaps is the fact that the passage itself, a passage to which all the other passages in the Recherche can be said to point as to their origin and key, is not marked out by the narrator in any particular way. Rather, it is merely retold as just another of the links in a long chain of associated memories. But this chain, it should be remembered, was itself set off several pages earlier by the recognition of the capital importance of precisely this Madeleine and this cup of linden tea: "And as soon as I had recognized the taste of the piece of madeleine steeped in linden tea and given me by my aunt . .. all of Combray and its surroundings ... came out, town and gar- dens, of my cup of tea" (1:47-48). A scene in which the formalized sacra- ment of transubstantiation is itself transubstantiated into a material sym- bol that leaves its indelible mark on the subject of narration is of obvious exegetic interest: not only will it be paradigmatic for the functioning of all material symbols contained in the text, it should also help to reveal what- ever aspects, if any, of its own marking operation must remain unremarked or inaccessible to the subject undergoing it. The Madeleine, it turns out, is itself just a cover-up for a deeper layer of symbolic functioning at work here. The identity of the two madeleines and therefore of the narrator-personage as well-is not only a metaphorical structure that is tied to the metonymical links radiating outward from the center of Combray; it is also, and more importantly, an identity that is linked to and conditioned by a more fundamental metaphorical structure put into play by the linden tea. Genette's characterization of the Proustian "miracle" as a symmetrical and reciprocal alliance of metaphor and metonymy can now be completed by remarking that such alliances must themselves be grounded metaphorically. What is truly miraculous is that a metonymy could ever be said to relate to a metaphor by a "symmetry" and "reciprocity" that would itself be governed by an a priori metaphorical structure. Thus, the madeleine is not just the symbol that prefigures the narrator's future identity by a mere juxtaposition of the sensual and the spiritual-"the little scallop-shell of pastry, so richly sensual beneath its severe and devout folds" (1:47)-it is also a figure that recalls the underlying symbolic mechanism that conditions such a reciprocal relationship be- tween inside and outside as a metaphorical relationship of symmetry and adequation. This mechanism, which is fully developed in the description of the linden tea, is first signalled by the casual reference to the infusion of herbal tea, which establishes the entire procedure as one of internalization and fusion. The French term, "infusion," moreover, is an especially fortu- nate choice here, since its semantic range covers the chemical process of maceration as well as the theological concept of a divine imparting of grace,</page><page sequence="14">KEVIN NEWMARK 163 uniting in this one word for interpenetration both poles of matter and spirit. What the passage attempts is nothing less than the reconciliation by an act of the mind of the transience of organic nature and the permanence of artistic representation; a reconciliation, it should be recalled, on which the entire Recherche depends for its own intelligibility. Such a reconciliation can only be the result of overcoming a natural process of loss and increasing entropy. By themselves, those qualities of nature associated here with summer, blossoming flowers and trees, youth and objectivity in general, seem unable to preserve their freshness, much less their own identity, as when it is stated that "the leaves, having lost or changed their appearance, now resembled the most disparate of things." The passage of time, from summer to winter and concomitantly from out- side to inside, is first perceived as nothing but a degradation, a constant wearing away that reduces even the metonymical links of natural experi- ence to a state of dissolution and isolation, a rather unappetizing collection of dismembered flies, empty labels, and dispersed flowers. The human coun- terpart that immediately comes to mind for this insuperable process of loss is of course tante Leonie herself, a shriveled and wilted version of natural life, reduced to a state of skeletal rigidity, and trapped inside the colorless and stale tomb of her two adjoining rooms. But this extreme limit of decay also turns out to be closest to the reversed image of its renewal, and shortly afterward, aided by her library of medical and spiritual manuals as well as by "a statue of the Virgin and a bottle of Vichy-Celestins," tante Leonie be- comes the explicit figure for a possible resurrection into eternal life. 14 The intervening step that prepares and allows for this reversal to take place is the transposition of nature, whose dominant figure in this passage is the linden blossom, into a text, "a book in which one is astonished to find the name of a personal acquaintance." It would be impossible to overestimate the impor- tance here of recognizing this familiar name, since it is the possibility of maintaining some kind of identity throughout each of its stages that ensures that the process that leads from what can only be described retrospectively as natural perception to the now of textual representation can be effected without radical loss to the subject who has staked his entire future on it. The strength of this claim to an unbreakable tie between nature and the book, between a natural process of organic decay and its recuperation in a 14. It is in the second paragraph immediately following the one quoted above that tante LUonie is described in the terms that made Gide, one of the readers of Proust's manuscript when it was submitted to (and rejected by) the NRF, doubt Proust's ability to use figurative language: "She held out to my lips her sad brow, colorless and tasteless, on which, at this hour of the morning, she had not yet arranged her artificial hair, and from underneath which the vertebrae stood out like a crown of thorns or the beads of a ros- ary. ." (1:52).</page><page sequence="15">164 Yale French Studies textual act of understanding, is made to rest solely on the possibility of the blooming linden flowers being able to find their way essentially unaltered into tante Leonie's cup of tea. Such a claim is made explicit when the nar- rator speaks of reading and understanding the dried blossoms as though they were the written characters of a book: "And each new character being noth- ing but the metamorphosis of a previous character, in the little gray bulbs I recognized the green buds... ." The relay is helped to some extent by the fact that this one word, caractere, can be made to function simultaneously as an index of both natural "properties" and written "ciphers," exemplifying in an economical way the very "metamorphosis" that is being attempted here. At any rate, the persuasive value of the passage is beyond question when the narrator speaks of his satisfaction at realizing [le p1aisir de com- prendre] that what he has before his eyes are not mere substitutes or replace- ments [non des doubles], but rather the very same linden blossoms, though in a different, more permanent and useful form. Thus, and in spite of an occasional note of dissonance, introduced for example in the odd reference to an "effaced" fresco, there is a one-to-one correspondence established be- tween nature and its transformation into a recognizable and intelligible text. This correspondence, it is important to notice, is itself modeled on a natural process, of what is called "aging" [elles avaient viefili] in the passage in question. If frescos, books, names, and characters can redeem trees, streets, flowers, and petals, this is because, in essence, they can all be made to depend on the same, ultimately organic, laws of growth and aging. Effects of repetition or simulacrum are therefore downplayed to the advantage of natural cycles of change and progression, and if reference is made at one point to the ornamental technique of a painter, it is quickly reassimilated to the natural scheme of things when the narrator then assures us that this can be no "artificial concoction" (preparation factice).15 The consequences of this self-enclosed system of correspondences be- tween the living blossoms and the dried blossoms is far-reaching, moreover, since it is capable of infinite expansion in time and space. Thus, and always according to a balanced economy of figural exchanges and reversals, it would finally be able to include even the "present" act of writing the text as well as its own reading, which is projected on to some hypothetical "future." It is 15. The genetic model that ensures the link between the growing plant and the writ- ing of the text, which Proust inherits from Nerval, moreover, becomes even clearer at the end of the novel: "In this way my whole life ... would and would not have been able to be summed up under this title: A vocation. It would not have been able to inasmuch as literature had played no role in my life. It would have been able to inasmuch as this life . . . formed an inner reservoir identical to the albumen that is stored in the ovule of plants and from which the ovule extracts the nourishment required to transform itself into a seed.... So too was my life in contact with that which would be accomplished through its maturation" (3:899).</page><page sequence="16">KEVIN NEWMARK 165 also possible at this point to confirm Poulet's observation that the role of memory in the Recherche, which is present here in the figure of the "drying" or "preserving" of the objects of nature for future use by the mind, is prolep- tic as well as retrospective. The narrator is presently remembering an act of recognition that took place in his own past-the identity between the living blossoms and the dried ones-which act of memory simultaneously pre- figures the future recognition-the identity between the experience of the boy and the writing of the man-that is only to take place after the novel will have been written and read. The writer who is "now" telling his story thematizes a remembered scene of preservation and assimilation that both looks back toward a "past" boyhood experience as well as forward to a "future" preservation and assimilation of the man by the writer who will be able to read this meaning out of his own text. It is as if the linden blossoms- insofar as they are both a past experience (already swallowed by the boy and remembered by the man) and a future figure (yet to be employed by the writer)-were themselves saying: "As often as you do these things, in mem- ory of me shall you do them." The "me" in question, of course, is the identity of the boy, the man, and the writer, and it always remains to be confirmed yet once again in the "now" of reading by reassimilating their proximity in the textual memory. The proof of the system's efficacity is that each element can be substituted for any one of the others without entailing a loss of intelligibility for its overall functioning. Thus, the past can become present and future as easily and reversibly as the green bud and gray bulb become specular figures for the green boy and gray writer as well as for the green (naive) reader he once was, and the mature (gray) reader he will one day be. The figural law of this system of transformations is the analogy of inte- riorization that is established between the textual layers comprising the blossoms, the boy, and the writer. Just as the blooming linden can be dried and brought inside the house without loss, so too can the dried linden be recognized by the boy as the past summer evenings he now consumes as an actual beverage. Finally, the novel would be the making available in lin- guistic "characters" of the whole internalizing process that leads to the ultimate identity of the self, which occurs as an act of reading its own writing. In this way, the text becomes the manifestation, on the outside as it were, of an inner experience of the writer remembering himself as a boy; a boy, moreover, who had brought the outside of nature inside his body by swallowing the tea that contained the preserved linden blossoms. Such spa- tial reversals of inside and outside that are then temporalized into a se- quence are familiar to any reader of Proust. By not taking sufficient notice of the full extension of their symmetrical crossings, however, one runs the risk of mistaking what is in principle a dialectical and genetic structure, whose</page><page sequence="17">166 Yale French Studies end point is already implicitly contained in its starting point, for a series of arbitrarily related fragments. Thus, for instance, Deleuze, whose principal concern is to isolate the realm of art from all the other activities described in the novel, is able to attribute to it a spontaneous freedom only by positing an "opposition" and a "break" between a "philosophical" and historical past and an autonomously "artistic" future toward which the Recherche is un- derway. 16 In order to do so, of course, he also has to establish a linear hier- archy of discrete moments between what he calls the signs of memory (the madeleine), of imagination (the steeples of Martinville), and of art (the Re- cherche itself). But for Proust, there would be no more opposition between such "material symbols" as there is between the linden blossoms and the residue of the textual leaves Marcel learns to read in the cup, and out of which he eventually writes his novel. At any rate, the system of analogies set up between the change of seasons in nature and the transformation of the boy into the writer has become so resilient by the end of the passage that the narrator is able to cross back and forth between the antithetical regions of life and death, nature and art, outside and inside, without the least hesitation or obstruction. The long climactic sentence, which begins with the recognition that each new char- acter of the linden is simply a natural metamorphosis of an earlier one, winds its way through the intricate comparison of the flowers' rosy hue with an old fresco and finally ends in the demonstration that these dead leaves were indeed the very linden petals that had once participated in the rites of spring. Now it is noteworthy that this proof is itself given in the form of an additional figure when it is further said that these were the same petals that, before adorning the druggist's package with a shape, had graced the spring- time trees with a perfume. For by insisting that, whether dead or alive, these are lindens that share at least one essential property, this extra figure rein- forces yet again the metaphorical link and possible substitutions between the blossoms and the dried petals. In this case, the property shared by blossoms and tea is that of a "flower" that, independently of its empirical status, is able to "bloom" as a rhetorical figure of embellishment. This flower, which therefore graces Proust's text as well as both the druggist's package and the linden tree, is almost impossible to detect in translation. It is dependent for its full flowering on the idiomatic use of the French verbs fleurir and embaumer to mean "to enhance" or "to grace" by 16. See, especially, 131-34 of Proust et les signes. Deleuze's claim that in the art work an essence is so far "dematerialized" that it no longer "depends on the material conditions of incarnation [and] . . . no longer refers to anything outside its own formal structure" (200-01), contrasts sharply with Proust's insistance on a "material trace" that always retains a reference to what necessarily "precedes" its re-discovery in an actual work of art (3:879-81).</page><page sequence="18">KEVIN NEWMARK 167 means of a shape or a scent. What this passage claims to demonstrate in French, then, is that, "ces petales etaient bien ceux qui avant de fleurir le sac de pharmacie avaient embaume les soirs de printemps." The loss of grace entailed in a more literal translation of the phrase is already a first indication of what is ultimately at stake in such figural crossings: "these petals were the very ones that before flowering the druggist's package had embalmed the evenings of spring," where the meaning aimed at in both cases is clearly "to embellish," thanks either to a beautiful appearance or fragrance. What is so effortlessly achieved in reading the French-the figural meaning of a visible or odoriferous "grace" that allows the dead and the living flowers to function in an analogous way and thus to be said to be "the same"-becomes much more difficult to swallow in the English translation. The meaning of the transitive verbs "to flower" and "to embalm" is anything but gracefully assimilated in our language, where it conjures up the antiseptic atmosphere of formaldehyde and mortuary preparations as much as the balmy freshness of spring promenades and aesthetic invention. This can be no mere accident in a passage that claims to reconcile the outside with the inside and the foreign with the domestic by means of an act of interiorization. That the restorative linden tea should produce a case of indigestion just by being translated into English may itself be a symptom of a further-reaching disorder. For the English transposition of the linden blossoms merely brings out, in the same way that the delicate forest of stems highlights the suspension of rosy flowers, a figural play between foreground and background that was already, though more subtly, operative in the original. If the flowery glow of the original's figural meaning has a difficult time making it across to the English, it is equally true that what is underscored in its place by the transla- tion is the literal spine of meaning that remains judiciously covered over by the idiomatic French. To some extent, then, it is the very coarseness of the translation's insistence on a literal process of "flowering" and "embalming" that serves to remind us that, beneath and beyond the shared attribute of the living and dried flowers' figural "gracefulness," what is essentially at issue here is precisely the possibility of substituting those living blossoms that literally "flowered" with these dead leaves that have been literally "em- balmed." And it is only after we have been reminded of this that it becomes possible to notice that the passage has indeed already switched the literal attributes so that the preserved leaves are now said to be "flowering" inside the package while the "embalming" of the living blossoms has already oc- curred outside in nature. Such a switch, of course, is just one more example of the kind of chiasmic exchanges from nature to mind and to text out of which the entire passage is constructed. But in addition, this particular reversal from organic growth to artificial preservation is what is to be ex-</page><page sequence="19">168 Yale French Studies plained and demonstrated by the passage, rather than merely taken for granted in it. What is the status of a demonstration that uses what is to be proven as evidence for the truth of its argument? In order to suggest an answer to this question it is necessary to look more closely at what happens in the passage when the attributes of nature and art are exchanged in the figure of the linden's flowering and embalming. First of all, the dried, dead flowers come back to life, they are resuscitated in a more permanent and accessible form than the fleeting blossoms. And unlike the natural flowers, the preserved blossoms can be articulated into a fixed pat- tern; constructed or "woven" (tresse) like a text, moreover, they can be measured according to fixed conventions and finally consumed by the hero. As such, the reflowering of the linden tea becomes the prefiguration of the narrator's own resurrection, which is prescribed at the end of the novel as the production of just such a textual work of art.17 But as is also noted at the end, and in conformity with the symmetry required by the chiasmic ex- change of properties, it is only possible for the dried leaves of the text to resuscitate when the living blossoms of nature are made to die, are sacrificed in their place. Quoting the scriptural text, "unless it die . . . ," the narrator will finally recognize the necessary connotations of death and burial that were all along implicit here in the verb "embaumer" (3:1044). Clearly, "em- balming" is a metonymy for death, since it names a process or a ceremony that presupposes a death and a corpse upon which to operate. In the terms of the Christian allegory that is mimed throughout, the "Madeleine" is also a proper name, Magdalene, and it has a specific role to perform in this sacri- ficial structure: "At that time, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome, brought spices, that they might go and anoint Jesus" (Mark, 16:1-2, emphasis added). The madeleine, then, names the faculty and the agent of the anointing or embalming it performs on the narrator's boyhood; through its homonymy with Mary Magdalene it smears the natural corpse of Combray with the perfumed oils of linden in order to preserve it ritually. The ceremony of the eucharist, which for the hero is the partaking of the linden-soaked madeleine, works as a prefiguration of the writer's resurrec- tion as well as a commemoration of the boy's death and burial. The coherence of this system of death and resurrection is guaranteed by the privileged status accorded in it to memory, conceived as the intermedi- ate space between organic nature and subjective thought. This is the faculty by which nature's death is anointed and preserved while it awaits a resurrec- tion in a future knowledge thanks first to its transfiguration into a work of 17. In the drafts, the trellis-work of the linden blossoms is compared to an antique lace, or "dentelle": "most of them ... had turned the golden, almost russet color of an antique lace that is a bit wom [fripde] . . ." (Etudes proustiennes, 242). In the symbolist genealogy at work here, Nerval's lace metaphor must be tom by Mallarm6 before it can find its afterlife in Proust.</page><page sequence="20">KEVIN NEWMARK 169 art. Proust could not be clearer on this point when he has the narrator ask: "So then, wasn't the recreation by the memory of impressions that would later have to be elaborated, illuminated, and transformed into intellectual equivalents [approfondir, eclairer, transformer en equivalents d'intel- ligence], one of the conditions, in fact, the very essence of the work of art as I had just conceived it? " (3:1044). As the condition and essence of what Proust describes here as an "art of thought," this kind of memory belongs primor- dially and exclusively to the kind of subject it allows to come into being. That is why, not only in Proust but in the entire tradition to which his text constantly makes reference, the preservation effected by memory is always figured as a ceremony or a ritual, a participation by the human subject in the death (of natural experience) that is thereby preserved in a material impres- sion. This, of course, will account for the crucial distinction made in the faculty of memory, which Proust complicates by attaching the paradoxical and potentially misleading epithets, between memoire involontaire, which presupposes the full engagement of the subject in the sacrificial ritual of preservation, and memoire volontaire, which is disengaged, disinterested, and formalistic memory.18 Like the readability of the proper name that guarantees the truth of a book, moreover, the ritual of memoire involontaire must affix the material trace of what, in the linden tea episode, is called the "thousand useless details" that mark a given event as actually being "real" for the subject who thereby registers it as his own. As such, the mark is also a kind of signature, and it belongs to a "me" in whose memory the dead past is promised its future resurrection through the work of writing it out: for instance, through the second coming, as text, of Christ, Madeleine, or Marcel. Near the end of the Recherche, the narrator will insist that it is only thanks to the "some- what aberrant particularity" that shapes the author's own paraph or sig- nature that the truth of an individual's thought can become universally valid and available. This is so because the reader of such a signature is nothing other than his very own author: "Actually, each reader, when he reads, is his very own reader.... The recognition that the reader makes, in himself, of what the book says is the proof of its truth, and vice versa" (3:9 10, 18. In this sense, for Proust there are two kinds of reality, of self, of memory, of experience; one that is substantial and remains to be uncovered, the other a superficial and false, one could say ideological, version of the first. Insofar as the memoire volontaire does not take the implication of the self in the operations of memory seriously enough, it is like the merely "possible" truths of abstract intelligence, only that it is oriented toward some hypothetical past rather than a hypothetical present or future: "Of course, it is possible to extend the spectacles of the memoire volontaire, which no more engage the fibers of our very selves than would leafing through a book of picture images . . ." (3:873). The richest, though by no means simplest, discussion of this wobbly distinction occurs, interestingly enough, in Benjamin's essay on Baudelaire, "On Some Motifs in Baudelaire," Illumina- tions, trans. Harry Zohn (New York, Schocken Books, 1969), 157-63.</page><page sequence="21">170 Yale French Studies 91 1). Books always say the same thing, then, and this is the survival, beyond the death of all natural experience, of the proper name: "a book is an enor- mous cemetery," Proust has his narrator say at one point, and learning how to read amounts to recognizing in it the construction of a monument to one's own name (3:903, 904).19 We are led back by the logic of this conclusion to the passage involving the hero's infusion of the madeleine and linden tea, since that is where the mechanics of the preservative power of the m6moire involontaire are fully worked out. As the place where an initial recounting in Combray 1 of the memory of a material impression made during the subject's childhood (1:47-48) is then recomposed in Combray 2 into a much more elaborate scenario (1:51-52), this passage can legitimately be taken as a model for the work of art that is called for by the writer at the end of the text. As such, it is itself an "elaboration, illumination, and transformation in intellectual equivalents" of the way involuntary memory functions as the unconditional principle of any art of thinking. It is, in strict accordance with Proust's own description, then, an allegory of memory, and therefore it must contain within itself all the elements necessary for the passage from experience to thought as well as their possible recombinations in the ultimate construc- tion of the Recherche. We have already examined how this allegory works as a process of continuous internalization that moves from the flowering and death of nature to the preservative embalming of memory upon which de- pends any further flowering of textual reproduction and recognition. The only element in this functioning of memory that remains to be located and accounted for is that of the human agent who must at every stage underwrite and sign his participation in the sacrifice of nature. For in order to guarantee that the art of thought that resuscitates on the far side of natural experience can be understood as a thoroughly human work, rather than an unheard-of species of monster, the subject of memory that initiates it must indeed be recognizable as "une personne de connais- sance," a personal acquaintance. Such accounting hardly seems necessary, moreover, since the overwhelming presence in the scene of ritual ingestion of the boy himself, as well as of tante Leonie and the helping hand of the druggist-artist, should more than suffice as the gage of human participation here. Nonetheless, the premature and unexplained figural crossing of the attributes of life and death that can be traced back to the chiasmic substitu- tion of the lindens' "flowering" for their "embalming," which, in defiance of 19. "In fact, if it is often said that his loves and losses have benefitted the poet, have helped him to build his oeuvre, if strangers who would least of all have suspected it ... have each contributed a stone toward the erection of the monument they will never see, then it remains to be considered just how the writer's life does not end with this oeuvre .. " 1(904).</page><page sequence="22">KEVIN NEWMARK 171 a logic of cause and effect, occurs just before the proof concerning the pos- sible relation of identity in life and death is concluded, should alert us once again to a potential complication in completing the trajectory memory as- signs itself. For what kind of (rhetorical) trick would it be to switch "life" for "death" before these terms have been allowed to acquire their full on- tological significance for the human subject that is to be defined solely in relation to them? How would it then be possible to resuscitate what has never actually died? Or conversely, what could it mean to kill something that has never actually lived? These are questions that remind us that what is at stake in reading Proust is the possibility of establishing and maintaining a genealogy, though they do so in such a way that it now becomes difficult to avoid the inter- ference in the discussion of a palpably ethical tonality. At what point can it be said that this became inevitable and not just a mere importation from outside the text? Certainly the intertextual reference in the Recherche to the figural pattern of the eucharist can never be completely isolated from the context of violence that necessarily surrounds the sacrificial death com- memorated in it. The crown of thorns to which tante Leonie's skull is compared thus makes her into a prefiguration not only of an eventual resur- rection, but also of those other calvaries for which the narrator will later feel himself personally responsible, in particular the sufferings of his mother and grandmother. One even begins to suspect that the analogy he will make between a book and "an enormous cemetery" may possibly have been dic- tated by similar feelings of guilt at having failed himself to live up to ethical responsibilities involving the welfare of others. In themselves, however- and no matter what the extent of the individual's turpitude, which in this case, and for the purposes of the story, seems to have been somewhat exagge- rated-such feelings of personal guilt would not be able to account for the more radical question that asks about establishing the difference between life and death in the first place. And this question becomes unavoidable from the moment Proust's text uses nature, the natural cycle of the seasons and the organic process of the seed's maturation, as an allegorical figure for the embalming and preserving operations of the m6moire involontaire. Which makes it, from the very beginning, an ethical question, or rather, the ethical question: what constitutes "life," and "who" (or what) can deter- mine the circumstances under which this process may be (rightly) inter- rupted? For the allegory of memory is also a story about how the natural develop- ment of life, the growth of a seed, is interrupted and brought to a halt before it can complete itself. As a consequence, it is an allegory of what can thus be called "abortion," and it also includes the ethical dimension contained by this term. In order to make the linden tea in this text, nature must be</page><page sequence="23">172 Yale French Studies "preserved," but in order to be preserved, the natural process of maturation must be interrupted short of its end point: "in the little gray bulbs I recog- nized the green buds that had not come to term.... "20 Now it is at this point that the status of the signature, of the assurance of a "personal ac- quaintance" or human agent who would be recognizable as such throughout the process-which is none other than the sacrificial taking of natural life in order to turn it into an allegorical language signifying something else, some- thing higher because more "elaborated and illuminated . .. true life"-be- comes absolutely crucial. This is because it is one thing for someone to use nature in this way, to "nip it in the bud" and nourish one's own subjectivity with it cognitively and aesthetically, (physiologically as well). The (ethical) problem begins only when a question arises with respect to the line that must be drawn between the life that is said to be merely "natural" and the one that is determined as being, more or less, "human." In the same way, to say that the allegory of memory is also an allegory of "abortion" is, at least in principle, a rather innocent figure: it becomes (ethically) problematic only when, as in Proust, a question arises with respect to an understanding of the status-human or nonhuman-of the "buds" and "flowers" referred to within the allegory and that are cut down before they are allowed to come to term. The question of what is human, the ethical question, has brought us back to the question of the figure, or of what is rhetorical, that first disclosed it as such. This is what Paul de Man means when he says that-ethicity is the referential version of a linguistic predicament; that is, ethicity is the ineluc- table pressure to decide between literal and figural meaning when the ref- erent at stake is the line dividing "human" from "nonhuman" as well as the concomitant value system of "right" and "wrong."'21 In the passage in Proust we have been dealing with, the interference of the ethical values of right and wrong with the cognitive determination of the rhetorical status of "bud" and "flower" would become truly problematic-and simultaneously imperative-were the line between human and nonhuman (in this case, the budding flowers) somehow to be crossed. Is there in fact a point in this text 20. The insistance on an interruption of the organic process at every point short of "completion" is even clearer in the drafts of this passage, where the anthropomorphic reference is not elided: "With very little effort one could recognize in a little yellow shell a bud that was going to open when the plant had died, in an anemone-red capsule a fruit that had not come to maturity, this bouquet of little bulbs that dreamily lays its heads one against the other, like the heads of tender children, are the seeds that did not come to maturity. . ."

Sheldon Sacks (Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1978, 1979): "One now sees that the figure is not only ornemental and aesthetic but powerfully coercive since it generates, for example, the ethical pressure of such questions as 'to kill or not to kill."' In this case, de Man's formulation of the problem is derived from Locke, where the specificity of the example is "the predicament (to kill or not to kill the monstrous birth)" that can appear either as a "logical argument" or an "ethical issue" (17-18).

There are indications outside the passage itself that this may indeed be the case. It becomes rather unsettling, for example, to place the linden blossom episode side by side with the final "illumination" of what con- stitutes, in Le Temps retrouve, the narrator's "vocation" as writer: "Thus my whole life . . . the memories of its sorrows and its joys, formed an inner reservoir identical to the albumen that is stored in the ovule of plants and from which the ovule extracts the nourishment required to transform itself into a seed. And this at a time when no one knows that the plant's embryo is developing as the locus of chemical and respiratory phenomena that are no less active for their remaining secret. So too was my life in contact with that which would be accomplished through its maturation" (3:899). For one thing, reading the two passages together reconfirms the complex spatiotem- poral structure of memory: it is an interiorizing process that evolves through the novel, absorbing along the way the physiological functions of nourish- ment, fertilization, and even reproduction. Memory, in this novel, is an internalization powerful enough to link the acts of ingestion and generation in an eroticized phantasm whose extreme form would be cannibalism; it swallows the entire world and then tries to reproduce itself from out of its own stomach. Yet even here, where the writer's interpersonal relations are seen retrospectively as so many opportunities to reproduce himself from the fecondating traces left on the imprinted surface of his memory, the critical distinction between human and botanical (or animal) forms of life does not appear to be seriously threatened. As long as the writer, as human, remains the unquestioned "ground" for the metaphor, the "vehicle" of the plant's (or animal's) functioning can itself be assimilated into a figural balance that is achieved between two fully constituted and separate entities. More trou- blesome, from this point of view, is the fact that the late passage on the writer's vocation must presuppose the accomplishment of its own future, as a written text, on the basis of, or by analogy to, a prior knowledge of how the "natural" maturation of the plant works. But it is precisely this natural process of maturation that is categorically denied to the (linden) blossoms in the earlier passage. This occurs by way of a disruption of organic develop- ment, a premature intervention into the natural process without which the preservative powers of memory would be inconceivable. We seem to end up with the same kind of circular reasoning operating between the beginning and end of the novel that we already found within the space of a single different, more extended and original reading of this gesture toward ethicity in de Man, see Werner Hamacher's "LECTIO: de Man's Imperative," in Reading de Man Reading, ed. Lindsay Waters and Wlad Godzich (Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press, 1989), especially 183-87.</page><page sequence="25">174 Yale French Studies sentence in the earlier switch between the "flowering" and the "embalm- ing" of linden blossoms. The proof of the analogy between the genesis of a plant and that of a writer cannot be made by presupposing the analogy as its own evidence, no matter how far the "proof" is extended textually. There is a slight difference to be remarked here, however, since between the two passages, and thus between the beginning and end of the novel, the orientation of the power of memory has shifted subtly from a perspective on what actually has occurred in the past to what, as a result, can happen in the future. Where the earlier passage insists that the preserved tea petals are the very same as the blossoms that once began to flower, the later passage claims that the transposition of the writer's "life" into his "text" thanks to memory will be like the "maturation" of the plant's seed. We cannot rule out the possibility that the later analogy, which makes explicit the relation between the budding plant and the writer, and which is only hinted at in the earlier episode, is saying something far more complicated and less easy to assimi- late than a casual reading would suggest. For there is no a priori reason to suppose that the concluding passage on the writer's vocation is in any way blind (or deaf) to what has already been said in the earlier section on the writer's apprenticeship. By claiming that the role to be played by memory in the writer's future is to be understood by analogy to the seed's maturation, which the text itself has already structured as a radical disruption of the process of organic development, the later passage may simply be reminding us that, until we have allowed this "abortion" to redetermine whatever is meant by "nature," "seed," "maturation," and even the concept of "future" itself, we have not yet sufficiently read the earlier version, which could not even be said to be "earlier" until it will have been read. What if this text were writing about the possibility of a kind of future that could only take place once we moved beyond the interruption of the natural order it has itself already produced? As such, the future would be the least natural event imaginable, and it would remain before "us" only as a secret possibility, requiring a kind of time and a kind of embryo different from anything "we" now know: "a time when no one knows that the plant's embryo is develop- ing as the site of secret respiratory and chemical phenomena that are no less active for their remaining secret." And since, only a few pages after describ- ing his own vocation in these terms, the narrator also appeals to a genealogi- cal line that would include Nerval and Baudelaire, this reminder about what remains to be read would apply equally well to their texts.22 "What remains 22. "One of the chef-d'oeuvres of French literature, G6rard de Nerval's Sylvie ... has about it the same kind of feel as the taste of Madeleine .... And in Baudelaire, of course, these reminiscences, which are even more numerous, are obviously less fortuitous, and as a result, decisive in my opinion .... So I would try to remind myself of those pieces by Baudelaire whose basis was the transposition of such a feeling, in order finally to get myself back into a filiation as noble as that one . . (3:919-20).</page><page sequence="26">KEVIN NEWMARK 175 to be read," such would be the formula for what, still in embryo, could only occur or be produced in this text beyond the interruption of the (natural) plant's embryo and all that it conditions, including the concept of "abor- tion" itself. If there is still to be a history that could contain this genealogy- comprised at the very least of Nerval, Baudelaire, Proust, and by implication Mallarme-it would be one that could be given only as a future: history would be the as-yet-to-be-accomplished "maturation" of what has already taken place in these writers as a textual "abortion."23 The implications of this conclusion for a reading of the episode of the linden blossoms are considerable, both from a rhetorical and an ethical point of view. First of all, it has the effect of making us responsible for this textual abortion, though we should not assume too quickly that such re- sponsibility can be adequately understood, measured, or prescribed in the subjective or intersubjective terms in which responsibility is by tradition assessed. For by far the most curious thing about the linden blossoms in Proust is that their organic development is not checked or aborted by the intervention of a human subject, who could then be expected, as a person, to accept or pass along the responsibility for the interruption of natural devel- opment, though this responsibility is nonetheless real. It is rather nature her or itself that functions as the instance of intervention in its own process of natural growth. Which is also to say that nature is not primarily natural in this text. The burden of the reading would be to determine with as much precision as possible just how it is that what seems like nature can be the source of unnatural acts, and first of all, the inhuman agent of its own death sentence. The petals that announce the flowering of spring, cut it off in the same breath and, through a ritualized abortion, preserve it for future use in a state of suspended animation. One can hardly believe it, but where the 23. "Abortion," of course, is a political issue of some urgency as well as a "mere" rhetorical structure deployed and interrogated in Proust's text, although it may be a naive (or strategic) gesture to pretend that urgent political issues can simply be considered, much less decided, without reference to or interference from rhetorical structures. Barbara Johnson has written a thoughtful and provocative essay on the complex relation between figurative language and the question of abortion. Her remarks on the necessity of consider- ing the gender of the mother whenever the question of "abortion" is raised would have a wholly salutary influence with respect to a reading of Proust's text. Instead of asking if Albertine is really a male (Albert) portrayed as a female figur(ine,) it would be more to the point to ask how Proust's signature can be read as that of a feminine operation of writing. Obviously, this should not be taken to mean that there is no (empirical) difference between a male and a female (writer), nor that there is nothing absolutely irreducible in the signifi- cance an "abortion" can have for a "woman." Rather, the displacement of the mother in Proust's text suggests that a mere (paternal or patriarchal) reduction of the metaphorical and conceptual to the empirical (or vice versa) would still remain inadequate to account for the "truth" of history, that is to say, the mater(n)iality of what actually occurs in history as abortion.

What makes the recognition possible is memory, but memory, as the inter- section of the two disproportionate surfaces that come together in a material trace, is itself nothing but this "moment" of stumbling preserved in Proust's text when nature is no longer natural and the subject is not yet human.25 This means, of course, that la memoire involontaire is not involuntary because, unlike memoire volontaire, it is not controlled by the subject; it is involuntary because in it the subject in control is not itself human, or dependent for its power on human intentions or desires. As such, as the possibility, that is, of turning away (from a nature that is no longer there naturally) and of turning toward (a human subject that cannot yet be present to itself as such) memoire involontaire can only be language considered as pure figuration: the possibility. Memory, as this power of turning in lan- guage, is thus the unnatural and inhuman album(en) where an abortion of 24. Proust's sentence, "ces p6tales 6taient bien ceux qui avant de fleurir le sac de pharmacie avaient embaum6 les soirs de printemps," must have seemed so incomprehen- sibly unnatural to his English translator, C. K. Scott Moncrieff, that it was corrected, even at the cost of its grammar, to something like, "ces p6tales 6taient bien ceux qui, avant de fleurir, le sac de pharmacie avait embaum6s les soirs de printemps," since his translation reads, "these were the petals which, before their flowering time, the chemist's package had embalmed on warm evenings of spring." Swann's Way, trans. C. K. Scott Moncrieff, (New York, The Modem Library, 1928), 63. Petals can "embalm" natural flowering with a scent only because they can "embalm" natural flowering as a preserved and unnatural material trace: the condition of possibility in both instances is a law of figural supplementarity. There is nothing natural in making the scent of flowers function as an embellishment that can be added to or subtracted from natural growth. 25. The episode in question involves the narrator's loss of equilibrium when his foot seesaws between two unequally positioned paving stones (3:866-67), itself a figure taken from empirical experience to illustrate Proust's definition of "reality": "What we call reality is a certain relation between those sensations and these memories [of vague hopes and projects]" (3:889). As the locus of the passage from a mere jumble of sense perceptions to a system of organized relations and intentions, the material traces of memory are like the arbitrary concatenation, in a semiosis, of the two heterogeneous "surfaces" of percep- tion and signification. The gap between the two paving stones, because it is represented as the homogeneous space of empirical experience, is therefore an inadequate or hobbled symbol for Proust's concept of the hobbling symbol.</page><page sequence="28">KEVIN NEWMARK 177 nature is written down and stored as the embryonic promise of a human subject that is not yet there. To be responsible for memory's abortion, then, cannot be taken to mean a simple return to a concept of human or natural responsibility. This would be to refuse to be reminded of the necessarily rhetorical dimension in ethics, in the mistaken belief that we already understood fully the difference between nature and culture, and thus what it means to be human. Rather, as a respon- sibility oriented toward the future "maturation" of a textual abortion in which both nature and culture and all their distinctions founder, it would be one that allowed this unnatural and inhuman element in the memory to be written into history as what "survives" them.26 It would mean to produce genuine history precisely by "elaborating, illuminating, and transforming" this inhuman and unnatural element in which the language of memory outlives the impossibility of getting back to nature and getting on with being human. And this would be the truly critical aspect of Proust's text as well. For by reminding us about the necessarily linguistic structure of histo- ry, by reminding us that the turn to history must no longer be conceived on a natural model but that it cannot yet be founded on a purely human one either, Proust's text also helps to neutralize the place of usurped authority that is occupied whenever the representatives of so-called natural and human or moral law do not take into account the inhuman and unnatural element of which they too partake. History, as the future of this memory, must be written, can only occur as writing, but such writing becomes il- legitimate from the moment it is read as a simple prescription whose co- herence could be given or retrieved by recourse to natural or human and therefore transcendental principles. In Proust, the coherence of the prescrip- tive rule is torn irremediably when the blossoms interrupt their own flower- ing. In doing so they abort their natural development by inscribing it within a system of notation whose rhetorical principles remain in part irreducible to either organic or human models. Ethics, or ethicity, can only begin to occur historically when, in addition to filling mere (human) prescriptions, it goes on to register the marks of this inhuman tear. It is by a prodigality in exceeding the measure, by remembering the "thousand useless details" left by the inscription of the deadly blossoms that are neither wholly natural nor yet artificial, that the pharmacist in Proust shows how to be a writer of history as well as a reader of prescriptions, and, beyond all the dismembered flies and flowers, how to make room in a text for the future of a blank album. 26. In the drafts for this passage, Proust had considered having his description of the legible "characters" left in the preserved blossoms culminate in, "that burst of flowers that detaches them from all the rest, painted in gold with the thread of their stamens as though on a chasuble, that is survival . . ." (Etudes proustiennes, 245). The kind of survival at issue in Proust would not be incompatible with what Jacques Derrida has written about "living on." See, "Survivre," in Parages (Paris, Editions Galilee, 1986).</page></plain_text>
