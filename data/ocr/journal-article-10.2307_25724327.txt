<plain_text><page sequence="1">Legal fictions. by Lon l. Fuller. Stanford University Press, Stanford, California 94305. 1967. $4.50. Pages 137. Reviewed by Wil liam H. Edwards of the Rhode Island Bar (Providence). This is a brilliant and stimulating book?not only on the subject de scribed in the title but also on legal thinking in general. Professor Fuller, of the Harvard Law School faculty, wrote these three essays back in 1930 and 1931. They were published in the Illinois Law Review. Now, for the benefit of a larger audi ence, he has put them, with a few changes, into book form. a very good thing too. For if the beginning of wis dom in mankind is to know oneself, the beginning of wisdom in a lawyer is to know how the legal mind works, in cluding its use of legal fictions. Certainly legal fictions have their uses, if we do not indulge in too much self-deception. In Mr. Fuller's first chapter he defines a legal fiction thus: To sum up the results of our discus sion, and to attempt a definition of the fiction that will at least approximate current usage, we may say: A fiction is either (1) a statement propounded with a complete or partial conscious ness of its falsity, or (2) a false state ment recognized as having utility. In the second chapter he classifies the motives behind legal fictions. Per haps intellectual conservatism is one of the chief motives, i.e., the attempt to proceed by analogy with the past. The "casual ejector", that eerie defendant in cases brought by an equally quixotic Doe on the demise of Roe, seems pretty silly now. But if the law was not ready to abolish complicated "real" actions and yet justice required that simpler proceedings should be available, the legal wand had to be waved that would transform the plaintiff into a fictitious tenant, would transform the actual de fendant into a fictitious invader of the property right involved and would then in effect deny to each of them the power to disprove the other's status. This reviewer remembers a slightly similar incident of about forty years ago in his own experience. A knowl edgeable rural judge (a layman, inci dentally), being called upon to decide whether a variance of date was fatal in the trial of a private criminal com plaint for larceny, perceived that the complaint alleged, "On to wit the 18th day of August 1923, etc." He held as follows: "A to-wit date don't have to be proved as exactly as a regular date." Undoubtedly, if the ears of coun sel had been made more acute by Mr. Fuller's present instruction, we would have heard Jeremy Bentham's ghost, assisted by Dickens's Mr. Bumble, screaming derision. Yet it was a just decision, though based on an outra geous fiction. Mr. Fuller has a third chapter deal ing with processes of legal thought and particularly with Vaihinger's philoso phy of "As If" ("Als Ofc"). Although Mr. Fuller doesn't completely demon strate that fictions are indispensable in both the law and also in the natural sciences (e.g., the ether, vacuum, minus numbers, square root of minus one, etc.), he comes pretty close to it. Gentle reader, don't write another brief on a complex legal point without first sharpening your wits on Professor 186 American Bar Association Journal</page><page sequence="2">Books for Lawyers Fuller's masterly exposition. Moreover, don't fail to remember that sometimes anthropomorphic legal fictions or metaphors can make a strik ing contribution to a brief. One such metaphorical definition (fiction, if you will) emanated from Professor E. H. ("Bull") Warren of the Harvard Law School. It was later quoted on occasion by Professor Austin Scott. Warren was asked by a student what a "fixture" really was. Warren replied: "A fixture is real estate with a chattel past and the fear of a chattel future." Rather good, isn't it? ?William H.
