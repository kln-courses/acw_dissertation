A conceptual distinction can be made between normal enemies? those who act as enemies are expected to act, positioning themselves within the mental landscape of the existing political imaginary?and the absolute enemy whose attack threatens the imaginary landscape itself.1 The enemy action by nineteen young men within the United States on September 11,2001 was an attack on this second, metalevel. It did not play by the rules. It put the rules out of play. Its damage was profound not only physically but also conceptually, striking at the collective imagination as a whole. The globally transmitted spec tacle signaled that U.S. superpower status is far from invulnerable and its self-nomination to world hegemony is not an immutable fact. It is a Hobbesian prejudice to presume that self-preservation is the motive and loss of life the issue where war is concerned. The United States is sending to their death in Iraq a number of soldier citizens that is almost equal to, and will likely surpass the 2,986 per sons who died on September 11 (as of August 16, 2006, the number of soldiers killed was 2,595).2 They will die not defending America, which was in no way under military threat from the tyranny of Sad dam Hussein, but as a sacrifice to the idea of American sovereignty and the Tightness of its power. I am not suggesting that Bush's foreign policy was driven purely by mental representations. Imperial interests, oil interests?power on all of its cynical levels was and remains in play. But I am saying that what has enabled him to get away with this policy, and what still enables him to garner the patriotic support of tens of millions of Americans, is not imperial or oil interests, but his interpolation of the collective on this metalevel where its own self-understanding is Cultural Critique 69?Spring 2008?Copyright 2008 Regents of the University of Minnesota</page><page sequence="2">146 | SUSAN BUCK-MORSS under siege. Moreover, the threat to the imaginary that he addresses rhetorically is itself not imaginary, but real. On June 11, exactly three months before the attack on the twin towers and the Pentagon, Timothy McVeigh was put to death in a federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana. Capital punishment was the retribution for his crime against the federal government, the delib erate bombing on April 19,1995, of the Oklahoma federal building, that killed 168 persons. McVeigh, a decorated soldier in Operation Desert Storm, claimed his deed was politically motivated as a protest against two specific cases of U.S. state violence?one domestic: the use of deadly force in Waco, Texas, when federal troops stormed the ranch of the Dravidian apocalyptic sect, killing 80 men, women, and children on April 19,1993; the other foreign: what he called U.S. hypocrisy in the (first) war in Iraq, including the massacre of sur rendered and retreating prisoners. He referred with brutal irony to the babies and toddlers he killed in the Oklahoma federal building attack as "collateral damage." McVeigh's last statement was a handwritten copy of the poem "Invictus" by the British Victorian poet and racial imperialist William Henley, Rudyard Kipling's contemporary. It ends: "I am the master of my fate; I am the captain of my soul." McVeigh showed no signs of remorse. He saw himself as an isolated hero, even though he did not act totally alone and his political critique, which applied to both Republican and Democratic administrations, was shared among mem bers of Aryan and Christian-Apocalyptic groups to which he had connections. Nonetheless, he was a normal enemy, whose crime and punishment fell under federal law. With the event of his execution, national sovereignty was vindicated. McVeigh "met the fate he chose for himself six years ago." President George W. Bush declared at the time, "Under the laws of our country, the matter is concluded."3 Mohammed Atta, a leader of the September 11 attack, was born in 1968, the same year as Timothy McVeigh. Like McVeigh, his politi cization occurred in response to the U.S. government actions in the first Iraq War. McVeigh identified with the victims at Waco, Atta with those in Palestine. McVeigh was trained to kill at Fort Riley, Kansas, Atta at an Al-Qaeda camp in Afghanistan. Both died at age thirty three, McVeigh as a consequence of his crime and Atta during it. Atta's last will clearly indicates that, while part of a collective mission</page><page sequence="3">SOVEREIGN RIGHT AND THE GLOBAL LEFT | 147 involving international collaboration, he acted with free will and apparent clarity of conscience. I juxtapose these two individuals not for any moral comparison. Rather, it is to demonstrate that on the basis of facts alone, the differ ences that matter cannot be explicated. If the political logic of both acts was similarly perverse, their effect on the U.S. political imagi nary was worlds apart. McVeigh's crime left private families with an irreparable loss, but the state was fully vindicated. Atta, whose immolation prevented retribution, turned a self-understood democ racy inside out, launching two wars of aggression abroad and a xeno phobic witch hunt at home that initiated secret surveillance against citizen and foreigner alike, and produced at Guantanamo Bay an extra constitutional juridical space, a black hole in the legal order where none of the rights of defendants is protected. Representing no nation, hence no juridically identifiable enemy, Atta and his co-conspirators committed an act of terror that could not be treated as an act of war because it denied the possibility of normal engagement. Government officials immediately compared the Sep tember 11 attack with Pearl Harbor. The analogy to World War II evoked kamikaze airplane bombers that echo in American memory as barbaric. But the box-cutters brought aboard by Atta's group were not military weapons, the World Trade Center was not a military tar get, and soldiers in uniform were not the main victims of the attack.4 Their violence defied the idea of national sovereignty as the locus of exclu sive rights to terror, and precisely this defiance could not be tolerated. In the modern world order imposed historically by the West, nation-states claim a monopoly as the expression of collective, polit ical will and, hence, of the legitimate use of violence. In the landscape of the collective imagination, "only nation-states have sovereignty and only national citizens have rights. . . . Within the territorial sys tem of nation-states, all politics is geopolitics. The enemy is situated within a geographical landscape. The dividing line between friend and foe is the national frontier. Transgressing that frontier is the causus belli; overpowering military force determines the victor, and peace 'brings about a redistribution of territorial sovereignty'" (Buck-Morss, Dreamworld and Catastrophe, 23). Only within this context is the United States a military superpower, so that the real threat is an enemy who refuses to engage on its terrain.</page><page sequence="4">148 | SUSAN BUCK-MORSS Benedict Anderson has asked just how new the September 11 attack really was. He is absolutely correct in pointing out that the methods of Islamic extremists can be placed within the time-honored tradition of anarchist militancy. There is, indeed, much to be gained from comparing Al-Qaeda to the anarchists of anti-imperialist move ments since the late nineteenth century. Globally minded "assassins, some of whom could well be described as early suicide-bombers, understood themselves as acting for a world-audience of news agen cies, newspapers, religious progressives, working-class and peasant organizations, and so on" (Anderson, Under Three Flags, 4).5 But method and goal are not the same thing, as Partha Chatterjee has ob served.6 The ideological commitment of the decentralized Al-Qaeda movement is not to anarchism; nor is it simply to oppose U.S. super power. Rather, its violence evokes an alternative world order that calls on God himself for justification, an understanding of sovereign force that is transcendent rather than territorial, disorienting rather than reorienting, challenging the present geopolitical landscape with out clearly specifying a new one. The theorist who has dealt most insightfully with sovereign force as the principle of world order is the twentieth-century German pro fessor of jurisprudence, Carl Schmitt, notorious for his compromised intellectual role in Weimar and Nazi Germany. Schmitt's published texts contain deplorably anti-Semitic arguments; he openly endorsed Hitler in the 1930s, and never recanted his cooperation with the Nazi regime. At the same time, his historical knowledge of European inter national law was impressive, and his ability to name what ruling ide ologies refused even to acknowledge was recognized among leftist intellectuals in the 1920s including, controversially, the young Walter Benjamin. In the past few years, Schmitt's ideas have influenced crit ical analyses of the Bush administration, specifically those policies that destroy democracy in order to save it. A significant body of liter ature has evolved regarding this macabre dialectics of democratic sovereignty, but this debate is for my purposes not the most relevant.7 I will speak, rather, of Schmitt's concept of the nomos, the legitimat ing world order, which he developed after World War II in writings concerned with international rather than domestic politics, including U.S. foreign policy specifically. These texts bring to the contemporary critical discussion, to Foucauldian cultural analyses of biopower and</page><page sequence="5">SOVEREIGN RIGHT AND THE GLOBAL LEFT | 149 Marxian preoccupations with the global economy, an otherwise absent dimension, the specifically political nature of global power?political in the old-fashioned, institutional sense of the word, meaning sover eignty, legitimacy, violence, and war. These traditional categories of international relations have been strikingly muted, even missing from where one would most expect to find them, the social sciences in general and political science (my home department) in particular. The latter discipline has tended to abandon political history for the attractions of economics, with its computer models and apparent relevance to those in power. A new subfield has developed in recent years, international political economy (IPE), deemed necessary to handle political issues that have arisen because of global economic realities. Its discourse is symptomatic, revolving around one central question: Given new developments in the global economy and the supranational institutions created to con trol them (IMF, World Bank, G-7, GATT), what will be the fate of the nation-state? Are we heading towards a postnational, global economic order, and if so, is this tendency to be celebrated or resisted? What is not new in this discussion is precisely the conceptual landscape in which these terms are deployed. The relative impor tance of the economy versus the state has been debated for several centuries, arguably since the emergence of "political economy" as a category of analysis in the writings of the Scottish Enlightenment.8 During the nineteenth century, this debate became intensely politi cized under conditions of the industrial revolution. The leading theo rists, who were to have enormous practical influence, were Friedrich List and Karl Marx.9 In order to spare ourselves the pitfalls of histor ical amnesia, it will be helpful to review their positions on this cen tral issue of the relationship between economy and state. List, the earlier and today lesser-known figure, was highly influ ential in his time (Marx felt it necessary to attack his ideas explicitly). In advocating, as a means of nation-building, government-protected industrialization (import substitution policies and public investment in infrastructures), List asserted the essential compatibility of the economy and state. The policies he proposed were adopted by both Germany and the United States in the nineteenth century, and by countries in the twentieth century as politically diverse as Chile, Turkey, South Korea, and, ironically, the Soviet Union.10</page><page sequence="6">150 | SUSAN BUCK-MORSS Against List, Marx claimed that economic, hence class interests were determining "in the last instance" (see the introduction to the Grundrisse), hence political attempts to control economic development at the level of state policy were necessarily limited in their effects. The state had at best only "relative autonomy" (Althusser) in curbing the minority interests of the dominating, capitalist class. The state might compensate in part through legal interventions for class distortions of social and economic equality, but it could never be truly democra tic, never adequately embody the interests of the working majority, that were structurally antithetical to those of the capitalist class. The Marxist challenge to politics in both theory and practice was that the state is essentially an epiphenomenon. There can be no political solu tion to the class war short of destroying the class structure of society along with all of its institutional apparatuses including, centrally, the bourgeois-democratic, i.e., capitalist, nation-state.11 Since the fall of the Soviet Union and China's participation in global markets, Marxist po litical organizing has become a marginal endeavor. But the century old debate still resonates in the academy, although its power and even its will to effect real politics have been severely curtailed. What has endured is the tendency to dismiss sovereignty as a determining factor in political life. States have territories, nations have interests, and rulers connive to stay in power, but sovereignty itself is rarely discussed, except to declare its waning significance.12 To give an example from the new field of international political econ omy, the influential founding theorist, Susan Strange, who represents its most critical branch, can be called Marxian only in the realist sense of positivist social science, when she acknowledges the overwhelming power of the global economy to shape and limit the political agency of nation-states.13 Her position echoes the insight of Leon Trotsky ear lier in the century that the state has become too narrow for the econ omy, which will not be administered for the interest of one ethnic group. Trotsky's conclusion is that anticolonial struggles cannot be content with national liberation but must insist on international soli darity to enact "permanent revolution" that does not stop short of global transformation. Strange, while sharing his skepticism regard ing political agency on the national level, does not identify, much less champion an alternative global movement of resistance?and as a con sequence, her analysis shares common conceptual ground with those</page><page sequence="7">SOVEREIGN RIGHT AND THE GLOBAL LEFT | 151 who celebrate global market dominance and the "minimalist state" as the happy outcome of the end of history. Those of us in the academy for whom theory is understood as un avoidably, and rightly connected to political practice will find in her form of analysis little inspiration. The traditionally Marxist account in David Harvey's recent book, The New Imperialism, does open up a space for progressive politics in the contradictions he delineates between the logic of global capital and the logic of U.S. imperial ism. But with the lack of an international working-class movement, and with capitalist firms' control of global media, it is not clear, from a Marxist perspective, what forces are best positioned to take advantage of the contradiction. Organizations like the World Social Forum, Amnesty International, Independent Media, and movements for peace, women's rights, and social justice have produced a global counterculture that, while a minority voice within countries, is demo cratically inclusive across and among them. But just how these move ments are to be articulated into an effective political force remains problematic. As cultural expressions of protest, they find it extremely difficult to navigate within a global situation in which cultures are very much at odds, and national differences are easily exploited by domestic politicians.14 Nation-state political structures often frustrate the global consciousness upon which the success of the new social movements depends. Timothy Brennan's new book, Wars of Position, marshals Antonio Gramsci in support of a strategy of national polit ical action, arguing that, given the benefits to global capital from a weakened state, domestic politics aimed at capturing the state is still the necessary, perhaps the only viable Left alternative. Brennan's point is well taken, but his strategy abandons global ground too quickly. I will focus on the nation-state as well, but in order to inform a global political perspective that shifts the debate away from economy versus state. Whereas IPE generally and Susan Strange specifically de bate the ways the global economy transcends the nation-state, whereas Marxist political critiques deny the effective power of the state, and Timothy Brennan reaffirms its necessity instrumentally, as an orga nizing tool in order to resist global capital, I will deal with the nature of sovereign power that all of these approaches fail to acknowledge: The state is not only a means of wielding power in connection with socioeconomic forces. It is power. The state not only makes laws; it</page><page sequence="8">152 | SUSAN BUCK-MORSS embodies the Law (capital "L") that makes laws legal. It is not just a legislating or administrating state, but a sovereign state. And no modern theorist has emphasized the distinction more relentlessly, or with more historical astuteness than Carl Schmitt. IL The Law that makes laws legal is established by a prior exercise of sovereign power. Schmitt describes it as "a constitutive historical event?an act of legitimacy, whereby the legality of a mere law first is made meaningful" (Schmitt, Nomos, 73). The Law is not itself the written Constitution, but the unwritten imperative that precedes it as an orientation, a sovereign positioning in space that is documented by the Constitution as a fait accompli. Sovereign power exists before and beside the state, and can never be subsumed within it. As such, it can be considered transcendent power. Carl Schmitt calls it nomos, the ancient Greek word for Law. And whereas laws (nomoi) are multiple and changing, they appeal to the Law for their legitimation. Schmitt reserves the term nomos for Law in this second sense, as constituting power that bestows upon the laws their sovereign legitimacy.15 The term nomos is productive, because in distinguishing between sovereign power and mere state power, it allows us to see something that otherwise remains hidden. It is this aspect of Schmitt's thought that I find useful, fully aware that my use may not be what he in tended. The point, after all, is not to put Schmitt on trial, but to put on trial those elements of his ideas that will allow us to judge with clar ity the present political crisis. When, as is common, given the legal positivism that underlies liberal approaches to political science and democratic theory, "sovereignty" is equated with "autonomy," the distinction disappears.16 Autonomy?auto-noraos?seems to deny the existence of any problem that needs to be addressed, reducing sover eign power to a tautology: states are said to be self-governing because they make their own laws (nomoi). Their sovereignty is the power to render their legal system legitimate by enforcing domestic obedi ence.17 The nation-state system would then be simply an aggregate of independent units, each one autochthonous, immanent to itself. What, however, is the aggregating force that holds them together as a</page><page sequence="9">SOVEREIGN RIGHT AND THE GLOBAL LEFT | 153 system at all? By what sovereign power is the international space con stituted, the global world order in which state actions are deployed? It is a sheer fiction to posit that preexisting autonomous nations come together and decide freely to yield their separate sovereign powers and submit to a world order of their own making. On the contrary, nations are allowed into the world order if, and only if, they obey the ordering principle of that world, and this ordering principle is pre cisely what the word nomos allows us to capture.18 We can understand Schmitt's distinction as an empirical reality, by considering specific examples from our own era. Cuba today is a nation-state that makes its own laws. But according to the U.S. dominated order, its laws are not legitimate. Hence, Cuba, while clearly autonomous, and while claiming that it is sovereign, is not, insofar as its sovereign status is determined by a power external to its own borders, that which the Bush regime euphemistically calls the "world community," that is, the U.S. hegemonic Order that recog nizes order, the sovereign force of Law that legitimates laws. It is protested by liberal theorists that because Cuba is not a multiparty democracy, it lacks the internal legitimacy that would require other nations to recognize its sovereignty.19 While violating liberalism's own myth of the autonomy of nations (which does not specify the form of the law-making body), this argument does not even have merit on moral grounds. Translated into policy, it attempts to ostracize Cuba from the community of nations and initiate a trade boycott that punishes Cuba's civilian population, precisely the peo ple whose democratic rights it purports to defend.20 A more recent case: Hamas was elected in a highly participatory, democratic, and fair process as the new government of Palestine, and nonetheless, the recognition of its sovereignty is presumed by the Western powers to be theirs to bestow or withhold?by diplomacy or by force, even if, rather than military occupation, the means of force is economic strangulation.21 Schmitt's demystifications were every bit as keen as those of Karl Marx, whose critical powers he admired.22 They led him, however, to cynical realism combined with a spiritual conservatism that allowed him to make his peace with Germany's fascist regime. We need not follow him here. Moral norms are not merely tools of existing power, and the founding of a new nomos is not based solely on brute force.</page><page sequence="10">154 | SUSAN BUCK-MORSS Today's international norms (democracy, human rights, freedom, equality) remain as the ideal residues of the founding act of revolu tionary assemblies, while positive laws are their inadequate, merely actual condition. Norms are valuable politically, because the deficien cies of the merely given state of things can be exposed in their name.23 This is immanent criticism, a tool of political practice that was bril liantly deployed by figures like Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, and Sayyid Qutb in the twentieth century, and could not have been effective without the transnational regimes of norms to which they appealed. The present-day political crisis is different, however, from the post-World War II context of their acts. Our state of emergency is caused not simply by a gap between the "is" and the "ought," but by the crumbling of the "ought," the historical transitoriness of the world order itself. The nomos that legitimates this system prevails not only over history, monopolizing the meaning of historical time, but also in history, hence subject to temporal disintegration. Its decay leads us to consider the philosophy of history, as well as the history of philosophy. We shall see that in this double movement an escape from Schmitt's cynical realism becomes possible. HI. Is the order established by the dominant powers simply the means whereby their particular interests are equated with the general or universal interest? Is nomos just a fancy Greek term for imperial hegemony? Not quite, and this is where Schmitt adds an important supplement to the Marxist analysis. If nomos is equated with hege mony, avoiding the whole issue of sovereign power, the political struggle moves to the sociocultural level, where critical theory is reduced to exposing the constructedness of subjects and their self understandings.24 Causality, severed from historical concreteness, floats in a mythic space, where forms of thought and cultural practice are seen as hegemonic because they guarantee imperial control, and either this outcome is attributed to conscious intentions of all knowing political and economic actors (reductionist Marxism), or it is presumed that such forms have intentional effects in themselves</page><page sequence="11">SOVEREIGN RIGHT AND THE GLOBAL LEFT | 155 (Hegelian idealism), even if, by some cunning of class reason, the imperialists remain unconscious of this fact and truly believe the cul ture they promote does represent the interests of all of humanity.25 There is another, related issue. If power is a question of cultural hege mony, the implication is that a counterculture will be the legitimating glue of what might be called a counter-nom/c, or better, anti-nomial movement that can defeat it. But the anti-nomos, dependent on the nomos for meaning, still ultimately faces the question of a new order, with unsatisfactory alternatives of a counterstate, leaving the door open for revolutionary dictatorship, or, if the state is supposed to wither away, then an anarchist Utopia, a minimal, merely administra tive state, not easily distinguished from neoliberalism's global gover nance of, and by the economy. Either way, the problem of sovereign power remains unexamined and unresolved. The explanatory model of culture is shared by an unlikely bed fellow, Samuel Huntington, in his description of the clash of civili zations. For him, the term civilization is a "cultural" rather than a political entity, one that implies "shared norms," but he takes a step towards Schmitt when he recognizes that a specific civilization is shared among nations and groups who may be in violent conflict among themselves: "[T]he world may be in chaos, but it is not totally without order," he writes, and Schmitt would agree. World order, as sovereign order, is totally compatible with war (Huntington, Clash of Civilizations, 52). But Huntington's thesis needs to be turned on its head before it will be useful as critical theory. Cultures?always borrowing, always being borrowed?belong exclusively to no civi lization, and therefore cannot define "civilization" or produce a clash between them. Rather, a political clash on the level of the nomos, in the name of conflicting civilizations, produces the sense of cultural difference that is then mistaken as its source and manipulated for power-political goals. Huntington's "civilizations" are hypostasized, taken as given and to a certain extent immutable. Connected vaguely to world religion, vaguely to political empires, vaguely even to genetic lines of descent, they presume what needs to be explained (40-48).26 The West may be the "dominant civilization," but what orders the West's order? By what historical process, by what sovereign power, did it come to be constituted in the first place? There is a stan dard answer to this question. Ask any educated Westerner what the</page><page sequence="12">156 | SUSAN BUCK-MORSS founding moment was, and you will hear that the modern world order of nation-states began with the treaty of Westphalia of 1648. Schmitt is surprisingly uninterested in Westphalia.27 He places the origins several centuries earlier. And his move backwards in time, rather than making his theories more remote, gives to them strikingly contemporary actuality. The nomos as a "constitutive act of spatial ordering . . . turns a part of the earth's surface into the forcefield of a particular order" (Schmitt, Nomos, 70-71). The political, social, and religious order of a people "becomes visible in the appropriation of land" (70).28 The right (Recht, droit, derecho) to order the world in a certain way is the claim of sovereign power that embodies and enacts legitimacy, preceding and "nourishing" the laws that follow it.29 This is the nomos, and it has a sacred character: "In the beginning was the fence," writes Schmitt, citing Hans Niedermeyer and other scholars of Aristotle's use of the word nomos: "The enclosure gave birth to the shrine by removing it from the ordinary, placing it under its own laws, and entrusting it to the divine" (74).30 Schmitt locates the origins of the first global, hence modern nomos in a one-time historical event: the "discovery" in the late fifteenth century of an entire hemisphere, the so-called "New World." Strug gles over land and sea appropriations of this world "began immedi ately," as the European powers made claims to its surface (86) .31 But what gave legitimacy to their claims was the sovereign authority of God. Sanctioned by the Roman Catholic Church as sovereign over the universum Europaeium and its legal order, the appropriation of the newly discovered territory was a process of legitimate (i.e., sovereign) violence. Schmitt considers decisive the line drawn by Pope Alexan der VI, May 4, 1494, along a meridian from the north pole to the south, granting Spain the right to "newly discovered lands" west of the line and Portugal the right to such lands to the east (88).32 The pope's enactment of the first planetary appropriation established the modern nomos as a Christian project, and a Christianizing one. What is so interesting in Schmitt's historical account is that he sees this act of founding the modern nomos in terms, not of sovereign legitimacy within European countries, but of imperial legitimacy with out. In describing Europe's claim of sovereign authority to engage in a massive project of land grabbing on the level of global space, Schmitt</page><page sequence="13">SOVEREIGN RIGHT AND THE GLOBAL LEFT | 157 is an early and uncompromising commentator on the founding of the Eurocentric world order: From the 16th to the 20th century, European international law con sidered Christian nations to be the creators and representatives of an order applicable to the whole earth. The term "European" meant the normal status that set the standard for the non-European part of the earth. Civilization was synonymous with European civilization. (86) Moreover, Schmitt is brutally honest regarding the fact that the protec tion and mutual recognition afforded within the new order?includ ing, centrally, the legitimacy of land appropriation?applied only to Europeans, not the New World's original inhabitants, whose rights and, indeed, whose very existence were not recognized by the law. "Most essential and decisive for the following centuries," he observes, "was the fact that the emerging new world did not appear as a new enemy, but as free space, as an area open to European occupation and expansion" that existed "beyond the line" where legal, moral, and political values were recognized (87, 94)?as if empty of the people who, he notes wryly, never ask to be discovered.33 Schmitt, himself a believer in European civilizational superiority, does not tarry on this point, but we can. Global domination by the European powers had its historical roots in their shared experience of Christian law that provided a com mon geopolitical orientation, binding despite rivalries and war. Their sense of entitlement, their right to determine right became a part of the European patrimony. The patri-nomos, the global order bequeathed by the fathers, took on an ontological aura. To future generations who moved in changing patterns within it, it was order itself, presumed as legitimate long after the papacy lost sovereign power over its par ticipants. In this sense, Westphalia can be understood as the first for getting of nomic origins, and consequently the first ontologizing of the Eurocentric order. On the one hand, the principles of the Treaty of Westphalia did create a totally new order, in that the European powers pulled free of Roman imperial and Roman papal control, establishing their sovereign independence in matters both secular and religious. Schmitt writes that the "detheologization" of relations within Europe allowed for "real progress" in limiting warfare and humanizing its execution by bracketing "creedal disputes that had</page><page sequence="14">158 | SUSAN BUCK-MORSS justified the worst atrocities" (140-41).34 On the other hand, however, and it is the aspect that concerns us most deeply, post-Westphalian Europe continued its global exercise of power without abrogating the self-understood, divinely ordained, still vaguely Christian Right to determine right, and without applying the bracketed, humanizing practice of violence to its non-European dominions. As for the origi nal inhabitants of the "free spaces" to be occupied, treatment of them was worse, not better, as a consequence of "detheologization." In keeping with our interest in the global implications of the post-Westphalian order, we read Schmitt's works with a different emphasis. Intriguing are his comments, in a small book on Hobbes's Leviathan (first published in 1651, just a few years after the Westphalia treaty), on the famous title-page image, which Schmitt interprets in reference to the medieval Christian nomos. With "typical British humor," Schmitt writes, Hobbes chooses Leviathan as the name for the new, state-political sovereign power?"not just any kind of beast," but the monster from the sea that evokes the biblical image of the anti-Christ (Schmitt, Leviathan, 6-7). This antinomial variant of Christian sovereignty, a humanly constructed artifice, embarks the British sovereign on a sea-appropriation that will enable the global spread of the British Empire. Schmitt fails to comment on the fact that the pseudoscientific credo of race surpassed religion in nineteenth-century Europe as the justification for global domination.35 But his critical insight is invalu able when, de-emphasizing the significance of internal revolutions? the English Puritans and, a century later, the French Jacobins?he focuses instead on the comprehensive spatial order that Europe sus tains (Nomos, 188). These revolutions, so central to contemporary dem ocratic theories of sovereignty, are for Schmitt an unfortunate return to the excesses of morally based politics, a secularized form of the wars of religion that pit the forces of good against evil in a struggle limitless in scope, absolute in definition, and universal in its sover eign claims?moral excesses that he sees as returning again in the for eign policy of twentieth-century America. Before considering Schmitt's bitter critique of the United States, however, we need to look at one more meaning of Law that emerges in the nineteenth century relevant to the issue of global sovereignty: the economy, or oiko-nomos. In response to those today who optimistically</page><page sequence="15">SOVEREIGN RIGHT AND THE GLOBAL LEFT | 159 envision a postsovereign global order held in check by a world econ omy that is self-regulating through market laws, Schmitt's discussion of the sovereign force of nomos provides a corrective (although he himself did not elaborate this point). Markets have no "constitution," no capacity to orient space; their so-called laws fail to recognize the prior act of positing. They are assumed, like natural laws, to have no origin but only causal effects. Nomos can never mean law in this quasi-natural, quasi-scientific sense. Rather, it is the consequence of a historical process.36 The market considers the contractual alienation of property, not its appropriation, exchange rather than original distribution. It thereby presumes the inequality of possession that precedes exchange. Sovereign power sanctions precisely the original alienation of property that is not the consequence of contract, so that subsequent law can guarantee the right of property, what Kant called "the distributive law of mine and thine" (Kant quoted in Schmitt, Nomos, 70), however unjustly it was originally acquired?just as revo lutionary America did in its founding act, recorded in a Constitution that affirmed the right of (male property-holding) citizens to appro priate the labor of their human property, African slaves; and just as the U.S. Supreme Court of the late nineteenth century did in extend ing to corporations the same constitutional protections as persons with rights.37 The legitimating force of the nomos not only guarantees present ownership of property but also anticipates new appropriations of land, labor, and every value produced by nature and by culture. Schmitt observes (affirmatively) that in the course of the nineteenth century, private property rights were recognized within Europe as transcending those of state sovereignty (196-97).38 It meant that, as a consequence of war, your land or factory might end up being Ger man instead of French, or French instead of German, but it would still be yours. The violence of appropriation, invisible within market accounts of the global order, remains visible in Schmitt's historical account of the continuity, throughout five centuries, of the Western sense of enti tlement to enact global ordering projects.39 The content might change, and has in fundamental ways, varying from the outright imperialist projects of nineteenth-century Europe to the United Nations and postcolonial vision of the twentieth. But the important thing is that even in the latter, arguably progressive case, it is the imperial powers</page><page sequence="16">160 | SUSAN BUCK-MORSS themselves who gave up their colonies after World War II, hence remaining the self-appointed order-makers of the world, while in no way excluding rivalry, conflict, or war. And just this Right to deter mine right is claimed by the United States when it launches a war of aggression to accomplish "regime change" in Iraq. IV. In the proliferation of debates that have surrounded Carl Schmitt in recent years, his positions have become stereotyped, and his critical acumen has been diluted.40 Particularly problematic is the frequency with which Giorgio Agamben is taken as a substitute for Schmitt himself, as Agamben has been part of the stereotyping and diluting process. The same can be said for the figure of Leo Strauss, who trained Paul Wolfowitz and his neoconservative cohorts in what is claimed to be a diabolical Schmittian realism. The whole issue of the Weimar democracy's dissolution into fascism which dominates the most influential secondary accounts (Scheuerman, Between the Norm and the Exception; McCormick, Carl Schmitt's Critique; Kennedy, Constitutional Failure) pays too little attention to that part of Schmitt's critique that had little to do with the end of the Weimar Republic, and a great deal to do with our own political situation. Schmitt focused on the international terrain, and we will benefit if we do likewise? because however Schmitt may have changed his tune during the late years of Weimar or missed the real danger regarding German politics, and however indefensible his political loyalties may have been, he saw with consistent accuracy the dangers of the new and rising global power of the twentieth century, the United States. Srinivas Aravamudan gets it right: Written after 1950, The Nomos of the Earth is in part a coded animosity in response to the victory of the United States and its orchestration of the extrajudicial sovereignty of the Allied Powers as demonstrated by the Nuremberg trials. The text is prescient in its anxious anticipation of the United Sates as the new global hyperpower. (Aravamudan, "Carl Schmitt's Nomos," 234) Schmitt's animosity to the United States was not new with the Nuremberg Trials, however (which threatened him personally with</page><page sequence="17">SOVEREIGN RIGHT AND THE GLOBAL LEFT | 161 prosecution for several years). Throughout Schmitt's writing career, he was concerned with how the United States was changing the rules of the game in international politics. As a German, he was on the receiving end of Wilsonian idealism after World War I, which spear headed the blame of Germany for the war, inscribed in the Treaty of Versailles an unprecedented clause of guilt, and punished Germany through the punitive requirements of economic reparations. Germany plunged into economic chaos during the 1920s. The inflation was astro nomical, and this, rather than any ontology of the democratic state of exception, was a fundamental cause of the crisis of the Weimar Republic?a crisis that its so-called "safe" parliamentarian liberal order was powerless to control, despite repeated attempts of its statesmen in the international political arena (from the 1922 Rapallo Treaty to the 1925 Locarno Treaty, and beyond). If the economic punishment that hobbled the Weimar regime was supposed to prevent Germany from starting another war, as history makes clear, it failed miserably to accomplish its policy goal. Surely Schmitt was a conservative, even reactionary critic of U.S. foreign policy, blaming it for the introduction of a moral, "spaceless" universalism that disoriented and upset the existing European nomos while failing, due to its isolationism, to provide a new one. But in his perception of how American moral claims to legitimacy were the means of usurping hegemony within the European world order, that began with Wilsonian idealism and have continued, as we can see, with remarkable consistency in the rhetoric of George W. Bush today, Schmitt comes strikingly close to contemporary critics on the Left in tracing the historical origins of U.S. imperialism. In fact, much of his description in The Nomos of the Earth of Wilsonian internationalism and its later global repercussions is in full accord with the account given by the Marxist critical geographer Neil Smith in his new book, The Endgame of Globalization. Careful, critical scholarship on Schmitt makes this clear. Chantal Mouffe comments on an (untranslated) arti cle Schmitt published in 1932: Schmitt saw the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928 as representing a further step in the attempt by Washington to establish its global hegemony. After Woodrow Wilson forced the Society of Nations to recognize the Monroe Doctrine in its article 21?a recognition that amounted to acknowledging the superiority of American principles?the Americans</page><page sequence="18">162 | SUSAN BUCK-MORSS managed through the ... Pact to take away from the Society of Nations the power to make the crucial decisions about world peace. (Mouffe, "Schmitt's Vision," 245)41 John P. McCormick writes that during the Nazi era, Schmitt de veloped a conception of Grossraum for regional control of continental Europe dominated by the German Reich?failing to mention, how ever, that the term Grossraum is precisely the word Schmitt uses in The Nomos of the Earth to describe the U.S. continental imperialist policy of Manifest Destiny, although Schmitt returns for moral justification to the trans-European universal humanism of the Catholic Church, rather than the nationalist moralism of the United States, the "chosen nation," to justify that policy. The U.S. nineteenth-century policy of Manifest Destiny may in fact have more in common with the Lebens raum that became Hitler's policy of German expansion than we have previously acknowledged.42 If a nationalistic sense of moral superiority was the means whereby, throughout the twentieth century, the United States made its bid for global power, the specific tactics in no way reflected the moral high ground: political assassinations, secret torture, and the institutionalization of all kinds of extralegal procedures, not to men tion the only use of atomic weapons on civilian cities the world has witnessed to date, resulting in close to a quarter of a million civilian fatalities. Alberto Moreiras is correct to see the contemporary rele vance of Schmitt's critique: If the current nomos on the earth is an American nomos, it is because the United States has succeeded in making its own political rhetoric stand in for a kind of universal truth. But, as Schmitt teaches, a nomic order reaches universal validity not because of its moral universality, but rather in virtue of its historical concreteness. Schmitt dates the decline of the European nomic order shortly after the 1885 Congo Conference, when a sort of American propelled "general universalism" came to re place the until-then dominant jus publicum Europeaeum paradigm in international law. (Moreiras, "Against Cultural-Political Closure," 228) Of course, the Congo Conference was an insult to African people, re fusing to recognize the legitimacy of native participation. But one does not need to come to Schmitt's political conclusion to benefit from his nonideological presentation of the facts. The standard of immanent criticism allows us to redeem both the (Catholic) legal-humanism for</page><page sequence="19">SOVEREIGN RIGHT AND THE GLOBAL LEFT | 163 which Schmitt is so nostalgic and the U.S. "general universalism" that came to replace it. The problem of the European nomos was not its legal humanism, but the exclusively European extent of its applica tion, just as the problem today is not the general universalism of the U.S.-dominated nomos but the fact that it comes into conflict with the particular interests of U.S. national sovereignty. This brings me to my final point. With U.S. global dominance at the end of the Cold War, the scene was set for the perfect storm, a doubling of the state of exception, as nomic and national sovereignties converged in the same geographic space. When it becomes a matter of U.S. national interest to preserve its own global hegemony?hegemony that was solidified by a one time, contingent historical event, that is, the implosion of the Soviet Union that left the United States by default as the sole global super power?then both the globe and the nation are caught in a double bind: We are told that the general universalism of U.S. moral princi ples needs to be suspended to meet the threat to this country's par ticular, national-democratic sovereignty, while at the same time, the law and constitutional guarantees specific to the United States need to be suspended domestically to "spread democracy" abroad. This is the self-contradictory and self-defeating situation in which we have been placed by the U.S. government today. The problem was brought to a head by the terrorist attacks of Al-Qaeda, and in my closing comments I will attempt to sketch out the implications. Al-Qaeda is engaged in postnational politics, which makes it immune from the historically specific, Western logic of national sovereignty based on territorial states. But it is preglobal politics, because of the exclusiveness of its sense of community. Like the medieval European nomos, it is based on the idea of religious legit imation: Its founding principle is the sovereignty of God. Like the U.S. nomos, its bid for global hegemony appeals to the general uni versalism of moral right. The limitations of both these conceptions of global order have been demonstrated historically, and radical Islam has not (yet) indicated its capacity, or its will to overcome them. But is the alternative the universalization of the principle of national sov ereignty as advocated by the United States, and does it justify con tinued U.S. global hegemony in order to achieve this? If the United States, having been accidentally granted by history a time of global</page><page sequence="20">164 | SUSAN BUCK-MORSS hegemony, had reversed its imperial past and insisted on practicing its own universal principles rather than suspending them, if it had not argued that on the basis of national interests it could not ratify the Kyoto agreements, could not join the International Criminal Court, could not assent to UN control of the disarmament process in Iraq? if, in short, the United States, as the means for spreading democracy, had actually practiced democracy on a global scale, the answer might be yes. But precisely such a practice of democracy has been seen as inimical to the national interests of the United States. U.S. democra tic legitimacy as a sovereign nation is on a collision course with U.S. hegemonic legitimacy as a nomic sovereign. This collision has the force to break the old nomos?without, however, when it crumbles, being capable of guaranteeing a new order to replace it. The double indemnity that the world faces when these two sover eign principles collide, seen from the seat of power, leads the sover eign himself into a double bind. And this has important implications for political praxis?important, because the problem is not exclu sively that of the Republican administration. It is no accident that the Democratic Party finds very little in principle that it would change in U.S. foreign policy, were it to win the presidency, as the protection of U.S. hegemonic status within a U.S.-instigated global world order is not (yet) considered by any mainstream candidate to be negotiable. Building on Walter Benjamin's Trauerspiel,43 we can understand the crumbling of the nomos from the perspective of the philosophy of history: sovereign action does not cause history, nor does it merely reflect historical forces; rather, as Benjamin says, it expresses history, and at certain historical moments, it is precisely the incapacity to act that needs to be read as significant. In the German tragic dramas, the sovereign was Catholic and the historical moment was the Counter Reformation. His inability to decide, and hence to determine history's outcome, expressed the crumbling of the Catholic religious order. Today it is the national sovereign, personified by George W. Bush, who enacts "history" daily, televised live and globally transmitted. Bush has shown us repeatedly that he can decide?indeed, with dic tatorial bluntness?but his decisions do not hold. No matter how he pushes against it, history does not budge, because at this moment, meaningful history is not his to enact?a situation that parallels that expressed by the Baroque tragic dramas, in which the historical plot</page><page sequence="21">SOVEREIGN RIGHT AND THE GLOBAL LEFT | 165 is replaced by plotting, and the court intriguer plays a central role (Weber, "Taking Exception," 445-47). Enter, stage right, that master plotter and intriguer, Carl Rove. Rove writes the script for Bush, whose role is to act the sovereign part with "resoluteness" and stick with uncompromising stubbornness to the decision he has taken, even though this decision has decided nothing regarding the outcome of history?not in Afghanistan or Iraq, not to speak of the War on Terror. The war of positions today must envision nothing less than the constitution of a democratic global order, a new nomos, the legitimacy of which can be recognized as truly universal because it subjects the original, European-global appropriation of land, wealth, and resources to new principles of social justice, drawing from the work of global social movements already taking place. The strategic war in which we are engaged is centrally concerned with sovereignty, law, legitimacy, and the Right to establish right. In the United States, that war needs to be waged on two fronts: against suspending national justice to combat terrorists around the world, and against suspending global justice to defend national sovereignty at home. Mohammed Atta and Timothy McVeigh were equally wrong in their strategy of resistance. We who are part of a global Left today need, on both fronts, to get it equally right. Notes 1. See Buck-Morss, Dreamworld and Catastrophe, chapter 1. My definition differs from Schmitt, who in The Concept of the Political famously distinguished between the public enemy (hostis) and the private enemy (inimicus), but failed to consider the category of the enemy on a metalevel, one who threatens the con ceptual frame itself (as opposed to the enemy who conforms to existing norms of enemy behavior). This concept is in line with Hegel's definition of the enemy as "absolute negativity" to which Schmitt with a less absolute meaning refers (Schmitt, Concept of the Political, 53), although his explicit connection of Hegel with Lukacs in fact points in the direction of the absolute enemy as developed here. 2.

Chatterjee's commentary on a presentation by Anderson took place in New York City at Columbia University's Society for the Humanities in fall 2004. 7. See particularly the mediated reception of Schmitt via Giorgio Agam ben's book, State of Exception. 8. Tellman ("The Economy") traces to Malthus the conceptual split of the economy from the political, arguing that this division was itself political philoso phy, of great consequence for subsequent thinkers. See Tellman and also my arti cle, "Envisioning Capital." 9. On List and Marx, see Szporluk, Communism and Nationalism. 10. Under Stalin's policy of "socialism in one country," the proletarian rev olution was transformed into a nationalist project of economic modernization and the United States was the model to be emulated (Buck-Morss, in Dreamworld and Catastrophe, makes that argument at length). 11. This Marxist hypothesis was repeatedly evoked, tested, and debated in the twentieth century, not only by the official, Soviet-led Third International but also among working-class movements within industrialized countries and national liberation movements without. Results could only be inconclusive, as neither variable acts in isolation: the class struggle is never free from international power influences (e.g., the case of the Spanish Civil War), and the international Marxist movement is never free from domestic political pressures (e.g., the Ger man Socialist vote for war credits in 1914). 12. See the work of Krasner (Sovereignty, who defined sovereignty famously as "organized hypocrisy." 13. See Strange (Retreat of the State), who diagnosed the shift from territorial based empires, the earlier European model, to today's imperial competition for market shares, evident in Japan-Europe-U.S. global competition in the 1980s. Her structural approach identified the authority of nonstate actors (the World Bank, IMF, NGOs) as more effective agents in what she calls "governance" of the global economy. See, in contrast (as a continuation of the state versus economy debate), the work of Kindelberger (World in Depression; Manias, Panics and Crashes), who argued that the global economy needed a national "hegemon" to ensure its functioning. 14. Eisenstein (Against Empire) shows rare skill in making this navigation. 15. Schmitt's early writings have been interpreted as justifying dictatorial sovereign power as the cure for parliamentarian indecision, and in fact, his insis tence on the extralegal power of the sovereign in a state of emergency or exception makes this conclusion plausible, because in these texts he gives no other loca tion of sovereignty but the domestic state. Implied is voluntarism: the domestic leader appears personally to be the source of extralegal power in the constitut ing act. But Schmitf s postwar concept of the nomos positions sovereignty histor ically and structurally rather than in the personality of the leader. Sovereignty is</page><page sequence="23">SOVEREIGN RIGHT AND THE GLOBAL LEFT | 167 not only outside of domestic legality but also inside of another juridical space, that of international law, in a way that changes the parameters of the problem significantly. 16. The paradigm of the autonomous state is exemplified by the work of Waltz in the 1980s. The recent "new sovereignty" debates in the field of international relations have criticized this model, elaborating the necessarily relational nature of sovereignty, which may be compromised when national interest warrants it. 17. "[T]he word nomos is useful for us," he writes, "because it shields per ceptions of the current world situation from the confusion of legal positivism, in particular ... dealing with domestic matters of state" (Schmitt, Nomos, 69). 18. John Bolton's comments, e.g., that the UN's existence can be justified only insofar as this organization furthers U.S. national interests, are disturbing because they admit the truth of power without the fictional facade. The whole conception of "rogue states" presumes the extranational source of sovereign legit imacy. See the excellent article by Noam Chomsky ("Rogue States"). 19. This argument was extended to justify the invasion of Iraq in 2003. 20. Cuba joined the Non-Aligned Movement in 1959 as a challenge to the hegemonic order; it supported the PLO and African national liberation move ments, and today continues to seek to improve trade and diplomatic relations with the Middle East. Moreover, Cuba has important trading partners in Europe, and it can be noted that the more these traditional allies of the United States act against hegemonic definitions, the shakier the whole Order must become. If Venezuela and Cuba today are most vociferous in challenging U.S. hegemony as a matter of national policy, their counter-nom/c actions simply underscore the point that nation-state legitimacy is not simply a matter of domestic concern. 21. The same means is now threatened against Iran, while Israel's inva sion of Lebanon in July 2006 that destroyed much of the economic infrastructure is another example of economic punishment as a political weapon. Similarly, the World Bank and IMF use economic tools for "disciplining" states through structural readjustment policies that have clear political effects. Criticizing the hypocrisy of liberal theory, Schmitt describes as "astonishingly systematic and consistent" the implicit "polarity of ethics and economics" within the twentieth century world order (Schmitt, Concept of the Political, 9)?as if these poles could ever be held apart in the real world. As for what scholars of international relations today call regimes of norms, he would consider them political alliances that func tion to preserve the international status quo (see 56; his example of a regime of norms is the League of Nations). 22. Schmitt not only influenced theorists on the left; he read their work and was influenced by it, not only Marx but Benjamin, Lenin, and Lukacs. 23. This task is not considered to be scientifically relevant or even legitimate by theorists of international norms who, like legal positivists, accept the given world, rather than tracing it to its source. In his recent book, Katzenstein describes the American world order: "Imperium is a concept I use for analytical rather than historical reasons.... This is how I use the concept here: the conjoining of power</page><page sequence="24">168 | SUSAN BUCK-MORSS that has both territorial and non-territorial dimensions" (Katzenstein, World of Regions, 2). 24. Brennan is particularly good here in distinguishing between the cul turalist politics of Foucauldian and Althusserian inheritors of Gramsci, and Gramsci's original understanding of hegemony: "a revolution is a genuine revo lution and not just empty, swollen rhetorical demagoguery, only when it is embodied in some type of State, only when it becomes an organized system of power. Society can only exist in the form of a State, which is the source and the end of all rights and duties" (Brennan, Wars of Position, 252). 25. Harvey presumes such a cunning of class reason when he suggests the possibility of a smooth hegemonic interlock between U.S. national interests and those of the global capitalist class: "while we know enough about decision making in the foreign policy establishment... to conclude that the U.S. always put its own interests first, sufficient benefits flowed to the propertied classes in enough countries to make U.S. claims to be acting in the universal (read 'proper tied') interest credible and to keep subaltern groups (and client states) gratefully in line" (Harvey, New Imperialism, 40). 26. When Huntington refers to "the West and the rest" (Clash of Civilizations, 33), he comes to the political point. The globe is not divided among discrete civi lizations, but, rather, dominated by one. 27. Westphalia is significant for Schmitt, but only as a later stage, after Europe's positing of a "comprehensive" global order. The principles of West phalia apply exclusively within Europe (discussed below). 28. Nomos is "the Greek word for the first measure of all subsequent mea sures, for the first land-appropriation understood as the first partition and classi fication of space, for the primeval division and distribution, is nomos" (Schmitt, Nomos, 67). The active aspect of the act of land appropriation connects nomos linguistically to "nomad." 29. The ordering power of the nomos is captured in the German word Gesetz, which, Schmitt notes, is the distinction of divinely given law from human laws in the Lutheran Bible (Nomos, 70, 81). The anthropomorphic equation of nomos with the sovereign as a person ("king, ruler, despot, and tyrant") is in this late text by Schmitt one possible meaning of sovereignty, which can also be understood as a "singular act," a "constitutive distribution," also house, fence, and enclosure (72 74). Note that the language of the "state of exception" is absent from his discussion. 30. Hans Niedermeyer's article of 1939 may well have been a justification of Hitler's policy of annexing German-populated lands, the notorious Lebensraum. Interesting is Schmitt's description, later in the text, to nineteenth-century Amer ican continental expansion, Manifest Destiny, as a policy of Grossraum. This point is discussed below. 31. "Lines were drawn to divide and distribute the whole earth . . . during the first stage of the new planetary consciousness of space ... in terms of sur face areas" (Schmitt, Nomos, 86); "the traditional Eurocentric order ... arose from a legendary and unforeseen discovery of a new world, from an unrepeatable</page><page sequence="25">SOVEREIGN RIGHT AND THE GLOBAL LEFT | 169 historical event. Only in fantastic parallels can one imagine a modern recurrence, such as men on their way to the moon discovering a new and hitherto unknown planet" (39). 32. Papal authority, binding on the entire community of Christendom, did not prevent subsequent wars of colonial rivalry; it legitimated their consequences. 33. "From the standpoint of the discovered, discovery as such was never legal. Neither Columbus nor any other discoverer appeared with an entry visa issued by the discovered princes. Discoveries were made without prior permis sion of the discovered. Thus, legal title to discoveries lay in a higher legitimacy. They could be made only by peoples intellectually and historically advanced enough to apprehend the discovered by superior knowledge and consciousness" (Schmitt, Nomos, 132). Proof of cultural superiority was the science that made dis covery possible ("Indians lacked the scientific power of Christian-European rationality" [132]) and this idea, which outlasted the Enlightenment's critique of papal authority, led ultimately to the biological racism that characterized West ern imperialism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Hence, the cultural rationalizations for sovereign legitimacy might change (i.e., the hegemonic dis courses), but the European right (nomos) to appropriate land remained constant. Schmitt's approach here avoids the tendency of Foucauldian approaches to slide into the history of ideas. 34. Detheologization established "states" as sovereign, rather than Crowns, or the Emperor or Pope. Jean Bodin was the leading theorist of this transforma tion (Schmitt, Nomos, 126-27). 35. See above, note 34. In his self-defense at his Nuremberg interrogation, Schmitt explicitly stated that his own spatial concept of expansion (Grossraum) was incompatible with a racial one (see Bendersky, "Schmitt at Nuremberg"). 36. Schmitt is insistent on this: "We must take heed that the word not lose sight of its connection to a historical process?to a constitutive act of spatial ordering" (Schmitt, Nomos, 71). In that sense, to argue that Schmitt is describing the essence, or urform, or ontological first principle of sovereignty is, I believe, incorrect (although this error can easily be deduced from reading Schmitt through Agamben). 37. The principle of corporate personhood was established incrementally by Supreme Court decisions throughout the first half of the twentieth century. In 1886, in the case of Santa Clara County vs. Southern Pacific Railroad, the 14th Amendment was applied to corporations; in 1947 they received the protections of 1st Amendment freedoms extended by the Taft-Hartley Act. Every time civil rights are won, corporations win them too. See www.greens.org. 38. "All civilized states subscribed to the distinction between public and private law." For a critical interpretation of Schmitt on this point, see Buck-Morss, Dreamworld and Catastrophe, 15-17. 39. Within Europe, the monopolization of sovereign power by the territo rial state that detheologized European conflicts after the seventeenth century, hence limiting their destructiveness and binding them by international law, was</page><page sequence="26">170 | SUSAN BUCK-MORSS "nothing short of a miracle ... a marvelous product of human reason," creating a "completely different type of spatial order" (Schmitt, Nomos, 151, 127). But this process of secularization did surprisingly little to change the global order that legitimated the appropriation and possession of non-European land. The terms used in international law did change as the papal awards to Spain and Portugal were superseded, and the historically grounded idea of "discovery" as the source of legitimacy was replaced by the spatial concept of "occupied territory," but this signaled little more than an "unfortunate" forgetting of the pan-European origins of the global expansionary project (126-33). 40. His most relevant texts are not easily available in English: The Nomos of the Earth is inordinately expensive, Leviathan cannot presently be bought in English at any price, and many of his essays remain untranslated. 41. Chantal Mouffe ("Schmitf s Vision") is correct, in my opinion, to insist (against Bruno Bosteels's article in the same journal) that for Schmitt, the domi nance of Europe over the rest of the world is "justified exclusively by the de facto result of domination itself?it is essential for Schmitfs argument that there be no deeper criterion of legality than that of the act of successful appropriation"? "extralegal" in the sense of being historically prior to the law. 42. See McCormick, "Carl Schmitfs Europe." 43. We rely here on Weber's article ("Taking Exception"). Weber interprets brilliantly Walter Benjamin's literary critique of this Baroque genre as an expres sion of political philosophy, in the form of a philosophy of history. Works Cited Agamben, Giorgio.
