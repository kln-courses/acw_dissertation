<plain_text><page sequence="1">by L. Robert hind THE CRISIS IN LITERATURE III Literature and Social Consciousness ALL literature worthy of the name has social significance. It arises from a social milieu however restricted and adds its share of effort to the universal human endeavor to understand, interpret, and rationalize the complexities of life. It cannot be otherwise; no writer can escape the facts of social background and social consciousness under which life is lived everywhere. If it is historical fiction, for example, it usually has something to say in some fashion to, or of, the time in which it is produced, although the exiguity of this message can be measured by the alacrity with which the writers of historical text-books include such historical fiction in the stale wax-works of their bibliographies. Thus it follows that few writers of historical novels retain the hold upon the affections of a subsequent reading public that Scott, for instance, has held, even though his readers become increasingly confined to high school students who read him as a chore. Pure phantasy, or literature dealing in a fictional sense with the past or the future, has likewise very little social significance, for the simple reason that absolutely trustworthy recreations of the past or prophecies of the future are almost impossible and can only be tested by historical events, assuming that the phantasy pretends, as it seldom does, to deal with any phase of social signi ficance. What value it possesses (as, for example, Aldous Hux^ ley's Brave New World or H. G. Wells' Things to Come) lies in its indirect interpretation and criticism of the time and state of society from which it proceeds. It may be assumed with safety, therefore, that most modern</page><page sequence="2">346 by L. ROBERT LIND literature of any social importance or meaning is literature which deals with the present, and is concerned with problems that exer cise the contemporary form of society. As each great writer has been absorbed chiefly with the society of his own time in his works ?Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides with fifth century Athens, Dante with thirteenth century Italy, Shakespeare with sixteenth century England, and Goethe with nineteenth century Germany? so each writer gains importance in the inevitable arbitrary scale of literary greatness by the measure in. which he presents and re presents his own time. The Zeitgeist is no empty abstraction; it is practically identical with the destiny of those who are wise enough to recognize and exemplify it. There is an obvious and ideal fitness in this situation; for if Euripides had devoted his plays to a thorough archaicism, to a mere imitation however artistic of writers and ages long before his, or if, on the other hand, he had strained into the future with an un-Hellenic itch for prophecy, he would have little or no effect upon our literary sensibilities today. In proportion as a writer remains true to his age, at least to the extent of writing about it in some manner or other, he becomes interesting to following ages, whose curiosity remains constantly and precisely the curiosity to know what Euripides, let us say, thought of his own age. It may be added that the literature of a decadent age, although it may be of some interest as museum pieces, lacks this definite attraction for us, because, while unconsciously displaying to some extent the spirit of its age, it looks back self-consciously to the literature of a previous time, and, as in the gigantic show-piece of Greek literary decadence, the Dionysiaca of Nonnos, imitates it with a painful exactitude that tends to obscure what humble merits it has in itself. It is not their absence of skill that leaves us cold to the Dionysiaca or to the Sem?mes of Du Bartas; it is rather a facing backward and a neglect of contemporaneity that both violate our sense of their fitness in the social scheme and injure our sense of piety.1 In fact, imitation in the general, not Aristotelian, sense is always dangerous; it may result in a clever and brilliant tour de 1Cf. Permanence and Change (1935) Kenneth Burke, 95-118, on piety, under the heading, "Perspective by Incongruity".</page><page sequence="3">THE CRISIS IN LITERATURE 347 force which can enjoy a brief success; but, unless it can lift itself into the realm of literature Aristotle implies in his famous defin ition of tragedy, it remains a bit of lumber in the storehouse of writing. Its framework will not need to be one invented for its purpose; the Greek dramatists were content to convey their mes sage in the framework of old and well-worn myths, Shakespeare to take earlier tales and historical chronicles; what they ultimately say to their own times, and thus to ours, is the really significant part of their work. Shakespeare is, beyond doubt, the ideal example of a writer who has achieved a universality of appeal by his genius for transmut ing the most unlikely and intractable material into terms of its social significance. He has used almost all the types of literature, prose fiction in the prose passages, lyric and dramatic poetry (both monody and dialogue), touches of the epic in the historical plays, together with comedy, farce, tragic-comedy and lyric idyll, in the many-sided framework of his art. Shakespeare, like Holy Writ, can, of course, be taken to illustrate almost any point; but it will not be easy to deny that his art is intensely, almost exclusively, social in its function no matter what its structure happens to be. One might perceive in his mastery of metaphor alone a profound instinct for social communication in terms of the complete per sonality?emotion, reason, the subconscious, action, will, desire.2 The very incongruity of the metaphor in some of its uses betrays, from a modern psychological viewpoint,3 a supreme effort to achieve fresh perspectives, to set forth social relationships in new and unusual positions and thus to enhance their meaning and charm for an audience arrested primarily by their strangeness. Shelley's "violet in the crucible" is no more effective, as a meta phor, than dozens of those Shakespeare has made his own. To translate experience into terms of social universality by the employment of every technical device and artifice is not only Shakespeare's purpose but the purpose of any great writer down to James Joyce. Joyce has set himself a somewhat similar task in Ulysses; by proceeding from the sensational and bizarre in parti 2Cf. Shakespeare's Imagery, and What it Tells Us by Caroline F. E.

ROBERT LIND culars to a comprehensive trans valuation of values through a group of contrasted literary parodies and by the use of startling word-combinations, he seems to strive after Shakespeare's effect in a Bergsonian perspective by incongruity, an aim which falls short of universal appeal in Ulysses and especially his later work by its obscurity and technical subtlety. A versatility in the hand ling of many types of literature fused into one book is not always merely a legitimate sign of a work of decadent literature, as it may be regarded in the Dionysiaca of Nonnos; it is also, in a great artist, an indication of the attempt to clarify the social meaning of literature by providing the materials for comparison and judge ment within the covers of one book or in the wide sweep of a voluminous th??tre. This may be after all the goal of those who have practised a confusion of genres and thus incurred the wrath of Professor Bab bitt;4 one can be charitable enough to concede them some degree of conscious purpose along with the unconscious and apparently irrational confusion which characterizes their work. This purpose, let us hope, is social. Certainly the work of Joyce is the greatest single and consistent effort since Shakespeare and Balzac to pre sent in literature every conceivable phase of social consciousness (and unconsciousness) experienced by a set of characters, or one character, in a given social milieu within a given period of time. The symbols of Hamlet and Ulysses are, for these writers, only part of the necessary binding framework, and do not contain by any means the total burden of meaning they intend to convey. II It is necessary to define in some degree the term "social con sciousness" as it is used here before going further. To many minds it means something almost equivalent to moral reform, or a senti mental subjectivity turned toward the problems of society. Rous seau and the Romantic Movement, the propagandists of the French Revolution, the English humanitarian thinkers of the nine teenth century, and the apostolic succession of "social service" in the twentieth century have laid a heavy hand upon the phrase. 4The New Laokoon; an Essay on the Confusion of the Arts by Irving Babbitt; Houghton Mifflin, Boston (1910).</page><page sequence="5">THE CRISIS IN LITERATURE 349 Shelley, J. S. Mill, George Eliot, and, in our day, H. G. Wells and a large number of lesser writers are called up in the modern mind by these two words. Yet the humanitarian tradition is scarcely so malign an influence as it has been represented in recent critical literature; the essential elements of the Romantic-scientific Move ment are still the basis for the superstructure of thought which modern social theorists have reared upon it. In the meantime, modern social consciousness has become an attitude far more ironic and efficient, more realistic and discriminating than the social consciousness of such a thinker as Shelley, who was never properly cast, even from the point of view of Shelley enthusiasts, for the r?le he tried to play. To the modern intelligence "social consciousness", when shorn of the tawdry trappings of "service" and the pseudo-ethics of the business world, means, first of all, a grappling with the realities of modern society chiefly in its economic manifestations. Social con sciousness today first clearly discerns the enemies of social wel fare and then proceeds to a reasoned campaign against them. It implies a conflict with adversaries whose faces grow daily more recognizable. Social consciousness turns rapidly away from a merely theoretical conception of the good for mankind toward means and methods for achieving its ends; it is a rejection of the Platonic Absolute in favor of the Aristotelian experimentalism in the re-arrangement of human affairs. It is sceptical, even cynical, but usually, at its best, eminently practical, and far less idealistic and visionary than the defenders of the old order maintain. Modern science and education have set up for themselves ideals which, for the first time in history, promise actual fulfillment; their theories are conceived in terms of practicability and common sense. At least two social philosophies?socialism and commun ism?have embodied in their programs every factor in modern thought and social consciousness which could contribute to a realization of a world remolded to the mind's desires as well as to the heart's, and therefore are far more practical, intelligent, and constructive than the blundering vagueness of plan shown by democracy, monarchy, or fascism. To utilize all the best work of the modern mind, excluding private interest and prejudice, in 3</page><page sequence="6">350 by L. ROBERT LIND achieving a society heretofore envisioned only by the builders of Utopias has become the goal of the modern social consciousness. In literature, it is not difficult to point out on this basis the works which, in part or whole, share such ideals. While it is an error of futile judgment and of taste to quarrel with a writer's work because of his personal morals, it is entirely proper and neces sary to discuss his books in terms of the purpose he shows in them. The purpose I refer to is, at bottom, moral purpose, to which all other purposes, aesthetic, artistic, technical, must in the end con tribute in producing the total effect. The necessity for maintain ing consistency in moral purpose as it affects the novelist is ad mirably expressed by Mr. Herbert Read:5 Thought applied to character, which is its proper direction in the novel, resolves itself into something which had better be called moral. Such was the particular perception of Henry James, and this fact, more than anything else, endows him with qualities which give him the absolute dominance over all modern novelists. This moral perception is the animating energy of all his work, from its earliest full inception in Roderick Hudson, to its perfectly open expression in such obvious terms as Madame de Mauves, right unto its finest and subtlest and most significant statement in The Ambas sadors. In another passage Mr. Read turns toward the critic and his need for a similar consistency of purpose:8 The critic must aim to discover some utmost extent of mental territory to which the given expression of the author may be related. Equally, I think, the critic must reveal his own territory. He must contrive to show all the main facets? those which reflect most light in his life. For an opinion or judgment is never uttered except as the offspring of a total attitude. It issues from the inner centre which governs and coordinates every facet of the revolving spheroid. A liter ary judgment, though based on the closest scientific assess ment of the objective facts, is not genuine unless coloured by 6Reason and Romanticism; Faber and Gwyer (1926) 213-214; Henry James quoted (p. 219) : "There is one point at which the moral sense and the artistic sense lie very near together; that is in the light of the very obvious truth that the deepest quality of a work of art will always be the quality of the mind of the producer." *op. cit. pp. 2-3.</page><page sequence="7">THE CRISIS IN LITERATURE 351 the subjective intention of the originator. A view, not merely of literature, but of life is involved; not merely the science of writing, but also the philosophy of being. The selection of so dominant a figure as Henry James to supply the evidence for such a view is important. ,By almost universal consent he now appears as the greatest of modern novelists, and he could never be labelled a reformer, a visionary, or a wild theorist. As Mr. Read says, it is the lack of any moral pur pose similar to that of Henry James in the works of Joyce and Proust that renders their work so sterile, and thus gives the lie to critics who insist upon the superiority of other qualities in their novels as their chief claim to our attention. Social consciousness is, therefore, moral purpose conceived within the bounds of possibility and dictated by ?a necessity which Fascism swiftly makes more imperious and immediate. No degree of artistic or any other value can, in these times, outweigh the absence of such a social consciousness in literature addressed not merely to the emotions but the intelligence of the more serious reading public. The consumers of nine-tenths of current reading material will, of course, never rise to the level of social perception required of those who read (and often buy) the books of our best novelists; but even this latter group has sometimes betrayed its trust toward literature by succumbing to a surfeit of boredom, sophistication, and intolerable superficiality in its taste. For this there is no remedy, and it constitutes one of the great disappoint ments which literary craftsmanship entails. To seek a social consciousness understood in terms of moral purpose in most of the literature produced in the twentieth cen tury is to seek almost in vain. It will, of course, be stoutly main tained by many that moral purpose is not requisite to good writ ing; but it will be maintained at the risk of being called a devotee of "art for art's sake", or a defender of artistic creeds of a related nature. An appalling amount of critical acumen (and sometimes venom) has been employed in precisely such a campaign; many a well-established critic has gone off the deep end of prejudice in de crying moral purpose in a writer while at the same time introducing the confusing issues of personal morals and technical skill: the criticism of Shelley by Matthew Arnold and Paul Elmer More is</page><page sequence="8">352 by L. ROBERT LIND a classic example; the contemporary treatment of proletarian lit erature by Tory liberals among critics is quite as instructive an il lustration. On the whole, conservative critics have grown chary of thus exposing themselves to an enfilade of tart retort and have abandoned morals to entrench themselves in the safer recesses of technique. One can always be convincing when analyzing with cold hauteur the execrable prosody of the revolutionary poets; it is far more comfortable than to venture upon the uncertain ground of moral purpose or social philosophy. There is small cause for wonder that the most reactionary critics are also the most pious and pontifical judges and champions of form and technique: it is their last refuge against the growing demand for meaning and purpose in literature?unless, to be sure, they have sought other havens in the deep-breathing Y. M. C. A. school of criticism pre sided over by Professor "Billy" Phelps, or in the Twinkletoes Bed time department of literary enthusiasm supervised by the hopeless ly banal Mr. Alexander Woollcott. Ill Social consciousness in literature involves primarily the problems of communication, experience, social background, and observation. It entails, further, the questions of moral choice and literary pur pose. Other considerations of critical classification, selection of material, and the public for which certain books are intended like wise form part of the situation. Such problems require, indeed, a series of treatises; and it is not probable that the treatment given them here will be more than suggestive and cursory. The problem of communication alone gives every critic cause for considerable thought before he can proceed to other phases of his task. Both I. A. Richards and Max Eastman have been much exercised by the problem; Mr. Eastman, after making a stimulating study of "the cult of unintelligibility", leaves us almost as much in the dark about communication as ever. Mr. I. A. Richards has approached the subject in as scientific a manner as one has a right to wish for; and he has laid down what can be regarded as a definite challenge to all those writers who deliberately spurn the duty of communication heretofore considered so necessary that it has been merely taken for granted. Mr.</page><page sequence="9">THE CRISIS IN LITERATURE 353 Richards certainly has the unintelligibilists in mind when he writes : But more narrowly the reluctance of the artist to consider communication as one of his main aims, and his denial that he is at all influenced in his work by a desire to affect other people, is no evidence that communication is not actually his principal object. On a simple view of psychology, which overlooked unconscious motives, it would be, but not on any view of human behavior which is in the least adequate. When we find the artist constantly struggling towards impersonali ty, towards a structure for his work which excludes his pri vate, eccentric, momentary idiosyncracies, and using always as its basis those elements which are most uniform in their effects upon impulses; when we find private works of art, works which satisfy the artist, but are incomprehensible to everybody else, so rare, and the publicity of the work so con stantly and so intimately bound up with its appeal to the artist himself, it is difficult to believe that efficacy for com munication is not a main part of the 'rightness' which the artist may suppose to be something quite different.7 But over against such a view one must place the apocalyptic statements of those reluctant to communicate, from Archibald Mac Leish's "A poem should not mean: but be" to Mr. T. S. Eliot's somewhat mystical recipe for reading Dante and the metaphysical poets; one must contrast it with all the worst effects of Bergson ism upon modern criticism, with the recalcitrant obscurity of Ezra Pound and the doggedly determined nonsense of Gertrude Stein. Unless one is to throw overboard almost all the work of the unin telligibilists, one is forced into a vague and unsatisfactory com promise between their credo and the traditional view of com munication as a prime necessity in literary art. No critic has yet arisen to free us from such a dilemma; nor does it seem even re motely possible to explain the situation save upon the grounds that have been suggested, namely, that the art of poetry has been forced into the necessity of "difficulty" by the complexities of Principles of Literary Criticism (Fifth ed., 1934) 27-28. One should com pare also Chap. X, where Mr. Richards demolishes Bradley's theories of poetic, as distinct from other, experience, and Chap. XXI, where a theory o? com munication on a common fund of experience required for the understanding oi poetry is outlined.</page><page sequence="10">354 by L. ROBERT LIND modern civilization.8 Jtast precisely why this sort of literary homeopathy becomes necessary, when it is evident that clarity and simplicity are the obvious antidotes for pressing social complexities, is not made clear; it is presented without any compelling arguments and backed up merely with examples from the more "difficult" and esoteric of modern French poets. But it is apparent, nevertheless, that the sorry spectacle of "poets talking to themselves" bears some connection with the nature of contemporary society. Historical parallels, dangerous as they are for purposes of argument, may help us here: we may consider the fondness for the conceit and the elaborate metaphor among the Elizabethan dramatists. Here, as it seems, is a situa tion resembling that which can be discerned in much of the poetry of the present day. It appears as if the Elizabethans went out of their way deliberately in order to hamper their language with a good deal of labored obscurity; but the images and metaphors of Elizabethan drama were surely better chosen for the purpose of communication and were more easily grasped even by the ground lings than the metaphors and images in modern unintelligibilist poetry are understood among ourselves. It is, furthermore, not possible to demonstrate that the more notable Elizabethans sought exclusively the attention of a small clique, or retired frigidly into higher sanctums of poetic meaning, where no one without the edu cation of an Irving Babbitt plus the mental agility of Houdini could pursue them: which is, generally speaking, what the unin telligibilists have done. Moreover, the Elizabethans were using a language still in the flux of formation, and were tempted into obscurity by the very novelty and sound of words; they played with language as lustily as their mariners sported with the galleons of Spain, and explored the rich possibilities of their speech in the spirit of Drake and Hakluyt. Modern English, by comparison, is drab and staid; it has grown machine-tailored, colorless, and static in spite of the many developments of modern life which call whole vocabularies into existence almost overnight. It is against this standardization and debasement of the tongue that contemporary writers have re Selected Essays, T. S. Eliot, 1917-1932 (Harcourt Brace, New York, 1932) p. 248; compare Mr. Herbert Read's similar remarks in his Phases of English Poetry (The Hogarth Press, London, 1928) p. 151.</page><page sequence="11">THE CRISIS IN LITERATURE 355 belled, with not very happy results and with the logical necessity to which their creed must bring them: a speech so unlike its old form that only those in the know can understand it. It is more than doubtful whether this revolution in language has produced as great an effect upon literature as other movements in the social and economic sphere have produced. First the Im agists, then the unintelligibilists, labored to free literature from the effete word and phrase; but the vivid colorful language of the day is not to be found so clearly in their works?academics, exotics, and recluses as they are?as it is in the writings of those who have been inspired by forces less closely allied with technical innovation of an exclusively linguistic character. The significant literature is that which can be understood without a manual of ex egesis, without the aid of the handbooks of expository criticism which have grown up in the wake of The Waste Land, Ulysses, and Mr. Pound's Cantos. As readers, we still despise the footnote and the commentary; we are too busy to read five books in order to understand one, and that (with the exception of Ulysses) usually a very slender one. The Byzantine scholars produced such stuff; but the miracle of Homer exists in the fact that centuries of dull commentators have not been able to obscure his simplicity and direct appeal. The literary critics of the next few centuries will smile at the patient catalogue of allusions published in the appendix to The Waste Land', they will probably not even trouble them selves with the books which profess to explain Ulysses. The genesis of this situation in English poetry bears a close con nection with that rather absurd French controversy over "pure poetry" which raged in critical circles across the Channel not long ago and which owes its origin to Baudelaire, who coined the phrase. Mr. Herbert Read, upon whom I have already drawn so heavily, would doubt this;9 but it is surely apparent that the unin 9Phases of English Poetry (1928) p. 152. It is unfortunate that this brief and stimulating little collection of lectures should suffer from various contra dictions. Beginning with the interesting thesis that English poetry has evolved in a circle from the appeal to the widest possible public to an appeal to the poet alone, it ends with the suggestion, not far short of pathetic in its complete revelation of the extent to which poetry has lost its place in moderni culture, that poets must gather new life and continuation of influence from the subordina tion of all higher interests to the demands of the music hall, and thus return by a sordid back door to the folk-poetry of early England. Then too, having an nounced his belief and set it down as part of his thesis that English poetry in</page><page sequence="12">356 by L. ROBERT LIND telligibilists have, one and all, exhibited a deep preoccupation with the "purer" of the French poets, from Jules Laforgue to the highly touted and much-overrated St. Jean Perse, who is reported to have influenced Eliot (his translator) and MacLeish, among others. More significant still is the relationship between "pure poetry", with its numerous English proponents from Pater to George Moore, and Symbolism itself, the latter in its origin a flight from under standing and the need for communication through the intelligence. Furthermore, if one is to admit that literature is connected with its social background, as Mr. Eliot and Mr. Read both do, it re mains to point out the exact nature of this connection more fully than has yet been done, and, incidentally, to show just how their age produced the obscurities in the work of the metaphysical poets themselves. It cannot be asserted that their time was as complex as our own, nor that their kinship with the modern unintelligibilists is to be accounted for on the basis of similarity in social back ground. One is forced to believe that this relationship rests chiefly upon willful imitation of these earlier poets, and that personal choice and an arbitrary defense of that choice and imitation ac count for much of the obscurity in modern verse; the complexity of modern civilization is too flimsy an argument, when we see numerous poets using with excellent effect the simple idioms poetry has used so well ever since the time of Wordsworth. Robert Frost, for example, has never considered it necessary to make his poetry obscure in order to express the thoughts generated by the complex each of its historical phases can be related to a social background, Mr. Read pro ceeds to contradict and re-affirm this belief in the last lecture, on Modern Poetry, on successive pages (132^133), first declaring that "It is not, however, any part of my purpose to investigate the social foundations of literature, 'because I be lieve that in general it is a fallacious mode of approach for the literary critic/', and then turning upon this position with "I want now to suggest that we can gain some inkling of what is significant in modern poetry. . . by asking ourselves what form and type of literature might be expected to develop from the social conditions under which we live." His results are partly vitiated by such vacillation, and the opportunity for an excellent analysis of English poetry in terms of its social background left hanging in the air. He is right, of course, when he says (p. 141) of the poet "When, therefore, he is born into this apathe tic and hostile civilization, he will react in the only possible way. He will become the poet of his own spleen, the victim of his own frustrated sense of beauty, the prophet of despair.", but I take leave to doubt the universal validity of (p.154) "You must test the mqdern poet as you would test your friends: by faith and familiarity and a perfect knowledge." [italics mine].</page><page sequence="13">THE CRISIS IN LITERATURE 357 civilization in which he, as well as Mr. Eliot and Mr. Pound, is forced to find a place. The writer's individual experience, observation, and social back ground present themselves as reasonable points of approach to the understanding of modern literature. It is in the light of the person ality revealed, not in the special brand of language or technique employed, that a book can be most satisfactorily discussed and given its place in literary history. No writer escapes the facts of experience and environment; these, without resort to the absurd extremes of Hippolyte Taine, should help us to understand him. Those who have labored to conceal their meaning are the writers whose personal experience is most difficult to ascertain; but, pro ceeding on their belief that the writer should be as objective and impersonal as possible, it is not hard to see why this should be true. One may say, of course, that this personal experience has been so complicated, subtle, and intellectual that it can be ex pressed only in terms very difficult to understand; but, when we consider communication from the only sensible point of view as the first duty of the writer, it remains doubtful whether the at tempt to discover his meaning is, after all, worth the trouble it requires. Experience is the material with which the writer works; it is -possible to divide it into two types: (i) actual and (2) imagina tive experience, although this is an arbitrary distinction useful only for practical purposes and breaks down under close analysis. The first type might be illustrated in literature by a novel based on first-hand knowledge of a certain social scene and a group of characters who bear a close relation to actual people in that scene. The second type is illustrated by a re-creation of a social scene and characters which the author knows only through the medium of books, intensified by artistic imagination, as Thornton Wilder's The Bridge of San Luis Rey. There is no reason, of course, why imaginative experience should not produce an excellent work of art which may closely approx imate the realities of actual experience; much of the world's best literature has grown out of such imaginative experience. On the other hand, a work which is the result of actual experience may, through lack of skill, fail to achieve that naturalness and inevita</page><page sequence="14">358 by L. ROBERT LIND ble faithfulness to the facts of experience which are the tests of good writing. Yet of the two, the work based on actual experience, if done by a competent writer, has the greater chance of creating an impression of truth and reality; for the writer who has gone directly to the source of the greatest literature?life itself?is re strained far less by extraneous difficulties of distance from his subject in time and space, the distortions which imagination con tinually produces, and by the necessity of re-creating imaginative ly, to a larger extent, the very locale and people with whom his book is concerned. We are here face to face once more, however, with the fallacy of writing "true to life" Mr. Belgion has already discussed; and the difficulties it raises are very hard to dispose of. We can only fall back upon the elements of the picture presented in fiction by the writer: is it accurate as far as the author's knowledge goes, is it endowed with an essential spark of beauty or an authentic note of tragedy or the sense of fitness and inevitability which make the presentation more than mere realism? Each writer will, of course, give us the scene and its characters as he has seen them; his own social background and philosophy, his prejudices and partisanship will show through in spite of himself. The writer gives us the picture as accurately as he can, if he is sincerely devoted to truth ; but outside of that phase of his personality employed in the at tainment of accuracy lies an indeterminate area of the uncon scious and the instinctive (or intuitive) which will give rise to "ir responsible propaganda". He cannot escape the view of life his background, together with his education and reading, has given him. As John Chamberlain has written, "Art is propaganda for the artist's view of life". "Bourgeois" and "proletariat" are large vague terms which, when applied in the realm of literary criticism, have a number of defects. For one, it is hard to tell exactly where the bourgeois critic or author is divided from his proletariat counterpart except upon the basis of expressed doctrine. Socially, bourgeois and pro letariat tend to fuse together on that fringe of American life where the "self-made" man rises from one class to another, or where the once-prosperous member of the middle-class joins the breadlines of the depression. Classes are far less defined in the United</page><page sequence="15">THE CRISIS IN LITERATURE 359 States than they are abroad; this may be one reason why the use of the terms apart from their still somewhat incomplete acclimation in their original sphere of social and politico-economic life has been so perplexing. In general, however, it is clear that a proletariat writer is one who has expressed a definite view of sympathy with the worker's class in society and who has chosen to write about their life as being more interesting and important to himself, at least, than the life of other classes. Inconvenient and misleading as these terms are, they have been used frequently and without much careful defini tion in literary criticism of recent years and will remain until more expressive and accurate terms are found. In the course of their use, it is curious to observe how much more definitely outlined has become the position of the proletariat writer or critic; he, in con trast to the bourgeois, has a clearly marked position, his sympathies and purpose are more unmistakably set down. The bourgeois position, after centuries of existence, is still as vague and uncer tain in its principles as ever, perhaps because a dominant position has seemed to require no particular defense or definition. IV To return to the subject of social consciousness, it is apparent that neither group, bourgeois or proletariat, has a monopoly of preoccupation with society or its problems. An interest in the more parasitic phenomena of modern society, a more intense feeling of boredom and a consequently greater urge to write pri marily for the amusement of readers, may be said to characterize bourgeois literature, at least in those phases of it which have been surveyed in the first chapter. To conclude, on the other hand, that proletariat literature is, in contrast, more grim and serious is to give an inadequate estimate. It is true that the elements in human life which seem, at first, the principal ones with which the proletariat writer is concerned may suggest this conclusion; and it is also true that there is something oppressively earnest about, let us say, strikes, breadlines, and the massacring of picketers. But humor, the varied shades of human experience in its lighter aspects, the eternal m?lange of grotesque, ludicrous, noble, and</page><page sequence="16">360 by L. ROBERT LIND simple human actions are also a part of the picture the proletarian writer presents to his readers. Hostile critics have too often mistaken an interest in less privi leged classes of society as an abnormal tendency in the writer, as, indeed, it is from the thoroughly bourgeois point of view. Much of what was once and still is largely considered grotesquerie in Dickens, Zola, Dosto?evski must have seemed so to readers because these writers described a class of society traditionally regarded by the upper and middle classes with amused scorn or pity, much as Homer considered Thersites or eighteenth century English novel ists considered the entire servant, laboring, or farmer class. The condescension in Gray's famous elegy is not entirely concealed by the genuine human sympathy of its author. The humanitarian zeal of some nineteenth century British novelists is never far from a certain squeamishness; and even Ruskin can end an eloquent description of the glaring distinctions between poverty and wealth in his time with an irritatingly pious sermon on Christian ethics, as in the lecture on Work (to a laboring men's audience!) in The Crown of Wild Olive. Modern proletarian writing seeks to avoid this falseness of attitude; the realities of life among the working classes have no need of pious ethical embroidery. They are facts, first of all, not mere occasions for sentimentality. Proletarian or revolutionary literature is not, however, to be considered as a replacement but a complement of traditional or bourgeois literature; it does not and should not seek to set itself up as the ideal for literature, but adjusts the balance in its own favor so long weighted against it by writers too fearful, too closely bound by their class-backgrounds to give it more than a sentimental or scornful and totally inadequate place in the general body of creative and critical writing. The altogether justifiable resentment shown in proletarian literature toward the social and economic system which has so long denied it is expressed with an irony that rarely relapses into the sentimentality it despises and in whose mood the working masses have been thus far represented by middle-class writers and even by a few of those who formed part of the masses in a direct sense. By admission of its established critics and spokesmen,10 proletar "American Writers Congress (1935) pp. 56, 76, 90, 92, 100, 166.</page><page sequence="17">THE CRISIS IN LITERATURE 361 ian literature takes for its province not only the life and position of the workers in a capitalist society but the bourgeois element also, striving for a just and faithful interpretation of each within the limits of talent and individual conceptions of art tempered to a greater or less degree by a revolutionary world-view. By its very existence and phenomenal growth, proletarian literature repudiates on every ground the stubborn denial of its right to flourish by the critic who seeks the ultimate authority for his denial in the body of traditional literary aesthetics. A world incomplete without the working classes is obviously also incomplete without a litera ture and art devoted chiefly to an interpretation, whether in a revolutionary sense or not, of that class in its relations to other classes. Art is, finally, the only refuge of the recalcitrant critic; the assertion that proletarian literature tends to present only the most realistic, the least ideal and hence, to the critic whose background has kept him blind to anything more than his narrow views of art, the least satisfying elements in life, falls to the ground, upon closer examination. For, where mere snobbishness is not the motive, a trepidation and fear based on the instinct to protect the art thus far considered an exclusive part of the goods of the property-owning classes can be assigned. It is natural that the aesthetic ideology of the owning classes should tend to favor and sanction, in a quasi-religious and anthropomorphic fashion, the ideals in art of such classes, to which nobility of character, the standards of social conduct, the entire framework of society, have been represented, from Homer to Thornton Wilder, as created and maintained solely by the owners of property. If, then, proletarian literature strikes a discordant note in this ordered state of affairs, for which earlier ages did not hesitate to claim a divine sanction, it can be asserted on historical grounds that the bourgeoisie alone is to blame for thus attempting to bury its head in the sand and refusing to adjust a situation essentially, in all its aspects, so out of harmony with the principles of a uni versal and un-class-dictated art. Art does not, except when interpreted by a biassed mind, ex clude at all the themes and characters with which proletarian literature concerns itself. It is not the subject nor the phase of</page><page sequence="18">362 by L. ROBERT LIND society chosen that matters in the least; it is the skill in execution, the credibility generated, the essential faithfulness to reality in volved that matter. Baudelaire is no less an artist, and a great one, even from the bourgeois point of view (and among the bour geoisie, by the way, he has not ceased to find recommenders, inter preters, enthusiastic translators) because he deals exclusively (as proletarian writers emphatically do not) with the themes of de generacy, putrescence, decay; critics of whatever social philosophy have never really found fault with Balzac, Dostoievsky, or Zola solely on the basis of their choice of materials. Proletarian art thus stands vindicated even by the principles of criticism evolved before its day, and by a critical tradition it has had no part in forming. The conventional position of the puristic theoretician upon the aesthetic values of art, whether he be academic or escapist in principles, is one which cannot be maintained in the face of inevi table forces. In the end it is the sociological factor that decides the outcome of the conflict between the old and the new in artistic and literary antagonisms. The weight of numbers lies today with those who are, on the one hand, opposed to the lingering dogma tists of Romanticism and, on the other, to the desperate band who practice the "cult of unintelligibility". These minorities have, significantly, combined their strength in the last stand of Symbol ism and the literature of escape. Already art is displaying a sense of its social responsibilities quite different from that which drew enthusiastic masses to the support of Romanticism, when, in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, it offered those cut off from Classicism by lack of the proper social background and education an enrichment of emotional life through art in terms they could understand. The full sweep of the Romantic movement, gratefully accepted and earnestly followed by people released from ancient limitations with the growth of popular education, has run its course; the lure of the old appeal to the simple man and the simple (and sentimental) word is fast disappearing as the mani fold shams and weaknesses of democracy are laid bare and sup planted by the more frank and forceful, though essentially no less hypocritical, appeals of Fascist and authoritarian social systems. Propaganda and literature grow ever more and more insepara</page><page sequence="19">THE CRISIS IN LITERATURE 363 ble; doctrines and theories of literature, at least abroad, tend con stantly to coincide with the dictates of political power until it be comes impossible to make valid distinctions between them. The sharp struggle of the neo-humanists gathers pathos from the fact that, although they realized the falsehood of the statement "All men are created equal" and sought to illustrate the fallacy as it took shape in literature from Rousseau to H. G. Wells, they had nothing but an ancient and far less palatable authoritarianism to offer in its place. Whereas men have now come to see the cruel lie that has lain for a century and a half at the basis of democratic government, they will, nevertheless, reject the classical doctrine of inner-checks, especially when it is distorted by academics ; they are far from seeing more clearly when, though dubiously and with a feeling of dread compulsion, they accept the ringing slogans of a political, economic and spiritual r?gime that shows its power in Europe today. To maintain that art and social need have nothing in common, that the artist owes no allegiance to any force or judgement out side of himself; to say that his own interpretation of life and art is supreme, becomes, in the face of remorseless events and social movements almost beyond analysis, practically an absurdity. Social value has been, historically, the compelling determinative in literary work of a lasting nature; and though literature is the result of an intellectual creation without parallel except for the other arts in a world whose civilization revolves around industrial division of labor, it cannot indefinitely cling to what is, by analogy, a peasant economics. Art and literature arise from, are inseparably a part of, the social scheme; they do not exist in a vacuum peopled only by fancy and unreality. Although the purport of these re marks may seem extremely bizarre and forbidding, judged by the condition and the place of literature in previous social systems, it remains inevitable and true: literature cannot cease to move with the times which produce it or hesitate before the duties it has al ways rendered to society, upon whose movements it has, in spite of the arrogation of power and authority Max Eastman has ana</page><page sequence="20">364 by L. ROBERT LIND lyzed in The Literary Mind11, exerted only a moderate and never a supreme or absolute guidance. It is in the very nature of modern life to demand from literature a more substantial reason for its existence than it has heretofore condescended to give; and until men of letters everywhere unite in giving to society a clear and definite answer, it will be of no avail to theorize on the function of literature and to make endless distinctions of a Byzantine, logothetic sort concerning the author and his subject, objective value, integrity of motive and execution, and so on. A humility founded on knowledge, upon a realization of the position literature holds in the program of modern culture will constitute the beginning of its salvation; writers can learn, if they will?and in any event they will be forced to learn?that their place in society becomes far greater with the years than it has ever been since the age of Homer: they can become, if not the kings and prophets of the intellectual world as they have fancied themselves in the past, at least competent guides and advisers, clear-eyed leaders of the blind.
