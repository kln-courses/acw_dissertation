We subsequently carried out our own survey of the Ejutla Valley (1984-1985), which abuts the southern edge of the Valley of Oaxaca. The survey findings of pre-Hispanic shell working in the landlocked Ejutla Valley led us to excavate at the large Ejutla site for four field seasons, researching the domestic economy. The difficulty of finding pre-Hispanic houses in the alluvial terrain of the Ejutla site led us to start looking elsewhere to expand our sample of pre-Hispanic houses. The large terrace sites in the Tlacolula arm of the Valley of Oaxaca appeared to be a good place to look. Several large terrace sites that were mapped during the regional survey were very close to the edge of the surveyed region, so before beginning excavations at a new site, we decided to extend the surveyed area beyond the physio- graphic edge of the valley to provide a fuller context for those sites. So a decade after the Ejutla Valley survey, we began our investigation of the Guirún/Albarradas area. We began with the regional survey and then carried out intensive site surveys of three sites (Guirún, El Palmillo, and the Mitla Fortress) before excavating at two of those sites (El Palmillo and the Mitla Fortress). The survey of the Guirún/Albarradas area did provide a fuller context for sites in the easternmost part of the valley, but, more significantly, settlement patterns in the Albarradas area were not what we expected, especially early in the sequence. During the Late and Terminal Formative, there were denser popula- tions and larger sites on the eastern slopes of the mountains than inside the valley in eastern Tlacolula. We tried to explain this apparent enigma in several articles that presented our principal findings of the Guirún/Albarradas survey, but we did not get it quite right. Now, after much delay, we are publishing a final, more detailed monograph that incorporates new empirical findings and theoretical advances. Survey projects have been completed in many other large and small valleys in highland Mesoamerica, and the results of those investigations (though not always full coverage) help contextualize and situate our findings from the Guirún/Albarradas area in a much broader framework than was possible 20 years ago. Our efforts to understand the history of the Albarradas area also have been aided by subsequent excavations that we (and many others) have directed in the Central Valleys of Oaxaca and beyond. We gratefully acknowledge the critical support we received from the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, Inc.; the H. John Heinz Charitable Trust; the Wenner- Gren Foundation; and the University of Wisconsin Graduate School to implement the survey of the Guirún/Albarradas area. Subsequent analyses, including obsidian sourcing, were sup- ported by the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago and the Elemental Analysis Facility at the Field Museum, and we are grateful for their support. The permission and assistance of the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia and the Centro INAH Oaxaca are recognized with great appreciation. Norberto González Crespo, Eduardo López Calzada Dávila, and Nelly Robles García were particularly supportive. Nelly has always been a wonderful colleague and dear friend during the years we have studied Oaxaca's past. We are especially indebted to our mentors, Richard Blanton and Stephen Kowalewski, for both introducing us to Oaxaca and having the patience and confidence to train us. The regional surveys that they innovatively proposed and directed in the Valley of Oaxaca laid the essential groundwork for our expansion into the Albarradas area; settlement patterns in that area would have been impossible to interpret without the larger context provided by the prior systematic surveys in the Valley of Oaxaca. Rich and Steve have continued to be stimulating colleagues whose ideas and friendship are a constant inspira- tion. We also thank the members of our field crew, Andrew Balkansky, Laura Waterbury, Everardo Olivera (Lalo), and the late Fausto Olivera (Paco). Paco and Lalo, of Xaaga, Oaxaca, worked with us on many of our projects, and we will always remember their camaraderie and daily contributions with deep gratitude. We also thank Charles Spencer and the American Museum of Natural History for support to the senior author to study collections curated at the museum that were made by Marshall Saville at the Guirún site over a century ago. We are deeply grateful to Jill Seagard, scientific illustrator at the Field Museum of Natural History, who assisted us with the preparation of many of the graphics included in this work, and Fieldiana series editor H. Thorsten Lumbsch. P. Ryan Williams and Jonathan Hense provided essential help and guidance. We also thank two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments on an earlier draft of this monograph. Finally, we express our appreciation for the municipal authorities and people of San Lorenzo Albarradas and San Pablo Villa de Mitla who supported, tolerated, and provided us the permissions that we needed to implement this study.</page><page sequence="8">Chapter 1: Introduction and Background "When we step back to enlarge the field of vision, we do not retreat from phenomena but better perceive their significance." (Adams, 1977, p. 276) In this volume, we report on the pre-Hispanic settlement history of the eastern edge (the Guirún/Albar radas area) of the Valley of Oaxaca, Mexico. The regional-scale research that is our focus was conducted in 1995. In many respects, it is a spatial extension of the systematic archaeological survey project that we implemented in the 1970s and 1980s with Richard Blanton (Blanton et al., 1982) and Stephen Kowalewski (Kowalewski et al., 1989) in the Valley of Oaxaca, a sustained effort that continued under our direction in the neighboring Ejutla Valley (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013). Two decades now have passed since we led the field work in the Guirún/Albar radas area, although key empirical findings from this study were published earlier (Fein- man &amp; Nicholas, 1996, 1999). Nonetheless, the elapsed time has allowed us to take a fresh lens to the settlement data from the Guirún/Albarradas area in light of recent excavations in the Valley of Oaxaca (e.g., Feinman, 2007; Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2009; Faulseit, 2013), new sourcing studies of obsidian (Feinman et al., 2013; Golitko &amp; Feinman, 2015), pertinent theoretical tacks (e.g., Blanton &amp; Fargher, 2008; Blanton, 2016), and other relevant publications (e.g., Hutson, 2014). The more than four decades since the Valley of Oaxaca Settlement Pattern Project was initiated in 1971 with the mapping of the urban center of Monte Albán (Blanton, 1978) also mark an era of significant change in how archaeologists conceptualize the past and the ways in which they link data and concepts. Theoretical perspectives on themes fundamental to the analysis of pre-Hispanic Mesoamerica, including political organization (e.g., Blanton et al., 1996; Blanton &amp; Fargher, 2008; Blanton, 2016), economy (M. E. Smith, 2004; Feinman, 2017), boundaries (e.g., M. L. Smith, 2005, 2007, 2012), interregional interaction (e.g., Rice, 1998; Hirth &amp; Pillsbury, 2013; Golitko &amp; Feinman, 2015; Feinman, in press), and identity (e.g., Jones, 1997), either have evolved considerably or are under intense debate. Thus, in discussing the Guirún/ Albarradas area and the shifting interconnections of the people who lived there with the inhabitants of other sectors of the Central Valleys of Oaxaca and beyond, we would be remiss if we did not seriously mull and reconsider long-standing questions about the history of the entire region in the context of both these new findings and changing perspectives. Since inception, a long-standing theme of the settlement pattern studies in the Valley of Oaxaca has been to address the nature of (and shifts in) the relationship between the broad center of the Valley of Oaxaca, the surrounding system of smaller valleys, and the mountainous regions that ring the valleys. The Guirún/Albarradas area, both distant from the center of the valley and more mountainous, provides an arena to assess these changing relations from a new physiographic vantage. Today, the Guirún/Albarradas area lies close to an ethnic frontier between the Zapotee peoples, who long have lived in the Valley of Oaxaca and its immediate surrounds, and Mixe-speaking peoples who live in the mountainous region to the east. Here, we examine' the history of settlement at the eastern edge of the valley system with issues of boundaries, frontiers, and political relations at the forefront. We addressed frontier and boundary issues in a recent volume (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013; see also Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 1992) that looked at the settlement history of the Ejutla Valley in the context of the larger Valley of Oaxaca to the north (Fig. 1.1). The Valley of Oaxaca is the largest expanse of flat land in Mexico's Southern Highlands and has long been recognized as a core region of pre-Hispanic importance (Palerm &amp; Wolf, 1957). Monte Albán, founded circa 500 BC at the nexus of the valley's three branches, was one of highland Mesoamerica's earliest cities, and it remained the most populous and architecturally monumental settlement in the Southern Highlands for more than a millennium (Blanton, 1978). Its depopulation and loss of political centrality ramified across the Southern Highlands of Mesoamerica. Nevertheless, up to the Spanish Conquest, the Valley of Oaxaca remained a locus of political, demographic, and economic power in Mesoamerica. The Ejutla Valley, situated at the southern edge of the Valley of Oaxaca, is not separated from its neighbor by a stark physiographic feature. In this sense, it differs from the Guirún/ Albarradas area, which is divided from its larger neighbor by tall, rugged mountains. In this study, we examine and compare these two distinct edges of the Valley of Oaxaca to see how the settlement histories of these regions were similar and different as demographic, political, and economic shifts occurred in the larger valley system of which they were part as well as across Mesoamerica. The inhabitants of the Valley of Oaxaca always had connections with areas far beyond its physiographic borders (e.g., Flannery, 1968; Blanton et al., 1999, pp. 20, 36), but as the results of our investigation of the Ejutla Valley illustrated, the importance of specific travel routes and the nature of interaction were not static over time. As populations rose and fell, economies varied, and the nature of political relations changed (in Oaxaca and throughout Mesoamerica), the flows of goods and information shifted in volume and occurred through different kinds of social networks (e.g., Blanton et al., 2005). Over the past century, the Guirún/Albarradas area has had a key role in these long-distance connections and movements of goods (Schmieder, 1930, p. 34; E. C. Parsons, 1936; Beals, 1979). What is the deep history of the trade connections that in recent times extended east from the Valley of Oaxaca? Frontiers, Boundaries, and Interaction The introduction of regional survey to the archaeological tool kit brought boundaries and frontiers into greater discourse in archaeology in the 1980s (e.g., De Atley &amp; Findlow, 1984; Green &amp; Perlman, 1985). Whether based on physiographic or arbitrary features due to limits of time and funding, regional surveys produce settlement pattern maps with defined borders, but not necessarily ones that coincide with any meaningful past FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY N.S., NO. 46, NOVEMBER 13, 2017, PP. 1-6 1</page><page sequence="9">political or cultural boundaries. Many regional surveys begin around major ancient capital cities and map settlement patterns in their immediate hinterlands (e.g., Balkansky, 2006). Such was the history of archaeological settlement pattern research in highland Oaxaca. Relatively few archaeological survey regions are large enough on their own to encompass more than one polity, let alone the entire extent of that polity, so that the boundaries between polities could be defined. The examination of the borders and boundaries of ancient polities requires large- scale perspectives that go beyond individual regions (Marcus, 1992a; Kowalewski, 2004). Our surveys of both the Ejutla Valley and the Albarradas area are only two of various efforts (Drennan, 1989; Kowalewski, 1991; Balkansky, 2002) to expand the systematically surveyed area in the Southern Highlands beyond the physiographic edges of the Valley of Oaxaca. One impediment to examining boundaries is the legacy of culture history. This frame, whose logic is embedded in most subsequent conceptual approaches, has often relied on test pits and deep trenches or "telephone booths" (Flannery, 1976) to define settlements and "type sites." These archetypical units were then used to represent entire "cultural areas" that do not adequately represent variation within regions. In this approach, scale and intraregional variation did not receive adequate attention (see Adams, 1977; Feinman, 1994). "Culture areas haunt our research," affecting how we have framed questions and defined boundaries (McGuire, 2002, p. 174). The idea of firm boundaries in the ancient past is a relic of this earlier culture-area thinking when individual polities were viewed as closed, self-contained systems, like billiard balls (e.g., Sanders &amp; Price, 1968; sensu Wolf, 1982, pp. 6-7). Conceptions of modern political boundaries, with concrete and clear territorial limits, also are generally not relevant for the past (Stoddart, 2010, p. 40). Political regions are not natural, and their boundaries do not always, or even rarely, conform to geographic or topographical features. Rather, they are relational, based on social connections and networks, and so continually reconfig- ured (Cartier, 2002, p. 106; Knappett, 2013). More recent perspectives see past political and even cultural boundaries as fluid, permeable, and overlapping (e.g., Feinman, 1998; Berdan, 2003a; Kowalewski, 2004; M. L. Smith, 2005, 2007, 2012; Stoddart, 2010). There are many different kinds of boundaries - geographic, political, economic, demographic, cultural - that vary over space and that do not always, or even usually, align with one another (Elton, 1996, pp. 3-9; Parker, 2006, p. 80). The nature of political boundaries, for example, can vary for a variety of reasons, including administrative strategies that are based on key features of the landscape, such as proximity to major trade routes, instead of direct contributions from local production (Trinkhaus, 1984, pp. 37-38). Nor do cultural customs and practices stop and change at physiographic or political boundaries; cultural usage is not uniformly defined by natural features or physiographic barrierś and so can shift over time. "Human geographers have long recognized that interactive or nodal regions often do not strictly conform to formal topographic or landscape features" (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, p. 1), and we should not assume that patterns of human behavior always have been tightly constrained by formal geographic regions (sensu Haggett, 1966, pp. 242-247). In addition, the limits of political units are not always coterminous with economic and cultural networks (e.g., Blanton &amp; Feinman, 1984; M. L. Smith, 2012). Rarely are hierarchically organized polities bounded in hermetic fashion, and the nature of their territorial control is rarely uniform across time and space (e.g., Wolf, 1982, pp. 6, 7, 17; Feinman, 1994, 1998; M. L. Smith, 2005, 2007). Social boundaries based on ethnicity also do not always map easily and conveniently onto ancient political or cultural boundaries (e.g., Emberling, 1997). Ethnic boundaries are not primordial or static (Fang et al., 2015), and many early polities or archaeological regions were multiethnic (e.g., Blanton, 2015). In fact, we can even ask if social boundaries can be identified in the archaeological record (Stark, 1998, p. 8), given that they "are abstractions and ideological constructs, recognized differ- ently ... by people on the basis of their perceived identity" (Goodby, 1998, p. 161). Fredrick Barth (1969, p. 10) defined ethnic groups as "categories of ascription and identification by the actors themselves." Ethnicity is something people do (Hegmon, 1998, p. 272), based on differences they regard as significant (Barth, 1969, p. 14). Ethnicity is not unchanging or always expressed in similar ways (e.g., Blanton, 2015). The increased attention on boundaries heightened our interest in the concept of the scale of social relations and the multiple levels at which our social and economic networks function and change in relation to each other (Feinman, 1986a, p. 51). People participate in "webs of social relationships" that have a history (McGuire, 2002, pp. 181-182); they tend to belong to multiple, overlapping social and cultural networks; their membership in these networks is situational; and they may change their affiliation at any time (Schortman &amp; Urban, 2012, p. 477). Boundaries vary in their degree of permeability (Kowalewski et al., 1983; Berdan, 2003a; Kowalewski, 2004), affected by the nature of those interactions, networks, and spatial relations that cross the boundaries. The pre-Hispanic Mesoamerican world was generally characterized not by impermeable boundaries or closed systems but by extensive socioeconomic networks that were not static or tightly bounded (Feinman, 2018, in press). Because social networks so often cut across political, cultural, geographic, and other boundaries, sharp borders between relatively homogeneous groups are rare in archaeological contexts (Lightfoot &amp; Martinez, 1995, pp. 487-488; see also McGuire, 2002, p. 182). Scale is important here in that what appears as a boundary at a macroscale may disappear as we focus down on lower scales of analysis (McGuire, 2002, p. 182). The definition of where these ancient boundaries are on the landscape is not an easy task, nor should that be our end goal. We can even ask if all, or even most, past polities had firm territorial boundaries. Drawing from place-names and their contexts in Maya inscriptions, Tokovinine (2013, p. 123) argues that the extent of Classic period Maya polities was based on personal networks between elites and commoners rather than solely on features of the geographic landscape. Boundaries and frontiers are often discussed together, but they are not one and the same (Prescott, 1965, p. 30; Rodseth &amp; Parker, 2005, p. 10; Parker, 2006, p. 81; Hall, 2009, p. 25). The concept of frontiers came into archaeology as part of the discourse on core-periphery relationships (Lightfoot &amp; Marti- nez, 1995, pp. 472-473) that was heavily influenced by Wallerstein's (1974) world-systems theory. In a basic sense, cores represent places of concentrated economic and political power as well as dense populations. Distance from core regions, 2 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="10">Fig. 1.1. Valley of Oaxaea survey regions and principal places mentioned in the text. in addition to physiographic features that divide regions, is part of how we have defined marginal or frontier areas. But not all frontiers are zones of transition between core areas; frontiers also separate core regions from more distant sparsely settled areas (Rodseth &amp; Parker, 2005, p. 10). The examination of broad-scale areas provides necessary context for widening our understanding of the nature of past frontiers and how they shifted and changed over time. FEINMAN AND NICHOLAS: SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN ALBARRADAS, OAXACA, MEXICO 3</page><page sequence="11">In early core-periphery studies, frontiers were seen as the "passive recipients" of innovations that occurred in core areas or as semipermeable cultural barriers that could impede interaction (Lightfoot &amp; Martinez, 1995, pp. 471, 473). More recently, frontiers have come to be seen as porous and fluid zones of transition and interaction that comprise a complicated mosaic of overlapping boundaries and cross-cutting social networks (Lightfoot &amp; Martinez, 1995, p. 472; Elton, 1996, pp. 3-9; Parker, 2006, pp. 80-81; Schon &amp; Galaty, 2006, p. 232). Interactions in frontier zones occur between diverse groups that are not necessarily equivalent in power, status, or degree of autonomy (Trinkaus, 1984, p. 46; Lightfoot &amp; Martinez, 1995, p. 473). Because of the mosaic of overlapping boundaries, the multiplicity of interactions that occur in frontier areas, and differences between cores, outlying areas are not all the same, and changes occur in them over time. Frontiers are shaped by the intensity of the relations and the nature of the networks that link them with neighboring groups (McNeill, 1998, p. 221; Hall, 2009, p. 39; Terrell, 2010; see also Schortman &amp; Urban, 1992). No two frontiers have the same neighbors or intensity of interaction. The processes of contact and interaction also are not unidirectional, with innovations limited to core regions (Lightfoot &amp; Martinez, 1995, p. 487); influence and new cultural conventions can be transmitted in either direction (Lightfoot &amp; Martinez, 1995, p. 487; Schon &amp; Galaty, 2006, p. 232; Hall, 2009, p. 39). This dynamism can make frontiers "socially charged places" (Lightfoot &amp; Martinez, 1995, p. 472) and "unstable zones that exhibit a marked degree of variability through space and time" (Parker, 2006, p. 77). Shifts in boundary relations are a central theme in this work, as our empirical focus is on the eastern physiographic edge of the Valley of Oaxaca. Years back, we and colleagues (Blanton et al., 1982, 1993) defined boundary relations as one of the key dimensions (along with scale, complexity, and integration) that requires attention and consideration when we compare human cooperative networks, political formations, and economic linkages across time and space. Through the focus on these dimensions rather than societal taxonomies or presumed trajectories of change, we have been able to describe, analyze, and compare changes over time while recognizing that human history follows different, alternative pathways and that such time/spatial variation is a key element of what we, as archaeologists, should endeavor to understand (e.g., Feinman, 2012a; M. E. Smith et al., 2012). At the same time, there are important processes and mechanisms that were at work across historical contexts (e.g., Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2016a). Here, we examine a range of manifestations of scale, such as estimates of population sizes for various spatial units and sites (for a fuller discussion, see Blanton et al., 1993, pp. 13-19). We also consider the scale of monumental architecture at specific localities over time (e.g., Blanton, 1989; Abrams, 1994). Nested spatial scales are, of course, a central element for this investigation and discussion. Complexity, which may be vertical or horizontal in nature, is referenced in regard to the vertical levels or tiers in settlement distributions. We also examine the horizontal components, such as terraces, that make up certain settlements. The competitive or allied political factions, which may or may not share comity and power, are another way that we consider the dimension of complexity. Integration refers to the relations and connections between units, whether individ- uals, households, or larger social formations. It should be clear that we do not wish to imply that any human group or grouping is seamlessly integrated, but the ties and networks that bind and affiliate are a key element of being human, and the strength and nature of these associations are highly variable. In this volume, we are especially concerned with how urban Monte Albán interacted and was interconnected with its hinterland at ever more distant spatial scales as well as how these relations and spatial configurations changed over time. The dynamic of leader-follower relations and how they shift temporally is another focal point of this analysis. By definition, all leadership is relational (Ahlquist &amp; Levi, 2010). The different ways that leaders have to gain and hold power and the nature of the resources available to them to fund their activities/ governance affect the dynamics of ancient polities (e.g., Blanton &amp; Fargher, 2008; Blanton, 2016). Recent scholarship has advanced a continuum of relations, ranging from collective or more representative, where power is shared and divested in different societal segments, to more exclusionary or autocratic, where the principals are more self-aggrandizing and often operate through networks of personal/family ties (Feinman, 1995, 2001a, 2012b; Blanton et al., 1996; Blanton, 1998, 2016; Carballo, 2016). These leadership modes are not static and may change in a given setting over time. They also tend to be tied to differences in a range of other variables, including the accumulation of goods and the nature of public architecture (e.g., Feinman, 2001a, p. 160; Blanton &amp; Fargher, 2011; Carballo, 2016, p. 120). An important variable is how the polities are funded (Levi, 1988), with different leadership arrangements underpinned by different sources of revenue (D'Altroy &amp; Earle, 1985; Blanton &amp; Fargher, 2008; Blanton, 2016). Exclusionary polities are more likely to derive their funds from external resources, such as control of spot resources, control of trade routes, or war booty, whereas more collective polities depend on internal resources, such as agricultural surplus from the local populace (Blanton &amp; Fargher, 2008; Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2016a, pp. 283-284, 2016b, pp. 47^48). In specific political contexts, the way that power is funded has clear implications for how relations are forged between central states and cities and their near and far hinterlands. Our aim here is to examine shifting networks of settlement and interaction between the populations in the Southern Highlands over the pre-Hispanic era. We focus on the relations between the urban capital in the center of the Valley of Oaxaca and the smaller valleys on its borders as the nature of political organization, leadership, and the resources that funded power changed over time. How did the nature and intensity of interactions shift over space when Monte Alban was founded and increased in size and monumentality during the Formative period? What were the differences as Monte Albán began a slow decline during the Late Classic and in the politically decentral- ized but economically commercialized Late Postclassic? How were outlying areas like Albarradas affected (if at all) by these changes in the scale and nature of political organization at the heart of the valley system? At the same time, our other important charge is to report the information that we recovered and mapped at sites in the Guirún/Albarradas area, as, realistically albeit sadly, many of these archaeological localities will never be studied or recorded in greater detail. If the descriptions offered sometimes seem dry or overly detailed in spots, consider that we often provide as much information as we collected on specific settlements, as these written accounts 4 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="12">and the materials collected may be the only enduring record that the past inhabitants of those sites left on the planet. With these aims and new perspectives in mind, we stress that by focusing on a larger spatial landscape than just Guirún/ Albarradas, we have recognized new patterns and relations in these broad-scale data. In a few cases, our opinions have changed from our early interpretations of the Guirún/Albarra- das area. More frequently, we have reframed or slightly tinkered with or enhanced early views, even those expressed in our own recent monograph (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013). By employing a conceptual lens that examines relationships between political leadership and followers, how governance is implemented, and the ways that it is funded (e.g., Levi, 1988; Blanton &amp; Fargher, 2008; Blanton, 2016), we have been able to reconsider prior small enigmas in settlement pattern changes that occurred in pre-Hispanic Oaxaca. Our attention is more focused not just on the links between spatial sectors of this valley system but also on the kinds of flows that may have linked them. We reevaluate why population was so densely settled around Monte Alban in Monte Albán Late I and IIIB- IV but not in Monte Albán II and why settlements east of the mountains that define the physiographic edge of the Valley of Oaxaca in Monte Albán V were situated to exploit agrarian resources and produce a large potential surplus when earlier settlement distributions in the area were not situated to do so. We also add a few new bits of evidence and interpretive wrinkles to our earlier effort to understand the long Classic- Postclassic transition in the Valley of Oaxaca that was embedded in our prior monograph (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, pp. 141-156). With new vantages and data, we offer newly expanded and, it is hoped, enhanced perspectives relevant to these issues and others, and for that reason we often devote as much or more consideration to larger spatial domains and do not limit our spatial frame to the Guirún/ Albarradas region itself. Of course, understanding the Guirún/ Albarradas area would be difficult without that broader context. Organization of This Volume To address the theoretical and empirical goals outlined above, the rest of this volume is organized into an additional chapter of historical and contextual background, five sections that outline the settlement patterns in the Guirún/ Albarradas region (and neighboring areas) over time, and a synthetic summation. Each of the five chapters that present the settlement data begins with an opening section that lays out what we think was happening at broader scales in highland Oaxaca and beyond before presenting more detailed information on Albarradas and its relationships to its larger neighbor. These sections of the volume follow Chapter 2, where we discuss the history of systematic regional settlement survey in Mesoamerica and Oaxaca as well as what we knew about this part of the Valley of Oaxaca before we implemented the survey. We focus in Chapter 3 on the Middle and Late Formative (Rosario phase and Monte Albán I), when the earliest settlements were established in the Guirún/ Albarradas area. First San José Mogote and then Monte Albán were the principal centers in the Valley of Oaxaca at that time (Table 1.1). We did not find any Early Formative sites in the Albarradas area. The population remained very low until Table 1.1. Chronological sequence for the Valley of Oaxaca and Mesoamerica. Oaxaca Mesoamerica 1500 Late Postclassic 1300 Monte Albán V 1100 Early Postclassic 900 Monte Albán IV 700 Late Classic Monte Albán HIB 500 Monte Albán IIIA Early Classic 300 AD 100 Monte Albán II Terminal Formative 100 BC Monte Albán Late I 300 Late Formative Monte Albán Early I 500 Rosario 700 Middle Formative Guadalupe 900 San José 1100 Early Formative 1300 Tierras Largas 1500 Monte Albán Late I, when a series of small terrace sites were established at the eastern edge of the Albarradas area on the western side of the Hormiga Colorada River. The ceramic artifacts and the nature of the settlement plan and architecture at these sites are very similar to contemporaneous sites in the Valley of Oaxaca. The defensive character of the larger Late I sites in Albarradas is an indication of potential skirmishes and hostilities with neighboring populations, perhaps Mixe peoples to the east, than the presence of a tightly controlled political border. In Chapter 4, we discuss the Terminal Formative (Monte Alban II) settlements. Populations declined throughout most of the Valley of Oaxaca and neighboring regions between Monte Alban Late I and II as Monte Albán extended its extraregional influence. In contrast, populations rose slightly in eastern Tlacolula and neighboring Albarradas. In Chapter 5, we present our findings for the Early Classic (Monte Alban IIIA), a time of high population growth across highland Mesoamerica, including the Valley of Oaxaca. Teotihuacan was the largest political center in the Mesoamer- ican macroregion and extended degrees of influence and interaction beyond central Mexico during this period. In the Valley of Oaxaca, although Monte Albán grew in size and architectural monumentality, it seems to have lost influence in more distant areas and refocused on the valley. Much of the Albarradas area was depopulated at the same time that the Guirún site on the western side of the mountains in eastern Tlacolula grew substantially. We suspect that people moving from the Albarradas area contributed to Guirún's growth. Most of the remaining population in the Albarradas area was FEINMAN AND NICHOLAS: SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN ALBARRADAS, OAXACA, MEXICO 5</page><page sequence="13">defensively concentrated in Llego Yiachi at the eastern edge of the surveyed area. We examine in Chapter 6 the Late Classic (Monte Albán IIIB-IV), when Monte Albán reached its peak dominance and then began its slow decline. Population declined throughout the valley and most of the surrounding regions during this era of political reorganization. At the same time, new powerful centers arose in the Valle Grande and in Tlacolula. The only subregion of the valley that experienced significant population growth was eastern Tlacolula; the population rebound was even greater in Albarradas. Because of long-standing problems with the IIIB-IV ceramic chronology of the Valley of Oaxaca during Monte Albán's peak and eventual decline (see Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, chapter 9), it has been difficult to elucidate the full suite and contempo- raneity of changes across the Valley of Oaxaca during this significant era of transition. Incorporating findings from subsequent excavations at Classic/Early Postclassic sites in the valley and readings of ethnohistorical records, we have reexamined settlement data from our regional survey projects in and around the Valley of Oaxaca and offered a refined scenario for the population shifts that occurred between the Early Classic and Late Postclassic (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 201 la, 2013, 2016b). This scenario largely adheres to the overall findings of the original survey data at the same time that it provides a settlement history more consistent with excavation and ethnohistoric findings for the region. Based on the adjusted demographic profiles, population decline at the end of the Classic period appears to have been more gradual and prolonged than in other interpretations, and significant demographic growth did not occur across the Valley of Oaxaca until the latter half of the Postclassic period. In Chapter 7, we focus on the Postclassic (Monte Albán V), an era of political and demographic decentralization, expanding networks, and increasing commercialization in highland Oaxa- ca and beyond. Following political reorganization at the end of the Classic period, population continued to fall in the northern and western sectors of the Valley of Oaxaca during the early Postclassic. Renewed growth began earlier in the peripheral parts of the valley - Tlacolula and Ejutla - that were the first to pull away from Monte Albán's hegemony during the later Classic. Although population expanded everywhere across the region by the end of the Postclassic, Tlacolula, especially eastern Tlacolula, continued to be the demographic center of the valley. Settlements extended across the mountain ridges into Albarradas, which had higher population densities than any other edge area. Albarradas also was more densely settled than several subareas of the Valley of Oaxaca. In Chapter 8, we return to themes and questions concerning boundaries and frontiers (with a focus on the Valley of Oaxaca) that we outlined above. The expansion of the systematic archaeological survey into the Albarradas area provides us the opportunity to present new corroborative evidence and interpretive perspectives on the settlement and population changes documented for eastern Tlacolula through prior survey research (Kowalewski et al., 1989). We also gather new strands of evidence that are marshaled to define routes of interaction and exchange that passed through the Albarradas area into the Valley of Oaxaca and that may have been a factor in Tlacolula's demographic and political emergence following the decline of Monte Albán. The specific networks of interaction vary for different edges of the Valley of Oaxaca and offer one potential factor relevant to the distinct demographic histories that we document for the different edges of this region. The Albarradas area was not large nor was it easy to survey systematically due to the rugged landscape. Yet in the context of the large contiguous study area that was surveyed previously, it has been a source both for new empirical findings as well as for provocative new perspectives that have yielded fresh ways to reconsider and interpret elements of the settlement history of the larger landscape of which it is part. 6 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="14">Chapter 2: Archaeological Survey and the Guírún/Âlbarradas Region "In multiple ways, since its beginnings some 40 years ago, regional archaeological research based on full- coverage survey has transcended its original goals to find relevance in relation {o research problems not anticipated by its founders." (Blanton, 2005, pp. 295-296) Background to Valley of Oaxaca and Prior Surveys Since the implementation of Gordon Willey's (1953) regional settlement pattern study of the Virú Valley in Peru in the late 1940s, systematic archaeological surveys have been conducted in many regions across the globe (e.g., Kowalewski, 2008; Fang et al., 2012). Now, after more than half a century, dozens of systematic regional research projects have been completed across the Central and Southern Highlands of Mesoamerica (Nichols, 1996, table 1; C. A. Smith, 2002, table 4-4; Balkansky, 2006; Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, pp. 25-26, figure 3.1). Since their inception, these full-coverage, regional surveys have been among the most important sources of new archaeological knowledge, not only about pre-Hispanic Mesoamerica (Blan- ton, 2005, p. 295) but also for areas across the globe (Sabloff &amp; Ashmore, 2001, p. 14; Cherry, 2003; Renfrew, 2003, p. 313). The first systematic regional surveys in Mesoamerica were conducted in the Basin of Mexico in the 1960s (Sanders, 1965; J. R. Parsons, 1971; Blanton, 1972; Sanders et al., 1979; J. R. Parsons et al., 1982, 1983). The following decade saw the implementation of systematic archaeological survey in the Valley of Oaxaca, beginning with Monte Alban in 1971 (Blanton, 1978) and then in all arms of this large Y-shaped valley (Varner, 1974; Kowalewski, 1976; Blanton et al., 1982; Kowalewski et al., 1989). At the same time, a partial survey of the Miahuatlán Valley (Markman, 1981) south of Ejutla was completed, but without using the same full-coverage method- ology. We extended the regional survey from the southern edge of the Valley of Oaxaca into the Ejutla Valley in the mid-1980s (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 1990, 2013). A decade later, we surveyed the Guirún/Albarradas area at the eastern edge of the Valley of Oaxaca (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 1996, 1999). At the same time, other investigators carried out regional surveys in areas that abut the Valley of Oaxaca: the Sierra Norte to the north (Drennan, 1989), the Peñoles area of the Mixtee Sierra to the west (Kowalewski, 1991; Finsten, 1996), and the Sola Valley to the southwest (Balkansky, 1997, 2002) (Fig. 2.1). Regional surveys in many of the valleys of the Mixteca Alta northwest of the Valley of Oaxaca (Spores, 1972; Byland, 1980; Plunket, 1983; Byland &amp; Pohl, 1990; Balkansky, 1998a; Balkansky et al., 2000; Stiver, 2001; Kowalewski et al., 2009, 2010) have expanded the total area surveyed in highland Oaxaca to more than 9,000 km2, the largest contiguous area surveyed anywhere in the world. The regional survey of the Guirún/Albarradas area was completed during six weeks in July and August 1995, covering an area of 110.8 km2. The area walked over extends the Fig. 2.1. Surveyed areas in highland Oaxaca and places mentioned in text. FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY N.S., NO. 46, NOVEMBER 13, 2017, PP. 7-26 7</page><page sequence="15">Fig. 2.2.

This area includes the foothills and lower slopes of the high mountain ridges that define the eastern physiographic edge of the large, highland Valley of Oaxaca (Fig. 2.3). The Guirun/Albarradas survey region crosses the mountain ridge and includes terrain belonging primarily to San Pablo Villa de Mitla (west of the ridge) and San Lorenzo Albarradas (east of the ridge). Small areas of land in the southern part of the study area belong to Santiago Matatlán and San Baltazar Guelavila. The previously reported Guirún site, known largely for a partially exposed carved stone cruciform tomb and standing adobe walls (Sa ville, 1900, 1909; E. C. Parsons, 1936, plate LI, bottom; Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2004a), is located at the edge of the 1980 survey boundary on the western slopes of Cerro Guirone. At that time, when the regional survey was implemented, the crew suspected that the site might extend farther up the slopes of Cerro Guirone, but time did not permit an upslope expansion of the survey zone. We picked up the Guirún/Albarradas survey at the 1980 boundary, covering the highest mountain peaks and the slopes descending on the east to the Hormiga Colorada and the Salado tributary of the Rio Grande/Tehuantepec River. Between 1996 and 1998, we completed intensive surface surveys of three sites in eastern Tlacolula - the Guirún site, El Palmillo, and the Mitla Fortress (see Fig. 1.1; Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2004a). These • studies provided more detailed information for the three sites than was possible to obtain during the regional survey alone (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2004a). During our intensive survey of the Guirún site, we found it was larger and more populous than reported in the original survey volume (Kowalewski et al., 1989) or in our first reporting of the results of the regional survey of the Guirún area (Feinman &amp; 8 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="16">Fig. 2.3.

The Guirún/Albarradas Survey Region The Guirún/Albarradas survey region is a rugged, topo- graphically diverse area that includes the high mountain peaks that define the eastern edge of the Valley of Oaxaca (Fig. 2.4). Rising to heights of more than 2,500 m (including Cerro Guirone, El Tigre, and Nueve Puntas), the mountains descend in a short distance to the east (approximately 10 km) to 1,200 m above sea level along the banks of the deeply incised Hormiga Colorada, which largely defines the eastern limit of the surveyed area (Figs. 2.5 and 2.6). There are no large tracks of flat FEINMAN AND NICHOLAS: SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN ALBARRADAS, OAXACA, MEXICO 9</page><page sequence="17">Fig. 2.6. The Hormiga Colorada. agricultural land within the surveyed region. The area to the west, in eastern Tlacolula, is in a rain shadow cast by the aforementioned mountains and is the driest part of the Valley of Oaxaca. In contrast, the eastern slopes of the mountains, the Albarradas area, receive much more rain and are heavily vegetated where not cleared for farming (Fig. 2.7). On more than one occasion during the survey, we returned to clear, dry weather in Mitla (where we lived) after getting drenched by an afternoon shower on the other side of the mountain. The air is decidedly much more humid in the low, narrow valley of the Hormiga Colorada, which is one of the few areas near the Valley of Oaxaca where more tropical plant varieties grow (see Cook, 1983). This area is much lower than the valley floor in eastern Tlacolula, which ranges between 1,600 and 1,800 m above sea level. The Albarradas survey region also includes the small, dry, high valley northeast of Mitla, where the modern highway exits the Valley of Oaxaca (Figs. 2.8 and 2.9). The Valley of Oaxaca is home, past and present, to Zapotee speakers. The present eastern limit of the area inhabited by Zapotec-speaking peoples is close to the eastern boundary of the Guirún/Albarradas survey region. The rugged mountains of the Sierra Mixe lie farther east (Schmieder, 1930, p. 60; Beals, 1973, p. 5), beginning approximately 10 km beyond the eastern edge of our study area (Fig. 2.10). Today, this strip of mountain slopes between the easternmost Zapotee communities and the ethnically and linguistically distinct Mixe is very sparsely settled. There have been historical studies of the Mixe area in the 20th century (e.g., Schmieder, 1930; Beals, 1973; Kuroda, 1984; Lipp, 1991) and limited salvage archaeology of tombs in the Mixe region (e.g., Markens &amp; Winter, 2014) and Albarradas area (Higelin et al., 2013), but the region for the most part remains unstudied archaeologically. A recent report of ceramics from several locations in the Mixe area (Hutson, 2014) has revealed strong affiliations with both the Valley of Oaxaca and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Although most of the collected materials in Hutson's reporting lack adequate provenience, the findings conform to the view that the Mixe region was interconnected with neighboring areas during the pre-Hispanic era. Historically, Mixe settlements were small and dispersed along slopes and accessible gorges, and their residents frequently skirmished with each other (Schmieder, 1930, p. 62; Beals, 1973, pp. 10-11). According to Mixe oral histories, they also had long-standing rivalries with Zapotees (S. M. King, 2012, p. 236). At the time of the Spanish Conquest, the relations between Zapotees and Mixes reportedly were hostile: "The extreme aggressiveness of the Mije had so intimidated the Tzapotec that the latter appreciated the proximity of the Spaniards and turned to them for protection" (Schmieder, 1930, Fig. 2.7. Eastern slopes of Cerro Guirone (viewed from TL-SLA-SLA-20). 10 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="18">Fig. 2.8. Small valley in the northwestern part of the survey region; the tall peak in the distance is Cerro Guirone. p. 60; see also Burgoa [1670-1674] in Beals, 1973, p. 11). The English translation of albarradas is "walls," and there are at least five modern towns in the mountainous areas east and north of the Valley of Oaxaca that include albarradas in their names, a reference to the defensive features found at sites in the region (Brito de Marti, 1982, p. 623). Accounts from the 1500s include mention of at least four walled settlements or fortresses in the vicinity of Mitla (Horcasitas &amp; George, 1955, p. 23). Nevertheless, whatever the extent of hostilities, these acrimo- nious relations did not interfere extensively with interaction and exchange, as indicated by Hutson's (2014) analysis of Mixe ceramics. Well into the 20th century, Mitla was the economic center of the eastern end of the Valley of Oaxaca, located at the juncture Fig. 2.9. Northern part of the survey region and the mountain pass traversed by the modern road; Cerro Guirone is the tallest peak to the right; several small défendable sites are located on the two ridgetops on either side of the pass, which is in the center of the ridgeline.

Parsons, 1936, map III; Beals 1979, p. 165). Prior to the construction of paved highways in the middle of the 20th century, more than half of the able-bodied men in Mitla were traders or porters. They traveled by foot not only within the valley but also all the way to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in pursuit of goods to buy and sell (E. C. Parsons, 1936, pp. 10-14; Beals, 1979, p. 166). The most direct and important route traversed a mountain pass between Mitla and San Lorenzo Albarradas (Beals 1973, p. 5; Cook, 1983, p. 41), passing south of Cerro Guirone. This was the principal route - the Camino Real - through the Mixe area. It served as a passage to bring products from as far away as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec to the valley via Mitla (Beals, 1979, p. 177). The late Fausto Olivera, who grew up in the area and was our principal local field assistant until his untimely death, pointed out parts of this route during our survey, also telling us that this was the principal route to Tehuantepec prior to the construction of the International (Pan American) Highway. This long-used trade route follows the Tehuantepec River from Tehuantepec west through Jalapa to Nejapa (Ball &amp; Brockington, 1978, p. Ill), which was an important stop on the route (Fig. 2.12; S. M. King, 2012, pp. 231, 245). From Nejapa, the route follows the river north and passes through the Mixe area and the heart of the Guirún/ Albarradas survey region, although there were other minor routes as well (Ball &amp; Brockington, 1978, p. Ill; see also Fahmel Beyer, 2005, 2010). Other routes that wind from the Gulf Coast to the north pass through the Mixe area and intersect the Camino Real before the mountain pass by San Lorenzo Albarradas (E. C. Parsons, 1936, map III). Thus the small Guirún/ Albarradas area was a nexus between larger regions, especially before the construction of the Pan American Highway. Nevertheless, the new superhighway from Mitla to the Pacific Coast, built after this study, does pass through the region. What We Knew before the Survey In the mid-1990s before we began our survey, we were aware of three sites of historic and mythic importance in the area at the valley's physiographic eastern edge, both in the Tlacolula arm on the western slopes of the Nueve Puntas-Cerro Guirone mountain ridge and in the Albarradas area on the eastern side, that would be within the bounds of the area we planned to investigate (Fig. 2.13). Although some site-specific information was available for these sites, we had basic unanswered questions about all of them. As we carried out the survey, we learned of two additional sites that were not in the literature but that were well known to local people; we are uncertain whether archaeologists previously visited either site. The best known of these sites is Guirún (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2004a). The site spreads over high piedmont ridges and mountain slopes in the easternmost part of the Tlacolula Valley, approximately 5 km east of Mitla (Fig. 2.14). Guirún takes its name from Cerro Guirone, one of the defining physiographic features of eastern Tlacolula. The top of this high cone-shaped peak is visible far from the west and from part of the Mixe area to the east. The Camino Real traverses the mountain saddle south of this peak. Sites with standing pre-Hispanic adobe walls are very rare in the Valley of Oaxaca, so reports of standing "Indian" walls drew the first explorers to Guirún in the 1800s. In searching for these walls, or paredones , Dupaix (1834) discovered a subter- ranean cruciform tomb below a ruined adobe structure on a lower slope of the site (Fig. 2.15). A second, more elaborate cruciform tomb on a higher slope and decorated with mosaic stone grecas was not reported until 50 years later (Ober, 1 887, p. 542) (Figs. 2.16 and 2.17). Marshall Saville (1900, 1909) visited the site around the turn of the 20th century as part of his study of ancient cruciform tombs in and around Mitla and excavated both tombs. Based on architectural features and the fact that the tomb constructed with carved stones was thought to have never been finished, Saville (1900) concluded that both tombs were Late Postclassic (AD 950-1520). Saville also spent time clearing vegetation from other structures, including a two-room temple that fronts a large enclosed plaza and associated ballcourt (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, figure 4.6). He recovered debris from stone working and noted that several ancient stone quarries were nearby. Saville, like all the other early visitors to the site, was unaware of (or ignored) the terraced slopes surrounding the tombs and other architecture (Fig. 2.18): "It is not a desirable location for a large settlement," and "it would have been impossible for the steep sides of the hills to be used for habitation" (Saville, 1900, p. 210). A few scholar/explorers (Tweedie, 1911; Schmieder, 1930; E. C. Parsons, 1936) visited Guirún following Saville's sojourn there, but it was not until 1980 that the site was preliminarily mapped and both tombs were placed in fuller temporal and spatial context during the Valley of Oaxaca Settlement Pattern Project (Kowalewski et al., 1989, figure A.IX.53). Findings from the regional survey also led to a conundrum. Saville had earlier concluded that the Guirún tombs were Late Postclassic, yet Classic period ceramics were more abundant on the site than were Postclassic ceramics. Few Late Postclassic sherds were recovered on the high ridge where the carved cruciform tomb was constructed, either during the regional survey or during Saville's excavations of the tomb. The Guirún site was surveyed near the end of the 1980 field season and was covered with dense, often thorny vegetation. Time was short, and the regional survey boundary was drawn just upslope of the recorded architectural complexes. Given the elaborate architecture at the site, its size estimate seemed low, around 600 people during its maximum extent in the Late 12 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="20">Fig. 2.1 1. Travel routes near Mitla in the 1930s (adapted from E. C. Parsons, 1936, map III). Classic (Kowalewski et al., 1989, p. 296). We suspected that the site might extend farther up the slopes of Cerro Guirone outside the area surveyed in 1980. Our questions about the Guirún site were one factor that led us to propose and carry out the regional survey of the Guirún/Albarradas area, not only to possibly complete the survey of the site but also to place it in its fuller spatial context. We did indeed find that Guirún was larger than mapped during the 1980 survey, that it extended farther up the slopes of Cerro Guirone and incorporated a large ridge system to the north that includes the La Cuadrada stone quarry (E. C. Parsons, 1936, plate LI, top). Through analysis of materials we collected during the 1995 regional survey, the 1996 intensive site survey of Guirún, and ceramics from Saville's excavations that are curated at the American Museum of FEINMAN AND NICHOLAS: SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN ALBARRADAS, OAXACA, MEXICO 13</page><page sequence="21">Fig. 2.12. Principal ancient travel routes into the Valley of Oaxaca from the north, east, and south. Natural History in New York, we determined that the Guirún tombs were constructed during the Early Postclassic (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, pp. 146-148, cf. Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2004a, p. 71). In the Valley of Oaxaca, Early Postclassic pottery is not easily distinguished from earlier Late Classic pottery, so this reassessment appears to resolve the earlier conundrum (Fein- man &amp; Nicholas, 2013, pp. 146-152). The second known site is a large stone quarry on a high piedmont ridge east of Mitla that is locally called La Cuadrada (E. C. Parsons 1936, plate LI, top) due to the large blocks of ignimbrite that were cut from the underlying bedrock but never moved from the site (Figs. 2.19 and 2.20). The quarry had drawn early attention as visitors to Mitla, who were impressed by the large stone blocks used in the construction of Mitla's elaborate buildings and tombs, sought to find the source of the building stones. Although Saville had noted La Cuadrada and other quarries in the Mitla area, William Henry Holmes (1897) was the first to report extensively on them. Howel Williams and Robert Heizer (1965) later visited the quarries during a geological survey of the Mitla area. The La Cuadrada quarry is just beyond the 1980 survey boundary and was not investigated in greater detail until Nelly Robles García (1994) completed her study of known quarries in the Mitla area. She hypothesized that people from Mitla and elsewhere in the area exploited La Cuadrada in pre-Hispanic times and that the quarry could have been the source for cut stone blocks used in Postclassic constructions at Mitla. Yet with few ceramics recovered during her investigation of La Cuadrada and no off-quarry survey of the surrounding area, it was not possible to test the presumption that the quarry was relatively isolated and distant from any concentrated settlements. During our 1995 survey, we found a continuous scatter of Postclassic ceramics that connected La Cuadrada with the impressive ruins at Guirún. Earlier during the Classic period, concentrated settlement at Guirún was as close as 500 m from the quarry. The quarry was not isolated and open to exploitation by all comers at the time when the Mitla palaces were constructed. During subsequent excavations that we conducted at the Mitla Fortress (2 km west of Mitla) from 2009 to 2011 (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2011b), we ascertained that stone- working skills did not develop late in the Mitla area but rather were part of the occupational repertoire in this part of the valley as early as the middle of the Classic period. 14 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="22">Fig. 2.13. The Guirún/Albarradas survey region showing principal features, modern towns, location of five known sites, the dividing line between eastern Tlacolula and the Albarradas area, and the Camino Real. The third site is Hierve el Agua on the eastern side of the mountains, south of San Lorenzo Albarradas near the modern village of Roaguia. Today, the site is a tourist attraction known for a series of natural, freshwater springs oversaturated with calcium carbonate and two spectacular rock formations like waterfalls that formed over thousands of years (Figs. 2.21 and 2.22). The site also has pre-Hispanic occupations and a series of terraces and fossilized canals that date back as far as 300 BC, although investigators disagree on whether these features were used in agriculture or for salt production (Flannery et al., 1967; Hewitt et al., 1987; Peterson et al., 1989; Neely et al., 1990). With little or no information on other archaeological sites in this area beyond the physiographic bounds of the Valley of Oaxaca, these investigators considered Hierve el Agua unique and, at least implicitly, emphasized the significance of the natural springs in drawing people to reside nearby. During the survey, we recorded a number of contemporaneous sites in similar environmental settings as Hierve el Agua - défendable promontories near well-watered slopes on the eastern side of the Nueve Puntas-Cerro Guirone ridge - so while the fossilized canals at Hierve el Agua may be unique, the physical location of the ancient settlement is not entirely out of line with similar sites (especially in regard to its earliest occupation). Nueve Puntas is the name for the high mountain ridge that defines the southeastern limits of the Valley of Oaxaca (Fig. 2.23). We did not expect that it would be necessary to climb this tall, majestic series of nine peaks that are visible from more than 40 km away in the center of the valley. On its southeastern side, away from the valley, the ridge comprises a steep rock cliff with a 500-m drop (Fig. 2.24). There also were no archaeological investigations or published accounts of any sites on Nueve Puntas. But during the survey, we began to hear from local people that there was a series of walls just below the top of several of the peaks that they thought were colonial or historic corrals. Although we had doubts that there could be a pre- Hispanic site on Nueve Puntas, it seemed even less probable that anyone would have tended a herd of large herbivores on or near the top of this steep mountain. So we changed our original research plan and made the climb. The walls were there, but they were not corrals; they were defensive walls associated with a very well preserved set of residential terraces dating to late in the pre-Hispanic era (Fig. 2.25).

Cerro Guirone and the Guirún site at the eastern edge of the Tlacolula arm of the valley; the Guirún site extends down the lower slopes of Cerro Guirone to the terraced slope in the center of the image. Llego Yiachi is the name for a distinctive, steep-sided rocky butte that resembles a scaled-down Devils Tower (Fig. 2.26). It rises above rough terrain along the Hormiga Colorada at the eastern edge of the survey area and, from the west, appears impossible to climb. But again, we were told of ancient ruins on the top of the butte, including standing adobe walls. We scrambled up and, indeed, did find well-preserved adobe walls (Fig. 2.27) that rival those at the Mitla Fortress (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2004a, pp. 41-44). These five sites are discussed in greater detail in the relevant temporal chapters that present the settlement pattern data through time. Although Guirún, La Cuadrada, Hierve el Agua, Nueve Puntas, and Llego Yiachi may be among the most impressive sites in the surveyed area, they alone cannot tell the Fig. 2.15.

The other 60-plus previously undocumented sites in the region provide the necessary fuller temporal and spatial context. Field and Laboratory Analysis For our study of the Guirún/Albarradas area, we endeavored to maintain consistency with the general methodology of the surveys of the Oaxaca and Ejutla Valleys (Blanton et al., 1982; Kowalewski et al., 1989; Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013), which in turn was adapted from the highland survey methodology that Fig. 2.16.

William Sanders (1965) and his colleagues (Sanders et al., 1979; J. R. Parsons, 2009) developed in the Basin of Mexico (for fuller discussion, see Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, pp. 26-27). In the Oaxaca and Ejutla surveys, we walked every field and accessible slope and hilltop, checking for archaeological remains and mapping them directly on aerial photographs enlarged to a scale of 1:5,000. Aerial photographs at that scale are ideal for survey in relatively flat, semiarid highland valleys without dense stands of vegetation. They are less useful in mountainous areas where heavy vegetation often hides features of the landscape and also hinders the accurate piecing together of the photographic mosaics. For the Guirún/ Albarradas survey, we employed a combina- tion of aerial photographs and topographic maps. Based on our experience using 1:5,000 aerial photographs in the steeper zones at the edges of the Oaxaca and Ejutla survey regions, we decided instead to enlarge the aerial mosaics to 1:10,000. Aerial photographs at this scale worked well for planning and implementing coverage in most of the survey area. They provided sufficient detail for mapping artifact distributions at the same time that the larger area covered on each photograph made it easier to decide how to position survey transects and to cover ridgetops in often difficult and remote terrain. In the more mountainous, tree-covered parts of the survey area, we relied more heavily on 1:50,000 INEGI topographic maps, as dense distributions of trees on the photographs obscured the terrain. In a few areas where the aerial photographic mosaics were put together poorly (e.g., a bad seam ran through the Guirún site down to Roaguia, with a large strip of terrain missing), we depended entirely on the topographic maps.

Calcified formations at Hierve el Agua, viewed from the north. Fig. 2.22. Calcified formation and tourist area at Hierve el Agua. aerial photographs of appropriate scale were available for the northernmost part of the survey area. In flatter terrain, we traversed the area using the aerial photographs. We walked back and forth in teams of three to four people, checking every field, hill, and unpaved street in villages for surface indications of archaeological remains. For the steeper, more mountainous terrain, we slightly modified those field techniques and utilized procedures similar to those that were employed in the Peñoles region (Kowalewski, 1991; Finsten, 1996), the Sierra Norte (Drennan, 1989), and the Sola Valley (Balkansky, 2002). In these rougher areas, we walked and checked the top of every hill and ridgeline and also checked the bases of ridges where they begin to flatten out without necessarily covering all the precipitous and heavily vegetated slopes in between. Contemporary habitations in the survey region and surrounding mountains are almost always con- structed on flat ridgetops or at the base of ridges and almost never on steep slopes. Because of the remoteness of much of the area (far even from unpaved roads); the steep, rough terrain; and the large number of poisonous snakes we encountered, we also often walked in pairs, an unnecessary practice during the valley surveys. When we observed archaeological remains, we mapped their extent on both the topographic map and the aerial photograph when possible. The outlines and the most significant features of larger sites with terraces and mounded architecture were placed on the map and photograph. Terrace and other architectural preservation tended to be good in the Guirún/Albarradas area, and we were able to measure most residential terraces, house foundations, and platform mounds that we observed. We drew those features to scale and relative to each other on graph paper or in field notes and then every evening melded these maps with 18 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="26">Fig. 2.23. The distinctive mountain ridge Nueve Puntas defines the eastern edge of the Valley of Oaxaca. the drawings on the photos and topographic maps to produce a final map of the site. In the field, we used the broadly applied 100-m rule (Blanton et al., 1982, p. 40; Kowalewski et al., 1989, pp. 29-30; Balkánsky, 2002, p. 30; Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, pp. 30- 31), defining a new site when no pre-Hispanic materials were observed within 100 m of the last occurrence. This practice provides maximum flexibility to record and organize field notes during survey and does not preclude combining sites later during analysis and interpretation. We followed the tripartite labeling system used in the Oaxaca and Ejutla surveys to assign field numbers to all sites. Each field name consists of three sets of letters followed by a number (e.g., TL-MIT-CC-1); the first letters refer to the administrative district (Tlacolula), the second set to the municipio (head town), and the third set to the agenda (the smallest administrative unit). Sites are numbered consec- Fig. 2.24. The 500-m rock cliff on the southeastern side of Nueve Puntas.

Series of pre-Hispanic stone walls on Nueve Puntas. utively within these units as they are recorded in the field. More than 80% of the recorded sites are situated in lands that belong to San Lorenzo Albarradas (SLA), one site belongs to Santiago Matatlán (MAT), and the rest belong to San Pablo Villa de Mitla (MIT). San Lorenzo has one agenda , Roaguía (RO), and Mitla has two, Corral del Cerro (CC, now called San Juan del Paso) and Xaaga (XA). For each archaeological site, we recorded a consistent set of information on the nature of the archaeological materials that were present, the condition of the site, its environmental context, and modern use. Each site was dated and its size estimated by the spatial extent of the pottery visible on the surface, following the established ceramic sequence for the Valley of Oaxaca (see Table 1.1; Caso et al., 1967; Kowalewski et al., 1978, 1989; Feinman, 1980). Collections of ceramics and other surface materials were taken from one or more sectors of all the largest sites and in any other circumstance where we wanted to document more permanently the pre-Hispanic materials and to study them more fully. In total, we made 51 artifact collections from the 69 sites recorded during the survey (Table 2.1). One site lacked visible ceramics and could not be dated. Three sites on the western edge of the Guirún survey area were previously recorded in 1980; our findings at these three sites, including the Guirún site, expand the data collected in 1980. The 68 sites that could be dated include 123 separate Fig. 2.26. Western rock face of Llego Yiachi in the southeastern part of the survey area. Fig. 2.27. Standing pre-Hispanic adobe walls on the top of Llego . Yiachi. temporal components. More than half of the sites (63%) had ceramics from only one phase, mostly Monte Albán V. To process all the information and materials collected during this research, we followed the basic laboratory and analytical procedures that were employed during the Oaxaca and Ejutla survey projects (for a detailed discussion of these procedures, see Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, pp. 30-32). In the field laboratory, we washed and tabulated all the ceramic collections and made final temporal assessments that were checked against the information recorded on the maps and aerial photographs and in our field notes. We used this information to draw the boundary of each temporal component at every site and then used a compensating polar planimeter to measure the area (in hectares) of each component. We then estimated the population of every site component using procedures initially developed by William Sanders (1965) and Jeffrey Parsons (1971) for the Basin of Mexico surveys that were subsequently adapted for the Oaxaca and Ejutla surveys (Blanton et al., 1982, pp. 10-11; Feinman et al., 1985, p. 336; Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, p. 31). At most sites in the Guirún/ Albarradas area, ceramic densities were similar to those encountered in Oaxaca and Ejutla, categorized as very light in comparison with the heavier densities that had been encoun- tered in the Basin of Mexico (Sanders, 1965). We used the corresponding density figures of 10-25 people per hectare to estimate the population of most sites. A range of 5-10 people per hectare (or fraction thereof for all sites smaller than 1 ha) was used for temporal components for which we had observed only a trace of ceramics. More than 30% of the sites in the surveyed region had residential terraces or other visible domestic architecture that allowed us to estimate the number of houses. Most of the terraces were small and were counted as housing a single residence. We used a figure of approximately 300 m2 per house lot (Winter, 1974, p. 982; Blanton, 1978, p. 30) to estimate the number of houses on larger terraces. We also included estimates of house foundations in unterraced areas. Once we had the total number of houses at a site, we used a range of 5-10 people per house. When terraces were too destroyed to count or measure, we used a terrace density of 25- 50 people per hectare for that sector of the site. For sites that included both terraced and unterraced areas, we calculated the population separately for each sector of the site and then summed those figures to obtain the estimated total population of the site. 20 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="28">Table 2.1.

This archive includes more than 10,000 pieces of sourced obsidian from pre-Hispanic contexts in Oaxaca, a state for which there are no known obsidian sources. Obsidian circulated widely in Mesoamerica (e.g., Braswell, 2003), with tools and flakes of the material often found in pre- Hispanic contexts far from the original source from which it was mined. By expanding the sample of sourced obsidian and using new analytical methods, such as social network analysis (Golitko et al., 2012; Feinman et al., 2015; Golitko &amp; Feinman, 2015), we have documented that the exchange of obsidian in Mesoamerica was anything but static across time; rather, through time and across space, the networks of interaction were dynamic in intensity, directionality, and the principal sources that were exploited. These shifts reflect and are part of larger-scale processes and changes across Mesoamerica on which we are able to draw to assess what happened more locally in the Valley of Oaxaca and its possible links to broader spatial fields. The Oaxaca samples that we have sourced come from dozens of sites in the Valley of Oaxaca and nearby regions. Jane Pires- Ferreira (1975, 1976) carried out the first sourcing studies in Oaxaca on small samples of obsidian from Early and Middle Formative sites. Using p-XRF, we have expanded the archive by more than an order of magnitude. We have been able to source the obsidian from some Late/Terminal Formative sites but mostly from Classic and Postclassic contexts that were excavated by a wide array of researchers, including ourselves. The archive for the entire state of Oaxaca includes obsidian from 18 different mines or sources. As with the pan- Mesoamerican archive, there are temporal changes and spatial variation in the obsidian that reached highland Oaxaca during the pre-Hispanic era. For the Late Classic, when we have the largest sample, obsidian assemblages varied not only from one site to another but also between houses at individual sites (Feinman et al., 2013). Although most of the obsidian that we have sourced is from excavated contexts, we also have sourced some obsidian that is associated with surface ceramics, including from the Guirún site. We make use of these archives of sourced obsidian when discussing interaction and exchange during the Classic and Postclassic periods. Pre-Hispanic Land Use Analysis To examine the relations between settlements and their surrounding catchments and between population and agrarian resources, we extended the pre-Hispanic land use analyses of the Ejutla and Oaxaca Valleys (Kowalewski, 1980, 1982; Nicholas, 1989) into the Guirún/Albarradas survey region (for a more detailed discussion than is presented here, see Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, pp. 32-37). These analyses build on Anne Kirkby's (1973) seminal study of contemporary farming practices in the Valley of Oaxaca. Kirkby (p. 26) recognized that water is the critical resource determining agricultural yields in the valley. She married moisture availability with arable land to map the distribution of agricultural resources across the region. Stephen Kowalewski (1980, 1982, p. 151) then simplified her classification by grouping land classes with similar yields. The highest yields are possible on Class I land (canal-irrigable and water-table land). Yields on Class II land (marginal water- table and good floodwater-farming land) can be as high but are generally more variable temporally. Crops may fail altogether in dry years on Class III land (poor floodwater and dry-farming land) but can be highly productive in wet years. Class III land on steep slopes is considered only 10% arable. Another important contribution was Kent Flannery's (Flannery et al., 1967; Flannery, 1970) findings that many simple water manipulation practices, which were employed in the Valley of Oaxaca well into the 20th century, had great time depth. Kirkby also attempted to extrapolate yields back into the pre- Hispanic past. She examined archaeological maize cobs from Tehuacan and Oaxaca and found increasing cob length through time, which correlates with increasing yields (A. V. Kirkby, 1973, pp. 124-126). Using Kirkby's modern ranges and her estimates of past yields, we extrapolated high and low yields in metric tons per hectare (basically for high and low annual rainfall, respectively) for each land class throughout the pre- Hispanic sequence (Kowalewski, 1980, p. 154, 1982, p. 156; Nicholas, 1989). These yields are based entirely on maize, as we do not have information on pre-Hispanic crop mixes that would allow a more precise accounting. The maize yields serve as a proxy for total crop yields in temporal and spatial comparisons. The yield figures also take into account the critical limit in annual rainfall in Oaxaca (700 mm) that is required for a successful crop by adjusting yield figures in areas where the average annual rainfall is less than that amount to reflect marginal conditions for agriculture (Kowalewski, 1982, pp. 155-156). We recognize, however, that xerophytic plants may have played a larger role in subsistence in the driest (and steepest) parts of the region than is reflected in the maize yields (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2005; Feinman et al., 2007). There are no large expanses of flat, valley floor land in the mountainous area at the eastern edge of the Valley of Oaxaca, and less than 1% of the Guirún/Albarradas survey tract is classified as Class I or II land; 40% is Class III land, and 60% is mountain slope that is uncultivable or only 10% arable (Fig. 2.28). These mountains and the area to the east, however, do receive more than 700 mm of annual rainfall and are classed as high-rainfall areas. With sufficient rainfall, Class III land can be as productive as Class II land. As an analytical tool to facilitate spatial comparisons, we extended the 4 X 4-km grid square system used in the Oaxaca and Ejutla Valleys and calculated the total amount of each land class per grid square (Table 2.2). Applying the respective yield ranges to each land class (for each time period) provides an estimate of agricultural resource potentials (i.e., carrying capacity or primary productivity) that can be compared across space and time. For approximations of the amount of food the pre-Hispanic populations that resided in the region during each time period could have produced, we factored in the available labor supply and the land area that a pre-Hispanic farmer could have cultivated. Those calculations are based on A. V. Kirkby's (1973, p. 73) figure of 2 ha per farmer each year using a coa , the 22 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="30">Fig. 2.28. Distribution of agricultural land classes in the Guirún/ Albarradas survey region. traditional Mesoamerican hoe (see also Tolstoy, 1988), and also Kowalewski's (1980, p. 156) interpretation of Wayne Kappel's (1977) past and present population profiles for four communi- ties in the eastern arm of the Valley of Oaxaca, in which he approximated the pre-Hispanic labor force as half the estimated archaeological population. As a proxy for the distance a farmer might travel to his fields (e.g., Chisholm, 1968), we confined all farmers to the grid square in which they resided. But regardless of why they chose to settle where they did, we assumed that they would farm the best land available to them. Within each grid square, we deployed all farmers to Class I and II land before adding in Class III land. With these figures, we have approximations of producible local food supplies (in metric tons) and how they varied across time and space. An additional analytical step is to convert the potential agricultural yields into levels of population that could have been sustained. Kowalewski (1982, p. 152) reviewed consumption figures in ethnographic studies of communities in Oaxaca and elsewhere in Mesoamerica and arrived at a range of 0.16-0.29 metric tons of maize per person per year. We divided the potential agricultural yields by those consumption figures to calculate ranges of potential population that can be compared to archaeological populations across time and space to identify areas where the production of surpluses was possible and other areas where food imports (or greater reliance on wild, noncultivated resources) would have been necessary.

For ease of presentation, we generally refer to mean values. Because of high rainfall in the Albarradas area, farmers past and present can make a living in spite of the lack of large tracts of flat agricultural land and few opportunities for watering their crops beyond rainfall. But there was still risk given the unpredictable timing and nature of rainfall in highland Oaxaca. In average-rainfall years throughout the sequence, farmers in the Albarradas area could have grown more than enough food to supply all residents of the area. Only during the Early Classic, when settlement in the Albarradas area was heavily concentrated in one large site, would farmers have had possible difficulty growing enough food. With reduced rainfall in dry years, local produce during much of the pre-Hispanic period may have been insufficient in many parts of the area. With agricultural risk in addition to the personal risks of living in a cultural transition zone, the residents of Albarradas must have been reliant on exchange networks that followed the principal travel routes through the area on their way to the Valley of Oaxaca. Today, tourist visits to the hot springs at Hierve el Agua help sustain the local economies of communities in this region. Eastern Tlacolula and the Albarradas Area We referred to the area that we surveyed in 1995 as the Guirún survey region because it centered on the Guirún site and the mountain slopes of Cerro Guirone at the eastern edge of the Valley of Oaxaca. Guirún historically was the most well known settlement in this region. The surveyed area includes not only the high mountains at the eastern end of the Valley of Oaxaca and the eastern slopes of those mountains in the Albarradas area but also area and sites (most notably Guirún) on the western side of the mountains that are part of eastern Tlacolula. As a whole, the surveyed area does not form one coherent physiographic region or subarea that can be compared to the Valley of Oaxaca or any of its constituent subregions. Such cross-regional comparisons facilitated the reporting on the FEINMAN AND NICHOLAS: SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN ALBARRADAS, OAXACA, MEXICO 23</page><page sequence="31">regional survey in the Ejutla Valley at the southern end of the Valley of Oaxaca (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013). Here, we include all sites found during the survey, but for analytical, spatial comparisons we divide the Guirún survey region along the mountain divide (see Fig. 2.13). We refer to the eastern side of the divide as the Albarradas area and the western side as eastern Tlacolula. For all subregional comparisons, we have added the sites on the western side of the divide to the data that were previously aggregated for the eastern Tlacolula subregion. Thus the figures that we present are an update from what has been reported earlier (e.g., Kowalewski et al., 1989; Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013). The changes in both the total number of sites and the population estimates are especially marked for Monte Alban V. Throughout this study, we focus on the shifting relationship (e.g., Stoddart, 2010) between the Albarradas region and adjacent eastern Tlacolula. Eastern Tlacolula is the driest subregion of the Valley of Oaxaca, with the lowest yields and least reliable maize production (Taylor, 1972, p. 102; A. V. Kirkby, 1973; Nicholas, 1989; Druijven &amp; Kruithof, 1992). During the Formative period (ca. 1600 BC-AD 200), popula- tions tended to be sparser in eastern Tlacolula than elsewhere in the valley (Kowalewski et al., 1989, pp. 63-64; Blanton et al., 1993, pp. 55-59). In contrast, for the Classic period, population densities in eastern Tlacolula were as high as or higher than in other sectors of the valley (Nicholas, 1989, p. 497; Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, pp. 96, 127). During the Postclassic period, Tlacolula, especially eastern Tlacolula, was the most densely settled sector (Kowalewski et al., 1989, p. 312; Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, p. 160). The high populations in eastern Tlacolula do not conform to the distribution of land and water resources in the Valley of Oaxaca. We have no evidence of major climatic changes that would have tilted greater availabil- ity of these resources toward eastern Tlacolula (Schoenwetter, 1974). So why did eastern Tlacolula become the most densely settled sector, and how did the population of that sector support themselves in their dry environment? Can the networks that pass through the Albarradas region yield any clues toward understanding these patterns? Craft production is one activity that likely helped sustain Tlacolula's population (Finsten, 1983, 1995; Kowalewski et al., 1989; Blanton et al., 1993; Feinman et al., 2002). Local stone sources and fibrous xerophytic plants were especially important economic resources in eastern Tlacolula (Feinman et al., 2002; Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2005). The mountains in eastern Tlacolula are underlain by a layered volcanic tuff (M. J. Kirkby et al., 1986) where numerous veins of silicified tuff, or chert, have formed over time (Marcus &amp; Flannery, 1996, p. 45). Chert outcrops of varying quality were heavily exploited in eastern Tlacolula, and stone nodules were the most common natural resource we observed during the survey of Albarradas. Many sites in the Albarradas area were situated on or near a chert source, and the most common craft specialization that we recorded was chert working. Magueys ( Agave spp.) are highly versatile and long have been recognized as economically important in highland Mexico throughout the pre-Hispanic era (e.g., Gonçalves de Lima, 1956; MacNeish, 1967; C. E. Smith &amp; Kerr, 1968; M. E. King, 1986; Evans, 1990; J. R. Parsons, 2010; Correa-Ascencio et al., 2014); they are especially abundant in the dry, eastern arm of the valley (Sanchez López, 1989), including on archaeological sites (Martínez y Ojeda, 1996; Middleton et al., 2001). During excavations at several sites in eastern Tlacolula, we found high numbers of stone and bone tools associated with the processing and weaving of fiber into a range of products for immediate use and for exchange (Feinman et al., 2002; Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2004b). Palmillo, or yucca ( Yucca spp.), also was exploited for fiber during the pre-Hispanic era (e.g., Sheldon, 1980; Anawalt, 1981, p. 27; Berdan, 1987, p. 245). Although large groves of palmillo are present on several archaeological sites in eastern Tlacolula (Martínez y Ojeda, 1996; Middleton et al., 2001; Feinman et al., 2002), the natural habitat for palmillo is on the eastern side of the mountains, in the Albarradas area (Schmieder, 1930, pp. 23-24; Cook, 1983, p. 41). Into the 20th century, towns in the Albarradas area continued to produce woven palm goods that were brought to Mitla and sold in the markets (E. C. Parsons, 1936, p. 60; Taylor, 1972, 103; Beals, 1979). Palmillos, however, are rare in nonsite contexts in the Valley of Oaxaca today; the plants most likely were brought into the valley in pre-Hispanic times from areas to the east (Albarradas) and fostered as an economic resource that also was turned into products for exchange and local use. The economic circulation of goods was an important facet of life in the Valley of Oaxaca long before the Classic period (e.g., Flannery, 1976; Kowalewski et al., 1983). Yet there is no doubt that exchanges and economic interdependence intensified across the region with the higher populations of the Classic period and greater valley wide interconnections (Kowalewski et al., 1989; Kowalewski, 2003a, 2012; Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2012). We have argued that the option to heavily exploit xerophytic plants for both food and economic products could have succeeded and endured in eastern Tlacolula only in the context of an expanding network of circulation and exchange (e.g., Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2005, 2010, 2012). Comparative Contexts The Valley of Oaxaca is a large, flat, mountain-ringed basin surrounded by many smaller valleys and extensive mountainous areas. Many of the areas that border the Valley of Oaxaca have now been surveyed, including Ejutla (516 km2; Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013) and Sola de Vega (370 km2; Balkánsky, 2002) to the south, the Peñoles area of the Mixtee Sierra to the northwest (850 km2; Kowalewski, 1991; Finsten, 1996), the Sierra Norte to the north (650 km2; Drennan, 1989), and the Albarradas area to the east (88 km2). The Miahuatlán Valley (Markman, 1981) south of Ejutla has been partially surveyed, but because of the nature of the survey there (transects and reconnaissance of an area of 300 km2, mostly along the Miahuatlán River), we can consider only certain relevant patterns/findings. Although variable in the level of detail in recording and presenting settlement data, these studies serve to situate the large highland Valley of Oaxaca into a larger spatial context that extends beyond its mountainous confines (see Fig. 2.1). The physiographic boundary between the southern edge of the Valley of Oaxaca and the Ejutla Valley is not well defined, and we largely consider Ejutla a southern extension, or subarea, of the Valley of Oaxaca (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013). In contrast, the boundaries between the Valley of Oaxaca and 24 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="32">Sierra Norte C_ -O I Etla ' f i Central JX 1 j Peñoles U r- 1 ^ l.

Valley of Oaxaca subareas and neighboring regions that are the principal focus of this volume. Albarradas, Peñoles, Sola, and the Sierra Norte are more sharply defined physiographically. These areas conform more closely to our perception of marginal or frontier areas in that they are separated from the Valley of Oaxaca by mountain ridges. A key element of our analysis here is to compare the Albarradas area with other areas at the edge of the Valley of Oaxaca. The Sola de Vega region has the most comparable detailed reporting (Balkansky, 2002), so we draw the most explicit comparisons with that area. More limited parallels and contrasts are possible with Peñoles (Kowalewski, 1991; Finsten, 1996) and the Sierra Norte (Drennan, 1989), which have been less fully reported. We present many of our comparisons in schematic maps that include all four exterior areas, the Ejutla Valley, and the Valley of Oaxaca divided into six subareas (Fig. 2.29). In these comparisons, a clear pattern emerges, namely, that the areas exterior to the valley do not all follow a similar temporal course. The relationship between the valley and these outlying areas does not just reflect core-periphery dynamics but also a series of other factors, including larger networks of interaction that spread across the Oaxaca highlands and beyond. Andrew Balkansky (2002) completed his land use analyses of the Sola Valley following the procedures that we have used, so we have more than one edge area to compare with the Valley of Oaxaca. Sola comprises a very narrow river valley surrounded by steep forested slopes and in many respects resembles the Albarradas area in terms of overall agricultural productivity. We can compare the six subareas of the Valley of Oaxaca, the Ejutla Valley, Albarradas, and the Sola Valley along two dimensions: agricultural productivity per square kilometer and total potential productivity. In these comparisons, Sola and Albarradas are always near the bottom when it comes to agrarian production. Albarradas receives more rain than [ -1 S Rank order of subregions &lt;? &gt; by productivity per km2 5 ^ &gt; 4 kx h 3 8 /7) ťrw 6 S Fig. 2.30.

Although our calculations of agricultural production and potential maize surpluses and deficits are constructed on a series of assumptions, we believe that their consideration is essential to archaeological analysis, as it draws focus to the intersection between political and economic institutions, house- holds, and broader patterns of networks and relations that cross-cut time and space (e.g., De Lucia &amp; Morehart, 2015, pp. 73-74). Albarradas is far from the center of the Valley of Oaxaca, but population densities were not always lower there than in the rest of the valley system.

In contrast, population densities in Albarradas were relatively larger later, when adjacent Tlacolula became the core of the densest settlement in the valley and demographic densities were reduced elsewhere in the valley system. In the rest of this work, we address a series of historical issues relevant to pre-Hispanic Oaxaca. What took place at the edges of the Valley of Oaxaca and in neighboring areas as Monte Alban was established, reached its greatest extent and power, and then declined? We should be clear that we do not expect that changes in the center of the valley impacted each frontier to the same degree or that the transitions always emanated from the valley's center; what happened in each area abutting the valley also depends on other factors and exterior contacts. We also do not expect that the "boundaries" between the valley and these outlying areas were static (e.g., Stoddart, 2010): "Spatial scales are never fixed, but are perpetually redefined, contested, and restructured in terms of their extent, content, relative importance, and interrelations" (Swyngedouw, 1997, p. 141). That dynamism across time is what we aim to report and, to the degree possible, understand in the pages that follow. 26 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="34">Chapter 3: Middle and Late Formative (Rosario Phase and Monte Albán I) "Throughout the ancient world, urbanization in- volved the social integration of greater scales of community membership as well as the ratcheting up of social divisions along the continua of wealth, power, and occupational specialization that define urban landscapes." (Carballo, 2016, p. 2) During the Early Formative period (ca. 1500-850 BC), the era when the first regional settlement hierarchies began to develop across highland Mesoamerica, community sizes and population densities were highly variable (Balkánsky, 1998b; C. A. Smith, 2002). At that time, the Valley of Oaxaca, in the Southern Highlands, was one of the most densely settled highland areas. Most of the valley's population was concentrated in the northern, Etla arm, around San José Mogote (Kowalewski et al., 1989, pp. 63-66; Flannery &amp; Marcus, 1994, 2005, 2015), the largest community in the valley until Monte Albán was established circa 500 BC (see Fig. 1.1). When it was initially founded circa 1400 BC, San José Mogote was the only settlement in the valley with nonresidential buildings (Marcus &amp; Flannery, 1996, pp. 87-88). In the Mixteca Alta, to the northwest, there were several small valleys where the population was clustered around one large center, like San José Mogote (see Fig. 2.1; Kowalewski et al., 2009). In contrast with those areas, settlements in the rest of highland Oaxaca were smaller 1 o.o / V fi 46? / ^ j ' Early Formative (op ' } j 0.0 0.6 0.1 S 0.3 I &lt;1 t ? °"1 ^ p? ? ^ r Population p - ' i" p' densities per km2 r~0 0 j? ^ (exc'udeSJM) Fig. 3.1.

In the Valley of Oaxaca, population densities dropped quickly with distance from San José Mogote (Fig. 3.1; Table 3.1); they were especially low in eastern Tlacolula and southern Valle Grande. With the exception of the Ejutla Valley at the southern end of the valley, where there were three small dispersed sites (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, figure 4.4), no Early Formative settlements are recorded in any of the other areas (including Albarradas) that ring the Valley of Oaxaca (although we cannot rule out the presence of mobile groups who would have left an ephemeral record). Albarradas and other frontier areas at the physiographic limits of the Valley of Oaxaca were sparsely settled, if at all, prior to the founding of Monte Albán. Not only were the areas most distant from San José Mogote (Sola, Albarradas, and Miahuatlán) empty of sedentary settlements, but even the two edge areas that abut the Etla arm of the valley (Peñoles and Sierra Norte) were devoid of such occupations. Unlike Monte Albán, the later, much larger capital, San José Mogote did not influence or interact intensively with the residents of adjacent hinterlands much beyond the Etla (northern) arm where it was located. In fact, based on previous research (Plog, 1976), even San José Mogote's interaction with the community of Huitzo, at the northern edge of the Etla arm, was limited (see Fig. 1.1). Middle Formative (Rosario Phase) The population of the Valley of Oaxaca did not grow appreciably throughout the Middle Formative period (ca. 850- 500 BC). San José Mogote decreased in size but still remained the region's largest settlement with the most elaborate monumental construction. Yet the region's inhabitants dis- persed across the valley away from the northern, Etla arm (Table 3.2; Kowalewski et al., 1989, p. 72). The initial dominance of San José Mogote lessened as several smaller centers with public architecture were established in the other arms of the valley - Yegüih in the Tlacolula sub valley, Tilcajete in northern Valle Grande, and Tlapacoyan in southern Valle Grande (Fig. 3.2).

Although there was some competition and conflict between these small polities, they engaged each other sufficiently through exchange ties and other networks to have pottery assemblages that clearly belong squarely within a shared Valley of Oaxaca ceramic tradition. This basic settlement pattern - a dominant center surrounded by a cluster of smaller settlements and lower densities of 28 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="36">Table 3.2.

The largest centers attracted the area's populace to settle nearby by providing economic opportunities, including access to certain exotic goods, and possibly a greater degree of security. The sharing of certain decorative motifs on pottery across broad swaths of Meso- america at that time (e.g., R. N. Zeitlin, 1979, pp. 53-54) reveals widespread exchange and interaction, but these early settlement systems remained small. The dispersal of settlement across the Valley of Oaxaca extended south into the northern part of the Ejutla Valley, where four small settlements were established during the Rosario phase, circa 600-500 BC (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 1990, p. 222, 2013, figure 4.6). In the Tlacolula arm, settlement distribution was patchier, more concentrated in western Tlacolula, west of Yegüih. Four small Rosario phase sites near the eastern edge of the Tlacolula Valley were approximately 15 km distant from any other contemporaneous site in Tlacolula (Fig. 3.3; Kowalewski et al., 1989, map 1). The earliest recorded settlement in the Albarradas area (TL- SLA-SLA-52; see Fig. 3.3) was established at the same time in a low field at the eastern edge of the surveyed area, at a very low elevation (1,200 m) near the convergence of the Hormiga Colorada and a principal tributary of the Tehuantepec River. The principal travel route into the Albarradas area from the east follows this tributary. Although the settlement is east of the mountain ridge, it is only slightly more than 10 km from the nearest communities in Tlacolula, the four small Rosario sites in easternmost Tlacolula, which are located near the same route as it descends to Mitla on the western side of the mountain pass. The only other recorded Middle Formative site in the region is a very small settlement at San Dionisio (Fahmel Beyer, 2007, 2010), just south of the physiographic edge of the eastern arm of the Valley of Oaxaca (see Fig. 3.3). This site is approximately 15 km south of the nearest Rosario settlement in eastern Tlacolula Fig. 3.3.

Pottery at the Albarradas site fits well within the Valley of Oaxaca ceramic tradition. More than a dozen café (brown ware) sherds at the site are characteristic of pre-Monte Albán pottery in the Valley of Oaxaca in terms of paste, form, and surface decoration (Table 3.3). Vessel forms include jars with red- painted rims and many tecomates , including one that is similar in form to a tecomate at San José Mogote (Fig. 3.4; Flannery &amp; Marcus, 1994, figure 12.151). The rest of the collection consists of typical Oaxaca graywares, including several with very flared/ everted rims, milky gray surface, or specular red paint characteristic of Valley of Oaxaca pottery in the Middle Formative (Blanton et al., 1982, appendix VII). The Albarradas Rosario phase site was small (1.9 ha) and did not have public architecture. But with an estimated population of around 30, it was still larger than any contemporaneous settlement in eastern Tlacolula. The only other larger sites in Tlacolula were farther west at Yegüih and Hacienda Alferez in the central part of the Tlacolula arm. TL-SLA-SLA-52, in Albarradas, was among the 10 largest sites in all of the Central Valleys of Oaxaca. A possible factor in the size of this community is its location along a natural route into the Valley of Oaxaca from the east that was heavily traveled throughout the pre-Hispanic era and into the present. Given the site's isolation and documentary evidence for hostile relations Fig. 3.4. Pre Monte Albán pottery at TL-SLA-SLA-52 includes red-painted grayware vessel rim, tecomate rim, and sherd from a fluted vessel. - 1 o.o / ' J I 9 fi ° C&gt; / ' J ° n Rosario phase § (o.o) n ' / °'° ' 0.7 i- --5 0.7 M&gt;â,4 S 0.5 I o.4 N 'i r °-4 n) ( r Population y - rj' densities per km2 (exIcudeSJM) Fig. 3.5.

King, 2012), larger size also may have been in part for defense. The low density of population in the Albarradas area was comparable to other areas at the margins of the Valley of Oaxaca at that time (Fig. 3.5), especially Ejutla and the neighboring eastern part of Tlacolula (see Kowalewski et al., 1989, map 2). The southern expansion of population into the Ejutla Valley did not continue into the Sola Valley (Balkansky, 2002) or Miahuatlán (Markman, 1981). There continued to be no sites of this time period in either the Sierra Norte (Drennan, 1989) or the Peñoles area (Kowalewski, 1991). Based on land use analysis, regional populations throughout the study area were far below levels that could have been sustained (Fig. 3.6). With such low populations, the residents of all occupied valley sectors could have grown enough food for themselves, with some to spare, on nearby arable land (Table 3.4). Sufficient labor and not arable land was the limiting factor. By far, the greatest surpluses (enough to feed 1000 people) were possible in Etla, the most densely settled sector (Fig. 3.7; Nicholas, 1989, p. 480), where people may have been attracted to settle near San José Mogote. Potential agricultural surpluses were very low in the sectors with the lowest populations - Albarradas and Ejutla. Exchange of foodstuffs beyond small local areas does not appear to have been a significant factor in interaction networks prior to the establishment of Monte Albán. Monte Albán Early I Monte Albán - the Southern Highland's first urban center - was established on a hilltop at the center of the Valley of 30 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="38">1 2.2% ' Rosario phase i' 1.0%pV^ / 0.9% ^-&lt;^0.6% S 0.5% I 0.7%^ /1 ř~" 0.4 % rý 7 I J Archaeological 1 - Jj population as % of x,0.1% subarea maximum t. potential population Fig. 3.6.

Oaxaca's three arms circa 500 BC (Blanton, 1978; Blan ton et al., 1993, p. 73) during an era of dramatic change across highland Mesoamerica that was characterized by rapid demo- graphic growth, the elaboration of regional settlement hierar- chies, population nucleation in larger settlements than had ever existed before, heightened episodes of public architectural construction, and the production and exchange of higher volumes of utilitarian goods (Blanton et al., 2005; Carballo, 2016). The overall growth rate in the Valley of Oaxaca between the Rosario phase and Monte Albán I (1.4% per annum) was greater than what could have been achieved by natural population increase alone; even a high annual growth rate of 0.6%-0.7% could have been maintained for only brief and localized episodes (Feinman et al., 1985, p. 345; see also Cowgill, 1975; Hassan, 1981, pp. 234, 253). Given low population throughout the region during the Rosario phase, significant in-migration - including the movement and settling Table 3.4.

In-migration from mountainous areas that have not yet been studied by archaeologists also is possible. The location of Monte Alban in what had been a sparsely settled area south of San José Mogote markedly shifted the demographic center of the Valley of Oaxaca (Table 3.5; Kowalewski et al., 1989, pp. 90-91; Blanton et al., 1999, pp. 49-53). Monte Albán's population quickly grew to 5,000 (Blanton, 1978, pp. 33-35). As people were attracted to the new capital, the rural population in the center of the valley expanded rapidly near Monte Albán, and a series of new larger settlements were founded elsewhere in the region (Fig. 3.8; Feinman et al., 1985; Kowalewski et al., 1989, pp. 85-111). Monte Albán I sites were larger, tiers of settlement arranged by size were more hierarchical, and population densities were greater in the Central area around Monte Albán and in the three subregions closest to the center (Etla, northern Valle Table 3.5.

The location of a new regional capital in the valley's center between a series of small, competing polities appears to have been an intentional strategy or social contract to establish a new political order or power-sharing arrangement between what had been autonomous (at least semiautonomous) groups (Blanton et al., 1993, pp. 69-71, 1999, p. 63; Feinman, 2016). The formation of large aggregations involves the redirection of people's time and energy, and they are more likely to be enduring when participants commit to cooperation and collective action and not when ordered by decree (Kowalewski, 32 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="40">ļ 1 1.9 i 9 3 ' Monte Albán Early I / 9 ^ 25.2 - -tu 9 ' Li§j) r^iun ' 4.3 ^r^Ä7 r 47 L 1-1 2ï r 1-5 n) 7 ^ p Population c^l f densities per km2 r&lt; -ļ &gt;? 0.5 (exclude MA) Fig. 3.9. Population densities in the Valley of Oaxaca and neighboring areas during Monte Albán Early I. 2013, p. 213). At Monte Albán, governance of the early polity exhibits many characteristics of collective political organization, whereas indicators of exclusionary rule, including depictions of individualized rulers and concentrations of wealth in select graves and houses, are rare, if not absent, in the city's early history. The most impressive public space at the new center was the large Main Plaza, where a large proportion of the site's population could have gathered at least periodically. At the same time, supernatural symbols, such as Cocijo, provided a broadly shared view of the Zapotee cosmos (Feinman, 2016; Joyce &amp; Barber, 2016, pp. 46-48) that contrasts with the fire- serpent and were-jaguar supernatural opposition of pre-Monte Albán times (Marcus, 1989). The rapid demographic growth of the new urban center, exceeding 5% annually, as well as the demographic boom in immediately surrounding areas, attests to the attractiveness of this reorganization for both those with power and those without (Feinman et al., 1985, p. 345). The large aggregation in a hilltop locality also would have defensive advantages. Concern with defense is one factor that may spur or foment cooperative arrangements at village and larger scales (Kowalewski, 2013; Roscoe, 2013; DeMarrais, 2016). At the same time, in this more secure setting, small-scale labor investments were made in farming strategies (small canals and check dams) that likely increased agrarian production (O'Brien et al., 1982). Markets (Feinman et al., 1984) and reciprocal networks between householders, residing on terraces that shared retaining walls (Feinman, 2006; Kowalewski et al., 2006), helped buffer spatial and annual rainfall periodicities. For those at the top of the social pyramid, the increasing population and potential to produce agrarian surpluses likely helped secure larger funds of power, some of which was returned to the populace through the distribution of public goods and services (Fargher, 2016; Feinman, 2016; Joyce &amp; Barber, 2016). At a domestic scale, the foundation of Monte Albán was timed with significant shifts in residential architecture, household storage, and even food preparation (Blanton et al., 1999). At greater distances, 30-40 km away from Monte Albán, population dropped off markedly (Kowalewski et al., 1989, p. 109). Population densities in eastern Tlacolula and southern Valle Grande were less than a third of the density in the sectors of the region closer to Monte Albán (northern Valle Grande and western Tlacolula). There also was minimal site hierarchy in the eastern and southern extremes of the valley. The 21 settlements dispersed across the Ejutla Valley to the south were all small hamlets or isolated residences (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, pp. 54-55, 57). Balkansky (2002, pp. 35-37) recorded only one Early I site in the more distant Sola Valley. The site was small (less than 0.5 ha) and located in low-lying terrain along the Sola River, similar to the environmental setting of the earliest site in the Albarradas area. Although the site in Sola is isolated, ceramics on the surface most resemble those from the Valley of Oaxaca (Balkansky, 2002, p. 35). South of Ejutla, there also is one possible Early I site on the banks of the Miahuatlán River near the southern end of the Miahuatlán Valley (Markman, 1981, p. 114, table 2-2). This large site near the modern district head town was occupied throughout the sequence, and there is no indication of how large it might have been in Monte Albán Early I. Both local varieties and Valley of Oaxaca graywares are present at that site (Brockington 1973; Markman, 1981, p. 90). The parts of the Central Valleys of Oaxaca that are most distant from Monte Albán continued to be sparsely settled and not as heavily impacted by the foundation of Monte Albán as were areas closer to the center. The establishment of Monte Albán did not markedly or immediately affect the Albarradas area, which is more than 50- 60 km to the east. Settlement patterns in this outlying region did not change appreciably from the Rosario phase. In contrast, the foundation of Monte Albán appears to have had a greater effect on the growth of population in the mountainous hinterlands that were located closer to the urban center. The earliest sites recorded in the Sierra Norte and the Peñoles area date to Monte Albán Early I. All sites with possible Early I occupations in Peñoles are in the southern part of the survey tract that is closest to the Valley of Oaxaca; there were no sites yet in the northwestern part of Peñoles that is closer to the Mixteca Alta (Kowalewski, 1991). The pattern is similar in the Sierra Norte, where most Early I sites are in the center and east, with no sites in the most distant, northwestern part of that survey tract (Drennan, 1989, figure 1 1.4). As the pottery collected at sites in both areas conform to the Valley of Oaxaca ceramic tradition (Drennan, 1989, p. 374; Kowalewski, 1991, pp. 14, 20), we suspect that populations in these mountainous regions inter- acted more closely with valley populations than with Mixtee groups to the west and north. Graywares in the Valley of Oaxaca Monte Albán Early I tradition are extremely rare, if not absent, in the Mixteca Alta (Pérez Rodríguez et al., 2017, p. 589). In addition, the density of settlement in the Sierra Norte was higher than in southern Valle Grande and eastern Tlacolula and all other outlying areas. The site hierarchy also was more developed in the Sierra Norte (Drennan, 1989, p. 376), likely because of greater interaction with the center than was possible in the more distant areas both within the valley and beyond its physiographic boundaries. Although good provenience is FEINMAN AND NICHOLAS: SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN ALBARRADAS, OAXACA, MEXICO 33</page><page sequence="41">Fig. 3.10. Monte Alban Early I settlements in the Guirún/Albarradas survey region. lacking, the earliest known ceramics in the Mixe area (east of the Valley of Oaxaca and Albarradas) date to Monte Albán I; the ceramics have characteristics that show influences from both the Valley of Oaxaca and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (Hutson, 2014, pp. 267-268). The distribution of pottery with characteristics of the Valley of Oaxaca tradition beyond the physiographic limits of the valley illustrates that social and economic interaction permeat- ed physical boundaries, but there is no clear indication of political control. The spread of similar ceramics across wide areas is the result of expanding communication networks. The growing urban capital was beginning to have more widespread influence than San José Mogote had in the prior Rosario phase. The political hegemony of the Monte Albán polity in Early I was much closer to the center of the valley, likely including Etla, the northern part of the Valle Grande, and the western part of Tlacolula (e.g., Feinman, 1998, pp. 126-129), but even those relations were not necessarily marked by firm or finite territorial limits. Long-distance relations were fluid, likely affected by changing networks of interaction and the friction of distance. Monte Albán's greatest political impact and influence likely was limited to areas where the friction of distance did not erode the labor/agrarian taxes that could be exacted. Early I Settlements in Albarradas Two sites in the Albarradas area date to Monte Albán Early I (500-350 BC) (Table 3.6). The Rosario settlement at TL-SLA- SLA-52 almost doubled in size (2.8 ha, estimated population of 50), and one other very small site (TL-SLA-SLA-8) was established on the top of 'a long piedmont ridge descending the eastern side of Cerro Guirone (Fig. 3.10). Although the settlement at TL-SLA-SLA-8 (El Calvario) was larger in later phases, the Early I occupation covered only 0.5 ha, with an estimated population of less than 10. Neither Early I community in the Albarradas area was definitely associated with public architecture. Still, the site above the Hormiga 34 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="42">Fig. 3.1 1. Monte Alban Early I settlements in Tlacolula and the Albarradas area, showing principal places mentioned in the text. Colorada (TL-SLA-SLA-52) continued to be larger than any site in eastern Tlacolula, although its size was no longer anomalous for the Valley of Oaxaca as a whole (Fig. 3.11). The new settlement at El Calvario also was positioned within 1 km of the most direct travel route into eastern Tlacolula from the east. The lack of settlements in the rest of the Albarradas area highlights the significance of this route. Pottery diagnostics at both sites continued to conform to the Valley of Oaxaca ceramic tradition, even if the pottery was likely locally made. The most diagnostic Early I ceramics at the two sites in Albarradas are gris (grayware) bowls that have very flaring or everted rims with fine incising on the exterior rim (Figs. 3.12 and 3.13; Table 3.7; types G-15, G-16, G-17; Caso et al., 1967, pp. 23-35; Kowalewski et al., 1978, p. 182; Blanton et al., 1982, pp. 377-378). These decorated graywares (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, p. 241) are found at sites across the Valley of Oaxaca but are most abundant near Monte Albán and the three closest valley subregions (Etla, northern Valle Grande, and western Tlacolula). The decorated ("fancy") gris comprise 50%-60% of the graywares that can be attributed to Early I in all valley subregions, but in Ejutla and Albarradas they comprise at least 70%. So, although the abundance of fancy gris falls off with distance from the center of the valley, where they likely were made (Kowalewski et al., 1989, p. 94; see also Mine et al., 2016, p. 36), they appear to have been desired by residents of Ejutla and Albarradas, possibly as a sign of their affiliation with the increasingly important city in the center of the Valley of Oaxaca. Given the variety of fine gris sherds in the Albarradas collections, it is likely that at least some were not made in the Albarradas area. Other distinctive Early I pottery varieties, however, were not found at either site; these include distinctive crema (creamware) pottery that was produced near Monte Albán (Feinman, 1980; Joyce et al., 2006; Sherman et al., 2011; Minc et al., 2016, p. 33). Cremas have a spottier distribution across the Valley of Oaxaca, often including locally made copies, what we call "false cremas ." We did recover some false Table 3.6.

Terrace Sites in Early I As populations grew throughout the region during Monte Albán Early I, a few new settlements were located on hilltops where houses were constructed on artificially flattened terraces.

Except for Monte Albán in the Central subarea of the valley, however, the other terrace sites housed only a small percentage of the region's population (Table 3.8). Although not quantified, terraced hilltop settlements are reported in mountainous areas west and north of the valley - in Peñoles and the Sierra Norte Fig. 3.13.

These patterns most likely reflect the attraction of residing in areas near Monte Albán that also provided some measure of defense, possibly from other outside groups. Settlement and Land Use in Early I Population in the Valley of Oaxaca remained far below regional capacities based on maize farming. Potential food supplies (contingent on available labor) easily surpassed the estimated regional population (Table 3.9; Fig. 3.15).

Based on available labor and arable land, the large rural (non-Monte Albán) labor force in the Central subarea would have been able to grow approximately double the food they needed for their own families; the rest of their crops would have fed about one-third of Monte Alban's population of 5,000. Agricultural surpluses were even higher in Etla and northern Valle Grande; potential surpluses from those adjacent subareas would have been more than sufficient to feed the rest of Monte Albán's inhabitants. The necessity of importing foodstuffs from nearby areas was one key in the greater integration of the central part of the valley into the polity centered at Monte Albán. Because governance and the population of Monte Albán were depen- dent on this agrarian production, the city likely had to supply certain public goods and services (e.g., defense and ceremonial activities) to the surrounding populations. At greater distances from Monte Albán, where populations were smaller, potential agricultural surpluses were much lower, especially in southern Valle Grande, eastern Tlacolula, and Ejutla. They continued to be negligible in Albarradas and Sola.

Monte Albán Late I During Monte Albán Late I, Monte Albán tripled in size to approximately 17,000 people, monumental construction on the Main Plaza accelerated, and the urban capital expanded its political influence (Blanton, 1978, pp. 44, 46; Blanton et al., 1993, pp. 77-79). The city became one of the largest, if not the largest, urban center in highland Mesoamerica (C. A. Smith, 2002, p. 46). The greatest population increases and expansion of site hierarchies in the Valley of Oaxaca occurred in the same areas that had experienced the most significant growth in Early I (the Central and adjacent subareas - Etla, northern Valle Grande, and western Tlacolula), which formed the core area of the Monte Albán political system (Fig. 3.17).

The populations at the inner-ring settlements that lacked formal architecture likely were interdependent with Monte Albán. They may have had access to civic-ceremonial activities at the capital in return for labor or tax compliance. These sectors of the valley likely had the most active communication and interaction with the regional capital. The outer ring included Tilcajete in the Valle Grande and Yegüih in Tlacolula, both of which expanded in size between Early I and Late I. Evidence of burning and building destruction at Tilcajete points to antagonism between Tilcajete (in northern Valle Grande) and Monte Albán (Spencer, 2003; FEINMAN AND NICHOLAS: SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN ALBARRADAS, OAXACA, MEXICO 39</page><page sequence="47">- 1 0.2 i 31.2 ' Monte Albán Late I I 2 ' 1 ?

Less work has been carried out at Yegüih, but based on later changes at that site (Feinman et al., 2016), we also suspect that it at least occasionally had adversarial relations with Monte Albán. Based on ceramic distributions and architectural canons, however, both sites were culturally part of the larger Monte Albán system, and interactions between these centers may not have been solely acrimonious. Population densities in outlying valley areas beyond Tilcajete in the Valle Grande and Yegüih in Tlacolula continued to be much lower and settlement hierarchies flatter relative to areas closer to the core of the Monte Albán polity (Fig. 3.18). Nevertheless, these valley edges distant from Monte Albán did experience significant growth between Early I and Late I. In fact, population growth rates between Early I and Late I were higher near the edges of the valley, in southern Valle Grande and eastern Tlacolula, than they were closer to the center of the valley (Feinman et al., 1985, p. 346). Still, the estimated populations at these edges remained lower than closer to the capital. The demographic growth at the edges may reflect households that could make a living through exchanges or other interactions with areas closer to the region's center but that were insulated by distance from more predatory relations with the rapidly growing capital. Even if Monte Albán did not politically dominate or unify the entire Valley of Oaxaca (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, p. 62), the effects of Monte Albán's increasing power and influence were felt across the region, drawing people into the valley from areas beyond its physiographic boundaries.

Beyond the Valley of Oaxaca, population and settlement trends were more variable. In all adjacent areas, there are ceramic affinities with the Valley of Oaxaca, which would seem to indicate cultural affiliations and some degree of interaction with the denser Valley of Oaxaca populace. Although no two exterior regions followed precisely the same pattern of demographic change, growth occurred across most of these areas. The number of sites and population densities increased dramatically in both the Albarradas area and the Sola Valley (Table 3.10). Because populations were so low in Early I, rates of population growth were very high in both areas, yet they also were high in Ejutla, Sola's neighbor, and the rest of the Valley of Oaxaca, so at least part of the growth must have resulted from in-migration from outside the valley system (Feinman et al., 1985, p. 346; Balkánsky, 2002, p. 37; Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, p. 65), even beyond Miahuatlán, which experienced growth in sites and populations similar to Sola (Markman, 1981, p. 63, table 2-1). People who previously lived in surrounding mountains and smaller valleys may have opted to migrate to the central valleys because of emergent regional exchange networks that lessened agricultural risk in a region with elevated seasonal and annual rainfall fluctuations (e.g., A. V. Kirkby, 1973; Flannery, 1983a; Nicholas, 1989). At the same time, the increasing agglomeration of population in larger centers facilitated and fostered the specialized production of utilitarian ceramic pots (Feinman, 1986b) and other utilitarian goods for exchange. The availability of such goods in regional exchange networks also may have encouraged domestic participation even in areas distant from the largest centers. These networks included the more distant Mixteca Alta, where gray ware ceramics that were produced in the Valley of Oaxaca have been found (Joyce et al., 2006, p. 586; Pérez Rodriguez et al., 2017, p. 589). This era was the beginning of what has been termed a "regional goods transformation" (Blanton et al., 2005, p. 274), when "the intertwined processes of political and domestic restructuring . . . incorporated a vast number of ordinary households as both surplus producers and benefactors of growing political and economic systems expressed as state formation and regional market evolution" (e.g., Blanton et al., 1999, chapter 4). 40 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="48">ļ 1 47 ļ 71 ' Monte Albán Late I / 47? k(48) _S 43 M&gt;J45 i 59 I 52 Ji P" 35 /^r~¿ / Average site population r si /? 59 ' / (exclude MA) Fig. 3.19. Average site population in the Valley of Oaxaca and neighboring areas during Monte Albán Late I. Despite a high rate of growth, population density in the Sola Valley remained lower than anywhere else in the Valley of Oaxaca, while population densities in the Albarradas area matched those in the central parts of the valley (excluding Monte Albán) and were much higher than in adjacent eastern Tlacolula or in the Ejutla Valley at the southern end of the valley. There were dozens of new sites in Peñoles, but all were very small, and population densities continued to be very low there (Kowalewski, 1991). In contrast, the Sierra Norte, one of the two exterior regions closest to Monte Albán, is the only area that lost population during the transition from Early I to Late I (Drennan, 1989, p. 376). Nevertheless, populations doubled in the more distant Mixteca Alta (Kowalewski et al., 2009, pp. 299-301). Monte Albán capped a multi tiered settlement hierarchy in the Valley of Oaxaca (Kowalewski et al., 1989, pp. 129-131). This hierarchy of settlements, based on population or the scale of monumental architectural construction, was present even if the spatial focus was limited to those parts of the valley closest and likely most connected to Monte Albán - the Central area, Etla, and northern Valle Grande (Kowalewski et al., 1989, pp. 127- 138). Settlement hierarchies were flatter in all the edge areas, including Albarradas. Half the sites in Albarradas were in the range of several hundred people (180-440), with no one clearly dominant center. All other sites were very small. In all the other edge areas, there were many more small sites and few settlements with estimated populations of more than 100 people. With so few very small sites in Albarradas, the average site size in Albarradas was two to three times larger than for any other edge area or subarea (excluding Monte Albán) of the Valley of Oaxaca (Fig. 3.19). Sola was very similar to its neighbor, Ejutla, while Albarradas was very different from its neighbor, eastern Tlacolula. Why is Albarradas so different in Late I from the rest of the region? A possible explanation is that aggregation provided a degree of safety in numbers for people living near an important trade route in a frontier area close to the boundary between two linguistic groups. Given the more recent history of hostilities between the Valley Zapotee and the Mixe to the east (Schmieder, 1930; S. M. King, 2012), the settlements in Albarradas may have been prone to village-on- village raiding, a practice that continued in the Central Valleys of Oaxaca into the 20th century (e.g., Dennis, 1987). The continuation of ceramics in the Mixe area with characteristics typical of Late I pottery in the Valley of Oaxaca (Hutson, 2014, p. 268) seems to indicate that interaction across this boundary did not cease. In fact, people may have been drawn to the eastern slopes of Cerro Guirone, possibly to be closer to an ' important travel route. The flow of lowland coastal goods to the Valley of Oaxaca likely followed riverine transport routes from distant large communities, such as Laguna Zope on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (R. N. Zeitlin, 1993, p. 87). Late I Settlements in Albarradas The Albarradas area underwent a major settlement transition during Monte Albán Late I (350-200 BC). Not only did this area, like Ejutla at the southern end of the Valley of Oaxaca (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 1990, 2013), experience significant demographic growth, expanding from only two settlements to 12 (Table 3.11), but the physical nature of the sites and their locations shifted dramatically as well (Fig. 3.20). TL-SLA-SLA- 52, the earlier settlement in the low, humid fields adjacent to the Hormiga Colorada, was abandoned. At the same time, the small site at El Calvario (TL-SLA-SLA-8), located on top of a low but steep-sided hill (Fig. 3.21), grew significantly and became the largest settlement not only in the Albarradas area but also in the larger region including eastern Tlacolula (Fig. 3.22). The Late I occupation at the site (LI- 1 1) expanded to 7.8 ha, with more than 400 people residing on 51 small residential terraces (Fig. 3.23). The terraces enclose an architectural complex that contains one large open plaza, with one small structure on either end, adjacent to a much smaller plaza enclosed on three sides by small structures. Eight additional, new communities were settled in the eastern part of the area, all within several kilometers of the Hormiga Colorada. The most common Late I ceramics on all of the sites are typical Valley of Oaxaca graywares, especially G-12 bowl rims incised with one or two parallel lines (Caso et al., 1967, pp. 25-26, figure 4; Kowalewski et al., 1978, p. 179) and bowl bases with combed bottoms (Caso et al., 1967, pp. 25-26, figure 5; Kowalewski et al., 1978, p. 181) (Fig. 3.24; Table 3.12). A few sherds of C-2 and C-4 crema paste with red paint (Kowalewski et al., 1978, pp. 171, 174) were present but rare; other nondiagnostic crema sherds could pertain to either Late I or II. Café jars and bowls with red paint, especially K-3 (Kowalewski et al., 1978, pp. 189-190), were present in low quantities at several sites. Although all show Monte Alban influence, most of the ceramics likely were made locally. Pottery in Chichicapan, just south of the Tlacolula Valley, also shows Monte Albán influence at this time; the presence of kilnwasters of typical Monte Albán I and II graywares at one site indicates that at least some of the graywares were locally made (Fahmel Beyer, 2012).

Steep terraced slope of El Calvario (TL-SLA-SLA-8), viewed from the north. Most of the new communities in Albarradas were situated on top of défendable promontories overlooking large barrancas that carry seasonal water draining from mountain ridges. Today, many of these barrancas are tapped to supply water to fields near these ancient sites. Like El Calvario, four of the new sites had compact settlement arrangements composed of 10-30 residential terraces enclosing small architectural complexes on the top of a hill. These complexes consisted of either one small plaza with small structures on one side (TL-SLA-SLA-41; Figs. 3.25 and 3.26) or three sides (TL-SLA-SLA-20, TL-SLA-SLA- 22; Figs. 3.27-3.29) or one large open plaza with one small structure on either end (TL-SLA-SLA-27; Figs. 3.30 and 3.31). The terraces on these sites were arranged on eastern or southern slopes (facing away from the Valley of Oaxaca toward the Hormiga Colorada). Terraces on the eastern side of these settlements often were constructed right to the edge of the steep downward slopes. At Cerro del Rio (TL-SLA-SLA-27), located just above a sharp bend in the Hormiga Colorada, the stone retaining wall of the lowest terrace was particularly high and substantial, serving as a kind of fortification. In contrast, the parts of these sites that faced back to the Valley of Oaxaca were generally left unprotected. Access from the valley side was always easier (less steep) and more direct. Two of the new settlements were established on high promontories in the southern part of the survey area, one on each side of the Hormiga Colorada. We mapped several residential terraces at these two sites that appear to have been constructed in Late I, but in each case modern use or steep, heavily vegetated slopes prevented us from mapping and estimating the total number of terraces, and their populations could be higher than our estimates. One of these sites is Hierve el Agua (TL-SLA-SLA-24; see Fig. 2.22), where the Late I (LI- 5) occupation was centered on the steepest, most défendable ridge above the natural springs. There is one preserved mound on the ridgetop that may have been constructed as early as Late I. The other site is Llego Yiachi (TL-SLA-SLA-53), where the Late I occupation (LI- 10) was concentrated on the top and upper slopes of the rock feature (see Fig. 2.26). The architectural complex on top of this large outcrop comprises Fig. 3.22. Monte Albán Late I settlements in Tlacolula and the Albarradas area, showing principal places mentioned in the text.

Although one building has preserved adobe walls like the Monte Albán V palaces at Mitla (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2004a, figure 3.4), one or more of the other small complexes may have been built as early as Late I. Both sites had unobstructed views of the surrounding area and of each other. Two other new Late I settlements in the east were small isolated residences that did not continue into Monte Albán II.

The final Late I site (LI- 13) in the surveyed area is the first occupation of the Guirún site (TL-SLA-SLA-17) in eastern Tlacolula. This initial settlement on an upper ridgeline on the Fig. 3.27.

It is located at the juncture of the 1980 and 1995 survey regions and was not detected until the intensive site survey in 1996 (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013), when we observed a Late I K-3 (T2042) bowl fragment and a G-12 (T 1 24 1 ) bowl rim on two adjacent terraces (Kowalewski et al., 1978, pp. 179, 189). Eight of the 12 sites in the Albarradas area are fairly comparable in size, ranging from several hectares to slightly more than 13 ha. These sites are on défendable hilltops and have one or more small architectural complexes on their summits, with terraced slopes below. Most have estimated populations of several hundred people. There were only four sites without public architecture and residential terraces; those four were very small isolated residences or hamlets with populations of 12 or less. The four small sites were widely dispersed, while all but one of the larger, défendable villages were roughly evenly spaced (roughly 1 .5-3 km apart), forming a band outside the eastern limits of the Valley of Oaxaca. Collectively, these sites could have monitored all of the natural trails and topographic breaks that pass through the high mountains at the eastern edge of the Valley of Oaxaca. The discovery of so many relatively large sites dating to Monte Albán Late I in the Albarradas area certainly was not expected. Few Late I sites of any size were recorded at the eastern edge of the Tlacolula arm of the Valley of Oaxaca during the 1980 survey (Kowalewski et al., 1989, maps 2 and 3). The pre-Hispanic settlement at spectacular Hierve el Agua had long been considered an anomalous Late I outlier, positioned to take advantage of the natural spring (see Fig. 2.21). The Albarradas survey provided the larger context to see that Hierve el Agua (TL-SLA-SLA-24) was not so anomalous; it was part a line of terrace sites positioned on défendable promon- tories above the Hormiga Colorada during Monte Albán Late I. This line of defensively located sites would appear to define a defended frontier just beyond the physiographic edge of the Valley of Oaxaca. But given the distance of these sites to Monte Albán and the low population densities and lack of monumen- tal architecture or a clear hierarchy of settlement in the eastern part of Tlacolula, we do not believe that this line of sites forms an eastern political boundary of Monte Albán's political system, as we postulated in earlier publications (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 1996, 1999).

Many of these sites could have served as gateways or stopover points on exchange routes as well as having defensive functions. Marine shell was not a common good on most sites in the Albarradas area and was recorded at only four sites with Late I pottery (El Calvario, TL-SLA-SLA-20, TL-SLA-SLA-22, and El Trigo). None are single component (most of the shell also could pertain to Monte Alban II); the association with Late I is least clear at El Trigo, which was occupied continuously from Monte Albán Late I through V; the other three sites are close to the most direct travel route into the valley. Nearness to the travel route could have increased access to goods both from afar and from the valley. Residents of several of these sites also may have made basic goods for exchange. We observed evidence of chert working at a high percentage of Late I sites (7 out of 12) in the Albarradas area. Two of these sites are in the small northern valley (TL-MIT-CC-7 and TL-MIT-CC-8), and five are terrace sites in the east near the travel route (El Calvario, TL-SLA-SLA-41, TL-SLA-SLA-20, TL-SLA-SLA- 22, and TL-SLA-SLA-27). In six cases, though, the sites are multicomponent, and the craftwork also could pertain to Monte Albán II. Only at TL-SLA-SLA-27 is the working of chert (and also ground stone) more definitively associated with the Late I occupation. Residents of El Calvario and TL-SLA- SLA-20, respectively, also may have made ground stone tools and lapidary items based on the surface remains observed. The ceramics collected at these sites share close stylistic affiliations with Monte Albán and the Valley of Oaxaca, especially G-12 gray wares (see Fig. 3.24), so clearly populations in the Albarradas area engaged in some level of interaction and exchange with communities in the valley, yet the crema ceramics that are identified with Monte Albán were extremely rare in Albarradas. These settlements may have been partially aligned with the Monte Albán polity in the same way that Ejutla was at this time (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, p. 76). Neither area was directly controlled or politically well integrated into the Monte Albán polity but may have had access to and used ceramic goods that signaled affiliations with the Valley of Oaxaca and the Monte Albán polity (Feinman, 2018). The Late I sites in Albarradas seemingly were part of Monte Albán's outer circle of influence, but they had a different relationship with the center than did sites closer to the urban capital. In terms of access to services at (and obligations to) the capital, the Albarradas sites were much less interconnected to Monte Albán. 48 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="56">Fig. 3.30.

The settlement changes in the Albarradas area seem to have been the result of expanding exchange connections and population movements rather than the consequence of persis- tent political interventions. The travel route along the Tehuantepec River to the Isthmus, from where a wide array of coastal products were available (R. N. Zeitlin, 1993, p. 87), passes through the Albarradas area and likely made it an attractive, albeit somewhat risky, place to settle. Since many of the larger Albarradas settlements continued to be occupied in Monte Albán II, it is possible that these communities were settled very late in Monte Albán I as the leaders at the capital began to explore new revenue sources by establishing extra- regional links to tropical products and pursuing military forays into more distant realms (e.g., Marcus, 1976). Late I Terrace and Defensive Sites Monte Albán grew much larger, and a number of other terrace sites were established across the region. The formation of these hilltop sites likely was motivated primarily by defensive concerns, as the inhabitants tried to protect themselves from potential raids or attacks from neighbors from both inside and outside the valley (e.g., Roscoe, 1996). Cooperation and a commitment to collective action to provide for community defense is the most effective way to deal with these security concerns (Roscoe, 2013; DeMarrais, 2016). The construction of the artificially flattened terraces behind shared stone retaining walls at these hilltop sites also required significant labor and multihousehold cooperation and organization (Feinman et al., 2002, pp. 271-272; Kowalewski et al., 2006, p. 207). Although terrace sites were widely dispersed in the Valley of Oaxaca, the densest concentration in Monte Albán Late I was in the northern, Etla arm. Except for Monte Albán, they were not significant features of the valleywide landscape. There were ^ IT-CC-8^^ ' ' ''. Oes ' ' ' ' ^ ' ' ' V N ' ' mmm Fig. 3.33.

Monte Alban Late I terrace sites in the Central Valleys of Oaxaca. no terrace sites yet in the Ejutla Valley. In contrast, fortified hill towns were established in many neighboring areas, including at some distance in the Mixteca Alta and Cuicatlán Cañada, likely as a response to military concerns as Monte Albán grew and attempted to expand its reach (Kowalewski et al., 2006). The first terrace sites in the Albarradas and Sola regions were established at this time (Fig. 3.34; Table 3.13). A marked change in Albarradas in Late I was the establishment of many small terrace sites (8 of the 12 Late I sites have ancient residential terraces) in défendable locations, including isolated promontories. The terrace sites in Albarradas were clustered in a band on the eastern, lower slopes of Cerro Guirone above the FEINMAN AND NICHOLAS: SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN ALBARRADAS, OAXACA, MEXICO 51</page><page sequence="59">Table 3.13.

Most of them were in line of sight of each other; their proximity to each other, or safety in numbers, may have been an important factor. These compact settlements accounted for 98% of the population in the Albarradas area. In the Sola Valley, 8 of 19 Late I settlements are terrace sites, accounting for 84% of the population (Balkansky, 2002), but the terrace sites there were more dispersed across a larger area than in Albarradas. These two exterior areas alone had almost as many terrace sites as in all of the Valley of Oaxaca (where there were as many as 18). Even including Monte Albán, the percentage of the population residing in terrace sites in the Central subarea was lower (77%). In eastern Tlacolula, 46% of the population lived in terrace sites. In mountainous Peñoles and Sierra Norte, there are no large valleys and very little flat land (except on ridgetops), and many if not most sites throughout the sequence consisted of artificially flattened terraces constructed on hillslopes. In the Peñoles area, many Late Formative sites were defensively located, including a string of single-phase Late Formative sites (with Monte Albán- style ceramics) situated on a ridge overlooking the adjacent Nochixtlán Valley to the north (Kowalewski, 1991), apparently defining a settlement boundary similar to that in the Albarradas area. Yet site layouts and the total number of terraces occupied in Peñoles in Late I are unknown due to larger, later Table 3.14.

Similar patterns are reported in the Cañada de Cuitcatlán to the north (Spencer, 1982, 2007; Redmond, 1983; Redmond &amp; Spencer, 2006), although the défendable sites are not as clustered as in the Albarradas area. There were no similar lines of défendable sites in Ejutla (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 1990, 2013) or at the southern physiographic edge of the Valley of Oaxaca. If the Miahuatlán Valley were to be more fully studied, such sites should be searched for along its southern extent. The populations of the different edge areas of the Valley of Oaxaca responded differently to potential outside threats, influences, and oppor- tunities. Settlement and Land Use in Late I In spite of growing populations, regional capacities based on maize farming continued to far surpass the population in the Valley of Oaxaca, and potential food supplies (based on available labor) easily surpassed the regional population. All subareas were self-sufficient except for the Central sector, where Monte Alban was located (Table 3.14; Fig. 3.35). Based on available labor and arable land, the large rural labor force in the Central area would have been able to grow more than twice the amount of food they needed for their own families; the rest of their crops would have fed about 40% of Monte Alban's population of 17,242. Surpluses were even higher in Etla and northern Valle Grande; potential agricultural surpluses from those adjacent subregions would have been more than sufficient in most years to feed the rest of Monte Albán's inhabitants (Fig. 3.36). Monte Albán likely appropriated agricultural surplus and labor in these areas to support governance that in return provided public goods, such as ceremonial spaces, temples, and defensive features (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2017, p. 270); these public goods helped draw people to settle near the capital. Most of the other valley subregions could have produced about double what they needed. The lowest surpluses were in eastern 52 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="60">1 1 0 70CM Monte Albán Late I Vl0,20ÕjX^v S I L~J,ooo 3,700 S 9,000 1,40(Ti^J P" 3,400 ^_r-4 - Surplus rounded to il 3 , 500 ¿v nearest 1 00 ^1,300 Si il Fig. 3.36.

These subareas still were not strongly connected into the political system centered on Monte Albán, and with sufficient crops closer to home, Monte Albán's rulers likely did not engage these areas for staple products. Any interest in Albarradas more likely focused on trade routes that passed through that area, bringing coastal goods up to the highlands. Middle and Late Formative Summary The Albarradas area, like other edge areas, was settled late compared to the Valley of Oaxaca and was only sparsely occupied until the Late Formative period (Monte Albán Late I). The earliest settlements were situated near the principal eastern trade route (the Camino Real) into the Valley of Oaxaca. Although these small frontier settlements were outside the physiographic limits of the Valley of Oaxaca and near the modern Mixe/Zapotec boundary, the ceramic assemblages at the Albarradas sites mostly comprise typical Valley of Oaxaca pottery and indicate high degrees of connectivity with valley populations. During Monte Albán Late I, the Albarradas area experienced rapid growth, especially in défendable locations where agricul- tural needs also could be met. The Albarradas area stood out from not only the other edge areas but also most Valley of Oaxaca subregions in having high population density, the largest average site size, the greatest nucleation of population in the fewest sites, and the highest percentage of the population in défendable terrace sites. These all represent major changes from Early I. Although our knowledge of the pre-Hispanic history of the Mixe area is limited, we suspect that these changes reflect a defensive posture by people who were weakly integrated with the complex political system in the Valley of Oaxaca. The residents of the Albarradas area participated in the Valley of Oaxaca economic and interactive sphere - they clearly followed the same ceramic tradition and architectural canons - but they do not seem to have been strongly tied into the Monte Albán polity (compared with areas closer to the capital) any more than eastern Tlacolula and Ejutla were at that time. With Monte Albán becoming the largest known political center in the Mesoamerican highlands and the expansion of the Monte Albán polity in Late I, there may have been more traffic/ tension/interaction along the trade route through Albarradas. The people of Albarradas may have been protecting themselves from peoples to the east but also from the valley. Albarradas shares some similarities with the Sola Valley, which also had relatively high average site size and a high percentage of the population in défendable terrace sites, but population densities were much lower in Sola than in Albarradas. The most important trade routes into the Valley of Oaxaca from the south pass through the Ejutla Valley (White &amp; Barber, 2012) and Miahuatlán (Ball &amp; Brockington, 1978, p. 114), not Sola, yet we do not see similar changes in Ejutla. Sola also was part of the same ceramic tradition, but that distant region was probably even less tied in than Ejutla and Albarradas were (cf. Balkánsky, 2002, p. 45). Settlement in Sola also had a much more defensive character than in Ejutla and Miahuatlán, where Markman (1981, p. 63) recorded only one Late I hilltop site. Many edge areas may have been dangerous places to live during Late I, when Monte Albán was attempting to expand its influence and hegemony. The spread of ceramics of the Valley of Oaxaca tradition beyond the physiographic bounds of the valley in Monte Alban I is not an indication of the extent of Monte Albán's political control; rather, it is evidence of the urban center's influence/ participation in interaction networks that varied across space (e.g., Emberling, 1997, p. 297). At the same time, lack of or lower amounts of specific ceramic types between neighbors should not be seen as a simple reflection of firm political boundaries (cf. Spencer et al., 2008, pp. 335-336). Even secondary centers in the Valley of Oaxaca, especially those at some remove from the urban capital, may have at times actively resisted incorporation into the Monte Albán state at the same time that they interacted with the urban capital and other neighboring communities closer to Monte Albán. Their relationships with the capital also may have been fluid (at times antagonistic), and they may not have been fully integrated into the Monte Albán polity until the end of Late I (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, p. 64). As noted, even into the 20th century, raiding occurred between communities within the bounds of the Valley of Oaxaca (e.g., Dennis, 1987). Across highland Oaxaca, there were networks of interaction and influence that decreased with distance from first San José Mogote and then Monte Albán. At that point in the historical sequence (and through Monte Albán II), these connectivities mostly were directed south from the Valley of Oaxaca (as Bernal [1965] noted years ago based on stylistic criteria). More recently, studies of sourced obsidian illustrate widespread exchange and interaction across western Mesoamerica at this time (Feinman et al., 2015; Golitko &amp; Feinman, 2015), and from the Central Valley of Oaxaca, the strongest ties to other regions to the south and east likely ran along the Pacific Coast. Such passages likely included the travel route between the Valley of Oaxaca and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec that passes through Albarradas. FEINMAN AND NICHOLAS: SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN ALBARRADAS, OAXACA, MEXICO 53</page><page sequence="61">Chapter 4: Terminal Formative (Monte Alban II) "[F]or reasons having no connection with science, Mesoamerican archaeology was centered for decades on the exploration of two areas, the Maya region and the Valley of Mexico. . . . One of the greatest contributions Oaxaca studies can make will be the abandonment of the delusion that one can utter generalizations about Mesoamerica on the basis of those two areas alone." (Paddock, 1983a, p. 209) A general trend across highland Mesoamerica during the Terminal Formative period (ca. 200 BC-AD 200) was increasing primacy and demographic nucleation as populations in many regions became more concentrated in that region's largest settlement. In central Mexico, Teotihuacan exemplifies this trend, growing rapidly through in-migration from other parts of the Basin of Mexico to become the dominant center in the region (Cowgill, 1979, p. 55, 1992, p. 95, 2004, p. 533, 2015, p. 61; Sanders et al., 1979, p. 99; Milion, 1981, p. 221; Nichols, 2016, pp. 23-24) and in all of highland Mesoamerica. Teotihuacan and the regional capitals of other expansive states extended their domains (Hirth, 1978, p. 323; Cowgill, 1992, p. 96), often transforming poorly integrated frontiers into politically and economically dependent peripheries. These large polities were competitive. At the same time, regional population trends were more variable than they had been during the Late Formative. In some regions, including the Valley of Oaxaca, populations declined or were relatively stable. During the transition to Monte Albán II, the overall decline in the regional population of the Valley of Oaxaca was accompanied by a similar decline at the capital and the immediately adjacent area (Table 4.1; Kowalewski et al., 1989, pp. 159, 184). Yet even as Monte Alban was eventually dwarfed in size by Teotihuacan, it still remained the largest and most architecturally elaborate center not only in the Valley of Oaxaca but also in the Southern Highlands (Blanton et al., 1993, pp. 84, 123). New forms of public buildings were constructed at the capital (Marcus, 2009), and new constructions restricted access to the Main Plaza, which would have limited the spaces that had operated as a public good, an opportunity for a large segment of the city's populace to participate in civic-ceremonial activities (Joyce &amp; Barber, 2016, pp. 54-55). Elite residences were built on the North Platform at Monte Albán and in the site's Main Plaza (Winter, 2001). At the same time, the city's leaders began an era of expansionism that extended Monte Albán's reach beyond the physiographic bounds of the Valley of Oaxaca (Marcus, 1976, 1980, 1983a, 1992b; Blanton et al., 1993, pp. 82-84; Marcus &amp; Flannery, 1996, pp. 195-198; Feinman, 2007, p. 9). Although our perspective on this era does include Monte Albán militarism and resource extraction toward targeted areas, distant from the capital, we do not necessarily think that the Valley of Oaxaca center established territorial control or direct administration in these outlying areas far from Monte Albán. Two areas beyond the valley and its immediate neighbors were affected: the Mixteca Alta, northwest of the Valley of Oaxaca, and the Cañada de Cuitcatlán to the north (see Fig. 2.1). Settlement patterns in the Mixteca Alta shifted markedly, impacted by both Monte Albán and Teotihuacan, even though neither city held control over the area. Populations declined in much of the Mixteca Alta, and some small valleys were abandoned at the same time that population became more concentrated in just a few valleys, with settlement nucleation around a few large centers (Spores, 1972; Byland, 1980; Plunket, 1983; Balkansky et al., 2004; Kowalewski et al., 2009, p. 299). The largest population was at Huamelulpan (Balkansky, 1998a; C. A. Smith, 2002, p. 155; Kowalewski et al., 2009, p. 304), a valley that did not have prior significant settlement. The presence of Zapotee writing at Huamelulpan (Marcus, 1983c) evidences greater Monte Albán influence in the Mixteca Alta during the Terminal Formative at the same time that increasing demographic nucleation may have been a defensive strategy to counter the growing threat of Teotihuacan from the north and the expanding imperialism of Monte Albán from the south. Similar changes occurred in Cuicatlán, including a major break with earlier settlement patterns, as population concen- trated at a few large sites that were both architecturally more elaborate and often highly fortified (Spencer, 1982; Redmond, 1983; Spencer &amp; Redmond, 1997, 2001). Spencer and Redmond have interpreted these changes as conquest of Cuicatlán by Monte Albán and the expansion of that city's territorial domain (Spencer, 1982; Redmond, 1983; Spencer &amp; Redmond, 2006). Yet it is not clear that Monte Albán's rulers had the administrative power to accomplish that feat (Carter, 2017, p. 446). Instead, through expansion of interactive networks, or conquest, the goal of Monte Albán's rulers was more extractive: to secure tribute and war booty and to solidify favorable ties to local elite. Ceramic distributions provide additional evidence of Monte Albán's expanded interactive reach. During Monte Albán Late I, crema pottery, mostly made near Monte Alban, was relatively Table 4.1.

Most Monte Albán II crema vessels (mostly bowls) were more highly decorated than earlier cremas , often painted in two colors with large bulbous hollow supports. They also were more varied in decoration (painting and design elements), including various kinds of postfiring scratching on painted vessel exteriors (e.g., Caso et al., 1967; Feinman, 1985, pp. 209-212). Monte Albán II cremas also make up a smaller part of the overall ceramic complex as compared to Monte Albán I cremas. In general, the earlier cremas were more utilitarian in use, including many jar forms, while the latter were more typically utilized in serving, feasts, and other status-related activities (Kowalewski et al., 1989, pp. 180-182; Elson, 2007, pp. 61-66; Elson &amp; Sherman, 2007). One locality for the production of these elaborate Monte Albán II cremas was on the North Platform of Monte Albán (Martínez López &amp; Markens, 2004, p. 80; Markens &amp; Martínez López, 2009), where the most elaborate high-status residences were situated at that time (Joyce, 2010, pp. 144, 157). Crema ceramics also increased in abundance in Monte Albán II contexts in the Ejutla Valley - especially at the region's largest settlements, indicating increased interaction along elite channels with Monte Albán and the valley's center (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 1990, pp. 231-232, 2013, pp. 85-86) - and in the Albarradas area. Balkansky (2002, p. 46) noted similar patterns in the Sola Valley. Select cremas are present 100 km away in the Canada de Cuicatlán (Redmond &amp; Spencer, 2006; Spencer, 2007) and the Mixteca Alta (Joyce, 2014, p. 124). Although rare, cremas also have been found in the Rio Verde area on the Pacific Coast south of the Valley of Oaxaca (Workinger, 2002, p. 355; Workinger &amp; Joyce, 2009, p. 21; Carter, 2017). There also may have been stronger connections (than in earlier times) with the southern Isthmus of Tehuantepec; Monte Albán II is the only time when Valley of Oaxaca gray wares were common on the Pacific Coast (southern Isthmus) of Oaxaca (J. F. Zeitlin, 1978, p. 92; Feinman, 2018). During the Terminal Formative, the southern Isthmus was an important node in the exchange of coastal products to the Valley of Oaxaca (R. N. Zeitlin, 1993, p. 87). The most direct route from the southern Isthmus to the Valley of Oaxaca passed through Albarradas. Network analysis of obsidian distributions supports this interpretation. The southern Isthmus (Laguna Zope) was a hub of exchange between eastern and western Mesoamerica (Golitko &amp; Feinman, 2015, figures 5 and 6; Feinman et al., 2015; see also R. N. Zeitlin, 1993, p. 87). As Teotihuacan grew in influence and importance, the trade connections between Oaxaca and the Pacific Coast extended north to the central Mexican city. Based on our obsidian- sourcing studies in Oaxaca using p-XRF, the most common source of obsidian in the Valley of Oaxaca during the Late/ Terminal Formative was the Guadalupe Victoria mine in Puebla (Table 4.2; Feinman et al., 2017). The obsidian is not high quality, but it is readily available in large cobbles on the surface (Stocker &amp; Cobean, 1984, p. 84). At the same time, more than half of the obsidian assemblage at Monte Alban was from the Pachuca source near Teotihuacan. Recent chemical analyses of mica from excavated compounds at Teotihuacan have sourced the material to the Valley of Oaxaca, most likely from mines in the Ejutla Valley (Manzanilla et al., 2017). Mica was one good that was moving north to Teotihuacan from Oaxaca. The mica is heavily concentrated in two compounds at Teotihuacan that were associated with governing elites and is rare elsewhere, suggesting that mica was traded through elite networks (Manzanilla et al., 2017, p. 27), possibly in exchange for obsidian. As Monte Albán expanded its influence beyond the Valley of Oaxaca, the nature of its regional governance was shifting. Monte Albán's rulers appear to have changed focus more to external resources obtained through trade with distant places rather than internal resources, such as agricultural surplus from its immediate hinterland. This change in how governance and power was funded, with a greater reliance on external resources, was timed with a coincident shift from the more collective means of governance that had been in place throughout Monte Albán I toward a somewhat more exclusionary form of leadership (Fargher, 2016, p. 322; Joyce &amp; Barber, 2016, pp. 55-56). Intravalley factional competition also may have increased as different highly decorated ceramic wares (including the painted cremas) were distributed unevenly across different sectors of the valley (Feinman, 1985). Intraregional interaction lessened as the valley lost popula- tion and the remaining populace was more densely nucleated in a smaller number of larger settlements with large complexes of public architecture (Kowalewski et al., 1989, pp. 183-184; Blanton et al. 1993, p. 82). Nucleation was accompanied by a significant shift in settlement patterns (Fig. 4.1), especially in those areas closest to Monte Albán that had seen the greatest buildup during Monte Albán Late I: Central, Etla, and northern Valle Grande (Kowalewski et al., 1989, p. 159). Tlacolula is the only part of the valley where populations grew during the Terminal Formative. Even though most valley subareas saw significant growth during the later transition from Monte Albán II to IIIA, the later dominance of the Tlacolula arm of the valley may have had its beginning in Monte Albán II (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2005). This structural change in settlement nucleation has been associated with increasing competition between Monte Albán and local elites (Kowalewski et al., 1989, pp. 153, 193; Joyce, 2010, pp. 158-159) as well as between ruling groups at smaller centers. The defensive wall was built on the slopes of Monte 56 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="63">Fig. 4.1.

Variation has been noted in the nature and orientations of public architecture between different regional centers, including with Monte Albán (Sherman, 2005, pp. 278-281). Based on settlement and ceramic data, Ejutla and Sola - and even places as far away as Cuicatlán - were more interconnected to the Monte Albán system than ever before at the same time that there was an increase in the number of sites located in défendable positions in several of these areas. Greater concentrations of people in fewer sites could reflect two possible responses to Monte Albán's imperialism, both of which could lead to greater primacy in outlying regions. One mechanism is defensive to provide greater security, as we suggested for the FEINMAN AND NICHOLAS: SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN ALBARRADAS, OAXACA, MEXICO 57</page><page sequence="64">- 1 0.2 ļ 24.2 ' Monte Alban II / 1 o? ^ 69.3 |u Ui15.6) 12.9 lK-23.2 i 11.9 I 8.1 P" 5.7 C r Population f j^3 densities per km2 y1-, 4.2 (exclude MA) i 2.3 ļ~^ ^ Fig. 4.2.

The other is an attempt by Monte Albán's leaders to centralize political functions in one large site to more easily influence or exert degrees of control in more distant realms (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, p. 78). The Ejutla site, which had been one of a half dozen large communities in the Ejutla Valley in Monte Albán Late I, tripled in size, while most of the other sites lost population or even were abandoned. Monte Albán appears to have employed more exclusionary or network strategies to strengthen connec- tions with the elite of the Ejutla site, which could have been a conduit for exotic goods entering the valley from coastal areas to the south (e.g., marine shell) as well as local spot resources, such as mica. In Tlacolula, Yegüih lost population, while a new center at Dainzú, in a more densely settled area to the west, became the largest settlement in the Tlacolula arm of the valley (see Fig. 4.1). The public architecture constructed at Dainzú during Monte Albán II shares stylistic attributes with Monte Alban (Marcus &amp; Flannery, 1996, p. 189), but the presence of carved stones at Dainzú that are different from those at the capital in both style and subject matter (Marcus, 1983d, p. 113) would indicate that Tlacolula still retained a degree of political autonomy from Monte Albán, at least compared to the western parts of the valley. Many of the small valleys abutting the Valley of Oaxaca also experienced declining populations and increasing nucleation of population into a smaller number of larger settlements, but not all exterior areas were affected in the same way. The greatest population declines occurred at the southern edge of the valley in Ejutla and Sola (Balkansky, 2002, p. 45; Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, p. 79), where population densities and average site size were considerably lower than in Late I (Figs. 4.2 and 4.3). Those areas had the lowest continuity of settlement 150? ý i 99 ' Monte Albán II / 407 367^ -K. ' (84) ^ ^ 38 MTvl69 r 75 L 64 il y - Average site population V~76 ^ (exclude MA) Fig. 4.3.

The largest site in each area had significant public architecture. Although popu- lations did not decline and there was less settlement disconti- nuity in the Miahuatlán Valley, just south of the Ejutla Valley (Markman, 1981, p. 63), the largest and most monumental site there dominated its region (Markman, 1981, p. 22) just as the Ejutla site dominated the Ejutla Valley. Population densities also declined in the more central parts of the valley - Etla, Central, and the Valle Grande - but because the greatest nucleation of the population occurred in those subareas, average site population increased. The demographic declines in these valley sectors likely relates to the decreased emphasis on internal (agricultural) resources, which may have reduced the demands on domestic labor and precipitated slower rates of demographic growth. Diminished agrarian production and its impact on local exchange also may have lessened household economic activities, prompting some to "vote with their feet" and relocate. In the Sierra Norte, all three Late I sites were abandoned, and one new Monte Albán II site was established above one of the principal routes into the Valley of Oaxaca from the north (Drennan, 1989, pp. 376-378). Although larger than any of the earlier Monte Albán Late I sites that were abandoned, there was no substantial public architecture at this very dispersed settlement, so its role, if any, in travel along this route is unclear. Peñoles also may have lost population. In contrast, populations grew in Albarradas and the adjacent Tlacolula arm of the valley, where population densities and average site populations were larger than in Late I. There also was more settlement continuity in eastern Tlacolula and Albarradas, especially in défendable locations, compared to elsewhere in the region. 58 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="65">Fig. 4.4. Monte Alban II settlements in the Guirún/Albarradas survey region, showing sites mentioned in the text. Monte Albán II Settlements in Albarradas Settlement patterns in the Albarradas area did not change significantly between Monte Albán Late I and II (Fig. 4.4). In contrast to demographic decline across most of the region, the population increased by several hundred, similar to growth patterns in the adjacent Tlacolula arm of the valley (Kowa- lewski et al., 1989, p. 161). Nine of the 12 Late I sites in the Albarradas area continued to be occupied, including seven of the eight Late I terrace sites. Based on surface ceramic distributions, the population of four terrace sites in the eastern part of the Albarradas area (TL-SLA-SLA-8, TL-SLA-SLA-20, TL-SLA-SLA-22, and TL-SLA-SLA-41) and one terrace site in the northwestern part (TL-MIT-CC-8) remained stable between Monte Albán Late I and II (Table 4.3). Of the other two terrace sites, situated above the Hormiga Colorada in the southeastern part of the Albarradas area, one gained population (Tl-SLA- SLA-53), while the other one lost population (TL-SLA-SLA- 24). Although two of the three new settlements were very small, the third one quickly became the largest terrace site in the region (TL-MIT-CC-5; Figs. 4.5-4.7). Because there were so few small isolated residences (only two that continued from Late I and two new ones), average settlement size in the Albarradas area continued among the highest in the entire region. As in Monte Albán Late I, grayware pottery typical of the Valley of Oaxaca ceramic tradition was present on most sites, including G-12 bowls with carved parallel lines below the rim (Table 4.4; Caso et al., 1967, pp. 25-26, figure 4; Kowalewski et al., 1978, p. 179) and G-21 bowl bases with sloppy combing on the interior base (Kowalewski et al., 1978, p. 179). K-8 café vessels (Kowalewski et al., 1978, pp. 189-190) were present at several sites but otherwise not common. Unlike Late I, however, Monte Albán II cremas were much more abundant in Albarradas, especially red-painted C-7 and C-l 1 bowls (Caso et al., 1967, pp. 7, 68; Kowalewski et al., 1978, p. 170). Like in Ejutla in Monte Albán II, cremas were present almost exclusively at the largest sites in the area.

These are the same four sites where most of the marine shell was present (Fig. 4.9). One of the sites (TL- SLA-SLA-20) accounted for almost half of the shell and was one of two sites with the most cremas. Although many of the crema vessels likely were locally made copies, some of the crema pottery may have been made in the Valley of Oaxaca (Fig. 4.10 and Fig. 4.11, left). These distributional patterns likely are indicative of more direct networks between the elites of Albarradas and the center of the valley, which would be expected with a shift toward more exclusionary strategies by Monte Albán's leaders. The large Albarradas terrace sites may have become more direct conduits to the capital for exotic goods moving along the travel route from coastal areas, with fewer effects on other settlement in the area. As in Late I, they also may have produced some goods for exchange. At more than half of the Albarradas sites (7 out of 12), we found evidence of chert working, and at four of those sites there was Fig. 4.5.

Albarradas area (they are represented in 85% of ceramic collections that have Monte Albán II pottery). They are most abundant at two large hilltop terrace sites in the high mountain valley to the northwest (TL-MIT-CC-5 and TL-MIT-CC-8), where we suspect they were made (at both sites, almost 60% of the pottery in our collections are Black and Whites) (Figs. 4.15 and 4.16). This variety also is common (25%-40%) at two large terrace sites on the eastern slope of Cerro Guirone, both near the trade route that passes through the Albarradas area (TL- SLA-SLA-8 and TL-SLA-SLA-20) (see Fig. 4.8, left, and Fig. 4.11, right). Similar local copies of red-painted cremas were common in the Mixe collections analyzed by Hutson (2014, pp. 269-270). It appears that few true cremas - made near Monte Albán and the Etla arm of the valley - reached even eastern Tlacolula and that residents of eastern Tlacolula and/or the Albarradas area made local copies. Based on these distribu- tions, the residents of eastern Tlacolula may have had as much, Fig. 4.9. Marine shell ornaments from Loma de las Tumbas (TL- SLA-SLA-20). if not more, interaction with the Albarradas area than more central parts of the Valley of Oaxaca. The physiographic divide did not stifle interregional interaction. The Albarradas settlement pattern changed little between Monte Albán Late I and II, although there were slight shifts. As discussed in more detail in the previous chapter, the architec- tural complexes of the Late I terrace sites that continued to be occupied in Monte Albán II were centered on small plazas situated on the top of promontories that were surrounded by compact arrangements of terraces, whereas the Late I terrace site that was abandoned (TL-SLA-SLA-27) was the only terrace site with a large open plaza (see Fig. 3.31). The abandonment of this site could reflect a change in ritual practices from more open public spaces to more closed, restricted locales as political strategies shifted somewhat from more collective to more exclusionary (e.g., Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2016c). In addition, the three abandoned sites (two isolated residences and one terrace Fig. 4.10. White paste sherds with fine-line incising from TL- MIT-CC-5. 62 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="69">Fig. 4.11. Café (imitation crema) rims with red paint (left) and Black and White rims with red paint (right) from El Calvario (TL- SLA-SLA-8). site) were all near the eastern, potentially more vulnerable edge of the Albarradas area. In some respects, the defensive location of TL-SLA-SLA-27 on the tip of a long narrow piedmont ridge that extends into a sharp bend in the Hormiga Colorada may have made that site especially vulnerable to sieges. In contrast, two of the new sites, including the largest Monte Albán II terrace site (TL-MIT-CC-5), were located in the northwestern part of the Albarradas area, closer to the Valley of Oaxaca. TL- MIT-CC-5 was less defensively located on two flat ridgetops in the small mountain valley just beyond the pass into the northeastern part of the Tlacolula arm. There were at least 62 residential terraces at this site (some were too destroyed to be mapped), with a population estimate of almost 600 people. Even though this was the largest site in the Albarradas area, there was no central architectural complex as at the other terrace sites. Instead, several low platforms were dispersed across the site. The other new settlements in the surveyed area during Monte Albán II are small scatters of pottery on six terraces at the Guirún site (TL-SLA-SLA-2/17) on the western side of the mountain ridge in eastern Tlacolula (see Fig. 2.18). The terraces with Monte Albán II pottery are widely dispersed across the steep ridge systems at the juncture of the 1980 and 1995 survey regions and were not detected until the intensive site survey in 1996 (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2004a, p. 69). The best Monte Albán II ceramic diagnostics were red-painted A-9 bowls and one Black and White body sherd (Kowalewski et al., 1978, p. 192, 1989, p. 837). As in Monte Alban Late I, the Albarradas area continued to have a relatively flat site hierarchy in Monte Albán II. Five sites had populations of more than 180, with no one dominant center; most of the other sites were isolated residences or small hamlets of fewer than 50 people. There also was little change in settlement patterns in eastern Tlacolula between Monte Albán Late I and II (see Fig 4.14), where site hierarchies were less developed than elsewhere in the Valley of Oaxaca (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, p. 63). In contrast, changes in settlement patterns were much more significant at the southern end of the Valley of Oaxaca between Late I and II. Site hierarchies in the Ejutla and Sola Valleys also had been relatively flat in Late I, Fig. 4.12. Lapidary items (left) and worked chert (right) from Loma de las Tumbas (TL-SLA-SLA-20). like in eastern Tlacolula, which we interpreted as evidence that those areas were not yet strongly integrated into the Monte Albán polity (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, p. 76). By Monte Albán II, however, stronger site hierarchies with one dominant center had developed in the Ejutla and Sola Valleys (Balkansky, 2002, p. 45; Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, pp. 82-83); in Ejutla, there also was a clear tier of secondary centers. We think that Ejutla and Sola were beginning to be more politically incorporated into the Monte Albán polity in Monte Albán II, whereas eastern Tlacolula and the Albarradas area continued to be weakly integrated with the complex political system in the Valley of Oaxaca. The majority of the Albarradas area population continued to reside in terrace sites, forming a band outside the eastern limits of the Valley of Oaxaca, and collectively monitor all of the natural trails and topographic breaks that lead through the high mountains at the eastern edge of the Valley of Oaxaca. With the establishment of the new terrace site (TL-MIT-CC-5) in the northwestern part of the survey area, there was additional monitoring of the northeastern trade route into the Valley of Oaxaca. With a similar settlement pattern and undeveloped site hierarchy as in Monte Albán Late I, defensive/boundary matters continued to be significant concerns for the residents of the Albarradas area in Monte Albán II. Monte Albán II Terrace and Defensive Sites Although there were other significant changes in the Valley of Oaxaca between Monte Albán Late I and II, the number of terrace sites in the Valley of Oaxaca did not change significantly (Table 4.5; Fig. 4.17). Except for Monte Albán, these hilltop communities were not significant features on the landscape. Monte Alban was smaller than in Late I but continued to be, by far, the largest terrace site, with more than 14,000 inhabitants (Blanton, 1978, p. 44; Kowalewski et al., 1989, p. 184). Only in the Etla subvalley and adjacent area north of Monte Albán were there several terrace sites with populations between 1,000 and 2,000 people (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, table 7.4). Elsewhere in the valley, these hilltop settlements generally had populations in the lower hundreds.

There was a change, however, in the distribution of terrace sites away from the broad Valle Grande south of Monte Albán to the Tlacolula arm of the valley. The densest cluster of terrace sites was in eastern Tlacolula and the Albarradas area (which together account for half of the Monte Albán II terrace sites in the combined Valley of Oaxaca/ Albarradas area). Most of the Albarradas population (98%) continued to reside in hilltop terrace sites (eight sites), while the proportion residing in these hilltop settlements increased to almost 60% in eastern Tlacolula (six sites, counting the six dispersed terraces at the Guirún site as one settlement). Most of these sites are on the slopes, both east and west, of the high mountain ridge that defines the eastern edge of the Valley of Oaxaca. The hilltop centers are especially clustered on the eastern side and appear to collectively monitor travel routes into the eastern end of the Valley of Oaxaca. The eastern end of the Valley of Oaxaca still does not appear to have been as tightly integrated into the Valley of Oaxaca polity as the southern area (Ejutla) was by Fig. 4.14.

The close proximity of the easternmost sites to each other indicates that safety in numbers continued to be an important factor in their location. At the same time, the predominance of Valley of Oaxaca ceramics in the Albarradas area indicates that there was close interaction across this boundary and that the Monte Albán polity had influence through elite networks but not control of the Albarradas area. What was happening at the same time in the southern end of the Valley of Oaxaca was considerably different. There were still no defensively located terrace sites in the Ejutla Valley. Although most of the Sola population (91%) continued to reside in hilltop terrace sites, there was little site continuity there, as all but two of seven Monte Albán Late I terrace sites were abandoned and three terrace sites were established in new locations (Balkansky, 2002). The two most isolated Late I terrace sites were abandoned, while the new ones were more clustered together. In contrast to the stability of terraces sites in the Albarradas area, this shift in terrace site location in the Sola Valley and the lack of a defensive posture in the Ejutla Valley indicate greater influence (or possibly some control) by the Table 4.5.

The data for the other edge areas are not reported in a manner that allows us to examine changes in hilltop settlements during this transition. For example, we know only that there were more than 2,000 residential terraces at 548 sites in the Peñoles area (Kowalewski, 1991), so ostensibly hilltop terraces sites were always a significant feature of the landscape. Settlement and Land Use in Monte Albán II With lower populations and increasing crop yields, regional capacities based on maize farming continued to far exceed the population in the Valley of Oaxaca, and potential food supplies (based on available labor) easily surpassed the regional population. The cushion between actual populations and regional capacities was greater than in Late I except for Tlacolula and the Albarradas area (Table 4.6; Fig. 4.18), where the proportions remained the same. The Sola Valley followed the same pattern as neighboring Ejutla. Overall patterns in potential agricultural surplus did not change. Even though Monte Albán's population dropped, so did the number of people living in the surrounding area. With lower total yields, the need for importing food did not change at Monte Albán, and the adjacent subareas of the valley could have made up the deficit (Fig. 4.19). Potential surpluses were still much lower in Table 4.6. Estimated archaeological, resource-based, and labor- based potential populations for Valley of Oaxaca subareas in Monte Albán II.

With sufficient crops closer to home, Monte Albán's rulers still likely did not engage these areas for staple products. Any interest in these outlying areas more likely continued to focus on trade routes that passed through them. Monte Albán II Summary Throughout the early history of the region, changes in the Albarradas area largely mirrored what was happening in eastern Tlacolula. That pattern continued in Monte Albán II. These two areas did not experience the significant settlement 66 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="73">1 1 2.4°/o ' Monte Alban II 60.9%^]V^_ / 10.4% M^x21.4% J&gt;7.6% I 10.7%^ M P' 3.6% p] r J Archaeological ^3 population as % of L 3.9% £ subarea maximum '4- 1 ^ potential population Fig. 4.18.

These differences may reflect that both eastern Tlacolula and Albarradas were not tightly incorporated into the Monte Albán polity in either Monte Albán Late I or II. In other words, the relationship between these two eastern subregions and Monte Albán remained relatively similar throughout this period. However, that was not the case for other subareas of the valley system, situated farther to the west. Governance at Monte Albán shifted from more internal to external funds of power and relatively collective to more exclusionary political formations. With that change, the settlement pattern and demographic distinctions between the areas close to Monte Alban in Late I that supplied the capital with resources and areas farther away that were less interdependent with the capital diminished to some degree in Monte Albán II. The break between Monte Albán's immediate heartland and other areas under lesser degrees of hegemony is easier to define for Late I (e.g., Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, p. 64, figure 5.12) than for Monte Albán II (e.g., Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, p. 85, figure 6.12). With greater dependence on trade and external networks and perhaps competition between local elites and those at Monte Albán, populations in most subregions declined but became more nucleated, and distance from the capital was a less significant factor in determining patterns of demographic growth, settle- ment, and volume of monumental construction. Excluding Monte Albán, terrace sites were more significant features of the landscape in eastern Tlacolula and Albarradas than in other parts of the valley, probably for defensive concerns. These hilltop communities also experienced greater stability than did terrace sites in other edge areas. The eastern physiographic edge of the valley was not an important interactive boundary at this time, as there may have been more significant interaction between the Albarradas area and eastern Tlacolula than between eastern Tlacolula and the rest of the Valley of Oaxaca. For example, the Black and White ceramic variety was present in significant quantities only at sites in 1 1 2 00(M Monte Albán II L- 9,100^X^^ S 800 S 3 ^ 5,100 J&gt; 6,900 ^ 2,100^^1 P" 4,400 Surplus rounded to V 1 ,800 nearest 100 ^2,00C 'rjl ^ Fig. 4.19.

This decorated ceramic variety was largely absent elsewhere in the Valley of Oaxaca. This contrasts with settlement and ceramic findings for the Ejutla and Sola Valleys, which appear to have been more fully incorporated into the Monte Albán polity. A hypothesis for why Monte Albán had different relation- ships with its southern and eastern boundaries may lie in the nature of interaction along the trade routes and the neighboring groups who controlled them. The principal trade route into the Valley of Oaxaca from the south passes through the Ejutla Valley (White &amp; Barber, 2012). Although we know little about the areas east of the Ejutla Valley, there were no large or defensive Monte Albán II sites near the entry of this route into eastern Ejutla, which would have provided access to a range of coastal and lowland products. There also was an expansion of sites along or near the Atoyac and Miahuatlán Rivers in the southern part of Ejutla that may have participated in exchange with sites along the southern trade route through Miahuatlán. Instead, the first small defensively situated sites in Ejutla were established in the northern part of the area above the most direct route between the largest Ejutla center and Monte Albán (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, p. 80). At this time, the population of Ejutla was much more concentrated in one large site than it had been in Monte Albán Late I. Monte Albán may have incorporated the Ejutla area into its realm at least to some degree, in part to exert influence/control over this trade route. In contrast, eastern Tlacolula and Albarradas are the only two subareas that did not lose population during the transition to Monte Albán II. Monte Albán's sphere of influence always appears to have been stronger in the western part of Tlacolula, out to the Macuilxochitl-Dainzú area, whose principal geo- graphic feature is Cerro Danush, which is visible from Monte Albán. The rest of Tlacolula is not, and eastern Tlacolula and Albarradas are the two subareas least tied into the Monte Albán polity during the Terminal Formative. The population of those two subareas continued to reside in defensively situated hilltop settlements that monitored the principal trade routes into the eastern arm of the valley. FEINMAN AND NICHOLAS: SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN ALBARRADAS, OAXACA, MEXICO 67</page><page sequence="74">Throughout its history, the Valley of Oaxaca was a key intermediary nexus between eastern and western segments of Mesoamerica. As Ignacio Bernal (1965) perceptively noted years ago, its ties tended to extend east through Terminal Formative times. Yet it was during that period (Monte Albán II) that the rulers and populace of the valley also shifted some of their connections and interests to the north, with apparent conquests in Cuicatlán (Spencer, 1982; Redmond, 1983; Spencer &amp; Redmond, 2006). Although this north-focused imperialism did not endure, the region's linkages to the north dominated in the subsequent phase with the continued expansion of Teotihuacan in central Mexico. This more northward face for interaction basically continued throughout the rest of the pre-Hispanic era and even into more contemporary times. 68 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="75">Chapter 5: Early Classic (Monte Albán IIIA) "[Cļities and towns must be viewed within their wider social and cultural context. The forms and functions of urban settlements are to a large extent determined by the nature of the wider society. To understand ancient cities we need to know the answers to questions such as: was this an empire or a city-state society? was the king considered a god? how was commerce organized? was warfare a problem? did farmers live out among their fields or clustered together in towns? Since urban settlements performed specific functions for their hinterlands, our view of ancient cities needs to take into account their specific geographical regions and settings." (M. E. Smith, 2002, p. 18) The Early Classic period (ca. AD 200-500) was a time of sustained demographic growth, increasing community size, and greater economic integration between emergent centers and their immediate hinterlands across highland Mesoamerica (C. A. Smith, 2002; Kowalewski, 2004, pp. 92-93). Settlement patterns shifted as polities competed with each other, and highland populations became ever more concentrated in large centers. Nowhere was this more evident than at Teotihuacan in the Basin of Mexico, where the population grew to more than 100,000 people (Hirth, 1980, pp. 57-58; Blanton et al., 1993, p. 134; Cowgill, 2008, p. 969, 2015, p. 144). Teotihuacan was not only the center of political and economic power in the Basin of Mexico but likely held varying degrees of economic and political influence and control over nearby valleys in the Central Highlands (Hirth, 1980, pp. 98-99; Cowgill, 2000, p. 285; Carballo &amp; Pluckhahn, 2007, pp. 621-622), especially adjacent to natural trade and communication corridors (Hirth, 1980, p. 98). More distant areas, like the Valley of Oaxaca, were not controlled directly by Teotihuacan but were influenced through trade with the urban center and its attempts to monitor key trade routes (Hirth, 1980, p. 99; Cowgill, 1997, p. 134). The nature of Monte Albán's relationship with the rest of highland Mesoamerica was affected by Teotihuacan's macroregional dominance, and the Oaxaca capital lost territory and influence beyond the Central Valleys of Oaxaca. In regions outside the valley that previously had Monte Albán II- style pottery, especially to the north, ceramic assemblages began to reflect Teotihuacan influence (Blanton et al., 1993, p. 88). In Cuicatlán, for example, there is no evidence of continued Monte Albán presence in the Early Classic period (Redmond, 1983; Spencer &amp; Redmond, 1997, p. 216). Although the Monte Albán polity retained political autonomy from Teotihuacan (Blanton, 1978, p. 57; Joyce, 2010, p. 205; cf. Winter, 1998), its extraregional activities were curtailed and constrained (Cowgill, 2008, pp. 969-971). With their loss of influence in outlying areas as Teotihuacan expanded its power/influence, Monte Albán's rulers appear to have refocused their political and economic attentions within the Central Valleys of Oaxaca. Populations increased signifi- cantly across the Valley of Oaxaca and neighboring regions in the Early Classic (Table 5.1). Settlements were larger (Fig. 5.1) and more evenly dispersed across the region than ever before (Fig. 5.2). But the greatest growth occurred in centers. Monte Albán regained most of the population it had lost during the Terminal Formative, and many new large centers were established across the region (Fig. 5.3). Some of these new secondary centers even rivaled Monte Alban in population size - Jalieza in the Valle Grande, Dainzú-Macuilxochitl/ Tlacochahuaya in western Tlacolula, and Cerro Jazmín (Yanhuitlán) in the western Nochixtlán Valley (see Fig. 2.1; Table 5.1.

But Monte Alban continued to maintain its monumental and political dominance within the region as new and expanded construction of the city's two largest structures, the North and South Platforms, greatly enhanced the monumentality of the Main Plaza (Blanton, 1978, p. 46, 1983, p. 128; Flannery, 1983b, p. 132). There was greater formality to the architecture (Blanton, 1989, p. 446), and a number of elite residences were constructed on the edges of the Main Plaza (Fargher, 2016, p. 324) and to its north, but there was minimal glorification or representation of highly individualized leaders (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, p. 152). Monte Albán's rulers appear to have shifted back to somewhat more collective rulership strategies as they lost some of their external sources of funding (Fargher, 2016, pp. 322-323). Some named, personalized depictions of rulers in stone are known for the Early Classic period (e.g., Joyce, 2010, p. 213), but they are few in number. Monte Albán likely focused more than in the prior period on the appropri- ation of agricultural surplus and labor from its surrounding hinterland to support governance that in return provided such public goods as ceremonial spaces, temples, defensive features, and roads (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2017, p. 270); these public goods helped draw people to settle near the capital. Neverthe- less, the focus on internal resources may not have reached the extent that it had in Monte Albán Late I or during the first centuries of Monte Albán IIIB-IV, as the population in the central part of the Valley of Oaxaca did not recover entirely. Monte Albán's governance practices, which during the Early Classic period more fully integrated the valley's population and consolidated power, seem to correspond with what has been referred to as "pseudo decentralization" (Fesler, 1968, p. 373). In addition to Jalieza and Dainzú-Macuilxochitl, several other &lt;.1 / v ' Monte Alban IMA 5(10.9) v / 3-9?Vto^ 5(10.9) w6-8&gt; r^vi 12 9 ^ ( 66.2 (57.3) ' ' (36.0) ^^-^ļ(34.

Population densities in the Valley of Oaxaca and neighboring areas during Monte Alban III A. valley floor sites in the Valle Grande (Cuilapan, Tejas de Morelos, Zaachila, and Santa Inez Yatzeche) had large complexes of monumental architecture containing many large mounds and multiple plazas (Kowalewski et al., 1989, pp. 226- 231). Public architecture at these sites tended to conform to regional building orientations, and plazas tended to be open and accessible (Blanton, 1989, pp. 444-446). For the first time in the history of the Valley of Oaxaca, carved stones in the same style as monuments at the capital were present outside Monte Albán (Blanton et al., 1993, pp. 89-90). In encouraging the buildup of these secondary centers, Monte Albán's rulers may have been decentralizing many functions to these new large centers. But if architectural scale can be used as a proxy, most governing power and authority continued to be centralized in Monte Albán and not in the large secondary centers. These centers are located in the areas of the valley (northern and southern Valle Grande and western Tlacolula) where the greatest population increases occurred, where the settlement was densest, and where strong site hierarchies developed around them as many smaller centers were established or increased in size. These areas were part of the core of the Monte Albán polity, connected to the capital largely through civic-ceremonial networks that interconnected secondary centers and Monte Albán. Monte Albán's relationship with outlying areas, notably eastern Tlacolula, remained different. In western Tlacolula, the Macuilxochitl area is marked 'by a distinctive mountain (Cerro Danush) visible from Monte Albán. Areas farther to the east in Tlacolula are not in the line of sight from the capital. The area around Cerro Danush stretching south to Dainzú and Tlacochahuaya is one of the more agriculturally productive parts of Tlacolula and was more continuously occupied than were areas to the east. During the regional survey, we found 70 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="77">Fig. 5.3. Monte Alban IIIA settlements in the Central Valleys of Oaxaca, showing places mentioned in the text. that the agricultural fields as well as the ridgetops that surrounded the modern communities of Dainzú, Macuilxochitl, and Tlacochahuaya were covered with sherds but not always of the same chronological period. Artifact densities (and the abundance of sites) dropped off dramatically when we moved to the east. The area between Cerro Danush, Cerro Dainzú, and the ridge above the modern town of Tlacochahuaya was clearly a dense zone of settlement, although how the area was occupied and built on shifted greatly during the pre-Hispanic era (Faulseit et al., 2016). Up through Monte Alban IIIA, population densities were always higher in western Tlacolula than in eastern Tlacolula, FEINMAN AND NICHOLAS: SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN ALBARRADAS, OAXACA, MEXICO 71</page><page sequence="78">and during the Early Classic period an earlier settlement at Dainzü-Macuilxochitl/Tlacochahuaya expanded by an order of magnitude to become the largest settlement in Tlacolula and one of the largest secondary centers in the entire valley. At this time, Monte Albán appears to have more fully consolidated its reach in western Tlacolula, which had always had a stronger relationship with the capital than did communities in eastern Tlacolula. Lambi tyeco/Yegiiih, a smaller secondary center approximately 8 km southeast of Cerro Danush, was less affected and may have even lost population. Yegiiih, the earlier part of the site, does not appear to have been as closely tied into the Monte Albán's polity and may have at times had an adversarial relationship with the Monte Albán state even as its inhabitants interacted with the capital and other neighboring communities to the west. Communities beyond the polity's core area, like Yegüih, may have had fluid (at times antagonistic) relationships with the capital and still were not fully integrated into the Monte Albán polity. Spatially, there are parallels with these relations that have been documented textually for the Late Postclassic period (Horcasitas &amp; George, 1955; Oudijk, 2008). At that later time, the large center at Macuilxochitl had close ties with Cuilapan, situated in the valley center basically at the foot of Monte Albán. Yet Mitla, farther to the east, was a longtime adversary of Macuilxochitl. By the end of the Early Classic period (i.e., Middle Classic, AD 500-600), Monte Albán engaged in another effort to strengthen and expand its hegemony farther east in the Tlacolula Valley and south in the Ejutla Valley. In both areas, existing large centers were repositioned to be closer to Monte Albán, and in both cases the new centers had much more monumental architecture than earlier centers. The Early Classic center at Yegüih was moved approximately 1 km west to Lambityeco, where the new civic-ceremonial core was rebuilt with much larger and taller mounds, including a large ballcourt that closely resembled the principal ballcourt at Monte Alban in layout and size (Feinman et al., 2016, pp. 49, 52). The new location was closer to and had a better view of Cerro Danush, where monumental architecture was newly constructed on the mountain's summit (Faulseit, 2013, p. 15). The layout and the construction materials used in the building of Lambityeco signal access both to knowledge and to goods that were likely not entirely local (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2016c; Feinman et al., 2016). In the Ejutla Valley, the largest settlement with the most monumental architecture at the end of Monte Albán II was situated under the contemporary district head town (Ejutla de Crespo). Although that site grew as well during the Early Classic period, by the end of the Early Classic it had been completely eclipsed by a new center at San Joaquin, which was established on a series of low hills 5 km to the north. The new center consisted of three large complexes of monumental architecture and plazas and became the fourth-largest center in all of the Central Valleys of Oaxaca (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, pp. 96, 106). The repositioning of the principal center in the Ejutla Valley to a previously underutilized area may signal the growing importance of interaction and exchange with Monte Albán, which increased its focus on Ejutla as a gateway to lowland products entering the valley system from the south. This gateway may have been with areas east of Ejutla (toward Tehuantepec) rather than to the south through Miahuatlán (see Fig. 2.12), which was one of the few areas in the Southern Highlands that lost population during Monte Albán IIIA (Markman, 1981, p. 67). Even though the population of Ejutla overall increased sevenfold, southern Ejutla also lost popula- tion. In the Sola Valley, a new large center, Los Chilillos, also dominated its hinterland (see Fig. 5.3; Balkansky, 2002, p. 51). Unlike San Joaquin, which was situated on a series of previously unoccupied low hills in the northern part of the Ejutla Valley, Los Chilillos in the Sola Valley (Balkansky, 2002, p. 57) and the Guirún site at the eastern edge of the Tlacolula arm grew from small, dispersed settlements in Monte Albán II into centers of several thousand people in Monte Alban IIIA. Both were defensibly located on top of high mountain ridges and had significant sectors with monumental public architec- ture. Population growth at the Guirún site was coincident with depopulation in the Albarradas area beyond the eastern physiographic edge of the valley. According to Hutson (2014, p. 270), Early Classic ceramics in the Mixe area also show weaker affiliations with the Valley of Oaxaca. The only area within the Valley of Oaxaca to lose population was the northern, Etla arm, where no new large centers were established until the end of the Early Classic or during the transition to Monte Albán IIIB-IV. Etla had been one of the most densely settled areas in the valley for a millennium. The Sierra Norte at the northern edge of the Valley of Oaxaca was almost entirely abandoned (see Fig. 5.2); Robert Drennan (1989, p. 378), who surveyed the area, reports finding only one sherd on the surface that could be assigned with any certainty to Monte Alban IIIA. As populations in the Valley of Oaxaca shifted to the east and south and with the growing threat/ competition with Teotihuacán to the north, the Sierra Norte may have become an undesirable area in which to live. There was overall population growth in the Peñoles area west of Monte Albán, and many new settlements were established in the eastern part of Peñoles that abuts the Valley of Oaxaca (Finsten, 1996, figure 7.3), but population densities still remained much lower there than in the valley. These different patterns of settlement and demographic growth are a result of Monte Albán's pulling away from the north and focusing more on the southern and eastern parts of its realm. Closer in, administration was carried out through a well-developed hierarchy of centers. In more outlying areas - eastern Tlacolula, Ejutla, and Sola - these activities were more heavily concentrated in one or two large centers. The largest site in Ejutla, San Joaquin, was located near an important southern trade route into the valley. These settlement changes may not have been uncontested, however, as defensively located hilltop terrace sites became much more significant features of the landscape during Monte Alban IIIA, circling eastern Tlacolula and the southern edge of the valley into Ejutla and Sola. In concert with much larger populations throughout the region, the volume of economic circulation and interconnection increased in Monte Alban IIIA (Kowalewski et al., 1989, p. 213). This was especially true in eastern Tlacolula, where increasing populations lived in drier areas where crops were not reliable and many sites specialized in crafts; the greater likelihood of food imbalances made it necessary for communi- ties to engage in exchange for food (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2005, p. 246). Our subsequent excavations at two sites in eastern Tlacolula - El Palmillo and the Mitla Fortress - have provided 72 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="79">Table 5.2.

The economic options selected in eastern Tlacolula in the Early Classic could not have succeeded or endured outside the context of burgeoning networks of circulation and market exchange (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2010, 2017). Our recent sourcing studies of excavated collections of obsidian from sites across the valley are providing information on these networks of exchange.

Obsidian was exchanged through several different routes during the Classic period (see Fig. 2.12,). Pachuca (close to Teotihuacan) obsidian remained more prevalent at Monte Albán than in most other sites in the region and likely arrived through a northern route through Etla (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, p. 115; Feinman et al., 2015, figure 12). The Zaragoza source in Puebla was the most prominent source for obsidian at most other sites in the valley, especially at sites in Tlacolula. Although our sourced sample of Early Classic obsidian in the Mixe region is small, it is almost exclusively from Zaragoza. Cantona, a smaller but still important Classic period center in the Central Highlands, heavily exploited the nearby Zaragoza source (see Fig. 2.1; Garcia Cook &amp; Merino Carrión, 1998, p. 213). The easiest route for Zaragoza obsidian to reach the Valley of Oaxaca would have been along the Gulf Coast and up through the Mixe area and into eastern Tlacolula. The proportion of Zaragoza obsidian in Valley of Oaxaca Classic period assemblages generally is lower in sites in western parts of the valley, especially at Monte Albán and the Ejutla site (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, figure 7.29; Feinman et al., 2015, figure 12). Given this spatial distribution, it would appear that the main entry for the Zaragoza obsidian was the eastern travel route that passes just south of the Guirún site. Social network analysis of obsidian distributions also has been employed, and based on these studies, we see Early Classic period links between eastern Tlacolula and the southern Isthmus (Golitko &amp; Feinman, 2015, figures 7 and 8; Feinman Fig. 5.5. G-23s from El Calvario (TL-SLA-SLA-8). et al., 2015, figures 11-13). These connections illustrate that the Central Valleys of Oaxaca were still connected economically with the Pacific Coast (through sites such as Los Horcones in Chiapas), a key node between eastern and western Mesoamerica at that time (see Fig. 2.1). Although the Albarradas area may have been too dangerous for much permanent settlement at this time, exchange still moved through the region, and the Guirún site had a key vantage to track it. Monte Alban IIIA Settlements in Albarradas Settlement patterns shifted dramatically in the Albarradas area with the transition to Monte Alban IIIA. Although the total number of settlements only dropped from 12 to 11, the area lost almost half of its population as most of the Monte Albán II sites were either abandoned entirely or lost much of their earlier population. The eastern slopes of Cerro Guirone and the high mountain valley in the northwestern part of the surveyed area were largely depopulated (Fig. 5.4). When Classic period materials were noted on some of the Late/Terminal Formative terrace sites, the occupation was restricted to a small sector of the earlier site, usually only at the summit of these settlements. Three-quarters of these as well as new settlements were isolated residences or small hamlets of fewer than 50 people (Table 5.3). In contrast to eastern Tlacolula (and Albarradas during the Terminal Formative), craft production in Early Classic Albarradas was minimal, evidenced only at three multicomponent sites that were larger in other periods. Most of the Albarradas population from the Monte Albán II sites that were abandoned easily could have moved to one of two sites that became much larger during Monte Alban IIIA. Both are situated in highly défendable localities: Llego Yiachi in Albarradas and Guirún in eastern Tlacolula. Although we know next to nothing archaeologically about the Mixe region to the east, Zapotees and Mixes reportedly had hostile relations (Schmieder, 1930, p. 60) at the time of the Spanish Conquest. This depopulation and relocation to very défendable locations may be evidence for the deep history of this animosity. The ceramics in the Albarradas area continued in the Valley of Oaxaca tradition, defined largely by the ubiquitous Classic period G-35 conical bowls. Several varieties that are more 74 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="81">Table 5.4. Monte Albán IIIA ceramics at sites* in the Albarradas area.

We did not observe a single piece of pottery that appeared exotic, so even as this area was being abandoned, it remained in the Valley Zapotee cultural tradition. Classic period ceramics at the Guirún site also include the ubiquitous G-35 bowls and low quantities of G-23s and A-3s (thin orange). The population increased 10-fold at Llego Yiachi (TL-SLA- SLA-53), an outpost hilltop terrace site on the eastern side of the Hormiga Colorada at the edge of the surveyed area (Fig. 5.6). The four small plaza-mound groups on the top of the rocky promontory continued in use as new settlement spread down the eastern slopes, where there were a series of terraces on the easiest approach to the top of the rock feature and a tall defensive wall near the base that protected this slope (Figs. 5.7 and 5.8). The steep slopes of Llego Yiachi and the surrounding rough terrain provide a highly défendable location that could have monitored travel along the trade route to the east. The site looks down on the recently improved road (and old foot trail) to Santa Ana del Rio along a tributary of the Tehuantepec River in the Mixe region. The residents of Llego Yiachi clearly chose this location for defense (see Fig. 2.26). We did not find any evidence of craft production at the site. Even during Monte Albán II, the residents of Llego Yiachi may have been less under the influence of Monte Albán, as we found only a few of the Black and White pottery sherds that were abundant at other Monte Albán II sites in the Albarradas area.

Plan of architecture on the top of Llego Yiachi (TL- SLA-SLA-53). relations between Llego Yiachi and Monte Albán remain unknown. It may have been a redoubt for those in opposition to or seeking distance and defense from Monte Alban, a fortified outpost that monitored a key trade corridor to the Valley of Oaxaca, or both. An even larger proportion of the Albarradas population appears to have moved to the western side of the mountains, to the Guirún site in eastern Tlacolula (Fig. 5.9). This hilltop terrace site grew from fewer than 100 inhabitants in Monte Albán II to one of the largest sites (almost 2,500 inhabitants) in eastern Tlacolula by the end of Monte Albán IIIA (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2004a, pp. 69-70). The new center was located on a series of high ridgetops and the steep western slopes of Cerro Guirone (Fig 5.10). Complexes of platforms and structures were constructed on every flat ridgetop and saddle, with groups of terraces on the steep slopes below (Figs. 5.1 1 and 5.12). A four- mound group and adjacent small ballcourt were constructed on the top of a lower slope (Fig. 5.13, in site sector IIA; Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2004a, appendix 2.c). The Guirún site is situated on ridges above the major trade route that enters the eastern end of the valley from San Lorenzo Albarradas and would have had a clear view of traffic along the trail. This trail continued to be heavily used until the paved highway was constructed north of the Cerro Guirone ridge system in the 1960s. We have not excavated at the Guirún site, which was a large settlement from Monte Alban IIIA through the Late Postclas- sic, so most of the obsidian from the site that we have sourced cannot be definitely assigned to a period. But in the sector of the site with the Classic period ballcourt (sector IIA) and where we observed much higher quantities of Classic period pottery on the surface than Monte Albán V pottery, the sourced obsidian is almost entirely from Zaragoza (Table 5.5). On another lower slope (sector IB), where there are standing adobe walls that date Fig. 5.8. Stone defensive wall on the eastern side of Llego Yiachi (TL-SLA-SLA-53). to the Postclassic period and where the quantity of Monte Albán V pottery was twice that of Classic pottery, there was collectively more obsidian from Orizaba and Pachuca than from Zaragoza. In general, the two former sources are much more abundant in excavated Postclassic contexts in the Valley of Oaxaca. Thus residents of the Guirún site may have played a role in the importation of Zaragoza obsidian into the valley in Monte Albán IIIA. The population in eastern Tlacolula also grew significantly (from approximately 2,500 to more than 16,000), so it is unlikely that all - or even most of - the growth at Guirún came from within the valley. The populations at other sites in eastern Tlacolula, especially El Palmillo and the Mitla Fortress, also grew tremendously during Monte Alban IIIA (Fig. 5.14). As Monte Albán's rulers refocused their interests inside the valley, they may have made an attempt to attract people from surrounding mountainous areas, including the Albarradas area. The Early Classic period growth at Macuilxochitl may have encouraged the occupants of eastern Tlacolula to produce for that expanding center and the economic networks into which it was linked. Goods, such as maguey fiber, pulque, chert preforms, and other xerophytic plant products, may have been collected and produced for exchange with the more western, agricultural sectors of the valley, where these resources are less abundant. These opportunities may have fostered rapid 76 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="83">Fig. 5.9. Terraced hilltops and western slopes of Guirún (TL-SLA-SLA-17). demographic growth in the eastern sector of the valley (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2005). Monte Alban III A Terrace and Defensive Sites Hilltop terrace sites were well established as a form of settlement by Monte Albán IIIA, but they became much more imposing and numerous in the Valley of Oaxaca at that time (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, p. 101). In general, Classic period terraces sites tended to be much larger than earlier terrace sites, and most of the largest population centers during the Early Classic period were hilltop, terraced localities. A majority of the Monte Alban IIIA population in the valley resided in these compact, défendable communities, and a band of these sites ringed the eastern and southern edges of the valley (Fig. 5.15). The establishment of these communities occurred in areas that saw the greatest population growth in Monte Alban IIIA. More than 70% of the population in Tlacolula and almost 90% in the Sola Valley resided in hilltop Table 5.5. Proportion (%) of ceramics by period and obsidian varieties at Guirún by site section.

In contrast to the Late and Terminal Formative, there was only one terrace site of any size in Albarradas, yet that one site, Llego Yiachi, housed almost 80% of the total population in the area. The site is in such a défendable location and has defensive walls, so defense was clearly an important concern. Located on hilltops far above the best farmland in the valley, terrace sites were dense (if not always large) concentrations of people that served as loci of nonagricultural production, especially in the Tlacolula subvalley (Kowalewski et al., 1989, pp. 242-243). The largest terrace sites also tended to have precincts of public monumental architecture. By the very nature of their locations, most terrace sites had some concern with defense. In addition to their défendable locations, many of the hilltop sites had high stone retaining walls that provided additional protection. Some hilltop sites appear to have been military garrisons.

Residents of many of them likely exchanged specialized goods for agricultural produce that they could not grow themselves. Architectural canons and artifact assemblages at all of these hilltop sites, even the most outlying, are fully within the Valley of Oaxaca tradition, so clearly their greatest interactions were with other settlements in the valley than beyond. The new large hilltop settlement at Guirún was one of many terrace sites in the Tlacolula arm of the valley. It grew to become the second-largest site in eastern Tlacolula. The amount of public architecture at the site and its location right above the principal eastern travel route into the valley from the east indicates that this site had some links to Monte Albán and the center of the valley.

Settlement and Land Use in Monte Alban IIIA Using maize as a proxy, potential crop yields continued to increase in highland Oaxaca but not as fast as the population did. The estimated population, based on the archaeological evidence, continued to be below regional capacities based on maize farming, but the cushion was much less than ever before (Table 5.7; Fig. 5.16), especially in the dry Tlacolula arm of the valley, where several large new settlements were established in Table 5.7.

Monte Alban IIIA potential agricultural surplus for each Valley of Oaxaca subarea. spite of limited agricultural potential. Factoring in labor supply, farmers would have been able to produce significant surpluses in many parts of the valley, especially in the populous subareas of the valley closest to Monte Alban (Fig. 5.17). Farmers in Etla and the Valle Grande could grow more produce than they needed, supplying some of that surplus to Monte Albán as the capital continued to outstrip the surplus crops of farmers in the Central area. As populations in these areas allocated more labor to farming to provide agricultural surplus for Monte Albán, they would have increased their dependence on markets/other exchange mechanisms to obtain household goods and handi- crafts that they could not make themselves (Blanton &amp; Fargher, 2010, p. 220). Potential surplus production was much lower in the southernmost part of the region (Ejutla and Sola), where it undoubtedly would have been much less practical to transport agricultural surplus to the capital. More signif- icantly, most of the Monte Alban IIIA population in eastern Tlacolula resided in hilltop sites far from what little decent farmland there is in the area. This is the driest part of the valley, and farmers there could have grown enough food for about two-thirds of the population. Agricultural produce from other parts of the valley would have been necessary to feed all of the inhabitants of the large terrace sites, who produced a range of household and other craft goods to exchange for foodstuffs (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2005, 2010, pp. 92-94). In exchange for these goods, the farmers in western Tlacolula could have grown more than enough agricultural produce to provision themselves and all the large, hilltop terraces sites in both western and eastern Tlacolula. This interdependence - and the exchange and market networks that likely sustained it - underpinned the rapid demographic growth that occurred in eastern Tlaco- lula. The population was so low in the Albarradas area, concentrated mostly in Llego Yiachi in a highly inhospitable area, that little agricultural surplus would have been available FEINMAN AND NICHOLAS: SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN ALBARRADAS, OAXACA, MEXICO 81</page><page sequence="88">there. As life beyond the physiographic edge of the valley may have become more dangerous in the Early Classic, defensive concerns and not access to good farmland was the principal factor in the changing settlement patterns in Albarradas. At a more local scale, there was a large increase in Monte Albán IIIA in the number of people living in large sites in areas of the Valley of Oaxaca where the production of large agricultural surpluses was not possible, especially not in dry years (Nicholas, 1989, pp. 482-487). The presence of integrated exchange networks, some centered on markets, would have been necessary before such large concentrations of people moved to hilltop settlements where they could not have reliably provisioned themselves. A prerequisite was interdependence between subareas for basic subsistence items. At the same time, defense appears to have been a major concern in the decision to move to hilltops and leave more productive farmland vacant. This move is coincident with the greater levels of specialized production that we see in Monte Alban IIIA than ever before (Kowalewski et al., 1989, p. 213; Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, pp. 120-121). Based on distributions of good farmland across the region, one would not predict that Tlacolula, especially eastern Tlacolula, would have population densities as high or higher than other valley areas. Increasing commercialization, both within and beyond the valley, including exploitation of local stone resources and xerophytic plants in craft activities for exchange, may have been a key factor in demographic growth in the easternmost part of the valley, while the more agriculturally productive Valle Grande and Etla arms of the valley continued to be the breadbaskets of the region. Monte Alban IIIA Summary For the first time, the settlement trajectory of the Albarradas area did not match what was happening in eastern Tlacolula. The Valley of Oaxaca as a whole, including eastern Tlacolula, experienced rapid population growth. This growth extended south into the Ejutla and Sola Valleys but not north into the Sierra Norte or east into the Albarradas area. As Teotihuacan expanded its influence and Monte Albán withdrew from northern areas to focus more on the valley and exchange routes from the south, areas like the Sierra Norte may have become more dangerous, less desirable places to live. The Albarradas area lost almost half of its population, and what remained resided in défendable locations close to the principal trade route through the area. The move of so many people from the Albarradas area to the Guirún site on the western slopes of Cerro Guirone likely reflects the same processes that brought higher populations into eastern Tlacolula, where they also settled in défendable hilltop locations. Monte Albán's rulers made an effort to draw outlying populations into the valley as the capital lost access to the extractive resources gained previously from areas beyond the physiographic limits of the valley. At the same time, edge areas like Albarradas became too dangerous for all but highly défendable communities (like Llego Yiachi). The powerful at Monte Albán shifted their focus toward greater reliance on internal resources, but the means of generating their funds to support power was based less on the attraction of labor to regions close to the capital coupled with agrarian intensification and, instead, relied on strengthening relations with secondary centers, such as Jalieza and Dainzú-Macuilxochitl, and expansion at these sites as well as other terraced communities. These centers became nodes in an expansive exchange-market system that fostered demographic growth, agrarian production (especially in the Valle Grande and western Tlacolula), and intensified craft production across much of the valley. The fund of power for the governance of Monte Albán likely came from taxes on labor, agricultural produce, and exchange markets. People in outlying parts of the valley system, like Albarradas, may have been influenced/encouraged to move closer as the outlying areas became more dangerous. With larger popula- tions moving into the valley and more, larger centers, competition between local secondary elites may have intensified. The defensive posture of many of the large hilltop settlements may have been as much for guarding themselves from their neighbors, with whom they exchanged as much as they competed. They also may have tried to resist high degrees of political control by Monte Albán's leaders. The closer to Monte Albán secondary elite were, the more control and influence likely was ceded to the capital. Beginning during the Terminal Formative and continuing into Monte Alban IIIA, the Tlacolula arm of the valley began to equal and often surpass the population densities in other, more agriculturally productive subareas of the valley. Through- out this period, densities were always higher in western Tlacolula, which was more closely integrated with the Monte Albán polity, than in eastern Tlacolula. Tlacolula continued its demographic dominance after Monte Albán began to decline at the end of the Classic period and throughout the Postclassic period. But after the Early Classic, the demographic histories of eastern and western Tlacolula began to diverge, with eastern Tlacolula, the driest subarea in the valley, overtaking western Tlacolula as the most densely settled part of the valley. This ascendance would not have been possible without well- integrated exchange/market networks. That some of these networks connected to areas outside the valley, following the important trade routes through the Albarradas area to the Pacific and Gulf Coasts, was likely a key factor in the region's later history. Although Monte Albán eventually fell, later in the Classic period, many of the networks and economic patterns that it seems to have encouraged endured beyond the apogee of the capital. 82 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="89">Chapter 6: Late Classic (Monte Albán IIIB-IV) "[Tļhere is never a shortage of strong men who enjoy getting a fortune from tax receipts." (Olson, 1993, p. 573) The Late Classic/Epiclassic (ca. AD 500-850/900) was a period of regional reorganization across highland Mesoamer- ica. The large expansive states under the hegemony of the great Classic period cities began to break up into smaller polities as the urban centers reached their apogees and then began to decline in size, influence, and control. Both Teotihuacan and Monte Albán retained sizable populations, but they were no longer the dominant political and demographic centers in their respective regions by the end of this period (Blanton et al., 1993, pp. 91-99; C. A. Smith, 2002, pp. 165-168). In Oaxaca, the smaller polities that subsequently formed generally were centered at prior secondary centers where local ruling elites were able to take advantage of the resulting power vacuum to promote themselves into new positions of authority and autonomy. In the Valley of Oaxaca, this change is visible in a new kind of carved stone monument - genealogical registers - that began to be erected at Monte Albán and more than a dozen other sites in the valley toward the end of the Late Classic period (Marcus, 1983b, 1992b, 2006; Urcid et al., 1994; Urcid, 2003; Feinman, 2007). Emerging rulers began to employ more exclusionary leadership strategies and erect stones or other illustrative means that typically show marital pairs and trace the descent of powerful individuals from their forebears in an attempt to legitimize their right to rule. These representations, in contrast to earlier stone monuments, generally were positioned in highly private settings where only a narrow societal segment could view them. Long-standing problems and debates concerning the ceramic chronology for the Classic and Early Postclassic periods in the Valley of Oaxaca have hampered our understanding of Monte Albán's decline and the contemporaneity of population and settlement shifts across the region. The archaeological surveys of the Valley of Oaxaca (Blanton et al., 1982; Kowalewski et al., 1989) produced the first valley wide picture of settlement patterns for this era and recorded important changes over time. But the spatial distributions for Monte Albán HIB and IV seemed a bit improbable to many. The near lack of spatial overlap in settlement patterns in the Valley of Oaxaca for these two periods has raised questions for decades (Winter, 1989; Lind, 1991-1992, 1994), with some researchers suggesting that the two phases should be combined into one long period (Lind, 1994; Markens, 2004). A complicating matter is that during surveys in more outlying areas, such as the Ejutla Valley, the Sola Valley, the Albarradas area, Peñoles, and the Sierra Norte, there often were few diagnostics beyond the ubiquitous Classic period G-35s to distinguish between Monte Albán HIB and IV. In our surveys of the Ejutla Valley and the Albarradas area, we found very little pottery that we could definitely attribute to Monte Alban HIB in comparison to a somewhat greater abundance of Monte Albán IV diagnostics. Although we could not confirm the presence of Monte Albán IIIB at some sites, we also could not rule it out. The lack of clear Monte Alban IIIB diagnostics matched but was even starker than patterns previously observed in southern Valle Grande and eastern Tlacolula, the subregions adjacent to Ejutla and Albarradas. There likely is some temporal overlap between the ceramics traditionally referred to as Monte Alban IIIB and IV. Yet there also are diagnostics of Monte Albán IV that clearly extend centuries later in time (Brockington, 1973; Bernal &amp; Gamio, 1974; Winter, 1997; Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, pp. 141-156), while archetypical Classic forms, notably the iconic ceramic funerary urns, generally do not. A key diagnostic that we used on survey to define Monte Albán IV was imitation Balancan (Z) Fine Orange (Kowalewski et al., 1978, pp. 191-192), which elsewhere has been dated to contexts that postdate the time frame for Monte Alban IIIB (Marcus &amp; Flannery, 1990, p. 194). Imitation Fine Orange was most abundant in Tlacolula and has been found in the Ejutla Valley (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, figure 8.10) and in Miahuatlán (Brockington, 1973; Markman, 1981, pp. 101, 164). Imitation Fine Orange has been recovered in a limited area at Monte Albán (Blanton, 1978, figure 4.37) that does not spatially correspond with the site's greatest expansion in Monte Alban IIIB. Imitation Fine Orange instead was more abundant in those parts of the valley system that were the first to break away from Monte Albán and that were most accessible to the Gulf Coast, where Fine Orange pottery is abundant and was made (Arnold et al., 1993). Differences between the settlement patterns for Monte Albán IIIB and IV also support the inference that areas more distant from Monte Albán likely were the first to break away from the capital's hegemony (Kowalewski et al., 1989, maps 5-7). Areas in the south and east tended to have more Monte Alban III A and IV ceramic diagnostics and fewer IIIB ceramic markers. In subsequent excavations at Ejutla in the south and El Palmillo in the east, we also found some ceramics that typically would be classified as Monte Alban III A in contexts that postdate AD 500 but where we had not found clear Monte Alban IIIB diagnostics on the surface (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, p. 151). The more typical Monte Alban IIIB pottery found at Monte Albán and surrounding areas did not reach very far into the eastern and southern hinterland. As Monte Albán IIIA-style ceramics declined in use in these areas, they were relatively rapidly replaced with more typical Monte Albán IV diagnostics that first appeared in outlying parts of the region while more typical IIIB pottery continued to be used at Monte Albán (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, pp. 150-151). In spite of problems with the ceramic chronology, there are spatial and temporal patterns that would be lost if the Monte Alban IIIB and IV populations simply were added together and treated as one long period. Such a scheme obscures potentially significant temporal and spatial variation that was consistently observed in the field. The original settlement pattern maps present three spatially defined patterns (Kowalewski et al., 1989, maps 5-8). In Etla and around Monte Albán, the population was large in Monte Alban IIIB, declined in IV, and rebounded some in V. Tlacolula had a large population in Monte Albán IIIA, which declined in IIIB, recovered in IV, and FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY N.S., NO. 46, NOVEMBER 13, 2017, PP. 83-96 83</page><page sequence="90">Table 6.1.

The Valle Grande had a large population in Monte Albán IIIA that was much reduced in HIB and IV and then was large again in V. To address these issues in a way that preserves the broad findings of the original surveys, incorporates new information from recent excavations, and recognizes that Monte Albán IIIB-IV was not a prolonged era of stasis, we reexamined the settlement data from across much of the region. We looked at all multicomponent sites with occupations pertaining to Monte Alban IIIA through V for the Valleys of Oaxaca and Ejutla and the Albarradas area and systematically made adjustments for interim phases that had not been detected or well defined during the surface surveys (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, pp. 142-152). We use specific language to distinguish adjusted populations from the original survey data. Instead of Monte Albán HIB and IV, we refer to early IIIB-IV and late IIIB-IV for the adjusted figures and interpretations drawn from these new assessments. For the most part, this procedure produced adjusted popula- tions for late IIIB-IV in Etla and the Central area (where we did not detect much Monte Alban IV on the surface) and adjusted populations for early IIIB-IV in the rest of the valley (where Monte Albán HIB diagnostics were sparse) (Table 6.1). This exercise also resulted in population estimates for the Early Postclassic, which we refer to as early V in the subsequent chapter. The discussion below incorporates the new demo- graphic profiles (Fig. 6.1). However, we also present the original data and maps for Albarradas (dividing this temporal era into two phases: Monte Albán IV and V) that are based directly on our original field investigations. Chronological refinements for the Valley of Oaxaca are important, as Teotihuacan's decline started early in the Late Classic period, and its fall likely had ramifications for the region and its main center, Monte Albán. The decline of Teotihuacan began circa AD 500-550, when parts of city were abandoned and major structures, especially in the civic-ceremonial core of the city, were burned (Cowgill, 2015, p. 233). The depopulation and eventual fall of the great city is thought to have been provoked by a range of factors, including internal social, political, and economic troubles that weakened the polity so that it was more vulnerable to invasion and/or increasing competi- tion from nearby polities (Cowgill, 2015, p. 239; Nichols, 2016, p. 29). The fall of Teotihuacan and the retraction of its foreign interactions led to changes in macroregional networks. Although we do not see any clear evidence that Teotihuacan conquered or ruled Monte Albán (cf. Winter, 1998), which during this period retained distinctive Oaxacan canons and traditions of pottery, architecture, writing, and burial, there are indications that the elites at the two Classic period centers did have a special relationship, which was recorded toward the end of the Early Classic period on carved stone monuments and painted murals (Marcus, 1983e). In the early part of the Late Classic (early IIIB-IV, ca. AD 500-700), perhaps initially bolstered by its ties with Teotihua- can, Monte Albán reached its largest size and greatest monumentality. A large construction episode across much of the civic-ceremonial core of the city, including the expansions of the great platforms at the northern and southern ends of the Main Plaza, was implemented (Bernal, 1965). At the central city, resource extraction was focused more heavily on internal resources and agricultural production to feed the capital.

Both in subdivisions or neighborhoods of Monte Albán (Blan ton, 1978, pp. 19-20) and in smaller centers near the capital (Kowalewski et al., 1989, pp. 262-270), architectural complexes with relatively consistently aligned groups of platform and plazas were built (Blanton, 1989; Kowalewski et al., 1989, p. 263). In-migration and the civic-ceremonial integration of an expanding population was fostered through public rituals and events likely centered in these plazas (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, p. 152, 2017, p. 270). As people were drawn (not forced) to the capital and its immediate surrounds, population and settlement in the Central area around Monte Albán and in the northern, Etla arm reached their highest pre-Hispanic levels.

Based on recent excavations and the assessment of earlier investigations at the secondary center of Lambityeco (e.g., Lind &amp; Urcid, 1983, 2010; Paddock, 1983a; Feinman et al., 2016), we see early IIIB-IV as a time of relatively collective organization at Monte Alban.

Likewise, at Lambityeco and El Palmillo, the elevation and elaboration of palaces to the center of governance took place later in this period (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, pp. 141-157). In contrast, during the Middle Classic and early in the Late Classic period, processions (e.g., González Licón, 2015) and ritual 86 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="93">Fig. 6.6. Carved stone in form of monkey from Platform 1 1 at El Palmillo. events with wide participation, held in plazas, were significant at sites in the political sphere of Monte Albán, including the early occupational episode at Lambityeco (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, 2016c; Feinman et al., 2016). The significant growth in population and monumental building that took place in Etla was ramified in the southern part of the Peñoles area, which is adjacent to Etla, where many small Late Formative hilltop sites grew into important Classic period centers, with lots of terraces and platforms. We do not have fine chronological control for Peñoles, but population increases there may have occurred coincidently with the growth in Etla (Fig. 6.3). Given its proximity to the northern arm of the valley, the population growth that occurred in the Sierra Norte during Monte Albán IIIB-IV (Drennan, 1989, p. 378) also may have started early in that era. As Monte Albán's rulers focused on enhancing connections with areas to the north, populations declined in southern parts of the valley, especially in southern Valle Grande and the Ejutla Valley (see Fig. 6.3). As Monte Albán's interest in southern networks that had focused on Ejutla waned, the Early Classic center at San Joaquin began to decline. Although population decline was less pronounced in the adjacent Sola Valley, effects of Monte Albán's directional shift are evident in settlement discontinuities and a lower level of political unification (Balkansky, 2002, p. 57). At the same time, populations grew in Miahuatlán, with many sites located in more défendable locations (Markman, 1981, p. 67). Miahuatlán may never have been as tied in with Monte Albán as Ejutla and Sola were, so the patterns of change differed. Recent excavations have provided a fuller picture of Late Classic period changes in Tlacolula (e.g., Feinman et al., 2016). At the time that populations declined somewhat in western Tlacolula, they increased in eastern Tlacolula during early IIIB- IV. Initially, this may have been spurred by efforts of Monte Albán's governors to extend the core area of their most intense degree of influence and interdependence from Dainzú-Mac- uilxochitl, a major secondary center in Monte Albán IIIA, to Lambityeco in the center of the Tlacolula arm. Yegüih, situated in the eastern part of the larger Lambityeco/ Yegüih site, had been an important secondary center in Tlacolula during Monte Albán IIIA, but it was outside Monte Albán's core heartland, which extended to Dainzú-Macuilxo- chitl. Early in the Late Classic period, the civic-ceremonial precinct at Lambityeco/Yegüih was moved several kilometers to the western, Lambityeco part of the site (Feinman et al., 2016), which is closer to Macuilxochitl/Cerro Danush. Residential population also moved to the northern and western parts of Lambityeco (Paddock, 1983d). The Yegüih section of the site was basically abandoned. We believe that this move to a location closer to and visible from Cerro Danush, an area that had always been more closely tied to Monte Albán, reflects a change in the relationship between Lambityeco and Monte Albán. Although mound groupings at both Yegüih and Lambityeco had linear arrangements, the new civic core at Lambityeco was far more monumental than the earlier civic precinct at Yegüih and was constructed following architectural canons common at Monte Albán. The building of Lambityeco's core was well planned and rapidly implemented. All buildings shared a common orientation (Lind &amp; Urcid, 2010, p. 106; Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2016c). The site's palaces were construct- ed on the north side of the civic-ceremonial core (as they were at Monte Albán), and the rooms of the palaces were positioned around a single patio, also like at Monte Albán (Lind &amp; Urcid, Table 6.2.

At this time, a new ballcourt that was similar in form, size, and orientation to the ballcourt on Monte Albán's Main Plaza (Feinman et al., 2016) was constructed at Lambityeco. The Lambi tyeco ballcourt was positioned so that its long axis ran north to south, which differs from the earlier, smaller Yegüih ballcourt, which ran east to west. The iconography at Lambityeco included prominent representations of Cocijo (Lind &amp; Urcid, 2010, p. 112), the principal supernatural associated with Monte Albán, which were arrayed in the patio of an important palace. El Palmillo is another, larger secondary center in eastern Tlacolula where there also were significant changes between Monte Albán IIIA and IIIB-IV. Based on survey and excavations, the hilltop terrace site reached its greatest extent in Monte Alban IIIA or early in IIIB-IV and then began a slow decline during the Late Classic (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2004a, pp. 95-96). On most of the excavated terraces, we mapped intact residential architecture pertaining to Monte Alban IIIA. But the earliest intact levels in the three palaces at the top of the hill, all with one patio, were constructed in early IIIB-IV, more or less contemporaneous with the move from Yegüih to Lambityeco. Some Monte Alban IIIA and earlier ceramics that were present under the lowest levels are all that remains of residential architecture that was leveled during the construction of the new Late Classic palaces (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2009, p. 64). Thus major changes occurred during the middle of the Classic period, even at El Palmillo, which is distant from Monte Albán. When this shift occurred, the palaces were built with a plan similar to that at Monte Albán. But later in the Late Classic period at both Lambityeco and El Palmillo, the size of main palaces was expanded to include multiple patios; that plan deviated from the architectural conventions previously shared with Monte Albán. At the same time, a small ballcourt was constructed between two of the palaces at El Palmillo (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2011c). During late IIIB-IV, Monte Albán lost power and began a slow decline. Changing macroregional networks provided new opportunities for local elites at secondary centers who grew in importance and began to assert greater autonomy. At as many as a dozen sites, local elites began to commission and erect genealogical registers that emphasized their personal biography and bilateral descent (Marcus, 1992b, 2002, 2006; Urcid, 1992, 2003; Urcid et al., 1994; Masson &amp; Orr, 1998; Feinman, 2007). The funding of power may have shifted to external resources, especially the control of trade routes. One of those sites was Lambityeco, where closer ties to Monte Albán did not last long Table 6.4.

Monte Albán IV settlements in the Guirún/Albarradas survey region, showing sites mentioned in the text. once the region's largest urban center began to decline. At Lambityeco, palaces were reconstructed with a two-patio plan not seen at Monte Albán (Lind &amp; Urcid, 2010, pp. 123-125). The civic-ceremonial core at Lambityeco was modified in ways that changed its use, including the remodeling of the ballcourt to a layout less similar to the one at Monte Alban (Feinman et al., 2016). At the same time, a large plaza associated with the ballcourt was closed off, and ritual space on the plaza was restricted to use by much smaller groups (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2016c, pp. 31-33). In later excavation levels at Lambityeco, representations of Cocijo are rare, largely replaced by other imagery; this change would indicate a strong declaration of broadening ideological emphases with less focus on Cocijo (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2016c, p. 50). In the Mound 190 palace at Lambityeco, the iconic Cocijo frescoes were covered over during a remodeling episode and never replaced. These changes are related to shifts in political strategies from the more collectively organized power structures present in the Valley of Oaxaca during the Early and Middle Classic to more exclusionary tactics of emerging elites at smaller centers. The location of the ballcourt at El Palmillo between two palaces, with direct access by members of those households, instead of in the site's main public plaza fits the expanding use of exclusionary tactics by emerging elites. The decentralization of political influence away from Monte Albán and the empower- ment of local nobles at secondary sites led to greater instability, and regional populations declined across much of the valley during late IIIB-IV. Lambityeco itself was largely abandoned by the end of the Late Classic period. El Palmillo continued to be occupied until possibly the beginning of the Early Postclassic, but there, too, was upheaval. The ballcourt was short lived. During its abandonment, a carved stone sculpture of a regal-looking figure (a possible ruler), with its head lopped off (defaced), was thrown into the ballcourt during an intentional fill event that ended the use of the ballcourt (Fig. 6.4). Eastern Tlacolula, notably the area east of Lambityeco, was the only subarea of the valley where populations grew. Even though eastern Tlacolula is the driest subarea, it became the new demographic center of the valley (Fig. 6.5).

Site map of TL-SLA-SLA-43. The adjacent Albarradas area was the only other area in the region to see significant population growth during late IIIB-IV (see Fig. 6.3). Given the focus on craft specialization in the absence of great expanses of good farmland that began in Monte Albán IIIA, eastern Tlacolula became the commercial center of the valley. Analysis of ceramic compositions using instrumental neutron activation (Faulseit et al., in press) has shown that even utilitarian pottery was exchanged across the valley. That El Palmillo, in eastern Tlacolula, had the highest proportion of imported pottery of any site in the study illustrates how important exchange connections were to the dry, eastern Tlacolula arm of the valley. The adjacent Albarradas area benefited from these changes as the amount of exchange and interaction increased in eastern Tlacolula. The higher proportions of Imitation Fine Orange pottery at sites in eastern Tlacolula (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, figure 8.10) is one indicator that trade links to the east, toward the Gulf Coast and Cantona (eastern Puebla), were a key factor that allowed Tlacolula elites to break from Monte Albán and thrive as that center fell. Influences from and interactions with Veracruz and the Gulf lowlands likely arrived in the valley mainly by way of the eastern travel route through the Albarradas and Mixe areas or by the southern route into the Ejutla Valley. Fine Orange also is present in the Mixe collection analyzed by Hutson (2014, p. 271). In our excavations at four sites in Oaxaca that were occupied throughout the Classic period, we found limited amounts of Imitation Fine Orange in Ejutla (in the south) compared to higher quantities at the three sites in Tlacolula (El Palmillo, Mitla Fortress, and Lambityeco) (Feinman &amp; Nich- olas, 2015, table 6). Although the abundant samples of Imitation Fine Orange at Lambityeco were almost certainly locally made at Lambityeco itself (Abascal et al., 1973), the relative abundance implies links to the east, likely via the Mixe region. A stone sculpture of an anthropomorphic monkey recovered in a palace at El Palmillo (Fig. 6.6) is similar to carved stone figures in the Mixe collection analyzed by Hutson (2014, figure 31). Network analyses of obsidian distributions also provide support for the increasing importance of the eastern travel route into the Valley of Oaxaca but with a shift from the southern Isthmus to the Gulf Coast (Feinman et al., 2015; Golitko &amp; Feinman, 2015, figures 9 and 10). A principal route from the Gulf Coast, to the north, intersects the eastern travel route along the Tehuantepec River in the Mixe area (see Fig. 2.12). This is the most likely route for obsidian from the Zaragoza obsidian source, which is situated near the Puebla/ Veracruz border, to reach the Valley of Oaxaca. During the Late Classic period, Zaragoza obsidian became a major source in highland Mesoamerica, especially in Oaxaca, where its abun- dance in obsidian assemblages continued to be higher in eastern Tlacolula than in western parts of the valley (Table 6.2; Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, figure 7.29; Feinman et al., 2013, figure 5, 2015, figure 15). Zaragoza obsidian also accounts for more than 85% of our sourced sample of obsidian from several sites in the Mixe region (Feinman et al., 2017). Zaragoza was heavily exploited by Cantona (García Cook, 2003, pp. 339, 341; García Cook &amp; Tenorio, 2010), which became the largest and most important Late Classic center in the Central Highlands after the decline of Teotihuacan (Garcia Cook, 1994, 2003, pp. 311, 341; Garcia Cook &amp; Merino Carrión, 1998; Montero Guzman, 2004, p. 56; Gómez Chávez &amp; Spence, 2012, p. 288; Cowgill, 2015, p. 237). Proximity to the Zaragoza source and its exploitation may have been a significant factor in the rise of Cantona as a large, important city (Garcia Cook &amp; Merino Carrión, 1998, p. 213). Pottery and other goods from faraway regions (including Oaxaca, central Mexico, the Gulf Coast, and Campeche) have been found at Cantona and yield indications of long-distance connections (Garcia Cook &amp; Merino Carrión, 1998, p. 213; Plunket &amp; Uruñuela, 2005, p. 105), which increased trade along the Gulf Coast during the Late Classic period. Monte Albán IIIB-IV Settlements in Albarradas During the survey of the Albarradas area, we recovered few definitive diagnostic ceramics of Monte Albán HIB (only at the Guirún site). We dated 10 sites with typical Valley of Oaxaca 90 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="97">Fig. 6.9. Site map of Hierve el Agua (TL-SLA-SLA-24).

Although the late IIIB-IV diagnostics on sites in the Albarradas area did not include Imitation Fine Orange, that ware was present in one part of the Guirún site. In Chichicapan, Fahmel Beyer (2012) found evidence that local potters continued to be influenced by Monte Albán and molded figurines and whistles that replicated those found at the capital during the Late Classic.

Small structures on flatter terrain in the northern part of Hierve el Agua (TL-SLA-SLA-24). In terms of settlement, the largest change in the Albarradas area in Monte Albán IIIB-IV was the complete abandonment of the small, high mountain valley in the northwest and the establishment of a large site at Hierve el Agua in the southeastern part of the Albarradas area (Fig. 6.7). Llego Yiachi remained a large outpost with significant population, and except for the addition of Hierve el Agua, the overall pattern in the location of smaller sites in défendable locations on the eastern slopes of Cerro Guirone continued. But this similarity masks the abandonment of all small sites in the Albarradas area by the end of Monte Albán IIIA. The only two settlements that continued to be occupied in IIIB-IV are two of the most defensibly located sites: Llego Yiachi and El Trigo (TL-SLA-SLA-41) (Table 6.4). El Trigo is one of the few places in the Albarradas area that was occupied throughout the pre- Hispanic sequence, beginning in Monte Alban Late I. It is a terrace site situated on the top of a steep and very défendable hill in the middle piedmont, with a great view of areas to the east and north. El Trigo is situated above the contemporary highway to the Mixe region, which largely follows an ancient road. The site consists of two dozen residential terraces, although it is not clear that they were all constructed by this time, as we found Classic period pottery on only about one- third of the terraces. Postclassic ceramics were found on all the terraces, and many of them may not have been constructed until Fig. 6.1 1 . Stone retaining walls at the base of springs at Hierve el Agua (TL-SLA-SLA-24). Fig. 6.12. Fossilized canal at Hierve el Agua (TL-SLA-SLA-24). then. Evidence of chert working at the site also may pertain to Monte Albán V. As populations moved back into the Albarradas area in Monte Alban IIIB-IV, people settled in different but still very défendable locations, often on ridgetops or promontories with good views of the surrounding area, so it appears that the residents of these settlements still feared raids or had other defensive consider- ations. One of these sites is TL-SLA-SLA-43, where we mapped dispersed house foundations on the top of a long, narrow ridge between two deep barrancas (Fig. 6.8). Hierve el Agua, located below the eastern slopes of Nueve Puntas, became the largest site in the Albarradas area (Fig. 6.9). More than 90% of the population of the Albarradas area resided in Hierve el Agua and Llego Yiachi, both of which had defensive postures. We found no evidence that craft production was a significant activity at either site, although chert working was present at a small settlement very close to Hierve el Agua. Overall emphasis on craft production continued to be minimal in Albarradas. Hierve el Agua, near the modern village of Roaguia, had been occupied earlier during Monte Albán Late I and II. The earlier population settled on top of a narrow ridge above the natural springs. Although we did not recover any definite Monte Albán IIIA pottery on the surface, Classic period pottery covered a wide area of flatter, less défendable terrain, and we cannot rule out that there was some occupation at the site in the Early Classic. Clearly by Monte Alban IIIB-IV, though, the settlement expanded over an area of 86 ha of well-watered terrain at the base of the mountains and above the natural springs and fossilized canals (Figs. 6.10-6.12). The site is défendable from the south and east but not from the north (Fig. 6.13). Today, a modern dirt road from eastern Tlacolula to Roaguia crosses a secondary pass in the mountain ridge behind Hierve el Agua, and the site's past inhabitants may have used this route to travel into eastern Tlacolula for both defense and trade. The site also lies right above the current path that follows the Hormiga Colorada, leading south to San Baltazar Guelavila and beyond. In spite of defensive concerns, all of the IIIB-IV settlements were in the eastern sector above the Hormiga Colorada and its tributaries, an indication that location near the principal trade route into eastern Tlacolula continued to be a key factor. Guirún continued to be one of the largest sites in the eastern end of the Tlacolula Valley as settlement spread farther up the slopes to the top of the highest ridge on the western side of Cerro Guirone (see Fig. 5.10). Local rulers at Guirún may have 92 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="99">Fig. 6.13. View of Hierve el Agua (TL-SLA-SLA-24) from the southeast. Fig. 6.14.

Most of the large sites in the Tlacolula arm during the later Classic were located in the northern half of this region, near other possible entry points into the valley from the north (Fig. 6.14). The southern part of the Tlacolula arm was almost devoid of settlement, and El Palmillo may have begun to decline in size and importance by the very end of the Late Classic (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2004a, p. 95). Both of these patterns may reflect a waning importance of southern routes into the Valley of Oaxaca, one of which entered the valley west of El Palmillo. This mirrors a decline in population in Ejutla at this time, as the focus of interaction was mainly with areas to the east. Monte Alban IIIB-IV Terrace and Defensive Sites Although populations declined across the Valley of Oaxaca by the end of the Late Classic period and there were fewer terrace sites overall, the hilltop centers continued to house significant proportions of the population (Table 6.5). At their peaks early in IIIB-IV, between 60% and 70% of the population in Etla and the Central area lived in these hilltop communities. Monte Albán's hilltop presence was reduced by the end of the Classic period, while other terrace sites continued as large population centers (Fig. 6.15). Jalieza, in the northern Valle Grande, expanded to become the largest hilltop center in the entire region and also was the principal population center in the valley, with more than 16,000 residents (Kowalewski et al., 1989, p. 287). Several other large Monte Albán IIIA terrace sites in the Valle Grande continued to be occupied in IIIB-IV so that more than 75% of the population of the Valle Grande resided in these hilltop centers. The change between Monte Alban IIIA and IIIB-IV was much greater in Ejutla. The proportion of population in terrace sites in Ejutla jumped to 50% from 15% as the large center at San Joaquin lost much of its population by the end of IIIB-IV (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, p. 130). Only one of the Monte Alban IIIA terrace sites in Ejutla continued to be occupied, while all the other terrace sites were new occupations in defensive locations. The great discontinuity in settlement locations in the Ejutla Valley illustrates the significant disruption that occurred even at the valley's edges coincident with Monte Albán's decline. With Monte Albán's lessened Table 6.6. Estimated archaeological, resource-based, and labor- based potential populations for Valley of Oaxaca subareas in Monte Alban IIIB-IV.

More than one-third of the Monte Alban IIIB-IV terrace sites in the valley were in the Tlacolula arm, and many of them were large population centers. But not even the largest IIIB-IV settlement in Tlacolula - Macuilxochitl/Tlacochahuaya, where only a very small percentage of the population resided on terraces - was even half as large as Jalieza. The large terrace sites in Tlacolula, including the Guirún site, were in the eastern half of that arm, where the largest buildup of population occurred in IIIB-IV. Many had been large centers in Monte Alban IIIA. Yet as population growth in eastern Tlacolula also occurred in sites that lacked terraces, the population in terrace sites encompassed a smaller proportion of the region's overall population than in the Valle Grande (see Table 6.5). In edge areas like Albarradas and Sola, large proportions of the population continued to reside in terrace sites. But there was disruption in site distributions similar to what happened in Ejutla, especially in Albarradas, where most of the Monte Alban IIIA sites were abandoned and IIIB-IV sites were placed in different locations. These changes also likely are part of the reorganization that occurred across the region with and after Monte Albán's decline. Settlement and Land Use in Monte Alban IIIB-IV With increasing maize yields per hectare and declining populations across most of the Valley of Oaxaca toward the end of the Late Classic period, archaeological populations remained below regional capacities (Table 6.6). The only exceptions are the Central area and eastern Tlacolula in early IIIB-IV and eastern Tlacolula in late IIIB-IV (Figs. 6.16 and 6.17). In spite of higher agricultural yields per hectare, the smaller populations in most subareas were not distributed/ optimally relative to good land and would not have been able to grow as much agricultural surplus as was possible in Monte Alban IIIA (Nicholas, 1989, p. 480). The residents of the largest settlements in the Central area, northern Valle Grande, and 94 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="101">Fig. 6.15. Monte Alban IIIB-IV terrace sites in the Central Valleys of Oaxaca. eastern Tlacolula would have had to engage in exchange in foodstuffs to feed themselves (see Table 6.6). Clearly, concerns with defense often rivaled efficient agrarian placement, leading to the positioning of settlements and population in less-than- optimal locations for agriculture. In northern Valle Grande, population was so concentrated in one center - Jalieza - that its residents would have had to travel considerable distances to farm available agricultural land or import foodstuffs grown elsewhere in the valley. Monte Albán would have continued to require agricultural surplus produced elsewhere, all of which could have come from Etla. At the southern end of the Valley of Oaxaca, large surpluses also were possible in the Ejutla and Sola Valleys. Settlements in both areas were more broadly distributed across their regions in line with agricultural resources (Balkansky, 2002, p. 60; Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, p. 138).

Early IIIB-IV archaeological population as a percent- age of the maximum potential population in each Valley of Oaxaca subarea. The large centers in eastern Tlacolula would have continued to depend on exchange for foodstuffs grown elsewhere in the region. Most of that food may have come from the Albarradas area, where farmers could have produced much more agricul- tural surplus than ever before. Although there is limited flat or gently sloping land in the Albarradas area, the eastern slopes of Cerro Guirone receive much higher rainfall than eastern Tlacolula, which is located in a rain shadow, and high crop yields are possible with sufficient labor. The large settlement at Hierve el Agua was located on some of the flattest, well-watered land in the Albarradas area, and its inhabitants could have grown far more food than they required. Although we could not confirm their age, there are agricultural terraces on a southern ridge of the site, above the fossilized canals, that likely were used for farming (Flannery et al., 1967; Neely et al., 1990; cf. Hewitt et al., 1987; Peterson et al., 1989). Monte Albán IIIB-IV Summary The decline of Monte Albán coincided with an episode of population disruption and reorganization across highland Mesoamerica during the final centuries of the Classic period (e.g., Diehl &amp; Berlo, 1989; Hirth, 1995; C. A. Smith, 2002, p. 313; Kowalski &amp; Kristan-Graham, 2007). Many regions and their principal centers declined in population at the same time that populations grew and new centers were established in other areas. Although demographic declines occurred across most of the Valley of Oaxaca, populations grew in Tlacolula as Monte Alban was losing population. Eastern Tlacolula became the new I 1 4% ļ Monte Albán Late IIIB-IV (_ 36%pV^ ? 19% e 20% I 62% J /j ř" 10% n} 7 I J Archaeological - J? population as % of V ® qo/ subarea maximum ' 22%/^Cv ® qo/ potential population Fig. 6.17. Late IIIB-IV archaeological population as a percentage of the maximum potential population for each Valley of Oaxaca subarea. demographic and commercial center of the valley. In concert with this shift, populations declined in the southernmost parts of the region: southern Valle Grande and the Ejutla Valley. Those areas may never have been as strongly integrated politically or economically into Monte Albán polity, and local elites in those areas may have initially lost influence as market and exchange connections to the capital weakened. The large Monte Albán IIIA centers declined as local elites gained more autonomy and moved to establish new settlements and networks of interaction. Most of the largest centers in IIIB- IV were in Tlacolula, especially eastern Tlacolula, where the ruling elite at sites that were becoming the new population centers of the valley began to erect genealogical registers to legitimate their right to rule (Marcus, 1983b, 1992b, 2006; Urcid et al., 1994; Masson &amp; Orr, 1998; Urcid, 2003; Feinman, 2007). As with southern Valle Grande and Ejutla, eastern Tlacolula never had been as tightly integrated with the Monte Albán polity as the IIIA centers in western Tlacolula, like Macuilxo- chitl, had been. With regional reorganization and changing networks of interaction, ruling elites in eastern Tlacolula may have been less able to obtain desired goods from their western neighbors and instead strengthened ties to the east, through the Albarradas area, perhaps to Cantona, Cholula, and the Gulf Coast. In addition, sites in eastern Tlacolula from early in the Classic period relied heavily on spot resources, like salt (Lambityeco), and craft production. As governance and power shifted to more autocratic/exclusionary forms dependent on external means of support, the local elites in eastern Tlacolula may have had advantages over other polities where internal resources and maize farming were still more important. 96 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="103">Chapter 7: Postclassic (Monte Albán V) "In commercialized times such as the Mesoamerican Postclassic, power is built by moving value about freely, which is difficult where there are corporate obstacles (Blanton et al., 1996). Commercial power is easily transferred from place to place. It makes boundaries dissolve. In the language of money, this is liquid, financial capital, as opposed to a more slowly moving industrial capital, which would be closer to the landed, corporate form of power that was more in evidence in the Classic period." (Kowalewski, 2003b, pp. 9-10) The decline of Teotihuacan, Monte Albán, and other large Classic period centers in highland Mesoamerica marked the beginning of a long period of instability, political fragmenta- tion, and population reorganization that lasted well into the Early Postclassic period. Early in the Late Postclassic period, this long episode of upheaval culminated in a much more heavily populated landscape of small, competing states. The fall of the great centers led to power vacuums and disruptions in exchange networks and trade routes that provided new opportunities for local elites to assert their independence and form new networks of interaction. Local elites became the rulers of smaller semiautonomous polities that were economically interdependent as they competed to establish new networks of interaction and exchange and to attract followers. The proliferation of small polities coincided with increasing commercialization, expansion of market exchange, and increas- ing economic interdependence as population growth occurred across the highlands. Regional and extraregional boundaries became more permeable than ever before, and in many regions new networks and relations were established (Kowalewski et al., 1983, p. 52; Kowalewski, 1990, 2003b; M. E. Smith &amp; Berdan, 2000; Berdan et al., 2003; Golitko &amp; Feinman, 2015, p. 233). Small polities had fluid, changing boundaries, and alliances between these polities shifted with regularity. Not until the end of the pre-Hispanic era, marked by the late rise of the Aztec empire with its capital at Tenochtitlan, did a large polity dominate the landscape as Teotihuacan had during the Terminal Formative and Early Classic periods. During the Postclassic (Monte Albán V), the large region that is today the state of Oaxaca was politically fragmented into networks of small, semiautonomous petty states, or cacicazgos (Oudijk, 2002, 2008). These small states generally were part of alliance networks that often extended well beyond physiographic regions, such as the Valley of Oaxaca (Oudijk, 2000; Pohl, 2003a, 2003b, 2003c). In the valley, cacicazgos were periodically linked to the Mixteca Alta to the north, to the Pacific Coast to the south, and the Albarradas area to the east (Spores, 1965; Oudijk, 2000). At times, small states aggregated under powerful lords. During the Postclassic, economic networks shifted as Monte Albán lost power and emerging leaders of small polities employed exclusionary political strategies to build networks of personal connections to attain power (Kowalewski, 2003b, p. 10; Fargher et al., 2011). Across Mesoamerica, the economy became more commercialized, fostered by an increasing reliance on water transport, new technologies (including metallurgy), and more voluminous flows of "bulk luxuries," such as obsidian, white salt, fine textiles, and highly decorated and hard-fired pottery (Kepecs, 2003; Blanton et al., 2005). The goods that were moved in these networks across the Meso- american highlands also became key sources of revenue for leaders and lords, especially for those who were able to broaden networks and alliances and attract followers. In Oaxaca, the small Late Postclassic states were economically interdependent and at the same time competitive, sometimes forming larger alliances and confederations that were often ephemeral (Spores, 1974; Pohl, 2003a). Ethnohistoric accounts detail competition and shifting alliances (military and marriage) among these small late pre-Hispanic polities in Oaxaca (Spores, 1967; Paddock, 1983c; Pohl, 2003a). The Valley of Oaxaca was never again united (or even mostly unified) under one dominant center. Much of the growth in highland Oaxaca occurred through the establishment of small settlements that proliferated across the region. This dispersed settlement pattern is found across the Southern Highlands, in mountainous zones as well as in broad valleys. The large number of small settlements reflects an active market system that allowed at least a subset of householders in these communities to buffer agrarian imbalances and exchange craft products. At the same time, demographic expansion occurred at many levels of the site hierarchy, with a significant proportion of the population living in larger centers of 1,000 people or more (Kowalewski et al., 1989, table 10.2). By the Late Postclassic, these larger communities were generally the political centers of between 15 to 25 semiautonomous cacicaz- gos that spread across the Oaxaca and Ejutla Valleys (Kowalewski et al., 1989, pp. 344-345; Kowalewski, 1990, p. 42, Feinman, 1998, p. 115, 2001b, p. 365; Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, p. 148). These later polities had populations as high as 25,000 (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, table 10.1), much smaller than the earlier Classic period Monte Albán polity but comparable to estimated population ranges for small states in other parts of the world (e.g., Pounds, 1969; Renfrew, 1982). A similar trend in polity size occurred across highland Meso- america. There were as many as 30 semiautonomous petty kingdoms in the Mixteca Alta in the Late Postclassic, most of which were in the size range of the Valley of Oaxaca polities (Kowalewski et al., 2009; Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, table 10.2). Many Late Postclassic polities in central Mexico also fell within the size range of the Oaxacan polities (Sanders et al., 1970, pp. 443-462; Bray, 1972; M. E. Smith, 2005), although, of course, a few were much larger. In the Valley of Oaxaca, two of the largest polities (Macuilxochitl and Mitla) were situated in the Tlacolula arm of the valley (Fig. 7.1; Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, table 10.1), which became the most densely settled, commercialized, and market-dependent subarea of the valley during the Late Postclassic (Kowalewski, 2003c, p. 73). Population densities followed a clear falloff with greater distances from Tlacolula (Fig. 7.2); the northern Etla arm, which had been so dominant during the Early and Middle Formative, was only slightly more FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY N.S., NO. 46, NOVEMBER 13, 2017, PP. 97-1 13 97</page><page sequence="104">Fig. 7.1.

Farther south, the Sola and Miahuatlán Valleys were settled even less densely. Populations more than doubled in Peñoles (Kowalew- ski, 1991) and the Sierra Norte (Drennan, 1989), yet population densities in those areas also remained much lower than in any subarea of the Valley of Oaxaca. The similarities in size oif the Late Postclassic polities highlight the interdependency and importance of economic exchanges, often through marketplaces that were linked into wide-ranging networks of interaction. At least for the Basin of Mexico and the Mixteca Alta, all polity centers are thought to have had at least one marketplace (Lind, 2000, p. 573; M. E. Smith, 2003, p. 60). It was not until the late expansion of the 98 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="105">- 1 8.7 ( ļ 45.3 ' Monte AlbánV í 12.0 1 77.3~^V. % 98.4 V^61.9 S 58.7 I 130.7)1 ř" 66-1 n) ? ^ r Population e* - H densities per km2 „ 0 S 38.8 ' ^ '24.8^C „ 0 ^ Fig. 7.2.

Aztec empire that one of the largest Late Postclassic polities was established at Coixtlahuaca in the northern Oaxaca highlands as a commercial center for Aztec intrusion/expansion into Oaxaca (see Fig. 2.1; Kowalewski et al., 2008, 2010). But not all residents of the Valley of Oaxaca benefited from increasing commercialization and expanding market exchange. As emerging elites began to form personal networks as a basis to gain power, wealth differences throughout the region increased. During the Late Postclassic, more people than ever before resided in settlements that had few goods beyond utilitarian ceramics (Kowalewski &amp; Finsten, 1983, table 2). In addition, the average number of different kinds of goods found at each site was lower than for any other phase of occupation (Kowalewski &amp; Finsten, 1983, table 3). Some of these trends began during the Late Classic period but then accelerated during the Postclassic. During the Late Postclassic, the greatest impoverishment was in settlements located in the interstices between small polities (Kowalewski &amp; Finsten, 1983, p. 419). At the same time, Postclassic palaces were larger, more elaborate, and more central to settlement layout than earlier in the pre- Hispanic sequence (e.g., Gallegos Ruiz, 1978; Pohl, 1999; Barber &amp; Joyce, 2006). Fewer resources were invested in the construction of temples and other public spaces as the emphasis shifted to royal palaces where ruling lords exercised more exclusionary power and used ritual to validate their right to rule (Winter et al., 2007, p. 205). For Oaxaca, the trends traditionally associated with the Postclassic period more generally, such as significant demo- graphic growth, more dispersed settlement patterns (see Fig. 7.1), expanded exchange and interpersonal networks beyond physiographic regions, and increased economic commercializa- tion (Kowalewski et al., 1989; Feinman, 1996; Kowalewski, 2003b; Markens et al., 2008), are more characteristic of the final centuries of the pre-Hispanic era (late Monte Albán V), when Table 7.1.

Yet the processes that provoked these shifts were initiated at the end of the Classic period with political fragmentation, an increasing reliance on external resources as a base of power, and the intensification of long-distance exchange networks. Throughout many parts of the Valley of Oaxaca, populations were lower in the Early Postclassic (early Monte Albán V) than they had been at the end of the Classic period (see Fig. 6.1). The southern and eastern ends of the valley were exceptions. Populations continued to rise in the Tlacolula arm of the valley in early Monte Albán V in spite of more limited agricultural resources, especially in eastern Tlacolula. In a landscape of competitive cacicazgos (Oudijk, 2002, p. 75), Yagul and Mitla became the new centers of power during the Early Postclassic period (Bernal &amp; Gamio, 1974; Robles García &amp; Juárez Osnaya, 2009; Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, p. 155), with larger and more elaborate palaces than ever before. Mitla's location near the entry point of three natural routes into the valley (e.g., Schmieder, 1930, p. 34; E. C. Parsons, 1936, p. 568; Beals, 1979, p. 165) was an important factor in its rise as an economic and political center in early Monte Albán V. Yagul also sits at the opening to a northward extension of the Valley of Oaxaca (Diáz Ordaz) that is a gateway to Yalalag, the Cajones River, and eventually Veracruz (e.g., Ortiz Diaz, 2002) (see Fig. 2.12). At the outset of Monte Albán V, populations also appear to have rebounded faster in the Ejutla Valley and the Albarradas area, in part because of their locations relative to important trade routes (see Fig. 2.12). Based on site sizes, populations almost doubled in Miahuatlán (Markman, 1981, table 2-1). The southern travel route (White &amp; Barber, 2012) into the Ejutla Valley had been less important in the Late Classic period. But by early Monte Albán V, expanding exchange networks revived interaction and exchange along the southern trade route, including intensified interregional networks between the Mix- teca Alta and the Pacific Coast of Oaxaca (S. M. King, 2008, p. 279; Levine et al., 201 1, p. 127). The growth of Tututepec on the Oaxaca coast beginning in the Early Postclassic period likely was a key impetus for the expanded importance of this southern route (see Fig. 2.1; Spores, 1993; Joyce et al., 2004; Levine, 2011). To the east, the travel route through the Mixe and Albarradas areas continued to be a significant interaction corridor, as indicated by the diverse materials in the Mixe region with stylistic links to the Valley of Oaxaca, the Mixteca, and Veracruz (Hutson, 2014, p. 272).

Earlier in the Classic period, Macuilxochitl, in western Tlacolula, had been closely tied to the capital at Monte Albán, but then it decreased in importance in early Monte Albán V, when Yagul and Mitla were in ascendance. But then, according to documentary accounts (Oudijk, 2008; Joyce, 2010, p. 265), Macuilxochitl (western Tlacolula) joined a confederation with Zaachila (northern Valle Grande) and Mixtee cacicazgos to oppose the rulers of Mitla, whose palaces show evidence of being dismantled and abandoned by late Monte Albán V (Esparza, 1983; Robles García &amp; Juárez Osnaya, 2009, p. 396). According to early colonial era documents, the peasants of Mitla seldom ate corn because it was not available in sufficient quantities (Horcasitas &amp; George, 1955, p. 21). In the dry Mitla area, agriculture has never been a reliable endeavor. Once hostilities with Macuilxo- chitl increased, Mitla's exchange networks with Albarradas may have strengthened and at least partly replaced earlier ones with western Tlacolula. Agricultural surplus from either area alone would have been sufficient for Mitla's inhabitants as long as they had the goods, such as craft products, to exchange for it. A direct Mixtee presence in the valley does not appear to have been significant until the later part of the Postclassic period, when Macuilxochitl and Zaachila formed the confederation with the Mixteca Alta. Rapid demographic growth has been argued for the Mixteca Alta at that time (Kowalewski et al., 2009, p. 317, 2010, p. 81), coincident with explosive growth in central Mexico during the Middle Postclassic (Beekman &amp; Christensen, 2003; Berdan &amp; Smith, 2003). Some areas in western parts of the valley, where there is better agricultural land, may have owed political fealty to Mixtee lords, but there is no evidence of large numbers of Mixtees in the valley (Byland &amp; Pohl, 1994, pp. 182-184). In the Mixteca Alta, craft specialties, such as stonework and metalwork, were highly developed, but large patches of productive agricultural land are limited. Toward the end of the pre-Hispanic era, Mixtee lords established marriage links to just those parts of the Valley of Oaxaca where the largest, most productive patches of land were located, namely, Etla and northern Valle Grande. In these areas, relatively high maize yields could be produced without large inputs of labor. Most communities in Oaxaca today are very compact, but several modern dispersed communities (La Unión and Cuilapan) in the western part of the valley where Mixtee lords moved people to farm their estates are exceptions. In contrast to those areas, the economy in Tlacolula was more craft based, with fewer good agricultural opportunities (Fein- man et al., 2002, pp. 254-255; Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2005, p. 232; Blanton &amp; Fargher, 2010, pp. 220-221). During the Late Postclassic period, the Mixtees who migrated to the Valley of Oaxaca mostly settled as agriculturalists, tied to the estates of their lords, in the area southwest of Monte Albán (near Cuilapan) and in Etla (Whitecotton, 1977, p. 151). Because they were brought into the valley as landless dependents to farm the terrain on their lords' estates, they were directly subservient to the rulers, somewhat like serfs (Spores, 1974; Chance, 1976, p. 605). In that sense, these estates were external resources used by rulers to fund more autocratic political structures. The lack of a tight collective community organization among the in-migrants may help account for the sparsity of artifacts that we found at so many small Monte Albán V archaeological settlements (Kowalewski &amp; Finsten, 1983). From an archaeological perspective, it is hard to find intact Late Postclassic commoner houses in Oaxaca, and this may in part be the consequence of the more modest techniques used in their construction. Obsidian Exchange in the Postclassic Period The sourcing studies of obsidian that we have conducted for sites in the Valley of Oaxaca and neighboring areas have revealed significant changes in networks of interaction after the fall of the great Classic period cities and during the Postclassic period. These shifts in networks of exchange coincide with observed changes in settlement patterns in Oaxaca and elsewhere in western Mesoamerica. The Classic period prepon- derance of Zaragoza obsidian in Oaxaca fell dramatically in the Early Postclassic, and obsidian from the Pachuca source in central Mexico became the dominant obsidian in the Valley of Oaxaca (Table 7.2; Feinman et al., 2015, figure 18, 2017). The decline in the importance of Zaragoza obsidian in Oaxaca is coincident with the decline and abandonment of Cantona around AD 1000 (Garcia Cook &amp; Merino Carrión, 1998, p. 213). Cantona was located less than 10 km from the Zaragoza source, and people at that site heavily exploited it, receiving in exchange goods from across large parts of Mesoamerica. The social network graphs for all of Mesoamerica illustrate a complete breakdown of prior Classic era networks in the Early Postclassic (Feinman et al., 2015, figures 16 and 19). During the Postclassic period, northern exchange networks from the Valley of Oaxaca to the Mixteca Alta and central Mexico increased in significance. During the Late Postclassic, after Cantona's fall, Zaragoza was even less important, replaced largely by other Gulf Coast 100 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="107">Fig. 7.3. Monte Albán V settlements in the Guirún/Albarradas survey region, showing sites mentioned in the text. and central Mexican sources (Table 7.3). Pachuca continued to be the dominant source in Oaxaca and the rest of western Mesoamerica, while Orizaba, another Gulf Coast source, surpassed Zaragoza (Feinman et al., 2015, figure 21). The increasing dominance of Pachuca obsidian reflects the growing importance of the Aztec empire and its expanding networks of interaction and exchange. Following the reorganization of the Early Postclassic period, the networks of interaction were reconstituted and had an entirely different structure during the Late Postclassic (Feinman et al., 2015, figures 19 and 22). The changes in the network graphs of obsidian distributions are consistent with increasing commercialization and economic relationships intensified through markets (Golitko &amp; Feinman, 2015, p. 233) and the entanglements between marketplace transactions and politically driven tribute associated with empire (e.g., Berdan, 1977, 1985, 2003b). In Oaxaca, most of the obsidian from Pachuca arrived largely through northern routes, while obsidian from Orizaba seems to have arrived along the same routes from the Gulf Coast that Zaragoza obsidian did, passing through the Albarradas area. Monte Albán V Settlements in Albarradas Settlement pattern change in the Albarradas area mirrors broader patterns of transition across most of the Valley of Oaxaca during the Late Postclassic period. In the Albarradas area, the number of settlements increased fivefold to 51, while the overall population more than doubled. Although the number of sites expanded at all levels of the site hierarchy, the greatest change was an explosion of small settlements or hamlets that were broadly dispersed across the landscape, in both défendable and less défendable locations (Fig. 7.3). Three- quarters of the Albarradas sites had 30 or fewer inhabitants; only two sites (Llego Yiachi and Hierve el Agua) had more than 1,000 inhabitants (Table 7.4). Most of the sites are dispersed across the lower eastern slopes of Cerro Guirone. A few small settlements were established or resettled in the small mountain valley north of Cerro Guirone, and six small sites were established in very défendable locations on both sides of the high mountain pass north of Cerro Guirone. From these locations, residents of these six sites could have monitored the FEINMAN AND NICHOLAS: SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN ALBARRADAS, OAXACA, MEXICO 101</page><page sequence="108">Table 7.3.

In Albarradas, there continued to be little emphasis on craft production, as we noted chert working at only six sites and ceramic production at one. Most Monte Albán V sites in Albarradas were identified by the thin, hard-fired G-3M sherds that are ubiquitous on the surface of Late Postclassic sites in the Valley of Oaxaca (Table 7.5; Kowalewski et al., 1978, p. 177). Café sahumadors with narrow hollow tubes (Kowalewski et al., 1989, pp. 833-834) also were fairly common. At most sites, there were few other ceramic diagnostics of Monte Albán V. The only polychrome (Kowalewski et al., 1978, p. 193) we observed was in the sector (IB) of the Guirún site with the heaviest density of Postclassic pottery and where there are standing adobe walls (see Fig. 5.10).

This seeming material cultural "impoverishment" was more pronounced than ever before. Approximately 33% of the rural population (not including the two large centers of Hierve el Agua and Llego Yiachi) and 60% of all Late Postclassic sites in Albarradas had no artifacts other than chert from nearby local sources and a small assortment of ceramic varieties. Only at the Guirún site itself did we find such artifacts as a small, carved stone pendant (Fig. 7.4). Patterns of settlement change at the two largest sites in the Albarradas area, Llego Yiachi and Hierve el Agua, were markedly different. Hierve el Agua expanded on the lower, less steep slopes of the Nueve Puntas-Cerro Guirone ridge system, where the site's inhabitants had access to a large spring and the largest expanses of good, well-watered land on either side of the mountain ridge. The layout of the Late Postclassic occupation was relatively open and not particularly defensive (see Fig. 6.9). Llego Yiachi, in contrast, is in one of the most défendable locations of any site in the region (see Fig 5.6). Llego Yiachi was always an important site in the Albarradas area, first as part of a string of Late/Terminal Formative terrace sites above the Hormiga Colorada, not far from the modern Zapotec/Mixe boundary, and then as the only large site in the area during Monte Albán IIIA, when most of the Albarradas Fig. 7.5.

The natural rock cliff is the most prominent topographic feature in the area and is highly défendable (see Fig. 2.26). But given the architectural complexes on the summit that include three small plazas and associated buildings, it was always more than a military outpost. We found ceramics from Monte Albán Late I through V on the top of the rock cliff in association with the architectural complexes, but the standing adobe walls in one building (Fig. 7.5) resemble those at the Mitla Fortress (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2004a, pp. 44-45), and that building may have been constructed near the Fig. 7.7.

In Monte Alban V, Llego Yiachi spread beyond the top and steep eastern slope of the natural rock cliff to the long ridge on the west that slopes more gradually to the Hormiga Colorada (Fig. 7.6). Along this ridgetop, we mapped dozens of residential terraces, and dozens more were too badly eroded to measure. Some areas on the northern side of this ridge were steep and heavily vegetated, and we could not cover and check all areas (Fig. 7.7). Our estimate of 55 residential terraces is a minimum number; the actual number could be two or three times higher. Several small architectural complexes Table 7.6.

On top of this ridge at the western base of the natural rock cliff is a small I-shaped ballcourt associated only with Monte Albán V pottery. The ballcourt location, outside the main civic-ceremonial complex at the site, corresponds to the location of two Late Postclassic ballcourts at the large hilltop terrace site of Coatecas Altas at the eastern edge of the Ejutla Valley (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2013, figure IX. la). The ballcourts at these two sites likely were built in areas where "foreigners" could be brought to the site to engage in ballgame rituals. The placement of the ballcourts at these two sites in unusual settings at the edge of their settlements may have been a practice where members of the Fig. 7.9.

"visiting team" were not trusted to enter the community's civic- ceremonial core. The next two largest Postclassic sites in the Albarradas area are TL-SLA-SLA-34 and El Trigo (TL-SLA-SLA-41). These two sites also are diametrically opposed in situation and character. TL-SLA-SLA-34 was a new community located on top of a small rock outcrop and surrounding flat terrain on the eastern slopes of the mountain ridge that is some of the best agricultural and well-watered land in the Albarradas area. On top of the outcrop was a large mound with a stone base that had been looted in the past. Like Hierve el Agua, the principal focus of this site may have been agricultural. There was no artifactual evidence of any craft activities. In contrast, El Trigo, like Llego Yiachi, had been occupied since Monte Albán Late I 106 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="113">Fig. 7.11. Site map of Nueve Puntas (TL-MAT-MAT-95). but did not reach its greatest size until Monte Albán V, when all of the two dozen terraces at the site were occupied. At the center of the site is a small platform and plaza (Fig. 7.8). Like Llego Yiachi, it also sits in a more défendable location (see Fig. 3.26). Growth in the Albarradas area and on the high mountain ridgetop that defines the eastern end of the Valley of Oaxaca coincided with significant growth at Mitla in eastern Tlacolula (Fig. 7.9). Even the surveyed ridgetop between eastern Tlacolula and the Albarradas area had 1 1 sites, eight of which were very small isolated residences. The Guirún site continued to be one of the largest communities in eastern Tlacolula, surpassed only by Mitla. In Monte Albán V, it extended farther up the slope closer to the base of Cerro Guirone and also to the north to incorporate the La Cuadrada stone quarry (see Fig. 7.3). Stone from this quarry clearly was used in the cruciform tomb at Guirún that Saville (1900, 1909) first investigated a century ago; the quarry also was one of several in the area from which stone was obtained for palace construction at Mitla (Robles García, 1994). Although the spatial extent of the site expanded in Monte Albán V, much of the occupation appears to have been dispersed (low density) so that the estimated population did not increase. At Guirún, low stone walls blocked many of the more accessible approaches to the site, including the north side of the stone quarry. The sectors of the site that were newly occupied in Monte Albán V tended to be more défendable than the parts that were settled earlier. The site was always situated to monitor/control the principal trade route into eastern Tlacolula (which passes just south of Cerro Guirone); with its northern expansion to the quarry in Monte Albán V, it also had view of another route that passes through the small mountain valley on the north side of Cerro Guirone. Guirún clearly had strong ties FEINMAN AND NICHOLAS: SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN ALBARRADAS, OAXACA, MEXICO 107</page><page sequence="114">Fig. 7.12. Residential terraces with well-preserved stone retaining walls at Nueve Puntas (TL-MAT-MAT-95). to Mitla and was a node of interaction with the Albarradas area. Monte Alban V Terrace and Defensive Sites Terrace sites continued as densely settled features of the Late Postclassic landscape in the Central Valleys of Oaxaca. Throughout highland Oaxaca, Monte Albán V sites often were defensively situated, especially in marginal or peripheral areas such as Ejutla (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 1990), Peñoles (Kowa- lewski, 1991), the Sierra Norte (Drennan, 1989), and Albarra- das; at the same time, multitudes of new communities were distributed across the valley floor and in other less défendable locations so that lower proportions of the total population resided in the hilltop settlements (Table 7.6). Hilltop sites continued to be most prevalent in the eastern and southern arms of the valley, extending into the Albarradas area to the east and into the Ejutla and Sola Valleys to the south (Fig. 7.10). These sites also may have served as periodic redoubts for select residents of more open and less défendable settlements. Defensive posture and practice differed from earlier eras when the defense of large, compact communities may have been a more broadly shared civic responsibility of community resi- dents. Fig. 7.13. Stone-lined ramped entryway (covered with leaves) to terrace at Nueve Puntas (TL-MAT-MAT-95). Fig. 7.14. Rock cliff on the southeastern side of Nueve Puntas (TL-MAT-MAT-95). Nevertheless, the persistence of hilltop terrace settlements, in défendable locations, indicates a continued concern with defense. Many of the Monte Albán V terrace sites are situated at the edges of their respective valleys. The residents of these sites may have been defending themselves from neighbors with whom they often traded but also from groups living in mountainous areas outside the valley. In Monte Albán V, settlements spilled over from the Valley of Oaxaca into neighboring areas. The physiographic limits of the Valley of Oaxaca were in many ways more permeable and open at the same time that intraregional relations continued to be factionalized, contested, and antagonistic (Feinman &amp; Nich- olas, 1999, p. 185). Many of the larger, défendable settlements faced inward into the valley, an indication of regional political decentralization and contestation (Elam, 1989). Early explorers reported at least four fortresses, or albarradas , in the vicinity of Mitla (Horcasitas &amp; George, 1955, p. 23). The possible sites that are referred to are found on both sides of the mountain ridge, in eastern Tlacolula and Albarradas. Two new sites - Nueve Puntas and Buena vista - were estab- lished on the ridgetop between eastern Tlacolula and the Albarradas area. Both are remotely situated terrace sites on the highest spots along the ridge, with excellent views to the west (inside the valley) and east (outside the valley). Nueve Puntas consists of 115 residential terraces and several long defensive walls constructed on the top and western face of three of the nine points that gives the mountain ridge its name (Fig 7.11). Parts of the walls are still 2-3 m tall today. Several deep ditches also limited access to the terraced areas. Because the site has never been plowed, the terraces are very well preserved, with house foundations and entry ramps visible on many of them (Figs. 7.12 and 7.13). The opposite, eastern side of Nueve Puntas is a stone cliff that drops more than 500 m (Fig. 7.14). Buenavista is located on top of a steep-sided peak on the long, narrow ridge between Nueve Puntas and El Tigre (Fig. 7.15), about halfway between Guirún and Nueve Puntas. The site consists of two small platforms, each associated with one small structure. One is on the highest point of the ridge and the other about 100 m down the ridge to the south. We mapped 21 small, dispersed terraces on both sides of the peak, and there were visible house foundations on and near some of the terraces (Fig. 7.16). Given the small size, remote location, and excellent visual vantage of this site, it likely was a military outpost or redoubt. 108 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="115">Fig. 7.15. View of Buenavista (TL-SLA-SLA-59), the terraced hilltop on the ridgeline at center top of image. Although fewer than a quarter of Monte Albán V settlements in the Albarradas area were terrace sites, more than 75% of population resided in these hilltop communities, the largest of which was Llego Yiachi. Many other smaller sites also were in défendable hilltop locations. Unlike the earlier défendable, often fortified sites in the Albarradas area in Monte Albán I and II, the defensively located sites in Monte Albán V were not part of multisettlement linear arrangements. There were no clear gaps in settlement or a single, aligned frontier. The inhabitants of many of the terraced and other défendable sites on the eastern slopes of Cerro Guirone in the Albarradas area, as in the valley, likely were protecting themselves as much from neighbors as from people from outlying areas. But others, especially at the northern edge of the Albarradas survey, were small and defensively located, often with several small structures or small numbers of terraces (like Buenavista). Most of these Monte Albán V sites were on ridgetops where they could monitor travel through the area, especially the northern route into the eastern arm of the Valley of Oaxaca, similar to what we had observed for the Ejutla Valley at the southern edge of the Central Valleys of Oaxaca. In the Ejutla Valley, many of the small terrace sites at the valley's edge appear to have been positioned to monitor/guard the southern and eastern borders of the Ejutla Valley. Two sets of small défendable sites - two on the south side of the pass and two on the north - were in positions to monitor the principal northern route into the eastern arm of the Valley of Oaxaca. Two small sites are located on El Portazuelo, a narrow mountain ridge located just south of the saddle where the modern highway to Mitla from the Mixe region passes. We mapped one terrace and three small cut stone structures at TL- SLA-SLA-11 (Fig. 7.17). There were several short walls on one slope that appeared to be defensive. The site had an excellent view to both the east and the west and appears to have been positioned to monitor this pass. The other site (TL-SLA-SLA- 12), on the highest point of El Portazuelo, consisted of 11 terraces and four small platforms and structures of cut stone blocks, all in linear alignment with the slope (Fig. 7.18). Downslope from this site is another very small site with only three terraces above a low defensive wall (TL-SLA-SLA-13; Fig. 7.19). On the mountain ridge just north of the pass and El Portazuelo are two small défendable sites. TL-SLA-SLA-50 consists of two small stone house foundations. At TL-SLA- SLA-51, cut stone foundation walls of one structure are visible on the surface. Both sites have great views of the surrounding area, including into the eastern end of the Tlacolula Valley. These four sites were new occupations established during the Postclassic, but to the east is another very défendable site above the pass that had been occupied since the Late Classic. TL-SLA-SLA-43 stretches along the top of a long narrow ridge between two deep barrancas near the northern edge of the surveyed area (see Fig. 6.8). The remains of eight dispersed house foundations and one terrace are visible on the surface. Settlement and Land Use in Monte Albán V In spite of tremendous demographic growth as populations in the Central Valleys of Oaxaca reached their pre-Hispanic maxima during the Late Postclassic period, archaeological populations remained far below regional capacities. Maize yields continued to increase, and populations were more evenly dispersed across the region. The inhabitants of most valley subareas could have grown more than twice the amount of food they needed to sustain themselves (Table 7.7). Even populations FEINMAN AND NICHOLAS: SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN ALBARRADAS, OAXACA, MEXICO 109</page><page sequence="116">^ - 2300 m ' I / / 2340 ^ | ' !

Site map of Buenavista (TL-SLA-SLA-59). in the Central sector were self-sufficient following the decline of Monte Albán and the shift to a more dispersed settlement pattern there. The only exception in the Valley of Oaxaca was eastern Tlacolula. Beginning in the Early Classic period, the population of eastern Tlacolula was at risk of food shortages. During the Late Classic and Postclassic, the highest population densities were in Tlacolula, especially in the easternmost part of that valley arm, and the risk of food imbalances continued (Fig. 7.20). Yet these risks were not as pronounced as they had been during the Early Classic, when the first large hilltop terrace sites were established in eastern Tlacolula. Many of the Early Classic sites were located in areas where a range of natural resources were available that could be modified into goods for exchange. The varied commercial networks that connected Tlacolula to different parts of the region were integral parts of the economy that allowed these communities to be situated in less agriculturally productive places where they produced goods to exchange for food grown elsewhere. At the edges of the valley system, settlement patterns changed in different ways that affected how much produce farmers could grow above their own needs. During the Postclassic, large settlements in Sola were situated along the principal transport corridor and not near the largest patches of good farmland (Balkansky, 2002, p. 71). In contrast to most of the Central Valleys of Oaxaca, excluding eastern Tlacolula, population in the Sola Valley was more concentrated in fewer large sites in areas of less productive farmland. As a consequence, even though the population was higher and potential per-hectare yields were higher than in the Late Classic, fewer people could have been sustained by the available labor farming near their settlements, and potential surpluses were lower than they had Table 7.7.

Exchange networks following the transport corridor between communities in Sola and beyond likely buffered the need for populations to situate on good farmland. In addition to potential food surpluses produced in neighboring areas, proximity to these networks may have been attractive for providing access to a wider range of goods. These networks of exchange were essential during dry years when populations in both Sola and Ejutla could have suffered food shortages. In contrast, the Albarradas population was more dispersed, including numerous sites, some large like Hierve el Agua, on the flatter, well-watered eastern slopes of Cerro Guirone, where large surpluses were possible. Even in low-rainfall years, these areas could have produced some surplus food to exchange with other communities. The large communities in eastern Tlacolula continued to depend on exchange for agricultural produce grown elsewhere in the valley and likely traded for agricultural surpluses from both western Tlacolula and the Albarradas area (Fig. 7.21). Even if hostilities with Macuilxochitl in western Tlacolula during the Late Postclassic (Oudijk, 2008) interfered with exchange networks across Tlacolula, the Albarradas area alone could have grown and traded sufficient crops to populations in eastern Tlacolula to overcome potential short- falls. Not only does the population of Albarradas in the Late Postclassic period appear to have had a different relationship with more central parts of the valley than did other edge regions (Sola and Ejutla), but the nature of flows between Albarradas and eastern Tlacolula may have shifted compared to earlier, with the former serving as a kind of "tortilla-basket" for the latter. Monte Albán V Summary When the Spanish arrived in highland Mesoamerica in AD 1 520, they encountered a factionalized but heavily commercial- ized landscape. Populations had grown to their highest pre- Hispanic levels; yet, except for the late emergence of the Aztec empire centered on Tenochtitlan, most of the population had reorganized into smaller competing polities following the decline of the large Classic period centers. In the resulting power vacuum and disruption of networks, small, semiauton- omous polities proliferated across the landscape as local elites seized the opportunity to assert their independence and form new networks of interaction. These competing polities were FEINMAN AND NICHOLAS: SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN ALBARRADAS, OAXACA, MEXICO 1 1 1</page><page sequence="118">' 7 TL-SLA-SLA-12 ~ ^ N / I ' 2280 m ^ ' -- j I Fig. 7.18. Site map of TL-SLA-SLA- 1 2. largely reliant on external resources, trade goods, and the spoils of war. These smaller polities competed with each other for followers, influence, and goods. Market exchange expanded, and by the end of the Postclassic there was more exchange of goods flowing in all directions across the highlands and all of Mesoamerica. These factionalized polities had permeable boundaries, were economically interdependent, and formed weak alliances with one another that did not always hold together for long. In the -Valley of Oaxaca, the Tlacolula arm was the most densely TL-SLA^ ~7 / ( H / Fig. 7.19. Site map of TL-SLA-SLA-13. settled and commercialized region. Textual accounts tell of shifting alliances throughout the Postclassic period. Yagul and Mitla were the power centers in the Early Postclassic. By later in the Postclassic period, power had been wrested from Mitla and Yagul by a new confederation of Macuilxochitl in western Tlacolula, Zaachila in northern Valle Grande, and ruling families from the Mixteca Alta. With the new confederation, there was greater Mixtee presence, especially in northern and western parts of the Valley of Oaxaca. Mixtee presence is much less evident in other parts of the valley. ¿11 Monte Albán V ^33.5%p'^^ / 38.9% 2&gt;18.3%l 86A%yl ¿20.0% n] f I J Archaeological - I J? population as % of Vl7.8%C subarea maximum V21 .3%/? potential population Fig. 7.20.

Although Mitla had somewhat declined by the Late Postclassic, it remained an important economic and religious center (Appel, 1982). Yet the foundations of Mitla's economy were never farming; they always were based on craft production and exchange. Acrimonies with Macuilxochitl and the center of the valley may have encouraged the populations of eastern Tlacolula to focus more on exchange networks to the east. Interdependencies with the Albarradas area may have been strengthened, and that region experienced a significant prolif- eration of settlement on the well-watered eastern slopes of Cerro Guirone, where large surpluses were possible. Perhaps, as a result of these shifts, the economic ties and flows between Albarradas and neighboring eastern Tlacolula were reconfig- ured during the Postclassic period in ways not evidenced earlier in the pre-Hispanic sequence. FEINMAN AND NICHOLAS: SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN ALBARRADAS, OAXACA, MEXICO 113</page><page sequence="120">Chapter 8: Conclusions "A spectre is haunting our time: the spectre of the short term." (Guldi &amp; Armitage, 2014, p. 1) Today, the Albarradas area is demographically, politically, and economically (in terms of basic production and domestic wealth) peripheral to the Valley of Oaxaca. Although we were conducting fieldwork there in the mid-1990s, local officials ignored the directive from the federal and state governments to observe daylight savings time and conducted all local business on la hora de dios. Tourists arrive to swim in the hot springs and enjoy the vistas of calcified waterfalls at Hierve de Agua; most travelers just pass through the area on their way to major market towns in the Mixe region and beyond. But for locals, the mountain ridge is hardly a barrier. Many residents of this area have relatives who live "on the other side of the mountain," and there is considerable travel between communities on both sides of the rugged terrain that separates Albarradas from eastern Tlacolula. These cross-mountain communications, intermar- riages, market participation, and even basketball tournament competitions take place although the only paved road through the Albarradas area (until the recent construction of a new superhighway to the coast) traverses the mountain pass in the northern part of the survey region. After a dispute between San Lorenzo Albarradas and Roaguia, not long after our survey, precipitated difficult passage on the road between these two communities, Roaguia, on the eastern side of the ridge, got together with Xaaga, on the western side, to build a new, narrow gravel road over a saddle in the ridge south of Cerro Guirone; the new road directly connects these communities so that travelers can avoid using the contested stretch. Although imposing, the mountain ridge that physiographi- cally defines eastern Tlacolula was not an impenetrable cultural, economic, or political boundary throughout the pre-Hispanic (and more recent) history of the area. During the Middle Formative, when first San José Mogote and then Monte Albán were the largest settlements in the valley, their leaders did not exert extensive political control. Certainly, they did not tax, directly govern, or service the Albarradas region. Nevertheless, the spatial limits of these early polities were not firmly demarcated or defined, and through networks of interaction, ceramics distinctly within the Valley of Oaxaca tradition are found across the entire valley system, including far south in Ejutla and on the eastern side of the mountains in Albarradas. Only during the Early Classic period, when the large Guirún site was established on the western slopes of Cerro Guirone while the eastern slopes were largely abandoned, was there spatial overlap between the political boundary with a physio- graphic one, yet it did not prevent interaction and interchanges between the Valley of Oaxaca and areas to the east. Even today, the boundaries of modern administrative districts do not follow the top of the ridgeline, and some of the terrain on the western side of the ridge, including major archaeological ruins in eastern Tlacolula, is administratively part of San Lorenzo Albarradas, situated on the eastern side of Cerro Guirone. The ethnic boundary between Zapotee and Mixe speakers today (and probably in the past) is farther east, beyond the Hormiga Colorada and closer to the Mixe region. Across the Valley of Oaxaca, cultural and political boundaries generally do not match physiographic ones, today or in the past. Here, we have raised the key issue of why people choose to settle where they do. The people who chose to settle near Monte Albán likely perceived advantages to their well-being by residing close to the regional capital, especially a more collectively organized capital (as in Monte Albán I, IIIA, and early IIIB-IV) that provided a range of goods and services (including a relatively pacific environment) in exchange for allotments of agricultural surplus and labor. Settlements in the Albarradas area, especially early on when eastern Tlacolula was less densely settled than most of the rest of the valley, likely were established by people who perceived the benefits of proximity to principal trade routes, even as the location of their communities in défendable locations in the rough terrain near the Hormiga Colorada indicates they were concerned about potentially hostile neighbors. The quality of agricultural land does not appear to have been the overriding factor in these early settlement decisions (although clearly it must have been taken into account). The early Formative era residents of Albarradas had access to goods that were traded along the travel route, including ceramics from the Valley of Oaxaca and goods from coastal areas, such as seashell ornaments. Given the location of many of the early sites in settings with limited agricultural options, they likely made goods for exchange from local resources, such as tools made from local chert sources. Fibers (ixtle) from xerophytic plants also were a potential trade item. Into the modern era, people from villages in the Albarradas area have continued to bring such goods to markets in Tlacolula. As populations expanded during the Early Classic and Tlacolula became one of the more densely settled areas in the valley system, much of the earlier settlement in Albarradas was abandoned as people moved to the Guirún site, on the western side of the mountain ridge, far from highly productive agricultural land. Tlacolula is in a rain shadow and the driest part of the valley, so this move reflects social/political factors, possibly the increasing importance of markets. Populations in the better- watered areas of the valley, Etla and Valle Grande, focused more heavily on agricultural surpluses that could be exchanged for goods produced elsewhere in the valley. With the fall of Monte Albán, the developing landscape of competitive cacicazgos was characterized by leaders who adopted more exclusionary political strategies. With the increasing demographic centrality of eastern Tlacolula, there was a shift in settlement in the Albarradas area to locations closer to better agricultural land. There are few opportunities for anything but rainfall farming in the Albarradas area. But the area does receive considerably more rainfall than eastern Tlacolula. During the Late Postclassic period, there are areas on the lower, flatter slopes on the eastern side of Cerro Guirone where significant agricultural surpluses could have been grown as long as the labor supply was adequate. As hostilities with Macuilxochitl emerged, the occupants of large communities in FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY N.S., NO. 46, NOVEMBER 13, 2017, PP. 115-116 115</page><page sequence="121">eastern Tlacolula, especially Mitla, may have encouraged this economic interaction to provide more reliable sources of agricultural produce. Important Postclassic tombs (Saville, 1900, 1909) that were constructed at both Xaaga and the Guirún site (both situated between Mitla and the Albarradas area) likely reflect the important socioeconomic networks that linked eastern Tlacolula and Albarradas at that time. These diachronic relations, which were not static over time and do not simply reflect the different physiographic bases of distinct parts of the valley, reaffirm our perspective that marketplace exchange was a key feature of the Oaxacan economy from, at least, the Middle Formative period (Beals, 1975; Feinman et al., 1984; Feinman &amp; Garraty, 2010; Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2010). Material identities (most evident in pottery) were shared across landscapes far broader than polity boundaries, and settlements were not established nor did they grow in strict accord with agrarian considerations. Economic interdependence, as opposed to domestic self-sufficiency, has long been the predominant adaptation in highland Mesoamer- ica (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2004b, 2012; Feinman, 2006). Throughout the pre-Hispanic sequence in highland Oaxaca, settlement continuity was greater within the Valley of Oaxaca than at (or just beyond) its physiographic limits. Fewer sites in outlying areas had long, continuous occupation compared to sites inside the valley. Settlement fluctuation over time was greater near the edges of the valley (and those areas just beyond). Networks from distant areas flowed through these edges into the Valley of Oaxaca, and communications and flows from the urban capital and other large communities dissemi- nated out. The northern, Etla arm was the most affected by events in central Mexico as first Teotihuacan and then Tenochtitlan became the largest cities in Mexico, influencing regions to their south. The small highland valleys in the Mixteca and the Sierra Norte often reflected changes that occurred in Etla. Ejutla, far to the south, was somewhat less affected by such extraregional links. Throughout most of the sequence, settle- ment trends there were similar to those in neighboring southern Valle Grande. But Ejutla did begin to recover from the population declines at the end of the Classic period earlier than did the Valle Grande. Southern trade routes into the Valley of Oaxaca pass through Ejutla, and settlement pattern changes there may reflect the increased importance of the southern trade route during the Postclassic. Sola and Miahuat- lán always were more peripheral to the Valley of Oaxaca and experienced fewer large swings in population over time. Throughout most of the pre-Hispanic sequence after the initial establishment of Monte Albán, the Albarradas area, to the east, was often more densely settled than any other edge area except during the Early Classic. With the close links between Albarradas and eastern Tlacolula, the former also experienced significant settlement discontinuities. Even though the Albarradas area is small and was never as populous as the Valley of Oaxaca, our research there has informed and refined our perspective on boundaries and interaction across the larger region. The boundaries of the Monte Albán polity (or even its spheres or degrees of control) were never static or impenetrable, nor did they conform well to physiographic features or other social and cultural boundaries. Our survey of the Albarradas area, where important trade routes pass on their way to the Valley of Oaxaca, has yielded new perspectives on these interregional exchange routes and their effects on settlement decisions on both sides of the high mountain ridge at the eastern edge of the Valley of Oaxaca. At times, eastern Tlacolula appears to have been more strongly connected to Albarradas than to the center of the valley; the physiographic boundary was no barrier to interactions with settlements in the Albarradas area that were situated to serve as conduits for the flow of goods and resources from coastal and other faraway areas into the Tlacolula arm of the valley. In sum, our cross-time examination of settlement change in Albarradas has illustrated that in the Central Valleys of Oaxaca, environmental differences or constraints are not infallible predictors of population densities, political boundar- ies, or even the specific ways that a landscape is used by the people who lived there. Rather, the traditions of people (and, crucially, the relations between them), often across broad spatial realms, helped impact and craft how local inhabitants constructed and used their spaces. These people-landscape interactions were anything but static, which reflects that the people-to-people interactions (cooperative and competitive) across communities, regions, and even wider geographic domain shifted over time. Interdependence, community, mar- ketplace exchanges, collective forms of governance, and competition between neighbors were all key elements that affected how pre-Hispanic peoples in highland Oaxaca met these challenges. These institutions and ways of cooperating leave their legacy in the lifeways and adaptations of the people of Oaxaca still today. 1 1 6 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="122">Literature Cited Abascal, R., G.

Sites are listed alphabetically by the assigned field site name. For each site, we provide general information on the environmental setting and location relative to modern villages, roads, rivers, and other topo- graphic features. We describe ' the pre-Hispanic architecture and present the number of mounds and/or terraces, the phases of occupation (phase component numbers are given in parentheses), size (in hectares), and significant artifacts, including obsidian and other chipped or ground stone, shell, greenstone, and jade. Ceramics were found on most sites, so only the absence of ceramics is noted. Mention is made, however, of special or unusual ceramics, such as figurine and urn fragments, kilnwasters, spindle whorls, sherd disks, or unusual concentrations of specific types, such as poly- chromes. TL-MAT-MAT-95 (Nueve Puntas) This single-component Monte Albán V site (V-57) site is located on the top of Nueve Puntas, the high mountain ridge that defines the southeastern edge of the Valley of Oaxaca. The site extends over an area of 9.4 ha and consists of 115 residential terraces and several long defensive walls on the top and western side of three of the nine points. Several of the walls are 2-3 m high. Part of the eastern side of the mountain is a rock cliff that drops more than 500 m. Because they have never been farmed, many of the terraces are very well preserved, with visible house foundations and ramped entries. On one very well preserved terrace, the house foundation was built directly on bedrock, with preserved walls still standing to a height of 0.5 m. Because of heavy leaf cover, there are few visible artifacts; the only diagnostics are G-3Ms. Although the site was recorded during the Guirún/ Albarradas regional survey, this settlement is in the physiographic area of eastern Tlacolula (Figs. 2.23-2.25 and 7.11-7.14). TL-MIT-CC-3 This small (1.1 ha) single-component site is located in the low piedmont 1.2 km northeast of Corral del Cerro (now called San Juan del Paso), in the small mountain valley in the northern part of the survey area. The only ceramics are Monte Albán V (V-47), mostly G-3Ms. There is a poor-quality chert outcrop approximately 500 m west of the site, and we found chipping and other chert debris on the site. TL-MIT-CC-5 This multicomponent site is located on two flat ridgetops in the middle piedmont below a hill known as El Sombrero, approximately 1.5 km north of Corral del Cerro (now called San Juan del Paso), in the small mountain valley in the northern part of the survey area. We mapped 62 terraces on the two ridges; as many as 10 more were too destroyed to map. Remains of house foundations are visible on many of the terraces. There is no central architectural complex, but several low platforms are dispersed across the site. One of the platforms had been looted in the past. The site was first settled and was largest in Monte Albán II (11-10); Monte Albán II pottery is present on all terraces and in nearby areas, covering an area of 10 ha. More than half of the Monte Albán II pottery on the surface is a local variety called Black and White (T5100), and it is possible that this ware was produced on or near the site. Consider- able chert debris indicates stone working in Monte Albán II. Special artifacts include nine pieces of obsidian and one Oliva shell. Early Classic pottery is present on only one terrace on the main ridge (IIIA-11). Monte Albán V ceramics are present on eight terraces, in two clusters on the main ridge, covering a total area of 1 ha (V-60) (Figs. 4.5-4.7, 4.10, and 4.15). TL-MIT-CC-7 This small (0.25 ha) multicomponent site is located in the middle piedmont just below a source of white chert, approximately 2 km northwest of Corral del Cerro (now known as San Juan del Paso), in the small mountain valley in the northern part of the survey area. Monte Albán Late I (LI- 4) and II (II-3) ceramics were present at this isolated residence. Two broken projectile points and other chert debris from the source indicate possible stone working. TL-MIT-CC-8 (El Nopal) This multicomponent site covers an area of 1.85 ha on the top of a high piedmont hill called El Nopal, approximately 5.5 km northwest of Corral del Cerro (now known as San Juan del Paso), in the extreme northwestern part of the survey area. The hill is very steep and heavily vegetated. The site is very défendable, with a compact complex of two platforms and five small structures arranged around a small plaza on the very top of the hill, surrounded on three sides by a stone defensive wall. On the slopes below the architectural complex are terraces that we could not map or measure, but we estimate that there were as many as 30 terraces and a few other possible houses, plus remnants of defensive walls on the north and west. Most of the collected ceramics are Monte Albán Late I (LI-9) or II (II-7). Most of the Monte Albán II pottery is the local variety of Black and White (T5100), and it is likely that this ware was made on or near the site. We used an estimate of 30 houses at the site to calculate a population of 150-300 people for those phases. Monte Albán IIIA (IIIA-7) ceramics are present but in much lower quantities; we instead used very light density to estimate the population between 19 and 46. Chert tools (especially blade/unifaces, some made from nonlocal material) and debris from diverse sources are abundant on the surface, indicating that chert working was an important economic activity (Figs. 3.32, 3.33, 4.13, and 4.16). FEINMAN AND NICHOLAS: SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN ALBARRADAS, OAXACA, MEXICO 129</page><page sequence="135">TL-SLA-SLA-8 (El Calvario) This multicomponent site extends over 7.8 ha on the top of a steep-sided hill in the middle piedmont 250 m west of the main road through San Lorenzo Albarradas. The hill is known locally as El Calvario. There is a small architectural complex of six mounds and two plazas on the top of the hill. One plaza is large and open, whereas the second plaza is much smaller and enclosed on three sides by small structures. This architectural complex is surrounded by 51 small terraces on the upper slopes of the hill. The site was largest in Monte Alban Late I (LI-11) and II (II-9), when all of the terraces were occupied. The dominant pottery in Monte Albán II is a local variety called Black and White (T5100). Monte Albán Early I (EI-2) and IIIA (IIIA-10) ceramics are present only on the top of hill and one terrace in an area of 0.5 ha. The mounds and plazas appear to have been constructed during Monte Albán Late I and II. Monte Albán V (V-59) ceramics are present only in the smaller plaza. There is a black chert source on the site, and there are dozens of pieces of worked chert on the surface. There also is a high quantity of ground stone tool fragments (almost two dozen), including manos, metates, and axes. These high quantities are indicative of chert working and the production of ground stone tools. Although these materials are found in parts of the site with ceramics from Monte Albán Early I- IIIA, they most likely pertain to Monte Albán Late I and II, when the site was largest. Ten obsidian blades and one piece of marine shell ( Oliva sp.) were collected in areas where most of the pottery is Late I and II (Figs. 3.13, 3.21, 3.23, 3.24, 4.11, and 5.5). TL-SLA-SLA-11 (El Portazuelo) This small (&lt;1 ha) single-component site is located on top of a low mountain called El Portazuelo on the northern slopes of Cerro Guirone. The mountain is on the south side of the saddle where the modern highway between Mitla and the Mixe region passes, approximately 3 km east of Corral del Cerro (as the crow flies). We mapped one terrace, but the presence of cut stone foundations of three isolated small structures indicates that there were more. There are several short defensive walls on the southern slope of the peak. The site had an excellent view in many directions, including to Mitla to the west. The site may have been a small redoubt used for monitoring the pass. The only diagnostic ceramics are Monte Albán V G-3Ms (V-3). The only other artifacts were a chert biface and a rectangular piece of onyx (Fig. 7.17). TL-SLA-SLA-12 (El Portazuelo) This small site (&lt;1 ha) is located on top of the southern peak of El Portazuelo, on the northern side of Cerro Guirone approximately 1.25 km from Guirone's peak. We mapped a linear arrangement of 1 1 terraces along the ridgetop, including four small platforms and structures containing cut stone blocks. Because of heavy leaf cover in this mountainous area, we did not see any diagnostic ceramics. The character of the site is very similar to the remains we mapped on the northern peak of El Portazuelo (TL-SLA-SLA-1 1), 400 m to the north, where we collected G-3Ms diagnostic of Monte Albán V, and other Monte Albán V sites in mountainous areas of the valley, so we designated this site as V-51 (Fig. 7.18). TL-SLA-SLA-13 This small (&lt;1 ha) single-component site is located in a small flat area on a high piedmont ridge descending the southern peak of El Portazuelo, just above the modern highway, approximately 1 km west of the turn off to San Lorenzo Albarradas. We mapped three small terraces. There is a 35-m-long defensive wall below the three terraces. The few sherds on the surface are Monte Albán V (V-4). A white chert point was found on the slope above the site. The site is situated above a black chert source (Fig. 7.19). TL-SLA-SLA-15 This small (&lt;1 ha) single-component site is located on the top of a middle piedmont hill southeast of the intersection of the main highway and the road to San Lorenzo Albarradas. Ceramics include a dozen G-3M sherds and two café sahumador handles, dating the site to Monte Albán V (V-6). We observed several obsidian blades. The most significant aspect of the site is the very high density of chert-working debris in a very small area. TL-SLA-SLA-17 (Guirún and La Cuadrada) This large (98 ha) multicomponent site is located on a series of low mountains and high piedmont ridges on the western slopes of Cerro Guirone, at the extreme eastern end of the Tlacolula Valley, approximately 5 km southeast of San Pablo Villa de Mitla. The site is just north of the mountain pass traversed by the Camino Real. The site was visited by early explorers in the 19th century (Dupaix, 1834; Ober, 1887) and has long been in the literature, known for two cruciform tombs, standing adobe walls, and a two-mound temple associated with a ballcourt complex. Marshall Saville (1900, 1909) carried out early excavations of the tombs. The size of the site was not known until it was mapped during the 1980 Tlacolula Valley survey (Kowalewski et al., 1989). During the 1995 Guirún survey project, we discovered that the site extends beyond the 1980 survey boundary, also encompassing the La Cuadrada stone quarry to the north (Holmes, 1987; Robles García, 1994), one of the quarries from which large stone blocks were cut for the palaces in Mitla. The Guirún site combines two field site numbers: TL-SLA-SLA-2 (1980) and TL-SLA-SLA-17 (1995). We completed a more complete map of the site during an intensive survey in 1996. We have published our more recent findings (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2004a) and present only a brief description here. The site consists of a minimum of 330 residential terraces dispersed across three major ridges between Cerro Guirone and the La Cuadrada quarry. The best-preserved terraces are on several lower, steep-sided ridges. The upper, flatter reaches of the site have seen much destruction by farming, and many terraces in those areas were too destroyed to be mapped. 130 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="136">Complexes of platforms or mounds are present on virtually every natural ridgetop and flat saddle of the ridge system descending the western face of Cerro Guirone. Groups of terraces are associated with most of these complexes. The most formal architecture, including the aforementioned tombs, is located on the top of two lower ridges closer to the valley floor. The earliest occupation at the site was very small; Monte Alban Late I ceramics are present only on two nearby terraces (LI- 13). The site remained small in the subsequent occupation; Monte Albán II ceramics are present on five terraces and one platform widely dispersed across all three major ridge systems (11-13-18). The site grew tremendously in the Classic period, covering 47 ha in the Early Classic (IIIA-13) and 80 ha in the Late Classic (IV- 13). Approximately 85% of the mapped terraces were occupied by the Early Classic; virtually all were occupied by the Late Classic. The extent of the area with Postclassic pottery is 98 ha, including the highest reaches of the occupied area and La Cuadrada quarry. We did not find Monte Albán V (V-62) on all the terraces (about 83%), and except for the El Paderón part (the area with the standing adobe walls) of the site, Postclassic ceramics are sparse in many other areas, indicating a more dispersed settlement in Monte Albán V. Exotic materials include obsidian from a range of sources and a small greenstone pendant carved in the form of a human face. We observed extensive working of chert and other stone materials into a range of diverse objects; chert debris and tools were spread across all sectors of the site. There are at least three chert sources on the site and one basalt source nearby (Figs. 2.14-2.20, 5.9-5.13, and 7.4). TL-SLA-SLA-19 This multicomponent site is located on a middle piedmont slope in the mountains at the eastern edge of Tlacolula, approximately 300 m west of the mountain pass south of Cerro Guirone, near the route of the Camino Real. The site is on the southern side of the Camino Real, less than 300 m east of Guirún (which is north of the route). Together, these two sites could have monitored traffic entering and leaving the Valley of Oaxaca. The site was heavily plowed in the past; we could see remains of more than 15 small house foundations, but they were too destroyed to map. We mapped only one terrace but suspect that there were more. There are few artifacts but one piece of obsidian. The site was largest (4.9 ha) in Monte Albán IIIA (IIIA-2) and IV (IV-3). The site was a much smaller, isolated residence (&lt;.25 ha) in Monte Albán V (V-9). TL-SLA-SLA-20 (Loma de las Tumbas) This multicomponent site covers an area of 5.6 ha on the top of a défendable knob near the end of long narrow piedmont ridge that descends to the Hormiga Colorada from the eastern side of El Tigre, the high mountain ridge in eastern Tlacolula between Cerro Guirone and Nueve Puntas. The site is located approximately half the way between the road to Roaguia and the Hormiga Colorada and has an excellent view in all directions. The Camino Real passes just south of this site. There are two small, adjacent plazas on the top of the knob; the larger plaza has two mounds at opposite ends. Just west of the small plazas are the remains of 12 small house foundations; many have visible tombs, several of which were looted. Descending the slopes below on the west, south, and east are 28 terraces. We found Monte Albán Late I (LI-7) and II (II-5) ceramics across the entire site, including dozens of Black and White (T5100) sherds and half a dozen cremas or imitation cremas. One terrace near the top also was occupied in Monte Albán IIIA (IIIA-5) and V (V-55). We recorded an unusually high number of special artifacts, including seven shell ornaments, two stone beads, and lapidary debris. The shell ornaments include a fragment of Pinctada mazatlanica , a Thais triangularis whole-shell bead, two Olivella sp. whole- shell beads, an Oliva porphyria pendant, a Spondylus sp. tubular bead, and a gastropod pendant cut in the shape of an animal head. Three dozen pieces of chert, including bifaces, cores, and debris, indicate stone working in Monte Albán Late I and II. There also are at least 10 manos and hammerstones but only two pieces of obsidian (Figs. 3.27, 3.28, 4.8, 4.9, and 4.12). TL-SLA-SLA-22 (Sitio de las Tunas) This multicomponent site covers an area of 5.2 ha on a middle piedmont slope on the eastern side of El Tigre about half the way between San Lorenzo and Roaguia, approxi- mately 600 m east of the road. The site is known locally as Sitio de las Tunas. There are six small structures and a small plaza in the center of the site, which are surrounded by at least eight terraces on the west and south. The site has been plowed, destroying additional terraces and house foundations. The entire site is Monte Albán Late I (LI-8) and II (II-6). All of the structures and most of the terraced slope also were occupied in Monte Albán V (V-56). Only two terraces were occupied in Monte Albán IIIA (IIIA-6). We noted a dozen pieces of worked chert and flakes including four cores, nine pieces of obsidian, one ground stone ax, and three pieces of marine shell (Fusinus dupetitthouarsi). The chert working could pertain to Monte Albán Late I, II, and/or V. Although there is an onyx source 25 m to the south, we did not find any of this material on the site (Fig. 3.29). TL-SLA-SLA-23 This small (&lt;0.5 ha) single-component Monte Albán IIIB- IV (IV-4) site is located on a middle piedmont knob on the eastern side of El Tigre, less than 100 m east of the road to Roaguia, approximately 1.5 km north of the village. The site consists of one small structure and several destroyed, unmapped terraces. Ceramics are sparse, but high amounts of white chert debris on the north side of the structure indicate chert working. TL-SLA-SLA-24 (Hierve el Agua) This large multicomponent site is located on the eastern side of the Nueve Puntas mountain ridge near the modern village of Roaguia, in a middle piedmont area that flattens out at the FEINMAN AND NICHOLAS: SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN ALBARRADAS, OAXACA, MEXICO 131</page><page sequence="137">base of the mountain ridge before plunging down to the deeply incised Hormiga Colorada to the east. The area around Roaguia has some of the best agricultural resources in the region. Although very accessible from the north, the promontory where the site is located is extremely défendable from the south and has an excellent view in all directions. The site is well known for its natural springs, terraces, and fossilized canals (Flannery et al., 1967). It has long been debated whether these features were used primarily for agriculture (Flannery et al., 1967; Neely et al., 1990) or for salt production (Hewitt et al., 1987; Peterson et al., 1989). Today, part of the site is an official archaeological zone that is open to the public. The site has been heavily impacted by modern farming and tourism, and there is very little preserved architecture. We mapped several small buildings in the northern, flatter part of the site, where we found only Monte Albán IIIB-IV and V ceramics. We found ceramics from all phases near one small mound on the tip of a long, steep ridge that extends south of the archaeological zone. We mapped three terraces that appear to be residential; many others were too destroyed to map or clearly were agricultural. The site was first occupied during Monte Albán Late I (LI- 5), covering 13 ha in the southern part of the site near the springs and the archaeological zone. It was about half that size (6.5 ha) in Monte Albán II (II-4). We did not find any diagnostic Early Classic pottery. The site grew substantially in Monte Albán IIIB-IV (IV- 10, 86 ha), expanding onto the more gentle slopes to the north, and then reached its greatest extent in Monte Albán V (V-53), when it covered an area of 97 ha. We did not see many artifacts other than pottery, mostly chert tools and debris and half a dozen pieces of obsidian. There is an onyx quarry nearby (Figs. 2.21, 2.22, and 6.9- 6.13). Tl-SLA-SLA-27 (Cerro del Rio) This multicomponent site covers an area of 3.8 ha on the top of a bedrock outcrop on a small knob at the end of a long middle piedmont ridge descending from El Tigre. The knob is encircled on three sides by a sharp bend in the Hormiga Colorada and is known locally as Cerro del Rio. The site is clearly défendable. The highest part of the site consists of a large plaza with one small structure at either end. There is a compact grouping of 12 terraces on the southern side of the plaza, although plowing may have destroyed as many as a dozen more on both sides of the knob. The lowest terrace has a very high, defensive retaining wall. Monte Albán Late I ceramics (LI-6) are present across the entire site. Only one terrace also had Monte Albán V ceramics (V-54). The site is near a white/orange chert source, and chert debris is visible on most terraces. There is a source of ground stone on the site and many manos and metate fragments. Both materials may have been worked on the site in Monte Albán Late I (Figs. 3.30 and 3.31). TL-SLA-SLA-29 This single-component site covers 5.3 ha of agricultural fields on a broad middle piedmont slope approximately 1 km northeast of Hierve el Agua and 500 m east of the road. All ceramics were Monte Albán V (V-14), including several G-3M sherds. Worked chert debris was present across the site. TL-SLA-SLA-34 This large (37 ha) single-component site is located on broad, flat terrain in the middle piedmont on the eastern side of Cerro Guirone, approximately 600 m east of San Lorenzo. The site consists of a large scatter of Monte Albán V ceramics (V-19). We mapped one large mound constructed on top of a natural rock outcrop near the center of the sherd scatter. The mound had been looted. There are eight modern agricultural terraces but no clear evidence of ancient ones. There is very little chert on the site, which is located in one of the better agricultural areas in the survey region. Of the three obsidian blades we observed, two are green, most likely from the Pachuca source in Hidalgo. TL-SLA-SLA-36 This single-component site covers an area of 9 ha on gently sloping terrain in the middle piedmont on the eastern side of San Lorenzo. The site is heavily impacted by modern activities, including some terracing. The site consists of a scatter of Monte Albán V ceramics (V-21) and five green obsidian blades. TL-SLA-SLA-41 (El Trigo) This multicomponent sites covers an area of 2.8 ha on the top and southern slope of a small piedmont knob on a middle piedmont ridge descending the eastern slope of Cerro Guirone, 500 m east of the road to San Lorenzo Albarradas. The site is known locally as El Trigo. The northern and eastern sides of the hill are very steep and défendable. We mapped 23 terraces, two small structures, and one plaza. The terraces surround the architecture on the west, south, and east. While pottery from Monte Albán Late I through IIIB-IV is dispersed across the entire site (LI- 12, 11-11, IIIA-12, IV- 12, V-61), we observed much more Monte Albán V pottery. All the terraces appear to have been occupied in Monte Albán V, and on seven terraces we also observed IIIB-IV pottery. Ceramics on some terraces are undiagnostic. It is not clear whether earlier use of the terraces is hidden by the higher density of later materials on the surface or whether earlier, possibly unterraced deposits were exposed during the con- struction of the terraces in Monte Albán V. We conservatively used very light density to estimate Monte Albán Late I-IIIA populations at the site; populations could be somewhat higher if any of the terraces were occupied then. We used terrace density for Monte Albán IV aïid the full number of terraces for Monte Albán V. There are more than two dozen pieces of chert-working debris, including several cores, and 10 pieces of ground stone, including manos, hammerstones, abraders, and one basalt ax. Much of this activity may pertain to Monte Albán V. We also collected 14 pieces of obsidian including one gray core, two pieces of polished onyx, two pieces of marine 132 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="138">shell, and several drilled sherd disks made from G-3M body sherds (Figs. 3.25, 3.26, and 7.8). TL-SLA-SLA-43 This small (&lt;1 ha) multicomponent site is located on the top of a long narrow ridge in the middle piedmont, approximately 1 km north of the road to the Mixe region near its intersection with the road to San Lorenzo. The défendable ridgetop is located between two barrancas; the northern one is very deep, called the Barranca Honda. We mapped one clear terrace and eight small house foundations dispersed on the ridgetop. At least one house had been looted. The site was occupied in Monte Albán IIIB-IV (IV-9) and V (V-50). The only artifacts other than sparse pottery are a few chert tools, one chert core, and one piece of un worked onyx. There are several onyx sources on lower slopes of the ridge (Fig. 6.8). TL-SLA-SLA-50 This small (&lt;0.25 ha) single-component site is located on the top of a mountain ridge on the northern side of the saddle (between Cerro El Portazuelo and Cerro El Mogote) where the modern road to the Mixe region passes. The site's location is very défendable and has a great view of Cerro Guirone to the south and El Trigo to the southeast. The site may have been a lookout or outpost. We mapped two small stone house foundations. Sparse ceramics are Monte Albán V (V-32). TL-SLA-SLA-51 This small site (&lt;0.25 ha) is located on the easternmost tip of the mountain ridge on the north side of the pass (between Cerro El Portazuelo and Cerro El Mogote), approximately 200 m southeast of TL-SLA-SLA-50. The site is very défendable, with great views in all directions - west into the Tlacolula Valley and east toward the Mixe region. The only visible remains are the cut stone foundation walls of a small building, possibly a military outpost. Leaf cover made finding sherds difficult, but the similarity of the architectural remains and nearness to TL-SLA-SLA-50 indicate Monte Albán V (V- 33). TL-SLA-SLA-52 This multicomponent site covers 2.9 ha of low terrain between the confluence of the Hormiga Colorada and a small stream that flows into the San Luis tributary of the Tehuantepec River, along the route of the Camino Real. Most of the ceramics on the site are early. We found Monte Albán Early I (EI-1) ceramics over the whole site; the extent of earlier material (Rosario phase, R-l) is smaller, covering an area of 1 .9 ha. This is the earliest site we recorded in the survey region. There is a smaller area (&lt;1.0 ha) with Monte Albán V ceramics (V-34) and also some colonial pottery around a structure that appears to also be colonial. The site is littered with chert debris, utilized flakes, and several cores; chert working could pertain to both Monte Albán Early I and V. We observed only two pieces of obsidian (Figs. 3.4 and 3.12). TL-SLA-SLA-53 (Llego Yiachi) This large (92 ha) multicomponent site is located on the top and slopes of a steep natural rock cliff on the eastern bank of the Hormiga Colorada. Its local name is Llego Yiachi. Because of the steepness of many of the slopes around Llego Yiachi and significant vegetation, we could not check all of the surrounding area, but where we could we mapped tall stone defensive walls and 55 residential terraces. The tallest, best- preserved stone defensive walls are on the eastern side of Llego Yiachi, near the easiest approach to the top of the hill. In addition to the terraces we could map, dozens of others were too poorly preserved to map. The total number of terraces at the site could easily be two or three times the number we were able to map. There are several small architectural complexes dispersed across the lower slope between Llego Yiachi and the Hormiga Colorada, but the principal architectural complex is on the very top of the rock cliff that towers above the rest of the site. This complex consists of a linear arrangement of three small patio-mound groups, a larger plaza surrounded by a low wall, and a large platform on which stood a long rectangular building with adobe walls, similar to the adobe walls in several palaces at the Mitla Fortress (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2004a, figure 3.4). Like the palaces at Mitla, the building with the adobe walls may not have been constructed until near the end of the occupation. A small tomb in one of the small plazas had been recently looted. There is a small I-shaped ballcourt (approximately 20 X 20 m) at the base of the western side of the rock cliff, where we observed only Monte Albán V pottery. The site is not just a military outpost. The site was occupied from Monte Albán Late I through V. Monte Albán Late I (LI- 10) and II (II-8) ceramics are present only on the top of Llego Yiachi. The site was much larger in the Classic period (IIIA-8, IV-11) covering approximately 37 ha on the top and lower eastern slopes. At the western edge of the ridge system, right above the Hormiga Colorada, is another small area of Monte Albán IIIA pottery associated with several small structures (IIIA-9). Monte Albán V (V-58) ceramics are the most widespread, extending over an area of 92 ha, including all of the mapped terraces and structures. Artifacts are sparse but include several mano and metate fragments, a dozen chert tools and debris, six obsidian blades and one core, and five crystals. Most of the obsidian is green (Pachuca). There are several G-3M kilnwasters on the eastern slope of the hill, so there is possible ceramic production in Monte Albán V (Figs. 2.26, 2.27, 5.6-5.8, and 7.5-7.7). TL-SLA-SLA-56 This small (&lt;0.25 ha) site is located in a low rocksheiter on the northern bank of the Hormiga Colorada, below Llego Yiachi. The roof of the cave is heavily sooted. Recent activities and looting exposed pottery from Monte Albán II (II- 1), IIIB- IV (IV-7), and V (V-37). There is chert debris in front of the cave but very little inside. We found one cut piece of conch shell inside the rocksheiter. The cave may have been a sacred FEINMAN AND NICHOLAS: SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN ALBARRADAS, OAXACA, MEXICO 133</page><page sequence="139">location for a longer duration than we could document from the exposed surface artifacts. TL-SLA-SLA-59 (Buenavista) This single-component site is located in eastern Tlacolula and covers an area of 2.9 ha on the top of a steep-sided peak (called Buenavista) on the narrow ridgeline between El Tigre Appendix II: Grid Square Maps We extended the system of 4 X 4-km grid squares that was established for the Valley of Oaxaca east into the Albarradas area. This appendix consists of maps for each grid square that show the location and boundaries of each phase component for every site that was identified during the and Nueve Puntas. The site is very défendable, with great views in all directions. There is a small platform and structure on the very top and another small platform and structure approximately 100 m down the southern slope (both areas had looter's pits). We mapped 21 small, dispersed terraces on the northern and southern slopes of the peak. Stone house foundations are visible on many of the terraces. Other possible terraces were too destroyed to map. The only pottery is Monte Albán V (V-52) (Figs. 7.15 and 7.16). settlement pattern survey of the Guirun/ Albarradas region. Each grid square measures 4X4 km and is numbered in the lower left corner.

We have made modifications to some categories and have changed data presentation to make the files easier to read and use. Data for all phase components were entered into Excel files and are presented below in four parts. The first part (a) includes site size (in ha), population, and occupational continuity; the second part (b) contains artifact information; the third part (c) presents architectural and other cultural features; and the fourth part (d) presents environmental and modern land use information. Each phase component is on a separate line. General descriptions of all field-numbered sites with at least one mound, terrace, or other significant feature are included in Appendix I. Population, site size, and architectural features have been updated for all components of the Guirún site, but artifact categories include only those collected during the regional survey (for materials collected during the intensive site survey, see Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2004a, pp. 81-86). Coding Scheme Each file begins with five columns that are used to identify each site. The first column (area) is the area prefix. The area prefix for the Guirún/Albarradas survey region is 7 (0-6 were used to identify survey regions in Oaxaca and Ejutla). The second column (phase) is the phase number. We used the Oaxaca numbering system and omitted the numbers for phases that we did not identify in the Guirún/Albarradas survey region (4 = Rosario, 5 = Monte Albán Early I, 6 = Monte Albán Late I, 7 = Monte Albán II, 8 = Monte Albán IIIA, 10 = Monte Albán IV, and 1 1 = Monte Albán V). The third column (no.) is the site number. This numbering system restarts at one for each phase. When referred to in the text, the site number is preceded by the phase abbreviation for that phase. The fourth column (subarea) designates the subarea of the valley where the site is located (AL for Albarradas and ET for eastern Tlacolula). The fifth column (grid) is the grid square in which the site is located. Each grid square number consists of a north component (6-10) and an east component (17-20). When site boundaries extend beyond the limits of a grid square, the site is assigned to the square containing the largest proportion of the site. The grid numbering system is an extension of the grid employed in the Valley of Oaxaca regional survey. A. Population data.

Appendix IV.A presents information on each mapped terrace, IV. B on each mapped structure (mound) and platform, IV. C on each mapped plaza, and IV. D on each mapped house foundation that was not part of a defined terrace (unless noted otherwise). The terrace and structure information for the Guirún site was updated during the intensive site survey in 1996 and has been published (Feinman &amp; Nicholas, 2004a, appendix 5), so we do not include the Guirún site in these appendices. All other sites are listed by field site number. Phases of occupation are indicated by phase component numbers. The subarea column denotes whether the site is in the Albarradas area (AL) or in eastern Tlacolula (ET).
