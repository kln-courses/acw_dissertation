<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jewish Tradition as/and the Other* Geoffrey H. Hartman If there are limits to human understanding, it is not surprising that we have trouble with traditions and modes of life that differ from ours. The "other" is what we do not understand - or understand too well as a fearful, repressed potentiality in ourselves. Yet only with historicism did the "other" begin to accrue a moral pathos. Herder's anthology, Voices of the Nations, was the earliest book that gathered under one cover the panoramic achievements of the Family of Man. We are the World; our universalism, however, in the area of sympathy supply as well as food supply, is so precarious that only extreme disaster - star- vation, genocide - makes us aware of another people's struggle for survival. It is hard enough to live with persons we know; we forget there was a time we didn't know them, that they too were strangers who had to be brought into the family circle; and insofar as psychic or social en- ergies are involved, they are then expended to preserve that familarity, to prevent alliances or types of behavior that might revive our fear of the alien. Social ethics develop in that context; crucial questions about claims of national or cultural difference (Israel and the Nations) or internal differentiation (priests and people, male and female, sacred and profane). The philosophy of history and historical or literary scholar- ship may seem too academic to make much difference in this struggle for differentiation. Yet a thinker like Hegel has the nerve to link a culture's social practises directly to its ideas about God. In what follows I want to begin with Hegel's ambitious view of what he calls "world- historical" cultures, as they struggle for and against a defining sense of the other and the alien. * A short version of this essay was the keynote address to the Central Conference of American Rabbis' Convocation on "The Academic Study of Judaism and the Reform Rabbinate".

Hartman JSQ 1 Hegel on Judaism The contemporary thinker who takes religious symbols and struc- tures seriously is led toward cultural anthropology, or Paul Tillich's "theology of culture".1 Hegel, however, to achieve his vast historical generalizations, began with religion rather than culture, and derived from it an ancient "culture of theology". Yet because of the European Renaissance, and a later, specifically German revival of the Classics - including, through Winckelmann, Classical art, - Hegel did not look at Greek culture as primarily a theology, or a totally alien metaphysics. Indeed, one could view his entire project, his "Geistesgeschichte," as a Philo-like reconciliation of ancient Greek with modern German thought. That Philo himself received scant attention in Hegel's History of Philosophy has something to do with the problem of the other as it affects intellectual history.2 Hegel's engagement with the theme of otherness is familiar through the master/bondsman dialectic singled out by Koj√®ve3 as the central, paradigmatic section of the Phenomenology. The German philosopher's analysis of how the master is compelled to recognize serf or slave made its way into French philosophy of the post World War II era as a contribution to both existentialist and social thought. In Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, the "other" becomes a charged motif pointing to the psychological but also political task of acknowledging the humanity of the outsider. Despite Hegel's historicist emphasis on the integrity and even grandeur of earlier cultures, Judaism had two strikes against it: Hel- lenism as well as Christianity. If a single nostalgia were permitted, Hegel wrote, it would be for a Classical Greece where Germans still feel at home. His orientation toward Greece aborts a tradition that is still alive (Judaism) while representing as alive a dead though historically influential culture (Hellenism). 1 The Theology of Culture (New York: Oxford, 1959). The aim of the volume, Tillich says in his "Foreword", is "to show the religious dimension in many special spheres of man's cultural activity". 2 The neglect of Philo was not restricted to the Christian side. His syncretism was neglected by both Jewish-oriented and Greek-oriented thought. Eduard Norden's astonished rediscovery of Philo in a lecture to the Berlin academy in 1923 (though not published till thirteen years after the scholar's death) is symptomatic. See Das Genesiszitat in der Schrift vom Erhabenen (Berlin: Akademie- Verlag, 1955). 3 Hegel's concept has permeated our social philosophy so thoroughly that Charles Taylor (a scholar of Hegel) can adapt the notion of recognition to ethics without a complicated exposition. See Multiculturalism and "The Politics of Recognition ", ed. Amy Gutman (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992).</page><page sequence="3">JSQ 1 Jewish Tradition as /and the Other 91 Greece, then, is the one culture that is not other. To Greece is as- cribed the beginning of philosophy, and of history as the story of human self-emancipation. The Greeks achieved philosophy and liberty by overcoming two kinds of otherness: the mind's fear of itself, and its fear of what was foreign to it - nature, different cultures. Like bees culling nectar, the Greeks converted every foreign influence or impulse so completely that it seemed reborn from themselves. This transcen- dence of internal division and external debts defines their lasting greatness and originality.4 Thus Hegel not only acknowledges otherness but links a culture's importance to the way it deals with the other, and describes human progress in terms of a delayed homecoming: an Odyssey that leads a consciousness overwhelmed by history to gradually recognize its own worth without an unrealistic denial of the worth of others. At the same time, the historical difference of Greece from Germany is covered up. Hegel claims he understands Greek culture as if it were his own - as if he had invented it. Yet Judaism he certainly does not understand. No Church Father ever produced a more articulate and sustained misrepresentation. His lofty slander contains, however, an important acknowledgement. Let me try and separate the acknowledgement from the slander. Hegel's focus is on the Bible's image of God as utterly transcendent. He even exaggerates the originality of Judaism in this regard. Jehovah, "das reine Eine" (pure singleness), constitutes a definitive break be- tween West and East. For the first time in history spirit returns into itself, understands its own character, and is affirmed as a fundamental principle, one that annuls Oriental representations of Nature as a di- vinity. Thus the Hebrew God, though master of Nature, has no affinity with it; and Abraham's conduct embodies this abstract and purely negative position.5 Israel's first patriarch is a stranger on earth, living at enmity with it. "Abraham did not want to love." No positive reconciling movement toward nature is available. All relations between the Jews and the world are characterized by the dominance of an abstract God and their own 4 See, especially, "The Greek World" in the lectures published from notes and manuscripts as The Philosophy of History. Also related portions in his History of Philosophy. 5 The section on "The Spirit of Judaism" in Hegel's Early Theological Writings is my main source for this summary.

Hartman JSQ 1 passivity; Jews remain slaves who need an imposed law. How insulated from actual Jews, their customs, the way they understood them, Hegel must have been in order to write of the Sabbath: "Slaves doubtless welcome this rest from work, a day for doing nothing. ... [T]hat ... free, living persons should spend a whole day doing nothing, maintaining an inert unity of spirit, consecrating this time as empty time, and having it return so often, could only have occurred to the legislator of a people for whom a sad, emotionally passive unity is the highest value, and who regards the six active days expended by its God in the creation of new life and a new world as a self-alienating depletion [fremdes Heraus- gehen] requiring this recuperative rest". The adverse power of intellect in such depictions, and the salutary shock to conventional pieties it may give, can be honored; but not a self-exculpatory vein that deprives the Jews of any present role in history and blames them for being victims. What it amounts to is, quite simply, that they are guilty for not being Christian and also for not being Greek. The unfortunate condition of the Jews stems from their negative conception of God as an infinite power set invincibly against everything. They are likened to Shakespeare's Macbeth: "The fate of the Jewish people is the fate of Macbeth, who stepped out of nature itself, attached himself to foreign beings, and, in their service, had to trample down and murder everything holy in human nature, abandoned by his gods, and crushed by his own belief". Hegel was ignorant of all Jewish writing after the Bible except for a smattering that seemed to have philosophical potential: a minimal appreciation of Philo, rudimentary notions about the Kabbalah, and a polemic understanding of Mendelsohn's Jerusalem. Zunz's pioneer work establishing a "Wissenschaft des Judentums" is a generation away; even had Hegel become acquainted, through Zunz, with the homilies of the rabbis it is doubtful he would have appreciated the vitality of their engagement with the text. His residual Christian triumphalism showed no sympathy with the "crippled form" of the contemporary Judaism he thought he saw; only Bible, Psalms and Prophets spoke to him of an original and heroic intuition. But this he acknowledged; with the corollary, however, that it proved too strong for the people who were its messengers. They became an abject other, frozen by their own image of a purely negative, antithetical God.6 6 For a more nuanced presentation of Hegel on Judaism, see pp. 103-47 in Emil L. Fackenheim, To Mend the World: Foundations of Post-Holocaust Jewish Thought (New York: Schocken, 1989). Hegel's historicism, however condescending, his dialec- tics of spirit or mind, leads to a second acknowledgment, one intended to explain how</page><page sequence="5">JSQ 1 Jewish Tradition as /and the Other 93 Modern Judaic Studies My second example is quite different and takes us into Judaic Stud- ies. Misconception this time is not based on ignorance or disregard but on respect and scholarly knowledge. The scruple concerning otherness derives from a particular aspect of the tradition - understanding the prophets in a post-prophetic age. Hebrew prophecy, anchoed in a personal receiver, and often a dra- matic scene of commission, haunts us with the image of otherness. Even jaded modern readers, Michael Fishbane writes, are "overcome by the august formulations of language that are found here; by the eerie otherness but explosive immediacy of the divine presence which dra- matically unfolds in these visions; and by ... images which radiate through the texts as the literary vapors of shattering religious experien- ces".7 He emphasizes the disruptive, renovative, originary structure of the prophetic event: "...the suddenness and transforming character of these experiences suggests that they were not the climax of spiritual or contemplative exercises, or the inheritance of some spiritual lineage". Hebrew prophecy, according to Fishbane, can be distinguished from earlier as well as later manifestations by this incursion of the absolutely other. Fishbane seems to adapt Rudolf Otto's description of a myste- rium tremendum as over-riding all other concerns, epistemological, professional, moral. And, like Hegel, he sees a Biblical break with Near Eastern myth in this "creator God who is utterly Other." Yet his conclusion is that prophecy has a bridging, covenanting function; he notes, among a welter of complexities arising from the "deep abyss at the heart of Israel's rupture with mythic consciousness," a "paradoxical divine concern for human acknowledgment..." As a scholar Fishbane desires specificity, which allows him to dis- tinguish events within the prophetic tradition; and particularity, which allows him to differentiate Israel's religion from Near Eastern cults. Yet despite such clear and commendable aims, a basic question must be raised concerning this description of the otherness of Judaism and in Judaism. such a cold religion could nevertheless lead to Christianity: "Since religion ... is of the spirit, it may be ever so erroneous, yet it contains the Affirmative - a stunted, abstract truth, yet Truth. In this sense there is a divine presence in every religion, a relation of divine love" (Philosophy of History), quoted by Fackenheim, p. 114. 7 All Michael Fishbane quotations from "Biblical Prophecy as a Religious Pheno- menon", in Jewish Spirituality: From the Bible through the Middle Ages, ed.

We have a portrait of the prophet but not of the astounded reader - indeed no theory of how a reader would get out from under the experience of shattering otherness to formulate so just an appreciation as Fishbane's own. And even if we accept his depiction of the Hebrew prophet, how do we account for the fact that it differs from both Hegel and Otto on the question of otherness? The "divine concern for human acknowledgment" in the Bible is a paradox only if God is the absolute other. Otto claims that such fearful numinosity is universal, not at all peculiar to Judaism; most of his instances, indeed, come from the Far East. To ascribe that characteristic pre-eminently to the Hebrew prophets may be to particularize them falsely, as if they had cornered the market on the reception of otherness. Hegel, for his part, appropriates "God acknowledges mankind" for Christianity; he does not say that God is absolutely other but that Biblical Judaism represents him as this totally antithetical and tran- scendent being, and that the Jews became victims of their own belief. Historians of spirituality cannot afford the suspicion that their work merges with Jewish apologetics, either by claiming for Judaism a special experience of otherness, or by emphasizing its opposite, the near- Hasidic pathos of "God needs Man". Not that I object to the Hasidic point of view. But if it is true, then there are radical consequences that point to human theurgic powers, as well as to "the covenantal prin- ciple". Recent research on the Kabbalah has placed in a sharper light statements about the pious as activists who augment God. "What is meant by 'men of deeds'? As in the saying: 'Whoever keeps my com- mandments, I regard as if he has made me...'" (Sefer ha-Yihud, 13th century).8 God made humanity in his image, so humanity can either augment or diminish that image, augment or diminish God. These no- tions throw a retrospective light on episodes where God allows Himself to be argued with. Even Job's complaints and the hesitations of the prophets could be considered as a drawing out - into self-relevation - of the divine. "How odd of God to choose the Jews." But if he chooses them because he needs them, it makes no sense to posit a reader who is overwhelmed by the prophetic portions of Scripture. For that would accredit the prophet at the expense of the reader, in that only the 8 For a fuller exposition, see Moshe Idel, Kabbalah: New Perspectives (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1988). There are earlier midrashic hints, e. g. Sifre Deut. 346.</page><page sequence="7">JSQ 1 Jewish Tradition as /and the Other 95 prophet and not the reader is capable of the human labor that saved this experience as a text for the community, even for God Himself. Too great a distance opens up between the prophetic and the post-prophetic; and this piety of distanciation is surely not the piety of "God needs the human" which views the reader as a theurgic activist. I don't know whether God needs man or woman, but in Judaism He certainly needs the text. It should be clear that I consider Michael Fishbane an important scholar, and that I am only concerned with the implication for Jewish Studies of a contradictory concept of spirituality. The concept mag- nifies the experience of otherness, as if it wished to build a fence be- tween sacred and profane, a fence that could unintentionally become a barrier to secular Jewish Studies. But it also emphasizes God's ac- knowledgment of the human world, which extends from the immediate call or commissioning of the prophets to the great chain of transmission and interpretation passing through sopherim and sages to the present. Perhaps some contradiction of otherness and intimacy cannot be avoided: Fishbane, in fact, because he focusses on the paradox of a "divine concern for human acknowledgment", devotes much of his later scholarship to hermeneutic procedures that underwrite the neglected "work of myth" present not only in Kabbalah but also in prekabbalistic midrash. This midrash often depicts God's tears and lamentations with an extraordinary pathos of its own, deploying all the resources of a linguistic and hypostatic fantasy in order to capture the sense of an active, two-way interchange between "above" and "below".9 Nothing is gained, however, by positing a reader overcome by the magic of the recorded experience or its "literary vapors". For what distinguishes Judaism, as Fishbane himself shows, is the hermeneutic 9 See especially Fishbane's remarkable "The Holy One Sits and Roars': Mytho- poesis and the Midrashic imagination", The Journal of Jewish Thought and Philosophy, 1 (1991), 1-21. Fishbane now moves away from stressing the Hebrew Bible's "break with mythology" or "primary rupture with the world of myth and mythmaking". But his main emphasis is to deny that this break "has widened appreciably over the centuries" - i. e. through the anti-anthropomorphic purity of classical Midrash. Idel suggests more radically (and revising Scholem) that Kabbalah may have coexisted with rabbinical midrash, going back to the Tannaim or even to an archaic Judaism of which we have only traces. Criticism of the mythic or fabulous qualities of aggadah becomes a familiar feature in Karaite, then Islamic and also (under Christian, Islamic or philosophic pressures) Jewish circles. But the objections merely demonstrate how mythic the aggadah of the Sages was, and how difficult it proved to get around that fact. See, inter alia, "The Aggadah: Problem and Challenge", in Marc Saperstein, Decoding the Rabbis: A Thirteenth-Century Commentary on the Aggadah (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1980).</page><page sequence="8">96 Geoffrey H. Hartman JSQ 1 character of its spirituality, rather than a special structure deep within spiritual experience itself. Even if there were such a structure - the covenantal relation, for example, - it becomes accessible through a text that encourages an interpretive rather than ecstatic practise, without totally separating the one from the other. Scripture, in Judaism, not only expresses the covenant: it is, as text, the covenantal relation par excellence. Exactly when the hermeneutical turn occurred is difficult to say, but Rabbinic Judaism consolidated it. Perhaps creating a text like the Bible already involved that frame of mind. Stories like the Akedah demand interpretation; the persons portrayed are in relative darkness and must find their way; and the readerly community participates in that venture. Interpretability "becomes a general method for perceiving reality" and every new historical experience is subject to it.10 Moreover, because Scripture, owing to Ezra's reforms, was to be "distinctly read" and made intelligible to the people (Nehemiah 8), some glosses seem to have entered the text during the process of transmission. This inner revision and elaboration - carefully studied in Fishbane's magisterial book on the subject - may have saved the text from foundering into mystery or unintelligibility.11 The talmudic axiom, Malachi zeh Ezra, the last prophet is the first sopher or bookman, legitimates the daring post- prophetic and exegetic labor of the Sages. This way of handling the transition to a post-prophetic age reminds us of a fact and a hope. The fact is that Judaism remains the unac- knowledged "other" in Western or socalled Judeo-Christian tradition - a tradition almost unaffected, after Pauline typology, by Jewish ex- egesis, and rehellenized by the revival of the Classics in the Renaissance, their absorption into Christianity (or vice-versa). The hope is that modern Judaic Studies, in defining a Jewish via hermen√™utica, will open the possibility for another and different kind of Renaissance. This emphasis is not a matter of pride or ethnicity but of intellectual and spiritual equity. It recalls how much of the Jewish learning-tra- dition has been neglected. There is a vast corpus, dwarfing that of the Classics, which is only beginning to be known in the university. This 10 See Erich Auerbach, Mimesis (1946), chapter 1. He calls stories like the Akedah "deutungsbed√ºrftig". 11 As Gerald Bruns puts it: ...the beginnings of scriptural interpretation are to be looked for within the Scriptures themselves". See his "Midrash and Allegory", in The Literary Guide to the Bible, eds. Robert Alter and Frank Kermode (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1987). For Michael Fishbane, see his Biblical In- terpretation in Ancient Israel (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1985).</page><page sequence="9">JSQ 1 Jewish Tradition as /and the Other 97 "third pillar" of our civilization, as I once called it, still has less chance of being recognized than the "Third World" cultures we are also seeking to acknowledge. Jewish Classics cannot create their own Renaissance without human- ists comparable to those of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries who translated and commented great Pagan (and even some Hebrew) works. This translation in our time, could lead to a different conception of commentary: a revision of the relation between primary and secondary literature, but also between letter and spirit. Commentary in the Jewish tradition has covenantal qualities yet is a form of creative thought. I am tempted to call it, generically, a conservative mode of transgression. It respects the "strict light of the canonical" (Scholem) and influences law (halakha) as well as literature (aggada). Such text-dependence is a way of living in secular time without rejecting a burden of greatness. Jewish feminists, for example, try to change ritual law through argu- ments that do not simply abrogate that law. It is clear that, for Jews, the letter does not kill; but in what way does it give life? To study the commentary-tradition as a "form of life" may answer that crucial question. If, in despair or revolt, we take our distance, if we view ourselves as post-midrashic in addition to post-prophetic, then what Hegel says of a crushing, negative and antithetical burden may come true, and the commentary-tradition could indeed become a dead letter. But though we stand on the shoulders of Akiba and Rashi, the situ- ation of the contemporary reader does not differ essentially from theirs - let us be on guard against historical idealizations, as against those who magnify the gulf not only between prophetic and post-prophetic but also between midrash and modern types of commentary. For the creators and expositors who developed Judaism into a total way of life did so by accepting the otherness of revelation as something now in their keep. They prophesied in the form of commentary and kept the bat hol at bay. It is their Torah; it has been received; one need not be prophet or patriarch to transmit the word of the Lord. Not only did they refuse to forgo a demanding text; they took the risk of dis- closing it again and again. Intimacy rather than dread is the dominant note of rabbinic exegesis, intimacy aware of risk and responsibility. The number of opinions recorded, in apposition, sometime in opposition, place every commentator before the Law, that is, despite rules of se- niority in an originary position of being there Qiineni) to reveal re- velation. Midrash tells of an 'am ha-ares (peasant, or uneducated person) approaching one of the sages with an ingenious comment on Scripture. "I will record it in your name", is the response. That remark,</page><page sequence="10">98 Geoffrey H. Hartman JSQ 1 whether humble or ironic, rings more true than Victor Hugo's pompous: "Je suis un anc√™tre". Angels and Rabbis "Just as they debate halakha on earth, so they debate halakha in heaven" (Tanhuma, on Exodus 18). This comment, attributed to Akiba, suggests why it is difficult to find strong images of otherness in Talmu- dic Judaism. The idea of a heavenly Yeshivah, a Javneh le-ma'lah, need not be taken literally, but the saying does more than to exalt rabbinic pilpul. No future good, no activity even in the world to come, is higher or more satisfying than halakhic study. Because it is so delightful, or because the initiative has passed to the sages, the development of the Oral Law remains open. What Akiba, according to another well-known story, expounds in his classes, Moses himself fails to understand (see Menahot 29 b). But the most interesting implication is that the Angels (who tempt the imagination to dangerous extraterrestrial flights) are kept busy. Make halakhah, not war. Some Tannaim and Amoraim even transmit halakhic dicta in the name of angels.12 The angels' supernatural realm is drawn into a conversation with the Rabbis, just as the word of God was drawn into the world of the prophets. It is significant that the Rabbis use the loan- word familia of the celestial retinue, a usage not found in Hellenistic or Christian literature. The statement in the Babylonian Talmud (Berakhot 25 b) that "The Torah was not given to the Ministering Angels," and Akiba's famous "Enough, Pappas", with which he rejects the idea that "Behold the Man is become as one of us" (Genesis 3:22) meant "one of the Ministering Angels", defines angelology as a major combat zone. It was there that the imaginative tension between likeness and unlike- ness, between the humanity and the otherness of the divine, was re- solved. The angels, barely written up in the Bible, are regenerated by the interpretive ingenuity of scholars whose rivals they become, even in the study of Torah. This rivalry is a complex hermeneutic and psycho- logical fact. The family of angels amplifies the work of the earthly academy, but if the textual imagination that discloses them does not remain alert, the Torah could pass into their hands - that is, be alien- ated from the human community.

The Torah is God's Promethean gift to mankind.13 But how could the Torah be alienated? What I have called, with some figurative exaggeration (but not much), a war, concerns the abyss of gnostic and other heresies, which turn - or turn back - angels into demons that evoke a disunity in God. That suspicion of disunity must be outwitted by an exegetical imagination keeping His unity entire, both as a name (textually) and as a Being beyond beings (theoontologically). "Hear O Israel, the Lord thy God, the Lord is One." What is important for our consideration of otherness is how mys- tical conceptions remain anchored in collective liturgy and the herme- neutic enterprise; how exegesis keeps the angels it elaborates within textual bonds. Since angels, moreover, have no independent life but ascend from and descend to the proof-text of Scripture, there is a blurring of the line between angels and hypostases, as between learned and popular elements. Angels and Words Even if, then, angels are little more than winged words (herme- neunculi), waxing and waning with the darshan's interpolative genius, they make visible the very space they fill, and which in other religions is more patently occupied by idols. The question of where God dwells (despite his otherness), where his Place may be, must be answered in Judaism without recourse to figurines or colossi. So in the Musaf Kedushah prayer, the angels ask one another "Where is the place of his glory?" (ayyeh mekom kevodo). A meditation concerning the divine household (familia) or presence (Shekhina) can hardly be avoided, if God is "with" Israel, still planning to change those wandering Ara- means into a permanent nation with a Holy Land of their own. Eliminating idols was bound to pose a problem for the imagination, one that deepened after the destruction of the second Temple. Yet, viewed from within, there was no "space" that had not already been filled by a concept of revelation as the repetition (deuterosis) and trans- 13 On the general theme of the antagonism or rivalry between angels and man- kind, see Peter Sch√§fer, Rivalit√§t zwischen Engeln und Menschen: Untersuchungen zur rabbinischen Engelvorstellung (Berlin and New York: De Gruyter, 1975).</page><page sequence="12">100 Geoffrey H. Hartman JSQl mission (paradosis) of Scripture in the form of an Oral Law that flour- ished even more intensely after the Temple's destruction. What this meant (I speak only of what it meant for the imagination) is that scrip- ture-words inhabited that "space" left by the absent idols and the ab- sent temple, like a narrative its own darkness.14 God's dwelling-place became more obscure yet His words became more intimately settled; and the spiritual question of where the pneuma or ruah lodged, a question always hovering over the debates of the sages, was less central than the hermeneutic issue of how exegesis could extend the meaning of Torah without displacing its symbols and words. No Torah word may be lost, and no symbol disregarded, because it has been inter- preted.15 Yet if the text has moved closer, if nothing now is said or thought without an inmixing of Scripture, the meaning of the text is mediated by the text itself in its canonical entirety; and in that sense is further off. In the Bible the words of God simply arrive, with or without messengers who may be angels; or they are like burning coals in danger of consuming the prophet. Word and place are often "full of dread"; the otherness of God is strongly there, though the legacy of such visions is not mystery but the nomen in the numen. However, when interpre- tation has replaced direct vision, and when such vision, because of the danger of false prophecy and messianic furor, becomes suspect, then not only hermeneutic rules but also hermeneutic forms emerge, and angels, though still drawing nomen from numen, are a formal device that helps to construct mini-narratives in the service of commentary.16 There is nothing in these mini-narratives which is as sustained as Ivan's dialogue with the devil in The Brothers Karamazov. Dosto√Øevski portrays a nightmare in which a person is about to lose control over part of his mind, which would result in schizophrenia or allowing one- 14 I borrow the metaphor from Frank Kermode's The Genesis of Secrecy: On the Interpretation of Narrative (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1979), p. 45. 15 It is not obvious that all forms of Biblical interpretation had this aim: the "rewritten Bible" (Geza Vermes), perhaps the most popular genre, can "blur the dis- tinction between that text and its interpretation. It is as if the biblical text itself is replaced by its interpretive retelling". See Steven D. Fraade, From Tradition to Commentary: Torah and Its Interpretation in the Midrash Sifre to Deuteronomy (Al- bany: State University of New York Press, 1991), pp.2f. 16 I must stress (see also the discussion to come) that this subordination does not remove whatever original fascination angels may have had. Their origin is daemonic or demonic: they are gods or close to gods, in the sense of being the guardian spirits of foreign (idolatrous) nations. See, e. g.

It is possible, of course, that fuller narratives ex- isted of which the Talmud records the barest memoranda. (Hekhalot literature suggests the existence of such stories.) The ambivalence, in any case, toward visionary subjects and the angel-word is striking. It is important, for instance, to balance the advantage of angels, that they are close to the divine presence, with the danger inherent in that. The mystically inclined interpreter must remember that angels have no in- dependent existence: they are instantaneously generated and can be instantaneously dissolved by God. They must not be regarded as more substantial than the aura of the words they communicate. Jewish legend creates the figure of the instant angel (so fascinating to Walter Ben- jamin), an angel who comes into being only to praise God and die. This perpetual love-death is a good way of purging the angel-surplus. Yet angels never lose their dangerous aura. Even in Talmud and prekabbalistic Midrash there are hints of a psychic split or struggle blend- ing with gnostic fantasies about the "things above" and leading to dual- ism. Elisha ben Abuya, an apostate given the name of Aher (the Other, or Alien, or "of a different seed") is the most famous casualty of such speculation. Aher has a vision of Metatron which prompts the thought: "Perhaps there are two divinities!"17 Though subordinated to the One God, as members of his "family" the angels may become "familiar spir- its", well-known from folklore and legend, who seduce ecstatic believers into manic and ultimately self-destructive acts. Learning and exegesis, moreover, do not prevent but often collaborate with ecstatic beliefs. Ben Zoma, like Aher a victim of the pardes experience, seeks to measure the exact distance (it is always a matter of how far or how near) between the upper and the lower waters of Creation (i. e. he is absorbed in forbidden aspects of the Ma(aseh Bereshit mystery), and decides there are barely three fingers' breadth between them. Valentinus writes aptly: "There are two basic types of angels. One helps mankind, from the beginning, to settle in the world. The other prevents it. Mankind is still far too imma- ture to be enlightened as to which are the good and which the bad an- gels." (Cited by Franz Werfel in Stern der Ungeborenen.) 17 Aher is one of the sages who did not emerge sane from pardes (the garden of mystical exegesis and speculation), whose mind was turned by interpreting "forbidden relations" (a category that includes prohibited sexual contacts). The passage in Hagigah, the Talmudic tractate which reports the story of the pardes (cf. Gen. Rab. 2:4), also suggests that Aher may have succumbed to angelological speculation about Metatron, a heavenly power close to God, and who bears a resemblance to the gnostic demiurge.

Hartman JSQ' Words and Words Can we define the imaginative character of Jewish hermeneutics? There is a balance of strangeness and similitude, which conducts the visionary electricity into liturgical and recognizable channels. Whether this is typically Jewish or a more general aesthetic structure is hard to say: much secondary sp√©cification would be needed to sort out Jewish charac- teristics in an area, the imagination, that seems to have its own drives. More definable is the tendency in Midrash to an aspectival richness that faces, like the hayyot, in all directions. As one of the more graphic visionary depictions in the Bible, the Merkabah holds a special place; yet the Rabbinic imagination from Akiba through the masters of the Kabbalah can magnify even the driest Biblical pericope. The sparks struck by this aspectival and non-mystical type of interpretation are the true fire. We are told that "Once as Ben Azzai sat and expounded, the fire played around him". Akiba asks whether he had been expounding a forbidden relation, "the secrets [inner chambers] of the Merkabah". But Ben Azzai denies it. "I was only linking up the words of the Torah with one another and then with the words of the prophets, and the prophets with the Writings, and the words rejoiced as when they were uttered from Sinai...."18 There are, of course, forms or rules of development, though the associative flow of midrash is too multifaceted to be contained by any scheme. Yet an advance was made when Joseph Heinemann described the proem. This is a homily in which the expositor takes the opening verse of the Torah portion of the week as his end point, and as his starting point any verse from Scripture (usually from the Writings). The darshan finds a way of going from a removed, as if arbitrary, starting- point to the expected verse that opens the Bible portion read in the synagogue. Here the tension between strange and familiar is formalized in the overall shape of the homily. The interpreter's associative skill leaves the impression that all the verses of the Bible are adjacent, however far apart they may seem in placement or meaning. This is intertextuality absolutized by means of and for the sake of the canon. Each proematic sermon demonstrates anew the unity of Scripture and so of the Divine Name.19 18 Midrash Rabbah, trs.

Viewing Scripture as a series of m√©tonymie utterances, each having meanings beyond their immediate context, each signifying also by adjacency with any other verse, is a discovery-procedure that resembles a complex collage and encourages the combination of every word, phrase, even letter. The most fundamental issues of morality and theodicy are discussed in a way that animates, rem√©mor√¢tes and so preserves the proof-texts called upon. That a great deal can hinge on attentiveness to phrases and words compels the metaphysicians and ecstatics not to sail freely into the beyond without charting Scripture at every point, without citing the text as a foundation. Words of the Other That all the words of the Bible are "given by one shepherd" also limits the otherness of the giver. He is "One" and He is a "shepherd." To an unsympathetic observer the nervousness of the Rabbis about the unity of the divine name may seem close to neurotic. Eventually every doubling that involved God as grammatical or figurai subject had to be fenced off. The custom, however, of substituting for the Biblical names of God other names based on significant attributes created a legal polytheism or polyonoma that would be exploited by the mystical and heterodox imagination. Jewish prayer too could not have developed without these multiplying names and attributes. We can suppose, then, that as a religion fights toward the purest kind of monotheism, concern hedges the tongue of the worshipper lest he invoke - however inadvertently - an alien deity. We can also sup- pose that this fear of a lapse has a depth-dimension like that sur- rounding Freudian parapraxis: even should the names in the prayers of the community be agreed on, there may be an unsettled aura, a pos- sibility that, vocally or mentally, and perhaps against the will of priest or worshipper, "other" gods might whisper their way back. One cannot listen to fervent prayers invoking the names of God without a feeling that they are apotropaic as well as apostrophic. And if the Rabbinic expositor is sensitive to the accusative particle in the first verse of 20 The prayer leader who, inadvertently or not, says "Hear, hear, Œü Israel" dis- qualifies himself, according to the Talmud. It may be a slip of the tongue, but it may betray a dualistic heresy. Akiba's justification of the et (the accusative particle) in the first verse of Genesis is famous. The et was necessary, he said, because without it heaven and earth might be taken as subjects rather than objects of the verb "created", and thus as the names of gods or even as gods (Gen.Rab. 1:14, also b Hag. 40 a).</page><page sequence="16">104 Geoffrey H. Hartman JSQ 1 Genesis, how much more so should priest or codifier scrutinize every linguistic detail in these formulas of praise and petition!20 We are really talking about the force of prayer: wishful, answerable, even theurgic. Prayer may call up two distinct though related experi- ences of otherness: the numinous character of the communal God, and that of the alien god or gods the community has renounced, but whose presence may yet be felt in its language, or through the fact, which is phenomenological as well as theological, that transcendence (in the case of its own God too) includes otherness, and otherness the possibility of an alien aspect. Do not blessing God and blessing His Name, fundamental gestures of both aggada and prayer, serve to forestall the breach through which the wrong kind of otherness might come? Take the Kaddish, the "clo- sure" prayer which is also used to magnify, sanctify and bless God's name in the presence of death.21 The exclusion of any mention of the dead is, to the literary mind, a signal euphemism; and the prayer's insistent emphasis on the Name as such seems to acknowledge the need to cry and cry out, a need that may have to be shielded from bitterness or blasphemy. Most remarkable is the prayer's ending, in which "He who makes peace in His high places [heavens]" is asked to "make peace among us and all Israel". This, the prayer's eulogistic and euphemistic climax, closes a breach in consciousness that the experience of death could have opened. "The God of the living", Coleridge's Cain declares, "is not the God of the dead". The Kaddish evokes a peace that was preceded by a war in heaven, by a disunity in the high places or in the mind of the bereaved. This disunity is quietly acknowledged and put aside. Euphemistic through and through, the prayer preserves and aug- ments the name of God, as if that were in danger of suffering some attaint. The unity of God's name, then, the prayer's resistance to any hint of a second power, or a divided kingdom in which death could be Akiba's response shows why it was important, on his part and that of Ishmael, to formulate a consistent hermeneutic. For the heretics scrutinized Scripture as closely as the Rabbis; and whether their challenge was motivated by Christian, Gnostic or Hellenistic beliefs, it is clear that they sought evidence for the existence of "Powers in Heaven": complementary powers (God and the Son of God in Christianity), or opposed powers (Manichean Light and Darkness, or a gnostic YHVH ha-katan, lesser YHVH, creator of this world, as against a Higher God beyond creation with its ad- mixture of evil). See Urbach, The Sages, passim, and A. F. Segal, Two Powers in Heaven, especially his account of the Ishmael-Akiba controversy in chapter 4. 21 For its origin and evolution, see Ismar Elbogen, Der J√ºdische Gottesdienst in seiner geschichtlichen Entwicklung, 2nd edn.

I find a similar tendency in the morning prayer that begins: "My God, the soul you have placed in me is pure". It does not emphasize the divine name as such but instead a "Thou", "Thou", that affirms a direct link to God as creator. The prayer becomes a confirmation, through the mouth of the awakened person, that the soul which has experienced night is not a changeling, or contaminated in any way. It is "pure"; it has been created by one power and one power only, the same that preserved it and will bring it back to life at the end of days. The point of the prayer is less the analogy between waking from sleep and waking from death than affirming the unity of God in the believer's mind, after his soul has passed through a zone of otherness. Conclusion: Sweetening the Word This brings us, in conclusion, to a unique moment in the Bible, when the people, and Moses for them, are summoned to meet God panim el panim. "The Lord spoke with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire - I stood between the Lord and you at that time, to declare unto you the word of the Lord; for you were afraid because of the fire, and went not up in the mount..." This sentence from Deuteronomy (4: 5) is but the summary of a complex series of events. It is complex because the narrative - I shall put it this way - has to decide how to represent that "face to face" full of dread, the degree of direct contact between God and Israel, and God and Moses. On the one hand, revelation must be unmediated at this juncture: the covenant is between God and the people, there should be no angel standing in for God, no delegates distancing a people henceforth designated as a "kingdom of priests". "The Lord made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day" (Deut. 5: 3). On the other hand, this is a wilderness God, speaking from the top of a mountain out of the midst of fire. To break through to the Lord and gaze is to risk that He break forth and they perish (Exodus 19:21). How can there be a "face to face"? In terms of religious organization, the priestly class lose their ex- clusive privilege as intermediaries. It passes to the people as a whole, and to Moses, who is singled out from the Israelites as they themselves are singled out from all the nations. But if the presence (literally "face") of God is strengthened by the directness of the Sinai encounter, the danger is increased of otherness breaking through, unmediated and</page><page sequence="18">106 Geoffrey H. Hartman JSQl unbuffered. Rabbinic exegesis captures the contrast between God's power, his bullroarer and fireworks act, and Sinai's ultimate purpose: to diminish rather than augment mystery by means of an intelligible set of laws. The following passage from Midrash Rabbah is typical in staging a prosopopeia halfway between prayer and intimate argument, and which, as always, draws nomen out of numen: "His mouth is most sweet" (Song of Songs 5:16). R. Azariah and R. Aha in the name of R. Yohanan said: When the Israelites heard at Sinai the word "I", their soul left them, as it says: "If we hear the voice ... any more, then we shall die" (Deut. 5:22), as it says: "My soul expired at his word" (Song of Songs 5:6). The Word [dibbur] then returned to the Holy One, blessed be He, and said: "Sovereign of the Universe, Thou art full of life, and Thy law is full of life, and Thou has sent me to the dead, for they are all dead". Thereupon the Holy One, blessed be He, sweetened the Word for them.22 Here the force - even the death-dealing power - of the law is ac- knowledged. But retrospectively so: we are clearly not in the era of prophesy but rather of words about the Word, with the hypostatized Word at once more distant and more intimate. Dibbur gibbor. the Word is hero and acts curiously like Moses by returning to God and asking Him to reconsider: please give them a second chance, that is, a second - further - word. Unique as it is, Sinai doubles itself in that Moses has to go twice for the tables of stone, and Deuteronomy is a retelling of the giving of the Law. But then every Scripture word retells the events that culminate in Sinai. Something uttered by the Shulammite in Songs of Songs can be juxtaposed, as here, with the severest moment in covenant-history. Midrash reaffirms the unity of Scripture as the mercifully extended, accommodated, voice of God. This drama of accommodation is central. Justifying in advance the mercy it wishes God to show, midrash gives Him reasons by quoting, whenever possible, His own words. Here it not only amplifies an actual plea of the original community but rehearses a critical moment when the I-Thou encounter might leave no Thou; when the ball is thrown and no receiver is found. Saying "You" to God is, in that sense, Israel saying "You" to itself, not over-distancing (othering) the community because the prophetic voice has passed, and we see only by glimpses or through the medium of tradition. The formal mode of apostrophe that charac- terizes prayer is indeed a recognition of divine sublimity and otherness; it is also, however, a plea for the community or the individual to be 22 Song of Songs Rabbah 5. 16.3</page><page sequence="19">JSQl Jewish Tradition as /and the Other 107 constituted as a You in that sublime situation, to be recognized as someone still there, present, like Moses to whom God says: "I will do this also which you have asked, for you have found grace in My sight and I know you by name" (Exodus 33:17). A remarkable instance disclosing the structure of religious address occurs in conjunction with the special revelation granted to Moses. Having requested to see God's glory and having been told that no one can see Him and live (Exodus 33:18-20), he is nevertheless permitted to stand near God as the latter passes by and proclaims: Adonai Adonai El rahum ve-hanun erekh appayim ve-rabh hesed ve-emet . . . ("The Lord, the Lord, God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth ..." [Exodus 34: 6f]). What is distinctive here is that, against expectation and the opinion of some scholars, it is not Moses who cries "Adonai Adonai" but God Himself; it is not Moses who, so close to the glory, acknowledges God and proclaims (or pleads for) mercy. Yet why should God call on Himself this way? Do we have any other instance of such an apostrophe, addressed by a divine being to itself?23 In ordinary discourse it would indicate the wish to take thought, to act by thought on thought in a movement of recollection: "Sois sage, o ma douleur, et tiens-toi plus tranquille" (Baudelaire). That may be happen- ing here too, however sublime the voice beseeching itself. God, that is, does not "break out" except as a voice that pleads with itself, and this self-restraint is reinforced when He gives the attribute of mercy greater scope than the emphasis on deferred justice. The formal effect of the apostrophe is to suggest that God constitutes Himself as a "Thou", renewing that mode of address for the watcher in the cleft who will bring this very cry to the ears of a community that repeats it in its own voice, in its own name, every Day of Atonement. Each verse and vocable of Scripture is, for midrash, the synecdoche of a power of voice that must bind itself to a "law full of life". The otherness of a prepotent word sends the soul into a negative sort of ecstasy, which is redressed when the Word intercedes for itself by supplying a "Thou" and becomes interpr√©table as leshon bnei adam. The hermeneutic character of Jewish spirituality, then, can be described as the narrative of an extended Thou-ing by which a community ad- dresses God and constitutes itself (its you-nity) at the same time. Here 23 The "great oath" sworn by Zeus or other ancients gods, by which words they then promise to abide, approaches but does not entirely coincide with this Biblical moment of self-apostrophe.</page><page sequence="20">108 Geoffrey H. Hartman JSQl is the deepest and best source of Buber's ethical imperative that we should transform every I-It into an I-Thou relationship, and perhaps of Emmanuel Levinas' challenge, that we remove every trace of Hegelian mediation from that I-Thou, until the face of the other haunts us like the "face" of God. But keeping for the moment to the traditional texts: the otherness of God, and the inadequacy of thoughts or speech directed toward Him, are also mitigated by a tendency felt more in midrash and prayer than in the Bible. To the prepotent I, the humanizing Thou, and their ex- tension into interpr√©table story, we must add what midrash calls "sweetening the word": a radical euphemism of statement that blesses and blesses the Name and refuses to diverge from the mode of bless- ing.24 So in the passage before us, "The Holy One, blessed be He", however routine an expression it seems to be, indicates that the dread of Holiness has in fact been sweetened, that the Word has been re- ceived, for the Sages themselves are responsively praising God from their place, that is, from midrash, which seeks to rival the angels' Kedushah. 24 On euphemism and blessing generally, see my Saving the Text: Literature/ Derrida / Philosophy (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1981), pp. 130ff.</page></plain_text>
