THE Striking results obtained by the linguists in the reconstruc- tion of the prehistoric Indo-European language through the application of the comparative method naturally awakened the desire to apply the same method in cognate disciplines of the field for which the Germans have the convenient term " Geisteswissenschaften." Among others the traditional myths of the Indo-European peoples have invited this sort of treat- ment. This extension of the application of the comparative method is however beset by special difficulties, which it is just as well to try and realise. The success of the linguists' employment of the comparative method rests at bottom on the fact that words can be resolved into basic elements of their structure, namely, sounds, and on the discovery of those empirical generalisations which linguists are accustomed to term sound-laws, by means of which they can explain the changes which languages have undergone in the sense of a linear evolution of their structural forms. When, however, we attempt to apply the comparative method in departments cognate to language, the place of words is taken by concepts and these concepts are much more resistant than words are to an exhaustive analysis into their structural elements. Hence the comparison of myths has not as yet produced any- thing in the nature of generalisations about changes in their structural elements which would be at all comparable to the sound-laws of the linguist, and consequently, without the aid of such generalisations, a reconstruction of the myths of the 139</page><page sequence="2">140 Reviews primitive Indo-European people is a much more speculative affair than the reconstruction of their language. This reflection has been called forth by my perusal of the book under consideration. M. Dum6zil's starting point for his stimu- lating study of Teutonic myths is the agreement in important mythical concepts established in 1918 by Vendryes between the Indo-Iranian and Italo-Celtic groups of the Indo-European peoples, an agreement of an especially striking nature because it is vouched for by a large measure of agreement in the ter- minology for these concepts. It is indeed tempting to believe that this agreement is due to the inheritance of a common stock not merely of names but also of meanings which belonged (as M. Dumezil cautiously phrases it) to at least a fraction of the Indo-European people. It is then a seductive task to try and establish that this common stock was also a part of the inheri- tance of the Teutonic peoples and this is the aim of M. Dumezil's book. The task is especially difficult because the Teutonic mytho- logical terminology shows only a very partial agreement with that of the groups mentioned. Hence M. Dumizil has to demonstrate that concepts survived among the Teutons although their designations were changed. The method the author adopts is to analyse and interpret various literary records of the Teutonic myths, e.g. those con- tained in the Ynglingatal, the Edda, Saxo-Grammaticus, so as to extract from them evidence for the existence of certain important concepts which have a constitutive value in other mythologies of Indo-European peoples. Mythological concepts are plainly of a derivative nature. They fuse together elements which are given with man's own experience mainly in two spheres, the sphere of natural and that of social phenomena. It may be a matter of argument which of these two spheres has greater influence on the formation of myths. M. Dum6zil stresses the social sphere. The gods form a society which is a reflection of human society. The myths play around the functions which are important in a given social order. In a primitive order the main functions are those of the king, the warrior and the husbandman. At a more advanced stage we</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 141 can add to these other highly specialised functions such as those of the artisan, the smith, the physician. It is the earlier order with its tripartite division which gives the outline for M. Dum6zil's study of Teutonic mythology. After an introductory chapter in which he shows the applicability of the social scheme as a means of interpreting a puzzling passage on the Teutonic Gods in Caesar's " Gallic War," he devotes three chapters each to Myths of Sovereignty, Warrior Myths and Myths of Vitality. The title of this third division of the myths is at first sight sur- prising. " Vitality " is not a social function in the same sense as " sovereignty " and " warfare," and we may be inclined to ask why it should take the place of " husbandry " or " agri- culture." But the function of the husbandman does show a specific difference as against those of the sovereign and the warrior. The latter two control social forces; -the former controls natural forces, which he makes contributory to the vital physical needs of society. In this sense his function is a symbol of much that may be brought under the heading of vitality, fecundity and so on. But the three chapters of this division rather break the bounds of the tripartite social frame- work which M. Dumizil claims to have underlain the stock of myths inherited by the Teutons from their Indo-European predecessors. Only the central chapter on Gods and Goddesses of fecundity is definitely in the social milieu of the husbandman : the preceding one on beverages and the following one on gold and treasures overlap the domain of the sovereignty and warfare divisions. But perhaps that was only to be expected. Social organisation could no doubt suggest the offices of the gods in their own society, but the imagination would envisage them not merely as officials but also as individuals. A human king is by his office no fighter, but as a man he may have strong ambitions in that direction, or may even wish to figure as an expert in agriculture! The social functions would in fact furnish elements of the particular divine personality, but not necessarily, and not even probably, would all the elements of a personality be derived from one social class-nay more all the elements would not necessarily be derived from the social organisation alone. The distinction between the Ases and the Vanes runs through</page><page sequence="4">142 Reviews Scandinavian mythology and whereas the Ases clearly enough reflect the social hierarchy, this is not by any means so certain as regards the Vanes, who seem to have close affinities with natural forces. Indeed, while it may on the one hand be granted that the manifestation of internal forces at work in the social fabric must necessarily be a strong stimulus to the imagination that revels in the conception of anthropomorphic deities, on the other hand human society as a whole is both the plaything and the would-be master of external forces which could hardly fail to stimulate imaginative exercises in the same or an analogous direction. M. Dumizil's forte lies decidedly in the descriptive analysis of the literary records of the myths. He develops an indestruc- tible verve in the interpretation of his texts and in resolving them into the elements of their mythical content. In this way he makes a highly important contribution to the structural analysis of Teutonic myths and to the laying bare of their similarities and analogies with those of other races: Indo- Aryan, Greek, Latin, Celtic. He certainly demonstrates that Teutonic mythology has its place well within the ambit of typically Indo-European affinities. Whether he makes it equally plain that it testifies to the earlier existence of a common Indo-European triad of deities corresponding to the primitive tripartite social division seems to me more doubtful. As the distinction between the Ases and the Vanes shows, there is probably more than one strand woven into the texture of Teutonic myths; the tradition of the tripartite social division is not pure, its elements have been mingled with those from another source. The mythologist has here a similar difficulty to that which confronts the textual critic dealing with a written work whose transmission has been falsified by the contamination of different manuscripts. It weighs still heavier that the evidence for a common origin does not often go beyond similarity and analogy, and therefore remains highly ambiguous. To take an example from the chapter on beverages. The myth in the Edda about the prepara- tion of beer for a feast in the hall of Aegir has a parallel in the story of the Indian gods preparing the drink of immortality.</page><page sequence="5">Reviews 143 In both cases a vessel is necessary which must be procured by hook or crook. In the Scandinavian tale this vessel is the cauldron of Hymir, the genius of the sea, in the Indian it is the vase of the Ocean owned by the Master of the Waters. In both cases it is procured, though not by the same process. Obviously we can attempt to equate the cauldron and the vase, Hymir and the Master of the Waters, the two methods of procuring the required vessel, also the beer and the drink of immortality, as pairs of corresponding variants of an underlying concept. But what regularities are there in these correspondences which could give a pointer to their common origin as do the phonetical correspondences in comparable pairs of Sanskrit and Germanic words? For the linguist every sound element in Sanskrit pitd and English father shows the way to an original Indo-European patir- from which both descend, because he can demonstrate that the process by which the original sounds were changed in each instance was a regular one which is repeated in endless other words. But does the clear analogy between the above pair of myths give us any pointer to the original vessel which became in one instance a vase, in the other a cauldron? Do Hymir and the Master of the Waters give any clear indication of who was the owner of the original vessel? Must we suspect that the common association with the sea may only point to an imagina- tion originally stimulated by the wish to possess an attractive drink in inexhaustible quantity? In fact, can we say that the agreement of the two stories does more than inform us that the primitive Indo-Europeans (or a fraction of them, in M. Dumizil's cautious phrasing) possibly had a myth about a drink whose preparation called for a special utensil? No doubt that is some- thing but it is not much! It does not amount to the reconstruc- tion of an original myth though it may hint at a reconstruction yet to be made. I may appear to be too sceptical about M. Dum6zil's com- parative aim. It seems, however, that in the present state of our knowledge, while it is possible to compare myths with advantage, it is not yet possible to apply to them the compara- tive method of the linguist, i.e. the inductive method, which as an undergraduate in the logic class, I was taught to call the</page><page sequence="6">144 Reviews Method of Concomitant Variations. Before languages could be treated by this method their structure had been analysed and systematised by the grammarians. Have we as yet a grammar of myths? It is at most only in the making. M. Dumizil's book seems to bear this out. I have already emphasized that his forte appears to lie in the interpretative analysis of myths. His substantial contribution to this study is consequently much less an answer to the historical question how myths became than to the psychological question why myths became. He shows us, in effect, that myths are poetry, products of the imagination responding to various classes of stimuli operative in human experience. He thus develops with admirable insight many varied elements of the structure of myths. But even when by comparison he shows us the structural similarity between the myths of different peoples he is at times too cautious to attri- bute it to a common derivation from an Indo-European source. Take for example the following remark ' propos of the Loka- senna in the Edda: " Quoi qu'il en soit de cette mystique et de cette pratique de la 'raillerie des fetes,' on conqoit que, ind6- pendamment, Germains et Celtes en aient tird sinon un genre litt6raire, du moins un 'cadre litt6raire' de meme type." The " ind6pendamment " and the " cadre litteraire " are significant admissions. Here the comparison obviously leads not to a reconstruction of an Indo-European archetype of the myths compared but only to a structural analogy between products of the imagination working in different societies under com- parable conditions. On the whole, M. Dumizil's " Essai d'interpr'tation com- parative " brings out the specific quality of the Teutonic myths more plainly than the existence of evidence for their descent from a common Indo-European source inherited also by other related peoples. It does so not in spite of but by virtue of the comparative treatment which, while it establishes their struc- tural analogies with the myths of the other peoples, also throws into relief their specific differentiation. I grant him readily the most important point in his " Conclusion," the predominantly militant character of the Teutonic myths, but I am not convinced that he has established that these myths as a body have arisen</page><page sequence="7">Reviews 145 mainly by structural modification of an originally Indo-European stock whose essential feature was a triad of deities corresponding to a tripartite division in social organisation.
