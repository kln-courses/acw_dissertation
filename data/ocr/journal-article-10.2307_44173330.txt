<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FRAGMENTARY BODY : THE PLACE OF HUMAN LIMBS IN BYZANTINE ILLUMINATED INITIALS Disjointed human limbs were first depicted in initial letters as early as in the 6th c. All the earliest examples are Latin, and include frontal or profile heads, reminiscent of the images on coins or medals, and accord- ingly enclosed in the round part of the letter (e.g., Epistulae Pauli, fols. 3, 21v, initial "P") ('). The 7th c. Latin manuscript of Italian origin, Liber Sacramentorum Q, presents the first known example of the human hand as a substitute for the central bar of the initial "E". Only from the 8th c. did Western illuminated manuscripts make free use of disjointed human forms, perceiving their ornamental qualities. The tradition of such trans- formations arose from "barbarian" art and perhaps specifically an Insular pictorial influence, utilizing human body parts as an essential element in ornamentation and turning the human figure in general into an ornamen- tal motif (3). In Byzantium, the first surviving examples of the initial letters com- posed of detached human limbs are known only from late 9th c., in the Paris Gregory of 879-882 {Paris, BNF, Gr. 510) and in the two lectionar- ies from c. 900 : Paris, BNF, Gr. 277 and Patmos, The Monastery of John the Theologian, cod. 70 (hereafter, Paris 277 and Patmos 70). The depic- tions of human limbs became prevalent only in lO^-c. Byzantine manu- scripts, in which disjoined heads, hands, and legs are inserted into differ- ent initial letters. These body parts may be presented separately, or joined (1) E.g., Epistulae Pauli (r), Munich, Bayerische Staatbibliothek, Clm. 6436 (+ Univ. Bibi. 4° 928), North African or Spanish, 6* c. ; C.

Nevertheless, conservative Byzantine illumi- nators did not grasp the decorative opportunities hidden in detached human limbs, and never metamorphosed them into ornament. Furthermore, contrary to the Western examples, the earliest Byzantine manuscripts with illuminated initials show a clear preference for imper- sonal human limbs, such as hands and legs (4). The substitution of the whole body by impersonal fragments causes identity to be lost, while emphasizing the quality of the motor movement, which may be various- ly interpreted. Understanding the role of such limbs is the central purpose of this study. The motif of a hand introduced into the initial letter "E" substituting its central bar is found for the first time in the Paris Gregory of 879-882. It is repeatedly depicted there in the form of a sleeved palm in the so-called gesture of Greek benediction. Since then, the hand has remained an essential part of the initial letter Epsilon across the entire range of manu- scripts up to the late Byzantine period, but especially in lectionaries, due to its appearance in the incipit "The Lord said" (elirev ó xúqioç). Furthermore, the initial Epsilon of almost every Byzantine lectionary, and that in the Tetraevangelion, contains a blessing hand, starting the verse of the Gospel of John : "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (1:1) (PI. III : 1). This (4) There is no evidence of Byzantine initials composed of human faces and heads until the 10th c. When present, the face (in most cases) is represented frontally as a full-face inserted in the initial "O". Such a representation of a face, enclosed in the roundel "imago clipeata", was not invented for the initials, but is widely used in all kinds of manuscript decorations (in the Chludov Psalter such an image stands for the true icon, e.g., fol. 2, 23v, 51 v : H. L. Kessler, Spiritual Seeing : Picturing God's Invisibility in Medieval Art , Philadelphia, Pa., 2000, p. 80). The image itself is a symbolic representation of Christ, and it became especially common after the iconoclastic controversy. The sources and the devel- opment of the initials that enclose such faces should be studied independendy ; these questions are outside the scope of the present study. In Greek manuscripts originating in Italy and influenced by Latin examples, a head is one of the most common motifs. It is not necessarily that of Christ, but mostly represents a saint or an anonymous person. Unlike the purely Byzantine examples, these manu- scripts generally show a full head, unattached to a body, frontally or in profile, with details such as hair, cranium, and throat, instead of the flat face only. They may appear as part of almost any letter of the alphabet, as with the other unat- tached human limbs (e.g., Vat. Barberini, Gr. 285 ; e.g. fols. 34, 40).</page><page sequence="3">THE FRAGMENTARY BODY 243 became the most common motif used in lectionaries in general and an almost inseparable part of the initial Epsilon, substituting its inner bar. So it seems that this motif was invented originally for a lectionary, as Weitzmann suggested (5), and, probably starting there, the gesturing hand became one of the major motifs composing the initial letters. The variety of initial letters associated with the hand motif is evident especially in the earliest known illuminated lectionaries of c. 900, París 277 and Patmos 70. A hand appears as a part of the vertical stems of ini- tials like "I", "H", "II" ; extending to sides of 'T', composing "2", and topping the ascending stem of "K" (Pis. I ; II). It never breaks the form of the letters, but always supports it. In all these initials it appears at the upper part, as a prolongation of the vertical stem or circular shape. The hand's gesture varies, from open palm and blessing (in variations) to the gesture of grasping the horizontal bar of a letter or sometimes another object according to the indication of the corresponding text. This variety would continue into the 10th c., while late lO^-c. manuscripts already show signs of stabilization and restriction. As opposed to the Western initials, the cut-off hand combined with another motif is rare in the Byzantine tradition, though a striking exam- ple can be found in the Sinai Lectionary (Sinai, the Monastery of St. Catherine, cod. 213) dated to 967. Together with the traditional use of the hand as an integral part of Epsilon, in some examples unattached hands are represented among zoomorphic features and have no connec- tion to the form of the letter (fol. 58v ; 196v - close motif inside head- piece) (PI. Ill : 3, 4). The source of these initials is unclear (6). (5) K. Weitzmann, The Constantinopolitan Lectionary, Morgan 639, in Studies in Art and Literature for Belle da Costa Greene, ed. by. D. Miner, Princeton, 1954, pp. 362-363. (6) They were perhaps inspired by representations of the Last Judgment, where hands (like other parts of the human body) can be seen emerging from within various monsters. Such a tradition is found in Byzantine art only from the 1 1" c., but it may correspond to an earlier source. The earliest hypothetical mod- els related to the theme of the Last Judgment are found in 9th-c. Byzantine man- uscripts ( Sacra Parallela : Paris. BNF., Gr. 923, fol. 68v ; and Christian Topography: Sinaiticus, fol. 89). Both differ greatly from the later (lllh c.) scheme, found, for example, in Paris BNF, Gr. 74, fol. 51v and an ivory in London, Victoria and Albert Museum. This motif does not appear on the remain- ing fresco in Yilani Kilise, Cappadocia (10h-ll,h c.) or on the 9"'-10"'-c. fresco from Kastoria, Hagios Stephanos. It is also absent from the early Western</page><page sequence="4">244 E. MAAYAN-FANAR Another variant concerns the physical act of holding, forming initial 'T' and "II". Such initials can be found in 10th- and 1 P-c. manuscripts, where hands are usually represented holding the horizontal bar of the letters (Pl. IV : 3, 9) (7). This motif in initial "II" was apparently later transformed in Constantinopolitan manuscripts into two hands holding palm branches, referring to Paschal symbolism (Pl. IV : 10). Originally it figured starting the lection for Palm Sunday, whence it spread to manu- scripts of different contents. This motif can be found in the so-called "Methaphrastes group" (e.g., Rome, Vat. Barberini, Gr. 372, fol. 130 ; London, BL, Add. 19352, fol. 100 ; Mount Athos, Lavra 46, fol. 76v, 264 ; Oxford, Bodl. Lib., Cromwell 19, p. 108 ; London BL, Loan 36/23, fol. 154v ; Athens, NL, Gr. 2363, fol. 130 - all related stylistically and produced in the same ergasterion (8). Despite some late examples, the broad tradition of such combinations between the motif of a hand and the letters seems to have become extremely limited in the 1 1th c., so much so that by that time only Epsilon remained constantly associated with a hand motif. A hand on top of the vertical stem of the initials Tau and Iota continued to appear in certain manuscripts, definitely based on the earlier common models. The same conclusions can be reached concerning the insertion of legs or feet into Byzantine initials. In Byzantine manuscripts some vertical stems of initial letters topped by a hand may stand on legs. Thus the ini- representations of the Last Judgment such as St. John Church in Müstair of 800, and a late 8lh-early 9'h-c. Anglo-Saxon ivory in London, Victoria and Albert Museum. However, because very few of these early examples have survived, and most of these are in poor condition, it is not possible to conclude whether this motif existed earlier or may be considered as a IO"1- or 1 l'h-c. invention.

A few manu- scripts preserve unattached leg representations, all probably based on a common model. First examples of such combinations can be found in Paris 277 and Patmos 70 (Pl. 1 : 2, 3 ; Pl. II : 2 ; Pl. V : 3). Here hands and legs are real- istically shaped. A similar motif, albeit already transformed to a decora- tive pattern, exists also in another lectionary from the 10th century, Paris, BNĶ Gr. 48 (fol. 207v, 213) (Pl. V : 4), stylistically close to the Paris and Patmos lectionaries. Initial "T' composed of a hand-leg motif can be seen in later Byzantine manuscripts, such as London, BL, Arundel 547 (9), (Pl. IV : 12 ; Pl. V : 5) also a lectionary, which is related to the Paris 277 and Patmos 70. Here, the motif is more complex, for in several cases a highly stylized head in profile is also added, representing the whole body as a pattern (fol. 30v). For some reason an effort seems to have been made to avoid the rep- resentation of the whole human body but to turn it into a pattern. It may be significant that a considerable number of such fragmentary and pat- terned representations of the human body appear in lectionaries, thus avoiding representation of the whole human body in manuscripts sym- bolizing the Logos. All these manuscripts are ascribed to the eastern provinces, while Arundel 547 may have been produced in Constan- tinople. Do these lectionaries represent the first attempts to depict the human figure in initial letters, albeit only intimated ? Note that by the first half of the 10th c. the human figure was already a part of the initial letter, espe- cially in manuscripts of homiletic content (l0). Nevertheless, continuation and transformation of an aniconic tradition can be seen in late 10th- and early lP-c. initial letters, especially in lectionaries. They still eschew representation of the whole human body, yet they combine various parts in an unrealistic mode. The entire vertical letter-stem becomes both human and patterned. Arundel 547 seems to be borderline, continuing the (9) On this manuscript see S. P. Madigan, The Decoration of Arundel 547.

Thus, the contents of the manuscript may dictate what motifs will be depicted in it. This aniconic tradition later became irrelevant ; the leg motif almost disappears in the 1 P-c. manuscripts, leaving the hand as fixed to certain initials, especially Epsilon, but also Iota and Tau. Possible sources of Byzantine human-shaped initials The value of the independent limb standing for the whole body or emphasizing a specific part of the body was well understood and used in different contexts, long before it made its way into the initial letter. The importance of human limbs appears already in Egypt, where they play an essential part in hieroglyphs (l2) as well as amulets (13). In the Greco-Roman tradition, gems and amulets represent hands, legs, or heads (or busts) and symbolize gods, persons, or situations. Disjointed human limbs also had apotropaic purposes. Etruscan and Roman ex-voto plaques and sculptures, and Greek tama, namely small plaques with visu- al representations of a person or a diseased limb, contain legs, hands, internal parts of the body, or organs (PI. V : 6) (14). Each is shaped like a real part of the body, and they function as symbolic replacements for the real limbs or organs, or their activity. These anatomical votives reflected (11) The style of the initial letters of this manuscript differs from the previ- ously discussed group. The motif of the Siren and the abstract tendencies sug- gest an influence of the early Islamic metalwork. However, additional research has to be done to support this proposal. (12) The connection between Egyptian hieroglyphic writing and the devel- opment of the initial letter tradition in early Christian and Byzantine manuscripts was probably not direct. However, hieroglyphs were of great interest in the ancient world and were sometimes misunderstood and misinterpreted. E. I versen, The Myth of Egypt and Its Hieroglyphs in European Tradition, Prince- ton, NJ, 1993. (13) C. Andrews, Amulets of Ancient Egypt, Austin, 1994, pp. 69-73. Such amulets were used in burials especially in the late Old Kingdom and First Intermediate Period and were used as substitutes for the damaged parts of the body. Several parts of the body amulets ceased to exist afterwards. (14) P.

An early Christian reference to this practice is found in Theodoret ( Graecarum Affectionum Curatio , 8.64) : "Christians come to the martyrs to implore them to be their intercessors. That they obtained what they so earnestly prayed for is clearly proven by their votive gifts, which proclaim the heal- ing. Some bring images of eyes, others feet, others hands, which some- times are made of gold, sometimes of wood..." (16). Greek tama have continued to be used till modern times, and in Greek churches they can be found attached to the icons as a request for healing. This highlights the significance of this custom in Greek Orthodox tradition (17) (Pl. V : 8). From the early centuries of Christianity, remains of martyrs and saints were believed to bear special powers of healing and to afford access to the divine, as attested in hagiographie literature (18). Fragments of saintly bodies were transported to churches and even to private houses. Each fragment, according to the common belief, had a power of its own (19). In the Latin West, from the 9th c., fragments of bones were enclosed in shrines that were shaped like detached human limbs (20). (15) H. S.

By the time of the Second Council of Nicea in 787 relics were required for the consecration of altars. The earliest reliquaries, shaped like sarcophagi, placed bones of a single saint togeth- er. In the Middle Ages the power and authority of relics had grown in such way that they were separated and used independently to establish the power of the Church. The tradition of transferring and dismembering holy bodies was firstly established among the Greeks, and by the 9th c. was customary in the West. J. M. McCulloh, The Cult of Relics in the Letters and 'Dialogs' of Pope Gregory the Great : A Lexicographical Study, in Traditio , 32 (1976), p. 145. (20) The earliest known reliquary in the form of a body-part is the head of St. Maurice, dating from 879-887. Such shrines became extremely "fashionable"</page><page sequence="8">248 E. MAAYAN-FANAR Ex-voto and tama represented personal needs and wishes, associated with a specific person. Body-part reliquaries, on the other hand, were related to impersonal signs of spirituality. Hand- and leg-shaped reliquar- ies were very common in Western Christianity. The earliest known one shaped like a foot is the Egbert shrine (Trier, 977-993, now in the Cathedral treasury), but reliquaries shaped like hands in different gestures were especially popular (21). Contrary to head reliquaries, which may rep- resent the presumed likeness of the particular saint, an arm is universal. The emphasis in such reliquaries is on the gesture and its significance as a divine sign of blessing. Because of the gesture, such shrines have been traditionally called "speaking reliquaries" (22). The arms did not speak for themselves only, but were seen as the vehicles of divine power. Miracles performed through the use of arm reliquaries were seen as inspired by God's intervention ; a saint's bone enclosed in a shrine of that shape became an intermediary between God and man. The relic is fragmentary, but its spiritual power is as strong as if it were whole. Because the mes- sage and not the individuality of the saint is emphasized, the form of the arm shrine remains almost constant : a jeweled sleeve with protruding gesturing hand, without any hint of individuality. Impersonal and power- ful, the arm appears as a sign (23). In Byzantium too relics played an important role and were collected for centuries. By 1204 Constantinople had one of the largest collections (24). The relics were placed in different parts of the churches : only in the 12th and 13"1 c.

They were extremely important in the imperial court (26), and were used to vouchsafe the power of the emperor and the Church, as a diplomatic tool, in the emperor's ceremonies, in military life as a sign of victory, and for many other functions. Some of them are known to be deemed of great value and symbolic power. The arm of St. Stephen, transported to a church in Constantinople built especially for it as early as the 5th c., is one of them. The translation is commemorated on the ivory relief, now in Trier (the Cathedral treasury). The relic is depict- ed in a little box, a conventional shape of Byzantine reliquary. In Byzantium, hardly any evidence exists of body-part reliquaries (27). Despite their importance, body-part relics seemingly never became of such significance as in the West, probably because the central object of veneration was the icon, which preserves the likeness of the depicted fig- ure and has miraculous powers (28). But the use of some body parts as (25) N. Teteriatnikov, Relics in the Foundations of Byzantine Churches , in Relics in the Art and Culture of the Eastern Christian World.

As one of the most important relics, it was brought to Constantinople in the 10th c. and placed in the church of the Virgin of Pharos in 944 ; today it is in the Topkapi Museum, Istanbul. Its reliquary, how- ever, is of a Western type and does not follow the Byzantine tradition. On this relic see I. Kalavrezou, Helping Hands of the Empire : Imperial Ceremonies and the Cult of Relics at the Byzantine Court , in Byzantine Court Culture from 829 to 1204, ed. H. Maguire, Washington D.C., 1997, pp. 53-99. (28) The image depicted on the icon is a true image, because on the one hand it was painted from "life" (an icon of the Virgin painted by St. Lucas) ; on the other hand it is an image not made by human hand but one that appeared in a miraculous way ( Mandylion ). This last image represents both an icon and a relic. As Liz James suggests, attitudes to icons during the iconoclasm may explain their special emphasis and significance after it. Relics, although their real fate during the iconoclasm is unclear, seem to have survived that period and were not destroyed as icons. Furthermore, she distinguishes the private role of the relics from the public role of icons, which were exposed for public veneration. L.

The hand as an impersonal sign was used in the Syro-Palestinian tradition as early as the 6^-7* c. in votive objects made of different materials (29). Sometimes it is represented holding a globe topped with a cross (Pl. IV : 14, 15). These sleeveless hands are cut from beneath to emphasize the protruding palm with extended fingers. The hands are hollow, and were probably placed on top of some liturgi- cal objects. Gary Vikan explains these hands as votive objects function- ing similarly to the Byzantine tama images (30). All hands have an open palm, two or three fingertips holding (or most likely touching) a cross (or a globe). The meaning of these objects is uncertain. They might have had a role close to the later Western body-part reliquaries, being impersonal and combining the magical act of healing through God's intervention and the miraculous power of the cross (31). ful material proof of historical persons and events. Defending icons, iconophiles placed the emphasis on the term "likeness". Icons, linked to the prototype by a common form, began to be considered as true and necessary witnesses to the incarnation. C.

On fol. 11 v, a hand is represented supporting the vertical stem of the initial "T" (Pl. IV : 11). The position of the hand supporting the vertical stem of the letter, shaped as a decorative element, resembles votive hands supporting the cross. Since early Christianity, "T" was understood as an image of the cross (32), so the connection between the three-dimensional image and manuscript illumination may not be coincidental. Further development of this idea may be found in another lectionary, Arundel 547. A hand (attached to legs), while holding a globe from which emerges the vertical stem of "T" (Pl. IV : 12), also alludes to the same vocabulary found in Byzantine votive hands. Unattached hands representing a function of holding also have a long tradition in the pagan world. They may be found in Egyptian, Greek, and Roman cultures and were also widely followed in the Byzantine world. A hand was used as a part of a candelabrum or of a cosmetic spoon (M). A finger may be used as a hook C4). Roman and Byzantine hairpins shaped like hands were widely popular. Such elongated pins, as well as other similar objects (e.g., bath usensils in the form of hands), resemble the shape of some "I" and "T" initials in certain Greek manuscripts (e.g., Paris 277, fol. 34 ; Patmos, the Monastery of John the Theologian, cod. 29, fol. 324v ; Rome, Vat. Ottob., Gr. 14, fol. 217v ; Athens NL, 2363, fol. 130 ; Oxford, Bodl. lib., Canon, Gr. 92, fol. 127) and may have served as one of their possible models. These objects also resemble the 6th- and 7th- c. votive hands mentioned above, a circumstance that supports the conti- nuity of Roman pictorial forms into the Christian vocabulary (Pl. IV : 3, 4, 8, 9 cf. 6, 7, 13-15). Enough objects apparently existed, such as pins, votive images, and house belongings, both Byzantine and Late Antique, to serve as models for the Byzantine hand-shaped initial letters.

Although the earliest examples are found only around c. 900, the practice of using disjointed legs in various small household objects and personal belongings (e.g., perfume boxes shaped like legs) is well attested. Lamps too were molded like a leg or a foot (35). In the early Christian tradition the foot was considered a symbol of pro- tection and good fortune, and was used as a lamp to recall the spiritual light in Psalm 119 : 105 (36). The beautiful feet of those walking in the way of God were also praised (37). The recent publication of a bronze object representing a cross attached to a leg, depicted from the knee to the foot (M), highlights its purpose as a votive object (Pl. V : 7). It probably functioned similarly to the two-dimensional plaques attached to the icons and to the votive hands holding a cross. This 5111- to 7th- c. votive object shows that in Byzantine practice any unattached limb of the human body may be combined with another motif according to the function of the whole object. Such practice was probably especially common in votive images, which eventually may have served as a direct model for the illu- minated initial letters. The relationship between Byzantine human-shaped initials and the Western precedents The first Byzantine example of the motif of " epsilon-hasta " is known only from the third quarter of the 9th c. (879-82) in the Paris, Gr. 510 (Pl. HI : 2), while disjointed body-parts in general became common only in the 10th c. They thus trailed the first Western examples by about two (35) Id., p. 68, no. 15. (36) Id., pp. 68-69.

Accordingly, scholars have proposed that these motifs were imported from the West through Italy, which was exposed to both Western and Byzantine influences (39). It is rather suprising, however, that when appeared, these motifs closely resembled the early, simple Western initials, while almost wholly ignoring new developments around initial letters evident in the Carolingian manuscripts. The Byzantine initials with human limbs show obvious similarities to those in the 8*-^ Latin manuscripts. Nevertheless, it will be further argued that neither the Paris Gregory nor the Paris and Patmos lectionar- ies (both assigned to c. 900) rely on Western models, but both could have grown out of a common source in Late Antiquity. As mentioned, the first example of a hand introduced into the initial comes from the 7th c. Liber Sacramentorum (Pl. Ill : 9). It is depicted as an open palm, a widely used characteristic of God's presence in Judaism and early Christianity. So it is not unusual visually save for drawn as a part of the letter and not in a narrative context. Its crude appearance sug- gests that it was copied from another source and was not yet established as a part of the initial letter. In the West the human limb was very popular during the 8th and early 9th c., and when used it was attached to any part of almost every letter of the alphabet, with a freedom typical of this tradition C°). During this period, hands, like the other body parts, hardly ever corresponded to the precise shape of the original letter but were used as a separate motif. Moreover, realistically treated human limbs appeared in fantastic (39) L. Brubaker, The Introduction of Painted Initials in Byzantium, in Scriptorium, 45/1 (1991), pp. 22-46. (40) For example : Homilies (Milan, Ambr., C. inf. 98, fol. 13a) : a hand attached to a fish (H. Zimmermann, Vorkatvlingische Miniaturen, Berlin, 1916, Vol. I, pl. 19e) ; Eucherius ( Rome Vitt. Em., 2107, fol. 12) : two heads emerging from the letter-stems (Ibid. , Vol. I, pl. 23b) ; Collectio Canonum ( Brussels , B.R., 2493 [8780-93], fol. 49v) : a human face uplifted by two dog-like creatures (Zimmermann, Vol. II, pl. 121d) ; Leges Langobardorum (St. Gall 731, p. 295) : two hands attached to the top and the bottom of "I" (Ibid., Vol. II, pl. 150b).

MAAYAN-FANAR combinations with zoomorphic and other anthropomorphic motifs. This feature can be found especially in the Sacramentary of Gellone (4l), where the initial letter may be constructed of a human hand attached to a duck, or a human leg attached to a fish (fol. 164v ; Pl. Ill : 12, 13). The interest in human limbs is said to be probably inspired by Byzantine iconography (42), perhaps through Italy, but this type of fantastic combi- nation is undoubtedly not Byzantine. It was most likely inspired by Insular models, transformed, as Teyssèdre has suggested, into a "more realistic type". This so-called realism, however, appears to be much more metamarphosed than any known later Byzantine example. It seems that finding the motif of detached human limbs in Latin man- uscripts first does not necessarily mean that it was invented in the West. Moreover, the representation of detached human limbs as a part of the ini- tial letter almost disappears from the pages of the Latin manuscripts after the 9th c., making way for the interplay of complete human bodies with zoomorphic and ornamental forms. Due to the small number of Byzantine manuscripts surviving from the pre-iconoclastic period, it is impossible to state whether human limbs appeared in the early Byzantine manuscripts as well. However, the con- tinuous tradition of the use of the human limbs, especially hands, in small-sized objects, including the votive objects discussed above, may point to a possible common model, which was assumed and transformed in the West. Thus, an S^-c. Latin manuscript from Italy (Bobbio), the Gregorius Moralia in Job {Milan, Ambr., B 159 sup.) (43), makes use of disjointed hands within different initials. All reproduce the same pattern of an upright right hand combined with additional elements (e.g., two arms, as if duplicating each other, substitute two vertical stems of the initial "H" (fol. 38v, Pl. IV : 2), a hand holding a band with inserted human face (fol. 14) O4), and a hand holds two bands terminating with profiles in initial "F' (PI. Ill : 11)). These initials are also close to the later lO^-c. Byzantine representations of the hand-motif, and have been used as evi- (42) F.

IV : 1 cf. 2) (45). However, comparison of the two shows that Byzantine hands display greater diversity than these Latin ones and preserve more realistic characteristics of hand shape and ges- ture. They do not seem to depend on such Latin examples, but may cor- respond to a common model. Note that all of them depict a right hand, without any formal variations, as if copied from some object. The sleeve is cut off in a way similar to early Greek and Roman votive hands, and to the ó^-c. sleeveless votive hands from the Syro-Palestinian region (Pl. IV : 4, 5 cf. 6, 14, 15). Another S^-c. Latin manuscript {Jerome, Commentary on Isaiah, Brescia, Bibliotheca Civica Queriniana, cod. A. III. 14) provides an example of three hands substituting the horizontal bars of the initial let- ter "E" (fol. 97, Pl. III : 10). The hand in the middle represents a distort- ed Greek benediction, probably taken from a Greek source. Such repre- sentation is common in Greco-Italian manuscripts (Pl. Ill : 5), but absent from the Constantinopolitan ones and those made in the Eastern provinces. It is not possible to say if the supposed model was also an ini- tial letter. If it was, it is likely to have been Greek. As noted earlier a ges- turing hand as a part of Epsilon became common in Byzantine book illu- mination, especially in lectionaries, due to its appearance in the incipit "The Lord said" (eIjīev ó xvqioç), which is specifically Greek. To sum up, both Byzantine and Latin initial letters make use of the hand motif. Its insertion into the initial Epsilon may have originally been inspired by the verses of John (1 : 1-9). It is not known if this tradition occurred first in Byzantium or if the 7th- c. Latin Liber Sacramentorum was the first to introduce this motif into the initial letter. Inspired by small objects and various connotations of detached human limbs as votive images and symbols of the power of God, and combined with a pictorial ability for distortion, Latin artists saw an opportunity to combine these motifs with various initial letters. In doing so, they turned human limbs into an additional ornamental motif. As mentioned, the supposed Western origins of such motifs are ques- tionable, but the fantastic combinations of these motifs with others are of (45) A. Grabar, Les manuscrits grecs enluminés de provenance italienne ( ix' -xi' siècles) ( Bibliothèque des Cahiers Archéologiques 8), Paris, 1972, p. 52, fig. 200.</page><page sequence="16">256 E. MAAYAN-FANAR "barbarian" influence. The increasing popularity of such elements in cer- tain 8th- and 9(h-c. Latin manuscripts may explain the variety of combina- tions. Yet the use of the "human limb" in itself seems exclusively Byzantine, being an essential continuation of Greco-Roman and early Christian traditions. It was apparently imported into Latin manuscripts through small-sized votive images. They, like the other small objects, might have served as the foremost model for the growing vocabulary of initial letter illumination. The idea of inserting human limbs into initials other than Epsilon may have reached Byzantium through the same sources of small objects whereby it reached the West. However, the Western distortions of the let- ter or of the image seem to have been unacceptable in Byzantium. This fact may explain the realistic features of human limbs, contrary to highly patterned zoomorphic representations. The transitional period of the late 9th and the 10th c. allowed some experimental depictions with the human body, which may explain their extensive use. All Byzantine manuscripts whose initial letters consist of human limbs show variations of the same type, thus seeming to reflect a common model. Such a model is most evi- dent in the manuscripts attributed to Constantinople and the Eastern provinces, not in the Greco-Italian manuscripts. The use of the human limbs, especially in lectionaries, may point to some problems of representing the whole body of Christ. Furthermore, diversification of initials shaped as body parts occurs mostly in the first known illuminated lectionaries of c. 900 : Paris 277 and Patmos 70. This, as well as the analysis of other aspects of these manuscripts, leads to the conclusion that the model may have emerged at the time of the icono- clastic controversy. If this was indeed the case, the insertion of body parts as substitutes for the whole human figure benefited from a robust theological setting. Such manuscripts may have appeared in Byzantium already in the 8th c., contemporary with the 8th- and 9th-c. Latin manuscripts with body-part representations. Such models may well have survived in the provinces but might have been absent from the Metropolitan area at the time of the Paris Gregory, or were deliberately shunned in this manuscript. Only the choice of the " epsilon-hasta " rep- resentation in this manuscript, closely connected to the motif of the hand, seems established, and may go back to the Late Antique vocabulary C6). (46) Maayan-Fanar, Byzantine Pictorial Initials, Chapter IC, p. 26.</page><page sequence="17">THE FRAGMENTARY BODY 257 The expansion of motifs composed of other body parts may well have had an iconoclastic background, and was abandoned in the Paris Gregory in favor of more classical letter illumination. The avoidance of full-body representation was especially common in monastic circles, where this tradition was alive at least until the middle of the 1 1th c. (47). Such a tradition also continued to exist in the much later lectionaries. It can be found in luxurious manuscripts of Constantino- politan origin, for example, Oxford, Bodleian Library, Canon, Gr. 92 (late 1 P-early^"1 c.) (48). Thus, the introduction of the motif of the human limbs into Byzantine initial letters seems to have had no need for direct models taken from Latin manuscripts. Despite the interval in time, the Byzantine tradition of the use of the human limbs in manuscript decoration seems more estab- lished than the Western. A further attempt will be made to understand a possible connection of the initial letters composed of human limbs to the text of the specific manuscripts, and their more general significance as a part through which the qualities of the whole might be discovered. The lectionary : The initial as a sign or literal illustration ? Since disjointed human limbs are especially common in the manu- scripts of the lectionary context, it is important to study the text-image relationship in the two earliest illuminated Byzantine lectionaries, Paris 277 and Patmos 70, of c. 900. Comparison of the motif enclosed in the initial with the adjacent verse reveals that in the significant number of cases the motif is literally connected to the words of the text. Thus, legs composing the initial "II" ( Patmos 70, fol. 123 v, Mt. 25 : 41b) visually render the word "Depart (go)" (JtoçeveoGe) (Pl. II : 2). Another verse shows a connection between the initial "H" ( Patmos 70, (47) Galavaris mentions the survival of an aniconic tradition in the lP-c. manuscripts from Mount Athos, explaining it by the fear of the image among the monks.

(r|X,0ov ovv oí oiQaxiœxai). In these examples the asso- ciation is obvious. These legs function as symbolic narrative, avoiding actual representation. Hands in both manuscripts are often represented substituting the cen- tral bar of the initial Epsilon, and in some cases they hold small objects. These correspond directly to the adjacent text. For example, a scythe ( Patmos 70, fol. 33v) symbolizes the act of reaping, in keeping with the adjacent text of John 4 : 38 : "I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor" (Pl. Ill : 6). In another example ( Patmos 70, fol. 45v) a hand extends deep into the text column, lightly holding a fish (Pl. Ill : 7). The motif corresponds directly to Luke 24 : 42 : "They gave him a piece of broiled fish (IxOúoç). . .". Not only is the fish represented, but also the act of bestowing. A similarly depicted object may be interpreted variously, depending on the immediate textual context. Thus, a hand holds two round objects {Patmos 70, fol. 39v), which from the adjacent verse of John 10 : 31 prove to be stones : "The Jews took up stones again to stone him". In Paris 277, fol. 85 a similar round object represents bread, corresponding to John 21 : 13 : "Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them. . Illustrating the verse of Mt. 20 : 10b ( Paris 277, fol. 125), a similar object now is the coin (òr)váç&gt;iov), which according to the Gospel parable was given to each laborer. The same conclusion can be reached concerning a stick-shaped object. In the context of Mt. 24 : 48-49 (Paris 211, fol. 19 ; Patmos 70, fol. 155v) it corresponds to the weak slave, who beats his fellow slaves. In John 19 : 19, "Pilate also had an inscription written and put on the cross", this object corresponds to the word eyQcnļ&gt;ev ( Paris 277, fol. 71, Pl. II :3 ; Patmos 70, fol. 211, 230), representing a pen. In one more case Mt. 26 : 51 ( Paris 211, fol. 28v), a hand holds a red stick (?) - here a sword according to the text : "...one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's..." (...èxxEÍvaç xf)v xtÍQO. ájtéojtaoev xrļv ná/aigav...). Moreover, the initial divides the text and relates directly to the relevant part of the sentence. In all the above cases a hand stands for the whole figure, summarizing the essence of the text in one sign. This method of literal connection between an object held by a hand and the text survives in later lectionaries. It can be seen, for example, in Sinai</page><page sequence="19">THE FRAGMENTARY BODY 259 213 (49). On fol. 90 a hand is inserted into an initial Epsilon. It holds a cross, corresponding directly to the verse of Mt. 10 : 38 : "and whoever does not take up the cross (xòv otcxuqóv) and follow me is not worthy of me" (Pl. III : 8). Some anthropomorphic elements in Paris 277 and Patmos 70 may be understood as symbols of Christ, or God the Father. One example is the initial "2", which is composed of two hands with open palms, substitut- ing the contour of the letter (Pl. 1 : 6). This insertion of the motif of hands into the initial is highly unusual. In each of the two lectionaries the letter appears in different verses, and carries different meanings. In Patmos 70 the letter starts Mt. 27 : 10b (fol. 195v), corresponding to the verse : "the Lord commanded me". This representation is one of the numerous repre- sentations of a hand signifying speech (the Lord's speech in this case). The same motif appears to construct the same letter in Paris 277, corre- sponding to the last word of the verse of Mt. 27 : 22, "(Let him be) cru- cified" (. ..2TavQW0T)T(JL&gt;, fol. 49), and again on fol. 59 relating to Mt. 27 : 35, "And they crucified him. . ." (otauQáxxmeç ôè avxóv...). Clearly the motif of two outstretched hands is connected here not just to the same let- ter but illustrates the same word. The motif of outstretched hands appears in these manuscripts also in connection with the initial Tau ("T") several times. Two open palms, extending to either side of the vertical stem of the letter, appear here as an additional element and do not play any role in the initial letter struc- ture ( Patmos 70, fol. 180v ; Paris 277, fol. 21v, fol. 23v, fol. 36v, fol. 71). The connection of this motif with the initial "T" is also highly unusu- al (50). However, here the connection with the text has to be studied inde- pendently in each case. At least twice ( Paris 277, fol. 21 v and 71) the (49) However, the repetition of motifs and the use of repeated patterns as ini- tials only at the beginning of the lessons and as marginal decorations attest that in most cases the verse and the motifs are not directly related. (50) The only similar composition occurs in the lO^-c. lectionary in Athens National Library, cod. 59, fol. lOv. Here, however, instead of the hands two grif- fon heads extend to either side of the vertical letter stem. A. Marava- Chatzinicolaou and C.

The first appearance of hands extending to both sides of the vertical stem of "T" is found at the beginning of Mt. 25 : 34 ( París 277, fol. 21). This verse relates to the Last Judgment. The motif seems to correspond directly to the words of the passage : "(And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left). Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. . The motif may emphasize the words of the verse and function as direction signs. The initial, however, does not appear at the beginning of the verse but only in connection with its second sentence. The illustration might have been made for the previous verse, and it appears here because of the better connection between the letter Tau and the decorative element. The same motif appears on fol. 71 corresponding to John 19 : 15 : "...Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King?" (xòv ßaaiXia í)[ACOV oxauQcóooa) (Pl. II : 3). Here the connection was probably to the crucifixion. The symbolical concept of the letter Tau as the cross was well known since early Christianity and is represented in various Latin (52) and Byzantine manuscripts ("). In this particular manuscript, where hands and legs serve as a symbolic representation of the body, two hands pro- truding from either side of the vertical stem of "T" may well allude to the crucified Jesus. This symbolism is based on John 21 :18. The hands stretched outwards in prayer as a sign of God are mentioned in the Odes of Solomon : "I extended my hands and allowed my Lord, For the expan- sion of my hands is His sign. And my extension is the upright cross" (54). (5 1) A similar motif attached to "T" appears in Paris 277 on fol. 23 v (Mt. 26 : 11) and on fol. 36v (John 15 : 18) and Patmos 70, fol. 180v (John 15 : 18). In these cases the connection between text and initial seems uncertain. (52) The Sacramentary of Gellone (790-c. 804) contains the first known example of such a crucifix-initial, fol. 143v. (53) For example, in the later Byzantine lectionary (Mount Athos, Monastery ofDionysiou, cod. 587m) of 1059, the initial Tau (fol. 97), is formed by the fig- ure of the crucified Christ, corresponding to the symbolism of the letter Tau. The image is part of a wider marginal scene, which also includes the two crucified thieves. (54) Ode 27, cited after J. H. Charlesworth, ed. and trans., The Odes of Solomon, Montana, 1977, p. 106. And also: "I extended my hands and approach- ed my Lord, For the expansion of my hands is His sign. And my extension is the common cross, That was lifted up on the way of the Righteous One". Ode 42, Ibid., p. 145</page><page sequence="21">THE FRAGMENTARY BODY 261 This gesture had liturgical importance, being used as a part of the bap- tismal rite (55). The explanation of hands stretched out sideways was made by Tertullian, who relates to the position of hands in prayer, stretching out as in Christ's crucifixion : "We, however, not only raise our hands, we even stretch them out and by adopting the attitude of the suffering Lord (on the Cross) we glorify Christ also while at prayer" (56). It may therefore be concluded that the appearance of hands in prayer in certain cases of the initials "2" and "T" is a symbol alluding to the crucifixion (57). Against this background, additional anthropomorphic elements in the two lectionaries may perhaps be seen as a symbol of Christ. For instance, in Patmos 70 (fol. 20v), the vertical stems of an initial "II" end with two legs wearing boots, while two hands (though overcolored) hold the stems. A cross is indicated on top of the initial. This initial starts John 6 : 42b : "How can he now say, 'I have come down from heaven' ?" It seems that here too, the motif substitutes the figure of Christ. The same motif in Paris 277 (fol. 21) does not correspond to this symbolism but to the gen- eral action of moving, starting the word JtQOoeXBcov (having approached) of Mi. 25 : 20 (Pl. 1 : 3). The hint at the aniconic representation of God may also be more spe- cific. For example, the vertical stems of the initial "II" ( Patmos 70, fol. 44) are represented by two hands holding the horizontal bar of the letter, starting the word "Father" (Ilaxeg) in relation to God in different verses. Examples may be given from John 12 :27b ( Patmos 70, fol. 44), John 1 1 : 41b ( Patmos 70, fol. 140), and Luke 23 : 46b ( Patmos 70, fol. 202 ; Paris 277, fol. 53v). Note that when the same initial does not correspond direct- ly to Christ's or God the Father's symbolism, non-anthropomorphic motifs are preferred (e.g., Patmos 70, fol. 50v, John 15 : 2). Thus, the connection between text and image is not accidental, even if not immediately evident. In some cases it is symbolic, in others literal. (55) D. Ploou, The Attitude of the Outspread Hands ('Orante') in Early Christian Literature and Art, in The Expository Times, 23 (1911-1912), p. 199. (56) G. Q. Reuners, The Terminology of the Holy Cross in Early Christian Literature as Based upon Old Testament Typology, Nijmegen, 1965, pp. 151-152. (57) In early Christian art the crucifixion may also be represented by means of outstretched hands (e.g., the crucifixion on the carved panel of the door of the 5lh-c. St. Sabina in Rome. Here the outstretched hands of Christ are stressed, while the cross is given as a clue).</page><page sequence="22">262 E. MAAYAN-FANAR Such unusual emphasis on the body parts, especially connected to the symbolism of God, reveals a restrictive attitude to figurai representation. It thus serves as further evidence of a model for both manuscripts, which might well occur in the iconoclastic period. Despite the above findings, some of the anthropomorphic motifs appear to be regularly connected to certain letters, without any visible relation to the adjacent text. So although in the cases mentioned above the foot motif can correspond directly to the text, the repetition of the same motif may create an association between the anthropomorphic element and the initial letter shape. The transformation of the lower part of the vertical stems of various letters (mainly "T", "II", and "O") into legs is well attested in Patmos 70 (Pl. V : 3). This transformation, albeit less common, occurs in Paris 277 as well (Pl. V : 2). This motif becomes a repeated one quite unconnected to the text. Another example is the initial "I", which is always topped by a hand in Greek benediction (PI. 1:1) (5S). A general connection between the hand in the Greek blessing gesture and the letter "I" is only to be expected. "I", the first letter of Christ's name, was probably originally used to indicate him. But here it seems to appear as a fixed motif. Conclusions Evidence of disjointed human limbs in Byzantine initial letters exists only from the end of the 9th c. This trailed their appearance in Western ini- tials by more than a c., a fact that has raised suggestions as to their depen- dence on some Western precedents. However, analysis of the surviving material shows that first examples of such initials might have appeared in Byzantine manuscripts already in the 8th c., contemporary with the earli- est Latin initials of this kind.

PLATE V</page><page sequence="28">THE FRAGMENTARY BODY 263 ornamental forms, Byzantine artists retained their human characteristics. They were actually used to substitute the whole figure. An attempt to avoid the representation of the whole human body by substituting impersonal body parts attests to a conservative attitude to the insertion of the human body into initial letters, probably in response to the iconoclastic polemic. Found in the 9th c. in the manuscripts of different contents, the use of disjointed human limbs is nevertheless especially connected to lectionar- ies, reflecting an interest in the problem of the representation of God Incarnate. The Paris and Patmos lectionaries show that different disjoint- ed human body parts were used as visualizations of God and human actions. Many of these images have a direct connection with the text of the Gospels. Yet they may also have symbolic implications. When brought into the church during the liturgical service, lectionar- ies symbolize Christ himself. Thus, avoidance of the whole human figure in the lectionaries can be explained by the sacred nature of the text, and use of the initials as visual memory signs. These signs have a dual role. They stress the liturgical significance of the verse, and also emphasize its meaning by the literal, very compressed, references to the actual text of the manuscript. This tradition of summarizing a narrative by means of a human limb is attested even in the much later lectionaries. For example, in the luxurious lectionary made after the mid- IP c. ( London , BL, Loan 36/23, fol. 183v) (59), an initial "T" ends with a leg colored in red and placed inside a golden bowl filled with water. The initial opens a lection on the Washing of feet, thus directly relating to the text. A desire to pro- tect such holy books from representation of the human figure is well attested even in the luxurious Oxford lectionary (Bodl. lib., Canon., Gr. 92). This practice continued in provincial and Constantinopolitan lec- tionaries, even when in the 1 1th c. another form of lectionary illumination, including scenes from the life of Jesus, became common.
