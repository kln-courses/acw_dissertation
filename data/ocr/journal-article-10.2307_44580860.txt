Stapp National Highway Safety Bureau THE LIVING BODY is an articulated system of viscous -elastic masses enclosing liquid and gaseous compartments. The rigidity of the articulations and of the compartment walls is determined by the stiffening of opposing sets of muscles surrounding the joint or the body cavity. This can modulate mechanical impedance characteristics of the whole body (13, 14, 17, 52, 55)** through a limited range of increase in resonant frequency with increasing stiffness. This was demonstrated by Coerman (14) and Edwards and Lang (17) with animal and human subjects in various body postures and states of muscle tension on a shake table, where res- onant frequency could be increased from 5 up to 8 cps by muscle stiffening. Morris, Lucas, and Bressler (30) postulated that breath - holding, combined with muscle tension in the abdominal and thoracic walls, provides an "inflatable support" to the spinal column during two-handed lifting of weights in the order of 200 lb from the floor with legs held straight. Sup- * Research reported in this paper is being carried out under the sponsorship of the National Highway Safety Bureau of the Dept. of Transportation. The opinions, findings, and conclusions in this paper are those of the authors and not necessarily those of the National Highway Safety Bureau. **Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. porting data were obtained from measurements on 10 healthy male subjects in a series of 40 static and dynamic lifting experiments in which muscle tension, abdominal and thoracic pneumatic pressures, and lever arms of the lifting forces were measured. The difference in calculated force to lift 200 lb through body levers was 600 lb due to "inflatable support" of combined breath -holding and muscle tension, or 29% re- duction from a calculated 2071 lb of force required without "inflatable support." In terms of inertial loading on the mass of the trunk resisted by such an "inflatable support," transmitted to a foot rest through braced legs during impact deceleration, a significant decrease in loading against an upper torso restraint could be postulated. Stapp (40) measured loads on restraint straps in 12 out of a series of 51 experiments with human subjects seated facing forward during deceleration, with knees at 90 deg so that essentially no load could be transmitted to the foot rest. Comparison was made of slack and tightened shoulder straps with a snug lap belt, and of restraints consisting of shoulder straps, lap belt and inverted -V leg straps from the buckle, fairing around the inner thighs to the rear corners of the seat, with addition of a 21 lb back parachute for three exposures. Comparison of load on restraints with the calculated subject mass times acceleration gave approximately corresponding values, at decelerations ranging from 3.5 to 39.5 times grav- ity. Load distribution on component straps varied with their ABSTRACT The value of the restraint by legs and arms of a human being has been generally disregarded in the development of restraint systems for occupants of an automobile. As part of a series of tests on human beings in automotive restraints conducted for the National Bureau of Standards by the 6571st Aeromedicai Research Laboratory, Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, measurements were made of the forces exerted on a foot rest during 15 g decelerations. Calculations re- vealed that for "lap belt only" configuration, 26% of the subject's kinetic energy absorbed was attributed to the seat belt and 55% attributed to the restraint by the legs. 3163</page><page sequence="2">3164 R.

With in- verted-V leg straps, the loading was approximately 30% to shoulder straps, 45% to the lap belt, and 25% to the leg straps. There was no attempt to account for total energy dissipation. Stapp, et al. (46) also observed the effect of pitch angle in seated subjects restrained by straps during forward facing impact deceleration. As the seat pitch angle is reclined from vertical, the load component during deceleration at right angles to the seat bottom increases with corresponding rise in friction until the horizontal component no longer slides the subject forward in the seat. This critical angle could be effectively applied to automobile seat design. Mechanical energy dissipation as heat from internal organ viscosity can be sufficient to cause fatal hyperthermia, ac- cording to Nickerson (31), on the basis of 9 fatalities from overheating among 61 dogs exposed to 4-40 cps of 0.2-2.0 in. amplitude for a calculated 0.4-9.8 times gravity sus- tained for intervals of 30-600 minutes on a shake table. Hardy (21) calculated that a dog shaken at 4 times gravity at 13 cps would absorb 600 kilocalories/hr, or 10 times basal metabolic heat production, which would account for rectal temperatures ranging 106-117 F observed in the 9 fatalities of Nickerson's series. More heat was generated than could be dissipated by panting and convection, since dogs cannot sweat. An unmeasured quantity of energy is dissipated by lateral deformation and strain waves of body walls, observed by Bierman (10) and by Weis, et al. (56, 57), resulting from excitation by a single whole body impact of very short dura- tion, recorded by high-speed sequence X-ray photography. Concurrent displacement and injury to internal organs of experimental animal subjects at several times the exposure thresholds submitted to by human volunteers indicate a sig- nificant component of total impact energy input thus in- ternally dissipated. Ruff (33) measured the strain of static and dynamic com- pression loading on the spine up to fracture at approximately 26 times gravity, with loads in the order of 900-1200 lb to failure. This would indicate considerable capacity for energy r absorption by tissue deformation, subject to resonance ef- fects. Latham (26) noted resonant response in the seated upright position on a shake table or during single impact of an upward ejection seat by a hammer blow, of whole body with respect to the seat, approximately 5 cps; between upper and lower body segments, approximately 8-11 cps; and of the head with respect to the trunk, 18-21 cps. These external and internal energy losses contribute to discrepancies between total impact energy input, and mea- sured loading on restraints, including foot rests for proprio - tonic restraint during impact deceleration. A considerable number of human impact deceleration experiments have been resported by Armstrong (1), Beeding (2-6), Bierman (8-10), Holcomb (23), Lewis (27), Ryan (34- 36), Shaw (38), Stapp (40-47), Swearingen (49, 51), and Weis -- in none of which the concept of total energy ac- counting has been applied, as described in the analysis of results in this report. Performance of restraint straps cannot be correctly evaluated without accounting for discrepancies in measurements due to propriotonic restraint effects applied at the discretion of the human subject. No approximation of internal energy losses could be attempted without fairly accurate accounting of external energy dissipation. INTRODUCTION The value of the restraint by the legs and arms of a hu- man being has been generally disregarded in the develop- ment of restraint systems for occupants of an automobile. Only in minor decelerations such as emergency braking has there been any thought of the value of such restraint. No provisions are made in existing automotive designs to take advantage of whatever potential this type of "propriotonic" restraint may offer. The experience of trying to maintain one's position in a crowded bus in emergency braking stop of approximately 0.5 g would tend to discount the ability of the human being to support himself significantly in the 30 g deceleration of a vehicle crashing into a tree, car, or an abutment. In a series of tests on men in automotive restraints conducted for the National Bureau of Standards by the 6571st Aero- medical Research Laboratory, Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, there appeared in the mass analysis of the data some evidence of significant restraint by the legs of the humans when tested in a simulated automobile crash up to deceleration of 16.3 g. Because of this evidence, ad- ditional tests were carried out on humans riding the sled of the Daisy Decelerator at Holloman with lap belt only and with lap belt and upper torso restraints, making specific measurements of the forces exerted on a foot rest during deceleration. The time -force histories of these pedal forces during deceleration were such that no conscious or reflex muscular effort could account for the magnitudes of the forces. The entire sled deceleration and the major loading of the pedal force indicators occurred in 100 ms. The minimum r response time for elementary muscular reaction has been observed to be between 150 and 200 ms (29). The forces measured on the pedals indicated an initial preload and then a significant increase of force in phase with the deceleration of the sled. These forces appear to be the result of two distinct mechanical properties of the restraint by the legs. The first is the preload imposed by the test subject by brac- ing himself against the seat back and exerting leg force against the foot rest. The tensed or contracted muscle ap- proaches Hook's law of arithmetical proportionality between force and elongation (48). The muscle apparently main- tains this property under dynamic loading. Since, under small forward displacement of the hip when restrained by the seat belt, the knee angle changes little (less than 20 deg), the muscle's length changes only slightly, maintaining almost a constant force equivalent to the preload. The</page><page sequence="3">MUSCULAR RESTRAINT DURING SLED DECELERATION 3165 second portion of the load which increases directly propor- tional to the acceleration is the sum of the forces due to the inertia of the pedal force plates above the sensing ele- ments and the inertia of the leg below the knee, foot, and shoes that are decelerated effectively as a part of the sled. The muscular and seat belt restraints are a necessary adjunct to this action, maintaining the feet and lower legs in proper quasi -static position. The limitations of these mechanical properties were not determined in this series of tests. It appears from the data obtained that the contribution which can be made by muscular restraint is worthy of further study and will have definite application in the development of anthropomorphic dummies which respond realistically in a dynamic environment and possibly in the design of pro- visions within the automobile to take advantage of the sig- nificant "propriotonic" restraint. TEST PROCEDURES The human test population for the February 1968 runs reported herein consisted of 15 male U.S. Air Force person- nel with ranks from Airman First Class to Major, with weights of 113.8-190.5 lb, heights of 66.4-73.9 in., and ages of 21-38 years. Most of the subjects had 2 or 3 years* experi- ence riding deceleration sleds with a minimum of one ride a month. The human tests on the Daisy Decelerator at Holloman Air Force Base (12) were conducted in a hard test seat whose geometry was determined by a series of tests conducted us- ing an anthropomorphic dummy under dynamic loading. The angle of the test seat pan was adjusted so that seat belt loads were equivalent to those obtained under the same dy- namic loading in an automobile production seat (1). Fig. 1 gives the basic geometric measurements of the test seat on the sled. Note that the seat pan angle slopes down from the hinge of the seat to the portion under the knees at an angle of 5 deg; it was determined in the tests (1) that dummies restrained by seat belts in production seats had a hip point trajectory down and forward. The subjects were restrained either with the lap belt re- straint only or with a lap belt and upper torso restraint. Prior to the deceleration, the tension in the lap belt was es- tablished at 5 lb and the angle of lap belt from its anchorage to its position on the subject was 45 deg with the horizontal. When the upper torso restraint was used, it was tensioned to 5 lb over a 3 in. cube placed upon the chest and then the cube was removed, thereby establishing a specific slack in the belt. The lower end of the upper torso restraint was at- tached to the identical point as the right anchorage of the lap belt. The upper anchorage was located approximately 6 in. off the center line of the subject in the direction of sled motion and 12 in. behind and above the center line of the shoulders. The shape of the deceleration pulse used for the test was essentially that of the half sine wave with a deceleration distance of 9 in. Various entrance or initial velocities of the sled were used, ranging 8-20 fps. The loads exerted by the legs of the riders were measured by a pedal force device J pedal force'¿&gt; I INDICATOR / 2 -AXIS^-^^ I TRANSDUCERS HEEL STOP- / ill ' * to al k&gt; al el 1b / Y-AXIS RETAINER ' - Y-AXIS ' / TRANSDUCER M TRANSDUCER ' ¿-X-AXIS VT X-AXIS - ^ TRANSDUCER TRANSDUCER TYPICAL BRIDGE CIRCUIT R2aR4(0N BACK) X ^XÎT/BRÎO6E- - ^ FWO A- 0 y V.

A sketch of the instrumentation and its method of operation appears in Fig. 2. The pedal force instrument was sloped at 45 deg with the horizontal providing a flat plat- form for each foot (Fig. 3). The forces perpendicular to the 45 deg plane and parallel to the 45 deg plane in the direc- tion of the sled travel and perpendicular to the sled travel were measured by appropriate strain gages. Markings were appropriately placed upon the subject (Fig. 4) so that photo- metric determination could be made of his body movements during the simulated crash from high-speed motion picture films taken from several angles at a 1000 frames/sec rate. Fig. 5 is a picture of one of the test subjects during the deceleration when restrained by a lap belt and upper torso restraint. Fig. 6 is a typical oscillograph trace obtained during these human runs recording the time history of the water brake pressure, sled deceleration, loads in each leg as in- dicated above, and loads of the upper torso restraint and lap belt as well. Fig. 3 - Subject with feet in proper position on pedal force indicators Fig. 4 - Instrumented subject awaiting countdown TEST RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Table 1 is a summary of that data giving pertinent de- tails of the sled parameters, the weight of the test subject, the various resultant forces developed in the pedal force indicator, and the loads in the restraining systems. The typical trace (Fig. 6) indicates the existence of some degree of preloading of the legs by the subject at the time the deceleration is initiated (start of the simulated crash). The total force measured by the pedal force indicators is the sum of the preload of the legs plus the force from the effective mass decelerating with the sled which acts on the strain gage elements of the pedal force indicator. This ef- fective mass consists of the mass of the plates of the pedal force indicator between the sole of the foot and the trans- ducers, the shoes of the subject, his feet, and more or less closely coupled portions of his legs. It will be noted that the increase in the indicated force above that of the preload of the legs of the force -time history is essentially in phase with the sled deceleration. This increase and the fact that Fig. 5 - Human test subject during deceleration RUN 4076 (COMBINED RESTRAINT) BRAKE PRESS^^^- SLED q RIGHT DIAC. LOWER LEFT DIAG.

As a result of the preload, the loads on the pedals are at a significant level while the sled is experiencing all the deceleration displacement. By this loading there is an appreciable amount of kinetic energy of the subject's body which is transferred to the sled (or acts as part of the sled) and this portion of the subject's kinetic energy is dissipated in the water brake of the sled. Addi- tional energy is absorbed in the legs as the subject is dis- placed on the seat. Note that the seat belt in typical fashion does not reach significant loads until most of the sled de- celeration displacement has taken place. Under these con- ditions, a greater portion of the kinetic energy of the re- strained subject is normally absorbed by stretch of the seat belt rather than having considerable effective mass trans- ferred to the sled by load in the seat belt. Fig. 7 presents the sum of the horizontal components of the peak leg forces of human subjects as a function of peak sled decelerations in the series of 30 runs. There appears to be only a general trend for the force to increase with in- creased g, but if in each case the preload of the legs, which varies greatly from subject to subject, is subtracted from the total forces to obtain a net force, then a definite correlation between the increased load and g is established, as indicated in Fig. 8. The coefficient of this correlation is greater than 0.9.

From this curve the average portion of body inertia, which acts as a part of the sled, was equivalent to 27.7 lb. The upper limit of this relationship was not determined but it is reasonable to assume that this inertia would act similarly at 30 g when the body is generally constrained by seat belts in the same position with respect to the pedals. Fig. 9 is a plot of the horizontal component of the force on the pedal force indicator versus displacement of the sled for run 4089, the subject restrained by lap belt only. The force values were obtained by correcting the pedal force indications for direction of the pedal force indicator orien- tation and for forces contributed by the fixed masses of the indicator acting on the sensing element. The energy dissipated as part of the sled consists of two mechanical actions. The first is that due to the 27.7 lb/g acting as a fixed portion of the sled as determined from Fig. 8 and represents 20% of the weight of the subject of run 4089. The energy dissipated due to this weight acting as a fixed part of the sled is represented by the area under the curve A and above the preload line, assuming that the pre- load remains constant during the deceleration. The remaining energy absorbed by a portion of the sub- ject's body weight acting as part of the sled is determined l000r O-LAP BELT ONLY FEB I968 SERIES ^ 900 - a- COMBINED RESTRAINT RUNS 4059-4095 Z - A Oû ° o 0 3K J&amp; 700 - ° .

The force indicated as "preload" on Fig. 9 taken at the 0 deceleration displacement represents the load imposed by the subject bracing in the seat. Prior to deceleration the preload force is applied to the back of the seat. After the subject's back leaves the seat, all the preload force is effective in transferring energy to the sled. The triangular segment above curve B and under the preload line is an estimate of the unloading of the back of the seat. This estimate was based on the forces generated by the sled deceleration acting on the effective body weight braced in the seat by the legs of the subject which is 111.3 lb or 80% of his total weight. The curve B (Fig. 9) is a representation of the force gen- erated by the sled deceleration on the effective body weight of subject versus sled displacement. The force was deter- mined by multiplying the g of the sled at the corresponding displacement by the effective weight of the subject (111.3 lb). For comparison purposes, Fig. 10 similarly presents a computation of the subject's kinetic energy transferred to the sled by the seat belt and dissipated by the water brake of the sled for run 4089. The kinetic energy dissipated in this manner was 124.2 ft -lb. A series of experiments was performed in the identical geometric configuration of seat and belt to those of the tests. A horizontal load was applied over the back of an anthropomorphic dummy until the sub- ject test loads were reached in the seat belt. These values were used to compute the horizontal components of force in the tests. At these relatively low levels of seat belt loading, the static and dynamic stretch of the belt is assumed to be equal. Figs. 11 and 12 are identical analyses to those of Fig. 9 and 10, but for run 4076, in which the subject was restrained by an upper torso and lap belt combination.

As previously stated, a force moving through a distance represents energy. Not only are the forces of the legs and seat belts acting through displacement of the sled but are also acting as the subject is displaced with respect to the sled. The sum of the two displacements with respect to the ground, multiplied by the appropriate forces, represents the total energy dissipated.

Figs. 15 and 16 are identical analyses for body displace- ment on the sled, run 4076, using lap belt and upper torso restraint, and represent 105.3 ft -lb absorbed in the legs and 181.1 ft -lb absorbed in the seat belt and upper torso re- straint. 600 r- RUN 4089 (LAP BELT ONLY) ÎZj I5.5g, 19.0 ft/sec » 500 - AREA- 76.1 ft-lbs / ' / ' 400 / * 0 / ^ 300 - / 1 » 300 - / / 8 - » // -200 - ,/ - i co y0 C CS S^.oo - OS &lt;=&gt; Jw o o OÖC 0 (¡ ļ i ļ J HIP PO I HĪ HORIZONTAL DISPLACEMENT, inches Fig. 14 - Horizontal seat belt load versus hip point dis- placement, run 4089 2 Using the formula, KE = 1/2 MV , the kinetic energy of the subject of run 4089 using lap belt only was 781 ft-lb; for run 4076 with subject using torso and lap belt combina- tion was 884 ft-lb. The percentages of energy absorbed by the various seat belt and leg mechanisms is given in Table 2. Note that the sums of the energies absorbed by the various mechanisms do not equal the total kinetic energy of the subject. The methods of energy determination made are of unknown accuracy, further other mechanisms of energy ab- sorption exist but were not computed, such as friction be- tween the subject and seat, and flexing of the various body parts, such as the back, arms, and neck, against muscular resistance. As a matter of interest, the following estimate of the amount of kinetic energy that might be absorbed by the "propriotonic" leg restraint in a 30 mph (44 fps) crash into a solid barrier is made. The following are assumed: 1. Total body weight of 50th percentile male plus shoes is 165.5 lb. (22). 2. Effective portion of body weight acting fixed on the foot rest, 27.7 lb (Fig. 8). 3. The forward motion of the center of gravity of the remaining body of 139 lb is 0.75 ft when restrained by the lap belt only. 4. 30 g maximum deceleration for 1/2 sine wave shaped deceleration curve.

Vehicle stopping distance is 19 in. 6. Average male maximum preload by bracing in a hard back seat is 845 lb (29). 7. The preload is maintained at a constant level of force throughout the deceleration (Fig. 13). Fig. 17 is a plot of the force generated by the fixed por- tion of the subject's weight (essentially shoes, feet, lower leg) exposed to the 1/2 sine deceleration versus the vehicle displacement. The area under this curve represents 845 ft -lb. Curve A of Fig. 18 is a plot of the continuously imposed preload through the entire vehicle deceleration. The area under this curve does not represent kinetic energy trans- ferred to the vehicle until corrected by curve B, indicating when the portion of the body restrained by the legs responds to the deceleration forces.

The hips as an indication of the center of gravity of the body are displaced on the seat under the constant force of the preload and thus the area under this curve represents 636.7 ft-lb of energy absorbed in the legs by the movement of the body relative to the seat. The analysis indicates that the legs might effect an energy absorption up to 55 °]o of the kinetic energy of a 50th percentile individual crashing from 30 mph if appropriate foot rests and back supports for brac- ing with the legs were provided within the vehicle. Further energy absorption could be accomplished by proper bracing of the arms.

CONCLUSIONS A series of tests on human subjects has been conducted which indicate that significant portions of the kinetic energy of the human being involved in a crash may be absorbed by the dynamic "proprio tonic" restraint of the legs. A series of tests should be carried out in the biomedical laboratory to determine directly the magnitudes of this ef- fect at all levels of loading, not only for the legs, but the arms as well. Consideration should be given to providing, in automotive design, adequate means for bracing of the subject with his legs to take advantage of this restraint in crashes. Similarly the strength and design of rims of steer- ing wheels on which the human may make some effort to restrain himself should be reexamined. A mechanism should be developed for the legs of anthropomorphic dummies used in crash simulations which will exhibit this loading char- acteristic under dynamic conditions. REFERENCES 1. R. W.
