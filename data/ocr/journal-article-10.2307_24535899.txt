ABSTRACT The Copernican revolution was truly a typical scientific one, as understood by practis ing scientists today. In addition it has had broad and far-reaching humanistic conse quences, even in this Twentieth Century. It is commonplace nowadays to speak of a Copernican revolution. What pre cisely is meant? Does the term connote anything more or less than the hackneyed phrase "scientific revolution"? In order to consider this question, we had better ascertain first just who Copernicus was and just what he did. Consulting so-called intellectual his torians, we are surprised to find a wide range of views. At one extreme, Coper nicus is simply ignored. For example, there is no mention of him at all in the index of the abridged (600 pp ,)A Study of History by the English historian Arnold Joseph Toynbee (1889- ). The Vien nese historian Friedrich Heers regards Copernicus as essentially a medieval figure, in a class with the speculative Swiss physician Paracelsus (1493?—1541) and the German Protestant free-thinker Sebastian Franck ( 1499?—1542). The Columbia University philosopher John Herman Randall, Jr. (1899- ) sees him as a typical Renaissance man, creator of the Copernican revolution, which is re garded as consummated later by the Italian physicist Galileo Galilei (1564— 1642), but which, in no sense, is to be con sidered as significant as the revolution by the French mathematical philosopher René Descartes (1590-1650), who sup posedly created a new physics. At the 'Remarks at the February 16,1973 meeting of the Philosophical Society of Washington, Washington, D.C., commemoration of the 500th anniversary of Copernicus' birth. other extreme, the U.C.L.A. philoso pher William James Durant (1885- ) groups him with the German theologian Martin Luther (1483-1546), the French writer Voltaire (1694-1778), and the English naturalist Charles Robert Dar win (1861-1882) as the "most powerful personalities in the modern world." In contrast with the opinions of modern socially-minded thinkers, Durant con cludes in Lessons of History (1968) that "the initiative individual—the great man, the hero, the 'genius'—regains his place as a formative force in history." Popular authors, too, exhibit a broad spectrum of views. Passing over the nega tive reactions of some of the English writ ers in the century after Copernicus, viz., the philosophical lawyer Francis Bacon (1561-1626), the physician Thomas Browne (1605-1682), the clergyman Robert Burton (1577-1640), the poet John Milton (1608-1674). On one hand, we find him assuming at best a minor role in the thinking of the metaphysical poet John Donne (1571-1631), the Protestant con vert from Roman Catholicism, the lawyer Dean of St. Paul's (London). In his Ignatius His Conclave (1610) we see a group of "contemporary" innovators competing for preferment on the right hand of Lucifer's throne. Chief among them are the soldier Jesuit Ignatius of Loyola (1491-1556), the philosopher statesman Niccolo Machiavelli (1469— 1591), and Paracelsus. Copernicus is depicted as one who had moved the J.

All in all, Copernicus did not which had been started about 1530 and invent a new calculation impossible with which was basically a modernization of Ptolemy's techniques; he did not produce Claudius Ptolemy's (2nd century) less difficult calculations; he did not offer Almagest for astronomical acceptability, a more simple or elegant model.

In the post-Reformation period there developed a competing Protestant scholasticism based upon Aristotelian metaphysics. A prophetic skymark was no longer apparent; no central stage was set for man, "the crowning work of God." Man found himself lost in space; God had apparently vanished from creativity. Scholars sought refuge in a bookmark, in an inerrant Bible, with which science had to agree; conflicts of incomprehensive theology with incom plete science were inevitable. To make matters worse, some scientists, such as the unorthodox Kepler, argued with rul ing theologians about theology itself. Copernicanism as a philosophy of science became culturally unacceptable so that even now it is mentioned only once, and then casually, in the ecclesiastical his torian Roland H. Bainton's (1894- ) The Penguin History of Christianity (1967). Meanwhile, Aristotelianism had be come enshrined in the scholasticism of Roman Catholicism by the Dominican philosopher Thomas Aquinas (1225?— 1274). Consequently, Copernicus' anti Arisotelian work was put on the In dex Librorum Prohibitorum in 1616, and not removed until 1835. Galileo's suggestion of placing the book of nature on a par with the book of revela tion also met aggressive opposition. At best, a loyal churchman might consider Copernicanism as a hypothesis (1620). And yet, from a religious standpoint, Durant judiciously concludes, "Recog nizing damages to medieval Christianity, the Copernican revolution was more pro found than the Reformation." Beside negative effects there were positive influences; for example, man's God be came less anthropomorphic, His prov ince less provincial. In conclusion, the Copernican revolu tion, I believe, was truly a typical scientific revolution, as understood by practising scientists today. In addition, however, it has had broad and far reaching humanistic consequences— even in this twentieth century. References Cited Armitage, Angus. 1938. Copernicus. George Allen and Un win, London.
