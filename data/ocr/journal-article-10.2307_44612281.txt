Two car designs were subjected to various frontal impacts - full frontal, car-to-car 60% offset, 50% offset, and 50% offset with deformable barrier - at 56 km/h. Two tests were conducted at 60 km/h against the ECE deformable barrier with 40% overlap. Structural and occupant responses are compared between the various test conditions. INTRODUCTION Passenger cars in the U.S.A. are designed to meet or exceed the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 208 for frontal impacts. To demonstrate compliance to the standard, full frontal (engaging the entire width of the front-end) tests are conducted against a rigid wall barrier at 48 km/h. Another compliance test is conducted at 48 km/h against a rigid barrier face inclined right or left 30° to the direction of motion of the car. These tests represent real-world collisions against rigid obstacles at 48 km/h or identical car-to-car head-on crashes with closing velocities of 96 km/h. Even before the implementation of the FMVSS 208 standard, the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) required full frontal barrier testing at 56 km/h. Though not a regulation, most cars sold in U.S. A in the I990's meet or exceed the occupant protection criteria of FMVSS 208 at 56 km/h, based on published data. The scientific community has not reached accord on the real -world effect of designing cars to the NCAP or the FMVSS 208 test conditions. Some studies show no meaningful correlation between crash dummy responses measured in the NCAP tests and real-world occupant fatality risks in those cars (1), while other studies claim to demonstrate correlation between NCAP test results and occupant fatality risks in those cars (2). Some jof the differences in analyses finding may be because the full-barrier test condition is not common in the real world. Car-to-car impacts account for nearly 73% of all frontal collisions, out of which only 19% approach the full barrier test conditions. About 27% of all frontal crashes are against rigid obstacles, out of which 19% approach the full-barrier test conditions (3). However, the trend of reduced fatality rate over time, per vehicle miles traveled, in the U.S.A. is incontrovertible, and today is the lowest in history, and is lower than in many countries with very high belt wearing rates, showing that cars which happen to be designed to the full-barrier test conditions are performing well in the real world. Alternate test procedures have been investigated in Europe to replace the FMVSS 208 procedure. One such procedure has been pioneered by Daimler-Benz (4,5,6). This test procedure involves a 55 km/h frontal impact against a rigid barrier which overlaps only 40% of a car front- end. Daimler-Benz claims that their cars 1190</page><page sequence="2">designed with this procedure have shown 40% lower head injuries and 29% lower leg injuries when compared to their cars designed just to the FMVSS 208 test procedure. They claim that these reductions in real- world injuries are due to reductions in passenger compartment intrusions. Variations of the Daimler-Benz procedure are currently used by the private ADAC and the Auto- Motor and Sport organizations in Europe, and are published for their customers as consumer information. The effect on the public is much the same as the Government publication of NCAP test results in the U.S.A. A further variation of the above tests is being investigated by the Economic Commission of Europe (ECE) for regulatory purposes. The proposed regulatory test requires deformable barrier impacts with 40% overlap of the front-end of cars at velocities ranging between 56 and 60 km/h. The initial proposal for the deformable barrier face was to adopt the honeycomb face currently used for dynamic side impact testing in the U.S.A. (FMVSS 214). The objective of this paper is to compare the relative severity of various frontal impact tests currently in use in the U.S.A., as well as those proposed for future regulations. The relative severity is measured with respect to interior intrusion deformations of the car bodies and dummy occupant responses. The dummy occupant responses are measured in terms of Head Injury Criterion (HIC), chest acceleration, chest deflection, femur load, and tibia forces and moments. METHODOLOGY Ten crash tests were conducted in the five crash configurations shown below. NCAP • 60% overlap car-to-car • 50% overlap rigid barrier • 50% overlap deformable barrier (FMVSS 214 barrier face) • 40% frontal overlap against a proposed Step-2 ECE regulation barrier Five crash tests were conducted using identical mid-size cars, and five using identical compact size cars. Except for tests with the Step-2 barrier, all crash tests were conducted at 56 km/h. The tests with the ECE Step-2 barrier were conducted at 60 km/h, the upper limit of the proposed European regulation. The car-to-car tests were conducted at 112 km/h closing speed with the target car being a Honda Accord to duplicate the test conditions for car-to-car crashes performed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the U.S.A. The 50% offset barrier test condition was selected to closely match deformation patterns in the 60% overlap car-to-car crashes. The subject cars had belt-restrained driver and passenger highly instrumented Hybrid III adult mid-male dummies. Additionally, the mid-size cars had driver airbags. Dummy instrumentation consisted of triaxial accelerometers in the head, chest and pelvis, a chest displacement potentiometer, 6-channel femur load cells and upper and lower 3 -channel tibia load cells. Post crash measurements of passenger compartment intrusions in the dash* and footwell areas were made. *The vertical wall of the car body between the engine and passenger compartment. TEST RESULTS Dash Intrusions The resulting dash/footwell intrusion profiles at the centerline of the driver dummies are shown in Figures 1 and 2 for the mid-size and the compact cars respectively. It can be seen from Figures 1 and 2 that the maximum dash intrusion is produced in the 50% offset rigid barrier test and the minimum dash intrusion is produced in the NCAP and the offset deformable barrier cases. The dash deformations in the NCAP and the offset deformable barrier cases for the compact car are nearly the same in spite of the higher crash velocity (60 km/h) in the ECE barrier test. The dash deformations in the 60% overlap car-to- car crashes were lower than those in the 50% 1191</page><page sequence="3">offset rigid barrier tests, but higher than in the NCAP or the ECE tests. The dash intrusions in the mid-size car were highest in the rigid-offset test condition, followed by the car-to-car crash test condition. The lowest intrusions in the mid-size car were in the NCAP condition. The FMVSS 214 deformable barrier test and the ECE Step-2 deformable barrier produced intrusions that were lower than those produced by the offset rigid barrier and the car front end. DUMMY RESPONSES Compact Car Tests: The dummy injury criteria regulated by the FMVSS 208 are shown in Figure 3 for the five tests conducted with compact cars. It can be seen that HIC's and chest accelerations are nearly the same in car-to-car, NCAP and the rigid-offset test conditions. The chest deflections are highest in the NCAP test and lowest in the rigid-offset and deformable barrier tests. The highest axial femur load was produced in the rigid-offset test and the lowest in the car-to-car test. It can also be seen from Figure 3 that all dummy responses regulated by the FMVSS 208 were substantially below the acceptable limits (HIC&lt;1000, chest acceleration &lt;60 G's, chest deflection &lt;75 mm, femur loads &lt; 10 kN). In addition to the FMVSS 208 dummy injury criteria discussed above, the ECE Step-2 proposed regulation includes limiting tibia forces and moments. These dummy responses, measured in the compact car tests, are shown in Figures 4 and 5 for the left and the right legs of the driver side dummy. The upper tibia moments in the NCAP test are not available. From Figure 4, it can be seen that the highest moment in the left tibia was produced in the rigid-offset test, followed by the car-to-car test. These moments are proportional to the maximum intrusion. These tibia moments were substantially lower in the deformable barrier tests. The compressive forces in the left tibia were highest in the NCAP and car-to-car tests and substantially lower in the deformable barrier tests. Similar trends are observed in dummy responses for the right leg, as shown in Figure 5. MID-SIZE CAR TESTS The dummy injury criteria regulated by the FMVSS 208, recorded in tests with the mid-size cars, are shown in Figure 6. All injury criteria are below the mandated levels. The comparative results are similar to those observed in the compact car tests. Once again, the ECE Step-2 barrier produced the overall lowest dummy responses in spite of the higher test velocity (60 km/h with the ECE test condition vs. 56 km/h in the other test conditions). The rigid offset barrier produced the highest axial femur load. The upper tibia responses in the tests are shown in Figures 7 and 8 for the left and right legs of the driver-side dummies. The trends are similar to those observed with the compact cars. The highest lower tibia moments were developed in the car-to-car and the rigid-offset test conditions and the lowest in the ECE Step-2 test condition. The lowest compressive force in the tibia was produced in the ECE Step-2 test condition. These tibia forces and moments do not follow the amount of footwell/dash intrusion, showing the complex nature of foot/leg interaction with the footwell area. CONCLUSIONS FROM THE DATA Based on the results of ten crash tests in various frontal modes with cars designed to the U.S.A. requirements of FMVSS 208 and the NCAP, the following conclusions can be drawn. STRUCTURAL RESPONSES In terms of car body interior deformations, the NCAP test against a rigid barrier produces the least dash/footwell intrusion into the passenger compartment. Conversely, the NCAP mean passenger compartment acceleration is the highest of all test modes, leading to the most severe condition for restraint system design. Car body 1192</page><page sequence="4">deformations are most in a 50% offset rigid barrier crash. The 50% offset-deformable barrier produces deformations in the overlap region that are similar to those observed in the NCAP test. The car-to- car 60% offset crash condition resulted in intrusions that were less than those observed in the 50% offset rigid-barrier impact, but more than those in the offset deformable barrier tests. This indicates that real-world car-to-car crashes are less severe than those simulated by the NCAP and rigid barrier offset test, both at 56 km/h, but more severe than those simulated by the existing deformable barriers in terms of body interior deformation. A possible better simulation of the car-to-car test is a rigid barrier offset test at a speed less than 56 km/h. DUMMY RESPONSES For the cars tested, the commonly used occupant survivability responses, such as ШС, chest acceleration and chest deflection, were all lower than those specified in the FMVSS 208 or proposed by ECE in the Step-2 regulation, in spite of the severe deformations observed in the rigid barrier tests or car-to-car tests. Since offset tests are considered by many (4,5,6,7) to better represent real world crash conditions than full barrier tests, the test results in this series indicate that cars performing well in the full barrier tests should also perform well in real-world collisions represented by the offset tests in this series. The highest dummy responses for head and chest were observed in the NCAP, car-to-car 60% offset and 50% rigid barrier offset test conditions. The lowest head and chest responses were produced in the two deformable-offset barrier test conditions. The highest femur responses were observed in the rigid offset test condition. The tibia responses were highest in the rigid-offset and car-to-car test conditions and lowest in the ECE deformable barrier test condition. For both car sizes tested, overall the right tibia responses of the driver dummy are higher than those of the left tibia. In the ECE test conditions, both car sizes show tibia responses that are below those in the proposed regulation (i.e., My &lt; 225 N.m and Fz &lt; 8 kN). The appendix contains a critical review of the 225 N.m. tibia tolerance to bending. The rigid barrier offset crash mode and car-to-car crashes show the highest tibia loadings, suggesting that leg injury potential is higher in these crash modes. Whether these crash modes should be adopted for future regulations should depend on several factors enumerated below. FACTORS TO CONSIDER 1. The rigid offset barrier test condition will lead to stiffer vehicle front-ends, resulting in higher occupant HIC's and chest responses when compared to the current vehicles, even in offset crashes. These increases might result in increased potential for head and chest injuries while reducing the potential for leg injuries. 2. Stiffer vehicle front-ends might increase compatibility issues in car-to-car impacts, especially in car-to-car side and rear impacts. 3. Crash test velocity should be carefully considered. For example, should all crash tests, regardless of vehicle size or type, be conducted at the same speed? If small and large cars are tested at the same speed, vehicle-to-vehicle compatibility will be aggravated further. If light trucks are designed to the same speed and test mode, compatibility between cars and trucks will be further aggravated. Some test provision is needed to improve the compatability between small and larger vehicles in real-world accidents. 4. Is the offset-test condition the only regulatory condition or is it a supplement to the existing FMVSS 208 test condition, such as a replacement for NCAP? 5. Vehicle mass changes required to meet such new regulations will have an adverse effect on other societal needs, like energy conservation. The above five factors can be evaluated by simulating the current crash scenario with 1193</page><page sequence="5">mathematical models and perturbing the models with design changes required by the proposed test conditions.

APPENDIX The proposed 225 N.m tolerance of the tibia in bending is based on data suggested by Mertz (1) as the Injury Assessment Reference Value for the Hybrid III adult mid-male dummy. This suggested tolerance was based on the best data available in 1983 when GM petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to allow the use of the Hybrid HI dummy for FMVSS 208 compliance testing. The proposed 225 N.m value was based on data from Yamada (2) where the mean bending moment to fracture the tibia was only 184 N.m in static tests. Subsequent to GM's petition in 1983, Nyquist et al. (3) conducted dynamic tests on 21 cadaveric specimens. Two specimens failed at 176 and 182 N.m. The rest of the specimens failed above 224 N.m, with the highest moment at failure being 453 N.m. Based on these data, the proposed 225 N.m would correspond to approximately 10% failure rate in the population and therefore may be considered as the threshold of failure. The mean fracture moment in Nyquisťs data is 320 N.m for males and 280 N.m for females. The difference between males and female fracture tolerance levels is consistent with Yamada's data. The 21 specimens in the Nyquist database can be grouped in three levels - the top 33%, the mid 33% and lowest 33%. The average fracture moments of the top-33%, mid-33% and the lowest-33% are approximately 400 N.m, 300 N.m and 200 N.m respectively. Three out of seven of the highest bending moments at fracture (424, 431 and 453 N.m) were from cadavers with masses of (79 to 84 kg), suggesting that body mass could be a factor in the failure strength of the tibia. Certainly the body mass is reacted by the tibia and the ankle during walking. Kang and King (4) have estimated greater than 150 N.m ankle moments during normal walking, showing that an average person's tibia bending strength is much higher than 150 N.m. Likewise, a person with 95 percentile body mass generates close to 190 N.m in normal walking. 1194</page><page sequence="6">Further confounding results in Nyquist's data are noted. For the same cadaver, substantial differences between the right tibia strength and left tibia strength are observed. For example, the two tibias of cadaver #406 failed at 4S3 N.m and 287 N.m, and 176 N.m and 287 N.m for cadaver #353. The test protocol required the removal of the proximal and distal ends of the fibula in the fore- aft (a-p) loading tests. The two lowest building moments at fracture were in the a-p loading tests. The substantial variability within and between cadavers makes it difficult to normalize the fracture strength data. Based on the foregoing discussion of available fracture strength data, the authors believe that the proposed 225 N.m bending moment is too conservative for the mid-male Hybrid III dummy, especially if the biofidelity of dummy design is taken into account. Further research is required to establish failure strength of the tibia. Until such research is completed it is suggested to use the 300 N.m mid-3 3% data to represent the failure moment for the mid-male Hybrid III dummy for compliance testing (compared to 320 N.m average of Nyquist data). Using the same reasoning, the average of the top-33% of the specimens (400 N.m) is suggested for use with the large male Hybrid П1 dummy, and the lowest-33% (200 N.m) be used to represent the failure tolerance when using small female Hybrid III dummy. This assumes that on the average, the taller and heavier portion of the human population have the largest bones and consequently, the highest strength. REFERENCE 1. Mertz, H.
