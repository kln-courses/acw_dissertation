New York: Harper and Row, 1963. xxii -f- 361 pp. $6.95. Reviewed by Gene D. Phil lips, chairman, Department of Educational Foun dations, School of Education, Boston University. THE academic community should be deeply in debted to Kenneth D. Benne, professor of human relations at Boston University, for the editorial work and the compilation of Harold Rugg's critical and original study of the creative imagination. Though Rugg never professed to be a philosopher, he has turned out a work primarily philosophical in nature. He is analyzing a particular condition of change, creative change within the individual. His uniqueness rests with his placing the locus of concern more specifically than has traditionally been ex plicitly admitted by many philosophers. What con stitutes creative change in man, as process and prod uct, as an abiding human question, took Rugg to sources extensive and wondrous. Rugg's scholarly approach was largely Hegelian (i.e., multi-disciplinary?see p. xxii). There was, however, a serious and welcome departure from both the main corpus of philosophy and Hegel. Rugg was thoroughly acquainted with, and ready to rely and to draw on, empirical studies which have reference to his concern. He did not adopt uncritically the mechanistic-materialistic-Newtonian model which had been adopted by many contemporary social and be havioral scientists. In addition to Hegel, there was much of A. N. Whitehead in Rugg, as one might expect if one were to adopt a "multi-disciplinary" approach to creativity and imagination. A fear lingers that he had either not considered Whitehead carefully enough, or he had decided to abandon him for rea sons which he failed to explicate. This review is not the place for a summary of Rugg's findings and/or arguments. They are ex tremely complicated and rely very heavily on a study of the context in which they are written, which itself ranges from the most "strict" of the sciences to the least "strict" of the arts and from the hyper logical thought of modern logical empiricism to the wisdom of the East as revealed in Taoism and Zen. We should not assume that the poles of these con tinua are in any way discontinuous; "... the in quirers were," as Rugg pointed out, "all brothers" (p. 291). What can be done is to take the first sentence of the last paragraph with seriousness, "... At this point, my study is, admittedly, still unfinished. . . ." (p. 314). A direction or directions for further philosophic or scientific inquiry might be indicated. One might be a more nearly careful consideration of Whitehead. Another might be hopes for more nearly dramatic breakthroughs in brain studies. The discussion will continue as it relates to the first con tention for the need of further inquiry. There is some clear evidence that Rugg did not understand Whitehead, this not being the case with the brain studies. Early in the book, he declared that the "creative flash," which was the locus of his study, was akin to Whitehead's prehension (p. xi). This notion certainly would not seem to be confirm ed by Part III of Whitehead's Process and Reality. There is further evidence of Rugg's inadequate un derstanding, or implicit rejection, of Whitehead when he said, "One fact of major importance is known: only man can create" (p. xii). Such metaphysical anthropomorphism needs, if nothing else, more than dogmatic assertion to sup port it. If it were thought that this point were trivial, it would not have been made. However, Rugg found the point was necessary to the progress of his work (p. 96). The point led him to allege a sharp dis tinction between organism and mechanism, creativity and logic (p. 20), a "homing airplane" and a "man trying to find his way home" (p. 99), and the like. The distinction led him to view as a problem, which is a perennial disease of philosophy, the mind-body problem.</page><page sequence="2">62 PHI DELTA KAPPAN October, 1963 On this point, Whitehead had taken the ounce of prevention (Cf. Chapter V, Part III, Process and Reality) and Rugg apparently wanted to. However, Rugg's direct treatment of the problem (pp. 96-133) ranged from a kind of Kantian transcendental unity of apperception to a crass Deweyian naturalism in attempting to deny the problem completely (pp. 129 130 and 240-241), as Whitehead had already done. If Rugg had, like Whitehead, not taken the form of Einstein's flash seriously, but also the content seriously, he might like his contemporary have taken creativity as an ultimate principle of explanation and thereby given his work a much more secure meta physical, and following the lead of W. V. Quine's "Two Dogmas," scientific foundation. It is hoped that students of creativity can look forward to more of the wonderful quality of con sideration that Rugg has given this problem. My criticisms are a test of my admiration; an uncritical admiration is not worth having.1 1 See tribute to Harold Rugg's posthumous work, Imagination, Gene D.
