WERNBERG-M0LLER MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY IN a recent note in Vetus Testamentum, VI (1956), pp. 315 f., I drew attention to the occurrence of the pronoun 7nnNr in Jer 23 33, and I suggested that Jeremiah, in his response to the people, made use of the ancient, long form of the pronoun with which the audience in their turn would be familiar. The purpose of the ensuing article is to demon- strate that the ancient, full forms of pronouns and suffixes were well known to the translators of LXX, who in some passages realized the occurrence of the forms concerned and consequently interpreted the consonantal text in front of them correctly - as opposed to the later copyists responsible for the textus receptus, who failed to recognize these forms and consequently misunderstood and misread the text before them. At I Sam 9 19 the Greek translator rendered ,I,Ij '.iD by 'Eyw, EI/L aivr6s, which de Boer, writing in 1938, excusably described as "a free rendering."' Thanks to the Scrolls we can now see that the translator read lTlI instead of ;lKIl; the two words could easily be confused because of the close similarity of waw and resh in ancient MSS. It is very probable, although it cannot be said with absolute certainty, that MT in its present form is due to textual corruption, and that the original text read ;l1 'lKN 'I am the one (you are asking for),' cf. Klil"' at Isa 41 4, 43 lo, 48 12.2 What we can say with certainty is that the pronoun ;IN1; was in no way striking or unusual to Jews in Egypt of the last pre-Christian centuries. At I Kings 8 oo the Greek translator rendered '.l,Rn, HNIM by attrds c6ds, and it is not impossible that he read the consonantal text as ';HlK 7;RI1 instead of 'iqH;1 Kl1 of MT. At Isa 48 6 MT reads 1l't1n Ki; OM]. The interrogative character of the sentence is kept by many scholars who take it to mean 'Will ye not declare it?'3 or, with the emendation of 1'Tn1 to li'tn 'Will ye not I Research into the Text of 1 Samuel i-xvi, p. 64.

'some- thing which you did not know.' It seems natural to presume that the translator read the consonants as l'Tln l1? ;1Dn?1 instead of 1,'I anl1 12r1n. In fact, his reading makes excellent sense in the context in which a question seems out of place; besides, the verb '"3 in the Hiphil, which the Greek translator rendered freely by eyvwTE, is in Deutero-Isaiah generally used of foretelling future events, an ability which Yahweh alone possesses (cf. 40 21, 41 23, 26, 42 9, 43 9, 12, 44 7, s, 45 19, 21, 46 10, 48 3); the translation 'Will ye not declare it?' mentioned above, appears there- fore, in view of the general usage in Deutero-Isaiah to be incorrect. On the other hand, read as 1V'11n 1 ;rlDnKl the sentence is quite naturally taken as a qualification of the preceding ,S3 '(all this) without your foretelling it,' or '(all this) which you are unable to foretell,' the sub- ject being the idols, cf. the ironical tone in Isa 41 22 f.; such sudden change of subject is characteristic of prophetic oracles and should not be altered. It appears therefore that the Hebrew text at one time contained the pronoun n?lln at Isa 48 6; a scribe, who was acquainted only with the shortened form I1N, drew the final he to what follows, thereby obscuring the true meaning of the passage which was, however, read correctly by the Greek translator as lT1nn '11 nnrl. In I Sam 9 12 the text 'y . RN O3i" '13 M Y_ | CiUD ,'?pD? , l, has been a crux ever since the time of the Masoretes (cf. the use of Paseq after ,1, indicating perhaps that the Masoretes suspected the correct- ness of the text). Why the sudden use of singular in "'3]?? Why the irrelevant application of the verb ;17i,?s The original Hebrew is now easily restored. The consonants ;nlNYl;li1DD ('in front of you [plur.], and now...') were misread by a copyist who was ignorant of the long form Ml=' of the suffix for 2nd masc. plur. and took the waw for a resh (cf. above). As was the case in the passages we have previously con- sidered, so also in this one the Greek translator understood the Hebrew consonantal text correctly, because he, as opposed to Jewish copyists of the sacred texts of a later generation, was acquainted with the ancient, full forms of pronouns and suffixes. So he rendered by IloV KarTa rpooa- W7roi viuQv' vvv aLa 7rjv j1/iepav KEL .... which is a painstakingly 4 Giesebrecht, Duhm, Buhl, Mowinckel. 5 Cf. S. R. Driver, Notes on the ...

The phrase 1i3 rD?n l'7 y b0l'l at Isa 42 25 is rendered in LXX: Kal e7rr1ya-ye e7r' avrovs 6pyr7v v,luov av'rov. It is curious to note that scholars, in dealing with the difficult 13R nn. of MT, have invoked the ancient versions, LXX included, for the emendation to i3R nrifn, without recognizing that the latter in fact supports MT. It appears that the translator was doubtful as to whether he should read the consonantal text as 1Dl nln V ly or as I1KR ;Vi'Iy, and, according to his usual custom in such cases of alternative readings, he incorporated both pos- sibilities in his translation, hence E7r' avrovs op'yrjv Ov,iov avrov - thus once more preserving the original meaning of the Hebrew Vorlage which read the passage as follows: lDb lID;'Y 'lDWi'l 'and he poured out his wrath upon them.' Both MT (by reading 'IDn 11Vy) and LXX (by translating Cr' avrovs) testify to the original text as being ,lD7,l'p; the passage, therefore, contains an interesting example of the suffix ;Dl1 after the preposition PY.7 It may not be impertinent, in this connection, to draw attention to the interesting fact that the Greek translator at Hos 13 15 rendered 11;lf by Cr' avrov, a translation which suggests that, at the time of the translator, the full suffixes were preserved to a more extensive degree than is presupposed in the present MT. In the Scrolls the tendency to retain the full suffix for 3rd pers. masc. sing. is well known; in 1QS, e. g., we find such forms as I1T'l'y (5.5), 1;,'piMl (5.11), lP'7:1n (6.13), cf. in MT forms like l bl (Job 25 3) and 1%',D. (Gen 1 12). At Isa 34 16 MT reads 1]=p l 'I 1lm'l -lT MMr '.3. ".

Orlinsky, in Journal of Jewish Studies, II (1950-51), 151 ff., who discusses our passage in some detail without realizing, however, that MT is re- miniscent of the form nn,5iy. This form of the preposition by + suffix for 3rd pers. masc. plur. occurs a few times in 1QIsaa. 46</page><page sequence="4">WERNBERG-M0LLER: PRONOUNS AND SUFFIXES placing 'his mouth' by 'the Lord' in order to avoid the anthropomorphic expression.8 In other words, at the time of the translator the suffix for 3rd pers. masc. sing. was -ehui rather than -6, and he was therefore able to read the consonantal text at Isa 34 16 correctly - as opposed to later copyists of the Hebrew text who were unfamiliar with the ancient, long form of the suffix, and therefore regarded as the independent pronoun what was really originally intended as the enclitic suffix. In lQIsaa our passage is given as follows: 13:p H1171 1in1rMll Ml KlH 1;1' D 'D; the scribe realized that a suffix for 3rd pers. masc. sing. was needed both after 'D and after nll, and consequently inserted it after both words- without recognizing that the suffix was already there! We have here one of the cases where the text of lQIsaa must definitely be said to be inferior to MT. All the passages we have considered hitherto have been explained ac- cording to the new light which has been thrown on a certain aspect of Hebrew grammar from the Scrolls, and we have seen how, in all cases, our results have found support in LXX. In philologico-historical respects the fact that the Greek translators appear to have been familiar with the stratum of the Hebrew language, with which we are acquainted through the Scrolls, is of considerable interest; it seems to suggest that the latter were written at the time when the Hebrew Bible was in the process of being translated into Greek. We also seem to be brought to the conclusion that at the time in question (i. e. the last pre-Christian centuries) certain unorthodox circles, namely the Samaritans, the Jewish communities in Egypt, and the Judean movement from which the Scrolls originate, kept alive a tradition of pronunciation of classical Hebrew which is different from the one represented by the Tiberian grammarians, and whch only very rarely, if at all, has been preserved in the masoretic consonantal text and in the Tiberian vocalization with which the former was provided in the early Middle Ages. In closing, I wish to draw attention to two more possible occurrences of the suffix ,;7', in the Minor Prophets, namely Zeph 2 12 and Zech 3 8. It is to be noted, however, that in these two cases there is no support for the assumption in any of the ancient versions. On the other hand, the meaning of both passages is considerably clarified if we draw ;11; 8 W. Caspari, in ZAW, N. F. VIII (1931), 75, had already suggested that ,i 'I should be taken as 'his mouth'; he failed, however, to recognize that the Greek trans- lator interpreted the Hebrew consonantal text in precisely this way. 47</page><page sequence="5">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE to the preceding word as a suffix, instead of regarding it, with the MT and all the versions, as the independent pronoun. In Zeph 2 12 the sentence ;lD' '-1M ' 13T ' It. 01 .03' is generally translated: 'Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by my sword,' although the apparent use of the suffix for 1st pers. sing. agrees neither with vs. 11 nor with vs. 13. Besides, the taking of ,?DW as copula cannot be regarded as absolutely satisfactory; it seems that the text, as it stands, means: 'Ye Ethiopians also, they shall be slain. . .' - but in that case, in spite of G. Gerleman,9 is not the change from the second to the third person rather strange? Itwill be readily seen that if the text is read 'DI(): 11)n ..., i. e. 'their sword,' all difficulties disappear and the text becomes per- fectly clear, the suffix referring to the Remnant mentioned towards the end of vs. 9. If this is so, the yodh in front of the suffix is purely ortho- graphical, the letter indicating -e- which seems to have been the com- monly employed connecting vowel in front of all these suffixes at one time in certain Jewish circles. It may be added that according to the interpretation given, Zeph 2 12 contains an allusion to the belief that the pious would be taking an active part in the bloody punishment of the Gentiles at the end of the days. In Zech 3 8 the Greek translator rendered l,DJi nDi1 't1 as &amp;avp?s repaTroK6rTOL teio, which shows that the words were thus divided already at the time of the translator who followed his Vorlage word by word. But why D1I? The Lord addresses Joshua and his fellows, and we should have expected 'ye' instead of 'they' (cf. Peshitta).I? The passage becomes clear if ,D,I1 is taken, not as a separate pronoun, but as a suffix attached to the preceding n1D1. The translation then runs: 'Thou and thy fellows, who sit before thee, (are) their men of omen (i. e. a guarantee for them) that I am bringing my servant Shoot,' the suffix ;1D,l referring either to the skeptic Jewish people of Zechariah's time, or perhaps rather to the community present at the reinstatement 9 Zephanja textkritisch und literarisch untersucht, p. 41. Io Hitzig's suggestion that only the fellows, and not Joshua himself, are nizn ,vtm, because the latter "die Verheissung gegeben wird," is very weak in view of the opening words in which Joshua and his friends are regarded as constituting a group. Equally wrong is Schmidt who, in ZA W, N. F. XIII (1936), 50, n. 1, rejects the parallelism between Zech 3 8 and Isa 8 18; Ezek 12 6, 24 24, on the ground that "die Vorbedeutung liegt also nicht in ihrer Person, sondern sie verfiigen iiber die Vorzeichen." The meaning of Zech 3 8 ff. is given correctly by Mowinckel, in Det Gamle Testamente, III, 746: "(Joshua) and the other priests are by their very existence a sign and a guarantee that... the Davidic kingdom will be re-established by Zerubbabel." 48</page><page sequence="6">WERNBERG-M0LLER: PRONOUNS AND SUFFIXES 49 of Joshua as a high priest described in the immediately preceding section 3 1-7." The reading ,'I,11n1iD '1. , a) rids us of the lnDl as referring to the fellows alone, b) makes it clear that the figure of speech is meant in exactly the same way as in Isa 8 18; Ezek 12 6, 24 24, and c) is philolo- gically paralleled by Di?SiiD in Ezek 12 1 (the suffix being objective genitive). "I The former - and older - view, that the background of the vision Zech 3 1-7 is political, is expressed e. g. by Mitchell, in The International Critical Commentary (p. 151). The latter - and more recent view - which explains the situation against the background of the Babylonian New Year Festival, is expressed by Mowinckel, op. cit., p. 745.</page></plain_text>
