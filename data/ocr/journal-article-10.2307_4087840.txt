<plain_text><page sequence="1">Life of the Tanager.-Alexander F. Skutch. 1989. Illustrated by Dana Gardner.

ISBN 0-8014-2226-4. $36.50.-More than 40 years ago Alexander Skutch moved to what was then a relatively unpopulated region in Costa Rica and, among other ventures, began to observe the daily activities of the avifauna. What followed was a ground-breaking series of "life histories" that have enriched the world's knowledge enormously and placed Skutch among the most prolific and articulate observers of ornithological natural history. Moreover, as a trained botanist with a Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins, Skutch has the tools to interrelate bird and plant ecol- ogy, a skill that he has called upon many times over the years as he observed tanagers. The current volume consolidates Skutch's tanager observations, previously published in more than a dozen books and papers, in the following chapters: (1) The tanager family; (2) Food and foraging; (3) Voice; (4) Daily life; (5) Displays and disputes; (6) Temperament; (7) Courtship and nests; (8) Eggs and incubation; (9) Nestlings and their care; (10) Helpers; (11) Enemies, nesting success, and longevity; and (12) Tanagers and man. Appropriately, some of the long- est and richest chapters are directed at nesting be- havior, for that subject (along with plant-bird inter- relationships) is the greatest strength of Skutch's work. Those familiar with Skutch's oeuvre, however, will find little new herein. Almost all of the data have been published previously although details are added occasionally. Given the abundance of observations that Skutch has given us over the years, the lack of new data is hardly a criticism; the book remains a fertile repository of information, written in a flowing style that continually expresses Skutch's admiration for tanagers. The style of Skutch's writing, especially when it takes an anthropomorphic turn, will trouble some readers, but the much more distressing aspect of the book (which begins with the book's title) is the ex- trapolation of Skutch's observations to the entire tan- ager assemblage. Putting aside the still unanswered question of "What is a tanager?" articulated so well by Storer (1969, Living Bird 8: 127), Skutch makes a number of generalizations about the behaviors of tan- agers even though substantial information is provid- ed for only ca. 30 species that are principally Central American in distribution. The data do not provide a sound basis for generalizing to all or most of the 230-</page><page sequence="2">January 1990] Reviews 229 240 tanager species, and as a consequence unsup- portable statements follow. For example, in previously published writings such as his overview of the tanagers in the "Dictionary of Birds" (Campbell and Lack [Eds.], 1985, Buteo Books), Skutch embraced the traditional belief that tanagers are largely frugivorous. In the "Food and foraging" chapter of "Life of the Tanager," he seems to modify this view with the statement that "Tanagers prefer a mixed diet of fruits and insects, supplemented by nectar in a number of species" (p. 9), but the closing paragraph in the book (p. 107) starts with "Tanagers, like a number of largely or wholly frugivorous birds," which illustrates the persistence of such unsupported generalizations in his writings. An even more troublesome generalization in the chapter on feeding behavior is the concluding sen- tence: "Versatile tanagers are generalists rather than specialists in foraging." This statement ignores pub- lished data, especially the work of Steven Hilty (in Isler and Isler, 1987, The Tanagers, Smithsonian Inst. Press; cited by Skutch). Hilty's and other published data show that sympatric tanager species are often extremely specialized in their insect-foraging behav- ior, even though they feed at the same fruiting trees. Skutch's statement not only indicates the common bias towards observing tanagers at fruiting trees on the forest edge rather then tracking their insect-for- aging behaviors within the forest where they are more difficult to observe, but the statement also reflects the author's dismissal (p. xi) of several hundred uncited and apparently unused publications that contain rele- vant information regarding foraging and other be- haviors of tanagers (see Isler and Isler). As a final example of the limitations of the book's data base, the chapter on "Voice" considers 29 tanager species and implies that vocalizations for remaining species re- main to be discovered, thereby ignoring the record- ings of over 175 species that have been placed into public archives, such as Cornell's Library of Natural Sounds (ibid.). The 24 watercolor paintings by Dana Gardner are inserted in a folio in the middle of the book. Befitting a large (ca. 9" x 12") "coffee table" book, each painting usually contains a single species set in an expansive environment. The colors are good, the habitats ap- propriate to the species portrayed, and the plates al- together pleasant to view. "Life of the Tanager" will have research value pri- marily to libraries and to ornithologists who do not have access to Skutch's previous publications or to those who may wish to have his data organized by subject matter in a single book rather than on a species by species basis. Additionally, the book should appeal to individuals who enjoy richly detailed natural his- tory accounts and bird portraits. But seekers of knowl- edge of tanagers should be warned to restrict their intake to Skutch's direct observations and to beware his generalizations.-MORTON AND PHYLLIS ISLER.</page></plain_text>
