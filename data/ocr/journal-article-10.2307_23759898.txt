( 1993:215) have shown, ol was the Classic period name for god pots as well as the Cholan word meaning "in the center of ' or "heart." However, ol was also the name of the Under world portal that connected the two most important realms of the Maya universe: the natural and the supernatural (Freidel et al. 1993:215). As portrayed in Classic Maya iconography, the Maize God is often depicted in rebirth scenes rising from a crack in the turtle's carapace or from a quadrifoil-opening that has long been recognized as the portal to the Underworld. Thus, sacrificial blood was the substance that opened the portal through which the mundane and the supernatural passed. The quadripartite badge consists of three sacred objects used specifically in bloodletting rituals: a halved spondylus shell, a stingray spine or shark's tooth, and a cross-banded cartouche with an attached/7eur-de-lis motif. In addition to symbolizing the holiness given in sacrifice, the spondylus shell can also represent the primordial sea from which the first création aróse and it can also refer to the watery depths of the Underworld in which the Cosmic Monster resides (Freidel et al. 1993:217). The second object, rising vertically, is a stingray spine that is the primary instrument used to perfórate the skin in bloodletting rites. Finally, the third object, to the right of the stingray spine, is a cross-banded cartouche; a symbol that is commonly worn by wayob' that signais the spiritual trans formation of the ruler to his or her soul companion as a resuit of the bloodletting ritual (Freidel et al. 1993:217). Therefore, the caching of this vessel deep within Structure 3 at Blue Creek, was meant to be seen as a permanent portal through which the natural and the supernatural could pass, while at the A 49 JÜ ■ y • Fig. 2.

The notion of creating sacred space is also reflected in the symbolic layout and layering of the offerings found within this cache vessel. Lining the bottom of this vessel was a bed of white fibrous material that has been identified as kapok from the ceiba tree (ceiba spp.\ David Goldstein, personal communication 1998). This is extraordinary because there are scenes on Maya ceramics that depict the World Tree rising up through the open portal or from the stingray spine located atop the quadripartite badge (see Freidel et al. 1993:218). From these scenes it is clear that the portal is opened by sacrificial offerings. Thus, to the Maya, the World Tree repre sented the central axis of the cosmos (axis mundi) and there fore, denotes the création of sacred space within the enclosure of this cache vessel. Resting atop this fibrous material was a layering of jade and greenstone artifacts, mica fragments, marine shell and coral fragments (including spondylus), fish bones, several stingray spines, and thousands of sponge spicules indicating that the vessel also contained a large number of sponges (Bozarth 1999:11). All of these materials were considered sacred to the Maya and were probably included to reflect the watery surface of the Underworld. In addition, at least some of these objects appear to have been grouped around specific artifacts. For example, two large spondylus shells were placed at opposite ends inside the vessel along the east/west axis, perhaps to mirror the daily path of the sun. Grouped in cardinal directions around the western shell were four rectangular jadeite earflares, whose placement formed a quincunx pattern, which would seem to confirm the création or „centering" of a sacred landscape. This type of pattern has also been noted in many of the caches at Caracol (Chase and Chase 1998:303). This precise pattern is replicated in nearly every aspect of Maya life as a way of recreating the spatial order of the Maya universe. According to Freidel et al. ( 1993:131), it is this spatial order that enables the Maya to focus or summon forth the spiritual power of the supernatural, thus rendering its force accessible to their needs. mexicon • Vol. XXIV • Februar 2002</page><page sequence="3">8 The resuit is a nested series of powerful Symbols repre senting the cosmic cycle of création, death, and rebirth. Présent at varying scales within the vessel's content and arrangement, vessel imagery and presumed foundation rite activities, the architectural metaphors of hearthstone, Witz mountain and cave, and the building' s eastern location within the plaza's sacred space, the layered symbols served to establish and reinforce concepts involved in the cosmic cycle. Concentrated within the discrète, physical locality at Struc ture 3, these symbols and concepts would have provided a powerful locus for ritual activity within the Plaza A complex and for the greater Blue Creek society during the Late Classic period.

RESUMEN: Las excavaciones en la Estructura 3 del sitio maya de Blue Creek, Belize, han permitido identificar varios razgos relacionados con los conceptos maya de creación, renacimiento y centricidad. Los restos arquitectónicos indican la presencia de un altar con bóveda ubicado en la base de las escalinatas del edificio. Debajo del altar se ubicó el entierro de una vasija cubierta que contenía elementos iconográficos que representan a GI y al emblema de la cuatripartición. El tipo y el ordenamiento de los materiales dentro de la vasija sugieren temas sagrados relacionados con el movimiento solar y el mundo de abajo. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: Die Ausgrabungen in Struktur 3 in der klassischen Maya-Stätte Blue Creek in Belize haben eine Reihe von Funden zu Tage gebracht, die mit Maya-Vorstellungen von Weltschöpfung und Wiedergeburt in Verbindung gebracht werden können. Die architektonischen Hinter lassenschaften deuten das Vorhandensein eines überdachten Schreins an, der vor dem Sockel der Treppe zum Tempel stand. Unter dem Schrein befand sich ein Opfergefäß mit Deckel, das mit der Darstellung des Gottes Gl und seinem charakteristischen Kopfputz geschmückt war. Die Form der Opfergaben in dem Gefäß sowie ihre Anordnung suggerieren einen Bezug zum Lauf der Sonne und der Unterwelt.
