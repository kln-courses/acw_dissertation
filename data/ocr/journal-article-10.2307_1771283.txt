<plain_text><page sequence="1">ALLEGORICAL POETICS AND THE EPIC: THE RENAISSANCE TRADITION To PARADISE LOST. By Mindele Anne Treip. Lexington, Kentucky: University of Kentucky Press, 1994. 368 p. In the history of literary criticism, major canonical figures understandably tend to receive the most varied treatment. Thus readings of Shakespeare have ranged from criticizing the bard for espousing the most partisan of doctrines, political or religious, to praising him for displaying the most capacious and catholic sensibil- ity in the Renaissance. Similarly, Melville has been regarded either as the last exponent of Calvinistic orthodoxy or the first nihilist of the New World. Mindele Treip's recent study of Milton's epic may certainly be labeled inclusive. To parody Milton's paraphrase of Pauline Christology, in Treip's treatment of Paradise Lost the poem emerges as a work in which the whole Renaissance tradition of antecedent allegorical poetics "shone/Substantially express'd." The Renaissance tradition, as described in the first half of Treip's book, not only draws together various strands of religious and literary conceptions of alle- gory as both an expressive creation and a method of interpretation, but also</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS / 277 manifestly builds on antecedent theories and practices. The author's survey of Classical, Christian, and Jewish formulations in Part 1 ("Theory of Allegory in Po- etry and Epic from Antiquity to the Renaissance") and her treatment of specifically literary figures in Part 2 ("Theory of the Allegorical Epic from Tasso, Spenser and the Neoclassicals to Milton"), though resting on well-known scholar- ship, has nonetheless the virtue of thorough coverage, including less familiar persons and topics. As Treip presents the matter in Part 1, allegory in its smallest denominator may be traced to the single verbal unit, but historically its conception has always tended to oscillate between the notion of allegory as hidden meaning or idea and allegory as rhetorical figure. This "tension" or "opposition" in the word's recep- tion helps explain the persistent emphasis on its doubling and substitutional function. As exploited by philosophers, theologians, poets, and commentators, allegory can both veil and reveal thought. Thus the fourteenth-century biblicist Coluccio Salutati, revered for the contribution made to the doctrine of the imago dei by his emphasis on humanistic voluntarism, also averred that poetry, like Scrip- ture, "nearly always hides an interior sense" ("Letter to Samminiato," Treip, p. 21). As defined by lexicographers and rhetoricians both ancient and post-modern, allegory can be a trope, a metaphor, a riddle, an enigma, and a pun. "Aligoria," declares Henry Peacham in The Garden of Eloquence, "sheweth one thing in wordes, and another in sence" (Treip, p. 24). This quality of semantic doubleness may be said to characterize allegory, both as a word and as a genre. When considered as a word, a solitary sign, it raises questions such as whether linguistic meaning is intrinsic or extrapolated, and whether polysemia is both latent and manifest. When regarded as a genre, it demonstrates the understanding of how a full-blown literary construct (a dream narrative, an epic poem, an emblematic episode) can develop as an extended metaphor. This line of thinking merges the emphasis of Christian and secular humanism in poetics: just as theologia poetica allegorizes divine or scriptural truths, so theologia platonica figuralizes the Idea pre- existing in the maker's mind. The presiding idea that Tasso's allegorical epic purports to dramatize is the con- cept of "Heroic Virtue," not, however, as excellence already achieved but as "the pragmatic process of [its] acquisition" (pp. 55-56). To analyze this poet's craft in Gerusalemme Liberata and his theory of allegory articulated in the Discorsi del poema eroico, Treip makes illuminative use of Tasso's letters, in which he argues at one point that his own poetic allegory concerns "the science of the soul" (p. 58). In Treip's view, Gerusalemme Liberata is constructed not merely on the fundamental analogy between epic plot and "man's mental and bodily faculties," for which op- erations the poem provides inventive visibilia, namely the leaders and citizens of a body politic and their civic and military exploits. The development of that analogy also turns on the recognition and eventual conquest of certain "inward impedi- ments" (pp. 60-61). In this sense the epic siege of Jerusalem gives substance and shape to bellum intestinum, the condition C. S. Lewis long ago denominated as "the root of all allegory (The Allegory of Love, p. 68), although the pitched battles in Gerusalemme Liberata can hardly be all termed "crude." How much Spenser is indebted to Tasso has been long debated. In her text and an appendix (with an informative table of Tasso-Spenser dates), Treip wants to make the most of Spenser's "Letter to Raleigh" as evidence for a strong influence, especially from Tasso's "Allegory of the Poem," written after half of Gerusalemme Liberata had been completed. Moving considerably beyond Ronald Nash's passing suggestion in the introduction to his 1987 translation of Tasso's poem, Treip ar- gues that TheFaerie Queene's "psychodynamics" (p. 96) owe much to a Renaissance epic allegorizer like Tasso, and that Spenser's detailed self-interpretation of his epic plan and meaning coincides exactly with the Italian's understanding.</page><page sequence="3">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 278 Spenser's depiction of the painful progress toward moral virtue by means of an "historical fiction" and through episodes of contrasting characters and action again bears Tasso's stamp, and both of these poets in turn look directly toward Milton. If the Trinity manuscript reveals how great a distance separates Milton's long epic from his early flirtation with medieval allegorical drama, this does not mean that Paradise Lost should be regarded as a poem of literal realism, however de- fined. Quite to the contrary, Treip's eleven chapters on this epic (comprising pp. 138-256 of the book) ransack Miltonic writings and contextual materials to dem- onstrate that allegory, most generously conceived, persists in this English poet. From initial design to final execution, from the formulation of the poet's "Great Argument" to the dramatization of evil's mystery, from episodic emblems to sus- tained figurations, from the enlistment of figural exegesis to the use of typology and the Reformed Doctrine of Accommodation, Treip seeks to show that Milton makes full use of virtually all known theories and techniques of allegory. How convincing her case is, I suspect, will finally depend on how an individual reader responds to her treatment of particular topics or her readings of particular poetic passages. The contention that Tasso and Spenser exert exemplary influ- ences on Milton's poetics is too familiar to be controversial. Similarly, few readers of Paradise Lost will fail to recognize that Raphael's sly rhetorical question to Adam that initiates angelic disclosure of Creation's process-"what if Earth/Be but the shadow of Heav'n" (5. 574-5)-only thinly veils the poet's audacious allegorization of his own poetic discourse (pp. 192-99). Throughout her discussion, Treip's keen analytic eye for poetic details serves her thesis well in most instances. Commenting on the poetic depiction of Sin's birth from Death-"I fled, and cry'd out Death;/Hell . . . sigh'd/From all her Caves, and back resounded Death"(PL 2. 787-89)-she observes unerringly: "this way of expanding from bare word to fictive depiction to allegorical figure is an intensely Spenserian mode of development, one here and elsewhere imitated by Milton in his ongoing linguistic dialogue with his better teacher" (p. 136). Just as Milton, and before him Du Bartas and Tasso, "validates the abstract centre to his own poem," so even the deity of Paradise Lost is an eager Platonist. At the moment when God catches sight of his own creation, he hastens to expand and embroider Holy Writ: "how good, how faire/Answering his great Idea" (7. 556-57). In Treip's interpretation of the poetic deity's self-exegesis, "he implicitly sees it not only aes- thetically, in its pristine beauty and physical fairness, a masterpiece of design, but also as intellectually meaningful-invested with the hidden, providential signifi- cance for the future race of man which he has built into it" (p. 151). On occasion, however, Treip does not do so well, especially in dealing with theo- logical and scriptural matters. It is not true, for example, that "the New Testament [does not act] through its own characters as further pre-figuration of the Chris- tian hope" (p. 210), for at least twice St. Paul, or the author of the epistles to Timothy, offers himself as a "prototype (hypotypos)" of future believers (1 Tim. 1: 16) and of "sound words" (2 Tim. 1: 13). Indeed, the entire argument in 1 Timo- thy 1: 15-16 places a crucial part of Christian hope-that other believers will receive the gift of eternal life-squarely on the conversion of Paul, "the foremost (pr-otos) of sinners." Such a conception of the self as a type or emblem of salvation history arguably authorizes the later pilgrim-narrator in the Commedia to trope himself as a spark that can ignite a great flare, causing others who are better to attain beatitude ("Poca favilla gran flamma seconda:/forse di retro a me con miglior voci/si pregheri Cirra risponda" [Paradiso 1. 34-36]). Treip's eagerness to dissociate Milton from any taint of literary literalism some- times erodes her precision in the mapping of context. To support the poet's use of materials from the fifteen uncanonical books of the Apocrypha, she cites the An- glican church's Thirty-nine Articles as representative of "Reformation traditions concerning the use of the Apocrypha" (p. 233), thereby overlooking the more</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS / 279 severe verdict of the Puritans' Westminster Confession (1648): "The books com- monly called Apocrypha, not being of divine inspiration, are no part of the Canon of Scripture; and therefore are of no authority in the Church of God, nor to be otherwise approved, or made use of, than other human writings." Milton may well have wanted the apocryphal materials "to enhance the poem's [Paradise Lost] air of real presence," as Treip surmises, "to remove certain parts of his story from liter- alism (since the Apocrypha are well known not to be literally 'true' in the way that the rest of Scripture is true) " (p. 233), but his means are no different from the vast sources he constantly draws on from ancient Greece and Rome. Similarly, she considers Milton's phrase, "heard walking," which she thinks is used to describe the "voice of God" in the judgment scene of the post-lapsarian garden (PL 10. 98), to be "in itself a sufficiently extraordinary phrase." A detail such as this one, she continues, seems "designed to hint at the transcendence of God in His dual nature and inscrutable purposes and to suggest figuratively His abstract or even theological attributes-just as in scriptural 'accommodated' de- scriptions we are aware of a figurative dimension beyond the anthropomorphic" (p. 236). The problem with such a view is that it misconstrues the syntax of both Milton's poetry and its source. Here is Genesis 3: 8 in the Authorized Version: "And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden." Here is the poet's rendering: "the voice of God they heard/Now walking in the Garden." In both lines, "walking" should be parsed as modifying "God" and not "voice." Once this is perceived, the only thing "extraordinary" about this instance of Miltonic verse is how close it manages to stick to Scripture, inversion notwithstanding. ANTHONY C.
