<plain_text><page sequence="1">INVISIBLE HELPERS: ANGELIC INTERVENTION IN POST-REFORMATION ENGLAND Over the past twenty-five years historians have been engaged in a major enterprise of rediscovery. Beneath the surface of an early modern world ruptured by military conflict, political upheaval and religious turmoil they have revealed a parallel universe teem- ing with supernatural forces and magical creatures. Far from being a passive spectator on the workings of his Creation, God continued to intervene in temporal affairs frequently and unpre- dictably, to warn, try, punish and reward. He displayed his pres- cience and power in the guise of miracles, providences and prodigious signs. No less busy were Satan and his band of minions - witches, familiars and demons. Ever eager to wreak havoc on earth, the devil was particularly aggressive and restless in the last days, and was believed to be feverishly gathering his forces for the final apocalyptic battle that would herald the end of civiliza- tion in its current form. Alongside this, unruly spirits such as ghosts and fairies persisted in carrying out all sorts of mischief, to the perpetual irritation and annoyance of human beings.1 1 Only a few examples of this substantial body of literature can be cited here.

But that surprising omission is rapidly being cor- rected by a surge of current research on these celestial beings. It is now clear that they were an integral part of the outlook of indi- viduals from all sections of the religious spectrum. Like their medieval predecessors, Roman Catholics continued to empha- size the multifarious roles of angels: as the ambassadors and mes- sengers of God in the temporal world, as the special patrons and guardians of the faithful, as the Lord's most powerful battalion in the fierce and ongoing war against Lucifer and his accom- plices. Angels were also a constituent feature of Protestant men- talities: densely populating the pages of both the Old and New Testaments, they could hardly be discarded as one of the non- scriptural, 'superstitious' accretions Christianity had gathered during the long centuries of papal corruption. Despite their close connection with the tainted cult of saints, their presence in the Bible protected them from becoming casualties of the iconoclastic purge launched by Luther, Calvin and other reform- ers, though this process did not leave them entirely unscathed. Protestants dismissed some of the more dubious aspects of medi- eval angelology, including the complex hierarchy of ranks forma- lized by pseudo-Dionysius in the first century. Anxious to combat tendencies that smacked of idolatry, they were also at pains to insist that people should neither venerate nor pray directly to angels. Indeed, the logic of the Reformed doctrine of an omnipo- tent providence rendered these heavenly creatures more than a little superfluous: if there was no need for an all-powerful deity to employ inferior instruments and act by proxy, why then did he do so? This testing question did not, however, prevent Protestant writers from stressing the ubiquity of angels and the constancy of their benevolent ministry. The central place they occupied in (n. 1 cant.) and Fairy Stories (Harmondsworth, 200 1 ); Lizanne Henderson and Edward J. Cowan, Scottish Fairy Belief: A History (East Linton, 2001); Peter Marshall, 'Protestants and Fairies in Early-Modern England', in C.

In particular, there was uncertainty about whether or not angels now appeared in visible form. Did they manifest them- selves in ways that were perceptible to human beings? Did they, in short, still allow themselves to be seen? This essay explores re- sponses to this intellectual problem as they evolved in post- Reformation England. By comparing the precepts of formal theology with the realities of lived experience, it highlights a sig- nificant pocket of ideological ambivalence within English Prot- estantism. The story that unravels from a study of the sources, it is argued, requires as much sensitivity to silences as presences. It requires an ear carefully tuned to detect sounds of the complex processes of censorship, selective editing and subconscious re- interpretation that shaped early modern reports of the appear- ance of angels. Close attention to these areas of hermeneutic tension and ambiguity casts fresh light on the character and impact of England's long and contested Reformation. It illumin- ates how Reformed tenets were absorbed and internalized by lay and clerical members of this society, as well as the subtle and organic transformations that took place within Protestant think- ing about the supernatural between the mid sixteenth century and the end of the seventeenth. These transformations were both a product of and a response to various religious and cultural devel- opments, but they also occurred against the backdrop of philo- sophical and scientific changes which were modifying older views 2 See Peter Marshall and Alexandra Walsham (eds.), Angels in the Early Modern World (Cambridge, 2006), esp. editors' intro.

As the German Lutheran pastor Urbanus Rhegius declared in a sermon preached in 1537 and translated into English in 1583, angels 'cannot eyther bee felt, handled, or holden with handes, or seene with carnali eyes'.5 Closely echoed by Henry Bullinger, John Calvin, and many other Reformed writers, this precept was superficially hard to reconcile with the many physical appear- ances of angels recorded in the Hebrew Scriptures: from the angel which prevented Abraham from carrying out the sacrifice of Isaac to those that wrestled with Jacob, fed Hagar and her child in the wilderness, sustained the prophet Elijah on his way to Mount Horeb, and entrusted Gideon with the task of delivering Israel out of the hands of the Midianites. It was equally difficult to square with the content of the Gospels and Epistles, with Gabriel's annunciation to the Virgin Mary that she would bear the son of God, with the hosts of heavenly angels that told the 3 See Stuart Clark, Vanities of the Eye: Vision in Early Modern European Culture (Oxford, 2007).

They did not, however, contradict the tenet of angelic invisibil- ity. Passages in which angels were described in the likeness of old or young men clothed in white garments or in the shape of winged cherubim or seraphim were made by way of concession to human infirmity.7 Where they had assumed bodies, declared Bullinger, these were not their own 'but taken upon them and as it were borrowed from elsewhere for a time and for the weakness of our imbecility and capacity'.8 The palpable forms in which angels were said to have manifested themselves in Scripture were no more than disguises donned to comfort the frightened and reveal the glory of the Almighty. According to Peter Martyr Vermigli, they were merely 'certaine similitudes', 'signes and tokens' of the presence of a merciful but mysterious deity.9 In his treatise on the topic, the Jacobean Protestant convert John Salkeld provided a more detailed explanation of the way in which these (and other) optical illusions were contrived by celes- tial creatures skilled in the manipulation of the forces of nature: by the forming of a body of ayre, so condensing and tempering both the quantitie, qualities, and substance, that it may be apt to receive all manner of colours, formes, and figures, like as in the clouds by the diverse raritie and densitie of them, doe often appeare divers kindes of colours; yea, most strange representations of men and beasts; yea of whole armies one fight- ing against another.10 Like demons, angels were adept 'inventors of virtual worlds'.11 Reformed writers were by no means the first to be troubled by the paradox of an apparition of an invisible creature.

But while the exact nature and status of such visions was difficult to fathom, no one dared deny the axiom that angels had appeared in the biblical and early Christian era. It was widely asserted in Protestant circles, however, that an- gelic apparitions had largely ceased after Christianity had taken firm root. Such spectacles had been necessary to succour the persecuted Israelites, to convert the Jews and Gentiles, and to sow the seeds of the Gospel. As Zacharius Ursinus, author of the Heidelberg catechism, commented: at the first 'gathering and establishing of the Church, the doctrine of God being not as yet plainly delivered, and the prophecies not fulfilled', people had 'needed more extraordinary and miraculous revelations than now'.12 But once the future of the infant faith was secure these props had been gradually removed. In 'ages past', averred the exiled puritan divine Henry Ainsworth in 1607, God had 'em- ployed [angels] outwardly in revealing his will unto men', but in latter times, 'since he hath opened unto us the whole mysterie of his counsel, by his Son', their operations had become more secret and subliminal. Now they were to be 'discerned by faith, not by ey-sight'.13 Other godly ministers like William Perkins and John Rogers were equally emphatic: 'at this day, the Angels appeare not unto us'.14 In his Dcemonologie of 1597 King James VI declared no less definitively that 'since the comming of Christ in the flesh, and establishing of his Church by the Apostles, all miracles, visions, prophecies, &amp; appearances of Angels or good spirites are ceased'.15 The argument that the Lord had stopped feeding his people 'with mylke like babes' and watering them as 'tender plantes' with 'droppes of extraordinarie grace' became a hallmark of Protest- antism in the first half-century after the Reformation. 16 This was 12 Ursinus j Summe of Christian Religion, 317. 13 Henry Ainsworth, The Communion of Sainas: A Treatise of the Fellowship that the Faithful have with God, and his Angels, and One with Another, in this Present Life (Amsterdam, 1607, STC 228), 305-6.

If they could not be explained as the work of greedy and manipulative priests or the delusions of the sick then they were compelling examples of the devil's ability to masquerade as an angel of light. Fervent belief that they were living in the final age of the world preconditioned Protestants to expect that Satan would be particularly assiduous in his efforts to seduce mankind in their own times. An expert magician, scientist and optician, he could all too easily corrupt the unwary by infecting their senses and thereby 'bring them to greater inconveniencies and absurdities in matters of greater moment . . . and so ... to utter perdition'. This explained why 'so many wise women, extasies and rapts of people, who given to too much imagination, thinke verily they see visions of God, Angels, Saints, Divels, or other infinite strange things, according to the humour then predominering in them, which indeede they never saw'.17 Such suggestions drew their potency and urgency from the in- tense anxiety about idolatry that animated Calvinists in particu- lar. The precept that angels no longer appeared to human beings was not unconnected with Reformed Protestantism's profound distrust of the eye as a medium of divine communication and spiritual insight.18 Ministers like George Hakewill regarded this organ as the 'chiefe occasion of originali sinne' and the 'immedi- ate instrument' of 'spirituali fornication'.19 Obsessed by the natural propensity of human beings to venerate visible things, (n. 16 com.)

It was also a by-product of the bitter polemical struggle in which Protestant controversialists were engaged with their Roman Catholic adversaries. It provided them with a devastating weapon against the tales of angelical apparition that percolated through medieval hagiography and the fresh reports of their vis- ible intercession that accompanied the enthusiastic resurgence and promotion of the miraculous by the Counter Reformation Church. In England, as elsewhere in Tridentine Europe, appar- itions of angels were harnessed to express Catholic defiance to- wards the new heretical religion and to celebrate and sanctify the sacrifice made by the community's martyrs.22 Thomas Cranmer expressed his contempt for such 'devilish devices' in 1547, and suggestions that stories of celestial visions were blatant popish fabrications continued to be articulated by Protestant propa- gandists throughout the Tudor and Stuart era.23 It is hardly surprising that Reformed theologians adopted the expedient 20 See, for example, Perkins, Workes, ii, 85; Rogers, Godly &amp; Fruitful Exposition, 538; Rhegius, Homely or Sermon of Good and Evill Angels, fo. 34r.

However, in arguing that the apparition of angels was a thing of the past, Protestants were not saying that the intervention of these heavenly creatures had been called to a halt at the same time. On the contrary, they went to some lengths to stress that their min- istrations to human beings continued in perpetuity. The differ- ence was that their modus operandi had changed. 'Although now a dayes they appear not visibly, nor afford us such outward help', declared Henry Ainsworth, 'yet are these heavenly messengers, stil secretly imployed for the safeguard and benefit of the Saincts'.24 The holy angels 'assigned the guardianship of the human race' always hovered protectively around the faithful, emphasized Calvin and others; it was just that they 'do not deal with us in a way which makes us familiar with their nearness and reveals it to our senses'.25 Rather, they operated silently and imperceptibly behind the scenes. Their watchfulness, warned Perkins and Ainsworth, should 'make us circumspect to all our wayes': 'we ought holily, righteously, &amp; soberly to carry our selves, in al our actions, seing we ar a spectacle to those heavenly Flames'.26 Equally, the self-effacement of post-apostolic angels should not be an excuse for failing to acknowledge their medi- ations, without which, Hugh Latimer had commented in 1552, 'we should all perish both soul and body'.27 Even though, as Bishop Joseph Hall of Exeter was still affirming a century later, there were now no 'ocular witnesses to these happy convoys', Christians should never forget the debt of obligation they owed to these 'invisible helpers'.28 Yet most Protestant writers felt it necessary to insert a caveat. Few were prepared to rule out completely the possibility that angels might still appear to people. This would have been to tie the hands of God, whose ability to intervene arbitrarily and 24 Ainsworth, Communion of Saincts, 309. Calvin: Commentaries, ed. Haroutunian and Pettibone Smith, 147.

Room had to be left for the Lord to act on whim if and when it suited him. The Cambridgeshire puritan Richard Greenham carefully hedged his bets when asked by a parishioner to explain the nature of angelic activity: This is sure, if we be Gods children and walke in his waies, the Angels of God doe watch over us, and yet all see it not, and when they see it, it is by the effect of their ministrie: for though their ministrie be certain: yet the manifestation of it is extraordinary. 'Good angels', he advised another member of his flock, 'have not been seen but extraordinarily3.29 The Swiss pastor Ludwig Lavater was no less cautious in his treatise Of Ghostes and Spirites Walking by Nyght. He ascribed most phenomena of this kind to the counterfeiting of Satan, but had to concede that, al- though benign apparitions of divine origin were an extreme rarity, they did occur occasionally. He was even prepared to admit that, where they had appeared 'unto honest and godly men', some medieval visions of saints might themselves have been authentic instances of the intervention of seraphic beings.30 A passing com- ment in John Deacon and John Walker's Dialogicall Discourses (1601) also hints at the reluctance of most late sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century Protestants to state that angelic appar- itions were wholly extinguished: 'good angels doe sometimes assume to themselves essential bodies ... by the provident power and appointment of God'.31 A tiny sliver of space thus remained within Reformed theology for visual manifestations of these celestial creatures. Nevertheless, the proviso that angels might still appear to the naked eye was essentially a technicality: it was heavily overshadowed by the assertion that early modern Christians should no longer expect to be guided or assisted by heavenly visions. 29 Richard Greenham, Workes, 3rd edn, ed.

Stories of sightings of these heavenly messengers are not only to be found in the ephemeral cheap print of the period. They were also incorporated into anthologies compiled by learned Protest- ant divines like Stephen Batman, Simon Goulart, Thomas Beard and Samuel Clarke, who were intent upon recording the inter- ventions of divine providence for the edification of posterity. Such examples do not, it is true, leap from the page: by comparison with tales of divine punishment and diabolical malice they are sporadic and unusual. Their quality and origin is also variable. Some were imported from Catholic countries on the Continent and edited only imperfectly as they crossed into Protestant terri- tories; others were collected from local and indigenous sources. It is misguided to try to disentangle 'fact' from 'fiction' in these accounts. Neither the doubts about their veracity sometimes ex- pressed by their own reporters and publishers, nor the difficulty of determining whether they were read as literal truths or titillat- ing curiosities, detract from their capacity to yield insight into the nature of contemporary perception. We should resist the temptation to explain them away scientifically or dismiss them as personal or collective delusions for similar reasons. The con- tent of the early modern imagination is a no less legitimate and interesting quarry than whatever we may choose to label 'reality'. Misapprehension and fantasy are themselves culturally con- structed. Nor does it matter that many stories which have sur- vived are several steps removed from the original experiences from which they emerged. The distorting filters of emotion, memory and ideology through which they were sieved are ex- tremely revealing. These tales of angels appearing to human beings can be divided into five categories. The first consists of aerial apparitions of aven- ging angels witnessed by towns, villages, neighbourhoods and smaller groups of people. These featured frequently in early modern accounts of spectral phenomena, alongside clashing armies, bloody suns, cannons, spears and deformed creatures. Linked with moments of military crisis, religious strife and polit- ical conflict, most were interpreted as the precursors of war and</page><page sequence="12">lÃ  as ^ i- Â¿ f '^ Â¿Â¿ r-&gt; 03 â  â¢ s-i' 00 03 'S 5 &gt; o O M 'S ^ 1 o I'Ã sÃ¤ a &gt;, Ã­:*pq 03 CJ ^-N o -t a o &lt; l^ lÃª s^ ^ ln o zl 3 C ^ o â¢S J 03 ~ bo Si C '"- ^ :o bÃ­) ^ 'b/3 '"" 03</page><page sequence="13">INVISIBLE HELPERS 89 signs of divine wrath against sin.32 Thus in Lutheran WÃ¼rttem- berg in 1562 an angel of God appeared warning thousands of onlookers to abstain from godless behaviour or face severe pun- ishment; at Gneissen in Poland in 1571 a winged seraph accom- panied a vision of fighting cavalry; two years later several such messengers were seen near Riga in conjunction with a triple sun, rainbow and images of swords and scourges.33 News of these 'sermons in the sky' reached the British Isles with surprising speed. A pamphlet dated 1 598 described how the four horsemen of the Apocalypse had hovered over various towns in Flanders, together with a sword-wielding angel which wept grievously as a 'sodain token' of the Lord's 'heavy displeasure' against the op- pression of the southern Netherlands by the 'Pharao of Spaine'. This was prefaced by a crude, recycled woodcut from which other images that were anathema to Protestant iconophobes have been hastily removed (see Plate I).34 Good Newes to Christendome (1620) printed a letter from an Italian merchant in Alexandria about an Arabian apparition of an angel surrounded by rays of light and bearing a Bible, which was regarded as a portent of the conquest and mass conversion of the Ottoman Turks (see Plate 2). 35 England's own troubles in the mid seventeenth century engen- dered some no less ominous incidents involving angels. At Aldeburgh in Suffolk in August 1 642, for instance, people were astonished by 'an uncouth noise of war' (beating drums, firing muskets and discharging ordnance) followed by melodious music played on various instruments and bell-ringing as if in triumph of a signal victory.36 Interestingly, the iconographical 'emblem' of the event John Vicars incorporated in his compilation of this and 32 See Alexandra Walsham, 'Sermons in the Sky: Apparitions in Early Modern Europe', History Today, li (Apr. 2001).

In the account written up by the local min- ister, William Radmore, the precise meaning of this strange vision remains shrouded in mystery, but it is clear that eyewitnesses believed they had been visited by celestial creatures.38 In all these cases, angels appeared to give advance warning of catastro- phe and judgement. The second category comprises cases in which angels deliver a sentence against flagrant sinners. A widely circulated ballad entitled Strange News from Westmoreland dating from the second half of the seventeenth century, for example, relates how Gabriel Harding killed his wife after coming home in a drunken stupor and then publicly denied his vicious deed. But the murder and perjury he had committed caught up with him when a stranger knocked at the door: clothed in bright green and with crimson-red cheeks, this was a man of 'such comely grace' that the hearts of those present 'were all a ravished / With the sweet complexion of his face'. Declaring that there was no need to send for a coroner, since he himself would act as both 'Judge and Jury', he confronted the husband with his terrible offences and then summoned the devil to put him to death by breaking his neck. The drama over, the sound of sweet music was heard in the room, soon after which the 'gallant man in green' took his leave. Those who beheld this 'mighty wonder' returned home convinced that an envoy from heaven had been within their midst.39 Here we see an angel in the role of the dispenser of divine justice, disclosing hidden crimes 37 V[icars], Prodigies &amp; Apparitions, 49-56.

In the third genre of stories celestial figures manifest themselves to obscure individuals and entrust them with the task of admon- ishing their wicked communities. JÃ¼rgen Beyer has collected more than two hundred cases of such incidents from Lutheran Germany and Scandinavia, in which seers see visions of angels dressed in white robes or sometimes old men with doves perched on their shoulders. Typically the percipients are encouraged to inform their pastors of impending punishments or to preach re- pentance themselves.40 In 1648 a pious vintner by the name of Hans Keil claimed that an angel had appeared while he was at work, inveighed against swearing, cursing, covetousness and pride, told him to tell the duke of WÃ¼rttemberg that God was aggrieved, and cut six vines with a pruning knife. The blood that flowed from them was a visible token of the catastrophes that Keil was to declare would soon ensue. Keil subsequently confessed to having fabricated the tale, but the character and content of his fake vision closely matched those experienced by other popular prophets who became the subject of contemporary pamphlets and broadsides. An avid consumer of news about won- ders and signs, he had quite consciously modelled it on the case of a gardener who had been greeted by an angel and charged with denouncing the impiety of the German people.41 Incidents of this kind seem to have been rarer in Calvinist England, but those that were recorded exhibit similarities with the Lutheran pattern. In 1 662, for instance, the Yorkshire parson James Wise had a strange encounter with an angel on his way to visit a friend. A vision ap- peared to him several times by the roadside, 'as dazeling to behold, as impossible to express', touched him with a white wand and informed him that he had been chosen to foresee 40 JÃ¼rgen Beyer, 'A LÃ¼beck Prophet in Local and Lutheran Context', in Bob Scribner and Trevor Johnson (eds.), Popular Religion in Germany and Central Europe, 1400-1800 (Basingstoke, 1 996); JÃ¼rgen Beyer, 'On the Transformation of Apparition Stories in Scandinavia and Germany, c. 1350-1 700', Folklore, ex (1999).

The creature gently brushed him with its silver wings before departing, after which he heard a voice commanding him to declare a prophecy about the defeat of the Presbyterian rebels who resisted the restoration of King Charles II, together with earthquakes, plagues and periods of dearth. Published at a juncture of political and ecclesiastical un- certainty and rupture, Wise's revelations were printed 'for the better settlement of many discontented spirits in this King- dom'.42 Sightings of this kind were also connected with radical sectarians in the 1640s and 1650s. The Fifth Monarchist and prophetess Anna Trapnel saw visions of a bright white creature in the course of many millenarian trances that foretold the down- fall of priests, lawyers and landlords, and the Cromwellian regime.43 The angel with which the Boehmenist Samuel Pordage had conversations was literally his mirror image and double, dressed, disconcertingly, in his own clothes.44 The ecstatic spir- ituality of 'enthusiasts' like the Ranters and Muggletonians was especially conducive to encounters with angels, which tested the boundaries between dreams and waking experiences and be- tween the body and soul.45 In the fourth category of occurrences, angels are agents of ben- evolent deliverance. The most famous case of this kind which circulated in Protestant circles was that of the early German re- former Simon Grynaeus, who was saved from arrest by his Catholic enemies in Speyer by the timely intervention of 'a cer- taine grave man of a venerable countenance and habit', who, before vanishing mysteriously, recommended he flee beyond the jurisdiction of the bishop of Vienna. Reported by his compan- ion Philipp Melanchthon, this subsequently entered into the annals of Reformed folklore.46 The persecution to which 42 Two Most Strange Wonders: The One Is a True Relation of an Angel Appearing to Mr James Wise Minister in York-shire . . .

Robert Samuel, a godly minis- ter who was chained to a post in his prison cell by the order of Bishop Edmund Bonner during the reign of Mary I, saw a figure 'clad all in white' standing before him in his sleep telling him that he would neither hunger nor thirst.47 In a similar way, centuries before, a celestial youth had wiped away the sweat shed by the early Christian martyr Theodorus while he was tortured.48 Also enrolled in the pages of John Foxe's Actes and Monuments was the story of Thomas Rede of Lewes, who was stiffened in his determination to stand fast to the truth by ca company of talle younge men in white, very pleasaunt to behold'.49 Incarcerated in Bonner's coalhouse in London, the half-slumbering Cuthbert Simpson heard someone come into his chamber and glimpsed ca brightnes, and lyghte most comfortable and joyfull to his hart'.50 The theme of the consolation and preservation of the innocent can also be discerned in stories in which people are miraculously snatched to safety in the midst of a calamity.51 A boy caught in a blizzard is discovered alive and well three days later having been fed by an unknown man who brought him bread and cheese; a newborn infant in a cradle is carried out of danger after a 'fearefull indundation of waters' in Thuringia by angelic intervention; chil- dren trapped in a house that collapsed during a tempest are found fast asleep or sitting cheerfully on pieces of timber in 'a visible (n. 46 cont.)

Lost in a winter landscape without food or drink, Teate's wife and her suckling child lay down to die, only to find a bottle of milk on the brow of a bank nearby, cno footsteps appearing in the snow of any that should bring it thither'.53 This too was regarded as the work of an angel, though here the creature was not actually seen by the grateful recipients of its merciful aid. The prominence of children in these cases reminds us that it was widely believed that God appointed angels to guard those of tender years. The puritan minister Ralph Josselin attributed the safe deliverance of his daughter Mary after being struck by the hooves of a horse to the fact that God deputed these heavenly creatures cto keep his from hurt', and the same assumption under- pinned Alice Thornton's account of the accidents her offspring had survived in the course of their childhoods.54 Again, though, neither made mention of having actually observed these celestial benefactors in action. One last theme deserves attention under this heading: the evolving idea that angels made strenuous efforts to protect and guide the elect in general and godly ministers in particular. William Perkins cited instances of preachers and pas- tors who had escaped plots and dangers in 'profane and popish places', and the early eighteenth-century Scottish ecclesiastical historian Robert Wodrow recorded that the Presbyterian Samuel Rutherford had been rescued from drowning in a well at the age of four by Â£a bonny young man', who his parents were convinced was an angel.55 In the last group of stories angels assume a medical vocation.

This belief had impec- cable biblical roots: in the Apocrypha the Archangel Raphael re- stores the ageing Tobit to health and in St John's Gospel an angel stirs the miraculous healing waters of the Pool of Bethesda.57 The title page of James Primrose's Popular Errours: or, The Errours of the People in Matter of Physick (1651) enshrines iconographically the notion that they had a particular responsibility to look after the sick, showing an angel holding back an unqualified female practitioner from meddling with a patient and guiding the hand of an educated doctor (see Plate 4) . 58 A news pamphlet about the lifelong cripple Elisabeth Goossens Taets from a village near Utrecht told how she recovered her health in 1 6 1 9 after a brilliant light illuminated her chamber and a young man in a long white robe appeared by her bed and said 'Arise in the name of God'.59 The pattern was replicated later in the century in another Dutch case in which a golden-haired youth came to Jesch Claes of Amsterdam and miraculously imbued her with the strength to stand for the first time in fourteen years.60 Closely akin is the story of 'the good angel of Stamford', an incident dating from 1659 in which a bedridden Lincolnshire shoemaker called Samuel Wallace received an unexpected knock on the door by a stranger, whom he politely invited to come in for a cup of small beer. Perceiving his host was unwell, the visitor proceeded to give him a detailed prescription for a herbal remedy for his consump- tion, which had a wondrous effect when duly prepared and applied. Unseen by his neighbours, the tall, dignified figure had curly white hair and a beard, wore a fashionable hat, purple coat and hose, and had hands as unsullied as snow.

Wrongly hanged for theft in 1605, John Johnson of Antwerp was said to have been preserved from stran- gulation by an angel who placed an invisible stool beneath his feet on the gallows and fed him for the space of five days (see Plate 5).63 This finds a parallel in the case of the servant Anne Green who was unjustly condemned to death for infanticide at Oxford in December 1650. Taken down from the scaffold and carried away for dissection by the university physician, she was discovered to be alive by the surgeons and fully revived. Some accounts of her resurrection mentioned that in the course of her near-death experience she had seen four little boys with wings in ca Garden of Paradice5, who cried 'Woe unto them that decree unrighteous Decrees'. Other writers omitted all reference to the quartet of cherubs and the celestial music she was said to have heard, which were probably fallacious embellishments. Their in- sertion nevertheless attests to the contemporary assumption that such visions were likely to occur in the liminal moments between life and death.64 The Good Angel of Stamford: or, An Extraordinary Cure of an Extraordinary Con- sumption, in a True and Faithful Narrative of Samuel Wallas Recovered, by the Power of God, and Prescription of an Angel (London, 1659).

How are we to interpret this eclectic collection of appar- itions and interventions? How can they be squared with a theo- logical climate that was extremely hostile to the idea that angels still manifested themselves visibly to human beings? One solution is to interpret them as evidence of the defiant survival and stubborn vitality of traditional patterns of piety frowned upon by the Protestant authorities. This derives strength from the striking continuities that can be observed between sixteenth- and seventeenth-century stories of angelic appari- tion and tales that filled the pages of the hagiographical and homiletic literature of the late Middle Ages, such as Jacobus de Voragine's Golden Legend and Caesarius of Heisterbach's Dia- logue on Miracles. Anticipating the deliverance of John Johnson of Antwerp, for instance, one exemplum from Caesarius5 text tells how an angel supports an innocent girl on the gibbet so that the noose does not twist round her neck and refreshes her with 'the wonderful sweet fragrance of his presence'.65 The visual appear- ance of angels also closely resembles that of their medieval fore- bears: dressed in white, bearing powerful wings, and surrounded by haloes, these sublimely beautiful, androgynous creatures high- light the tenacity of a visual stereotype that emerged as early as the fifth century ad.66 The ease with which foreign Catholic reports of angelic apparitions seeped into English discourse might also be seen as a symptom of the resilience of a religious culture upon which Reformed theology left no more than a superficial imprint. There is, on the face of it, much to recommend Bob Scribner's suggestion that such phenomena reveal the limits of the Protestant quest to transform collective mentalities, and demon- strate that often 'official belief could do no more than exercise a 65 Caesarius of Heisterbach, The Dialogue on Miracles, trans.

Angels may have superseded the Virgin Mary and other heavenly patrons in these inherited narra- tives but many residues of their pre-Reformation origins re- mained.68 The same idea underpins Bruce Gordon's persuasive discussion of the way in which angels supplanted departed souls after the Protestant denial of the doctrine of purgatory rendered their return to the world of the living an impossibility. Con- sciously and unconsciously, Swiss reformers 'incorporated as- pects of medieval death culture into their own theological perspective' in a manner that sustained, even as it recast, older assumptions about the role of revenants. The amalgam that re- sulted from the pastoral accommodations made by the clergy was Â£a marriage which was not without its contradictions', and which revealed just how far sixteenth-century Protestants 'still occupied the houses of their fathers'.69 Diarmaid MacCulloch has likewise found a thesis of clever substitution compelling. He has empha- sized how easily angels 'could step into the shoes of the evicted Catholic saints as ideologically appropriate friends of humanity', in a reversal of the earlier 'drift in Christian sensibility' traced by Peter Brown, whereby they were displaced as the cult of the hal- lowed dead emerged and gathered momentum in the late fourth century.70 Some of the cases described above certainly invite this kind of analysis. It should not pass notice, for example, that the topos of the 'hanged man saved' had long been employed to emphasize the intercessory powers of the saints. In medieval miracle tales it was 67 Bob Scribner, 'Introduction', in Scribner and Johnson (eds.), Popular Religion in Germany and Central Europe. 10. 68 Beyer, 'LÃ¼beck Prophet in Local and Lutheran Context'; Beyer, 'On the Transformation of Apparition Stories in Scandinavia and Germany'.

Their replacement by angels in the early modern versions I have dis- cussed is suggestive of how they helped to fill the vacuum left by Protestantism's purge of 'popish3 superstition and idolatry, and of how a favourite story about supernatural intervention was successfully rehabilitated in a Reformed guise.71 Yet while this approach greatly helps to illuminate the ways in which people absorbed the series of disruptive changes brought by the Refor- mation, it may simultaneously carry some conceptual dangers. To interpret angelic apparitions as evidence of a species of dissimu- lation by which ingrained beliefs and practices were reproduced in an ingeniously camouflaged form may be to assume the super- ior vitality of Catholicism as a popular faith.72 It may also be to perpetuate a rather functionalist view of religion as a means of fulfilling social and psychological needs that could not be resolved by the limited technology at the disposal of medieval and early modern communities. Peter Marshall's comments about the potential perils of pursuing the question of what beliefs were for at the expense of what they were like deserve attention here.73 Even as we underline the continuities with medieval piety that may have facilitated the transition to an alien theology, we must be careful to avoid reinforcing the impression that Protestantism achieved little more than a hollow victory. Emphasizing the concessions which Reformed ministers made to the 'weaker brethren' corrects the tendency to stress conflict over co-operation or collaboration as the keynote of relations between the clergy and laity.74 However, it may itself run the risk of perpetuating a negative view of the impact of the Reformation on English society, as well as underestimating the spiritual and psychological need of the clergy themselves for tangible manifestations of the supernatural. 71 Walsham, 'Miracles in Post-Reformation England', 295-9.

There are certainly many episodes in which it is possible to detect the hesitations of Reformed ministers about incidents recounted to them and in which remembered events have patently been reshaped to bring them into conformity with Protestant theology and to suppress their more overtly Catholic elements. One of the reasons why John Foxe declared that 'he stood in no litle doubt whether to report abrode or not' the story of the celestial apparition that comforted the soon-to-be martyred Cuthbert Simpson was his concern that 'the common error of beleving rashe miracles, phantasied visions, dreames, and appar- itions therby may be confirmed'. He anticipated that there were those who would think it 'more expediente . . . were the same to be unsetforth'. Nor was he ignorant that the papistes in their bokes &amp; legends of saincts have their prodigious visions and apparitions of angels, of our Ladi, of Christ, &amp; other saincts: which as I wil not admit to be beleved for true, so will they aske me againe, why should I then more require these to bee credited of them, then theires of us? Not only was there the danger that he could be accused of hyp- ocrisy for including it, but more significantly that it might be misinterpreted by a populace that had yet to be completely weaned from popery and convinced of the truth of the Gospel.75 No less telling is a narrative about the circumstances surround- ing his own conception in 1561 which Sir William Wentworth incorporated into his manuscript autobiography in 1607. This related how during a desperate illness his father had opened his eyes to find ca wellfavoured genti woman of a mydle age in appareil and countenance decenti and verie demure' by his bedside. She took out of her pocket a box of ointment and then, although he initially resisted 'bashfullie', proceeded to put her hand into the bed and apply the salve to his 'privities'. The 'heavenlie spiritt' also told him to travel to St Anne's Well at Buxton and wash himself in it, thanking the Lord for his delivery, and went on to reveal 'some perticuler prosperities of his house and posterity'. Relating to events just two years after the Elizabethan settlement, it looks as if a story that had once borne telling traces of traditional 75 Foxe, Actes and Monuments (1563 edn), 1652.

His father and mother may well have identified the vision as St Anne herself (hence the encouragement to visit her spring); by the early seventeenth century, however, such refer- ences would have seemed decidedly backward and embarrassing to a godly gentleman.76 Memory had been transmuted to fit the contours of a new theological environment. It is possible, though, to interpret at least some episodes of angelic intervention more optimistically: less as an index of the resistance and failure of Protestantism than of its long-term suc- cess in altering popular outlooks. The extent to which Reformed priorities are often interwoven into the very fibre of these narra- tives can be striking. For example, sixteenth- and seventeenth- century apparition stories often have a close affinity with biblical prototypes like those involving Hagar and Tobit. Visual experi- ence was instinctively filtered through the prism of Scripture. No less revealing are the echoes they frequently carry of accounts of the primitive persecutions of the Church, an era the reformers revered as pure and uncorrupted by the dross introduced by the later medieval papacy. Attention may also be directed to those that reflect the awe in which godly preachers were held by the Protestant laity, a trend indicative of the neo-clericalism that grew increasingly pronounced as the Reformation became insti- tutionalized. The visible forms in which angels appear in these episodes do not simply show that people retained in their minds old idols that had been whitewashed from the walls of their churches. They were in keeping with the modified imagery that was developing in a Protestant culture that it is no longer possible to describe as wholly iconophobic. The feathery wings and mys- terious owl-like faces of the hybrid creatures seen by the pious lady and her servant in the incident in Cheshire in 1651, for in- stance, conform with a picture of Ezekiel's vision of four cheru- bim which was incorporated in that bibliographical badge of ardent Calvinists, the Geneva Bible.

Furthermore, the corpus of colourful examples discussed ear- lier should not be allowed to eclipse those cases of supernatural intercession from which corporeal or anthropomorphic manifest- ations of angels are conspicuous by their absence. They must be set alongside an even larger number of stories in which these creatures did not make their presence known to human beings through the untrustworthy medium of sight. Some involve the sense of hearing and touch instead: mysterious blows or pricks to the skin or, as in the episode at Aldeburgh in 1642, melodious sounds or disembodied voices. But many of the examples which Batman, Goulart, Clarke and others collected bore out the theo- logians' precept that angels were for the most part known only cby the effect of their ministrie'.78 In the anecdotes of angelic inter- vention from Huntingdonshire and Cambridgeshire that Beard incorporated in his Theatre of Gods Judgements, they remain stu- diously veiled from view when a woman and child escape being crushed to death by a steeple which falls on their cottage and when lightning strikes the oak tree under which a man shelters during a storm.79 The ministering spirits which assist Reverend Teate's family in Ireland do not leave so much as the faintest im- pression of their presence in the snow. Nor is there any reference to an apparition in the story of John Trelille, the Cornish cripple cured by washing in St Madron's well 'upon three monitions in his dream', an incident personally investigated by Bishop Joseph Hall in the 1 640s and found to involve 'neither art nor collusion, the thing done, the Author invisible'.

They were indeed 'invisible guardians' and 'helpers'. How far their reticence in these episodes was itself the result of clerical repression and erasure remains unclear, but it would be wrong to rule out the possibility that it attests to the internalization of Protestant ideology by ordinary laypeople, and to the ways in which over time the Reformation altered modes of mental and visual perception. It modified the cultural lens through which they viewed their world, correcting some distor- tions but simultaneously creating a new set of blind spots. Ultimately it is vital to stress that angelic intervention was en- tirely compatible with Reformed providentialism, and to empha- size once more the escape clause which the theologians built into their theory that visible apparitions of angels had ceased more than a millennium before. When confronted by the messy realities of belief as it manifested itself outside their textbooks, Protestants were obliged to carve out a place for the possibility that instances of the appearance of these celestial creatures that came to their ears might just be phenomena that did indeed come from God. The trouble was it was equally, indeed even more, probable that they were of satanic origin. And it is to the uncertain status of visions and the frictions and tensions they engendered in post- Reformation society that we must turn in the next section. IV One of the most important lessons to have emerged from Stuart Clark's pioneering work on the 'Reformation of the eyes' and the 'de-rationalisation of vision' in sixteenth- and seventeenth- century Europe is the insight that Protestants were not sceptical (n. 80 com.) peripatetico (Antwerp, 1652), 68-9, predictably places more emphasis on the fact that the place was sacred to St Madern (Madron) . Wodrow, Analecta, [ed. Leishman], i, 57.</page><page sequence="33">INVISIBLE HELPERS 1 09 about the reality of apparitions per se; rather they were deeply suspicious of what exactly they were seeing and experiencing. The difficulty of distinguishing between divine and diabolical illusions and separating out those that were simply the side effects of dis- ease and illness was acute. This was a context in which the bound- aries between nature and supernature were both porous and fluid as a consequence of increasingly sophisticated philosophical and empirical scrutiny. A clear trend is nevertheless evident: 'Protestants continued to pay lip service to the possibility that apparitions might be of good angels but, in effect, they had nar- rowed spectral visual phenomena almost entirely to the realm of the demonic'.82 The 'discernment of spirits' was a problem that had long troubled medieval churchmen. Vincent of Beauvais (d. 1264) had addressed the question in the thirteenth century; in the fif- teenth, as Nancy Caciola, Dyan Elliott, Moshe Sluhovsky and others have shown, apprehension about the source of revelations vouchsafed to the laity reached a peak of intensity against the backdrop of the Great Schism and Babylonian Captivity of the papacy, and the rise of mystical spiritualities. Pierre d'Ailly, Henry of Langstein and Jean Gerson all concerned themselves with providing guidance about how to differentiate divine from demonic possession and angelic communication from satanic de- lusion. Gerson wrote several treatises on the subject, the most famous of which, On the Proving of Spirits , was composed to chal- lenge the recent canonization of St Bridget of Sweden and pre- sented to the fathers of the Council of Constance in 1415. 83 The Tridentine Church was, if anything, more preoccupied with the issue, and cases of aspiring saints who claimed to have been privileged with apparitions of angels litter the records of the Venetian, Roman and Spanish Inquisitions. Jeanne des Anges, superior of the Ursuline convent at Loudon in the 1630s, for instance, had regular interaction with a guardian angel who pro- vided her with intimate advice on matters of faith.84 In Italy 82 Stuart Clark, 'The Reformation of the Eyes: Apparitions and Optics in Sixteenth- and Seventeenth-Century Europe', Jl Religious Hist.,xxvii (2003), 155; and see Clark, Vanities of the Eye, esp. ch. 6.

In Spain many similar self-professed beatas came under investigation in the course of the sixteenth and seventeenth cen- turies, and the ecstasies of English nuns in religious houses in the Low Countries likewise attracted the suspicion of their male con- fessors.85 Only occasionally were the visions seen by such women accepted as heavenly emanations; far more frequently they were attributed to human weakness or artifice or the malice of the devil. Their raptures were dismissed as feigned and they themselves denounced as spiritual impostors acting with or without the col- lusion of Lucifer. The line between those who were the unwitting victims of his wiles and those who acted in conscious alliance with him as witches was very fine indeed. The intertwined strands of misogyny and resentment of lay pretension apparent in much of the discourse surrounding these Catholic visionaries find a close echo within the Protestant camp. To assert that one had been selected as the recipient of an angelic apparition and as an emissary of divine messages was to offer a tacit challenge to clerical authority. The claim to have had direct communication with supernatural beings gave individuals a spiritual charisma that conflicted with a settled ecclesiastical and social hierarchy in which the laity owed deference to minis- ters, women to men, servants to masters, and children to their parents.

It facilitated what Henry Mayr-Harting, writing of the Middle Ages, has called 'the speaking of invidious truths'.86 Contact with angels gave a divine imprimatur to the utterances of those who normally had no right to comment on the manner in which they were governed. Implicitly, it also represented a threat to the all-sufficiency of Scripture. This explains why Protestant theologians typically in- sisted that the doctrinal ministry of angels was not, 'ordinarily, now to be expected'. As the late seventeenth-century Leicester- shire rector Benjamin Camfield avowed, 'God hath now thought good to substitute other Legats for the publishing of his Mind and Will to Men'. The Bible showed that it was not the place of celestial creatures 'to usurp the Ministerial Office in the Church of Christ, but to preserve and countenance it in the hands of such, as our Lord and Saviour hath appointed thereunto'. They had no 'Sacred Mission or Function' to take upon themselves the solemn tasks of preaching and teaching, declared the Independent min- ister Christopher Ness.87 The tendency of writers like William Perkins to compare angels with ministers (and conflate prophets with preachers) emanated from the same desire to monopolize the sources of extraordinary spiritual guidance in the hands of the designated representatives of the institutional Church.88 Since angels only occasionally revealed new doctrine to the living, any- thing unorthodox which came from their mouths (or those of their human deputies) was a clear indicator that they were not God's ambassadors but cleverly disguised envoys of the devil. It follows that angelic apparitions were most credible when they were experienced by the clergy themselves or where the message they conveyed to the laity accorded with official theological and moral priorities. When they broke out of the mould of conserva- tive exhortations against personal sins and ventured into the region of politics or controversial tenets of dogma, they were likely to be dismissed as deceptive impressions created by Satan to bring the souls of the unwary to eternal destruction. Perkins made this plain in the section on judging the marks of true and 86 Henry Mayr-Harting, Perceptions of Angels in History (Oxford, 1998), 8.

As well as ruling out those who were 'rash', 'inconstant', 'babling', or affected by 'some disease which hin- dereth the reasonable part' like 'phrensie', he peremptorily rejected all revelations which contradicted the word of God, maintained heresies, or promoted 'disquietnesse in the Church and Common-wealth'.89 This selective scepticism can be seen at work in particular ex- amples. Lord Burghley was unimpressed by the pretensions of a certain Miles Fry, who wrote to him in June 1 587, calling himself Emmanuel Plantagenet and claiming to be the son of God and Queen Elizabeth I. He said that he had been taken from her at birth by the Archangel Gabriel, whom he now exceeded in au- thority. His request to present to the monarch an 'embassage' from his Father in heaven was evidently declined, despite Fry's accompanying threat of providential punishment if he was turned away from court. Burghley scribbled on the letter that its author 'semes to be distempred in his wytts', and filed it with a collection of other correspondence from pious lunatics.90 The notorious pseudo-messiah William Hacket and his accomplices Arthington and Coppinger likewise believed themselves to be imbued with angelic spirits, but their claims to divine inspiration were given short shrift by the Elizabethan regime, which executed Hacket for treason and denounced the threesome as agents of Satan; in this case a verdict of insanity was deliberately avoided for political reasons.91 The case of Elizabeth Freeman, a 31 -year-old spinster from Bishops Hatfield in Hertfordshire, who alleged she had seen repeated visions of a woman in white in January 1681, is also revealing. In the midst of the Exclusion Crisis, her insistence that the spirit had disclosed details of a plot to poison Charles II could hardly be ignored and she was initially taken seriously by the authorities. The king himself questioned her at some length before dismissing her, satisfied that she was merely a harmless female crank with a colourful imagination. Christopher Ness, however, thought the apparition was a providential sign of the times, though on balance he inclined to the view that Freeman's 89 William Perkins, A Fruitfull Dialogue Concerning the End of the World^mhis Workes, iii, 468.

Reiterating the precept that the ministry of angels to mankind was now invisible, he commented that Satan often chose the weaker sex ('whose credulity is sooner imposed upon, and easilyer abused') to be the vassals of his dastardly plan to subvert the world.92 By contrast the 'strange predictions' made by a man from Catterick who saw a terrifying sword-wielding vision in 1648 were suspected by one learned gentleman whose amused letter on the subject was printed as a satire on Cavalier culture to have sprung from an 'excesse of liquor'. The percipient (whose 'veines [were] as full of wine, as his brain was empty of wit') was one of 'a consort of Good-fellows' who had engaged in an alco- holic binge. He anticipated that his experience would be put down to his inebriated condition ('the distempers of an unsettled braine'), but he nevertheless described it in detail, convinced that this was a supernatural visitation to admonish both him and the town to mend their ways. Another witness might well have attrib- uted the event to the devil, which the dissolute party probably invoked as they drank their impious healths.93 Moreover, clerical opinion was itself often divided on how to interpret such occurrences, as revealed by a strange incident near Launceston in Cornwall dating from around 1600. When a 'walking spirit' donned in a smock frightened his serving maids the master of the household Sir Thomas Wise initially put this down to 'some distemper or vaine fancy of a womanish feare'. But after it appeared in his own chamber the following night and stood at the end of the bed for half an hour he too was terrified. He consulted the local archdeacon, who concluded that the spectre was an 'angelicali apparition' rather than 'a diabolicall illusion' on the grounds that it wore a white and shining raiment and had inflicted no harm. However, when Wise later recounted the 92 Calendar of State Papers, Domestic, September 1, 1680 to December 31, 1681, 151; Richard Wilkinson, Strange News from Bishop-Hatfield in Hertford-shire, January the 25, 1680 (London, 1681); A True and Perfect Relation of Elizabeth Freeman of Bishops- Hatfield in the County of Hertford of a Strange and Wonderful Apparition which Appeared to Her Several Times, and Commanded Her to Declare a Message to his Most Sacred Majesty, January 27, 1680 (London, 1680); N[ess], Signs of the Times, 59-74, quotation at p. 73. 93 Strange Predictions Related at Catericke in the North of England: By One who Saw a Vision, and Told It Himself to the Company with whom He Was Drinking Healths; How He Was Struck, and an Angel Appeared to Him with a Sword (London, 1648), 1-2 and passim.

In any case it was 'a thing unheard of for an angel to appear in the 'perfect likeness' of a woman. Featley encouraged him to examine his conscience, give thanks for his deliverance, and 'sinne no more lest a worse thing befell him'.94 In other circumstances, or in the hands of a hostile reporter, the elder Wentworth's encounter with the heal- ing angel who touched his genitals might likewise have been interpreted as evidence of the devil's determination to inflame sexual temptation.95 Several German examples which found their way into providential anthologies also highlight the ambigu- ity that surrounded such sightings. Neighbours and friends of a poor woman visited by a personage in white that carried her to strange places, and charged her with preaching vengeance to the sinful populace, interrogated her closely about its identity: was it a benevolent emissary from heaven or was it Lucifer pretending to be an angel of light? On this occasion, the former interpretation prevailed, in large part because the pastor of her village testified to her 'singular piety and humble devotion', 'adding that she was wel instructed, and could yeeld very good reason for her religion'.96 On others, where the seer lacked unimpeachable godly creden- tials, a diabolical or medical explanation was more likely to tri- umph. When an angel appeared three times to a woman living near DÃ¼rrmenz in WÃ¼rttemberg, for instance, it was decided that she was either a dupe of Satan or suffering from some form of mental disease.97 Sometimes the process of sifting and interpret- ing visual experiences went on inside the percipient's own mind.

Troubled long afterwards by the strange ap- parition, like many early modern Protestants, he could not be certain that his eyes were not deceiving him.98 The difficulties connected with the discernment of spirits in Protestant England are also illuminated by reference to some of the many episodes of alleged demonic possession reported in the post-Reformation period. Noticing the paradox of possessions which produced 'revival sermons and angelic visions' alongside blasphemous utterances, Erik Midelfort has highlighted the 'in- dependent wilfulness and indocility of popular culture at certain points'." David Harley has carried these insights further, empha- sizing how frequently the diagnosis of invasion by demons repre- sented a defeat for rival interpretations preferred by the afflicted. It counteracted claims that their bizarre behaviour was the result of the evil machinations of witches or, alternatively, derived from divine inspiration. Spiritual charisma was displaced by stigma in a strategy that disempowered the victims and undercut their con- viction that they were the conduits of supernatural grace. 1 00 In his Guide to Grand-Jury Men (1629), Richard Bernard went on to dismiss the possibility that angels and demons could coexist within a single person, adding that only the latter used the tricks of a sly ventriloquist.101 Patients and spectators struggled to wrest control of the meaning of the puzzling and contradictory symptoms of the possessed. Faint but telling traces of these conflicting readings can be de- tected in various incidents. During his terrible fits in 1596, the godly demoniac Thomas Darling, for example, shouted, 'Looke where greene Angels stand in the window', and he also saw one as a milky- white dove sent to comfort him. 102 Almost a century later 98 Wodrow, Analecta [ed.

The tug of war between different outcomes is even more explicit in the case of Helen Fairfax, daughter of a pious Yorkshire gentleman, who experienced a series of strange visions in 1621: ca man of incomparable beauty' attired in shining white apparel from which streamed glorious beams of light appeared to her. She challenged it to depart from her if it were an evil spirit, but when it said that it had come to comfort her she was con- vinced.

This confusing and fragmentary narra- tive has many layers, but one prominent thread is the touching relationship the young girl developed with two apparitions she believed to be angels. These were 'bodyed like Birds, as big as Turkies' and had 'faces like Christians, but the sweetest creatures that ever eyes beheld'; at other times they assumed the likeness of a partridge and dove. Her experiences began with a trance in which she saw 'a happy sight, and heard a blessed sound', a 'Heavenly Rapture' which convinced Mr Huet, the local minister, that she had been specially selected by God.

She oscillated between desperate spasms and moments of lucidity in which she recited psalms and spoke pro- foundly. The battle between good and evil inside her intensified, and to her immense distress her angels, prevented from coming to her by a wicked spirit, departed for the space of twelve weeks. Gradually her sickness took on more typical demoniacal symptoms, culminating in accusations of witchcraft against three women, one of whom, a widow called Dorothy Swinow, was con- victed in April 1 650. 105 The way in which Margaret Muschamp's good possession was diabolized reveals with unusual clarity the multiple tensions which shaped the construction of such narra- tives. In most cases, we see only the much tidier end-product of the prolonged tussles between and within lay and clerical minds that surrounded angelic visions - tussles in which Protestant anxiety about the devil's hyperactivity in the last days often over- whelmed the small glimmer of hope that they might indeed be benevolent creatures sent to guide and instruct them. The assimilation of Margaret Muschamp's encounter with angels into a demonic framework may be compared with the in- sidious processes which transformed fairies into satanic familiars. English and Scottish witch trials yield evidence of struggles over the significance of experiences which the defendants believed involved meetings with these capricious and morally ambivalent spirits.106 Just as the physical forms in which both fairies and familiars manifested themselves to human beings frequently con- verge, so too do they overlap with the guises in which angels are reported to have appeared in this period. The colour of the clothes these celestial creatures usually wear, green, was inextricably linked with the fairy in folk tradition. These points of contact are further cemented by the case of Ann Jeffries, a 19-year-old 105 Mary Moore, Wonderfull News from the North: or, A True Relation of the Sad and Grievous Torments, Inflicted upon the Bodies of Three Children of Mr. G.

Forsaking food for six months, she claimed to have been fed by these sprites with ethereal bread and was credited with perform- ing marvellous cures with various salves and medicines she had received from them.107 The similarities between this case and several of the stories of angelic intervention investigated here raise the intriguing possibility that some of the latter attest to popular belief in a class of spirits which Protestantism sought to eradicate as a 'popish5 and 'pagan' hangover, but with which it continued to coexist eclectically.108 Confronted by such experi- ences in the course of their pastoral ministry, many churchmen instinctively dismissed them as hallucinations or delusions of the devil, but at least some suspected that they might be emissaries from heaven rather than hell.109 Distinguishing angels from ghosts was no less tricky. Reformed repudiation of the notion that the souls of the dead could return to haunt and instruct the living was accompanied by a concerted campaign to redefine continued sightings of departed relatives as diabolical illusions.110 But uncertainty about the status of such spectres remained in some cases, not least because of their visual similarities with traditional pictorial stereotypes of celestial messengers.

Bewildered but bold, she bade it identify itself, upon which it confessed that it was the spirit of a murdered man called Robert Elliot intent upon bringing to book the trio of witches who had contrived to kill him. It claimed to have wandered the nether regions of the earth for the space of fourteen years, to live off 'the fruite of the aire', and to be governed in all its movements by the Lord. Later it told of a popish conspiracy against the king, which it said could be found written upon 'the backside of a pack [of] plaine [ playing] Cards', and asked for prayers to be said for it in the local church.111 Reflecting a significant retreat from the high-water mark of early Protestant insistence that ghosts did not exist, the episode highlights how hazy the metaphysical dis- tinction between angels and departed souls could be, and in- creasingly became as the early modern period progressed.112 As post-Reformation society found ways of absorbing ghosts into an ideological framework from which the doctrine of purgatory had been successfully evacuated, the potential for confusing the various categories of ethereal spirits by which the Protestant world was inhabited surely intensified. The foregoing observations both help to account for the rela- tive scarcity of apparitions of angels in sixteenth- and seven- teenth-century English culture, and suggest that their relatively rare intrusions into the historical record should be read as mo- ments in which a more upbeat assessment managed to displace an ingrained reluctance, a reluctance that was not just theological in origin but also, in the broadest sense of the word, political. Events that were more commonly viewed through the spectacles of witchcraft and diabolism were instead seen as visible instances of angelic intercession. Often we simply do not know the circum- stances in which the impulse to censor and reinterpret such episodes was overcome by a particular conjunction of social, cultural and ecclesiastical factors.

V One final feature of early modern stories of angelic apparition deserves discussion in this essay: their chronological distribution and patterning. It cannot escape notice that contemporary recep- tivity to the visible intervention of celestial spirits appears to in- crease the further we advance into the seventeenth century. The years between 1 640 and 1 700 were permeated by growing unease about the rising tide of 'Sadduceeism', scepticism and 'atheism' that seemed to be sweeping English society. Whether imagined or real, the threat presented by Hobbesian materialism, mechanical philosophy and articulated doubt about the existence of an invis- ible spirit world prompted a renewed determination to defend traditional Protestant assumptions about the supernatural within Christian ranks.114 Close to the heart of this enterprise was vociferous rejection of any suggestion that angels (both good and evil) were merely metaphors and thus had no physical reality. This had long been an undercurrent in theological discus- sions of the subject: Calvin, Bullinger, Ursinus and Perkins had all made a point of criticizing the opinions of the ancient Sadducees who dismissed angels as mere 'qualities', 'cogitations' or mental 'inspirations'.115 But the theme became increasingly strident in the later Stuart period. The perception that belief in 113 Vermigli, Common Places, 22. For the prehistory of this anxiety, see Michael Hunter, 'The Problem of "Atheism" in Early Modern England', Trans. Roy. Hist.

One prominent exponent of the view that the spirits spoken of in the Bible were merely metaphors and had no corporeal reality was Reginald Scot, whose 'Discourse upon Divels and Spirits' appended to his Discoverie of Witch- craft provoked many refutations. For divergent readings of the influences on Scot, see Sydney Anglo, 'Reginald Scot's Discoverie of Witchcraft: Scepticism and Saddu- ceeism', in Sydney Anglo (ed.), The Damned Art: Essays in the Literature of Witchcraft (London, 1977); David Wootton, 'Reginald Scot / Abraham Fleming / The Family of Love', in Stuart Clark (ed.), Languages of Witchcraft: Narrative, Ideology and Meaning (cont. on p. 121)</page><page sequence="45">INVISIBLE HELPERS 1 2 1 the presence and agency of angels (and indeed demons) was being widely questioned served to focus fresh Protestant attention on this class of otherworldly creatures. In this context, it is possible to discern a subtle but distinct change of tone in clerical discourse about both the tendency of angels to appear to human beings in corporeal forms, and the frequency with which they did so in the post-apostolic era. The Civil War and Interregnum coincided with a stream of new treatises about angels and their interactions with human beings. Some of these echoed sixteenth-century Reformed common- places. In Of our Communion and Warre with Angels (1646), the puritan exile Henry Lawrence reiterated the claim that early modern Christians should not expect to see apparitions of these celestial messengers in their own age: 'as God would be wor- shipped in spirit and truth, so ... hee would have us converse with the spirit, and these spirits, in a more invisible way . . .'. This did not mean that they were now absent or idle: 'Their ministery ceaseth not though the way of their administration be chan- ged'. x 16 In The Deputation of Angels (1654), the Isle of Wight cler- gyman Robert Dingley restated the orthodoxy that angels no longer appeared to mankind because under the Gospel 'the Church needeth not now those visible and sensible confirm- ations' upon which it had relied in its infancy.117 The precept that angelic apparition had been terminated was also echoed by John Gumbleden, chaplain to the earl of Leicester, in a sermon preached at Oxford which appeared in print three years later, and by the Presbyterian divine Isaac Ambrose in his Ministration of and Communion with, Angels (1661): in the days of Christ angels had revealed mysteries and taught hidden truths ('sometimes by dreams in the night, and sometimes by conference in the day'), but in modern times they chose to 'admonish our minds, and, in a secret unperceivable way'.118 (n. 115 com.) in Early Modern Culture (Basingstoke, 2001).

Published the year after Thomas Hobbes's Leviathan reinterpreted key scriptural passages describing angels and demons in allegorical terms and reduced apparitions themselves to merely optical phenomena,119 its aim was to delineate the workings of the unseen universe to counter the errors of a new breed of Sadducees. In addressing the ques- tion of whether or not angels manifested themselves in bodily form, Hall adhered to the view that the Elder the Church grew, the more rare was the use of these apparitions, as of other miraculous actions and events: not that the arme of our God is shortned, or his care and love to his beloved ones, any whit abated: but for that his Church is now in this long processe of time settled, through his gracious providence, in an ordinary way . . . Now then in these latter ages of the Church, to have the visible apparition of a good Angeli, it is a thing so geason [scarce] and uncouth, that it is enough for all the world to wonder at. Yet, while stressing that 'the trade we have with good spirits is not now driven by the eye', Hall was nevertheless anxious to under- line the infinite occasions on which believers experienced their cunfelt hands' in the course of their lives, and to advise taking 'the mid-way betwixt distrust, and credulity' in the case of medieval accounts of angelic visions. 120 Hall's personal investigation of the cure of the Cornish cripple John Trelille hints at the more pro- active and empirical approach to proving the existence of the spiritual realm that was beginning to emerge in both clerical and scholarly circles in response to the alleged irreligious tenden- cies of these decades. In this regard the Cambridge Platonist Henry More's Antidote against AthÃ©isme (1653) was a further straw in the wind: employ- ing the language and techniques of the naturalist, he examined the history of the supernatural to prove to unbelievers that there was indeed a God and an immortal soul. Even as he conceded that celestial messengers now only seldom appeared, he dedicated the third book of his work to descriptions of these and other occult (n. 118 com.) (1674 edn), 136.

This is apparent in a French treatise on the subject annexed to Thomas Bromhall's History of Apparitions (1658). Asserting that 'not onely the im- aginary Vision of Angels is necessary for our instruction, but that also which is corporal and bodily', this explained in technical detail how such creatures could be said to manifest themselves in anthropomorphic forms, with the aim of stopping the mouths of those who esteemed these spectres cmeer fables': 'the figure which the Angells take, is in very truth a form which is made by the abscision and dismembring . . . of the thickning of the Ayre, or by the putrefaction of it, or by the similitude and motion which may be taken of the same matter'.122 Against the backdrop of a philo- sophical climate challenged by Cartesian rationalism, there was now an intellectual and epistemological need not just for angelic intervention but also for continued angelic apparitions. Paradoxi- cally, proving the existence of the invisible realm depended on acquiring experimental evidence of those relatively rare occasions on which it impinged on human vision. Along with accounts of witchcraft, wonders and prodigies, the appearance of angels was now a principal weapon in the battle against the mass infidelity into which it was feared England would soon descend. Clerical writers of the period thus found themselves torn between two competing tendencies: their desire to defend Christianity against the onslaughts of Hobbists and Sadducees; and their deference to the Reformed theological legacy of the sixteenth century. This is particularly evident in Benjamin Camfield's Theological Discourse of Angels, and their Ministries (1678), a subject he declared was 'but too suitable to that 121 Henry More, An Antidote against AthÃ©isme: or, An Appeal to the Natural Faculties oftheMindeofMan, whether There Be nota God (London, 1653).

Directing his efforts against a generation of men who dismissed tales of angels as 'Old- Wives stories, or at best the waking dreams of persons idly disposed' (notably John Webster's radical tract of 1677, The Displaying of Supposed Witchcraft), Camfield was concerned to uphold the persistence of angelic intercession on behalf of the faithful against those who defined them as chimeras and fancies of the brain. But he also paid lip service to the axiom that, since the Gospel had already settled the way of salvation, corporeal manifestations of these holy creatures which communicated new revelations to the populace should be treated with extreme suspicion as probable 'Diabolical delusions'.123 In the work of Webster's most vociferous opponent, the Anglican clergyman Joseph Glanvill, however, we find that the hesitation about angelic apparitions that was a hallmark of Protestant discourse in the earlier period has all but disappeared. Closely connected with the Cambridge Platonists, he too sought to marshal an advanced form of natural philosophy in order to demonstrate the real existence and active interference of all kinds of spirits, demonic and benevolent, in the temporal realm. In his posthumously published Saducismus Triumphatus (1681) and its precursors, Glanvill sought to offer ca very considerable and sea- sonable service to Religion against the stupid Saducism and Infidelity of the Age' in the form of a series of impeccably attested accounts of supernatural intervention. 'Since the Intercourses of Angels were so frequent in former days', he asked, 'why should we be averse to the belief that Spirits sometimes transact with Men 123 Camfield, Theological Discourse of Angels, and their Ministries, sig.

Is Utterly Denied and Disproved (London, 1677). Reports of fraudulent Catholic apparitions of angels also continued to appear at this time: see, for example, A True Relation from Germany, of a Protestant Shepherd's Killing a Counterfeit Devil, that Would Have Perverted Him to Popery (London, 1676), which tells how a monk dressed up as an angel 'very gay and beautiful, with a brave pair of Wings, and other Accoutrements' (p. 2).</page><page sequence="49">INVISIBLE HELPERS 1 2 5 now?' 'The Gospel was ushered in by the Apparitions of Angels, and many things done by them in the carrying of it on. And why we should think they may not be sent, and should not appear on occasion now, I do not see'. There was still room for speculation about the precise nature of the bodies they assumed in their inter- actions with human beings: the very criteria for judging the visual status and ontological truth of apparitions were themselves under strain and in the process of change. But Glanvill strategically set to one side the conservatism dictated by the anti-Catholic agenda of Tudor controversialists. Depicted on the engraved title page of his book, one of the key instances he cited was the case ('credibly' reported in letters sent to Ralph Cudworth and Henry More by various Dutch scholars) of the Amsterdam cripple Jesch Claes, cured after a beautiful youth clothed in white appeared to her one night in October 1676 (see Plate 7).124 The Gloucestershire student of physic Thomas Tryon's Treatise of Dreams &amp; Visions (1689) devoted a whole chapter to refuting the proposition that visible transactions between angels and people were more or less extinct. Interestingly the suggestion that 'although they were so usual and frequent in former Ages, yet now they are wholely ceased' was branded a 'vulgar opinion': Protestant orthodoxy had apparently ingrained itself within popular culture. Celestial visions that preached doctrine deroga- tory to Christ should be distrusted, but it was wrong to suppose that angelic apparitions had occurred only 'under the Mosaicall Dispensation'. "Tis against the Principles of God in nature, to suppose any such Chasm or interruption of communication be- tween superiors and inferiours'. Twisting Reformed tradition on this topic in a novel direction, he insisted that, if angels only very occasionally appeared to men and women in the present age, this was less a function of the fact that God had withdrawn such spec- tacles than of the 'frowardness, intemperance and incredulity' of 124 Glanvill, Saducismus Triumphatus, sig.

Yet, even as he emphasized the rarity of such physical manifestations, he too sought to use angels as part of his campaign against impiety and irreligion and to foster due gratitude to God for their diligent ministrations.126 This was an enterprise that united divines from across the eccle- siastical spectrum and, to a surprising degree, cut across the div- isions that pitted Anglicans against Dissenters. By the end of the seventeenth century, it also transcended the deep-seated fear of a repeat of the radical explosion of sectarian enthusiasm that was one of the legacies of the Civil War and Interregnum.127 It par- tially counterbalanced the corrosive effects of the fact that witch- craft and the supernatural had become the prey of political faction in the course of these decades, precipitating a 'process of linguis- tic deconstruction' and a decisive 'intellectual realignment' of educated belief.128 The project to harness angels to combat irreligion and impiety perhaps reached its peak in the Sussex minister William Turner's famous Compleat History of the Most Remarkable Providences, both 125 Thomas Tryon, A Treatise of Dreams &amp; Visions: Wherein the Causes, Natures, and Uses, of Nocturnal Representations, and the Communications Both of Good and Evil Angels, as Also Departed Souls, to Mankind Are Theosophically Unfolded (London, 1689), 202, 207, 210, and see also p. 78. 126 Baxter, Certainty of the World of Spirits, 159-64, 221-36, quotations at p. 229.

This enterprise was echoed at a less sophisticated level by popular publications like those issued by Nathaniel Crouch under the pseudonym Richard Burton, such as R[ichard] B[urton], Admirable Curiosities, Rarities, &amp; Wonders in England, Scotland and Ireland (London, 1682), and R[ichard] B[urton], Wonderful Prodigies of Judgment and Mercy : Discovered in Above Three Hundred Memorable Histories (London, 1682).

Jostling for space with stories of providential punishments, miraculous deliverances and por- tentous wonders, many of the classic tales of angelic intervention analysed above were repeated to support his spirited assertion that 'Angels may appear visibly to the Eye of the mind, as well as to the Eye of sense' and to 'humour the Infirmity of this Unbelieving Club' which denied their very existence. Augmented by further instances in the expanded Dutch translation of Tur- ner's work published in 1737, they were harnessed to refute Bal- thasar Bekker's subversive attack on 'superstitious' beliefs about the agency of good and evil spirits in Betoverde Weereld (The Enchanted World) and to fight a rearguard reaction against the profound early Enlightenment challenge to traditional ideas about the supernatural he launched in this four-volume work.129 It cannot be ignored that Turner and his forerunners relied on a small corpus of frequently recycled episodes to support their claims, on a sample whose modest size reflected the complex web of anxiety and inhibition about otherworldly apparitions explored in the preceding section. Ultimately, the increased prominence of discussion of angelic visions in Protestant litera- ture may be as much a consequence of a declining tendency on the part of the clergy to suppress them as of a growing proclivity to witness them. The confessional tensions that had animated the first generation of reformers had dissipated and been replaced by disturbing new intellectual tendencies which tangible manifest- ations of angelic power could help to neutralize. The trends I have identified may also symptomize the wider shift in the character of post-Reformation providentialism itself described by Blair Worden: a developing impulse to stress the merciful rather than judgemental traits of the deity, to dwell less on his wrathful than on his benevolent and fatherly qualities.130 Coinciding with a 129 Turner, Compleat History of the Most Remarkable Providences, 1 st pagination, sig. blv, ch. 2, pp. 7 and 7-16 passim.

It has underlined the fundamental ambivalence that characterized Protestant thinking on this subject. While angels had impeccable scriptural credentials, the human ten- dency to revere them raised the disturbing problem of supersti- tion and idolatry. Determined to purge away popish accretions and refute the polemical claims of Catholic controversialists, early reformers played down the possibility that such celestial creatures now made themselves visible to human beings, even as they insisted upon the ubiquity of their operations on behalf of the faithful. Emphasis on their constant intervention was matched by the claim that, like miracles, apparitions of angels had largely ceased when the Church came of age. Yet by conced- ing that God might still reveal these heavenly messengers to men and women at critical moments, the theologians created a small but significant loophole within which optical experiences of an- gelic intervention could find space to exist within a Protestant mindset. Such spectral phenomena were to be interpreted warily, however, because they might be deceptive illusions fabri- cated by Satan to seduce humanity to sin and damnation rather than evidence of divine benevolence. The persistence of reports of angelic apparitions should not, then, be seen simply as a measure of the failure of the magisterial Reformation. In some respects, it can instead be read as testimony to its enduring and dynamic, if sometimes unforeseen, effects. Those examples that have entered the historical record are em- blematic of the tensions that surrounded claims about the phys- ical appearance of angels, as of demons, ghosts, fairies and other classes of spirit. They represent temporary suspensions of the</page><page sequence="54">1 30 PAST AND PRESENT NUMBER 208 caution and circumspection that marked Protestant attitudes to the supernatural in general. They also allow us to delineate the shape and colour of the spectacles through which the visual ex- periences of early modern Englishmen and women were refracted and filtered. Finally, the tangled story I have traced has something to tell us about the way in which Reformed theology and culture reacted and adapted to the ever-changing intellectual and cultural climate in which it found itself. This was a climate in which strong con- victions about the unpredictable intrusion of otherworldly forces retained their vitality alongside increasingly vocal articulations of the notion that incorporeal spirits were incapable of interacting physically with mortal beings. The propensity of Protestants to see angels waned and waxed throughout the early modern period, in keeping with alterations in the wider environment. Belief and scepticism coexisted, and responses to such phenomena were shaped by the particular political, ecclesiastical and social cir- cumstances in which they arose. As the confessional struggles that had dominated the first generations after the Reformation became partially eclipsed by the battle to defend Christianity against the threat of irreligion, a shift in priorities took place. The rise of 'Sadduceeism', 'atheism' and materialist philosophies in the latter half of the seventeenth century not only had the effect of provoking renewed attention to the activities of angels; it also compelled an alliance of godly scientists and Protestant ministers to suppress or subtly modify the claim that they no longer assumed tangible forms. Ironically, angels were obliged to cast aside their magical cloak of invisibility in order to reveal the reality of the unseen world.131 University of Exeter Alexandra Walsham 131 For recent work complicating claims about the progressive 'disenchantment of the world' in this era, see Robert W.
