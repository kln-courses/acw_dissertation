<plain_text><page sequence="1">LESLIE THARP MYTH AND MATHEMATICS: A CONCEPTUALISTIC PHILOSOPHY OF MATHEMATICS I INTRODUCTION The present work aims to develop a conceptualistic philosophy of ma thematics, and as one result, to make it less mysterious that we do have mathematical knowledge. The view is conceptualistic in the sense that it claims that in mathematics, concepts, expressed by linguistic predi cates, are primary. The concepts are meant to be of a humanly grasp able nature, involving humanly understandable criteria. It is claimed that concepts not only are primary in mathematics, but are practically everything: for the most part, 'mathematical objects' do not have a separate or further existence beyond the concepts; reference to 'them' is only a manner of speaking about the concepts. We do not deny the existence of real or actual abstract objects. On the contrary, we ex plicitly accept such objects. But we adopt a quite finitistic and mentalis tic (and somewhat intuitionistic) position with regard to these actual abstract objects, among which we include concepts. It is claimed, none theless, that our finitistic view imposes no restrictions on mathematics, just because mathematics is not based on reference to objects. In order to illuminate this conceptualistic position, a comparison with fiction will be made. The comparison is not intended in any pejorative sense whatsoever. Rather, we wish to focus attention on the technical fact that myth and other fiction frequently operate with meaningful everyday concepts, but without objects. In fiction one has all along been using ordinary logical forms and inferences in contexts where no objects are referred to. We hasten to acknowledge that fiction some times does deal with people, things, and events which are actual as well as those which are fictional; this fact may even be relevant to appli cations of mathematics, but we shall set aside these and many other complications which arise in fiction, and suppose that everything is pure and simple. At first glance there appear to be insuperable obstacles to the sugges tion that mathematics may profitably be considered to be a kind of fiction. Nothing could be more striking than the sharpness and definite Synthese 81: 167-201, 1989. ? 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers. Printed in the Netherlands.</page><page sequence="2">168 LESLIE THARP ness of mathematics on the one hand, and the rather arbitrary and indefinite nature of most fiction on the other. Fiction undeniably in volves a great number of stipulations, but we claim that the most significant difference between fiction and mathematics is that the latter is based on a few peculiarly sharp concepts. We also claim that the concepts of mathematics are quite close to familiar everyday concepts, although they are sometimes refined and extrapolated to a great extent; one might say they are extrapolated to an inconceivably great extent in current set theory. 1. A SHORT STORY In Chapter II of his book, Ontology and the Vicious Circle Principle, Charles Chihara describes a kind of "mythological Platonism". His position is not claimed to be "a completely satisfactory philosophical theory of set theory" (Chihara, p. 74); instead, his discussion of myth is used to clarify and criticize G?del's ontological Platonism. The present treatment has benefited greatly from Chihara's discussion and may be regarded as an attempt to develop a satisfactory general philosophy of mathematics along the lines he suggests.1 But our treatment will differ in certain ways. One way can be guessed from the introduction: we wish to emphasize that concepts such as 'x is an angel' are quite vague, and their vagueness casts doubt on the claim that mathematics might possibly be a kind of fiction. Another difference is that, in contrast to Chihara, we claim that arithmetic, like set theory, is based on concepts (see his note 9, p. 79). The present view emphasizes the unity of mathematics, and proposes a uniform framework intended to en compass all mathematical theories. We also differ from Chihara in advocating a strictly finitistic position. Further differences, such as those in our attitudes towards abstract objects, will emerge in the course of the discussion. As an illustration of the role of fiction in our argument, consider the following very short story. The only people in our story are Gertrude and Hamlet. Gertrude is a queen, Hamlet is a prince, and Gertrude is Hamlet's mother. Given these two stipulations which constitute our story, various conse quences follow from the meanings of the concepts 'prince', 'queen',</page><page sequence="3">MYTH AND MATHEMATICS 169 and 'mother', and are evidently true-in-the-story: for example, no princes are queens; Gertrude and Hamlet are distinct; Hamlet is not Gertrude's mother. None of these conclusions follow logically from the given story, however. Also, the first conclusion doesn't even use our stipulations. One may have serious general doubts about the clarity and usefulness of 'meaning', 'analyticity', and related notions. But whatever general skepticism one may have, there can be no question that in particular cases the meanings of certain concepts are so definite that various specific conclusions are forced upon us. On the face of it, fiction certainly looks very different from mathemat ics. A major reason is that in fiction, the stipulations, which are largely arbitrary, are predominant, and inferences are made more or less un consciously. Although the stipulations are largely arbitrary, once the stipulations are fixed, the consequences of those stipulations are thereby fixed. (At least this is approximately true: we assume that the concepts are reasonably clear, that they are taken literally, and so forth; we also ignore the many further subtle problems of actual literature.) Given that one starts out with largely arbitrary stipulations, the truths-in-the story will be correspondingly arbitrary. For example, in the present story, 'There is only one prince' is evidently true-in-the-story although not really true. However, underneath this truth-in-the-story lies an actual truth which may be expressed roughly as 'In any world (of the appropriate sort) which satisfies the stipulations, there is only one prince'. The semantics will be studied in more detail in Part II, but let us give some indication of our general view. The 'collection of worlds' of the appropriate sort is determined by the basic concepts. For example, in no appropriate world will anything be both a prince and a queen, because the initial concepts 'prince' and 'queen' have certain meanings which rule out that possibility. On the other hand, if we had selected the concepts 'poor' and 'queen', then indeed there would be appropriate worlds for those latter concepts in which something is both poor and a queen. In any case, there will be a great variety of worlds appropriate to the initial concepts chosen, differing (for example) in the number of 'individuals' present, "their" relations with one another, and so on. But of course a given world of the appropriate sort may or may not satisfy whatever stipulations were set down. Clearly any world of the appropriate sort which satisfies the stipulations of our Hamlet story will</page><page sequence="4">170 LESLIE THARP have precisely two distinct individuals, one a prince, and the other a queen who is the prince's mother.2 We are making the overall claim that underneath a given truth-in-the-Hamlet-story such as 'There is only one prince', there lies an actual truth which is primarily a truth about the basic concepts and the two stipulations which constituted our story. That actual truth, as stated before, is roughly 'In any world (of the appropriate sort) which satisfies the stipulations, there is only one prince'. It is perhaps unclear how to precisely formulate the view just sketched, and it is perhaps unclear whether an appeal to the 'actual existence' of the usual mathematical (or other platonistic) objects can be avoided. One of our tasks in the course of this work is to convince the reader that such obstacles can be overcome. (An awkward problem with the use of fiction to motivate our discussion is that, even to a crude approximation, fiction is an order of magnitude more complex than mathematics; this is because of the existence of stipulations, as we discuss further in Section 3.) Whatever reservations a reader may have about the details of the foregoing, I think it should be highly convincing that one has a strong sense of the natural meanings or criteria involved in everyday concepts such as 'prince' and 'queen' - princes are male, queens are female, and no males are female; and that one automatically reads such inferences as 'No princes are queens' into a story, where there simply are no objects to be referred to. In short, concepts by themselves frequently force definite conclusions with no help from a universe of objects. We have claimed that in mathematics the concepts are peculiarly sharp, and will now turn to an examination of those concepts. 2. THE QUASI-COMBINATORIAL In a paper called 'On Platonism in Mathematics', Paul Bernays sketches what he calls "a rational platonism". He explains his sense of Platonism by passages such as: The value of platonistically inspired mathematical conceptions is that they furnish models of abstract imagination.... They form representations which extrapolate from certain regions of experience and intuition, (p. 275) We have set forth only a restricted platonism which does not claim to be more than, so to speak, an ideal projection of a domain of thought, (p. 277)</page><page sequence="5">MYTH AND MATHEMATICS 171 The use of such terms as "models of abstract imagination", "extra polate", and "ideal projection of a domain of thought", makes Ber nays's Platonism appear to be a kind of conceptualism, and in parti cular to have a mentalistic subject matter. But I do not wish to evaluate or discuss Bernays's overall position; rather, I wish to concentrate on his notion of the 'quasi-combinatorial'. In explaining the sense in which mathematical analysis is Platonistic, Bernays remarks: These notions [sets, sequences, and functions] are used in a 'quasi-combinatorial' sense, by which I mean: in the sense of an analogy of the infinite to the finite, (p. 275) Bernays means, as the following passages show, that in analysis, combi natorial concepts are extrapolated to the infinite: Consider, for example, the different functions which assign to each member of the finite series, 1, 2,..., n a member of the same series. There are nn functions of this sort, and each of them is obtained by n independent determinations. Passing to the infinite case, we imagine functions engendered by an infinity of independent determinations which assign to each integer an integer, and we reason about the totality of these functions. In the same way, one views a set of integers as the result of infinitely many independent acts deciding for each number whether it should be included or excluded, (p. 275) What is special about combinatorial concepts, or for that matter, what does one mean by a 'combinatorial' concept? Perhaps some examples will help. (1) x is a permutation of the sequence (Socrates, Plato, Aris totle). (2) jc is the truth value of (P-^Q) v (P-^-Q), under the truth table rules, when P and Q are assigned truth values y and z. (3) x is a computation of Turing machine y given input z. All of these concepts, further elaborated if necessary, share a near absolute sharpness. Unlike concepts such as 'x is a prince', y is a castle', and 'z has an Oedipus complex', they seem to have totally definite truth values for all appropriate arguments. To explain why is perhaps not easy. To a first approximation, combinatorial concepts seem founded on the notion of taking discrete, well-individuated pieces of matter, and moving or matching them in definite, well-distinguished ways. The moves and configurations of board games give excellent examples; the comparison of (appropriate standardized) inscriptions for congruence gives another example. Ambiguity can be easily ruled</page><page sequence="6">172 LESLIE THARP out, and the possibility of error in our judgments about such concepts is minimal.3 Revision seems to be possible only in rather uninteresting senses, since any change is such a definite change that it can be dis missed as a change of subject. It is such mechanical concepts which admit of sharp, definite extrapol ation. Here we are in agreement with Bernays. One word of caution, though. We are defending the view that mathematics is based on con cepts. Part II of this paper will systematically consider questions con cerning whether concepts are primarily mental or are primarily external to us, and to what extent and in what sense the present view is platonis tic. (We will conclude they are primarily mental.) The points presently being made are that in general the concepts on which modern mathe matics is founded are of a combinatorial nature; and that in particular a concept such as 'x is a set of numbers' is extrapolated from such everyday concepts as 'x is a heap of pebbles' and 'x is a group of men'. 3. davy's number blocks Let us see how a non-trivial branch of mathematics such as number theory (also called 'Peano arithmetic') might arise from everyday con cepts. Suppose that Davy has blocks of a certain sort, some of them with a 'Z' stamped on them, and some of them bearing a stroke '|'. Let us also suppose that they can be fitted together into objects which read 'z||... ||'. We shall call such objects consisting of a Z-block, followed by some (or no) [-blocks, tallies, and we shall ignore all other objects which Davy might build. Of course in practice Davy has only a small finite number of blocks. But the exact number of blocks he possesses seems rather arbitrary and accidental. In our story it is very tempting to ignore any particular bound, and even ignore the fact that there must be some bound; so we shall suppose that tallies can be built one block at a time, without limit. Our claim is that we can specify combinatorial concepts, perfectly meaningful for ordinary strings of blocks; and, moreover, that the concepts will be so definite that all of the axioms of Peano arithmetic will force themselves upon us as being true.4 In our story we shall leave Davy out, and merely speak of the fictional tallies, using six specified concepts. The first concept determines the universe (or, as we shall say, is the universe of the story). That concept is Tx, 'x is a tally',</page><page sequence="7">MYTH AND MATHEMATICS 173 where it is understood that tallies may be of any finite length. The other five concepts are the relational concepts of the story. (A relational concept, as we use the term, may have a single argument; the adjective 'relational' merely indicates the role of the concept in the story.) The first of these five is the usual relational concept of congruence between tallies. Next, let us use 'Zr' for 'jc is a Z-block'. The other three relational concepts are: Sxy.y is congruent to a tally which results by adding a | block to x. Axyz'-z is congruent to a tally which results by adding a copy of the [-blocks of y to the end of x. Mxyz : z is congruent to a tally which results by taking a z block and adding to it, for each and every |-block of y, a copy of the |-blocks of x. Obviously S, A, and M, are versions of the successor, addition and multiplication relations. As we said, it is natural to idealize and suppose that Davy can build arbitrarily long tallies. Normally, we have taken the universe to be the concept 'x is a tally', stating that tallies may be of any finite length. Given that understanding, (x)(Ey)Sxy is a consequence. (Here, and in what follows, quantifiers are tacitly restric ted to the universe of the subject in question, here to the universe of fictional tallies; exactly what we mean by this is discussed at length in the next section.) A typical axiom of Peano arithmetic is (y)(Zy-*(x) - Sxy), kZero is not a successor'. It seems to me that one is absolutely committed to this axiom by the concepts we have specified: if one adds a |-block to any tally, one won't get something congruent to a bare Z-block! It is hardly necessary to remark that our story is intended to be taken in a rather straight way, with no witches, magic, or the like. The other axioms of Peano arithmetic seem to me no more problem atical than this one, with the exception perhaps of induction schema: [(x)(Zx -&gt; ^x)&amp;(x)(y)((cf&gt;x&amp;Sxy) -+ &lt;f&gt;y)] -&gt; (jc)0r. Suppose a person describes the story as we have done and assumes that every Z-block falls under a given concept &lt;/&gt;; and that the concept &lt;/&gt; is preserved from a tally to its successors; and yet denies or refuses to accept the conclusion that all tallies fall under the concept (/&gt;. Then it would be unintelligible to me what I am to understand. It would be</page><page sequence="8">174 LESLIE THARP much as if I were told to understand the Hamlet story in a literal way, and then informed that Gertrude actually was identical with Hamlet. More exactly, the tallies are understood to be built step by step by adding blocks. Since the antecedent of the induction axiom states that the concept &lt;f&gt; propagates through the tallies as they are built, one is forced to conclude that every tally falls under &lt;f&gt;. (Compare Parsons's similar remarks on induction (Parsons, p. 161).) As far as number theory is concerned, I see no reason at all to suppose that knowledge of mathematical truths draws on special intuitions of special (and evidently somewhat occult) relations and objects. On the contrary, it seems that very familiar and graspable combinatorial concepts lend themselves quite readily to forcing us to accept the axioms of number theory. There is one component, however, which may cause discomfort. We have stated that tallies may be of any finite length. The notion 'of any finite length' appears to be distinctly mathematical and evidently in volves some sort of extrapolation beyond ordinary concepts. On the one hand, it is quite clear that if a tally is built, one is permitted to build a larger tally by adding a |-block. So there is no largest permissible tally. What is not quite clear is how to state in an absolute fashion what we mean by 'finite'. The naive description of a person endlessly building tallies in space-time seems to express reasonably well what we want. One can perhaps add something by using more theoretical machinery, such as the notions of set theory: in set theory one may say that the tallies are as small a collection as possible (that is, that they are the intersection of all sets of a certain kind), and the induction axioms then become provable. But however one analyzes and formulates 'finite', there seems to be a justifiable feeling that the concept 'x is a tally (of any finite length)' is not tied down to earth in the absolute fashion in which, say, 'x is a Z-block' is determined: The most we will claim is that from both the naive description, and from more theoretical view points, the concept is determinate enough to force one to accept the axioms of arithmetic. Notice that Peano arithmetic, unlike our Hamlet story, uses no stipu lations. That is, whatever stipulational component there was, was incor porated in the concepts; we did not set down stipulations as separate statements. We had only to specify the concepts we wished to discuss, and we then inferred the axioms of Peano arithmetic from our under standing of the concepts. In Peano arithmetic we are speaking of a single definite 'structure' given by the concept Tx which is the universe,</page><page sequence="9">MYTH AND MATHEMATICS 175 plus the five relational concepts. (Such stipulation-free theories as Peano arithmetic will still be called 'stories' although they are obviously special cases. Also note that the distinction we have made - between the Hamlet story with its stipulations, and arithmetic with its single definite 'structure' - corresponds to Chihara's distinctions between "true to a story" and "true to a concept" (Chihara, p. 70). Of course one could have explicit stipulations in mathematics. For example, we could retain the concept 'x is a tally' and the relational concepts of Peano arithmetic to give a background structure, and then add the stipulation 'Every tally has at most one stroke, and there are two tallies which are not congruent'. Then, &lt;/&gt; would be true-in-this story just in case cf) holds true in a substructure whose universe has tallies of both types Z and Z\, and only of these two types. This would be a totally different story from Peano arithmetic, of course, and for example, -(x)(Ey)Sxy clearly holds in the new story.5 In interpreted mathematical theories, it is generally the case, as it is in arithmetic, that one specifies a concept Ux as the universe, and several relational concepts for the relations, without stating separate stipulations. These concepts give a single definite 'structure'; the quanti fiers of each sentence are tacitly restricted to the universe specified, and each sentence has a truth value. (At least one intends to give a definite 'structure' so that each sentence has a definite truth value; for the present, we shall set aside the problems of indeterminacy.) As a simple example, let Ux be the concept 'x is a tally with at most one stroke', and retain the same relational concepts as before. Then relative to this structure one has ~(x)(Ey)Sxy. (In fact, one has exactly the same truths in this story as in the story of the preceding paragraph which used stipulations.) The truth of -(x)(Ey)Sxy in the present story does not contradict the fact that (x)(Ey)Sxy holds in Peano arithmetic, be cause in the latter sentence quantifiers are restricted to the concept Tx, whereas in the former sentence they are restricted to Ux, which is a quite different universe. Let us give a more interesting example of what we claim is generally the case for interpreted mathematical theories: one just uses concepts without setting down stipulative statements. Consider the theory of numbers plus sets of numbers (henceforth called, as is customary, 'analysis'). We need to add to our arithmetical concepts the new con cepts 'x is a set of tallies' and 'xEy\ Of course, the concept of a set of tallies is supposed to be the natural extrapolation of the concept 'x</page><page sequence="10">176 LESLIE THARP is a heap of objects (of a given kind)'; and 'xE v' is to be the natural extrapolation of the concept of an object x being located in a heap y. The universe of analysis is taken to be the concept 'x is a tally or x is a set of tallies'. It must be emphasized that a set may be composed of tallies in a completely arbitrary way; it is merely assumed that, for a given set, each tally is definitely in the set, or definitely not in the set. Given all of these understandings, it seems to me that for any concept &lt;f)x defined for tallies, one must accept the axiom 'There is a set contain ing exactly those tallies x such that &lt;f&gt;x\ In particular, such axioms must be accepted if cf&gt; is expressed by a formula of the extended language; and this is the key new axiom schema of analysis.6 It seems to me also that building upwards in the transfinite Zermelo Fraenkel hierarchy of sets is a natural extension of the foregoing. I won't pursue that, for it would involve an extended discussion of the iterative set concept. But it should be noted that just adding a few more layers of sets suffices for most classical mathematics. The present conceptualistic view provides a very general framework for mathematical theories of different kinds. Consider, for example, old-fashioned geometry and intuitionism. By old-fashioned geometry, I mean the informal geometry which led to Euclid's axiomatization, before the development of diverse geometries, either axiomatically or within other theories such as set theory. I think that for old-fashioned geometry we should imagine Davy playing with various straight rods and tight ropes. When we build our story we are appealing to fictional rods or ropes, but the interesting difference is that the concepts do not have the absolutely sharp nature of those of our number theory story, 'x is straight' actually appeals to complex physical phenomena, and the natural criteria one would use to explain 'straight', such as sighting along a rod or a rope, are of a distinctly fuzzy character.7 Although the concepts are definite enough to guide the story fairly well, it would seem that certain small or remote perturbations of the story are not ruled out by one's intuitive concept 'x is straight'. The philosophical situation is evidently complicated, since geometry was once the paradigm of mathematics, but has since been reclassified as either a physical subject, or else as a loose kind of precise mathematical structures. On the one hand, one could retain what was undoubtedly the original motivation, namely a description of physical phenomena, and take geometry to be a physical science, say the theory of paths of light rays. Even this science might be somewhat idealized, since one</page><page sequence="11">MYTH AND MATHEMATICS 177 might eventually want to concentrate on macroscopic properties, such as the bending of light by massive bodies, and ignore fine (quantum) properties. In any case, taken as a physical subject the concepts are tied much more directly to particular physical phenomena than are combinatorial concepts; and the development of new mathematical and physical theories, plus appropriate experimental evidence, can lead to refinement of the original concepts, and in fact disprove the proposition that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees. A second alternative is to dissociate geometry from any further inves tigation of the phenomena which provided the original motivation. It appears that this second alternative was generally adopted, perhaps largely unconsciously. Then the subject does seem somewhat indetermi nate. The parallel postulate is compatible with one's intuitive concepts, and the resulting subject, Euclidean geometry, is elegant, practically useful, and may be formulated in various ways as a definite mathemat ical structure from the viewpoint of set theory. However, one is by no means forced to accept the parallel postulate on the basis of one's intuitive concepts, as one is forced to accept the axioms of arithmetic. It seems that this was on occasion recognized in antiquity, at least in later antiquity.8 In modern times it has been proven that one's intuition could not force one to accept Euclidean geometry, insofar as it has been proved, for example, that a triangle formed by light rays need not have angles totaling 180 degrees. Under this second alternative, which does not take geometry to be a physical science, there are a range of formally distinct subjects compatible with untutored intuition, and a broader range of mathematical structure related by some sort of analogy.9 Intuitionism also seems to receive some illumination here. Davy may be able to do certain mental calculations. But past some rather small number he will not be able to calculate x2 in his head.10 Again, the natural story one would tell about Davy's (fictional) mental construc tions would sound very much like intuitionism. The story may be guided reasonably well by concepts similar to y is a mental computation of x2' or 'z is a mental proof that (x + y)2 ^ x2 + y2 for all mentally construct ible numbers x and y'; but such concepts are rather indefinite and decidedly anthropomorphic. In opposition to some of the preceding remarks on the looseness of concepts, it might be pointed out that, for example, Euclidean geometry is in some sense quite sharp, because certain formulations are complete</page><page sequence="12">178 LESLIE THARP and decidable. (This objection was made by D. A. Martin, whose demurrers prompted the present and much of the next two paragraphs.) The initial reaction to this objection is to note that the very criteria appealed to - namely completeness and decidability - are overtly combi natorial, that is, of a mechanical nature. A more general response is to observe that one may start with any of a wide variety of fuzzy concepts, adopt a precise formal language, and then infer such axioms as seem most plausible. Perhaps one will use special connectives and quantifiers - which will demand special rules of proof - as one does in intuitionism; perhaps one will impose stipulations as we did in the Hamlet story. In any case, one gets something sharp: namely, the precise formal system resulting from one's choices. In our Hamlet story, the basic concepts were not completely sharp, but the stipulations imposed a highly definite finite structure (Note 2). In intuitionism, one has the rather unclear notions of 'mentally constructible number' and 'intuitionistically acceptable proof. However, the standard formaliz ation of intuitionistic arithmetic turns out to be intertranslatable with classical arithmetic.11 Our basic concern has been whether the initial concepts themselves are so sharp as to force a unique theory, and we explicitly deny that this is the case in old-fashioned geometry. Of course, as Putnam has emphasized (Putnam 1975), no one had conceived of a theory which might have been proposed as an alternative to Euclidean geometry until about the year 1815. (It was widely felt that the parallel postulate should be proved from more evident assumptions, and attempts to prove it by reductio ad absurdum led, in effect, to the construction of a good deal of non-Euclidean geometry. But I know of no reliable evidence that, prior to Gauss, anyone seriously entertained constructing an alternative theory. After sustained efforts to prove the parallel postulate, Gauss gradually became convinced of the consistency of a non-Euclidean geometry.12) We differ with Putnam (see Putnam 1975, pp. viii-x) and claim that such paucity of imagination is distinctly differ ent from the situation in arithmetic, where one feels forced to accept the standard axioms. It would seem bizarre to say, following Proclus (Note 8), that the fact that induction fails in certain mathematical structures "strips our imagination of its plausibility", "until we have firmly demonstrated" that induction holds for arithmetic. It was admit tedly felt by Frege that arithmetic needed a foundation. I am not sure how widely this feeling was shared, although the prospect of showing</page><page sequence="13">MYTH AND MATHEMATICS 179 arithmetic to be a body of 'analytic' or 'logical' truths might have been highly attractive to many, had they entertained the possibility. In any case, when Frege's attempts to provide a foundation went awry, he did not conclude that perhaps some of the axioms of arithmetic were false - but rather that arithmetic lacked a foundation. In striking contrast, Gauss concluded (in 1799): ... the path I have chosen does not lead at all to the goal which we seek.... It seems rather to compel me to doubt the truth of geometry itself.... It would, indeed be possible that the area [of an arbitrary triangle] might always remain below a certain limit, however far apart the three angular points of the triangle were taken.13 I think it clear that our basic sense of sharpness is intimately involved with combinatorial concepts, and that 'combinatorial' is not merely a label for certain unexplained phenomena, but has a great deal of direct intuitive content. That content arises from our acquaintance with com mon mechanical processes, processes whose discrete, small-finite nature rules out fuzziness, continuity, and borderline cases. A 'quasi-' compo nent manifestly enters when one extrapolates these combinatorial con cepts to the infinite. Furthermore, current large cardinal set theory seems to me to behave just as one would expect: as one ascends into the higher infinities, leaving familiar mechanical processes behind, one's concepts gradually become blurred, and the subject takes on a quasi empirical and quasi-formal character. The universe of set theory is the concept 'x is a set (of the pure iterative kind; of arbitrarily large size - but of some size, otherwise it would be of a proper class)'. There is a general assumption or pretense that this concept is about certain definite discrete objects in a manner similar to 'x is a tally'. We do not deny that there are certain abstract objects falling under the concept which constitutes the universe of set theory: as mentioned in the intro duction, and as will be discussed in Part II, we accept the existence of a small-finite number of certain abstract objects, among them certain sets. But we maintain that the meaning of the universe of set theory is quite unclear and genuinely indeterminate. Let us remark that the view we have sketched is intended to be liberal. It is not suggested that old-fashioned geometry and intuitionism are nonsense. The point is, rather, that the basic concepts are not as definite as those of arithmetic or parts of set theory. Perhaps a further consideration is that intuitionism is not as useful as either old-fashioned</page><page sequence="14">180 LESLIE THARP geometry or classical mathematics. But it may have compensating at tractions, just because the concepts are more closely related to human knowledge. For example, formal intuitionistic systems typically have the property: given a proof of (Ex)cf)x, one can in principle find a term t and a proof of &lt;f&gt;t. Proofs in intuitionistic and other constructive systems may well give more information than is explicitly stated in the theorem. We do not want to give an exaggerated impression of the closeness of intuitionism to actual human mental activities, though. Intuitionism also greatly extrapolates beyond what is practically feas ible, and is related to actual mental constructions in approximately the same way that our treatment of arithmetic is related to actual (physical) tallies.14 4. TRUTH AND DEDUCTION IN MATHEMATICS In a recent paper, 'Mathematical Truth', Paul Benacerraf has discussed a certain dilemma: it seems impossible to account for mathematical truth in such a way as to make it plausible that mathematical knowledge is possible. Benacerraf supposes (pp. 666-67) mathematical truth to be based on reference to objects, and on that view there does appear to be a dilemma, which the present efforts hope to overcome. As is clear from the foregoing, I believe that the framework of truth for mathematics which he sketches must be rejected; certainly it must be rejected as an ultimate explanation. In fact, I question his account of truth and knowledge even for simple cases, such as that of Hermione and her truffles. As Benacerraf states in a footnote (p. 662), he is setting aside the notion of meaning in favor of the notion of reference. He also states that predicates designate (p. 663) or refer to (pp. 667, 671) their relations. It seems to me that Hermione's use of a predicate such as 'is larger than' should be explained along quite different lines. In agreement with Benacerraf, the present view assumes that refer ence is accomplished by means of a causal connection between the speaker and the object referred to. Provided that the object referred to is somehow constructed from - or, more loosely, associated with - tangible representatives, there is evidently a sense in which reference to an abstract object is possible, by means of reference to one or more tangible representatives. Abstract objects and concepts will be discussed at length in Part II, but for now let me make two points. First, it is surely implausible that all mathematical objects can be individually</page><page sequence="15">MYTH AND MATHEMATICS 181 associated with distinct tangible representatives; so reference to these objects is, as Benacerraf maintains, in general quite problematical. Secondly, concerning predicates, I differ with Benacerraf and claim that in their predicative use they are not being used to refer to relations. When a predicate is intelligently and purposefully used to express a proposition, it seems fair to say that one grasps the meaning of the predicate and that one is employing certain abilities. But I think it clear that the predicative use of a predicate does not involve reference to a relation any more than the instructions for an ordinary testing proce dure involve reference to some relation underlying those instructions.15 In a proposition such as 'Hermione understands the predicate "is larger than"', there occurs, besides the name 'Hermione', also the referential term 'the predicate "is larger than"'. Clearly, the predicate 'is larger than' is in some sense a part of that latter referential term. (Also it is clear that the referential term in question refers to the predicate in question.) Our point is that this use of the predicate 'is larger than' - as part of a referential term - is quite different from its predicative use in a proposition such as 'This truffle is larger than that truffle'. Further, it is not denied that within a predicate there may be in various senses components which refer to objects. What we deny is that, in its predicative use, the predicate as a whole is being used to refer to the corresponding relation or concept, or to the predicate itself, or to any such entity. Our reasons for holding this view are not merely grammatical. They are based on an intuitive feeling that such predica tive use in a proposition is more nearly akin to the use of instructions to express a testing procedure, than to the use of a term to designate an object. A computer can be programmed with instructions which will cause it to perform a desired test. Is it necessary, helpful, or plausible to assume that those instructions designate a relation or some other kind of object? (Please do not conclude, however, that we are advocat ing some sort of verificationism.) Even if the reader allows us the use of meaningful predicates, generously granting that their problems are no problems peculiar to mathematics, it may be a problem to account for deduction in our object-free stories. Presumably deduction is somehow justified by a soundness proof. Benacerraf explicitly says this (p. 670): As it is, standard quantifier inferences are justified by some sort of soundness proof. The</page><page sequence="16">182 LESLIE THARP formalization of theories in first-order logic requires for its justification the assurance (provided by the Completeness theorem) that all the logical consequences of the postu lates will be forthcoming as theorems. Let us first deal with the second sentence, since it is surely wrong. It is completely implausible to suggest that one wasn't justified in using first-order formalizations before the completeness proof. The situation may be illuminated by considering arithmetic. Speaking mathemati cally, mathematical induction holds for all sets of numbers, and induc tion formulated as a schema in the first-order language of arithmetic is a manifestly inadequate statement of the intended induction axiom. Not all truths of arithmetic are provable from this mechanically decidable set of axioms, and of course by the G?del incompleteness results, no mechanical procedure will list all truths of arithmetic. That all logical consequences of these (excessively weak) axioms are provable by com pleteness is a minor consideration. One might as well state induction in the intended way in second-order logic, and infer only some of the consequences because of the incompleteness of second-order logic. The general effect is the same in both cases. Completeness is not essential, but it is essential that the logic be sound, otherwise false conclusions may be provable from true premises. It is a further question whether a proof of soundness justifies the standard quantifier inferences by interpreting them in the standard semantics; perhaps that justification is denied the present position. We want to claim, not that we have an intelligible justification, but rather that a soundness proof doesn't justify logical inferences to start with. Suppose one makes the logical moves: (x)(Px^-gx) -Qh A typical soundness proof justifies these by considering the interpre tations /**, P* and Q* of h, P and Q in a given mathematical structure. One then argues: /z*EP*, P* is contained in the complement of ?&gt;*, hence /z* E Q*. Completely spelled out, one uses exactly the same kinds of logical moves in a set-theoretical (or other metalinguistic) setting as one uses in the matter in question. Is this a justification in any serious sense? I think not. Generally speaking, the soundness proof justifies inferences in one context by using them in another. This does not look very promising for mathematical deduction, and if it does constitute a</page><page sequence="17">MYTH AND MATHEMATICS 183 justification of deduction, the burden of proof of non-circularity is on the one who advocates such justification. While conceding the unlikelihood of justification by means of a soundness proof, the mathematical realist may feel, as a primitive matter, that the quantifier inferences are justified in mathematics be cause it speaks of real objects. But surely the human race used the ordinary logical forms and inferences in myth with great success for countless millenia before the invention of set theory, or of any other systematic mathematics. This alone casts doubt on the necessity of assuming that one is, in some sense, speaking of real objects. Further, I think one can give an illuminating interpretation of the meaning of quantification in our stories. In our number theory story, quantifiers were restricted to a nonempty universe given by the concept Tx, 'x is a tally'. So (Ex)Tx is true in the story and may be understood as 'There could be an x such that Tx\ A modality appears, but I don't think it really appeals to other worlds and their possible inhabitants. Rather, I think one is saying that the concept itself does not rule out some object satisfying it. In contrast, there could be no x which is both a prince and a queen, since the obvious criteria preclude anyone's passing the test. (Of course, in the latter example we are taking the concepts to have their primary meanings, and are assuming there are no unusual borderline cases, and so forth. We feel that the distinctive feature of the combinatorial concepts of mathematics is that just such problems are ruled out.) In general, a given sentence such as (x)(Ey)Sxy is to have quantifiers restricted to T, yielding in this case (x)(Tx -+ (Ey)(Ty&amp;Sxy)); the quan tifiers are read modally, giving 'For any possible x, if x is a tally, there could be a tally y such that Sxy\ In our version of number theory, where the concepts such as T and S essentially deal with discrete geometrical patterns, it seems to me that the modalities are perfectly clear. Let us henceforth understand (x) and (Ex) to be these modal quantifiers 'for all possible x' and 'there could be an x'. The present conceptualistic view may be further illustrated as follows. Suppose that we are entertaining a certain kind of round pegs, and a square hole, all understood to be of a standard size with both pegs and hole specified by a suitable diagram. And suppose we assert 'Round pegs cannot fit in the square hole'. This assertion is exactly the kind of modality we have been considering, and it seems to say 'All possible round pegs fail to fit in the square hole', or perhaps, 'It is false that</page><page sequence="18">184 LESLIE THARP there could exist a round peg which fits in the square hole'. The first version sounds like a proposition about certain abstract entities, namely 'possible pegs'. The second version sounds like a proposition about ordinary (physical) pegs - a proposition about their 'possible existence'. (Compare Parsons, p. 163; and see our further discussion of his views, below.) I think the original proposition and the suggested rewordings should be understood as propositions about the concepts in question, specifi cally about the incompatible patterns which were specified by the dia gram. Our belief in the impossibility of fitting round pegs in the square hole comes from looking at the patterns; the patterns are the source of our belief, and they are primarily what we are talking about. Of course, our belief can have predictive consequences for ordinary pegs: if the original modal assertion is right, no ordinary peg of the specified sort will be found to fit a hole of the specified sort. The modal assertion says more than this, however, and to construe it as being about ordinary pegs fails to reflect either the source of our belief or the content of the statement. To construe it as being about certain abstract objects - 'possible pegs' - leads, as is well known, to intractable epistemological and metaphysical problems; and to so construe it leads, I would claim, to no helpful or plausible explanations whatsoever. Let us give one more example illustrative of the present position. Suppose one has a computer program tt, which one intends to apply to certain inscriptions on a tape, and assume that the program is de signed to yield a Yes or No answer, or perhaps no answer at all. Suppose also that inscriptions of the forms Z, Z\, Z\\,... are among those entertained; consider them to be tallies, for convenience. One may be able to see from inspection of the program it that any possible tally must pass the test tt. For example, tt might express a complicated tautology, or tt might search for a prime number greater than that represented by the given tally. If tt has such a character, and any possible tally must pass tt, this fact would be expressed by the modal quantification (x)(7x^7rx). I think it is clear that (x)(7x-^7rx) is a proposition about the two programs T and tt. Regarding T and tt as concepts, it states that the concept T is subordinate to the concept tt. It is not primarily a proposition about the actual tallies which happen to exist, although it has consequences for ordinary tallies. Nor is it necessary or plausible to postulate a realm of 'possible tallies' over which the quantifiers range. Note finally that our example is not trivial,</page><page sequence="19">MYTH AND MATHEMATICS 185 and that many interesting propositions (e.g., Goldbach's conjecture and consistency propositions) have the form (x)(Tx^7rx). We emphasize that the modal quantifiers are regarded as operators which transform concepts into concepts, concepts with no free variables being propositions. Of course, we also view the logical connectives - negation, conjunction and the rest - as operators of a similar sort. The overall view in this paper thus amounts to a modal interpretation of mathematics which differs in emphasis, and, in certain ways, in substance, from those I have seen in the literature. In 'Mathematics without Foundations', Putnam construes "statements about sets as statements about standard concrete models for set theory", and re marks, "Introducing the modal connectives... is not introducing new kinds of things we can say about ordinary objects and sorts of objects" (Putnam, pp. 58-59). The present modal treatment, of course, agrees that one is not introducing new kinds of objects; the question is whether the mathematical modalities are about ordinary objects. In a later paper, 'What is Mathematical Truth?', Putnam remarks on the "strong and uniquely mathematical sense of 'possible' and 'impossible'", and also describes his modal view as "the study of ordinary objects with the aid of a special concept" (Putnam, pp. 70, 72). (Presumably Putnam means ordinary physical or other tangible objects, since his point is to offer an alternative to ontological platonism.) Certainly mathematics ignores the problems associated with the physical possibility of existence of ordinary objects, so that, if it is about ordinary objects, the mathe matical sense of possibility is not physical possibility. The main point of disagreement is that I think the modalities are not about ordinary objects, but rather are about ordinary concepts.16 (It might be questioned whether the concepts of the full Zermelo Fraenkel set theory are quite ordinary. I think they are extrapolations of ordinary concepts; certainly the concepts of arithmetic are clear and distinct extrapolations. But let us set aside the problems of set theory and restrict our attention to arithmetic.) If a proposition of arithmetic says There could be a tally x. ..', and it is clear that the tally needed must have more strokes than there are elementary particles in the visible universe, it seems strange to say the proposition is about ordinary tallies. On the other hand, the concept 'x is a tally' does not contain any particular limitations on the lengths of tallies, and I should think it far more natural to say that the proposition is about the concept itself, and not the few actual tallies</page><page sequence="20">186 LESLIE THARP might happen to have. (In fairness, note that in the first paper of Putnam's quoted, he says the propositions in question are about ordi nary "sorts of objects" as well as ordinary objects. There may be agreement in saying the propositions are about ordinary concepts; but the bulk of the evidence suggests Putnam would vigorously disagree with our conceptualistic orientation.) A modal view of arithmetic has also been proposed by Parsons, who discusses a nominalist treatment of number theory: To say that there is a natural number having property F is to say that we can construct a perceptible inscription such that it can be put into the empty place in an inscription of *Fa so that a truth results. (Parsons, p. 160) I am uncomfortable about saying "we can construct &amp; perceptible inscrip tion ..." and "it can be put into the empty place in an inscription..." because such expressions suggest that somehow this treatment of number theory is more tangible, more closely related to physical objects and actual human activities, than it in fact is. However, Parsons does note (p. 160, n. 10): It will be necessary for number theory, however, that it should be possible to construct inscriptions where it seems clearly physically impossible that we should construct them and by no means clear that it is physically possible that they should exist. The notion of 'perceptibility' is rather vaguer than the notion of physical possibility and is designed to signalize the fact that certain basic assumptions about what is constructible are justified by imaginative Gedankenexperimente. I am somewhat puzzled by the use of the word 'perceptibility' in the latter quotation since, earlier in the same section, Parsons uses the word 'perception' for what clearly is actual human perception of linguistic expressions for abstract objects, and actual perception of concrete in stances of structures, such as one's five fingers. Further, in the ex pression "we can construct a perceptible inscription", the modality is presumably expressed by 'can', whereas 'perceptible' modifies 'inscrip tion', thereby helping to define the kind of object to be constructed.17 But whatever the choice of terminology, we agree with the substantive issue, "that certain basic assumptions about what is constructible are justified by imaginative Gedankenexperimente'". The Gedankenexperimente are evidently playing a role in our formu lating an estimate of what is - or what should be - contained in the concept 'x is an inscription (of the appropriate kind)', and one builds one's theory of constructibility using those assumptions. We emphasize</page><page sequence="21">MYTH AND MATHEMATICS 187 that to some extent the Gedankenexperimente may modify the intuitive concepts, typically by discarding certain components indicative of physi cal or mental limitations. Typically, also, the modified concepts are decidedly sharper than the intuitive concepts, just because such messy constraints have been eliminated. We have claimed that the modal propositions of arithmetic are pri marily about concepts, and are about ordinary objects and activities in the indirect sense that the concepts may be applied to ordinary objects arising from ordinary activities, such as an actually constructed inscrip tion. In particular, existential assertions such as 'there is a number may go far beyond anything humanly feasible.18 The discomfort with modal treatments of mathematics is reminiscent of the everyday inter change of 'can' and 'may'. One sometimes says "Herr Schmidt can drive 150 kph on the Autobahn" when he actually cannot (because, say, his Volkswagen won't go that fast). Obviously, what one means is that he may, that is, the relevant rules permit such speed. We interpret the mathematical modalities in such a 'may' sense: one may construct an inscription with 99" strokes - the concepts undeniably permit it. Let us consider some further points which Parsons makes. On p. 163 he says: What actually exists in the way of inscriptions is not enough to make general number theoretic propositions true.... (Perhaps what 'actually exists' in the way of meanings and other intentions entertained by human beings does make statements of number theory true. But that is another matter.) We warmly endorse the first assertion, and the parenthetical suggestion which follows it amounts to a capsule sketch of our overall view. However, in the next paragraph Parsons remarks: Thus it seems that although there is a possible sense of 'ontic commitment' in which our conception is committed only to inscriptions and not to 'abstract entities', this sense diverges from Quine's in a way which is significant. We disagree with what we take to be an implication that a modal treatment commits one to inscriptions (or to similar objects). Perhaps certain inscriptions help one form one's concepts, but that relation seems much too loose to be described as commitment. Moreover, in our treatment of number theory, we did not assume that any such tallies as we described actually exist, and we could have arranged things so that no such tallies do exist (by having pretended, say, that each</page><page sequence="22">188 LESLIE THARP block was composed of one cubic kilometer of pure gold). Evidently we can formulate our concepts quite well, merely by the use of descrip tions, with no help from any actual objects of the kind we pretend to speak of.19 Another point of emphasis is that modal interpretations are not restricted to constructive arithmetic. Quite generally, I believe that conceptualistic modal interpretations are the right explanations of all mathematical theories, ranging from the very constructive to the highly nonconstructive. Each mathematical theory develops the concepts pecu liar to the discipline in question, going far beyond the actual objects to which they may apply. Thus we regard all mathematical theories as being much more nearly on the same plane than is usually supposed.20 (If there are exceptions to our "all", I would guess they are minor.) Returning to the matter of justifying deduction, the main point at issue is whether an assumption of 'reference to real objects' is helpful. A soundness proof, and similar analyses, may have a kind of explana tory or persuasive force, even if they do not constitute a justification.21 Such force as formal arguments have evidently carries over to the present position by interpreting both the object theory and the meta theory in our sense. Formally, we have the same mathematical theories as the realist and, for example, can formulate the usual Tarskian truth theory for arithmetic in analysis. It is formally the same truth theory, but there is a systematic difference in the interpretation of the meaning of quantification. Such formal analyses are not sensitive to the differ ence in interpretation, which is explained at an immediate and intuitive level, as we have been attempting to do. We have been using first-order logic throughout, and it is easy to see that the usual rather circular justifications of the rules of first-order logic have analogues on the present view. For example, consider (x)((x)0x -^(?)x). Any possible x must pass the ktesf (x)&lt;/&gt;x-^(/)x, because if the antecedent fails, x would pass automatically; and if the antecedent holds, then the 'test' 4&gt;x would pass all possible objects.22 The present notion of truth may be regarded as a natural enlargement of the standard 'objectual' or 'referential' notion. That notion takes quantifiers to range over some universe of actually existing objects. In real life - although perhaps not in a formal truth theory - such a universe would almost surely be given by an appropriate concept: if one wants to quantify over the universe of all men actually living on 4 July 1976, one would use the concept 'x is a man living on 4 July 1976'.</page><page sequence="23">MYTH AND MATHEMATICS 189 Special symbols, say V and 3, may be introduced for the objectual quantifiers. Then one may incorporate, into an overarching truth theory, propositions using any combinations of modal and objectual quantifiers, and referring constants as well. We emphasize that concepts play a primary role in ordinary objectual quantifications, since the universe of quantification is almost always specified by a concept: one rarely is in causal contact with each and every object in the universe, and one rarely specifies the universe by enumerating the members. Objectual quantifications are concerned with objects which actually exist (perhaps in a tenseless sense of 'exist', perhaps within some understood period of time), and which fall under the concept specifying the universe. Modal quantifications ignore the somewhat accidental matter of what actually exists, and work with the concept by itself. The present suggestions for a unified truth theory with concepts playing a primary role are intended to reflect our actual practice. Perhaps these suggestions will lead to the sort of "homogene ous semantical theory", embracing both mathematical and nonmathe matical propositions, which Benacerraf requires.23 5. MATHEMATICAL KNOWLEDGE We have attempted to make it plausible that mathematical knowledge can come by inferring axioms from certain concepts, and by using logic to deduce consequences of the axioms. This is quite similar to the observation that one can infer truths about computer programs by studying the programs. Not only can mathematical knowledge come from concepts, but it seems that mathematical knowledge could not come from reference to individual objects. Even if there were a suitable realm of objects - say, 'structures' or 'properties' of some appropriate kind - and even if it were possible to identify each number with one of these objects, one could not have separate beliefs about each individual number, due to one's finite capacities. One could not verify the general truths of number theory by examining each and every number. And the standard Dedekind-Peano axioms of number theory were not in ferred by some inductive procedure or other procedure of empirical methodology. (This is not to deny that quasi-empirical techniques may in some cases give mathematical knowledge; but we shall defer dis cussion of such methods, since we are presently concerned with the primary problems of the standard axioms of number theory.)</page><page sequence="24">190 LESLIE THARP To know that Hamlet is not a queen, it is sufficient to have mastered the concepts, to have been presented with the story, and to have drawn the appropriate consequences from the concepts and stipulations of the story: 'No princes are queens' is inferred from the concepts; 'Hamlet is a prince' is an immediate logical consequence of one of the stipula tions; and 'Hamlet is not a queen' is a logical consequence of the two preceding statements. To know that there are infinitely many prime numbers, it is sufficient to have mastered the concepts, to have inferred the required axioms, and to have followed the appropriate deductions. Such mathematical knowledge does not depend on specific knowledge about each number and it does not require the assumption that numbers exist individually. (Nor does it depend on general knowledge of what a concept is, or of what a mathematical entity is. However, knowledge of typical metalinguistic propositions which actually deal with the on tology of mathematics ('Numbers exist independently of the concepts of number theory') demands prior decisions on these latter issues.) What is needed to acquire knowledge in arithmetic is a grasp of a small finite number of concepts. Each concept is individually grasped by understanding certain criteria ('is a Z-block', 'is congruent to') which can be applied and checked in concrete cases, and which can be un derstood for cases which will not arise, and for cases which cannot arise due to physical impossibilities. The two criteria just mentioned are literally mechanical in that a machine can be programmed to apply them to suitable physical inscriptions. Admittedly one soon goes beyond what is mechanically testable, even in arithmetic. For example, a con sistency sentence has the form (x)(7x-*7rx) ('For all tallies x, x does not represent the G?del number of a proof in the system of a (canoni cally chosen) contradiction'). Tx and ttx are mechanically testable, but one cannot actually carry out the obvious test to check (x)(7x^ttx), if it is true. (If it is false, one might find a counterexample in a practical length of time.) Despite one's inability to carry out the test for (x)(7x-&gt;ttx), one knows what in principle is to be done, and one can reason about the outcomes without deciding in individual cases what the outcome is. In general, mathematics composes concepts and uses them in ways going far beyond what is testable. For example, the rule that one can add a block to any tally and get a new tally generates an infinite universe; one then introduces the concepts 'x is a set of tallies' and</page><page sequence="25">MYTH AND MATHEMATICS 191 'xEy', extrapolating familiar concepts to the context of the infinite universe of tallies. One has a very clear intuitive sense of what can be done with sets: they can be lumped together and intersected; indeed any way of picking out elements gives a set. Sets are very definite just because they are so undemanding. They need not be given individually by particular specifications and they do not demand that the universe be finite. Many of the same general properties are attributed to them in these greatly extrapolated contexts as are attributed to heaps and agglomerations in familiar contexts. (But not too many: as is well known, various 'paradoxes of the infinite' arose by imposing properties on infinite sets which hold only for finite sets, such as 'The whole is greater than the part'.) It should not be completely surprising that the composition of very definite concepts yields a highly definite structure. Also, it is quite clear that there are relatively few concepts which do give such definite structures. By way of contrast, we have discussed old-fashioned geome try and intuitionism, and can point to such philosophically interesting concepts as necessity, apriority, self-evidence, (absolute) provability, justice, responsibility, and any number of others. Their importance is not in question, but they do not have the razor-sharp characteristics of combinatorial concepts, and this fact is reflected in the diverse resulting theories, or, in some cases, in the absence of theories. Despite the definiteness of mathematics, it must also be acknowledged that there is an experimental component: transfinite set theory did not spring fully developed into the mind of the first mathematician who used sets, and we have been known to mix ingredients in unfortunate ways. The view advocated here is not formalistic in that it emphasizes that the concepts are interpreted. It is not finitistic in Hilbert's sense, since his meaningful finitary propositions seem to be restricted to universal quantifications of decidable predicates, of which consistency propo sitions are an example. In a broader sense our view is finitistic in that, like Hubert, we do not assume that there are infinite structures in the physical world (or, for that matter, in the mental world).24 That is, we do not assume that there are structures with infinitely many distinct parts, or that infinitely many distinct objects actually exist, or make any assumption of such a nature about physical or mental entities. Even if there were good evidence for some such hypothesis - say, that there are infinitely many stars - it is highly implausible that the truth of such</page><page sequence="26">192 LESLIE THARP an hypothesis could have any bearing on the mathematical knowledge we now have. (It might have some bearing on some future mathematics; but that is another matter.) Nor do I think the assumption of the actual existence of external abstract infinite structures is necessary or is a plausible source of explan ation. Perhaps an example will be helpful. An architect can describe quite precisely a skyscraper so tall it would crumble under its own weight if one attempted to built it. In fact he can describe quite precisely an infinitely tall skyscraper, by using a clause analogous to (x)(Ey)Sxy. He can then reason and prove theorems about the skyscraper ('There are infinitely many washrooms'). All materials which go into the de scription seem quite finite, and it is far more plausible to look to that description, than to look to infinite abstract skyscrapers, or to other infinite structures, for an explanation of the resulting theorem. Even if there were some such structures external to us - whatever that means - we would still need to describe the particular structure under consider ation. That is, it is highly implausible that we have any way of directly attaching ourselves to any such entity, so we must pick out the one we wish to discuss, distinguishing it from all of the many slightly different mathematical structures by some appropriate description. Thus we are appealing to our powers of description or our powers of meaning. We might as well stop with an appeal to those powers and not postulate unhelpful entities. Of course our powers of meaning are not arbitrary. There are con straints governing, so to speak, what we can do. Only certain concepts will give the sharpness wanted in mathematics, so our choices of con cepts are not completely arbitrary. And once we have picked the initial concepts, we have no control over the consequences. There is some sort of objectivity and great definiteness both in the original limitations of choice, and in the uncontrollable consequences. I am not sure how much explanation can be given of this kind of objectivity, and we shall make no attempt to give an explanation here. The present goals are more limited. We wish to reorient the philosophy of mathematics by advocating a kind of finitistic and mentalistic conceptualism, while avoiding misleading pictures and unhelpful theories. Perhaps it might appear that our finitistic view amounts, in some roundabout way, to nothing but a formalistic position. That, however, is not the case, since there is no reason to suppose that our concepts and their consequences can be exhaustively described by a single for</page><page sequence="27">MYTH AND MATHEMATICS 193 malism. The world may be finite, but with those finite materials we can describe infinite computations, similar to the one implicit in the consistency sentence (x)(7x-^7rx), which transcend the bounds of for mal (mechanical) decidability. The few concepts used in mathematics have a quite substantial exist ence - unlike most of the "objects" of mathematics - since the concepts can be individually presented and grasped. General problems concern ing meaning, the nature of concepts and other abstract objects, appli cations of mathematics, quasi-empirical sources of knowledge, and further issues will be considered in Part II. The present conclusion is that mathematics is based, not on reference to objects, but on a small finite number of special concepts. Those concepts are quasi-mechanical and they force certain conclusions in a quasi-mechanical way. That is the primary source of.mathematical knowledge. Perhaps these reflec tions help resolve the paradox that mathematical knowledge can be so clear and definite, while it is so difficult to say what one is talking about. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The original impetus for this work came primarily from Charles Chi hara's book Ontology and the Vicious-Circle Principle and from Paul Bernays's paper 'On Platonism in Mathematics'. I am indebted to Professor Hao Wang for much sound advice and many stimulating conversations on the philosophy of mathematics over a number of years. Thanks are also due to Professor Glen Kessler whose criticisms and questions caused a number of improvements; to Mr. Jonathan Lear for his valuable criticisms and participation in tu torials on topics related to the present work; to Mr. Phil Ehrlich for stimulating interest in, and providing references on, the development of geometry; to Professor Charles Parsons for his generous contribution of time, and for many helpful suggestions; and to a number of other students and colleagues for helpful comments and criticism. Part II has profited especially from Philip Kitcher's criticisms of an earlier draft. Stephan Korner's 1962 book, The Philosophy of Mathematics, Harper and Brothers, New York, has points of contact with the present work, especially in Chapter VIII; there are also major differences, and I shall not be able to discuss the agreements and disagreements here. The influence of Frege is manifest, but philosophically we are at right angles,</page><page sequence="28">194 LESLIE THARP since the present position is closer to an object-free intuitionism. (Be sides being virtually object-free, there is a further major difference with intuitionism: we do not insist that the propositions of all mathematical theories contain a kind of provability operator, although we admit such theories.*) In addition, a general debt to the work of Professor Saul Kripke is hereby acknowledged; I do not know, however, to what extent he would agree with the present views. NOTES * What is left, after one drops the (mentally constructed) objects and the provability operator? The mentally constructed concepts - expressed by predicates - which are actually constructed and small-finite in number (unlike, say, the ordinary numbers 0, 1, 2,...), are what is left! Note: by 'small-finite' I have in mind something like feasible finite or practically-accessible finite. 1 We have also profited from his unpublished paper 'On a G?delian Thesis Regarding the Existence of Mathematical Objects' and basically agree with his objections to G?del's Platonism. [Editors' Note: A published version of this paper - 'A G?delian Thesis Regarding Mathematical Objects: Do They Exist? and Do We Perceive Them?' - appears in The Philosophical Review XCI, pp. 211-227.] 2 The stipulations can be formalized as (x)(x = gVx = h) and (Qg&amp;Ph&amp;Mgh). From the concepts, one infers (x)(Px-^-Qx) and [(x)(y)(Mxy -^-Myx)&amp;(x)(-Mxx)]: that is, any world of the appropriate sort must satisfy the latter two formulas. It is clear that there is essentially only one world which satisfies all four formulas, and it can be represented as: Universe g h p Q M {0,1} 0 1 {1} {0} 3 The latter remark needs extended discussion since one certainly does make errors in moderately complex situations. (I am indebted to criticism of David Jales, here.) 4 Contrast G?del's statement: "But, despite their remoteness from sense experience, we do have something like a perception also of the objects of set theory, as is seen from the fact that the axioms force themselves upon us as being true". See p. 271 of his 1964 paper, 'What is Cantor's Continuum Problem?', in Benacerraf and Putnam (eds.), Philosophy of Mathematics, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. 5 A possible confusion should be pointed out. When there are stipulations, presumably a background structure has been fixed beforehand by giving an appropriate background universe and relational concepts, then &lt;/&gt; follows from the stipulations (i.e., is true-in the-story) just in case (?&gt; holds in all nonempty substructures in which the stipulations hold. (In case there are constants, they would be treated like free variables: one would demand, for all substructures and all assignments of individuals from a substructure to the constants, that if the stipulations hold for the assignment, so does (/&gt;.) An ambiguity</page><page sequence="29">MYTH AND MATHEMATICS 195 arises in the case where there are no stipulations: to say 0 follows, one might mean that, as just indicated, (/&gt; holds in all nonempty substructures of the background structure; or, one might mean, as one does in Peano arithmetic, that (/&gt; is simply true in the background structure. These cases are clearly quite different, and must be distinguished. Also note that when there are stipulations, one would not always expect that for all 4&gt;, either cf) or -(f) is true-in-the-story. (As it happens, in both our number theory story and our Hamlet story, either 0 or -&lt;/&gt; does follow, for all (?).) Finally, it is clear that the notion of holding in all substructures is analogous to ordinary first-order logical validity. The differences are roughly that in the latter notion, one retains the interpretations of the quantifiers and connectives, but disinterprets the concepts, considering all nonempty universes, and arbitrary relations over a given universe. 6 Our formulation differs slightly from the usual formulations of analysis, since we used congruence instead of identity between tallies, as seemed intuitively more natural. Within our theory one has a copy of the usual theory, by taking as the new "sets" those sets which are well-defined with respect to congruence (i.e., those z such that for all x and y, xEz and x congruent to y imply y E z). We have spoken of certain schemata of both Peano arithmetic and analysis. The reader should be warned that we consider most of the 'objects' of formal languages (such as formulas, deductions, etc.) to be fictional, and formal languages themselves to be mathematical theories very similar to certain versions of number theory. (By a formal language we shall always mean an uninterpreted syntax.) We claim neither that there are infinitely many actually existing formulas (or other objects) of a formal language, nor that there are infinitely many concepts; we only claim that if a formula exists, and expresses a concept when the primitives of the formula are interpreted in the intended manner, then the corresponding instance of the schema is true. (Within suitable mathe matical theories one could of course prove the proposition 'All instances of the schemata of number theory and analysis are true'.) 7 They are also local, and one could be completely wrong about global properties, such as compactness. 8 Proclus, who lived circa 410-485 a.d., states: "that there are lines that approach each other indefinitely but never meet seems implausible and paradoxical, yet it is nevertheless true and has been ascertained for other species of lines. May not this, then, be possible for straight lines as for those other lines? Until we have firmly demonstrated that they meet, what is said about other lines strips our imagination of its plausibility". (Proclus, A Commentary on the First Book of Euclid's Elements, in the 1970 translation with introduction and notes by Glenn R. Morrow, Princeton University Press, Princeton, p. 151.) Recall that the parallel postulate is (Proclus, p. 150): "POSTULATE V. And that, if a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the straight lines, if produced indefinitely, will meet on that side on which are the angles less than the two right angles". It appears that "strenuous efforts" had been made earlier in antiquity to demonstrate the parallel postulate, due to its lack of self-evidence: see p. 63 and Morrow's n. 64, p. 63 of Proclus. 9 Compare Bernays's remarks on the inexact nature of geometrical intuition (Bernays, p. 280). Also, note the discussion on p. 20 of Hubert and Bernays, Grundlagen der Mathematik I, Springer-Verlag, Berlin and Heidelberg, 1968: they remark, "Die hiermit sich erhebende Frage nach dem Geltungsbereich der geometrischen Axiome ist be kanntermassen sehr heikel und strittig,. ..". We are attempting to give a definite explan</page><page sequence="30">196 LESLIE THARP ation of the nature of old-fashioned geometry, that is, of what ancient geometers were really doing (which of course may be quite different from what they, or contemporary philosophers, thought they were doing). We have claimed that the concepts, although of empirical origin, were generally dissociated from their origins. This cannot be discussed in any detail, but perhaps a fair summary is given by Morrow on p. xxxix of his introduc tion to Proclus, cited in Note 8: "Mathematical reasoning in antiquity never completely lost touch with the empirical material that had stimulated its beginning, although the connection became more and more tenuous and indirect with the progress of generali zation and abstraction". The Platonic school - as represented by Proclus - assigned mathematics a definite intermediate position between the sense world and the highest level of reality. Our second claim is that in order to get a mathematical theory, geometrical concepts necessarily were developed, not as a theory quantifying over physical paths or other actual objects, but as a non-referential theory. More explanation of our notion of non referential development is given in Section 4 using modal notions. There is some similarity between our use of modalities and Euclid's original formulation: as Bernays remarks (Bernays, p. 275) Euclid speaks of figures to be constructed ("One can join two points by a straight line"), as opposed to existential assertions ("Given any two points, there exists a straight line on which both are situated"). In the same connection, it is stated in Hilbert and Bernays (p. 20), that "...die Methode der versch?rften Axiomatik, insbeson dere das existentiale Schliessen, unter Zugrundelegung eines festumgrenzten Individuen bereiches gar nicht das urspr?ngliche Verfahren der Mathematik ist". See also Morrow's introduction to Proclus, p. xxxvii, concerning the status of postulates in Euclid. A further point is that in Hilbert and Bernays (pp. 20-21) it is claimed that number theory is about certain objects, which the authors describe in some detail. While we agree with their emphasis on the intuitive and discrete nature of number theory, we deny that it can be based on objects of the sort they describe, or that it can be based on reference to objects of any sort. 10 We even survey or apprehend the number x2, assumed to be given in some standard notation. 11 See Stephen C. Kleene: 1952, Introduction to Metamathematics, D. van Nostrand, Princeton, New Jersey, p. 497. 12 Of course Gauss's conviction did not constitute a proof of consistency. Proofs came later with Riemann (1854), Beltrami (1868) and others. The establishment of strict proofs of consistency of various geometries is a complex historical matter: see pp. 138-39 and pp. 177-80 of Roberto Bonola's 1955, Non Euclidean Geometry, translated by H. S. Carslaw, Dover, New York. On Gauss, see especially pp. 64-67 of Bonola. An early work which, in effect, developed much non-Euclidean geometry was Euclides ab omni naevo vindicatus ('Euclid Cleared of all Blemishes'), by Gerolamo Saccheri (1667-1733): see Bonola, pp. 22-44, especially pp. 43-44. 13 The quotation is from a letter Gauss wrote on 17 December 1799 to the father of Janos Bolyai. Gauss's suggestions of a non-Euclidean geometry are of a hypothetical nature, since in a letter of 1804 to the elder Bolyai, he still expressed hope that the parallel postulate could be proved. See Bonola's work, cited in Note 8, pp. 65-66. On pp. 66-67, Bonola indicates that Gauss "overcame his doubts" in a second period, "after 1813". Further, in 1818 Schweikart communicated an unpublished memorandum to Gauss</page><page sequence="31">MYTH AND MATHEMATICS 197 which both asserted the existence of "an astral geometry" and briefly sketched its proper ties. Gauss replied, agreed completely, and indicated that he had developed the same geometry thoroughly (Bonola, pp. 75-77). Both Lobachevsky and Janos Bolyai developed their non-Euclidean geometries around 1823, and published their results some years later. (The geometries of Gauss, Schweikart, Lobachevsky and Bolyai were the same hyperbolic geometry unintentionally created by Saccheri a century before.) 14 Bernays discusses the fact that intuitionism deals with constructions going far beyond what can be concretely performed (pp. 280-81), and remarks, "the characteristic general feature of intuitionism is not that of being founded on pure intuition, but rather [that of being founded] on the relation of the reflecting and acting subject to the whole develop ment of science" (p. 282). The present view agrees that the concepts of intuitionism are intimately involved with the reflecting subject, but emphasizes that intuitionism is not a referential theory about actual mental constructions, being rather a theory which develops the appropriate concepts. Perhaps our notion of 'developing the concepts', discussed at length in Section 4, is an explication of "the general method of analogy, consisting in extending to inaccessible numbers the relations which we can concretely verify for acces sible numbers" (Bernays, p. 281). For a more detailed sketch of our interpretation of intuitionistic number theory, see Note 20. 15 A typical highway sign gives information - has a "sense" - but doesn't refer to an underlying object. Such examples could be multiplied endlessly, and, we claim, illustrate the predicative use of a predicate in a proposition. 16 Also, Putnam owes us an explanation of how predicates work in his view: he doesn't want them to refer to platonic objects; nor does he want them to be primarily vehicles for the expression of mentalistic senses. 17 It would be strange to say, "we can construct a golden skyscraper two miles high", and then remark, "The notion 'golden' is rather vaguer than the notion of physical possibility...". 18 This use of the expression 'we can construct...' reminds me of someone who claims he can run a mile in three minutes; and who, after the bets are placed, then announces he was using a special sense of 'can' modified by Gedankenexperimente. 19 In fact, it seems contentious to claim that there could be any actual objects falling under the concept defining the universe of old-fashioned geometry, because it appears that such concepts as hx is a point', and 'x is a line' are to be applied to infinitely small particles and infinitely narrow paths in space. In arithmetic, depending on how one selects one's universe, there may be a few (i.e., a small-finite number of) objects falling under the universe; and if there are objects falling under the chosen concept, they may be physical or mental or abstract (or perhaps some mixture of the three, or perhaps some thing in none of these categories). In set theory, as mentioned earlier in Section 3, there are certain abstract objects (such as the empty set) falling under the universe. Our views will be explained more fully in Part II. 20 We interpret intuitionistic number theory as follows, appealing heavily to A. Heyting's 1956 exposition Intuitionism, An Introduction, North-Holland, Amsterdam. The universe is the concept '* is a number mentally constructed by me'. Further explanation of what is meant may be necessary: presumably this concept holds true of numbers which have actually been constructed in one's mind in some standard way; however, in contrast to authentic intuitionists, we emphasize that in order to get the desired mathematics the</page><page sequence="32">198 LESLIE THARP obvious human physical and mental limitations must be ignored, so that most of the 'numbers' of the mathematical theory are fictional [i.e., there are only a small-finite number of these mental numbers; in general "reference to them" is a manner of speaking about the concepts]. Over this universe let us use relational concepts (expressed by predicates) for zero, identity, successor, addition and multiplication; other concepts, such as exponentiation, might also be added. Let us use the letter 'C as short for 'I have effected a mental construction of; and let us use the notations 'y', 'z' and 'xy' to stand for the sequence of free variables of a concept. Following Heyting (p. 19), we take the basic relational concepts to have the form 'C a proof of /?y' [This and what follows needs further amplification and correction; but I won't pursue it here]. As in the classical case, we regard quantifiers and connectives as operators which transform concepts into concepts, concepts with no free variables being propositions. However, the quantifiers and connectives of intuitionism differ in meaning from their classical counterparts. The intuitionistic universal quantifier (x)' transforms a concept yxy into the concept (x)'yxy, whose sense is roughly C a general method of proving, for all possible mentally constructed numbers x, "yxy'. The essential point is that the intuitionistic universal quantifier is explained in terms of mentalistic provability notions, plus another universal quantifier; that latter universal quantifier is, we claim, just the modal quantifier 'for all possible x'. Note also that one is quantifying into contexts within the scope of intensional operators. This deserves extended discussion; but let us only remark that we believe sense can be made of it, and that intuitionists do explain quantifications in such a fashion (Heyting, p. 102). Rough explanations of the other quantifier and connectives run as follows. The existen tial quantification (Ex) 'yxy means 'C a method which would in principle lead to a particular mentally constructed number x, and a proof of yxy'. The conditional yy D &lt;5z means 'C a proof which, joined to any possible proof of yy, would yield a proof of &lt;5z. The intuitionistic negation of yy is yy D 1, where 1 is some canonical absurdity. Conjunc tion means 'C two proofs, one of yy and the other of 8z. Disjunction means 'C a proof, either of yy or of 5z (and, of course, I know which)'. Finally, the intuitionistic bicon ditional is defined in the obvious manner from the intuitionistic conjunction and con ditional. Our explanations are analogous to those of Heyting (p. 19, 97-103). However, his explanation (p. 102) of the existential quantifier as "an element a. . . for which P(a) is true has actually been constructed", is quite different from ours, and is, I believe, quite implausible: the concept 'x = 67 (25772y)', is definable, even if exponentiation is not taken as a primitive, and '(Ex) '(x = (fl (25772y)' is a theorem. But surely no such number has actually been mentally constructed in any appropriate standard form. (Com pare Bernays, p. 280, for related doubts about this matter.) 21 This was pointed out by Mr. Jonathan Lear, who recommended Michael Dummett's 1973 'The Justification of Deduction', Proceedings of the British Academy. 22 It is not suggested that the language of first-order logic is the only appropriate language for classical theories, since one might introduce stronger quantifiers. In fact, in our discussion of the notion of 'finite' in number theory (Section 3), we in effect pointed out that we were using 'finite' as a primitive. One might wish to formulate an explicit treatment: let (E&lt; S0x) mean 'there could be only finitely many x\ i.e., 'it is not possible that there could be infinitely many x\ Then, using (E&lt;S0x) one could define 'x is a</page><page sequence="33">MYTH AND MATHEMATICS 199 tally' in terms of weaker concepts, dealing, e.g., with linear sequences of blocks. (Suitable analyses are straightforward, and we shall not carry any out.) We have stated that both the logical connectives and the modal quantifiers are operators which transform concepts into concepts, and clearly (E&lt; S0x) is a similar operator. We have also used the operator 'y is a set of. . .'. This operator takes a concept yx into the concept 'y is a (completely arbitrary) set of x such that yx' (x and y are distinct variables; also all concepts mentioned may contain further free variables beyond those exhibited.) I think the operator 'y is a set of...' should be regarded as a quantifier - a very natural and central quantifier. We shall use the notation (ax)yxy for this quantification of yx, which can also be expressed as y?(x:yx), for readability. This quantifier binds the x and introduces a y. Thus it does not reduce the number of free variables; but then neither does negation, and conjunction agglomerates the variables of the two concepts. The interesting difference between (ax) and (Ex) is that there is a 'type elevation'. For example, we applied (ax) to Tx to get the sets of analysis, and the sets were distinct from the tallies. (For some concepts yx such as 'x is a von Neumann ordinal' there would of course be an overlap between yx and (crx)yxy.) The quantifier (ax) can be easily defined: consider the concept 'y is a set of any kind, not necessarily of the pure iterative sort', call it V*y. Then (ax)yxy can be defined as V*y&lt;&amp;(x)(xEy^yx). Conversely, V*y can be defined as (ax)(x = x)y, or perhaps as (ax)(il/^np)y, using either identity or a fixed proposition if/. The concept V*y no doubt is quite vague, and therefore is a questionable starting point. It is better to regard (ax) as primitive, since one might wish to apply it primarily in restricted contexts, where its application would lead to a reasonably clear resulting concept. The standard quantifier (Ex) transforms given concepts into concepts of greater complexity, and of course (E&lt; S0x) and (ax), especially the latter, transform given concepts into concepts of vastly greater complexity. Starting with number theory and using (ax) and E, one can explicitly define a few layers of a version of type theory. Starting with uninterpreted predicate letters F'j(i^0. n&gt;0), F)' being the /th ?-place letter, one can develop versions of higher-order logics using (ax) and E. To apply these logics one would replace the F'j by predicates expressing concepts, replacing, say, F,1, by the predicate for the universe. (For such logics one might want also to use the quantifiers (axx . . .xn)yxx . . .xny(n ^ 2) which mean y C ([xi,. . . ,x?]: yX] . . .x?), and the relational concepts y(x,...x?) which mean [xi,. .. ,x/(] E.y.) Within second-order logic one can implicitly define large portions of set theory. We forego mathematical details, since the point we wish to make is that the quantifier (ax) is not only natural but the fundamental instrument for the construction of strong mathematical concepts. (Indeed, it might be more natural not to take (Ex) as primitive, but to define it in some appropriate way for (ax).) We cannot enter into the problems of deduction, except to remark that the primary rule of inference of (ax) seems to be the following - call it (Ra) - analogous to universal instantiation (i.e., from (x)$x infer cf)t). (Ra) is: from (y)[(o-x)yxy^&gt;... v?Ey ...] infer [(x)(&lt;f)X-^ yx) ?&gt;... &lt;j)Vi...]. That is, if the concept we have represented as... v? Ey ... holds for all sets y, y C (x: yx), then it holds for any such set defined by any concept $, no matter whether (?&gt; is actual or a fiction of a mathematical theory. Let T'y be (ax)Txy, i.e., 'y is a set of tallies'. In arithmetic the intended induction axiom states that induction holds for all sets of tallies, and is (y)[r'y^&gt;([(v1)(Zv1 ?&gt;</page><page sequence="34">200 LESLIE THARP Vi Ey)&lt;?(vi)(v2)((vi E y&amp;Sv1v2) ?&gt; v26}')] -t&gt; (vi)viEy)]. This is of the form (y)[(ax)Txy?&gt;... v?E.y...], so by the rule of inference (Ra) one infers the induction schema expressed by the language of arithmetic. The language of analysis is a first-order language using T, T', the relational concepts of arithmetic and E. The axiom schema of comprehension in analysis seems to be inferred as follows: to start with, iy)[T'y^{Ez)(v\)(v1 E z&lt;-&gt;Vx Sy)] is a valid formula of first-order logic; T'y is (0-x)7xy, hence by (Ra) one infers (x)((px?&gt; Tx)^&gt;(Ez)(v\)(vi Ez&lt;h&gt;0Vi), the axiom schema of comprehension, where &lt;f&gt; is any concept, actual or fictional, expressed by the language of analysis. Note that in both arithmetic and analysis the rule of inference (Ra) is used at the very beginning, to infer a bundle of first-order axioms from propositions using the quantifier (ax). One then uses first-order logic to carry out subsequent deductions. From the present finitistic view, infinitistic languages are on a rather different level from the quantifiers we have considered. We deny that infinitely many distinct formulas exist (see Note 4), and, a fortiori, we deny that one could assemble such an infinite set of formulas in one's mind. Of course one might grasp a rule for certain such sets. One typically does grasp such a rule in substitutional quantification, and the schemata of arithmetic and analysis provide examples of perspicuous rules. Obviously, in suitable mathematical theories one can develop substitutional quantification and other infinitistic constructions in great generality. But we feel that for the most part such mathematical theories are neither here nor there philosophically. For example, the full induction schema of arithmetic, construed mathematically as holding for all possible arithmetical formulas, does not reflect our actual practice: we attach more philosophical significance to humanly graspable concepts expressed by predicates which actually exist in the course of time; not all possible formulas of arithmetic would express graspable predicates (e.g., if the formula, which might be described in some roundabout way, were too complicated), and not all graspable predicates are expressible in arithmetic (e.g., 'x is a truth of arithmetic'). Moreover, this full induction schema of arithmetic does not reflect the intended induction axiom to start with, which holds for all possible sets, not merely those expressed by formulas of arithmetic. (For an illuminating deflation of various aspects of substitutional quantification see Brian Skyrms's unpublished 'Cheap Thrills: Comments on Substitutional Quantifications as a Philosophical Touchstone'.) Certain kinds of quantifiers were considered in my paper, 'Which Logic is the Right Logic?', Synthese 31, 1-21 which treats logics within a realistic set theoretical framework. My attitudes have since changed in various ways, but nonetheless let me take this opportunity to correct some (of the possibly many) confusing slips in the paper just cited: in the examples on line 5 and on the last line of page 14, it is tacitly assumed that the universes of the models in question are enumerated as w-sequences - otherwise one would not be assured that each finite submodel is reached in finitely many steps; in the last paragraph of page 14, the argument switches too abruptly to epistemological considerations; Frege's name should have been included on line 5 of page 19; on line 4 of page 21 (note 17) the procedure for examining finite submodels will have an ordinal length greater than a&gt; in case M is uncountable; in both notes 9 (p. 20) and 18 (p. 21) the references should be to 'Note 16', not 'Note 17'. 23. See Benacerraf, p. 661 and pp. 666-67. We do not suggest that such a theory would necessarily be mathematically interesting, since we are concerned with humanly graspable concepts. Also, one might want one's truth theory to encompass propositions which use</page><page sequence="35">MYTH AND MATHEMATICS 201 modalities in more complex ways than we have considered. However, we wish to defer discussion of the question which naturally arises: Can all, or many other, uses of modali ties be explained within the conceptualistic framework we have advocated for mathemat ics? 24Hilbert's views have further subtleties because he interprets such propositions in a special way: e.g., the statement of the irrationality of V2 is taken to mean "that it is impossible to find two numerals ? and b satisfying the relation ?2 = 2b2". Since "a formalized proof, like a numeral, is a concrete and surveyable object", consistency propositions are similarly taken to mean that one cannot exhibit a formalized proof of a contradiction. (See page 383 of David Hubert's 1967, 'On the Infinite', translated by Stefan Bauer-Mengelberg, in From Frege to G?del, Jean van Heijenoort (ed.), Harvard University Press, Cambridge.) Taken literally, a system might have this property due to the mental or physical impossibility of exhibiting the required concrete proof, yet still be inconsistent in the usual sense of the word. I am not claiming that such an occurrence would necessarily be disastrous. For example, let 2 be some set theory whose truth is accepted, and suppose 0 is a theorem of X , but all proofs are so inaccessible that none will ever be discovered; suppose further that we will never even have any evidence for the truth of ?. Then the theory S U {-6} is literally inconsistent. But X U {-?} not only provides all the theorems of X, it never leads to implausible consequences: for to find an implausible consequence of 2 U {-?} is to find evidence for ? , which we assumed will not happen. As far as I can see, the existence of such an ? is quite plausible, and the inconsistent theory X U {-0} would serve exactly as well as does X. In any case, Hilbert seems to embrace the possibility we have been considering: "If no such proof [of a contradiction] can be presented to me, all the better; I am spared the trouble of having to react". See p. 481 of van Heijenoort, and the editor's surrounding discussion (pp. 480-82) which introduces Weyl's paper 'Comments on Hubert's Second Lecture on the Foundations of Mathematics', translated by Stefan Bauer-Mengelberg and Dagfinn F?llesdal (pp. 482-84).
