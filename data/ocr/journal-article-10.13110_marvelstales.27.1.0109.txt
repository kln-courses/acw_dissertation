William Cottrell and David Hand),  New York Times film critic Frank S. Nugent hailed the film as “significant cin- ematically as D. W. Griffith’s Birth of a Nation” (“One Touch of Disney” 5).   Indeed, for a picture that was labeled “Disney’s folly” because of the costs the  studio had to defend, Disney’s version of the fairy tale of the lost princess and  seven little men became the highest grossing film of 1938, earning more than  $5 million in the first year of its release (Nugent, “This Disney Whirl” 5).   Disney was awarded a special Oscar for Snow White in 1938, a true testament  to its high level of popularity and critical acclaim. Disney’s connection to the fairy-tale world is now well established, with  the studio receiving similar levels of acclaim for their productions of Cinderella  (1950, dir. Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson, and Hamilton Luske), The Little  Mermaid (1989, dir. John Clements and Ron Musker), Beauty and the Beast  (1991, dir. Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise), and their latest installment,   Tangled (2010, dir. Nathan Greno and Byron Howard), a loose retelling of the  Grimms’ version of “Rapunzel.” However, despite its many accolades, scholars  have struggled with Disney’s adaptation of classical fairy tales. Because of the seemingly innocent nature of Disney animation and its  subsequent association with childhood through fairy tales and because of   Disney’s prominent position within the paradigm of popular culture, scholars  have identified Disney films as somehow worthy of special treatment. In their  analytical work From Mouse to Mermaid, Elizabeth Bell, Lynda Haas, and Laura  Sells highlight the challenges faced by those wanting to engage in analysis of  Marvels &amp; Tales: Journal of Fairy-Tale Studies, Vol. 27, No. 1 (2013), pp. 109–124.

They argue that “legal institutions, film theorists, cultural critics  and loyal audiences all guard the borders of Disney film as ‘off limits’ to critical  enterprise” (3). Steven Watts identifies this tension as a conflict between popu- larity and critical reception. He argues that “Disney’s enormous popularity has  contributed to dismissal in critical circles. Commercial success has been  viewed in inverse proportion to cultural significance” (84). The problem with  Disney seems to be the paradoxical underlying notion that populist sentiment  cannot be viewed in unison with cultural importance. as such, many of the  current works on Disney are deductive in nature, analyzing any Disney ani- mated production in exclusive, not inclusive, terms. However, the tide seems to be turning in favor of constructive scholarship  on Disney. Eleanor Byrne and Martin McQuillan’s recent analysis of the later  animated productions of Disney introduces a new notion for animation  scholars to consider. They argue, “We must not just ask questions about  Disney, we must ask questions about the questions we ask about Disney” (3).  as our society changes sociologically, economically, and politically, the terms  of critical engagement with these texts must also necessarily change. Douglas Brode was one of the first Disney scholars to examine Disney  animation in a positive light and to take these terms of engagement into con- sideration. In his work From Walt to Woodstock: How Disney Created the   Counterculture, Brode highlights an illuminating fact. The evolution of ide- ology in Disney animation in the 1930s and 1940s was crucial to the forma- tion of a radicalized value system that played a key part in the youth revolution  of the 1960s (Brode, Walt 6). The importance of Brode’s scholarship lies in  recognizing the underlying importance of the values transmitted through  Disney animation and their far-reaching consequences. In his later work   Multiculturalism and the Mouse: Race and Sex in Disney Entertainment Brode puts  the live-action and animated films of Disney under analysis and argues how  these features and shorts actually helped to foster tolerance of diversity in  american society. Brode underscores the social consequences of the ideologies  relayed through animation within Disney’s narrative frameworks. Walt Disney’s productions are now being seen as crucial to the construction  of modern american society through his contribution to the formation of a new  United States nationalism. Nicholas Sammond’s recent work is exceptional, as he  connects Disney productions to the formation of a new american childhood. He  argues that “Disney was represented as an interceding between an ideal past and  an unrealized ideal future, distilling the best impulses of that past into a digest- ible form that would reappear as the present corrected in that future” (366). Disney animation is integral to the formation of american character, not  just in the past but for the future. Walt Disney’s personal contribution to  110 MT_27.1_06.indd   110 19/03/13   2:09 PM </page> <page sequence="3"> “WITH a SMILE aND a SONG . . .”  animation is now recognized as both ideologically and historically significant.  Because of his own personal history and attraction to the world of fantasy and  make-believe, Disney used several vehicles to relay his ideology. However, one  of the first tools he used was the fairy tale. Jack Zipes, one of Disney’s staunchest critics, charges that Disney “cast a  spell” over the classical fairy tale, capitalizing on american naïveté to infuse  his viewers with false hope (74). Zipes intimates that Disney radicalized and  americanized the European fairy tales, casting his own ideology onto the  screen and losing the meaning and value system attached to the “original”  tale. Similarly, Richard Shickel’s treatise, The Disney Version, condemns   Disney’s translation of the modern fairy tale, describing the ideology he trans- mitted as “appealing to the worst aspects of middle class conservative values”  (Shortsleeve 2). In their critiques of Disney, scholars such as Zipes implicitly suggest that  each fairy tale, including Snow White, is a singular narrative inherently  belonging to the folk; this leads to the conclusion that certain types of retell- ings deviate from the values of the supposed original tale tellers. However, in  this essay I take as a premise that there are no “original” values inherent in  these fairy tales, because they stem from a long-standing oral and literary tradi- tion in which tales have been retold and rewritten and hence constantly trans- formed over time. Each retelling or rewriting of a fairy tale thus has its own  specific historical frame of reference. Justyna Deszcz observes that Zipes has  little problem with viewing the fairy tale as a preservation system for the cul- tural heritage of any given country but that one cannot apply this to the Disney  versions, which are similar reflections of their own period of production (85).  Rudolf Schenda’s work on the cultural significance of fairy tales seems illumi- nating. Schenda argues that fairy tales are “neither timeless nor ahistorical but  rather incorporate local color and reference to social conditions” (80). Far from Frances Clark Sayers’s accusation that “Disney misplaces vio- lence with sweetness” in fairy tales, resulting in the creation of a soap opera  “not really related to the great truths of life” (606), in this essay I argue that  Walt Disney’s Snow White indeed directly engages the culture and ideology of  its own time. Michael Shull and David Wilt recently made the case for Disney’s  animation to be used as a historical source and analyzed it as such to draw  conclusions about the period of the 1930s and the national mood (4). Here,  I draw on the new sociohistorical frameworks of Disney animation outlined by  scholars such as Brode and Sammond and argue that Disney transformed the  fairy tale of Snow White to relay new ideas about the american Dream of suc- cess to the american people. Through its transformed narrative, Snow White  infuses hope and positivity into a society struggling with the Depression. In  111 MT_27.1_06.indd   111 19/03/13   2:09 PM </page> <page sequence="4"> TRaCEy MOLLET turn, the success and overwhelming popularity of Snow White raise new   questions about the power of Disney animation in the formation of prevailing  national myths about america, the nature of its people, and their character. Disney and the Culture of Depression When the Wall Street crash hit america on October 24, 1929, it brought with  it an immeasurable depth of economic, social, and cultural turmoil. Five thou- sand banks failed in 1930, taking with them $7 billion in deposits. One hun- dred fifty thousand homeowners lost their properties in 1930, with the number  escalating substantially to 250,000 in 1932. Thirteen million americans were  out of work by 1933 (Kennedy 163). although Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New  Deal attempted to rejuvenate a despairing society, america experienced an  unprecedented cultural dislocation. During the 1920s, american industry  prospered, experiencing an economic boom while the war-torn countries of  Europe struggled to cope with the increasing demands on their economies. Warren Susman, in his theoretical study into the roots of american ide- ology, identifies the culture of the 1920s as one of abundance, leading to the  material formation of the american Dream. He argues that “more attention  could be paid to gratification of personal needs of all kinds” (179). Focus was  on material wealth and possessions. Precedence was given to the success of the  individual over that of the community, and no work was more important than  that done in the pursuit of wealth. The american myth of success was given  material backing; people believed in the dream. With the arrival of the Great  Depression, this cultural myth came crashing down on the people of america.  With the formation of Fascist dictatorships and the consolidation of Stalin’s  regime in the Soviet Union, the very facets of american society became  unstable. The values of equality and democracy came under attack. The people  of the United States looked for answers. Nothing was more influential for pro- viding these answers than the movies. Robert Sklar, among others, has made the case for the cultural power of  the movies in this period (400). During the darkest days of the Depression,  movie attendance still averaged 60–75 million people per week, proving both  the power and popularity of the cinema. arthur Schlesinger even commented  that “movies in the 1930s were near to the operative center of the nation’s  consciousness” (qtd. in Cripps 115). Movies offered a new look at what society  had become in the 1930s. Film historians have recognized the importance of  the fantasy film in the 1930s. People sought deliverance from their black and  white lives, filled with unemployment, hunger, and despair, hoping for escape  into a colorful utopia. Most clearly this is demonstrated by the success of  112 MT_27.1_06.indd   112 19/03/13   2:09 PM </page> <page sequence="5"> “WITH a SMILE aND a SONG . . .” Mervyn LeRoy’s Wizard of Oz (1939), with Dorothy dreaming of her   “somewhere over the rainbow” land free from troubles and despair. However,  this escapism can be demonstrated more specifically through the fantastical  power of Disney’s animation. Despite the undeniable fanciful world of Disney’s shorts, it would be a  grave mistake to associate people’s attachment to the Disney brand as nothing  more than a desire for escapism. as andrew Bergman argues, one cannot  escape to a place one does not identify with (xiii). Lewis Jacobs, in his contem- porary study of the rise of the american film, highlights the cultural power of  Disney’s animation (500). The Silly Symphony Three Little Pigs (1933, dir. Burt  Gillett), released at the low point of the Depression, in the midst of Roosevelt’s  Hundred Days, struck an emotional chord with the populace. It carried a mes- sage of sticking together, emphatic after Roosevelt’s famous appeal to the  american people. Furthermore, the short’s famous song, “Who’s afraid of the  Big Bad Wolf,” written by Frank Churchill, became a rallying cry for the battle  of the public with the Depression. Disney made light of the threat and empha- sized the importance of persistence and community spirit to triumph over the  evils of the Wolf. The Three Little Pigs promised success to the hardworking  and honest among americans. Furthermore, Disney went to great lengths to  ensure that each little pig had his own personality, reflecting the ever-changing  nature of american society. Using the power of animation, Disney was able to  tap into the spirit of the times and reconnect with the idealism of the american  Dream of success and prosperity, lost along the highway of the Depression. as  Watts argues, from the dislocation of the Great Depression to the traumas of  World War II, Walt Disney unknowingly helped america redefine its cultural  values (109). These cultural values were reaffirmed and further strengthened  through Disney’s first animated feature: Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Disney chose Snow White for his first full-length animated feature long  before the picture made it to the screen. His enthusiasm for the story can be  traced as far back as 1915, when he watched a silent version of Snow White,  starring Marguerite Clark, in Kansas City and fell in love with the tale of the  princess and the seven little men. although Disney developed several fairy-tale  productions in Kansas with his then partner Ub Iwerks, including Little Red  Riding Hood and Cinderella, he recognized that Snow White had all the ingredi- ents he would need for success in animation: an appealing heroine, a fright- ening villainess, and the dwarfs to reiterate the comedy and character of his  endearing Three Little Pigs. What was more, the story of Snow White seemed to  illuminate the spirit of the 1930s like no other. Disney felt drawn to fairy tales  and the ideal of a “happily ever after” through the struggles he had undergone  in his own life. 113 MT_27.1_06.indd   113 19/03/13   2:09 PM </page> <page sequence="6"> TRaCEy MOLLET Trapped under the pressures of a tyrannical father during his childhood,  it seems no coincidence that Disney would be drawn to the idealism of happy  endings inherent in fairy tales. and in a historical and economic climate that  looked to the promise of better days, Snow White was the ideal story through  which Disney could relay his own hopes and dreams and appeal to the   american public at large. Not So Grimm: Disney’s Snow White The best-selling nonfiction book of the 1930s, How to Win Friends and Influence  People by Dale Carnegie, highlighted the significance of values, behavior, and  lifestyles in the culture of the 1930s. No longer was importance placed on  material goods and wealth; success had to come from the inside. Disney’s Snow  White was the personification of this new spirit. Unlike the princess in the  Grimm version of the tale, Snow White gains the sympathy of the audience by  being cast in the Cinderella mold of every american individual. Disney trans- formed her into the leading role in the rags to riches story of the american  Dream. at the beginning of Disney’s story, we see Snow White dressed in rags,  scrubbing the floor of the castle, owned by her Stepmother, the queen.  although we are reminded that Snow White remains the young princess by  birthright, she is treated as a slave in the castle she calls home. But Snow White does not achieve her happiness through the business  acumen and cunning individualism that one would associate with a 1920s  success story. She is kind, good, and placid and awaits the coming of her  prince with patience and virtue. Snow White’s acceptance of her situation  recalls the mentality of the american people during the Depression. as noted  by a psychiatrist in Studs Terkel’s oral history of the Depression, there was a  sense that people accepted the situation and remained quiet (80). However,  Disney kept the dream of success alive through Snow White’s ability to dream.  She sings of her wish to find the one she loves and for him to take her away  from her current plight. The prince appears, and the two sing together of the  joys of finding their love. The american people were saved by Roosevelt’s New Deal. The Federal  Emergency Relief administration was charged in May 1933 with dispensing  $500 million of federal relief money. Other agencies, such as the Civil Works  administration, provided jobs for the unemployed and managed to put  4.2 million men and women back to work (Kennedy 134). Despite the success of his many agencies, Roosevelt was concerned with  the extent to which people came to rely on the government for their recovery.  Recovery would have to come not from the state but from the people  114 MT_27.1_06.indd   114 19/03/13   2:09 PM </page> <page sequence="7"> “WITH a SMILE aND a SONG . . .”  themselves. This idea of change having to grow out of the attitude of the  people plays itself out in different ways in Snow White. For instance, Snow  White is rescued from execution by the Huntsman but is unable to return to  the kingdom for fear of certain death. She is sent out into the world with no  food, no water, and no place to live, a similar plight affecting millions of  people across america. She is left with only her character to make her way in  the world. The sweetness of her values and the goodness of her nature  become ever more important in providing the tools to her eventual “happily  ever after.” Character takes precedence over all, and Snow White never gives up  hope; her dream of success in finding love and happiness remains alive. Even  when she meets the dwarfs, she still sings of the day when her prince will  come. Disney also emphasizes the importance of true love in society, with the  ultimate goal of marriage and procreation. at the beginning of the Depression,  facing an uncertain future, young people were postponing their plans to marry  and have children. There were 15 percent fewer children per household in  1933 than in 1929 (Kennedy 165). Snow White’s union and eventual marriage  to the prince is placed at the center of Disney’s retelling, infusing society with  hope and optimism for its own “happily ever after.” Snow White’s preparation  for motherhood is also prominent in Disney’s retelling, through the way in  which she cares for the dwarfs while staying with them. One of the most remarkable social features of the Depression is the extent  to which the american public appeared to blame themselves for their plight  and to take personal responsibility for their economic failure. Being unem- ployed appears to have been experienced more often as a weapon of humilia- tion and a matter of personal fault rather than the failure of an economic  system (Terkel 340). Roosevelt tackled the burden felt by the public in his  inaugural address, stating that the only thing the american public had to fear  was “fear itself” (Houck 1). This is also addressed and corrected within the  narrative of Disney’s Snow White. When faced with the frightening trees that  turn into monsters and the vicious river logs that turn into crocodiles, Snow  White is terrified. But when the woodland creatures are revealed to be sweet  and good, Snow White sighs, “you don’t know what I’ve been through. and all  because I was afraid. I’m so ashamed of the fuss I’ve made.” Snow White’s character overcomes the fear addressed by Roosevelt and is  able to find herself somewhere to live, achieve temporary happiness with the  dwarfs, and ultimately prosper. Similar to trivializing the Depression through  music in The Three Little Pigs, Disney makes light of the despair of the   Depression through Snow White’s patient, self-reliant, and sincere character,  keeping the hope alive within americans that if they remain positive and     115 MT_27.1_06.indd   115 19/03/13   2:09 PM </page> <page sequence="8"> TRaCEy MOLLET hardworking, good will triumph over evil and they will be released from the  suffering of their everyday lives. Whereas in the Grimm version of the tale Snow White’s dreaming does  not power the plot, her character appears much less important than in the  Disney retelling, where the heroine filters the fears and aspirations of the  common american during the Depression. In 1930s america the only thing  that could ensure Snow White’s success, in the absence of material wealth, was  the triumph of her spirit and love for the prince over the wicked witch. Who’s Afraid of the Big Bad Witch? The Characterization of the  Wicked Queen When conceptualizing the role of the Wicked Queen, Walt Disney insisted  that Snow White be based on Janet Gaynor, the Prince on Douglas Fairbanks  Jr., and the Wicked Queen on a mixture of Lady Macbeth and the Big Bad  Wolf (Thomas 130). Indeed, Disney’s Wicked Queen shares considerable  traits with both models in her ambitious drive to be the fairest one of all and in  her voracious pursuit of Snow White. Unlike Snow White, who exemplifies  the 1930s values of decency and idealism, the Wicked Queen places impor- tance on superficiality, greed, and individual ambition, the main components  of 1920s ideology that many held responsible for the Wall Street crash. Indeed,  the jealousy that drives the story in the Grimm version takes visual shape in  the film, through both the commentary of the Magic Mirror and the mirror’s  green tint when the Queen addresses her own beauty. already economically  exploited by the Wicked Queen in the film, Snow White is also viciously pur- sued for her beauty by her stepmother, who wishes to inherit the grand title of  “the fairest one of them all.” Disney accentuates the difference between the  Queen and Snow White further by representing the princess as the scullery  maid in the Queen’s castle. The Queen thus not only desires to be the fairest  one of all but also covets Snow White’s wealth as a princess, ensuring that she  is also the richest one of all. In addition, no one else conspires even passively in the Queen’s cunning  plan to kill Snow White. The father who remains alive but essentially absent in  his inability to protect his daughter in the Grimm version is completely elimi- nated from the film. as such, the betrayal of the parental figure is not at issue  in the Disney version. Snow White’s father is dead and cannot protect her. By  eliminating the figure of the passive father, the film highlights the wickedness  of the Queen above all else in the story, casting her as the scapegoat for all that  happens to the princess. Furthermore, the Queen, as the personification of the  values of the previous generation, most notably in her embodiment of an East  Coast aristocratic persona associated with the crash, is the ultimate villainess  116 MT_27.1_06.indd   116 19/03/13   2:09 PM </page> <page sequence="9"> “WITH a SMILE aND a SONG . . .” for a 1930s audience. In her greed, heartless ambition, and aristocratic  demeanor she recalls the negative representation of robber barons of the  Gilded age. Snow White, however, seems reminiscent of a “Middle american”  disposition, making her more accessible as a heroine for the 1930s audience  (Inge 134). The Grimm version of the tale foregrounds family jealousy and  drama, whereas in Disney the oppression of the poorer Middle american Snow  White at the hands of the materialistic aristocrat is emphasized. The social  aspect of their relationship takes precedence over their familial animosity. Furthermore, in the Disney version the Queen, as the hag, is run off the  cliff while trying to dislodge a stone to destroy the seven dwarfs. The death is  accidental; the character is not subjected to any humiliation. In the Grimm  version of the tale the Queen is made to dance in red hot shoes at Snow White’s  wedding; the emphasis again falls on the bitterness at the core of the Queen’s  jealousy. However, with Disney’s version there is simply a karmic sense to the  end of the story, and the emphasis is placed on Snow White’s romantic resolu- tion with the prince, as opposed to the needless jealousy of the Queen. Old  selfish values (i.e., individual greed and ambition) are not placed at the center  of the story, whereas happiness and the evolution of the american Dream of  success and social advancement take priority in the form of collective action.  The dwarfs fight together for Snow White’s honor, heightening the sense of  social drama as opposed to personal vengeance. The Queen’s selfish individu- alism is struck by the force of lightning, showing its natural supersession by  collective action, which proves to be the ultimate victor in Disney’s tale. The Little Heroes: The Seven Dwarfs and the Common   American Man Grumpy, Doc, Sleepy, Sneezy, Dopey, Bashful, and Happy are now all indel- ibly associated with the Snow White story. Disney’s famous biographer, Bob  Thomas, states that it took Disney many years to come up with the final names  for his dwarfs (Thomas 117). Part of the reasoning behind Disney’s decision to  characterize the dwarfs was largely the success of The Three Little Pigs. Each of  the little pigs involved in the plot to take down the Big Bad Wolf had different  characteristics, all of them relatable to the common american man. In the same vein, although the dwarfs have different reactions to Snow  White’s stay at the cottage because of their diverse personalities, they are all  able to move from caution to respect when her identity and good nature are  revealed. Even Grumpy, the most reluctant of the dwarfs to accept Snow  White, eventually embraces her romantic idealism and values. at first, he  grunts about the “wicked wiles” of women, representative of an older genera- tion of men, not accepting of the new liberation of women that had taken  117 MT_27.1_06.indd   117 19/03/13   2:09 PM </page> <page sequence="10"> TRaCEy MOLLET place in society throughout the 1920s and 1930s. This was especially evident  in the medium of the movies and through society with the rise of the suffrag- ette movement, the right to vote granted to women in 1913, and women’s role  in the workforce during the 1920s and 1930s. However, Grumpy is among the  first to fight for her life after her encounter with the witch and the poisonous  apple. But Disney’s seven dwarfs have even further appeal than just their wide- ranging personalities. The dwarfs represent the common man of america. Before the Wall Street crash, President Hoover commissioned a study of  U.S. life to form the basis for larger national policies. Titled “Recent Social  Trends,” one of the study’s many aims was to try to identify the life and times  of the common american man. This man was described as isolationist, raised  in the country but recently moved to the city, and living a more prosperous  life than either of his parents. The affluence of the urban worker was very real  at the end of the 1920s; the workers enjoyed a good wage, modern commodi- ties, and a high standard of living. This wealth disappeared with the arrival of  the Depression, and thus this definition of the “common” american man dis- appeared. Gone was his association with success, opulence, and individu- alism. The Depression created a new “common” american man through the  shared experience of poverty and unemployment. all men of society, from the  Grumpys to the Happys, had to work together to bring about a new pros- perity in america. This emphasis on collective action is at the heart of the   ideology found throughout Disney’s Snow White and was the cornerstone of  one of Roosevelt’s biggest projects in the New Deal: the Works Progress   administration (WPa). The two key personalities in the formation of this  agency, Roosevelt’s senior adviser Harry Hopkins and journalist Lorena  Hickok, conducted interviews in 1933 that provided the information R oosevelt  needed to put people back to. The WPa employed more than 3 million  workers in its first year, and in the eight years of its life put 8.5 million people  back to work (Kennedy 252). Snow White’s dwarfs exemplify the community spirit roused by  Roosevelt’s  New Deal. They recognize neither wealth nor prosperity in what they do,  reflected by their work song “Heigh Ho,” in which they merrily sing, “We dig  up diamonds by the score / a thousand rubies, sometimes more / and we don’t  know what we dig em for / We dig dig dig a dig dig.” yet despite their lack of  material motivation, the dwarfs are meticulous, productive, and thorough in  what they do, and they arrive and leave work on time, and without grumbling. Walt Disney also tapped into the social culture of the 1930s by elevating  the humble dwarfs to the position of heroes in the story, which is another  deviation from the Grimm version. In the Grimms’ “Snow White,” the h eroine’s  release from the wicked spell of the Queen is almost accidental. In the Disney  118 MT_27.1_06.indd   118 19/03/13   2:09 PM </page> <page sequence="11"> “WITH a SMILE aND a SONG . . .” version it is the dwarfs who try to protect Snow White and chase the old hag  up the mountain where she meets her death. It is the little heroes that triumph  in the story. Charles Hearn’s study of the american Dream during the   Depression emphasizes the significance of this idea in 1930s society. In the  absence of riches and affluence, it seemed more important than ever that  the ordinary man could still become extraordinary through his acts, as opposed  to through his wealth (113). Despite digging diamonds for a living, the dwarfs  lead humble ordinary lives. It is only through their meeting with Snow White  and their adoption of her optimistic attitude that they become heroes, uniting  to fight against evil in their world. Rural Idealism: Escape to the Dwarfs’ Cottage Despite the widespread industrialization of the 1920s, the extent to which  america was completely urbanized during this period has often been exagger- ated. Forty-four percent of the population was still classed as rural in the 1930s,  and half of the states still remained rural in their populations and ways of life.  These areas did not experience the economic boom to be found in the cities  during the 1920s. Through the results of technological innovation, a wide- spread agricultural depression took hold in the countryside years before the  events of October 1929. Only 16 percent of farm households earned incomes  above the national median of $1,500 per year. Their plight simply worsened  throughout the 1930s. Income fell from $6 billion to $2 billion (Kennedy 192).  What was more, because the main impact of the crash seemed to be felt in the  economic sphere of the modern cities, it was this new technical “city” that was  largely seen to be responsible for the living struggle facing most americans  (Ekirch 117). as a result, Roosevelt sought to elevate the status of the rural areas  to ensure that the third of the nation that had lived in poverty before the   Depression was taken care of. David M. Kennedy has gone so far as to argue  that no other area of society was as “tenderly coddled” under the New Deal as  the agricultural sector (Kennedy 202). New Dealers believed that the farmers  held the key to recovery, and through the formation of the  agricultural   adjustment act, Roosevelt formed the groundwork for a system of farm subsi- dies, making the agricultural sector a high-interest area of society. The Rural  Electrification administration brought cheap power to the countryside, mostly  by midwifing the emergence of hundreds of nonprofit, publicly owned elec- trical cooperatives. after the energy poured into the agricultural economy,  people started fleeing from the city to the country for the first time in a decade.  an underlying nostalgia developed for rural society. after its great failings,  much of the  american public rejected the metropolis, expressing  sentimentality  119 MT_27.1_06.indd   119 19/03/13   2:09 PM </page> <page sequence="12"> TRaCEy MOLLET for the  simplicity of a life on the land. This is reflected in Pare Lorentz’s   documentary films of the period and is further expressed in Disney’s Snow White. as Kevin Shortsleeve illuminates, many Disney films reject the cityscape,  embracing a simple, pastoral vision. The plans for a pastoral sentimental  utopia are underlined throughout Disney’s history, including his plans for the  theme park Epcot Center and the Magic Kingdom Park. Snow White’s safe  haven is an idyllic small cottage, self-sufficient, with its own river and shelter  under a canopy of trees. In Snow White Disney’s escape to the simplicity of  rural life even goes so far as to encompass the wildlife of rural “society” through  the anthropomorphic transformation of rabbits, deer, birds, and squirrels into  Snow White’s companions in her darkest hour. She finds comfort in nature  and immediately becomes perfectly attuned to the rural way of life. Indeed, this yearning for what Bergman has called a Jeffersonian return to  the land was a tradition throughout many 1930s films; for example, Our Daily  Bread (1934) follows a group of workers who form a commune with the ulti- mate goal of producing their own bread (93). The rural setting of the dwarfs’  cottage in the source, the Grimms’ fairy tale, does not seem relevant to note, as  it was a direct reflection of the European geography from whence it came.  However, in 1930s america, when the city’s banks failed the nation, the coun- tryside’s prominence in the film, further emphasized by Snow White embracing  rural life, is of particular interest. although the dwarfs’ labor is not necessarily  rural and is suggestive of industrialization in the mindless work they perform,  as emphasized in their work song, it is nevertheless tied to the land and situ- ated in nature. The film idealizes the simplicity of their idyllic rural cottage,  and it is here that the dwarfs’ find contentment. However, Disney’s Snow White did not just make the case for a return to a  life on the land. Despite Roosevelt’s heavy investment in agriculture, the  economy could not and would not move backward. Industry would eventually  recover from its heavy losses. On the contrary, it could be argued that Snow  White represents a lost culture, lost values, and a loss of the simple life that  american society would never be able to recapture. Rural idealism in the  1930s, particularly in the context of a fairy story, ultimately proved to be just  that: an ideal and utopian vision that could never and would never be attained. “With a smile and a song . . .”: New Values through New Media Through his retelling of Snow White Disney was able to capture the spirit of the  1930s in another way: by utilizing the best of contemporary technology to  infuse his film with the modernism of its period of production. The first of  these technologies was the way in which Snow White used sound to tell its  120 MT_27.1_06.indd   120 19/03/13   2:09 PM </page> <page sequence="13"> “WITH a SMILE aND a SONG . . .” story. When Warner Brothers released The Jazz Singer in 1927, the cinematic  landscape was changed forever. Dialogue gave new depth to plots, and music  built tension and created sentiment at pivotal story points. Lewis Jacobs’s con- temporary study of film in the 1930s singles out Walt Disney as one of the  most resourceful producers of the time, using music to enhance dialogue.  Disney was one of the first to use song to tell his stories. Music had been used  previously, for example, in Gold Diggers of 1933; musical numbers accentuated  the film’s sense of fun and community. With the success of “Who’s afraid of the Big Bad Wolf,” written by Frank  Churchill, Disney had found a new way to tap into the spirit of a culture, using  song to unite his audience around a common goal. Whereas in The Three Little  Pigs this goal involves collectively defeating the wolf, in Snow White song pro- vides release from a dreary reality, a use of song we also see in such films as The  Wizard of Oz (“Somewhere Over the Rainbow”) and Disney’s Pinocchio (Jiminy  Cricket’s “When you Wish Upon a Star”). “Whistle While you Work” provides  an example of a different use of song to a collective end. Echoing the commu- nity spirit inherent in Roosevelt’s public works programs, the work song is  pivotal to Snow White and would have spoken to many american spectators in  its representation of collective work, whether we consider the dwarfs digging in  the mine or Snow White cleaning up the cottage with the help of the animals. Furthermore, perhaps the most illuminating of Disney’s songs is a small  interlude that Snow White sings to the animals after her ordeal with the  Huntsman. She asks the birds of the forest what they do when things go wrong  and, after hearing their sweet call, exclaims that they sing a song. She croons,  “With a smile and a song / Life is just like a bright shiny day / your cares fade  away / and your heart is young.” This song exemplifies the tale’s appeal to the simple life, to kindness and  patience, and overall to success for the future if a positive attitude is main- tained. The song puts into words the spirit of optimism and hope the  american  people had to keep in their hearts in order to prosper. This spirit was absent in  the 1920s, but the emphasis on good nature and good will abided in the 1930s  and was personified in the character of Snow White. The message is relayed to  the american audiences by the sound of her voice. It cannot be denied that  this extra dimension of cultural significance derives significantly from the  Grimm version of the tale. However, Disney was using a different medium,  and this medium offered endless possibilities to connect with his own  “readers.” In the same ways that the Grimm brothers used traditions from their  own society to connect with their audience, Disney used a focal point in 1930s  culture, the tradition of musical film, to rally americans to the cause of his  fairy tale. 121 MT_27.1_06.indd   121 19/03/13   2:09 PM </page> <page sequence="14"> TRaCEy MOLLET Disney was the first in Hollywood to use Technicolor in his animation,  gaining an exclusive contract until 1935. although this innovation did not  debut with Snow White but with the short Flowers and Trees in 1932 (dir. Burt  Gillett), Disney’s insistence on perfection with his first feature led to further  developments in the technology in his studio. Disney used the multiplane  camera for Snow White to add extra depth to the animation, increasing its sense  of realism for the audience. In the Depression landscape of america, which  images and documentary record and in which movies were largely in black  and white, the use of color in Disney’s fairy tale added life and character to the  story, making it a more poignant and utopian representation of america in the  1930s than many movies of the time. The bright colors of Disney’s animation  reflect the optimism of the story and hence ultimately the story’s underlying  ideology. Disney, Fairy Tales, and National Myths Unlike some of the more sinister of the Grimm fairy tales, Hans Christian  andersen’s Little Mermaid, and to a certain extent Madame Leprince de   Beaumont’s Beauty and the Beast, all of Disney’s fairy tales weave into their  plots elements that contribute to the reformation of the american Dream: the  heroine always dreams of some relief from her current setting, whether it be to  a new life on the land, life beyond her provincial town, or a time “once upon a  dream” when her prince will save her. The princess is always good, kind, and  beautiful and more often than not lives in a rural setting with special connec- tions to animals. These animals are often her protectors and help her through  her plight at some point during Disney’s retelling. She can always sing of her  fears, hopes, and dreams. She is often optimistic but never presumptuous.  and Disney fairy tales always end in a “happily ever after” for the good and in  death or banishment for the bad. In this way Disney fairy tales are not all that different in their moral under- tones from their literary predecessors. yet they are cast aside as americanized  and saccharine, carrying no real relation to everyday life, unlike their counter- parts. In this essay I argue to the contrary. In Disney’s first retelling of the tra- ditional fairy tale Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, he draws on the heart of the  culture of 1930s america. His heroine, like americans of the time, suffering  under the strain of poverty, economic oppression, and hunger, dreams about  a better time but recognizes this can come about only through positivity and  goodness, not through any selfish desire for material gain. The dwarfs work  hard, embrace Snow White’s values, and are able to prosper as the heroes of  the story. By using the rags to riches story, elevating the little hero,  accentuating  122 MT_27.1_06.indd   122 19/03/13   2:09 PM </page> <page sequence="15"> “WITH a SMILE aND a SONG . . .” romance and love, and punishing the greedy, individualistic, and ambitious  witch, Disney reignites the american dream, reinvigorating one of america’s  most poignant national myths that many believed had been lost by the crash of  the late 1920s. Disney’s version of the tale brings new merits to the idea of the  american Dream. Material wealth is no longer important for success in D isney’s  tale; the emphasis instead is on inner values and manners and on collective  action for the sake of a better world for all. although it is tempting to dismiss the power of Disney’s animation,  because of its childlike caricatures and undoubted appeal to the youth of  society, Disney himself dismissed the idea that his films were made exclusively  for children (Davidson 545). What is more, by 1939, 85 million americans  visited the cinema per week, and Snow White made more money than any  other film in 1938. The film’s popularity cannot be ignored, nor should its  critical acclaim. americans dreamed of deliverance from their plight, and   Disney’s animation provided an answer. It was idealistic, utopian, and undeni- ably impossible in their economic climate, but the hope infused within society  through the film’s underlying ideology prevailed. Robert Sklar argues that  Walt Disney held the power to shape the nation’s myths and dreams (400).  Using this power, he drew on the commercial and cultural climate of the  1930s to transform the gray depressed landscape of america into a colorful  “happily ever after,” preempting his extensive involvement in shaping national  myths through animation during World War II.
