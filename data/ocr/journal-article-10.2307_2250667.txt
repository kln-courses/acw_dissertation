<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Philosophy of Ernst Cassirer (Library of Living Philosophers, Vol. VI). Edited by PAUL ARTHUR SCHILPP. The Library of Living Philosophers Inc., Evanston, Ill., 1949. Pp. xviii ? 936. $ 6.00. THIS latest addition to the Library of Living Philosophers had been planned and many of the contributions to it compLeted at the time of Professor Cassirer's sudden death in 1945. The editor and his advisers nevertheless decided, surely justifiably, to go forward with its publication, and instead of the philosopher's reply to criticisms and comments, which has been a feature of most of the other volumes of the series, they have placed at the end a specially translated version of an essay of Cassirer's " Geist und Leben in der Philosophie der Gegenwart " (first published in Die Neue Rundschau in 1930). The volume consists of twenty-three essays on various aspects of Cassirer's work, written mainly by contributors in the United States, many of them, like Cassirer himself, representatives of pre-Nazi German philosophy in dispersion. I shall not be able to comment on all these contributions, and since Cassirer's work is not widely known in this country, I think the best plan in this notice is to describe certain of its main features, and some of the questions to which it gives rise. I shall refer to some of the essays in so far as they bear on these questions; neglect of the others should not be taken to mean lack of interest. Ernst Cassirer built up his reputation as a product of the Marburg School of neo-Kantians. At the turn of the century he was a student of the great men of the school, Cohen and Natorp (particularly of Cohen). He spent most of his professional life at the universities of Berlin and Hamburg. As a Jew and a strong liberal philosopher, he saw that the Nazi regime would make his work impossible, and resigned in 1933 immediately after Hitler became Chancellor of the Reich. After two years in Oxford and six in Sweden (at Goteborg), he went to the United States in 1941, where he taught first at Yale and then in New York until his death in 1945. He had the omnis- cience of the older type of German professor of philosophy; but, unlike some of that breed, such of his books as I have read give the impression of grace of style and ability to carry his great learning lightly. Moreover he was interested in the things which many of us to-day who lack his vast background want to be interested in: the study of different types of languages (based on an encyclopedic knowledge of the literature of comparative philology, psychology and anthropology), and the philosophy of science, particularly on its mathematical side. As a neo-Kantian, he believed that forms of human thinking make possible the structure of significant ex- perience. But unlike Kant and the older neo-Kantians, he held 256</page><page sequence="2">D. EMMET: The Philosophy of Ernst Cassirer 257 that there are not only forms of scientific thinking, but also of mythical thinking, historical thinking, and everyday language, and that these followed different but recognisable patterns. He sought evidence of this in a study of language as a depository of forms of expression, turning the Kantian notion of a Critique of Pure Reason into a " Critique of Language ". He insisted that his theory of the different types of " symbolic fotm " was based not on. speculation 'but on the results gathered from the work of philologists, psycho- logists and anthropologists. But it is impossible not to wonder whether his Kantian-idealist belief that each particular " symbolic form " must have its own a priori structure does not affect his pre- sentation of the material. This is so, for instance, in the long dis- cussion of the unitary structure of " mythical thinking " in the Philosophie der symbolischen Formen. One would like to know what working anthropologists have to say about this thesis (which is maintained by others besides Cassirer). Here the work of anthro- pologists, in providing inductive evidence and not only illustrations, is surely crucial. Unfortunately the essay on " Anthropological Thought " by Mr. David Bidney in the present volume is concerned mainly with " philosophical anthropology ", i.e., theories of man in his cultural setting, and not with empirical anthropology. Mr. Bidney does, however, conclude with an interesting discussion of the relation between Cassirer's views of mythical thinking and those of Le6vy-Bruhl and Malinowski. Mr. Ashley Montagu, in discussing " Cassirer and Mythological Thinking " comes up 'to the question of whether there is a unitary mythical view of the world, but seems to base belief in a unified form of mythical consciousness on a view of the developing unity of " the spirit ", that is on idealist rather than on empirical considerations. The problem is really whether you can take the Kantian principle of the a priori and anthropologise it, and at the same time maintain that there must be a -unity of structure in symbolic forms. Mrs. Suzanne K. Langer (whose own very interesting book, Philosophy in a New Key, seems to owe a good deal to Cassirer) in an essay on " Cassirer's Theory of Language and Myth " goes so far as to say that " His emphasis on the constitutive character of symbolic renderings in the making of 'experience' is the masterstroke that turns the purely speculative 'critical' theory into an anthropological hypothesis, a key to several linguistic problems, a source of psychological understanding, and a guidepost in the maze of Geistesgeschichte " (p. 393). It is obviously important to know what is meant here by " symbolic renderings ". Cassirer said that he was considering man not as the rational animal, but as the " symbolising " animal. Unfortunately he never quite sufficiently explains what he means by, the crucial term " symbolic form "; he uses it sometimes to mean anything which can be interpreted as meaningful, sometimes to mean the broad types of interpreted experience (art, religion, science, etc.) which make up a culture, 17</page><page sequence="3">258 CRITICAL NOTICES: sometimes to mean a priori constitutive conditions of objectivity (Kantian categories, with a wider linguistic basis). Mr. Carl Hamburg's essay is the best attempt to clear up these different, though related meanings. Mr. Hartman's essay on the subject of " Symbolic Forms " is more eulogistic than helpful over this, and overworks the simile of Rodin's figures " awakening from the stone" to describe the " self-emergence " of forms of consciousness. In general, we may say that by a symbolic form Cassirer means anything which provides a context within which it is meaningful to talk of an object. His argument that there can be no pure datum presented as an object without interpretative ideas follows familiar lines. He allows, indeed, an intuitive sensuous content to symbols at their first stage. But this can only be " objectified " through language. The originality of his view lies in the way in which he describes some of the main forms of human experience as consti- tuting different principles of objectification. But if we ask " Are there non-linguistic controls, not internal to the symbolic form itself, by which we can judge its validity ? " we run into difficulties. On the whole Cassirer's view appears to be that the symbol must be thought of as an " operator " and not a " designator ". As language develops, its " representative " function is increasingly subordinated to the function of " pure meaning ", and this " symbolic " stage is the stage to which scientific knowledge is tending. A pure symbolic form in the scientific sense becomes a law de- fining a functional relation which makes possible its own development. In his book on Substance and Function Cassirer argued that this is the meaning of a mathematical concept. " Every mathematical function represents a universal law which by virtue of the successive values which the variable can assume, contains within itself all the particular cases for which it holds " (Substance and Function, Eng. trans., p. 21). Cassirer's relational, as opposed to the class, theory of number is commended by Dr. Felix Kaufmann in his essay in the present volume (cf. p. 199 if.). It is criticised constructively by Mr. Harold Smart in an essay which seems to this reviewer (who can only judge from far off) to be an extremely able contribution to the philosophy of mathematics. In any case, whatever the merits or demerits of Cassirer's theory of mathematical concepts, these con- cepts obviously provide him with a model for knowledge in general. The sciences become more scientific as they tend nearer to the mathematical model. But I find very great difficulties in seeing how Cassirer can give an adequate account of empirical science in terms of his key notions of " form " and " function-" (in the mathe- matical, not the biological sense of these terms). It is true that he can point to the development of physics to show that certain scientific concepts must be given a functional as distinct from a realistic interpretation, rather on the lines of Bridgman's operational theory in The Logic of Modern Physics. It is also true, as Dr. Felix Kaufmann says, that " each new stage in scientific progress</page><page sequence="4">D. EMMET: The Philosophy of Ernst Cassirer 259 is characterised by a specific type of, 'objectification ', by the creation of new scientific objects, represented in the symbols of the language of science " (p. 198). But if the progress of science is described purely in terms of the internal development of its symbols, we have on our hands all the hoary problems of the " synthetic a priori ". My own impression is that Cassirer, like Hegel.before him, can only so describe it by smuggling in a good deal of empirical material under the cover of a dialectical development. But what- ever we think of Cassirer's view of the a priori, there is no doubt that the enormous range of knowledge from which he draws his illustrations could supply a number of themes for students of linguistic symbolisms. No contributor expressly discusses the relation of Cassirer's theory of " languages " to recent syntactical and semantic theories, though Dr. Carl Hamburg and Dr. Felix Kaufmann have a few remarks indicating comparisons with some of the views of Charles W. Morris and the later Carnap. Outside the present volume Cassirer's Determinismus und Indeterminismus in der mrodernen Physik was discussed favourably by Ph. Frank in his book Between Physics and Philosophy. There is one fairly obvious question to which I have not been able to find an unambiguous answer in such of Cassirer's works as I have read, and even after reading all the essays in this volume. Does Cassirer think of each symbolic form as going through an internal development from the " mythical " to the purely " symbolic " stage ? Or are mythical and scientific thinking to be thought of as two completely autonomous forms ? There are passages in which he maintains the autonomy, we might say the independent rights, of the mythical along with other forms of expression, e.g., " Every form is, so to speak, assigned a special plane within which it operates and in which it unfolds, with complete independence, its own specific individuality" (Philosophie der symbolischen Formen, Vol. I, p. 29). In this way there are a plurality of forms, held together not by a logical or dialectical relation, but by the general human function of expressiveness, so that a group of them together form a " culture ". On the other hand, he holds there are certain basic categories such as Space, Time, Number, Causality which are present in a qualitative and anthropomorphic form at the mythical level, and which have to become depersonalised into purely func- tional relations at the scientific level, which is the " symbolic " level par excellence. In this sense there can be an internal develop- ment from the mythical level within each form; for instance Cassirer describes the development of the science of astronomy out of the mythical thinking of astrology. And he also suggests that myth can be developed to its " symbolic " stage in religion, but he does not, as far as I know, say very much about this. I am not sure in the end what the status he gives to myth really is. Ile considers and rejects the views of myth as primitive science (Frazer) ,</page><page sequence="5">260 CRITICAL NOTICES: as savage philosophy (Tylor); and as growing out of ambiguities of language which the primitive mind does not understand (Max Muller and Spencer). He comes nearer to saying with Freud that myth is the symbolism of the emotional life; -but he does not accept Freud's particular interpretation. His own view is that myth is a symbolic form which expresses a way of conceiving the world in terms of certain deep-seated feelings and valuations. I get the impression that Cassirer looked on mythical thinking with a kind of Olympian benevolent toleration, as an interesting element in culture providing material for linguistic studies, and was prepared to defend its rights as an autonomous form of expression until at the end of his life (witness the posthumous Myth of the State) he was awakened to the fact that it might also have sinister possibilities. But only partly awakened: the trouble, he thought, about the Nazi myths such as " the Myth of the Twentieth Century " is that they were not products of spontaneous imagination, but manufac- tured by cunning men for political purposes. He does not seem to have felt the need to supplement his general view that myth is primarily expressive so as to give more weight to other more prag- matic factors in its creation. But he raises the surely immensely important question of what is the proper significance of the various forms of primitivism in our thinking. I think that there is great merit in Cassirer's insistence that a fundamental, if not the fundamental, human function is to find ways of expressing experience symbolically, and he is right to fasten on the sense of exhilaration we feel when we have achieved an expressive form. (This is brought out by Mr. Folke Leander, the only Swedish contributor to the volume.) " The function of language ", says Cassirer, " is not to copy reality but to symbolise it ". Yes, indeed; but the difficulty is to estimate what place he allows to extra-linguistic controls in the development of his symbolic forms, in so far as they claim to be cognitive. Here he is criticised from the standpoint of traditional realism by W. C. Swabey (the translator of his Substanzbegriff und Funktionsbegriff) and from the standpoint of Phenomenology by Dr. Fritz Kaufmann (not to be confused with Felix Kaufmann, the author of Methodology of the Social Sciences, to whose essay in this volume I have already referred.) I should like to read a further criticism from the standpoint of an empirical philosopher of science, who at the same time was able to appreciate the functional and non-realistic use of certain basic scientific concepts. There are surely cases in which empirical dis- coveries can lead an investigator to conclusions which he would not have reached by the development of his deductive system of opera- tive ideas,.even if we include in these the principles of empirical procedure, for the question is not only what these principles enable him to deduce, but what they enable him to discover. Professor W. M. Urban has an interesting essay on Cassirer's Philosophy of Language, at the end of which he leads up to the question whether</page><page sequence="6">D. EMMET: The Philosophy of Ernst Cassirer 261 the problem of truth can be reduced to that of the internal develop- ment of forms of expression. In his own view of truth as " the sum total of meaningful discourse " (where i" meaningful " is internal intelligibility) he comes very near to Cassirer. But one would like to see Cassirer's views discussed by someon'. wiho was also an experimentalist. DOROTHY EMMET.</page></plain_text>
