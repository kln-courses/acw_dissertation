<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Buddha Image in Sculptural Arts of India K. Padmanabha In the early phases of Buddhist art at Barhüt, Sānchi, Bodh Gayá, Amarā- vati, and Nãgãijunkonda the Buddha is represented aniconically. By a strict convention, in a complete abstention from protrayal, the Buddha was represented in the early sculptures symbolically. The worship of the symbol was an act of ritual, a reverence to a higher person, the next and inevitable step was to substitute a sensitive protrayal of the supra human being for the severity of an abstraction, and the Buddha image was born. The earliest surviving image of the Bodhi Sattva appears to be the headless torso from Sārnath which Bachhofer dates earlier than A.D. 78. Still there is an earlier headless standing image of the Buddha from Lauriyan Tangai (now in the Indian Museum, Calcutta) with an inscrip- tion dated A.D. 6.1 As these images do not seem to represent the earliest formulation of the -icon, the earlier images of the Bodhi Sattva or the Buddha must have been made about the end of the pre-Christian era. The uncertain chronology on the date of Kaņishka, the beginning of the Gandhāra School cannot be definitely placed before A.D. 50. The texts like Brahmajala Suita, Samyutta Nikaya, Majjhima Nikãya, Divyãvadãna, and Avadûnakalpalata clearly indicate that Buddhism tended towards a cult worship of the Buddha, as early as in the middle of the first century B.C. But we cannot document this date precisely with reference to any definite canonical texts which, unfortunately, all belong to a much later period, but the sanskrit text Tathāgata-Prativimba-Pratisthānusamsa of 1st century A.D. and translated into Chinese under the title of F o Shwo-tso-fo-hin-sian - kin ( Sütra spoken by Buddha on making, the Buddha images) is of great importance in this context. On the basis of the Chinese translation of the text, recommending the making of the images of the Buddha, it can be inferred logically that the worship of the image of the Buddha was an established cult in India sometime before A.D. 25, that is about the end of the first century B.C.2 When the necessity arose, of initiating the worship of the image of the Buddha, the formulations of the icon do not appear to have based their conception on the realistic portrait described in the Rudräyana legend (Divyä Vadâna). They devised an idealized figure, characterized by the marks of physiognomical pecularities of a super human being, which had been ascribed to the former Buddhas. The earliest of these elements for the iconography of a super human type is enumerated with reference to Vipassi, a former Buddha in the</page><page sequence="2">94 THE TIBET JOURNAL Mahãpadãna Suttanta ? These pecularities are better predicted generally, with reference to all the Buddhas, as types of Mahâpurusa (Superman) in the Lakkhaņa Suttãnta .4 Besdies, the iconographer of the Buddha image had before him the plastic models of a series of Yaksa images (occuring in early Indian Schools of the second and first century B.C.), which made the basis of formulating and developing the iconic conception of the Buddha. Thus, the earliest images of the Mathura School can easily be deduced from the type of Yaksa statues and the figures of the 'Regents of the Four Quarters/ which occur at Barhūt, Sáñchi and Nāsik. Coomaraswamy5 has skilfully demonstrated how the element of the later anthropomorphic iconography were already present in early Indian art, and in view of the canonical prescription from the type in early canonical literature, there was no room for introducing any features from the Hellinistic sources. A series of standing images of the Mathura School amply demonstrates the iconographie, and stylistic continuity of an earlier indigenous type adopted to the new necessitities of Buddhist worship. Once the image of the Buddha was evolved on the patterns of earlier Indian plastic proto- types, a codified canon for the sculptor was laid down which survives in various versions of the texts on image making (Btiddha-Pratimã-Laksana). When the artists in the Ãndhra Desa were called upon to give the representation of the Buddha, they naturally followed the models of the Mathura School but soon evolved a focal type with distinguishing pecu- larities. As in the early centres of Buddhist art in the north, the image of the Buddha does not figure in the earliest phase of Buddhist sculpture in the south. The Buddha images were of three main types - sthanaka (standing), asana (seated), and sayana (recumbent). These were positioned as focal subjects - in composite reliefs from the life of the Master or of the Jataka tales, in a grouping of figures accessory to the narrative. The reclining pose, however, was exclusively used to represent the Mahāparinivāņa or the Great Decease. Paradoxically, the image of the Buddha was the deceptive reflex of a true reality, which by the philosophy of the faith, is a void, beyond all human attributes and predictions; "all ideas are nothing, as bearing upon him (sutta nipāta );" all concepts of the Buddha are non-real, merely transitory aids to his apprehension in each living being. The Mahãyãna doctrine harnessed the aid, that is the image, while asserting non-duality of nirvāna; the Absolute and the transitory world of Sarhsāra; and the devotion of the large masses of laity; yearning for a compas- sionate redeemer, a focus for purificatory sacrifices and offering called for a cult icon, personifying the transcendental Buddha.6 But the image had to be an authentic archetype, historically valid and authoritative; shorn of legend, that such a one was developed and</page><page sequence="3">BUDDHA IMAGE: SCULPTURAL ARTS 95 proliferated without a doubt; Hiuen Tsang carried with him a replica of the archetype to China for broadcasting its copies, and the Japanese monk, Chonen, during his sojourn in China, had a facsimile made which he too.k with him to Japan in 987. Today this copy stands in the Sariyoji temple near Kyoto, and some copies found their way to central Asia. The replicas were not of equal quality, but what mattered v/as their Indian origin, sanctified by its essence and the duplicates, passing through diverse intermediate stages, were modified by the ethnic features of the country being influenced; the image was adopted for local acceptance by an indigenisation of its features.7 AMARÄVATI At Amarāvati, the development of the Buddha image v/as parallel to that of Gandhāra and Mathura but independent of them; while their coale- scent image were manifestly modelled on the ancient native type of atheletic yaksa figures, in their compactness, bursting vigour, and tightness in glyptic treatment, the Amarāvati Buddha, if slightly affined to Ma- thura's type is more refined and sensitive, informed by a regal sublimity in its human features, a Chakravartin in the dress of a monk, a benevolent great teacher, essentially one with those heredeemed by his overwhelming compassion; stylistically, the long robe falls gently in symmetrically placed folds, modelled by the body it drapes, leaving a shoulder bare, the hands positioned in symbolic gestures. It was this type, in its serene monu- mentality that influenced the countries of South-East Asia, where the Hînayâna doctrine took root. The Amarāvati Buddha developed, under the inspiration of Nāgārjuna, from simple haloed images seated in Sattva paryanka ūsana in dhyäna - mudra (towards the end of the second century) to a Bodhi Sattva, as a youthful prince amidst his women asleep, or riding from Kapilavastu, occasionally with his left hand on his thigh and the right in abhaya-mudra. The seated, with both legs pendant (present at Nāgārjunakoņda) does not appear at Amarāvati. Indeed the images of Buddha have inner grace and repose. The squarish face reveals graceful and rounded contours. The standing Buddha at Amarāvati was its own creation, original in con- ception and natural with an uncovered right shoulder and the saúghãti drawn to the left of the body in a hearty swag at the bottom hem. This became for many centuries the type for the colonial stüpas and bronzes of Amarāvati. NÄRGÄRJUNKONPA At Nāgārjunakoņda, we find the Buddha represented in a human form along with the symbols which clearly indicates the transitional phase of Buddhism. The impact of Gandhāra art is evident in the form of the</page><page sequence="4">96 THE TIBET JOURNAL Buddha and the Bodhi Sattva figures at Nāgārjunakoņda. Here, we have representations of the Buddha, standing or seated, with the saúghãti covering either both the shoulder; keeping the right one exposed.8 In one instance Buddha is shown seated on a raised chair with his feet resting on a pädapttha, exactly in the same manner seen in Gandhāra and Mathura. In this posture the impact of the Gandhāra trend is also unmistakable in the manner of treatment of the regulated hanging folds of the drapery, the fully rounded face, lips, and half-open eyes. The ushņīsha of the Buddha depicted in the above referred sculpture is no other than that of Gandhāra. Besides, the broad shoulders and general heaviness of the proportions are clearly of Mathura tradition.9 MATHURA The greatest contribution of the Mathura art was the cult image which synchronised with the introduction of the image of the Buddha. There emerged the image stela with supreme importance given to the central divinity attended by subsidiary figures as determined by iconographie formulations. The devine image was fashioned in the form of the familiar yak$a primitive. The ealiest Buddha figure called Bodhi Sattva out of deference to the old scruples against the human representation of the great Teacher, was fashioned in the form of the colossal yak$a, and was likewise characterised by massive burlines and earth-bound volume. The known early images of the Buddha, including some dated in year 2 and year 3 of Kaņiskha, were all executed in the likeness of the primitive yakças and stand with their buly massive form firmly planted on the pedestal, with their right-hand raised shoulder high in the abhaya-mudra and the clenched left hand kept on the waist holding the gathered ends of the saúghãti. The entire gesture and the features, including the broad shoulders and the sturdy masculine torso, were suggestive of physical strength and energy. Thus, the early Buddha image expressed only the mundane or physical aspect as that of a world conqueror; the open eyes and the smiling countenance never suggested any spiritual introspection. In the course of time the early massive form became more relaxed, and grew supple with a gliding linear contour, as expressed through both standing and seated Buddha images which underwent gradual icono- graphie and artistic refinement But despite these developments the Kuçána Buddha figures remained earthbound with no suggestion of supra-physical existence.10 GANDHĀRA The greatest contribution to the Indian art resulting from the union of Hellenistic genius and Buddhist piety is the figure of Buddha. It was the Hellenistic artist of Gandhāra, familiar with the comprehensive pantheon</page><page sequence="5">BUDDHA IMAGE: SCULPTURAL ARTS 97 of Greek art, who first portrayed the Master. The Buddha image was the creation of the Greeco-Buddhist artists; took its origin in Gandhāra and later became the source of inspiration to the artists of Central Asia and the Far East.11 The Buddha figure is undoubtedly, a triumph of Asian art, through unmistakably, it reveals the impress of the imperial Roman styles, especially in regards to the draperies. The Gandhāra Buddha plasticaly belonged to an extraneous and hybrid art tradition, which followed the Indian tradition only in regard to icono- graphy. The Mathura Buddha lacked spiritual expression, so did the Gandhāra one. But the former based on indigenous standards, plastically and iconographically expressed as an Indian conception which was true to Indian ideals, both psychologically and culturally.12 Another notable contribution of the Gandhāra school to Indian art was the figure of Bodhi Sattva. The artist worked these figures in stone, stucco, terracotta and clay. GUPTA The Gupta art was indeed a classical art marked by refinement or ele- gance, simplicity of expression and a dominant spiritual purpose. The artist had now achieved mastery of technique and dealt with individual figures, as well as complicated myths and narrative legends with equal care and confidence. This art was characterised by a sensitively modelled and rarified body form, and a serenity of expression which marked the figures of gods predominatly. The sensitivity and luminosity of this art were best illustrated by the Buddha images. The preaching Buddha from Sārnath with its spiritual expression, tranquil smile, and serene con- templative mood truly represents the highest triumph of Indian art.13 Notes 1. O.C.
