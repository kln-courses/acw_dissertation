When handled in a certain way, it folds, fissures, warps, bends like flesh does. —K.G. Subramanyam Contemporary Indian Artist Shantiniketan The Earth possesses a sanctity in India, invoked not only in hymns from the Vedas, the Bhumi Sukhtam, in legends from the Puranas, in songs and festive celebrations of the adivasis, but as much in indigenous forms created out of clay. Forms that do not change but seem to be born out of the substratum of memory—in a stream of consciousness that flows from one artisan to another, from one century to the next. Saraladevi, a frail old woman, her beady eyes sharp as a bird, sits in the open air of the Crafts Museum. She has brought her own stock of clay from Goalpara in Assam, and she moulds a figurine, attaching pellets for the eyes, the lips, the breasts, the braided hair. She could not possibly know that she is creating the Earth Mother, identical in proportions and details and the enigmatic bird-face to those excavated from Mohenjodaro, Harappa, Kalibangan— fashioned perhaps four thousand years ago and miraculously preserved. Once in a while, as a curious piece of anachronism, she might place the Earth Mother riding a bicycle—bringing us back to the twentieth century!</page><page sequence="3">Vetari Dakkinis—witches riding horses created in unbaked clay by the priest to heal patients.

In rural and tribal India it is used to store water, grain, oil, rice, as an indispensable item of the household; to preserve milk, butter and curds in cool clay closets shaped into the anthropomorphic image of Krishna—the original butter thief; to decorate the walls; to adorn the body in patterns tatooed all over the face and arms, at festivals such as the spring saturanalia of Holi. Clay images of animals are made and offered to the gods, and also to the ancestors: for protection; at the time of harvest; at the time of marriage; in quest of a child; for purposes of healing an afflicted part of the human body; to drive out evil spirits which are wafted away on to raw images of the dakkinis. At the time of death finally, ghumats, 'homes' of baked clay are created to house images of the deceased. Clay enacts, then, the full cycle of our lives: from birth and procreation through the stages of life to death where, as in the symbol of Sita whose name means the furrow, she is returned to her mother, the Earth. Mortals, like forms in clay, are perishable. Ramanbhai, the potter whom we visit in Vasna village, Gujarat, welcomes us into the spacious compound of his home. On this morning he and his two brothers are 'chasing' the pots which were made on the wheel the previous day. It is a fascinating technique: thumping and shaping the pot with a wooden ladle (falaldu) from the outside, and smoothing it from inside with a stone anvil (bhanko). Stretched and perfected in shape, the pots are placed in an ash pit in rows, to keep them cool and dry, protected from the wind and sun under a thatched roof. As the midday sun climbs higher into the sky and the wind picks up momentum, Ramanbhai's wife moves the unfinished pots into a verandah and covers them with gunnysack. Silhouetted against the sun, she kneads with her feet dancing upon the earth from the fields and the village pond, transforming it into moist clay, mixing the earth with sawdust—to make the pots porous. Her sons, back from school, demonstrate how the clay is first shaped into a lingam and then thrown and centred on the potter's wheel. Ramanbhai then takes over in mid-afternoon, sitting on his haunches and moulding new pots on the moving wheel. The old grandfather moves around the compound with a stick, inspecting a fine pair of bullocks, the hay and dung to be used for firing the pots, and the ready pots drying in the sun.</page><page sequence="5">132 / HAKU SHAH AND GEET! SEN The entire rhythm of the potter's day and of the months is attuned and in harmony with the Elements (Panchabhuta). The moulding of every new pot brings him in contact with the earth, the sun, the wind and space, water and fire. No wonder then that in every village the Kumbhar, the humble potter, is called Prajapati, Lord of the People, an apellation for the sun—for both are creators! Sometimes the potter is called Visvakarma, Creator of the Universe. Ramanbhai reminiscences about the auspicious use of these pots in the marriage ceremony. A large pot pierced with holes and aglow with the light of a lamp (diva) is brought and it is said that Lord Ganesha has come to inaugurate, as he does, the beginning of every ceremony. The bride and groom are then seated, surrounded on all four sides (chori) with seven pots balanced one upon another. In the presence of these pots the rituals begin.... As he works, the potter muses on the creation and disinte gration of pots, and of life itself. He communicates this in a brief, crisp sentence: Maati me se aye aur maati me jana he. (We) have come from earth, and to earth we must return. Maati means clay; but it also means man or flesh, thus establishing a primordial bond between the two. In Gujarat if a child is born without a limb, it is said that God must have lacked that much clay. When a woman is childless, it is rumoured that God must have run short of one and a quarter seers of clay. Myths of creation all over the world render the notion of mortals being fashioned out of clay. In China it was said that man was made out of clay; woman was the water that moulded the clay into form and purpose. The Koran (32: 6-9) exalts the act of creation of the Almighty. He is the Mighty one, the Merciful, Who excelled in the making of all things. He first created man from clay, then bred His offspring from a drop of paltry fluid. He moulded him and breathed into him of His Spirit</page><page sequence="6">Maati: Born from the Earth / 133 In the traditional mode of worship in India it is believed that Prana, the vital breath that animates, is breathed into clay, transforming it at that moment from a mere object into living form. Traditional images are created out of clay of the goddess Durga, Gauri, Mallama, Ganesha, and they are believed by their worshippers to come alive. They are invoked on festive occasions such as Durgapuja, Gauri Vrata, Ganesha Chaturthi. And when the spirit departs from them, they are returned once more to the earth and water from whence they came. Among the tribals in India this essential link between man and the earth is deeply ingrained into their sensibility, their perception of themselves and their rituals. The Oraon myth of creation has already been related by Virginius Xaxa. Among the Chodhri tribe in Gujarat, Limji, the priest from Kanjod village, Surat district, narrates another primeval legend of the beginnings of the world: The gods were once tilling the fields on earth and kept coming across stumps of trees. Crops had been sown on the tilled areas but a lot of waste grass remained to be cleared. The gods were wondering how to do this... They decided to create human beings from raw clay, and breathed life unto them with auspicious words whispered in their ears. These men started clearing and tilling the fields. . . . While they were about it, the gods also created cows, tigers and other animals.2 This belief of bringing the image of "life" is nurtured as much and ritually enacted by the adivasis of Gujarat: the Bhils, the Rath was, the Garasias, the Chodhris and other tribes who comprise five million— a substantial 14 per cent of the State's population. Their offerings of terracotta images to the gods are placed in sanctuaries that are almost inaccessible: deep into the forest, on a high hill as to Tubraj Dev or Goli Gadh Mata. Sometimes the images are clustered in thousands, sometimes they sit out alone in a field. . . In the Sabarkantha district of Poshina, literally hundreds of votive horses are assembled under the shadow of an ancient gnarled banyan tree. The earlier votive offerings are never removed; they lie broken, returned to the earth, while new horses are offered each year in accordance with strict rituals.</page><page sequence="7">Dev-dobdi: god's gourd played by Chodhri musician at the time of offering terracottas or at installing the spirit of dead in the ghumat</page><page sequence="8">Maati: Born from the Earth / 135 From the house of the potter the adivasis may walk for miles, for more than a day, into the interiors to reach the god's sanctuary "which is always in a removed place with a mystical atmosphere. There are no idols there but a dark cave-like place near which the tigers live. The gods' and the tigers' abodes are always side by side, so tribal people say."3 Great care is taken to carry the terracotta images, because a figure to be offered cannot be broken or damaged in any way. Food, wine, rice, flowers, flags, coins, coconuts, lamps, incense, chickens, and goats are also taken along for the offering. On a long journey, the adivasis might camp at night under the stars. Chanting continues through the night, beginning with an invocation to the earth mother: Today, earth, cosmos, Today the hot earth The earth has been tied by roots and webs. The Rohini star has made way for the sun to rise. Today Mother Earth we worship you. Please accept our worship and give us your spiritual power, your honour.4 To the vibrant sounds of a gourd instrument, the dev dovdi, the adivasis sing and dance in unison. They weave their way uphill, flags fluttering, to the ceremonial ground where the offerings to the deity are to be made, and animals sacrificed according to the vows taken. The head of the sacrificial animal is placed on the terracotta image and then taken away,'and blood is smeared on the terracotta. With the combined fervour of the devotees they believe the terracotta comes alive and at the end of the ritual the God accepts it with affection. The trance, dance and feast follows. The priest installs a flag on top of a tree and throws down rice to people below who collect it and put it in a clay storage jar. With the blessings of God the tribals believe that their crops will be bountiful. Rituals vary from region to region and from community to community. But the ultimate goal is the same, the devotion to the God. When they offer these terracottas they utter the words, Oh!</page><page sequence="9">Offerings of rice, alcohol and terracotta horse to tribal god Photo creeift: Haku Shah</page><page sequence="10">Maati: Born from the Earth / 137 Devlimadi, Goddess Devli, I offer the horse to you. From today, I rely on your assurance that you will do good to us. May your good wishes prevail, may our generations grow!5 Ritual offerings of terracotta are made at innumerable stages through the year's cycle. They are placed in remote sanctuaries, in the local village replica of the god's abode, and in the fields, at every stage of the harvest: when maize is planted, when grain is separated from chaff, when it is winnowed and when it is harvested.6 When a family has a first-born son, a horse is offered to the deity. When a son is desired, an elephant is offered on the thirteenth day of Diwali, Dhanteras.7 At the time of sickness, offerings are made to Devlimadi, Goli Gadh Mata and many forms of the Mother Goddess. Vows may be taken by the tribals on a great number of different occasions. If the cows or buffaloes do not yield milk, if the crops are infested with pests, if the fields do not yield a good harvest, images in baked clay offer the solution. An old farmer vowed that if insects were removed from his fields and if his grandson were cured of infantile paralysis, he would give a feast for unmarried girls to appease the Mother Goddess, and he would offer her a clay horse. Among all images offered, the horse is paramount in importance—although it hardly plays any role in the life of the Gujarat farmer or the adivasi. The horse is the archetypal image of sacrifice, as adumbrated in the Vedas. At first man, Purusha, was offered as the first sacrificial victim; but this was replaced by the Ashva-medha when the horse was sacrificed. Horses are offered to propitiate the gods who are believed to ride these horses at night. So they protect the village, ensuring safety. Akhadodev is a sanctuary in the forest where the adivasis perform navai, the offering of new horses tor the good of the village. The ancestors too, are to be remembered and propitiated. A Rathwa boy may walk for miles to "visit" his father, whose image in wood stands alone guarding the fields, and who is now offered lamps, incense, food and a terracotta horse. Tubraj is the name of a hill in a thickly forested region near the borders of Gujarat and Rajasthan. The tribals revere this hill so much that they name their god after it. On the second day after Diwali the Bhil Garasias, the Dungri Garasias and Sokla Garasias</page><page sequence="11">Procession by the Bhil Garasias up to the Tubraj Hill for offering terracotta horses consecrated with goat's blood Photo xxedit: Haku#Shah</page><page sequence="12">Maati: Born from the Earth / 139 visit the hill to make their sacrificial offerings. Huge crowds gather and begin their ascent with clay horses, elephants, live goats, food, water. The abode of the god faces the east valley, with an immense collection of horses assembled on the platform. Only men are permitted to perform the sacrifice, and they queue up with their live goats and terracottas. The music is silenced, the atmosphere is charged with intense solemnity. When these rituals are compared to the religious practices of what has been mistakenly called the 'Great Tradition' in India,8 significant differences do emerge. Most immediately, images are created not of the god bu t as offerings to the god. Clay is equated with man, not with God—to play an indispensable role in the cycle of human existence. Clay serves as a catalyst for initiating man into the mysteries of metamorphosis, in the rites de passage. Stella Kramrisch, writing the first and seminal catalogue to an exhibition of rural and tribal India held in 1969, expresses this profound and vital difference. Only about thirty million (in India) are counted today as tribals... If outside the pale of Hindu influence and left to themselves, they neither built temples nor did they make images of their gods. Their religion expresses itself directly in rites in which works of art are the indispensable means of communication with the Supernatural, with man's experience of the Real. The Real is sensed in the waking experience. It may be adumbrated in dreams. It is known in trance. Trance, dream and waking experience are actual though they vary in kind and degree and live in different but interconnected planes. Tribal art gives them form.9 These clay images are not merely aesthetic objects, created and defined for one purpose. They comprise an intrinsic part of a total ritualistic enactment that involves the taking of vows, the transaction with the potter, pilgrimage, song, dance, trance, sacrifice and consecration. In this process, they establish man's relation with the Earth, contact with the Elements and with the seasons and the passing of time that is cyclical and not linear. They bring him in contact with his fields, his livestock, with the forests and the hills and the rivers. They become the means by which, through these contacts, man is rendered whole again.</page><page sequence="13">Terracotta offerings bought and sold in the bazar and presented to Goli Gadh Mata for healing afflicted parts of the body, specially stomach ailments</page><page sequence="14">Maati: Born from the Earth / 141 Clay restores to man his wholeness, bringing him to a sense of well being, physical and mental and spiritual. This is both implicitly and explicitly demonstrated in other uses of clay by the adivasis of Gujarat. Healing takes place through the medium of clay. Earth can substitute not only for animate creatures of this world, but for human flesh and for parts of the anatomy. Equally you can offer to the goddess a clay eye to heal your own eye of flesh and blood, a hand to set right your hand, a neck, a breast, an abdomen ... or an entire 'human' figure to make yourself physically whole again. As a rule, market places are not found near the sanctuaries of the gods. An exception is made in the case of Goli Gadh Mata where a mela or fair is held expressly for this purpose, where the buying and selling takes place of tiny human limbs, which are then offered to the goddess. Most often the golis are for purposes of healing hernia, parts of the abdomen and the intestines. As in other parts of tribal India such as Bastar, terracotta images are not made by the adivasis themselves, but by potters who may be traditional Hindus, belonging to a lower caste. For his work the kumbhar will be paid in kind and in cash; in one instance, some ten years ago, the potter was given one and a quarter maunds of grain, a cock, a bottle of alcohol and Rs 450 in cash! Complete understanding flows between the tribal who in this case is the patron, and the potter who is the recipient. An exception happens in the case of medicinal healing of persons afflicted mentally or possessed. In such cases the Bhagat himself, the priest of the Chodhri tribe, shapes out of raw and unbaked clay, fearsome images oibhutas and dakkinis. Bearing fanged teeth and wizened ghoul-like faces, they ride on horses. The afflicted person is seated within the magical, circumscribed area of a mandala drawn upon the ground. Then, with the branch from a neem or a jambu tree, the disease is whisked away by the Bhagat officiating, on to images of the dakkinis, who bear away the evil spirit. The intrinsic relationship with the earth perpetuates the cycle of birth, death and regeneration. The earth is propitiated not only through life but at the time of death. Among the adivasis it is ritual practice to paint primitive portraits of the deceased on stone, and to place these primeval objects, along with food, lamps and other offerings in the ghumat. These 'homes' (or ghumat) of baked clay are placed deep in the forest in sanctuaries, running into hundreds—</page><page sequence="15">Ghumat: houses for the deceased placed in a sanctuary,as practised by the Chodhris, Camit, Dublas,etc.</page><page sequence="16">Photo credit: Haku Shah</page><page sequence="17">144 / HAKU SHAH AND GEETt SEN creating an ambience of unfathomed mystery. The primeval origins of man's association with the Earth have hallowed with time. Earth becomes a catalyst for bestowing upon mankind good health, protection, prosperity and sustenance. Clay is the 'medium' for controlling man's destiny, for granting him wish fulfilment. If these myths and rituals could retain their propensity, if the same sensibility could be nurtured, they might prophesy a different future. Notes 1. As quoted by Michael Brand and Glenn D.
