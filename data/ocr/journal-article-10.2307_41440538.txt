Edited by Dahlia Shehata; Frauke Weiershäuser; and Kamran V. Zand. Cuneiform Monographs, vol. 41. Leiden: Brill, 2010. Pp. xvii + 500, illus. $224. The work of Brigitte Groneberg is well known to every serious student of Akkadian literature. This reviewer especially admires her fearlessness, shown already in her doctoral dissertation, in presenting first editions of Akkadian texts no one else has attempted (so also Charpin, p. 18 n. 3), some of which stand on or beyond the limits of comprehension. This volume presents twenty-four studies in her honor, reflecting her diversity of interests and impact on the discipline.</page><page sequence="2">684 Journal of the American Oriental Society 131.4 (2011) Among the philological and textual contributions, Cavigneaux and Jacques take up the Silbenvoka- bular texts, asking whether or not the scribes assigned some meaning to the syllables, how practical the equivalences were, and what might be their possible association with the scholastic creation story KAR 4. They pursue this inquiry with considerable ingenuity and once again stress the academic face of cuneiform literature, even in its primary stages. Charpin returns to the Old Babylonian edicts, point- ing out their often local and specific character, though, at the same time, the same clauses can recur in more than one edict and the texts available to us appear to be copies. This perplexing state of affairs is thrown into relief by his decipherment of the seal impression on a newly discovered tablet, which proves to be none other than that of Ammiditana as crown prince, rolled over the tablet and envelope of yet another edict, this one, however, an original. Charpin then goes on to set the edict in its local context, both historical and archaeological. This essay is a tour-de-force of creative scholarship. Durand presents a Mari letter consisting of a bilious complaint about a certain Asqudum, who seems to enjoy a fair amount of royal patronage. It is tempting to associate this man with the well-known notable and diviner of that name, who married into the royal family and enjoyed considerable status at court. From this letter it emerges that Asqudum had commercial interests not always crowned with success and carried on with probity. As Durand points out, commercial documents are not so common at Mari as one would expect from such a great entrepot, so the complaints and appeals registered here are of unusual interest. W. Färber edits to an exacting standard, with collations, spells and rituals to reconcile domestic disputes - one manuscript long known from the Tisserant collection, the others unedited duplicates from Sultantepe. This sheds new light on this lesser-known aspect of Ishtar, who is more commonly associated with fomenting disputes than resolving them. Maul takes up divination by flour, pointing out that even though much divinatory literature stresses expensive means of access to the gods' intentions, there is no reason to suppose that the gods them- selves were thought to be impressed with a costly medium; flour was available to anyone and the interpretive skills do not seem to have been that recherché. Yet even if this is everyman's divination, references to it are surprisingly sparse, suggesting that professionals, at least, attached higher cultural prestige to more elaborate procedures. Shehata takes up the question of authorship and self-reference in Old Babylonian Akkadian literature on the basis of the reviewer's proposals ("On Authorship in Akka- dian Literature," Annuario del Istituto Orientale di Napoli 51 [1991]: 17-32), adding a few additional ideas and references and discussing the possible institutional context of literary output. In addition, she discusses self-reference of the narrator in the Poem of the Righteous Sufferer, which is scarcely Old Babylonian, but fails to mention the reviewer's essay on this same topic ("Self-Reference of an Akkadian Poet," J AOS 103 [1983]: 123-30). To this reviewer her paper depended rather too much on recycled ideas and evidence already collected and discussed elsewhere. Marzahn studies a brief inscription of Nebuchadnezzar II on a mysterious bronze object found at Babylon, commemorating his work on Eanna in Uruk, a rare instance of a building inscription found in one city commemorating work in another. If the piece originated at Uruk, as would seem reason- able, how, why, or when it made its way to Babylon, and what it was, remain mysteries. Pientka-Hinz discusses the rich vocabulary for snakes, especially in Mesopotamian magic, with particular attention to their terrifying gaze, which seems far better attested than any frightening sound they made. Among many interesting points, she draws attention to the correlation between words for snakes and for objects that can be associated with them in magic. Steinert explores Sumerian and Akkadian words for sleep and the underlying concepts. Particularly fine is her proposal that human beings had to sleep to conserve their strength for labor, whereas gods slept as a sign of the leisure that human labor afforded them. There is more to this ambitious study, including a discussion of beds, feigned sleep (a motif previously noted by M.-J. Seux, Hymnes et prières aux dieux de Babylone et d Assyrie [Paris: Du Cerf, 1976], 147 n. 9), and an assortment of liter- ary passages. She notes that sleep does not seem to be depicted in Mesopotamian art (p. 249). Streck discusses the morphology and use of feminine gender in Old Babylonian nouns, producing a most impressive collection of material with penetrating comments; this reviewer was surprised at the number of unmarked, inanimate feminine nouns and at the number of apparently masculine nouns that take feminine plurals. Reconsidering the word samsatum (p. 291), this reviewer agrees that it is not diminutive but is semantically differentiated: 'a sun' (ornament) rather than 'the sun'. This usage is</page><page sequence="3">Reviews of Books 685 well enough attested in Semitics that there is no compelling reason to consider this case a diminutive; the reverse possibility also occurs: Arabic khalïf 'successor', but khalifat 'the successor', i.e., caliph. The old pedagogical principle that lil denotes the opposite of words without it, or the opposite of 0, is still appealing: collective or mass to singular or individual, masculine (0) to feminine, third person (0) to second, etc. To this reviewer's regret, Streck prefers to offer no thoughts on the broader issue, one of the most succinct statements of which is found in E. A. Speiser, "Studies in Semitic Formatives," JAOS 56 (1936): 22-46. Weiershäuser attempts a composite portrait of the god Ishum, sorted into his several roles and func- tions. At the center, of course, is the poem Erra and Ishum, especially its opening lines (pp. 360-61). The latest treatment of this passage by W. Farber, "Die einleitende Episode des Erra-Epos" ( Altori- entalische Forschungen 35 [2008]: 262-67), raises some interesting points. Weiershäuser does not seem to agree with him that the first three lines of the poem could refer to Ishum, as the logic of Fär- ber' s version calls him to suggest, and here this reviewer would agree. But she adopts Färber' s render- ing of line 20: "seine Frau geht zusammen mit Mami (d.h. der Frau Erras) solange ihrem Vergnügen nach" - grammatically unexceptionable, indeed an improvement, but on the level of sense a step too far backward for this reviewer to take. In an essay this elaborate, taking no account (p. 360 n. 1) of two standard translations of the poem, by G. Müller ( Texte aus der Umwelt des Alten Testaments III/4 [Gütersloh: Gütersloher Verlagshaus, 1994], 781-801) and by the reviewer (. Before the Muses , 3rd ed. [Bethesda, MD: CDL Press, 2005], 880-91 1), does the author little credit, though she finds room in her bibliography for a nineteenth-century edition of Damascius. To take but one example of what ignoring recent work can lead her to, she devotes three laborious pages (pp. 364-67) to arguing that ãlik mal}ri in line 11 might not mean 'herald', which she considers the "usual" translation, but fails to note that both the reviewer and Müller reached the conclusion she argues a good fifteen or more years ago. On the other hand, the translation and commentary by R. Zamudio {El Poema de Erra [Madrid: Ediciones Clásicas, 1999], 50) still prefers 'herald' to 'vanguard'. Staiger offers an elegant and interesting essay on the salt goddess in Mesopotamia, occasionally attested in Ur III texts, and on the problem of why salt is generally, but not always, depicted in negative terms in cuneiform literature, despite its many positive aspects in other cultures, including enhanced productivity and procreation. Joan Westenholz devotes an essay to Ninkarrak, a deity known at best from a phrase or two in studies of Mesopotamian religion, reaching the surprising conclusion that Ninkarrak may have had her home somewhere to the northwest, in the mid- or upper Euphrates region, and that her name is not Sumerian. This is a model study of its kind, thoroughly documented and cogently argued. Wasserman edits two incantation tablets with curiously mixed contents. The two parallel Sumerian spells seemed to this reviewer impossible either to reconcile or to understand, though the editor's positivist approach is laudable. Why, for example, accept gis as normative in line 20 = 2, instead of e? Could the distress not arise from irrigated ground, could it not sow its seed of misery, growing like a plant in the plowed soil, but the magician demand that the plow not be hitched up (lá), to block the growth of this fell tare? One finds DIB and E in successive lines at the beginning of the Farmer's Instructions (M. Civil, Aula Orientalis Supplementa 5 [Barcelona: Editorial AUSA, 1994]: 28, lines 2-3); an-ta could be the upper part of a field; the combination of giš apin and lá occurs at Sargonic Gasur (HSS 10.36 iv 5), referring to leased land for private gain; a-ga am-me-il-la might refer to rising water to irrigate the field, etc. In other words, any impressionistic rendering of this text can lead in quite different directions, hence: Preparing the upper part of the field (= the part along the watercourse), coming from the irrigated plots (variant: bringing the implements), hitching up the plow (on land not its own), the eye weeping from misery (says): "May I grow! May eyes weeping from misery grow up (every- where), (this, my) pure seed is misery!" That plant must not grow up, even if the water rises, the soil-set seed it (= the eye of misery) must not sow (with the seeder plow) meaning domestic(?) unhappiness shall not be allowed to burgeon. Wasserman' s effort to explain the two tablets was also courageous; one can agree to the extent that most non-canonical incantations</page><page sequence="4">686 Journal of the American Oriental Society 131.4 (2011) appear not to have been written by expert scribes, so were, perhaps, the property of practicing magi- cians, and the existence of duplicates is fascinating (father instructing son?), but further than that there seems no basis for going save imagination. Some day the discovery of such material in its archaeologi- cal context may help. Wiggermann collects evidence for breast-feeding of animals by women, in the case of Mesopotamia with reference to the demon Lamashtu, who is provided with suckling animals in amulets as a way, Wiggermann suggests, to spare human children her cruel ministration. Although the anthropological parallels he cites have no such magical purpose, this is indeed a thought-provoking explanation of an artistic motif. Zand reviews with great care the spelling of the monster-bird Anzu in Old Sumerian, making the striking suggestion that the reformed spelling of the Ur III period was in part motivated by the association of this creature with clouds or fog as known from the Akkadian Anzu-poem and was a folk etymology for an old spelling no longer understood. A. Zgoll raises the question of why the walls of Uruk are foregrounded in the prologue and end of the Gilgamesh Epic whereas they otherwise have no role in the narrative, and explores their possible symbolic significance, the first such inquiry of its kind, to this reviewer's knowledge. Two contributions on Ugaritic by Kämmerer and Van Soldt and one on Horace by C. Zgoll round out the philological and literary contributions. On the side of material culture, Dittmann discusses a possible correlation between small, sometimes pierced, plaques, and larger, uninscribed, stela-like monuments. Nunn contributes a lively, interesting, and well-documented study of imagery and its absence, or image versus object, with particular refer- ence to the betyl-stones, best known to Assyriologists at Mari, not to mention the Stelenreihe at Assur. Whether or not these parallel, rather than complementary, traditions implied a dichotomy of images and language remains very much an open question, but this essay adds a challenging new dimension to the discussion of cult images in the ancient Near East and the sense in which the gods were pres- ent in them. If anthropomorphic images, made of valuable materials, were taken as booty, these mute stones were left in their ruined sanctuaries, so there was, apparently, no ideological victory in carting them off. Selz discusses the possibility that a daughter is portrayed in the Ur-Nanše plaque, marshalling both pictorial and philological evidence. The frequent depiction, if not portrayal, of notable women, presumably priestesses, in Akkadian art, seems also in favor of his proposal (see Claudia Suter, "Who are the Women in Mesopotamian Art from ca. 2334-1763 все?" Kaskal 5 [2008]: 1-47), in which case Ur-Nanse's plaque could be a forerunner of a future, well-attested artistic agenda. This rich collection of diverse essays is a worthy tribute to the distinguished honoree. Benjamin R. Foster Yale University</page></plain_text>
