BITTERMAN, University of Texas New Means of Studying Color Blindness and Normal Foveal Color Vision: With Some Results and Their Genetical Implications. By GORDON L. WALLS and RAVENNA W. MATHEWS. Berkeley and Los Angeles, University of California Publications in Psychology, Vol. 7, No. 1, 1952. Pp. iv, 172. Under a somewhat misleading title, this heady and contentious dissertation pro- poses a novel version of the entoptic shadow pattern known as "Maxwell's Spot," replacing macular pigment with a suppositious mosaic of foveal red and blue re- ceptors as the explanatory principle. Ignoring as it does the refinements of technique and the backlog of demonstrated color facts of psychological science, the study falls rather within the confines of optometry. Since, however, its labyrinthine argument turns up points in retinal histology and photochemistry of moment in the simplest color observation and as yet inadequately explored or recognized, it merits at least passing attention, however one assesses the value of its "new means of study." Among the problematic issues raised are the size and contours of the fovea (the spot of clearest vision), of the rod-free area, and of the macula lutea (the central retinal field impregnated with a yellow pigment variously identified as a lutein, a carotenoid, or a derivative of visual purple, the absorption curve of which is com- monly held to account for irregularities in color matches, and the failure of cases of deviate color vision to run true to form). Other points of theoretical and practical interest arising are: the precise color temperature of white light, whether 5000?, 6700?, or 7500? Kelvin; visual acuity under different monochromatic illuminations; the peculiar heredity of minor deviations from normal color vision, and the pos- sible intergrading with each other or with nqrmality of the recognized variants; finally, the size and pattern of Maxwell's spot, briefly visible under short-wave stimulation of the foveal area, and currently assumed to represent the filtering effect of a film of macular pigment, which, by absorbing some of the short-wave radiations, protects the cone receptors in brilliant sunlight and at the same time increases visual acuity (by reducing chromatic aberration). The investigators cited range from Buzzi (1782) and Soemmering (circa 1800), through Miller and Helmholtz, Sachs (1891), Von Kries (1897), Greeff (1900), Gullstrand (1905), Holm (1922), Wald (1945), Miles (1947-49), to Segal and Hartridge (1951). In the discussion over a minute blue-blind (or tetartanopic) point in the fovea, the names of K6nig, Willmer (1949) and Wright enter. In genetics, Trendelenburg, Pickford and others are quoted. But while the authors figure as industrious collaters of source-literature, their reports are to be read with caution. They have an axe to grind-the ineffectiveness of macular absorption to alter color perception (see pages 21 and 82 where macular pigment is termed "the little mother of all discrepancies" and its indiscriminate use by theorists held up to scorn). The main objective of this study is, in fact, the launching of a substitute proposal, which seeks to explain the phantom Maxwell pattern and other matters in terms of non- 182</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS uniform distribution of red, green, and blue receptors in the central retinal area, in both normal and protanopic eyes. Promotion of this idea, suggested doubtless by Walls' studies of the mosaic retinae of lower animals (see The Vertebrate Eye, 1942), has a secondary aim-cutting away the ground from under four-color theor- ists, who, as Walls mistakenly believes, are entirely dependent on yellow pigmenta- tion to solve the enigma of protanopia, its divergence from deuteranopia, and the idiosyncrasies of both types. (The use in theory of macular pigment, by the way, stems not from Hering but from Maxwell.) Tenacious adherents of the old Thomas Young hypothesis of triune hue receptors (with minor modifications), the authors are set to go any length to sustain it. Masters of argumentative chiaroscura, they skilfully highlight favorable points in the literature, and shadow others, e.g. Hecht's neutral-point data, and Ahlenstiel's Maxwell-spot studies. Curious gaps appear in the citation of authorities; e.g., in discussing the topography of the fovea (really a peculiar pit) and the inner neural layers of the retina, all reference to Polyak's monumental work of 1941 is omitted, and though the 9-page bibliography (pp. 164-172) lists 124 authors, his name is missing. Further, though the only photo-sensitive or selectively absorbent pigment (apart from the macular) so far demonstrated in the human retina is rhodopsin (with porphyropsin and iodopsin in the infra-human), and though Sheppard's article of 1945 on variable dyes, and Segal's of 1951, foreshadowing his Mechanisme de la Vision des Couleurs of 1953, are listed, photochemical variation of rhodopsin is summarily dismissed as having a possible bearing on deviating types of color vision. Instead, the mythical photochemical pigments of trichromatic tradition- red-, green-, and blue-sensitive-are used, variable in amount only, to sustain the weight of the research in hand, explain both normal and anormal color perceptions, and the presence or absence of the elusive 'Maxwell's spot.' Prefatory to the experimental record, 59 pages are devoted to exposition of the a priori premises and general frame of reference of the study, along with the unique phraseology and catchwords to be employed-pro-sensation, intensitivity, chromatic- ness, anomal, the excess, loss, and collapse hypotheses, and the RDP. Normal color vision, Big Four color blindness, the excess hypothesis, genetics of color blindness, Maxwell's Spot (24 pages), and receptor type distribution (RDP) are section cap- tions. The critical area for color perception, we learn, is in the retina, not the cortex, and the cones are pretty surely the media of differentiation. (This emphasis, which may conceal a fling at Muller, ignores Polyak's and Houstoun's suggestions that the synaptic layers of the retina may be the selective ones, as well as Kliiver's vote for the geniculate-striate area. In the final effort to dispose of 'peculiar cases,' however, we shall find Walls weakening, in favor of a central as well as a retinal protanopia.) While cones are red-, green-, and blue-sensitive, each equipped with one of the three selective pigments or color filters, yellow is merely a synthetic quality, like wetness, having no cone of its own. (Here the findings of Hartridge and Motokawa with punctiform or electric stimulation go unnoticed; while Hurvich and Jameson's refutation of Hecht's faulty technique and logic in proclaiming 'binocular fusion' of yellow as cortical, hence a valid stanchion of Helmholtz' theory, is summarily dismissed.) A bluish yellow is inconceivable-though why remains a mystery (except to the opponents or four-color theory). White is neither a synthetic quality (the sum of three hues), nor has it a specific cone, nor is it a summation of the specific 183</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS brightnesses of colors. White is simply an excess-phenomenon, existing by default- a notion only mistily elucidated, but useful to account for the persistence of white in dichromatic vision without either coloration or loss of intensity supervening. The handling of the Big Four of deviate color vision, the dichromatic protanope and deuteranope, and the trichromatic protanomalous and deuteranomalous, is in part eclectic, in part sui generis. Protanopia, marked by long-wave depression of luminosity and a relatively short-wave neutral point, is a "loss" phenomenon, with the red receptors entirely missing and color perception limited to blues and greens. The O's notion that he sees yellows (supported by the testimony of Dr. Pole and mis-diagnosed unilateral cases, e.g. Von Hippel's Goldenberg) is illusory-though on page 87 the protanope's conviction that he sees blues is declared irrefutable. Deuteranopia (the green-blindness of Von Kries and the older literature), with the spectral location of its luminosity curve practically normal, and its neutral point nearer 500 mi, is not a "loss" but a "collapse" phenomenon-an idea first sug- gested by Fick back in the 1870's, an admission of the fact that 'red' and 'green' blindness are not parallel cases. Briefly, the red and green curves collapse on each other, the two sets of receptors lose their identity, become sensitized to a wider range of wavelengths-and the result is perceived as yellow. This "collapse" might be due to a change in photochemical composition, equivalent to the genesis of a yellow cone, hence reminiscent of Ladd-Franklin's evolutionary view. The latter, however, is declared "zoologically repugnant," and Walls finally settles on the notion that each cone stocks both red- and green-sensitive pigment, unchanged but in varying proportions-a decision useful later in explaining anomalous trichromates and their intergrading with normal-visioned. The hues seen by deuteranopes are of course blue and yellow. White is not reduced in brightness in either type of dichromate, as Hecht's and Hsia's faulty technique would seem to indicate. In "anomals," saturation is greatly depressed throughout the spectrum, and chromatic adaptation rapid, according to Wieland and Chapanis. The anomaloscope equation-the red-green mixture necessary to match yellow-distinguishes them, a high proportion of green marking the deuteranomalous, of red, the protanomalous. The first, after much discussion, is classed with deuteranopia, as an example of "collapse," with degrees of "substitution" instead of slight differentiations of pig- ment as the explanatory principle. As to its intergrading with deuteranopia or nor- mality, opinions differ, but at least two degrees, mild and severe, of deuteranomaly on its way to dichromatism, are accepted by geneticists (p. 13). As to protanomaly, its occurrence in a continuum of grades between normality and dichromatism (pro- tanopia) is probable, according to Trendelenburg. Pitt's views are found inadequate; Pickford's impossible (p. 15). (Incidentally, Walls' chromatic sensitivity curves (p. 2) are admittedly fictitious, showing the red and green curves nearly coinciding in the normal, so that the collapse of the green curve on the red is not difficult to figure-though variable views as to its cause or nature crop up throughout the text. Obviously, the quantitative terms in which the "loss" and "collapse" hypotheses are framed-even while ruling out quantitative changes in the photochemical mole- cule-favor the admission of intermediate grades between dichromatism and nor- mality, though failing to explain why deuteranomaly will be found to outnumber all other types in the ratio of 5 to 8.) Turning to the "excess hypothesis" (a view similar to Szekeres' of 1948 and 184</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS Willmer's of 1948-49), Walls argues for the whiteness of the dichromat's white, on the testimony of unilateral cases (earlier questioned), and his own belief that "the dichromate, from his scotopic experience, knows what 'white' means to a normal." The existence of a neutral point in dichromatic vision is accepted, ex- plained by the crossing of two hue curves (an idea borrowed from the opponents theory?). Reluctant admission is made that "huedness and brightness are to some extent independently manipulable." In a 7-page discussion of the genetics of color blindness, the framework of genes, phenes, and multiple alleles (with possible mutation) is invoked to account for anomalous cases and their intergrading with normals, and to establish separate loci in the chromosome for deuteranopia and protanopia (the latter point aimed espe- cially at the proposition that 'protanopia' may be only a variant of deuteranopia, both deviants being red-green blind, but with an added scoterythrous factor in the protanopic, producing a shortening in the red, or a shift of the entire visible spectrum toward the short-wave region). Secondly, the older view that color deficiency is strictly sex-linked, and that the daughter of a dichromat is a heterozygote, a 'carrier' and potentially the mother of dichromats, but herself normal-visioned, is replaced with Fleischer's discovery in 1920 that she may be color-weak, or an anomal, or show darkening if not dimming in the red. Maxwell's spot gets the lead in pages 27-51. Here the above-noted lack of agree- ment among research workers and authorities as to the absorption curve and distribu- tion of macular pigment and the size of the rod-free fovea (readily understandable in view of the difficulty of postmortem examination, and the fact demonstrated by Polyak that the fovea is actually a small crater, with cones gradually slimming and lengthening from margin to centre until they resemble rods) is used to clear the ground for Walls' unique decision later that a 30 area (coterminous with the 'clear- ing' of his Maxwell pattern) is pigment-free, while a 33' center (the foveola?) is picked as the rod-free fovea. As for macular pigment, its use by Sloan and Judd to interpret odd unilateral cases (1948), or by Holm (1922) and Miles (1947-49) to explain decrease of blue in a Maxwell pattern viewed through a violet or purple dichroic filter, is discredited. Varying photochemical concentrations in receptors, or non-uniform distribution of the three type-cones are pronounced superior principles of explanation. Though rejecting Gullstrand's view of macular yellow as a post- mortem artifact, and of the halo and central dot of the Maxwell pattern as purely optical effects, Walls holds pigment concentration in the central thinned-out retinal area to be absent or ineffectual (tossing into the discard his statement of 1942 in Visual Mechanisms that in primates the yellow pigment envelops and includes the fovea-a definitely utilitarian device to sharpen vision, akin to the yellow oil drops in the lizard). Curiously, the fact is ignored that any reader can demonstrate for himself, without benefit of apparatus, the macular pigment and Maxwell's spot. Both are visible, when projected on a white ground by a momentarily dark-adapted eye, as a thin yellowish disk with central dot, clearing, and shadowy halo, the whole subtending 3-7? by a simple calculation. Similarly, the fovea, mapped by letter-span on the printed page, shows Walls' 33' choice (based on old 1907 data) far too small; Polyak's 10 40' finding seems to fit the facts closer. Receptor-type distribution (pp. 51-59) disposes of Hecht's fruitless 20-year endeavor, through the study of acuity and luminosity, to shore up the trichromatic 185</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS theory, support the thesis of equal numbers and uniform distribution of the three type-cones, and read off both deutans and protans as cases of "loss." Hecht's brief for lowered luminosity in all dichromats is rejected as unsound though his demon- stration of subnormal acuity of protans in red light, with compensatory heightening in blue, is accepted (as likely to prove useful later). Hartridge's views on random distribution and 'cluster' grouping of receptors also are questioned, as lacking con- firmation. On the other hand, the K6nig-Willmer-Wright contention for a minute blue-blind foveocentral area, seconded by Stiles' charting of thresholds across the fovea with 10' monochromatic lights, plays directly into Walls' hand. As histologist and geneticist he speaks out for a "rigidly planned," non-random and non-uniform dis- tribution of receptor types, with red cones predominating in the normal fovea and replaced by blue ones in the protanope. (No reason for this partiality to blue in "the central planning committee," usually designated in anthropomorphic terms, is ad- vanced. Nor is there any reference to the long current view of "planned" distribu- tion in the paracentral area, where a red-green-blind (or weak) zone merges into an outer achromatic one.) The ways are now cleared for the direct observation of the fleeting entoptic phenomenon known for its discoverer as Maxwell's spot, but here rechristened RDP (receptor distribution pattern). A unique red-purple dichromic Wratten filter, No. 2389 (recommended by Miles), the absorption curve for which is described only, is chosen in place of the blue or violet light of earlier observers. All but one of the 64 color-normal Os (14 of whom were women) reported the phantom pattern as some variant of a reddish smudge or cloud, with or without a central redder or darker dot, in a 'clearing' surrounded by a halo, the whole subtending 3 or more degrees on the retina. Variants of the pattern were classified into Types I-VI (sur- mised as possibly running in families), with 17 showing no differentiation of dot and clearing. Discarding all earlier interpretations, Walls deduces a high concentra- tion of red receptors in the center of the retina, and turns to the protanopic or red- blind, as presumably lacking all receptors of this type, for negative confirmation. To single out protans (Farnsworth's term) for this purpose, three measures were adopted: (1) the ratio of red to green required to match yellow in a filter anomalo- scope; (2) the luminosity (in terms of a voltage-reading only) of red and of blue filtered light in relation to a standard green; and (3) the wavelength of the neutral point as calculated from the ratio of Munsell blue to green needed to match gray on a rotating disk. Results and tables of scores are incompletely or inadequately presented; but though the arrays are practically continuous (except for red luminos- ity scores) the group of 35 anormals who volunteered was divided, quite satis- factorily to the experimenters, into 19 protanopes and 16 deuteranopes (a reversal of the ratio usual in non-selected groups). Thirteen of the protans reported a blue RDP, while only one of the deutans saw anything on the screen at all. Walls accepts this outcome as proof that the red receptors, overnumerous in the normal fovea, are replaced in the protan by blue ones, which simply crowd in or are directed by an embryonic "planning" agency. Absence of a deutan RDP is juggled into proof that this defect is a "collapse" phenomenon, leaving no guiding clues to the em- bryonic "planner." Failure of the deutan to report a patterned yellow smudge may be due to viewing conditions and the mazda source. Neither here nor in the earlier RDP observations were precautions taken apparently as to neutral preadaptation, or 186</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS preliminary training in color naming, though yellowish light is commonly confused with white, and violet and purple are terms notoriously interchanged by the uninitiate. Nor was any guard set (except in one test) against chromatic aberration, which overemphasizes red in the near-sighted, blue in the far-sighted.) Deuteranomalous and protanomalous cases, distinguished from dichromats by lack of a neutral point, are next discussed (pp. 95 to 106) with a number of pedigrees, in an intricate argument that works up into family trees, and is reminiscent of a Freudian attempt to explain the normal in terms of the abnormal. While certain unclassifiable cases give trouble, Walls is satisfied that he has proved conclusively that deuteranopia and protanopia are distinct entities (p. 94); that the latter is not deuteranopia "plus a darkened red factor," as Murray, Pickford, and others have suggested-though a "dimmed red factor," sometimes occurring independently of other defects, is reluctantly admitted. (Mistakenly, the authors assume that this reviewer's scoterythrous concept derives from Hering; it originated with Rivers.) The discovery (matching Schmidt's of 1934) of heterozygotes (women carriers with dichromatic sons) with depressed luminosity of red as their only deviate fea- ture, and of other Os that "defy classification" leads to speculation as to the likeli- hood of a brightness cone, or of bifurcated paths, and to a limited recasting of premises, such as "collapse protanopia" and "loss deuteranopia." Unquestionably, the authors are to be commended for reliance not on one but on a team of tests (anomaloscope, luminosity, and neutral point, not always, to be sure, wisely set up or administered) for diagnosis. Credit must be allotted also for detailed reports of the pedigrees of certain Os and related cases in the genetic literature-a line of work carried on more extensively abroad by Pickford and others. But a genetics based on faulty or inadequate anomaloscope readings (see Farnsworth's recent study) is necessarily hidebound and misleading. "There's many a slip twixt the gene and the phene," is Walls' own conclusion, after a 50-page discussion of unique and puzzling cases. Many of the dilemmas would be readily resolved, however, if the four-color proponents' postulates were to be substituted for trichromatic. To tran- scribe his comments on another worker: "the three-component theory will be destroyed by inbreeding if it is tested further by considerations that derive from a system that assumes the theory." In the Introduction, however, interpretation on the basis of other assumptions is generously invited. In the final pages (156-63) the postulates set up in the preamble are amplified or contracted (with some concessions to the obstinacy of observed fact) into 61 one-to-three-sentence maxims. No index is provided, however, which puts the reader at a disadvantage in assessing the frequent textual contradictions, relating especially to the "collapse" theory of deuteranopia, the troublesome "darkened" or "dimmed red" factor, and the significance of variations in the RDP. As for the latter, the variant contours reported suggest, to the unbiassed reader, not so much peculiar groupings of displaced red or blue receptors, as a mild yellow inundation of an irregular coastline-that of the inner retinal surface in the foveal basin. As for coloring, no one but Walls has ever insisted that the macular pigment, to be visually effective, must intercept all the short-wave "pro-blue" stimuli. The residue passed would account for the violet or purplish tones reported now and then in the RDP descriptions. The shadowy portions of the pattern may represent, not regimented red receptors, but simply thicker or more opaque tissue, or steep slopes. As for "a world of work remaining to be done," all research workers in color 187</page><page sequence="7">BOOK REVIEWS must agree. Some, however, may remain sceptical as to the wisdom of concentrating, at the histologist's behest, on the mosaic pattern of 3-type cone receptors in the fovea; sceptical also as to his permanent liquidation of the macula. The failure of certain deutans to report a definite RDP pattern or color may, it is true, be an artifact of method or instructions worth investigating; but instead of the cumber- some set-up with filter No. 2389 to separate deutans from protans one suggests trial first of the old duplex diagnostic Ishihara scarlet and purple digit-plate. Under- standing that in the deutan's perception of the purple digit the blue primary in the mixture cancels the yellow valence of the red, leaving residual grays, while in the perception of the scoterythrous protan, the entire red response including its yellow valence, is eliminated, leaving a blue (intensified by the possible shift of the entire spectrum toward violet), should serve to explain not only why the purple digit on its gray ground is invisible to the deutan and seen as bluish by the protan, but also why the latter sees the RDP for Walls in blues and the deutan probably in yellowish tones hardly visible against a mazda-lit ground. As for useful filters, in view of Ahlenstiel's claim that mazda illumination con- verts his perceptions from protanopic to deuteranopic, trial of a (partially) minus- red-filter (if such exists) to convert deutan into protan (scoffingly proposed by Walls) would seem to offer a rewarding line of research (possibly already tapped by Collins). After grappling with the color reports of the RDP in this study and with the experimenters' deductions, certain primary qualifications essential to any observer or experimenter, engaging to explore the color-mediating zones of the retina, sug- gest themselves. First of all, acquaintance with the permutations and commutations of hue, a few hundreds of which may be sampled in the small Munsell handbook of color, is desirable, plus a stable descriptive system, taking some note of the common confusion of brightness and saturation, and the almost universal inter- change of the terms violet and purple in the uninitiate. To these should be added familiarity with liminal colored lights and the ease of confusion of blues and greens; knowledge of the dissection of violets and purples in the near- and far- sighted eye into reds and blues, with emphasis on one or the other; and experience of the subtle transformations effected by change in illumination, by adaptation, by complementary contrast and negative after-images, and by the operation of the Bezold-Briicke law at different levels of intensity of monochromatic lights (due to the spread across the spectrum of the response curve of any primary). Finally, though one may criticize the methods and conclusions of this monograph, its lack of organization of text and tabular matter, and its bias, its authors merit credit for highlighting neutral-point data; for opening up the field of genetics, neglected this side of the water; for exposing as well the need of further detailed postmortem study of the retinae of normal and color-deviating Os, with an eye out for the possible presence of rhodopsin in rodlike foveal cones. It should do service also as an eye-opener to the physicist or physician who accepts the old Young- Helmholtz trichromatic theory uncritically, on faith. For Walls, following Hecht's lead, shows a keen eye for the loopholes and weak points in the latter, and, volun- tarily or not, has demonstrated how inadequate are its postulates when put practically to work in the no-man's-land of deviating color vision.
