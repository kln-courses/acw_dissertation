<plain_text><page sequence="1">DAVID MORGAN The Idea of Abstraction in German Theories of the Ornament from Kant to Kandinsky In 1905 the art critic Arthur Roessler wrote that he had seen a number of drawings by the Neu- Dachau painter Adolf Hoelzel in which the "spiritual and mental movements of the artist from different periods of his life were arrested." ' These drawings, Roessler continued, "form the abstract ornament; abstract in the sense of non- objective."2 Roessler's comments provide a help- ful clue in pointing to ornament as a primary avenue by which 'abstraction' became under- stood as a non-representational image or pic- torial procedure. By the end of the nineteenth century, discussion of the ornamental or deco- rative introduced into critical discourse about painting the idea that the visual arts could oper- ate in a fully artistic way without employing representational techniques. Since the late eigh- teenth century, however, considerations of orna- ment have made important contributions to the discussion of the nature of representation and beauty. I will show how the modern notion of abstraction emerged from a theoretical discourse on ornament that focused on three of the most basic themes in nineteenth-century German art theory: form, style, and empathy. I offer neither an exhaustive treatment of the theory of orna- ment nor a representative survey of its history, but a selective investigation which attempts to understand certain aspects of the role ornament played in theoretical reflections on art.3 I. THEORIES OF FORM, STYLE, AND ORNAMENT The idea that certain forms are inherently pleas- ant, without reference to anything else, is hardly a new one. But among the earliest modern writ- ers to highlight this capacity of ornamentation were Karl Philipp Moritz and Immanuel Kant. Writing their major works on aesthetics between 1785 and 1793, these two Prussian scholars each defined beauty as free of any purpose beyond itself. Moritz believed that the beautiful object sig- nified nothing beyond itself. "The truly beau- tiful consists of the object which signifies only itself, designates itself, encloses itself, is a whole complete in itself."4 For Moritz, beauty was characterized by the fusion of meaning and form. "The form of a vase," he claimed, "gen- erates itself from the natural idea of holding."5 Idea and visual structure are seamlessly joined. Moritz annexed this idealist view to a no less idealist preference for delineation or contour, which, like Kant, he identified as the essence of representation. Contour served to isolate or sep- arate, to set out form. According to Moritz, the more a thing isolated itself within its own con- tour and contained within itself its center of gravity, "the less accidental, the less subordi- nate to some other and mixed with it" was the form.6 In the early 1790s, Moritz applied this principle to ornament and broke down the tradi- tional distinction between the decorative and the fine arts. Ornament, we read, is best explained on the principle of isolation. The beauty of the frame and the beauty of the picture proceed from one and the same principle. The picture presents [darstellen] something complete in itself; the frame encloses once again that which is complete in itself.7 The frame, Moritz wrote in his Vorbegriffe zu einer Theorie der Ornamente, "expands exter- nally in order that we may as it were gradually peer into the inner sanctum which glimmers through this enclosure."8 This image foreshadows The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 50:3 Summer 1992</page><page sequence="2">232 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism Philipp Otto Runge's use of the ornamented frame in his Tageszeiten series of engravings and paintings a decade later. As the revelatory char- acter of his language suggests, Moritz held orna- ment in high esteem, suggesting that it not only possessed the ability to refine taste and arouse the soul, but constituted a "noble impulse of the soul" and an impulse which was as beneficial as the impulse to science or "high art."9 Accordingly, Moritz subsumed ornament and fine art under the single category of the "im- pulse toward beauty." To the objection that ornament may not possess a self-contained pur- pose inasmuch as it serves the purpose of deco- rating another object, Moritz would reply that the ornament and the 'ornamented' object serve a single purpose. The frame, for instance, is but an extension of the picture, yet another means of self-isolation. Furthermore, Moritz was able to overcome the traditional distinction of fine and applied art because he replaced the idea of imita- tion as the end of art with that of the "pleasure" derived from forgetting oneself in contempla- tion of a complete aesthetic whole.'0 This al- lowed him to fuse the aim of image and orna- ment into a single aesthetic moment of self-loss or self-forgetting that foreshadowed a central feature of Schopenhauer's thought. The linear isolation of form in ornament which Moritz prized as a fully independent aesthetic moment, and which he understood to possess an "inner purposiveness" [innere Zweckmassigkeit], anticipated Kant's Kritik der Urteilskraft (1790)."l Kant argued here that the only pure judgment of taste was that which fornally exhibits "free beauty"- 'free' because the form is independent not only of any interest we might have for it, but also of any definite concept which might deter- mine what the thing ought to be.'2 Kant men- tioned pure, unmixed colors, flowers, sea shells, exotic birds, linear ornaments 'a la grecque, and music without words as instances of such free beauty, "beauties in themselves." Judgment of such objects proceeds solely on the basis of their form, for they "mean nothing in themselves; they represent nothing-no object under a definite concept."'3 Subjects such as the human figure, on the other hand, of which we possess a definite concept, exhibit Kantian "dependent beauty" be- cause their perfection depends not on their repre- sentation alone, but on how well they fulfill the purpose prescribed for them by the concept. The attention given by Moritz and Kant to the self-contained significance of form in ornament provided the inspiration for subsequent formalist aesthetics which disregarded imitation as the basis of art. Johann Friedrich Herbart, a later philosopher in Kdnigsberg, made Kant's idea of a pure judgment of taste the exclusive basis of aesthetic experience. Herbart argued that beauty resided not in a particular color, form or tone, as Kant had suggested, but in its relation as a men- tal representation (Vorstellung) with another color, form or tone. 14 A single element is neutral and only becomes aesthetically significant when joined with another element. Herbart did not deny the significance of subject matter or the pertinence of a feeling with which one responds to a work of art, but insisted that such meaning and feeling were not the beautiful, and that the essence of aesthetic judgment lay in one's expe- rience of the formal relations. What did the old masters mean to express who devel- oped the possible forms of the fugue, or those still older whose industry differentiated the possible or- ders of the column? They desired to express nothing. Their thoughts did not travel beyond their arts but penetrated deeply into their essence. 15 Herbart differentiated the inherent effect of aes- thetic relations on the viewer from what he called "apperception." 16 By this he meant what- ever the viewer brings to the perception of a work of art that is not found within its formal effect. For instances of aesthetic pleasure with- out apperception, Herbart looked principally to music, architecture, and poetry-all of which possess a fundamentally non-representational dimension in their formal structure. What mat- tered in aesthetic judgment was not the subject, but the pleasure created by the mental configura- tion of elements or forms presented to the viewer by the work of art. Herbart scorned the use of catalogues in the painting gallery or librettos at the opera and praised Hadyn's music for the fact that it required no text: "for his music is music and to be beautiful need mean nothing." '7 And because the work of art carries its significance within itself, so to speak, and because its asso- ciation with anything beyond itself should not condition the judgment of taste, "imitation can never be set up as a principle of aesthetic." 18 Herbart's formalism received a more system-</page><page sequence="3">Morgan Abstraction and German Theories of the Ornament 233 atic presentation by Robert Zimmermann, pro- fessor of philosophy in Vienna, who sought to outline the "pure science of form" in his major work on aesthetics of 1865.19 Zimmermann stressed emphatically that it was only the par- ticular form of the relation between elements which pleased or displeased and that everything outside of this relation such as subject matter and the material of the art work were "aesthet- ically indifferent."20 Like Herbart, Zimmer- mann contended that, as the science of form, aesthetics had its singular purpose in determin- ing the kinds of formal relations which please and displease. 21 II. THE LIMITS OF ORNAMENT Reaction to the formalist aesthetic was severe in Germany, not only for the indifference it ex- pressed toward the subject's significance for beauty and the marginalization of what Herbart called 'apperception,' but also for the threat for- malism posed toward undermining the idealist enterprise of aesthetics as the explanation of art's metaphysical significance. This reaction is important for this study because it was the for- malism of Herbart and Zimmermann which provoked mid-century aestheticians in Germany to scrutinize the capacity of line and color for expression independent of representation. But, for reasons that I will examine, this scrutiny worked against claims for the aesthetic signifi- cance of ornament. For, although such promi- nent critics of the formalist view as Friedrich Theodor Vischer and Gustav Fechner turned their attention to the non-representational power of line and color, they were not prepared to consider the expressive potential of formal ele- ments as the basis for an aesthetic that might supplant representation in art. If the positive treatment of ornament by Kant and Moritz en- couraged a formalist aesthetic in Herbart and Zimmermann, Vischer and Fechner sought to check this development by diminishing the aes- thetic status of ornament. Friedrich Theodor Vischer acknowledged the expressive power of color which was "abstract, without object," and pointed to the "stained glass of Gothic churches where clearly without plastic depiction the transparent glow of harmo- nious color works impressively on the soul."22 Yet, Vischer continued, the symbolic signifi- cance of the light and color was further extended where the light and color were bound to objects, though inanimate ones such as in landscape.23 It was also Vischer's belief that beauty could not be exhausted by regular geometrical forms such as the square, circle, cube or sphere. "The beau- tiful is [an] essentially living, autonomous indi- vidual; what lives never grows into regularity, life brings unevenness with it."24 And color, he insisted, was only the means, never the end of painting. Color belonged to the object, was the wherewithal for depicting form.25 According to Vischer, by fixing on the harmo- nious combination of colors and the connections of lines independent of depicted objects, for- malism commits itself to a view which Vischer regarded as self-evidently wrong: "Arabesques, linear and colored ornaments [would have to be] explained as really and truly beautiful and the painter of decoration [would be] a purer artist than the painter of history."26 Vischer did not seek to deny that line and color could produce an effect rightly called beautiful, but allowed them to do so only within the framework of empathy. He looked to landscape painting (whose beauty he called "musical") as the genre in which "ab- stract phenomena" or formal artistic elements were infused with a spiritual mood or disposi- tion.27 In order to account for those forms which represent nothing, yet which Vischer felt exhib- ited beauty, he developed a special theory of symbol which he defined as that process in which, "following an inner necessity of the nature of our soul, we attribute a mental disposi- tion to the abstract forms of appearance [color, tone, line, surface] so that our own inner life appears to meet us in them. "28 Vischer could not allow that "abstract forms" could function aes- thetically without being rooted in the spiritual life of feeling. By 'abstract' he meant anything disconnected from concrete objects and there- fore devoid of life.29 This, he felt, was how the formalist view wished to characterize beauty: a mental configuration of formal elements unre- lated to the material substrate of the physical world. Accordingly, Vischer praised two large decorative paintings by the Austrian artist Hans Makart in which "color is not abstractly under- stood, for it is magnificently keyed to the object, that is, to the expression of the fullness of life, of complete enjoyment."30 Makart's allegori- cal, neo-rococo style of painting in these works</page><page sequence="4">234 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism dramatized for Vischer how firmly the deco- rative effects of form and color ought to be fixed within the framework of representational, albeit fanciful, image-making. Gustav Fechner also acknowledged the ex- pressive effect of the relations of non-represen- tational form and color, but asserted that such an effect in the visual arts, as in music, was not of the superior aesthetic variety "which deserves the name beautifuil in the narrow and higher sense." 'Fechner reasoned so because such for- mal relations lacked "meaning" or "sense."9 "Objects of little or incidental aesthetic impor- tance, such as a carpet [or] a wall can indeed achieve a direct pleasantness through relations of color and form in their surfaces, angles, and patterns; yet prove even thereby that they cannot be elevated to a higher, independent aesthetic importance, [prove] how negligible and low the aesthetic achievement of these relations is."32 As pleasing as the symmetry of the kaleidoscope is, it has no place, Fechner contended, in the landscape or history painting because it does not suit the meaning (Bedeutung) of the depicted objects. The color of a painting is determined more by the demands of meaning than by "the rules of color harmony. "33 Moreover, all rela- tions among the formal elements of an image are determined by the characteristics of the subject matter, and are beautiful insofar as they conform to the "expression of higher and pertinent ideas. "34 But Fechner did not attempt to ignore the intrinsic expressiveness of formal relations. For instance, he was able to observe that a painting, already from a distance, even before we recognize its content or whenever we abstract from the same, makes an impression as enjoyable as the other. In order to facilitate this abstraction and to judge a picture no less surely in regard to its mere effect of colors, many give the rule to view it upside down.35 Furthermore, Fechner was prepared to allow that the direct pleasure of formal relations in- creased in the visual arts as one "descends" (herabgehen) from sculpture and painting to architecture, and then to the "technical arts and ornament," since the factor of association, Fechner's cherished mechanism of "meaning," was lost to the 'direct' effect of line and color.36 Attention to subject matter in painting and sculp- ture is replaced in architecture, ornament, and the decorative arts by such abstract devices as symmetry, the golden section, regularized pat- terns, the wavy line, the volute, and by the brilliance, purity, and saturation of color-all of which lack, according to Fechner, the associa- tive ability to evoke ideas, which is the principal determinant of beauty in the 'higher' arts. III. EMPATHY At the close of the century, several important writers abandoned the subordination of orna- ment to naturalistic art and cleared the way for a very constructive interpretation of ornament and abstract form. Alois Riegl is the most notewor- thy instance of an art historian who revised the study of ornament in his first major work, Stil- fragen (1893). But the writer who was to build on and transform the discourse on form, style, empathy, and abstraction most significantly, through his public lectures and many publica- tions, was the psychologist and aesthetician, Theodor Lipps. Vischer, as we have seen, origi- nally introduced a theory of empathy in order to account for the aesthetic significance of abstract forms, and sought thereby to underscore the distinction between figurative and abstract imag- ery. Lipps, however, magnified this special case of empathy into the centerpiece of his aesthetic and championed the notion of apperception den- igrated by the formalists. In a study on the aesthetics of space, Lipps argued that what we apprehend in a spatial form is a sympathetic feeling mediated by the visual characteristics of the form such as line and sur- face.37 "Not the column," Lipps claimed, "but the spatial formation which depicts itself to us in the column, makes itself erect."38 According to Lipps, the means of representation are loosened and detached from their concrete connections to reality. There are, he asserted, many levels of detachment. We designate these levels as levels of stylization. To stylize means to make forms of reality detached from their concrete contexts in reality aesthetically intel- ligible. We do this when we successively disregard the characteristics which are peculiar to [the forms in their concrete reality] ... especially the many kinds of accidents which necessarily underlie [the forms].... What remains is a more or less general version of their</page><page sequence="5">Morgan Abstraction and German Theories of the Ornament 235 existence, a more or less general law of shaping or fonnation, or a law of their becoming. To stylize, we might therefore also say, means to release from the concrete forms of reality their more or less generally conceived law of shaping or formation and to visu- alize [the law] for itself.... All types of geometrical forms can be obtained through this successive stylization. Inversely, we are free to say that each geometrical form-the simple straight line not excluded-if not according to its historical origin, then according to its aesthetic es- sence, is stylized nature.39 In seeking to understand the dynamics of per- ception and the nature of aesthetic experience, Lipps ignored the traditional distinction between subject matter and abstract form by eliding them on a single continuum of degrees of "stylized nature." This implied that geometrical form and naturalistic form obeyed the same law, a law which was bared and made visually intelligible in the abstract form of lines and figures. This implication was further supported by Lipps when, in his major work on aesthetics (1903), he investigated the experience of "ab- stract forms" such as straight and wavy lines which appear "filled with life."40 They appear so, Lipps reasoned, because we feel life into them. This theory of empathy, for which Lipps is most well known, assumed that the ego expe- riences itself in the object by imaginatively pro- jecting itself there. Perception (Wahrnehmung) itself shows us only mere existence. On the other hand, empathy is the imaginative animation of sense perceptions,41 the conferral of unity, free- dom, and life through what Lipps called 'apper- ception.'42 In a reversal of Herbart's psychology of aesthetics, Lipps made empathy the very basis for beauty, and applied it as a fundamental psychic operation to the perception of individual lines, shapes, and colors as well as to recogniz- able representations of objects. The wavy line is beautiful, we read, "because its progression, its quicker and slower self-bending, the tension and release lying therein, is felt by me as a free activity and an exuberant feeling of my own contemplating ego sunken into the wavy line."43 By virtue of empathetic projection, every geo- metrical form possesses a determinate charac- ter.44 Color is also "lively in itself" and "dipped in mood," and only thereby does it constitute a "proper aesthetic object. "45 This gives color an inner life or power. This power or striving Lipps attributed to the viewer: "[it] is my striving, but I experience it immediately not as originating in me, but in the color and its peculiar quality."46 Each color possesses its own "character of mood" (Stimmungscharakter), but Lipps refused to enumerate them since each is determined by the individual viewer. Each person 'feels' the Stim- mung into a color.47 By understanding style as a "distancing from the simple reproduction of that which is found in nature," and by regarding empathy as the indi- vidual viewer's means of determining the beauty of even non-representational elements such as line and color, Lipps facilitated the appreciation of ornament as a self-sufficient aesthetic form.48 Yet he was not the first to do so. In 1886 Hein- rich Wdlfflin had applied a theory of empathy to architecture in his doctoral dissertation.49 En- couraged by his teacher at Basel, Johannes Vol- kelt, Wdlfflin had sought to account for the expression of a spiritual content or mood in purely architectonic forms. Wdlfflin argued that corporeal forms are significant to us because "we recognize in them the expression of a feel- ing soul. Instinctively we animate each thing."50 This animation is an impulse so primordial in humanity, Wdlfflin believed, that were it to per- ish, it would mean the very death of art. He explained this animation of the world outside of us as a subordination of all appearances to the image of our own bodies. "Our bodily organi- zation is the form under which we apprehend everything corporeal."951 And he proceeded to attempt to show that the elements of architec- ture, indeed, the very laws of aesthetics, were nothing other than the conditions under which an organic, corporeal pleasure may exist. IV. JUGENDSTIL We have traced an ongoing theoretical discourse that did not reflect the aims of artistic practice until around the turn of the century. Then, sev- eral writers, artists, and architects associated with Jugendstil architecture and design applied discussions of form, style, empathy, and ab- straction to the ornament. In 1901, the critic Karl Scheffler wrote enthusiastically that the human instinct for symmetry exhibited in ornament is the feeling of harmony pulsating through the architecture of the human body.52</page><page sequence="6">236 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism If we ask a good artist how he designs ornaments or if we watch him: he experiences them! Immersed in himself, he sits before the page and deliberates over each line with compensating movements as one listen- ing to his instinct. He suggests to his fantasy the feeling of supporting or carrying-and instantly he draws the line which releases his feeling; he exercises with his anns as if dancing on a wire-and immedi- ately he has found the symmetrical complement of a curve. This is the way that good and original orna- ments come into being.53 Ornamental design is a direct expression of feel- ing and originates in the dynamics of human anatomy. Scheffler believed that because the human body and everything organic share the same structural laws of formation, "our orga- nism is a sort of instrument whose strings are set in sympathetic vibration." This meant, he fur- ther conjectured, that ornaments-the direct ex- pressions of this sympathy-are to be found everywhere: "A drop of ink squirted in a glass of water, cigar smoke in motionless air, the wave, the plant, a waving flag, the photograph of glacial drift, bone formations, and muscle fibers-in short, ornaments are everywhere!"54 In an essay entitled "Line," published in the following year, the architect and designer Henry van de Velde, echoed Scheffler's idea of direct expression by proclaiming that "only few crea- tions stand in so direct, so close a relationship to their creator as line. "55 Van de Velde charac- terized lines as "transcribed gestures-public psychic expressions. "56 Both Scheffler and Van de Velde evince a significant debt to contempo- rary theories of empathy and to the tradition of physiognomy in formulating a model of expres- sion in which an inner force or content is visu- alized in external form. The young Munich architect, August Endell, brought both of these elements together in an important essay of 1897, which influenced both Scheffler and Van de Velde.57 It is in Endell that we find intense theoretical concerns applied to architectural practice in a way that anticipated both the art and theory of Wassily Kandinsky. 58 Endell discerned a rift between past and present: whereas architecture and crafts of the past ex- hibited their own historical stylistic features, work of the present constitutes an entirely new period of style, indeed the beginning of an art whose forms "mean nothing, depict nothing, and recall nothing, [and] excite our soul as deeply as ever music was able [to do] with tones."59 Endell insisted that "one must learn to see and to steep oneself in forms. "60 In order to appreciate "formal beauty," he claimed it was necessary to learn to see in an "isolated" fashion. Endell described a way of seeing which informed Schef- fler's passage quoted above: We must direct our view to details, to the fonn of a tree root, to the arrangement of a leaf on a stem, to the structure of tree bark, to the lines which thick foam fonns on the seashore. Nor may we glance over fonns without attention, but must follow them with our eyes-every bend, every crook, every extension, every juncture, in short, we must share in the experi- ence of every change in fonn. For we see precisely only one point in our visual field and only what we have seen clearly can become effective for our feel- ing. But if we see in this way, there will emerge before us a new, previously unknown world of immense riches. A thousand moods are wakened in us ... Nature appears to live and we grasp now that there really are sad trees, evil and malicious boughs, chaste grasses, and fearsome, horrible flowers.6' But Endell proceeded to point out that these are only appearances, and that we do not actually "animate" (beseelen) a natural phenomenon. Feelings are only aroused in us by objects. Nor is it a matter of association since we may recall any number of meanings or feelings in the pres- ence of an object. Instead, Endell suggested that there is a parallelism between essence and ap- pearance, inner and outer-that we attribute the feeling aroused in us to the "inner being of the object." He noted that we also listen to music and are moved without knowing why. In the second installment of the article, Endell ob- served how lines of various size and thickness produce different sensations in the observer and, on the premise that all feeling is a function of tempo and tension ranging from smaller to greater intensity, suggested that the effects of line and visual direction could be tabulated.62 Endell's article is fascinating on several counts. First of all, in stressing the singular focus of the "visual field," Endell recalls and then redefines an earlier attempt to characterize abstraction in terms of a determinate focus. In 1845, Johannes Andreas Romberg, a prominent Hamburg archi- tect and prolific writer on the arts, included in</page><page sequence="7">Morgan Abstraction and German Theories of the Ornament 237 the first edition of his Conversationslexicon far bildende Kunst an unprecedented entry entitled "Abstraction." Romberg defined the term as the mental activity by means of which one accepts in the formation of art works only that which corre- sponds to the detenninate artistic aim and leaves the rest unconsidered. Abstraction in this aim is therefore necessary for every artist if he does not want to miss his aim through the superfluous, excessive or idle. The artist who desires to achieve his end would learn to separate all parts, all features which do not belong essentially to the aim, which hinder the effect, which detain in an unuseful manner, which give neither emphasis nor new light, which do not accent the subject from the side that should interest us. ... for if we do not wish to see every side of the subject at once, we will be content to take notice of that which is accented, which should captivate our attention.63 Romberg's use of the term "attention" (Auf- merksamkeit) introduced contemporary physio- logical discourse into a discussion which had formerly depended more on metaphysics and epistemology. In contrast to the traditional phil- osophical distinction between "essence" and "ac- cident," "attention" was a psychological opera- tion studied in nineteenth-century physiology. In the most important contemporary study, the professor of anatomy and physiology Johannes Muller described attention as the effort of taking cognizance of "only one object at a time. "64 The mind, Muller stated, is unable to direct "an equally accurate attention to every part" of the object it surveys. "If we endeavoured to direct our attention to the whole field of vision at the same time, we should see nothing distinctly."65 In his discussion of the "visual field," Endell narrowed the focus of Romberg's concept of attention in order the more completely to isolate or abstract detailed structures in nature.66 He encouraged the viewer to learn to restrict his visual field to specific motifs which could evoke feelings without reference to or association with other objects or dimensions of experience. The pursuit of abstracting contours from nature led Endell to make these forms the sole basis of architecture and design, as his facade for the Hofatelier Elvira in Munich demonstrates. Endell's discussion is also noteworthy for the way in which he replaced contemporary notions of empathy described as 'animation' or 'anthro- pomorphism' with a theory of expression prem- ised on physiognomy. The power of form over the soul, he wrote, was "a direct, immediate influence without any intermediate member, by no means the result of an anthropomorphism or humanization [Vermenschlichung]."67 The con- cepts of animation and anthropomorphism were employed by such proponents of empathy as Volkelt, Wdfflin, and Lipps, and it has been said that Endell heard Lipps lecture at the University in Munich.68 Endell's clarification of how things "appear" to exhibit the feelings we experience suggests a firsthand knowledge of very contem- porary debates over the nature of empathy. In 1898 Paul Stern published a study on the psy- chological analysis of aesthetic perception en- titled Einfiihlung und Association in der neueren Aesthetik. 69 In it he criticized the use of the term "empathy" as metaphorical and therefore mis- leading, and argued for association as the psy- chological basis for aesthetic experience.70 By explicitly stating that 'animation' is limited to appearances (a fact which seems sufficiently obvious), Endell may have been attempting to avoid the metaphysical excesses for which Stern criticized such proponents of empathy as Vis- cher and Volkelt, who had linked empathy to pantheism .71 The first years of the twentieth century saw the critique of empathy intensified and the rec- ognition of ornament first rise and then decline. A few years after Endell's essay appeared, Ar- thur Roessler invoked physiognomy as an anal- ogy to the expressive power of line, perhaps as an alternative to the anthropomorphism of empathy: As mental processes express themselves in certain bodily gestures, artistic sensations can also be made visible as inner movement by means of line. Climbing and falling, stiff and pliant, continuous and broken, wide-reaching as well as narrowly-restricted lines are able in the same manner as bright or dim colors ... to awaken in us the basic mood of their creator.... Forms are not only important as aesthetic means, they are in fact significant as the symbolic coverings, the sensuously perceptible expressions of movements of the mind or soul.72 Roessler could thus appreciate Adolf Hoelzel's completely abstract ornamental drawings- "ab- stract in the sense of non-objective," as he said-</page><page sequence="8">238 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism as works in which "the spiritual and mental movements of the artist ... were arrested." With this non-representational view of abstraction in mind, Roessler believed that the "new modern movement in art" was not a question of stylized forms, but, "as Scheffler says, pure form, line, ornament. "7 In fact, Roessler insisted that the only genuine ornament was the "abstract" one. By abstract he meant the ornament which "organ- ically creates its form from matter in essential lawfulness."74 The natural phenomenon "styl- ized into an ornament" will never be capable, Roessler contended, of creating "the impression of an organically produced thing, of a necessity which reposes in itself."75 Instead, the stylized ornament will always remind us of the thing from which it has borrowed its form. Such an ornament will never escape the status of "deco- ration." With this assertion Roessler ruptured any idea of a continuum between naturalistic depiction and abstract style, thereby placing abstraction outside the orbit of representation. Roessler held that the necessary antecedent for non-representational art was a theory of artistic expression which allowed form to emerge "or- ganically," that is, as a direct expression of feeling, as an external correspondence to an inner sensation. Any reference to the world of objects-whether through imitation, stylization or association-would mediate this expression by placing it within the realm of representation. What mattered in the new art was the immediacy of the gesture, the direct linkage between feeling and form which 'abstract' ornament was priv- ileged to provide. While empathy had assisted in the emergence of a theory of abstract form in the work of Vischer and Lipps, the tendency to distinguish empathy and abstraction persisted. Indeed, shortly after the turn of the century, empathy was starkly opposed to abstraction in what has become ar- guably the most discussed doctoral dissertation in German art history. In his Abstraktion und Einfiihlung (1908), Wilhelm Worringer exam- ined the linear ornament and architecture of ancient, middle eastern, and medieval cultures and claimed to find in them an artistic sensibility which employed abstract linear forms for the purpose of transcending nature. Empathy corre- sponded to the aesthetic impulse that found itself at home in the world and its organic forms. Abstraction and empathy were diametrically op- posed, opposite poles of a psychology of style which even found expression in a bipolar divi- sion of Europe into north and south. Abstraction was the characteristic Kunstwollen of northern Europe. Empathy, on the other hand, applied to the naturalistic art of classicism and the Italian Renaissance. Yet scholarly discussions of Wor- ringer's thesis rarely point out that his use of the term 'abstract' by no means intended exclu- sively 'non-representational' form. Abstraction meant for Worringer any linear treatment of form, representational or otherwise, whose geo- metrical, inorganic character repudiates any as- sociation with our vital sensations as organically designed beings. Abstract form constituted any alienation from the body and a correlative yearn- ing for the transcendent. Although he is often regarded as some sort of ideologue for German Expressionist experiments in abstract painting, Worringer's notion of abstraction is not consis- tent with what Wassily Kandinsky envisioned for painting.76 Kandinsky, who had been in Munich since 1896 as an art student and artist, and was there- fore no doubt familiar with much of the critical discourse on abstraction, eventually went be- yond Worringer's definition of abstraction. Kan- dinsky showed no interest circa 1912 in restrict- ing the artist's pictorial vocabulary to the rigid geometrical patterns of ancient ornament, in which Worringer discerned an abstract 'urge to form.' By the time he published Ueber das Geistige in der Kunst (1912), Kandinsky had come to understand abstraction not in terms of ornamental girds or flat, hard-edged 'geometric regularity' (to use Worringer's expression), but as a form of imagemaking aimed at complete non-objectivity. He followed Roessler in insist- ing on a careful distinction between ornament in the past and the place for a new visual form which owed nothing to visual appearances.77 Yet, even as late as 1912, Kandinsky was cau- tious in announcing the break with represen- tation: If we begin at once to break the bonds which bind us to nature, and devote ourselves purely to combination of pure colour and abstract form, we shall produce works which are mere decoration, which are suited to neckties or carpets. Beauty of Form and Colour is no sufficient aim by itself, despite the assertions of pure aesthetes or even of naturalists, who are obsessed with</page><page sequence="9">Morgan Abstraction and German Theories of the Ornament 239 the idea of "beauty." It is because of the elementary stage reached by our painting that we are so little able to grasp the inner harmony of true colour and form composition.78 Unlike Vischer and Fechner, Kandinsky did not consider pure color and form inherently incapa- ble of serving as the basis for a non-representa- tional art, but did believe that neither artists nor the public were prepared for this revelation, although, as the apocalyptic rhetoric of his trea- tise constantly promises, the day was not far off. Were pure composition to be attempted, the result would have been a decorative art unequal to the revolutionary stature Kandinsky expected of painting. Kandinsky acknowledged that pure decoration had a "life of its own." Yet he main- tained that ornament in the past was ungoverned by inner spirit and represented what amounted to a capricious play of form unable to express any inner motive. Along side of ornament, Kandinsky also com- pared the literary genre of fable to non-natu- ralistic art, but fable also failed to serve as the basis for an art of pure harmony.79 Both orna- ment and fable were inadequate in the end as models for abstraction because both were gov- erned by external motives (i.e., the purpose of decoration and the narration of a story), which do not allow the harmony to be determined from within. Thus, Kandinsky concluded that the "new art" would have to avoid "two dangers": On the one hand is the totally arbitrary application of colour to geometrical form-pure patterning. On the other hand is the more naturalistic use of colour in bodily form-pure phantasy.80 Rather than subscribe to the elevation of the ornament in the work of Riegl and Worringer, Kandinsky returned to Vischer's and Fechner's notion of ornament in order to distance the ab- stract from the ornamental. The abstract served no other end for Kandinsky than visualizing the inner necessity of the artist. Yet this notion of autonomy was indebted to Jugendstil art theory and practice and ultimately recalls Moritz's the- ory of the ornament.8' In the end, Roessler and Kandinsky were in search of the same thing: a way of painting whose articulation of form and use of color grew out of what both men not altogether clearly characterized as the inner or spiritual workings of the creative mind. V. CONCLUSION From the late eighteenth to the early twentieth centuries theories of ornament served a vital role in debate over the scope and nature of represen- tation. Ornament inspired both the creation of formalist aesthetics and vigorous attacks against formalism, which in turn introduced the idea of empathy to explain the aesthetic effect of ab- stract forms. And ornament also served subse- quent attempts to distinguish abstraction and empathy. Finally, with Kandinsky, traditional ornament was rejected as an artistic alternative in the search for a self-contained principle. In- fluenced perhaps by Riegl's idea of the Kunst- wollen, Kandinsky called this principle the "in- ner necessity," and understood it to direct the creation of the work of art without concern for form or external appearances and solely with regard to inner meaning and idea.82 Whatever else that may have meant, Kandinsky looked for an art which did not decorate or adorn a pre- existing form, but one which occupied center stage or even orchestrated an entire Gesamt- kunstwerk. This transfigured ornament would no longer be marginalized to the status of 'mere decoration,' but could provide the locus for nothing less than an ontological disclosure, a revelation of the spiritual or metaphysical reality that Kandinsky believed loomed behind appear- ances and awaited epiphany in the imminent 'epoch of the great spiritual.'

Because this text has not been commented on heretofore that I am aware, I offer the original in full: Abstraction, eigentl. Absonderung, als philosophischer terminus tech- nicus, die Geistesthatigkeit, verrnoge welcher man bei der Bildung von Begriffen das Unwesentliche und Minderwesentliche von dem Wesentlichen absondert; in der schonen Kunst, die Geistesthatigkeit, verrnoge welcher man bei Bildung von Kunstwerken nur das dem bestimmten Kunstzwecke Entsprechende annimmt und das andere unberiicksichtigt lIsst. Abstraction in diesem Zwecke ist daherjedem Kunstler nothig, wenn er nicht Theile, all Zilge, die nicht wesentlich zum Zweck gehoren, welche die Wirkung hindern, unnutzer Weise aufhalten, nicht Nachdruck oder neues Licht geben, den Gegenstand nicht von der Seite herausheben, die uns jetzt interessiren soll, lerne der Kuinstler, der seinen Zweck erreichen will, absondern. Nur hute er sich von der dann den Fehler der Dunkelheit, Trockenheit, Kalte und einformrigen Mattigkeit vermeiden. Nicht dass abgesondert, sondern was abgesondert werde, ist es, worauf alles hier ankommt; denn wollen wir gleich nicht jede Seite des Gegenstandes zugleich sehen, so werden wir doch mit Vergnugen eben jene herausgehoben bemerken, die eben jetzt unsere Aufmerksamkeit fesseln sollte.

As a student of Lipps at the university in Munich (see note 68), Endell was certainly initiated into the scien- tific and academic discourse of perceptual psychology as suggested by his use of technical tenninology such as Sehfeld and Vermenschlichung. 67. Endell, "Die Freude an der Form," p. 76: "Das ist die Macht der Form uber unser Gemut, ein direkter unmit- telbarer Einfluss ohne alle Zwischenglieder, durchaus nicht etwa die Folge eines Anthropomorphismus, einer Vermen- schlichung." 68.

In contrast to the common assumption that Kandinsky owed a great debt to Worringer's Abstraktion und Ein- fahlung, it is in fact likely that he had not read the book before Ueber das Geistige was first published in 1912, see Norbert Lynton, "Expressionism," in Concepts of Modern Art, ed. Nikos Stangos (London: Thames and Hudson, 1981), pp. 42-43.

In a similar manner, Kant's distinction between free and dependent beauty is recalled in Riegl's contention that the basic laws of a period's Kunstwollen are more clearly expressed in architecture and the crafts than in figurative works of sculpture and painting because the presence of content in the latter distracts the modern viewer with his preoccupation with message, Riegl, Spatromische Kunstin- dustrie, 2 ed (1927; reprint, Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1973), p. 19; reiterated by Worringer, Abstraction and Empathy.
