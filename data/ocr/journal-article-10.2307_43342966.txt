<plain_text><page sequence="1">161 ON SOME TRENDS IN FIELD APPROACH IN LINGUISTICS The aim of this paper is to analyze the fundamental conceptions on the field and the initial assumptions which led to this conception. In spite of justified criticism,1 the conception of the field is being utilized with in- creasing frequency and applied to different phenomena.2 This justifies the desire to understand whether the different conceptions of field are reducible to the same assumptions and whether these assumptions are of linguistic origin or of some other. The latter alternative seems at first thought to be not without justification, inasmuch as the concept "field" belongs, in the first instance, to physics, not, however, exclusively since it has been used already for a long time in psychology and in biology. In particular, J. C. Smuts uses this concept to denote peripheral phenomena. "The con- cept of 'fields' is absolutely necessary in order to get back to the fluid, plastic facts of nature . . . Concepts were in logic as well as in science narrowed down to their most luminous points and the rest of their contents treated as non-existent . . . One of the most salutary reforms in thought which could be effected would be for people to accustom themselves to the ideal of fields, and to look upon every concrete thing of person or even ab- stract idea as merely a center, surrounded by zones or aurae or spheres of the same nature as the center, only more attenuated and shading off into indefiniteness".3 In recent years, the concept "field" has also been used in sociology.4 It apparently follows that one can hardly maintain that the appearance of 1 W.

SČUR the field concept in different sciences, including linguistics, is no more than a consequence of a mechanical transfer from physics.1 Further, there are theories in physics and in the above mentioned sciences, as well as in linguistics, which do not recognize this category as a legitimate one or interpret in a different manner. The reasons for rejecting this concept in the various sciences is always apparently the same. First, the term "field" denotes phenomena whose nature varies; second, there are too many de- finitions of the concept itself that are often applied to other concepts.2 Nevertheless, both the number of disciplines where the concept "field" is utilized and the number of definitions are constantly growing. In conse- quence, the use of the term "field" assumes a pandemic character. It seems that a situation of this sort hardly deserves such a skeptical atti- tude. There is more justification for attempts, incidentally long since under- taken, to construct a general field theory 3 as well as for attempts to create a general systems theory;4 also a generalized theory, in which both "field" and "system" would be not interchangeable but utilized for designating different phenomena, characterizing an object from different points of view, providing, of course, that an empirical and logical basis exists for such attempts. It goes without saying that the possibility of constructing general field and system theories will be more realistic after corresponding theories are created in the separate disciplines, or at least when (and if) such theories can be reduced (or an attempt is made to reduce them) to common foundations. At any rate, it is evident that the study of the field concept or field phenomena in particular disciplines is hardly justified without analyzing it in other disciplines. Moreover, work devoted to field theories in a given discipline can be of interest not only to representatives of that discipline but to many others. In consequence, it seems that, at present, investigations of importance to linguistics are not only those that have the term "field" in their titles or 1 For such treatment see: S.

It may happen that, in a work devoted to field theories in linguistics, a positive conception is presented, and from the point of view of this conception all other conceptions are considered erroneous. This is frequently observed but it is hardly always justified, inasmuch as the earlier conceptions analyzed are simply different from the one proposed. This, however, does not mean that those conceptions are wrong. In many cases they are merely one-sided. In another approach, the positive part is presented separately, following a survey of literature by authors. This approach frequently amounts to a more or less biased over- emphasis of so-called errors in the work of others. A survey of literature as such must, of course, be included, and it doubtless has cognitive value for the reader. However, it seems to us that the cognitive aspect can and must be combined with an attempt at re-interpretation (if possible) of the mater- ial which gave rise to the earlier conceptions. Also the work of the author in question must be presented objectively, and his views must be presented without bias, not only his linguistic views, inasmuch as the field concept, widespread as it is today, has become a gnoseological category. Thus it becomes necessary to introduce it into a given discipline in the process of an investigation, not only in accordance with personal taste or the traditions of the given discipline, but also in view of broader considerations. Such an approach, it seems, demands first of all that the concept not be confused with others and that its introduction be empirically rooted. The approach chosen in the present paper is that of analyzing different field theories, not according to their authors, but according to the methods of interpreting material. Next, we shall examine the work of authors who because of differing initial assumptions consider themselves to be polar opposite. In practice, it turns out that in the linguistic treatment of material, especially in the selection of material, distinctions among the given authors are not so numerous. At the bases of the approach is a hypothesis concerning the inclusion of an element into one of a set of groups and concerning the existence of several types of groups in a given language. This hypothesis, whose logical and empirical bases were discussed elsewhere,1 is a purely inguistic one. 1 G. S.

In the disciplines where group theory is utilized, the nomenclature is different from that in linguistics, because of the nature of the empirical data they deal with.

The latter, in view of its anthropomorphic character, can at best be interpreted as one of the reflections of the invariance principle.2 Besides, several concepts, that of function, for instance, are considered in the above approach not in the same way as in mathematics. This is also the case with concepts like system, structure, etc. Doubtless the approach is, in any case, only one of several possible. It is, nevertheless, justified by the fact that it enables us to distinguish among several important concepts, which is in itself important and not easy. Besides, an approach of this sort can serve as a method of research which makes it unnecessary to confuse linguistic and extra-linguistic categories when there is no need to confuse them. The approach is also applicable in the analysis of different levels as well as of the relations among them. It is also characterized by the demand of data analysis and, at any rate, can be supported only by an empirical and logical basis. If eventually it requires a mathematical interpretation and a corresponding apparatus, data will in any case play a principal role while nomenclature of groups and types, because of the specificity of language, will turn out to be different from that of other disciplines, including those where the group-theoretical approach is considered to be basic and had replaced the abstract theory of sets. Another important feature of the approach in question is that it is sup- ported by principles of functionality and invariance and admits a de- liberate combination of the two. At the same time, it demands the distinc- tion of different types of functions and invariances in a language. The latter is of special importance inasmuch as the phenomenon of invariance is frequently interpreted as a mathematical concept despite its empirical 1 E. Coseriu.

SČUR nature, although its appearance in linguistics originated back in the Kazan school.1 Besides, the concept of invariance is not the same as the pheno- menon of invariance, as any concept is not the same as a phenomenon. A concept is a logical category, a phenomenon, a material one. Conse- quently, various types of invariance of objects relevant to a particular science is one thing, while the concept of invariance, common to all sciences, is another. Hence, the principle of invariance, where we deal with grouping elements on the basis of their common properties, parameters, or distinctive features, is by no means the same as the integrating principle, inasmuch as the principle of invariance assumes the existence of general material ele- ments while the integrating principle only reflects the fact of the unity of elements. At the basis of this principle may be either the communality of properties (the invariance principle) or the communality of functions (the principle of functionality) as well as the associative principle. As is known, the concept of the semantic field appeared first in the work of G. Ipsen in 1924.2 However, according to J. Trier and E. A. Nida,3 the field approach, based on the study of groups of words with related meanings, goes back to W. Humboldt 4 and G. Osthoff.5 This approach has also been represented in the works of B. Snell 6 and many others. J. Trier is usually credited with pointing out the distinction between a lexical and a conceptual field, and he has introduced this term into lin- guistics. In replying to a criticism, Trier has often insisted, particularly in 1968, 7 that his approach was dictated not by philosophical or linguistic considerations but by purely practical ones. He was interested primarily in 1 R. O.

In his opinion, the existence of common meanings of a given group of words can serve as a criterion. However, to the extent that in their other meanings the same words enter other groups, he thought it would be more reliable to take what was later called a "com- mon notion" or an "enigmatic absolute" 1 insofar as this made it possible to define a boundary between the given group of lexemes and others. The discrepancy in the terms used to denote this collection in his works is explained, according to Trier, by the circumstances that for a long time he could not find a suitable term. Only when he found the term "semantic field" in the writings of G. Ipsen was he enlightened, inasmuch as this term reflected, in his opinion, the idea of a common semantic symptom and seemed applicable to a group of lexemes. Nevertheless, he has always thought of this term as a metaphor, but one backed by definite empirical data and a definite method of analysis. Further, Trier consideres that the use of this term in this sense is quite admissible in other disciplines, if they are characterized by a similar approach to data.2 1 V. A. Zvegintsev, Semasiologia.

SČUR It goes without saying that the initial approach to data and the sub- sequent treatment by this author are different events. The initial approach may be dictated by practical aims; yet its interpretation depends on the general linguistic and philosophical conception of the investigator, which is what happened in the case of Trier, as is well known. Nevertheless, the circumstance that Trier had many followers, whether as direct disciples or as users of his methods,1 evidently attests to something in this method and approach that corresponds to the spirit of the times and to practical pro- blems, something that could not be cast out in spite of so-called inadequacies of his conception. "So-called" because they could be explained not by something that Trier did not take into account but rather by the fact that, in the context of the problems posed by Trier, certain aspects did not need to be considered. Thus, in particular, Trier is criticized for having considered only nominal formations and for the incompleteness of data characterizing fields, which is typical of Ipsen. Besides, Trier left polysemy out of account and in consequence the boundaries of his fields are artificial. At least W. Betz 2 thought so, also H. Sperber 3 in his review of a book by K. Reuning. In contrast, Sperber says a virtue in Reuning's book is that Reuning analyzes modern English and German and that he recognizes the 1 T.

By-passing Trier's and Reuning's followers, whose number is increasing every year,2 it seems possible to juxtapose the approaches of both scholars, even though they both view their approaches as different, which is certainly true but not in essential aspects. Certainly Trier begins with concepts, but so does Reuning. How do Trier's with their meaning of reason, etc.3 differ in principle from those of Reuning with their meaning of joy? Both reason and joy are logical notions, but both denote definite real events and are reflected as are other notions in language. Therefore, these notions serve as a boundary only in the selection of material. Here Reuning leans on psychology, which he feels is more reliable, and takes the term "field" 4 from it (and from biology). Reuning, relying on the gradation of positive and negative emotions, worked out in psychology, examines groups of words denoting different kinds of positive emotions in English and in German. These are the sources of his gradations of emotions, distinguished as deep or superficial, tense or relaxed, directed and undirected, etc. In principle, the approach does not seem to differ essentially from Trier's inasmuch as it is extralinguistic in both cases, although Trier's has a logical flavor and Reuning's a psychological one. Without going into details, even though they may be important from the point of view of conceptions com- mon to both investigators, we should evidently turn our attention to what Reuning considers to be the main thing, namely that for him words, from 1 K.

For Trier, on the other hand, the word and its charac- teristics depend on its locus in the system, or, as he says, on its locus in the field. Nevertheless, in practice Reuning does not indicate overlapping classes; he refers to the dictionary. This is quite natural, since any word he examines by most of its meanings enters different groups, which do not interest Reuning. The reference to the dictionary and the analysis of lists by Reuning and Trier and their followers shows that many lexemes ex- hibited by them have common meanings, although they may not be the fundamental ones. Nevertheless, most lexemes do not have such common meanings; they are characterized only by a common function in the sense that they, like the lexemes with common meanings, are used for denoting the different aspects of man's intellectual and emotional life. The presence of only a common function is especially evident when grammatical means are used to communicate emotions. Nevertheless, inspite of this, both Trier and Reuning characterize a field by the presence of common meanings of lexemes that are included in it. An approach close to that of Trier and Reuning, based not on logical or psychological but rather on purely physical criteria and which, according to E. Coseriu,1 can be considered as a field approach is noted already in the work of K. W. Heyse2 (1956) devoted to the analysis of a group of words denoting a sound. Heyse bases his categorization on an extralinguistic scale of sounds, including spreading and non-spreading, directed, undirected, reflected, homogeneous, heterogeneous, audible, self-produced, not self- produced, etc. He analyzes corresponding groups of words denoting such sounds. The same hypothesis concerning the presence of common compon- ents in the lexemes of a given group, (while linguistic and extralinguistic meanings remain undistinguished) is taken (under the influence of A. L. Kroeber,3 at least in U.S.A.) as a basis of fields of kinship terms,4 names of 1 E. Coseriu, "Zur Vorgeschichte der strukturellen Semantik: Heyses Analyse des Wortfeldes "schall", " To Honor R.

These called for as- sumptions of distinctive features, such as age, blood relationship, the spec- trum, etc. in spite of the fact that these distinctive features are extra- linguistic. Besides, the number of distinctive features itself is too limited for them to be a reliable support in the analysis of all the aspects of the phenomena in question. Evidently the structure of kinship terms and their number depend on social structure. As for distinguishable hues, if E. A. Nida is to be believed, there are about ten million of them. Yet there are only a few thousand names of colors in particular languages, for ex- ample, about three thousand in English. Non-specialists typically use about 1 1 basic terms for colors.3 Still, one could not seriously consider the appe- arance of the above mentioned types of fields in linguistic literature as the result of some one's failing to understand something or having become confused. It seems more reasonable to see it as a reflection of a general tendency to reveal phenomena that unite different events and to establish invariants. It is quite natural that many subtleties and details are omitted in the process. At the present time, as a certain artificiality in interpreting heterogeneous and homogeneous groups is being ever more clearly re- cognized, and as the differentiation of different types of meanings is quite justifiably acknowledged 4 (at least in U.S.A.), it is hardly proper to denote an arbitrary group of lexemes by the term "field". Obviously, terms de- noting diseases, colors, parts of the body have something in common, but this "something" is a function both from the linguistic and from the J.

It is hardly the case that head and arm, con- sumption and hemorrhoids have common linguistic distinctive features in the same way as father and mother, and can be juxtaposed to each other. One can convince oneself of this by looking into a dictionary and noting the wealth of meanings of these words. It is also hardly the case that these terms are synonymous, which is what is postulated as a necessary attribute of units of many fields and what has generated many words, where syno- nyms are considered from the field point of view. This is not an arbitrary approach to the question but a natural consequence of a particular treat- ment of the notion of "field". On the other hand the approach does not solve either problem. The interpretation of synonyms as units having a common distinctive feature, while different from former treatments of this notion, still is con- fronted with several difficulties, first of all because in this case synonymy is identified with invariance. Thus either everything becomes synonymous in a language or there is no synonymy as such. If synonyms are units with a common distinctive feature, which it would be more logical to call an integrating or an invariant characteristic, then phonemes, which have such a feature or features in common, are also synonyms,1 as well as words with a common suffix, prefix, or root, this being the way the phenomenon is interpreted in many cases and denoted by the term "morphosemantic field".2 Characteristically, the conception of the morphosemantic field, as many other conceptions, is based on the notion of a common distinctive feature, regardless of whether it is semantic (related to content) or morpho- logical (related to expression). Aside from the fact that these two kinds of invariance should be differentiated, one notes in the concept of morpho- semantic field the same peculiarity as in other field theories, namely the identification of the notion "common property" with "common function". All lexemes denoting a "cat" 3 in different dialects have - aside from that meaning and regardless of presence or absence of a common etymological basis - specific lexical meanings. According to these lexical meanings, 1 G. S. Sčur, "Some Thoughts About Synonymy in Language," Orbis, 1973, No. 22. In print. 2 P. Guiraud, La sémantique , 2e ed. Paris, 1959; P.

As a reflection of a tendency to take into account also the functional aspect of phenomena, we have the appearance of the following notions: grammatical, lexico-grammatical, functional-semantic, transformational, and relational fields.1 However, a paradoxical situation arises in this connection. This situation is generated not by the fact that categories which had been inter- preted as conceptual are now justifiably considered to be linguistic ones, but rather by the circumstance that what O. Jespersen 2 had once been charged with (mixing lexicon and grammar) is now called the "interaction of levels" and is considered as a virtue of this conception. This may be so. Yet the bases upon which functional-semantic fields and categories are postulated do not seem quite justified if oppositions are laid at the founda- tion and then one speaks of interactions. Be that as it may, what has hap- pened to "system", the term that has served so many years for denoting events that are now called fields and which was introduced to define the events now called fields on the same basis as fields are defined? An approach of this kind is hardly justified if such important concepts disappear from it without a trace. Besides, there are concepts not only of "oppositions" but also of "connections" and "relations". There are also events that are connected and related. What is one to do about these events? Still, even in the indicated approach, certain tendencies are beginning to appear (noted in other conceptions) toward revealing common properties of different objects. The explicit formulation of the functional aspect is indicated. The conceptions of field based on extralinguistic characteristic of an 1 V. G. Admoni, Osnovy Grammatiki.

A somewhat different direction is represented by a treatment of field where this term denotes a lexeme, for instance, "bachelor" in its totality of dictionary2 meanings (unmarried man, baccaulaureate, seal) or "to cut", whose semantic field is constructed of all the meanings of this lexeme in the different dialects.3 Another direction is represented by the conception of field stemming from W.

It is not possible within the scope of this article to analyze the work of particular authors.

Data have always made this approach necessary in spite of the distinctions among the general conceptions of particular authors. However, because some group types turn out to be homogeneous, nor are the principles underlying the grouping of elements the same, it becomes necessary today to attempt a synthesis in which heterogeneous elements are not mixed. It is not productive simply to substitute the term "group" for "field", as, incidentally, has been long since proposed,1 any more than to substitute "field" for "system", as is now current. Evidently, it will be fruitful to introduce "group" only if it is possible to establish a hierarchy of concepts and events mentioned above, which these terms would denote, and if it is possible to establish the relations of these concepts to those of class, paradigmatics, etc.; also if a re-interpretation of old data and the analysis of new material from the point of view of this approach will lead us to an understanding of the ontology of language. It seems that only when we have analyzed the nature of the different groups can we consider certain characteristic events as attributes and a function of what is denoted by "field". Then, on the basis of logical and empirical foundations, we shall reasonably call a given event a field without confusing it with apparently similar but essentially different events. Consequently, it is not justified - at any rate, not adequate - to consider a general distinctive feature as an attribute of a field if this feature turns out to be both a linguistic one and an extralinguistic one. Besides, such a fea- ture is easily confused with a general function, thus leveling the nature of Ergebnisse, wenn ich zuvor Bedeutungen kenne und daher beurteilen, kann ob ich ein Wort oder zwei Wörter vor mir habe. Die Infinitive reissen und reisen unterscheiden sich nur durch Stimmlosigkeit und Stimmhaftigkeit ihres mittleren Konsonanten. Da ich die Bedeutungen kenne, weiss ich, dass es zwei verschiedene Wörter sind, und erst daraus schliesse ich, dass die deutsche Sprache zwei ¿-Phoneme hat, ein stimmloses und ein stimmhaftes s.

SGUR different groups in the mind of the investigator. How shall heterogeneous groups be interpreted in that case? What, then, is a field and does it exist in language? Evidently, in view of being different from other objects, in the first instance physical ones, the field, if such a phenomenon is characteristic of language, must have a specific nature and at the same time must be some- thing general. Quite possibly, the viability of the term "field" in linguistics is partly explained by the use of this term in physics, and this is reflected in some definitions of "field" in linguistics, clearly bearing the stamp of physics. Compare the definition of this concept in physics: 1 "The term cfielď is usually used in physics to denote a region of space (or the entire space) in which some physical phenomenon is examined. Thus, for ex- ample, the temperature of air in different points of space constitutes a field of temperature, and atmospheric pressure constitutes a pressure field. An electric charge creates an electrostatic field around itself. A force acts on each electric charge placed at some point of the field, this force being fully determined in magnitude and direction (Gulon's Law). There are many examples of this sort. In all cases, when we speak of a process characterized by a scalar magnitude (temperature, pressure, etc.) the field is called a scalar field. If we consider a process characterized by a vector magnitude, as in the case of an electrostatic field, the field is called a vector field. A vector can always be regarded as a force. Therefore a vector field is called also a force field. These examples elucidate the origin of the field concept in mathematics". Echoes of the physical interpretation are clearly observed in the work of many linguists, when they speak of force lines, also in the sociological con- ception of field.2 Is it, however, always permissible to speak of a mechanical transfer of this concept into the corresponding disciplines? Besides, the question remains why did this concept arise in physics just in the nineteenth century? As is known, the concept was first introduced into physics by Max- well 3 and evidently already reflected a structural-functional approach, characteristic of the second half of the nineteenth century. Quite naturally, in physical applications the form of the concept was different from that in other sciences. Nevertheless, this approach is by no means always carried 1 1. A.

We keep observing deviations, now towards the structural, now towards the functional side. Compare, for example, the direction of functionalism in modern sociology, where they speak of systems and do not mention the field,1 and field theories, where systems are not mentioned. It seems that the above mentioned leaning to one side or the other ex- plains the synonymous usage of "structure", "system", and "field", characteristic not only of linguistics. At the same time, the fact that this concept is unseparable from the analysis of collections or ensembles 2 of elements justifies approaching any phenomena from the point of view of groups, whether the investigations are based on a mathematical inter- pretation of structure or on empirical data. Even if both system and field are viewed as functional formations, it is hardly correct to identify these concepts and to substitute the field approach for the structural-functional. Possibly an attempt to combine the two approaches is more justified, especially because the structural-functional approach cannot be separated from the group approach, that is, from an investigation of groups and classes of elements and their interactions, which has been long pointed out in definite directions of philosophy. In contrast, the group approach, particularly in the analysis of what is called a field in physics, is just be- ginning to take root and is considered as a great achievement of corres- ponding field theories. See, for example, R. Utiyama's 3 field theory, where he groups elementary particles according to whether they have the same spin, i.e., on the basis of what linguists call a "general distinctive feature", which makes it possible to speak of invariant groups. In this way, we may speak of a rather paradoxical situation, namely that, while the appearance of the field in linguistics was in some measure due to the influence of physics, the group-theoretic approach was represented in linguistics long before it appeared in physics. It is because of this that the field is treated in lin- guistics in a different way. A shortcoming of this approach in linguistics is the hypertrophy of the role of the unifying feature, as a result of which extralinguistic characteristics were viewed as this sort of feature and a general feature was postulated for groups of elements that did not possess it, 1 D.

SČUR inasmuch as the unification of such elements into a group was based on a functional principle. This led to insufficient attention being paid to the structural-functional principle and to a one-sided emphasis of structure. The ignoring of the functional aspect is manifested first of all in the failure to view any group as a functional one. In consequence, the grouping of elements on the basis of common properties can be viewed as only one of possible principles of grouping. That this onesidedness is a theoretical rather than a practical one is an extenuating circumstance, to the extent that, in practice, analysis was applied to groups having either a real com- munality of properties and functions or having in actuality general func- tions and general properties and interactions attributed to them, while there were interactions and connections among the elements of some groups and relations among other (functional) ones. Possibly it was the striving to see interactions everywhere that led to the spread of the term "field", inasmuch as the presence of interactions was considered an attribute of a field. However, there are different kinds of interactions. What is applicable to micro-objects is, as is known, not applicable to macro-objects. Thus, if the field approach in physics is a manifestation of a structural-functional approach, it does not follow that it is identical with the structural-functional approach in sociology and in other disciplines, where interactions different from those in physics are studied. At any rate, even if the types of interactions are identical, their realization has many specificities. In this way, the removal of the system concept from corresponding disciplines appears unjustified, as is its identification with an object or its replacement by the term "field". Besides, the concept "system" can hardly be treated differently in different disciplines, in particular as a network of oppositions, which is at the same time considered as an indispensable attribute of a field. From the point of view of the structural-functional approach, any group and collection of elements, regardless of the principle underlying its unifi- cation, has a definite structure, topology, and definite functions. Here the principles of grouping may be both the principle of invariance or a func- tional principle and a combination of these. Besides, a function may be both a structural one and a communicative one with variations, e.g. esthetic, emotional, etc. At the same time, the function of a field, or what can possibly be called a field, may be manifested in attraction: because a given group of elements with a common feature exists, it includes not only new elements</page><page sequence="19">Field Approach in Linguistics 179 with the same feature, but also, the feature itself having a syntagmatic origin, is fixated in the given element, which might not have happened if there were not a corresponding group, so that this element would have been included in another group; in which case, another distinctive feature would have been fixated in it, invariant with respect to the common feature of this group.1 Such a phenomenon is noted in both phonology and in the lexicon. It is manifested partly in the re-grouping of elements when the defining distinctive feature is changed, which leads at times to quite cardinal restructuring. For a treatment of the phenomenon, which we call here "at- traction", as a repulsion of the system identified with the group, see V. A. Zvegintzev's remarks:2 "The exclusion of particular words from a system can take place according to both lexico-semantic and grammatical features. Thus, as a consequence of a radical or particular change of meaning (for instance the appearance of a new lexico-semantic variant and the extinction of the old one) a word may deviate entirely from the meaning which had bound it to the system. As a result it is thrown out of the system and remains outside the inertial influence of the semantic development of the system. In the Middle-High-German period "list" was included in the system wisheit , kunst, Sinnlichkeit , etc. Later, however, this word took an independent path of development, deviating ever more in the direction of a gradually developing new lexico-semantic variant. As a result, list, having taken its place alongside of words like Betrug , Schlauheit , Kniff ' Falschheit , Intrige , Bueberei (see also formations with - list : Arglist , Frauenlist , Hinterlist , etc.) did not go through the above mentioned general semantic change, which occured in the system wise-kluoc ". Thus, if the presence of a general distinctive feature in given elements and the phenomenon of attraction are considered a characteristic of a field, then certain functionally invariant groups always appear as fields in the lexicon, inasmuch as not only the presence of a common (invariant) feature but also the presence of a communicative or structural function is characteristic of the elements of the groups in question. The presence of the same characteristic in phonemes permits us to speak of either invariant groups (fields) or functionally-invariant groups, in case the unification of phonemes on the basis of an invariant feature is characterized by a function, 1 See another treatment of "attraction" by St. Ullmann, "Semantic Universais," in Universais of Language , Cambridge, 1963. 2 V. A. Zvegintsev, Semasiología. Moscow, 1957, p. 289.</page><page sequence="20">180 G. S. SČUR for instance, a structural one. As examples of purely invariant groups we can, evidently, consider unifications of lexemes made on the basis of a common distinctive feature when the lexemes represent inter-class relations, such as red - redness - to blush - attractively. On another basis (a func- tional one) , all of these lexemes are included in several classes, called parts of speech. Regardless of whether we call the unions according to an in- variant principle a "field" or according to a functional one a "class", it is evident that these groups intersect. What according to some investigators could be called a field covers several classes and, therefore, is not the same as a class.1 At any rate, it is hardly possible to deny the existence of two principles of grouping and to view them as homogeneous, called both a "system" or a "field". From the point of view of presence or absence of attraction, the groups characterized only by a communality of affixes or roots,2 among whose elements there is no attraction, can evidently be justly viewed as invariant or as functionally invariant groups, provided a given affix has a structural function in the sense that it indicates the related- ness of the given words to a definite structural type or to a given semantic or functional group. See the kinship terms in the Germanic languages. In Russian, for instance, a group like the name of an actor is a functionally invariant one, in spite of the presence in it of numerous suffixes of the name of the actor, inasmuch as all of them are characterized by a common distinctive semantic feature and a common function. The same groups, as terms denoting fishes, furniture, weapons, the landscape, trees, or kinship,3 which in most languages do not have common distinctive linguistic features and often no common extralinguistic features (for what do the terms "pistol" and "dagger" have in common besides a common function, that of weapons?), are reasonably viewed as neither systems, nor fields, but rather as purely functional groups, comprised entirely of extralinguistic factors. In this way, from the point of view expressed, functionally semantic groups representing a union of lexemes with common meanings and func- tions are a special case of functionally invariant groups. Further, if synonyms 1 E. Coseriu, "Lexikalische Solidaritäten," Poetka , München, 1967, Bd. I, Hf. 3. 2 M. Konradt-Hicking, "Wortfeld oder Bedeutungsfeld (Sinnfeld)," Zeüsc"nß für vergleichende Sprachforschung auf dem Gebiete der indogermanischen Sprachen , Göttingen, 1956, Bd. 73, Hf. 1-2. 3 See bibliography above.</page><page sequence="21">Field Approach in Linguistics 181 are treated as units, coinciding not completely but only occasionally, and if we take account that in such coincidences the given units are endowed with a certain stylistic, emotional, or esthetic function, then synonyms too can apparently be viewed as synchronous functionally invariant groups. In the same way, former conceptual categories, if we start with their representation in language, can be viewed as functionally invariant cate- gories, while functionally semantic categories can be viewed as a special case of the former. For the time being, however, it seems more reasonable to speak not of functionally semantic categories or fields but rather of functionally invariant groups, even though this is evidently associated with several difficulties. Yet it is obvious that fields or groups of this kind by no means always have a grammatical center. Compare, for example, the absence of such center in the totality of means that serve to express causa- tive, purposeful, or other relations. The answer to the question, to what extent such groups and totalities can be justifiably viewed as relatio- nal or other kinds of field can be otherwise interpreted, depends, first of all, on the answer to the question, what is a field in a language and how is it related to a system? For it is clear that the phenomena interpreted by W. Porzig and his followers as fields are more justifiably interpreted as systems, since the type of interactions among their elements is not the same as elsewhere. Further, we observe in this case the interaction among the elements of different groups and classes and among dissimilar groups and classes. In quite the same way, as noted above, the interaction among members of classes, called parts of speech, and among different parts of speech, is also of a different kind. On the other hand, we note relations of a different sort among elements of different parts of speech and classes that have common bases, if of semantic distinctive features. Here the function of unions of this sort is more probably a structural one. At any rate, the existence of heterogeneous groups and types of unions of elements into groups makes it unjustified to ignore these distinctions and justifies an attempt to understand their specifics. Such an attempt, however, can be fruitful only in the framework of a broader approach. Moscow G. S. SČUR</page></plain_text>
