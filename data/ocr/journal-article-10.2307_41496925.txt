HODDER Abstract: This paper considers some of the arguments in Cauvin's book Naissance des divinités, Naissance de l'agriculture in the light of new research conducted at Çatalhõyiik regarding the role of religion in the Neolithic. This research has brought together anthropologists , philosophers and religious scholars to work with archaeologists in answering four questions all of which have been inspired by Cauvin's work. The questions deal with (1) the definition and archaeological recognition of religion, (2) the relationships between religion and social and economic change, (3) the role of new forms of human agency in the domestication of animals, and (4) the part played by symbolism of violence and death in the formation of settled village life. The evidence and discussion of Çatalhõyiik lead to new insights in all these domains. Résumé: À la lumière des recherches récentes à Çatalhõyiik, relatives au rôle de la religion, cet article examine quelques-unes des hypothèses exposées dans l'ouvrage de Cauvin, Naissance des divinités, Naissance de l'agriculture. Ces études ont rassemblé anthropologues, philosophes et spécialistes de la religion pour s'attacher, avec la collaboration des archéologues, à répondre à quatre questions, toutes inspirées par l'œuvre de Cauvin. Elles concernent : 1) la définition et la reconnaissancen archéologique de la religion; 2) les relations entre religion et transformation sociale et économique; 3) le rôle des nouvelles formes d'action humaine dans la domestication des animaux; 4) la part du symbolisme de la violence et de la mort dans la formation des communautés villageoises. Les découvertes et les discussions apportées par les travaux à Çatalhõyiik fournissent de nouveaux points de vue dans tous ces domaines.

Jacques Cauvin's ideas, particularly as presented in his book Naissance des divinités, Naissance de Г agriculture,1 have only gained in importance as new data and theories have emerged. As regards new data, remarkable new discoveries at sites such as Gõbekli and Körtik Tepe reinforce the importance of the subtitle of Cauvin's book, La Révolution des symboles au Néolithique . The new sites show that the appearance of the Neolithic in the Middle East is associated with an explosion of symbolism not unlike the cultural explosion that marks the start of the Upper Palaeolithic in Europe. As regards new theo- 1.

This is not to ignore the increasingly strong arguments for climatic change as a relevant factor,6 2. DONALD, 1991. 3. Renfrew and Scarre, 1998. 4. E.g., Bender, 1978. 5. HODDER, 1990. 6.

Cauvin's argument concerning the first formation of set- tled villages was neatly encapsulated in the French title of the book - the birth of agriculture is linked to the birth of divini- ties. In summary, the increased intervention in the environment associated with agriculture implied to Cauvin a human agency that is derived from envisaging the power of personal divinities. To be more specific, he saw it as very important that the revolu- tion of symbols occurred before the first agricultural communi- ties. He saw the Khiamian in the Levantine core as key to this argument since it indicated "a change in collective psychology which must have preceded and engendered all the others in the matter of the process of neolithisation".7 In the Khiamian there is already a symbolism of raptors, but especially of the bull and a woman. Reading backwards from Çatalhõyiik and from historical Mesopotamia and Egypt, he saw this symbolism and its later development in PPNA as centering around a Goddess flanked by a male partner in the form of a bull. The emergence of divinities in human form was not, he argued, found in the Natufian, nor in the Upper Palaeolithic. In the latter, for exam- ple, there were collections of mammoths shown in the Franco- Cantabrian cave art, but not a mammoth god. The Neolithic images were of supreme beings and they suggested a new psy- chology of the human being dominated by a divine personified force which looked down. The bull was seen as representing a masculine anthropomorphic god, and by confronting this, man's virility became productive and civilizing.8 Humans thus could see themselves as separate from external reality9 and then act upon it so as to transform and domesticate. The revolution in action (the domestication of plants) resulted from the revolu- tion of symbols. The symbolic shift to the woman/bull system occurred before cattle were dominant in the middle Euphrates. The initial change was "a purely mental development".10 Hence the title of the book: it was the birth of divinities in human form that created the agency and the alienated sense of self11 that were necessary for agriculture. A question that is immediately raised by Cauvin's account is "what causes the mental shift?" Cauvin did not appear to answer this question, except for a passing reference to some group psychology of dissatisfaction.12 At times he argued 7. Cauvin, 2000: 23. 8. Ibid.: 124. 9. Ibid.: 209. 10. Ibid.: 32. 11. Ibid. : 209. 12. Ibid.: 65. against a single cause for domestication. Rather, he saw13 a continual cycle of interactions between population size, cli- mate, collective life, domestication, and the imagination. But most of the time he was so concerned to react against climatic, economic, and power factors that he got backed into the cor- ner of arguing for a causal and chronological primacy for the psycho-cultural. The mental shift came first and was the most important. But by so separating off the mental from all other domains it became impossible to explain the symbolic fluores- cence at all. The imagination and the group psychology just changed, for no apparent reason. In this way he departed from the medieval historians of the Annales School that he cited (Duby, Le Goff and Dumézil) and unwittingly embraced a reductionist position. Right at the end of the postscript to his 2000 book, Cauvin appeared to realise that he had gone too far and he apologised for putting too much emphasis on the symbolic at the expense of the economic. He said14 that he may have over-emphasised the symbolic as a strategic reaction against a pervasive and dominant economic view. Instead, the symbolic and the eco- nomic "are simply two faces, interior and exterior, of a single revolution".15 The primacy of the mental or symbolic shift is in any case difficult since the domestication of plants and animals is a long drawn-out process with no clear beginning. It is thus difficult to say which came first, domestication or the symbolic revolution. Similar conclusions are reached if we consider Cauvin's account of later developments in the Neolithic of the Middle East. Cauvin treated at some length the spread of the PPNB. He saw this as a movement of people from the middle Euphra- tes, sometimes integrating into local cultures, and introduc- ing rectangular architecture, herding, and the 'skull cult' into, for example, Anatolia and the central and southern Levant between 8600 ВС and 7000 ВС. He then discussed a further spread of the Neolithic in the later PPNB and Pottery Neolithic between 7500 ВС and 6300 ВС. This was seen as a 'great exo- dus' of people who now moved into semi-arid landscapes and into Cyprus. He described the spread as a colonisation, even messianic in tone.16 Once again, Cauvin shunned climatic, population pressure and economic explanations for these expansionist movements. In moving towards a psycho-cultural alternative, he described the internal cultural characteristics that made the PPNB a 13. Ibid. 14. Ibid.: 220. 15. Ibid. 16. Ibid.: 205.

HODDER</page><page sequence="3">The role of religion in the Neolithic of the Middle East and Anatolia with particular reference to Çatalhôyûk 113 'conquering culture'.17 He took various aspects of the PPNB and identified an underlying whole. First, there was the bull cult which showed a male virility confronting and civilizing. Second, he drew into this masculine theme the symbolic pres- tige invested in projectile points. Third, the domestication of the goat was linked to an imagination in which virility was expressed in terms of a confrontation with animals. Fourth, the shift to the rectangular house was fitted into the same scheme, in that the rectangular was seen as more artificial, more imposed, more a conscious expression of self than the circular house form.18 The whole underlying the PPNB was this central involvement of the male, unlike the earlier emphasis on female figurines. And it was this virility which explained the expan- sionism. He talked further of the psychological character of this cultural whole-that it contained an existential malaise , an impatience that moved material progress forward.19 As with the initial adoption of agriculture, one is bound to ask what caused the shift in culture and psychology in the PPNB. Again the psycho-cultural was given primacy over the material and the economic. As a result it became difficult to explain change in the psycho-cultural realm. THE ROLE OF RELIGION AT ÇATALHÔYÛK Largely in response to the arguments made by Cauvin, we have recently been using a grant from the Templeton Founda- tion to explore the role of religion at Çatalhôyûk and to exam- ine further the questions that he raised in his seminal book and related works. The first phase of this new work inspired by Cauvin has been completed20 and I would like to describe the results here. The Templeton project involved an interna- tional study group of archaeologists but also anthropologists and philosophers of religion. This group of scholars came to the site each summer for three years and attempted to explore questions about religion in relation to specific data and the new results from the site.21 Our discussions centered around four questions, all of which take various aspects of Cauvin's arguments and subject them to scrutiny. 17.

The group of Templeton scholars engaged at first hand with the materials from the site and asked questions of the archae- ologists. Detailed discussions in the laboratories at the site, regarding obsidian, pottery and figurines or plants, animal bones and human remains led to reflexive dialogue about the degree to which a separate spiritual or religious part of life could be discerned, especially in these early time periods. At theoretical and comparative levels, problems immedi- ately arose regarding whether it was helpful to talk of a sepa- rate arena of life at Çatalhôyûk that could be called religious. Sociological and anthropological debate has demonstrated the difficulties of defining a separate religious sphere in certain forms of society. M. Bloch22 bluntly stated that "I am confi- dent that there was no religion in Çatalhôyûk", meaning that the houses themselves were both religious and domestic: there was no separate religious sphere. The sociologist R. Bellah23 has argued that the term 'religion' was a relatively recent con- cept, and that 'transcendent' was a term that was given very specific meanings in different religions. Scholars from reli- gious studies and philosophy often take a post-foundational approach and argue for diversity. For example, L. Shults24 and J.W. van Huyssteen25 argued for religion as an emergent prop- erty of complex human systems. Their accounts of religion remained nuanced and contextual. And yet they saw value in continued use of the term 'religion' as a general category. The philosopher of religion van Huyssteen26 did not see a clearly demarcated religious domain in the Neolithic at Çatalhôyûk. The neurological capacity for different forms of consciousness was linked by him to the human ability to sym- bolize. Human spiritual and religious experience can be under- stood as an emergent consequence of the symbolic capacity in humans. Religion is about playing out specific and embodied worldviews within this universal framework. Shults27 sug- gested that religious theorists no longer deal with an opposition between matter and spirit. Referring to emergent complexity theory, he saw spirituality as an emergent form of self-aware- ness. The spiritual is associated with the experience of ulti- 22. BLOCH, 2010: 161. 23.

Spirituality at Çatalhõyiik was not a separate domain. The hiding and revealing process (for example hiding and revealing paintings or obsidian caches or human skulls) suggested a concern with ultimate boundar- ies. The ridges and boundaries on the floors and platforms that defined everyday activity in the Çatalhõyiik house were linked to the dead buried beneath the floors, and in this way they were linked to the ultimate - perhaps to the ancestors. Anthropologists such as Bloch,28 Webb Keane29 and Peter Pels30 were wary of the value of the term religion, which they saw as inextricably linked to particular developed social and institutional forms and particular modes of power. But they nevertheless were keen to develop an account of phenomena that others might categorize as religious. Thus Bloch31 dis- cussed houses, roles, corporate groups and the transcendental at Çatalhõyiik rather than religion. Bloch32 has also suggested an approach to religion that sees it as deriving from, and con- tinuous with, the general human capacity to imagine other worlds.33 In these ways his position, at the general level, is close to that of Shults and van Huyssteen.34 Bloch35 describes humans and chimpanzees as having complex social worlds. Chimpanzees engage in much Machiavellian politicking - they have what Bloch terms a transactional social. But they do not have the transcendental social - that is roles that con- tinue on beyond the individual. It is the ability to imagine a social structure that endures, and to treat elders as honored previous holders of roles, and indeed to treat ancestors as hold- ers of roles, that separates humans from chimpanzees. This exposition by Bloch is highly relevant to Çatalhõyiik and to the origins of settled life in towns, because the evidence strongly suggests that a key concern at this time period was indeed the endurance of roles, of structure, and of the centrality of ances- tors.36 The transcendental imaginings that are seen in the art and symbolism suggest a social world concerned with estab- lishing the longer-term social relations that are at the heart of agricultural and settled town life. But more generally, we can see the possibility of religion as an emergent property of the human capacity to imagine - as seen in Upper Palaeolithic art well before the agricultural revolution.37 28.

One example of the assumptions that often, unhelpfully, travel with the term 'religion' is that religion is always about belief. Talal Asad38 has argued that historically anthropologists had come to understand religion as propositional, yet some reli- gion is about proper practice rather than being propositional. Anthropologists now accept that much religion is not about propositions. However, even ritual practice involves some sense of belief. Belief and meaning do not need to be separate and propositional. They can be embodied and embedded. A differ- ent though comparable distinction is made by Whitehouse39 in his discussion of modes of religiosity. Keane40 is another anthropologist wary of using the term 'religion' and seeking to find other, general and comparative, ways of describing what others mean by religious phenomena. He argues that what looks to us like religion emerges from convergences between different kinds of practice which are not necessarily 'religious' in their own right, but become so when they are combined. He suggests that there is evidence at Çatal- hõyiik of the general processes of 'marking' and 'absence'. Marking is a way of setting some things as apart, special, dif- ferent, difficult. The most obvious examples at Çatalhõyiik are the kills of dangerous wild animals, the associated feasts, and the display of the resulting bucrania. One source of the difficulty associated with such marking is absence. Absence refers to the ways in which some practices produce an experi- ence that there is something beyond experience that is still relevant. This something beyond is not just gone; it impinges on us somehow. An example at Çatalhõyiik is provided by the wild boar mandibles buried in the walls - absent (hidden) but still there and relevant to the lived practices of feasts and wild animal kills. Another example is the human bodies buried beneath the floors that remain relevant to social life so that the graves are re-opened and skulls removed and cir- culated. Obsidian and stalagmites deposited in caches and graves also produce the effect of absence. Practices that pro- duce the effect of absence display people's control or power over absence and presence, and the transitions between them. Marking and absence work against the background of hab- it - the routine flow of daily life. In the Çatalhõyiik house, marking, absence and habit all come together and affect one another. Life may be a continuum between unconscious rou- tine and conscious acts or events, but certain practices sharpen the differences between the extremes of that continuum, to social effect. 38.

The approach outlined by Keane, and the related perspec- tive of Pels,41 seem very useful for archaeological discus- sion. The marking, hiding and making absent of things has long been a focus of archaeological interest in the religious, whether it be Renfrew's42 account of things that attract atten- tion and so mark, or Bradley's43 discussion of ritual conspicu- ous deposition of metal objects (hidden or made absent) in rivers and bogs, or Tilley's44 description of the marking of the landscape with rock art that symbolizes absent or distant ani- mals or boats, or the common notion that objects that are car- ried over longer distances often have special significance or value that is manipulated socially.45 In relation to Çatalhôyûk the approach is very productive, partly because the marking and the absence can be set within the context of habitual rou- tines. Because of the embedding of symbolism and ritual in domestic life at the site it is unhelpful to talk of a separate religious sphere, and yet it is clear that we need a way to talk of religious experience at the site, however much it is embed- ded in daily life. Thus the ridges on the house floors mark differences between activity areas. Bull horn pilasters mark the edges of platforms under which people are buried as in Building 77 (fig. 1) so that the platform is marked in relation to daily activities on the floors and so that the human bones buried beneath the platform are both made present (by the bull horn marking) and hidden or made absent. The whole 41. PELS, 2010. 42. Renfrew, 1985. 43. BRADLEY, 1990. 44. TILLEY, 1997. 45. SHERRATT, 1981. social process in the house can be described as one in which absences are marked, and the beyond is constructed in the midst of the practices of daily life. It is clear that there were rules at Çatalhôyûk about what could be done in different areas of the house.46 Adults were buried in the northern part of the house but not in the south- ern part. Pottery that was used to cook food in the southern part of the house was never placed in a grave. Different types of matting were placed on different types of platform. There was social control over what could be done in different parts of the house, and over the transitions between those spaces. The practices that produced the effects of absence displayed people's control or power. The bull horns marked the dead beneath the platform and made them present. The obsidian cached below the floor could from time to time be dug up and used. The skulls of the ancestor could from time to time be dug up, used and re-deposited to found a new house. In all these ways the control over absence and presence, and the transitions between them, were integrally linked to social power - per- haps between elders and youngers. But it is important to recognize that the ways in which marking and absence are manipulated and experienced vary through time and in different contexts. How people experience absence and the beyond varies. Whitehouse47 describes these different ways of experiencing as "modes of religiosity". Most rituals are either high or low arousal. All low frequency rituals are high intensity (Whitehouse terms these imagistic) so that the experiences are burned into people's minds. People then reflect on what happened over long periods of time. Low inten- sity, high frequency ritual (termed doctrinal) is more closely associated with the transmission of doctrine and knowledge, and it often involves persuasive leaders. At first sight, Çatal- hôyûk would seem to fit into the high frequency, low inten- sity category since the same images, symbols and practices are repeated over and over again in the houses. But there also seem to be cases of low frequency, high arousal events such as the feasts associated with wild bulls. Whitehouse and Hodder48 have explored the value of this model for Çatalhôyûk. There seem to be good grounds for arguing that 1,400 years of occu- pation at the site saw a gradual shift from a more imagistic to a more doctrinal mode. Much the same argument could be made for the Neolithic of Anatolia and the Middle East more generally. The PPNB often seems associated with high arousal and remarkable events such as the deposition of human figures 46. HODDER, 2006. 47. Whitehouse, 2004. 48. HODDER, 2010. Paléorient, vol. 37.1, p. 1 1 1-122 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 201 1</page><page sequence="6">at 'Ain Ghazal,49 the plastering of skulls at Jericho and other sites50 or the impressive carved stone stele with dangerous wild animals at Göbekli.51 And yet by the Pottery Neolithic throughout the area there is less evidence of obvious and dis- tinctive ritual practices and a wider dissemination of symbol- ism into pottery decoration and stamp seals. Evaluation of this claim for a broader shift in modes of religiosity at this time will have to await further research, but the overall effect of the approach offered by Whitehouse is to shift archaeologists from identifying religion as a separate sphere to focusing on practices, effects and experiences. Another approach to identifying different religious modes is Nakamura's52 contrast between magic and religion. It is diffi- cult to provide stable distinctions between religion and magic, but the latter term is often used to describe practical acts that lie outside or alongside religious schemes. While it is difficult to draw lines between magic, science and religion, it is often the contrasts with the other two terms that define magic. Magic is part of religion but it also transgresses. The normal religious themes at Çatalhôyiik (the clay plastered bucrania, burial, dan- gerous wild things in the clay house) can be contrasted with unusual clusters of objects. These clusters include obsidian, antler, pottery fragments, crystal, pigment, special stones or axe heads, stalactites, a baby leg, fossils and so on. Depos- its of such objects often occur in liminal spaces and times, for example in the construction or abandonment deposits in a house. They can be termed magical in that they seem linked to particular practices that stand against the usual religious rep- ertoire and can be seen as having a more direct instrumental character. In summary, there can be disagreement about whether the term 'religious' should be used at all in the context of discus- sion about the types of society associated with Çatalhôyiik, but it is clear that a more applicable approach is one that focuses on marking or dealing with 'the beyond' - defined as absence, ultimate boundaries or the transcendental. In small- scale societies, and at Çatalhôyiik in particular, this focus on 'the beyond' is often embedded within forms of social and material life and does not constitute a separate institutional sphere. 49.

NAKAMURA, 2010. 2 - RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN RELIGION AND SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CHANGE Are changes in spiritual life and religious ritual a neces- sary prelude to the social and economic changes that lead to 'civilization' ? This question raised by Cauvin's work can be explored in relation to two aspects of the data from the Middle East and Çatalhôyiik. The first aspect concerns the evidence from the Middle East as a whole, and deals with the factors associated with the formation of settled villages from the 11th millennium ВС onwards. But the claim can also be explored in relation to the domestication of cattle at Çatalhôyiik itself in the 7th mil- lennium ВС. In relation to the first, more general question the new evi- dence from Göbekli Tepe is particularly compelling.53 There is much scholarly fascination with this site, not only with the richness of its symbolism but also with the evidence that such elaboration and complexity could occur so early, before fully domesticated plants and animals. The site seems to invite the speculation that communities first came together around large- scale and intense rituals before they intensified their subsis- tence economies to such an extent that genetic change occurred in crops and flocks. But it is important to recognize that genetic change in the process of domesticating plants and animals was preceded by the intensive collecting, cultivating and herding54 of genetically wild species. Some degree of settled agglomera- tions, sometimes associated with ritual structures, occur from the Natufian onwards in the southern Levant.55 Göbekli Tepe is a remarkable site and it raises in a very stark fashion the possibility of a very early role for symbolism and ritual in the formation of settled agricultural life. But it is itself only part of a larger and gradual process. Given the answer to question 1 above, a close tie is to be expected between spiritual and religious life and increasing social and economic complexity. Different forms of religion are appropriate to different contexts (so that it is not possible to have Moses in aboriginal Australia). Shults56 argues that changes in symbolic thought probably were a prelude to the major changes that led to complex 'civilizations'. It seems pos- sible that the idea of living together came before the town or settled village - the idea of togetherness preceded the concrete realization. Picking apart causal chains is always fraught with 53. Schmidt, 2006. 54. Fuller, 2007. 55. KUIJT, 2000; HODDER, 2007. 56. Shults, 2010.

HODDER</page><page sequence="7">The role of religion in the Neolithic of the Middle East and Anatolia with particular reference to Çatalhõyiik 117 difficulties and the most likely answer to the second question is that religious and socio-economic life were and are inex- tricably linked. Thus in contrast to Cauvin's views, religion accompanied and made possible domesticated and settled life rather than being an originator. There is possible evidence that at the more specific level at Çatalhõyiik, changes in the symbolic manipulation of cattle occurred before biological evidence of domestication of cat- tle. We await the new evidence from the site to see at what point cattle were domesticated - in the upper levels of the East Mound or only in the later West Mound. But there is certainly a decrease in the availability or use of wild cattle in the upper levels of the Neolithic East Mound, and also in the upper levels we see new forms of symbolic relationship between humans and animals, with for example domesticated animals being buried with humans. It would be possible to argue that the pres- ence of wild bull horns in many contexts in houses in the lower and middle levels at Çatalhõyiik indicates the symbolic con- trol of wild animals that were domesticated (whether locally or brought from elsewhere) in the upper levels. But how did the religious and the economic interact in rela- tion to cattle at Çatalhõyiik? In terms of the framework pre- sented by Keane57 and summarized above, cattle were marked at Çatalhõyiik by killing, feasting and display, which made human agency over them a focus of attention and interest. This could have been a factor in the domestication process: various ways of marking cattle as foci of special attention drew atten- tion to what humans could do to them, as Cauvin argued. Thus the symbolic and religious marking might have accelerated whatever incipient domestication was already going on. By way of contrast, sheep and goat had already been domesticated at the start of the occupation at Çatalhõyiik. They were thus less useful in the production of absence - and indeed they played little to no role in the symbolism and religious practices at the site. Indeed, one might ask why cattle were domesticated so late at Çatalhõyiik and elsewhere in the Middle East? After, all sheep and goat had been domesticated for one to two millennia before cattle were domesticated. At Çatalhõyiik it remains pos- sible that the cattle were specifically 'kept' wild so that they could play their role in the production of absence, the imagin- ing and manipulation of the beyond. The houses in the early to middle levels of the site depended on this social construction of difference and otherness in transcendental experience. Overall, there is much both general and specific data to sup- port the notion that changes in spiritual life and religious ritual accompanied the social and economic changes that produced 57. KEANE, 2010. settled life based on domestic resources. But the second ques- tion also asks whether it was a necessary prelude and accom- paniment. Settled agricultural life involved a whole series of new structures and constraints on social and economic life. Longer term relationships had to be set up to deal with the delayed returns from the investments of labor. There had to be ways of dealing with disputes in the large villages and towns. There had to be mechanisms for the passing down of property. All these changes involved new conceptions of humans in rela- tion to each other, and in relation to the environment and its resources. The new structures had to be imagined in a spiritual realm alongside their envisioning in practice. Some additional support for the overall conclusions at Çatal- hõyiik has been provided in the last few years in the excava- tions conducted by D. Baird and T. Watkins at the nearby sites of Boncuklu and Pinarbaçi.58 These sites stretch back to the 13th millennium ВС, and they show, especially at Boncuklu, the very early development of many of the special features of Çatalhõyiik. Boncuklu has the division of houses into south and north parts, burials beneath floors, and elaborate instal- lations on walls. And yet the site is small and low density. So it is clear that all the elaborate ritual and symbolism does not suddenly appear at Çatalhõyiik as the result of agglomeration. Rather, the symbolism already existed prior to the aggregation on the Konya Plain at Çatalhõyiik. The earlier small dispersed settlements were abandoned as people moved into the big cen- ter. But the inhabitants brought with them a symbolic and reli- gious world through which they envisaged and built the town. 3 - ROLE OF NEW FORMS OF HUMAN AGENCY IN THE DOMESTICATION OF ANIMALS Do human forms take on a central role in the spirit world in the early Holocene , and does this centrality lead to new conceptions of human agency that themselves provide the pos- sibility for the domestication of plants and animals? This claim derived from Cauvin's work is largely a histori- cal question to be answered by reference to archaeological data and is less amenable to broad anthropological and theological debate. As with the second question, it seems likely that the domestication of plants and animals involved changed concep- tions of the world and that these changed conceptions were embedded within other realms of thought. In particular, the domestication of animals would have involved new conceptions of the relationships between humans and animals which must 58. BAIRD, 2007 and 2008. Paléorient, vol. 37.1, p. 1 1 1-122 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 201 1</page><page sequence="8">have been linked to other changes in thought at the time. The archaeological evidence suggests that in contrast to the cave paintings and other symbolism of the Upper Palaeolithic in Europe, the imagery from Göbekli Tepe and Çatalhõyiik indi- cates a human domination of wild animals. At Göbekli Tepe, scorpions, spiders, snakes, vultures, foxes, lions and bulls are shown on stele that are undoubtedly anthropomorphic, with hands and arms shown and in one case a belt. Many of these animals were never domesticated and yet they are shown in a context dominated by large human figures. At Çatalhõyiik, on the other hand, some of the animals shown in the paintings would later show morphological change indicating domestica- tion. There are baiting and teasing scenes involving bulls and wild boar, but stags and bears are also shown baited. There are a number of figurines (clay and stone) showing humans associ- ated with leopards or sitting on wild animals, and of course the most famous image from the site shows a woman flanked by possible leopards, her hands apparently resting on their heads in a dominating position. Many of the paintings have been interpreted as showing humans wearing leopard skins. It seems reasonable to argue that in these cases human agents were able symbolically to dominate wild animals. This con- ceptual domination would have been helpful as the process of actual domination of animals in terms of their domestication got under way. In terms of Keane's59 account of religion in terms of mark- ing and absence it is possible to explore how such processes have historical consequences. Keane60 has argued that mark- ing and absence both sharpen people's awareness of their own agency or the agency of other beings. In other words, whether people are claiming agency for themselves, for example by kill- ing dangerous animals, or displacing it onto others, for exam- ple by treating birds as spirits, they are objectifying agency. By objectifying agency, people can reflect on it. This makes it possible for them to transform habit into purposeful actions. It allows people to act in inventive, or morally responsible, or simply audacious new ways. If the Neolithic can be seen as a revolution in human abilities and efforts to intervene in the world, then self-consciousness about agency itself is a crucial part of the process. 59. KEANE, 2010. 60. Ibid. 4 - PART PLAYED BY SYMBOLISM OF VIOLENCE AND DEATH IN THE FORMATION OF SETTLED VILLAGE LIFE Do violence and death act as the foci of transcendent reli- gious experience during the transitions of the early Holocene in the Middle Easty and are such themes central to the creation of social life in the first large agglomerations of people? As noted above it was a key component of Cauvin's account that violence played a central role in the PPNB. In this fourth question, the Templeton project considered the broader question of the role of violent imagery throughout the Neo- lithic, both in relation to males and females and in relation to death. Violent imagery is seen at Göbekli Tepe (in the animals with bared teeth) and at Çatalhõyiik (for example, the wild boar teeth and vulture beaks placed in walls). Hodder and Meskell61 have described other examples from eastern Turkey and the northern Levant, and the rather fewer examples in the south- ern Levant. Shults62 has attempted to understand this imagery in terms of the intensification it produced. He argued that in such moments of intense or heightened experience there was an awareness of the need for a new understanding of the self in relation to others. The participant was thus released to find a place in the world in a new way. The productive aspects of vio- lence, rather than negative connotations, are often overlooked by archaeologists. Indeed, the very term 'violence' might be unhelpful - as it may be other aspects of what we perceive as violent scenes that may be more salient. Thus a leopard claw may be kept and deposited in a burial63 because it indexes a powerful animal or because it endures rather than because it represents death and violence. R. Girard64 has provided a useful framework for interpret- ing the violent imagery at Çatalhõyiik. For him religion is a way of managing and evacuating the violence generated inside the human community. Most archaic religions show a narrative that involves going through violence to resolution. At Çatal- hõyiik there is often a pairing, two cranes, two skulls or two confronting leopards in deadlock. The other key symbol is the reverse of this - a group of people surrounding an exagger- ated animal. The bull is about to be killed and taken into the house. The people will kill and be reconciled. This is not a matter of worshipping violence, but of peace produced through 61. Hodder and Meskell, 2011. 62. Shults, 2010. 63. HODDER, 2006. 64. Girard, 1988.

Hodder</page><page sequence="9">The role of religion in the Neolithic of the Middle East and Anatolia with particular reference to Çatalhôyûk 119 violence. There is a destructuring in the deadlock and a resolu- tion into a new structure if the bull is treated right. Bloch65 has noted that violence would have been a central theme in Çatalhôyûk. His approach is more sociological66 and based on his general assessment that Çatalhôyûk was some form of 'house society'67 in which rights and resources were passed down in 'houses' (groups of houses led together by the passing down of rights). He argued that in such contexts there would have been the violence of wrenching women from their birth 'house' and forcing them to live in a marital 'house'. More generally it seems likely that there would have been much con- flict over resources in the dense town. And yet there is much evidence from the human remains at the site that the people at Çatalhôyûk had lived non-violent lives. There were few indi- cations of the cuts, wounds, parry fractures, or crushed skulls. So how had the potential to violence been so well managed at Çatalhôyûk? Bloch68 has argued that symbolic violence was a necessary part of the movement into another world. Most human societies understand that there is a permanent frame- work to social life that transcends the natural transformative processes of birth, growth, reproduction, ageing and death. The violence and symbolic killing take people beyond process into permanent entities such as descent groups. By leaving this life, it is possible to see oneself and others as part of some- thing permanent and life-transcending. For Bloch,69 mastering the virility of wild bulls in rituals and depictions in the house 'reanimated' the transcendental social and thus contributed to the continuity of the house. The moments of danger and/or violence involved move- ments away from the here-and-now; they involved transcendent experiences in which the social group could be transformed and made permanent. So it seems that there could indeed be a link between the violence in the imagery at Çatalhôyûk and the lack of violence on human bodies. (There may have been regional variation in the Middle East Neolithic, with perhaps more evidence of bodily violence at Çayônû.) At Çatalhôyûk, social violence was dealt with by living within a symbolic, transcendent world of violence in which conflicts were resolved and social structures made permanent. The view that the violent imagery at Çatalhôyûk and other sites had a key role in creating the social and the long-term as people first settled down and formed complex societies is sum- marized in Fig. 2. In this diagram, on the central horizontal 65. BLOCH, 2010. 66. See BLOCH, 2008. 67. JOYCE and GlLLSEPIE, 2000. 68. BLOCH, 2008. 69. BLOCH, 1992. axis, the person is made social through violence and death, either through initiation and other rituals or in the daily inter- actions with bull horns and other animal parts present or made absent in the house. In the lower part of the diagram, this social process is linked to the transcendental and the spiritual as per- sons experience something beyond themselves that is integral to their lives. Spiritual power is gained by individuals in these experiences, but also is controlled by elders. In the upper part of the diagram these spiritual powers are related to social pow- ers. The social manipulation of rituals and symbols of violence give power to elders and dominant houses. There is also evi- dence that the power of wild animals was used to provide or protect. Thus in flg. 1 the bull horns surround and protect the ancestors buried beneath the platform and in one case wild goat horns were found over, perhaps protecting, a bin contain- ing lentils (Building l).70 This is a very different conception of the symbolism and ritual associated with the origins of agriculture and settled vil- lages from that normally outlined.71 It has become common- place to argue that the early farmers would have emphasized ideas of fertility, nurturing and abundance.72 The earliest set- tled settlements are often associated with images of women, sometimes interpreted as pregnant or fertile and much atten- tion is paid to the few female figurines that have been found. But in fact male and phallic imagery is common, linked to images of wild male animals at Göbekli Tepe and Çatalhôyûk. Social rules and roles seem to have been established in these first communities largely through a conception of the world in which violence and dangerous wild animals played a central part, as outlined in fig. 2. Keane73 has discussed violence and death based on a Sum- banese example. He argues that there is a bundle of many dif- ferent things that killing large dangerous animals does. The process is not unitary, and violence might not be the most important aspect. One aspect that he stresses because it is con- sistent with other things going on at Çatalhôyûk is that killing big animals is a dramatic display of the control over the transi- tion from life to death, visible to invisible, presence to absence. Thus, once again, social power is created through violence and death. Turning to the social role of death, it is clear that this played an important part in the building of house-based social groups at Çatalhôyûk. It is clear that while all houses were 70.

HODDER Fig. 2 -An interpretation of the role of violence in the social and religious process at Çatalhõyiik. very similar in size and elaboration at the site, some houses were larger, more elaborate, and lasted longer than others. These more elaborate houses often contained more burials than other houses and indeed seem to have been used as repositories of the dead from other houses. Thus some physical sun-dried mud-brick houses became 'houses' of people held together by the circulation of human remains. Because these 'houses' also seem to have amassed animal parts, to be curated and passed down as memorials of feasts and animal kills, and because they also contained other symbolic elaboration such as reliefs and paintings, these houses have been termed 'history houses'.74 This focus on history houses, and on the wider category of house societies to which they belong, might seem like an unnecessary tangent in a discussion about religion. But in fact this would be a misunderstanding of the role of the house at Çatalhõyiik. In house based societies, houses are 'religion'. As we have seen above, the play of presence and absence that is the religious process at Çatalhõyiik takes place in the floor platforms, ridges, accoutrements, burials of the house. In par- ticular, the heads of wild animals and humans are passed down from generation to generation within individual houses and between houses. Following Bloch, we can say that the virility of wild bulls installed in the material house reanimated the social house. The passing down of the objects of the house and the remembering and reliving of earlier houses constituted the social through the religious. A quantitative analysis of the houses at Çatalhõyiik has attempted to explore the differences between history houses 74. HODDER and PELS, 2010. and other houses.75 Little difference could be found between these two house types in terms of access to resources. So how was it possible for some houses to gain social and spiritual power through the amassing of skulls and wild bull horns and human burials while others did not? Keane76 has suggested that bull horns accumulated over a career. The marks in a house (horns, paintings, etc.) were historical, they were traces of events. Some houses never got marks or burials, and they might be categorically different from those that did (maybe branch or cadet lines, for example). But the differences among houses with marks may have been historical in nature, not cat- egorical. Over generations, some houses acquired more events than others. Houses with 60 burials probably were categori- cally different from those with none. But houses with many bucrania or paintings were also houses that had persisted long enough to acquire more marks. As archaeologists we catch them at a late stage in the career of accumulating marks. The quantity of marks is in part a function of time. This explana- tion begs the question of why some houses persisted longer than others. Perhaps many contingent factors were involved. But it remains possible that the more persistent and long-last- ing houses were those that most effectively manipulated marks and absences; those that came to be recognized as good at pro- tecting the dead were also most able at reanimate the traces of kills and feasts. CONCLUSION It is clear that, to a large extent, recent research at Çatal- hõyiik, both comparative and empirical, has largely confirmed the value of responding to the ideas in Cauvin's seminal 2000 book. It may not have been helpful to separate the mental, the symbolic, the religious from daily life and certainly a sepa- rate religious institutional sphere cannot be identified at Çatal- hõyiik. Such separations are produced in our own time but not in the time of the Neolithic. The recent finds from Göbekli Tepe and other sites have demonstrated that female symbol- ism was only part of a wider suite of symbols in which males and violence played equally important roles. It seems evident that symbolic and religious components of life were central to the domestication of plants and animals and that they played an early and formative role, even if they were not originators. It also seems clear that changes in the conceptualization of 75. Ibid. 76. KEANE, 2010.

The evidence thus seems to support the rather more nuanced version of the Neolithisation process found in parts of Cauvin's book and described in the introduction to this article. Rather than religion or new forms of agency being prime causes in the domestication of plants and animals and the emergence of settled villages, religion and the symbolic were thoroughly engrained within the interstices of the new way of life. Reli- gion played a primary role, allowing new forms of agency, setting up a symbolic world of violence through which new longer-term social and economic relations could be produced, but there is not good evidence that it was an independent cause of the changes. Perhaps more important than the specific claims of Cauvin and the particular responses to them, his work has attracted very wide discussion across a swathe of disciplines. As a result, the debate about the role of religion in the Neolithic has been transformed and brought into closer dialogue with anthropology, philosophy and religious studies. The result is richer and more complex and it is to Cauvin that we should offer thanks; he who set us on this broader and more productive path, thinking new thoughts and encountering new ideas and data on the way.
