LAPP1 The third campaign of the Joint Concordia-ASOR Excavation at Taanach was conducted between June 4 and August 10, 1968.2 The campaign was preceded by five days of staff orientation and followed by two weeks of report compiling by the Core Staff. The professional staff of 343 was supported by a technical staff of 15 and a force of some 185 laborers. The budget for the excavation was provided by the Aid Association for Lutherans through the Committee for Concordia Archae- ological Studies in the Near East of the Graduate School of Concordia Seminary, St. Louis, and by United States Government Counterpart Funds received through ASOR. The 1968 campaign concentrated on the Bronze age stratigraphy of the areas previously excavated south of the West Building, worked during the first two campaigns.4 The excavations were expanded only in a large area on the southwest slope, in SW 7-7, and at the Northeast Outwork.5 A fine twelfth century B. C. house, more of the Drainpipe Structure, and the Northeast Outwork of the Iron age were unearthed, in addition to most of the Late and Middle Bronze and some of the Early Bronze strata in the areas under excavation. In general the strata of the Bronze age produced more interesting structures and richer finds than those of the Iron age.

Glock, editor), and the non-ceramic artifacts. Mean- while, this preliminary report attempts to present the highlights of the third campaign. Following the format of the earlier preliminary reports, observations on the occupational history of the site are followed by a discussion of some of the chief architectural finds and installations and a presentation of a few of the most significant artifacts. OCCUPATIONAL HISTORY The occupational history reflected in the first two campaigns 6 can be refined only very slightly from third campaign findings. Evidence from the expanded unearthing of the EB defense line and from occupation within the town continues to point to a period from after the inception of EB II to before the end of EB III for Taanach's EB occupation. The south slope was a bare rocky scarp before the erection of the earliest EB defenses (see next section), and the earliest occupation inside the fortifications appears to be contemporary with the earliest defenses. While the EB III ceramic typology lacks precision, it does seem clear that the latest EB III forms are lacking at Taanach.7 The third campaign added nothing to the scant evidence for MB I occupation, and there remains a gap in MB II A. Sherds from MB II B were rare except in SW 6-6, where there are enough sherds in a mixed fill to suggest that there might have been more MB II B occupation than is indicated by our other finds. Most evidence of a substantial MB II B occupation could have been swept away from the west central portion of the mound in preparation for the major MB II C structures discovered by both German and American excavations. On the other hand, evidence that the MB II C defenses in SW 7-7 and SW 8-1 were built directly on EB remains makes such a possibility very doubtful. The second major phase of MB II C construction provided more evidence of a final destruction, but more impressive this season was the 6 BULLETIN, 173, pp. 6-8; 185, pp. 2-3. SChronological arguments based on the absence or scarcity of Khirbet Kerak ware (BULLETIN, 173, p. 6 and n. 9) require more careful scrutiny (cf. the remarks and bibliography in my contribution to the forthcoming Glueck Festschrift). The Khirbet Kerak sherds at Taanach represent not more than thirty vessels. Khirbet Kerak ware was not made at Taanach. The situation at Megiddo is similar and contrasts strikingly with neighboring Affuleh. The quantity of Khirbet Kerak ware from Palestinian sites south of Megiddo and Taanach similarly precludes local fabrication. It is interesting to note that the typology in the south is virtually limited to small, easily transportable bowls in contrast to Taanach and Megiddo, where sherds of the larger bowls also occur. Cf. B. Hennessy, The Foreign Relations of Palestine during the Early Bronze Age (London, 1967), pp. 74-75; R. Amiran, "Khirbet Kerak Ware at Ai," IEJ, 17 (1967), pp. 185-186. The scarcity of the ware at Taanach, Megiddo, and southern sites warns against relying upon its absence as a clear chronological indication at Tell el-Far'ah (contrast BULLETIN, 173, p. 6). The interpretation formerly proposed, that the few Khirbet Kerak vessels at Taanach point to an end of EB occupation early in EB III, is just as dubious, especially since they belong to the last two major phases of the town's defenses. If Khirbet Kerak ware had been popular with the inhabitants of Taanach and Megiddo, great quantities could have been procured within a very few years. The manufacturers of Khirbet Kerak ware apparently had as little intercourse with their Taanach neighbors as they did with towns further south. 4</page><page sequence="4">Number 195 October, 1969 continuity in plan and occupation of the building between the streets in SW 4-7 and the defenses in SW 7-7. It has been called the LB I Building, but it is more properly considered part of an insula. There are comparable structures east of the street, and both building complexes and the superimposed street surfacings between indicate a continuity between MB II C and LB I, lacking the clear evidence for a massive MB II C destruction found just to the north in SW 3-5 and 5-5 and over the West Building. There was more evidence for occupation after Thutmose III's destruc- tion in 1468 B. C., especially in the area of the northern extension of the street line in SW 5-3 and 5-4. This occupation may have extended somewhat into the fourteenth century B. C., but subsequent abandon- ment and the major twelfth century B. C. construction in the area left scant evidence for specifying the beginning of the gap. Nothing requiring a date between the mid-fourteenth and late thirteenth century B. C. has yet been unearthed at Taanach.8 The house of the twelfth century B. C. fits well with previous observa- tions on the substantial character of occupation during that century. Thereafter the occupation history remains as previously postulated: abandonment of the site in the eleventh century, gradually increasing occupation during the tenth century leading to important installations toward the end of that century, diminished occupation in the Iron II period, sparse settlement in the Persian period, and subsequent abandon- ment except for occupation at the crest of the mound in the Late Abbasid and Crusader periods. THE EARLY BRONZE DEFENSES In 1968 the exposure of EB defenses on the south slope was tripled, from 14 by 16 m. in 1966 to roughly 42 by 16 m.9 Most of the ten squares opened were excavated to bedrock. Although the hope to locate a gateway was not realized, the four phases of EB II-III defenses described in the 1967 preliminary report 10 were confirmed and elaborated in considerable detail. Wall 58, the 4.20 m. thick defense line of the earliest phase, was traced westward into SW 3-27. There it was concealed under Inner Revetment 68 and obliterated by Outer Revetment 43, founded at or near bedrock in Phase III (Figs. 2-4). Locus 30 in SW 5-26 (Fig. 9) probably repre- sents the inner face of Wall 58 after its turn northward. An angular reconstruction of the southwest corner of Wall 58 in Figure 2 is favored over a more rounded corner for two reasons: lack of any suggestion of a s The suggestion after the first campaign that reoccupation began " perhaps not much before 1300 B. C." (BULLETIN, 173, p. 8) needs revision in light of the evidence of the last two campaigns (cf. BULLETIN, 185, p. 3).

Its final dimensions proved to be some 9.85 by 90.5 m., centered beautifully on the are of Wall 98 (Fig. 2) .1 To be associated with the buttress and Wall 928 in Phase IV is a massive prepared embankment covering all the Phase III elements outside Wall 28. The embankment had a slope of 20 to 9250 and was surfaced with a 1 to 20 cm. layer of greenish-yellow huwwar."9 The fragmentary Phase IV remains at the tell's surface left a number of unanswered questions. One of these was how far down the slope the prepared embankment extended. This question has a bearing on the interpretation of a beautifully preserved press cut into the rock toward the bottom of the south slope in SW 9-29 (Fig. 8) .20 The lower revet- ment of the MB glacis was built over it, and it was covered by a layer containing only EB III sherds. This layer could have been deposited at any time during the last two defense phases or could be a layer of wash deposited before the earliest MB occupation. At least two factors suggest EB II-III usage: lack of any parallels in the nonurban phase between EB and MB town life and the orientation of the press to the Phase III system of Wall 98. During which defense phases could the press have been in use? This question focuses attention on the progression of the defenses down the south slope. In the earliest phase the slope south of the defense line must have been bare bedrock perhaps with a light covering of hard red clay. In Phase II the defenses extended down the slope several meters to the line of Wall 36 in SE 1-98 (Fig. 2). The retaining walls of Phase III required extension downslope (see SW 1-98 in Fig. 92). The remnants of these installations were covered by the glacis of Phase IV, but there is no clear evidence that it extended as far as the press in SW 9-99. There were no remains of EB defenses in our trenches at the base of the south slope or at the base of the north slope. Thus, the press could have been in use during the first three phases and probably also the fourth. If Phase I is eliminated for considerations of orientation, it can be postulated that the press was in use during Phases II to IV. Is For a somewhat similar but less massive " strengthened area of the city wall system " at Ai cf. J. Callaway, "The 1964 'Ai (et-Tell) Excavations," BULLETIN, 178 (Apr., 1965), p. 16 and Fig. 2. 19 It can be seen extending down the slope from above Wall 40 in Fig. 5, as well as in the balk at the upper left in Figs. 6 and 7. This element in SE 1-27 was mistakenly described as covering the Phase II tower in the 1966 report (BULLETIN, 185, p. 7). Actually, it covers not only the Phase II tower but the elements of that tower incorporated into the Phase III revetment. 20 The treading area is 3.10 m. long by 2.20 m. on the east and 1.75 m. on the west. Its depth varies but it is quite shallow, averaging something under 20 cm. This is connected to the catchment basin by two circular conduits 20 cm. in diameter set at a 550 decline toward the basin. The basin is 88 by 55 cm. at its deepest point. Traces of plaster were found in one channel and in the basin. For undated parallels see C. C. McCown, Tell en-Nasbeh, I (Berkeley, 1947), p. 257; R. A.

In any case, the four phases at Taanach provide conclusive evidence of'the Early Bronze origin and early development of the glacis."2 The best evidence on the relation between the south slope defenses and the EB defense system of the rest of the mound comes from SW 7-7. Here a single EB city wall of virtually identical dimensions and con- struction as Walls 58 and 28 was unearthed (Fig. 10, Wall 152). This corresponds with the situation at the east end of the south slope excava- tions where the coterminal 58-28 line was used through Phases I-IV. This suggests that the typical EB fortification line around the mound remained the same throughout its history, the embankments developing at least at strategic spots as the line was raised. By chance, it seems, our excavations came upon a more complex situation at the south because it was the mound's most vulnerable position and at the west in NW 9-1 and SW 9-1 because of buildings at the defense line not found elsewhere.2" THE EARLY BRONZE TOWN. The SW 9-1 to 8-1 trench, in which a tiny portion of the EB town was excavated in 1966, was extended eastward through SW 5-1 in 1968 (Fig. 1). Three building phases were associated with an earlier defense phase, and a second defense line covered these buildings."- These same two phases, the earlier ending in a violent destruction, continued to appear to the east. Unfortunately the subphases of the earlier period were badly disturbed by pits and robbings. In the later phase there was a large open area extending eastward at least eleven meters from defense line 110 with no less than six pavings or surfacings. Whether this was a public square, a court of a very large building, or a gate foyer is a matter for conjecture. The unusual constructions in the defense line might hint at a gate, but there are no hints of an approach ramp in the contours. 2 This is in agreement with the EB origin proposed by Parr, p. 44. Y. Yadin, The Art of Warfare in Biblical Lands, I (New York, 1963), pp. 69-70, relates embanked defenses to the use of the battering ram and notes evidence that it was employed as early as the 25th century B. C. While lie does not cite evidence for EB glacis in Palestine (cf. BULLETIN, 173, p. 14, n. 15), the evidence cited by Parr and the additional material provided by the 1968 Taanach campaign suggest that the battering ram was introduced into Palestine during the Early Bronze age. The Taanach evidence permits an even more precise suggestion. It is the raising and thickening of the defenses in Phases III and IV that would appear to be designed to prevent attack by battering ram. Since Khirbet Kerak w'are is associated only with these two phases, it would seem that the battering ram was in use in Palestine by the beginning of EB III. Perhaps it was used to breach the Phase II walls of late EB II at Taanach. 2~The relation of other EB defenses to those on the west excavated in 1903 (BULLETIN, 185, pp. 10-11) can only be tentatively suggested, acknowledging the possibility that the phases might not be coterminal. The two phases previously described do seem to correspond roughly with Phases III and IV on the south. The earlier phase on the west has a packed walkway between the defense line and outer revetment, and the later a thickened defense line with a plastered surface over the previous revetment. If there was a gate at this point, it was presumably eliminated in the latest phase. 25 BULLETIN, 185, pp. 10-13. 14</page><page sequence="14">Number 195 October, 1969 :51V- 2- 5W5 I- + '+ SWH rWan p : PL A .. .. . :--- - - - ?

Here also there were two main EB phases, the first ending in a violent destruction (Fig. 9). In each phase there were at least two floors indicating subphases. Ceramic typology suggests that the earlier phase belongs to the latter part of EB II, the second to early EB III. A Khirbet Kerak sherd came from a second-period wall. In the earlier phase bedrock served as a floor, or a thin floor over bedrock was prepared. The plaster covering Bench 215 tailed onto bedrock. The walls were substantial and divided the living space into typical rectangular rooms, mostly large, but occasionally divided by narrowly spaced crosswalls. The finds, which suggested nothing beyond domestic use, included a number of flints, three juglets, parts of three finely carved bone handles, and two well-preserved copper axe-heads. The second period's architecture was somewhat better preserved, though it was pockmarked by later pits. Two of the walled units seemed to be courtyards. Each of the courtyards had an oven formed by setting the walls of a large jar on a flat stone base in a packing of red clay (Fig. 9: 92, 173). The courtyard in SW 1-8 had an adjacent hearth with broken basalt saddle grinders forming its base. One of the rooms in SW 1-7 contained two ovens, the other a single example (Fig. 9: 211, 216, 217). While the regular walls of the earlier period were reused in the north, a more irregular pattern of walls emerged in the south, in- cluding wall shiftings and adjustments within the period. It seems likely that this complex represents part of a series of contiguous dwellings rather than part of a large building, but too little has been excavated to be certain. THE [MIDDLE BRONZE II C-LATE BRONZE I DEFENSES IN SW 7-7 In 1963 and 1966 elements of the MB II C glacis defenses on the south and west were discovered,26 but only this season's probe in SW 7-7 has provided a clear picture of the character and phasing of the MB II C defense line at the western crest of the mound. There were two main defense phases, each with subphases represented by three or more floors. The first main phase can be assigned to the first half of the sixteenth century B. C., with slight extension of both termini possible. The second had three subphases to be assigned roughly to the last half of the six- teenth century B. C., the beginning of the fifteenth century to 1468 B. C., and the last half of the fifteenth century B. C. The sequence of first-phase construction may be noted in the Figure 10 section." The outer face of Wall 152, the EB defense line, was built up with a thin wall to a height of about 50 cm. Fill 144 was then laid, and inner Wall 96 was set into and upon it. The single-course width of Wall 96 is typical of the contemporary structures adjacent to the SW 7-7 defenses. The defense line was completed by the erection of "B BULLETIN, 173, pp. 14-15; 185, p. 13. 27 In this discussion the section, Fig. 10, the plans, Fig. 11, and the photographs, Figs. 12-14 should be closely followed. 16</page><page sequence="16">Number 195 October, 1969 Wall 105 and the plastering of the floor between it and Wall 96, as well as at least the lower western face of Wall 96.

Inside, the space between Walls 102 and 96 was divided by Wall 77. Each of the resulting rooms contained a water channel. The one in Room 2 (Fig. 11) paralleled Wall 102 and was constructed in the base of Wall 105 (Fig. 10). The smaller channel, in Room 3, probably a drain, fol- lowed an oblique line and ran under the larger channel and Wall 102.

At this point in the defense line it seems clear that more reliance was placed on the glacis itself than on its capping walls for defense.

So detailed a treatment of a tiny segment of the MB-LB defenses would hardly be justified in this preliminary report except that it seems to have significance for a much-discussed topic, the origin of the case- mate. It is generally presumed that casemate construction originated in the Middle or Late Bronze age in Anatolia and reached Palestine through Syrian mediation in the Iron I period."3 There should be no 32 Figs 11 (B 7) and 14.

In fact, there is a remarkable contemporary parallel in a wall capping the embankment of the lower town at Hazor.4 It may also be suggested that the flimsiness of the earlier phase represents a rather halting first attempt to cap a glacis with a casemate," and the lines of the later casemate follow those of the earlier phase. If this be accepted, it is possible to suggest that, aside from a fairly small group of MB II B squatters, near 1600 B. C. a new group reached Taanach bringing with them a knowledge of casemate con- struction. This group, presumably of northern origin, seems to have dominated Taanach in the 16th century B. C. In any case, it is clear that the casemate can no longer be cited as an instance of Palestinian cultural lag. It provides the clearest evidence to date on the origin of the casemate in Palestine, and perhaps for the entire Near East. THE MB II C-LB I STRUCTURES ADJACENT TO THE WEST BUILDING The MB defense system on the west slope was composed of three glacis, the last associated with the West Building exposed by Sellin.31 The 1968 excavations just south of the West Building revealed two major phases of MB II C construction, the latter used also in LB I. The earlier phase is to be related to the two earlier glacis. the later to the construction of the last glacis and West Building. The continued use of the MB II C-LB I Complex described below, as well as the second phase here described, into LB I contrasts strikingly with the massive layer of mudbrick debris which overlay the latest MB II C occupation in SW 3-5 and 5-5 between these complexes and the West Building to the north." There must have been selective destruction of buildings at the end of MB II C, and some areas destroyed were not reconstructed in LB I.38 In the earlier phase. as may be noted in Figure 15, most of the walls have a single stone width. They are identical in character with the con- temporary insubstantial structures underlying the "LB I Building" a short distance.to the south and the adjacent defenses. The finds are minimal, the most noteworthy being two infant jar burials and a stone- lined cist containing burials of two children about twelve years of age. There is little evidence to aid in the interpretation of the structures, but the large courts suggest a function similar to that proposed for the "C This was immediately pointed out by Y. Yadin when he inspected the Taanach defenses.

Foundation trenches for the walls were cut down nearly a meter and disturbed the earlier phase floors. While evidence that these walls were constructed late in MB II C is incontrovertible, it is also clear from the debris left on the earliest of several preserved floors that the building was used in LB I. Either the earliest floor was kept clean and in continued use from late MB II C into early LB I, or, rather unlikely, the MB II C floor was cut away. While the large courts and rooms are quite substantial, they are markedly poorer than the West Building itself. That they may repre- sent service quarters for the West Building is suggested by a room with sloping plastered floor and other domestic indications.

To the north the line is interrupted by the West Building, more precisely by its subsidiary structures, though the precise circumstances have been obscured by later disturbance at the northern end of SW 5-3. In 1968 a rather clear picture of the succession of events in the area between the street and casemate lines in MB II C-LB I has emerged. In the earliest MB fills there were modest MB II B ceramic remains, notably in SW 6-6. In light of the flimsiness of the structures of their immediate successors, this evidence can hardly be used to suggest 3 BULLETIN, 185, pp. 15-19; 173, p. 17. 24</page><page sequence="24">Number 195 October, 1969 more than insubstantial squatter occupation in the MB II B period. It is clear that early in MB II C (ca. 1650-1600 B. C.) there was a beginning of stone building construction on the mound, even before the surviving stumps of the EB defenses were given any attention.40 Perhaps some additional elements of this phase remain unexcavated, but it is doubtful that a coherent plan will emerge, for these structures were largely obliterated by the preparations for the MB II C structures associated with the earlier defense phase. That the earlier MB II C defense phase, the earliest street, and the intervening structures were built at the same time according to a care- fully executed plan is indicated by the stratigraphy and the plan itself. The entire area from the edge of the mound to the street line was quite evenly leveled by a fill upon which the earlier casemate and the adjacent structures were directly laid.4" The curb lines of the street were built up as the outer wall of the adjacent structures. Four meters west of the west curb wall a parallel wall was erected. Rooms were formed by crosswalls at irregular intervals (Fig. 17), and it is of interest to nott. that most of them contained evidence of use as workrooms. The 11 -- m. of space between the shops and casemate is neatly bisected by a wall.4 The coherence of the plan is further emphasized by the fact that one of the crosswalls follows the same line from the street curb to the outer defense line, and the same is probably true of a second crosswall.43 Such crosswalls may be party walls delimiting units of rooms, but further excavation is required to make this more than a suggestion. While this complex was in use, the heavier, later casemate system, described above, was constructed to strengthen the defense line. Appar- ently, the defense line held at this point, but at the end of MB II C an enemy gained entrance elsewhere and destroyed the MB II C structures between the street and the casemate, including much of the inner casemate wall. There was a subsequent minor occupation of some of the rooms, presumably those best surviving the destruction. Shortly thereafter a major renovation was undertaken largely following the earlier plan. This refurbished complex is what was previously described as the LB I Building.44 The most obvious difference is the shift from characteristic single-stone thickness of the MB II C phase walls to the two-stone width characteristic of the walls of the " LB I Building." The destruction of this " building " is attributed to the 1468 B. C. campaign '" Wall 148 in Fig. 10 illustrates an MB II C wall stratigraphically preceding the earliest MB II C defense phase.

C.44~ In light of the above discussion it seems clear that the designation " LB I Building " should be abandoned. In fact the complex is a reno- vation of original MB II C construction and has counterparts across the street. It might be renamed " MB II C-LB I Building West," but to call the complex a building is at least imprecise. It is a complex of rooms which is an integral part of the town plan. A glance at similar structures at the eastern edge of contemporary Megiddo clarifies the impression that what is involved is commonly called an insula or block of contiguous structures bounded by streets.45 The Megiddo excavators also failed to solve the problem of defining units of rooms within the insulae,46 and nothing beyond domestic use is indicated by the remains- scanty as at Taanach-on the floors of the Megiddo insulae. THE INTRAMURAL BURIALS OF 1B II C--LB I If the insulae were used for domestic occupation, who were the occu- pants? Fortunately, besides the scanty floor remains 47 we have a wealth of evidence bearing on that question in the many subfloor burials. While these are not quite so sophisticated in construction or richly endowed as those from the Megiddo insulae,45 the Taanach burials display a greater variety and do indicate modest wealth. Fifty-eight subfloor burials were recorded in 1968.4" There were 49 individual burials and eight multiple interments accounting for 17 individuals. Of these individuals 38 were under two years old, 16 were ages 3-12, 8 were over 12, and 4 were unde- termined. Most of them belonged to MB II C, but a few were clearly LB I. Infants were normally buried in jars with tomb-gifts of juglets or other small pots placed in the jar or beside it. Occasionally such burials contained a scarab or a gold earring. In other instances infants were buried in a plain cist at the base of a wall, in a stonelined cist, or between well-laid lines of stones, and in one instance a tiny shaft led 44" Cf.

In this light our structures should be considered part of an insula bounded by the street and the town wall, but with northern and southern boundaries not yet clearly delimited. 46 Megiddo II, p. 92.

Children and adults were buried in simple cists along wall lines or less commonly elsewhere inside a room, in oval stone-lined cists, between parallel stone lines, in cists with slab coverings incorporated into flagstone floors, and in shaft tombs. In Figure 18 the foundation of a house wall forms part of a stonelined cist. This burial of an adult (Burial 38) was the richest so far discovered at Taanach. It was one of some 26 subfloor burials in the insula between the western casemate and the street. The deceased was wearing two gold earrings, a silver ring on the fourth finger of her left hand, a string of beads of semi-precious stones, and a silver toggle pin (Figs. 18 and 19). She was provided with two juglets, a small jar, a lamp, a portion of mutton, and a pig astragalus. Before the burial was covered with fill, her slight, dolichocephalic head was protected by part of a large jar. That this burial was unusually rich is emphasized by the fact that only 150 objects were registered from the burials, mostly pots plus a gold earring, a few scarab rings, and pins. The first conclusion to be drawn from this evidence about the occu- pants of the MB II C-LB I insulae is that they were people of at least modest means. Various installations in the insulae also suggest that they were more probably skilled artisans than local farmers. A second obser- vation is that this group reached Taanach from outside Palestine. This is indicated by the practice of intramural burial, unknown in Palestine's then recent past. It is also suggested by the introduction of the case- mate and the carefully planned insulae, also unparalleled in earlier Palestine. Together these conclusions point to an incoming artistocracy, which dominated Palestine in the MB II C period. The picture from Taanach is especially clear because the situation is not complicated by an earlier and contemporary habitation by other groups. The evidence from Taanach fits well with the traditional identification of this aris- tocracy with the Hyksos.50 While their Eastern Anatolian or Caucasian origins may be affirmed, a thorough investigation of their origins and migratory routes to Egypt is badly needed.51 THE MB II C-LB I OCCUPATION ON THE SOUTH SLOPE A facet of Taanach's topography not observable in Figure 1 is that the southernmost excavated area below the EB fortifications with the adjacent " Camp Area " forms a flat shoulder before another distinct drop to the valley floor. Such a shoulder is evident along the entire western side of the mound and is quite prominent to the north. The base of the rocky outcrop, on which ancient Taanach was built, seems e0 Any attempt to construe the Hyksos period in Palestine as an indigenous development flies in the face of the archaeological evidence, as e. g. John van Seters, The Hyksos, A New Investigation (New Haven, 1966). That this work hardly constitutes a "new investigation" is pointed out by Hans Goedicke in his review in American Journal of Archaeology, 71 (1967), pp. 412-413.

THE IRON AGE DEFENSES Outside SW 7-7 no fortifications later than MB II C were discovered at Taanach. Even traces of the latest MB II C defense line were lacking. The SW 7-7 evidence on the latest M\B II C summit defense line and its continued use in the 15th century B. C. has already been pre- sented. Above this line just beneath the surface came our only evidence for the Iron age fortification of Taanach. The stratigraphy shows that Wall 7, the Iron age defense line, was set on a compact tan fill (Fig. 10: 21). This fill contained mixed pottery, the latest of which belonged to the earliest 12th century B. C. horizon. "2b BULLETIN, 185, pp. 14-15, 33-34. " Albright, Archaeology of Palestine, p. 113. In fact, a cistern lined with water- proof plaster was discovered at the EB town of BAb edh-Dhir'. 33</page><page sequence="33">Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research This horizon indicated Iron age occupation before the laying of the fill, possibly to be related to the ashy streaks below the fill right of Pit 33 in Figure 10. Pit 33 provides evidence that the surface of the fill was used as an occupation surface for a time before the wall was constructed. These two phases belong to the very late 13th and first quarter of the 12th century. The pottery from Wall 7 itself indicates that its construc- tion cannot be put later than the second quarter of the 12th century. From this point there is a stratigraphic gap in our knowedge until the end of Iron II, for the gray debris of Locus 9 lying against the inner face of Wall 7 contained pottery of the late seventh and early sixth century B. C. suggesting that the same defense line persisted through the Iron I and II periods. The small-stone character of Wall 7 may be noted in Figure 23. The inner facing of the wall is clear, but the lack of a clear outer face makes it probable that its original width was more than 4.25 m. (Fig. 10). The outer wall of the later Middle Bronze casemate was in places covered by LB wash layers, but some of its stones projected or were reset above the level of the base of Wall 7. Their inclusion in Figure 23 is based on the possibility that they were incorporated into Wall 7, possibly forming its outer face. The modern trench along the line of Wall 7 makes it possible to observe what appear to be stones of the Iron age defense line for some distance to the north and south. THE TWELFTH CENTURY HOUSE It has been noted above that there is evidence that the street par- alleling this western defense line was also reused in the 12th century B. C. In striking contrast to the MB II C-LB I periods, there were very few structures in this area in Iron I-II, and these must have been extremely poor. The area was pocked by numerous refuse pits. The same was true of the area east of the street. In fact, in SW 1-9 alone there was evidence of some 17 pits, most of them quite deep, cut in the 12th century B. C. In marked contrast to this desolation was the discovery of a beautifully preserved 12th century B. C. house lining the west side of the street at the southern end of the excavation theater (Figs. 24 and 25). It must have stood in relative isolation. Actually, the phase illustrated was preceded by an original phase in which Rooms 3 and 4 were a single room and served as the court. Both phases belong to the early 12th century B. C., since a detailed study of their pottery does not yield any typological distinctions. It was followed in the later l12th century by the construction of an even more substantial house, but this was less well preserved. The doorway was through Wall 119, the curb line of the earlier streets, though evidence for a 12th century street did not appear at this point. The area between the south end of Wall 129 and the doorway was disturbed by a later cistern, and Room 1 may have been more carefully delimited by walls. Room 2 was a court with Tabun 124 and two deep pits, 134 and 146. Pit 146 was found partly stone-lined and plastered, and originally may have been completely so prepared.

C. Taanach, for, besides a pillared wall belonging to the late 12th century B. C. successor to the Twelfth Century House, this same feature is a characteristic of the Drainpipe Structure at the southern edge of the summit (Fig. 26). The additional work on the structure this season 56 makes it clear that it was a courtyard house, similar to the Twelfth Century House even in the founding of some of its walls on LB wall lines. Perhaps it even adjoined the same street. While somewhat conjectural, it may be proposed that in its early 12th century B. C. phase it was probably also a house with rooms on three sides of an internal courtyard. The larger stones of Wall 164, like the more massive structure over the Twelfth Century House, belong to the late 12th century phase, when the southern rooms were apparently eliminated. To the west and north the court was terminated by pillared curtain walls. Wall 5 appears to be the west terminal wall, Wall 14 probably to be assigned to a subsidiary building. The north wall of the house should lie just north of the excavated area. Besides the features previously described, mention should be made of the sump (17) with a pipe from the north under the higher, late phase cobble north of Wall 15 and of the pillared walls. Dismantling parts of Wall 212 revealed three small troughs set between and east of the wall, two of them flanking Bin 186. They were fronted by a bed of small stones, similar to the previously enigmatic Locus 177, which now seems to have been similarly related to a pillared wall bounding the court on the north. The striking contrast between the fine houses and the large area pocked with pits in the southwest quadrant in the 12th century B. C. calls for interpretation. Perhaps this evidence suggests that Canaanites and Israelites lived side by side at Taanach at the beginning of the Iron age. THE NORTHEAST OUTWORK The sixth chapter of Sellin's first final report is devoted to a curious structure called Das Nordostvorwerk.57 It seemed to represent a solid projecting tower in a defense line on the sharply defined shoulder at the north of the tell, but the line was nestled at the base of the mound (Fig. 27) rather than at the outer edge of the shoulder, from which there is a sharp drop to the floor of the Esdraelon Valley. This monument attracted the only excavation our expedition undertook outside the south- west quadrant of the mound. It was a small operation aimed at dating the structure and elucidating its function by cutting a section through it (Fig. 28). Sellin's description of the structure as built on bedrock, faced with nicely cut (and, we discovered, reused) ashlar blocks, and filled with roughly cut stones and rubble was confirmed (Fig. 27). In addition, to the north of the "outwork" two beautiful pavements were discovered, "6 For the work of previous seasons see BULLETIN, 173, pp. 23-26; 185, pp. 21-26. 7 E.

Accordingly, a visitor ascending the northern shoulder at Taanach in the late ninth century B. C. would have entered a spacious open pavement observed by a watchman from the projecting tower of the lower defense wall. To enter the town he would have had to pass through this lower enclosure wall as well as the defense line at the crest of the mound. The Figure 28 section provided other interesting information.

The ninth century installations cut through the MB II C glacis, which had its base on the inner edge of the shoulder. The ninth century defense lines and pavement were refurbished and utilized in the Persian period. The chief lesson of the sounding, however, was that occupation at Taanach in the late ninth century B. C. was more substantial than has been indicated by our excavations in the southwest quadrant. THE NEW CULTIC STAND In his first campaign at Taanach in 1902 Sellin discovered what he designated a Rducheraltar. Up to the present it remains one of the most fascinating and unusual objects of cult to emerge from the excavation of an ancient Palestinian town."9 The area opened in 1963 with the hope of finding cultic material was plotted in the vicinity of the findspot of the Rducheraltar, and that hope was realized.60 At the beginning of the 1968 campaign it was discovered that a large pit in SW 2-8, located within a few meters of the 1963 cultic finds, had nearly destroyed a well-constructed cistern shaft. The shaft was noted by Sellin, and the pit may be presumed to be part of his search for pieces of the Rducheraltar. The upper portion of bedrock into which the cistern itself had been cut had collapsed onto a thick silt deposit in the cistern. This resulted in the covering of the cistern by material from the earliest layers of occupation at Taanach belonging to the EB age. When the EB debris was removed, it was discovered that its weight had pressed broken pieces of a cultic stand of the same type as Sellin's into the soft silt layer. This in part accounts for the remarkable state of preservation of the stand (Fig. 29) even after it was shattered by a 10-m. drop down the cistern shaft and crushed by tons of fallen bedrock. From the silt layer came also a tall cylindrical cultic stand with hori- zontal bands of turned-down tab handles,605 plus chalices and sherds of the late tenth century B. C. It seems clear that the finds in the silt layer are contemporary with the other cultic remains discovered in 1963 and with Sellin's Rducheraltar. The stand is a hollowed square over half a meter tall of poorly fired clay. The base is open, but the top is capped by a shallow basin. The outside of the basin is decorated with an applied band of doubly raised circular discs. Beneath this at the front are four registers in high relief. At the sides in the lower three registers are the reliefs of the bodies of the pairs of figures whose faces appear on the front of the stand. Each side of the topmost register bears the complete relief of a winged beast. The back of the stand is plain except for holes, which are also frequent " No adequate photographs have yet been published. Cf. Sellin, Tell Ta'annek, Pls. 12-13. A.

The stand displays evidence of use, but there is absolutely no trace of smoke or burning to be associated with its use. The lowest register has a naked female of Astarte type flanked by two lions with teeth bared and tails flying in the side panel. The crudely formed fingers of the female grasp at the ears of the lions. The second register consists of a pair of winged sphinxes. Their female appearance and hair suggest their identification as cherubim. In the third register from the bottom the traditional scene of two goats eating from a stylized tree of life is flanked by a pair of lions, virtually identical with those in the lowest register. This register is identical in motif with the lowest register of Sellin's stand."1 In the center of the top register stands a young bovine facing left, surmounted by a winged sun disc. The bovine is flanked by what is apparently intended to represent a pair of voluted columns. The columns are flanked by objects which might perhaps represent cultic stands. The upper register is flanked on each side by a griffin. As kindly pointed out to me by Y. Yadin, the registers, considered as independent units, bear close resemblance to orthostats associated with Syrian temples, most notably at Carchemish. In addition to the parallel employment of relief, the symbols used are strikingly from the same repertory, in agreement with their similar date. In this light the cheru- bim, lions, and voluted columns reproduce orthostats flanking temple or shrine entrances. The bovine might represent or serve as a stand for the deity of a specific temple, to which the Taanach cult was related. the winged disc being the symbol of that deity. Unfortunately this symbol is too fluid in its usage to permit identification of the particular deity with assurance."2 The careful reader will have observed that I have not followed Sellin in identifying this cultic stand as a Riiucheraltar. This designation has become traditional, along with the interpretation that a fire, built in the base, warmed the incense placed in the shallow basin at the top. Neither in the cultic stands from Taanach, nor in the " house stands " which preceded them, nor in the more common cylindrical stands which also support shallow basins has there ever been discovered evidence of burning or incense. It seems more likely that these stands were used for libation. The holes may better be considered vestiges of windows of the preceding " house stands " rather than smoke holes. However, until a scholarly consensus on the function of these stands emerges, I have preferred to designate this piece de rdsistance from Taanach with the noncommital designation " cultic stand."

Findspots in 1968 support the conclusion of the previous seasons that this type was com- mon in both the 15th and 19th centuries B. C. at Taanach.64 It has not been found in MB II C contexts although a very similar Astarte type is represented (TT 1472). The related type with forehead symbol was not represented in this season's finds, but the first example of this type outside Taanach and Megiddo has been recently published.65 The only complete example of a plaque-type figurine from Taanach is illustrated in Figure 30 (left). Its immediate context and also that of a fragment of this type (TT 1406) are the first evidence that this type was introduced at Taanach before the end of MB II C. Comparison with previously published fragments 68 makes it clear that this MB II C -LB I type was not highly standardized. Eighteen of the 108 figurine pieces from our excavations were of this type. The figurine at the right in Figure 30 is unique at Taanach, and I am not able to cite a satisfactory parallel. It comes from a mixed fill in SW 6-5 containing EB II-III, MB II C, and LB I potsherds. ASTRAGALI A single pig astragalus with a smoothed side was recovered from a reliable EB context in SW 1-8, the first worked astragalus from an EB context to my knowledge. Single examples of a pig and a sheep astragalus with a smoothed side came from LB I contexts respectively in SW 1-7 and 5-8. A group of twenty pig astragali came from an LB I context directly under the Cultic Structure in SW 2-7. A pig astragalus was also discovered in the richest MB II C burial described above. Since the report on the 1966 season, groups of pig astragali have been published from three tombs of the Iron II period.67 Interesting observations have been supplied by Oscar Broneer on astragali excavated in Greece, where they are found in large numbers." 64 Cf.

The English title in Qadmoniot does not reflect the writer's intention, since the text of the article argues against the use of the stand for incense. 1" BULLETIN, 173, p. 42, Fig. 22: 8-11. 17 S.

Professor Saul Weinberg has observed to the writer that groups of astragali are frequently encountered in tombs excavated in Greece. The astragali are assumed to come from sheep or lambs and are usually considered play or gaming pieces. 6s Letter of 19 January, 1968. He also notes that, while those from his excavations have never been analyzed, they are assumed to come from sheep and lambs. 45</page><page sequence="45">Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research He calls attention to groups of astragali coming from his excavations in the Sanctuary of Eros and Aphrodite on the North Slope of the Acropolis in Athens and from wells in the South Stoa at Corinth.69 He notes that both findspots are near cult places of Aphrodite and that " the pig being a symbol of fertility is often enough associated with the %.. .. . lX. -, -.- ----- .. . . .. : . .V :C4" FIG. 30.

This evidence points more toward the use of astragali as fertility amulets than as charms against the evils of the underworld,72 but these 69 Cf.

That the astragali of different animals may have had specialized usage is suggested by an inscription indicating that gazelle astragali were dedi- cated to Asklepios in Athens.73 LOOMWEIGHTS Over 50 examples of the " pendent weight " type illustrated in Megiddo II, Plates 169-70, were recovered at Taanach, a few with thread marks suggesting loom use. Only one had a poor impression of a Hyksos scarab, but it was remarkable that not a single example came from a context with material later than LB I. This agrees with their range at Megiddo from Stratum XIII-IX (MB II-LB I). As at Megiddo smaller " dough- nut-shaped" loomweights also appeared in MB II C-LB I Taanach, but never much more than 3 cm. in height.74 This type was also common in the Iron age, but the larger examples of this type are not attested at Taanach before the tenth century B. C. Well-fired examples of the larger type do occur, and these may also have been used as loomweights. Most of the hoard of over 60 large " doughnuts" in the Cultic Struc- ture were unbaked, extremely fragile, and could hardly have served as loomweights. An admittedly enigmatic cultic function was suggested on the basis of parallel groups from cultic contexts at Megiddo and Jerusalem.5 Now it appears that the "loomweight" excavated by Starkey in the Solar Shrine 78 may also have been a cultic indicator.77 This discovery suggests that groups of these "doughnuts" may have been used to absorb heat in connection with the burning of sacrifices.78 Perhaps the large eight-handled crater in which the Taanach hoard was found was also associated with sacrifice. SCARABS The best preserved scarabs from the 1968 season are illustrated in Figure 31. The first is from an MB II C-LB I fill, the second from an MB II C context with intrusive Roman sherds, and No. 3 is from an LB I context. Nos. 4-9 are from MB II C adult and child intramural burials. Diana Kirkbride's negative judgment on the chronological value of the much larger corpus of scarabs from Jericho seems to fit the Taanach scarabs.79 None of the well-dated groups of scarabs from 7" Wm.

Your scarab shows that even pieces without any other decora- tion can be regarded as late." This scarab underlines the difficulty of using even royal scarabs as chronological indicators apart from their stratigraphic context.80 s0 Compare the controversies over chronological conclusions, e. g., O. Tufnell, Lachish IV (Text: London, 1958), pp. 109-110: R. Giveon, "Royal Seals of the XIIth Dynasty from Western Asia," Revue d'tgyptologie, 19 (1967), pp. 29-37. Note that the problem of intrusion is eliminated at Taanach, for there was no occupation at the time of 12th Dynasty Egypt. The best evidence bearing on whether this was an heirloom comes from an examination of the scarab's material and workmanship, which in the case of the Taanach exemplar are indistinguishable to a layman's eye from that of other clearly Hyksos scarabs. 48</page><page sequence="48">Number 195 October, 1969 AN EARLY BICHROME BowL The bowl illustrated in Figure 32 has the typical MB II C chocolate paint on a cream-to-white surface with the characteristic motif of a wavy line between two straight lines.
