<plain_text><page sequence="1">45 RITUAL AND SECULAR USES OF VIBRATING MEMBRANES AS VOICE-DISGUISERS* By the late PROFESSOR HENRY BALFOUR, F.R.S., sometime Curator of the Pitt Rivers Museum, University of Oxford. (Tiv section revised by CAPT. R. M. DOWNES, M.C., formerly Resident, Colonial Service) NOTE.-Professor Balfour had been working on this paper for some long time, and had practically completed it when he died in 1939. The MS. sheets and the illustrations were collected together by the present Curator, Mr. T. K. Penniman, but publication was then impossible owing to the war. As much of the material is inaccessible elsewhere, and as we have received several requests for it, the paper is now published essentially as it was written, with the exception of the important section on the use of voice- disguisers by the Tiv of Northern Nigeria. This has been largely re-written by Captain R. M. Downes, MIC., incorporating new information obtained by him in the field. He has also added some notes elsewhere (initialled). The sketches are all by Professor Balfour. Unless otherwise stated the specimens illustrated are in the Pitt Rivers Museum; the numbers in brackets are those of the Balfour Catalogue, vol. 4. For the final preparation of the material for publication, and for the title, I am responsible. B. M. BLACKWOOD PITT RIVERS MUSEUM, UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD A group of "musical" instruments which has hitherto received but scant attention, is that com- prising instruments furnished, as an essential part of their structure, with a small buzzing membrane, which is thrown into vibration indirectly by air- waves generated at some distance from the xnembrane itself, this membrane being neither struck nor rubbed nor blown upon. When the membrane is set vibrat- ing by the impinging sound-waves created by notes emitted by the voice, or by wind or percussion instruments, an interference effect is produced by the creation of another set of air-waves, which causes a modification in the quality, or timbre, of the initial sounds which acquire a " reedy " or " nasal " in- tonation. One is tempted to describe such membranes as " sympathetic membranes " on the analogy of the " sympathetic strings " so frequently added to stringed instruments of music, e.g., the Viola d'amore, viol da gamba, baryton, tromba marina, now obsolete; the Hardanger fiddle, obsolescent; many native instruments in India (vina, saranghi, etc.). The peculiar " nail-violin " was also sometimes fitted with sympathetic strings, which responded to the vibrations of the metal rods, elicited by the friction of a fiddle-bow. But if we adopt this term, we must bear in mind that the analogy is by no means com- plete. " Sympathetic " strings, which are chiefly associated with instruments played with a bow, respond to and enrich the vibrations of those "bowed " strings with which they are tuned in unison or in harmonic relationship, and do not respond to vibrations from other, non-harmonic notes. The " sympathetic " membranes, on the other hand, are less eclectic in their response to sound-waves, and any note will set them vibrating. Their " sympathy " is, in fact, indiscriminating and it is not necessary to tune the membranes to any particular pitch. Their function is merely to alter the quality of the normal sounds emitted and to impart to these an abnormal timbre. One may class, " sympathetic membranes " in two categories :-( 1) A buzzing membrane may be used to modify or disguise the speaking or singing voice. (2) A membrane may cover a small hole added to a musical instrument and so situated as to enable the sound-waves, generated by playing upon the instru- ment in the normal manner, to impinge upon the membrane and so cause it to vibrate, when the interferent vibrations so initiated change the quality of the notes. Little attempt has been made towards a compara- tive study of instruments comprised within these two categories as a distinct group. This is due, no doubt, to the fact that in the more civilised countries instru- ments of the kind referred to have become obsolete or have degenerated into toys of little or no import- ance. And yet, the playthings of advanced culture* * Grateful acknowledgement is made to the Rivers Memorial Fund and to the Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford, for finanieal assistance towards the cost of publication of this paper.-Hon. Ed,</page><page sequence="2">46 HENRY BALFOUR frequently have an interesting and suggestive past history, traceable back to times when their prototypes functioned in all seriousness and when they even played a part as accessories in ritual. Their ritualistic use, indeed, has frequently caused them to be over- looked by investigators who have not been privileged to penetrate " behind the scenes " of native cere- monial. Such is largely the case with " sympathetic membranes " belonging to the first category, and it is with these that I am concerned in the present paper, in which I aim at bringing together such evidence as has been accessible to me as to the varieties and uses of membranous voice-disguisers employed by peoples in different stages of culture advancement. Instruments serving to disguise or modify sounds produced vocally through the medium of a vibrating membrane are for the most part of simple structure. They usually consist of a tube, or other hollow body, having two apertures, one of which remains open while the other is covered and closed by a very thin, sensitive membrane which is strained across the orifice and is fixed round the edges with some kind of adhesive. The membrane resembles a miniature drumhead. In some of the tubular forms both ends of the tube are covered with membrane and one or, sometimes two, open holes are at the side. In use, the performer covers the open hole with his mouth and either talks or sings into the hollow cavity. The sounif-waves set up in the air contained in the tube are transmitted to the membrane, impinge upon it and throw it into a state of vibration by which' a fresh series of air-waves is generated. It would appear that the impact of the rebounding air-waves from the membrane upon the vocally-produced sound-waves induces changes in the latter, the result of which is to impart a jarring or " nasal " timbre to the notes. The quality of the resultant tones may best be described by comparing them with the peculiar intonation im- parted to Punch's vocal efforts in a Punch and Judy show. But, although the quality of the sounds produced with the help of this instrument is harsh and even grotesque, the interference effectively changes the normal vocal tones and furnishes a voice-disguise which is frequently made use of for ritualistic and mystical performances. In describing the functional status and dispersal of " sympathetic membranes " used as voice-dis- guisers, I will commence with an area, West Africa, in which the instrument is not only widespread but also still retains much of its ceremonial significance. On'e of my objectives in a visit which I paid to Nigeria in 1930, was to make enquiry as to the varieties and functions of the instrument in that region among peoples -of primitive culture. Southern Nigeria Although the rapid changes which result from the opening up of the country are having their effect upon the native customs and practices and causing these to lose their original significance, we can still see these " voice-disguisers " functioning seriously and ritualistically among many of the pagan tribes, with whom the instruments are associated with mysteries and are used largely for %simulating the voices of ancestral or other spirits. Like the bull- roarer, these ritualistic membranophones are usually hidden from the women and the uninitiated, who must on no account know how the mystic " spirit voices " are produced. They form an important accessory in the outfit of many of the secret societies which exercise so dominant an influence in the social organisation of the pagan tribes. Among the Ibo of Onitsha Province, I witnessed in the village of Nkwele, representations of the Maw, or Mau, ceremonies or plays, in which completely disguised performers, maaun, masquerading as dead people, paraded making weird noises. The Spirit- impersonators were covered from head to foot with an odd assemblage of garments and rags, which completely concealed their identity (Fig. 1). A 0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ :FiiG.

Each masquerader carried in his mouth a small reed tube, about the size of a cigarette, the distal end of which was covered with a very thin white membrane derived from the egg-cyst of a spider';' the other, open end of the tube, was held in the teeth. When they spoke or sang, the membranes were thrown into vibration, causing the voices to sound harsh and nasal, a quality associated with spirit voices. I was shown one of these tubes, igwe, though great care was taken to prevent women seeing it. It was of the type represented in Fig. 2, G. 2.-VOICE-DiSGUISER OF SPEAR-GRFASs, BAT'S WING, MEMBRANE. IBo TRIBE. which is about the simplest of all. Women were present during the performance, but retreated rapidly when approached by the " spirits." Their shrinking back was accompanied by a good deal of giggling as well as squeals, and it was clear that the " mysteries " had already been shorn of much of their former significance and terrors. A little later I visited Aguleri, some 20 miles up the Anambra Creek, a small river which flows into the Niger just above Onitsha. I was taken by the Ibo chief, Idigo, to some of the villages on the high ground nearby, some of which I had already visited with Mr. Urquhart. These villages are pure " bush" villages, very little changed from their former state and hardly affected at all by civilised contacts. I will not describe their many interesting features, as that is outside the scope of this paper; but, inci- dentally, I was shown, with great secrecy, one of the Maw costumes, all females and children having been previously chased away. I was also able to secure, again with great secrecy and some reluctance on the natives' part, one of the "voice-disguisers" used by the JFiG. 3.--V OICE-DISGUISER OF BRASS, SPIDER'S ES G-CAS:E MEMBRANE. IBO TRIBE. 'These egg-capsules are commonly found attached to rock surfaces and they serve as a protection to the eggs and young of the spider. mauii. (See Fig. 3.) This consists of a short, curved length of brass tubing, longitudinally faceted, the opening at each end being covered with a membrane of spider's egg-cyst, a voice-hole having been punched in the centre of the concave side of the tube. Both membranes function equally and simultane- ously. The Rev. G. T. Basden describes these Ibo instru- ments as used in connection with Maw (" spirit ") ceremonies, which involve' a " visitation of spirits of the dead to their late familiar haunts." "Women," he writes, "are debarred from being in the presence of a maw on pain of severe punishment." The spirit impersonators are completely covered, no part of the body being visible, and wear masks. Their voices are disguised by the igwe, such as I have already described with its spider-membrane vibrator. Basden (1921, pp. 235, 236)2 adds, " The sound produced is very like that made by blowing through a comb enveloped in thin paper. In passing, one might remark that it is bad manners to perform on the paper- covered comb in the presence of Ibos; such music will be awarded a reception quite different from that expected; it will probably be taken as an insult rather than a joke." N. W. Thomas (1913, Part 1, pp. 41-42) also refers to the-masked figures called maun representing dead men, whose real nature is concealed from the women. He gives photographs of some of these mauin, showing the disguises, and adds " They usually speak in a whistling sort of tone, and this is produced by taking a small piece of wood in the mouth with spider's web at each end. Before he is initiated into the knowledge of the maauA, a boy has.to pay a fee of-perhaps ten shillings." The " piece of wood " must, of course, be hollow, and, when both ends 'are membrane covered, a lateral voice hole is essential. The examples he saw must have been of a type resembling those shown in Figs. 3 and 5. Dr. C. K. Meek kindly collected for me examples of the voice-disguisers used by the Ibo of Nobi village, near Onitsha, where they serve to simulate voices of ancestral spirits or the voice of Chukpu (Chukwu of Basden), the supreme god, when speaking oracularly. One of these is a tube of "spear-grass," FIG. 4.-VOICE-DISGUISER OF SPEAR-GRASS, LIZARD SKIN MEMBRANE. IBO TRiBE. 2 Mr. Basden speaks, of " blowing " signals on the igwe. This is not correct, as speaking or humming alone' set the membranes vibrating. Blowing would burst them.</page><page sequence="4">48 BHE J?

Amaury Talbot (1923, pp. 76, 77) of the Akan marionette play, as performed by the Jbibio tribe at Awa, on the Awa River, a tributary of the Kwa Ibo River, south- east of the Ibo country. The jointed marionettes are caused to perform by concealed persons, who also do the talking, though the uninitiated believe that the figures are actually speaking. "As each fresh mannikin appeared, a black cock was lifted up to touch it, in order, so it was explained, to confer upon it the power of speech and movement. The voices of the actual speakers were disguised by the use of a small tube made from corn-stalk covered with the membrane taken from beneath a bat's wing." It seems likely that the spirit voices heard during funeral ceremonies of the Ekoi of Oban, conducted by the Egbo Secret Society, are sounded with the help of a similar membranophonic instrument, though this is not certain from Mr. Talbot's description (1912, pp. 221 and 222, cf. also 1923, p. 157.) He says, in referring to the peculiar sound which was heard as the corpse was lowered into the grave, " This was said to be the voice of the invisible Egbo, lamenting over the dead chief. It was unfortunately impossible to ascertain the actual cause of the sound, but it was produced by something quite different to the bull- roarer."' Two specimens of voice-disguisers, okpili-nanwu, from southern Nigeria (exact locality not stated), were very kindly sent me by Dr. L. W. G. Malcolm. One of these (Fig. 9) consists of a tube made from the FIG 9.-VOICE-DISGUISER OF BONE, SPIDER'S EGG- CASE MEMBRANE. S. NIGERIA. leg-bone of some animal with each end covered with spider's egg-case membrane and with a central voice- hole. The other (Fig. 10) is longer and-the tube is of FIG. 10.-VOICE -DISGUISER OF REED -STALK, SPIDER'S EGG-CASE MEMBRANE. S. NIGERIA. reed-stalk, but otherwise is similar to the last. These are said to be used by the manwu, masked dancers impersonating ghosts, who talk into the instruments. " Manwu " may probably be a variation of maun, which N. W. Thomas suggests (1913, p. 42) may be derived from mwa (a person) and oAwu (dead). Dr. Malcolm also refers to another example, ok6wa, believed to have come from the Efik tribe of the Calabar District, in which the tube is of monkey's leg-bone, one end only being covered with spider's membrane, the other end, which is cut on the slant, being spoken or sung into. It was used by men and boys only, at the New Yam harvest ceremonies. Kamerun The Ekoi extend their range into the Kamerun region, and it may be well to consider this area next. Two voice-disguisers, similar apparently to those shown in Fig. 8, in the Ethnological Museum, Berlin, are mentioned by Dr. Ankermann (1901, p. 48) as having been procured from the Bassa tribe in Kamerun. He refers to these as F1'ten, but this term is possibly a misnomer, since instruments of this membranophone type have usually no connection with the flute series. He says that they were used by children. As in many other localities, they appear here to have lost any ritualistic or mystic significance. Dr. Ankermann figures (1901, Fig. 102) another example of peculiar and unusual construction, from Southern Kamerun. It is formed of two tubes of different lengths, the shorter being fixed at right angles to the longer so that their hollows communi- cate, forming a single tube, bent, as it were, at right angles. (Fig. 1 1.) The distal end of the shorter A B FIG. 11.-VOICE-DISGUISER, SPIDER'S EGG-CASE MEMBRANE AT A. S. KAMERUN. (AFTER ANKERMANN.) tube is covered with spider's membrane; the voice- hole is at the end of the longer tube. This was collected by G. Zenker, but details as to its use do not appear to have been furnished. Dr. L. W. G. Malcolm (1923, p. 398, Fig. 1 (a), and personal communication to the author) in describing the birth, marriage and death ceremonies of the E-yap tribe of Bagam, between Bamenda and Banum, Central Kamerun, figures and describes a single- membrane voice-disguiser, Uryi, made with a tube of bamboo about 7 3 cm. long, one end being covered with membrane from a bat's wing (sometimes the tissue of a spider's egg-case is used instead), which is cemented on with bees' wax; the other end is open. The tube was sung into by one of the chindas, or attendants, at a ceremony commemorating the death of one of the head chief's sons, whose virtues were P</page><page sequence="6">50 HENRY BALFOUR extolled. It is not certain that the performer was impersonating a spirit, but, by analogy, this seems to be probable. Dr. C. K. Meek very kindly gave me some notes on the Ndoro tribe, in the Mandated Territory of British Cameroons (administered as part of Adamawa Province), from which I extract the following;: " The principal cult of the Ndoro is that known as Ana or Anae. It is a cult of deceased ancestors (reckoned patrilineally as a rule) who are symbolised by three stones arranged in a circle, or by a pot or buffalo horns. The rites closely resemble those of the Jukun cult of Aku-ahwa, in which stones (corn-rubbers) and buffalo horns play a part as symbols of the dead. Soon after death the dead man's ghost is escorted to the shrine of Ana, and in the ensuing dry season he returns with the company of ghosts to declare to his relatives the cause of his death. He is personated by a man who disguises his voice by speaking through a piece of guinea-corn stalk, one end of which is covered with a filament of spider's web . . . the rites are surrounded with the same secrecy from women as guards those of Aku-Ahwa among the Jukun." Near neighbours of the Ndoro, to the south-east, are the Mambila (c. 110 20' E., 70 N.), among whom the cult of the dead involves the taking away of the soul of the deceased by the Kuru, or personified ancestors, to the grove in the bush where ancestral souls are wont to assemble. The Kuru emit sounds intended to represent the cries of the ancestors. Their leader " carries a trumpet of calabash, the end of which is covered with a bat's skin." (Meek, 1931b, Vol. 1, p. 555.) This so-called " trumpet " appears to be a variety of the voice-disguisers under consideration, with vibra- tile membrane, and cannot correctly be classed as a "trumpet." Dr. Meek further describes how the " tutelary genius known as Mbar, concealed inside a hut, addresses the dead man's relatives and friends . . . In making this announcement the genius uses a piece of guinea-corn stalk with a hole at each end and one in the middle. One of the end holes is covered with spider's web, and he speaks through the central hole. His speech is interpreted by one of the members of. the cult." This instrument would be of the type shown in Fig. 8. Dr. Giinter Tessmann (1934a, pp. 162 and 197, and Plate XXIV, Figs. 9-11, 13) describes the use of " mirlitons " among the Bafia of Central Kamerun (c. 4? 43' N., 110 12' E.), and he figures four examples. Those used by adults are made from human and leopard's bones and are tubular, with one end covered with spider's egg-case membrane, fixed with wax. A square hole is cut through the side of the tube, into which the performer sings or speaks. The type (Fig. 12 (a), (b)) resembles those which I hV,ve represented in Fig. 8, allowing for the difference in the material of the tubes. These voice-disguisers of the adults are carefully preserved by magicians in a bag and are kept hidden from the uninitiated. Youths also among the Bafia use variants of the instrument A B c FIG. 12.-VOICE DISGUISERS OF (a) HUMAN BoNE; (b) LEOPARD'S BONE; (c) ELEPHANT GRASS; (d) GOURD. BAFIA TRIBE. (AFTER TESSMANN) in their games, but only after initiation; the games appear to mimic the Elume cult ritual, and, the instruments must not be shown to women and uninitiated persons. The types used by the boys are either a tube of elephant-grass, in the side of which are two holes, one serves as a voice-hole and the other, smaller, is covered over with the spider's membrane; or the tube consists of the curved neck of a gourd, the narrow, closed end being pierced and covered with spider's tissue (Fig. 12 (c), (d).) A square hole is cut in 'the side for a voice hole. This last type is of interest as it supplies a link with Nyasaland, since this gourd instrument is practically identical with those which I saw in use by Nyasaland boys at Broken Hill. (See Fig. 29.) The Bafia have adopted a Bantu culture, and the presence of this specialised variant in two such widely-separated regions must be ex- plained by direct culture-affinity. Northern Nigeria Turning now to the Northern Provinces of Nigeria we find that simple types of membranophones, used for changing the quality of vocal sounds, occur widely. Dr. Meek (1925, Vol. 2, p. 21) makes the general statement that among the Pagan tribes of Northern Nigeria" the cry of the Dodo is made by blowing (sic)</page><page sequence="7">Ritual and Secular Uses of Vibrating Membranes as Voice-Disguisers 51 a tube, over the end of which is fixed a piece of spider's web." Dodo is the Hausa term for the embodiment of the spirits of the dead. At the initiation of youths the mechanism of the voice of the Dodo is explained to the boys. " Generally speaking, we may say that all those tribes who have the Dodo cult frankly admit that the intimidation of women is a main object of the rites." There is a close correspondence between the symbolism and practical application of this instrument and those of the bull-roarer, which also serves to simulate the voice of the Dodo with a similar ulterior motive, i.e., keeping the women in awe and subjection. From the Nassarawa (Benue) Province there is the following information. The Kagoma tribe, in the Jemaa Emirate, instituted a Dodo Society several years ago, with a view to exercising greater control over their wives and children. " Eventually, they took a gourd from the ' Kukan Chikki ' tree, and after scraping it hollow, placed some kind of parchment over its mouth. In the middle of the night this was blown (sic) with a terrifying effect (the noise is very like that produced by a comb and piece of paper). The women were very frightened and hid themselves. They were subsequently told this was the voice of the 'Dodo '-a mythical spirit well known in Hausaland -rebuking them for their misdeeds." (Temple, 1919, p. 182.) Youths at their initiation were savagely flogged, their shrieks adding to the terror of the women. Later, the mechanism of the mystic voice was explained to the initiates, who were then informed that " th6 whole society was really a conspiracy to keep their womenfolk in subjection . . . Finally each candidate had to take a solemn oath under pain of death that he would never reveal the secret. " (Temple, 1919, p. 183.) Mr. H. F. Mathews (1917, vol.l, p. 89), in enumerating the musical instruments of the head- hunting Nungu tribe in Nassarawa Province (now Benue Province) mentions buffalo horns and says " The buffalo horn is not blown, but sung into. A small hole is made near the end and then covered with a membrane. The membrane vibrates to the singing and the horn itself acts as a resonator." In a letter to me (7th July, 1918) in answer to an enquiry he writes: " The membrane on the buffalo horn is, I am almost certain, made from the egg-capsules of spiders." He does not connect the use of these membranophones by the Nungu with any mystic or secret performances. Mr. Mathews kindly sent me a voice-disguiser of a different type from Nassarawa Province (now Benue Province). (Fig. 13.) In this the body consists of a globular, hard rind fruit-shell having two half-inch apertures at opposite ends. One of the holes is covered with spider's egg-case tissue, fixed with gum or rubber; the other is the voice hole. This is the only globular example I have seen. FIG. 13.-VOICE-DISGUISER OF FRUIT-SHELL, BENUE PROVINCE. N. NIGERIA. From the Katab tribe of Zaria Province there is evidence (given to me by Dr. Meek) of the use of similar voice-disguisers in connection with the cult of the Obwai, or tutelary genius (Hausa Dodo), who seems to represent the plurality of ancestral spirits. This cult is in the hands of a secret society, used largely as a means of discipline for women and children. The Obwai is not seen but his shrill voice is heard, and I gather the quality of his voice is due to the vibratory interference of a membranophone. At any rate, among the neighbouring Kaji tribe, immediately to the South of the Katab, the Obwai is the centNal figure in the festivals which begin and end the agricultural year, when offerings are brought to the Obwai house. During the festival, the Obwai, who is apparently concealed in the roof, speaks to the assembly " in a voice disguised by the use of a filament of spider's web." The Hausa of Northern Nigeria are well acquainted with the cult of the Dodo (an ancestral spirit) and in some areas of their wide dispersal the voice of the Dodo is simulated through the medium of a membrane- covered tube, and knowledge of the instrument is denied to women and children. An interesting example of the instrument was given me by Dr. C. K. Meek, in 1922. (Fig. 14.) The tube is made from a FIG. 14.-VOIcE-DISGUISER OF BIRD'S WING-BONE. HAUSA OR JUKUN, N. NIGERIA. bird's bone, 19 cm. long, open at one end and closed at the other with a film of spider's egg-cyst. A wide longitudinal slot is cut in the side of the bone, extend- ing for a length of 7 5 cm., but not reaching the</page><page sequence="8">52 HENRY BALFOUR extremity. Around the tube is 'a collar of coarse cotton fabric, embroidered with purple wool in chequer pattern, and to this collar is fixed a large tuft of reddish chicken's feathers. This collar can be slid up and down the bone, so as to cover and close the lateral slot to a greater or lesser degree. Its function is not clear, but, possibly, some modification of the sounds may be effected by varying its position. This example was obtained from the Eastern Area of Northern Nigeria and is either of Hausa or Jukun origin, Dr. Meek was not sure which. In the north-western area of Hausa country, in the Province of Sokoto, we meet again with " squeakers " made from tubes of corn-stalk with vibrating meme branes of spider's tissue. These are used by Masu- dabo (the Hausa " Punch and Judy " man), profes- sional entertainers. I have not obtained one of these instruments from Sokoto, but my informant was Mr. P. G. Harris, who very kindly procured for me from that Province a very interesting membrano- phone variant, used as a voice modulator. This is the small Turu drum which is used by the "Dan Kama " (jester or juggler) in Sokoto Province. This (Fig. 15) FIG. 15.-DRUM USED AS VOICE -DISGUISER. HAUSA, N. NIGERIA. is a single-membrane drum with hollow wine-glass- shaped wooden body. A parchment membrane is strained over the upper orifice and is fitted with a " snare." The Dan Kama sometimes varies his entertainment by inverting the drum and talking, singing or whistling into the lower open end of the instrument; his voice causes the drum-head mem- brane to vibrate and to create thus an alteration in the timbre of the vocal sound. The " snare " probably helps in producing a comic intonation. (Cf. Harris, 1932, p. 115, Fig. 18.) One is reminded of Lord Bacon's discovery, early in the seventeenth century, of the responsive action of a drum-head to vocal sound-waves. He tells us (1661, Cant. III, para. 223) that " Prolata in orificio tympani modulata vox suaviorem redit vocem. Idem statuo futurum, si cantus in partes divisus variis immitatur tympanis. Elegantiae quoque novitatisque causa operae pretium esset cortinam extendere inter locum, quo tympana collocata sunt, et auditorium." William Rawley, in his English translation (1658) of the above passage, gives a free rendering of it, as follows: " If you sing in the hole of a Drum, it maketh the 8inging more sweet. And so I conceive it would, if it were a 8ong in parts, sung into several Drum8 ; And for handsomeness and strangeness sake, it would not be amiss to have a Curtain between the Place, where the Drums are, and the Hearers." Since the sound was considered to be improved by the use of a parchment reverberator, it is probable that the Baconian drum was not fitted with a " snare." In enumerating the Nigerian occurrences of this type of voice-disguiser with buzzing membrane, so far as they are known to me, I have left to the last the examples which are employed by the Tiv Tribe of Benue Province, Northern Nigeria. It is in this area that the most remarkable and elaborate types are found, together, apparently, with the closest link with the ancestral spirits, whose voices they serve to simulate. During a short stay in Benue Province in 1930, I made enquiries as to the types and use of such membranophones among the Tiv; and through the kindness of the Government Officials and of personal friends residing in the Province, I have managed to secure for the Pitt Rivers Museum a very interesting and striking series of the instruments. One marked feature of the Tiv examples is that they are anthropomorphic and, presumably, the human form used in the embellishment of many types represents the ancestors themselves, though whether special characteristics of the deceased are indicated in an attempt at portraiture is not clear. The great variety in the rendering of the human form suggests at least the possibility that this is so. In some instances the head alone is represented, in others, particularly those made of metal, the body and limbs are also rendered in whole or in part. I give a number</page><page sequence="9">Ritual and Secular Uses of Vibrating Membranes as Voice-Disguisers 53 of sketches and photographs of the instrument, which is called by the Tiv Imborivungu (plural Ambor- ivungu). The word Imborivungu appears to be compounded from Imbor (whistle) and Ivungu (the owl). In the Tiv scheme the owl (as well as other birds and animals of nocturnal habits) is thought of as a being embodied with spirits which are active during the hours of darkness. There are five species of Owl of special significance: the Lyungu-the Abyssinian spotted eagle owl (Buba africanus cinerascens); the Akiki-the pearl-spotted owlet (Glau83idium perlatum); the Kpili-Sjosledo barred owlet; Mtsan -the African Scops owl (Otus seneqalensis); the Gbev-the Standard Wing Night Jar (Macrodip- teryx longipennis). The voice modulating instrument by means of which the voices of ancestral spirits are simulated and contact with them obtained, is used in fertility rites and ceremonies for the expulsion of evils. All evils are thought of as emanating from the Mbatsav-the wise ones. Ts,av, which is almost the equivalent of mana, is a power force which can exist in human beings such as witches or in an ethereal form as " spirits " or even in inanimate objects connected with them. These " spirits," which probably had a human origin, i.e., ancestors, can re-visit the scene of their earthly life at night in the form of animals, birds or snakes to convey messages or omens either in a menacing manner or as friendly warnings. As there is more emphasis on the destructive than the beneficial, the Mbatsav are very much feared and the word Tsav (wisdom) is FIG. 1 6 FIG. 1 7 FIG. 1 8 VOICE-DISGFULSERS OF BONE. TIV TRIBE, N. NIGERIA. FIG. 19 D 3</page><page sequence="10">54 HENRY BALFOUR rarely used in its beneficial connotation, though it is clear that there are " helpful " as well as " destruc- tive " spirits (lbatsav). Most prominent amongst these " spirit carriers are the owls. As in life so after death, departed spirits may be good or evil, but in any case they are a fearful power force and may be a menace to the community- unless they are appeased or their danger- ous activities averted or directed into helpful channels. The omens or warnings that they convey must not be neglected and it is the function of the Tiv elders, who are themselves nearing the spirit world, to take the traditional action to prevent evils from coming in, or to drive them away should they materialise. If the elders fail in their efforts they are considered to be in league with the " evil powers," whilst if prosperity and health persist during their tiime they are believed to have the key to the beneficent ones. The Imbori- vungu may be described as an instrument of imitative magic, by the sounding of which, either with the imitated voice of the ancestor, whom it represents or portrays, or perhaps the voice of the owl in which the essence of the ancestor may be embodied, the attention of the ancestor known to be beneficent may be attracted and his power force directed to the group. The Tiv are unable to explain the method of use; it is generally said that it was blown (sic) into with a terr-2ying noise at night, the sound never being repeated from the same place. Among the examples of Imborivungu referred to in this paper we may distinguish three groups of vari- ants: (1) Those in which the tube is made of bone, often a humnan leg bone. These are surmounted by the representation of a human head in pottery, wood or other material and many are elaborately decorated with -engraved lines, abrus seeds, beads, tin pendants, &amp;c. (Plate I (a), (b) and (e) and Figs. 16-19.) (2) Those in which the tube is in brass, cast by the cire-perdue process in which Tiv craftsmen are expert; often the entire figure is represented in the casting, in other examples the head may be of a diffeTent material. The decoration may be simple or elaborate and either executed in the casting or added in the form of separately cast brass bells, abrus seeds, beads, &amp;c. (Plate I (c), (d), and Figs. 20, 21.) (3) Tubes made from leg-bones of Imborivungu type, with a lateral voice hole, but the specimens found are not all fitted with a vibrating membrane. These tubes are inserted into and surmounted by the actual skull of a dead person from which they project downwards like a stalk. The cranium is covered with human hair carefully stuck on with rubber and the head is variously decorated with seeds and other embellish- ments. The bone tube is usually engraved. (Plate II.) Descriptions of those I have figured will be found in FIG. 20 FIG. 21 VOIcE-DISGUISERS OF CAST BRASS. Tiv TRIBE. the list of illustrations and I will not describe each specimen here. Complete knowledge of the significance of these elaborate voice-disguisers of the Tiv has by no means been acquired, but, as previously indicated, there is no doubt that they play, or did play, a most important part in the cult of the ancestors. A description of the funeral rites of a venerated elder may be a help. On the death of an elder honoured as one who was able to avert evil and bring prosperity to his people (by means of his influence with the spirit world) it was the custom to place the body in a coffin cut out of a soft wood tree, in the bottom of which small holes were bored, to lay this on a trestle of crossed poles about three feet from the ground in his compound, and allow it to dehydrate. During this time beer was brewed regularly and singing and drumming took place. When the bones alone re- mained, the skull was removed and kept in a specially constructed bin, called Por, by the family elder who was next in precedence to the deceased. These skulls were often decorated in various ways. This form of</page><page sequence="11">Ritual and Secular Uses of Vibrating Membranes as Voice-Disguisers 55 the disposal of the bodies of venerated elders was called ityar. (There are several specimens of such decorated heads in the Pitt Rivers Museum.) In many cases these skulls were fitted with elab- orately carved thigh bones of the same elder, with voice holes and the end covered with a vibrating membrane. This is the origin of the Imborivungu in group (3). As most of these found have now no vibrating medium, it is believed that they became more in the nature of sacred relics to which the spirit or power force of the deceased was deemed to cling. These are never exposed to the public gaze but are carried by the family group elder in certain important rites that always take place at night. It seems that only one of this kind of voice-disguiser can exist in a family group, whose elder at times holds a feast called Biamegh, one talked of in a hushed voice; it is, of course, secret and little is known about it. During the more important rites for the prevention or expulsion of evils, the elder proceeds round the area at night carrying the Imborivungu and followed by men representing the owls, ivungu, and sometimes such night animals as the wild cat, bon. Each of these men carries a gourd, decorated to represent the bird or animal, into which he makes the hoot, screech, whistle or other sound in imitation of the subject. (Specimens of such gourds of various sizes may be seen,in the Pitt Rivers Museum.) Such rites are, of course, secret and may not be witnessed by women, children or the uninitiated on pain of death, i.e., punishment of the mbatsav. The seemingly direct association of the Imborivungu with the deceased, whose voices are simulated through the representation of the human form, is an interesting feature of the Tiv exahmples. Whether we can regard the embellishment as involving an attempt at por- traiture (i.e., representation of the individual ancestor) or not, human attributes are invariably added to the instrument, and it seems likely, and even probable, that the actual bone of a particular dead person was frequently used for making the tube thus identifying the voice-disguiser closely with that individual. The metal examples do not suggest such a direct associa- tion, unless the hair which often covers the head of the figure may have originally belonged to the individual commemorated. As previously indicated not all the Imborivungu are now functional as voice-disguisers, since some examples are not fitted with a vibrating membrane. In fact the holes which in the functional types would be covered with a membrane of spider's tissue or other substance are in some cases deliberately plugged up with gum, wax, rubber or other material. In all, however, the voice-aperture remains unclosed. From this it would appear that there is a tendency for the Imborivungu to acquire a non-functional but relic- like symbolism to which the power force (tsav) of the deceased is attached, and one must regard some of the obvious derivatives from the spirit-mimicking instru- ments as being emblems of the dead which no longer serve for simulating ancestral voices but which continue in use as symbols of the deceased by virtue of their form and power. This applies especially to those examples which are made of bone and are sur- mounted by an actual human skull. Many of these have no vibrating medium, the original aperture for this having been closed by plugging.3 All, on the other hand, have a carefully-made voice hole and otherwise resemble exactly the functional voice- disguisers. As it is, the bone tube seems to have become a stalk upon which the skull is mounted and by which it can be carried, though the derivation of the stalk from the Imborivungu is very evident. From the description of the specimens illustrated in this paper, it will be realised that although the essential features remain constant, there is consider- able variety in form, material and decorative treat- ment in these ritualis ic appliances of the Tiv. Elaboration and variety are, in fact, characteristics which seem to distinguish these instruments from those of any other region and this would suggest that amongst the Tiv their ritualistic importance is greater than it is elsewhere, though it may be that circum- stances have not arisen in other areas to bring these secret objects to our notice. The very ornate and striking forms given to so many of the functional voice-disguisers of this tribe, suggest that other than secret use may be made of the symbols and that they may, perhaps, be paraded in public, but there is no evidence of this and it seems certain that none but the initiated would be permitted to see them. It would be of great interest if further. light were thrown on the significance of these objects and the practices bound up with the control of society by means of the appeal to the supernatural, before a new order renders this more remote. The elders are not able to explain the background of their instinctive and mechanical actions, even if they were willing, and the members of a younger generation, in ignorance of the *true significance, believe in fantastic stories of were- wolves, vampires and ghastly witches' parties and horrid feasts, which make the contents of the " witch's cauldron " very mild in comparison. 3 In each of the three examples of this type in the Pit Rivers Museum, the lower end of the bone stalk has been plugged with wood. D 4</page><page sequence="12">56 HENRY BALFOUR FIG 22.-VOICE-DISGUISER WITH SPIDER'S EGG- CASE MEMBRANE. MANGU TRIBE, GOLD COAST. Gold Coast It is clear that these membranophones have a wide dispersal in West Africa. Ankermann (1901, p. 48) figures a simple example from the Mangu tribe (I assume that this refers to the Mangu of the north- eastern Gold Coast, about 100 40' N., 00 E.). This is a plain tube, about 12 * 6 cm. long with one end open and the other closed with spider's membrane, and with a lateral voice hole. (Fig. 22.) This is of the same type as the Ibo examples previously described (See Fig. 8.) The term " flote " applied to this instru- ment by Ankermann is, as I have before indicated, perhaps a misnomer and apt to prove misleading. French Congo From the.French Congo, in the area occupied by the Bantu-speaking Pangwe tribe, we have other refer- ences to this class of instruments in Western Africa. S. de Brazza (1887, p. 318) describes a ceremony of reception, from which women were excluded, held by Mamiaka, a chief of the M' Fan Osy6ba (" Pahouins ") in the Lope district, Ogowe River, situated exactly on FIG. 23.-CHIEF OF M'FAN OSYEBA TRIBE, FRENCH CONGO, PERFORMING WITH VOICE -DISGUISER. (AFTER DE BRAZZA.) the equator. In referring to the part played in the ceremony by the chief's nephew, he writes, " Il se bouche une narine et garde enfonc6 dans l'autre un roseau ferm6 par une de ces pellicules obz les araign6es tiennent leurs oeufs: ce mirliton etrange donne un son nasillard avec lequel il colore son role." The figure of this performer, here reproduced (Fig. 23), shows the voice-disguising tube projecting from the left nostril. In quoting this passage Lieut. R. Avelot (1905, p. 287), gives the native name of the instrument as abegne. A similar type of instrument is clearly indicated by A. L. Bennett in his " Ethnographical Notes on the Fang" (1899, p. 95), who are nearly related to the Osyeba and occupy an extensive area of territory between the Ogowe River and the Gaboon River. In referring to the Ak6m dance, which is performed by men only, he says: "The women must not see it. The latter stay within doors, and only hear the words which the men speak outside. The men speak with artificial voices, so that the women cannot recognise who it is that is speaking. To make the artificial sounds they use a membrane (ten) which encloses the young of the spider (ndenb6a). This they spread over a hole (about i inch diameter) near the small end of an elephant tusk (mbang nzok) from 1 to 2i feet in length, attaching it with beeswax (abe) or a liquid which is obtained from a plantain stalk fresh cut. This juice is called akirl. It possesses an adhesive property. The man blows (sic) on the large end of the ivory.4 A curious sound then issues through the membrane so that the man's voice cannot be recognised. The instrument is called mbang ak6m. The act of playing on the instrument is called e kobe ak6m (e kobe, talk). The performer sings songs; the words are distinctly heard." Mr. Bennett does not associate the Ak6m dance with religious ritual, though the Fang observe a cult of ancestors, and the exclusion of women, who are not allowed to know the origin of the mystic voices, suggests that here, as so frequently elsewhere, there is the pretence that the sounds are emitted by spirits. Guinter Tessmann (1913, vol. 2, p. 55 and Fig. 6) in his monograph upon the Pangwe, of whom the Fang are an important section, makes several allusions to the use of membranous vibrators for altering the timbre of the voice. The instruments are largely ritualistic, though some are used in hunting, and in modern times they are tending to los&amp; their significance as cult appliances. In the Sun-cult ceremonies, the Ndong- mba (who represents the Sun) plays his part as a spirit of disease, holding in his mouth a " mirliton " (elon), consisting of a hollow tubular stem, over one 4 It would be more correct to describe the performer as "talking into " than as " blowing on " the end of the trunk.</page><page sequence="13">Ritual and Secutar U8es of Vibrating Membranes as Voice-Disguisers 57 FIG. 24.-VOICE-DISGUISERS USED IN SUN-CULT RITUAL, PANGWE TRIBE, CONGo. (AFTER TESSMANN) end of which is strained a membrane of spider's egg- case, to modify the tones of his voice. (Fig. 24.) At a later stage, concerned with the initiation of youths, the elon is used first to frighten the boys; and, still later, instruction is given to them by the Ndong-mba FIG. 25.-VOICE-DIsGUIsER USED IN WATER-CULT RITUAL. PANGWE TRIBE. (AFTER TESSMANN) in its nature and use in provoking mystical speech (Tessmann, 1913, vol. 2, p. 57.) During the important ceremiony of the schok, a water-cult ritual, fully described by Tessmann (1913, vol. 2, p. 74 and Fig. 24), the medicine-man sings into a stout type of cmirliton," mnade from a piece of wood of the umbrella palm, the object being to imitate the voice of the elephant, which figures largely in this cult, as symbolic of water. (Fig. 25.) In a chapter on music contributed by E. M. von Hornbostel, the varieties of the " mirliton " among the Pangwe are enumerated (Tessmann, 1913, FIG. 26.-SPECIALISED VOICE-DISGUISERS OF WOOD. PANGWE TRIBE. (AFTER TESSMANN)</page><page sequence="14">58 HENRY BALFOUaR vol. 2, p. 325 and Fig. 126). In addition to those already mentioned above, as instruments associated with rituals, he describes and figures some specialised single and double box-mirlitons of wood (mbdti- ak'um, or endon-akurm). These (Fig. 26) consist of one or two membrane-covered tubes projecting from a hollow, box-like body. One of those figured is carved in human form with well represented head; the box forming the body and the pair of tubes the legs of the figure. This type recalls the anthropomor- phic voice-disguisers of the Tiv of Benue Province, Nigeria, and suggests a link with these. These box-mirlitons are nowadays available for profane use, but their former ritualistic status is indicated by their being sounded behind houses and not in public view, as also by the anthropomorphism of one of the types, which suggests a former associa- tion with an ancestor cult. We may gather from Tessmann (1913, vol. 1, p. 139 and Fig. 88) that simple membranophones are sometimes employed by the Pangwe for purely utilitarian purposes, as lures in hunting monkeys and birds. For a monkey call a discoidal fruit-shell, perforated through the centre, is used; it is not specifically stated that this is mem- brane-covered, but the name eloni, applied to it suggests that this is so, and the shape of this type closely resembles the pottery voice-disguisers of the Ibo (See Fig. 6). For a bird-call a tubular form of "niirliton" is employed. There is some confusion between these two types of hunting-calls, since Tessmann's description of the figures does not tally with his text reference. (There may be a close connection between these instruments and the bird and animal sound-mimicking gourds used by the Tiv of Benue Province, Nigeria, which are not known to be used as " lures " but as instruments of preventive magic. They have no vibrating membranes. See p. 55. R. M. D.) Passing now away from the western areas of Africa to other parts of the continent, I have records of membranophones used as voice-disguisers from various regions showing that their African diffusion is wide- spread. Sudan Dr. G. T-essmann (1934b, p. 219) refers to the use of this instrument, as a toy only, among the Baja of Bosum (c. 70 10' N., 160 E.), in the Central Sudan. Here the type is a simple tube of grass, closed at one end with spider's tissue, with a hole in the side for a mouthpiece. It was introduced into Bosum from the Kare, who live about one degree further north, and amongst whom the instrument is also a mere toy. From the brief description we may infer that the Baja examples resemble those from the Ibo of Ogoja Province, Southern Nigeria. (See Fig. 8.) Uganda Among the Bunyoro (Bakitara) of Western Uganda there is used a children's toy called enyamulere (plural, nyamulere), consisting of a short length cut from the hollow, curved leaf-stalk (kuguru kwekisunsa) of the Squash plant (bisumsa). The two open ends of the curved tube so formed are then covered with membrane from spider's egg-cases, and a V-shaped notch is cut in the centre of the concave surface of the tube. The cutting is performed with rumuli, or dry " elephant grass" and this notch forms the mouthpiece into which the child hums, a weird modification of the vocal tones resulting. No ritualistic significance attaches to the performance. I am indebted to Mr. A. K. Nyabongo for this information. Tanganyika The Warundi of Urundi, north-east of Lake Tanganyika, use this instrument, according to J. M. M. van der Burgt (1903, p. 387 and Fig. 86), though, apparently, only as a toy. He writes: " Les enfants emploient, comme jouet, une espece de mirliton (akasitori, ikironge). C'est un bout de roseau avec un trou (embouchure) au milieu. Les deux extremites sont fermees avec du tissu blank ou de la toile d'araignee." This corresponds in type with the Southern Nigerian examples shown in Fig. 5. Nyasa Dr. F. Fuilleborn (1906, vol. 9, p. 240 and Plate 50, Fig. 19) refers to an example collected by himself in the Nyasa-Ruvuma district in Urambia, which lies north-west of Lake Nyasa (90 30' S., 330-340 E.). He writes: " Eigentlich nur ein Kinderspielzeug schien eine Flote zu sein, die ich in Urambia sammelte und bei der das eine Ende mit einer der bei Trommeln beschriebenen Spinnen-Membranen uiberzogen war, so dass sie einen summenden Ton erzeugte: ahnlich wie wenn unserer Kinder auf einem mit Seidenpapier uiberspannten Kamm blasen." This example (to which the term flate is, perhaps, misapplied), with its single membrane and lateral voice hole, corresponds in type with that shown in Fig. 8. In the Ethno- graphical Museum, Berlin, there is (or was) an example from Unika, South of Lake Rikwa and north-west of the northern end of Lake Nyasa. (Ankermann, 1901, p. 48.) It is apparently similar to the Mangu specimen. (Fig. 22.) Some years ago, I procured through the Universities' Mission to Central Africa, several voice-disguisers which came from Likwenu village, north of Zomba, Shire Highlands, Nyasaland. Each of these (Fig. 27)</page><page sequence="15">Ritual and Secular U8e8 of Vibrating Membrane8 a8 Voice-Disyui8er8 59 FIG. 27.-VOICE-DISGUISER oF REED. SH[RE HIGHLANDS, NYASALAND. consists of a tube of stout, hollow reed, about 33 cm. to 26 5 cm. long, having a node at the centre. The node has been pierced and therefore does not close the tube at this point. One end of the tube is open and the other closed with a membrane. of spider's egg-case, which is bound round to hold it in position. Close to the central node, and between the latter and the membrane is a rectangular voice-aperture, which can be spoken or sung into. The instrument is, appar- ently, a mere toy and has lost any ritualistic signifi- cance which it may formerly have enjoyed. I have not, in fact, so far obtained evidence of the association of these instruments with ritual or secret societies in this region. All the descriptions which I have hitherto noticed of these membranophones from the Nyasa and Tanganyika areas, agree in referring to them as toys, though it seems highly probable that a ritualistic function anteceded their profane use. Northern Rhodesia The Babemba (Awemba) of north-eastern Rhodesia employ varieties of this instrument, and although their use appears to serve a practical purpose only- as a mimetic call in hunting-a certain amount of ritual is observed and controls their use, and their efficacy is largely dependent upon magic. The sound is not attributed to any spirit. The instrument, chinyenye (Fig. 28), which has only recently been introduced into Bembaland, consists of a short tube cut from the horn of a Duiker (mpombo), a small antelope (Cephalophus grimmi ?), or from a reed. One end of the tube is covered over with spider's nest membrane; the other end remains open. According to the Rev. R. D. Macminn, who very kindly furnished me with the information through Dr. Audrey Richards: " The hunter blows into the horn or reed, producing short, shrill screams in imitation of the Mpombo's call. The hunter prepares his own horn or reed. The instrument has no magical power in itself; this power is provided by ' medicine ' put into the instrument. Would-be successful hunters procure the FYcG. 28.-MIMETIC CALL OF DUIKER HORN. BABEMBA TRIBE, N. RHODESIA. ' medicine ' from successful Nimrods by purchase or otherwise (not by stealing), and place it in their instruments; they also get a lesson in blowing the instrument (which does not take long to learn) from someone who is an adept. There are a good many kinds of 'medicine' ; some ' medicines ' attract the game, while others restrain beasts of prey, which are apt to approach on hearing the call. The hunter, before starting, addresses the ' medicine ': ' I got you from So-and-so, a famous hunter, by purchase, or as a gift (I did not steal you). Do your duty accord- ingly. I have rolled on the ground before the Spirits, and before God, begging Him to give me of His cattle.' Some kinds of ' medicine ' cease to be effective if a woman looks on the chinyenye, and are rendered useless if a menstruating woman enters the house in which it is put away." Since the chinyenye is sounded by blowing and emits a single note only, it does not strictly belong to the category of instruments with which I am here dealing. It is not used for modifying vocal tones. But it is closely similar to some of the voice-disguising instruments, and there can be little doubt as to its morphological affinity to the latter series, although it differs functionally. Its being taboo to women is a further point of resemblance. I made a facsimile of Dr. Audrey Richards' specimen and with it I can easily produce "short, shrill screams," as described by Mr. Macminn. What appears to be an identical instrument is recorded by W. D. Hambly (1934, p. 143) as used by hunters of the Ovimbundu in Angola. He writes: " A hunter who works alone may excite the curiosity of an animal by blowing through (sic) the horn of an antelope. Spider's web covers the wide end of the horn." When I was staying at Broken Hill, Northern Rhodesia, in 1929, as the guest of the Provincial Commissioner, Mr. T. Sandford, I was entertained with a performance of the " Residency band " which consisted of four of the Resident's native boys, who performed upon " mirlitons," each made from the neck of a large calabash, forming a stout tapering tube, wide open 'at one end and rounded off at the other end, which was perforated and covered with a spider's egg- case membrane. (Fig. 29.) On the convex side, about 6 5 cm., from the membrane is a rectangular voice hole. The performer hummed his tune into this and the membrane imparted a blaring quality to the notes, faintly suggestive of a brass instrument,; the</page><page sequence="16">60 HENRY BALPOTUR FIG. 29.-VOICE-DISGUISER MADE FROM NECK OF GOURD. COLL. IN N. RXODESIA, BUT PROBABLY FROM NYASALAND. four performers together contrived to evoke a con- siderable volume of sound. I ascertained that these boys came from Nyasaland, and, no doubt, the instruments were suggested by types belonging to that region, as they do not appear to have been long known in Northern Rhodesia. South Africa From South Africa (i.e., south of the Zambesi) I have one reference only to the use of these instruments. Among the Bavenda of the Zoutpansberg District, Northern Transvaal, the instrument appears in connection with the initiation of girls in the musevetho (girls' initiation lodge). HI. A. Stayt writes (1931, p. 139): "The function is held in a hut in a small enclosure outside the village. Here Nonyana, the spirit of the musevetho, lives and manifests himself to the initiates ... Nonyana himself is a man disguised in bark and reeds. He carries a reed pipe in his hand, and is supposed, by the uninitiated, to be the embodi- ment of a spirit. One end of his pipe is closed with a piece of spider's membrane and, when blown, produces a weird, characteristic sound." Here again the instru- ment is described as being sounded by " blowing," but, since, in the next paragraph, Mr. Stayt refers to Nonyana " talking through his reed," it appears to indicate that the membrane is acting as a voice- disguiser and that it is the vocal tones which are modified by it. Mr. Stayt tells us that the musevetho was introduced among the Bavenda by the Basutho, who occupy the adjacent area to the west and south-west. Possibly, though I have no direct evidence of this, the membrane voice-disguiser may also be used by the latter tribe.; and further investigation may reveal its more widely dispersed use to the south of the Zambesi. There can be little doubt that the use of buzzing membranes for altering the quality of the voice is far more widely spread in Africa than is indicated in the above notes. As a serious appliance, for use in the ritual of secret societies and as a means of simulating spirit voices, associated largely with ancestral cults, it still seems to be widely diffused; but the tendency for the instrument to degenerate into a mere plaything and to lose its ceremonial significance is very notice- able, and in many areas it has become a toy shorn of all mystery. India Special interest attaches to the fact that in another Old World region, widely separated from Africa, we find identically the same simple mechanism for modifying sounds produced vocally, that is, by the employment of a membrane which is thrown into vibration by the impact of vocal sound-waves. In India instruments occur which, through the technique of their sounding mechanism, must be classed in the same category as those which I have already described from Africa. The occurrence of such instruments has been noted by Rai Bahadur Sarat Chandra Roy among the Oraons (or Kurukhs, as they call themselves) of the plateau in the central and western parts of the Chota Nagpur division of Bihar and Orissa. The Oraons, he thinks, probably came originally from Southern India, reaching their present location via the valley of the Son. Mr. Roy writes (1915, p. 184): "A peculiar musical instrument which Oraon bovs make for them-</page><page sequence="17">Ritual and Secular Uses of Vibrating Membranes as Voice-Disguisers 61 selves is the small pyramid-shaped hollow earthen instrument, from six to nine inches in height, known as the Giiguchui, or To-roro. It has its narrower end covered over with a spider's net, and is blown with the mouth of the player at the other end. It is played upon by young boys and girls at the chhali bechna or angan dances." Angan courtyard of a house; angan dances are " courtyard " dances, and these take place in the month of Aghan (November- December). In a letter to me, Mr. Roy writes that, in using the instrument, " the boy pronounces with a loud voice the word ' toro-roro ' (or ' turu-ruru,' or 'kokho-cho') andthere is a shrill reverberation." Mr. ImI A~~~~~~~~~~~ B FIG. 30.-VOICE-DISGUISERS OF UNBAKED CLAY. ORAON TRIBE, CHOTA-NAGPUR, INDIA. Roy very kindly sent me two small-sized examples of the guguchu, as used in the angan dances (Fig. 30). They are roughly made of unbaked clay, hollow, with thick walls, tapering slightly from one end to the other. The wider end of the tube is open; the other end is closed and in one (Fig. 30 (a)) is recessed with a deep cup-like hollow; in the other (Fig. 30 (b) ) it is rounded and only very faintly recessed. In the centre at this end is a small perforation about 2 to 3 mm. in diameter, and this hole is covered over with fine membrane. It is particularly interesting to note that the membrane employed is identically the same as that prevailingly used for the same purpose in Africa, viz., the closely textured tissue spun by spiders for protecting their eggs and young. These spiders' membranes are collected by Oraons from the leaves of padi and sword-grass, upon which they are spun, and can only be procured during September and October, when the rice-plants are standing in the fields. The guguchu are thrown away and crumble to dust when the season for their use is over, and this, coupled with their brief seasonal employment, makes them difficult to obtain. Indeed, it appears that very many Oraons do not know of their existence even. There does not appear to be any religious or ritualistic association with their use. Their seasonal recurrence would appear to be determined by the seasonal avail- ability of the spider's membranes. I have been unable to hear of the occurrence of similar instruments among the less-advanced peoples in other parts of India, though, if the Oraons migrated from Southern India, as suggested, we might expect to hear of their use among the Dravidians of the South, and enquiries for them should be made. But there exists among the Hindus of northern India an instrument of peculiar interest, which is clearly related to the guguchu but which is character- ised by the specialised method of its employment. I refer to the well-known nyastaranga (or nyasataranga). This is the Bengali name for the instrument, its ancient Sanscrit name being upd-nga. It is " exten- sively used by Hindus in the United Provinces, and particularly at Mathura and Brindaban." (Tagore, 1877, p. 28, 1885, p. 18.) In appearance, the nyastaranga resembles a common Indian type of trumpet, and consists of a conoidal tube of brass (or sometimes, silver), with flaring bell-mouth and cupped FIG. 3 1.-THROAT TRUMPET nyad8tcaranga. HINDU. UNITED PROVINCES, INDIA.</page><page sequence="18">62 HENRY BALFOUR mouthpiece. (Fig. 31.) The concave mouthpiece is perforated with a small, central hole, after the fashion of many of the Indian trumpets. The instrument is, however, no trumpet, but a specialized variety of the membranophones with which I am dealing. Over the hole in the mouthpiece is fixed a delicate membrane (again derived from the egg-cyst of a spider), which is caused to vibrate by sound-waves produced vocally by the performer. But the special and unique feature of the nydstaranga is the fact that, unlike all the other membranophones to which I have alluded, the mouth is not applied* to the embouchure. Instead, the " mouthpiece " is pressed against the player's neck, externally against the larynx. (Fig. 32.) The vibra- FIGI. 32.-PERFORMER UPON A PAIR OF nyastaranga. tions created by singing or humming are communi- cated to the membrane from the vocal chords via the cartilages of the larynx and the dermal tissues of the neck. We are informed by Tagore that the instru- ment can be " made to produce sound when placed upon the cheek or nostrils." The membrane picks up the vibrations and causes a change in the timbre of the notes, which are reinforced by the hollow tube acting as a reverberator, and are of a clear, reedy quality. Usually the instrument is used in pairs, one pressed on either side of the neck of the performer. It is not easy to make the nydstaranga function properly. Mons. Victor Mahillon failed after many attempts, and when describing his efforts (1893, Pt. I, p. 119), "Cet insucces que nous attribuons a une explication incomp]ete du procede, ne doit pas etonner, puisque aux Indes meme les personnes capable de jouer de cet instrument sont peu nombreuses." His failure may possibly have been due to his having fixed the mem- brane, as he says, underneath the perforated disc of the " mouthpiece." I have several times obtained a successful result by placing a piece of goldbeaters' skin on the upper, concave surface of the disc, and I was able to demonstrate the effect of the instrument, as a modifier of vocal tones, to Mr. Christopher Welch (1911, p. 121, footnote), to Dr. E. B. Tylor and others. But as far as I am aware, no description is available of the correct method of fixing the membrane, and one must make one's own experiments; success is by no means invariable, and I have failed, I must admit, more often than I have achieved the desired result. Although the ny4staranga is a specialized, type within the group of membranophonic voice-disguisers, it none the less belongs to this category of instruments, technically and mechanically, and is differentiated from the rest only by the manner in which the vocal vibrations are communicated to the membrane. Java Pursuing our search further eastward, we find reference by Dr. Curt Sachs (1929, p. 107) to the use of a " mirliton " in Java. Under his heading " Nasel- hautchen (Mlirliton)," he mentions the employment of a tube with lateral voice-hole and with both ends covered with membrane. He gives as his authority, J. S. Brandts Buys, in his article on " Snorrepij- perijen," in Djawa, IV, 1924. I have not been able to see his original reference. Solomon Islands Still further eastwards, there occurs in the Solomon Islands, a peculiar analogous instrument which was seen and described by H. B. Guppy (1887, p. 142) as follows: " That schoolboy's delight, the ' paper-and- comb instrument' finds its counterpart in these islands. On one occasion when I was enjoying a pipe and watching the surf on the south coast of Stirling Island, a young lad, who accompanied me, amused himself with some rude music by holding in front of his lips, as he hummed a native air, a thick leaf in which he had made a hole about half-an-inch wide, leaving the thin transparent epidermis intact on one side; the vibrations of this thin membrane gave a peculiar twang to his voice." It is difficult to determine whether this peculiar variant is to be regarded as phylogenetically related -to the rest of the group of membranophones with which I am concerned. It is quite aberrant as regards its mode of construction, and may possibly have an independent origin, in spite of its mechanical and functional identity. As far as I am aware, in the geographical dispersal of this type of instrument-from Java to the Solomon Islands-the hiatus between the two areas is unbridged</page><page sequence="19">Ritual and Secular Uses of Vibrating MeJmbranes as Voice-Disguisers 63 through as I have not heard of occurrences of allied types in the intervening area. For the present, we must leave the question open. Europe Turning now to Europe, we find instruments of this class surviving nowadays only as toys, unconnected with any form of ritual or serious usage; although during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries more or less serious use, in inusical performances, of vibrating membranes for imparting a peculiar intonation to the voice, seems to have prevailed. The instrument known as theflute eunuque orfl,ate d l'oignon, evidently was held in some esteem in French musical circles during the reigns of Henri III and Louis XIII. Mons. G. Chouquet says of a fivite eunuque in the Conservatoire de Musique, Paris (1884, No. 422), that it appears to date from the period of Henri III (1551-1581). Mersenne, whose illustration (1636, Lib. II, prop. i, p. 74) is here reproduced (Fig. 33), says FIG. 33.-" FLUTE EuNuQUE m OF WOOD. FRENCH, 17TH CENTURY. (AFTER MERSENNE) that under Louis XIII (1601-1643) concerts of "eunuch " flutes were much in favour. I quote the passage in his own words: " Superest quarta tibia, quam vulgo nuncupant Eunucham; sed potiius locu- tione quam inspiratione canit, refert enim solummodo vocem ejusdem, quo profertur, acuminis, quae bombo a pellicula ovina tenuissima, vel cepicia repercutitur, et novam gratiam acquirit; illa vero pellicula obducitur foramini A, super quod ad modum pellis tympani tensae et filo circa tibiam circumligatae imponitur operculum A B multiforatile; per C autem sonus libere egreditur. Neque desunt qui cantilenas 4, aut plurium vocum hisce tibiis recitent." (Mersenne, 1636, p. 75). These instruments were, however, merely "dummy " instruments, whose shapes simulated various types of flutes and other wind instruments, but whose function was to modify sounds produced vocally, through the medium of a fine membrane (e.g., the thin skin of an onion, very thin parchment, gold-beaters' skin, etc.) which covered one orifice and was protected by a covering-cap of wood. Another hole, usually at the side, was sung or hummed into, and the vibrations of the membrane imparted a nasal quality to the vocal tones. The effect of four or five voices in concert, even when their timbre was thus metamorphosed, may have been fairly attractive, and, S$ 4 ' O * . _w 0 b A_ 0 A- 0 FIG. 34.-" FLU}TE EUNUQUE." FRENCH. C. 1800.</page><page sequence="20">64 HENRY BALFOUR at any rate, must have proved quaint and amusing, though little was gained from a strictly musical stand- point. Still, the popularity of these performances is guaranteed by Mersenne and others and the dummy instruments were made with skill and care. Early examples are by no means common, but several are preserved in museums. Julius Schlosser (1920, p. 90, Plate 37, Nos. 249, 250, 251) describes two specimens, which simulate double-flutes, believed to be of German origin of the sixteenth century, and a pair of the seventeenth century, oboe-shaped, obtained in Italy, now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. Other examples are in the Conservatoire de Musique, Brussels; the National Museum, Munich (Mahillon, 1893, vol. 3, pp. 226-227); the Crosby Brown collec- tion in New York, and, doubtless, elsewhere. I have abquired, through the kindness of Mr. A. Nettlefold, one of two examples formerly in the collection of Miss E. A. Willmott. They are described as French, circa 1800. The one which I now have is shown in Fig. 34, and is entirely of wood, lathe-turned. The tube has a cylindrical bore of 1 4 cm. diameter. Below is fixed a wide-flaring bell-mouth. The upper end of the tube is covered with a thin membrane (actually missing but probably originally of onion skin) which is bound round with waxed thread. About 9 cm. below this there is a single hole in the side of the tube-the voice-hole. The membrane is protected by a large elliptical, multi-perforated cap, or cover, made in two halves and easily removable. The resemblance to a wind instrument is purely fictitious, and the instrument is merely an elaborated " mirliton." The performance is purely vocal. An instrument closely modelled upon the eunuch flute of Mersenne, was made by Barr, of Bow Lane, London, early in this century, and enjoyed popularity under the name of " zazah," or " voice-flute," being used by performers in mimic bands, whose voices furnished the actual notes, which were given " instru- mental " effect by the vibrating membranes (Welch, 1911, p. 119 and Fig. 55). When the singing was in parts, the effect was pleasing. The native " band " in N. Rhodesia, previously referred to (p. 59), was a similar performance, but in unison, with more simply constructed instruments. In the Victoria and Albert Museum, S. Kensington, there is a large flu'te d bec (formerly in the Carl Engel collection) which has been the object of some con- troversy. Its true nature has been ably discussed and diagnosed by the late Christopher Welch (1911, p. 125, and Fig. 59) who proved that, instead of dating from the seventeenth century, as had been supposed, it must have been constructed about 1809 or 1810 by Goulding &amp; Co?, of London. By the kindness of Mr. Bracket, I was able to examine carefully the specimen 0 0 :FIG. 35.-" FIrPI,-FUJTE"X OR RFworDJER. ENGLISH.</page><page sequence="21">Ritual and Secular Uses of Vibrating Membranes as Voice-Disguisers 65 and to make the drawings here reproduced. (Fig. 35.) Without going into detail, the instrument may be described as a fipple-flute of boxwood, having eight stops (seven finger- and one thumb-stop). Fitting over the fipple is a pyriform, hollow cap, which serves as mouth-piece and air-chamber. At one side of the wooden cap there is a small hole, which is covered with a very thin membrane, perhaps gold-beaters' skin, and it is this feature which gives a unique character to this otherwise normal fipple-flute or " recorder." William Chappell (1855, vol. 1, p. 246) following Salter (1683) considered that a " recorder " should be furnished with an extra, membrane-covered hole, " situated in the upper part of it, i.e., between the hole below the mouth and the highest hole for the finger," and that it was this accessory which gave the instru- ment its name. But, it is to be noted, in the " freak " instrument the membrane-covered hole is situated on the removable cap, that is, between the mouth-piece and the " voice " of the flute, and it could, therefore, have no effect in modifying the notes sounded by the flute itself. Mr. Welch came to the conclusion, and I entirely agree with him, that this instrument was designed to serve a double purpose, and that the performer, while playing the flute in the normal manner (by blowing through the air-chamber), simultaneously hummed into the embouchure, thus throwing into agitation the membrane, whose vibra- tions 'modified the vocal notes and intensified them. Experiment amply supported this diagnosis. The instrument must, in fact, be regarded as a combination of two distinct types: (1) the fipple-flute, or recorder, (2) the eunuch flute. On it, a single performer could, as it were, play a duet, by combining in one instrument two totally different types of sound-producing mech- anism, the one strictly instrumental, the other vocal with tympanic sound-modifier. The latter feature in its construction brings this particular flute within the category of the instruments which are the subject of this paper. Apart from those instruments of the " eunuch-flute" type, which were used more or less seriously in chamber music and were made with care, the " voice- modifying" instruments of Europe and Great Britain must be regarded as mere toys. At best, or, perhaps I should say, at worst, they function in " jazz bands," serving to emit intentionally comic sounds, or to convert ordinary vocal notes into the semblance of instrumental music, the membranophones being frequently shaped so as to simulate various types of orchestral'instruments. These toy gadgets are known by a variety of names, such as mirliton and bigotphone in France, kazoo and zazah in England, vocophone, zobo-ftute or zobo-horn in America, sing-schalmei in Switzerland, and so on. I figure here a couple of varieties only, as it seems unnecessary to multiply instances of these degenerate " musical " toys. An example of the sham wind-instrument type, obtained in England but probably of French make, is shown in Fig. 36. Outwardly it simulates a / I' FiG. 36.-Toy MIRLITON. FRENCH. horn, the tapering tube being of cardboard and the cup mouth-piece of wood. Into the smaller end of the tube is inserted a half-tube, formed by splitting a piece of reed-stem in half longitudinally. Across the hollow of this is fixed a grating of fine metal-gauze, over which is laid a thin rectangular piece of mem- brane, fixed at its two ends, but free to vibrate at its centre. When one hums or talks into the embouchure, the membrane is set vibrating by the impinging sound- waves and the notes are rendered harsh and metallic in quality, owing to the membrane vibrating against the grating. This type is an elaborated version of the " comb-and-tissue-paper " voice-disguiser, the im- provised delight of children, to which allusion is made by Filippo Bonanni (1722, p. 86 and P1. 42) in the early eighteenth century. The other specimen here figured (Fig. 37) is a typical example of a modern French " mirliton." It consists of an internode of stout reed, 22 * 3 cm. long. Each end is membrane-covered, and at the side close to each end is cut a wide, V-shaped notch which forms a hole leading into the tube. This is the voice-hole into which the performer sings or hums. Either end car, be used, and if the voice-hole at the other end remains open, only the nearer membrane will vibrate; but by U1</page><page sequence="22">66 HENRY BALFOUR FIG. 37.- MODERN FRENCH "MIRLITON." closing the distal hole with a finger, both membranes will be agitated simultaneously. This simple form of " mirliton " was in use early in the eighteenth century, as Bonanni (1722, p. 85 and P1. 38) mentions and figures an analogous instrument, though his descrip- tion lacks detail. He also refers to a variant in the following terms: " Uno simile si f'a con la Canna palustre, togliendo una porzione di essa per il lungo con il cortello, in modo, che rest,i la vacuita della Canna coperta da una sottile membrana, che tali Canne sogliono avere, si suona con il fiato, come se si volesse suonare una Trombetta; onde rende voce acuta, e treinolante, in modo, che sembra esser suonato quell' Instrumento, che communemente si dice Sordino." This latter type is of interest, since it recalls the improvised instrument seen by Guppy in the Solomon Islands (vide supra p. 62). In both instances the natural delicate skin of plant-growth carefully exposed in situ, serves as the vibrating membrane. The flatsche of the peasants in the Carinthian Laventtal appears, from Curt Sachs' brief mention of it (19.20, p. 1 9), to be a very simple type of cc mirliton," made from a piece of bark, which is held before the mouth and is " angesummt." Its form is not described. These simple types of European toy membrano- phones would, perhaps, hardly be worthy of serious mention, but for the fact that they are concerned in and give rise to a problem of ethnological interest. There arises the question of the origin of the European adoption of vibrating membranes as a mechanism for altering the timbre of sounds produced vocally. We have seen that Francis Bacon, early in the seventeenth century, realised that the taut parchment of a drum could be set vibrating by vocal sound-waves caused to impinge upon it, and that the quality of the notes was thereby modified (vide supra, p. 52). We know further, that special instruments, such as the eunuch " and " onion -flutes were in popular use for chamber music during the sixteenth and, seven- teenth centuries in Western Europe, and these may, possibly, be regarded as the outcome of experiments similar to that of Bacon. Again, the various types of toy " mirliton " in Europe may be looked upon as degenerate, simplified and cheapened derivations from these, and as ultimate descendants from the Baconian prototype. On the other hand, we have the African and Indian series of instruments exhibiting exactly the same mechanical principle and application. Are these to be regarded as having originated independently ? Although in form the African and Indian examples differ from one another, they suggest, nevertheless, a common origin, not only by reason of their similar function, but also because of the peculiar nature of the membrane which is most commonly adopted in both regions-the delicate tissue of the egg-cases of spiders. The use of this material in both areas does not, of course, prove a common derivation, but it does render it highly probable. Morphologically, there is little to suggest that the European series is to be traced to India for its origin; but the simpler types of French " mirlitons " certainly do suggest a morphological link with the more typical African " voice-disguisers," and we must contemplate the possibility of these simple types of Europe being derivatives from the African series; or, it may be, the reverse. The pros and cons should be weighed. The widespread use in Africa of these " voice- disguisers " in serious ritualistic and mystical perform- ances, especially as a means of simulating the voices of spirits in ancestor-cult ceremonies, points to a certain degree of antiquity for the instruments in that continent, where, as in Europe, they are tending in recent times to degenerate into mere toys. Had the instrument been introduced among the Negroes by European missionaries, or other invaders, it would,. presumably, have been brought in as a plaything, without suggestion of mystical application, since no such ritualistic use is recorded from Europe. It seems most unlikely that the adoption of the instru- ment for ritual in connection with secret, mystical performances, should have arisen from a previous acquaintance with it as a profane toy of exotic intro- duction, since, if this were so, women and uninitiated persons would already be perfectly aware of the manner in which the" mystie " sounds were produced, and this trick of the agents of Secret Societies would be common property and shorn of all mystery. Hence, as far as Africa is concerned, we must, I think, assume that, as with the " bull-roarer," the ritualistic antedates the profane use of these mem- branophones, and is referable to some antiquity, also that it appears improbable that the instrument was first introduced among the Negroes by Europeans. Unfortunately, I have been unable to ascertain how early it was known in Europe that tense membranes could be thrown into vibratory response to the human voice. It is possible that Francis Bacon was merely stating an already well-known fact, and that the</page><page sequence="23">Ritual and Secular Uses of Vibrating Membranes as Voice-Disguisers 67 prototype of the fl?te eunuque may, perhaps, have long antedated Mersenne's description of that instru- ment. But it is difficult to see how early European voyagers to West Africa, in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, could have acquired from the natives a first knowledge of the instruments, which at that time, presumably, were restricted to secret mystical ritual, were hidden from all uninitiated natives, and were, therefore, unlikely to be displayed to strangers. There is, consequently, much difficulty in assuming a common prototype for the European and African series, and, in spite of the morphological close simi- larity of, certain of the simpler variants in the two areas, it may be a case of convergent types descended from independently - invented prototypes. Proof, either one way or the other, may never be reached, though further research may strengthen the theory of diffusion and render less likely the theory of independ- ent origin. At present it seems wiser to keep an open mind and not to jump to either conclusion. Bearing in mind, however, that even such simple appliances as these may have an important bearing upon ethno- logical problems of wide interest, I hope that the publication of these notes may stimulate further enquiry and be a means of eliciting fresh inform- ation.
