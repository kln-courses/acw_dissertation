<plain_text><page sequence="1">Creating junior ethologi^M It is often said that a dog is your best friend. In fact, after cattle, dogs are the oldest domesticated animals. Dogs have lived with humans for over 10,000 years and have been selectively bred for various types of domestication. Domesticated dogs have performed many roles in society throughout history - rescue dogs, hunting dogs, guide dogs, and police dogs to name a few. Besides dogs, humans have opened their homes to numerous organisms, including cats, birds, lizards, snakes, and rodents. Yet, how much do we really know about the animals that live with us? And, have these animals learned from us? Sometimes we know more about animals in the wild from research journals, television documentaries, and science re- searchers, than the animals in our own homes. The study of animal behavior is called ethology . Ethologists, such as Diane Fosse and Jane Goodall, have provided systematic observations over time to highlight complex social relationships of primates. You can foster scientific observation by having your students conduct similar observations with animals at home or at school. Qathering baseline data when observing your pet Did you ever think that observing your dog, cat, fish, bird, or reptile could prepare you for long-term science investigations? Indeed it can! The basis for developing scientific thinking is improving observation skills. Through observation, students can gather data to help interpret their environment and then draw conclusions. They can gather data on their pets by asking questions such as: What type of food does the animal eat? What quantity of food is necessary? What environmental conditions are best? Are there changes that occur in the animal's appear- ance over time? Does it molt or shed? Does its color change? How long does the animal sleep? How much physical activity does the animal require? Does your animal learn new things? Can you observe animals' learned responses ? So, is it true that animals are able to learn? Initially, students must define the term learning . Scientists have generally de- fined learning as a process that leads to observable changes in behavior. These changes may be related to experiences that an organism has encountered. In fact, your students may learn that their pets' behaviors have been shaped by the actions of the students or their families. The animal behaviors that your students observe may be divided into two broad categories: Instinctive behaviors and learned behaviors . Instinctive behav- iors are those that are inborn. For example, a newborn gerbil will instinctively crawl toward its mother's body for the pur- poses of warmth and to attach itself to the nipple for nourish- ment. Unlike instinctive behaviors, learned behaviors are those which are not based on biological predispositions. In- stead, learned behaviors are based on observable actions. In the early 1900s, scientists known as behaviorists sup- ported a stimulus-response approach to learning. Researchers such as Edward L. Thorndike, with an instrument called a puzzle box, and Burrhus Frederick (B. F.) Skinner, with a Skin- ner box, studied how the presentation of material impacted behavior. Since that time, many studies have elaborated on how learning occurs. Studies in neuroscience, cognitive sci- ence, psychology, and education provide information to ex- plain complex behaviors. However, in this investigation, stu- dents will be involved in recognizing some learned behaviors of their pets in terms of stimulus-response. Animals in your home may learn behaviors in different ways. In general, these include trial and error, conditioning, and insight learning. • Trial-and-error learning - Trial and error occurs when an organism repeats a behavior in order to become more skill- ful in a particular activity. • Conditioning - Did you ever notice what happens when you grab a dog's leash? Many times, the dog is excited, think- Stephen J . Farenga is an associate professor of science education, Beverly A.

Procedure 1. Observe the aquarium from a distance. Notice where the fish are swimming in the aquarium and what they are doing. This will allow you to gather baseline data on what we will consider to be the natural activity of the organisms in the aquarium. Record your observations. 2. As you approach the aquarium, what changes, if any, do you notice in the fish behavior? Have the fish clustered together? Are they swimming close to the top of the tank? Do you notice any additional movement or activity within the aquarium? Record your observations. 3. Can you develop a hypothesis to explain why any of these changes may have occurred? One possible hypothesis is that the fish swim to the top of the tank because someone approaching the tank will feed them. Record your hypothesis. 4. Move away from the aquarium and repeat Steps 1 through 4 again after one hour. Record your observations on any similarities or changes that occur. Activity 2 - Behaviors to be observed: Fido response chart Parti 1. Can animals learn with practice? B. F. Skinner, the famous psychologist, used rewards to train animals to perform various tasks (see box). Read Skinner's experiment and determine if you have ever done something similar in the way you have trained your animals at home. Record your answers. Skinner developed devices known as Skinner boxes. The Skinner box consists of a metal cage, a metal grid floor, a bar that can be pressed down, and a food tray that is connected to a machine that delivers food pellets. A white lab rat is placed into the Skinner box and will engage in many behaviors, but will rarely press the bar. The food pellet machine is adjusted so that it delivers a food pellet to the food tray each time the bar is pressed. As soon as the rat presses the bar, a food pellet appears in the tray and the rat will eat the pellet. Over the course of this learning session, the rate of bar pressing will increase (Mayer 2002). Part 2 You may have taught the animals you live with to behave in a certain manner without even realizing it. The following activity allows you to analyze your behaviors and the reactions of the animals that live in your home. In the following table, you will notice an action that can be taken in order for an organism to behave in a certain way, in this case, a dog. One important role of science is to explain and predict behaviors. Identify the behavior that is observed after your action is taken. Also, identify possible explanations of these behaviors. The first example is provided. Filling Fido's dish with food !

In actu- ality, the dog has learned to associate the sight or sound of a person picking up the leash with being taken for a walk. Learning to associate a stimulus with an event is known as conditioning. • Insight learning - Insight learning is when you transfer your knowledge of a past activity to a new situation. In this situ- ation, there is no period of trial and error. It is most com- mon in primates (e.g., chimpanzees, great apes, and humans). Anthropomorphic descriptions: Uncovering misconceptions We call a description anthropomorphic when it suggests hu- man characteristics for animals or inanimate objects. In dealing with animal observation, students often attribute human feelings and reasons to an animal's actions. This can often lead to a misinterpretation of the animal's be- havior. In the included activities, students should be en- couraged to associate the stimulus that initiated the be- havior with the response that is observed (S-R). This may avoid more romantic, anthropomorphic descriptions, which hinder an accurate explanation of animal behavior. Further investigations Parrots and other similar birds that talk have interested us since ancient times. Only since the late 1970s, however, did we realize that birds possess extraordinary intellectual abili- ties. Dr. Irene Pepperberg of the University of Arizona has demonstrated that birds are capable of behaviors beyond simple mimicry. Dr. Pepperberg, who is currently examining the intellectual levels of four African grey parrots, concluded that the oldest parrot, Alex, is able to count, identify ob- jects by shape and color, and understands the concept of same versus different. Students may wish to investigate the work of Dr. Pepperberg, who works with many types of bird species, as well as the work of other ethologists who study the behaviors and abilities of other animals.
