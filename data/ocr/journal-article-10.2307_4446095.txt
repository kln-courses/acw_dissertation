<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE NOT-SO-TERRIBLE OCTOPUS; JELLYFISH AND THEIR RELA- TIVES; LOOKING LIKE WHAT YOU'RE NOT. 1972 Xerox Education Publications (1250 Fairwood Avenue, Columbus, Ohio 43216). 16 mm color- sound films. 28 minutes. Purchase $410 each. Each of the twelve films in the Won- ders of the Sea series examines a specific animal (barracuda, octopus, sea turtle) or group of animals (crustaceans, coelen - terates) or a set of adaptations (camou- flage, locomotion). Although the teach- ing guide suggests a viewing order for all the films, each film is independent of the others. The series was produced at Marine- land of Florida, with an original copyright date of 1969. The footage and manner of presentation is obviously outdated when compared to the many more recent films on marine life. Viewers familiar with other marine biology films will also recog- nize some of the footage from other films, such as The Living World of the Sea series, distributed by Macmillan Films, Inc. (By way of comparison, the Xerox series stretches each film to 28 minutes, while the Macmillan series covers some of the same concepts much more concisely in 12 minutes.) In general, the photography is not outstanding. Although some of the close- ups are very good, many of the in-tank shots are poor. In one case, the narration repeatedly refers to seeing the animals at night, while the photography was ob- viously done on a shallow reef during the day. The fuzzy sound track is neither very original nor particularly appropriate. Although it doesn't detract from the film, it doesn't help either; it's just there. Of the three, Looking Like What You're Not is the most usable. A good sequence of a marvelously camouflaged</page><page sequence="2">sargassum fish catching and swallowing a prey as big as itself is followed by examples of false eyes, pattern disrup- tion, and behavioral adaptations that help animals escape predators and capture food. The film is accurate in its representations and doesn't belabor identification of all examples given. Al- though the final sequence on sponge crabs is much too long, the film would generally be suitable for junior and senior high school classes as an introduction to a marine biology unit or an animal be- havior unit. The Not-So-Terrible Octopus is also too long. The close-up photography of the development of octopus eggs and their hatching is done well, but again, the film spends a great deal of time on one static shot while the script goes off on a tangent to give more information on a topic or to slip into an anthropomorphic description of the motives of the octopus. Jellyfish and Their Relatives is a waste of time. It gives little information, is poorly photographed and, with the ex- ception of a section on the Portuguese Man O'War, is dull. The teaching guides give an overview of the entire series, a one-paragraph synopsis of the film, and a few questions for discussion. Follow-up activities are also listed (the same for all the films) that will probably be of little use unless the teacher has a fair amount of back- ground in marine science. Some teachers might find a place for one or two of the films in the series, but there are a number of other films avail- able that cover the subjects as well or better. Linda Wilson John G.
