Robert Schu- mann's book On Music and Musicians contains the composer's reviews written between 1834 and 1844. The body of the 274-page work, which caused Virgil Thomson to call Schumann "the best music critic who ever lived," is devoted to masters like Beethoven, Bach, and Mozart and contemporaries. The price is $2.45. The New Music, 1900-1960 by Aaron Copland has been newly re- vised to include composers and move- ments up to electronic music.

MEXICAN-AMERICAN EDUCATION in the Los Angeles school system is the subject of a fifty-seven-minute black-and- white film: "Education and the Mex- ican-American." The documentary first half records a community demonstration for such improvements in the schools as bilingual education, recognition of the Mexican-American heritage, and teach- ers' knowledge of Spanish. The second half is a panel discussion of the issues raised, by a group of educators. The 16 mm. film sells for $340 and rents for $18, from the University of California Ex- tension Media Center, 2223 Fulton Street, Berkeley 94720. ARRANGING - COMPOSING BOOK.

The sixty-three- page book is published by Kendor Music, Inc., Delevan, New York 14042. BRER RABBIT PLUS MBIRA. "Afri- can Story-Songs," a long-playing record from the University of Washington Press, sings/tells African folktales with a mbira, or thumb piano, accompaniment. The story-songs often resemble the Amer- ican Brer Rabbit stories, especially in their use of cunning, anthropomorphic animals victorious over force. Ideal for use in elementary grades, the story-songs almost demand an oral audience response -as they are originally meant to-to the texts in both Shono (Rhodesian) and English. The record was made with the assistance of and tested in the Se- attle public schools, and can be obtained from the University of Washington Press, Seattle 98105. KABUKI THEATER MUSIC and its history and relation to the drama are the subjects of Nagauta, the Heart of Kabuki Music by William P. Malm. The book attempts to analyze the foreign and seemingly formless (to Western ears) shamisen music, and in the process pro- vides insights into the problems of com- parative musical analysis. The book also contains the first complete scores of nagauta music in a convenient insert. The illustrated book, including a Glos- sary-index and a Discography, sells for $10 from Charles E. Tuttle Company, 28 South Main Street, Rutland, Vermont 05701. FACSIMILE MANUSCRIPT.

The full-size reproduction, made with the consent of the National Orchestra Association, owners of the original manu- script, shows the many variants between the original and today's commercially accepted text. The manuscript may be ordered from Oxford University Press, 200 Madison Avenue, New York City 10016. RATTLES, BELLS, AND DRUMS. The myth of the primitiveness of Afri- can music is exploded in a twenty-two- minute color film, Discovering the Music of Africa. Ghanaians using native instru- ments reveal the complexities of bell, drum, and rattle usage, for example, how messages and even poetry are played on the drums. Suitable for elementary to college level, the film, priced at $250, may be obtained from Film Associates of California, 11559 Santa Monica Boule- vard, Los Angeles, California 90025.

New York's Ocean Hill-Brownsville Experi- mental School District was the subject of an article in Interracial Books for Children (summer 1969), published by the Council on Interracial Books for Chil- dren, Inc. A group of editors and pub- lishers investigated reading needs in the district, and the article contains their observations. The shortage of special in- terest books for Negro and Puerto Rican students is an acute problem; books that treat the realities of inner-city life, such as the popular, simplified adaptation of The Autobiography of Malcolm X, are scarce. Bilingual books about the her- itages of minority children are also needed. Another problem is the length of time that elapses between a book's pub- lication and its appearance on school shelves-sometimes as long as thirty-six months. On the other hand, the article describes some creative efforts of the school district: nongraded progression, daily "contracted" curricula, bilingual classes, and reading "huts" filled with audiovisual equipment. Information may be obtained from the Council at 9 East 40th Street, New York City 10016. ] JANUARY, NINETEEN SEVENTY READING AND WRITING MUSIC By Dr. Tibor Bachmann Designed to teach children to read music and to sing by reading.

But that's what prototypes are for- to improve. If we made one proto, we made fifty. Gave them to the pros for proving. Got them back with ideas, suggestions, and worse. We recalibrated leadpipes, re-worked bell flares, recalculated bore and tapers, perfected valves, reduced weight and explored acoustics and resistance-for five long years. Today, there isn't a trumpet in the world that plays like an Olds Custom, sounds like an Olds Custom, oris made like an Olds Custom. Ask the guys in Fat City. They don't send them back anymore. TIME OF THE HORN, a seven-minute, "creative expression" film, relates a small Negro boy's discovery of a discarded trumpet and his rise above the surround- ing slums by using his imagination. Espe- cially useful in fostering creativity and motivating interest, the black-and-white, 16 mm. film is appropriate for music and other subject areas. It costs $40 and may be purchased from Journal Films, Inc., 909 West Diversey Parkway, Chicago, Illinois 60614.

The 393-page, illustrated book is divided almost equally between discussions of his life and his music. The cost is $2.25. The Theories of Claude Debussy, Musicien francais by Leon Vallas is a 189-page discussion of the witty, iconoclastic, but musically na- tionalistic reviews written by the artist. Reprinted from the 1929 edition, the book costs $2. Both are available from the Department of Music, Dover Publi- cations, Inc., 180 Varick Street, New York City 10014. ECHOES.

Can be taught by the average ele- mentary or pre-school teacher or playground in- structor. A music background is not essential. The Carabo-Cone Method is an Ac- tion and Environment learning pro- gram. It is based on the belief that highly structured subject matter can be introduced to the child if it can be translated into an environment which the child can explore, discover and assimilate even as he did his original environment as an infant. The sub- ject matter is music, but the value of the program far transcends the child's acquisition of a musical back- ground. The first American method of its kind.
