<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sartre on the Self and Society: A Whíteheadían View of Sartre's Later Philosophy DELWIN BROWN Arizona State University Unlike traditional religion and other philosophical alternatives in to- day's world, existentialism and Marxism can claim, with considerable reason, to represent an active commitment to the full reality and worth of the concrete world and its possibilities. In this respect, they are our most influential expressions of what may be called the secular spirit. The strength of this secular perspective, though, and perhaps the via- bility of existentialism and Marxism as well, would seem to be seriously threatened by the apparent incompatibility of these, its two most forceful expressions. Existentialism represents that side of secularity which affirms the creative capacities of the individual, the single per- son's freedom and potentialities. Its commitment to the present world is primarily the individual's obligation to his or her possibilities for self-creation. Marxism fastens on the social dimensions of our ex- istence. Its primary commitment is to the development of human and cosmic possibilities through an alteration of the social structures that inhibit their development. Yet another difference appears, reflecting this divergence of their interests. The individualistic emphasis of existentialism has been developed in highly libertarian terms. Marx- ism's collectivistic orientation has usually been formulated in the framework of determinism. These clear differences make the claim that Marxism and existential- ism are somehow compatible seem dubious indeed. Therefore, it sounds ludicrous to hear, in some of Jean-Paul Sartre's later writings, that existentialism and Marxism can, and must, be synthesized. Were it possible, however, such a synthesis would have notable advantages. Insofar as the individualism of the one viewpoint and the 'socialism' of the other represent concerns that are legitimate, their continued separation deprives each of the other's strength. And without their rapprochement, the secular spirit they represent seems destined for yet another version of that dualistic doom which has devitalized so much Western philosophy and theology. The purpose of this essay is to consider the synthesis Sartre pro- poses. First, we shall briefly recall the relevant elements of Sartre's early thinking with regard to the self. Then we shall see how Sartre 65</page><page sequence="2">seeks to integrate his existentialist analysis into Marxist categories. Our judgment will be that this synthesis is possible only if Sartre under- takes a major revision of his view of the material world, and a sugges- tion for doing this, drawn from the work of A. N. Whitehead, is of- fered in conclusion. I. Sartre'sViewoftheSelf Western thought generally has understood the most basic human reality, frequently called the "ego" or the "I," to be something which endures throughout one's individual history. A person has successive experiences, possesses various qualities or characteristics, and performs actions, but the person's fundamental reality somehow stands under and owns these experiences, qualities, and actions. The essential self is the abiding ego which traverses the variations of one's historic ex- istence. Sartre shares with others certain objections to this notion of the self. One objection is the fact that we have no introspective evidence of an enduring, essential ego. Like David Hume, Sartre holds that our primitive self-awareness reveals a succession of experiences, feelings, and actions, but not an underlying "I" which has the experiences and does the actions. (TE 47i?.)1 Nor does philosophical analysis need to presuppose an enduring self in order to account for personal identity. (TE 37-40 and passim) Another objection is the scientific dubiety of an abiding essence, either for individuals or for humanity as such. We need not ignore certain structural commonalities, some of which may persist universally for long periods of time, in order to acknowledge the basic plasticity of human being as revealed in anthropological and psychological studies. (SM 169i.)2 A third objection is more obscure, perhaps, but also more central to Sartre's position. If the most basic self is fixed and abiding, how can we speak of the freedom and self- creativity of that self? Sartre says the intrusion of a fixed essence into selfhood would "congeal" the self, eliminating its spontaneity. (TE 41 f.) Our actions would follow in computer-like fashion from our fixed nature in its intercourse with the world given to it. How can we explain the self-generativity of the self- its spontaneity and creative initiative- if the self is a fixed and finished substance? In truth, the idea of something established and enduring describes a stone better than it describes the fundamental self with which we are familiar. The elements of Sartre's alternative conception of selfhood appeared in The Transcendence of the Ego. The fundamental givens of human reality are the objects for consciousness and consciousness itself. In 66</page><page sequence="3">taking this view, Sartre is not guilty of replacing one substantial thing, the ego, with another, consciousness. Consciousness is not a thing; in- deed, "in a sense, it is a nothing ." (TE 93) It is no-thing in the sense of not having or even being an identifiable essence or fixed nature. Unlike the concrete world given to it, consciousness is dynamic- it is spontaneous, indeterminate, ceaseless creativity. Sartre writes: . . . consciousness is an impersonal spontaneity. It determines its existence at each instant, without our being able to conceive of any- thing before it. Thus each instant of our conscious life reveals to us a creation ex nihilo . Not a new arrangement, but a new existence. (TE 98f.) What we ordinarily call the "ego" or "I" is not directly given in human reality. The ego is only indirectly evident through a reflective act of consciousness because, in fact, the ego is an object for conscious- ness and is constituted by consciousness. (TE 53, 60-93) Inasmuch as consciousness is indeterminate spontaneity, we are prone to wonder why it creates for itself an ego, a mask of "essencehood." Sartre's reply is that "consciousness is frightened by its own spontaneity because it senses this spontaneity as beyond freedom." (TE 100) "There is some- thing distressing for each of us, to catch in the act this tireless creation of which we are not the creators." (TE 99) Spontaneity opens up a "vertigo of possibility" (TE 100) beyond one's confident control. See- ing itself as perpetually unsettled, desirous of escaping from threaten- ing indeterminateness into the security of fixed stability, consciousness creates the "mask" of an ego- "as if to make the ego its guardian and its law"- behind which it may hide itself . . . from itself! ( see TE 100-102) (This thesis, subsequently developed in Being and Nothing- ness as the theory of self-deception, lies beyond our limited purposes here; but one cannot resist observing that much of the profundity and power- the "existential" relevance- of Sartre's philosophy emerges from precisely this point. ) Because it is consciousness which creates the ego or "me" and not vice versa, Sartre must deny that consciousness is personal, that I can say it is my consciousness. He also wants to deny, however, that it is consciousness-in-general. Unable to appeal to the ego as the principle of individuation, Sartre locates the unity of consciousness in the syn- thetic character of consciousness itself. "Consciousness . . . can be limited only by itself. Thus, it constitutes a synthetic and individual totality entirely isolated from other totalities of the same type." (TE 39) But consciousness is not entirely isolated, for Sartre also says that consciousness "unifies itself, concretely, by a play of 'transversal' in- 67</page><page sequence="4">tentionalities which are concrete and real retentions of past conscious- ness (Ibid.; italics added.) This recognition that consciousness is social- now, however, only with respect to other, past consciousnesses -is the point at which Sartre later introduces the Marxist dimension to his thought, as we shall see. The social character of consciousness is also manifest in the presup- position of all phenomenology, which Sartre takes from Husserl and purifies (TE 105), namely that "all consciousness is consciousness of something/' (Quoted on TE 44.) Consciousness without an object is inconceivable; it is always "being-in-the-world." (PI 2o8f.) However, the "nothingness" of consciousness, as described in The Transcendence of the Ego, implies a dialectical quality of the consciousness/object relationship, which becomes more apparent in Psychology of the Imag- ination . Consciousness, in perception as well as in conception and imagination, always in a sense "surpass (es) the real." (PI 208; italics removed.)3 The surpassing, however, only strengthens the social char- acter of consciousness, for in surpassing the real, consciousness makes of it a world. There is, to be sure, a sheer givenness, a "facticity" as Sartre calls it, which is, of course, not dependent upon consciousness. But it is consciousness, as imagination, that constitutes the given to be a world . In Sartre's analysis, then, "world" and "consciousness" are interdependent realities; in this sense they are "social." Being and Nothingness is the culmination of Sartre's early thinking. Any differences it reflects are but nuances which result from the fact that Sartre now contrasts consciousness and the given in the starkest possible terms. It is the total emptiness of the given, now termed "being-in-itself," that becomes more prominent. Conceived of in itself, were that possible, being-in-itself is entirely devoid of meaning and value. Consciousness, termed "being-for-itself," is ceaseless creativity; in each moment it is an unfinishedness seeking achievement. Sartre calls this pursuit a "project," and the project is to be understood pri- marily in terms of giving significance- meaning and value- to the world. But precisely because consciousness is the source of all norms, it, as meaning-giving activity, cannot be justified by any norms or values beyond itself. Thus does Sartre express in philosophical terms Nietzsche's insistence that "only through evaluation is there value: and without evaluation the nut of existence would be hollow."4 And be- cause human reality is the only source of significance, Sartre also echoes Nietzsche's plea: Stay loyal to the earth, my brothers .... Do not let [your virtue] . . . 68</page><page sequence="5">fly away from the things of earth and beat with its wings against the eternal walls Lead, as I do, the flown-away virtue back to earth- yes, back to body and life: that it may give the earth its meaning, a human meaning.5 The enormous sensitivity with which Sartre derives his categories from introspective analysis, and the searing power with which he uses this scheme to illuminate personal and interpersonal human existence, has made Being and Nothingness a monument of profundity. No philosopher that I know of has so adroitly combined complex onto- logica! analysis with moving revelations of the meaning of being human. II. Sartre9 s Move Toward Marxism The power of Sartre's early analysis did not hide its problematic features- even, as it turned out, for Sartre himself. The most important difficulty, for our purposes, is the problem of the relatedness of con- sciousness or the self. We have been at pains to point out the social character of the self for the early Sartre. This characteristic is frequent- ly ignored by readers of Sartre, largely, no doubt, because his own terminology tended to obscure it. Sartre said consciousness is influenced by its own past (e.g., TE 39), but this was consigned to oblivion by his stronger and more persistent claim that each moment of consciousness is a creation ex nihilo. (E.g., TE 98i.) Moreover, the relatedness of the self to its world, although clear, was purely formal. Consciousness must have some world as its intended object, but the nature of that world seemed in no way to influence how it was intended, beyond defining the possible alternatives for the self's constitutive activity. But, in fact, the past actual world appears to do more than that; it seems to us also to have an influence on which of those possibilities are actualized in the present. The political possibilities abstractly present in a repressive society are not equally "real." The repressive given may entail a multi- tude of theoretical possibilities for self-understanding, but that given does more than merely specify these limits; it somehow seems to weight the constitutive activity of consciousness toward some options and away from others. Thus did the freedom of consciousness in the early Sartre seem too pure to many of his readers, too unrelated to the formative power of its social and natural context. More recently, Sartre has recognized that this criticism is correct. His later work, in fact, may be viewed in part as his effort to deal with what we have called the problem of the social relatedness of consciousness. 69</page><page sequence="6">Programatically, this effort, appearing in Search for A Method, occurs as an attempt to relate his early existentialism to Marxism. Indeed, so intent is he to open his previous conclusions to the concrete dimen- sions of our corporate existence, which he sees to be the object of Marxist analysis, that Sartre is now prepared to place existentialism as a fragment within the more comprehensive system of Marxism. Exis- tentialism, he says, is to be discarded when it has led Marxist reflection to return to the humanistic awareness from which it came. (SM 8, 18) Sartre's version of Marxism is summarized in a dictum he recalls from Engels: "it is men themselves who make their history, but within a given environment which conditions them. . . ." (Quoted in SM 31; cf. p. xviii.) "True" Marxism, Sartre insists, always recognizes in human action a margin of concreteness- the "profundity of the lived," he calls it in one place (SM 145)- not reducible to nature and culture. (See, e.g., SM 2Óf., 20.) The orthodox or "lazy" Marxism of contemporary thinkers has either neglected this surplusage altogether or assigned it to chance. (Cf. SM 27i., 29, 37®., 53, 82, 115, 124) Thus, neglecting the uniqueness of human agency, the concrete realities of purposes or aims (i.e., "final causes") have also been overlooked. (SM 146^) If these errors are corrected, materialism will not be reductionistic (SM 129, 151); instead it will be the generalization, formulated by Marx him- self, that "the mode of production of material life generally dominates the development of social, political, and intellectual life." (Quoted in SM 33f.) Even if "material life" does not dictate , in order to allow that it merely "dominates" human belief and action, Sartre must introduce important changes into his earlier existentialism. He does, but the basic understanding of human reality remains much the same. There is no human essence, only structural commanalities making possible an "'ideology' of existence." (SM 169i.) We define ourselves by our projects. (SM 91 f., 150) The project, however, is no longer viewed as a creation ex nihilo ; instead, the structure of the project- or praxis, as Sartre now calls it- is held to be "need." (SM 151) Need is both a lack and an impulse to go beyond that lack. (SM 91 ) It is therefore a given for praxis, and an impetus to praxis. Need does not determine or ex- plain one's self-making. As irrational as this sounds to those who insist upon viewing human action in terms of mechanistic models, need "conditions" praxis. (SM 151 ) It urges or lures. Thus need renders the range of possibility confronting a person to be, not "a zone of indé- termination, but rather a strongly structured region which depends upon all of History and which includes its own contradictions." (SM 93) Translated into socio-economic categories, need becomes "scar- 70</page><page sequence="7">city," and the point of contact with Marxism is clear. It is, nevertheless, a humanistic Marxism, refusing to be reductionistic. For example: Exploiter and exploited are men in conflict in a system whose princi- pal characteristic is scarcity . To be sure, the capitalist owns the in- struments of labor, and the worker does not own them: there we have a pure contradiction. But to be precise, this contradiction never succeeds in accounting for each event. It is the framework for the event (SM 127) Sartre's combination of existentialism and Marxism enables each to enrich the other. From Marxism comes a contexual consciousness, an awareness that the self's freedom cannot be divorced from its frame- work of material or concrete possibilities. The range of possibilities, derived from one's past, emerges as an ordered structure of opportuni- ties for future becoming. The future is not an addition to the present; it is already ingredient in the present as its goal. (SM 159) We define ourselves by our projects; nevertheless, our projects can only be chiseled out of the rock of real, and not merely abstract, possibilities for future actualization. Therefore, Sartre can also say that the "future defines the individual." (SM 94) A Marxist existentialism sees how the past enriches or impoverishes our futures, and, consequently, how the future extends or restricts the quality of our freedom in the present. From existentialism Sartre's synthesis gains an awareness of the ir- reducible efficacy of human purpose. The "bad faith" of orthodox Marxists has been the vacillation of their historical explanations be- tween efficient causes and final causes in order to suit their a priori myths. (SM 48) To explain events fully in terms of efficient causality is neither Marxist nor scientific. It was legitimate for the natural sciences to free themselves from the anthropomorphism which consists in bestowing human properties on inanimate objects. But it is perfectly absurd to assume by analogy the same scorn for anthropomorphism where anthropology is con- cerned. When one is studying man, what can be more exact or more rigorous than to recognize human properties in him ? The simple in- spection of the social field ought to have led to the discovery that the relation to ends is à permanent structure of human enterprises and that it is on the basis of this relation that real men evaluate actions, institutions, or economic constructions. It ought to have been es- tablished that our comprehension of the other is necessarily attained through ends. (SM 157) 71</page><page sequence="8">III. A Problem and a Whiteheadian Suggestion Sartre is now committed to the construction of a philosophy of the creative project that recognizes both external conditioning and indi- vidual freedom. The key to his effort is the notion of need, as we have seen. Freedom is experienced cast in the inclining aura of need. In this way, Sartre ties freedom to its environment, for, as Hazel Barnes has said, need "brings in something from the outside . . . which man cannot ultimately escape, no matter how much he may vary his reaction to it." (SMxv) If Sartre's concept of need solves the problem of the social related- ness noted earlier, it would seem, however, to be an incomplete solu- tion. How is it, we must ask, that the social and material context creates needs? How is it that needs are not only "lacks" (the absence of realiza- tion) but also aspirations (the impetus toward actualization)? Why are needs cast in an aura of inclination? This kind of question is important for any program which seeks to ground freedom securely in a material context. The point is to avoid viewing freedom as something essentially unaffected by external cir- cumstance-diversity or conformity, poverty or plenty, liberty or slavery -for, on such a view, freedom could claim no rights. One would have one's freedom regardless of external conditions. The connection be- tween freedom and, say, economic security would merely be a "habit of the mind." Sartre's move to Marxism is a rejection of so ephemeral a freedom; social and economic conditions create needs, not merely be- cause we happen to think they do, but because such conditions exercise real agency even over freedom. Our question is, how? Sartre cannot answer this question, it would seem; he works with a view of nature that admits of no solution. He continues to understand the physical world as being composed of detached, self-contained, and passive bits of matter. Nature is part of what Sartre calls "being-in- itself," the brute givenness of things devoid of meaning and value. How can a valueless given be of value to freedom, positively or negatively, unless freedom simply constitutes it as such? How can a given that is passive create needs? For Sartre, the world given to consciousness stands powerless before consciousness, making no demands and claiming no obligations. But why does freedom not constitute material oppression to be enriching and impoverishment to be fulfilling? With Sartre's view of nature, need, in the final analysis, can only be fully a creation of subjectivity. And the decision of oppressed subjectivity can be no more instructive, no more legitimate, than that of its oppressor. Needs can only be 72</page><page sequence="9">grounded in the constitutive power of consciousness, not in the material conditions of nature and society. Interestingly, Marx's own view of nature was more adequate than is that of most of his followers, including Sartre. In the Theses on Feuer- bachy Marx complains that "all previous materialism . . . [conceives of] things, reality, the sensible world . . . only in the form of objects , or of observation, but not as sensuous human activity , praxis . . . ." (First Thesis) Marx himself is here reflecting a more classical view of matter. The Aristotelian tradition had viewed matter as potentiality, thus en- suring a place for activity in its conception of nature; a natural thing, in part material, is by its very nature in process, possessing within itself a principle of agency. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, how- ever, there emerged a new view which identified the physical world with matter, and, more significantly, deemed matter to be wholly actual and thus in itself changeless.6 For the new view, matter is mov- able, but it contains within itself no principle of motion. Conscious- ness, as self-creative and dynamic subjectivity, must be wholly removed from the inert physical world. Thus, there arose the Cartesian dualism of mind and matter with its concomitant problems. These problems recur in Sartre's Cartesianism. How can a passive physical environ- ment impose needs upon subjectivity? It cannot. Judgments of value, including those pertaining to need, are impositions of an active sub- jectivity upon a passive material world. Roger Garaudy has observed that Marxist thought since Lenin has generally failed to incorporate into itself the advances of the sciences.7 This is unfortunate; the more recent conceptions of nature, if heeded, would have prevented Marxism from degenerating into the reduction- ists determinism that has characterized so much of its history. But of more significance for our immediate consideration, these conceptions of the material world provide a basis for Sartre's doctrine of need. That this is true is nowhere better illustrated than in the work of Alfred North Whitehead. The seventeenth-century view, Whitehead observes, held that nature is "composed of permanent things, namely bits of matter, moving about in space which is otherwise empty."8 The crucial assumption here is the . . . independent individuality of each bit of matter. Each stone is conceived as fully describable apart from any reference to any other portion of matter. It might be alone in the Universe, . . . [b] ut it would still be the stone which it is, . . . adequately described without any reference to past or future.9 73</page><page sequence="10">Whitehead, like others, has argued extensively for the scientific in- adequacy, not to say incoherence, of this point of view.10 He also sees it to be a powerful opponent of the "presuppositions of humanism."11 Valuation, purposing, and subjectivity- all essential to our sense of self- hood-are rendered alien, needless intrusions of dubious reality. If retained at all, they are housed in a dualism which makes judgments of meaning and value either irrelevant to the material environment or ar- bitrary impositions upon it. The impasse arising in Sartre's attempted move to Marxism is an illustration of Whitehead's point. Dead, rela- tionless matter knows no needs, conveys no aspirations. The more recent conception of nature, Whitehead says, ... is expressed in terms of energy, activity, and the whole vibratory differentiations of space-time. Any local agitation shakes the whole universe. The distant effects are minute, but they are there. The . . . group of agitations which we term matter is fused into its environ- ment. There is no possibility of a detached, self-contained local existence. The environment enters into the nature of each thing. Some elements in the nature of a complete set of agitations may remain stable as those agitations are propelled through a changing environment. But such a stability is only the case in a general, aver- age way. This average fact is the reason why we find the same chair, the same rock and the same planet, enduring for days, or for cen- turies, or for millions of years. In this average fact the time-factor takes the aspect of endurance, and change is a detail. The funda- mental fact, according to the physics of the present day, is that the environment with its peculiarities seeps into the group-agitation which we term matter, and the group-agitations extend their char- acter to the environment.12 On this view, nature is vibrantly alive. Natural objects are composed of minute, momentary quanta of energetic activity. Each energetic oc- casion is dynamic, a creative synthesis that is something more than the sum of the elements synthesized. In addition, each such unit is rela- tional; it is finally incomprehensible apart from the past occasions which contribute its contents and influence its aim, and from the future onto which it projects itself. Therefore, each quantum makes a difference, however infinitesimal, to the character of the cosmic process. It accepts and adapts the past, and imposes its adaptation of inherited data upon subsequent occasions, which in turn receive, synthesize, and project. In this sense, one may say that each unit of energetic activity is an evaluation. Nietzsche's claim, so central to Sartre's thinking, is apropos: only through evaluation is there value. But this does not mean 74</page><page sequence="11">that values are simply human impositions. Nature, too, is evaluative, at its most fundamental level. What is valued, of course, is tied to each particular synthesis accomplished under the duress of its social context. But that occasions are selective and projective functionings, i.e., evalua- tions, is a pervasive characteristic of things. Valuations are givens. Needs, being the appetitive entertainment of unrealized possibility, are a form of valuation. Thus, needs, too, are given in the nature of things. Like other data inherited from the past, they are, as Sartre says, a part of "the framework for the event" in the present; that is, they in- fluence, but do not determine, the presently becoming synthesis. Past valuations of needfulness are, as it were, allegations of oughtness weigh- ing heavily upon the present, which now must be ratified or revised. The crucial point, however, is that, with this view of nature, needs are not arbitrary creations of consciousness in an otherwise need-less world. The natural and social context of each human moment is alive with needful propensities. The view of nature Whitehead describes and defends, makes pos- sible, it seems to me, Sartre's effort to incorporate a Marxist dimension into his thought. It enables us to see how, although free, we are in- extricably dependent upon, embedded in, our material environments. It does so, significantly, without compromising Sartre's long insistence upon the freedom and creativity of the self.13 We transform the world in our imaginative freedom, but our freedom is never "otherworldly." It belongs to the natural world. Human freedom is enriched or im- poverished by its material past and is destined to contribute to its future. NOTES i.

It has often been observed that Whitehead's doctrine of freedom is in some ways more radical than that of the existentialists. Freedom, for Whitehead, is always influenced by its context; in this respect his view is less extreme than that of the early Sartre. On the other hand, Whitehead posits some measure of self-creative freedom, however miniscule, in the ultimate constituents (i.e., the "actual entities") of every level of reality, including nature. In a recent essay, I defended an "existentialist" view of God within a Whiteheadian framework.
