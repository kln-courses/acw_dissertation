Fichte's Kantian Fantasies of Jewish Decapitation in 1793 Sven-Erik Rose ABSTRACT This article analyzes how Lazarus Bendavid andJohann Gottlieb Fichte, in their 1793 texts, presented similarfantasies of integratingJews into the state by decapitat- ingJewish heads. Such fantasies reached back to the Kantian foundation of each phi- losopher's conception of humanity and morality. Approaching the question of extending civil rights toJews from the standpoint of the normative Kantian moral subject, both Bendavid and Fichte came to the conclusion that the only way to accom- modateJews into the civil sphere was through the paradoxical and gruesome means of (symbolic) decapitation. Because it dramatically exemplifies possible dangers in Kant- ian moral universalism, Bendavid's peripheral and aberrant contribution to the cele- brated corpus ofJewish Kantian philosophy can productively complicate how that tradition understood itself and how we continue to see it. Key words: Lazarus Bendavid, Johann GottliebFichte, Immanuel Kant he year is 1793. While the Terror rages in Paris, two German proponents of the new Kantian philosophy, Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Lazarus Bendavid, theorize the desirability, legiti- macy, and possible means of incorporatingJews into the state as citi- zens. This question implies different stakes for the two thinkers, yet each envisions a scenario in which the very gesture that would inte- grateJews into the polity also seems to threaten their existence. Fichte Sven-Erik Rose, "Lazarus Bendavid's andJ. G. Fichte's Kantian Fantasies of Jewish Decapitation in 1793,"Jewish Social Studies: History, Culture, Society n.s. 13, no. 3 (Spring/Summer 2007): 73-102</page><page sequence="2">[74] Jewish Social Studies writes, "But to give them [the Jews] civil rights-I at least see no means of doing so other than, in one night, to cut off all their heads and replace them with others containing not a single Jewish idea."' Weighing the possibilities for integrating Jews into the state, Benda- vid deploys a similar image: "It [Judaism] is the hydra, all of whose heads must be cut off at once if two are not to grow back in place of every one severed."2 In this article, I analyze how the uncanny similarities in Bendavid's and Fichte's rhetoric reach back to the Kantian foundation of their conception of humanity and morality. Approaching the question of extending Jewish civil rights from the standpoint of the normative Kantian moral subject, both Bendavid and Fichte come to the conclu- sion that the only way to accommodateJews into the civil sphere is, in fact, through the paradoxical and gruesome means of (symbolic) de- capitation. Both Kantians come to view decapitation as the only pos- sible cure, as it were, forJewish wrong-headedness.3 In Etwas zur Charackteristick derJuden (On Jewish Characteristics), Bendavid draws on Kantian philosophy-which he was explicating in public lectures in Vienna at the time he wrote his treatise-to diag- nose modern Jews as morally deficient subjects, the products of a pathologizing history of post-Temple Judaism. I propose to read Ben- david's deployment of Kant in his diagnosis of the moral-psychic defi- ciencies of the modernJew, and his vision of a "cure" for the affliction of Jewishness thus understood, alongside the remarks Fichte makes on a Jewish "state within a state" in his Beitrag zur Berichtigung der Ur- teile des Publikums iiber diefranzisische Revolution (Contribution Toward the Correction of the Public's Assessment of the French Revolution), comments that marked an important shift in anti-Jewish discourse from a theological to a purely philosophical denigration of Jewish- ness. By doing so, I try to lay bare the double-bind in which theJewish Kantian Bendavid found himself in trying to advocate for civil eman- cipation for Jews from the normative foundation of Kantian univer- salism. My analysis concludes with a brief discussion of how Bendavid attempts to negotiate the ambiguities of his own intellectual and civic position through the enunciatory performance of his own discourse. The suprahistorical Kantian moral subject provides both the im- plicit standard-in terms of which Bendavid plots the "deviant" path of Jewish (psychic) history in the diaspora-and the model for the cura- tive dissolution of this history (or "case history") of the Jews. As we know, however, the Enlightenment was not to be the golden age at the end of history but rather the conceptual laboratory in which many of the concepts later appropriated by nineteenth-century historical</page><page sequence="3">thought were fabricated. Even as Bendavid wrote, the sort of emergent nationalism we find in Fichte's text was eroding Enlightenment univer- salism. In the aggressiveness of his assimilationist demands, and espe- cially in his characterological understanding of the Jews, Bendavid came very close indeed to Fichte's equally aggressive and character- ological understanding of the essential nonhumanity ofJews.4 The Politicization of Jewish History from Dohm to Bendavid In order to understand how Bendavid arrived at his volatile, aporetic, and highly politicized diagnosis of Jewish history and subjectivity, it will be helpful to recall the trajectory of the emancipation debate in Germany during the 1780s and early 1790s. In his 1781 On the Civil Improvement of theJews, the Prussian civil ser- vant Christian Wilhelm von Dohm elaborated an early version of, to use Salo Baron's famous term, the "lachrymose" theory ofJewish his- tory.5 He attributed the sociocultural situation of European Jews to a history of passive suffering, to centuries of exile, persecution, and ne- glect. Dohm argued that improving the Jews' civil status would also "improve" the Jews, rendering them fit citizens and a valuable re- source for the state.6 Soon after the publication of Dohm's seminal treatise in September 1781 (the timing was coincidental, not causal) came the first emancipation legislation in Austria.7 In the dynamic discursive and political context of the 1780s and early 1790s, the task of theorizing the relationship between history, Jewish tradition, and the Jews' place in the polity became central for a number of Jewish Enlightenment intellectuals, or maskilim. The possibility of enfranchisement not only reconfigured the relationship between Jews and the broader society but also redefined and intensi- fied differences among Jews. As the debate emerged over what kind of involvement in the state could be extended to Jews, and to what sort ofJews, differences in degree, in a manner of speaking, came to be conceived of and articulated as differences in kind. David Sorkin characterizes the shift that took place within central Europe in the 1780s and 1790s from the early Haskalah project of cultural renewal within Judaism to one focusing on the social reform ofJews: The deaths of Mendelssohn and Frederick the great in 1786 had a signif- icant impact on the Haskalah.... The removal of the internal brake and the external obstacle to change unleashed new hopes and undertakings among the mercantile elite and the maskilim. [75] Bendavid's &amp; Fichte's Kantian Fantasies Sven-Erik Rose Sven-Erik Rose</page><page sequence="4">[76] Jewish Social Studies The politicization of the Haskalah in these years did not mean that the maskilim developed a comprehensive agenda of social and political reform, but rather that they deployed the ideas of the early Haskalah in a radical manner. The result was a subtle, albeit significant shift: the early Haskalah's prescriptions for the intellectual renewal of Judaism were now enlisted as remedies for the affliction of the Jews.8 Dohm's "lachrymose" history of the Jews, which so powerfully in- fluenced the emancipation debate throughout the 1780s and 1790s, not only helped prepare the ground for this eventual shift in the Has- kalah from cultural revival toward social issues, or from Judaism to the Jews, but also ensured that narratives of Jewish history would serve as an important medium through which Jews and non-Jews alike would articulate competing positions on Jewish emancipation.9 Politicization and historicization went hand in hand: history, which had not been a preoccupation for Jews as long as Jewish society re- mained basically distinct from the cultural and civic identities of those among whom Jews lived, quickly emerged as an urgent issue as these distinctions were blurred and contested. Such is the heady context in which Bendavid elaborated his On Jewish Characteristics, one of the most controversial and confounding texts of the Jewish Enlightenment.'o Dominique Bourel has pointed to the "quasi-messianic ecstasy" with which German-Jewish intellec- tuals of the 1780s and early 1790s believed in an imminent improve- ment in the civil status ofJews." Bendavid's text appeared not only a decade after Joseph II's Edicts of Toleration but also not long after the French National Assembly granted civil equality to the Jews in 1791, and just after the first naturalization of Jews in Prussia and the first admission ofJews to the civil service.'2 Bendavid wrote his treatise in German, a language not accessible to the majority of even German Jews. Bendavid first submitted it- whether in earnest or as a provocation is not clear; at any rate, it was rejected-to the Haskalah journal Ha-measef (The Gatherer),'3 and it eventually appeared with an independent publisher in Leipzig. Ben- david does not analyze religion and Judaism, as had, however differ- ently, both Moses Mendelssohn (in Jerusalem, or On Religious Power and Judaism, 1783) and Saul Ascher (in Leviathan, or on Religion in Regard to Judaism, 1792), but rather the Jews.'4 His point of departure is not theological but characterological and psychological, and the founda- tion of his call for reform is unabashedly pragmatic. Bendavid's de- ployment of a certain history of the Jews represents a new departure within Jewish Enlightenment discourse: his aim is not to show that</page><page sequence="5">Jewish law and modern enlightened sensibilities are compatible (Mendelssohn), nor to argue for reforming the latter so as to harmo- nize with the former (Ascher). Making an aggressive distinction be- tween himself as an enlightened Mensch ("ich"), and backward and timorousJews ("euch"), Bendavid argues for a quid pro quo of rehabili- tation for rights, the demolition of halakhah as a prerequisite for the curative transformation of Jews into citizens. The only impediment to political emancipation, Bendavid admonishes his backward coreli- gionists, is the "slave mentality of bygone centuries" (Sklavensinn vorigerJahrhunderte) (65). A blissful life as Burger (citizens) and Men- schen (human beings) awaits theJews if only they muster the pluck to shake off their Jewishness (sich vomJudenthum losmachen). Such a re- form would demonstrate the Jews' willingness and capacity to meet the government halfway in becoming subjects of the modern state. Bendavid apostrophizes his coreligionists in a provocative tone that blends a certain advocacy for the Jewish cause with flagrant con- tempt of Jewish practices. In a three-part treatise, Bendavid vigor- ously "proselytizes" for a rationalistic form ofJudaism scarcely distin- guishable from deism. He first elaborates a diachronic evaluation of Jewish history. Then he offers a synchronic typology of contemporary Jewish society, comprising four groups: traditionalists (who keep the mitzvot); hedonists (who do not, but only out of depravity); good- heartedJews (who only out of weakness cling to unreformedJudaism [ungeliuterten Judenthum]); and Enlightened Jews (like himself, who have essentially superceded Judaism to become natural religionists). In the final part of his treatise, Bendavid presents a virulent mani- festo addressed to the good-hearted Jews of his third category (the first two he considers simply incorrigible), whom he urges to cast off Jewish belief and practice. Bendavid argues that, after the destruction of the Second Temple and after failed attempts to regain their lost sovereignty, the Jews turned, as a last resort, to a moral attack, hoping to regain their lost homeland not by might but rather through moral improvement. Since the destruction of the Second Temple, to further summarize Bendavid's construction of post-TempleJewish history,Jewish biblical exegesis has been overdetermined, if not simply determined, by the needs of a slave mentality.'5 Bendavid traces a fateful displacement from action to (impotent) piety and from praxis to (superstitious) be- lief. He erodes the theological underpinnings of Jewish history and reducesJewish piety to an impotent people's neurotic and delusional form of warfare. In a word, Bendavid not only psychologizes but also pathologizes post-Temple existence and the entire rabbinic tradition. [77] Bendavid's &amp; Fichte's Kantian Fantasies Sven-Erik Rose</page><page sequence="6">[78] Jewish Social Studies In Bendavid's hands, Dohm's Leidensgeschichte (lachrymose history) is subtly but importantly transformed into a Krankengeschichte (pathog- raphy): a diagnostic case history of what Bendavid casts as an essen- tially pathological modernJewish character. My analysis in this article focuses on how Bendavid's historiciza- tion of theJews is subtended by a normalizing universalist anthropol- ogy, specifically the Kantian moral subject. Bendavid relies implicitly on the logic of Kantian morality in order both to construct and to end or dissolve his history of Jewish particularity as private pathol- ogy. Bendavid's interest in Kantian philosophy was far-reaching and provides the implicit, though never explicit, conceptual framework for On Jewish Characteristics. What a Christian theological bias had earlier cast as divine punishment of the Jews, Bendavid recasts in terms of their own subjective moral weakness, a failure of will that it is now finally incumbent on them to redress through a leap out of the symptomatology of Jewish history into the suprahistorical realm of autonomous (Kantian) moral subjectivity. As I will try to show, this philosophical framework significantly contributes to the contradic- tions of Bendavid's infamous discourse, and it animates the violent fantasy with which he tries to resolve these contradictions, a politico- philosophical fantasy with deep affinities to Fichte's. Bendavid's intervention occupies a singular position in the long and variedJewish reception of Kant.'6 As Christoph Schulte observes, the question of why there was such a substantial engagement-at times bordering on identification-with Kant amongJewish intellec- tuals in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries has been "frequently and always differently answered."'7 I agree with Schulte that, given the range not only of prominent Jewish Kantian and neo-Kantian philosophers but also and especially of both Liberal and Orthodox Jewish intellectuals who appropriated Kant in philosophies of Juda- ism over the span of 150 years, the question admits of no single, gen- eral answer.'8 Friedrich Niew6hner provides the fullest overview of both negative and positive factors contributing to the attraction of Kant for Jewish thinkers.'9 Aside from unmistakably Christian con- ceptual paradigms (Hegel) and antisemitic rhetoric (Fichte, Marx) that made several alternatives even more problematic than Kant for a philosophy of Judaism, Kant was also the key figure of the German Enlightenment, with which German Jews strongly identified. Kant was a towering figure in the tradition-and bourgeois institution-of German Bildung, and one whose rationalism and commitment to po- litical Enlightenment resisted appropriation by romantic and nation- alistic movements. In the course of the nineteenth century, and</page><page sequence="7">certainly by the fin de siecle, the affinities Jewish thinkers perceived between their various versions ofJudaism and their various versions of Kant were inevitably encouraged by the cultural capital and politi- cal culture they associated with "Kant." Kant's Jewish contemporaries, in contrast, tended to avoid explicit reference to the philosopher when they wrote on topics ofJewish con- cern. In a programmatic 1783 essay in Ha-measef, "The Uses of Engage- ment with Past Ages," Isaac Euchel as it were "smuggles" Kant (of the first critique) into an essay on the importance of secular historical study even for the understanding of the sacred tradition. Euchel avoided Kant's name so as not to offend the traditionalists he was still courting as readers of that recently launched journal.2" As we will see, Bendavid likewise "smuggles" Kant-poorly disguised as Mendelssohn-into his more radical discourse, which, however, still formally addresses fellow Jews. Kant was a far more controversial figure in his day to bothJewish and non-Jewish audiences than the one that nineteenth-century Ger- man cultural history would enshrine. It is worth noting that Bendavid, who effectively brought Kant to Vienna, where he lectured and pub- lished on the three critiques in the 1790s, was escorted out of the city in 1797 by the police, who found the Protestant Prussian philosopher- and likely hisJewish "prophet"-too revolutionary.2' Significantly, the Kant that Bendavid brings unnamed into OnJewish Characteristics is that of the second critique, not, as with Euchel, the first. Bendavid distinguishes himself in this treatise from the long tradition of Jewish Kantians by working closely (if only implicitly) from Kant's moral philosophy. This claim will seem perverse to anyone who takes the Jewish Kantian tradition on its own terms, for that tradition cele- brates purported elective affinities between Judaism and Kant above all in the area of ethics. As Niew6hner provocatively argues, however, the chorus of claims about harmonies between Kantian andJewish eth- ics notwithstanding, Orthodox and Liberal Jewish Kantian philoso- phers alike avoid Kant's moral philosophy almost completely, and when they do, however briefly, take up Kant's central writings on ethics, they fundamentally criticize rather than concur with them.2" Niew6hner makes the case that it is much more Kant's epistemology than his ethics that animatesJewish Kantian writing. He argues it was above all Kant's method of positing the thing-in-itself that seemed to parallel Jewish critiques of anthropomorphism (especially Mai- monides) and provided a rational basis for different conceptions of God and/or the Law as "noumenal." In short, theJewish appropriation of Kant occurred "in the sphere of the epistemological foundation [Be- griindung] for ethics, not in the area of ethics itself."23 Bendavid's inter- [79] Bendavid's &amp; Fichte's Kantian Fantasies Sven-Erik Rose Sven-Erik Rose</page><page sequence="8">[80] Jewish Social Studies vention is singular in the way it (implicitly) works from Kantian moral philosophy and gets caught in the aporias and violence to which even, and perhaps especially, a faithful reading of Kant can lead. In Eisen- menger the Second (1794), Saul Ascher took Fichte (of Contribution) and Kant himself (of Religion Within the Boundaries of Mere Reason, 1793) to task for their vehemently anti-Jewish appropriation of Kant's ethics. Ascher argued that Fichte's was a possible but not a necessary use of Kant.24 This is surely true, and I should be explicit that my point, at any rate, is not to argue that Bendavid's tract shows Kant's moral philoso- phy to be either good or bad for the Jews. Yet Bendavid's peripheral and indeed aberrant contribution to the celebrated corpus of Jewish Kantian philosophy can nonetheless complicate in productive ways not only how that tradition understood itself but also how we continue to see it. Whereas Ascher and (differently) Solomon Maimon used conceptual tools from various areas of Kantian philosophy to argue with Kant him- self, Bendavid remained far more the dutiful Kantian.25 If the use he makes of Kantian ethics is by no means inevitable, it nonetheless remains close to and issues from dynamics of Kant's own theory of practical rea- son. Bendavid's deployment of Kant is indeed gruesome; however, it is arguably less contrived than the many problematic appropriations of Kant's moral philosophy that circumvent its basic structure in order to proclaim it harmonic with a purported essence ofJudaism. "[A]pparently straightforward but deeply perplexing" is how Gillian Rose aptly charac- terizes the culmination of this tradition, Hermann Cohen's 1910 "Inner Relations between Kant's Philosophy andJudaism."26 Kantian Moral Subjectivity and Ethical Alterity The political binary ofJew vs. Bfirger is subtended in both Bendavid and Fichte by the more fundamental binary of Jew vs. Mensch. The significant differences in their deployments of Kant notwithstanding, a Kantian perspective leads both thinkers out of the traditional op- position between Christian and Jew and into a pernicious and dis- tinctly modern opposition between Jew and Mensch, where civil competence is predicated on "human" moral competence. Although both stress the fundamental misanthropy (Menschenfeindlichkeit) of the Jews, we must-in order to understand clearly the problem that the Jews pose to Bendavid's and Fichte's Kantian reasoning-turn the tables and ask to what extent the age-old charge ofJewish misan- thropy here reflects an inherent antagonism of Kantian "humanity" to Judaism. As a functioning ethical community that resists assimila-</page><page sequence="9">tion to the universal ethics of Kantian humanity, the Jews mark the possibility of a limit to this would-be universalist moral project. It is precisely because the Jew resides at the periphery of Bendavid's and Fichte's Kantian understanding of "the human" that they subject the figure of the Jew to the normative force of their rhetorical violence. In Fichte's and Bendavid's fantasies of humanization through decapi- tation of the universal Mensch's uncanny other, the Jew, the norma- tive (but usually self-masking) violence that constitutes the Kantian moral subject as universal becomes flagrant. That the two Kantians both resort to decapitation as the only pos- sible means of incorporatingJews into the sphere of enlightened poli- tics is striking. To understand this radical and paradoxical cure, which succeeds (if it succeeds) by killing the patient, we must bear in mind the historical context of the Terror, in the shadow of which Bendavid and Fichte wrote.27 We must also examine the way each draws on Kant's moral philosophy in his conception of humanity, the state, and the relationship between the two. An excursion into two re- lated aspects of Kantian moral philosophy will illuminate these is- sues. The first aspect is the relationship, or rather non-relationship, of the sphere of Kantian morality to any possible alterity or exterior- ity-the inability of Kant's system to countenance, or even acknowl- edge, any form of ethical difference. The second aspect is the role violence plays in structuring the Kantian moral will. Exploring these questions will help us understand why the only form of mediation that our two Kantians can imagine between the ethical "universality" of the Kantian Mensch and the moral particularity of the Jews is the non-mediation of radical, instantaneous erasure. In a famous and singularly poetic passage intended to bridge the first and second parts of the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant offers a geo- graphical image to help his readers envision the nature of the episte- mological terrain he is mapping. He likens the phenomenal realm, the sphere of possible human knowledge, to an island that is sur- rounded by the waters of the noumenal world, alluring but deceptive and treacherous because ultimately unchartable.28 Elaborating on Kant's metaphor, we could envision the transcendental schemata, which produce the phenomenal realm of human knowledge by medi- ating between the sensible intuition and concepts a priori, as the is- land's shoreline: a boundary that touches the water yet still belongs to, and lends contours to, the land. A space is indeed only mappable by virtue of its limits, and the schemata set the limits to human knowl- edge that permit its contours to be delineated. Kant offers no comparable image to aid in understanding the [81] Bendavid's &amp; Fichte's Kantian Fantasies Sven-Erik Rose Sven-Erik Rose</page><page sequence="10">[82] Jewish Social Studies structure of practical reason. But if theoretical reason strains out- ward to its own limit-to the shoreline it cannot cross without losing itself in perilous waters-I would suggest that practical reason "moves" in the opposite direction, from its outer limit infinitely in- ward. Practical reason's limit cannot be said to constrain it because practical reason in fact constitutes itself in the very act of setting its own limit. Hegel was in this sense right in calling the categorical im- perative a tautology. Through the infinite "centripetal" force of its founding tautological gesture, Kantian morality constitutes itself as an absolute interiority, by which I mean a space that permits of no ex- teriority. (I use "interiority" in a purely spatial sense, not as a realm of human affect or sentiment.) Constituted as it is in its very universal- ity, Kantian morality must be inimical to any alterity. Of course, this is not to say that there is nothing other than morality (the sensible world is rigorously other than the moral). Rather, there is no possible moral other that Kantian morality could recognize as such. Anything not completely within the realm of moral reason is by definition com- pletely incommensurable with it. No mediation between the moral and the non-moral is possible ac- cording to the Kantian system, but neither is any mediation neces- sary. Kantian theoretical reason is a kind of epistemological compromise between the sensible and the intelligible, and it can only exist in the form of mediation between the two. In Kant's famous for- mulation, "Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind."29 Kantian practical reason, in contrast, is sui ge- neris; were it capable of any dialogue with anything else, were it sus- ceptible to any sort of mediation whatever, the hermetic circle formed by its self-constituting tautology would be broken, and its "infinite" inward force would immediately dissipate.30 Even though, given Kant's strict dualism, no true mediation is pos- sible between the intelligible realm of morality and that of the senses, some means is nonetheless required of adjusting the latter to the dic- tates of the former. In Critique of Practical Reason and Groundwork to the Metaphysics of Morals, Kant theorizes this (non-mediatory) possibility of adjustment through the related concepts of Willkiir (free choice) and Nitigung (rational compulsion). He distinguishes between the terms Willkiir and Wille (will), the latter being essentially synonymous with practical reason itself. Willkir designates the human capacity to make choices based on pure moral reason31 yet also encompasses the possibility of choosing not to do so, in which case, Kant says, Willkiir has been "pathologically affected" by empirical (or sensuous) causal- ity.32 Sensuous inclinations such as greed, lust, pettiness, and so on</page><page sequence="11">may cause one's Willkiir to deviate from the rules of one's own "deep" (or, in a Kantian idiom, "intelligible" or "noumenal") moral gram- mar. Such "pathologizing" influences require a corrective force, and Kant calls this force N6tigung, a conscious (and therefore potentially corrective) representation of "deep" laws of practical reason. Such a representation is formalized in an imperative. A protean concept, then, Willkfir is both the aspect of the will that is susceptible to the pathological influence of the sensuous realm and the force by which it can overcome this pathological influence and re- turn to moral "health." In casting difference in terms of pathological deviation from the noumenal norm, Kant simply leaves no room for forms of moral freedom whose autonomy could be said to inhere in their very incompatibility with Kant's own conception of moral rea- son (because for Kant this conception is precisely not particular but universal). TraditionalJewish ethics based on the (as Kant would say) "heteronomous" authority of the mitzvot, for example, can by defini- tion claim no moral validity, indeed no "autonomy."33 In this way, tra- ditionalJewish practice is rendered (in a rigorous sense) unreasonable, fundamentally incompatible with practical reason. Willkir, then, ef- fectively provides a buffer around the pure moral Wille, allowing the tautologous structure of moral reason to remain hermetically intact and utterly immune to any form of alterity. Willkur does not mediate between the pure moral will and the sensuous world but rather inter- poses itself between the two. Any negotiations or "dirty work" with sensuous inclinations are carried out by one's Willkiir, permitting the pure Wille to remain pristine. We are now in a better position to see what could be called the blackmail of Kantian ethics. One either wills to submit to the maxims one's "own" moral autonomy generates, or one fails to will to do so, and so fails to correspond to one's own moral self. The only valid eth- ical sense must be routed through the universal autonomous subject, which is defined in its essence by the use of universally generalizable practical reason.34 Particularity as such, or any heterogeneity between the universal laws of practical reason and an individual's ethical sen- sibilities, thus becomes reducible to a failure of resolve and must be self-corrected by Notigung, the (auto-)enforcer of one's "own" moral conscience. From the Kantian perspective, the non-universalizable, the particular, is by definition not in harmony with "itself." The bifur- cated structure of Kant's moral will (Wille-Willkur) allows, I would argue, moral freedom to coexist with violent coercion because the freedom and the violence are relegated to completely separate spheres. The Kantian moral subject can be said to achieve autono- [83] Bendavid's &amp; Fichte's Kantian Fantasies Sven-Erik Rose Sven-Erik Rose</page><page sequence="12">[84] Jewish Social Studies mous freedom by submitting to (its "own") norms-that is, through a form of self-inflicted violence that, because it can only take place in the space of Willkiir and not the hermetically contained space of Wille, never taints or stains the morality it in fact founds. Friedrich Nietzsche perceived the foundational violence of the Kantian moral subject keenly. In the course of elaborating his hypothesis that moral concepts like guilt, duty, and conscience originate in the act of exact- ing a price of violence, of Leiden-machen, Nietzsche suggests that the world of such concepts has "never completely lost a certain odor of blood and torture," and he adds "not even in old Kant: the categori- cal imperative reeks of cruelty."35 The Moral Law, Jewish Alterity, and the State The constitutive violence of Kant's categorical imperative structures the way both Bendavid and Fichte theorize the possibility of incorpo- ratingJews into the state and thus brings the two Kantians' positions perilously close to each other. The underlying similarity in the ways that Bendavid and Fichte approach the question of extending civil rights to Jews appears most clearly in the ways they each conceive of the relation between moral Mensch and political Burger. Each thinker treats Mensch and Buirger as fundamentally synonymous, even though they entertain different visions of what this basic unity of human being and citizen implies for the state's right to intervene in the lives of individuals. Fichte's philosophically radical project has the effect of stripping the state as such of virtually all authority. His argument is that the Mensch is sovereign and not fundamentally dependent on the state. For Fichte, the state indeed amounts to merely one particular contractual agree- ment (the civil contract, or Biirgervertrag) into which autonomous Men- schen may or may not choose to enter. In subordinating all political authority to natural or human rights constituted and sanctioned by the moral law (Sittengesetz) inherent in human beings as such, Fichte radi- cally attenuates the authority of the state. Because Fichte's citizens re- ceive no essential rights from the state, non-citizens (Menschen who have no contract with the state) should theoretically enjoy the same human rights. The moral and political, Mensch and Burger, are essen- tially similar in Fichte, then, because the Birgervertrag is, in moral terms, actually a "zero" added to the a priori Sittengesetz that humanity possesses intrinsically. What I called the "absolute interiority" of Kan- tian autonomous ethical subjectivity thus delimits the absolute horizon</page><page sequence="13">of any politics for Fichte: no political arrangements can legitimately contradict or alter humanity's inherent moral law, and any possible po- litical sphere can legitimately occupy only a restricted region within the sphere of human ethics itself, a region within which particular sorts of contractual arrangements, including the Burgervertrag, can be freely chosen or declined. While Bendavid is not rigorously consistent, his most emphatic pro- nouncements imply a view of the legitimate authority of the state nearly opposite Fichte's. Bendavid repeatedly resorts to the charge thatJews suffer from a lack of will (41, 60), and closes his tract addressing his rhe- torical Jewish readers: "may the Eternal One give you strength and courage to will" (66). The will he evokes is unmistakably the Kantian moral will, the self-founding moral gesture of the universal ethical sub- ject. Bendavid formulates the "main thesis of this treatise" as follows: [U]nless in the reforms that have been or are to be undertaken with them, the Jews intervene by abolishing their pointless ceremonial law, which utterly no longer accords with the present times; unless they adopt a purer religion, one more worthy of the divine father-the pure teaching of Moses-they will necessarily remain, even after being bap- tized, indifferentists and citizens harmful to the state. (45)36 Bendavid's rhetoric minimizes the agency of the state in the "re- forms" to which he refers and locates the moral struggle within the Jewish subject himself instead of between Jews and the state. Jews must "freely" will the reform that is to be undertaken with them. In order to be a good citizen, one must first reform one's self as a person; it becomes the moral responsibility of each Jew to give up traditional Judaism in favor of pure rational (Kantian) religion (packaged here disingenuously as "the pure teaching of Moses"). Bendavid holds that the state has the right to intervene in the lives of individualJews, and he occults the violence such an intervention entails by equating it with a moral shortcoming on the part of individualJews themselves. To be sure, Bendavid's position in On Jewish Characteristics on the extent to which the state should intervene in the lives of Jews is at times ambiguous and seemingly ambivalent. Bendavid certainly ar- gues against the efficacy of state coercion. On Joseph's project of En- lightening the Jews, Bendavid comments that "the influence of the prince, to the extent that it consists in anything more than a removal of obstacles, effects nothing at all unless the people willingly cooper- ates and does what no prince can order it to do: will to be enlight- ened!" (41). Were the state to force the Jews into "the rights of [85] Bendavid's &amp; Fichte's Kantian Fantasies ven-Erik Rose Sven-Erik Rose</page><page sequence="14">[86] Jewish Social Studies humanity," their compliance would be only external and superficial, not heart-felt. Worse, since unenlightened Jews erroneously link mo- rality (which is properly a completely "internal" matter of good will) with the "outward" observance of Jewish law, were they suddenly made to desist from their outward observance, whatever moral sensi- bility they possessed would become imperiled (41-42). Bendavid points several times in On Jewish Characteristics to the moral danger the Jew, who has so long conflated "outward" observance with "in- ward" morality, faces when challenged to modify his practices. (Ide- ally, of course, the Jew would affirm a morality beyond traditional practice; but, more likely, he might throw out the "ethical" baby with the "ritual" bath water.)37 Bendavid's dilemma is clear enough. Approaching the question of political rights forJews as he does from the standpoint of the Kantian moral subject, he both cannot and yet must rely on the intervention of the state. On the one hand, if theJews are coerced into "enlightening" themselves, such externally imposed "enlightenment" will be devoid of true moral content. Enlightenment ultimately comes down (must come down) to a matter of will. On the other hand, if left to themselves, the majority ofJews would continue to practice traditionalJudaism and feel no need "to enlighten" themselves at all. Bendavid's dilemma, then, is closely related to the problem of mediation in Kantian ethics that we examined above, and it can be formulated as a problem of how to get "inside" the moral will of the Jew when Jewish will seems to be utterly "outside" the sphere of pure moral reason. Bendavid is in need of a par- adoxical, noncoercive form of coercion-and this is what he finds, or at least what he seeks, in decapitation, a fantasy of total violence that seems to resolve (or obliterate) the paradox of how the state might ever legitimately intervene to transform theJews' will. At this point, we should examine Bendavid's comment about de- capitating theJewish hydra in its immediate discursive context: [T]he restriction the state imposes on the happiness of these noble souls [Bendavid's fourth category of "Enlightened"Jews] is, I hear, to be lifted. Frederick William, the father of all upright men, also wishes, in accordance with his compassionate heart, to be the father of all upright Jews. But how long that nonsense with the shameful, senseless ceremo- nial law will be carried on, how long theJew will continue to believe that the divine father will bestow upon him a special crown for observing it-only He who knows everything knows this! Certainly it can never cease if no one dares to speak loudly and earnestly to the hearts of the Jews, and makes robustly apparent to them the imprudence of the main- tenance of their customs; but at the same time also asks the state for its</page><page sequence="15">endorsement [Genehmigung] of this abolition, since the maintenance [of Jewish custom] must needs have a truly harmful influence on the char- acter of the Jew and, through him, on the state. In order to bring this about [bewirken], it will, I believe, be sufficient given the wisdom of the government to remark that, without this general abolition of the cere- monial law, things will needs transpire as they unfortunately always have with every ferment that has arisen amongst the Jews. A portion of them, via various routes and means, get themselves free fromJudaism, and the others huddle together more closely than before, abandon themselves more eagerly to their nonsense, and propagate it more prolifically. It is the hydra, all of whose heads must be cut off at once if two are not to grow back in place of every one severed. (54-55) This passage deals directly with the central question of Bendavid's treatise: how to convertJews into Menschen and Burger. The answer involves an attack on two fronts. Bendavid appeals toJews to reform themselves from within, and he appeals to the state to aid in a "total" reform from without. Bendavid's problem, clearly, is how to mediate between these two spheres, how to bring the moral Other into the "absolute" interiority of Kantian moral subjectivity.38 The absolute in- teriority or self-referentiality of Kantian morality is predicated on the impossibility of such a problem arising in the first place. The "univer- sal" Kantian moral logic with which Bendavid would appeal to the Jew as moral Other is only binding, paradoxically, to the extent that there can exist no moral Other to address. In this light it is interest- ing to note one of Bendavid's rhetorical strategies, when addressing his third category of "good-hearted"Jews, for infiltrating and assimi- lating their moral essence and thus undermining any claim they might have to moral autonomy. "You already feel like Menschen," Bendavid writes, sounding much like a moral hypnotist of sorts, en- tering into and giving voice to the silent recesses of the Jews' moral will; "You already wish, secretly, to be Menschen." Adopting the tone of the prophet of Enlightenment, he continues: "You lack only strength. Come listen! I want to inspire you with strength. Hear the consequences of your cowardice and shudder!" (59-60). Bendavid at- tempts literally to "speak" the essence of a "universal" moral will (Mut, Kraft, Wille) "into" (ein-sprechen) the secret and silent (im Stillen) void of Jewish ethical otherness, the only form-a void, nothing- that ethical alterity can take from the point of view of Kantian ethical universalism. How to address, even if only to interpolate, the moral Other when any alterity is inimical to the very universal morality into which the Other is meant to be interpolated? In order to overcome this insoluble paradox, Bendavid makes his [87] Bendavid's &amp; Fichte's Kantian Fantasies Sven-Erik Rose Sven-Erik Rose</page><page sequence="16">[88] Jewish Social Studies appeal to the state. Since the Jewish subject necessarily remains out- side the orbit of the conscience of "the" moral subject that would like to colonize the Jewish subject without, however, being able to ac- knowledge or address it, the task of accomplishing the impossible mediation between the morally other and the morally autonomous devolves on the external power of the state. And yet, even as it is called on to remedy the essential inability on the part of universal moral subjectivity to engage an Other, the state cannot be seen as truly ex- ternal to the moral sphere, either, without becoming inimical to the very moral subjectivity it wishes to instill in the Jew. Thus, Bendavid assumes, at least rhetorically, the political good will of Frederick Wil- liam, as he had done with Joseph when discussing Joseph's projects for reforming the Jews in his lands. The political intentions of these heads of state are in complete agreement with-are the political ana- logues of-the good will of Kantian ethics. There can be no funda- mental discord between the moral and the political spheres because politics is predicated on, derives its legitimacy from, and should merely "extend" ethics. Far from overstepping its legitimate moral au- thority, then, the state, in a presumed preestablished harmony with the moral law, effectively becomes the agent of moral N6tigung. The state does not coerce Jews but rather gives them the gift of moral au- tonomy itself, coerces them only into obedience to their "own" moral freedom.39 The attempt to harmonize the violence of state power with the moral autonomy of the subject remains fragile at best. The problem- atic equation of state agency with moral agency itself cannot provide a satisfactory resolution of the dilemma of how to engage Kantian N6tigung in aJewish subject who seems to exist outside the purport- edly universal "inside" of Kantian ethics. In fact, this dilemma seems insoluble by any but purely phantasmic means. I suggest that Benda- vid conjures his gruesome image of decapitation as yet another at- tempt to resolve this aporia. Indeed, a great deal is going on in this metaphor, which is too easily overlooked precisely because it is, while alarming, after all "only" a metaphor. Arguing that only a total abolition ofJewish "ceremonial" practice would be effectual, Bendavid envisions a "clean break" from tradi- tional Judaism, likening the state-sponsored program of eradication he proposes to the heroic task of simultaneously severing all the myr- iad heads of the mythical hydra. We are reminded of the violence of the categorical imperative that is, I have argued, "self-inflicted" at, or even as, the inception of Kantian ethical subjectivity. If individual Jews can muster, from within, the will to become Menschen, then the</page><page sequence="17">state, in its paternalistic good will, will surely adopt them as Burger. But should they obstinately persist in their allegiance to the collective Jewish "pathology," the state should intervene to "cut off" the malig- nantJewishness they lack the will to "cast off" themselves. In doing vi- olence to Jewish collective existence, the state does not violate the basic rights of the Jews because, within Bendavid's particular deploy- ment of Kantian logic, it is only through this very violence that the Jews are constituted as truly autonomous human beings. The state's violent intervention stands in for the "self-inflicted" violence inaugu- rating the Kantian ethical subject and thereby creates the very "au- tonomous" moral subjects with whose moral law its politics can harmonize. If, in Kant's moral philosophy, N6tigung is self-imposed by one's own moral freedom, Bendavid's coercion of his fellowJews is of a more violent sociopolitical cast: Kant's practical reason, we might say, becomes Bendavid's tactical reason, as he admonishesJews to will what is, as he sees it, practically necessary. The normalizing thrust of the last part of On Jewish Characteristics attempts to provide the N6ti- gung required to correct the historically deformed or "pathologically affected" Willkiir of his less enlightened coreligionists. Bendavid views it as his task to present the Jews with a moral imperative to "cast off theirJewishness" and become universal Menschen. The metaphor of decapitation seems perfectly chosen to finesse what remains an essentially insoluble problem of how to incorporate any instance of moral alterity into the absolute interiority of Kantian ethics. In its absoluteviolence, decapitation provides a phantasmic res- olution of this problem of the impossibility of mediation with the ab- solute. Decapitation is precisely a form of noncoercive coercion, a form of mediation so total that it effectively cancels its own mediatory function. The moral subject constructed by the absolute violence of decapitation is not "scarred," as it were, by this violence, and can bear no witness to it, precisely because it is instantaneous and total. As Daniel Arasse writes in his study of the guillotine, "By its instanta- neous action, the guillotine sets before our eyes the invisibility of death at the very instant of its occurrence, exact and indistinguish- able."40 Just as the guillotine redefined death as a moment without history, narrative, or self-awareness, the violence of "moral" decapita- tion inflicts no violence because it eradicates the other instantaneously. Simply put, there is no Jewish subject left who could have suffered a morally unwarranted coercion. Further, Bendavid's metaphor engages two important oppositions: individual autonomy versus collectivity, and humanity versus mon- strosity. Traditionally thought of as the key to Jewish survival, am yis- [89] Bendavid's &amp; Fichte's Kantian Fantasies Sven-Erik Rose Sven-Erik Rose</page><page sequence="18">[90] Jewish Social Studies rael (the Jewish people) now appears as a monster. It is still the key to survival, but the survival in question is no longer that ofJewish tradi- tion but rather that of the pathology of Jewishness. Unless utterly eradicated, the malignant Jewish hydra will only metastasize: two heads will grow back for every one severed. Decapitation of the many- headed hydra is not only a means of slaying the monster but also one of fully individuating its only semiautonomous heads. Bendavid's metaphor is skillfully chosen indeed: theJewish disease can be cured only ifJewish individualization through decapitation is realized com- pletely. The Jew's head that remains afflicted with Jewishness remains only semiautonomous, and therefore, from Bendavid's Kantian point of view, effectively only semi-human: latently and potentially human, yes, but still connected to the non-human "monster" of theJewish col- lectivity. Bendavid castigates with particular vitriol the pathological vigilance (a sign of denatured individuals) with which Jews observe public ritual, the collective practices of the communal Jewish body that are patently irreducible to any definition that would contain reli- gion within the sphere of strictly individual moral conscience. Just as the morality of the Kantian human individual is universal, Jews must universally be made moral individuals in order to exit the sphere of the deformed and monstrous and become fully human. If they will not choose to be morally free individuals, they must be coerced into becoming "free." They must be severed from the collective monster of the Jewish people by a force so absolute in its violence that it para- doxically obliterates any traces of its violence: decapitation. The political intentions of Fichte's assessment of the essential non- humanity of the Jew, often taken to be a salient moment in the con- struction of modern philosophical antisemitism, are basically opposed to Bendavid's, yet in rhetoric and, more importantly, in underlying con- ception, Fichte and Bendavid are strikingly similar. An examination of Fichte's Kantian framework will show how perilously close Bendavid, following a similar Kantian reasoning, came to Fichte's position. Fichte argues against the very possibility of Jewish assimilation into the civil community of the state. He viewsJews as already consti- tuting a state apart, a "state within a state," as he puts it, and thus as ineligible for inclusion in the civil contract of the larger state. And Fichte infamously concludes that the only means he can see for in- cluding Jews in the civil contract would be to cut off their heads and to replace them with different heads totally free ofJewish ideas. Not only is Fichte's statement alarming but it also-a point seldom appreciated-abruptly turns against the philosophical defense of the French Revolution that the philosopher has been preparing for more</page><page sequence="19">than a hundred pages and which amounts essentially to a defense of the rights of free individuals to form states within states. From Fich- te's point of view, there is simply no moral justification for prohibit- ing autonomous individuals from forming states within states.41 There can be no fundamental incompatibility between different states, be- cause the sphere of any possible civil contract or state, predicated as it is on the moral law, can never drift to the horizon of the moral world and fall off. The human Sittengesetz is the ultimate source of authority for-and as such does not so much adjudicate between as obviate the very need for any adjudication between-all the various states in the human community.42 What, then, is so problematic about theJewish "state within a state" that Fichte discusses? Although Fichte's deployment of the label "state within the state" to refer to the Jews is highly memorable and can in- deed be said to inaugurate the modern, antisemitic career of this slo- gan (which had long been used to refer to various non-Jewish groups), it tends to obscure what is actually at stake.43 If the issue were really one of Jewish adherence to a Jewish state, there would in fact be no problem. However, it is not really as Burger that Fichte's Jews are problematic but as Menschen. If Jews pose a threat to Fichte's politi- cal philosophy-and the violence with which he assaults them sug- gests that they do-it is not by virtue of constituting a state "within" the state but by virtue of testing the very limits of the human commu- nity itself on which Fichte predicates the legitimacy of all states. What is so deeply troubling about Fichte'sJews is the doubt they cast on the ineluctability of the logic governing the "universal" moral sphere. It is not difficult to see why one must locate the problem Fichte has with the Jews and Jewish subjectivity (and the inseparability of collec- tive and subjectiveJewish identity is indeed one way of stating the prob- lem) not in their status as Burger but rather as Menschen. This limit is in fact the only truly significant border in Fichte's moral-philosophical topography. As we have seen, the mere existence of aJewish state based on a Bfrgervertrag amongJews would present no philosophical prob- lem to Fichte. HisJewish state is, however, not merely another example of a civil contract between freely reasoning human beings who happen to be Jewish, but rather a collectivity bound by a 'Jewish" reasoning that seems fundamentally incommensurable with autonomous "human" moral reason. Jews represent the (im)possibility of moral al- terity, of being outside of Kantian-Fichtian ethical humanity. Fichte's Jews hover-unbearably for him-at the limit of this moral-human sphere, a limit that must exist absolutely or not at all. It is the Jews' purported misanthropy, and not even their lack of [91] Bendavid's &amp; Fichte's Kantian Fantasies Sven-Erik Rose Sven-Erik Rose</page><page sequence="20">[92] Jewish Social Studies belief in Jesus Christ, that makes them so ethically problematic: here it becomes clear that Fichte's Jews are not opposed to the Christian community-even if understood in essentially secular, "cultural" terms-but rather to the human community:44 May the Jews indeed not believe in Jesus Christ, may they not even be- lieve in any God, if they only did not believe in two different moral laws and in a misanthropic God. Human rights they must have, even if they do not grant us the same; because they are human beings.45 TheJews' misanthropy goes hand in hand with their adherence to an additional, incommensurable Sittengesetz. (Since the moral law is synonymous with ultimate respect for the human freedom of all human beings, misanthropy and adherence to a different moral law imply each other mutually.) The curious italicization in the phrase "they are human beings" (a final determination on a hard-to-decide question? a sign of perplexity?) aptly testifies to the way the disparate Jewish Sittengesetz strains against the very limits of the human as Fichte understands it. And, much as in Bendavid, the only possible mediation between the Mensch and the Jew, the only way to incorpo- rate theJews into the sphere of the human whose limits they so vex, is through the absolute violence of decapitation. A Diagnostician at the End of Jewish History A similar Kantian framework brings the fringe maskil Bendavid's text extremely close to Fichte's philosophical antisemitism. The violent fan- tasies of decapitation to which both thinkers resort in order to resolve the conceptual impasse of Jewish ethical difference must be traced back to the violence of the Kantian moral absolutism they take as their point of departure. Yet the relationship each thinker has to the ques- tion of the political status of the Jews is radically different. For Fichte, Jews and Jewish ethics are a vexing obstacle to his totalizing ethical project. Although this issue is complex enough in its own right, it is overdetermined for Bendavid by the more poignant one of how to be a Jewish Mensch. This question is not merely philosophical for theJewish Kantian Bendavid but also a predicament at once political and per- sonal. After all, in OnJewish Characteristics, Bendavid is not simply trying to show his fellowJews the way to become Menschen but, perhaps above all, trying to constitute himself as one before a German-language en- lightenment reading public. Kant provides Bendavid with the struc-</page><page sequence="21">tural possibility, however problematic, both of narrating a certain version of Jewish history as pathological and of ultimately resolving this history into a suprahistorical model of the moral subject. This (Kan- tian) perspective on, while yet outside, the pathologies of history is re- produced in the performative dynamics of Bendavid's text, for it is in speaking of the sick Jewish soul that Bendavid attempts to inhabit a locus-a diagnostic locus of enunciation-beyond the pathologies of Jewish history and subjectivity altogether. Just as moral freedom, for Kant, is in essence what remains once the causal relations of the empirical world have been transcended or stripped away, so true Jewish freedom is only possible for Bendavid through a leap beyond the causal relations of history. It is incumbent on each Jew to "shake off" his pathological history and thereby enter the polity-a realm of idealized or "intelligible" political relations- as a universal (and naturally German-speaking) Mensch and Burger. TheJews' particular history should disappear like a symptom. From the Kantian point of view, the relationship between history and moral will is such that history can only unfold as a narrative of the progressive realization of the essentially suprahistorical moral con- tent that was latent in man all the time. History is necessary for the re- alization of this moral core and yet essentially extrinsic to it, and so seemingly superfluous. Kant's dualistic vision of the subject as both inside and essentially outside history is manifest in his famous defini- tion of Enlightenment as "man's exit from his self-incurred tutelage to opinions of others." History is the process of exiting history; it is the progressive excavation or distillation of the pure suprahistorical subject from the historical forces that the subject is guilty of having suffered. A pathology that is historically incurred is self-incurred: to suffer history is to be passive, morally and psychically weak. Bendavid identifies the arrival of Mendelssohn and the Enlighten- ment as the promise of a new era in-or beyond-Jewish history, one that can only now be fully realized (32-34, 56). But even as Bendavid ventriloquizes his message through Mendelssohn, the latter merely serves as aJewish stand-in for Kant, notwithstanding the incompatibil- ity between the two philosophers' positions on religious truth. Benda- vid disingenuously appropriates this second Moses in order to admonish his contemporary coreligionists to "return" to "the pure doctrine of Moses, the doctrine of natural religion" (65), a "doctrine" that Benda- vid understands, contra Mendelssohn, according to Kantian postu- lates.46 Self-styled prophet of Enlightenment or messiah of Menschheit, Bendavid states repeatedly in the final pages of his tract that the time ofJudaism is past. The moment of truth has arrived at long last, and it is [93] Bendavid's &amp; Fichte's Kantian Fantasies Sven-Erik Rose Sven-Erik Rose</page><page sequence="22">[94] Jewish Social Studies time to make the (quasi, or anti-messianic) leap beyondJewish history into the realm of Menschheit and its political analogue, the state.47 Bendavid's Kantian framework permits him, then, to trace a history (or etiology) he considers constitutive ofJewish particularity while still pos- iting a universalist "human" essence both anterior and, potentially, posterior to the historical aberration of Judaism's pathologizing rab- binic detour. And in diagnosing the Jew as "sick," as Mensch manque, Bendavid constructs himself indirectly as this universal, post-Jewish Mensch, the condition of possibility of such a diagnosis.

Hereafter, page references to this work will appear in parentheses in the text. 3 Allen Wood hopes that collecting all of Kant's ethical writings, especially the often-neglected Metaphysics of Morals, in one volume "will help correct the false (often grotesque) images of [Kant's] ethical theory that have been formed by reading only the foundational works (the Groundwork and second Critique)." Allen Wood, "General Introduction" to Immanuel Kant, PracticalPhilosophy, trans. and ed. MaryJ. Gregor (New York, 1996), xxxiii. In 1793, of course, only the Groundwork and second Critique had appeared. I have found no evidence of a direct connection between Ben- david's and Fichte's fantasies ofJewish decapitation, though to judge from the timing of publication, it is possible that Fichte could have read Bendavid before Contribution appeared. Bendavid's preface to his Etwas zur Charackteristick derjuden is dated March 1793; the first part of Fichte's Contribution (containing his fantasy ofJewish emancipation through de- capitation) appeared at theJubilatenmesse (i.e., in mid-May,Jubilate being the third Sunday after Easter) of that year. 4 My labeling of Fichte's Contribution as a discourse of emergent national- ism requires qualification. Strictly speaking, in Contribution Fichte does not write as a nationalist. As we shall see later in this section of my text, his argument is about the state and is anchored in the autonomy of human beings as such rather than in the particular character or rights of</page><page sequence="23">an ethnic nation. Nor does Fichte at this stage support his antisemitism with the nationalist opposition of German versusJew but rather with the opposition ofJew versus Mensch. With the admittedly dubious aid of hind- sight, however, I am tempted to call this opposition "proto-nationalist" for the reason that Fichte'sJews of Contribution can already be said to em- body (quite literally) the impossibility of the state into which they can only be incorporated through (a fantasy of) corporal mutilation. Pre- cisely when imagining theJews, Fichte does come close to an ethnic essentialism. 5 Baron coined the term in his seminal essay "Ghetto and Emancipa- tion," which he ends with a call to "break with the lachrymose theory of pre-Revolutionary woe and to adopt a view more in accord with historic truth."

In contrast, the later turn to social and political issues among the radical fringe of maskilim was thoroughly implicated in attempts to reconceiveJewish history.

The latter phrase, it is worth noting, is highly reminiscent of Ben- david's own provocative assessment of exilicJewish religious practice as "dies[e] Art Krieg zu fiihren" (this method of waging war). 16 For early-twentieth-century studies that posit strong affinities if not identity betweenJudaism and Kantian moral philosophy, see Hermann Cohen, "Innere Beziehungen der Kantischen Philosophie zumJuden- tum" (1910), inJiidische Schriften, 3 vols., ed.

Bendavid was the first person to deliver public lectures on Kant in Vienna (from 1794 to 1797), where he moved in 1791 and where he wrote On Jewish Characteristics (see also Bourel, "Eine Genera- tion spater," 371). Three volumes of Bendavid's (abridged) lectures on the three Kantian critiques, one volume devoted to each, appeared in 1795-96. Bendavid would remain philosophically a Kantian through- out his life. Heinrich Heine, who met Bendavid in the early 1820s through their mutual association with the Verein ffir die Cultur und Wissenschaft derJuden in Berlin, described Bendavid somewhat deri- sively and with characteristic irony as "ein eingefleischter Kantianer" (a Kantian to the bone).

Niewohner discusses the Orthodox Kantian Isaac Breuer, who found in Kant's first critique a philosophical basis for understand- ing Torah as noumenal. In his chapter on Breuer and other Orthodox Kantians, David Ellenson does not include Niew6hner's study in a list of "six major articles on the relationship between Immanuel Kant and Judaism [that] have appeared in the twentieth century" (Ellenson, "German Orthodoxy," 15). 24 See Saul Ascher, Eisenmenger der Zweite: Nebst einem vorangesetzten Sendsch- reiben an Herrn ProfessorFichte in Jena (Berlin, 1794), 36, 80. 25 Significantly, in his remarks on Kant's ethics in Versuch iiber das Vergnii- gen (Vienna, 1794), 236-48, Bendavid admits his confusion about the apparent absence of any norm underpinning moral authority in Kant, a problem he illuminates but does not resolve via a comparison with the political authority of the legislator (Gesetzgeber). Yet the problem of how to identify the boundary between political and moral authority- the crucial problem that animates Bendavid's On Jewish Characteris- tics-does not lead him to mount a serious challenge to Kant, and, in his Vorlesungen iiber die Critik derpractischen Vernunft (Vienna, 1796), he seems no longer perplexed and faithfully explicates Kant's theory. 26 Gillian Rose,Judaism and Modernity: Philosophical Essays (Oxford, 1993), 122. 27 Both Bendavid and Fichte followed the events in France closely. As Fichte's title suggests, his Contribution Toward the Correction of the Public's Assessment of theFrench Revolution is a prolonged, if indirect, apology for the French Revolution. Bendavid, for his part, together with David Friedlander, quickly translated into German the petitions that had led to the Assembly's 1791 resolution to grantJews full civil rights.

Norman Kemp Smith (New York, 1965), 93. 30 "Infinite" in the sense that it sustains faith in the Kantian "postulates" of God, Providence, and the immortality of the soul. The subjective infinity of the "moral law within" indeed provides the counterpart to the "starry heavens above," in Kant's famous phrase. 31 In certain formulations, it should be noted, Kant rather confusingly uses Wille to designate both practical reason and its perversion by "ex- ternal" forces (gewisse Triebfeder), which requires the correction of N6ti- gung. See, e.g., Kant, Werke in zwilf Bdnden, 7: 41. 32 See ibid., 7: 143; Kant, Practical Philosophy, 165-66. 33 In his 1793 Religion Within the Boundaries of Mere Reason, Kant opines that "Strictly speaking,Judaism is not a religion at all but simply the union of a number of individuals who, since they belonged to a par- ticular stock, established themselves into a community under purely</page><page sequence="27">political laws" (Immanuel Kant, Religion and Rational Theology, trans. and ed. Allen Wood and George di Giovanni [New York, 1996], 154). Yirmiyahu Yovel aptly describes Kant's refusal to acknowledge any moral (i.e. "truly" religious) content inJudaism; see his Dark Riddle: Hegel, Nietzsche, and theJews (University Park, Pa., 1998), 7. See also Ascher's incisive critique of Kant's remarks onJudaism in Religion in Eisenmenger der Zweite, 55-79. 34 It is this simultaneous acknowledgment and negation of the modern subject's difference from itself that Michel Foucault identifies as char- acteristic of the "Kantian moment"; see Foucault, The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences (New York, 1994), 343 n. 2. This is a transitional moment between an older philosophical paradigm, in which an ethics was understood to inhere in the very nature of the uni- verse, and modern thought, which is characterized by an irreducibly performative aspect-it is "a perilous act" (ibid., 328)-for which, con- sequently, in Foucault's view, "no morality is possible" (ibid.). Indeed, Kant's simultaneous acknowledgment of the performativity of thought and categorical dis-acknowledgment of the risk (ethical, conceptual) thought as such entails-"risk" meaning openness to mutation, the possibility or even inevitability of the thinking subject, by virtue of its act of thinking, differing from itself-is integral to Bendavid's project of normalizing the Jews, which is to say of pathologizingJewish differ- ence. Ontological mutation is possible but only, ultimately, in the form of deviation from a norm. As I shall argue in the text below,Jewish his- tory for Bendavid can thus only be written as a narrative of pathological deviation. 35 Friedrich Nietzsche: Simtliche Werke, 15 vols., ed. G. Colli and M. Montin- ari (Munich, 1988), 5: 300. Jonathan Strauss elaborates an elegant cri- tique of "the full negative force of sublime freedom" in Kant's aesthetic theory; see Strauss, Subjects of Terror: Nerval, Hegel, and the Modern Self (Stanford, 1998), 7-12, esp. 9. Strauss also mentions Kant's moral phi- losophy in ibid., 300 n. 33. 36 Navon points to this passage as evidence of a new Staatsbewufitsein amongJews and paraphrases it aptly: "For if the state, Ben David ar- gues, in its goodness tries to absorb you, how dare you,Jews, stand in the way? If you refuse to take the necessary steps, you do so at your own peril" ("Encounter of German Idealists," 231). 37 See also Bendavid, Charackteristick derJuden, 61-63, and the cautionary tale (or mini case study) of the tragicJewish convert in ibid., note on pp. 63-64. 38 Of course, the relationship between the subjective interiority of the practicingJew and the exteriority of the state undergoes an uncanny reversal when we consider that the particular interiority of theJew is by definition exterior to what I have described as the "absolute interiority" of the universal Kantian moral Mensch, which Bendavid sees as essen- tially coterminous with the citizen, or Burger. [99] Bendavid's &amp; Fichte's Kantian Fantasies Sven-Erik Rose</page><page sequence="28">[100] Jewish Social Studies 39 Whereas the essential identity of the moral and political led Fichte to attenuate the role and authority of the state sharply, Bendavid attempts to enlist the state's support for a general abolition ofJewish ritual (allgemeine Abschaffung des Ceremonialgesetzes). If politics, at bottom, is merely ethics by other means, then the state can be called on to en- force morality. In System ofEthics, Fichte himself would theorize a re- gime of ethically oriented compulsion, the Notstaat; see Johann Gottlieb Fichtes sdmtliche Werke, ed.J. H. Fichte, vol. 4, Das System der Sittenlehre nach den Principien der Wissenschaftslehre ([1798] Berlin, 1965), 238-44. 40 Daniel Arasse, The Guillotine and the Terror, trans. Christopher Miller (London, 1989), 36. 41 Following Fichte's own graphic of four concentric circles representing, from largest to smallest, the spheres of moral conscience, natural rights, contracts tout court, and civil contracts in particular (i.e. states), one could represent a plurality of states as so many non-overlapping circles ("polka dots," if you will) within the sphere of possible contrac- tual arrangements. See Fichte, Beitrag, 97. In such a Fichtian schematic, states "within" states would look no different than the larger states within which they were geographically situated. This is worth empha- sizing: if represented in Fichte's own schematic, states "within" states are indistinguishable from other states. The intersection of states-in this case, the location of a smaller state "within" a larger one-is purely spatial and, though raising a host of practical issues, is, within Fichte's framework, philosophically irrelevant. Different civil contracts, philo- sophically speaking, cannot overlap and are mutually exclusive. There is, then, an interesting tension between the rhetorical power of Fichte's antisemitic slogan and his analytic framework, which actually strips the formulation of any real philosophical integrity. Moreover, the labeling ofJews as a "state within a state" seems curiously able to weather not only its own philosophical vacuity (from Fichte's point of view) but also its own utter inaptness as an image. As Fichte points out in his highly alarmist way (Beitrag, 114),Jews formed a community across a great number of disparate states. Thus, if they, asJews, constitute a state, then they certainly do not constitute a state "within" any state, neither philosophically nor geographically. The rhetorical force of Fichte's slogan seems capable of overwhelming, indeed exploding, the logic of the very discourse in which it is deployed. 42 As Allen Wood writes, Kant's "Formula of Autonomy" in the Grundwerk "leads naturally to the thought of all rational beings as constituting a moral community under a common legislation, whose source is the rational volition they all share" ("General Introduction," xxix). 43 On the history of this slogan, seeJacob Katz, "A State Within a State: The History of an Anti-Semitic Slogan," in his Emancipation and Assimi- lation: Studies in ModernJewish History (Westmead, Engl., 1972), 47-76; on Fichte, see ibid., esp. 59-64. 44 Ascher critiqued this structural exclusion ofJews from "humanity" in</page><page sequence="29">Fichte and Kant directly; see Ascher, Eisenmenger der Zweite, 77-78. On Ascher as a critic of Kant and Fichte, see Hess, Germans, Jews, and the Claims of Modernity, 137-67. 45 Fichte, Beitrag, 115. AnthonyJ. La Vopa aptly characterizes Fichte's dis- tinction between theJewish versus human community: "The language virtually equates the human with the Christian. In the face of the Jew- ish presence, Fichte's Kantian reverence for 'humanity' provides a new sanction for his ethnocentrism. TheJews, he implies, have no one but themselves to blame for their pariah status; they have placed them- selves beyond the pale of human love. That implication stands oddly juxtaposed to his acknowledgment that theJews, though undeserving of 'civil rights,' cannot be deprived of 'human rights"' (La Vopa, Fichte: The Self and the Calling of Philosophy, 1762-1799 [New York, 2001], 146- 47). La Vopa's reconstruction of the historical, biographical, and dis- cursive contexts of Fichte's antisemitic remarks is rich and nuanced (ibid., 131-49). 46 Even Bendavid's sense of "natural religion" is thoroughly Kantian. Mi- chael Meyer criticizes the fact that, in OnJewish Characteristics, "Bendavid had simply rejected what Mendelssohn had posited as the differentiating element ofJudaism-its ritual laws-while giving aJewish coloring to what Mendelssohn had determined were its universal components" (Meyer, Response to Modernity, 21). Although Meyer is certainly right in pointing out the disingenuousness of Bendavid's appropriation of Men- delssohn, this disingenuousness may be even more comprehensive than Meyer suggests. The implicit Kantian paradigm within which Bendavid is working undermines even his ostensible affirmation of the tenets of nat- ural religion. Not even the tenets of "natural religion" to which Bendavid would reduceJudaism, that is, are consistent with the "universal compo- nents" of natural religion as Mendelssohn understood them. Even though Bendavid clearly wishes to smooth over this fact in order to ap- propriate Mendelssohn to his own position, the tenets of his "natural religion" are in fact Kantian postulates. This is abundantly clear not only from the general Kantian cast of Bendavid's thought but also from the way in which he describes the members of his fourth category ofJews, the "proponents of genuine natural religion" who "feel the necessity of the duty to believe" (Bendavid, Charackteristick derJuden, 51). These select few enlightenedJews understand the tenets of natural religion not as objec- tive and demonstrable truths (as did the philosophical Wolffian Men- delssohn) but rather as Kantian postulates, or as consequences of one's subjective moral reason in which it is one's (subjective) duty to believe. When admonishingJews to adopt the pure religion of Moses, Bendavid not only recreates Moses, the biblical prophet, in the guise of Moses the Enlightenment philosopher, but also uses Mendelssohn as aJewish stand-in for Kant. 47 It is apt that Bourel ("Eine Generation spater," 379) has pointed to the quasi-messianic tone of Bendavid's discourse. One suspects that this [101] Bendavid's &amp; Fichte's Kantian Fantasies Sven-Erik Rose Sven-Erik Rose</page><page sequence="30">[102] Jewish Social Studies Ben David, this son of David, is (already in OnJewish Characteristics) playing ironically off of his name, as he would do even more unmistak- ably three decades later in the epochal Zeitschriftfiir die Wissenschaft des Judentums (ZWJ). In "On the Jews' Belief in a Future Messiah (Accord- ing to Maimonides and the Cabbalists)," the first of his two contribu- tions to ZWJ, Bendavid tries to contest the centrality inJudaism of the belief in a messiah, and he ends with the emphatic assertion that the only messiah the Jews require is political emancipation.
