<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jumal of The Israel Prehistoric Society 36 (2006), 109-116 The Burials of Kfar HaHoresh - A Regional or Local Phenomenon? YOSEF GARFINKEL1 1 Hebrew University of Jerusalem Kfar HaHoresh is a small Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) site located in the Galilee of northern Israel. One radiometric date was obtained: 8,650±50 bp (RTT-3733.1), which after calibration with a single standard deviation is 7,740-7590 B.C. The site is on a slope, facing westward. It was severely damaged in recent decades by modern agricultural and construction activities (Goring-Morris 1991, 2000; Goring-Morris et al. 1994-5, 1998, 2001). An area of ca. 450 sq m was excavated over the years and a number of straight walls and plastered surfaces were unearthed. Below the plastered floors, Neolithic burials of a large number of individuals were found, including plastered skulls. Animal carcasses were associated with some burials. The rich data on the burial customs cast shadow upon daily life at the site, and produced the following interpretation (Goring-Morris 2000:113-114): "...the site was primarily used as a secluded regional funerary center by village settlements located in the surrounding lowlands... As such it was probably visited periodically by kin from surrounding settlement(s), though the possibility exists that there may also have been permanent occupation by a few 'Guardians'". The large quantities of flint, animal bones and various ground stone tools were also integrated in the cultic scenario: "Of course, it is also quite likely that many such "everyday""everyday" items may also have been accorded symbolic and ritual significance". In the same spirit a posthole in a plastered floor was interpreted as a base for a totem and roasting pits containing burnt animal bones "likely reflect more than mundane activities: they could perhaps reflect communal feasting" (Goring-Morris 2000:113-114). So far in the Neolithic of the Near East burials have always been associated with settlement sites. Thus, the claim for a "secluded regional funerary center" is rather revolutionary. 109</page><page sequence="2">110 YOSEF GARFINKEL et al. Notwithstanding the extremely important contribution of Kfar HaHoresh for the study of Neolithic burial customs, whether these burials represent a regional or local phenomenon is a legitimate question. Various aspects should be examined in evaluating this query: sampling size, sampling strategy, architecture, site formation process, material culture, and recently discovered burials at other Neolithic settlements. Sampling Size: The size of Kfar HaHoresh varies in different publications: 5-6 dunams (Goring-Morris 1991:80), 10 dunams (Goring-Morris et al. 1994-5:74) or 1-2 acre (that is 4-8 dunams) (Goring-Morris 2000:107). As one dunam equals 1,000 sq m the various sizes indicated rang from 4,000 to 10,000 sq m. So far ca. 450 sq m have been excavated, nearly 10% of the settlement. If the site size is 10,000 sq m only ca. 5% has been excavated. In other words, about 90-95 percent of the site remains unknown. Can one conclude that the entire area was used for burials? Clearly, a larger horizontal exposure is required to confirm such a proposal. Sampling Strategy: During the first season, before the manual work started, five trenches were cut from topsoil to bedrock by a mechanical device. Four of them, with a total length of ca. 85 m, were dug through Neolithic occupation debris (Goring-Morris 1991, Fig. 2). While cleaning the sections of these trenches, various burials and a plastered skull were found. These rich locations were then chosen for further excavation and yielded many burials. To the best of my knowledge, no other Neolithic site in the Near East has been tested in this way. Usually, excavations start from topsoil and randomly unearth whatever lies below. While the common sampling strategy produces a random sample, the strategy adopted at Kfar HaHoresh represents a deliberate focus on burials. This creates a methodological problem when comparing Kfar HaHoresh with other sites. In addition at a number of Neolithic sites, including Yiftahel, Munhata, and others, when a plastered floor was discovered it was usually not removed, and when removed, only 10 20 cm were excavated below it. At Kfar HaHoresh, due to the deep mechanical sections, it became apparent that burials may lie deeper then previously known. This is perhaps the main lesson of Kfar HaHoresh to Neolithic excavations: burials can be found at significant depth below plastered floors. Architecture: Rectangular plastered buildings were found in various parts of the site. This type of plastered structure is the basic dwelling unit of the period and is known from sites located all over the Levant including Ugarit (de Contenson 1992), Byblos (Dunand 1973), Tell Ramad (de Contenson 2000), Tell Aswad (de Contenson 1995), Beisamoun (Lechevallier 1978), Yiftahel (Garfinkel 1987), 'Ain Ghazal (Rollefson and Simmons 1988) and Jericho (Kenyon 1981). The same structures, with similar sizes and building techniques, are described at Kfar HaHoresh as: "mortuary installations" (Goring-Morris 1998:2), "plastered</page><page sequence="3">THE BURIALS OF KFAR HAHORESH 1 \ \ surface", "funerary structures" or "plastered funerary monuments" (Goring-Morris 2000: 110, 114, 115). Public and cultic buildings are known in the Neolithic of the Near East from a number of sites: the tower of Jericho (Kenyon 1981), the large rounded structure at Jerf el Ahmar (Stordeur et al. 2001), and the temples at Gôbekli Tepe and Nevali Çori (Schmidt 1998; Hauptmann 1993). The architecture of Kfar HaHoresh, on the other hand, resembles ordinary and common dwelling units. Site Formation Processes: As can be seen in various published plans of Kfar HaHoresh, no complete structures were found. This is not an outstanding phenomenon as it is quite common to find missing walls in Pre-Pottery Neolithic B villages throughout the Levant: Ugarit (de Contenson 1992, Pis. XVII-XVIII), Byblos (Dunand 1973, Pis. VIII-XV), Tell Ramad (de Contenson 2000, Pis. VII, VIII2), Abu Gosh (Lechevallier 1978, Pis. I, IV), Beisamoun (Lechevallier 1978, Pl. XXV), Yiftahel (Garfinkel 1987, Fig. 5), 'Ain Ghazal (Rollefson and Simmons 1988, Pis. 1-3) and Jericho (Kenyon 1981, PI. 118). Stones were a valuable raw material in these villages and were extensively used for the construction of foundations. The plaster industry of the period also required large quantities of limestone for the production of plaster. Instead of carrying tons of stones from outside the site, it was easier to remove stones from walls of old or abandoned buildings. Recycling of stones, or even parts of old plastered floors, seems to have been quite common, but has a devastating effect on the preservation of architecture. The topographic situation of Kfar HaHoresh must be taken into consideration as well. The fragmented architecture seems to have a pattern - the preserved walls are all located in the southeastern part of the structures, while the missing walls are in the west and north (Goring Morris 2000, Fig. 5). When this phenomenon is compared with the natural topography of the site, it became apparent that the preserved walls are located up-slope, while the missing walls are located down-slope (see topographic map in Goring-Morris 1991, Fig. 2). A similar phenomenon has been observed at the nearby site of Yiftahel, also located on an east-west slope. The eastern part of the building was found quite intact while the western part was poorly preserved (Garfinkel 1987, Fig. 5). This is also true of the plastered floors: while the southern and eastern parts are better preserved, the northern and western parts are missing. It seems that the survival of architectural elements at Kfar HaHoresh was mainly challenged by slope erosion, a natural post-depositional process. Three different site formation processes contributed to the widespread disappearance of architectural remains at Kfar HaHoresh: a. Robbing and reuse of stones during the Neolithic period. b. 9,000 years of slope erosion during which the northern parts of buildings were worn away. c. Recent damage by various modern activities.</page><page sequence="4">112 YOSEF GARFINKEL et al. But not all features of the site suffered equally from these destructive processes. Pits and sunken installations were not as severely affected as walls and floors. An unbalance picture resulted, in which the underground dimension of human activity, burials in this case, became over-emphasized. Burials in Other Neolithic Settlements: The main aspects of burials uncovered at Kfar HaHoresh have parallels in other Neolithic sites: a. Location under floors. Pre-Pottery Neolithic B burials were found under plastered floors in almost every site of that period including Jericho (Kenyon 1981), Yiftahel (Hershkovitz et al. 1986), Tell Ramad (de Contenson 2000), 'Ain Ghazal (Rollefson and Simmons 1988:408-410) and Beisamoun (Lechevallier 1978:147-151). b. Concentrations with a large number of individuals. The number of individuals in some locations at Kfar HaHoresh appears to be quite high, but no quantitative data has yet been published. In Kenyon excavations at Jericho Stage XVIIA, "at least thirty" individuals were found (Kenyon 1981:78). In Beisamoun, below the floors of one building, nine individuals and two plastered skulls were found under room 188 and two additional individuals were found under room 150 (Lechevallier 1978:147-151). At Tell Aswad 25 individuals were found in a limited burial area (Stordeur 2003). At Ba'ja in southern Jordan a number of collective burials were excavated (Gebel and Hermansen 2001:17-18, 2004). In one of then three adults and nine infants were found (12 individuals altogether). The excavators concluded that: "Thus it would now seem that the collective burial found earlier in Area D is by no means unique. Rather, it has to be expected that each house unit has at least one small, chamber-like room in the basement containing a collective/the family burial" (Gebel and Hermansen 2004:15-16). c. Plastered skulls. These are now known from quite a number of sites: Jericho, Beisamoun, Tell Ramad, 'Ain Ghazal and recently from the renewed excavations of Tell Aswad (Stordeur 2003). A different type of modeling was found at Nahal Hemar Cave (Bar YosefandAlon 1988). d. Plastered skull in a plastered pit. One was reported from Tell Ramad (de Contenson 2000:56). e. Association of human skeletons and animal carcasses. Animal remains in graves are well known in prehistory, as early as the Middle Palaleolithic sites of Skhul and Qafzeh (McCown 1937; Vandermeersch 1989). In Natufian sites dogs were sometimes buried with the deceased (Davis and Valla 1978). This supports the view of the excavator of Kfar HaHoresh that "many specific aspects of PPNB ideological, ritual, and mortuary practices may be directly traced back some two to four millennia to the Early and Late Natufian" (Goring-Morris 2000:107). As to the Neolithic period itself, this custom was</page><page sequence="5">THE BURIALS OF KFAR HAHORESH 1 \ 3 reported from Çayônù (Ôzdogan 1999:47, 53), Ba'ja (Gebel and Hermansen 2004:15) and quite recently at the Pottery Neolithic site of Tell 'Ain el-Kerkh in northwest Syria (Tsuneki 2002). Here, under a thin plastered floor of a building (as at Kfar HaHoresh), a human infant was found together with infant suid, as well as a concentration of pig and cattle bones. f. A burial area inside a Neolithic village. A special area of the village dedicated to burials has been found at two sites. At Çayônu there is a building in which a few hundred burials were deposited (Ôzbeck 1988; Ôzdogan 1999) and recently, a burial area was found at Tell Aswad with four plastered skulls and the remains of 21 individuals (Stordeur 2003). Material Culture: Rich ritual paraphernalia and heavy investment in building decoration characterizes cultic activity in the Neolithic of the Near East, as known for example from Gôbekli Tepe (Schmidt 1998), Nevali Çori (Hauptmann 1993), 'Ain Ghazal (Rollefson 1983, 1986) andNahal Hemar Cave (Bar-Yosef and Alon 1988). Nahal Hemar Cave, as an example of cultic location outside a dwelling site, contained many symbolic items: masks, beads, anthropomorphic figurines, zoomorphic figurine, plastered statues, and modeled human skulls (Bar-Yosef and Alon 1988). Beside the skulls, no other human remains were found. Nahal Hemar Cave also produced a rather unique assemblage of flint and bone tools, which are fundamentally different from the typical assemblages unearthed at dwelling sites. The material culture at Kfar HaHoresh is, however, basically similar to contemporaneous settlements, "the chipped stone industry is not obviously much different from that of regular occupation sites" (Goring-Morris 2000:113). Enormous quantities of flint were found, over 120,000 in the first two seasons (Goring Morris et al. 1994-5, Table 1). Some exotic minerals were found, but "the overall picture in terms of quantity and variety is not particularly remarkable5' (Goring-Morris 2000: 113). Recently, baked clay objects were examined by pétrographie analysis and most were locally made (Biton 2004). Only one phenomenon has been considered to be an outstanding artistic expression, described as "depiction of the profile of an animal drawn with human and animal bones" (Goring-Morris et al. 1998, Figs. 3-4). I do not have the methodology to judge whether this bone arrangement was made intentionally or is an accidental distribution that happens to resemble an animal. In any case, such a display could have lasted a very short time, as exposed bones are quite fragile and would have been destroyed quickly by dogs, human trampling and the sun. This technique, if indeed practiced, would not have been suitable for extensive public rituals of a large community.</page><page sequence="6">114 YOSEF GARFINKEL et al. CONCLUSIONS On the one hand, Kfar HaHoresh produced architecture, material culture, and burials similar to those uncovered at other Pre-Pottery Neolithic B sites in the Levant. On the other hand, typical cultic paraphernalia (beside the plastered skulls) was not found. The site suffers from various depositional processes that removed large parts of its architecture. The location on a slope probably accelerates the natural erosion, at work continually for over 9,000 years. The underground burials better resist such processes and are thus better preserved. This situation creates the preliminary impression that the site functioned as a specialized regional cultic center. The aspects discussed above, and especially the new data on burials from two sites in Syria, Tell 'Ain el-Kerkh (Tsuneki 2002) and Tell Aswad (Stordeur 2003), indicate that Kfar HaHoresh is not fundamentally different from other Pre-Pottery Neolithic B settlements. The impressive and extremely important new data on the burials, meticulously unearthed by Goring-Morris and his staff, represent the local community that lived and died at the site. Kfar HaHoresh, together with Tell Aswad and Çayônii, probably indicate that in every Pre Pottery Neolithic B village there was a burial area within the settlement.
