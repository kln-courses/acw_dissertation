<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 11 Trust your senses :Growing wine and making  place in McLaren Vale William Skinner Abstract This chapter argues that the tasks and processes of wine production  undertaken by small‐scale producers not only serve to bring forth  or unlock a 'sense of place' in the wine but can also be seen to  continuously produce place itself. In the skilled performance of  these tasks, winegrowers engage intimately with the world around  them at a sensorial level: including touching the soil and the  vines, feeling the sun, wind and rain in the vineyard, smelling  and feeling the warmth of the fermenting grapes, and tasting the  wine at different stages of its production. For many, such physical  interaction (hands‐on doing) is extremely desirable in wine  production, as wine's 'authenticity' is often considered to relate  to the close interaction of people and place working in concert. It  is this sort of deep and attentive sensorial engagement of people  with their worlds, over time, that provides not only practical and  intellectual 'knowledge' but also a rich topography of feelings  and emotions attached to places and landscapes. I argue that the  production of this sort of emotional space, via the hands‐on tasks  and activities of small‐scale wine production, is a crucial element  in the development among many such winegrowers of a relational  or animic perspective, through which they see themselves, their  vines, wines and other aspects of their worlds as fundamentally  </page> <page sequence="2"> 176 | Emotions, Senses, Spaces intertwined and interrelated. Wines, vines and wine places are thus invested with 'meanings'  and 'emotions' — social products which are nevertheless linked inextricably to the sensuous  materiality of production and consumption. Introduction Too many people sit in air conditioned cabins in their tractors, with a charcoal filter  so they can't smell anything and a CD player so they can't hear anything, driving  up and down the [vine] rows, and they're not connecting to the land ... As a farmer,  I think that you need to be really sensitive to the land: to feel the soil, touch the  plants, take care and do things by hand. That's why we use basket presses as well.  You could do it just as well with mechanised techniques but to actually do it by  hand, to feel the grapes and work with them gently, you learn a lot more about what  you're doing. (Peter, 17 April 2012)1 If you're going to be a vigneron, growing those grapes and using them yourself  to make wine, I think it's really important to do things by hand. You have  a sense of achievement, but also that you are a part of the vineyard, that living  being out there ... I am definitely a part of this place, and it's a part of who I am.  (Mark, 25 June 2014) The region of McLaren Vale, lying about forty kilometres south of Adelaide, South  Australia, is home to around a hundred different wineries. These operate at very  different scales of production, from tiny one‐ or two‐person operations to large winery  and vineyard concerns owned by corporate agglomerations. This diversity of scale is  matched by a diversity in the techniques and attitudes towards winegrowing, from the  high‐tech, highly mechanised industrial production of large wineries to the avowedly  rustic, low‐tech, 'craft' or 'artisanal' approach taken by many small producers like  Peter and Mark.2 Such producers opt to manually prune and maintain their vines and  harvest their grapes, and utilise non‐mechanised processing techniques in the winery,  stirring ferments by hand and pressing the grape must in wooden slatted basket‐presses.  Important winemaking decisions are, for these artisanal producers, often guided by  senses of smell and taste rather than by laboratory analysis. In this chapter, based on fieldwork conducted in McLaren Vale from 2012 to  2014, I examine the way the sensorial, bodily engagement of such winegrowers with  1  The names used in this chapter are pseudonyms. 2  'Winegrowing' is an umbrella term used to encompass the processes of grape growing  (viticulture) and 'winemaking' (viniculture), particularly with reference to small‐scale,  hands on (so‐called 'artisanal') production. Many of my interlocutors, who are directly  involved with all aspects of wine production — from grape growing to harvesting,  fermentation, and bottling — consider themselves 'winegrowers' or 'vignerons'; others are  engaged with work primarily or solely in the vineyard or in the winery. Where necessary I  will specify. </page> <page sequence="3"> Emotions, Senses, Spaces | 177 the land, the vines, grapes and wines in their day‐to‐day tasks and activities forges and  reinforces powerful relational bonds between people, place and product. Outlining  the ways in which sensorial experiences may be linked to emotional attachments to  places and things, I show how the 'artisanal' production techniques employed by some  McLaren Vale winegrowers serve to invest certain places of wine production — and the  wine itself — with deep meanings and emotions. These connections allow us to view  wines, the places of their production and the people involved in their manufacture as  sharing a mutual essence born of their dynamic interrelationship. Wine and the love of place According to Ingold, the rhythmically interwoven activities of people working and  dwelling 'in the world' inhere in what he sees as a continuously becoming landscape  or 'taskscape' (Ingold 1993). In this chapter, I hope to show that dynamic landscapes  may also be seen to be teeming with complex currents and knots of emotion generated  through the ongoing sensorial interaction of people with the world. It is through the  sensing body's direct, lived experience of the world that spaces and places can become  imbued with specific feelings and emotional attachments and thus granted meaning:  'After all, our first and foremost, most immediate and intimately felt geography is  the body, the site of emotional experience and expression par excellence' (Davidson &amp;  Milligan 2004:523, italics in the original text). Heath and Meneley note that '[w]hat we eat and drink, and how we do so, indexes  both the corporeality of our habitus and the processes of distinction that embody  relations of power/knowledge' (2008:593). Wine is inescapably a cultural artefact,  mired (in the modern, Western‐inspired tradition, at least) in a world of complex  symbolic meanings, social and religious traditions, notions of cultural competency,  hierarchies of knowledge and class distinctions (see, for example, Bourdieu 2010). This  symbolic, cultural significance is not immaterial, however, and the sensually perceived  materiality of wine — its substance — is not to be overlooked. It is in the diverse  sensorial properties of wine upon consumption that much value is thought to be held:  the depth, complexity and deliciousness of aromas and flavours, viscosity, ability to  refresh or quench thirst, brightness of colour, and the ability to alter mood and mind.3  Wine thus appears to be an ideal location for an examination of interrelations between  the sensing body, emotions, and feelings of space and place. Wine critics, writers and  marketers are well aware of such circuits of connection, and popular wine discourse  is replete with language that, explicitly or implicitly, draws upon these associations.  Anthropomorphic metaphor is ubiquitous in wine description, with terms like 'body',  'backbone', 'flabby', and 'sinewy' pointing to an anatomical schema, and others, like  'brooding', 'sexy', 'boisterous', 'shy' and so on used to draw attention to the 'personality'  3  Here, wine not only is perceived sensually but itself also affects sensory perceptions. </page> <page sequence="4"> 178 | Emotions, Senses, Spaces of the wine (Suárez Toste 2007:58‐59). This is certainly the case in McLaren Vale, where  different personified characteristics are often attributed to particular wine varietals  — Grenache wines are 'rounded' and 'feminine', Shiraz 'brawny' and 'masculine',  Cabernet Sauvignon 'noble' and 'upstanding'. Wine writer Andrew Jefford argues that wine lends itself well to a perception of  anthropomorphism. In his view, wine is quietly unique in human experience: a creation in which human beings and  the natural world have almost equal roles; a creation which is experienced sensually,  intellectually and emotionally, and at its best has a spiritual force, too. (2012) Wine is neither fully a 'natural' nor a 'cultural' product, but bridges this abyss. It  is inextricably both, possessing temporalities and rhythms that render it familiar to  the mortal human experience and help us to conceive of it and relate to it in human  terms: it is born in fermentation, comes to maturity in the barrel, ages in the bottle  and finally dies. 'Part of the affection we feel for wine', according to Jefford (2012),  'is that it mimics our own trajectory towards non‐being'. As a living entity, affective  upon, and expressive of, human emotions and personalities, wine also embodies the  substance of the person. This is a connection frequently made in myth, where wine  is taken to correspond to blood and thus to life, light, fecundity and cyclical renewal.  It is symbolic of 'hidden life and triumphant, mysterious youth ... Blood re‐created  by the wine‐press is a sign of great victory over the anaemic flight of time' (Durand  1999:252). Wine, like blood (or as blood), is felt to be a powerful conduit of energies,  emotions and memories, and drinking is thus an act of communion with the life‐paths  of others. Places and landscapes are animated not only by movement and physical activity  but also by the meanings and memories that they come to embody. As Jones states,  '[l]ife is inherently spatial, and inherently emotional' (2007:205). As loci of belonging,  peace, loss, anxiety, love, and so on, we may see such places and landscapes as features of  what have been termed emotional geographies (Davidson &amp; Milligan 2004; Davidson,  Smith &amp; Bondi 2007). The emotional attachment to place that is borne from sensory  experience is neatly summed up by Tuan (1990) as topophilia, literally, the 'love of  place' — 'the affective bond between people and place or setting' (4). Topophilia is  used to describe a very broad category of emotion, from simple tactile and sensory  pleasures and aesthetic responses to far deeper connections: 'More permanent and less  easy to express are feelings that one has toward a place because it is home, the locus of  memories, and the means of gaining a livelihood' (93). In particular, Tuan holds that  there is a special sense of attachment felt by a farmer to their land, which relates directly  to the physicality of their work and the interweaving of their own life's trajectory with  that of their land, animals and crops: 'The farmer's topophilia is compounded of this  physical intimacy, of material dependence and the fact that the land is a repository of  memory and sustains hope' (97). </page> <page sequence="5"> Emotions, Senses, Spaces | 179 Such emotive, affective links not only position people and geographical places in  relation to one another, but may also encompass a broad range of animal, vegetable, or  other non‐human entities. Things may be said to have a social life, engaging with people  and other things along relational networks of movement, trade and so on (Appadurai  1988; Gell 1998), but they are also animated by emotions. Things, then, may come to  manifest deeply felt emotions in the same way that certain places do. In his discussion  of sheep farming in the Scottish Borders, Gray (1999; 2014) highlights the powerful  ways that the interwoven activities of farmers and their flocks in the harsh outbye  landscapes of the Borders serve to bind people, sheep and family farms together in such  a way that the three may be seen as consubstantial, as refractions of one another. The  'hefting' of flocks onto the land is a mutual act of emplacement; 'it is an intertwining  of lives that transforms the very being of sheep and people so that attachment to the  land is "in the blood" or as the people of Teviothead say, "bred into you"' (2014:2). In the sensorial/emotional interrelationship of winegrowers in McLaren Vale  with their worlds, we can see a similar consubstantiation at work. People, land, vines  and wines are felt to partake of the same 'essence of place' through the mutuality  of their interrelation and involvement in the cycles and processes of production.  Examining the significance of microbial communities to artisanal cheesemaking,  Paxson and Helmreich (2014) point out that even the 'wildest', most apparently  natural and autochthonous elements of such production — the yeasts, bacteria and  micro‐organisms that combine to add complexity to flavours — are inseparable from  human cultivation. 'In constituting the particular materiality of a cheese, nature and  culture are fully implicated in one another; neither may be said to ground the other'  (184). In McLaren Vale, grapevines, soil and rocks, and the various animal, vegetable  and microbial life forms of the vineyard similarly exist within a sphere of relational  influence, with people, place and product being both materially and emotionally  enmeshed. Hands‐on wine production Intense sensory‐emotional bonds become forged in the physical tasks of winegrowing  in McLaren Vale: from the planting and maintenance of vineyards, to the harvest  of grapes, to their fermentation and maturation as wine. This close engagement of  winegrowers with the 'material world' — and particularly those engaged in small‐scale,  hands‐on production — is a crucial element in their development of a sense of place  and terroir, concepts which hold great currency in contemporary wine discourse. For  many, such physical interaction with the vine, grapes and wine (hands‐on doing) is  crucial to the production of 'authentic' wine, where authenticity is said to relate to  a close and concerted interaction and working together of people and place (Goode  &amp; Harrop 2011). In this view, authentic wines and wine places are products of a  </page> <page sequence="6"> 180 | Emotions, Senses, Spaces sensuous, physical engagement of winegrowers with the material world in production,  as it is through this engaged relationship that places and products become imbued with  emotional depth and meaning beyond the objectively material. While there are in McLaren Vale a number of small‐scale winegrowers who use  'hands‐on' techniques in the vineyard and who perform all the tasks of the winery  themselves, the vast amount of wine is made in larger production facilities where this is  not the case. Nearly all of my informants acknowledged that it is economically necessary  for larger wineries seeking to manufacture large quantities of wine of consistent quality  to embrace more impersonal and high‐tech production techniques.4 Most, however  — including many of those employed in such large‐scale 'industrial' winemaking —  considered wine made at a small scale using manual production techniques to be more  real or authentic than that made by teams of workers at big, impersonal wineries.  This view aligns broadly with discourses of terroir, which value local specificities over  what is seen as the homogenising tendency of modern, mass‐produced winemaking.  Frequently, my interlocutors bemoaned the fact that most modern wine was made 'to  a recipe'. They often made a distinction between 'authentic' winemaking undertaken  by small producers and the industrial 'beverage manufacture' of many larger wineries.  Key to this distinction was the close, hands‐on engagement with land, vines and wines  across various phases of production, which the small‐scale winegrower was able to  maintain: Being hands‐on is really important, and I think it's something that is being lost  ... My wine is grown in that vineyard, and made right here in this shed. I planted  the vineyard with my father‐in‐law, and do the whole works myself — picking,  crushing, fermenting, bottling. I know I'm lucky to be able to do that. I couldn't  work for a big corporation just making wine as a product, as a beverage, according  to a recipe — that goes against everything that I love about wine. You have to  do it properly, have a feel for it and an awareness of what you're doing. (Mark,  22 August 2012) For the small winegrowers of McLaren Vale, the vineyards and wineries which  are formed by, and which frame, the quotidian activities of wine production — places  of deep sensual engagement with the world — are indeed important repositories of  memory and emotion, as I will discuss below. They are crucial features of McLaren  Vale's emotional geography as places of physical work and material interdependence  encompassing individual and socially shared memories and senses of belonging,  often tied to lines of descent across generations. In short, they are powerful centres  of human dwelling. 4  Common practices include the mechanisation of vineyard tasks like spraying, pruning and  harvesting; the measurement and chemical analysis of various properties of grapes and wine  throughout the processes of production; automated temperature control; and the addition  of cultured yeast strains, acids, tannins and other agents to the wine. </page> <page sequence="7"> Emotions, Senses, Spaces | 181 Knowing the vineyard Among winegrowers, the assertion is frequently made that 'good wine is made in the  vineyard'. If the grapes grown are of high quality, it is thought, the job of the vintner  in the winery becomes not to manufacture the wine through clever manipulation, but  rather to guide the wine through the processes of fermentation and maturation with  a light touch. As such, vineyard work becomes of crucial importance. In the words  of Ed, a contract viticulturist and consultant with a special interest in biodynamic  winegrowing5: A good farmer pays attention to what's going on in the vineyard, and has an  awareness of the big picture, how something might have an effect on something  else. It's about being flexible and responsive to everything that's happening. That  includes the bugs, funguses, the weeds that are sprouting up — it's all connected  in one way or another; nothing happens in isolation and you need to have an  awareness of the signs that the vineyard is giving you. (Ed, 2 August 2012) Winegrowers come to know their vineyards emotionally as well as intellectually,  as they, the vines, the land, and the other plants, animals and micro‐organisms become  relationally intertwined and interdependent. The interaction between person and  vineyard becomes one not of mastery but of dialogue, of the grower 'working together'  with the land across the changing seasons and annual vintage cycles in order for the  grapes that are produced to be of optimal quality.6 The seasons changing, winter and spring rains ... Every vintage is different. That  sort of variation is crucial. I'm not about trying to bring grapes up to a particular  'standard'; I rely on nature and therefore keeping the diversity of vintage is really  important. It's all about the flavour. (Dennis, 15 August 2012) Many producers harvest grapes according to a carefully measured balance of sugar  ripeness and acidity confirmed by chemical testing; others prefer to trust their own  palates and determine the time of harvest by taste: 'When the grape is sweet, but  the seeds are still crunchy and taste nutty, biscuity — that's when we'll pick' (Karen,  2 March 2014). The sense of smell is also important in the vineyard: as one vine pruner  told me, 'If you've got a good nose, you can smell if there's any mildew around' (Eric,  15 August 2012). 5  Biodynamics is a system of organic farming based on the esoteric philosophies of Rudolf  Steiner, and it is popular among many growers in in McLaren Vale. It treats agriculture as  a holistic integration of humans, plants, animals and 'cosmic and terrestrial forces', and  contains spiritual and mystical elements that could be viewed as rather more magical or  occult than strictly scientific (see, for example, Kirchmann 1994). 6  Here it must be pointed out that notions of 'quality' vary greatly between producers. There  is often some degree of 'reverse‐engineering' (Paxson 2010) to try to achieve a particular  style, such as undertaking particular canopy management practices with an aim towards  slower ripening and higher acid levels for a more savoury, 'French'‐style wine. The quality  of the grapes is in these cases judged in relation to the pre‐formed image. </page> <page sequence="8"> 182 | Emotions, Senses, Spaces Since antiquity, vineyards have in Western cultural traditions been potent symbols  of human civilisation and settlement, rootedness and belonging: a cultivation of the  wild. Like wines, vines are themselves also often anthropomorphised, with different  types of vine said to display different human characteristics. While, for example,  Grenache and Mataro are said to be hardy, pessimistic misers who can survive in  poor soils without much need for irrigation, an employee at one winery told me that  'Cabernet Sauvignon is the "princess" of the vines: it really spreads out its root system,  and likes very luxurious soil — thick and rich — and it doesn't mind moisture' (Fiona,  5 February 2013). The passing of the years also gives older vines, rooted in place, a  certain maturity. Young vines are often likened to unpredictable teenagers, while the  old vines are depicted as wise elders, treasured and respected in McLaren Vale for  the way they have borne witness to the ongoing passage of the seasons, longer‐term  oscillations in climate, and the ongoing march of human activity over their life spans.  Very old vines of a century or more still bear upon their gnarled trunks the scars  of generations of vine pruners, whose past decisions (to trellis in a certain way, to  snip off new growth in a particular fashion, to lop off certain limbs, and so on) still  influence the sensory qualities of the grapes that hang from each season's new canes.  Old vines are said to possess a stability and depth of character that young vines lack,  and, although the quantities of grapes they yield are often much smaller than the  quantities that vigorous young vines yield, the quality of the wine is usually thought  to be superior, with more intense, complex flavours and aromas. The vines themselves  also hold an emotive power beyond their productive capacity. They are repositories for  memories — of a long succession of vintages, of cold, wet and disease‐ridden years  and the hot, dusty years of drought — and are thus integral to both the physical and  emotional fabric of the landscape. Many growers placed great importance on ensuring that their grapes were as  reflective as possible of their distinctive 'terroir'. Although definitions of the term are  hotly contested, terroir is broadly understood as the unique sum of environmental  factors and conditions of production (usually both 'natural' and 'cultural') in a  particular place, influencing the flavour and other qualities of a wine and granting  it a particular 'sense of place' (see, for example, Bohmrich 1996; Demossier 2011;  Trubek 2008). Discussion of terroir usually focus on the way foods and wines 'of place'  can become endowed with a unique and significant distinctiveness, whether physically  'real' or imagined: an essence of place. The tasks and processes of wine production,  especially those undertaken by small‐scale producers (planting, pruning, harvesting,  crushing, pressing, and so on) may be said to facilitate, bring forth or unlock the wine's  terroir, which may be tasted upon consumption. Such wine, then, acts as a conduit  linking the drinker with the wine's place of origin, as well as with the lives of the people  who are involved in its production. </page> <page sequence="9"> Emotions, Senses, Spaces | 183 For small‐scale growers, vineyard work with an aim to the production of  high‐quality, unique or interesting wines often entails a very close and personal  relationship with the vineyard and a 'communication' of sorts with the vines. This  involves close and focused observation of the conditions and the 'signs that the  vineyard is giving you', an awareness stemming from accumulated knowledge and  familiarity. While growers usually describe this simply as 'good farming', such attention  also engenders an emotional link between person and the place of the vineyard. The  rhythm of familiar tasks and activities is comforting; the winegrower feels at home in  the vineyard. The exposure to the ever‐changing elements of the weather — the cold  winter rain, hot summer sun, the gully winds of the morning and the sea breezes of  the afternoon — is cherished by farmers, who contrast it to the inauthenticity of a  working life spent indoors. Some vignerons in McLaren Vale have spent their entire  lives tending the same land; for some, their land has been farmed by their family over  five or six generations and they know it 'like the back of their hand'. Such winegrowers  can, by smell and taste alone, immediately discern in which of their vineyard blocks  a particular bunch of grapes was grown. To those so attuned, the very particular soil,  geology and growing conditions of the site are rendered sensible in the fruit. Wisdom  sits in places (Basso 1996), and the occupation of the small‐scale farmer or winegrower  is perhaps best thought of as a mutual sharing in this emplaced wisdom through the  performance of their ordinary, everyday tasks. The vineyard, as an anchoring point for emplaced memories and knowledge,  may be embedded with deep feelings of belonging and loyalty, but may also act as a  reminder of past tensions and hardships: years of drought, disease‐ridden wet seasons,  and economic downturns. As winegrowers plant, manage and maintain their vines  with an eye to future cycles of weather, climate, culture and economy, the vineyard is  also a locus for hopes and aspirations, and anxieties and uncertainty about the times to  come.7 The main sense expressed by small winegrowers, however — as people who have  7  For vignerons in McLaren Vale, there are several common anxieties. These include the  vagaries of market, industry trends and government taxation regimes which may affect  their future ability to sell their wines profitably. Many of the growers I spoke to were  worried about the increasing buy‐up of vineyard land by foreign investors, particularly  Chinese companies looking for stakes in the South Australian wine industry. People also  frequently shared concerns about the ongoing financial sustainability of agricultural land  uses like winegrowing in a region under pressure from the sprawl of nearby suburban  areas. Another often‐expressed anxiety stemmed from the South Australian government's  apparent relaxation of biosecurity regulations that have to date preserved the State as one of  the few major wine‐producing areas worldwide to have escaped the ravages of the Phylloxera  vine root louse (Campbell 2004). With the pest having destroyed vineyards across Europe  and many 'new world' regions including other Australian states, forcing replanting onto  Phylloxera‐resistant North American rootstocks, South Australia's untouched old vines  and Phylloxera‐free status are a source of great pride among vignerons. </page> <page sequence="10"> 184 | Emotions, Senses, Spaces chosen to spend a good proportion of their lives engaging in the often solitary tasks  of the vineyard — was that it is primarily a place of positive emotions. The attentive  observation and focus required when dealing with this world of plants, weather, insects  and soils, and the repetitiveness of tasks like pruning, can bring about a meditative  state of mind: You can clear your mind of anything else you really don't need to be thinking about,  and concentrate on the task directly in front of you, because you're constantly  thinking about the next cut you're going to make, the next plant in front of you.  That just zones a lot of things out. (Mark, 25 June 2014) Many of my informants told me that they often looked forward to the time of  year when they could leave the majority of their winery tasks behind and get back into  the vineyard, to 'reconnect with the land' in a way that is peaceful and contemplative  yet — as it involves an interaction with the dynamic rhythms of the 'natural world' —  quietly energising. Fermenting emotions Wineries, where the harvested grapes are crushed and fermented into wine which  is then matured before bottling, may be marked with similarly deep contours and  currents of emotion. Such places are the locations of a powerful melding of the  focused energies of human labour (particularly during the heightened intensity of the  harvest and 'vintage' period) and of those of the wine itself in the microbial processes  of fermentation and maturation. For small winemakers, who can avoid many of the  technological and chemical interventions that become necessary in large‐scale wine  production, their wineries are not mere 'factories' for beverage manufacture which  seek a mastery of nature and replication of results. Instead, these wineries are better  thought of as places of artisanship, wherein the skilled processing of the grapes and wine  (hand‐plunging a ferment, pressing new wine off skins, 'racking' wine between barrels,  and so on) requires a deep perceptual engagement with the tasks. Here, winemakers  take into account, and work with, the physical properties of their materials in response  to dynamic environmental conditions.8 The engagement of winemakers with their work in the winery is genuinely  multisensory. Response to visual cues is crucial, as the practitioner keeps an eye on the  activity of the bubbling ferment and carefully observes changes in the brightness of  colour of wine maturing in barrels. But other senses are just as important. 'Hands‐on'  8  As Ingold notes, even processes that require a high degree of mechanisation (bottling  being the most obvious example in the winery) require such skilled human attention, a  'conjunction of rhythmicity and concentration' (2011:61). The fleshly, living practitioner  is not separated from these machines but 'is among them, working with machines that work  with him' (62, italics in the original text). </page> <page sequence="11"> Emotions, Senses, Spaces | 185 winemaking techniques are just that: during primary fermentation, as yeasts convert  the sugars in the grape must to alcohol and carbon dioxide, the vintner must ensure  that the 'cap' of grape skins carried to the surface of the ferment by the gas does not  dry out, as this risks bacterial infection and undesirable flavours. This may be done  in various ways (for example, by using an electric pump), but many small producers  prefer to manually push the cap down and stir the ferment using implements like  rakes, paddles, or — if the fermentation vessel is small enough — bare arms and hands.  The energy created by microbial action during fermentation gives off significant heat,  and although thermometers are usually used to monitor temperature, winemakers will  often also use their own hands to stir the ferment and feel the warmth of the must in  different parts of the vessel. The tangible warmth of the must as it is transformed into  wine is significant as yet another way in which the liquid may be thought of as a living  entity, a vital, blood‐like substance that carries the weight of human emotions. One of  my informants told me that she likes to think of the winery as a 'nursery' where wines,  like human babies, grow and mature before being turned out into the world: 'I don't  really like thinking of myself as a winemaker. More of a babysitter, looking after the  wine while it does its thing' (Margie, 5 April 2012). To walk into a winery is to walk into a rich world of olfactory stimulation. The  microbial and chemical world of winemaking is one of smells, ranging from the fresh,  sweet, sticky smells of a new ferment to the dark, earthy, musty aromas of red wine  maturing in oak barrels in the cellar. The sense of smell can have a very direct link to  emotions and memories: it is a sense that may, bypassing conscious thought, immediately  conjure up a suite of linked sensory experiences, evoking 'vivid, emotionally‐charged  memories of past events and scenes' (Tuan 1990:10). The recollection of past odours  and the emotional transportation which the experience of winery smells can bring on is  significant. For most of my interlocutors, the smells of the winery and the barrel room  were generally seen as pleasant, comforting and familiar. Some, moreover, described  very specific, emotion‐laden smell‐memories. For Dennis, smelling a particular barrel  of maturing Cabernet Sauvignon while working as a cellarhand at the age of fifteen  was a moment of epiphany — although he was not yet a wine drinker at that stage, the  unearthly aroma that he encountered sparked an interest in wine which was to become  a lifelong vocation: There was a puncheon of wine at the back of the barrel room, in the dark — it was  Cabernet Sauvignon —[and] I took the bung out and the smell just hit me. I'll  never forget it. I can still smell that wine right now, sitting here. And that set me on  this course, on this journey. (Dennis, 15 August 2012) More than simply experiencing the smells of the winery, the winemaker must  pay close attention to them, as the particular aromas transmit important information  about the state of the wine much more immediately — and accurately, in the opinion  of some — than laboratory chemical analysis can provide. People sensually attuned  </page> <page sequence="12"> 186 | Emotions, Senses, Spaces to the material processes of winemaking may identify potentially unwelcome odours,  such as those associated with certain chemical compounds (like hydrogen sulphide or  ethyl acetate) or microbial organisms (like the brettanomyces yeast or various spoilage  bacteria) at very low levels. Taste, also, is critical for the winemaker, as it conveys important information  about the state and qualities of the wine at different stages of production. Vintners will  taste their wine frequently throughout the processes of fermentation and maturation:  such practice brings about a deep familiarity with the wine, which both enables them  to quickly identify any potential problems and shapes their ongoing methods. A  familiarity with certain parcels of grapes from certain vineyards over numerous vintages  furthermore enables producers to gradually develop their own 'styles'; for many, this  evolution over time of a relationship between winemaker(s) and vineyard is a key  element of terroir. The 'cellar palate' of artisanal winemakers attuned to the specific  conditions of their own winery is not always regarded in a positive light, however,  as winemakers' senses of smell and taste may become conditioned to the presence of  particular yeasts or bacteria that produce flavours and odours which other tasters might  regard as undesirable. Nevertheless, the diversity of winemaking styles among artisan  producers (compared to the 'homogenising' tendencies of mass production) forms a  large part of these wines' consumer appeal: handmade wines with 'individuality' and  'uniqueness' are often celebrated and valorised within the world of wine critics and  consumers. The sensations of smell and taste are fleeting and ephemeral, yet memories of  them may be powerfully present and emotionally charged. For winegrowers, part of the  pleasure of their work comes from chasing and attempting to recapture certain elusive  sensorial experiences, like the Cabernet Sauvignon barrel in the cellar of Dennis's  youth. As we can see, these people are simultaneously producers and consumers,  continually reacting to, and reflecting upon, their interactions with the wine, modifying  and adjusting their actions in order to bring their wine and themselves into closer  alignment. This is truly working with the wine rather than acting upon it. West notes  with respect to artisanal cheesemakers that '[w]orking with the curd, they learned from  the curd itself' (2013:332); further, craft winemakers similarly learn from the actions  of the wine 'as it move[s] through time and space, doing one thing or another' (332,  italics in the original text). In some cases, this learning is completely accidental, as in  the case of a barrel of Chardonnay that Mark neglected during his busy 2006 vintage: At the end of vintage I thought, 'Let's have a look at that stuff'. There was a lot of  airspace in the barrel, and the wine had grown this flor [a layer of yeast cells on top  of the wine] which was sort of protecting the wine from the air. It looked weird, but  it wasn't totally oxidised and stuffed. It had an interest to it, a nutty character. It's  very sherry‐like, like a Fino. Now it's holding itself in this state: from '06 to 2014,  </page> <page sequence="13"> Emotions, Senses, Spaces | 187 it hasn't changed much at all. It's got more complexity: there's a little bit more in  the mouth, more flavour and character. (Mark, 25 June 2014) A frequently heard maxim among artisanal winegrowers is to 'trust your senses'.  For skilled practitioners, trusting and giving priority to the human senses and to instincts  developed over years of attentive engagement with the processes of winemaking rids  them of what they see as the artificial constraints of production 'by numbers' or 'to  a recipe'. Some of the best wines, as several producers told me, come from happy  accidents or creative experimentation. While many of these winegrowers have formal  qualifications in oenology, agricultural science or other disciplines, they usually view  large‐scale winemaking as restrictively scientistic — a form of manufacture further  removed from the primacy of sense‐experience than that undertaken by the artisan.  For the artisanal producer, improvisation is not only accepted but also necessary in  order for the processual relationship between human and liquid to run smoothly. The  skill of practitioners, as Ingold puts it, lies not in their ability to impose onto matter a  preconceived form, but rather 'in their ability to find the grain of the world's becoming  and to follow its course while bending it to their evolving purpose' (2011:211).  Through the senses, wine and person work together. By smelling, tasting and drinking  wine, artisanal winegrowers bring its substance into themselves, literally embodying it.  In such a process, there is a feeling that the wine also comes to embody the person of the  winegrower who has poured some of his or her own 'heart and soul' or 'blood, sweat  and tears' into the production of the wine. This is a relational view that fits well with  theories of terroir, which claim that wine embodies an essence of place. To adopt Gray's  (1999; 2014) terminology, such a view sees the wines, people and places of artisanal  production as consubstantial. The emotional topography of the winery itself is varied, as different spaces may  become imbued with different flows of emotion. In most wineries, for example, the  areas where grapes are crushed into large primary fermentation vessels are seen as  places of energy and liveliness. This is where all the action takes place during the hectic  vintage period. Winemakers must perform numerous tasks very quickly as various  parcels of harvested grapes arrive for crushing; juice is pumped between storage vessels;  fermentation times and temperatures are monitored and adjusted; and decisions are  made as to when each batch will be pressed and skins removed. Vintage work is long,  busy and tiring, but it is also an intensely social time of year, as people throughout the  region pitch in together to help one another. The wine itself is highly vigorous during  the initial ferment, and the melange of smells and sounds coming from the bubbling  vats adds to the general ambience of activity and energy. In contrast to the noise and activity of the fermentation room, informants Peter  and Sophie see the barrel room of their family winery as a contemplative place: quiet,  dark and cool, and filled with the close and heavy smell of maturing wine. There is a  </page> <page sequence="14"> 188 | Emotions, Senses, Spaces sense of silence and the stillness of deep repose: the wines are quietly alive, and indeed  Peter tells me that he often listens to the subtle, almost inaudible crackling sounds of  malolactic fermentation, as bacteria slowly convert malic acid into the smoother lactic  acid. The cellar of a house, according to Bachelard, 'is first and foremost the dark entity  of the house, the one that partakes of subterranean forces' (1964:18, italics in the  original text). It is a place of deeply hidden dreams and memories. This description  might also be applied to the cellars of a winery, where barrels of wine solemnly slumber  for months or years, biding time before bottling begins. In older wineries, the cellar  is literally an underground chamber: a cave or tunnel carved from the rock, where the  wines may quietly mature in the dark, cool subterranean air. For most newer wineries  in McLaren Vale, a devoted 'barrel room' is more likely to be simply a well‐insulated  shed or other storage space; or, alternatively, the maturing wines are stored in the same  room in which primary fermentations take place. Nevertheless, there is a feeling that  such places, where the wine 'rests' and matures, are connected to slower, deeper and  more grounded rhythms than are the energetic places of primary fermentation. Conclusion In the skilled performance of their tasks, winegrowers in McLaren Vale engage  intimately with the world around them at a sensorial level — including touching  the soil and the vines, feeling the sun, wind and rain in the vineyard, smelling and  feeling the warmth of the fermenting grapes, and tasting the wine at different stages  of its production. It is this sort of deep and attentive engagement of people with their  environmental surrounds over time which produces not only practical and intellectual  'knowledge' but also a rich topography of feelings and emotions of belonging, love,  loss, nostalgia, tranquillity and struggle. The emotional depth fostered by the hands‐on  tasks and activities and direct sensorial experiences of small‐scale wine production is,  I believe, an important aspect of the ontological perspective shared by many of my  interlocutors, which sees people, land, vines, and wines as fundamentally interrelated  and codependent, partaking of and manifesting a sort of shared essence. The mutual  engagement of people and 'nature' in this production means that a wine may be said  to embody both the intent, love and care of the winegrowers, and the ineffable 'sense  of place' of the particular vineyard from which it originated. Similarly, a vineyard  or winery may be seen to be indivisible from the unique and specific wines it has  produced and the people who farm it, especially in cases where several generations of  the same family have worked the same land. For winegrowers, the vineyards and wineries into which they pour so much of  their time, labour and attention may lie at the very centre of their emotional lives,  shaping their ongoing experiences of the world. They are places of activity and  excitement, of peace and refuge; over time, they can become places of dwelling. This  </page> <page sequence="15"> Emotions, Senses, Spaces | 189 sort of intense emotional connection to places, forged through particular sensual  experiences and interactions and embedded deep in the psyche, is by no means limited  to winegrowers or farmers. However, these relationships are given material form by  such people, whose products spring directly from their concerted physical, intellectual  and emotional interactions with the soil, vines, grapes, presses, vats and barrels of their  places of production. The wine itself is seen to be embedded not only with the physical  traces of the geographic location — as a result of the particular geology, rainfall, aspect,  micro‐climate and so on of the vineyard — but also with the emotional rhythms and  currents which give it its life and vitality, its unique value and depth of meaning. Processes of production can serve to imbue material objects with a sort of agency,  enmeshing them in relational networks with the people who produce and consume  them (Appadurai 1988; Gell 1998). Their interactions with humans in the processes  of production, circulation and consumption work in some cases to animate these  items, granting them social meaning and thus de‐objectifying them. However, these  things are not just agents of action, but rather come to embody feelings, emotions  and memories. In wine, as in art and elsewhere, the valorisation of the handmade,  unique product of a skilled practitioner — more special and more valuable than the  mechanically reproduced version identical in every other respect — demonstrates just  such an animic, relational perspective. For wine, this perspective is made explicit by  the commonly expressed belief in terroir, which emphasises not only the relational and  substantial links between people and product but also, perhaps even more significantly,  with place. Consumers are brought into this relational meshwork with the wine as  participants themselves, linked to the world of production through the physical  incorporation brought about by smelling, tasting and drinking the wine. This processes of consubstantiation that lie at the heart of artisanal winegrowing in  McLaren Vale involve the sharing of a physical essence: the specific tastes and smells of  a vineyard and winery coaxed 'out of the land and into the bottle' (Sternsdorff‐Cisterna  2013:53) by human efforts and action. But there is also a deep emotional resonance  at play. The tasks and activities of dwelling in the world invest places and landscapes  with currents of emotion and meaning, and it is through the committed and personal  engagement of artisanal producers with their worlds that these emotions come to  reverberate throughout the places and products with which they are intimately  connected. Emotions are not disembodied: in McLaren Vale they may find a home in  vineyards, fermenting vats and oak barrels, and in other, more portable and comestible  places: the bottles of wine that flow from the wineries of the district to shelves and  cellars all over the world. </page> <page sequence="16"> 190 | Emotions, Senses, Spaces References  Appadurai, A. 1988.
