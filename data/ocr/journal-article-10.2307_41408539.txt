Price £18.95. Recently, much has been written about the origins of religion. Some have speculated that God is simply an infectious idea, mind-virus or 'meme', which uses human brains to replicate itself. Evolutionary psychologists disagree and are assiduously searching for the adaptive function(s) of religion and religious ideas. Some of them speculate that religion is the result of group selection; others insist that it is adaptive for individuals to be religious. Indeed, there is a body of research that indicates that believers often have more children than nonbelievers. In the long-run this could even lead to a religious revival, some warn. At any rate, the fact that religion is almost a universal, and that it keeps 'coming back', indicates that it is not simply a cultural oddity, but that it is somehow deeply entrenched in human nature. In this new work by David Lewis-Williams, evolutionary psychology is hardly mentioned. According to Lewis-Williams, religion results from a misinterpretation of certain experiences generated by our nervous system. Consciousness is not a single state, but a spectrum of states between being unconscious, waking and hallucinating. From a naïve realistic perspective, these series of states (including altered states) of consciousness seem to prove that there are other realms of reality beyond the ordered world of everyday experience. Near-death experiences suggest that there is another world 'beyond' or 'beneath' the tunnel or vortex that is seen or experienced. The experience of flight, which sometimes occurs in dreams and in trance, seems to indicate a world 'above' everyday reality. As a result of these experiences, which are simply a by-product of the way in which our nervous system is constructed, almost all cultures believe in a three-tiered cosmos. Religion thus does not originate as an attempt to explain the ordinary world, but as an attempt to explain these extraordinary experiences. In principle, science should be able to replace religion if we can accept that religion results from a wrong interpretation of these experiences. The scientific analysis of the origins of religion is, however, only one of the two objectives of this book: the other is the criticism of religion and its present-day proponents. According to Lewis-Williams, religion becomes a negative force at the moment when some people not only try to explain their extraordinary experiences using religion, but also when they start using these experiences to claim extraordinary authority based on 'the truths' that are 'revealed' to them. The world 'beyond' can then be used as the legitimisation of any claim, dogma or rule. According to Lewis- Williams this side of religion is fundamentally at odds with a democratic, rationally organised society. Lewis-Williams acknowledges the fact that religion can help to bind a society, but he asserts that it does so by excluding or even demonising other religions. Thus, the morality promoted by religion is saturated with a 'them-and-us' antagonism and can easily capsise into aggression. When it does, religious leaders often apply a double standard of morality for 'in' and 'out' groups. Thus the command 'Thou shall not kill', which was 'revealed' to Moses originally applied only to the Israelites and therefore permitted the genocide of the Midianites. Personally, I feel that history proves that dictators do not always need religion to send people into wars. A 'them- versus-us' mentality can also arise in secular circles. Addi- tionally, at least some moral principles with a universal value have originally been proposed and spread by religious leaders. Although Lewis-Williams provides impressive examples, religion need not always be the province of dangerous fanatics and petty obscurantists. Additionally, denouncing religion from a scientific point of view can easily lead to another variation on the 'them-and-us' theme. A separation of religious, political and scientific institutions seems to me the best way to ensure freedom in a modern society. Further, it seems wise to me to abstain from trying to convert everyone to naturalism and to accept religion as a part of human nature. Lewis-Williams's analysis could have profited from a more serious consideration of this last idea. Maybe he is right that religion originally arose as a result of simply interpreting altered states of consciousness, but these experiences may have subsequently played a role in evolution at the moment that they endowed extraordinary power to those who experienced them. The spectrum of experiences, which Lewis-Williams writes about, may have become a target of selection. Apart from that, many properties of the gods do clearly result from the laws of direct and indirect reciprocal altruism, as described by Trivers (1985) and Alexander (1987). Humans have a unique capacity to empathise and to recognise the attention and inten- tions of other minds, often leading to anthropomorphism and to conceiving the world in social terms (Bering 2010). Thus, people try to change the world by mollifying the gods. Leaders may manipulate followers by passing on 'divine commands'. Gods often seem virtual 'dominant personalities' created to enforce cooperation in a society too big to be bound together only by kinship relationships. Some researchers even claim that moralising gods are characteristic of relatively large, structured societies (Roes &amp; Raymond 2002). The universal three-tiered structure of the religious universe could partially arise as a result of the position of the ego between 'es' and 'superego' that arises as a result of the tensions in which children grow up, at least according to Trivers (1985: 163). Thus, the fact that extraordinary experiences, like halluci- nations and visions, sometimes give extraordinary power could in principle mean that they are not purely pathological from an evolutionary point of view. In their work on evolution- ary psychiatry, Stevens and Price (1996) see hallucinations as a characteristic of a schizophrenic personality, which they try to explain within the context of their 'group-splitting hypothesis'. Schizotypical leaders often derive their charisma and authority from delusions and visions and their talent to share their 'enthusiasm' with others (etymologically enthusiasm refers to a god). Their often polygamous traits can lead to a reproductive success that makes these traits stable in evolutionary terms. Studies show that group cohesion in some cults can be directly</page><page sequence="2">96 South African Archaeological Bulletin 66 (193): 93-101, 2011 proportional to the weirdness of their beliefs: indeed, these define the believers as the initiates and elect compared to the out-group' . These evolutionary psychiatric arguments could lend further support to the parts of Lewis-Williams' argument in which he warns of the dangerous aspects of religious cults, religious charisma and blind devotion. At the same time, Lewis-Williams offers a kind of null- hypothesis to all these evolutionary models. His book is inter- esting, because he places the origin of religion within the framework of the age-old debate between religion and science. The scope of his analysis of religion is particularly broad, show- ing that prehistoric religion and the religion of the San can illuminate Western religions and vice versa. All this makes his work of great value for students of archaeology, history, philos- ophy and religion. References Alexander, R. 1987. The Biology of Moral Systems. New York: Aldine de Gruyter.
