<plain_text><page sequence="1">133 Exploring the " Life Territory:" Ecology and Ecocriticism in Appalachia By Fred Waage I. Environment and Appalachia: A Personal Confluence In the late 1940s and early 1950s my elementary school in upstate New York held a "Flanders Fair." As a kid, I felt then, I guess, like a privileged outsider. The pennies and nickels we spent on cupcakes and ringtosses went to buy shoes for the poor, barefoot, hookwormed children of Flanders in Appa"lay"chun Kentucky - whom we pitied from above. I could not foresee then, obviously, that the Appalachian Regional Commission would decide that my New York State hometown was as much a part of "Appalachia" as was Flanders, Kentucky; or that I would end up parenting children whose own hometown was in the "heart" of Appalachia, not that far from Flanders, in the (then) Mysterious South. Among many events in the time between these two Appalachian encounters, I found myself, in 1974, on the staff of Friends of the Earth, the environmental organization founded by that "demonic conservationist" (Margolis 1970, 150) David Brower, after his contentious expulsion from leadership of the Sierra Club. In the previous decade, Appalachia had been politically "discovered" through such endeavors as the 1960 presidential campaign, the "War on Poverty," and powerful socioenvironmental writings of the Silent Spring period, such as Robert Coles's Children of Crisis, Harry Caudill's Night Comes to the Cumberlands, and Michael Harrington's The Other America. Harrington, in fact, used Appalachia as a symbolic locus for human poverty amid nature's ironic richness: "... everything that turns the landscape into an idyl for the urban traveler conspires to hold the people down. They suffer terribly at the hands of beauty" (Harrington 1962, 44). These works were eloquent and instrumental revelations of human vulnerability to environmental conditions and environmental destruction. Their influence was great on subsequent environmental policies and events: the Wilderness Act, the first Earth Day, creation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Clean Water and Air Acts, the Endangered Species Act. But simultaneously and more locally, Appalachian self-awareness was growing. In 1970 Berea College founded its Appalachian Center. Gurney Norman's fictional Divine Right joined me in 1960's California, but tendentiously returned home to Appalachia through the pages of The Last Fred Waage is a professor of English at East Tennessee State University. He is currently writing a literary biography of George R. Stewart and is coeditor of the forthcoming Teaching North American Environmental Literature, the second edition of his Teaching Environmental Literature (1985).</page><page sequence="2">134 Journal of Appalachian Studies Volume 11 Numbers 1 &amp; 2 Whole Earth Catalog (1971). Appalachian-born ecoactivist Edward Abbey wrote his "Natural and Human History" in Eliot Porter's Appalachian Wilderness : The Great Smoky Mountains (1970). Harry Caudill wrote the book's despairing Epilogue: "The prospect for Appalachia is sinister. It is already the nation's prime ecological disaster area" (Caudill 1970, 108). In 1973, Leo Marx emphasized what he saw as a "striking convergence" of literature and ecology (Marx 1973, 91). "Our literature contains a deep intuition of the gathering environmental crisis and its causes" (Caudill 1970, 102). Shortly before the impeachment of EPA founder Richard Nixon, I, with my Friends of the Earth brochures, buttons, and bumper stickers, was sharing a tent at a Mills College outdoor fair with a Pakistani rug merchant. He was selling lots of rugs, stealthily encroaching them upon my wilderness of free undistributed brochures. At that epiphanic moment I began to wonder why people would buy expensive rugs and spurn free nature preservation literature. E. N. Anderson says that religions can sell their moral codes better than ecologists can their environmental ethics because they embed their moral merchandise "in an emotionally compelling communal system of symbols and ceremonies" (Anderson 1996, 162). So my thought was that since ecological consciousness (and action) were closer to religion than to floorcovering, how could ecology be made more "emotionally compelling"? So, while Jack Higgs and Ambrose Manning were editing the first comprehensive collection of Appalachian writing, Voices from the Hills (1975), I, back North, was more humbly self-editing and publishing a small magazine which I called Second Growth: Literature of Environmental Concern . As I recall it, my goal was to present environmental awareness in the "emotionally compelling" mode of affective writing. The first editorial for Second Growth claimed that "a new focus on man's [sic] relation to the natural world is investing American poetry and fiction." The magazine's goal was "to find expression for the common, deeply pre- verbal sense of interdependence of man [sic] and all other created beings. ..." The editor pretentiously proclaimed that "An 'ecological' art will not just smell good, it will also convey awareness that we are breathing, how at every moment we are clinging to a cliff of life, in just living" (Waage 1975, 2) - whatever that meant. I was too poor to distribute the magazine, and its contents - despite generous submissions from some distinguished poets and fictioneers - were hardly up to making environmentalism very "emotionally compelling." Gary Snyder wrote me that it seemed like its name: "stuff coming up all over, no pattern or 'bones'" (Snyder 1976). However, the impulse behind it caught the wave. It was at this time that the first explicitly "ecocritical" text, seeking to perceive literary art in an ecological context, was published -</page><page sequence="3">Rethinking Appalachian Studies Series 135 Joseph Meeker's The Comedy of Survival : Studies in Literary Ecology (1974). Then, in 1978, William Rueckert first used the term "ecocriticism" in a now-famous essay, "Literature and Ecology: An Experiment in Ecocriticism." By the end of 1978, the Love Canal affair had vitalized a proactive environmental movement nationwide, and the Appalachian Studies Conference ("Association" as of 1986) had been founded, the first Appalachian Studies Conference meeting had been held, and I had organized the first Modern Language Association Convention session on environmental literature (1976). After becoming, geographically, a Tennessean, in 1978, 1 got the new Institute for Appalachian Affairs at East Tennessee State University to sponsor, as its semi-official publication, a revived and regionalized version of Second Growth, with a new subtitle: Appalachian Nature and Culture . Its sole (!) issue's editorial proclaimed: The illusion that we are exempt from dependency on a particular space and its finite possibilities is easier to sustain in some places than in others. On land laboriously invested, where families and communities are deeply rooted, human culture and physical space are deeply entwined. . . . The Appalachian mountains, and their outlying land . . . have been such a space. But, as they are geographically a watershed, so are they culturally, and human communities have been flowing away from them, or resisting the flow and standing fast, in ways deeply significant to our whole nation's preservation of its nature and cultures. (Waage 1979, 2) Clearly, despite his still-pretentious rhetoric, the editor had overcome his Flanders Fair mentality. During the 1980s, the realms of Appalachian studies and of ecocriticism expanded, the former more rapidly than the latter. The Appalachian Writers' Association was founded at East Tennessee State University in 1983. In 1984, Second Growth was again reincarnated, this time as Now and Then : Appalachian Nature and Culture, again sponsored and funded by the Institute, now renamed the Center for Appalachian Studies and Services. By 1989, the pedagogical and research components of Appalachian studies were flourishing. In that year the Journal of the Appalachian Studies Association was initiated, and at a famous meeting of the Western Literature Association, Cheryll Glotfelty and Glen Love "not only revived the term [ecocriticism] but urged its adoption to refer to the diffuse critical field that heretofore had been known as 'the study of nature writing'" (Branch 1995). In 1985 the Modern Language Association published my edited volume Teaching</page><page sequence="4">136 Journal of Appalachian Studies Volume 11 Numbers 1&amp;2 Environmental Literature : Materials , Methods , Resources , in its Options in Teaching series. As with Appalachian studies in the 1970s, the 1990s saw a flourishing and diversification of "ecocriticism," particularly with the founding of the Association for the Study of Literature and Environment (ASLE), of scholarly periodicals such as Environmental Ethics and Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment , and of wide-circulation literary- oriented magazines such as Orion . In the mid-1990s, both ecocriticism and Appalachian studies were crowned with "canonical" collections. Cheryll Glotfelty' s and Harold Fromm' s The Ecocriticism Reader : Landmarks in Literary Ecology (1995) was followed by a greatly expanded second edition of Voices from the Hills , the two-volume Appalachia Inside Out, edited by Higgs, Manning, and Jim Wayne Miller (1996). These volumes are notable not just for the coverage of their subjects but also for the implicit and explicit debates in which their contributors engage over the definitions of ecocriticism and Appalachia. In the next section of this essay, I will move from the historical to the theoretical connections between the two, by examining four major groups of theoretical questions surrounding ecocriticism, and ways in which responses to them tie in with Appalachian studies. II. Ecology and Ecocriticism: Identities in Flux Although in The Ecocriticism Reader , Cheryll Glotfelty provides a simple, and presumably authoritative, definition of ecocriticism - "the study of the relationship between literature and the physical environment" (Glotfelty and Fromm 1995, xviii ) - it actually shares with Appalachian studies a history of definitional ambiguity and diversity. Both are encompassing and multidisciplinary. The region and the critical approach are also linked by "boundary issues": what (content, terrain) is "within" and what is "without"? A third commonality is the locus of the definer/ practitioner. Does an ecocritic have a particular ideology? Do you have to be an ecocritic to practice ecocriticism? Do you have to be an Appalachian native to interpret Appalachia authoritatively? Or does an outdweller have a more unbiased perspective? These similarities suggest that surveying the definitional history of ecocriticism will help to orient the reader to its possible uses as an interpretive method for Appalachian studies. Rueckert's founding essay (referred to above) is a useful initiating text in this endeavor. He says, "I am not just interested in transferring ecological concepts to the study of literature, but in attempting to see literature inside the context of an ecological vision" (Rueckert 1995, 115). This distinction between concept and vision is analogous to that between</page><page sequence="5">Rethinking Appalachian Studies Series 137 defining the Appalachian region by tangible attributes (e.g., topography, biota, human economy) or by a less tangible "spirit of place," reflected in natural and cultural atmospherics, and subjective impressions. Rueckert's formulation also provided fertile ground for a proliferation of questions about ecocritical theory, posed since the late 1970s. It allowed a proliferation of "approaches and subjects" to evolve under the ecocriticism rubric. Glen Love well-summarizes many of them: What is emerging [in the "present state of this movement"] is a multiplicity of approaches and subjects, including - under the big tent of environmental literature - nature writing, deep ecology, the ecology of cities, ecofeminism, the literature of toxicity, environmental justice, bioregionalism, the lives of animals, the revaluation of place, interdisciplinarity, eco-theory, the expansion of the canon to include previously unheard voices, and the reinterpretation of canonical works from the past. (2003, 5) This diversity of ecocritical approaches is well-suited to the many areas of concern to students of Appalachian nature and culture. Returning to Rueckert's text of convenience (1995), it can be exfoliated into at least four areas of theoretical questioning about the nature of the ecocritical project. These questions are answered differently by different practitioners of ecocriticism, and the differing answers provide theoretical sanctioning for the different approaches under the ecocritical tent. Since the relevance of ecocriticism to Appalachian studies hinges to a great extent on this diversity, I will briefly discuss each set of questions. 1) Should or should not ecocriticism involve transferring ecological concepts to literature? More generally, what, if any, scientific knowledge should the ecocritic possess and apply to his/her analysis of a subject? How scientific is "ecology" itself? How widely accepted are ecology's defining concepts and the practices on which they are based? 2) Is literature - in all its forms - the sole subject of ecocritical study, or can an ecocritic be concerned, for example, with architecture, with plastic art, with objects of material culture? If literature is the subject, what is literature, in ecocritical terms: any verbal creation, oral or written? only those with an overt ethical purpose? 3) What is an "ecological vision?" Does it refer to a value-system derived from scientific ecological concepts, but existing in the realm of belief - spiritual, ethical, political? Does it imply that an ecocritic must be an environmental/si in some way, an advocate for particular views? Can</page><page sequence="6">138 Journal of Appalachian Studies Volume 11 Numbers 1&amp;2 an ecocritic, for example, write meaningfully about "wilderness literature" if he/ she strongly favors clear-cutting and logging in national forests? 4) Is ecocriticism by definition a contradiction in terms (as maintained by "cultural constructionists"), since it treats human constructs (literature, scientific theory, "nature,") as though they were autonomous entities, unshaped by human consciousness (analogous to "the myth of the wilderness as 'virgin/ uninhabited land" [Cronon 1996, 79])? Or does it, unlike other modes of interpretation, reject the false premise that the human critic is autonomous, recognizing that even the cultural constructionist viewpoint is "necessarily the product of a brain and a physiology that have evolved in close relationship to nature" (Love 2003, 8). Anyone who joins the growing movement toward ecocriticism in Appalachian studies will find relevance in these questions, approaches, and some of the general ways they have been responded to by other practitioners in the field. In discussing them I assume that they are creatively unresolved, and certainly unresolvable by me. In terms of the first issue, the scientific basis of ecology and hence of criticism based on it, Dana Phillips writes that "ecocritics have tended to ignore the recent history of ecology," and appeal to its "scientific authority," when actually its "representation of nature" is still in flux (Phillips 1999, 580). But David Cox has traced the definition of a central ecological model, "ecosystem," "the fundamental ecological unit" from its first use in 1935 through a sequence of changing definitions up to 1991, where it has become "the idea of unity between [the] (biological or living) entity and its environment" (Cox 2003, 2, 12). A commonplace of ecological theory, the development of an ecosystem toward a stable "climax community," persists despite fifty years of (scientifically based) demonstration of ecosystemic instability (Cronon 1996, 24). Since many such conceptual models of ecology used by ecocritics to interpret texts are themselves unstable and subject to revision, it is argued that interpretive conclusions derived from the assumption of their fixity must lack credibility. One response to this viewpoint is that of coevolving disciplines, as characterized by William Howarth: We know nature through images and words, a process that makes the question of truth in science or literature inescapable, and whether we find validity through data or metaphor, the two modes of analysis are parallel. Ecocriticism observes in nature and culture the ubiquity of signs, indicators of value that shape form and meaning. Ecology leads us to recognize that life speaks, communing through encoded streams of information that have</page><page sequence="7">Rethinking Appalachian Studies Series 139 direction and purpose, if we learn to translate the messages with fidelity. (1999, 77) Howarth's concept of "signs" as a unifier of data and metaphor, observed nature and cultural creation, seems to me to allow ecocriticism to employ scientific concepts, and to revise its formulations as the latter are revised. True ecocriticism can then be experienced not as "a" system, but as a collection of many interlinked yet different ways of understanding what the signs are signifying. Such a collaborative enterprise involving a collaborative coevolution of scientific and humanistic understanding is characterized by Wendell Berry through his collaboration with plant geneticist and environmentalist Wes Jackson: In ways sometimes different and sometimes the same, we have been at work on the same problem Because good land use involves both science and art (knowing and doing) and cannot be understood or practiced as either alone, we have had no illusions about the self-sufficiency or the adequacy of either of our disciplines. Our conversation has been between two parts of an always uncompleted whole. (Berry 2000,126) The second set of questions, concerning "literature," which are the most central to Appalachian studies, I am going to defer to the end. The third, arising from Rueckert's phrase "ecological vision" (1995, 115) has a large consensual, (although phrased in different ways), response. Berry, as quoted above, and as consistent with his decades of environmental advocacy, would definitely consider the ecocritic as necessarily an environmental/si, though he has little use for ecocriticism, seeing it as, in Scott Slovic's early sense of literature, an "indoor phenomenon." Slovic himself questions the unexamined assumption of the "environmentally concerned academic", that "a problem of some kind that receives public attention is likely to be corrected" (Slovic 1998, 178, 171) by the academic study and teaching of literature from an environmentalist standpoint. It is one thing to say that ecocriticism requires its practitioner to be an environmentalist, in terms of public issues, and another, of course, to consider that its practice will have any effect on public attitudes, policy, etc. It is tempting, from an environmentalist point of view, to see the ecocritic as a self-justifier, pretending to him /herself that he/she is addressing a "real" problem in the "real" world as opposed to the representational. Most ecocritical theory does not characterize the critic as an activist (although many academics who practice ecocriticism are activists in the field in other</page><page sequence="8">140 Journal of Appalachian Studies Volume 11 Numbers 1&amp;2 areas of their lives). But most do see a "vision" element as essential. Don Scheese says, Like other ecocritics, I hold that the nonhuman environment is a dominant character in the worlds both inside and outside the text; that the authors themselves subscribe to this belief, and that an important interaction occurs between nonhuman environment and author, place and text, which can result in a paradigmatic shift in the consciousness of the protagonist from an ego-centered (anthropomorphic) view of the world to an eco-centered (biocentric) perspective. (1996, 8-9) Here, literally and by implication, both the critic and the work have an "eco-centric perspective." In a similar, much-publicized definition of an "environmental text," Lawrence Buell also implies the ideological harmony between text and critic. In the environmental text, 1. The nonhuman environment is present not merely as a framing device but as a presence that begins to suggest that human history is implicated in natural history . . . 2. The human interest is not understood to be the only legitimate interest . . . 3. Human accountability to the environment is part of the text's ethical orientation . . . 4. Some sense of the environment as a process rather than a constant or a given is at least implicit in the text. . . . (1995, 7-8) One can see how the critic who attributes these attitudes to the environmental text must approve and share them. In his recent Practical Ecocriticism, Glen Love is much more assertive about the environmentalist obligation of the ecocritic, and in criticizing the lack of "ecological vision" in his discipline: "The greatest problem ecocriticism presently faces is the inertia of existing literary-critical enterprises. . . . For the most part English has been, and continues to be, conducted so as to serve as a textbook example of anthropocentrism: divorced from nature and in denial of the biological underpinnings of our humanity and our tenuous connection to the planet" (Love 2003, 28,23). The questions around the critic's role as environmental advocate are tied to the fourth area of questioning, that of the "cultural construction" of what the ecocritic studies. "As soon as we project our values onto the world,"</page><page sequence="9">Rethinking Appalachian Studies Series 141 says Cronon, "and begin to assert their primacy by calling them natural, we declare our unwillingness to consider alternative values that in all likelihood are no less compelling for people who hold them dear" (Cronon 1996, 51-2). From this point of view, not only are many environmentalists' defended spaces (such as "wilderness") just projections of human values, but representation of these values (in text, film, or whatever) is the projection of a projection. There can be no conflict between the anthropocentric and the ecocentric since human enterprise is inherently and unalterably anthropocentric. Most ecocritical theory rejects this argument. "Such subjectivism intimates no reality, no nature, beyond what we construct within our own mind," says Love. "This is a world of human solipsism, denied by the common sense that we live out in our everyday observations and actions." To him, "The great blind spot of postmodernism is its dismissal of nature, especially human nature. The constructionist nature-skeptics have walled themselves off from the life sciences . . ." (Love 2003, 26). This is a view supported by the "new paradigm" of ecology itself, which "challenges any clean distinction between culture and nature, and reaffirms the necessary inclusion of human factors and their effects in any study of a 'natural' system" (Cook 2003, 5). This reasoning might be considered "nature- constructionist," inverting the "constructionist nature-skeptics'" position: in effect, their skepticism is created by their body chemistry, inhabited environments, and the like. A literary response to cultural constructionism can involve accepting its truth to some degree, but using it against itself by studying texts as forms of "environmental perception." The "phenomenon of environmental consciousness" (Slovic 1998, 7) is different for each perceiver, but since the perception is the perceiver 's reality, the study of the perception as embodied in literature or in other cultural creation, although it may be of a "virtual" reality, is for all meaningful purposes equivalent to perception of some nonsubjective nature "out there." Joseph Carroll complexly deconstructs poststructuralist deconstruction with respect to ecological perception, his premise similarly being that all perception, including poststructuralist, is "figurative structure" and the creator's figurative perception is the "locus for the organization of human experience" (Carroll 1994,130). Another ecocritical direction is to deny directly the "ontological" basis of cultural construction. "Ecology is a study of interrelationship," say Greta Gaard and Patrick Murphy, "with its bedrock being the distinction between things-in-themselves and things-for-us. The latter entities result from intervention, manipulation, and transformation. Any entity that has been rendered as a thing for human use began its existence as an entity-in-itself" (Gaard and Murphy 1998, 5-6). Thus, the "entity-in-itself," or the "other," has equal reality value with the "thing-for-us." Ecocriticism examines</page><page sequence="10">142 Journal of Appalachian Studies Volume 11 Numbers 1 &amp; 2 the reciprocity between the two - e.g. "wilderness" as entity-in-itself and "wilderness" as cultural construction. "Just as we are able to metaphorize nature, so we can also biologize the metaphor or image" (Bleakley 2000, 82). Or, as Peter Narusewicz formulates it, An environmental consideration allows the possibility that meaning "is not only derived" from human culture, but that the "natural" or the "wild" can also convey meaning to humans. It is possible to join postmodern considerations with an ecological ethic in a manner to both resist essentialism and protect the wild. (1999, 6) This reciprocity expresses itself in the concept of "dialogics:" "Embodied dialogics foregrounds the social and cultural character of our interchanges in 'nature/ without backgrounding the physical world" (Rogers 2003, 58). As I understand it, the cultural creator conveys in his or her medium the experience of a "joint space created by coordinated and embodied interplay between the world and the inter-actor ... In this dialogical field the world and the individual dissolve into a complex sequential interchange in which neither the individual nor the world has priority" (Rogers 2003, 57). A good example of dialogics in action is the recent collection of nineteenth- century travel writings about Appalachia, edited by Kevin O'Donnell and Helen Hollingsworth: "All the elements of the nineteenth-century drama of nation-building are here: genocide, colonialism and industrialism, leisure and consumption, evolving attitudes toward nature and regional and ethnic identities" (2004, 3). These writings' "complex interchanges" are interpretable as "interplay" at a particular cultural-environmental period. Accepting the premise of a "joint space" connects with the questions concerning "literature" as the subject of ecocriticism. Two interlinked concepts involve both the idea of a space of human-natural reciprocity, and the application of ecocriticism to interdisciplinary Appalachian studies. And both suggest a scope of the ecocritical subject beyond literature as conventionally defined to encompass what I have generalized as "cultural creation" in a reciprocal relationship with nonhuman nature. The first of these concepts is "bioregionalism." Michael Branch and Daniel Philippon defend their definition of the Virginia Appalachians as a "bioregion" by demonstrating that it is "an ecological community that not only includes humans but also recognizes the effect of economic, social, and political forces upon the environment" (Branch and Philippon 1998, 12). If this definition of "bioregion" is accepted, and if it can be applied credibly to "Appalachia," then an Appalachian ecocritic can credibly study</page><page sequence="11">Rethinking Appalachian Studies Series 143 the dialogics of human creation and the "thing-in-itself" environment of this definable space. Of course, the separate bioregional identity of Appalachia as a definable ecological community including humans is hardly self-evident. Pointing out that geologically speaking, the Appalachian mountain chain stretches from northern Alabama to the northern tip of Newfoundland, Scott Weidensaul emphatically separates the mountains from what is denominated "Appalachia" (Weidensaul 1994, XII). James Still considered "Appalachia" "that somewhat mythical region with no recognized boundaries" (Still 1996, 683). Certainly, however, there is no reason why if Appalachia is mythical, the perceptions of its nature, as myth, can't be studied in relation to its physical reality as "nature." But it is not an all-or- nothing situation. An active current definition of a bioregion is of "an area that shares similar topography, plant and animal life, and human culture" (Great River Earth Institute 2004). Eastern Kentucky and North Georgia may have some similarities in topography, biota, and human culture, and many unshared characteristics. Their cultural creations can surely still be studied in terms of these differing degrees of "similarity." "Having doubt about the possibility of adequately defining regional identity is not the same as asserting that it does not exist" (Kowalewski 1992, 175). In his University of Tennessee dissertation ("A Study of Sustainable Living in East Tennessee and the Southern Appalachian Bioregion" [1997]) and numerous subsequent writings, Jonathan Scherch uses "bioregion" as a given instrumental term of art for creating "an ecological portrait of the social, economic, political, and environmental issues affecting Southern Appalachia ..." (Scherch 2003, 8-9). Linda Yarnell distinguishes the "largely social definition" of the Southern Appalachians as established by the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) (1973), from the environmental definition, in which the areas of the Southern Appalachians "share a common history alternating between cultural exchange and isolation from prehistory through the modern era" and can justifiably be studied as a whole in environmental terms (Yarnell 1998, 1). As an accepted and culturally legitimized concept (see Kirk Sale, Dwellers in the Land : The Bioregional Vision, 2nd ed., 2000), "bioregion" is neutral enough to be meaningful, particularly if it does not take on the environmental/si mode of antagonism. So, as applied to the goals of ecocriticism, bioregional ideas would seek to examine cultural creations with reference to the geographical, biological, and cultural milieux of their creation and content, milieux in the definition of which ecological attributes play a prominent role. One example of an Appalachian bioregional application of ecocriticism is described by John Elder, when his students in northern Appalachia study Frost's poem "A Tuft of Flowers," while learning how to use a scythe to mow a field: "The</page><page sequence="12">144 Journal of Appalachian Studies Volume 11 Numbers 1&amp;2 fact remains that a scythe is a tool as well as a symbol . . . that was used by the poet himself in hand mowing, and that its sound and technique informs [sic] both the music and the emotional tone of the poem" (Elder 1999, 652). Another, more extensive example is that of the Summer Environmental Writing Program (SEWP) directed by Randall Roorda of the University of Kentucky in the Robinson Forest of Eastern Kentucky. In the SEWP, modeled on the eminent New England Literature Program, "Students engage in various forms of field experience pertinent to a range of writing options: field notes, journaling, poetry, memoir, natural history, polemics, oral history, historical research, journalism, and collaborative projects." This program involves writing in the experience of "vital ecological connections," and is premised on "reconnecting the sciences and the humanities at their shared roots of observation, comprehension and expression" (SEWP 2003). In this program are effectuated many of the conceptual bases of ecocriticism and bioregionalism, and the diversity of creative activities the participants perform indicates how expansive the definition of "literature" can be in relation to the former. The SEWP also brings up the other concept relating to the ecocritical subject and Appalachian studies - "Place as Text." In "place theory," "place" is conceived "not simply in the light of an imagined descriptive or symbolic structure, not simply as social construction, not simply as an ecology, but all of these three simultaneously" (Buell 1999, 707). If the "dialogic" of Rogers (above) is applied, for example, to the SEWP students' writings, and the Robinson Forest is conceived as the "place" of Buell's definition, their writings themselves constitute "ecocriticism": the place is their text. The verbal interpreter of a "place" perceived culturally and ecologically is essentially an ecocritic whose text is spatial. May Thielgaard Watts in 1957 used the "place as text" idea literally in her Reading the Landscape of America: "The land offers us good reading, outdoors, from a lively, unfinished manuscript" (Watts 1957, v). In fact, the first chapter of her book uses the figure of shopping for antiques to characterize the Great Smoky Mountains. She "reads" the magnolia flower as a "floral antique," for what its physical attributes suggest about arboreal evolution: As I stood at the side of the hard modern road by the shiny modern automobile, and cupped the moonlight of the magnolia flower in my two modern prehensile hands, the warm June dusk around me seemed to brighten to a warm dawn - the dawn or flowering of the young earth. (Watts 1957, 2) According to the British geographer Pierce Lewis, "... most Americans are unaccustomed to reading landscape. It has never occurred to them</page><page sequence="13">Rethinking Appalachian Studies Series 145 that it can be done, much less that there is pleasure to be gained from it" (Lewis 1979, 13). According to distinguished environmentalist David Orr, "We no longer have a deep concept of place as a repository of meaning, history, livelihood, healing, recreation and sacred memory, and as a source of materials, energy food, and collective action" (Orr 1994, 163). I suggest that this cynicism is increasingly less justified, particularly with respect to regions such as Appalachia (however defined), where there is (as the following discussion will show) an increasing prominence of ecology in the study of its "places" as they are defined by Orr. There is an "intellectual ferment now effervescing around the notion of place . . . and it can be found not only in literature but in ecology, architecture, urban planning, cognitive studies, public health policy, cultural geography and elsewhere" (Kowalewski 1992, 172). Discussing the writers' senses of "place" they observed in compiling their bioregional Appalachian anthology, The Height of Our Mountains , Branch and Philippon find a richness of attributes: places are distinctive and continuous at the same time; perceived places overlap and contain more localized places; they are "constructed by individuals as well as communities, just as places help to shape both individual and community identities." Most importantly for ecological perception, places are valued both for intrinsic and instrumental reasons, and are both fictional and factual: "... both a garden and a wilderness, a paradise and a desert, a comfort and a danger, a friend and a foe; it is also none of these" (Branch and Philippon 1998, 22). "This multifaceted imagination of particular American places is perhaps the most remarkable feature of much contemporary writing about place" (Kowalewski 1992, 172). It is definitely a trend in Appalachian studies. John Nolt quotes Christopher Camuto in his Another Country: Journeying toward the Cherokee Mountains (1997) as seeking "to read the fragmented Appalachian summit region" (Nolt 2001a, 149). (The other works reviewed by Nolt in the same piece, Margaret Lynn Brown's The Wild East : A Biography of the Great Smoky Mountains [2000], Daniel Pierce's The Great Smokies : From Natural Habitat to National Park [2000], and Tom Hansell's film Breaks in the Mountain : The Russell Fork Gorge [1999], all partake of the "place as text" concept, and could be considered works of non-literary ecocriticism). "Reading" place also has a lengthy history in the discipline of site interpretation itself. I suggest that any interpreters of a site which has dialogic cultural and ecological elements are performing "oral ecocriticism," with the site as text, and the visitors as readers. "Rocks, birds, reptiles, mammals, wildflowers, trees, resource issues, human issues, local cuisine, directions - all are within the domain of the interpreter" (Rutherford 2000, 11). The interpreter whose site is an ecologically-based written text also becomes a de facto interpreter of the space the text interprets by way of</page><page sequence="14">146 Journal of Appalachian Studies Volume 11 Numbers 1 &amp; 2 its characterization of it. "Architecture and literature are both achieved integrations. Both can help us see landscapes as environments" (Tuan 1979, 97). In this sense verbal and non-verbal cultural creations serve both as ecocritical commentary and as ecocritical subject. Kent Ryden, referring to Northern Appalachia, argues strongly that "human lifeways" must be integrated into ecocriticism: ". . . the eco in ecocriticism should make room as appropriate not only for natural ecology but for its accompanying human ecology as well" (Ryden 1997, 6). Any study of place as text, particularly if we accept the Cronon premise that every "natural" place has been impacted by "human lifeways," performs this integration. For example, in an essay on Wendell Berry, Ted Olson (1992) involves multiple interpretive connections between Thoreau's and Berry's verbal constructions of their home landscapes, and Berry's interpretation of Harlan Hubbard's indweller's sense of place as the opposite of Thoreau's. Courtice Rose discusses "human geography as text interpretation" (Rose 1980, 123). Anne Buttimer uses a quote from John Denver's "Country Roads" as epigraph for her discussion of imagined place as a social symbol of "harmony and centeredness" (Buttimer 1980, 166). Howard Kuhn applies this idea of place to Appalachian fiction in "Rampant Edenism in Recent Appalachian Writers," connecting the literature of place created by Appalachian insiders to the mythical Appalachian place imagined by outsiders. In authentic literature of Appalachian place, work links human and natural ecology: Life must remain rural, so that a man and his family own just enough land to provide their needs, so that tools and machines are of a human scale and do not dwarf or degrade us, so that work connects us with the soil, with the seasons, and with the cycles of growth and life and death. (Kuhn 1992, 47) III. Appalachian Ecology and Ecocriticism: Growing through Time Until recently, representations of "Appalachia" as a discrete region have generally, since "it was discovered by the American public as a distinctive entity" (Batteau 1983, 1), been discussed not in the manner of reciprocity, as Kuhn does above, but with its "natural" attributes subsumed under the rubric of its cultural problems and institutions. Discussion of Appalachian ecology as separate from, or at least on a parity with, its human culture, has lagged behind other subjects of concern, such as religion, economy, community life, and "folk arts." And where ecological considerations enter a discussion as significant players, they have traditionally been "factors</page><page sequence="15">Rethinking Appalachian Studies Series 147 in" some larger social concern, even if they do have significance in the problem at hand. Of course, in the lineage of William Bartram, Asa Gray, Henri Michaux, Bradford Torrey, Roderick and Donald Culross Peattie, Michael Frome, Harvey Broome, and many others, there has been a strong naturalist tradition of including elements of human culture in descriptions of Appalachian natural history. For example, the contributors to the Peatties' The Great Smokies and the Blue Ridge (1943), while concentrating to a great extent on biological description, include Alberta Hannum writing on "Mountain People," and John Jacob Niles on "Folk Ballad and Carol." Niles sees a cultural purity within the "sordid outer fringe - the deserted coal- tipple, the burned-out logging camp, the eroded mountain cornfield, the artificial mountain made of slag, on which not even ragweed will grow" (Niles 1943, 218). But only implicitly does he connect the folk music he characterizes with the physical environment in which he gathered it. It seems that a direct, not always salutary, interface of Southern Appalachian culture and post-"natural history" ecological concern emerges with the establishment of two "culturally constructed" entities - the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the Appalachian Trail (AT). By enabling non-indwellers to perceive, and "read," in different ways, Appalachian nature, the Park and the AT dispossessed many Appalachian indwellers of their "places." A number of the environmental advocates involved with these institutions, and with the region, who brought to it an "ecological vision," were members of, or associated with, the founding of the Wilderness Society in 1936 - Harvey Broome, Aldo Leopold, Olaus Murie, Robert Marshall, Robert Sterling Yard, and Benton MacKaye, creator of the AT. MacKaye was unique among the group in evolving toward envisioning a confluence between a preservationist land ethic and cultural enrichment. In one essay he imagined the wilderness as a "folk school" and "explicitly linked the development of a sensitive local ecological consciousness to the civic and political health of communities" (L. Anderson 2002, 150). By contrast, the decades of Harvey Broome's journals (first selected for publication in 1975), are dominated by lyrical personal narratives rich with compelling ecological readings of natural habitat and human impact upon it, although the humans present in them are primarily perceivers. On the "dialogic" model that Rogers (above) sees practiced by Leopold's Sand County Almanac, Broome negotiates between the (human-created) "wilderness ethic" and the autonomous physical nature outside his control: The old apple trees around the house and spring seem to be dying. They were probably set out at the same time</page><page sequence="16">148 Journal of Appalachian Studies Volume 11 Numbers 1 &amp;2 and have reached senility together. Already pushing up under and through their branches are young and vigorous seedlings and saplings. The only thing we have to do is to adjust mentally to the changes which the heat and moisture and fertility of this place bring about. It is one of the hardest things men have to do - to accept nature. Many work and fret and wear themselves out trying to control nature. Here at the cabin we have learned to accept it, and a rich and rewarding and relaxing leisure is born. (Broome 2001, 134) Broome's journals, fusing in this manner subjective attitude and objective observation, were a significant contribution to the outpouring of environmental writing in the "golden age" of 1970s environmentalism. The natural history tradition itself did not lead to an immediate application of ecocritical insight to 1970s Appalachia. In his activist writings of the 1970s, Broome's disciple Michael Frome (1989) was highly critical of the Forest Service and other governmental entities, but his focus was primarily on the treatment of non-inhabited environments. In 2002, in the first full-length Appalachian environmental history, Donald Davis considers as "enigmatic" prior discussions of culture-environment relations in Appalachian studies: "The role of ecological forces in the development of mountain culture is largely de-emphasized in order to prove the adaptive superiority of one ethnic group over another" (Davis 2002, 202). "Ecocritical conceptions of the world tend, not surprisingly, to privilege non-urban settings" (O'Brien 2001, 142), but this generalization is "enigmatic" when applied to Appalachia: the intensity of communal social identity in non-urban Appalachia seems to have previously led to a privileging of social issues, even when their concerns are deeply embedded in "nature." Perhaps "crude environmental determinism" (Davis 2002, 201) ironically contributes to the privileging of the social: environmental conditions are seen as so unalterably fixed that they are beyond meaningful discussion. The reader will notice that this discussion has seemingly been evoking perceptions of the Appalachian environment rather than ecocriticism per se. This is because the "privileging" of environment in studies of Appalachia had to exist before its significant presence in cultural creation and the interpretation thereof, could exist. Also in the sense of "place as text," as has been discussed, describers of the environment are inherently ecocritics. Perhaps the Porter /Abbey Appalachian Wilderness of 1970 could be seen as a source-book of post-Earth Day Appalachian ecocriticism, in that it contains in Porter's pictures and in Abbey's text readings of place, which can themselves be read as cultural creation. The book visually and</page><page sequence="17">Rethinking Appalachian Studies Series 149 verbally engages in environmentalist rhetoric, one of many published by Ballantine in the period which sought to fuse aesthetic and sociopolitical perception of environmental conditions. The edgy contrast between Porter's overwhelming polychromatic unpeopled natural scenes and Abbey's irreverent attacks on "the black plague of commerce, industrialism and urbanism" (Abbey 1970, 56) makes a strong ecocritical point about the ironic separation of Appalachian nature and 1970 culture. Abbey's social contacts and discussions with "native" Appalachians who do not experience the separateness the reader does, enhance the paradoxicality of this situation. A leading citizen of Sylva, NC, for example, replies to Abbey's criticism of the encompassing paper mill stench: "'Why, son, that there smells lahk [sic] money to me'" (Abbey 1970, 97). Appalachian Wilderness ties in with the increasing movement, as the 1970s progressed, toward incorporating ecological concerns at a level of parity in interdisciplinary studies of Appalachian culture. Kai T. Erickson's Everything in its Path : Destruction of Community in the Buffalo Creek Flood (1976) brought national attention to the intertwinement of culture and nature in Appalachia. A significant essay in this vein is "Industrialization and Attrition of Mountain Characteristics: A Fictional Study" (1976), by Charlotte Ross. Ross traces "the literary history of the mountaineer's involvement with industry" (Ross 1976, 48), as manifested in novels of the 1930s and 1940s. Although her focus, like that of Cratis Williams and other prior interpreters of Appalachian fiction, is on the human (versus environmental) impact of industrialization, she underscores that this impact is at least partly expressed through "the physical invasion of industry into the isolated countryside" (Ross 1976, 49). At this point, where we approach a real criticism of place as / or text from an ecological point of view, the annual Appalachian Studies Conferences begin, and from their panoramas of multidisciplinarity we can trace the growth of ecocriticism in Appalachian studies as a whole. In 1978 at Berea, one of a number of conference workshop sessions concerned "Natural Sciences," and was facilitated by a U.S. Forest Service representative. This session was separate from ones on "Literature" and "Urban Appalachians," suggesting a persistence of disconnection between ecology as science and other disciplines. The 1979 conference showed a remarkable development in the movement. The "Land" of Appalachia was the operational theme. An ecocritical approach to cultural creation was probably most evident in the session on "Environmental Perception in Appalachia," which included Roberta Roy [Herrin]'s paper on "Environmental Perception in Literature and Music." As well as environmental/si presentations, such as Richard B. Drake's "The Reckless Assault on Land and People," other papers which</page><page sequence="18">150 Journal of Appalachian Studies Volume 11 Numbers 1 &amp; 2 might be considered ecocritical in nature were Edwin R. Cheek's "Land as a Theme in Appalachian Literature/' and Jerry Williamson's "The Politics of Place in Recent Appalachian Literature." "Ecology" was apparently first introduced as an operative term at the 1980 conference, in Gene Wilhelm's "Appalachia and the Third World: Eco- Development as an Alternative in the New World Order." Wilhelm uses the term "eco-growth" to argue for "removal of the artificial and self-defeating conflict between ecology and economics which is now built into our system of economic decision-making. Man must make ecology and economics the allies they can and should be ... " (Wilhelm 1981, 38). Wilhelm, comparing Appalachia and the "third world," is considering a subject whose terminology had not yet emerged, "globalization," as considered in the 2002 Journal of Appalachian Studies' "Symposium on Globalism and Appalachian Studies." The subject here, as controversial, is premised on the reality of "ecological crisis" (Reid and Taylor 2002, 17), and the impacts on this crisis as it is manifested in Appalachia of regional versus global political, economic, and environmental initiatives. The ecocritic examining Appalachian place as text must often involve such comparisons of places' characteristics on a global scale. The 1980 program also included other presentations involving land use and environmental considerations. One paper by John Opie clearly separates the interacting attributes of human culture and environment while indirectly suggesting the potential for an ecocritical approach to the reading of landscape. Opie says, "The natural features of a piece of land, the mechanics or technology of working and living on it, all suggest that a quality of life is intimately related to the geography one starts out with, and the 'built landscape' one comes up with" (1982, 58). Throughout the 1980s, ASA conference programs included papers with this kind of dialogic approach to place studies. Some stand out more than others for their ecocritical associations. In "Regionalization and Revitalization: Towards a Comparative Perspective on Appalachian Studies" (1987), Richard Blaustein contrasts the "idealized, selective, symbolic form" of perceiving the "old subsistence culture" to the contemporary "literate, industrialized, corporate-dominated world." He interprets the motivation of much of the Appalachian studies movement as "the search to regain the safe and good place" (Blaustein 1988, 17, 19) - an impulse that itself can be perceived as "false nostalgic pastoralism" or as the work of imaginative creation that gives Appalachian place the "literary" qualities Branch and Philippon attribute to it in the article discussed above. In 1988, Ricky Cox's "Used Parts and the Poetic Impulse: Machines as Alternative Forms of Expression" explores the figuration of poetry as machine. His discussion comes across as an oblique critique of the figuration in Appalachian literature of poetry as landscape and landscape as poetry</page><page sequence="19">Rethinking Appalachian Studies Series 151 (". . . furrow-straight sentences/ . . . theory of line /or paradoxes about roots/ withering in resurrection" [Leidig 1996, 663]). Cox asserts, [Machines'] use in tapping natural resources in certain regions of Appalachia has made of them unwitting accomplices to a terrible crime, while in other areas they have provided people with a means of sharing the benefits of industrial society without giving up physical ties to home and to the relative self-sufficiency this has traditionally afforded. (Cox 1989, 28) His critique thus unites literary ecocriticism with ecocriticism of place in terms of cultural-ecological paradox. And one other paper from die 1988 conference is worth noting in this context. In it, James Byer fully articulates the poetry-landscape figure in affirming an ecocritical approach to landscape interpretation: "For those who can read, the surface of the earth, its texture and form, and the vegetation it supports are a language and embody, just as words do, a history. ... A heavily grazed field feels different to the foot than an ungrazed one" (Byer 1989, 50). The 1991 Appalachian Studies Conference, "Environmental Voices: Cultural, Social, Political, and Natural" revisited the focus of the 1979 conference from a perspective changed by more than a decade of development in ecological and ecocritical thinking. Among relevant presentations, David Hsiung discussed the issue of geographical determinism, Jean Spear the "hegemony of landscape" over culture, David Sutton the role of environmentalist as enemy of the disadvantaged, and Margaret Lynn Brown the contrast between "captains of tourism" and "idealistic environmentalists" in the Smokies. The papers at this conference most relevant to the practice of specifically literary ecocriticism were Chesla Sharp's "Coal-Mining Songs as Forms of Environmental Protest" and Ted Olson's "Agricultural Themes in Appalachian Folk Songs." Olson includes an imaginative revision of the Appalachian nature /culture duality: Many Americans in their prejudice against the Appalachian culture have failed to realize that environmental problems in Appalachia are more the result of outside intervention than of local ignorance, and by "blaming the victim" these Americans became accessories to the raping of natural resources in Appalachia, as well as the poisoning of the region's dominant folk culture. (1992, 68) From the late 1980s through the 1990s, the spread of Appalachian environmental and ecocritical discussion can be represented by the growing</page><page sequence="20">152 Journal of Appalachian Studies Volume 11 Numbers 1&amp;2 diversity of public fora in which this discussion took place. The values giving rise to material issues of Appalachian land use were the subject of a 1982 conference entitled "Land Ethics in Appalachia: A Conference on the Ethical Values Related to Land." The contributors were concerned with bioregionalism, even if they did not use that term. The symposium on "Sense of Place in Appalachia," held at Morehead State University in 1987, gave greater ecological and ecocritical scope to the concept of bioregionalism through studies of place defined as human-inclusive ecosystem. Ruel Foster's discussion of place in River of Earth characterizes the "matrix" of James Still's and Elizabeth Madox Roberts's "poetic realism" as "their mysterious attraction to nature, their deep compulsion to celebrate over and over again the powers and rituals of nature." He applies to Still Jacques Maritain's formulation of an "intercommunication between the inner being of things and the inner being of the human self . . . ," thereby suggesting an ecology both material and spiritual (Foster 1988, 69). In another discussion at this symposium, Jim Wayne Miller, speaking as artist rather than as critic, elaborates an ecological sense of Appalachia as place, "a geographical, historical, cultural, and spiritual borderland." He is interested in making visible the "invisible element of a place," and makes the important distinction between "the genuine literature of a place and literature about a place" (Miller 1988, 66). The debate over this distinction was to play an important role in subsequent ecocriticism. For example, ten years later we find this distinction used by Mary Jean Herzog to criticize Bill Bryson's "disparaging descriptions of people and places" in A Walk in the Woods (Herzog 1999, 123). Miller also thinks the concepts of region and regionalism are in a process of réévaluation, as is the concept of place: "region" is increasingly being considered to encompass diversity, rather than being homogeneous (Miller 1988). Turning to other sources, we find this enrichment of sense of place through culture-ecosystem reciprocity in the 1989 issue of Now and Then devoted to "Sense of Place in Appalachia." The issue features a wonderful series of telescoping maps of place by Jo Carson, "Jo Carson Traces Her Routes," which begins with northeast Tennessee, and progresses through her neighborhood, land, to her own body. Carson's maps incorporate the built, the "natural," and her own personal history, combining place and environmental perception. By contrast, my piece "Here and Elsewhere," excerpted interviews with visiting indwelling and outdwelling writers who participated in the "Regionalism and Inspiration" writers' residencies (1987) at East Tennessee State University. The interviewees displayed very diverse literary senses of "region" and "place." Gurney Norman says, as paraphrased by me, "the essence of regionalism is identity with the natural world of a particular</page><page sequence="21">Rethinking Appalachian Studies Series 153 physical space" (Waage 1989, 33). New York novelist Hugh Nissenson cites the international popularity of his "geographically and temporally regional novel," The Tree of Life, set in frontier Ohio, to suggest that cultural globalization (not his term) is increasingly expressed through people's interest in the arts and cultures of specific regions other than their own (Waage 1989, 34). Nissenson implies that the power of place is most strongly experienced by those who are not its inhabitants. A significant enhancement of Appalachian place-based ecocriticism comes in the volume The Poetics of Appalachian Space (1991), edited by Parks Lanier. This critical anthology's limitation is to some extent caused by the kind of academic "abstraction" that Jim Wayne Miller (above) sees as an impediment to a holistic regionalism. All the essays in the Lanier volume "exemplify the process of eidetic reduction which [Gaston] Bachelard employs in [his book] The Poetics of Space " (Lanier 1991, 2). By taking an abstract French deconstructionist as shaman, the Lanier volume may on the one hand be seen as globalizing the regional, but on the other hand it imposes a culturally alien theoretical system on region-defined Appalachian spaces. Norman's "natural world" is significantly absent from the literary places in these essays, whose main locus appears to be the "oneiric house" and the familial network within it. Culture trumps nature in most of this volume's criticism. The only un-domesticated essays are one by Ricky Cox, who applies his poetry-as-mechanism figure to Miller's The Mountains Have Come Closer , and a study by Mary Williams of Robert Morgan's poetry. Williams presumes to suggest a limitation of Bachelard's omniscience: he doesn't, as Morgan does, explore "the internalness and secrecy of earth." Williams characterizes the human-created spaces, from woodsheds to potato-holes, that center many of Morgan's poems, as "bless[ing] natural processes and investing] them with a sacramental quality" (Williams 1991, 153). Other ecocritical works of the 1990s are not as closely connected with the Appalachian studies movement itself, as with developments in organizing ecological concern and action in the area. These include the formation of organizations such as the Southern Appalachian Highlands Conservancy and the Dogwood Alliance, periodicals such as Wildearth, perennial conferences such as the Southern Appalachian Man and the Biosphere conference, and Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) reports and documents, such as the Wilderness Society's ongoing series of publications on Appalachian wildlands, which began with Mountain Treasures at Risk : The Future of the Southern Appalachian National Forests (1989). A significant work coming from this direction is George Constanz's Hollows, Peepers, and Highlanders: An Appalachian Mountain Ecology (1994). Significantly, Constanz shapes his collection of "stories" about actors in ecosystems by</page><page sequence="22">154 Journal of Appalachian Studies Volume 11 Numbers 1 &amp; 2 way of a literary metaphor: the sections of his book are entitled "Stage and Theater," "The Players," "Seasonal Arts," and "Epilogue." Of the thirty fairly short chapters, only one, "Highlanders," is devoted to humans.This is quite a change from the "natural history" tradition, of which Constanz is an heir, since it suggests the relative insignificance of the human species in the complexity and diversity of Appalachian ecosystems. Another 1994 book, Scott Weidensaul's Mountains of the Heart : A Natural History of the Appalachians, is shaped by the author's journey from Alabama to Newfoundland. It creates a string of spheres in which, from a personal experience, we are moved to an examination of the ecology suggested by the experience, and then return to the personal voice again. A discussion of Appalachian salamanders' varieties, behaviors, and environmental vulnerability is thus introduced: Resting on the trunk of the fallen spruce, I scuff absently at the soil at my feet, scraping a dark brown tear in the litter. Something small and wet skitters out from beneath a rotting birch leaf and vanishes, and I bend low to poke more purposefully in pursuit. Under a piece of old bark, I find it again: a tiny salamander. (Weidensaul 1994, 39) Weidensaul's book is a good illustration of the "reciprocity" involved in negotiating between the perceiving subjective consciousness and the "out there" natural phenomena. Other recent environmental texts tend to put the human presence "in its place," and thus interpret Appalachia ecocentrically. An Appalachian Tragedy : Air Pollution and Tree Death in the Eastern Forests of North America, edited by Harvard Ayers and others, gives regional specificity to the concerns of Charles Little's important The Dying of the Trees (1995), elaborating on the concerns of Constanz's "Epilogue," that human intrusions - "forest fragmentation, lack of land-use planning, acid deposition, and exotic species" (Constanz 1994, 206) - make both nature and human society vulnerable. In a different tone, Barbara Hallowell's Mountain Year : A Southern Appalachian Nature Notebook (1998) gives lyrical voice to the environmental interdependencies Constanz discusses. As a work both of literature and of place ecocriticism, Far Appalachia : Following the New River North (2002) by Noah Adams, integrates human presence and nature description. He makes landscape a figure, not for text, but for visual art, comparing the art of Dave Martin to that of a topographical map: "the rhythm was the same, the wanderings of the hills and watercourses. The only harsh, nonlyrical lines on the maps were those showing the highways and power lines" (Adams 2002, 30). In light of the above texts, it is interesting to search the two exhaustive</page><page sequence="23">Rethinking Appalachian Studies Series 155 volumes of Appalachia Inside Out (1996) for ecocritical presences. A large part of the second volume is devoted to oral and written literature, criticism, and discussions of regionalism. Other than this writer's own article, "Teaching Environmental Literature in Southern Appalachia," the ecological /ecocritical presence does not seem strong, except in a number of the intercalary poems. Some articles, such as the critique of the "Appalachian literature" concept by W. H. Ward, written originally in 1978, are not representative of the 1990s' new nature awareness. Lorie K. Lindberg's apparently more recent study of Denise Giardina's novels lets us see them through the environmental ethics implied in her characters' behavior. But we don't see here the novelist who could say early in her career, "Our human use of the land is the result of a gift from God, and that gift was given with the expectation that it would be used wisely and justly" (Hacala 1980, 47). The only criticism in this particular collection which seems informed by ecological awareness is John Lang's on Wendell Berry, dating from 1991. It is almost inherent to discussing Berry's or Dillard's writings in the context of an "ecological vision," since they are both, in different ways, visionary ecologists. Lang summarizes Berry's literary identity thus: "As a farmer, Berry is keenly aware of his ties to the natural world. Just as he strives to redefine our assumptions about economic life, so he seeks to instill in his readers an awareness of humanity's radical dependence on nature" (Lang 1996, 729). Incidentally, Wendell Berry seems to be the ecocritics' choice as representative Appalachian writer, perhaps to the neglect of others. They find in him what might be called an "Appalachian Sublime" (despite his despair at human treatment of nature - but perhaps this side of Berry is consistent with the idea "that the threat of ecocatastrophe could be a new version of the sublime" [Hitt 1999, 619]). Berry's poetry comprehends "the biocentric holiness of creation" (Scigaj 2002, 132). John Cooley's 1994 collection of essays on American nature writers is dominated by Berry and Dillard. Their spirit is seen in current critical approaches which "embrace an organic or ecological conception of textuality, viewing any given text as a complex community of intrinsic and extrinsic relationships" (Cooley 1994, 252). If Appalachia Inside Out seems a little "retro" in its limited coverage of ecology and ecocriticism, that may be because of the growing number of articles and books since 1996 which are bringing an ecological perspective to many different areas of Appalachian studies. Representative might be the 2001 issue of Now and Then devoted to "Striking a Balance: Conserving and Developing Appalachia's Natural Resources." One might be skeptical of the possibility of such "balance"; however, as well as the obligatory coverage of mining, the issue includes John Nolt's "Living Sustainably Appalachian Style," and a perceptive reading by Timothy G. Anderson of</page><page sequence="24">156 Journal of Appalachian Studies Volume 11 Numbers 1 &amp;2 the cultural landscape created by the Hanging Rock region's iron mills. Also, Katy Griffith Fish's review of the as-of-now-quintessential Appalachian econovel, Barbara Kingsolver's Prodigal Summer, considers her approach successfully ecofeminist, despite the novel's flaws: "The characters meet only in the most surprising ways despite the limited size of their ecosystem" (Fish 2001, 39). Other recent articles in Appalachian periodicals suggest the insight gained in different areas by way of an ecocritical perspective. Katherine Ledford shows in "'The Primitive Circle:' Inscribing Class in Southern Appalachian Travel Writing, 1816 - 46," how "nineteenth-century travelers in Appalachia linked geographic space with class identity" (68). Similarly, environmental perception is shown by Brooks Blevins to have molded character perception in earlier twentieth century descriptions of Appalachian and Ozark indwellers: "To many visitors, the Ozark people were at best simply an extension of the physical region - untamed, picturesque, ancient, but rarely threatening - or at most an unfortunate and inconvenient blemish on an otherwise splendid landscape" (Blevins 2001, 265). Other examples of Appalachian ecocriticism are articles by Dennis Winter (2002) and Martin Crawford on Elizabeth Madox Roberts's The Time of Man and Charles Frazier's Cold Mountain. Stones are seen as having power in Roberts's novel both physically and sacramentally, tying together the rituals of faith and of farming. Crawford (2002) criticizes Frazier's novel not only for subtly re-stereotyping Appalachia, but also for employing "names on the land" rather than concretely describing the natural spaces where the characters dwell. An immediate source of information on the current status of ecology and ecocriticism in Appalachian studies, as it was for the 1970s and 1980s, is the program of the annual Appalachian Studies Conference. The 2003 and 2004 conferences manifest an institutionalization of ecology and ecocriticism. As well as specific presentations, the 2003 conference included complete sessions or workshops on "Environmental Challenges in the Region," "Ecological Literature in Appalachia," "Ecological Design for Appalachia," and "Justice, Sustainability, and Participatory Place: An Appalachian Environmentalism?" Sessions at the 2004 conference included ones on environmental politics, conservation and hunting, environmental literature, and the literature of place, a signal presentation under the latter being "Building Hope and Healing Through Appalachian Literature." Addressing some of the concerns of environmental perception and ecocritical theory, one imaginative session, "Viewing the Environment through the Eyes of an Appalachian Farmer," had, as participants, the farmers themselves. Other organizational conferences have also taken account of this subject. A session at the 2004 conference of the Society for the Study of Southern Literature was devoted to "Ecocriticism and Southern Places."</page><page sequence="25">Rethinking Appalachian Studies Series 157 In the last five years, several full-length texts have, in my view, established beyond doubt the credibility of an Appalachian ecocriticism. The most pertinent to ecocriticism's literary concerns is Elizabeth Engelhardts The Tangled Roots of Feminism, Environmentalism, and Appalachian Literature (2003), which was the subject of a round-table discussion at the 2004 Appalachian Studies Conference. The Appalachian-ecofeminist connection had been emphasized, but not elaborated, previously, in Danny Miller's Wingless Flights : Appalachian Women in Fiction (1996): "The first and most obvious attribute of women in Appalachian fiction is undoubtedly their close, almost mythic, relationship with the natural world" (Miller 1996, 3). But Engelhardt writes with the benefit of the ecocritical awareness developed in the last decade, and is able thereby to see the writers she discusses as earlier critics did not, in the light of the dawning twentieth century conservation movement. In the Emory dissertation which became her book she boldly asserts that "ecological feminism has roots in turn-of- the century Appalachia" (Engelhardt 1999, 25). Literature is also the subject, and content, of the Branch and Philippon anthology referred to earlier in discussing bioregionalism, The Height of our Mountains : Nature Writing from Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains and Shenandoah Valley (1998). By including multigeneric texts from the seventeenth century to the present, Branch and Phillipon enable us to see the diversity of bioregional writing capable of being considered ecocritically. Their text is "part of a larger effort to understand the interaction of literature and environment on an international scale" (Branch and Philippon 1998, xxi). They assert that "nature writing often crosses, conflates, and eludes generic barriers" and define it as "a vital conversation through time," whose subject is "the interaction between nature and culture in a particular place" (Branch and Philippon 1998, 8, 9). The place their writings, "in" and "about," describes is a clearly defined and mapped region of northwestern Virginia, and to it they apply, in an illuminating introduction, a discussion of the "bioregion" concept: If the definition of a "bioregion" requires that increased attention be given to ecological factors, then including both "natural" and "cultural" factors in that definition is "bioregional" in the broadest sense of the term - in the sense of recovering "region" in terms of an ecological community that not only includes humans but recognizes the effect of economic, social and political forces on the environment. (Branch and Philippon 1998, 12) An ecocritical work moving more in the direction of reading place as text is Chris Bolgiano's Living in the Appalachian Forest : True Tales of Sustainable</page><page sequence="26">158 Journal of Appalachian Studies Volume 11 Numbers 1 &amp;2 Forestry (2002). Bolgiano's book begins with the question "How can we live on the earth without destroying it?" (Bolgiano 2002, 1). In responding to this question and exploring the concept of sustainability through descriptive and biographical narrative, the author provides an ecocritical study of place as literal and figurative. Much like Noah Adams in Far Appalachia, she interweaves the choices and fates of individuals and interpretations of their effects - both positive and negative from an ecological viewpoint - on the forest environment. Bolgiano also excels at the historical reading of impacted landscapes: There's no coal where we live, and no timber barons have ever owned our hundred-acre tract, as far as I know. Yet signs of a tortured past abound. Roads slashed up Cross Mountain years ago are still eroding. Charred stumps recall searing fires fueled by logging debris and by whole trees cut only for their bark from which tannic acid was leached for making leather. A rusting crane sits on a hilltop, abandoned after it wrenched out all the timber it could reach. Moidering chestnut rails snake up a rocky slope with venerable locust trees on one side, sure testaments of a formerly open area. It was probably a desperate effort to grow corn. A little lower, on the plateau where our house sits, a spiderweb of old fenced wires is stuck to the ground by different kinds of barbs. Livestock once grazed here. Someone tried to make a living from this land. (Bolgiano 2002, 165) John O'Brien's At Home in the Heart of Appalachia (2002) uses reminiscence to weave culture and nature together in the same way Bolgiano does, and despite its different form, also to the end of responding to her initial question. O'Brien wants his readers to know "that one of the richest and loveliest regions of America was savagely exploited and that the exploitation continues," yet his text is pervaded by "his" (versus the "mythic") Appalachia, "lush green mountains, deep forest, ice-cold trout streams, small hill-farms and little towns filled with unpretentious working-class people like my relatives" (Conversation 2004). Finally we encounter two texts which employ ecocriticism as a centering technique in more encompassing works of creative nonfiction. John Elder's Reading the Mountains of Home (1998) shapes a personal narrative of exploring the Green Mountains of Appalachian Vermont around a continuing ecocritical reading of Robert Frost's great poem, "Directive." Throughout, the insights derived from this reading of Frost are attached to the insights derived from the author's readings of the mountain spaces he encounters.</page><page sequence="27">Rethinking Appalachian Studies Series 159 "Dramatic shifts of tone like this one occur throughout the poem, giving it an unpredictable quality, like that of my present footing in these woods" (Elder 1998, 17). "My goal," says Elder, "has been to explore, in a direct and personal way, an ecosystem of meaning that includes both literature and the land" (Elder 1998, 4). Elder's goal seems very similar, in form and purpose, to that of Ian Marshall's Story Line : Exploring the Literature of the Appalachian Trail (1998). Both involve successful, to me, transcendence of the difficulties posed by this essay's questions on ecocritical theory, particularly that of cultural construction. In his introduction, Marshall suggests that his text is both literary geography, literary history, and "literary geohistory" (Marshall 1998, 3). The "story line" derived from reading Appalachian literature, in which "one can trace our evolving legacy of landscape aesthetics and our changing attitudes toward nature and the wild," moves from Colonial "economic, imperialistic, and théologie" views of nature to the "nationalism" of the nineteenth century, and subsequently to "an appreciation incorporating ecological awareness" (Marshall 1998, 3). Through this "ecological awareness," Marshall, who has over the years hiked most of the Appalachian Trail, melds nature description and his personal experiences on different sections of the trail with ecocritical discussion of some of the works written since the Colonial era about the same areas he is traversing. Marshall feels subjective "literary" narrative is perfectly compatible with ecocriticism: "Narrative scholarship is a way of putting into practice the ecological principle of interconnectedness . . . an ecology of reading, where life, literature, and theory interconnect and merge in a meaningful way" (Marshall 1998, 8). Looking forward to the future of ecocriticism as integral to Appalachian studies disciplines, I think it is important to consider the possibilities opened by the expansion beyond literature of its subject matter. Of course there are numerous forthcoming written texts relevant to it, such as Tim Barnwell's The Face of Appalachia: Portraits of a Frontier Mountain Farm and Kevin O'Donnell's anthology Seekers of Scenery: American Magazine Travel Writing from Southern Appalachia , circa 1840 - 1900 . But many other modes of Appalachian ecocriticism can be newly, or further, engaged. Pedagogy can apply ecocriticism to Appalachian studies through using multiple forms of "cultural creation," as Rick Van Noy does in his Radford University course "Ecocriticism: The Literature of Place." Field and nonfield programs like the SEWP can integrate ecocriticism and experience: for example, Tina Hanlon's and Carolyn Thomas's "Integrating Ecological Principles and the Humanities to Improve Environmental Education" at Ferrum College. As Eliot Porter (and the graphic artists of the nineteenth century represented in O'Donnell's and Hollings worth' s book) demonstrate, photography and visual art involving Appalachian nature is inherently interpretive, and thereby ecocritical. Although they have had predominantly</page><page sequence="28">160 Journal of Appalachian Studies Volume 11 Numbers 1&amp;2 an environmental justice focus - as in Douglas Hawes-Davis's Green Rolling Hills (1995) and Sasha Waters' s Razing Appalachia (2003) - films of Appalachia have been for a long time vehicles for ecocriticism as well as sociopolitical advocacy, particularly those produced by Bullfrog Films and Appalshop's Appalachian Film Workshop. The latter has itself been the subject of a semi-ecocritical study, Stephen Hanna's Representing Appalachia : Appalshop Films and the Politics of Regional Identity (1997). The whole realm of Appalachian material cultural creation - from shaped landscapes to built environments, past and present - is open to interpretive discussion in relation to the multidisciplinary "project of understanding the complex relationships" within the Appalachian bioregion. Wadland and Gibson point out that etymologically from the Greek, bioregion means "life territory." On the Appalachian life territory "may be inscribed the text of inheritance and loss, or the text of discovery and renewal" (Wadland and Gibson 1987, 52, 47). The text of discovery and renewal is that written by the collaborative work of Appalachian studies and ecocriticism. References Abbey, Edward. 1970. Natural and human history.
