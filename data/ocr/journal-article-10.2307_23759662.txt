International agreement on the protection of the Selva Lacandona WIEN (Der Standard). On July 7, 1991 Gertrude Blom celebrated her ninetieth birthday at her house "Na Bolom" (House of the Jaguar) in San Cristóbal de las Casas in Chiapas, Mexico. The Swiss eco-activist has been much involved in a project which will put an end to the serious damage caused by deforestation of the Lacandone rain forest and wich may serve as an example for further agreements on ecological matters. In an agreement unparalleled until now, between the private American environmentalist-organization "Conser vation International" and the Mexican government, the latter committed itself to save and protect the decreasing rain fores^ atthe Guatemalan border. In retum, Conservation Internatio nal will buy ffom Mexico's international creditors four million dollars worth of bonds and retire them. The money cornes ffom private donations and the action will help to decrease, if in small measure, Mexico's international debt. Düring the last decades, the pénétration of new settlers, the burning of the jungle, and its change into barren pastures have reduced the Lacandone rain forest today to only one third of its former area of 5,250 square miles. In future, the felling of trees will be subject to severe penalties and destroyed jungle areas will be reforested in time. Gertrude Blom has for many years fought by means of interviews, articles, books, and Conferences, against the destruction of the Selva Lacandona and in behalf of the Lacandon Indians who live in this environment, and so brought the problems to public attention and helped to bring about this unusual and encouraging conservation project. The Xkipché Archaeological Project BONN (H. J. Prem). In 1991, the Seminar für Völkerkunde of the University of Bonn, Germany, and the Centro Regional de Yucatán of the Mexican Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (INAH) started the first field season in the archaeological zone of Xkipché. Xkipché lies only nine kilometers south of Uxmal in the Puuc région and was first visited by Teobert Maler in 1894. Then, the site feil into oblivion until it was relocated a few years ago. The objective of the investigation is to evalúate and refine the postulated sequence and typology of Puuc style architecture by means of absolute and relative chronological methods. Xkipché was selected because this site of only medium size, contains a quite large and complex two-storied building which is relatively well preserved. The 1991 first field season of three months has already revealed that the constructional sequence of this structure, the so called"palace", is much more complex than expected. The building had not only been enlarged by the addition of lateral annexes, as has been supposed until now in case of several buildings of similar type in Yucatán, but it also underwent repeated further and more extensive modifications.

Other far reaching modifications made, generally were accompanied by a raising of floor levels. The building material of earlier structures was sorted and stored, to be reused in later constructions. At the same time as the excavations and study, the consolidation work on the two-storied building, which in some parts revealed dangerous defects in structural stability, were initiated. Outside the palace, a stratigraphie excavation was executed at the rim of the central plaza, and the topographical survey of the eight hectar core zone of Xkipché was initiated. Survey s to be carried out in the following field seasons will connect the Xkipché area with the régions around Oxkintoc and Sayil. An unpublished mural painting from Acanceh, Yucatan.

Japanese archaeologists to study Maya cultural origins GUATEMALA CITY (Prensa Libre). In February 1991, a Japanese scientific mission started an archaeological project, together with the Guatemalan Instituto de Etnología, Arqueología e Historia (IDEAH), directed toward the investigation of the cultural origins of Maya civilization. One of the goals is the relationship between the early Settlements on the Guatemalan south coast and the central Maya area; cultural relationships with the central Andes and other areas of the world will also be considered.

Deceased: Leo Paul Biese (1933-1991) Leo Biese, by profession a doctor of medicine, had already begun to develop an interest in archaeology during his studies attheUniversityof Missouri (A.B. 1955; M.D. 1960). Inthe course of his undergraduate years he also received some training in this field. After finishing his studies, he was em ployed by the Panama Canal Company at their Gorgas Hos pital in Balboa, whereupon he immediately joined a small fcgroup of amateur archaeologists which had formed a small Society in 1949 that in 1955 became "The Archaeological Society of Panama". Mostof the members were U.S. Ameri cans employed at the then "Canal Zone", but there were also some genuine Panamanians among them. It is possible that the enthusiasm of one of his collegues at the hospital, Russell H. Mitchell, who was very active in the society at that time, induced Leo to join. He quickly became one of its most active members, especially interested in the archaeology of Central Panama and of the forerunner of the early colonial site of Panama Viejo. Unfortunately, Leo had to leave the Canal Zone in the late 1963, never to return there again. Apart from his medical work as a pathologist, he continued, however, to be interested in Central and Mesoamerican archaeology: he published more results of his work in Panama, took some courses at Harvard University (1968/69), and in 1977/78 join ed a team from his old aima mater, the University of Missouri, for excavations on the Pacific coast of Guatemala, which resulted in further publications. In the early 80s Leo founded tthe Samual K. Lothrop Memorial Library Trust, situated in New Hampshire and named in honour of the "father of Central American archaeology". His purpose was to establish the Trust as a scientific resource centre on Central and Meso american archaeology, to facilítate the study of the above mentioned fields of archaeology for students in the Northern New England région. To this end he also incorporated into the Trust his own large library on Central and Mesoamerican archaeology. Right up to his death he endeavoured to keep up with new developments and pursued his own archaeological research, which centred on the idea of a southern origin for secondary um burials in Central and Mesoamerica, an idea he gained from correspondence with Sigvald Linné, and which never left him thereafter. Wolfgang Haberland From 1984 up to his untimely death, Leo Biese acted as the U.S. représentative for mexicon. During this period, and lar gely as a resuit of his efforts, the subscriptions of Mexicon in the U.S. rose to about half the entire circulation. The Western Hemisphere which he was responsible for, was among the best administered sections in Mexicon. His death on August 5,1991, coincides with a difficult period in Mexicon's exist ence. Leo's help and encouragement will be sorely missed.</page></plain_text>
