<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROBERT BUSH LEMELSON Departments of Psychology and Anthropology University of California, Los Angeles Traditional Healing and Its Discontents: Efficacy and Traditional Therapies of Neuropsychiatric Disorders in Bali In a discussion of patients suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and/or Tourettes's Syndrome (TS), in Bali, Indonesia, traditional healing and psychiatric perspectives are used to highlight the power and weakness of each to treat these conditions. Given they are drawn from the same culture, should not indigenous explanatory models provide meaning and be more efficacious at relieving the suffering ofpeople with OCD and TS-like symptoms? What if they provide an understandable meaning for patients but these meanings have no efficacy? Ethnographic data on Balinese models for illness are presented. Multi- ple data sources were used to frame the complex Balinese traditional healing systems. Forty patients were interviewed regarding their utiliza- tion of traditional healers, and healers were observed treating patients and interviewed regarding their treatment regimens and explanatory models. Traditional explanatory models for illness provide an under- standable and integrated system of meaning for these disorders but are not successful in relieving symptomatology. Neurobiological approaches, traditional healing, and ethnographic methods are compared and con- trasted to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each in relation to is- sues of exegesis and efficacy. [obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette's Syndrome, traditional healing, Indonesia] Interviewer (Lemelson-RBL): I need to understand, can you explain about your experience there, do you like or dislike the way the healer (dukun) treated you? Gusti: I like it.... Because of what he said, it seems that what he said is true, the disease is here like a stone,... it's painful. RBL: And the last time, when you saw different dukuns, they conducted cere- monies ... was the treatment the same or different? Gusti: Different. There was one who used incenses to smoke my face.... There was one who gave massage therapy, but different kind of massage ... he only massaged my stomach, not my breasts. RBL: Only your stomach ... MedicalAnthropology Quarterly 18(1):48-76.

He said it was to kill the disease. RBL: But, did it help? Gusti: No. I got burned on my skin because of the burning metal. RBL: If you compare him with dukuns in the past, is his method of treatment extraordinary? Was the massage is the same? Is it harder and more pain- ful than the previous ones? Gusti: The previous one was very rough, I screamed because of the pain. RBL: Was there any change after that? After the treatment? Gusti: On the following day, yes, maybe a little, but the day after, it came back. It did not disappear forever. [Interview with a patient with chronic Tourette's Syndrome, Bali, 2001] he cultural construction of meaning has been a central issue in contemporary anthropology (Shore 1996; Strauss and Quinn 1998). How sufferers of dif- ferent disorders understand, interpret, and narrate their suffering has also been explored at length (Kleinman 1989; Mattingly and Garro 2000). The con- struction of meaning, or its lack, is central to the phenomenology of certain neurop- sychiatric disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (Okasha et al. 1994; Rapoport 1989). How individuals make sense or meaning out of bizarre psycho- logical states that have meaninglessness as their defining characteristic has rarely been addressed. The assumption is that cultural meaning systems provide the basis for framing and interpreting all forms of experience, including psychopathology, and that this meaning construction is innately therapeutic. Traditional healing-its practitioners, explanatory models, and social con- texts-have been and remain a potent force in much of the world for providing multiple levels of meaning for illness and suffering. In this article, I grapple with the relationship of how the complex meaning systems provided by traditional heal- ing interpret, explain, and provide treatment approaches for patients suffering from two distinct but related neuropsychiatric disorders in Bali, Indonesia. In this re- gard, the question of efficacy (see Csordas 1998) and its relation to meaning needs to be addressed. What if these cultural models that provide meaning for disorder and suffering are not helpful at providing symptomatic relief, let alone cure? Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and Tourette's Syndrome Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is one of the most common mental ill- nesses. A disorder that was once seen as extremely rare is now thought to occur in two of every 100 Americans (Karno et al. 1988). The Epidemiologic Catchment Area Study shows a six-month point prevalence of about one and a half percent and a lifetime prevalence of two to three percent. In the United States alone, approxi- mately four million people are currently afflicted and several million more are at risk for future episodes. The prevalence estimate of OCD in children is at least two to four percent, and an even larger number may have subclinical OCD (Grados et al. 1997). Similar rates have been established internationally (Staley and Wand 1995), making OCD one of the most common major mental illnesses worldwide (Clarizio 1991). 49</page><page sequence="3">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY Although Tourette's Syndrome (TS) is less prevalent, interest and research in that disorder has increased markedly in the last decade. Once thought of as one of the rarest disorders (incidence of one in a million), TS is now recognized as occur- ring considerably more frequently. Although "pure" TS rates are still quite low (1.9 to 6.7 per 10,000 [Tanner and Goldman 1997]), when it is included with other, less serious tic disorders that occur in up to 25 percent of school-age children, it re- sults in tic disorders being regarded as among the most common childhood neurop- sychiatric afflictions. TS is particularly common in samples from child psychiatry clinics, where perhaps one child in ten has TS or a related neuropsychiatric tic dis- order. Again, the psychiatric epidemiologic literature suggests there are similar rates cross-culturally (Staley et al. 1997).' OCD, characterized by generally intrapsychic repetitive thoughts, and TS, with its bizarre movements and vocalizations, seem unrelated on the surface. How- ever, neurobiological research conducted in the last two decades shows them to be related disorders from a number of perspectives. Clinical research has documented a multidirectional overlap between TS and OCD from familial-genetic, pheno- menological, comorbidity, and natural history perspectives. Statistically, patients with TS have a high comorbidity with OCD, ranging from 30 to 90 percent. Ge- netic studies show strong familial patterns for both disorders (Steingard and Dillon Stout 1992). Although early studies of OCD and TS (see Berrios 1989) theorized about po- tential biological mechanisms underlying these disorders, this approach was aban- doned with the ascension of psychoanalysis. Not until the biological revolution in psychiatry and neuroscience in the 1980s did the pendulum swing back to an inter- est in the neurological basis for these illnesses. Indeed, OCD went from being (in Freudian terms) the most symbolic and psychodynamically based disorder to one of the most biological. Given increasingly sophisticated understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms, the efficacy of chemotherapeutic treatment, and the perceived failure of psychodynamic (as opposed to cognitive-behavioral) psycho- therapy to alleviate the symptoms of these disorders, many researchers have a strong, biologically deterministic perspective on OCD. In terms of patient care and relief of suffering, this biological emphasis has been generally positive. Through the use of a biological model, suffering has been greatly reduced and psychosocially the bizarre symptoms have been partially des- tigmatized. The biological account of TS and OCD is robust and has a high heuris- tic in terms of efficacy and relief of suffering of patients afflicted with these disor- ders. Current psychiatric treatment of these disorders in the West focuses on cogni- tive-behavioral psychotherapy and/or psychotropic medication. However, in much of the developing world such therapies are either unavailable, or, if available, are prohibitively expensive for the vast majority of people. Defining OCD The following description, drawn from the DSM-IV, defines the essential fea- tures of OCD as recurrent obsessions or compulsions that are severe enough to be time consuming (consume more than one hour per day) or cause marked distress or 50</page><page sequence="4">TRADITIONAL HEALING AND ITS DISCONTENTS significant impairment. The person understands that the obsessions or compul- sions are disproportionate or irrational. Obsessions are persistent ideas, thoughts, impulses, or images that are experi- enced as intrusive and inappropriate and that cause marked anxiety or distress. The content of the obsession is experienced as alien, beyond the patient's control, and undesirable. The patient is able to recognize that the obsessions are the product of his or her own mind and are not imposed from without, differentiating OCD from some cognitive processes in disorders like schizophrenia, delusional disorder, and other psychoses. The thoughts, impulses, or images are not simply excessive wor- ries about real-life problems (e.g., concerns about current ongoing difficulties in life, such as financial, work, or school problems) and are unlikely to be related to a real-life problem. Compulsions are repetitive behaviors (for example, hand washing, ordering, and checking) or mental acts (for example, praying, counting, and repeating words silently), the goal of which is to prevent or reduce anxiety or distress, not to provide pleasure or gratification. In most cases, the person feels driven to perform the com- pulsion to reduce the distress that accompanies an obsession or to prevent some dreaded event or situation. Tourette's Syndrome Similar to how OCD sufferers are compelled to act out their compulsions to relieve anxiety arising from an obsession, TS sufferers are involuntarily plagued by multiple motor tics and one or more vocal tics. These may appear simultane- ously or at different periods during the illness. The tics occur many times a day. The disturbance causes marked distress or significant impairment in social, occu- pational, or other important areas of functioning.2 The anatomical location, number, frequency, complexity, and severity of the tics change over time. The tics typically involve the head and, frequently, other parts of the body such as the torso and upper and lower limbs. Vocal tics include various words or sounds such as clicks, grunts, yelps, barks, sniffs, snorts, and coughs. Coprolalia, a complex vocal tic involving the uttering of obscenities, ranges from a low of 4 percent (in a Japanese sample) to upward of 60 percent in other samples (Staley and Wand 1995). Complex motor tics involving touching, squatting, deep knee bends, retracing steps, and twirling when walking may occur. In approximately one-half of the people with this disorder, the first symptoms to appear are bouts of a single tic-eye blinking, most frequently, and less frequently, tics involving another part of the face or the body. Initial symptoms can also in- clude tongue protrusion, squatting, sniffing, hopping, skipping, throat clearing, stuttering, uttering sounds or words, and coprolalia. Typical age of onset (or when symptoms are first recognized as abnormal) occurs at seven years. The disorders map onto the patient's experience, and the related cultural mod- els that this experience3 is embedded in, in complex ways. In this regard, the condi- tions Latah and Kesambet are explored below. A culturally informed reader may wonder at the overlap between TS and Latah. Latah is a culture-bound syndrome found throughout Southeast Asia. Sometimes called the hyperstartle syndrome or startle-matching taxon, Latah in- volves a hypersensitivity to sudden stimulation or fright, with associated behaviors 51</page><page sequence="5">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY including echopraxia, echolalia, coprolalia, and dissociative response. Although the proper interpretation of its etiology is debated, most agree that differing con- structions of this disorder occur in widely varying cultural settings (e.g., Southeast Asia, Siberia, Ainu, 19th-century French-Canadians; see Simons [1996] for a com- plete review). Jilek (1994) notes that even in the 19th century, neurologists noticed a pheno- menological similarity between TS and Latah; and Gilles de la Tourette himself er- roneously assumed Latah-type reactions to be cases of TS, a belief echoed by later psychological anthropologists (see Devereux 1980). Although the Balinese recog- nize Latah, it is not as common as in other areas of Indonesia, such as Java, and has apparently declined in frequency in the last two decades (Simons 1996). In explor- ing this issue, I asked patients and families if they thought TS behaviors were re- lated to Latah or Gigian (Balinese for Latah). Family members of children with TS clearly differentiated TS and Latah. Another potentially confounding culture-bound syndrome that could be re- lated to TS in Bali is called Kesambet. Shock, fright, or soul loss is believed to cause this childhood illness. According to Wikan's (1989) research in northern Bali, when a mother is startled (terkejut) or becomes strongly emotional, her milk can become soured and the child will subsequently fall sick. However, like Suryani and Jensen's (1992) research on southern Bali, I did not find that Kesambet was used or invoked as an explanatory model for TS-like behavior. Although it is clear that Kesambet and Latah seem descriptively related in some ways to certain aspects of TS and OCD, it is also clear that there are no spe- cific indigenous analogs that correlate with the complex phenomenology that suf- ferers with these disorders experience. One would think, however, that the scope of traditional healing's contexts, beliefs, and practices should provide comprehensive enough explanatory models to be inclusive of the symptomatology of these syn- dromes. Traditional Healing of Neuropsychiatric Disorders: Meaning and the Issue of Efficacy "The obvious and inevitable question that arises in any consideration of relig- ious healing is 'Does it work?' ... One often gets the impression that for most authors the issue of efficacy is addressed almost as an afterthought, and often un- duly taken for granted." (Csordas and Lewton 1998:493) Given that many patients in the developing world rely on traditional healing in seeking relief from the chronic symptoms of these disorders (Desjarlais et al. 1996:54), the following questions must be asked: What is the proper role for in- digenous explanatory models in an analysis of a neuropsychiatric disorder? How effective are indigenous explanatory models in explaining these illnesses? And be- cause these models are drawn from the same culture as are the sufferers of these disorders, should they not provide meaning and be more effective at relieving the suffering of people with OCD-like symptoms? How efficacious are traditional healers in both treating either the disease or illness (Kleinman 1991)? Some, such as Jilek (1993) argue that traditional healing is at least as effective and frequently more so than moder medical and psychiatric approaches for a variety of disorders, including various mood disorders, psychosomatic and somatoform 52</page><page sequence="6">TRADITIONAL HEALING AND ITS DISCONTENTS syndromes, acute or reactive psychotic states, and alcohol and drug dependence. He notes further that traditionally healed patients' experiences are restructured through a culturally validated system of symbols and meanings; the perceived eti- ological act, agent, or person is identified and a course of remedial or protective ac- tion taken. Jilek believes that this naming process has significant therapeutic as- pects and often causes symptom remission by itself. Jilek and others (Keyes 1985) imply that the more traditional healers are able to help make meaning out of the "text" of an illness episode; they are more equipped to cure it. This fits well with anthropological notions that exploring a cul- ture's explanatory models, structures of meaning, belief systems, and so forth, will generate a more meaningful and efficacious way to look at illness experience. But what if no local categories fit these types of illness? Although the phenomenology of psychopathology is always sifted through complex cultural meaning systems in- volving differing constructions of person, self, and emotion, it does not necessarily follow that indigenous explanatory models have an elaborated category for fram- ing and explaining such experiences. What if the indigenous explanations are not syntonic with the phenomenological reality of differing psychopathological states, such as the repetitive, meaningless cognitions of OCD? How do different disorders intersect with different explanatory models? Adding to this complexity are four different perspectives through these disor- ders can be understood and interpreted. The first is the meaning and construction of the syndrome from the sufferer's perspective. Individuals differ in their situated understandings and interpretations of symptomatology. The second is the prevail- ing cultural models used to understand and find meaning in the symptoms. The third perspective is that of local experts, often belonging to but not restricted to such categories as traditional healers or religious or ritual specialists, who provide explanatory models for the disorders. The fourth perspective entails framing these symptoms in light of theories on the nature of Balinese culture and its relation to individual experience. These are alternative ways to interpret neuropsychiatric syndromes cross-cul- turally. The understanding of the illness experience and the explanatory models used to construct meaning are not isomorphic in these different perspectives. Alter- nate framings such as this are crucial in contextualizing a syndrome beyond the bi- nary opposition of psychiatric models, as opposed to indigenous theories of disease and healing. Given this complexity, I propose two basic positions in this article. The first (unsurprising to most psychiatrists, unacceptable to some anthropologists) is that a psychiatric perspective is indispensable to understanding and treating disorders such as OCD and TS. It is indispensable precisely because it can offer relief from suffering, even considering the problems associated with "the professional trans- formation of suffering" (Kleinman 1991). Conversely, if the explanatory models that traditional healers in Bali use to explain OCD-like symptoms do not offer di- rect help to the patient, what should we make of their "transformation of suffer- ing"? What if patients choose pathways of healing that offer no symptomatic re- lief? Even with the complex issues and problems associated with the cultural hegemony of psychiatry and biomedicine, should Western psychiatric perspectives by default be invoked as the most salient model for treatment in cross-cultural con- texts? For some patients, in some contexts, with these disorders, psychiatry's 53</page><page sequence="7">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY reductive, essentializing, and universalizing treatment approaches really can help alleviate their suffering. This said, however, it is clear that central aspects of the symptomatology of these disorders in Bali cannot be explained or understood if a psychiatric explana- tory model is the only model used. Balinese culture shapes the phenomenology of illness in ways that fundamentally alter the presentation of these disorders. Ethno- graphic methods and approaches must be used to help explain their culturally unique aspects. In this article, I explore a model for a combined approach that fur- thers the cross-cultural understanding of these disorders while allowing their fun- damental cultural expression to complete our situated understanding of both their culturally contextualized and inherently biological nature (Hay, personal commu- nication). Subjects and Case-Finding Methodology The data were gathered as part of a larger fieldwork project exploring cultural aspects of mental illness in Indonesia.4 The data for this article are drawn from fieldwork I did in Bali over a 20-month period in 1996-97. WHO funded this re- search to find cases of OCD in non-Western contexts. Cases of OCD were gathered by the following means. I made presentations on OCD and TS to groups of pedia- tricians, neurologists, cardiologists, and psychiatrists. I conducted meetings at the Department of Psychiatry at Wangaya Hospital, at that time the only inpatient treatment facility in the Balinese capital of Denpasar, and I made a presentation to a group of pediatricians at Sanglah Hospital, the central hospital in Denpasar. All of these were done in Bahasa, Indonesia. I also sent out letters describing the pro- ject to these doctors. Further, I conducted a survey of ten Puskesmas (small com- munity health centers, generally staffed by nurses and a general practitioner) and of 15 traditional healers, balians (the Balinese term) and dukuns (the more generic In- donesian term).5 To gauge whether these disorders were seen at Puskesmas, I created a semi- structured questionnaire that described OCD and probed whether any of the health care workers had treated or seen patients with OCD symptoms. For the most part (much as Rapoport [1989] describes in the United States over a decade ago), there was a general sense of unfamiliarity of most health care professionals, traditional healers, and workers in the Puskemas with the clinical characteristics of OCD. I gathered 40 potential respondents by this methodology, 36 of whom were drawn from the clinical case notes of Dr. I. G. Putu Panteri, a psychiatrist with a private psychiatric hospital who collaborated closely on this research. Dr. Panteri had treated all of these patients, usually with a combination of pharmacotherapy and supportive psychotherapy. All patients were given a full psychiatric workup. Respondents were contacted and I conducted follow-up interviews in their homes. Most of the respondents, reflecting the demographics of Bali, lived in small vil- lages scattered around the island. I reinterviewed a smaller subsample of six sub- jects for three to five follow-up sessions of one and a half to two hours, utilizing a person-centered ethnographic approach (Hollan and Wellankamp 1994). 54</page><page sequence="8">TRADITIONAL HEALING AND ITS DISCONTENTS Assessment and Diagnosis of Subjects We originally diagnosed patients using both the DSM-IV and International Classification of Disease 10th revision (ICD- 10) definitions for OCD. OCD symp- tomatology was further gauged from items drawn from the Comprehensive Inter- national Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), recently translated and then being validated in Indonesia) and from the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). The Y-BOCS is a detailed instrument that probes for various forms of OCD symptomatology and rates degrees of severity from such factors as the degree of control over obsessions/compulsions, time spent on obsessions/compulsion, etc. It was translated into Bahasa Indonesia (b.i.) by an English professor at a local uni- versity with my help. It was back translated by another professor, and the discrep- ancies were discussed and resolved. As the Y-BOCS had not yet been validated in Indonesia, we used it primarily as a symptom checklist. It was remarkably useful for this purpose. The decision to translate the instrument into b.i. was based on the fact that the local language, Bahasa Bali (b.b.), is a status-based language with multiple levels based on the situated understandings of the people involved. Theoretically, b.b. consists of low (rendah or kasar), middle (lumrah or biasa), and high (b.i. halus) levels. In addition, a separate language (Singgih) is used for formal religious occa- sions, addressing royalty, and certain types of theater. However, in practice, these levels need to be adjusted for areas based on status (age, caste, gender, employer, etc.), self-referential speech, and the content of speech. Thus, when talking to a person of higher status, one must speak high or polite Balinese, except when, for example, referring to oneself in speech, in which case a lower form would be more appropriate. The Balinese, particularly older Balinese, can be quite sensitive to the nuances and status meanings of the Balinese language. Therefore, the translation into Balinese would have been exceedingly problematic, entailing several ver- sions. Bahasa Indonesia, which is not a status-based language, provided a means of avoiding such problems. In addition, because it is a national language, everyone we interviewed-with the exception of very young children and, to a lesser extent, older people-spoke it fluently. In actuality, the interviews were often conducted in a mix of b.i. and b.b. I am fluent in Indonesian and understand conversational Balinese. If a phrase from the Y-BOCS was unclear, its meaning would be discussed among the patient, family, anthropologist, psychiatrist, and research assistant. This methodology has prob- lems and benefits. It aided in discussion and clarification of the symptoms, but some of the semantic differences of interest could have been lost. Whenever possi- ble, the b.i. and b.b words were included. Our diagnostic procedure involved several steps. After possible cases were identified from case logs and clinical notes, we held a meeting with the referring psychiatrist and discussed the case. A research assistant then contacted the subject at his or her home to request permission for a follow-up interview. If permission was received, we (Dr. I. G. P. Panteri, a research assistant, and I) went to the family compound and conducted an extensive, semi-structured interview. We used the translated Y-BOCS, the portion of the CIDI relevant to OCD, and the DSM and ICD diagnostic criteria. We also elicited demographic data and information on the 55</page><page sequence="9">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY symptoms, age at onset, course, associated features, treatment history, and re- sponse to treatment of the disorder. In addition to the clinical data gathered through the Y-BOCS and the CIDI, we examined other psychocultural factors. These were: (1) the role of life events in the onset of symptoms; (2) the nature and severity of specific impairments and so- cial disabilities; (3) the influence of family members' perceptions of the patient's behavior in the course of the disorder; (4) the type and duration of treatment re- ceived, including treatment by traditional healers; and (5) culturally unique or spe- cific symptom presentation, following Kleinman's (1989) suggestion of clinical "mini-ethnography." After each interview, the case was discussed with the clini- cians involved, and a diagnosis was derived from this material based on the diag- nostic criteria of the DSM-IV and ICD-10. Our combination of the use of the Y- BOCS, the CIDI, and a more open-ended, person-centered approach to get at both universal and culturally specific aspects of the patients' array of symptoms was de- signed to counter objections that we had succumbed to the category fallacy. After each interview, the case was discussed with the clinicians involved, and a diagnosis was derived from this material based on the diagnostic criteria of the DSM-IV and ICD-10. The data were coded and analyzed utilizing the Non-numerical Unstructured Data Indexing Searching and Theorizing (NUD-IST) program. In the 20 months of my fieldwork, I met with, interviewed, and conducted participant observation with approximately 20 healers and explored issues around their notions of illness causation and treatment. In the latter half of my fieldwork, I picked a sample of five healers whom I visited and interviewed at length over a number of months. I tried to pick a sample of healers who represented the range of healing practices or specialties of healers in Bali,6 including the following: balian usadha: high-caste male healers who read sacred ethnomedical texts balian metuan or tapakan: a spirit medium, who channels gods, ancestors balian apun: masseurs balian kebal: practitioner of mystical or martial arts balian tenung: diviners [see Lemelson 1999 for a further discussion of balians] Four of the five had treated OCD or TS patients in my sample. In addition, I observed four of the six subjects in my research as they visited, consulted, and re- ceived treatment from different healers and I engaged with them in person-cen- tered ethnography. I interviewed them afterward about their experience at the heal- ers, their beliefs as to its efficacy (or lack thereof), and their further plans for future treatment by this or another healer. TS/OCD Research in Bali: Sample Characteristics The average age of the patients in the OCD sample was 39.9 years old, with a standard deviation of 16. The youngest patient in the OCD subsample was 17, the oldest 66. The average age of onset was 32.8, with a standard deviation of 15.2. The youngest onset occurred at age 11, with the oldest at 61. The average duration of illness was seven years, with a standard deviation of 7.8. The longest-lasting ill- ness was of 32 years. The mean Y-BOCS was 26.6, with a standard deviation of 6.0. The age of the patients showed a positive correlation with the severity of 56</page><page sequence="10">TRADITIONAL HEALING AND ITS DISCONTENTS symptomatology. There was also a positive correlation with age, the severity of the time spent on obsessions, the interference from obsessions, the distress induced by compulsions, and the control exerted over them. Fifteen subjects had other lifetime psychiatric diagnoses. Eight of the patients with the primary diagnosis of OCD had additional diagnoses, while seven of the TS cases had additional diagnoses, including two with OCD. The most glaring gender difference was that the seven pure OCD cases were all males. Two women had both OCD and TS.7 OCD, TS, and Balinese Explanatory Models of Illness and Health This section explores the explanatory models that traditional healers invoke to give structure and meaning to patients with OCD and TS syndromes in Bali. To understand these explanatory models, the reader must have an understanding of traditional Balinese "medicine." The first section introduces the Balinese tradi- tional healing system. Introduction to Balinese Traditional Healing Systems In Bali, traditional healing and indigenous theories of disease are complex and widely used. In Indonesia as a whole, traditional or ethnomedical medical practitioners are frequently consulted in complement of allopathic medical care (Ferzacca 2001; Setyonegoro 1983 ). Even contemporarily, in some areas they are the only forms of treatment (Hay 2003). In Bali, a strong syncretism exists between traditional and allopathic medical care. Thong (1993) notes that 70 percent of pa- tients went to a modem health facility before going to a traditional healer. Indige- nous Balinese medicine remains a prominent-for some afflictions, the predomi- nant-component in healthcare (Heinze 1988). The system is diverse and pluralistic, with many categories of indigenous healers operating under a spectrum of disease theories. Hinduism, Islam (especially in northern Bali but more gener- ally since the inception of the Indonesian state), and even pre-Hindu Indic influ- ences have also importantly shaped Balinese medical systems (Connor et al. 1986; Hobart 1997). European allopathic medicine is also an influence. Bali, at least southern Bali, was one of the last regions in the Indonesian archipelago conquered under Dutch colonialism. Subsequently, Western biomedicine was later in coming and initially much less influential than on many of the other islands in the archipelago. When it did arrive, Western "cosmopolitan" medicine rapidly gained in prominence and by the first decade of the 20th century, the official government-sponsored medical system was, for the most part, based on it. This system is utilized in conjunction with numerous models of traditional healing (Connor 1982b; McCauley 1984a). Traditional medical practices have maintained remarkable stability in the 100 years of detailed ethnographic observation in Bali (Hobart 1997). Even after the in- troduction of a modem medical system, with its network of Puskesmas and hospi- tals, traditional healers continue to draw a large client base. Balians and dukuns are traditional healers whose activities include healing of illness plus specialization in religious ceremonies, sorcery, counsel of bereaved family members through the channeling of deceased relatives' spirits, as well as 57</page><page sequence="11">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY advice and charms for attracting or keeping lovers (Connor et al. 1986; McCauley 1984a, 1984b). Numerous categories of balians with various types of roles, stat- uses, and knowledge exist. Given this extensive literature on traditional healing in Bali (Connor 1982a; Connor et al. 1986; Hobart 1997; McCauley 1984a; Wikan 1990), I have attempted to create a skeletal summary rather than an ethnographic exploration of Balinese traditional healing. The purpose is to bring into relief some of the common ex- planatory models used by dukuns and balians and relate these to how meaning is constructed for the symptoms of OCD and TS. A number of common explanatory models are used by dukuns in Balinese tra- ditional healing. With differing degrees of importance, humoral theories, hot-cold dichotomies, biomedical models, possession, sorcery, magic, violations of relig- ious and moral norms (including the improper enactment of rituals), and spirit in- trusion, imbalance, or disharmony in the patient's environment all have a place in Balinese folk theories involving the causes, symptomatology, treatment, and out- come of illness (Lovric 1992; McCauley 1984a; Ruddick 1986). Although this list- ing is obviously abbreviated, it serves as a broad, but adequate, introductory out- line of Balinese disease theory. Below I present a greater explication of these explanatory models. The data are drawn from a search of the literature, my field notes, and quotes from tradi- tional healers whom I interviewed. In addition, where relevant, I include quotes from respondents in the clinical study to demonstrate their understanding of these models. Broad Philosophical Organizing Features of Balinese Healing A number of distinctions have been proposed for understanding Balinese ex- planatory models for traditional healing. As in many ethnomedical systems, per- sonalistic explanations play an important role (Foster and Anderson 1978). The Balinese distinguish between two major categories of illness: those caused by some factor of the physical environment, such as food or weather, and those di- rectly and intentionally caused by another party, whether human, demonic, or di- vine (Ruddick 1986). Other binary oppositions are commonly cited as underlying Balinese notions of disease and health. Numerous authors (Eisman 1990; Jensen and Suryani 1992; Thong 1993) have commented that the most central ordering principle of Balinese cosmology is the distinction between buana alit (little world) and buana agung (literally, great world) and the Niskala (the unseen world) and sekala (the visible world). Another distinction that is parsed differently for the Balinese as opposed to Western psychiatry is the difference between physical and mental illness (Hobart 1997). He notes that numerous problems like family issues, inheritance problems, villagewide issues of conflict, and "distress arising out of uncertainty or unfulfilled wishes in almost any sphere-political, economic, romantic or artistic" fall under the latter category (p. 172). Another broad cultural conceptualization believed to underlie explanatory models of health and illness is the kanda mpat, or four sibling spirits. Each child is born with these spirits, and each controls both demonically related vice (bajangs) and positive aspects of one's personality (Lansing 1995). Many lontar (sacred 58</page><page sequence="12">TRADITIONAL HEALING AND ITS DISCONTENTS texts) are discourses on the nature, care, and strengthening of these "four siblings." These forces are personified and have multivalent symbolic connotations. Ruddick (1986) notes that the kanda mpat are perceived to be very potent agents with the power to harm or aid, depending on their treatment. Thus, the kanda mpat can be powerful disease-causing agents. Although some (see Eisman 1990; Ruddick 1986) state that the spiritually potent concept of kanda mpat is rarely discussed or referenced outside of life cycle rituals, I found it discussed in several different clinical settings in the OCD/TS sample, in conversations between healers and pa- tients. The use of the kanda mpat can be seen in the following transcript. The set- ting is an interview between a psychiatrist and a mother and father about the behav- ior of their son who has TS and who has been fighting with peers at school and with siblings at home.8 Psychiatrist: Was there any disturbance from the brother? I mean, I asked about kanda mpat because it's common in Bali. Father: Well, maybe the Ari-Ari [afterbirth] was disturbed. [The brother] didn't care for the Ari-Ari at home. P: Did you ask the dukun about this? F: We did. P: What was its [the spirit's] request? F: It was that he had been purified directly at the temple. Mother: The dukun said he had to be purified, paid, and be given holy water in cemetery. P: After he was purified [di-Bayuh], was there any change? F: After several days, it relapsed again like this. Disharmony and Imbalance in a Culturally Constituted Behavioral Environment Howe (1984) notes that different, interrelated aspects of Balinese cosmology and ethnopsychology are structured by ideals of balance, order, and equilibrium. This idea of the need for harmony is related to illness beliefs that link the experi- ence and/or expression of disturbing emotions to serious physical and mental ail- ments (H. Geertz 1961, cited in Hollan and Wellankamp 1994). This concern with balance and harmony, order and disorder (see Heider 1997) is offset by the concern with witchcraft and the "paranoid ethos" (Schwartz 1973) it implies. Among the Toraja, Hollan and Wellankamp (1994) note "the emphasis on social harmony and non-aggression that coexists with interpersonal cautious- ness and mistrust ... the cultural emphasis on 'order,' constraint, and smooth inter- personal relationships" (1994:217). This harmony is not effortless and comes at a psychic cost, as Wikan (1989) so elegantly documents. References to these con- cepts can be found throughout lontar texts that the Balian Usadha use to diagnose and treat illness (Nala 1996) In my research, subjects did refer to these notions of balance. One patient in the OCD study discussed this idea in relation to his onset of illness and the after-ef- fects of this sense of unbalance. He stated that he constantly felt "unbalanced" [b.i. kesimbangan] and began to have obsessions about forgetting to take his medicine and subsequent catastrophic illnesses. Another patient, when he could not remember the license plate of a car that had passed by, felt dizzy (b.i. pusing) and disoriented. 59</page><page sequence="13">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY A different central idea related to the concept of balance, frequently cited as being salient to Balinese cultural meanings around health and illness, is the notion of a vital life force, or bayu. This concept, shared throughout insular and mainland Southeast Asia, is seen as present in all matter, both alive and dead. However, it is a force that is sensitive to disturbance and can be depleted through startle, fear, or other disturbance of balance. Bayu needs to be gede (strong or large) to maintain health. It is also related to notions of health and emotion. The interaction of these forces is exemplified by the following dukun's statement about an OCD patient whom he had seen: "For curing the patient, I use bayu, Sabda [Holy Word], buana agung, buana alit, and the tri sakti [three faces of God]." Problems in the Physical Environment and in Astrological/Calendrical Systems Related to notions of balance and harmony and order and disorder is the idea that proper spatial organization helps align the buana agung and buana alit. Orien- tation of buildings, notions of pollution and purity in relation to body organization, and the importance of proper orientations of social relations and hierarchy have long been cited as principle organizing features of Balinese culture (Eisman 1990; Geertz 1973, 1975; Mead and Bateson 1942). The symbolic connections are nu- merous. The hypercognization in Balinese culture around "calendrical notions" (Geertz 1973) penetrates Balinese notions of health, illness, and personality. Field notes from an OCD patient also support this notion: I only went one time to a dukun for help with my problem. He told me that there were problems with my birth date, and that I needed to make an offering [b.b. ban- ten meluasang]. The dukun said because my birth date was keras [harsh or strong] I had to make this offering [Karena kelahiran keras maka minta bantennya]. The symbolic placement of offerings for the gods or ancestral spirits (linggih and merajan) is a common form of cultural therapy for illness related to balance and orientation of environment. Reorganizing the spatial arrangement to create balance with the ancestors in both the Niskala and sekala is a key to this. A father of a boy with TS stated the following: I'm also confused and not sure of what I'm supposed to do. The dukun said that something had disturbed [the spirit of house yard]. My yard has lost its care- taker/watchman [referring to the spirit]. It was because we moved the old house to the north, and we didn't pay this [spirit] proper attention. He said I had to make an offering to the spirit that was disturbed. After that I paid, but I didn't notice any improvement [in my son]. Humoral and Hot-Cold Distinction Another example that reveals the interrelated quality of explanatory mecha- nisms in Balinese ethnomedical theories is the hot-cold distinction (Laderman 1992). Humoral theory, seen as the "theoretical infrastructure" (Golomb 1985:83) of most Malay herbalists, is central to notions of illness and health. Illness is per- ceived as a disruption of the elemental humors. These distinctions are again related to notions of order and disorder, balance and unbalance, controlled and uncon- trolled. Hollan notes that strong emotions are hot and that this is "antithetical to the 60</page><page sequence="14">TRADITIONAL HEALING AND ITS DISCONTENTS 'coolness' of health" (1988:58). The Balinese interrelate hot-cold notions with be- liefs surrounding illness, health, and emotion (Wikan 1989). A dukun described the interrelationship between humoral notions of health, illness, and the Niskala, in his analysis of a young girl with TS: The body condition is not good because the weather disrupts the balance between the body and the environment. For example, in the rainy season, the earth and sky are cold; it also makes the head and the foot cool and the stomach hot, and if [peo- ple] eat cold food, the reaction between warm stomach and cold food will cause illness. This dukun went on to describe his diagnostic process: When I take care of the patient, I check them directly by facing them and checking their eyes. If the color of the eyes is yellow, it means their condition is hot. If the color of the eyes is red it means the condition is hotter, which is bad; and if blue color, it means cool. Proper balance of hot and cold food is very important to sup- port the proper function of the system of the body. If the body does not get good nutrition, it makes the bayu of the body weak. Hence, disease will come more eas- ily to the body and make the body function with a lot of problems. Sorcery/Poisoning by Envious Neighbors or Family Members Throughout Southeast Asia, it is widely believed that a person with an intent to harm others can use a spirit or substance (Murdock 1970). Hollan and Wel- lankamp (1994:166), in their ethnography on the Toraja of central Sulawesi, note that being a victim of magic was one of the four most prevalent interpersonal con- cerns and anxieties. They describe the three common classes of illness that have analogues in Bali: sakit biasa, ordinary illness such as boils or headaches; sakit deata, caused by violations of ritual prescriptions and prohibitions; and sakit tolino, human illnesses caused by poison introduced through magical spells, into food or drink or on a pathway. Similarly, Laderman (1992) discusses a similar dif- ferentiation between biasa (usual) and luar biasa (unusual) illnesses in peninsular Malaysia. These distinctions are remarkably similar in Bali and point to a regional hypercognization of magic and sorcery. In Bali, no one term can encompass all practices placed under the broad head- ing of sorcery and witchcraft (Ellen and Watson 1993). Rather, a number of di- verse terms are used to refer to different aspects of sorcery and magic. Ruddick (1986) notes that many Balinese believe that balians may use black magic to cause illness at the behest of someone who harbors a grudge against, is jealous of, or has been spured by the victim.9 Dukuns are often consulted to determine the source of illness thought to be caused by sorcery or poisoning. Depending on the type of dukun, they can have elaborate taxonomies and explanatory models for poisoning and witchcraft. Sorcery was frequently invoked as a cause of problems for OCD patients. Be- low is an excerpt from my field notes: Another [dukun] stated that Pak Sudiasih was obviously the victim of black magic. Pak Sudiasih searched for a balian who was an expert in black magic [b.i. ilmu hitam/magis] who could protect him from the sorcery that he believed was the cause of his condition. He received a magical golden amulet [b.i. susuk] that 61</page><page sequence="15">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY the balian had interwoven with magic words [b.i. mantra-mantra]. The balian also conducted a lengthy purification ceremony made with elaborate offerings. All of this was quite expensive [over Rp. 100,000]. Sorcery is seen to be easier when a person's bayu is weak because of other problems. A dukun stated, "The process of people becoming bewitched is easier when their bayu is weak and they cannot resist the magic; at that time, it is easy for the magic to go through." Sorcery is seen to cause emotional upset and is also in- voked in interpersonal communication problems. Business competition is fre- quently cited as a cause of witchcraft. Although some ambivalence exists about the reality and degree of magic in- fluencing the lives of typical Balinese, the belief in and fear of magic and sorcery is a recurrent theme for those struck with disease. For example, one OCD patient in my research could not return home because of the fear of sorcery. He went to a dukun, who treated him with holy water (tirta) and a purification ceremony but still advised him to stay at his uncle's house in a distant village. He did not return home for over six months. A dukun explained it as follows: For example, the man is interested in a pretty girl; but the girl didn't like him, and it made the man hurt and very sad and angry. The man goes for help to a dukun who does black magic. The dukun will help him if he gives him a certain amount of money. The dukun then uses the black magic power. Some of them do it using the oil of the tears of the duyung fish. With the oil in his hand, he touches the woman's hand so the oil will go onto her body. The man rubs the woman's skin. A few days later, the woman begins to always think about the man and wants to see him. She will become crazy just wanting to see him. If she couldn't see him, it would make her nervous; if she cannot handle her emotions about seeing that man, she becomes crazy and always calls out the man's name. People said 'Nak luh kene guna' [the woman is crazy due to bewitching by a man with magic]. Improper Enactment of Ritual and Subsequent Offending of Spirits Throughout Southeast Asia, illness is often seen as a punishment for offenses against the many spirits that inhabit the village and surrounding countryside. These spirits are believed to cause illness or emotional or interpersonal problems when they have not been sufficiently propitiated with offerings or are made upset with improper placement of buildings or by a ceremony done incorrectly or not at all. Considering the complexity of the Balinese ritual calendar, this is almost inevita- ble. In Bali, there are numerous classes of spirits that must be propitiated on a daily basis. (See Wiener [1995] for an explication of the gods of the Balinese pan- theon and their relation to each other.) The Balinese culturally constituted behav- ioral environment regarding spirits is wide and deep. Spirits are seen in ritual per- formance forms, such as the topeng (opera) and wayang kulit (skin puppet) performances. Spirits are included in the plots of television shows produced in In- donesia, such as the Denpasar Moon, which was popular in 1996-97. This show featured a banci (an Indonesian cross-dresser or transgendered person) who is also a ghost. Spirits are also involved in many art forms, such as paintings and wood- carvings. 62</page><page sequence="16">TRADITIONAL HEALING AND ITS DISCONTENTS Of more direct relevance than the higher gods are the deities and spirits of lo- cal shrines, village temples, and ancestors that inhabit the family compound and re- side in the family temple. In addition, a class of spirits, the buta-kala, manifest themselves in destructive ways. In addition to the buta-kala, numerous spirits and ghosts inhabit rivers, graveyards, ravines, and banyan trees. These have various names (wong samar, rohjahat, tonya, memedi) and have different attributes. This type of complex spirit taxonomy is common throughout Southeast Asia. Classes of spirits are also related to Balinese ethnopsychological constructs of emotion and dysphoria certain states of mind and emotional feelings. Howe (1984) notes that, unlike the higher gods, these spirits are named in a very specific fashion: kala kilang kilung (bewildered), kala dangastra (angered), kala peteng (confused), and so forth. This understanding can be seen in the following dialogue with a dalang, a puppet master endowed with spiritual powers. Puppeteer: Here in Bali, there are a lot of Memedi. They include the Tuyul, Wong Samar, and Tonya. They are ghosts. RBL: Do they disturb or help? P: It depends. Sometimes they help, but sometimes they eat us too. For in- stance, if we have a deal with them and we betray them, they will disturb us; but if we keep our promise, they will help us. RBL: So, we must give offerings? P: Yes, offerings, daily or monthly. RBL: If not? P: They disturb us. RBL: Disturb us so that we go crazy? P: We can suffer from mental illness or physical illness that can't be cured, and we finally die. An OCD patient discussed the following dukun's explanation for her condi- tion, demonstrating the problems that arise if proper offerings are not given to gods or spirits or if placement of the house yard is improper: The dukun stated that I became sick because of a nonmedical problem, that is, my ancestral spirit made me sick. He said it was because I didn't make the proper rit- ual ceremony for her house. Before we built our house, it was a rice paddy and Dewi Sri [the god who manages the rice] still lived there. He said we should have made a ritual ceremony to move God Sri. He stated I would recover after making the proper offerings. The use of the offended-spirit explanatory model was frequent in the OCD cases. Reincarnation/Inheritance of Ancestor's Characteristics or Flaws Reincarnation (punarbhawa) or continual rebirth into the world until one at- tains the perfect life and is unified with God is cited as one of the five principal be- liefs of Balinese Hindus (Jensen and Suryani 1992). Sickness and misfortune in this life may be connected with the reincarnating spirit's sins from his or her for- mer life. Illnesses can be perceived as being caused by a neglect of an important rit- ual by the family or by mistakes in a ritual already completed (Connor et al. 1986). 63</page><page sequence="17">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY Similarly, in field notes from a TS case: His family initially brought him to a dukun. According to his mother, the dukun said that his illness was 'passed down' or inherited [b.i. pembawaan or keturunan] from his deified ancestors. This was seen as a punishment due to the family's lack of offerings [b.b. sesajen of the type pekeling] at the family temple or shrine [b.b. sanggah]. He needed to do a purification/sanctification [b.b. mecaru] ceremony. The traditional healer gave him holy water (b.b. tirta] in an attempt to rectify the past mistakes and purify and sanctify Mosin. Unfortunately, there was no change in his symptoms after the treatment by the dukun. After receiving no satisfaction from the dukun, Mosin was brought to a Puskesmas and after that to the clinic. Presented above are some of the numerous, overlapping, commonly shared meanings and attributions about the cause of illness in Bali. Below, an extended transcript of an interview with a dukun regarding OCD symptomatology is pre- sented to demonstrate how these concepts are utilized to explain OCD- and TS-like behaviors. This interview is presented at length to show how an individual dukun used these various explanatory models to construct meaning out of OCD symp- toms. RBL: I'd like to ask you about someone who has a problem. They find they have to do something over and over again, and although they want to stop, they are unable. An example would be a man who felt his hands are dirty and needed to wash them. However, he felt he had to wash them re- peatedly, for up to an hour, even though they were clean. Have you ever seen someone like that? Dukun: Yes. A man came who was the son of a high priest. He always felt dirty. He would wash himself but never feel purified. I felt this patient was like a battery that is not working very well. I sent my power to the patient's body in order that my power will destroy the patient's problems, like a medicine that destroys bacteria. There is another case of a father who al- ways wanted to look neat or dress up neatly. When his children came close to him and made him dirty, he became very angry and slapped his child. This is a kind of over-focus on something or belief in a certain thing. Another example is someone who had cleaned his or her yard al- ready and then the neighbor came and made it dirty. The one who cleaned it will hate the neighbor and never say hello to his neighbor. Af- ter this, he lost his self-confidence and became very confused, and his family took him here. I gave him a treatment. RBL: Can you tell me about how you treat such patients who come and see you? D: My treatment is just the same as a medical treatment. First I make the di- agnoses by asking him about his problem. Second is therapy by asking help from God. After meditating, I will get the answer to the problem. The answer could be he is ill because of magic. Another is that his food was poisoned. Another was that the patient became sick because of the position of his house. RBL: Have you seen other people with similar problems? D: Yes. Maybe he thinks too much and a lot of things are in his head that made him forget. Another example is a woman from Bukit [in the south of Bali]. She feels scared because her body feels heavy. She can't stop thinking about her body. This problem was caused by magic. A man loved her and put a magic spell on her because this woman would not 64</page><page sequence="18">TRADITIONAL HEALING AND ITS DISCONTENTS give him any response and sent magic [guna-guna] to her in order that this woman would love him. RBL: What did the woman feel when the man put a magic spell on her? D: She wanted to go to that man's house. She was always making trouble in her house in order that her family would kick her out, so she could go to that man's house. She couldn't stop thinking about that man. I tried to help her by stopping or killing the magic stuff in her body. So the power, which can kill the magic stuff, doesn't have any relationship with medical science. We call that an 'invisible power' in Bali. In another compound, someone put poison on someone else because of jealousy. The person who put poison was very clever and very careful. So it was hard for me to find out the cause. The poison attacked the brain and the liver. The patient became very confused and had a bad stomach- ache. RBL: Tell me about any other kind of symptoms or conditions that you treat that could be related to people thinking about something over and over or doing something over and over. D: According to my opinion that kind of sickness is because of a problem with their thinking and relationship with their ancestors. They must for- get their thought and just pray. Nobody is perfect in this world. Kepon- gor are people who become crazy because of their life before reincarnation; they promised to do something for their god, and they didn't fulfill it. They died and their spirit was reincarnated again on this Earth, and at that time their ancestor's spirit was asked for what they had promised in their first life to God, and God made them crazy and made sure they didn't have any hope in their life. Usually giving or doing what they had promised to God will cure them. They know from the dukun that their problem is Kepongor. Sickness and problems are different. I take an approach that is important for the Balinese-that is, somebody who is born, inheriting from Panca Srade, must ask about reincarnation. Somebody who was reincarnated into the boy, maybe still has sins, sins from the earlier life, so the boy is carrying those sins now. You must know his situation and his relation with his ancestors. In this extended discussion, we can see the complex utilization of multiple, in- tertwined explanatory models; magic and sorcery, reincarnation, poisoning, im- proper enactment of rituals, etc. Each one can have salience for interpreting illness for individual sufferers and their families, and can provide a framework of mean- ing for their illness. Their knowledge base-and ability to frame the symptoms in a culturally syntonic manner-is evident in their explanations of the symptoms. In addition, Balinese traditional healers use virtually the entire cornucopia of trans- formational symbols (Csordas and Lewton 1998) in their practices. Balinese cul- ture provides a complex system of meaning for understanding and framing illness. Because the belief that such meaning making is crucial for a treatment to have effi- cacy, one would think that such complex, multilayered, and multivalent explana- tory models should be very effective at relieving symptoms and suffering. And be- cause they provide meaning for the illness, should not the suffering be lessened? How would this work? What mechanisms can be invoked to explain the efficacy on traditional healing in relation to neuropsychiatric disorders: the issue of mean- ing creation? 65</page><page sequence="19">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY When I approached the question of whether traditional healing techniques are efficacious in relieving suffering, I was guided by the assumption that many of the cases I would be seeing had an identifiable neuropsychiatric base. I was also aware that approaches (such as psychoanalytic or psychodynamic psychotherapy) using a therapeutic model focused solely on interpreting the personal symbolism (e.g., Obeyesekere 1981) and meaning of the symptomatology was not efficacious. There have been arguments that other forms of psychotherapy and medication can have equivalent effects, even down to a neurophysiologic level. In arguing for a new intellectual framework for psychiatry, Kandel (1998) states that cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) and medication may produce similar effects. He argues, based on cbt' s success in treating OCD, that this treatment combined with psycho- therapy can lead to the physiological changes associated with medication: When a therapist speaks to a patient and the patient listens, the therapist is not only making eye contact and voice contact, but the action of neuronal machinery in the therapist's brain is having an indirect and, one hopes, long-lasting effect on the neuronal machinery in the patient's brain; and quite likely, vice versa. Insofar as our words produce changes in our patient's mind, it is likely that these psycho- therapeutic interventions produce changes in the patient's brain. [Kandel 1998: 464] If you replace therapist in the quote above with dukun or balian you can see that this is a way in which the meanings and frameworks the dukun gives to a pa- tient could help reduce suffering. The high status and power that a dukun holds in Balinese society adds to this effect. Traditional healing could be effective in other ways. Cognitive-behavior ther- apy is an effective treatment regimen for OCD behaviors. In a quantitative review of the controlled treatment outcome literature for OCD, Abramowitz (1997) showed that exposure with response prevention was highly effective in reducing OCD symptoms. One of the most interesting findings to emerge from the OCD treatment literature is that, based on PET scans of patients, actual physiological changes occur due to exposure and response prevention similar to those found through the use of medication (Brody et al. 1998). In a similar manner, it could be argued that exhortations given by traditional healers exert a similar effect. Indeed, many of the dukuns advised the patients to try not to do the compulsive behavior or try not to think the obsessive thought. For ex- ample, Pak Wayan (personal communication, from my field notes) said, "One balian advised him to try to control his thinking and try not to remember the name of something he saw, and not to try and check anything repeatedly. Others advised patients to think about God and rely on his guidance to stop the symptoms." Linda Connor, the most prominent Western anthropologist to study psychopathology in the Balinese cultural context (Connor 1982b; Connor et al. 1986), examined mad- ness in Bali and its understanding and treatment by both the biomedical and the tra- ditional medical systems. In reports of a study that is perhaps the most similar to the research that I conducted, she strongly advocates traditional healing as the most appropriate and efficacious treatment for mental illness in Bali. She cites several case studies of different variations of madness (buduh) she gathered during her fieldwork and concluded that many of the cases she encountered outside the mental hospital recovered after a short course of traditional treatment. She found traditional 66</page><page sequence="20">TRADITIONAL HEALING AND ITS DISCONTENTS healing to be more efficacious in many instances than Western-oriented Balinese psychiatry. At the same time, she takes to task the psychiatric community in Bali for using simplified Western psychiatric models and asks, "whether their efforts are really effective if not harmful given the institutional and ideological context in which psychiatry operates in Bali" (Connor 1982b:790). Indeed, there are numerous times and contexts in which traditional healing appears to be the most efficacious form of treatment. Take, for example, the utility of healers to use cosmological explanatory models and therapies to manage grief and mourning. Consultation with balians is done on other life-cycle occasions, such as after the birth of a child (a ngaluang nyapatin consultation). Families will consult with a dukun and inquire about ritual obligations improperly performed. For example, one of my informant' s brothers had recently drowned in a boating ac- cident. His death was particularly tragic as he had been working in Kalimantan as a doctor (for his residency) and was returning to Bali to get married after an absence of two years. His whole family went to a balian metuan to ask why he had died and what the family could do to ease his spirit. The balian channeled his spirit, who told them he was fine and not to be sad over his death. In contrast to the degree of emo- tional restraint displayed at funerals (e.g., "the Balinese are the only culture in the world where people don't cry at funerals" [Wikan 1990:3]), the entire family spon- taneously burst out sobbing. My informant stated that the family was greatly helped by this healer, relieved of the burden that they had performed improper rit- ual actions and caused his death. I went to the field with the subconscious assumption that the different forms of traditional healing should be efficacious. In my interviews with patients, we dis- cussed the issues of use of traditional healers, their explanatory models, and their treatments. All of the explanatory models, in varying formulations, were invoked by dukuns and patients in attempts to understand their bizarre symptomatology. Considering all of the above, how efficacious were traditional healers (in these cases) for relieving the ongoing symptoms and associated intrapsychic suffering and social dysfunction caused by OCD and TS as measured by patients' self-re- ports of decreasing symptoms and relief from suffering? Does the Meaning Making of Traditional Healing Play a Role in Reducing Symptoms and Suffering in Neuropsychiatric Disorders? The most striking result that I found among patients with OCD and TS is their reports of the perceived lack of efficacy of traditional healers and the powerless- ness of traditional healing to relieve their suffering. Of the 40 cases, 22 had been to dukuns for help with their symptoms. Seven had gone more than five times, with several going ten or more times. The following field/case note illustrates a patient's efforts to seek help from different healers, and is a typical response. Initially she was taken to a balian. She ended up visiting 11 balians, who offered a number of competing explanatory models for her illness. Whereas one healer said her illness was the result of a bebainan and that she had been poisoned [b.i. racun]; another healer said that the cause was her impure house yard and environ- ment. She also went to a Balian uat, or a balian specializing in massage. He agreed she could have bebainan, and he massaged her to search for bebai. He could not find one. He thought the cause of her illness was mysterious [b.i. gaib]. He told 67</page><page sequence="21">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY her family that they had to make an offering to a holy spirit being [roh-roh halus] in the form of person anthropomorphic rice offering [b.b. nasi wong-wongan]. He stated she needed to conduct the ritual Mecaru manca warna [five differently col- ored offerings used to purify the family compound land]. She went also to a balian paica, a balian who specializes in herbal medicines. He prescribed her a boreh, a traditional medicine made of roots [b.i. Akar-akaran] and the bark of a tree [kulit kayu pulai], the composition of which was unclear to the patient and the family. According to another healer, however, her illness was the result of a leyak [witch] attack, so that it was necessary to make nasi wong-wongan. Another balian stated that she needed to go to the ocean to ask supplication of a spirit [roh] that would help with her condition. Another balian treated her with the smoke of rubbish collected from the beach, from a cemetery [sampah kuburan], and from a crossroads [all inauspicious or spiritually powerful/dangerous places] and many types of "filthy things." He also had the family look for the hair of a monkey [bulu monyet], a black dog [bulu anjing hitam], a black cat [bulu kucing hitam], and a pig [bulu induk babi]. She had to promise all of her ancestors that she will make offerings to them. He also suggested she go to the beach and to the graveyard at midnight to pray for re- lief from her symptoms. [At midnight, these are both terrifying and spiritually dangerous places for the Balinese.] She received very painful series of massage and spinal adjustments from a balian uat, who also placed hot metal on her skin, which burned her, and put caus- tic substance in her eyes in order to drive out the spirits plaguing her. Ibu Muta had no relief or reduction of her symptoms. She often felt she wanted to die because there was no change in her condition. Out of all the patients, only one (a TS patient with mild OCD symptoms) no- ticed any improvement after seeing numerous dukuns, and that improvement was seen as temporary. Indeed, given the waxing and waning nature of TS symptoma- tology, this could be a response attributed to the dukun but actually part of the clinical course of the disorder. None of other patients described any temporary or lasting symptom reduction as a result of their treatment by traditional healers. If ef- ficacy can be simplistically defined as a measure of the ability of a procedure to in- fluence the health outcome of a patient (or a whole population [WHO 1977]), tradi- tional healing for these patients lacked efficacy. Several objections could be raised to the claim that traditional healing in these cases was ineffective. One is the obviously skewed nature of the sample. For argu- ment's sake, the prevalence rate of OCD or OCD-like syndromes could be esti- mated at one percent in Bali, a rather low rate in light of the transcultural psychiat- ric epidemiological literature. Given a population of 2.7 million in 1996, this would mean that roughly 27,000 people would have a clinically recognizable OCD-like illness. It is conceivable that many of these people received significant symptom reduction and relief of suffering using traditional healers. I am not mak- ing a statement here regarding the efficacy of traditional healing for other forms of psychopathology or dysfunction. I am referring only to the respondents in this re- search. In addition, because of the method in which the sample was collected and its possible nonrepresentational aspects (e.g., few cases of female OCD), it is possible that traditional healing was more efficacious and therefore that these cases did not enter this clinical sample. It should be clear that this research was a pilot study, not 68</page><page sequence="22">TRADITIONAL HEALING AND ITS DISCONTENTS a more rigorous psychiatric epidemiologic study. It should also be noted that the preliminary results from current research I am undertaking on Tourette' s Syndrome in Java, using a community rather than clinical sample, also point to the lack of ef- ficacy of traditional healing on patients who sought psychiatric treatment for this condition. Questions of power and agency are also implicated in the question of efficacy or lack thereof. Power in psychiatric settings has been seen in Bali as a form of cul- tural hegemony of biomedicine (Connor 1982b). There has been little written on the agency of patients in these settings to resist or decline treatment. Traditional healing could be seen as a form of counterhegemonic resistance, whereby the healer offers an explanatory model that in some contexts is in fundamental opposi- tion to that offered by the psychiatric practitioners. This would assume that healers and medical staff are in opposition to each other. This type of dichotomy did not seem relevant for the subjects in this research. It should be stressed that the tradi- tional and the medical systems are generally complementary and not antagonistic in Bali, in opposition to many other parts of the developing world. Indeed, Dr. Pan- teri encouraged his patients to consult dukuns. In general, many of the dukuns stated that they are willing to work together with doctors and that they will refer to doctors for somatic illnesses, particularly when severe pain or disability is in- volved. Another question could be raised about the biased nature of the interview, in that a doctor was asking the questions and the respondent could be seen as giving socially acceptable responses. This could certainly influence some of the answers, but in my experience doing similar interviews-in collaboration with medical resi- dents and psychiatrists-with patients in Bali having other psychiatric disorders, the patients were not hesitant about describing their treatment and the outcome by dukuns, both positive and negative. Many Balinese maintain a well-thought-out skepticism regarding traditional healers who are seen as frauds or charlatans. To a lesser extent, they maintained a critical perspective on which physicians were per- ceived as being approachable, not arrogant (b.i. sombong; see Wikan 1990 on sali- ence of this term in healing encounters) and whose ministrations and treatments seemed effective. In at least some studies in medical anthropology, there is an often-unstated bias toward viewing traditional healing as being a priori more efficacious and ap- propriate than psychiatric treatment. However, a cultural meaning system can offer numerous, readily available and understandable models to explain distressful or dysphoric states, yet not be all that helpful in relieving suffering. In the cases of TS and OCD that I studied, traditional healing was not effective at relieving the suffer- ing of people with OCD-like symptoms. Neither the dukun's knowledge nor their status as healers seemed able to affect the symptoms or relieve the suffering of these patients. I stress "in these cases" because the efficacy that seems to be lacking in treat- ment of these conditions is not lacking in treatment of other forms of illness and psychopathology. In addition to questioning the efficacy of traditional healers, I raised a related question: "If the explanatory models that traditional healers in Bali utilize to explain OCD-like symptoms do not offer direct help to the patient, what are we to make of them?" 69</page><page sequence="23">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY What could be the reasons for the lack of efficacy of traditional therapies for neuropsychiatric disorders? The most obvious one stems from the neurophysi- ologic basis of these conditions. In a similar way to the failures of psychoanalysis to provide symptomatic relief of OCD symptomatology, traditional healing, while interpreting and framing these disorders and their effects, does not appear to reach into their underlying neurophysiologic bedrock. If one takes seriously a neurobi- ological approach to neuropsychiatric disorders such as Tourette's Syndrome, it is hard (but not impossible; see Schwartz 2002) to posit a therapeutic mechanism that does not produce an alteration of neurotransmitter systems. Secondarily, although the explanatory models above provide general contexts of meaning for the complex and interpenetrating worlds of health, emotion, moral discourses, personal experience, and so on, they do not specifically address the complex phenomenology that sufferers of these disorders experience. That is, in general, they do not provide a cultural model or frame that has salience for the suf- ferers' symptomatology and experience of the course of a chronic and debilitating disorder. Finally, there is a nosological issue. Interestingly, what particular psychiatric explanatory models one invokes to understand these disorders impacts how effica- cious traditional healers and healing are. If one views these as neuroses or, in the case of the DSM, as anxiety disorders, then (according to Jilek 1993) traditional healing should be as effective as or more efficacious than Western medicine. How- ever, if one views these as brain disorders, Jilek (1994) notes that traditional heal- ing is in most cases ineffective in organic brain syndromes. Although OCD and TS are not "organic brain syndromes" per se, this biological emphasis should be noted. The lack of efficacy of traditional healing is mirrored, to a certain extent, by problems with biomedical treatment of these disorders in Bali. For example, there are the problems with identification and understanding of the disorder. Few pa- tients are adequately diagnosed and treated for these disorders, because of the lack of familiarity on the part of the typical health care worker, nurse, or general practi- tioner. Only the eight psychiatrists (serving a population of approximately 2.5 mil- lion Balinese) had any familiarity with these disorders, and only a tiny percentage of patients received care. The psychiatrists generally prescribed medications appropriate for these con- ditions; for OCD, either an older generation tri-cyclic antidepressant or the newly released selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). For TS, a neuroleptic such as haloperidol was given in low dosage. Whereas psychiatrists in Indonesia do not have the array of pharmacological agents available in the West, their utilization of the drugs they do have follows biomedical standards of care. In addition, similar to studies in the West (Jimenez 2001), the side effects of the neuroleptic treatment caused a number of patients to go off their medication regimen. Although most of the TS patients could financially afford the neuroleptic treatment (as these medications, due to their use in managing psychotic patients, are easily available at PUSKESMAS at a low cost), the SSRI's were generally far beyond the patients ability to pay. Thus, even if the patients could theoretically re- ceive psychiatric treatment comparable to the West, few could afford it. In addi- tion, many TS patients have concurrent OCD and related mood disorders. Treat- ment with a neuroleptic alone can exacerbate these disorders, if not given in conjunction with a SSRI or tri-cyclic antidepressant. 70</page><page sequence="24">TRADITIONAL HEALING AND ITS DISCONTENTS Conclusion Different disorders must intersect with different explanatory models in differ- ent ways. Indeed, in my other research on long-term outcomes among patients who were formerly acutely psychotic, traditional healing has been heavily used and highly regarded by patients. In agreement with the reports of Connor et al.'s, (1986) work, patients whom I saw generally experienced positive outcomes when they sought help from balians for recovery from a psychotic episode. Considering their emphasis on the efficacy of traditional healing for psychotic episodes (and my data presented elsewhere are largely in agreement) and the data presented here showing a lack of efficacy for patients with OCD and TS, a clear distinction arises. This diversity in outcome of traditional medicine for different forms of psy- chopathology points toward a new direction for future research in transcultural psychiatry and anthropological studies of mental illness. Different cultural systems of meaning around health, illness, and suffering should be analyzed and related to discrete disorders identified by biomedicine and psychiatry. The categories of psy- chiatry should be taken seriously for their heuristic value and efficacious power and an attempt made to link them, and the phenomenological experiences they en- tail, with indigenous categories of illness, emotion, and self. However, traditional epidemiologic methodologies would be strengthened by an inclusion of ethnographic approaches, in particular extensive person-centered ethnography. The data derived from such an approach can often counter the more universalizing and homogenizing data derived from epidemiology-particularly if one is interested in how cultural explanatory models influence and shape sympto- matology. This approach is relevant not only to strengthen arguments for an anthropo- logical approach to psychopathology but also to provide a rich technique for un- derstanding cultural variation and meaning systems. Such research would rely on biological psychiatric data and theory, whereby one can identify baseline biologi- cal phenomena, but with culturally specific manifestations and a unique cultural signature. Indeed, this signature emerges in unexpected (and perhaps unavailable) forms through other methods for gaining ethnographic data and is certainly over- looked or misinterpreted through standard forms of psychiatric research.

There are, however, no transcultural psychiatric epidemiologic works on OCD and TS in Indonesia. See Greenberg and Witztum (1994) for an overview of the epidemiologic data on OCD in other Asian societies, notably Taiwan and Japan. 2. The following description is drawn from several sources, including Bruun and Bud- man 1997; Cohen and Leckman 1992; Leckman, Grice et al. 1997; Leckman, Peterson, An- derson et al. 1997; Leckman et al. 1997, and public information sheets published by the Tourette's Syndrome Association 3. For readers interested in how syndrome map on to patient's individual experience in their culturally constituted behavioral environment, see Lemelson 1999, 2003. 4. For information on the wider findings see Lemelson 1999, 2003. 5. In this article, I will use the terms interchangeably, as the distinctions between the two in Bali are complex and based on both the individual healers self-definition and the con- text in which the term is being utilized. 6. These are not rigid roles, many balians have more than one specialty 7. See Lemelson (1999, 2003) for further elaboration on these results. 8. Behavioral disturbances and problems with social and peer relations are common among children with Tourette's Syndrome. 9. A brief anecdote from my fieldwork should illustrate the ubiquity of sorcery and poisoning as an explanatory model for illness. My field assistant, Wayan, in his late forties, came from a very poor background and only finished the second grade. Midway through my fieldwork, he became ill for over a week with fever and headaches. We met after he recov- ered somewhat, and he spoke at length about his belief that someone in his second wife's family had been putting poison in his food. He was absolutely convinced that this was the cause of his illness. We then went to visit a friend of mine, who was a professor (docent) of English at the University in Singaraja. She had spent several years in Australia studying for her master's degree. Her first reaction on hearing that Wayan had been ill was "Oh, Wayan, someone must be poisoning you because they are jealous of your good fortune in working for Robert." It should be noted that she said this in all seriousness. I was surprised that this would be the first thought or explanatory model she would invoke to explain an illness epi- sode.
