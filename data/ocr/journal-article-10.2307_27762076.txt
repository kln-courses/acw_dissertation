<plain_text><page sequence="1">JERRY R. RANK The Uses of Dios and the Concept of God in La Celestina Este estudio trata los distintos usos de la palabra Dios en La Celestina. Se demuestra que la palabra en la mayoria de los casos funcioria como otro elemento retorico entre muchos en la obra. La palabra Dios subraya ciertas actitudes y condiciones del estereotipo sobre el cual Rojas edifica sus perso najes. Subraya, por ejemplo, el aspecto hipocritico de Celestina o la falta de razon en Calisto por su condici6n de loco amante. Finalmente, el articulo refuta la opinion de los que no admiten un sentido o concepto de Dios en La Celestina, de los que observan un mundo sin Dios reflejado en la obra. Por medio de senalar una conciencia del Tiempo, fundamental para el significado de la obra, lo cual relaciona con la misma conciencia del Tiempo fun damental en los Homo sapiens que desarrollan un concepto de Dios, de muestra que tambiin hay un concepto de Dios en La Celestina. Insiste en que el nivel literal no s6lo no indique necesariamente las verdades mds pro fundas escandidas debajo de la superficie de la obra literaria, sino que puedan a veces indicar conceptos contrarios. In Fernando de Rojas' La Celestina, Calisto's rhetoric on Nature's power to endow his lady, Melibea, with such beauty that he is able to perceive the greatness of God through her ("-En esto veo, Melibea, la grandeza de Dios. - En qu6, Calisto? - En dar poder a natura que de tan perfecta hermosura te dotase ..."1), is just one of many instances which demonstrate that the subject of the religious, moral and philosophical context is a necessary part of Celestina criticism. Many fine insights have come from various directions, but in spite of a long bibliography, the philosophical and religious questions arising from Celestina have not been satisfactorily resolved.2 Inevitably, the treatment of the theme of the religious context of Celestina raises the issue of Rojas' Jewish origins - an issue which must be dealt with because of its condition as inherent to the modern study of the work. The most renowned names in the field of Spanish literature have worked on the question and many, such as Am6rico Castro and Stephen Gilman, are convinced that such considerations are essential to the proper interpretation of the work.3 Gilman's book, The Spain of Fernando de 12EVTSTA CANADTENSE DE ESTTTDTOS HTSPANTCOS Vol. V. No 1 Otoijo 1980</page><page sequence="2">76 Rojas,4 in fact, documents affirmatively assertions about Rojas' Jewish origins as conclusively as possible to date, and should set to rest any disagreement on that score, if, indeed, any still exists. Rojas' converso background, however, does not answer to satisfaction the fundamental question about the religious context of the Celestina. Not even his participation in events related to the converso community, such as his involvement in the trial and defense of his father-in-law, confirms a clear religious context. It is convenient to use these facts concerning Rojas' biography to assert a specific Jewish context for his book, but it is another matter to support that view by internal evidence in the work itself. Indeed, the view has not been supported to satisfaction, yet. Numerous surface examples can be cited that provide evidence to the contrary, in fact, from the call for confession by various characters to the religion of love which is implicit in Calisto's continual adoration of Melibea and the so-called "blasphemous" "soy Melibeo" speech in Act i - in reality a traditional, courtly metaphor distorted from church doctrine. As C. S. Lewis reminds, the courtly system of love consists of "a god and saints and a list of commandments." And it extends to "the lover praying, sinning, repenting and finally admitted to bliss ..."5 Let it be clear, however, that I am not defending an anti-Jewish position in Celestina in favor of a Christian one. Indeed, the main thrust is not directed toward discovering traces of particular creeds or dogmas functioning within Celestina, but rather toward trying to perceive some individual concept of God. It is admittedly very difficult to capture a concept or sense of God without allowing sectarian considerations to enter into the discussion, because socie ty and language virtually conspire to bring us to a single point-of-view. Fernando de Rojas could have been of any religious or philosophical persua sion. He would have, no doubt, inherited the dominant lexical and rhetorical systems of other Spanish writers writing in Spain at the end of the fifteenth century. Again, lest the foregoing be misinterpreted, what is being said at this point has very little to do with the ultimate impression that a work of art makes. A work is profoundly pessimistic or completely burlesque due to the tone and the intentions of the writer. The expressive modes - use of proverbs, rhetorical forms, Petrarchan references, etc., - are, of course, strung together, transformed or distorted by the genius of the individual writer in such a way that the final impression is different in every case. These expressive modes, nonetheless, are primarily the same within a given culture at a given time, provided that there is a certain rigidity of institutions (especially religious ones), and a dominant, common tongue.6 Spain at the end of the fifteenth century certainly appears to fit the description. The expressive modes in Spanish at this time had little choice but to be the same</page><page sequence="3">77 ones which were employed predominantly to express the Christian values present in one way or another in most of the literature (in the widest sense) of the period. But (alas!) these considerations, as I have mentioned, seem always to lead us back to sectarian issues, rather than to conclusions about an individual concept or sense of God in Celestina. They serve, however, to demonstrate the difficulty of the position, since the opposite point-of-view - a theory of common expressive modes - might admit but one concept of God (in the case of fifteenth-century Spain, a Christian concept) uniformly applicable to all works of art and to all people within Rojas' society. This, of course, would be a serious distortion. We are once again led back to the narrower view, since we must admit the historical fact that Spain had Jewish or converso writers, including Rojas, who continued to be knowledgeable about Judaism. We are brought to a possible conclusion: that the expressive modes of a particular place and time - the language of the surface - do not necessarily serve to reveal the more profound levels locked within the work; rather, they tend to carry forward the dominant creeds and values of a given society at a given moment, regardless of the fact that the deeper significance may hold certain elements which may even be contrary to the former. How, then, does one proceed to discover this special kind of significance in the literary text? Ironically, the only beginning that can be made is that which leads to an examination of the surface of the text, about which we have just spoken with some mistrust. One undertakes this enterprise cautiously and with the knowledge that the language of the surface, or significant units from it, may, in fact, be cultural markers which provide a way through to deeper, transcendent concepts which these markers signify at a literal level. In the case of Celestina, this reader concludes that an examination of the rhetorical uses of Dios has little to do with Rojas' concept of God. This negative conclusion does not at all diminish the importance of examining the role of Dios in the text of Celestina. By its very lack of conviction the use of Dios leads us to explore other ways of looking deeper into the text. The ample recurrence of the word Dios in Celestina gives us plenty of examples to test the validity of our conclusions. When the recurrence of a single word within a text is to be examined, it is first a statistical problem. The following is provided to that end. The word Dios is mentioned 223 times in the twenty-one act Celestina. More than half of that number (ni8) represents conventional, formulaic usage involving the word Dios (por Dios, pluguiera a Dios, que Dios aya, etc.). They tell us little about the deeper sense or concept of God in the work at this point, as we have indicated, but they help to substantiate the opinion voiced previously that the expressive modes tie the work to a given society at a given time. Celestina and Calisto use the name Dios most in their speeches; Celestina</page><page sequence="4">78 75 times, 37 of which can be interpreted as conventional usage as described above. Calisto repeats Dios 39 times, 26 of which are conventional uses. The statistics for the remaining important characters are as follows: Melibea, 22 (17 are conventional); Sempronio, 26 (i6 are conventional); Pirmeno, 16 (9 are conventional); Aredsa, 15 (1o, conventional); Elicia, 10 (6, conven tional); Pleberio, 4 (2, conventional); Lucrecia, 6 (3, conventional). Since extended studies of this sort tend to become tedious, I shall try to present an adequate picture of the uses of Dios in Celestina principally through Celestina and Calisto, and to a lesser degree through Sempronio and Pirmeno. Some preliminary observations are nevertheless necessary con cerning all the main characters. It is too easy an explanation to say that the great disparity between, say, Calisto's use of Dios and Pleberio's is a simple matter of frequency based on the number of lines of speech. Pleberio, although concentrated mostly in the monologue of the final act, in comparative number of lines has more than one-fourth of Calisto's (259 vs 966);7 yet he mentions Dios only four times, or one for every ten times that Calisto uses the name. Such disparity cannot be explained by numbers of lines and frequencies, at least in the case of Pleberio compared with Calisto. A somewhat similar disparity is seen be tween Celestina and Pleberio (Celestina has approximately 1900 lines with 75 references to Dios). Many interesting insights into Rojas' artistic use of conventional ideas about God can be gained by categorizing his uses of Dios - uses which often serve to highlight some aspect of characterization in Celestina. This charac terizing aspect provides some tentative conclusions about the disparity in the frequency of the word Dios; namely, in that the author uses Dios in dialogue in ways which promote the stereotypes around which Rojas builds his unique characterizations. Celestina's mention of Dios often provides her with another persuasive tool that is part of the traditional Alcahueta's stock-in-trade. With Calisto, the mention of Dios more often than not is part of the hyperbolic speech of the love-stricken courtier. Inversely, the small number of examples in Pleberio's speeches could, and I propose this cautiously, indicate the de-emphasized interest in the Deity while implicitly emphasizing the deeply pessimistic view of the world that Pleberio expresses, finally. Two of the four uses of Dios in Pleberio's speeches, the significant two, are negative in that they are in conjunction with death and the treason of love. Melibea's small number of citings (5 of significance, 17 conventional usages) could present some interesting hypotheses. Melibea's suicide scene is indicative in that no personal reference to Dios is made in the 143 lines of monologue. Only one reference is spoken, directed toward a second person, "Dios quede contigo . .."', (to Pleberio) - a scarcity that is in keeping with</page><page sequence="5">79 tower that she is going to commit the unpardonable sin of suicide. A personal reference to Dios in this scene would be inappropriate, given the dominant religious context in which Rojas and, consequently, Melibea are operating. The other examples of significance, few as they are, tend to support the conventional sentimental heroine who first spurns the entreaties of the lover through the Alcahueta. They later reinforce the same hyperbolic expression in regard to the amorous dilemma that we have already noted in the courtier. Interestingly, the sole exception to the benign figure of God which is the one prevalent in the work, is the wrathful aspect of Dios voiced in Act iv by Melibea when Celestina has revealed her mission and the name of Calisto: "Pues yo te certifico que las albricias, que de aqui saques, no sean sino estoruarte de mus ofender a Dios, dando fin a tus dias" (96). The reinforcement of the stereotype at the base of characterization in Celestina by naming the Deity is an artistic function. Dios in Celestina is, as noted, a surface figure, more specifically, a rhetorical unit (among many in Celestina). The fundamental characteristic, expressed in a variety of ways by all characters who speak the name Dios in the work, is that this Dios is a deity who maintains a separate existence from his creations and who exercises his will over them, generally in a benign way. This anthropomorphic Dios never serves as the object of the characters' concerns. Since this is so, and since the function of Dios is generally an artistic one, it should be clear that the various uses of His name are rhetorically directed, using traditional formulas to achieve certain effects within the dialogue. The essentially complementary or embellishing character of rhetorical usage obscures, if not impedes, our viewing the use of Dios as a marker for discovering a deeper sense of God in Celestina. Celestina is a good test of our interpretations concerning the artistic function of the uses of Dios. Almost without exception she interjects Dios at key moments in her most important role as persuader. The strain of irony so intrinsic in the character of Celestina, as well as in the work in general, is reinforced with references to Dios. Even Celestina's seemingly gratuitous use of conventional expressions involving Dios frequently emphasizes other important characteristics, namely, false piety and hypocrisy. The conven tional uses of Dios provide unique overtones when worked into certain contexts. The fusion of the conventional and the unique is demonstrated by these uses of Dios, specially woven into the rich fabric of Celestina to contribute to its unique patterns. As we have been observing, the uses of Dios occur at given, even predictable, moments within Celestina's dialogue, often tied to traditional or conventional concepts about God's ability to affect the immediate situation or to have affected the present circumstances in some way through His stereotyped nature as prime mover, creator, omnis cient deity, etc.</page><page sequence="6">80 scene is Act iv when Celestina broaches the subject of Calisto in Melibea's presence. The tone from the beginning is unctious and pious. The intent is to persuade Melibea to trust her so that later she will be able to direct the appropriate question to Melibea concerning a meeting with Calisto. Melibea entreats her not to be afraid to speak and Celestina replies: El temor perdi mirando, senora, tu beldad. Que no puedo creer que en balde pintase Dios unos gestos mis perfectos que otros, mis dotados de gracias, mis hermosas facciones; sino para hacerlos almac6n de virtudes, de misericordia, de compasi6n, ministros de sus mercedes y didivas, como a ti. (94) The speech is meant to prepare Melibea to receive Celestina's message. The figurative use of "pintase," signifying Dios as the painter of Melibea's perfection, is a conventional metaphor for God as creator of perfect beauty.8 It has been, as many of the personifications of God, developed into a Christian topos from Antiquity. The external perfection (or beauty) of the subject is the outward manifestation of a deeper, purer beauty (i.e. virtue) within. The development of this topos into a rhetorical tool makes it perfect ly adaptable to Celestina's use. Celestina praises Calisto, using the very same topos. Also a conventional ploy of the persuasive Alcahueta is the enumeration of the courtier's excel lences to the lady. Celestina praises Calisto for his ability as a musician, as well as for his many talents and virtues, all proper to the courtier. She ends by saying: "Ninguna mujer le ve, que no alabe a Dios, que asi le pint6" (1oo). The quotation is from the same scene as the preceding one. In Act x, Celestina has almost won Melibea for Calisto. The last step is to convince Melibea that her present feelings of ill-being are due to her infatua tion with Calisto: Gran parte de la salud es desearla, por lo cual creo menos peligroso ser tu dolor. Pero para yo dar, mediante Dios, congrua y saludable melecina, es necesario saber de ti tres cosas. La primera a qu6 parte del cuerpo mis declina y aqueja el sentimiento. Otra, si es nuevamente por ti sentido ... La tercera, si procedi6 de alg6n cruel pensamiento, que asent6 en aquel lugar. (155) The use of Dios continues to underscore Celestina's talent for employing her false piety to soften these moments of "1Truth" concerning the potential relationship between Melibea and Calisto. But there are other aspects to consider here, related to the conventional concept of God as the great Healer, the great Physician. Celestina, in this case, acts for Him, but the basic concept is the same. The entire scene is actually framed in terms of patient and physician. Aain, it is a topos of the Middle Ages with origins that reach</page><page sequence="7">81 back to Antiquity, but is for that reason a doubly fortunate figure, given the medieval medical theories concerning the physical origins of love, love as illness, its cures, etc.9 It is true, and indeed often noted, that references to illness, pain and their cures are woven metaphorically into the fabric of Celestina.? The false piety that is at the pedal note of much of Celestina's dealings with those whom she aims to persuade, combined with the irony of her claims to pure motives ("limpias entranas"), is almost comic in its effect in the following quote. Dios is mentioned three times, much above the average frequency in the work as a whole. The scene is in Act iv at Celestina's first meeting with Melibea at the moment when she must confront Melibea's mother, Alisa. Senora buena, la gracia de Dios sea contigo y con la noble hija. Mis pasiones y enfermedades han impedido mi visitar tu casa, como era raz6n; mis Dios conoce mis limpias entranas ... (89) And later in the same speech, speaking of the thread she wishes to sell (her pretext): "Aunque pobre y no de la merced de Dios, veslo aqui, si de ellos y de mi te quieres servir." The interspersing of the name Dios in a speech whose tone is already obsequious and self-effacing helps provide the right appeal. Alisa's compassionate response is exactly as Celestina planned it. The ma nipulative power of her language is strikingly apparent here. There are a score of examples that we could cite which demonstrate a consistency in Rojas' use of Dios in Celestina's speeches which help character ize her along certain identifiable lines. But one more will have to suffice. Celestina in the final scene of Act xii uses Dios four times within the space of seventeen lines. Celestina's anger motivates her words. Sempronio's de mands for his and Parmeno's share of the prize and Sempronio's disrespect ful treatment of her bring on a tirade of righteous indignation: "... no amengues mis canas, que soy una vieja cual Dios me hizo, no peor que todas. Vivo de mi oficio, como cada cual oficial del suyo, muy limpiamente. A quien no me quiere no le busco. De mi casa me vienen a sacar, en mi casa me ruegan. Si bien o mal vivo, Dios es el testigo de mi coraz6n. (182) The indignation expressed is directed principally at Sempronio whom she condemns for his lack of respect for her age and for her alleged position in the community. The otherwise ludicrous assertion that she is like others who live and do their jobs honorably becomes more solemn and ironical with her references to Dios. The implication is that God is entirely responsible for what she is and that only He may judge her. The further implication that</page><page sequence="8">82 Dios is her accomplice and therefore her actions are unquestionably honor able is achieved through conventional concepts about God's exclusive, first and last responsibilities to his human creatures: their creation and their judgment. Dios is the ultimate authority and Celestina almost never fails to have recourse to this authority when she is faced with a difficult situation. Fundamentally, as we have said, the use of Dios by Celestina, as well as by other characters in the work, is rhetorical. The overall irony of the work is heightened as we become aware that Celestina, who bends meaning to her own uses better than any other character in Spanish literature, uses the word more than any other character in Celestina. Calisto, as seen in the statistical breakdown, with his 966 lines of dialogue and 40 citings, is second only to Celestina in references to Dios. As in Celestina's case, Calisto's uses of Dios are expressed in such ways and at such points in the dialogue that they often function to help direct his characteriza tion along lines familiar to us because of the stereotype beneath. In Calisto's case it is the courtly lover that his rhetoric exposes. We have already spoken of the hyperbolic reference to Melibea as Calisto's Dios and his creed ("'So Melibeo," etc.) and how it fits within a convention. The exaggerated expres sion of depression and, at the other extreme, elation at the prospect of contact with Melibea, is most typical of Calisto's characterization which does not go far beyond the stereotype sustained in the Cancioneros of the anguished, long-suffering lover. The most obvious examples are those related to the "religion of love" and the adoration of the "divine" dama. The following quotes are well known: (Calisto to Sempronio) Por Dios la creo, por Dios la confieso y no creo que hay otro soberano en el cielo; aunque entre nosotros mora. (51) (Calisto to Pirmeno) Saquen un caballo; limpienle mucho; aprieten bien la cincha, porque si pasare por casa de mi senora y mi Dios. (78) (Calisto to Celestina) Melibea es mi senora, Melibea es mi Dios, Melibea es mi vida; yo su cativo, yo su siervo. (164) For reasons on which we have focused previously concerning the Christi anized system on which this particular figure is based, this apparent heresy is in reality an affirmation of church doctrine in which one expresses adoration for and confesses to God who reigns supreme. The effect of the use of this conventional distortion of the Christian system of adoration is to show Calisto consistently expressing himself hyperbolically when addressing the dilemma of his unrequited passion for Melibea. The crazed lover, who has lost his reason, oversteps and says outlandish things. Typically, he is both ridiculed and excused for it. The extent to which one can take Calisto seriously, or consider him Rojas' parody of the courtly lover is a subject which is repeatedly discussed.1</page><page sequence="9">83 In Act viii Calisto hears the bells call mass and he announces his intention to pray in church: "Rogar6 a Dios que aderece a Celestina y ponga en coraz6n a Melibea mi remedio o d6 fin en breve a mis tristes dias" (140). The degree to which Calisto is absorbed by his infatuation is clearly projected throughout the work. In this example his appeal to Dios is a further demonstration of that infatuation. He conceives of God's power convention ally; that is, as God who listens to and answers prayer. Beyond this, there is particular interest in Calisto's interpretation of Dios as the manipulator of Celestina ("... que aderece a Celestina ...") and of Melibea ("... y ponga en coraz6n a Melibea mi remedio ..."). The irony here is in the nature of the remedio. The single-mindedness of the courtly lover who can conceive of no other aspect of life outside of his amorous absorption, distinguishes no inappropriateness. Calisto is perfectly defined within his convention by the exposition of this facet of his characterization. Calisto has recourse to the same rhetorical uses as Celestina who expresses on occasion the conventional Deus artifex - Dios as creator (in the artistic sense) of physical perfection: " Hay nacida su par en el mundo? iCri6 Dios otro mejor cuerpo? iPu6dense pintar tales facciones, dechado de hermosu ra?" (117). Calisto's purpose is different in that instead of a conscious tool of persuasion, he uses this hyperbolic convention to project his feelings. Again, it reinforces the image of the crazed lover who is given this rhetorical license. Previously, in the same act, Calisto exclaims upon hearing of Celestina's conversation with Melibea: " Oh, qui6n estuviera alli debajo de tu manto, escuchando qu6 hablaria sola aqu6lla en quien Dios tan extremadas gracias puso!" (io) To which Celestina in turn replies, " Debajo de mi manto, dices? iAy mezquina! Que fuera visto por treinta agujeros que tiene, si Dios no le mejora" (io). These last examples show a relationship to the conventional idea of God's ability to distribute perfection (not always equitably, however). The interest here lies in Celestina's use of Dios to dampen the effect of Calisto's hyperbo lic reference to Melibea. She quickly nullifies the effect of the first reference, which holds Dios responsible for Melibea's nature, by holding Him re sponsible for the condition (or potential condition) of her cape, as well. The juxtaposition is humorously cynical. Two examples of hyperbole made from traditional concepts about God follow. Both reinforce Calisto's characterization in the directions that have been described. The first is from the beginning of Act 1. Calisto is about to be rebuffed by Melibea for his exaggerated attentions toward her: Melibea - Por gran premio tienes 6ste, Calisto? Calisto - T6ngolo por tanto en verdad que, si Dios me diese silla sobre sus santos, no</page><page sequence="10">84 And in Act xii, during the lovers' first meeting, Calisto impatiently requests to have the door that separates them forced open. Melibea restrains him with fears of ruined honor. But Calisto insists: "i Por qu6 llamas yerro a aquello por que los santos de Dios me fue concedido? Rezando hoy ante el altar de la Magdalena, me vino con tu mensaje alegre aquella solicita mujer" (174). Both examples set up totally orthodox concepts about God, from the point of view of the religious context of Celestina. The first projects a Christian iconography - God in his heavenly abode surrounded by His saints. In the second, the same concept is reinforced, but with the added dimension of further conventional concepts about the function of God's retinue in relation to Him and His servant, Calisto. Calisto has prayed to God's saints before the altar of the Magdalena. The verbal claim that his prayers have been answered making it possible for him potentially to commit a sin can only function to emphasize the stereotype of the crazed lover who is incapable of properly adapting his rhetoric to his subject by modulating his expression. The resulting irony is, of course, intentional on the part of the author, and the final effect that this rhetorical motif has on Calisto's characterization is unique to the author's art. Another aspect of Calisto is apparent in a final example related to him. It occurs in Act xiv during Calisto's peculiar and seldom discussed monologue spoken when, his relationship with Melibea sexually consummated, his thoughts return to the dead servants. The anonymous juez is blamed for their deaths and thereby condemned for being ungrateful for past favors on the part of Calisto's father. Calisto ends his monologue by saying: Yo pensaba que pudiera con tu favor matar mil hombres sin temor de castigo, inicuo falsario, perseguidor de verdad, hombre de bajo suelo ... Pues mira, si mal has hecho, que hay sindicado en el cielo y en la tierra; asi que a Dios y al rey seris reo y a mi capital enemigo. (194) Calisto's rhetoric in this discourse is grave. His passion is temporarily spent. He refers to the essential hierarchical nature of the religious and political order familiar to him and to the author, of course. The condemna tion of the judge, using God and King as his ultimate judges, has a significance that must be seen in the light of Rojas' obvious understanding of a society in conflict, as his was. Rojas brings the impending collapse and disintegration of an old social order of mutual protections among the power ful and the influential closer to Calisto by the inclusion of this peculiar example. Calisto in this scene shows an unaccustomed rationality, temporary though it may be. Although Dios is mentioned within a rhetorical frame with its attending exaggerations, it is an appropriate reference, proper to the</page><page sequence="11">85 tional order of things for Calisto. His use, sober and proper, is an interesting contrast to his unmodulated voice in other passages. It helps to establish, if not another facet of the character, at least a distinctive moment in its dramatic life - a moment essentially palinodial in tone, given that it follows soon after Calisto's tryst with Melibea.12 Sempronio and Celestina are similar in some aspects. They both under stand their functions in Calisto's society and are aware of how to make use of them for their own benefits. The ability to persuade is a prime factor in this talent, as we have noted repeatedly in the examples dealing with Celestina. Celestina's perverse uses of persuasion consistently contribute to the ironic tone of the work as a whole. Sempronio is very close to Celestina in his ability to twist words and logic to correspond to the immediate situation. At the beginning of Act ii there is a very good example. Sempronio says to Calisto: iY para qu6 es la fortuna favorable y pr6spera sino para servir a la honra, que es el mayor de los mundanos bienes? Que esto es premio y galard6n de la virtud; y por eso la damos a Dios, porque no tenemos mayor cosa que le dar; la mayor parte de la cual consiste en la liberalidad y franqueza. (74) The intention of the entire 31 line speech from which this is quoted, full of moral chestnuts, is to convince Calisto that it is more blessed to give than to receive and that he has done the right and honorable thing in the sight of God to have paid Celestina the hundred pieces in order to oil the works of her illicit dealings. The key word is la honra. Honor tied to God and to further glorification of his illustrious family is irresistible to Calisto. The implicit concept that one lays up treasure in heaven by good works and charity (liberalidad, here) on earth, is good church doctrine. The twist is in the use to which Sempronio puts these doctrinal implications. In the same way that Calisto, because of his crazed state as lover, expresses conventional concepts about Dios in incongruent contexts, he accepts in the same spirit Sempro nio's ironic and perverse logic here. Celestina, then, becomes the ironic medium for Calisto's increased "honor" and familial glorification. One example which actually concerns Pirmeno more closely than Sem pronio follows. The two witness in Act xi the giving of the gold chain to Celestina. Sempronio admonishes Pirmeno to be quiet and listen, but P6rmeno continues to exclaim: Sempronio - Por mi amor, hermano, que oigas y calles, que por eso te dio Dios dos oidos y una lengua sola. Pirmeno - i Oiri el diablo! Esta colgado de la boca de la vieja, sordo y mudo y ciego, hecho personaje sin son, que, aunque le di6semos higas, diria que alzabimos las manos a Dios, rogando por buen fin de sus amores. (164</page><page sequence="12">86 This example is especially interesting because of the two gestures involved which are juxtaposed in significance. The one is obscene and the other is spiritual, one beseeches and the other deprecates. Pirmeno's crudely humor ous exaggeration nevertheless underscores Calisto's inability to distinguish because of his condition as crazed lover who is rendered incapable of reacting or responding appropriately to his surroundings. In Celestina there are numerous examples in which Dios functions simply to give force to what is being expressed. Some of these are, as we have seen, purely conventional in nature. But most, even conventional uses, play a significant role by functioning artistically to heighten the irony, the sarcasm or the straight-forward humor of the dialogue. This point, I believe, has been made without further details and examples. There are, nevertheless, two general usages of Dios which deserve mention simply because they tend to emphasize that the surface concept of God in Celestina is on the whole a conventional one. They involve epithets and proverbs. There are some fifteen epithets containing Dios and they exalt ("Oh, Soberano Dios ... " etc.) Besides this category of rhetorical references, there are some nine uses of Dios in proverbs, or in expressions which are distinctly aphoristic in tone. These tend to be either biblical or to imitate a biblical tone - normal in proverbial usage in the Western world. Neither of these conventional categories, nor, for that matter, the other uses of Dios in Celestina, in any instance reviles the persona designated Dios in the work. The conventional uses of Dios, albeit often employed in unique ways in Celestina, demonstrate consistently that the surface concept of Dios in Celestina is a traditional one associated with Christian concepts prevalent in the Middle Ages in the Western world. There are, of course, concepts about God which derive from Antiquity, especially those related to ideas about beauty and virtue, but they are Christianized and perfectly acceptable within the context of fifteenth-century Spain. Furthermore, the uses of Dios in Celestina are intimately related to the dominant doctrines of the author's time and place and to the rhetorical formulas developed to express them. With this in mind, let us return briefly to the problem of the deeper significance of God in Celestina. Analysis beyond the surface concepts of God in Celestina presents special problems of method, problems which arise from suspicions about the capa bility of the word Dios to transmit that deeper sense of God which belongs to the author. The question is how to proceed in such an investigation. It would seem to be contingent on the impossible task of looking into the mind of the author who has been dead for 450 years and whose cultural milieu is not directly verifiable. To undertake such a task requires that we accept the author's work as an extension of his mind. In regard to this, it is well that some remarks be made here about the universal consciounessA of time which</page><page sequence="13">87 seems to be inextricably bound to the sense of transcendent reality peculiar to the human mind. The metaphorical expression of the passage of time is, as all symbolicity, unique to the human mind. Indeed, the universality of this time consciousness and its symbolic expression through many varied forms leads to the inevitable conclusion that it lies at the base of all awareness of human existence. S.G.F. Brandon, in History, Time and Deity,13 writes that while the forms by which man has expressed his awareness of time and the solutions to the problems that this sense has caused have been varied, his "awareness of Time has been single and constant in its primary impetus ..." (p. 2). He goes on to show that awareness of time is intimately bound to the major religions or philosophical systems of the world and that its significance "may even be described as the basic factor, or rather, the very source, of the religious intuitions and aspirations of our race" (p. 2). Brandon further demonstrates how the main attitudes towards time have found expression in various major religions. While my intention is not ultimately to give evidence of specific dogmas at work in Celestina, nonetheless, because of the ambiguous religious context of Celestina, the traditional Christian and Jewish attitudes toward religion and historiography cannot be disregarded. In both religions God is viewed as ultimately achieving His purpose in the cosmic process through the passage of time. The essential difference is in the way history unfolds to reveal the Deity's plan. The Christian view of history is teleological while the Hebrew view, the Old Testament view, is of the preordained cyclical nature of history - as Brandon puts it, "life as a dreary repetitive process" (p. 5). Yet just as the human capacity for shaping the present is by recourse to memory of the past, so the consciousness of the present is inexplicably bound to the anticipation of a continuing existence in the future. It is this anticipation that underlies the human drive for attaining a transcendent state. It is a drive that is present in one form or another in all human experience. In relation to the whole concept of the relationship of Time, History and God, we might again turn briefly to Celestina and to some statistical evi dence, tentative though it may be. Appropriately, space and time limit us, so that no detailed analysis approaching the one to which Dios was submitted is forthcoming. It even seems a great deal to try to suggest in the remaining space that the concept or awareness of God in Celestina is deeply rooted in the author's profound understanding of the essence of time. There are three abstract substantives in the Comedia version of Celestina'" that occur more than any other single noun: vida (88), amor (87), and tiemno (8c). The interrelatedness and the comparable frequoen of</page><page sequence="14">88 the three words suggest a fascinating reduction of the work to an essential matrix of signification. The fascination is even greater and the matrix seemingly more complete when the count for muerte (45) and for morir and its forms (8o) are included. Without going into all the formalistic possibili ties of the interrelatedness of these words, one is immediately aware that vida and muerte, besides the obvious binary implications (with amor joined to both in Celestina in a way specially related to the courtly point-of-view) mark a symbolic relationship, no matter how subliminally, with tiempo. Time brings an end to life, that is, death - and symbolically to love, as well. On another level, the trajectory of life through its stages is symbolic of time's progression (and vice-versa). The duration of love and the moment of death are simply aspects of time and symbolic points along the continuum that define and qualify human time, which in turn is synonymous with life, etc. Juggling these words within the significant context of Celestina reveals a great variety of interrelationships with tiempo as their basis. The valid relationships indeed go far in demonstrating the symbolic ground of Celestina which, perhaps different from our conclusions about the surface uses of Dios in the text, must reveal something about the mind that has intuited a particular set of symbolic relationships to express a particular conception of the world. The passage of time in Celestina is marked in every aspect of the work - thematically, structurally and symbolically. Symbolically it is marked by the fundamental contrasts of life: the change from day to night, youth to old age - that constant state of change which breaks the continuum into the human concepts of past, present and future. From the beginning we are aware of Rojas' understanding of the Heraclitean theme of change and continuity through conflict. There is a sense of causality on the one hand, and the workings of Fortune on the other. All is wrought through the inexorable progression of time. Time finds a strong metaphor in Celestina in its use of memory. Time fuses with the concept of space as the characters come and go, enter and leave rooms, walk the streets, climb walls. Above all it is measured by talk - a progression from speech to speech, from act to act, continuously transforming the present minute into the past. The perception of the inexor able passage of time and its effects is fundamental to the fabric of the work at every level. The awareness of time and its effects evokes in the human mind a sense of insecurity and this sense teaches that nothing remains the same, man is mortal and that, among other characteristics, time participates in dual, even contrary, aspects: continuity and destruction. All these lessons of time are important themes and sub-themes which resonate deeply in the reader of Celestina. The author of Celestina may well reveal a crisis of faith in the subliminal</page><page sequence="15">89 reaches of his work, but it has little to do with theologies and it has not changed the fundamental concept of God as that reality by means of which man in Rojas' cultural period aspired to transcend the barrier of human time, that is, death. It is true that, because every doomed character in Celestina goes to his death without confession (a fact stressed in the work itself), one might reasonably assume ties with a single creed. Celestina cries out for confession. The fact that Calisto could not confess before dying is singled out in the text. But ultimately the fact of death without confession should not be tied in Celestina to theological conclusions or conclusions about dogma. It is indicative of the wider human crisis of Celestina that confession is not forthcoming. Confession, the lack of it, and the significance that it had for Rojas' readers serves as a convenient and immediately graspable marker within the work's socio-religious context, but its higher significance is universal. If one relates the ultimate concept of God to a profound sense of time's significance, then one must see in Celestina that time is consistently por trayed, as are the other abstractions mentioned in relation to time (vida, muerte, amor), as a destructive force. The human crisis reflected in Celestina is in man's holding a universal concept of transcendent reality, modified to Dios by the author's particular social and religious milieu, and in sensing that, at the same time, he has been inexplicably cut off from access to it. Rojas reflects in his unique and highly artistic way, a more general crisis, surely resulting in part from the political and social catastrophes of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The teleological sense of historical time which provided the West with a concept of the ordered and essentially perfective play of history (so evidenced in the earlier chroniclers, specifically for Spain, Alfonso x), on close analysis of Rojas' work will be shown to be faltering. Time is no longer viewed as necessarily capable of carrying one to the moment of transcendent reality - to perfection in Dios. Rojas' sublimi nal sense of the destructive nature of time and its correlatives (vida, muerte, amor) demonstrates that this traditional concept of the perfective role of history as it is executed through human actions is in crisis, not the ultimate sense of God. To conclude these rather tentative statements about the concept of God in Celestina, it is acknowledged that none of the ideas about the concept of God and its dependence on the deeper awareness of time are supported by specific textual examples; but it is not that there is weak or vague support. The opposite is in fact the case; that is, there is substantiation on every level, but the subject will require the kind of extensive study that cannot be undertaken here. There are, nonetheless, a number of implications tied to the questions raised which have come out of our remarks. Among them is the implicit denial of the opinion of those who see no hint of real interest in the Deity in</page><page sequence="16">90 Celestina, and, in fact, perceive pagan or atheistic worlds reflected in the work. The author of Celestina, one of the great writers of early European literature, provided a complete world within the pages of his work, surely perceived as such by those who shared his milieu and read his book. A further implication, related to the latter, is that works of genius, if "scratch ed" deeply enough will reveal the great universal themes which preoccupy Homo sapiens, but from the point-of-view of specific cultural contexts, individually interpreted and transformed by the artist. There may be discussion in the case of Celestina about the author's revelation of a particular concept of God - that is, Jewish resignation to "life as a dreary repetitive process," etc. - and even about the exact nature of the concept, but that there is a concept or a sense of God in Celestina, and that it is related to the universal problem of man's transcendence, there can be little doubt. University of Illinois, Chicago Circle NOTES 1 Fernando de Rojas, La Celestina, ed. Dorothy S. Severin (Madrid, 1974), p. 46. (All quotes are from the Severin edition and will be designated by page numbers in parentheses after the quotation.) 2 Am6rico Castro in his "El problema hist6rico de La Celestina," in Santa Teresa y otros ensayos (Santander, 1929) sees in the work an unchristian nature philosophy, while Otis Green, in his Spain and the Western Tradition (Madison, 1964), 11, pp. 76-92, writes that Rojas is the inheritor of a long tradition of the medieval, Christianized concept of Natura naturans. 3 See Am6rico Castro, "La Celestina" como contienda literaria (Madrid, 1965), where the idea permeates the book. 4 The Spain of Fernando de Rojas: The Intellectual and Social Landscape of "La Celestina" (Princeton, 1972). 5 The Allegory of Love (New York, 1958). 6 Ren6 Welleck and Austin Warren, referring to Taine's concepts about literature and milieu, write: "Literature occurs only in a social context, as part of a culture, in a milieu ... The most immediate setting of a work of literature ... is its linguistic and literary tradition and this tradition in turn is encompassed by a general cultural 'climate'." Theory of Literature (New York, 1956), pp. 93-94. 7 I have used line counts from Severin's edition, since, for our purposes, it is a question of comparisons within a constant text that matters. 8 See, in reference to the idea of Deus artifex and its origins, Ernst Robert Curtius, European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages (New York, 1963) pP. 544-546. See also, Otis Green, "Courtly love and the Aesthetics of Beauty" in Spain and the Western Tradition, i, pp. 80-82, and Maria Rosa Lida, "La dama como obra maestra de Dios," Romance Philology, 28 (1974-75), 267-324. 9 There is no lack of treatises and references to the medical theories in the Middle Ages. A late,</page><page sequence="17">91 but an especially suggestive work on the subject for Celestina scholars, is Francisco L6pez de Villalobos' Sumario de la Medicina, published at Salamanca in 1498. 10 The subject has been developed in an excellent article by George Shipley, "Concerting Through Conceit: Unconventional Uses of Sickness Images in La Celestina," Modern Language Review, 70 (1975), 324-332. Also, literary references to sickness are curiously suggestive of symbolic patterns which Kenneth Burke has noted (" Coriolanus and the Delights of Faction" in Language as Symbolic Action [Berkeley, 1973], p. 88) in, albeit, a very different kind of work: Shakespeare's Coriolanus. Burke's ideas, loosely applied to Celestina, could carry us to different conclusions about the function of sickness images and could cause one to theorize that there may exist an unconscious symbolic ground in Celestina that goes beyond the obvious metaphor related to the lovers (unrequited love = sickness, consummation = restored health) to symbolize the author's view of his society as a "sick" organism. Both works do deal with problems of class, but, admittedly Shakespeare's work is a play primarily about a particular political and class struggle, while Celestina uses societal conflict as a background to its action. 11 The parodic in Calisto is the thesis of June Hall Martin's "Calisto" in Love's Fools: Aucassin, Troilus, Calisto and the Parody of the Courtly Lover (London, 1972). 12 There is more to be said about the sobriety of tone in this speech in contrast to the melodramatic, possibly parodic tone in Calisto's love displays. Calisto's insistence on verbally reaffirming the traditional spiritual/secular balance of hierarchy (Dios/rey) which, when extended, affirms the established social order in which Calisto maintains his privileged conditions as an aristocrat - it, too, perhaps threatened - is an interesting, possible sub-theme. 13 History, Time and Deity (New York, 1965). 14 For the sake of expediency, since our concerns are once again comparative rather than solely quantitative, I have used Lloyd Kasten's and Jean Anderson's Concordance to the "Celesti na" (1499) (Madison, 1976), for these counts, rather than computing frequencies from the 21-act version.</page></plain_text>
