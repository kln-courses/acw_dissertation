<plain_text><page sequence="1">TWO HUMANISMS: Athens and Jerusalem Mark Glouberman Convergence "ЛД^нат," thundered the early Church Father Tertullian, "does Athens have to do with Jerusalem?" (ch. 7.9). Had Tertul- lian been transported forward a century and a half or so, he would have heard his own sharp negative gainsaid within the very circles in which he moved and by one who was very much his equal at thundering. According to Augustine, Athens, via its illus- trious native son Plato, has a great deal to do with Jerusalem. On the fundamental question of the nature and ultimate destiny of men and women, the views of Athens and Jerusalem do, I agree, converge. In saying this, however, I am only echoing the Bishop of Hippo's words, not his thoughts. Though Tertullian uses the name "Jerusalem," he has in mind a different city than the city located in the Judaean hills overlooking the Jordan River Valley. Tertullian's contest pits pagan Athens against Christian Rome. It is on this same contest that Augustine parts company with him. When /say "Jerusalem," I am referring to the Jebusite settlement that King David made his capital. And this Jerusalem - the Jeru- salem of the Hebrew Scriptures - is a precursor only in fairly coarse, pre-hoc terms of the Eternal City, the Christian City of God.1 My thesis of convergence thus concerns the views of the Hebrew Scriptures on the one side and those of Greek culture on the other. My position is that the conception of men and women set out in the book that emanated from and reflectively summed up the lessons of Israel's formation and travails is, at its core, not that far from the one that emerges when the various forces play- ing into and informing ancient Greek thought are reasonably re- solved. According to both conceptions - albeit with importantly Mark Glouberman is Lecturer in the Arts One Programme at the University of British Columbia. Soundings 84.3-4 (Fall/Winter 2001).

Men and women are seen, that is, as dis- tinctively human beings rather than as especially complex constit- uents of the physical world or as vapor trails of deity. The thesis can be unpacked. Athens and Jerusalem converge on their general understanding of what men and women basi- cally, essentially, are. That is, both cultures advance a proto-hu- manist view. The lion's share of the following discussion will be devoted to extracting the proto-humanist elements in some of the "scriptural" documents of Athens and Jerusalem. Preparato- rily, I shall spell out and critically respond to theoretical objec- tions to the very suggestion that the alphas and omegas line up with the alephs and the tavs. Higher and Lower Beings In terms of the standard typology of religions, the Greek posi- tion on the gods is pagan. The Bible's position, by contrast, quali- fies as a form of theism. Given that the way the members of a culture conceive of their deities tells us a good deal about that culture's world view, and given that the self-image of the mem- bers of the culture is part-and-parcel of the world view, how can the Athenian and Jerusalemite conceptions of men and women converge? A culture's conception of its deities and its understanding of its flesh-and-blood constituents are counterparts. At any rate, should a culture's view of the gods diverge drastically from its members' self-conception, its lore about the gods would not be in any real sense a religion. A bona fide religious belief-system must have implications for the wider lives and practices of its ad- herents. So, given that the conceptions of deity in Athenian and Jerusalemite culture both have such implications, the question posed in the preceding paragraph is a good one. A first step in answering consists in appreciating that the counterpart relation- ship - the linkage between a culture's deities and its flesh-and- blood constituents - can take a variety of forms. So far as the implications for lives and practices are concerned, the ontologi- cal status of the higher beings is not what primarily counts. What counts, first and foremost, is their attitude towards men and wo-</page><page sequence="3">Two Humanisms 451 men. In this regard, the gods might be antagonistic, indifferent, or sympathetic to human flourishing. The Bible postulates a deep affinity between higher and lower beings.2 The deity of the Hebrew Scriptures creates men and wo- men "in [his] image, according to [his] likeness" (Gen. 1.26). This feature has no match on the Greek side. True, the Greeks gave their gods the outward form and the inner psychology of men and women. And I would agree that this anthropomor- phizing draws the Greek position towards the theistic one. How- ever, the attribution of personalities to the gods is a fairly superficial feature of Greek religious thought - a concession, I would say, to demotic requirements. God's having a personality is, by contrast, a profound and inexpugnable feature of the bibli- cal view. The Greek position is, as I said, pagan. The members of the pantheon correspond to natural, physical, forces.3 The Olympian deities are, for the most part, indifferent to the hopes and fears of men and women. Sometimes, to be sure, the gods are repre- sented as acting in concert with humans, and even as lending them a hand. This, however, is not because the Greeks believe that the deities are taking a positive interest in their travails. What happens, rather, is that the purposes and aims of earth- dwellers come, for a limited time, to coincide with the plans of the gods. The gods help these mortals in order to help them- selves. Self-absorbed, the deities pursue their own agendas with little regard for the consequences, good or bad, on men and wo- men. This, of course, quite accurately depicts how men and wo- men stand in relation to an indifferent nature and confirms the superficiality of the anthropomorphizing. Not that nature is inva- riably hostile to men and women. The rains do come, frequently enough, in season. The sun does shine, frequently enough, when the crops require. But timely precipitation and ample light can- not be counted upon any more than can long life and good health. Crop insurance and life insurance tell the tale here. The contrast, from this very preliminary standpoint, is thus that men and women who worship the biblical God regard them- selves as being, in some fairly deep sense, at home in the world. The Greeks, by contrast, feel themselves trespassers who, not to run afoul of those who hold the deeds, must stay in the shadows and keep a low profile.4</page><page sequence="4">452 SOUNDINGS Mark Gloubeman I can now begin to clarify the issue of humanism. A pair of elements are key to the humanist outlook I am describing. First, the finitude of men and women is recognized as a defining fea- ture of human identity. It is constitutive, rather than (as in the Christian reading of the story of the Fall) an accident that some- how got attached and that, like a barnacle, clings in an especially tenacious manner. Second, these finite and limited things, the lives of men and women, are regarded as loci of intrinsic value.5 The thesis, then, is that in both Athens and Jerusalem, the two humanistic elements are nascently acknowledged. The concept of a distinctively human being is a central development of both. If human nature is an independent locus of value, then the self- conception of men and women will have to be granted a measure of independence from their relations to deity. I will be showing that this loosening of human dependence on deity takes place in the two frames, and that, given the differences between Greek paganism and biblical theism, it takes place in different ways. Thus the numerical qualifier in my title. I would excuse the reader for professing puzzlement at this point about the logic of the argument. How the members of a culture view their gods is, I stated, one side of a coin whose re- verse face is how they view themselves. In speaking of a "loosen- ing," am I not now simply denying the complementarity? True enough, the self-conception of men and women as autonomous is bound to be accompanied by the weakening of bona fide relig- ious belief. But the complementarity thesis is still important here, since the way that autonomy is secured will obviously be deter- mined by the character of the earlier links of dependence. Break- ing out of Alcatraz is quite a different thing than strolling away from a minimum security institution. A second, positive, reason also exists for invoking complementarity. There is an important sense in which, as we shall see, the higher beings are complica in creating the distance between the divine and the human. Need- less to say, the portrayal of these beings gives expression to how the representers, men and women like you and me, think. Relig- ious documents are not reports from a distant front by intrepid foreign correspondents. And we shall indeed find, in each of the cases, that the higher beings to a greater or lesser extent lend the lower ones a hand in setting themselves up as autonomous. This means that the lower ones have some sense of their own auton-</page><page sequence="5">Two Humanisms 453 omy and configure the overall arrangement so as to allow that sense to come to expression. Up to now I have, at the cost of a certain inelegance, employed the phrase "men and women" as a collective label for our kind. Though "human" would have been colloquially more natural for service in this capacity, the development of my thesis makes it well worth our while to reserve "human" for a different, more specialized, use. A Weltanschauung that does not acknowledge, or that denies, the two elements of humanism identified above is not ipso facto a Weltanschauung that loses the distinction between Phaedo and Fido. The human can quite effectively be defined on many other grounds: genetic, biological, social. But a world view that doesn't recognize these elements is one in which men and women are not regarded as human.6 In the sequel, I will home in on several crucial places in the literary remains of Athens and Jerusalem where men and women begin to be recognized as - in the specialized sense - human. Homer's Trojan Horse Towards the close of the action in the Iliad, after Achilles, avenging Patroclus, has dispatched the Trojan champion Hector, the god Hermes, shod in winged sandals and wand in hand, spir- its Priam, Hector's father, behind enemy lines to the Greek champion's bivouac. There, on bended knee, the Trojan king pleads for his son's lifeless body. It is in this encounter that the Iliad foregrounds the existential plight of men and women as human beings. That Hermes does the spiriting is highly significant. Hermes is the divine messenger. He occupies this role because of his ability to negotiate the most formidable obstacles. Hermes, for instance, conveys the spirits of the departed to the banks of the Styx. On the level of plot, it is appropriate that Priam be transported to Achilles's tent by one who has such power, since the king, in be- ing there, is stepping far out of his dominant role. For Priam, the Trojan leader, a private parley with the enemy is unseemly. But the deeper point lies, I believe, on the level of theme. The visit dramatizes a shift in the way in which the Trojans conceive of themselves; it does so by dramatizing the interaction taking place in a quiet moment between two representative figures of the then dominant social order.</page><page sequence="6">454 SOUNDINGS Mark Glouberman Achilles, the son of the goddess Thetis by the Myrmidon king Peleus, thus a middle term between blood and ichor, might have mocked the grieving father, as no doubt the latter on many an occasion had stood bellowing over his battle fodder. But Achil- les's response testifies to an incipient sense of men and women, in their finitude, their fragility, their mortality, as the foci of an autonomous value-system - as human beings. Achilles does not accede to supplicant Priam, as Agamemnon, fearful of colliding with an Olympian fiat, had acceded to the request to repatriate Chryseis. Initially, Achilles had mouthed the orthodox line: "the man who brings the ransom can take away the body, / if Olym- pian Zeus himself insists in all earnest" (24.169-70) .7 However, the motives for Achilles's return of the body lie elsewhere. Un- derscoring the non-Olympian nature of Achilles's motivation, Homer juxtaposes the act to the sacrificial butchering of "twelve brave sons of the proud Trojans" (23.207) during the funeral games for Patroclus - an Olympian-type act if ever there was one. Priam's goal is to retrieve a corpse, that incontrovertible ex- hibit of the limited nature of men and women. The effect of the visit is a burgeoning appreciation, by the slayer who ended the son's life, and by the slain son's father, of the way these termini, birth and death, define, rather than merely demarcate, the life that transpires in between. Achilles raises Priam from the hard ground to a higher - only a slightly higher - level: Come, please, sit down on this chair here . . . Let us put our griefs to rest in our own hearts, rake them up no more, raw as we are with mourning. What good's to be won from tears that chill the spirit? So the immortals spun our lives that we, we wretched men, live on to bear such torments - the gods live free of sorrows. (24.609-14) That Achilles raises Priam only so far as the chair - half way between the earth and the standing position - is great artistry. That there is but one chair for the pair of them, the begetter and taker of a life, is genius. Achilles includes himself in the phrase "We wretched men." "We humans" we might paraphrase. Achilles and Priam face their mortality in the company of remains for whose presence they are jointly responsible.</page><page sequence="7">Two Humanisms 455 Hermes, I noted, is instrumental in arranging this confronta- tion, during which a conception of the human nature of men and women as sui generis begins to congeal. Just as the Trojan Horse transports the Greek fighters by stealth inside Troy's walls and allows them to put the city to the torch and its inhabitants to the sword, so Hermes spirits to the battlefield in the shadow of Olympus a human presence that begins to eat away at the reg- nant Olympian Weltanschauung? For this work, Hermes indeed deserves the epithet that Homer repeatedly applies to him and that the poet might with abundant justice apply to himself: "gi- ant-killer." Hermes' s intervention makes two things clear about the role of the gods. First, that Hermes is needed to transport Priam indicates the monumental character of the encounter. Second, that Hermes, an Olympian, does the transporting indi- cates the complicity of the higher beings. In this case, they help men and women by not helping themselves. It is, after all, at the behest of Zeus himself that Hermes swings into action. It is not at all surprising that Achilles has such a hard time making sense of what is happening. Simone Weil shows a similar confusion when she points out that The true hero, the true subject, the center of the Iliad, is force. Force as man's instrument, force as man's master, force before which human flesh shrinks back. (qtd. in Knox 29) What Weil says draws the approval of noted scholars. But her re- mark betrays a serious misunderstanding of the epic - indeed, I would say, a scandalously serious misunderstanding. Yet her er- ror is revealing. As an observation on the frailties of the flesh, Weil's words brook no dissent; what she says is commonplace enough that one might find her mode of expression overblown. No matter. Men and women do confront a reality that cares little for them, and those who count themselves darlings of destiny soon enough find their luck running out. But it is, I think, highly significant that despite the gods' intentions, a product of their own loins proves to be the vessel of an emerging realization of a value that is in- commensurate with their own divine perspective. Against the gods, mortals stand no chance. Still, the identity of mortals is not necessarily determined by their hopelessness in the face of mor- tality and the gods.</page><page sequence="8">456 SOUNDINGS Mark Glouberman Deeper questions arise here about Homer's theme, and these questions challenge Weil's perception. Is force the epic's true hero, or is it only the background against which a truer heroism struggles to be born? Achilles says, "we wretched men." He sees men and women, as does Weil, as doomed to suffering. Homer's point would seem to be that the suffering, inevitable though it is, is to be grieved over and lamented because the sufferers have value. Pace Weil, the true hero, if we persist with the word, is, arguably, the ninety-nine pound weakling who takes the blows, not the go- rilla who remorselessly dishes them out. If the message of the epic is to be captured in Weil's terminology, her words must be reversed: The true subject, the center of the Iliad, is man, man whose value withstands the force that assails the insubstantiality of his flesh, mocks his hopes, and inevitably lays him low. As a piece of Greek pagan divinity, Achilles brings force in its purity to the battlefield. Unstoppable, he is the quintessential warrior: a widow-maker and devourer of men. The action of Aga- memnon that sets the epic in motion causes that force to be de- flected from the course it would otherwise have taken. The Achilles who sulks at the beginning of the epic is very different, however, from the Achilles who encounters Priam. And the dif- ference gives us a window onto another defining aspect of our humanity. A purely natural model applies directly to Achilles's response to Agamemnon, and hence keeps it within the ambit of Weil's remark. Agamemnon's action, along with what it provokes in Achilles, fall under the Newtonian rubric: no action without reaction. To appreciate how this differs from the other case, let us review. Apollo's intervention has resulted in the return of Chryseis, Agamemnon's spoil of war. Agamemnon, the king, must com- pensate for this loss; his preeminence among the Achaeans re- quires it. His pre-eminence requires a prize of equal value. Not just any substitute prize will do, so he goes after the prize of his paramount warrior, Achilles. Considered now as the first mem- ber of an action/reaction pair, Agamemnon's removal of Briséis, in turn, causes a reaction. Achilles's battle force, when blocked, turns back on itself and becomes the wrath that keeps him to his tent. The wrath is not an expression of an independent internal nature. As pure force, Achilles has no inwardness. Just so, in their anthropomorphic guises the Olympian gods, as quintessential</page><page sequence="9">Two Humanisms 457 versions of force, are psychologically empty. They act in accor- dance with their natures, and that is that. A glimmer of real inwardness emerges, however, during Achil- les's encounter with Priam. In the meeting in the tent, Achilles is not just reacting, as water does when it meets an obstacle. Achil- les's reaction is mediated by recognition. Achilles, that is, appre- ciates something about the situation and adjusts his own reaction as a result. This is unlike any natural force. The water does not "recognize" the obstacle and change course because of that. Water always acts as water will, seeking its level. It acts as water will as much when it pools behind an obstruction as when it flows freely. On the battlefield, Achilles is freely flowing force. In the tent, when he sulks and keens, he is force obstructed. In both cases, his actions, different though they look on the surface, are at base the same. His wrath after Briséis is taken is of a piece with his murderousness on the battlefield when he meets Hector. But something quite different takes place in the tent when Priam steals in. In the inwardness of Achilles's response, we have a third element of the human constellation - an element of the first importance in the assignment of value to men and women. It is of the first importance because it reveals a value in men and wo- men that is not merely a diminished form of the values found in the gods; it is instead something that is incommensurate with what is found there. To be sure, it is more than just inwardness. What Achilles recognizes is that Priam, this individual, is suffer- ing and that his suffering has nothing to do with his (public) role as king. Like the Trojan Horse, Homer's offensive move against the Olympian view - his isolation of that which raises lowly men and women from their subordinate position relative to the gods - comes only as the battle for Troy winds down. Also, it is at most a feint in the new direction; at the end of the day, the Greek Horse is little more than a foal taking a first, hesitant, step. Nothing can diminish the Iliads consummate art. Without the halting movement of the encounter, however, it would resemble a sphyngian museum exhibit upon which we would gaze admir- ingly, even wonder-struck, but which would return no reflection of our natures, our prospects, our condition - an exhibit in which we would discern nothing of ourselves.</page><page sequence="10">458 SOUNDINGS Mark Glouberman Homer and the Bible: Invidious Contrasts As I will argue, the vision of humanity found in Homer's text is also present in the Bible. Before turning to that argument, how- ever, I must first explode the widespread views that there is a deep contrast between the Greek and Hebrew works. No living tradition can, in its original form, have the smooth- ness of the epics. Living traditions, rooted in the activities of peo- ple, do not spring into being on clay tablets, looms, or computer terminals. But Homer, like Hesiod, is certainly far more than an ethnographer trying to snatch the mythological bits and pieces from the maws of oblivion. He is already more than that, of course, because of his artistry. Yet in saying that Homer is more, I am not just referring to the artistic dimension. Homer is doing more than introducing drill-ground precision into an unruly throng of mythic stories and legends. He is ordering what he in- herits in a way that not only presents, but in presenting also takes a critical look at, the world view these materials originally expressed. Typical judgements about Homer and about the Bible assume that Homer is artistically superior for steering clear of politics, the Bible artistically inferior because it prosecutes a more forth- right ideological agenda. The contrast is overdrawn on both sides. It is not true that the Bible is, artistically speaking, a Grandma Moses. It is not true that Homer, in the sphere of cul- tural politics, is hors de combat Since no one familiar with Holy Writ will be in any doubt about its artistic merit, I owe an immediate explanation. It is widely held that the core of the Hebrew Scriptures, the Penta- teuch, is a patchwork of pieces cobbled together in a thematically problematic fashion and that, in this regard, Homer's epics are of a higher artistic order. This view is supported by the Docu- mentary Hypothesis whose dominant variant distinguishes a J- text, a P-text, an E-text, etc., from which the redactors who fash- ioned the document that has come down to us picked and chose. The Documentary Hypothesis is, I think, incontrovertible. Ac- cording to this view, however, the Bible is not only a compilation of several different texts, it also lacks internal unity, and hence an approach to the Bible that aims to recover the authorial plan or intention, i.e., a hermeneutic approach, is predicated on a mistake. The artistic greatness of the work is thus (it is held) a</page><page sequence="11">Two Humanisms 459 greatness of the individual parts, not of the whole.9 In a fully achieved work of art like the Iliad, the argument goes, the whole is more than the sum of its components, however polished the parts may severally be. The contrast between Homer and the Bible is overdrawn. To evaluate the literary merit of the Bible, a concerted effort must be made to figure out the agenda of those who arranged the parts. True, such efforts might draw a blank. Still, it is wrong to assume that the hermeneutic approach is inappropriate solely on the strength of the narrative oddities of the Bible. These are themselves data for reflection. We need to be sensitive to the way in which the Bible's final composers did their arranging. Analysis of the Bible that employs this hermeneutic approach frequently uncovers thematic reasons for the oddities that dis- turbed those who took an early "analytic" approach to the text. Often what first come across as plot-line inconsistencies, redun- dancies, and cul-de-sacs turn out to be clues to deeper themes. The existence of these themes should restrain the reader from making quick judgments on the Bible's literary merit.10 Ironi- cally, the proponents of the Documentary view really opened the door to a less superficial understanding of the Bible than passive readers can reach. Even more ironically, this less superficial un- derstanding agrees with their secular view of human affairs. Arguably, then, the contrast between artistry in the Bible and in Homer is misleading. At the end of the day, the Bible, no less than Homer's works, has the artistic virtue of a whole that sur- passes the aggregative sum. Let me not be misunderstood here. That the Iliad has an inter- nal unity that the Bible lacks must be conceded. But the compar- ative seamlessness of Homer's epics is no index of their being, in sharp contrast to the Bible, self-contained products of an imagi- nation beholden to its background only for the raw materials. I believe it would be correct, then, to contrast the Iliad with the Bible by saying that the former alone is primarily a work of art.11 The Bible's inspiration is overtly religious. The Bible's writers (editors, redactors) scale artistic heights as part of the pursuit of its metaphysical goal. But for reasons already set out in the dis- cussion of the Iliaďs humanist feint, it would again be mistaken to say that Homer is just producing a winsome object. The criti- cal moment in Homer is just less obtrusive. The Bible is more</page><page sequence="12">460 SOUNDINGS Mark Glouberman overtly political, and the roughness of its texture is due partly to that. Homer's works present to the reader a glassy surface, and this makes their political side less apparent because politics typi- cally takes the form of jagged cut-and-thrust. The key point about Homer is that he stands in an uneasy, incipiently oppositional, relation to the world view associated with the Olympian creed. In what sense can a comparable thing be said about the Bible? The issue here is far more difficult. It is more difficult because the Bible's critical movement, like the cave in which the patriarchs and matriarchs are interred, is a double one. The Bible's Double Deconstruction Evidently, the Bible stands in an oppositional relation to the religions of the day. The call to Abraham to quit his father's abode is a call to a new way of thinking about men and women and their position in the scheme of things. Abraham is a Colum- bus. In this generic respect, the parallel with Homer's criticism, as critic of the Olympian view, is preserved. But isn't the Bible critical of other religions in the name of the one true religion, while Homer takes aim at a religious way of thinking in the name of autonomous human values - in the name, that is, of a secular Weltanschauung Where Achilles renounces his divinity,12 doesn't the biblical story hammer out a new conception of divinity and a corresponding understanding of men's and women's share in it? These questions assume the Bible's theological mission. How- ever, the appearance that the Bible is theistic as opposed to hu- manistic is deceptive.13 Though the Bible is critical of mythico- magical religion, and the terms of its criticism seem the very stuff of a more forthright theology, a sense of the inner workings of the book sustains a very different story. What is usually described as a straight substantive contrast be- tween Homer and Bible is better described as structural Both have a similar destination. But where the Bible reaches the hu- manistic goal in two steps, the second of which is enfolded in the first, Homer gets to the finish line in a single bound. Standard construais of the Bible fail to recognize the presence of the sec- ond step. In the most general terms, the erroneous conception proves surprisingly easy to combat.</page><page sequence="13">Two Humanisms 461 According to the usual understanding, the Bible replaces a magico-mythical view with a religious monotheism. God's call to Abraham - "Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you" (Gen. 12.1) - is the dramatized form of the split from the old magico-mythical way. Although this is the beginning of the explicitly historical side of the Bible, the story of a nation and its triumphs and travails, the groundwork for this history has already been laid in the non-historical, cosmogonie, part of the book. The ground- work, the account of the creation of the world and of men and women, already makes clear that the old way is delusive. Needless to say, only one who takes the Bible as revealed truth would auto- matically agree that the old way is a path of illusion. What we are after is not, however, the truth, but the message that the book is concerned at root to impart. It would be quite apt here to speak of the cosmogonie part as the prime expression of a stunning act of faith. The act of faith consists in the belief that men and wo- men are not aliens in the world. (Contrast this with Weil's obser- vation on the Iliad.) At the deepest level, this is what the claim that we are made in God's image and likeness means. But, as we shall soon see, a vital qualification is needed. Classical accounts of biblical cosmogeny attempt to explain, compatibly with God's power and knowledge, why the world is a vale of so many tears, and the attacks on these accounts are de- signed to show that the explanations fail. However, the fact is that the Bible portrays the world as inhospitable not only for men and women but for God too. The Bible forecloses on the classical theod- icy problem because its presiding figure is demonstrably not the being than which none greater is in principle possible - not in the Anselmian sense that counts, anyway. The theodicy problem is an artifact of rational theology powered by an Athenian rather than a Jerusalemite motor. True enough, human problems are frequently put in the Bible on the basis of local failings: stubbornness, cupidity, ignorance, greed, shortsightedness, impatience, intolerance, etc. But these problems are not in principle reparable. The fundamental struc- ture of things as the Bible describes it allows human failings. It allows them even prior to the emergence on the scene of obdu- rate and desirous and myopic and short-tempered human crea- tures, and this means that even the best of intentions on God's</page><page sequence="14">462 SOUNDINGS Mark Glouberman part will not necessarily save the day. Even grace, that is, will not do the trick. This is the message of the cosmogonie parts of Gen- esis. Even for God, the world is no garden of Eden. That being so, it is not surprising that owr way is not a high road strewn with petals or macadamized with precious stones.14 This claim will be more fully developed later, but let me here enter a small but exemplary piece of textual evidence. The fol- lowing phrase repeats itself like a mantra through the days of primordial world-making: "And God saw that it was good." If he is omniscient and all-powerful, why would God's sense of the goodness of what he has created arrive only after the exertions had ceased? Wouldn't a perfect being determine the best in ad- vance and actualize on the strength of the antecedent determina- tion? The question may get an affirmative response when it comes to the God of the philosophers. As for the God of Adam, of Abraham, and of Moses, the truth is different. We can better understand the act of faith that the Bible repre- sents by contrasting the biblical view with the theological relativ- ism of philosophical Greece. According to Xenophanes, one of the earliest exponents of rational theology, "[I]f cows and horses . . . could draw . . . , then horses would draw the forms of gods like horses, cows like cows" (qtd. in Barnes 95). Of the Bible, this is just false, and those who would say that the Bible describes God in the language of men miss the stunning novelty of the Book of Books. It is true that God is conceived in the Bible in human terms. This has to be implied by the claim that humans are made in the image of God. The more important, extra-logical, fact about the resemblance, however, is that God is conceived as be- ing in a condition that is very like the human. God is a human- plus, rather than a human being a God-minus. Humans are not minor deities. Who would choose such a God? One expected an- swer is: losers. A better one is: realists. The best answer is that the call to cut from the flock comes from within the patriarch, Abra- ham, rather from an external source. It is a dim internal recogni- tion of a new way. Which way? The way of an incipient humanism. If this is the choice of losers, then losing is for win- ners. Does not Achilles gain in our estimation through the re- nunciation of his Olympian pedigree? He is, we think, the better for coming down to earth.15</page><page sequence="15">Two Humanisms 463 I noted in passing that I hold theism and humanism to be com- patible. Does this not clash with the core thesis that the Bible's theism is just a first port of call on the longer Odyssey to a hu- manist Ithaca? Theism is the position that God has a psychological make-up generically akin to that of persons such as we. God has hopes, plans, expectations, or reasonable facsimiles thereof. Many reli- gions, such as the Olympic religion, are non-theistic. While ritu- als such as prayer and sacrifice do, of course, figure prominently in a lot of these creeds, this much is plain: an adherent who sacri- fices or prays is not trying to communicate with a being on the level of mutual recognition. Sacrifices are offered in the spirit that one purchases a lottery ticket (perhaps my number will come up), tosses a piece of meat to a shark (while it gorges, we scramble to safety), or blows smoke onto a bee-hive (that will quiet the insects as we gather the honey). Theism is already a move in the direction of the position that we, as persons, are in synchrony with the ultimate powers at work in the world. It is, accordingly, a move that diminishes the mystery - a move in the direction of recognizing human categories as fundamental. Eli- jah, confronting the idolaters in that famous encounter on Mount Carmel, does not appeal to their views on their own non- theistic terms. The priests of Baal are described with undisguised scorn. They limp about their altar; they call on the name of Baal from morning until noon; they cut themselves with swords and lances, raving on until the time of the oblation. But "there was no voice, no answer, and no response" (1 Kings 18.29). Elijah mocks them with bravado: "either [your god] is meditating, or has wandered away, or he is on a journey" (1 Kings 18.27). But a being like Baal, not conceived along personal lines, cannot liter- ally be said to meditate or to go on journeys. Plainly, then, the Bible takes the first step away from the magico-mythical religion. For the proposition that it takes the second step, I have already drawn evidence from the deepest bib- lical level: not only is the divine psychology like that of the human, but God's nature is akin to human nature even in re- spect to the failings and foibles that constitutionally beset human beings. Let me transpose this into a philosophical register. The claim that God has a personality generically similar to human personal-</page><page sequence="16">464 SOUNDINGS Mark Glouberman ity looks, at first blush, like a move ensuring a high degree of harmony between human beings and reality. But the Bible, while endorsing the generic similarity, denies the harmony. This is what is truly astonishing about the book. The Bible holds that God's way in the world is, generically speaking, every bit as peril- ous as our own and as much open to being waylaid by what lurks around the next bend despite the best efforts to ensure a smooth journey. So our resemblance to God does not place us in a neces- sarily advantageous position. Better armed to handle comparisons and contrasts, we can now return to Achilles. According to my reading, Achilles is Ho- mer's representation of a dawning sense of the autonomous hu- manity of men and women and, even more importantly, of a dawning sense that this humanity has its own irreducible value. It is true that humanity is portrayed negatively: mortality - inces- sant, even obsessive, consciousness of mortality - is its hallmark. The idea that life is valuable is closely connected to the aware- ness that life is short and fragile. The dominant mood of the Iliad is resignation and gloom. Though it is hardly "upbeat," the Bi- ble's act of faith is, nevertheless, fundamentally less bleak. It in- sists that our human nature is somehow ratified, somehow given a positive certification. The deepest point is that this "somehow ratified" is equally true for the Lord God who presides over the action. His novel character is somehow ratified. This is what Xe- nophanes's cutting remark misses. Xenophanes would have us believe that, had they the capacity, cows would assign horns and udders to their deity. Contrary to what Xenophanes intends by this remark, men and women, in producing the Bible and/or conceiving God along biblical lines, are not just projecting from their own condition. In so conceiving God, those for whom the Bible is scriptural are taking God down a notch. The Bible's God, if you will, is like the bodhisattva Achilles. The contrast between the direct (though nascent) Homeric humanism and biblical humanism should be clear. The latter reaches its ultimate terminus via a new religious conceptualiza- tion. The former is a more direct break with that way of conceiv- ing the place of humans in the scheme of things. Several recent books about the Bible advance a thesis that complements my theme. This may be styled "the steady and pro- gressive disappearance of God" thesis.16 A treatment that is sensi-</page><page sequence="17">Two Humanisms 465 tive and thought-provoking in many of its insights is Jack Miles's God: A Biography. Also worth mentioning is Richard Elliott Fried- man's The Disappearance of God. These authors note that accord- ing to the Hebrew Scriptures, God's participation in events diminishes as the world unfolds. The late Book of Esther, though it plays a variation on the theme of Israelite redemption, makes not a single reference to God. Closer to the center of the canon, we have the closing books of the historical part of the Bible, Ezra and Nehemiah. Here we encounter hard-headed pragmatists struggling in a harsh geopolitical environment to revive the com- munion and set it on a solid foundation after the return to Zion and reconstruction of the Temple that the Assyrians had torched in 586 ВСЕ. The views of Miles and Friedman are not surprising, however, unless the Bible's religious character is accepted as a given. Yet this religious character is not a fact about the text itself but con- cerns its reception, appropriation, and use. The proposition that the text's message synchronizes with the reception, appropria- tion, and use cannot automatically be inferred, and, unless the text is massively expurgated, does not in the event withstand scru- tiny. What surprises those whose attitude to the Bible is devo- tional is not necessarily surprising from the standpoint of the text itself. Recall here the movie The Gods Must Be Crazy. The story is told of a communion that congeals around a pop bottle dropped onto the African veldt from a passing airplane. The religious use of the Bible strikes me as, at base, a case of the same phenomenon. Elijah's mockery of the Baalites was cited above. A few pages later, the Bible delivers a real shocker - though it is, I say, ex- actly what the underlying dynamic should lead us to expect. God says to Elijah: "Go out and stand on the mountain before the Lord, for the Lord is about to pass by" (1 Kings 19.11). Now there was a great wind, so strong that it was splitting moun- tains and breaking rocks in pieces before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake; and after the earthquake a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire; and after the fire a sound of sheer silence. (1 Kings 19.11-12) The Lord's response to Elijah is mute, like that of Baal to its fol- lowers. Why, if so, did Elijah bother? I believe we have the answer.</page><page sequence="18">466 SOUNDINGS Mark Glouberman The Magical Mystery Tour? My thesis that the Bible is only religious by association and ap- propriation has the look of scandal-mongering. I expect critical readers to insist that even if the text supports the thesis in certain instances, which is perhaps not surprising given how widely the Bible ranges, when it comes to the matters that are really crucial from a religious perspective - viz., the alephs and tavs - the thesis fall flat. Though I am contenting myself with program- matic presentation, I should, before continuing, shore up my claim that the category of the human is central to the Bible against a criticism that is sure to arise. The Bible is a capacious work. Prominent among the many topics it addresses, and not merely because it has pride of place, is the creation. World-making is certainly no mundane undertak- ing. Some might therefore argue that the humanistic reading is decisively incapable of accommodating this key part of the story. God operates by verbal means. His creative activity looks like the activity of a magician who, chanting "Abracadabra," draws a rabbit out of an empty top-hat. By contrast, while human beings at one point in the story undertake a correspondingly monumen- tal task, a kind of reprise of primordial creation: the construction of the Tower of Babel, there is no sign on this construction site of any other than ordinary human labors, such as making bricks and mortar, etc. If so, doesn't the key claim that human catego- ries are biblically central come a cropper? While denying that the divine acts of creation are very special would be absurd, need it be concluded that God is of the party of Merlin? Two points need to be made here in defense of the nega- tive. The first is that most of God's creative activity does not fall solely under the rubric of such divine proclamation as "Let there be." The second is that those creative acts that do fall solely under that rubric can nonetheless be understood in a way that distances God from mystery and magic. Consider God's second paradigmatic act of creation: "Let there be a dome in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters" (Gen. 1.6). Does the separation come about solely in response to the saying? The text proceeds: "So God made the dome and separated the waters that were under the dome from the waters that were above the dome. And so it was" (Gen. 1.7). God's saying is prefatory to his doing; the saying</page><page sequence="19">Two Humanisms 467 itself is not, however, in and of itself efficacious. Attentive read- ing of the relevant passages shows that this linkage of saying and doing occurs in all but the very first case, the bringing-into-being of light. As to what God does, the description of the parting of upper from lower waters recruits the language of the copper- smith: God pounds out a thin plate which he inserts to enforce the gap between the regions. The Hebrew noun for "dome" or - as it is better known from the Authorized Version - "firma- ment" is based on the metallurgical adjective "malleable." Thus, the uniqueness of divine activity can easily be overstated just be- cause of the agent's exalted standing. Providing alien theological preconceptions are mastered, the Bible itself can be seen, how- ever, to tell a more down-to-earth story. I have also claimed that we need not interpret God's first com- mand as a magical act. Can we envisage circumstances in which "Let there be" would work - work non-magically? Imagine humans at a Neolithic stage of human history. Once they exited the psychological Eden of infancy, the world will have appeared to them a very hostile place: the rains unpredictable; natural ca- tastrophes frequent; abundance one year, slim pickings the next; disease and health matters of sheer hap. For survival, they were at the mercy of forces beyond their ken and control. But had they been totally inept, they could scarcely have survived. Over a cer- tain range of circumstances, agency was efficacious. Over others it was not. The crucial matter would have been to distinguish the two sets of circumstances. This can be illustrated with a domestic example. A spouse ap- peals to his or her partner: "Honey, get me a cup of coffee, will you?" (I update the venue from stone-age cave to suburban kitchen.) Are the words likely to work? Unless high-pitched screams and the sound of crockery smashing regularly punctuate the domestic set-up, generally they will. In most households, cof- fee will appear at the table in response to the spousal "Let there be." No magic in this. The efficacy of the form of words is not unrestricted. Were the spouse, weary of toiling for the daily bread, to intone "Let there be a fortune in the bank account," that would not occur in spite of the best will in the world on the partner's part, and the ensu- ing disappointment would be no ground for lashing out verbally or physically.17 Made reasonably, such requests are made only</page><page sequence="20">468 SOUNDINGS Mark Glouberman over a certain range of cases where some reasonable expectation of fulfillment exists: Buttered toast perhaps. An ironed shirt. The lawn mown. The contrast with the magical example is plain. "Let a rabbit materialize" can be chanted until the cows come home, and no twitching rodent will appear. If the Neolithic requester picked his or her spots carefully, then he or she could have had his or her desires met. Plainly, the picking of those spots is sensitive to experience. When, then, men and women at this stage engaged in the religious practices of the day - petitioning higher powers for favors, sacrificing to secure the aid of these powers in some enterprise - could this not be seen as an exuberant extension into the unknown of a mode of agency that, in a more restricted domain, worked well enough? In respect of the biblical narrative, I submit, this is how the situation should be understood. Notwithstanding the appear- ance of futility, it bespeaks a quite hard-headed and practical ra- tionality. Those who regarded the Bible as Scripture would have deemed it irrational to ask for the moon. Erstwhile members of the communion who persisted in doing so might have been sin- gled out for re-education or even excommunicated for threaten- ing to bring a non-compliant God into disrepute.18 Scale apart, God's creative acts are, for the most part, human- like. God intervenes, moves things about, pokes, pummels, etc., just as we do in our dealings with the environment. As for the cases where the creative process seems to be verbal, these too can be seen as an upwards extension of just that mode of agency that will have been most efficacious for humans. Moreover, just as the spouse is not always compliant, the world at which God intones "Let there be" does not respond in precisely the expected fash- ion. Like many a pressed shirt, what is delivered has more than one wrinkle in it; like many a meal, half-baked. The Career of Humanism: Athens and Jerusalem Homer, though a monumental figure of Greek culture, be- longs to a period when classical Greek civilization was still several centuries distant. What became of the humanism that Homer's work adumbrated? Athens - synecdoche for Greek culture - is best known and celebrated for another contribution to the West: scientific thinking and philosophical rationality. Jerusalem is, by contrast, associated with a devotional mind-set - with faith. Phi-</page><page sequence="21">Two Humanisms 469 losophy did not arise in Jerusalem. Needless to say, as the cul- tures of the region came into contact with one another, seepage occurred in all directions. Jewish thinkers were impressed by philosophical Greece and vice versa. But why was there a Plato only on the Athenian side? Plato was an opponent of humanism, and his opposition was relentless and uncompromising. Plato's theory of value rates the permanent and timeless high above the impermanent and fleet- ing. Human life is fleeting and impermanent. Consequently, its value is diminished. The biblical view values the human. It sur- vived. Judging by Plato, Homer's nascent conceptualization was relegated to the periphery. The reason for the difference that the preceding account thrusts up is relatively straightforward. The category of the human, because it was embedded in and hence enjoyed the protection of a theistic matrix, survived in Jerusalem. Its comparatively stark and bufferless contrast with Greek relig- ion explains the rockier ride there. The ephemeral and transi- tory seems too friable to be the stuff of ultimate truth. When it has to stand on its own against the claims of a timeless reality, its prospects are poor. However, in Jerusalem, it did not stand on its own as it did in Greece. It had God on its side. The Bible comments fairly directly on Greece and does so, I think, persuasively. The comment I like best comes from Proverbs: Three things are too wonderful for me; four I do not understand: the way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a snake on a rock, the way of a ship on the high seas, and the way of a man with a girl. (Prov. 30.18-19) What, turning Tertullian over, does Jerusalem say here to Athens? Philosophy, the Philosopher wrote, begins in wonder. The "three things" that inspire the Proverbialisťs amazement come, respectively, from the air, the earth, and the water. This exhausts the regions of the natural realm. The fourth? From human af- fairs. The latter - so the lines say - thwart the scientific/philo- sophical mind, which seeks the constant (in timeless Forms, in immutable laws of nature) beneath the flux. When it comes to men and women, to human relations, such philosophical under- standing is fugitive. Nor did Plato really say otherwise. He, like the scientists of our day, reduces human reality to something pu-</page><page sequence="22">470 SOUNDINGS Mark Glouberman tatively more elemental; he sinks the human in the natural. The problem is that the reduction relegates to oblivion features of the reality that are the very core of those lives. Contrast Achilles's remark about our wretched condition with the following claim that Plato puts into Socrates's mouth in the Republic. These words could be seen as directed precisely at the tent where Priam confronts his son's killer: We have said that a man of high character will bear the stroke of fortune, such as the loss of a son . . . with more equanimity than most people. . . . [T]he presence of contradictory impulses [to give vent to his grief and to master it] proves that two distinct elements in his nature [reason and passion] must be involved. One of them is law-abiding, prepared to listen to the authority which declares that it is best to bear misfortune as quietly as possible without re- sentment, for several reasons: it is never certain that misfortune may not be a blessing; nothing is gained by chafing at it; nothing human is matter for great concern; and, finally, grief hinders us from calling in the help we most urgently need. (335-36; Stephanus 603-04) 19 Plato is a skilled writer. His words have an effect on us. What, however, do the quoted words mean? Without controlling the grief, living - getting on with living - would be impossible. That much Achilles said, and to that much, I daresay, we would all agree. But should we devalue what we are grieving about be- cause the grief can have a paralyzing effect? Achilles's delibera- tion, and Priam's, acknowledge that what they grieve about is worth it, as they struggle to master the paralyzing emotion. The words quoted from the Republic are, I said, "put into Socra- tes's mouth." I meant by this to imply that Plato is subtly dis- torting an anti-Platonic message that his revered teacher can be taken to embody. Socrates can plausibly be seen as an embodi- ment of a nascent humanism rather than of its denial. Is the flesh-and-blood Socrates faithfully represented as a spokesman for Plato? Since the Platonic dialogues themselves are our main source of information, it is not surprising that Plato is usually assumed to be developing in a full theoretical way views towards which Socrates gestured. But from the more biographical pieces such as the Crito and the Phaedo, where, one expects, Plato is mildly constrained by what contemporary consumers of his writ- ings independently knew of the protagonist, the unmistakable impression is that Plato is a very Procrustean host. There is, at</page><page sequence="23">Two Humanisms 471 minimum, the following paradox. Though Plato devalues human reality in favor of timeless verities, Socrates's effect is at least as much due to the power of his personality as to the force of his arguments. In the integrity of Socrates' person rather than in the cogency of his (i.e., Plato's) arguments, we find what enables human mutability and flightiness to withstand the philosophical onslaught - a powerful sense of the value of a limited and finite self. Needless to repeat, this is not the message that Plato was out to impart; when dealing with Homer, Plato gives not the least sense that Homer does not endorse the Olympian view. The Bitter Pill Despite the fragmentary nature of our sources, it can be said with a fair degree of confidence that the use of the figure of the snake in Genesis reflects, in a critical way, an earlier tradition of the culture from which Judaism developed or the view of some other culture whose contents it rejected. The creation story is certainly told against the background and with a knowledge of the various cosmogonie stories of the region, some of which fea- ture monsters.20 The Bible's agenda is, as I said, political. Those who compose the text are engaged in what Hegel called an "Aufhebung - a dialectical supersession - of earlier positions. The contrast between the Bible's herpe tological attitude and the attitude toward snakes found in other religions of the region is indicated by the prevalence of snakes in the court of the Egyp- tian Pharaoh, linked to the activity of "the wise men and the sor- cerers," i.e., "the magicians" who practice the "secret arts" (Exod. 7.11). Here we see once again the Bible's repudiation of the magical. The Bible's repudiation of magic differs from the repu- diation of magic found in the Greek philosophers, however. The Bible rejects the magical in favor not of the brutely natural, but of the human. Consider, by contrast, the claim, attributed to the first of the phusikoi, and the man also standardly denominated "the first philosopher," that everything is full of gods.21 Far from the ascription of supernatural foundations to the world, Thaïes of Miletus naturalizes the gods. In this final section, I want to show that, like the snake itself, the most "crafty" (Gen. 26.1) of the beasts, the Bible's treatment of the snake is not what it appears. An understanding of the snakes reveals the Bible's human agenda.</page><page sequence="24">472 SOUNDINGS Mark Glouberman The Western association of snakes with healing is based on the annual molt and crosses cultural frontiers, tracking back to the rim of recorded history. The well-known statue of a Minoan mother goddess bearing a snake in each outstretched hand (ca. 2000 ВСЕ) is a good illustration, predating the archaic Greece of Homer and the roughly contemporary Near East of the Bible. Most of us readily identify the caduceus - a staff entwined by a pair of snakes - as a symbol of the medical profession. There is a bit of iconic confusion here. The caduceus is, in fact, part of the paraphernalia of Hermes, the divine messenger. A different Hellenic deity, Asclepius, is associated with medicine. The latter also has a snake-entwined standard (not the caduceus) as part of his livery.22 That staff, not the caduceus, is linked to caducity. The snake's most prominent appearance in the Bible is associ- ated with sin and the decay of the flesh, but the Bible also con- tains a link between the snake and medicine. I refer to the metallic snake that we first encounter in Numbers, where it is cast, and then meet a second time in Second Kings, where it is cast out. Let us briefly make its acquaintance. The Israelites, restive yet again about the length and severity of the trek to the Promised Land, are plagued by venomous snakes that are sent from on high because of the Israelites' quarrelsome- ness. As a result of Moses's intercession, God relents and pro- vides a kind of hair-of-a-dog remedy: "Make a ... serpent, and set it on a pole; and everyone who is bitten shall look at it and live" (Num. 21.8). The similarity to Asclepius's standard is astonishing. In both cases, we have a single snake and a staff.23 Nor is this all. Zeus eventually dispatches Asclepius, a son of Apollo, lest the powers of healing redeem men from death altogether. Zeus fears that man will become, as the Bible puts it, "like one of us" (Gen. 3.22). Asclepius's art is regarded as a capital offense by the higher beings, and his tale thus replays a theme better known from Hesiod's story of the divine renegade Prometheus. Just as Asclepius meets his end at the sky god's hands, so to the snake is destroyed in the days of a Judaean ruler who, rare among the breed, did what was right in the Lord's eyes. By King Hezekiah's time, a cult had accreted around the object, transforming it from a symbol of divine power and mercy into an object of idolatry. Hezekiah, making a clean sweep,</page><page sequence="25">Two Humanisms 473 removed the high places, broke down the pillars, and cut down the sacred pole. He broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made, for until those days the people of Israel had made offerings to it; it was called Nehushtan. (2 Kings 18.4) Poisonous snakes were sent because of the Israelites' heedless- ness of God's word. Was it not the snake in Genesis that provoked deviation from a divine edict? That would suggest an internal connection. The real craftiness of the account comes, however, in the remedy, viz., gazing upon an artificial serpent. There is here a bit of the idea of vaccination. A substitute for the real thing, bitter pill though it be, can ward off the most damaging effects of the real thing. But the idea of gazing on the snake and living sets up some very complex associations. The snakes in Genesis and in Numbers differ in that the indi- viduals in whose midst they appear are innocent only in the for- mer. But this too accords with the notion of vaccination. A vaccine is administered to an infant. This may, to an outsider, seem cruel, especially when the vaccine is injected and the infant bawls. Still, the procedure may for all that be necessary and bene- ficial. The story of the snake in Genesis, I suggest, describes a kind of vaccination. Eden is a place of childlike delight. The garden planted by God is, however, only a small corner of the world. Assuming that the garden dwellers will have eventually to confront the rest of the world, might the snake's effects not be salutary? There is here, whether deliberately or not, a parallel between the snake in Numbers and in Genesis. In the later part of the Pentateuch, with the children of Israel in a hostile environment, the snake is prescribed by God. In the earlier part, in an environ- ment maximally pleasant, the snake puts itself forward. While God does not approve, the disapproval may be less categorical than it initially seems. I said earlier that the world is a difficult place for the biblical God as well as for men and women. If we take God to be an optimal knower, it would seem to follow that the possession of knowledge in the highest degree is not an unmixed blessing. Think of the prohibition in the garden of Eden from this stand- point. In denying Adam and Eve access to the fruit of the tree of knowledge, God would be withholding something that would make the inhabitants of the garden more godlike. The snake is</page><page sequence="26">474 SOUNDINGS Mark Glouberman speaking truthfully in telling Eve that as a result of eating "you will be like God" (Gen. 3.4). Though technically true, the snake's claim is nonetheless misleading. Contrary to what the woman clearly is meant to come to understand, the increased measure of godlikeness will not vault the garden dwellers into a position more blessed. "More godlike" does not entail "more blessed." The acquisition of the knowledge of good and evil will be the acquisition of a gift that they may live to regret. Is this not pre- cisely what God says? Because the woman has done this, her pangs in childbearing will increase. Because the man has lis- tened, his path in the world will be full of thorns and thistles. To many, the "because" clauses will seem to disconfirm my gloss. Isn't the claim not one about the kind of knowledge that Adam and Eve acquire, but about their violation of a prohibi- tion? Close reading reverses this judgement. The Hebrew trans- lated above as "because you have done this" can be rendered more exactly thus: "Having done this." If so, the curse is not nec- essarily the effect of the eating. Compare: "because you have drunk (or having drunk) a quart, you have consumed two pints." The relationship in the biblical case could be ampliative, not causative, a spelling out of what is implicit in the act rather than the assignment of a penalty for the act. The key fact is that this accords with God's own experience. In his encounters with the primordial chaos, he found that it would not obey his commands. I stress: he found this. The need for fur- ther separation from darkness was not anticipated when the light was first created. Similarly, knowledge is of good and evil, which must subsequently be kept apart. "Having this knowledge," God might be envisaged to say, "I am open, on the level of conscious awareness, to the difficulties." Like a caring parent, God wishes to shield those created in his image from this bitter awareness. Yet this shielding is only possible up to a point, the point at which they acquire the knowledge for themselves. The man and the woman are misled by the snake. Their pri- mary mistake is not, however, their transgression of a divine edict. They misunderstand what the act of disobedience carries in its wake. The snake literally spoke the truth. By eating, the man and the woman become godlike. But they, in their inno- cence, saw only a happy ending in this transition. To the woman, the fruit was "a delight to the eyes" (Gen. 3.6). Yet to the fruit</page><page sequence="27">Two Humanisms 475 attaches a very high price tag. We of the teaching profession in the West, influenced by Plato's Socrates, are programmed to re- peat to our students the slogan about the deficiency of the unex- amined life. Though the Bible reflects on life as deeply as any book, it teaches in many ways that the examined life suffers from deficiencies of its own. Damned if you do, it seems, and damned if you don't. The Hebrew here presents a tell-tale verbal play to the reader. At the end of Genesis 2, the man and the woman are described as naked (2.25). A bare half-dozen words later, the snake is called "crafty" (Gen. 3.1). The two words have the same three-letter root. In Hebrew, semantics tends to follow such roots. Whether or not a genuine semantic link exists, a story-line reason for the overlap can dimly be discerned. Since the annual molt comes to mind when one thinks of the snake, the reptile might aptly be described as "more crafty [sc. more naked] than any other wild animal that the Lord God had made." Thematic backing can be found for this construal. The appeal of the snake to the woman might well be on the grounds of simi- larity of condition. Both are naked. But the nakedness of the snake is deceptive. Its youthful appearance is like that of the person who has undergone a face-lift. The snake, from this standpoint, is a deceptive blend of old and young. It is interesting that, as lately noted, the deceptive- ness of appearance also attaches to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. What the woman sees as "a delight to the eyes" comes at a very high cost. What looks good sometimes turns out otherwise. There is a stunning resonance here with the repeated claim about God in the story of primordial creation: "and He saw that it was good." Could it be that what he saw was good wasn't unquali- fiedly so? This conclusion was reached pretty explicitly by Ecclesi- astes, who also makes a resonant remark about wisdom that might be directed towards philosophical Athens: "For in much wisdom is much vexation, and those who increase knowledge in- crease sorrow" (Eccles. 1.18). The last claim accords with how I have read the story in Genesis. The key point, however, is not that appearances can be deceiv- ing but that acknowledging difficulties can be empowering. It is in this way that I see the gazing upon the snake in Numbers. The</page><page sequence="28">476 SOUNDINGS Mark Glouberman Israelites are cured by looking on the snake. They are cured by recognizing that the difficulties are part of the nature of things. The harshness of their trek is not a punishment. It is just the way things are. Once the deceptiveness of the snake's message is ap- preciated, the deeper truth in its claim about godlikeness is revealed. It all fits together nicely. The snake is a common symbol in surrounding cultures. It is connected with medicine; it is con- nected with magic. The Bible does not spring forth ex nihilo. We might hypothesize the following: God too, in undertaking his ac- tions, was fooled by the snake. That is, he might have assumed that the value discovered in the human character would replace the magical-mysterious one without any other change. If so, he soon enough came to know better. What he came to know is ob- vious to "we wretched mortals." But, as I have told the story, the God of the Bible performs an imitatio humani. The God of the Bible, in his activity, prefigures the way of men and women in the world. The knowledge, the godlike knowledge, that men and wo- men acquire is the ordinary knowledge of men and women; it is not salvific.24 In this perspective, the caduceus represents the Bible's painful knowledge rather than the promise of healing. Zeus does away with Asclepius, the more accurate representative of the medical profession, for usurping a divine prerogative. But the divine pre- rogative - permanence, immutability - is here conceived along Greek lines, lines later extended by rational theologians of the Western philosophical tradition. The God of the Hebrew Bible holds out no hopes of ultimate salvation, only of struggle and fitful success. The best medicine for life is a clear-eyed under- standing of the position of men and women as men and women. It is only by refraining from eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge that a sense of the reality can be held at a distance. But innocence is a temporary state and, morally speaking, a re- fusal to face the facts. The snake, on the construal I advanced, is multiply naked, hence "more naked" than other creatures. Old as creation itself, it manages to look young. God himself, if we read the Bible care- fully, can be seen to get old as we mortals do, irreversibly. The story is a fantastic one. I will end with the merest sketch.</page><page sequence="29">Two Humanisms 477 Closest among Biblical characters to God is King David.25 De- spite his closeness to God, however, David remains human. Mor- tality is a feature of human reality, and King David also ages and dies. However, as the inevitable end approaches, some last at- tempts are made to forestall the inevitable. 2 Samuel 23 gives us an account of David's last words. The scripture reports that he "said longingly: 'O that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate!'" (2 Sam. 23.15). The task is fraught with danger, as "the Philistine was then at Bethlehem" (2 Sam. 23.14). Three warriors, at great personal risk, retrieve the water, but David does not drink what they bring. He "poured it out to the Lord" (2 Sam. 23.16). The Philistines are the national version of chaos, constantly harrying Israel at its borders. Water itself is a universal solvent, the natural version of chaos - a chaos that, in the flood of Noah, had cleansed the world for a fresh start. David, at this stage, recognizes that he can no longer contain the chaos within himself, as a king must do and as God did when he introduced order into the maelstrom. The warriors had endangered their lives for David. It is fitting, then, that they should have his responsibility for themselves. And, as God recedes, so must men and women take such responsibility. A comely maiden, Abishag the Shunammite, is procured for Daviďs bed to warm him. But while Abishag served David, "the king did not know her sexually" (1 Kings 1.4). Her nakedness cannot rejuvenate him. That is, from this union of old and young there is no issue. Even the king appreciates the limitation of medicine. The min- istrations of the snake lead to the underworld. The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream. NOTES 1. David hailed from Bethlehem. That the Christian story also commences slightly south of Jerusalem suggests that those responsible for the New Tes- tament recognized the alien-ness of the latter, which is, due to what David did after he assumed the throne, dead center in the Hebrew story. It was, of course, politically expedient for the early Christians not to sever ties with the religion in which they were raised. But there were some, e.g., Marcion, who argued, in my view correctly, that the theoretical content implicated a much stronger split.</page><page sequence="30">478 SOUNDINGS Mark Glouberman 2. "Bible" always refers to the Hebrew Scriptures. Throughout, I use The New Oxford Annotated Bible, New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) translation. 3. The Olympian pantheon, which Homer seems to have been centrally in- strumental in putting into an orderly form, was not formed at one go in one place. The marriage of Zeus and Hera has the look of a linkage of two dynastic houses. The goddesses, in a fashion that supports this construc- tion, turn out not to have Greek names. Given Herodotus's view that the Greek peoples came from Asia, a reasonable hypothesis is that the female deities have their origins in Crete, i.e., Knossos; possibly, they derive even from as far afield as North Africa. While the core Olympian gods are tribal gods with natural functions (for instance, Zeus represents thunder, rain, etc., and Poseidon represents the sea), goddesses like Athena (who become completely assimilated by Homer's time - she is made into Zeus' s daugh- ter) are nature deities (thus her association with the owl). In general, the males of the combined Olympian pantheon are sky deities, and the females are earth deities. The former are mainly concerned with issues of recogni- tion and honour; the latter, in contrast, concern themselves with the "mys- terious" issues such as rebirth, regeneration, and immortality. 4. The difference is one element of a complex mix that helps to explain why science developed on the Greek side alone. A quick insight can be gained by noting that the emergence of men and women on the scene is not ex- plained, on the Greek side, by reference to a divine plan. It follows that an investigation of the nature and origins of men and women is not, on this side, blocked by theology. Accordingly, while knowledge of ultimates can certainly be dangerous, it is not, save in some consequential sense, forbid- den. The idea of there being some moral scruple linked to the acquisition of certain kinds of knowledge has a basis on the Jerusalem side. 5. I have enumerated two elements. Since, certainly, no value attaches just to being finite and limited, it has to be possible (assuming that the valoriza- tion is not wholly arbitrary) to say more. 6. "Non-human" is not the same, I hasten to add, as "sub-human." According to the Christian view, men and women are essentially spiritual beings. They are super-human. The denial of humanity can be part of a position that seeks to exalt men and women, rather than diminish them. 7. All citations from the Iliad are from Robert Fagles s translation and are identified in the text by book and line number(s). 8. It is pleasing to see in Hermes' s role here (arranging the retrieval of the dead body) as a deliberate reversal by Homer of the role I mentioned ear- lier, viz., accompanying the dead to Hades. 9. Erich Auerbach s semmai work Mimesis played a large role in redeeming the Bible from the negative literary judgement. But because of the book's focus, the question of artistic merit is pursued without addressing the ques- tion of the Bible's overall integrity. 10. Let me refer to one case. Given our usual expectations about story-line con- tinuity, the Judah and Tamar episode of Genesis 38, which comes between Joseph's being sold by his brothers (Gen. 37) and the remainder of Jo- seph's life (Gen. 39ff.) comes across as a narrative-disrupting interpolation. Many biblical scholars, especially those focused on the composite character of the text, agree. In chapter 1 of The Art of Biblical Narrative, Robert Alter shows that the episode is part of the organic whole. See also E.A. Speiser's Genesis. 11. Homer's epics were, and very appropriately, centerpieces of the Panathe- naic festival, a cerebral counterpart of the Olympiad, held every four years</page><page sequence="31">Two Humanisms 479 since the days of the tyrant Pisistratus in the middle of the 6th century ВСЕ. A crowd-pleasing dramatic reading of the entire Pentateuch is, I think, a nonsense. Even Genesis would not lend itself well to the exercise. 12. This is not, of course, a voluntary matter. Achilles is foredoomed. He does not voluntarily renounce his divinity so much as win through to an unprec- edented appreciation of his condition. Achilles being fictional, this means that through the depiction of him Homer presents a dawning sense of the human as autonomous. 13. For reasons, some of which already emerged in the earlier discussion of complementarity and others of which I sell set out presently, I do not con- cede that humanism and theism are incompatible. 14. See footnote 17. 15. Obviously, there is some circularity here. It is deemed "better" because we, who regard ourselves as human, are the deemers. The unreconstructed war- riors at Troy would have seen Achilles, in his transformed moments, as crazv. 16. Taken as more than a thesis about the way God figures in the action, it also is an extreme form of the position that goes by the name "aniconicism." This is the view that any loss of personal integrity is a transgression, a form of idolatry. 17. Consider the twisted theophany given to Aaron's sons Nadab and Abihu: "Under [God's] feet there was something like a pavement of sapphire stone" (Exod. 24.10). Nadab and Abihu misunderstood the message. When, later, actuated by the vision they offer "unholy fire before the Lord, such as he had not commanded" (Lev. 10.1), God sent out a fire that con- sumed them. Nadab and Abihu are closely associated genealogically with Korah (Exod. 6.23-24), another pelf-heavy renegade who meets a violent end at God's hands. 18. Isn t just such an extra-terrestrial request made, and met, in the Hebrew Scriptures? See Joshua 10.12-14. Close reading reveals that the "miraculous" occurrences in the older part of the Bible are with few exceptions drawn from a restricted class. (Even in the case of the stalling of the sun at Gibeon, the text is careful to state: "There has been no day like it before or since, when the Lord heeded a human voice" (Josh. 10.14). One might, mutatis mutandis, put these words into the mouth of a particularly hen- pecked suburbanite. "Never before or since were the eggs done exactly as I like.") Overall, we find that what the holy men and women bring about usually can be made sense of in natural terms. The reviving of the dead takes roughly the form of artificial respiration or transfer of body heat; the provision of food and drink in the desert takes the form of drilling for groundwater and intersecting the flight path of migrating quail. 19. "Stephanus numbers" - corresponding to the pages and subdivisions in the 16th-century edition of Plato by Etienne (Stephanus) - appear in the margins of most modern translations of Plato's work, so are given here for general reference. 20. The word from Genesis 1.2 translated as "the deep" derives from "Tiamat," the name of the Babylonian water goddess. Excavations at Ras Shamra in Syria in 1929 unearthed Canaanite writings that shed light on the otherwise baffling reference in Job 2.7 to "yamm." The word in Hebrew means "sea." The newfound texts indicated that in pre-biblical epics of the region the word named the sea god. See Alter 13. 21. The claim is reported by Aristotle in On the Soul (61; Bekker 411a7-8). Thaïes apparently has in mind the magnetic characteristics of metals, which</page><page sequence="32">480 SOUNDINGS Mark Glouberman make themselves felt in attraction and repulsion. (The "Bekker" number refers to the page, column, and line number in Immanuel Bekker's 1831 edition of the Greek text. Bekker numbers appear in the margins of most modern translations of Aristotle's work.) 22. Asclepius's staff, which has only one snake, is forked. (The staff itself is perhaps a stylized symbol of the forked-tongued creature.) While the US Public Health Service makes use of the much more familiar caduceus, the American Medical Association's icon, like that of its Canadian and British counterparts, is Asclepian. 23. The Israeli medical establishment, for much the same reason as it replaces the Red Cross with a red Star of David, employs the symbol drawn from Numbers, a single snake and a pole. 24. Consider a parallel. The snake is responsible for the introduction of death (mortality) into the world. Cain (shortly thereafter in the narrative) is re- sponsible for introducing death as a human act into the world. What does God say to Cain? "If you do well, will you not be accepted?" (Gen. 4.6-7) The possibility that, as Samson's riddle has it, sweet will come from bitter (seejudg. 14.14) God didn't (yet) see in the case of the snake. The snake was crafty. God was naïve. God learns too, slowly, just as do men and women. 25. For some of the scriptural details, see my essay "The Counter Bible: West- ern Culture and the Self-Critical Book," section 6.
