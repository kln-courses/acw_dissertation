<plain_text><page sequence="1">ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS TO BE DELIVERED AT THE 1978 PACIFIC DIVISION MEETING The following abstracts are arranged in alphabetical order by the author's name. In the instance, where there are two authors, the name of the first author will be alphabetized in order. ON THE ROLE OF MORAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE ALLOCATION OF EXOTIC MEDICAL LIFESAVING THERAPY Robert Almeder In his paper "The Allocation of Exotic Medical Lifesaving Therapy" Rescher proposes various criteria to be employed as part of a decision procedure for allocating scarce medical therapy. After arguing that at least six of the criteria are unacceptable, I argue that no moral criteria should be employed in any decision procedure of this sort and that those patients who are to receive the therapy should be chosen from a fair lottery consisting of all and only those patients who have satisfied a likelihood-of-success criterion. MILL'S DOUBTS ABOUT FREEDOM UNDER SOCIALISM Richard J. Ameson Although John Stuart Mill was inconstant in his opinions about property, to the end of his career he retained qualms about socialism which kept him from advocating that form of economic organization, which he identified with com- mon ownership of most economic tools for the purpose of securing some degree of economic equality among the common owners. One major worry was that a socialist organization of society would likely reduce individual freedom below the level that could be maintained under a system of private ownership. Mill gives several arguments to support this worry, and he hints at others. Canvass- ing the strongest of these arguments, this paper finds that none of them supplies a reasonable basis for Mill's fears concerning the future of liberty under social- ism. 447</page><page sequence="2">APA PROCEEDINGS SEEING-OF AS SEEING-AS John Bacon The seeing of an object can be analyzed as seeing it as something. Seeing-as is in turn analyzable by means of seeing-that, or propositional seeing. As the reverse analysis does not seem to be possible, theories of knowledge which construct judgmental perception out of sensations are called into question. ON BEGINNING TO EXIST: HUME'S TWO QUESTIONS Jose A. Bernardete In the course of his effort to show that " 'twill be easy for us to conceive any object to be non-existent this moment and existent the next without conjoin- ing to it the distinct idea of a cause" Hume has occasion to consider two ques- tions "on this subject," namely "whether the object shall exist or not" and "when and where it shall begin to exist." Both being taken to be open ques- tions, we are in effect being asked to believe that "the object" might just as well come to exist ex nihilo today in Athens as a thousand years ago on Mars. Hume's fantasy is shown to be by no means"easy to conceive", his second question proving critical in regard to transworld identity, as topics involving absolute place, personal identity, material causes and individual essences are explored. HUME'S DIFFICULTIES WITH THE SELF John Biro Hume's theory of the self is often alleged to have a fundamental flaw: that his theory of belief, used to account for our belief in the identity of the self, itself presupposes the very self whose identity is in question. This paper sketches how Hume may be defended against this charge by 1) taking into account the order in which he addresses different questions in the Treatise, so that we can see that the language suggesting the circularity need not be taken at face value and 2) emphasizing and clarifying his distinc- tion between "perfect" and "imperfect" identity, so that we can reconcile the parts of the theory which require a subject for the activities which are involved in the theory of belief, with those which purport to explain how the meaning of, and our belief in, that very subject is constituted by those activities. 448</page><page sequence="3">ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS WELFARE AND FREEDOM Norman Bowie Except for a few libertarians, most moral philosophers agree that everyone in a relatively affluent country is entitled to a minimum standard of living. I argue, however, that it is at least questionable whether morality demands that one class of poor be provided a minimum standard of living. My argu- ment can be presented in the form of a dilemma. A certain class of persons is either responsible for their plight or they are powerless to do anything about it. If they are responsible for their plight, then prima facie they are not en- titled to a minimum standard of living. If they are not responsible but rather are powerless victims, then the cost in terms of freedom in providing the right to a minimum standard of living may be morally objectionable. INTENTION: SIMPLE AND CONDITIONAL Michael Bratman One may conditionally intend to X if , and one may simply intend to X. A natural view of the relation between these two kinds of intentions - held by Castaneda, Kim and others -- is that if one intends to X if p and one believes that j then (if one is rational) one simply intends to X. I consider two ob- jections to such a view. The first involves cases of believing that p but also believing that, at the time of action, one will believe that not-p. To deal with such cases we must impose certain constraints on the conditions which can enter into conditional intentions. The second objection involves cases in which one believes that p but is carrying out a plan which, if successful, would result in not-p. These cases provide genuine counter-examples to the view in ques- tion. To deal with them we need to consider the relation between intentions and plans of action. I conclude by suggesting how such a consideration sheds light on certain questions about one's praiseworthiness/blameworthiness for one's future-directed intentions. SELF-INSTANTIATING INFORMATION Brian Cooney Brain function is an organ-level specialization in the kind of adaptive control function exercised by DNA over the metabolism of a unicellular organism. 449</page><page sequence="4">APA PROCEEDINGS Consequently, there ought to be a connection between what is said about the ontological status of mental functions and what is said about DNA regula- tory activity. In this paper Aristotle's form/matter distinction is interpreted in terms of the thermodynamic concept of information and applied to the relation between a unicellular organism's genetic information and its internal, physico-chemical environment. This application yields a distinction between the cell's genetic information and its internal environment which is real, but nevertheless entails (1) that genetic information and its internal environment (like substantial form and matter) cannot exist separately, and (2) that each is a necessary component of a living body. This distinction, applied to the mind- body problem, would avoid the hopeless dichotomy of dualism and materialism. NAMING AND MODALITY W. Stephen Croddy Quine has argued that proper names can be reparsed as predicates and that essentialism is unacceptable, in particular as it pertains to modal logic. With regard to this I will attempt to establish the following: (a) There are two respects in which the reparsing thesis implies essen- tialism. (b) The reparsing thesis is inconsistent with modal logic. The claim that essentialism is unacceptable is necessary to Quine's criticism of modal logic. Hence the import of (a) is this: If (a) is true, then either pro- per names cannot be reparsed as predicates or the argument against modal logic in terms of essentialism fails. Quine maintains that the reparsing thesis is neutral with regard to the accepta- bility of modal logic. It follows from (b) that this is false. So his argument for why modal logic is unacceptable should not be that it requires essentialism. But rather that it implies that proper names cannot be reparsed. COLLINGWOOD ON RE-ENACTING THE ERRORS OF THE PAST Eugene Garver Alan Donagan, in his book on Collingwood, says that Collingwood's view of history in the Autobiography implies the absurd conclusion that only success- 450</page><page sequence="5">ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS ful thoughts and actions can be re-enacted and therefore understood by the historian. But the claim that only past successes can be re-enacted is (1) not prima faciae absurd and (2) suggested by Collingwood's own analysis of the thesis that all history is the history of thought in the Idea of History. How it is possible, if at all, for a historian to re-enact unsuccessful thoughts, then, is a question that demands careful solution. The solution I offer clarifies the idea of re-enactment and the thesis that all history is the history of thought. THE PARTI-RESULTANT STATUS OF PRIMA FACIE OBLIGATION T. R. Girill Prima facie duties are those which are defeasible - they can be canceled by extenuating circumstances, over-ridden by more stringent obligations, or other- wise annulled. Ross and Chisholm have suggested with considerable plausi- bility that the property (of an action) of being someone's prima facie duty is a parti-resultant property, and that such duties are defeasible precisely because they are parti-resultant. This paper shows, however, that under one very appeal- ing interpretation of the term 'parti-resultant', 1) prima facie obligation is not strictly speaking parti-resultant after all, and 2) in any case, being parti-resultant is insufficient to explain being defeasible. ORGANIZATIONS AND MORAL RESPONSIBILITY Kenneth E. Goodpaster The paper examines the applicability of the notion of 'moral responsibility' to formal organizational agents (paradigmatically: corporations) in the face of certain conceptual barriers that have been thought to attend such a move. Specifically, it has been argued by some that organizational rationality and moral responsibility are logically incompatible, each involving elements ruled out by the other. I argue, to the contrary, that this view relies upon indefen- sible models on both fronts and that once the ideals of rationality and morality are clarified, a clear space is provided for the application of moral categories (descriptively and normatively) to corporate agents. The significance of this space is considerable for those who take seriously the need for theories of "corporate conscience." 451</page><page sequence="6">APA PROCEEDINGS THE 'A PRIORI' AND THE EMPIRICAL IN MERLEAU-PONTY'S PHENOMENOLOGY OF PERCEPTION Harrison Hall A number of passages in Phenomenology of Perception suggest that Merleau- Ponty wants to collapse entirely the distinction between the 'a priori' and the empirical, between 'truths of reason' and 'truths of fact.' I argue that his dis- cussion of one of the theorems of Euclidean geometry reveals a less ambitious and more plausible aim -- namely, a demonstration that 'a priori' truths may be characterized by features traditionally applicable only to empirical truths, and vice versa. Merleau-Ponty's discussion of the 'a priori' and the empirical simply brings the two a little closer together, stressing the similarities and interconnections traditionally ignored in favor of the obvious differences. If there is one world, if the 'world of reason' and the 'world of fact' are capable of forming together a single fabric, the structure of these two 'worlds' cannot be so different as to make their interrelation incomprehensible. EPISTEMOLOGICAL REASONS FOR A POSITIVE ROLE FOR SOCIAL VALUES IN SOCIAL SCIENCE Sandra Harding The moral and social values of the scientist have generally been regarded as an obstacle to maximizing objectivity in social inquiry. The maximally objective inquiry would be the one the results of which held across the greatest number of relevantly various observers. But inquiries in which the scientist's moral and social values play a role always produce particularistic accounts, it is thought; ones which are less than maximally universally acceptable. While Peter Winch and Ernest Gellner, among others and in different ways, have opposed this way of thinking about social science and have identified one and two ways, respectively, in which the scientist's moral and social values can contribute to maximizing the objectivity of social inquiries, I think there are four such ways. In all four cases, it is not the presence but the suspension of certain of the inquirer's social values which contributes to biased accounts. Thus I shall argue that for epistemological reasons the social scientists should be committed to certain moral/social values. 452</page><page sequence="7">ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS ARISTOTLE AND THE DEFINITION OF NATURAL THINGS J. E. Hare This paper is an exploration of what Aristotle means when he says in Meta- physics VII, chapters 4 and 5, that the accounts of things like snub noses fail 'by addition'. Since 'the snub' is one of his standard examples of a naturally existing thing, it is interesting to see in what sense, if any, he wants to deny that it has a true definition. The paper suggests that he proposes three accounts as candidates for the status of definition, and they all fail; the first because the definiendum is included in the proposed definiens, the second because one thing is added to a different thing, and the third because the same thing is said twice. The paper lays out the argument which lies behind these failures, and shows how it derives from the basic supposition that there are two dis- tinct kinds of thing of which naturally existing things are composed. EYESHADOW, AESTHETICS, AND MORALITY Helen Heise Any person wanting to reject sexism and exploitation asks whether s/he ought to be concerned with self-beautification which may be thought to be associated with treating people as sex objects and other kinds of exploitation. I argue that an interest in being aesthetically pleasing is not the same as an interest in being sexy. Sexiness invites a set of sexual actions, though these may not be acted out. Aesthetic pleasingness invites contemplation of the aesthetic object, in this case, a person. Being a person aesthetic object is preferable to being a sex object even though both provide pleasure for others because in being an aesthe- tic object one is also a source of pleasure to oneself, and one is not only object but producer of this object. An interest in being one's best aesthetic self is good because it develops and responds to a fundamental and important aspect of persons. UNDERSTANDING THE REALIST TENDENCY IN THE CINEMA Edward W. Hudlin Realism as a special movement in the cinema is often dismissed by philosophers and critics as an impossibly naive theory. It is my contention that the tendency on the part of many critics to dismiss the realist thesis in this way is due to their confusion as to the substance of the realist doctrine. 453</page><page sequence="8">APA PROCEEDINGS The stock objection to the realist theory is that it presupposes the doctrines of the "innocent eye" and the "artless style"; moreover, it is thought to restrict the freedom of the artist. So, because they reject these doctrines upon which realism supposedly depends, the opponents of realism are thus led to reject the realist thesis itself. In the present discussion, I contend that, on the contrary, realism does not depend on these doctrines; moreover, the belief that realism does depend on these doctrines has to do with oversights and confusions attending the efforts of critics to explicate the realist theory itself. What I want to maintain speci- fically is that realism, when properly understood, is defensible against these objections; and thus I want ultimately to force a reassessment of the realist approach to the cinema. I will take as an example the work of Siegfried Kracauer for two reasons: (1) Kracauer's work is perhaps the most complete and systematic statement of the realist thesis; and, (2) I believe that such of the misunderstanding of the realist doctrine stems from the controversies provoked by his major work on the cinema Theory of Film. THE UNHISTORICAL BASIS OF KUHN'S THEORY OF SCIENCE Janet Kourany In recent years, philosophers of science have been wont to congratulate them- selves for paying a greater attention to the history of science than their positi- vistic predecessors. Thomas Kuhn, in particular - a historian of science as well as a philosopher - has claimed that his development-by-replacement theory of science represents the kind of "decisive transformation" in older conceptions of science that only a closer attention to factual details can produce. When we investigate the basis of Kuhn's theory, it is with considerable surprise, there- fore, that we discover trivial truths, unfounded (and false) speculations, and undocumented claims far more frequently than the detailed historical data that had been promised. Such, at any rate, is what is argued in the present paper. HARMAN ON DOING SOMETHING INTENTIONALLY Neil Lubow In his article "Practical Reasoning," Gilbert Harman proposes a theory of intentions which includes an analysis of 'X does A intentionally'. In this paper 454</page><page sequence="9">ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS I argue that Harman's analysis excludes certain cases of doing something in- tentionally and thus is seriously defective. I also argue that Harman's analysis is incompatible with Davidson's theory of act identity. VAN FRAASSEN ON SCIENTIFIC REALISM Edward MacKinnon In his recent writings Bas van Fraassen has attacked scientific realism and pro- posed a neo-Duhemian instrumentalism as an alternative interpretation. His attack has two prongs. The first argues that the ontic realism developed by Quine and Sellars is really a metaphysical imposition based on methodological idealism, rather than a scientific realism. The second, and more important, reason is that van Fraassen has developed a method for the rational reconstruc- tion of scientific theories based on semantic representations in state space. In this formulation quantum mechanics may be reconstructed in a way that does not seem to involve any ontic commitment to the real existence of atoms and particles. After outlining this reconstruction I will argue that the instrumenta- list interpretation van Fraassen gives it involves serious pragmatic inconsisten- cies not present in a realist interpretation. MILL ON JUSTICE AND NEGATIVE UTILITY C. D. MacNiven Philosophers have frequently argued that the principle of utility -- the pro- duction of the greatest amount of good for the greatest number of people -- cannot be the sole fundamental principle of morality, either because the just and the expedient conflict or because the principle of utility is concerned only with the production of good and doesn't pay sufficient attention to the distri- bution of good. If this is the case they conclude that there must be at least one other fundamental principle of morality, perhaps a more fundamental one, that of justice. In this paper I do at least three things. First, I try to get as clear as I can Mill's defense against the claim that justice and utility are distinct moral principles, as he presented it in Chapter V of Utilitarianism, "On the Connection Between Justice and Utility." Second, I argue, that once this defense, which relies on making the principle of non-malevolence (Don't harm others!) the supreme principle of morality of social control (a morality of requirements, prohibitions and permissions, backed up with social sanctions of some kind), is clearly understood (and an important modification added), that the two familiar criticisms of the principle of utility, noted above, will 455</page><page sequence="10">APA PROCEEDINGS no longer hold. Finally, I conclude that if Mill's defense of the principle of utility is successful this would provide strong support for Mill's position that a morality of social control might best be worked out in terms of the princi- ple of non-malevolence. NIETZSCHE'S MITIGATED SKEPTICISM Bernd Magnus Nietzsche's remarks on truth and knowledge have led analytically inclined commentators to conflicting characterizations. Danto regards him as a 'philo- sophical nihilist,' while Wilcox cites the same remarks to support the anti- pathetic 'cognitivist' ascription. Rather than choose between competing characterizations, which are judged inadequate, a different paradigm is pro- posed to capture Nietzsche's intended relation between 'truth,' 'knowledge,' and 'perspective.' It is argued that for Nietzsche knowledge is like a recon- structed text: The world is like the inaccessible original. Finally, it is sug- gested that Nietzsche's epistemic remarks appear far from nihilistic when con- trasted with those of Peter Unger, for example, to which they bear a striking if inadvertent family resemblance. HUME, PLANTINGA, AND THE RATIONALITY OF BELIEF IN GOD Kenneth R. Merrill In God and Others Minds Alvin Plantinga ingeniously constructs a series of arguments whose final conclusion is that belief in God must be rational if belief in other minds is. In this paper I briefly set out Plantinga's general line of argument and try to show that his conclusion is a non sequitur even if we grant everything that he offers by way of premisses. I then explore, along Humean lines, how we might broaden our notion of rationality so as to permit us to distinguish between unprovable beliefs that are rational and those that are not. Hume suggests irresistibility and personal/social utility as possible tests for rationality among non-demonstrable beliefs. Irresistibility proves to be of dubious value, but utility is more promising. To put the issue in a larger setting, I make a brief comparison between Hume and three other great philosophers (Plato, Aristotle, and Descartes) on the status of basic principles. 456</page><page sequence="11">ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS WANTING, INTENDING, AND KNOWING WHAT ONE IS DOING Arthur R. Miller This paper is an examination of the relationship between the agent's knowledge or awareness of what he is doing and the concept of intentional action. The discussion proceeds via a critical analysis of the thesis that intending entails wanting, a claim which boasts a long and venerable list of defenders. With respect to a certain class of actions, it is shown that the implications of adhering to this position are clearly unacceptable; and, consequently, that although wanting is a frequent accompaniment of - it is by no means a necessary con- dition for -- intentional action. From this I conclude that, all things being equal, an agent intends that which he knowingly does or causes to happen, regardless of his specific desires or aversions. THE CENTRAL SENSE AND THE UNITY OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE PARVA NATURALIA Deborah Modrak In the psychological treatises, Aristotle uses a number of different terms which appear to refer to a central sense or its organ. He also ascribes a number of activities to the referrent(s) of these terms: it perceives the activities of the special senses; it presents the memory image; and its activity is necessary to waking experience. Traditionally all these activities were assigned to one cen- tral sense faculty, the sensus communis. Recently, this practice has been chal- lenged, most notably by Hamlyn. In the first part of the paper, it is argued that an examination of the relevant texts decides the issue in favor of the tradi- tional interpretation. The second part, noting the wide variety of psychological activities Aristotle assigns the central sense, considers whether his conception of a central sense faculty could provide the foundation for an Aristotelian theory of conscious- ness. It is argued that Aristotle uses this conception to account for the unity of consciousness, but that he fails to develop a full-fledged theory of conscious- ness. 457</page><page sequence="12">APA PROCEEDINGS THE COMPATIBILITY OF HUME'S TWO DEFINITIONS OF CAUSE William E. Morris Hume defined cause twice. He said that his definitions were "only different by their presenting a different view of the same object." J. A. Robinson argued that this is not possible. Hume's definitions of cause, he maintained, are pro- vably incompatible: they are neither equivalent in meaning nor coextensive. Subsequent contributors to the dispute begin with Robinson's conclusion. They assume that a correct account of Hume's views must be a corrected one. His "extraordinary ambivalence" must be explained away by deletion or rein- terpretation. Recent attempts to do this have two prominent features in com- mon: they attend closely to the details of Hume's definitions of cause, and ignore his definition of definition. This is understandable. Hume has at best a fledgling theory of definition. But its neglect by his interpreters is unfortu- nate. For as I argue in this essay, that theory provides a key to the solution of Robinson's problem about the compatibility of Hume's two definitions of cause. JEALOUS THOUGHTS Jerome Neu Beliefs are essential constituents of emotions, and so sorting out some of the beliefs involved in jealousy and their empirical conditions should enable us to better understand the place of jealousy in human life. It is argued that despite the hopes of social reformers, the possibility of jealousy cannot be eliminated. Its presence and persistence have more to do with the develop- ment of self-identity than with the possession of others; and while the under- lying fears may make us prone to pathological forms of jealousy it is also the case that jealousy is tied to certain forms of love - so the elimination of the possibility of jealousy might involve the loss of much else. BEYOND "JUST SAVINGS" Ernest Partidge "Justice between generations," according to John Rawls, is accomplished when each generation sets aside "savings" for the succeeding generation which serve to "preserve the gains of culture and civilization. .. maintain intact those just institutions that have been established, . . . [and] put aside in each period 458</page><page sequence="13">ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS of time a suitable amount of real capital accumulation." Contrary to Rawl's principle of "just savings," I argue (a) that just provision for the future must involve a deliberate and informed concern for remote generations, as well as adjacent generations, and (b) that just provision must involve several addi- tional dimensions not discussed or acknowledged by Rawls. Among these additional dimensions of just provision are: "just anticipation" by means of "impact studies," etc., "just forebearances" from causing future harm, "just restitution" for past errors and excesses, and "just stewardship" of the planetary ecosystem. HEALTH, CARE, AND HEALTH CARE Joseph Petrick This paper is an attempt to link two philosophical areas, bioethics and existential phenomenology, by demonstrating the need for a Heideggerian perspective in contemporary western health care. My approach consists of (i) delineating the history of western health care and the three undesirable human conse- quences that it has entailed and (ii) arguing for the remedial impact of a serious application of Heidegger's themes of care (Sorge) and authenticity (Eigent- lichkeit) to health care theory and practice. INFINITE JUSTIFICATIONAL REGRESSES John F. Post One of the links in the regress argument for foundationalism is the rejection of infinite justificational regresses. Despite the almost universal agreement that such regresses should be rejected, the reasons given for rejecting them leave much to be desired. I attempt an argument against infinite regresses that is free, I hope, of the flaws in the arguments to date. It turns out that such regresses should be rejected on conceptual grounds, entailed by uncon- troversial features of any plausible relation of rational justification. No founda- tionalist moral follows: there remain those other links. Instead of pursuing the complex issue of whether anyone is entitled to them, I conclude with a moral that can be drawn far more readily: for purely conceptual reasons, there cannot be an infinite regress of explanations, given most concepts of explana- tion. As a result, key versions of the Principle of Sufficient Reason can be refuted. 459</page><page sequence="14">APA PROCEEDINGS TRUTH IN FICTION Richard Purtill In this paper I examine three theories as to what kind of truth we find in works of fiction. I attempt to combine the strongest features of these three theories. I then use this combined theory to discuss briefly the question of the value of artistic truth. INDETERMINACY, UNDER-DETERMINATION AND TRUTH Steven Rappaport Though there is a good deal of philosophical literature concerned with Quine's well-known thesis of the indeterminacy of translation, there is in fact little agreement as to what the thesis affirms. The key issue in the divergence over the meaning of the indeterminacy thesis, is whether the thesis is more than an instance of the principle that a theory is under-determined by whatever experiential data in its favor we possess; and if so, what constitutes the addi- tional content to the indeterminacy thesis. We state and defend an interpreta- tion of Quine's indeterminacy thesis according to which it affirms considerably more than an instance of under-determination of theory by data. In our dis- cussion we bring out more adequately than has been done hitherto the connec- tion between indeterminacy and Quine's views on truth. In addition, we have occasion to touch on various relatively neglected matters such as Quine's view about the relation between an expression in one language and its correct trans- lation in another language. ON ILLUSION AND REALITY: SOME COMMENTS ON GOODMAN'S AND GOMBRICH'S THEORIES OF REPRESENTATION Sheldon Richmond Goodman and Gombrich's theories of representation challenge our common- sense views about reality and illusion in different ways. The purpose of this paper is to explore how they do so. I argue that both challenge the view that reality and illusion are distinct and discrete. However, Goodman's view of representation (which is that representational pictures convey information through their mode of functioning in a symbolic scheme) is found to presuppose the view that illusion and reality vary with and are internal to symbolic systems. Gombrich's view of representation (which is that representational pictures convey information through their illusory qualities) is found to presuppose the view that illusion and reality though distinct, differ only in degree. 460</page><page sequence="15">ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS BERKELEY'S WORLD OF IDEAS Stephen Rosenbaum Because of a latent inconsistency in Berkeley's writings, his metaphysics faces a dilemma. One must interpret Berkeley either as giving up his doctrine of direct perception and accepting a kind of representationism or as accepting an identity between divine and human ideas and believing in a realm of ideas which is intersubjectively accessible to all minds. I defend the second inter- pretation. My paper thus provides a firm foundation for parts of A. A. Luce's somewhat doctrinnaire interpretation of Berkeley and casts serious doubt on contemporary treatments of Berkeley's views about the relation between divine and human ideas and about the relation between minds and ideas generally. THE SUPERVENIENCE OF FITNESS IN EVOLUTIONARY THEORY Alexander Rosenberg This paper represents part of a larger program in which the notion of super- venience is employed to account for the relations between concepts and theories of differing levels of generality in biological science. Employing a notion of supervenience lately taken up by Davidson in connection with issues in the philosophy of mind, I attempt to show that fitness, as employed in the theory of natural selection bares a relation of supervenience to predicates that figure in other theories in the life sciences, and that this fact both explains why the theory of natural selection is not a tautological one, and also explains why biologists as well as philosophers have so often taken it for a theory empty of empirical content. I go on to try to show that it is only by treating fitness as supervenient on predicates in these other theories that we can see exactly what the relation is between them and evolutionary theory, and only through such a treatment can we understand the functions which attributions of differ- ential fitness play in genetic and ecological thought. HEIDEGGER AND THE IDENTITY OF SCIENTIFIC OBJECTS Hans Seigfried In the context of a Heideggerian discussion of the identity of scientific objects 461</page><page sequence="16">APA PROCEEDINGS I try to demonstrate how it may be possible (1) to state the case for or against reductive scientific realism more forcefully than has been done so far, and (2) to restate the problem behind reductive scientific realism in a way which makes it amenable to less controversial solutions. SEXUAL DESIRE AND SEXUAL OBJECTS Alan Soble I examine the analysis of sexuality recently offered by Alan Goldman ("Plain Sex," Philosophy and Public Affairs, 6, 1977, 267-287), that sexual desire is desire for contact with another person's body and for the pleasure which such contact produces. I argue that his analysis (1) is both too broad and too narrow, (2) is mistaken in linking conceptually the desire and its object, (3) yields a sexual ethic that is too restrictive, (4) is regressive in that it supports romanti- cism, a sexual double-standard and sexual possessiveness, and (5) has an un- acceptable conclusion about sexual relations with persons who are not visually attractive. En passant, I argue that the correct analysis of "plain sex" is Freud's: sexual desire is just the desire for certain pleasurable sensations, no matter how these may be causally produced. HOW TO COMPLETE THE COMPATIBILIST ACCOUNT OF FREE ACTION Janet A. Kourany James P. Sterba In its long and venerable career as a subject of philosophical debate, determinism has always appeared enticing. But determinism has always appeared threatening as well, since it has always appeared to rule out human freedom and responsi- bility. And this, despite all the effort and ingenuity that have been expended at least since the time of Hume toward showing that determinism and freedom are fully compatible. We suggest that what has been lacking in the compatibilist tradition, and what is crucially important, is an adequately detailed and complete analysis of the claim that a person could have acted otherwise than he did (the hallmark of freedom for most writers on the subject), one that does not contain an "abso- lute," unanalyzable "can" "grinning residually up at us like the frog at the bottom of the beer mug." We provide such an analysis, and defend it against a number of possible objections. 462</page><page sequence="17">ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS THE COGNITIVE THEORY OF EMOTIONS Marvin C. Sterling Robert C. Solomon has recently suggested that emotions are just a species of judgments; this is the main contention of his book The Passions. But not only does Solomon assert that emotions are nothing but a certain kind of judgment, he also claims that this cognitive conception of emotions has a num- ber of important consequences. In my paper I focus on two of these alleged consequences of the cognitive theory. Specifically, I am concerned to discuss the following suggestions: (1) If emotions are just a species of judgments, then emotions are always things that we actively do, and (2) If emotions are just a species of judgements, then we are invariably responsible for our emotions. I argue that even if Solomon is right about the "judgmental" nature of emo- tions as such, it nonetheless does not follow--as he apparently believes-either that emotions are invariably things that we actively do, or that we are invariably responsible for our emotions. ATTRIBUTES AND EXPLANATIONS F. C. Swoyer It is sometimes said that arguments for the existence of attributes are best viewed as inferences to the best explanation. It is here argued that such a view has two virtues which are often overlooked. First, it provides a method for settling certain questions about the nature of properties. Second, it helps us to better understand many of the arguments advanced by realists and nomi- nalists down through the ages. In particular, it highlights the fact that much contemporary nominalism is, at bottom, a claim about the role, nature and limits of explanation in philosophy. To bring these rather abstract claims down to earth, I sketch several sorts of explanations which attributes might be thought to provide, concluding with a brief discussion of the nature of such explanations. 463</page><page sequence="18">APA PROCEEDINGS PRICHARD'S RADICAL VOLITIONISM Ronald Talmage The idea of volition, once severely criticized, has gained new life in recent action theory. There seem to be roughly at last two types of volitional theo- ries of action: 'moderate volitionism', in which volitions are held to be practi- cal thoughts that somehow generate actions, and 'radical volitionism', in which volitions are considered to be the only actions. In this paper I will examine the radical volitionism of H. A. Prichard, and a recent defense of it by Bruce Aune. Prichard's theory is not well understood, partly because what is often taken to be his argument that all actions are willings is actually just a series of asser- tions. I will first identify four assumptions that Prichard leaves unargued. An attempt to provide a rationale for the fourth assumption, that actions cannot every be physical movements, reveals what I believe is Prichard's only truly controversial premise, namely that actions are the cause of movements. It is this latter assumption, which I think is central to his argument, that leads rather inevitably to the conclusion that all actions are willings. I conclude by stating some of the awkward consequences of this assumption, and giving what I think are cogent reasons for rejecting it. ARISTOTLE'S METAPHYSICS Z 13 Henry Teloh Aristotle's Metaphysics Z 13 is usually thought to provide the strongest evidence for the claim that (1) no universal is substance. Aristotle also believes that (2) form is substance, and that (3) form is universal. But (1), (2), and (3) appear to be an inconsistent triad. I will argue, however, that Z 13 does not and is not intended to attack the claim that Aristotle's universal is substance. Z 13 is part of an extensive assault (Z 13-16) on the Platonists' Forms. Z 13 criticizes the Platonists' belief that what is "one over many" is both a unversal that can be common to many and a substance that is "one in number" and hence an individual. But no individual can be common to many. Sinze Z 13 does not attack Aristotle's universal, we cannot appeal to it to formulate the above inconsistency. 464</page><page sequence="19">ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS CAUSAL SUFFICIENCY Gerald Vision I am interested in the consequences for singular causal statements of distin- guishing between the specification of part of a cause and the partial specifi- cation of a whole cause. Davidson remarks the distinction accounts for cer- tain erroneous notions in Mill's philosophy. But there can be no partial speci- fications of whole causes unless sense can be made of alternative descriptions of a single cause. Thus, before examining the consequences of the original distinction, I first attempt to show that we can have such alternative descrip- tions. Finally, taking concrete events as causes it is argued that the distinction collapses and that what was thought to be a disqualifying fault of a factative analysis of causal statements -- viz. their demonstrable truth-functionality -- has its analogue in the concrete event analysis. COLLINGWOOD'S THEORY OF ABSOLUTE PRESUPPOSITIONS Carol N. Wallace Interpretations of Collingwood's theory of absolute presuppositions may be classified into three broad categories according to whether they construe abso- lute presuppositions as theoretical statements, regulative principles, or expres- sions of faith. I argue that all three types of interpretation are mistaken and attempt to explain these errors as resulting from a single source-a misunder- standing of Collingwood's principle of the unity of the mind. An alternative interpretation of absolute presuppositions as metaphorical and anthropomorphic is presented. I try to show that this interpretation improves upon previous ones in that it accounts for all the characteristics Collingwood attributes to absolute presuppositions, while remaining faithful to his doctrine that the mind is one in all its activities. DUMMETT ON FREGE'S DEFINITIONS William Walters Michael Dummett has claimed that Frege made use of contextual definitions in his Grundlagen der Arithmetik, while rejecting this practice in later works. But the Grundlagen definitions that Dummett has in mind are not contextual definitions, I argue. Appreciating just what they are sheds light on Frege's logicism. 465</page><page sequence="20">APA PROCEEDINGS THE PURSUIT AND SACRIFICE OF HAPPINESS Gary Watson In this paper, I examine the notion of (deliberately) sacrificing one's happi- ness. After sketching two plausible conceptions of happiness, I note some problems with making sense of sacrifice on these conceptions. I claim that the notion of (deliberate) sacrifice requires the idea of holding (and being motivated by) certain ideals which place limits upon the pursuit of happiness. But this shows, I think, that our concept of happiness is ideal-neutral in a sense which casts doubt upon its importance for moral theory. Our ambiva- lence about happiness, in theory 8 practice, is due to some degree to this fea- ture of ideal-neutrality. For these reasons, the concept of meaningful activity is a much more important concept for moral theory than that of happiness. THE PRINCIPLE OF NONINTERVENTION: A CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF A CONTRACTARIAN JUSTIFICATION Mark R. Wicclair Rawls' programmatic statements in A Theory of Justice pertaining to a con- tractarian justification of the law of nations are applied to the principle of nonintervention, a principle which states that it is illegitimate for a state or states acting in concert to intervene in the internal affairs of other states. A contractarian approach will serve to justify the principle of nonintervention only if two conditions are satisfied: (1) It must be shown that the parties to the international social contract would prefer the principle of noninter- vention to any competing alternative. (2) It has to be shown that the selection of that principle in a hypothetical international original position supports the proposition that the principle of nonintervention is an ethically binding prin- ciple which should be recognized and respected by the governments of actual nation states. Each of these conditions is brought to bear upon the contracta- rian account of the principle of nonintervention, and it is argued that the con- tractarian approach fails to provide a justification of that principle. THE PICTURE THEORY AND THE DUCK-RABBIT Arnold Wilson Alan Donagan has claimed that Wittgenstein's picture theory of meaning in 466</page><page sequence="21">ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS the Tractatus is shown to be wanting because ambiguous pictures like the duck-rabbit are isomorphic with two different states of affairs. This is a com- pelling claim which would lay to rest certain questions about "Teil II" of the Investigations by fitting them into the popular notion that the Investigations is a critique of the Tractatus. But in the Tractatus Wittgenstein explained why we see the figure of a schematic cube "and all similar phenomena" in two different ways, "for we really see two different facts." It would appear then that Wittgenstein sought to explain by means of the picture theory the very phenomena that Donagan says shows the theory to be wanting. I show just what significance the relevant passages of the Investigations, rescued from misinterpretation by Hester, Aldrich, and Strawson, have for the picture theory: Not much. OPEN QUESTIONS, SPEECH ACTS, ANALYTICITY David Zimmerman A major complaint of non-cognitivists is that propositional accounts of moral judgment fail to accommodate non-assertive speech act potential. In this paper I attempt to lay this pivotal argument to rest. It follows from cognitivist theories that replacement of synonyms for synonyms in moral sentences yields tautologies. The non-cognitivist strategy is to argue that moral sentences have properties no tautology has. (The argument is thus a variation on the "open question" themel). I consider three versions of the argument. The first turns on the claim that tautologies are "performatively impotent." There are straightforward counter-examples to this claim. The second and third versions turn on various assumptions about "indirect speech acts": I show that they are either false or, if true, do not yield non-cogniti- vist conclusions. I end with some speculations about the form a cognitivist explanation of non- assertive speech act potential would take. DIALECTICAL LAWS AND ELEMENTARY CATASTROPHES Martin Zwick In the newly developed Catastrophe Theory of Rene Thom and E. C. Zeeman, it is possible to find a mathematical interpretation of certain aspects of Hegelian and Marxist dialectics. Specifically, the three "classical" dialectical principles, 467</page><page sequence="22">468 APA PROCEEDINGS (1) the transformation of quantity into quality, (2) the mutual interpenetra- tion (or - the unity and struggle) of opposites, and (3) the negation of the negation, can be modeled using the seven "elementary catastrophes" given by Thom, especially the catastrophe known as the "cusp." Far from being an empty metaphysics or scholasticism, as many critics have argued, these principles embody genuine insights into a class of phenomena, insights which can be given a precise algebraic and geometric representation.</page></plain_text>
