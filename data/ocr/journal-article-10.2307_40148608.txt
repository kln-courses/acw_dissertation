<plain_text><page sequence="1">Joao Cabral de Melo Neto and Modernity By AGUINALDO JOSE GONQALVES To write about the poetry of Joao Cabral de Melo Neto means to write about modernity. In 1991 the poet completed fifty years of poetry. Since the beginning of his artistic itinerary his work has been acknowledged as one of the pecu- liar faces of modernity. This Brazilian poet began his lyric work in 1941 with the composition of Pedra do Sono (Stone of Sleep), a work that serves as symbol of an initial act of poetry's procedures, a work that would become one of the most influential in the history of modern verse. It is necessary to understand several factors that interpose themselves in his style of producing art in order to understand, in a sense, the determination of Joao Cabral. These factors act in the complex whole of his poems, and they occur in a coherent manner - that is, in an infallible form of persistence. The nature of Cabral's influences is one of the more important aspects to determine the struc- ture of his poetry. These influences embrace several systems of art that conflate in the space of verbal language. The result of this process is an instigating form of poetry in the expression of words, and this expression intensifies the production of meanings. The poem leads the reader to face a difficult and fascinating universe of words. What can be realized as an effect of this kind of procedure articulated by Cabral is an "expansion of the significant." The limits of the verbal sign are amplified. The poet seems to imitate the verbal code itself. This kind of exercise with the code implies his own process of creation, which is rigorously realized by the poet, who never withdraws from certain prin- ciples. Among these, I can mention the ones cited by the poet himself, in 1954, during his lecture at the International Congress of Writers in Sao Paulo: "This enrichment of modern poetry is revealed main- ly in the following aspects: a) in the structure of the verse (new rhythmic forms, syntactic rhythm, new forms of suppression and "enjambment"); b) in the structure of the image (collision of words, approxima- tion of strange realities, process of association, and imagery from the subconscious); c) in the structure of the words (exploration of musical, visual, and, in general, sensory values of the words; fusion or disin- tegration of the words; restoration or invention of words, invention of onomatopoeia); d) in the nota- tion of the phrase (material distinction of words, violent inversions, subversion of the punctuation sys- tem); and e) in the typographical disposition (calli- graphic signs, use of blanks, variation of typographi- cal characters, symmetrical disposition of the semantic and phonetic basis)."1 These aspects, integrated into others present in Cabral's poetry, result in an original form of language that subverts the verbal code but, at the same time, exalts it and thus amplifies its universe of significa- tion. In most of his poetic production he constructs dynamic systems through signs. The signs are articu- lated in such a manner that they create a "dangerous" space. I say dangerous because the words impose themselves as an obstruction to the reader who in- tends to read the poetic message fluently. In this regard, reading Cabral's poetry means to enter into an unstable exercise of pleasure. However, the word pleasure, in this context, is being used in the sense explained by Paul Valery in his essay on esthetics. Mais il y a plaisir et plaisir. Tout plaisir ne se laisse pas si facilement reconduire a une place bien determinee dans un bon order des choses. II en est qui ne servent a rien dans Peconomie de la vie et ne peuvent, d'autre part, etre regardes comme de simples aberrations d'une faculte de se sentir necessaire a Petre vivant. Ni Putilite ni Tabus ne les expliquent. Ce n'est pas tout. Cette sorte de plaisir est indivisible de developpements qui excedent le domaine de la sensibilite, et la rattachent tou jours a la production de modifications affectives, de celles qui se prolongent et s'enrichissent dans les voies de l'intellect, et qui condui- sent parfois a Penterprise d'actions exterieures sur la matiere, sur les sens et sur l'esprit d'autrui, exigeant l'exercice combine de toutes les puissances humaines.2 If in my earlier remarks I said that Cabral imitates the verbal code, it is important to say now that he constructs his poetry as a mimesis of communicative language, of prose language, imposing on his construc- tion a "new poetic diction," the effects of which allow the critics to call it "the language of stone" - that is, a language based in concrete words and impersonality, having as a starting point a kind of refusal of "inspira- tion" or of an emotional attitude toward creation. Cabral belongs to the third and last generation of poets linked to Brazilian Modernism, the so-called Generation of '45. Brazilian Modernism was an es- thetic movement embracing literature and other arts which began in Sao Paulo in 1922. Among the artists who participated in this important movement during its first generation, two distinguished themselves as leaders of the era's ideas and literary production: Oswald de Andrade and Mario de Andrade. The year 1930 is considered the beginning of the second gene- ration of Brazilian Modernism. Its main literary foundations were the development of a "poetry of the quotidian" by the great poet Manuel Bandeira, the</page><page sequence="2">640 WORLD LITERATURE TODAY initial poetic work of Carlos Drummond de Andrade, and, in the novel, the development of regional themes through such writers as Graciliano Ramos, Jorge Amado, and Jose Lins do Rego. Finally, the Genera- tion of '45 made it known to Brazilian readers through a group of poets that it intended to criticize the esthetic innovations proposed by the 1922 group. Although Joao Cabral launched his literary career in 1941, one cannot say that his work presents influ- ences of his generation. He followed a singular path, carrying out his determined formal search. Due to his profession as diplomat, the poet lived for many years in European and South American countries. From among these he chose Spain as the country in which he transformed matters of life into matters of poetry. Thus the presence of Spain in Cabral's verse is evident, either in the themes or in the rhythmic structure of several poems. It seems that he found a harmonious dialogue between the region of Andalusia in southern Spain and the region of Pernambuco in northeastern Brazil, where he was born in 1920. There are moments in his poetic itiner- ary when the poet interweaves this dialogue between the two cultures into one unique poetic diction. When the focus is on Spain, we have several composi- tional motifs, ranging from Spanish dancers to brave bullfighters. Since the publication oiPedra do Sono&gt; Joao Cabral has brought out more than twenty collections of verse.3 Their point of convergence is a kind of ten- sion between the reference to the world and the poetic nature of language. We can say that a tension occurs between the emotive function and the poetic function of language, as delineated by Roman Jakob- son.4 This symptom manifest in his poetry denounces abstract esthetic principles. Cabral adheres to certain concepts articulated by Paul Valery in the essay "Poesie et pensee abstraite."5 According to the French writer, the revelation of poetry must occur through a language that always represents a kind of recommencement. There is a necessity of starting over, or of a reconsideration imposed by a conscious- ness of language that makes possible the action of a work of art in the conditioned values of the reader. There is an illusory character of the traditional image of the lyric genre that does not correspond to the real necessities of man. Then it is necessary to single out the word in order to single out the things. For Valery, it is this poetic procedure that marks the differences between communicative language and expressive language. Cabral's poetry "constructs itself" as a resistant house in which the polysemic and singular universe of meaning lives - that is, his poetry is constantly singling out the referents of the world. These refer- ents can be divided into four large groups of subjects selected by this modern poet: as I have noted, one of these consists of the themes and motifs extracted from Brazil's Northeast, among the poorest regions of the country; the poet's native Pernambuco is located in that region. The second group of themes or poetic motifs derives from Spain. There are two other rich poetic forces present in Joao Cabral's verse: man in the universal sense of the word, with his existential contradictions; and the several systems of art, including dance, architecture, sculpture, poetry, and painting. "The sign of art"6 acts as a motif in Cabral's work, but it also functions as a form of direct allusion or homage paid by the poet to other artists. This aspect of his poetry accen- tuates the modernity of his style, as illustrated by one of his books, Museu de Tudo (Museum of Everything; 1977), a collection that shows the metaphorical regis- ter of his procedure. In a highly intentional and selective process, the celebrated artists represent in their respective styles the esthetic choices of the poet himself. In another of his books, Serial, written between 1959 and 1961, Cabral creates one of the most repre- sentative poems in the sense just discussed. It is the poem "O Sim contra o Sim" (Yes Against Yes), wherein poets and paintings are brought together in the same space of poetry. Cabral dedicates four stan- zas of the poem to each of the artists celebrated: Marianne Moore, Francis Ponge, Joan Miro, Piet Mondrian, the Portuguese poet Cesario Verde, the early-twentieth-century Brazilian poet Augusto dos Anjos, Juan Gris, and, finally, Jean Dubuffet. To each of them Cabral accords verses that converge with his or her technique, showing the procedures of several artists while revealing his own procedures as well. This is only one interesting example from the whole of his work, however. There are a great many other poems wherein this mechanism of composition oc- curs. Among the artists present in Cabral's poetry, I am going to select three to show part of the convergence that constitutes this Brazilian poet's structural system of thought. I refer to the architect Le Corbusier, the painter Piet Mondrian, and the Catalan painter Joan Miro. This choice represents one possible constella- tion. The dimension of Cabral's poetry cannot be reduced to a small group of influences, and my focus is not necessarily on influences but on convergences between his poetry and the systems of other artists. Despite the fact that his work presents the word as its means of expression, it accomplishes its task within an esthetic conception that allows its conjugation with other artistic manifestations. One has, for in- stance, the impression that Educagdo pela Pedra (Edu- cation by Stone), one of Cabral's most representative works, succeeded in revealing through its poetic sys- tem, mutatis mutandis, the process that Le Corbusier (1887-1965) accomplished in architecture during its revolutionary period. I say this because of the "func- tional dynamism" that constitutes the system of the book.</page><page sequence="3">GONgALVES 641 As one knows, "functional dynamism" is one of the most considerable aspects of the architectural style of Le Corbusier. The forty-eight poems that constitute the book are, at the same time, autonomous and dependent on one another. They show macrostruc- tural and microstructural procedures which suggest the "mass production" conducted by Le Corbusier within the exalted "rationality of the architectural forms." The poet himself has said in an interview that when he was eighteen years old, he read all the books by Le Corbusier that had been published by that date. He continued: "I confess that no philoso- pher, no esthete, no critic, no literature theoretician, has influenced my ideas about art as has Le Cor- busier."7 If "Solitude, recif, etoile" was the epigraph of his first book, Pedra do Sono, invoking Mallarme, then "Machine a emouvoir . . . ," an expression from the great French architect, was the motto of O En- genheiro (The Engineer), concluded in 1945. Cabral explains: "Once, in his good times, Le Corbusier defined the house as a 'machine of living.' On another occasion I read an article he had written - I cannot locate it, but it was in an art magazine - that a picture was a 'machine a emouvoir . . . ,' that is, a machine that moves, that causes emotion. That was my idea of poetry then, a 'machine to cause emotion.' " In Edu- cagdo pela Pedra there is a poem, "Fabula de um Arquiteto" (An Architect's Fable), which illustrates well the observations made in this essay about the correspondences between the ideas of the Brazilian poet and the French architect. The poetic work of Joao Cabral succeeded several esthetic movements in twentieth-century modern art, and the poet possessed considerable practical knowl- edge for extracting their fundamental "ingredients" in order to formulate his own artistic experiences. More than from surrealism, the poet selected ele- ments from cubism, with its figurative fragmentation, and - what is particularly interesting - he also con- fronted formalist rationalism, which was decisive, for example, to the development of Dutch neoplasticism. Cabral's "eye method," together with his rationalism and his continuing search for strictness in his own creative process, conjugated the neoplastic syncretism of Piet Mondrian. Besides the four stanzas dedicated to the painter in the aforementioned poem "O Sim contra o Sim," Cabral also wrote "No Centenario de Mondrian" (On Mondrian's Centennial), a long poem, divided into two parts (called "1 or 2" and "2 or 1"), wherein the images express metaphorically the core of Mondrian's visual procedures and the uni- verse of meanings engendered by his painting. The main point of convergence between the two artists, however, lies in the manner through which each succeeds in purifying his "medium" of expres- sion, the verbal sign in the case of the poet and the iconic sign in that of the painter. Whereas Mondrian showed a progressive evolution toward distancing his painting from all analogical reference through the continual exercise of synthesis, Joao Cabral, without abandoning the elocution of verse, also preserves this process of synthesis through a technique of "peeling" back the word and working with certain structural elements. Both men, undoubtedly, rejected improvi- sation as a form of producing art. In Educagdo pela Pedra, to my mind his most important poetic work, Cabral does not negate traditional forms of verse but rather takes them as a starting point to search for the new. Thus, when the reader has his first contact with the poems in the book, he seems to see a conservative form of verse that does not offer a conservative manner of reading it. Each poem presents two stanzas in a visual arrangement that tends toward a qua- drangular and rectangular construct. There are four forms of basic geometric measures arranged in eight ways, as if they were duplicated mountings. This symmetry, based on the use of the square, or groups of squares and rectangles, has frequently appeared in modern art, as has the circle. Mondrian is one of the outstanding utilizers of these geometric forms in the plastic arts. In addition to the geometric regularity that is the most notorious visual aspect in A Educagdo pela Pe- dra, Joao Cabral employs other stylistic resources in that volume and in other verse collections that link his art to the work of other twentieth-century paint- ers. It seems that the poet "has introduced other wise hands inside his hands." Then too, within the rig- orous confines of the square, the mind's improvisa- tions will be passed through the "poet's machine." The resulting product (the poem itself) shows through its internal dynamism, which is always inter- connected in a major system that must be amplified by the construction of a new poem. So, one may conclude that what happens in this sort of poetry is a kind of dynamic syncretism obtained through or in the word reconstructed in the process of creation. In the exercise of iconicity in the poetic discourse, Cabral reached what what could be called the efficacy of language - that is, the maximum potential of language, in which the plane of expression and the plane of contents are so intermixed that they act together to produce signification. In techniques which differentiate themselves from those established through Le Corbusier and Mon- drian, Joao Cabral's poetic system establishes strong connections between his work and the plastic art of Joan Miro. The possibility of approximating the Cat- alan painter's pictorial structure to the Brazilian writ- er's poetic structure has been evident to me since 1975, when I began examining Miro's visual proce- dures and seeing clear correspondences between them and the literary procedures of the Brazilian poet. The main starting point was the recomposition process, or coupled compositions, in fourteen poems of A Edu- cagdo pela Pedra. Viewing some of Miro's engravings, one can see that he had employed a similar composi-</page><page sequence="4">642 WORLD LITERATURE TODAY tional process, with the (macro)structure being ba- sically maintained while figurative elements were added and altered, completely transforming the unity of the composition. Evidently, these deep meta- morphoses are not always understood by the viewer, who tends to see the same structure. In Cabral's poetic work this compositional technique manifests itself in more overt intertextual relations, whereas the coupled compositions show several kinds of subtle nuances in the project of transformation that creates a dialectical result: the diversity is in the apparent identity between the poems. Both artists incorporate this procedure even in the titles of their works. In Miro, for example, we find the repeated use of the same words, as in Femme et oiseau dans la nuit, Oiseau emprisonne par un person- nage, Personnage et oiseau aux ailes deploy ees; and, in the most intensive case of coupled compositions, he even gives the same title to different works: Person- nage et oiseaux (recto), Personnage et oiseaux (verso), Personnage et oiseau* These paintings are not varia- tions on the same theme but rather are completely individualized artistic expressions. All of them pre- sent elementary images whose primary relations of meaning are linked to the title, but beyond that they amplify those relations to a level of abstract complex- ity. In 1950 Joao Cabral published a book-length essay on Miro in which, besides wisely interpreting the Catalan painter's work, he explained his own concep- tion of poetry. The essay was written before Miro's "anthropomorphic cycle" and corresponds to the pe- riod when the poet concluded his collection O Cdo sent Plumas (The Dog Without Feathers; 1950), one of the most decisive moments of his poetic trajectory. In that essay, on a conceptual level, he already seemed to perceive what both he and his subject had accom- plished, and that this would lead to higher achieve- ments in their respective artistic endeavors. (I say both because, in considering Miro's art, Cabral is also thinking of his own.) In Miro's production the 1960s would see the "cosmic cycle" and the "anthro- pomorphic cycle" augmented by a series called Poesies, and Cabral would produce A Educagdo pela Pedra (1965), whose poems, referring to one another, are composed in quadrangular form and impose a circular way of reading. The compositions approach each other in their common points and similar struc- tures, as well as in their thematic and stylistic charac- teristics. The coupled poems occur inside this dy- namic universe, and certainly it is through this prism that one could consider the similarity in procedure between Cabral's poetry and Miro's painting. There are fourteen poems, composed as though in front of a series of mirrors, which imposes certain changes in them. Some of the poems show only a slight alter- ation in wording or in the order of the verses. Some- times they show a permutation of verses or of a group of lines or whole stanzas. As one could see in Miro's case, the titles are almost the same, sometimes revers- ing the word order: "O Mar e o Canavial" / "O Canavial e o Mar"; "A Urbanizagao do Regago" / "O Rega?o Urbanizado"; "Uma Mineira em Brasilia" / "Mesma Mineira em Brasilia"; "The Country of the Houyhnhnms" / "The Country of the Houyhnhnms (Another Composition)." The modernity of Joao Cabral's poetic work has a right to an identification with the process that began in the second half of the nineteenth century and propagated itself into the twentieth. As the result of an effective inspection of its own nature, each artistic system began examining, in a progressive manner, its specific medium of expression as a determined foun- dation that shaped the product of its creation. This phenomenon reminds us of the Socratic phrase "Know thyself!," which translated into the decisive step whereby each system of modern art sought to find its own autonomy. Paradoxically, each artistic system happened to cohabit with the surrounding systems, trying to understand the specific procedures of their own medium and to understand the expres- sive potential of their own artistic system through the amplification of the limits of their medium of expres- sion. Joao Cabral's poetic work is an effective exam- ple of this semiotic phenomenon. One of his books, Poesia Critica (Critical Poetry), published in 1982, amply justifies this idea. It consists of a selection of poems organized by the poet himself and divided into two parts, "Language" and "Languages." In the first part Cabral gathered poems of his which discuss the process of poetic creation or in which the exercise of metalanguage is present. In part 2 he assembled poems in which he discusses the act of creating in general. Aware that he does not belong to the spiritu- al family of artists to whom creation is a gift, the poet justifies, in his "Author's Note," his permanent atti- tude of asking and discussing with himself the valid- ity of poetic creation. For him, this validity does not wane into poetic language as an intransitive form of language, "a self-burning bonfire." Rather, poetry remains a transitive form of language, since it pre- serves its quality of poetic language. In his considerations the poet also says that, if the poem can express anything, its critical nature be- comes more valid, making it possible for the poem to have as its subject the creation process itself. If art deals with objects and beings of nature, then why, the poet asks, would it not deal with objects that one could consider as coming directly from nature? These "objects" are the works of art that act as raw material for his poetic work. It is this degree of acute consciousness in Joao Cabral that puts him on the same plane with the major Western poets of the modern era. I say this bearing in mind such names as Mallarme, Valery, T. S. Eliot, Pound, Ungaretti, William Carlos Wil- liams, Borges, Paz, Cummings, and the Brazilian</page><page sequence="5">GONgALVES 643 poets Murilo Mendes, Manuel Bandeira, Carlos Drummond de Andrade, and Augusto de Campos. I would like to elect two from among the many poets who represent modernity in the Americas, one from Spanish America and the other from North America, to form with Cabral (Portuguese America) a poetic symphony as I conclude this essay: Octavio Paz and William Carlos Williams. In their different ways these three poets evince a polyphonic harmony in the modernity of the Americas. In the case of the author of Imaginations there are several points that approximate CabraPs poetic work. Cabral and Williams "reproduce" things through concrete words and in a concrete manner. One could say that Cabral was influenced by Williams's produc- tion by virtue of its anteriority. Among his few translations there are but two poems from English: "Lilacs" by Amy Lowell and "Flowers by the Sea," a short poem by Williams that, among others, reminds us of the esthetic procedures of Joao Cabral. So, alongside Marianne Moore, Francis Ponge, and other literary constructivists who influenced the Brazilian poet, it is necessary to recognize the place occupied by Williams. Paz possesses a very different style of making poetry as well as a continuing preoccupation with the process of creation itself. From his earliest essays and verse he has shown a clear knowledge of the relation between tradition and renovation, that dialectical point of tension which, with its two arms, embraces its own body. Thus, the modernist triangle repre- sented by the work of Paz, Williams, and Cabral is formed by the following three lines: a) poetry must be able to express not ideas but things (Williams); b) in modern poetry the signs are in rotation, searching for one signification (Paz); and c) poetry must be only another language, since it preserves its poetic nature (Cabral).
