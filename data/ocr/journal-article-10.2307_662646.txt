<plain_text><page sequence="1">A STUDY OF MAYA MOULDMADE FIGURINES By MARY BUTLER INTRODUCTION' IN spite of the relatively unknown and unexcavated state of most of the Maya area, there are in museums a sufficient number of Maya figurines to warrant an attempt to classify them. The scarcity of specimens, espe- cially whole ones, and the uncertainty, in many cases, as to their proveni- ence, introduces a subjective element into classification and conclusions that is unfortunate, but so far unavoidable. The careful work that is being carried on at present in the Maya field will undoubtedly correct or check the tentative results offered here. Maya figurines are one phase, distinct by reason of style, of the figurine complex that stretches from southern Arizona into South America. Al- though it is not possible to draw a hard and fast line between mouldmade and modelled figurines, it is possible to divide them into those conforming to moulded technique, some of which may have been done entirely by hand, and those conforming to modelled or "Archaic" technique, some of which may have been cast in a mould. It is with the former class that this paper proposes to deal, confining the discussion to an examination of human figurines in the Maya area that conform to mouldmade technique. It would not be advisable however to discuss one class of Maya clay figures without considering briefly the whole group. The mouldmade fig- urines form the bulk, such as it is, and the most varied part of the material. They range in time from the Old Empire through the Puk-Labna period, 1 I wish to express my gratitude to the American Museum of Natural History and the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation, of New York City, the Museo Nacional de Arqueologia, Ethnologia y Historia, of Mexico, the Museum of Merida, Yucatan, the Peabody Museum of American Archaeology and Ethnology, Cambridge, Mass., the Univer- sity Museum of Philadelphia, and Don Rafael Regil of Merida for the use of unpublished material; to Dr A.

"Archaic" figurines, presumably earlier than mouldmade ones, occur sporadically in the Maya area, and are only twice (at Uaxactun, Guatemala, and Cerro Zapote, Salvador) connected definitely in horizontally stratified deposits with the early strata. Degenerate types of figurines, modelled by hand, occur in Yucatan and late in British Honduras. Large modelled figures attached to braseros are characteristic of the late phases of Maya culture in the northwest and on the east coast of Yucatan, and are found also in Tabasco and in the Highlands. They doubtless represent the god or guardian spirit to whom one was offering incense. The modern Lacandon Indians of the Peten make a degenerate form of figure brasero, consisting of a bowl with crudely modelled human head on the rim (Tozzer, 1907). MODELLED FIGURINES: EARLY The terms "early" and "late" are assigned merely to permit a distinc- tion between the bulk of the modelled figurines, referred to as "Archaic," and those which are apparent degenerations of finer technique. Although there may have been no single Archaic culture, spreading agri- culture, pottery, and crude hand-made figurines from Mexico to Peru, there were undoubtedly early cultures responsible for such figurines found in various localitieg. These figurines possess features in common, but they are the features that would characterize the work of any people trying a new art. The crudely made bodies, with little or no clothing, and heads that seem even cruder since eyes and mouth are shown by slits or holes punched in applied pellets, justify the label "Archaic." In contrast to the mould- made figurines, "Archaic" ones seldom have the added function of whistle. They are usually small clay figures, pure and simple, and may have had a more directly religious meaning than their more sophisticated successors. Although, in the Maya area, "Archaic" figurines have been found in Vera Cruz (AM), at Uaxactun in the Peten (Ricketson, 1929), through- out the Highlands of Guatemala (Lothrop, 1926; Gamio, 1926-27; UM), in the Uloa Valley (PM, MAI), and in Salvador (Lothrop, 1927; Spinden, 1915), only at Uaxactun, Miraflores in Guatemala, and Cerro Zapote in Salvador do they appear in horizontally stratified deposits. At Uaxactun they occur in the earliest level. At Miraflores, Dr Gamio found the ma- terial to be Archaic in the lower levels, Archaic mixed with Historic Maya in the top level. At Cerro Zapote where Archaic figurines occur, in varying forms, above and below a layer of ash, Lothrop places them at the beginning of a tenta- tive Archaic, Chorotega, Maya, Pipil series. Little can be said at present</page><page sequence="3">638 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 37, 1935 about the "Archaic" figurines from Vera Cruz or the Highlands. Mention should, however, be made of the resemblance of some of the Huastec figurines to those from the Uloa Valley. The "Archaic" figurines from the Uloa Valley form an individual and interesting group. They are unusual in the sophistication and high degree of artistic skill shown, making the mouldmade figurines from the same place seem crude by comparison. The bodies are those of nude women seated, usually, with legs crossed; sometimes with one hand to the face, some- times pregnant, sometimes holding a child. The heads, which far out- number the bodies, are conventionally treated, with holes in the center of shallow grooves for eyes, and slits for mouths. They show, however, an occasional feeling for portraiture, and a wide range of hairdressing. The hair appears to be so shaven as to provide a variety of designs that may in- dicate the status of the wearers. The possibility of these figurines showing not people with ornamentally shaven heads, but people wearing wigs that give such an appearance, is suggested by a line that invariably runs across the forehead, showing apparently the edge of a tight-fitting cap in slightly higher relief than the face. The heads are so meticulously rendered that such a constant element cannot be ignored, and the idea that some of the Maya, like the ancient Egyptians, may have shaved their heads and worn wigs, is strengthened by finding, in both the Usumacinta region and British Honduras, headdresses which seem to start above the natural hairline. Stelae 8-11 from Seibal show a very artificial arrangement of straight hair, and on a stela from Calakmul a head covered with tightly coiled curls gives the idea further support. What data we have imply that the "Archaic" situation is essentially the same in the Maya area as in Mexico, and that the makers of such modelled figurines preceded the more sophisticated workers who made their figurines in moulds. Different techniques seem to have prevailed in different sections, but these may be found to represent different phases of a more or less homogeneous culture, as in the Valley of Mexico. In the regions pe- ripheral to the main Maya area, such as the Uloa Valley and Vera Cruz, we have no sure time element involved. There are also modelled figurines from the Highlands, archaistic rather than archaic, that show definite links between different districts and probably were contemporary with the mouldmade figurines of the Old Empire (UM). MODELLED FIGURINES: LATE Finally there are the crude modelled, sun-baked figurines from British Honduras which follow the mouldmade ones and are the last flickers of</page><page sequence="4">BUTLER] MAYA MOULDMADE FIGURINES 639 figurine-making on the eastern coast of Yucatan (Gann, 1918, pp. 60-61; pls. 8-9, 22). They consist of male figures, each wearing a loincloth, button labrets at the corners of the mouth, and a headdress which may be either a flat cap or a mitre-like cap with a long queue behind reminiscent of a type of headdress found on the stelae at Palenque and Copan. These men are standing, holding either a fan or a knife; seated, practicing self-mutilation; or crouching, with shield and spear. BRASERO FIGURES Large modelled figures of coarse clay, averaging forty centimetres in height and attached to braseros, occur in Yucatan, Tabasco, and the High- lands of Guatemala. From their association with late remains on the east coast of Yucatan, and their non-appearance at Old Empire sites, such braseros are considered to be of relatively late date. The brasero figures considered here fall into three groups, which conform to the differences in provenience. Some sherds from Piedras Negras, apparently pieces of other types of figure brasero, are too fragmentary to do more than suggest that this kind of vessel goes back to the Old Empire. On Tabascan censers a male human figure is seated on top of the lid (PM). Two types are shown; one showing a face more or less realistically modelled, with disk earplugs, and the head usually set in bird or animal jaws. The other has eyes made by an incised pi sign, a horizontally oblong pendant hanging from the septum of the nose, often round ball earplugs instead of the usual disk ones, and a headdress which fits in a square around the face and is more or less tubular above it. The latter type recalls in feeling, though there are no actual identities, large figures from Teotitlan del Camino (Danzel, pp. 61-62; cf. also Dieseldorff, 1926, fig. 178). Some of the brasero figures of this type in the Museo Nacional of Mexico come from Tabasco, others from the Totonac area in Vera Cruz. Both types of men wear a costume of which the main characteristic is a jacket held to- gether in front by a round or oblong brooch with two applied pellets on it. They carry shield and spear or atlatl. The main portion of the headdress is a sort of chimney acting as vent for the incense smoke. On the front of this is usually a bird flying down; behind the chimney is a semi-circular crest. On the crest is applied a series of hands, with two round pellets ap- plied to the back of each. The East Coast censer consist of a lidless jar with a standing man at- tached to the side (PM; Gann, 1918, pp. 119-20; pl. 20). The style is real- istic, well-modelled; the types shown are two: an old man with head thrust forward, two snag teeth, and sunken cheeks, and a young man with a com-</page><page sequence="5">640 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 37, 1935 plete upper set of teeth and an unlined face. The costume consists of disk earplugs, often with a tassel, a round collar with scallops projecting at in- tervals (cf. Piedras Negras, Stela 35, Lintel 2; Maler, 1901, pls, 28, 31), a braided oblong pectoral, fringed leggings, and a tall headdress with corn or braided symbols. We have the young man also in the diving position characteristic of the East Coast culture, with a plate of copal balls between his hands. In the Highlands there are a few examples of a third kind of censer, consisting of a seated figure holding in his arms a straight-sided bowl for incense (MAI;UM). In this region we also find the most varied development of censers in which the human body is subordinated to the vessel. Hourglass censers often bear on one side a human head, with its body telescoped into down- hanging arms and legs (UM). In another type a face with cruller twist over the nose, possibly the Sun God, forms one side of the jars and the low, straight-sided bowls (UM, PM, MAI). A conventionalized head and out- curving arms mask a cylindrical jar on cylindrical tripod feet (MAI). In even such a brief view of the fragmentary brasero material, we see that there are various distinctive treatments which at present seem to be localized in different parts of the Maya area. What evidence there is sug- gests a comparatively late date for the material discussed under this heading, MOULDMADE FIGURINES Mouldmade figurines have an average height of fifteen to twenty centi- metres, though larger and smaller ones occur. They are made of relatively well-fired clay, which varies in quality, and ranges in post-fired coloring from buff to orange. They were probably originally painted, some real- istically, some arbitrarily, but few traces of this remain today. The majority probably represent cult devotees, a few definitely portray deities. The distinction which exists between genre and cult figurines cannot be brought out in a paper of this sort, since genre figurines are usually single isolated specimens, rather than types. We can say, however, that such figurines, showing unmistakable scenes from daily life, occur in every region. We do not yet know definitely the purposes for which clay figurines were used by the early Maya. A great many of them have whistle forms, as a result of placing vents in the back and adding a mouthpiece at the lower back of the figure. This may well have developed incidentally from the technique of making figurines in a mould, and does not necessarily mean that the figurines were primarily made to be used as whistles. In the Usumacinta-Highland region figurines occur that are pierced from side to side through head or shoulders, for suspension, probably as an amulet or</page><page sequence="6">BUTLER] MAYA MOULDMADE FIGURINES 641 an offering at a shrine (PM, UM). With the exception of a broken figurine found on the lid of a cyst burial at Palenque (Holmes, 1895-97, pl. 23) and those found with skeletons in the Uloa Valley (Popenoe, p. 74) clay fig- urines so far have not appeared in burials or votive caches in the Maya area, although tiny jade and shell ones are frequent enough (J.E. Thomp- son, 1931, pl. 31; Piedras Negras Preliminary Reports, ms.). Discarded figurines were used, with potsherds, as a foundation for stucco relief decora- tion on the buildings of the Usumacinta region (Piedras Negras Preliminary Reports, ims.). What evidence we have, then, points to their use as whistles, probably in religious ceremonies (cf. Sahagun, p. 121), as amulets to be worn, or offerings to be hung. They may also have served as household gods; they do not seem to have been used in burials. Figurines that can be identified as Mayan are found in the modern Mexican states of Vera Cruz, Chiapas, Tabasco, Campeche, and Yucatan, as well as in British Honduras, Guatemala, Honduras, and Salvador. If we attempt to date mouldmade figurines approximately, on the basis of their occurrence in archaeological excavations, their earliest known ap- pearance would seem to be at Piedras Negras, an Old Empire city in the Usumacinta Valley, where dated monuments range from 514 A.D. to 830 A.D. according to the Goodman-Thompson correlation, 260 years earlier by the Spinden correlation. Their latest appearance is at Labna, a Yuca- tecan city belonging architecturally to the Puk-Labna period, approxi- mately the beginning of the second millenium A.D. The fact that, though frequent in the Puk, such figurines have not been found at later sites in Yucatan suggests that the use of small clay figures may have been to some extent replaced by the use of stone or wooden ones (cf. Landa, pp. 128, 158). In attempting a classification of these clay figurines, style is taken as the primary criterion, with type of person shown, the subject matter, as secondary criterion. There is a.certain amount of localization in each, but style seems to be the surer historical determinant. A factor which must be mentioned before discussing the material is that of headform. There are three distinct headforms shown in the figurines be- longing to a style which we shall refer to as X and in the major art forms of painting and carving. Style X is a realistic, finely executed rendering in the round of the human body that is in distinct contrast to the convention- alizations of surrounding styles. Headform designations are applied tenta- tively to figurines of other styles, allowing for the possible influence of con- ventionalization. These headforms will be referred to in the text as A, B, and C. Headform A (fig. 1, a) has an oval face, narrowing from the jaw to the flattened forehead, which slopes back from the eyebrows at an acute angle.</page><page sequence="7">CLL ?C~- 8 C b a d ,i ; 9 \\ ~\m O 0, i ~i~i LL~ kd~ 5 IIa ;I\I \\\ i iiiii' ~ c9ul~u~a~c ~ /1 I u \%ill? ~kv~ed lli? $ ~L \\\ FIG. 1. a, X, headform A, Piedras Negras, UM, Cat.

The chin is rounded and slopes back from the lower lip, and the projecting mouth is half open. There are two groups of figurines with Form A heads that are short and rounded. One comprises a few simply dressed people without headdresses, in Style X from the Highlands (Dieseldorff, 1926, fig. 24; Seler, 1904, figs. 18: c,f, 19: b) and in the Ta- bascan style (Spinden, 1913, pl. 17: 4). The other consist of Style X heads from Labna, which have low, close-fitting headdresses (PM). Headform A is that commonly referred to as the Maya type or Palenque type, and corresponds to Joyce's "classical" category (Joyce, 1933, p. xvi). It is predominant in stone carvings and in codices, as well as in figurines, from Guatemala to Yucatan. Headform B (fig. 1, b) has a square, chubby face with spreading, flattish nose, below a normal or a bulging forehead. The head is usually short and rounded. It corresponds to that classified by Joyce as "chubby" (Joyce, 1933, p. xvi). Only in the Usumacinta region do we find it prolonged into a rounded cone sloping back above the prominent forehead. This conical shape may be due to a headdress similar to one characteristic of Form A heads. Form B is infrequent, associated at present chiefly with two more or less widely distributed figurine types, both showing stout elderly men. It occurs, as well, in Copan sculptures, and is essentially the type recog- nized in recent publications by Vaillant and tentatively assigned by him to the Olmecs. The face of headform C (fig. 1, c) is roughly square, widest at the cheek- bones, and sweeping down in a full curve to a pronounced, almost prog- nathous chin. The head is short and rounded, the face broad and flat, and the forehead perhaps artificially depressed. Form C is rare in figurines of the realistic style, occurring usually on single specimens not mentioned here, but its occurrence may be significant. A figurine with such a head from the Highlands is similar to one from Piedras Negras; one stela, 35 (Maler, 1901, pl. 28), among all the carvings of people with A heads at Piedras Negras, shows a person with a Form C head. Our knowledge of the Maya is still too fragmentary to allow of sure conclusions as to the significance of this variation in headform, but it is a factor that cannot be ignored in considering Maya figurines. Whether a figurine head has the form A, B, or C will be shown by the corresponding initial in the heading under which it occurs. These figurines, then, will be considered by styles, discussing under each the main types, with mention of individual specimens that may be of in-</page><page sequence="9">644 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 37, 1935 terest in their relation to other forms of art. Taking this approach, we find two general styles occuring throughout the Maya area, not confined to any one district. One of these, called here Style X, is that most characteristic of and most common in Maya mouldmade figurines. The other, referred to as Style Y, occurs sporadically. In contrast to these are styles that are ap- parently local in character: one belonging to the Highlands, three others, from Campeche, Tabasco, and Vera Cruz to the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, and another, from the Uloa Valley to the Caribbean coast. GENERAL STYLES: STYLE X Figurines in this realistic style, already described on page 641, show a highly developed artistic sense and technique, and are the finest from pre- Columbian America. This style shows the same approach to and treatment of the subject as are shown in the bas-reliefs and painting of the Old Empire. It is characteristic of figurines from the middle Usumacinta drainage, of the handful of mouldmade figurines from the Peten, and of most of those from the Highlands. It reaches as far as Copan, and Lubaantun in British Honduras; it is prominent in Tabasco, and persists along the west coast of Yucatan into the Peninsula itself where it characterizes the heads found at Labna in the Puk. A refinement of study that will be possible only with the accumulation of well-documented collections of figurines from the en- tire area may show local variations of treatment within this widespread style. At present, there is a certain amount of localization of types and of costume which permits some geographical distinctions to be drawn. The style persists in time from Piedras Negras to Labna. The implication is that it is most characteristic of the Maya Old Empire, and continued into the Maya period of power in Yucatan. USUMACINTA X 1. Hunchback. A (fig. 1, d). The figure of a seated hunchback shows a man wearing loincloth, neckbar, and high caplike headdress. A specimen in gray clay from Jonuta varies somewhat from those in red-orange clay from Piedras Negras. The hunchback is found figured in clay and stone from Tennessee to Costa Rica. Bernal Diaz refers to hunchbacks acting as buffoons (Diaz del Castillo, I, p. 230) and Landa mentions the popu- larity of jesters and buffoons among the Maya. One wonders whether the Maya, like ourselves, believed that a hunchback brought good luck. X 2. Woman with Adult child. A. This is a woman with a child whose face is that of a wrinkled old man (fig. 1, e). She wears a high, square- ended headdress, with an incised line like a central parting; the headdress is straight across the forehead, and falls away in steps at the sides of the</page><page sequence="10">BUTLER] MAYA MOULDMADE FIGURINES 645 face. She may be standing, wearing only a skirt, carrying a dog under her arm, and leading the smaller figure, or seated, in an undecorated, low- necked robe, with the smaller figure across her knees. Although these two persons may represent merely a mother and child, the wrinkled face of the latter suggests the religious connotation of goddess and worshipper. Thompson refers to similar figures from Lubaantun, which are as yet unpublished (Joyce, Clark, and Thompson, p. 310). A woman with a smaller figure at her knee occurs also in two poses in the characteristic style of Campeche; in the Highlands of Guatemala, and in the Uloa Valley; among the Chiriqui, in Nicaragua and Venezuela to the south; in the "Archaic" of Vera Cruz and the Huastec, and among the Aztecs to the north. The only specimens, however, that suggest goddess and worshipper are those in the Maya Usumacinta area. This may be because they are the only ones executed in a style realistic enough to show the adult char- acteristics of the minor figure. But it is interesting to recall the reliefs on the Palace at Palenque that show a woman holding ii her arms a child whose right leg ends in a snake's head. Spinden (1913, p. 51) calls this child a prototype of the Manikin Sceptre God, probably a form of God B-K of the codices, and the reliefs may perhaps point, from another angle, to a Mother Goddess cult in this region. X 3. Owl Man. There is a definite owl cult which seems to extend from the Usumacinta into Vera Cruz, and in the latter region shows connota- tions of the Serpent Bird, that mythical creature, found on Old Empire stelae and lintels, who is probably connected with the Plumed Serpent (Spinden, 1913, pp. 60-62). One sub-type shows a man in a complete bird costume, of which the salient feature is a Horned Owl mask headdress, X 3a (fig. 1, f). One of these figurines, from San Andres Tuxtla, has along each arm a snake head without lower jaw. The figure resembles in every- thing but headdress that shown in Figure 1, g. According to Maudslay, as quoted by Spinden (1913, p. 60), "the most essential character of the (Ser- pent Bird) design seems to be the presence of a conventional snake's head (without a lower jaw) in place of or overlying the bony structure of the bird's wing." Another sub-type shows a man wearing a bird costume, but no mask, X 3b. While the costume shown bears no especial owl attributes, it is identical with that worn by men with owl masks. It does not appear with any other bird head, although it occurs once topped by a jaguar mask (MM). It seems reasonable therefore to consider it at present as an owl costume, especially as one such man, from Vera Cruz, has a snake head along each arm (fig. 1, g) like the owl figure described above.</page><page sequence="11">646 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 37, 1935 Three standing men have, each, a nimbus of feathers surrounding the whole figure and an owl mask used as the main element in the tiered head- dress, X 3c. One of them wears a headdress in which a snake headdress is superimposed on an owl one (fig. 1, h). This points again to the Serpent Bird combination, and the costume as a whole suggests that the figurines, of unknown provenience, are Old Empire ones. Three other men have vertical flanges along their arms that can only be meant to be wings, X 3d. One (fig. 2, a) is seated wearing a headdress that seems to have developed from an owl head (see below), the others are standing. While these may represent some other form of birdman than the owl, this bird is the only one that can be identified in anthropomorphic form among these figurines. Mention should also be made of two headdresses containing bird ele- ments which seem to derive from the owl. One of these, which apparently shows a conventionalized owl beak and large filleted eyes, occurs from Palenque to Yucatan (fig. 3, c). It is very like a conventionalization of a snake head that is found on jades (PM) and on Piedras Negras stone carv- ings (Maler, 1901, pls, 20, 22). The bird head, however, can be distinguished by minor differences in the nose element, and by the three sets of feathers that project at top and sides, representing tail and wings. This headdress also occurs with abbreviations (fig. 2, a) and variations (fig. 2, b), and in the Campeche style and the Vera Cruz "Archaic," as well as Style X. The other headdress which may have the same source consists of a balloon-like turban above two filleted eyes and a beak element (Joyce, 1933, pl. 2: 9, 10, 13). It also occurs on Lintel 4 at Piedras Negras (Maler, 1901, pl. 32) and probably again in the bulbous turbans on polychrome pottery from the Highlands (Gordon, 1925, pls. 2, 8). X 4. Nude Fat Man. B. This is a fat man, usually standing, whose hands rest at the sides of his paunch. He wears only a loincloth, and usually has a large bead or plaque applied to his chest, and a turban or pointed cap on his head. One wears a bird headdress (fig. 2, b). A similar standing figure has been found in jades from the Sacred Cenote at Chichen Itza (PM), and the type has been recognized by Beyer (1930) among Toltec figurines and paintings. Standing fat men from Teotihuacan are very like the Maya ones. Their loincloths are of a different cut, and one man wears long ear ornaments of the kind that Beyer finds characteristic of his Fat God among Toltecs and Totonacs. Their head- dress consists of two filleted rings on the forehead, a vestigial beak above, and a crest flaring off to the side (Seler, 1915, p. 461, fig. 52), and seems to be a variant of the owl headdress described under X 3.

The Teotihuacan figures of stand- ing fat men are the only ones of this class that do not have a Form B face, square and chubby. Theirs are typically Toltec-a triangle with a rather bulging forehead as base. Such a face, older, fat and sagging, might assume a square outline, with bulging cheeks and forehead. One Maya headdress, more Mexican ones, suggest some connection of the Nude Fat Man with the owl cult. BRITISH HONDURAS X 5. Ball Player. A type so far unique at Lubaantun is that identified by Joyce as the ball-player (fig. 2, c). X 6. Man-in-Litter. A man is carried, apparently in a hammock slung between two poles, on plaques from British Honduras (fig. 2, d). The same thing is shown on a polychrome vase from Chama (UM). A similar graffito on a wall at Holmul shows a different type of litter (Merwin and Vaillant, p. 90). X 7. Woman-at-Metate. This is a woman, wearing a headdress typical of the district, kneeling at a metate (fig. 2, f). HIGHLANDS X 8. Dancer. A. This is a man wearing necklace, loincloth, and high mask headdress with feathers flaring at top and sides (fig. 2, g). His head- dress has snake or corn attributes, and is probably associated with fertility rites. He may be seated, with arms gracefully outstretched, or standing in a dancing posture that recalls the carved stelae of Naranjo, Cankuen, Quirigua. This dancing pose also occurs on one of the Owl Men (fig. 1, f), some of the Clothed Fat Men, X 10, a man from Jaina (Spinden, 1913, pl. 17: 11) and a figurine in the Vera Cruz style (MM). VERA CRUZ X 9. Winged Man. C. This is a type that is difficult to identify, a man, standing, with outstretched arms, shoulder wings, and a thick tubular collar or roll of fat at his neck. Several specimens show the man to be fat; two wear a definite feather costume. It is impossible to say whether there is any connection between these figures and the Clothed Fat Man, X 10. The general effect of the specimen shown in Figure 2, h, suggests an insect. GENERAL X 10. Clothed Fat Man. B, A. The chief characteristic of this type is the fat man's costume of a fitted dress with a loincloth over it (fig. 2, i).</page><page sequence="14">BUTLER] MAYA MOULDMADE FIGURINES 649 The material of the jacket and trousers is shown by parallel horizontal lines with vertical nicks between them. Although this might be a convention- alized rendering of the feather costume of the Owl Man, it might also show another use of the quilted cotton'clothing that the later Maya and Mexicans used for armor (Diaz del Castillo, I, p. 5). Headdresses are usually low caps of one form or another, although one man has fillets and feather that recall the Mexican bird headdress described under the heading X 4 (MM). Most of these men have Form B heads. They are usually standing; sometimes in a dancing pose, sometimes holding a fan, sometimes with the right hand held to the face. There are two occurrences of this type in other styles (PM); once in that characteristic of Campeche, once in the Tabascan style. The occurrence of one of these figures at Lubaantun presumably establishes the type in the Old Empire; identification of the Form A head of a specimen from Merida with several heads made from a Labna mould suggests that the figurine came from that city, and that the type persisted into the second millenium. There are, however, differences in dress or equipment that distinguish the few Yucatecan examples. A similar figure, apparently bound to a post, appears carved in stone at Desciln6, Yucatan (Follett, p. 395). X 11. Seated Woman. A. A woman seated apparently with legs crossed under her, has a high, fairly simple headdressing (fig. 3, a). She wears a necklace, a pik or long skirt, and a huipil or short-sleeved blouse, that may or may not cover the shoulders. Her left hand rests on her knee, and in her right she usually holds a fan, sometimes a dog or a child. Sometimes she is old and wrinkled, once she has a pointed dog's face. One specimen supports her raised left elbow by her right hand. Headless women from the Usumacinta district sit with hands in their laps, wearing low-necked robes whose long sleeves fall away in points from the wrists. One of these, from Piedras Negras, has a Form A head, another, from Campeche (?), has a large, bald head with wrinkled face. X 12. Cross-legged, hands on knees. A. There are quite a number of Maya figurines that show a person seated in this position. These fall into various groups. One is determined by a peculiar technical feature, X 12a. The line from neck to hand is so curved that what bend there is comes in the upper arm rather than at the shoulder. This causes the stiff arms to stand away from the body. Three women wear necklaces of large beads, and capes low off the shoulder, similar to a cape found on Zapotecan braseros (fig. 3, b). A man, wearing a loincloth that wraps high around his waist, has the same pose and arm technique.</page><page sequence="15">650 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 37, 1935 Another group, X 12b, consists of men seated in the same way, but with elbows bent.

Whistles. Many Maya figurines are whistles, with a mouthpiece inconspicuously attached to the back of the figure. There are, however, three specialized whistle forms associated with Style X. One of these is a human head with the mouthpiece set vertically in the top, X 13a. In the others, the representational element is subordinated to the functional. One, X 13b, is roughly cylindrical, bulging at either end, and with one side moulded into a human face and torso (fig. 3, f). The mouthpiece is set in the end, above the head. The other kind illustrates a type to which many of the figurine heads from the Puk probably belong, X 13c (E. H. Thomp- son, pl. 12: 18). Its ultimate source of inspiration may have been the pan- pipe, since it has two pipes of different lengths, closed at the lower end. A human head is moulded on the side below a flattened mouthpiece (fig. 3, g). There are occasional personages, and animals, usually anthropomorphic, that may represent gods. One is a tiny, finely-done Diving God, with Form A head, and arms and legs broken off (fig. 3, e). This comes from Piedras Negras, and serves to show that the concept of the descending god, as- sociated with Mexican and late Mayan cult objects, such as braseros from the east coast of Yucatan, belonged also to the Old Empire. Bizarre heads may represent the Sun God (fig. 3, d). Clothed humans with animal heads include, beside the Owl Man, X 3, dog-, jaguar-, and deer-headed persons, and a possible monkey-man. I would suggest that these show masked people representing gods in religious ceremonies, while unclothed jaguar- people, in various poses-one holding a small struggling human figure (PM)-represent the god himself. This suggestion would be supported by Stela 10 at Piedras Negras (Maler, 1901, pl. 19), where a priest or ruler is seated before a huge standing jaguar, who stretches protecting arms above him.2 The Jaguar, lord of the Maya month Pop, is important also in Mexico and Peru. Tozzer and Allen, 1910, point out the general religious impor- tance of the dog, its possible connection with Mars, and the importance of the owl. There are four single specimens, figurine groups, that should be men- tioned for their connection with stone reliefs from Piedras Negras. One of these, from Lubaantun, shows a man holding by the hair two smaller figures, one on either side of him (Joyce, 1933, pl. 5: 1). Such grouping oc- 2 While Maler (p. 56) says that the carving on the upper half of Stela 10 is destroyed completely, the author when at Piedras Negras in 1933 was able to make a drawing of the stone which shows clearly the jaguar head and outstretched arms of the large standing figure whose legs are shown by Maler's photograph of the lower half of the stela.</page><page sequence="17">652 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 37, 1935 curs on Stela 4 at Piedras Negras (Maler, 1901, pl. 14). Another shows a man seated in a niche, to which he has mounted by a short flight of steps (fig. 3, i). He wears a headdress showing a snake snout with the three- member bird elements behind it. On top of the niche leans a god with a snake head behind each elbow, and what seems to be a dumpy bird above his head. This is in many points similar to Stelae 6, 11, 14, 25, 33 (Maler, 1901, pls. 15, 20, 22, 26), which show figures associated with the Serpent Bird and Two-headed Dragon, seated in niches reached by steps. Another figurine group shows a man seated on a flat table with inscribed oblong legs that are narrower at the bottom than at the top (fig. 3, h). Below this dais sit two attendants, stressing the resemblance to Lintel 3 (University Museum Bulletin). The fourth figurine group, showing the Jaguar God pro- tecting a king or priest and his two attendants (fig. 4, a), presents the same idea as Stela 10, in slightly different form. STYLE Y Style Y is a crude, bold treatment of figures in the round that pays little attention to detail. The figurines grouped under this heading have a cer- tain unity of feeling, and a superficial resemblance to Mexican figurines. Style Y does not, however, have the homogeneity of Style X. It is one of those expedients to which a classificatory system must resort. From the differences apparent in the illustrations in Figure 4, one would be tempted to group the figurines of Y la and Y 2a into a Jonuta style, those of Y ic and Y 2b into a Peninsular style, the half dozen red-orange heads from Piedras Negras (fig. 4, g) into a Piedras Negras style. The scarcity of specimens and their diversity of provenience makes this unwise. It seems better to leave them at present in a group bound together by the character- istics mentioned, and by their distinction from other Maya figurines. Style Y occurs in the Highlands, along the Usumacinta, in Vera Cruz, and the Yucatecan peninsula. We have no data adequate for dating it, al- though the appearance at Piedras Negras of the heads mentioned above places them in the Old Empire. Y 1. Hands at sides. A woman with hair parted in the middle and hang- ing on her shoulders wears ear disks and a skirt, or a skirt and short triangu- lar cape (fig. 4, b), Y la. This simple hairdressing and costume occurs on a few figurines of Style X, one of them a girl carrying water (Dieseldorff, 1926, fig. 24; Seler, 1904, figs. 18: c,3 f; 21: b), and on one of the Tabascan style (Spinden, 1913, pl. 17:4), and probably denotes a slave or peasant.

LOCAL STYLES HIGHLAND STYLE This is a highly conventionalized style, which produces very crude figures of which the lower part is absorbed into a columnar base. Although the figures seem mouldmade, they give the impression of having been de- scribed by crude incising, and probably derive from a stone prototype. H 1. Seated Woman. C. They show so far only one type, a woman, prob- ably seated with knees crossed (fig. 4, h). She has a round, undecorated head, and wears huipil, pik, and necklace. Sometimes she holds a dog, some- times possibly a child. GULF COAST STYLES Three styles along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, from Campeche, Tabasco, and Vera Cruz respectively, are tied together by a common type, a figure standing with hands raised to the shoulder. CAMPECHE STYLE The figure, of red clay, slipped with white, is squat and heavy, with the lower part of the body often rendered as a block, ending in a flat base; the back is merely a slightly convex, smoothed piece of clay. The face is broad, flat, expressionless, conforming to the type described under Headform C, and the headdress is usually low and wide, the central hair parting often shown by a shallow groove. The impression given is that the emphasis of the artist has been on fitting a figure into a preconceived oblong form rather than on faithfully representing a human being. C 1. Hands raised. Figures standing with hands raised include men and women. Their costumes consist of necklace and short skirt, fitting close around the waist, or long skirt and cape with a rounded point that is-very like the women's costume from Oaxaca (fig. 5, a). Textile design is indi- cated, but without the meticulous emphasis found in Vera Cruz. C 2. Hands down. Another pose shows the arms downstretched, elbows</page><page sequence="20">BUTLER] MAYA MOULDMADE FIGURINES 655 slightly bent, and arms resting against the body (fig. 5, b).

A similar costume, showing a Tlaloc head, occurs on two (?)4 armless, possibly broken, figurines in this style. This type of costume, then, may belong to persons dedicated to various cults. TABASCO STYLE This seems to be a modification of the Campeche style from contact with Style X. The figure, though rendered as in Campeche, is not so squat and heavy. The head is that of Form A, usually with a high squared head- dress, hair being indicated by widely-spaced, incised lines, a tied headdress by broad fillets of clay. Tabascan figurines tend to be of red-orange clay. T 1. Hands raised. A. The most frequent type shows a woman standing with hands raised to shoulder level, forearms close to the sides (fig. 5, c). Her costume is simple and stylized, usually a long skirt and a cape with deep rounded point; textile patterns are shown only in the border. She often has a trefoil applied to her forehead, and tattooing around mouth and chin. Such facial decoration is seen again on a robed suppliant with stepped hairdressing on Lintel 26 at Yaxchilan (Maler, 1903, pl. 58). T 2. Standing Woman. A. This shows a standing woman with hands resting at her waist, wearing a poncho-like upper garment so arranged as to hang to the waist in front, to the skirt hem behind, falling like long sleeves over the forearm (fig. 5, d). The textile design on one of these gar- ments, is, as we see from stone reliefs, one very characteristic of the middle Usumacinta, and in strong contrast to the textiles on figurines from Vera Cruz. Where the latter show an unbroken surface of small elements, styl- ized, often derived from naturalistic motives, the former has only a large Maltese cross at intervals. A headdress unique with this type is an elaborate textile one with frills and tassels bulging in all directions. These women hold a bag, a fan, a disk with incised decorations. A simply dressed woman in Style Y, probably from Jaina (JC), also holds with both hands a similar disk, which may represent a bunch of flowers. A large stone figure, similar to these Tabasco figurines, comes from near Xochicalco in the Valley of Mexico (Seler, 1888, p. 108, fig. 64). T 3. Hands turned out. This shows a standing woman whose arms rest at her sides, with hands turned out (fig. 5, e). She wears a tunic bordered with a stepped design similar in derivation to that on the costume of T 2. She wears leggings, and a turban headdress reminiscent of one often found on figurines from the Uloa Valley (PM). A figurine in a similar pose in Style * The specimen shown by Dieseldorff, 1926, fig. 51, may be the same as that in the Pea- body Museum.

VERA CRUZ STYLE The body is in the round, crudely rendered, but realistic, while the head has the characteristic Totonac face, broad, flat, and smiling, showing only two front teeth with their outer corners filed away. VC 1. Hands Raised. C. The Vera Cruz hands-raised type often has the upper arm extended in a straight line from the shoulder, so that the bent elbows raise the hands to the level of the head; sometimes the arms are outstretched (fig. 5, g). Occasionally one hand holds a knife. The figures so far seem all to be those of men, wearing a narrow breast band with a skirt or loincloth, or a skirt and tight fitting jacket. Skirts are fairly long and set low about the hips; the textiles have elaborate stylized designs, ge- ometric or snake-derived, painstakingly reproduced. Hairdressing is simple, and low. VC 2. Hands down. C. Some of these people stand, like those of Cam- peche, 2, with the arms downstretched, elbows slightly bent, and arms rest- ing against the body (fig. 5, f). CARIBBEAN STYLE At the other extreme of the Maya area, we find the distinctive style of the Uloa Valley. ULOA STYLE The artistic and sophisticated "Archaic" figurines from here have al- ready been considered. They probably preceded, and certainly excelled, the mouldmade style. The chief characteristics of the latter are the grooved eyes adopted from the "Archaic" technique, and the laying of emphasis on face and headdress, with a very summary treatment of the body. Faces are broad and flat; bodies usually nude; headdresses low and wide; and the whole feeling is bold, crude, and conventionalized. U 1. Arms bent. C. The most frequent pose is standing, with hands on the abdomen (fig. 6, a). Five of these figures are unusually small, and show a person in a pointed cap with side flaps. The arms are sometimes greatly exaggerated. U 2. Second Face. C. A standing figure with a second face on the ab- domen shows a man with a mask on his girdle, or a mask pouch hanging from it (fig. 6, b). U 3. Seated Woman. C. A seated woman with outstretched legs holds some object in her hand.

Whistles. There are in this style two specialized whistle forms. The first is an old man variant of the head whistle referred to under X 13a, U 4a (fig. 6, f). The other is what might be called the "porter" whistle, U 4b. It shows men with more or less elaborate heads, larger than their crude bodies. They bend forward under the weight of the large bundle on their backs, which is the whistle mouthpiece. A third leg holds the figures upright. The heads show old and young men, and vary in their' degree of skill (fig. 6, g). There are occasional sets of double figures that are of ethnographical interest. One may represent acrobats, since it shows a man holding on his shoulder another man upside down. Another shows a man and wife, with marked contrast between the two in costume, headdress, teeth, and eye technique (fig. 6, e). Another, like a plaque in Style X from the Highlands (Seler, 1908, pl. 1: 2), showing two young men standing side by side, may perhaps represent the Divine Twins of Quiche mythology. CONCLUSIONS We find, then, two general styles of mouldmade figurine in the Maya area, and five local ones. Style X can, from distribution and archaeological data, be associated in space and time with the Maya Old Empire, and from frequency can be considered characteristic of it. It persists into Yucatan and the second millenium A.D. Style Y is infrequent. It can be placed in space, along the Usumacinta, in Vera Cruz and the Peninsula, but it has no corresponding anchor in time. The local styles along the Gulf Coast can be compared on the basis of the common type of standing figure with arms raised. In the Vera Cruz dis- trict this is modified by the addition of a characteristic Totonac head. In Tabasco it is modified, presumably by contact with Style X, and has a Form A head with high headdress. Only in Campeche do we find the type in a style showing apparently no outside influence. Most of the Campeche specimens of this type come from the island of Jaina, which was known as a centre of pilgrimage. This suggests an indigenous origin, in a cult centering in Jaina, for this Campeche style, and for the type, the two subsequently spreading together, with the style being modified in each place diffused to by the style predominant there. The implication, from the Tabascan style, and the Cycle Nine dates found in Jaina and southern Campeche, is that these styles also began in the Old Empire. We have no check on how long they lasted. These styles may be said to fall into two groups; Style X and the Tabascan and Vera Cruz styles on one hand, Style Y and the Campeche</page><page sequence="25">660 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 37, 1935 and Highland styles on the other. In the first group, Style X is taken as characteristic of the Usumacinta section of the Maya Old Empire, the other styles as its modification by contact with the second group. The influences represented by this second group may be Mexican, or may reflect some cur- rent or series of currents within the Maya area as yet unreported in other forms of art. The unique character and geographical position of the Uloa Valley style suggests some people coming up from the south into a sphere of Maya in- fluence. Considering types irrespective of style, common American types rep- resented in the Maya area are the mother-and-child, found from the Valley of Mexico to Venezuela, with a special religious implication in the middle Usumacinta area, and the hunchback, known from Tennessee to Costa Rica. There are far-flung similarities of pose and detail that may or may not be significant. For example, figurines can be found from the Valley of Mexico to Ecuador, showing a person holding one hand to the face. A very long vertical flange for the ear, with a hole at top and bottom occurs on figurines from Copan to Vera Cruz. Types found in Mexico and the Maya area include the Diving God, an- thropomorphic animals, and the nude Fat Man. Types characteristic of the Maya area are the Owl Man, the clothed Fat Man, the person seated with feet tucked under him (X 11, X 12, Y2, H 1), the Dancer, the Ball-player, the persons standing with arms raised or downstretched with elbows bent. While the dancer, in the type referred to under X 8, is confined to the Highlands, the standing pose there described occurs elsewhere, and its ap- pearance on one of the Owl Men figures (fig. 1, f) emphasizes the ritual character of this type. The Owl Man is found along the lower Usumacinta and in Vera Cruz. Only Vera Cruz Owl Men have attributes of the Serpent Bird, although other figurines seem to show the same association of ideas. The association of a costume with possible owl derivation with the clothed Fat Man; the appearance on the Toltec nude Fat Man of a headdress that probably represents an owl; the possible connection between the clothed Fat Man and the Winged Man; the relationship of the clothed Fat Man and the nude Fat Man, the relation of the B head form to both, and their relation to Toltec figurines; these are problems that cannot be solved at present. The owl cult was of real importance among the Old Empire Maya; so was the Fat Man, a figurine type which was connected not only with the owl, but with the Valley of Mexico. The persons standing with arms raised, or downstretched with elbows</page><page sequence="26">BUTLER] MAYA MOULDMA DE FIGURINES 661 bent, occur only along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico from Campeche to Vera Cruz; the Ball-player appears only at Lubaantun. There is a low, broad headdress characterized by a horizontal roll of twisted fabric, which is found only in Style Y and the Campeche and Uloa styles, and is always associated with a Form C head (fig. 6, g). In regard to headform, we can safely call Form A the characteristic Maya headform, through its constant use to represent these people in major and minor arts. It is found in every section of the Maya area. High head- dresses characterize the heads from Old Empire sites; low headdresses those from Yucatan. Heads of B form are not so frequent. They are found along the Usu- macinta, in the Peten, British Honduras, and in the Highlands. If the sug- gested association of such a physical type with a northern tribe, such as the Olmecs, should be borne out by further excavations, its appearance among the Maya might have some historical significance. One of the two types to which most of the whole specimens with B heads belong, the nude Fat Man and the clothed Fat Man, seems to have northern affiliations. Form C heads are more common on the peripheries of the Maya area than in its center. This headform occurs occasionally in Style X, notably in the Vera Cruz Winged Man, and characterizes the heads of Style Y and the Highland, Campeche, and Uloa styles. The suggestion that this head- form represents actual physical characteristics, and is not, for the most part, due to conventionalization present in the styles cited, is supported by two facts. One is the appearance, in Style X in Tabasco (PM) and Lubaantun (Joyce, 1933, pl. 2), and in the Campeche style (Schellhas, pl. 17: 2) of a Form C head with the kind of woman's hairdressing where hair, parted in the middle and drawn down over the forehead, is piled in coils on top of the head. The other is the retention of the A headform in the Tabasco style, and of the Totonacan head in the Vera Cruz style. Considering Maya mouldmade figurines geographically, we find that along that part of the Usumacinta, the middle stretch, where important Old Empire cities occur, all but about a dozen of the figurines are in Style X. Apparently unique here are a figurine type, the woman-with-adult- child, and two kinds of headdress. One is the simple stepped headdress often found on Form A heads (fig. 1, a); this occurs with any number of additions and variations throughout the Old Empire, but the plain, un- adorned variety has been so far found only in this region. The other head- dress is*the sugarloaf variety of B head described on page 643. Although there is a surprising lack of mouldmade figurines in the Peten, another centre of Old Empire culture, what specimens there are fit into the</page><page sequence="27">662 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 37, 1935 Usumacinta types. Almost all the figurines from the Highlands are in Style X; there are, outside it, only a dozen specimens of a local style, and a few examples of Style Y. The Dancer type belongs to this region. Through- out it, and down to the mouth of the Usumacinta, Style X headdresses, usually on Form A heads, include turbans (figs. 1, d, 5, e), high-pointed hats (Dieseldorff, 1926, fig. 40), variations of the stepped headdress or hairdressing (figs. 3, e, 5, d), and what seems to be a tight, close hood, over a high head (fig. 1, b). All the British Honduras specimens considered are from Lubaantun, and seem, from the photographs and drawings published, all to conform to Style X. There are three figurine types, and a kind of headdress, that are so far unique here. The types are the Ball-player, the Woman-at-the- metate, and the Man-in-a-litter, of which the last two are the only types of Maya figurines that can definitely be called genre, though single genre figurines occur elsewhere. The headdress is associated with high Form A heads, and seems to be a woman's (fig. 2, e). In Tabasco and the lower Usumacinta we find Style X, Style Y, and a local style. Unique types are the Style Y woman with arms at her sides, and the Tabascan style woman who holds with both hands a probable bouquet. Figurines in all three styles from Jonuta, the site from which comes most of the archaeological material from this district, are usually made of an orange clay that is also characteristic of Jonuta pottery. Following the Gulf coast west, we find in Vera Cruz the Winged Man and Serpent Bird figures in Style X, and the hands raised and elbows bent type in a local style. A pose unique here is a figure standing with arms outstretched to the sides. Following the Gulf coast north, we find in Campeche a distinctive local style, probably centering in the island of Jaina, and some specimens of Style X. Style Y is represented by figures in high headdresses and bulging breastknots. The technical characteristic shown in the arms of seated figures (X 12a, Y 2b) may belong to the southern Campeche district. Along the Gulf coast, we get the unique hands-raised and hands-down types, central hair parting shown by a shallow groove, and distinctive kinds of dress, of which a woman's costume of skirt and cape with rounded point (fig. 5, a, b, c) is related to south Mexican costume. In Yucatan, Form A heads are almost invariably short, with low headdresses and hair- dressing. Many of those from Labna have, between the eyebrows, an object resembling a vertical bar with a shorter one run transversely through it (E. H. Thompson, pl. 12: figs. 6-9, 14) which occurs also on a large stucco head from Comalcalco (Blom and La Farge, 1926, fig. 94).</page><page sequence="28">BUTLER] MAYA MOULDMADE FIGURINES 663 In the Uloa Valley, mouldmade figurines occur only in the local style. Unique here are the woman seated with legs outstretched before her, and the double figure, both of them types characteristic of countries to the south. Two pieces of negative evidence apparent in a study of Maya figurines may be wiped out by further digging. At present they lead automatically to that ever-recurring question, "Where did the Maya come from?" The two points are the lack of figurines at sites where they would be most ex- pected, and the lack of an intermediate style between the "Archaic" and Style X, characteristic of the Old Empire. Holmul and Uaxactun are the only two sites in the Peten where careful excavation has been undertaken. The first has no figurines, the second only "Archaic" ones which occur in an early stratum containing distinctive pottery. The pottery of the next period develops from the first, but shows the influence of Holmul. "Archaic" figurines do not occur at Piedras Negras, the only site where systematic excavation has been attempted in the middle Usumacinta. Nor is there any evidence of early occupation of the site, corresponding to the earliest levels at Uaxactun. We have from the first a very fine type of figurine that is obviously the product of a sophisticated, artistic culture, belonging to a people with the headform that we think of as typically Maya. It appears fullblown and grown, presenting a problem unparalleled in Mexico, where there is a fairly steady development from "Archaic" through Toltec to Aztec. Where are the roots of this type of figurine? At present we would say that they are not necessarily in the Maya "Archaic," since at Uaxactun we get a continuous development from the "Archaic" that produces no mouldmade figurines. There must have been introductory stages to the Maya mouldmade figurine, but as yet we cannot trace them. The evidence considered here bears out the distinction suggested by J. E. Thompson (1932) between the cities of the Peten and those of the Usumacinta, and the spread of influence from the Usumacinta-Chiapas district up the west coast into Yucatan. It also supports any correlation of the Christian and Maya calendars that shortens the span of Maya power, since styles and types characteristic of the Old Empire persist with so little change into Yucatan and into the second millennium.
