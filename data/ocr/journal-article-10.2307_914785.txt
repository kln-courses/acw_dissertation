Who is there who cannot recall among his acquaintances of mature years some to whom the great social changes brought about by the recent upheaval appear as temporary aberrations, or even as a kind of nightmare from which we shall all presently awake ? It is a very natural tendency, and possibly a healthy one, acting as it does as a brake upon the too hasty acceptance of change. Without it, changes which are mere fluctuations might too readily be unconsciously endowed with those same attributes of perma- nence. But it generally implies a reluctance to admit the reality of changes the pattern of whose rhythm is too broad to be apprehended in close perspective without the aid of historical interpretation. To take a musical illustration, the great body of opera-goers have cognisance only of what they term 'grand opera,' which, in spite of its present difficulties, they endow with this perma- nence. They often speak as if opera had always been of the type they know, with its panoply of elaborate means. But of the three centuries of operatic history only one has been concerned with 'grand' opera, and it is merely the circumstance that this century created the environment they know which leads them to believe that environment to be permanently and indissolubly linked to opera of the past, the present, and the future. For them opera is 'grand opera,' and any departure from the type ceases for them to be opera. But ' grand opera' in that sense was only brought into existence by the new social conditions created after the Napoleonic convulsions, and it is not thriving under the new social conditions resulting from another, still more catastrophic, disturbance. Those of us who regard it as a declining, if not moribund, institution do not question that opera itself will endure. It is the type that will change-and, in fact, is changing -as the inherited r6pertoire gradually dwindles through the erosion of obsolescence. In England, where such opera as we are periodically allowed to enjoy has long been restricted to this inherited rdpertoire, we are naturally less conscious of this obsolescence, and this helps to foster the illusion of permanence. But the record of new B productions, both on the Continent and in those 'side-shows' where we are occasionally shown an opera by one of our own composers, proves that a new type of production is evolving which is opera, but not 'grand opera' as hitherto understood. Those of our musicians who have attained to middle age or beyond entered upon the field of their activities when the great Romantic movement of the 19th century still held undis- puted sway. The mode of thought engendered by it, and even the technical processes by which that mode of thought was expressed, was so general as to constitute an environment which was accepted without question, and uncon- sciously endowed with permanence. Confronted with the fact that its inception was an event- and not even a very remote one-which could be approximately dated, they would either argue that it was a definite step forward in evolution, from which music would never turn back, or they would endeavour to prove that what it represented had always been inherent in music, and that only the description was new at the time it came into use. When a generation of composers arose with other than romantic preoccupations it was, of course, much easier to declare that these young men were either without feeling, or could not express what they felt, than it was to realise that the out- pouring of romantic sentiment was not the purpose with which they approached music. Such is the eagerness to regard as permanent that which familiarity has made congenial. But a Romantic movement, with definable characteristics, is a subdivision common to the history of all art, one which recurs in accordance with laws which have been empirically estab- lished. In aesthetics, ' romantic ' is, in fact, less an epithet descriptive of poetic content than a term of art chronology, defining the position of a work of art in the historical sequence to which it belongs. It is a definite phase, with an ascertainable beginning, and therefore pre- sumably an end, which must come some day, however reluctantly to be accepted by those to whom the romantic conception of art is congenial, by temperament or familiarity. Even writers on aesthetic, who should be more objective than the rest of us, have been to some extent affected by this trait. It must be remembered that music, being the most self- contained of the arts, is usually the last of them to be influenced by thought currents arising externally. What we know in music as the Romantic movement had set in appreciably earlier in literature. Modern zesthetic is com- monly regarded as opening with Baumbarten's ' IEsthetica,' which appeared in 1750, the year of Bach's death, and the arguments concern- ing expression were inaugurated by Lessing's 'Laokoon' in 1769. His controversy with Winckelmann is, in fact, the starting point of this discussion. But looking back on the</page><page sequence="2">210 THE MUSICAL TIMES-MARCH 1 1930 whole history of esthetic from that date to this one cannot fail to notice that it almost coincides with that of the Romantic movement. Roman- ticism was prominent in the environment in which its protagonists had their being, and could scarcely fail to affect all but the most austere of them with that same feeling of permanence to which I have referred. Thus, whilst accepting the classification of successive art-types, many of them have tended relatively to magnify the functions of the romantic, which loomed so large in their intellectual outlook. There is of course nothing esoteric about the classification itself, which is based upon nothing more controversial than that everything that is not eternal must have a beginning, a middle, and an end. Art phases, whether long or short, are not eternal. Therefore they are subject to this obvious law. Their history falls into three well-defined periods. In the first an art medium is discovered, or invented, and developed. In the second the artist finds this perfected medium awaiting him, and has no other preoccupation than that of putting it to the best use. In the third he finds a medium which has been thoroughly exploited before he appeared on the scene, and he is therefore compelled to envisage ways and means of endowing it with new signifi- cance. The obvious alternative of inventing new resources does not for a long time commend itself. The loyalty inspired by a proved classical idiom is too strong. Neither does the exaggeration of its formative elements readily commend itself, though it commonly ensues before the end. The first device adopted is that of stressing what a modern newspaper editor would call the 'human interest' motive, and the next of reinforcing it with associations, literary, ethical, or what not, which are ex- traneous to the medium-'that is to say, enlisting outside help. The two devices are the main constituents of a Romantic movement. Roman- ticism is thus the first sign of the approaching end, whether of an epoch or of a period. It is an Indian summer, a prelude to the decadence which eventually reveals itself in excesses and exaggerations of all kinds, the motive of which is always that of exacting yet more significance from a tired medium. Historically it may herald the end, as it did in Graeco-Roman art, but more often the inevitable reaction against it heralds a new beginning. Hence the later stages of a Romantic movement and the ensuing decadence will sometimes be found to coincide or overlap with the early stages of the movement which is to follow. As both romanticism and the formal exaggerations mentioned above gradually cease to furnish the desired significance, at long last recourse is had to the invention of new idioms, and another chapter of art-history opens before the preceding one is closed. Thus it comes about that a flood of new aesthetic doctrines and technical innovations may invade the field at a time of decadence, with the result that, for lack of historical background, some observers may make the mistake of regarding the former as symptoms of the latter, whereas decadence is rarely, if ever, inventive. Whatever it says is the same, only more so. The classification into three art-types is generally accepted, but the nomenclature has varied. Hegel, for instance, calls the first the 'symbolic' type, and if one remembers that the letters of the alphabet and the Arabic numerals are symbols, the description is not inapposite, though that is not the sense in which he uses it. Nowadays, however, symbolism is differently regarded, and such conventions as the leitmotiv system appear to fit the term better. On the other hand I dislike the alterna- tive of 'primitive,' which conveys a suggestion of crudity, whereas the type it describes may be quite the opposite. Only concerning the naming of the second, or 'classical' type is there general agreement. After it there is again a choice of terms. One of the most satisfying systems of musical esthetics I have read, that of Charles Lalo, even subdivides the three types as follows: I.-Etat pr6-classique 1. Primitifs. 2. Precurseurs. II.-Etat classique 1. Grands classiques. 2. Pseudo- classiques. III.-Etat post-classique 1. Romantiques. 2. D6cadents. Another point is that Hegel, whose ' ,sthetic ' (posthumously compiled from notes of his lectures) is significantly dated 1835, is not content with three successive types in the same art. Though he describes these as occurring in each of them, he also places the arts themselves in a similar relation to each other, regarding architecture as symbolic, sculpture as classic, and music as romantic. No doubt most of the music he heard was romantic, and played roman- tically by romantic people. It is important to repeat here that in this sense 'romantic' and similar words are terms, not of praise or blame, but, as I said above, of art-chronology. I am no believer in the miracle of the individual who is above time and place. Great men summarise the age in which they live. Even if they see ahead of it, it is only a very little way in any historical sense. They may tower above it, but they are still of it. They will achieve greatly, whatever their period, but it will be great art of its period, though that period be a decadence, and if it be so it is no reproach to them, for they cannot determine when they shall appear, or what kind of a world they will find. Nor can they ignore the world as they find it, or it would merely ignore them, and it is only the very young, or the very vanitous, who think of making a world for themselves. To quote a</page><page sequence="3">THE MUSICAL TIMES-MARCH 1 1930 211 musical instance, a discerning critic has written of the 'over-ripeness' or autumnal feeling of Delius's music, which is an attribute of deca- dence, but only a highly gifted man such as Delius could have achieved so much with a medium that had reached that stage. Or put it this way. Given a certain fixed measure of the art-impulse and of the creative energy which is its executive element, how will it work out at the three stages we have described ? At the primitive stage much of it will go to the fashioning of the idiom. It is therefore not improbable that the results may suffer by this distribution of energy, and be superseded when the next stage is reached. At the classical stage the whole energy is available for the creation of masterpieces. At the third stage the effort required for the extraction of more juice from a partially squeezed orange must again absorb much of the available energy. Thus the works of three men of equal genius may differ greatly in their chances of immortality. But the achievement of immortality is not the true artist's motive. That is the audience's laurel wreath. The critic must also measure his enrichment of his art, his share in its evolution. Take Debussy as an example. I neither know nor care whether immortality awaits any of his works, nor do I believe that therein lies the measure of his greatness. But I do know that he played a vital part in the evolution of his art, which he left richer than he found it ; and what finer thing can be said of any artist ? There are many composers of esteemed and possibly immortal works whose very existence could be blotted out and leave the course of musical evolution unchanged. Obliterate Debussy and it must be sensibly deflected. The vocabulary of praise or blame being at best limited, this comparison of the different types easily becomes a pitfall for the conservative critic. When he liberally sprinkles eulogistic adjectives over some competent artist who has complied with his, the critic's, conservative predilections, and the next day vituperates or ridicules a work like ' Pierrot Lunaire ' or ' Les Noces,' his choice of terms easily convicts him of a deplorable lack of sense of proportion, for even if the new resources employed in such works are destined to be put to more advan- tageous use by succeeding composers profiting at second-hand by the experience gained in them, the fact still remains that the creators of such works contribute to musical evolution in a degree of which more compliant composers are incapable. Van Gogh may have exaggerated when he declared that in art there are revolu- tionists and plagiarists, and no others, but what he thus stated in exaggerated terms was nevertheless fundamentally true. Place side by side the first* criticisms of ' Lamia' and of ' Le Sacre du Printemps,' and a reader unversed in the vocabulary must inevitably deduce that Miss Dorothy Howell is a greater composer than Stravinsky, a pretension which I am sure that lady would not put forward on her own behalf. Such is the effect of conservative criticism. The passage from the classic to the romantic taking place gradually, one has to cite extreme instances of either in order to make clear wherein the difference lies. The circumstance that the ' Laokoon' was not an extreme case probably accounts for the spate of words to which it gave rise. It was discovered at Rome in 1506, and is generally regarded as being of the Rhodian school, which stands to the great age of Greek sculpture as romantic to classic. But, as Bosanquet says, 'A statue which seems almost un-Hellenic when compared with the marbles of the Parthenon, might appear full of Greek dignity when compared with works by the degenerate successors of Michael Angelo.' There is in the British Museum a magnificent head of, I believe, Rameses II. Its features are composed, probably more symmetrical than those of the sitter, and completely free from any suggestion of what is termed ' expression.' It achieves its effect by classical means, that is to say by a superb disposition of the sculptor's medium. Compare it with, for instance, one of the popular portraits of Mussolini expressing -perhaps I should say 'registering '-power, and you have two instances sufficiently extreme to make the difference a glaring one. Note that the Egyptian head is far from inexpressive. It is, in fact, the more expressive of the two, but the expression is not an added device of the artist's ; it resides in the form and substance of the art work. Neither is all romantic art of the extreme type I have cited, but its expressive- ness is deliberate and intentional, achieved by well-established devices. And therein lies the weakness of romanticism, which condemns it to travel the path that leads to decadence, for these devices, like felicitous phrases in literature, do not retain their original vividness. Invented as they are for purposes of deliberate expression, only the status of the artist employing them preserves them, for a time, from the ad cap- tandum usage to which they eventually succumb. I have heard of a text-book on composition which speaks of a ' technique of grief,' meaning skill in the use of the devices which an audience recognises as expressive of grief. When they reach that stage they obviously express nothing at all, and the artist who is preoccupied with. the expression of grief is driven by necessity to the use of still more grievous devices. In Weber's day an unprepared diminished seventh had an effect of dramatic poignancy, but it would have been of little use to Strauss in 'Salome.' Similarly, the ' yearning' appoggia- tura meant something in Wagner's day, but there has been so much yearning 'expressed' * If I particularise ' first' it is because a critic whose first 'naive reactions' to ' Les Noces' led him to write of its puerility has now referred to it as a tour de fore--with reservations upon which time, if permitted, will no doubt have an equally mellowing effect.</page><page sequence="4">212 THE MUSICAL TIMES-MARCH 1 1930 by its means that surviving or belated romantics can yearn as much as they like and nobody cares. It was recently stated, with a naive air of discovery, that the stumbling-block of the 'present discontents' was Wagner. That, pre- cisely, was what Schdnberg discovered long ago. He realised that travelling that path was travelling down a slope the declivity of which increased progressively until it must become precipitous. One imagines an inner conflict between his German romanticism and his penetrating Jewish intelligence which warned him of what lay ahead. The same writer refers to a ' modernist hatred for Wagner '-the exist- ence of which is news to me-as 'based on the soundest of self-protective instincts.' Should an artist be without the instinct of self- preservation ? Should he persevere, a tort et a travers, in applying further pressure to the orange after realising how thoroughly it has been squeezed ? Whatever may be the ultimate fate of Sch6nberg's endeavours to evolve a new idiom, he was right in taking the path of invention. It was not as if he had not explored the possibilities of the inherited medium. In the 'Gurre-Lieder' he proved his mastery of them. He was in a position to judge. The real fallacy is that of those critics who insist upon comparing the 'expressiveness '-in that sense itself a term of romanticism-of the new idiom, which is still at the first of its prospective stages, with an idiom which is ' over-ripe': that is to say, comparing the pre-classic of this period with the post-classic of the last. It may be at least a generation before the new period produces even a classic-and then it will prove itself precocious as periods go. Meanwhile its primitives and precursors are assumed to be challenging the romantics upon their own ground of expressiveness, in which they have no particular interest at present, their whole attention being concentrated upon the new material and its possibilities. They are in the position of the early polyphonists who fashioned the device of the canon. It was not until long afterwards that canonic imitation was used for purposes of 'expression.' Romanticism at its best is, so to speak, the brow of a hill, the summit of which is occupied by the classics. To the 'plain man,' who is an object of so much solicitude just now, probably the brow of the hill is its most picturesque feature. But once an art-phase leaves the summit, the race of excesses and exaggerations commences. Is emotion the order of the day? Then successive composers will outvie each other until the last of them either strive to make their audience hysterical or invite it to wallow in emotion as a form of self-indulgence.* Is it ethical loftiness ? Then eventually even tyros scarcely out of their 'teens will transform the commonest of all art-formulae (inaction-action -inaction) into the struggles of a noble soul through vicissitudes and tribulations towards victory and ensuing peace. Is it size or power ? Then the eloquence of Wagner will be followed by the magniloquence of Strauss. One feature of romanticism is that, since it seeks reinforce- ments from without, sooner or later it is attracted by realism. There also the progress from Wagner's forest murmurs to Strauss's flock of sheep is a slope, and, in my opinion, a steep one. But why continue ? All these phenomena have their precedents. Take the last one. Compare the fine, almost heraldic, animals of classic sculpture with those of a later day in the Vatican Gallery, so 'expressive' of an emotion which is 'almost human.' It has nothing to do with real expression. The cat is naturally one of the most expressive of all animals. Steinlen used to say that a man who could draw a cat could draw anything. But burden a cat with 'expression' and you are bound to end in the anthropomorphic menagerie of Louis Wain. The chief interest in the present phase is the overlapping of the final stages, part late- romantic and part decadent, of one period, with the primitive, exploring stage of another, and the chief difficulty in its study is that of dis- entangling tendencies and cross-currents which are often in conflict within the same personality, sometimes asserting themselves in the strangest combinations or contradictions. It is further complicated by the uncommon but not unknown phenomenon of a wave of pseudo-archaism. In the craving for significance a kind of Antaeus- like contact is sought with a remote, and therefore less embarrassing, past than the preceding stage. Such reactions against the immediate past in favour of a tradition regarded as more austere are well provided with precedent in other spheres. Egypt experienced one under Psamatik I., Babylonia under Nabonidus. There is really very little new under the sun. * It is this romantic tendency to play upon the sensibilities of the audience that caused an art critic, R. H. Wilenski, to write the other day of Giorgione that he 'was the first Italian artist to sublimate his sensuality in pictorial composition like a musical composer; the first to use painting to achieve contact with the sensibility of the spectator and to regard that contact as the aim in itself of the painter's art; the first to degrade painting to the level of music. I say "degrade" because music is, of course, the lowest of the arts, since it can appeal to the spectator's sensibility without passing through the filter of the mind.' Of course he is wrong, but it is the Romantics who, by playing upon the emotions of their audiences, have led him astray.</page></plain_text>
