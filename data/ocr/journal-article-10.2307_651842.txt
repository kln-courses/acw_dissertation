<plain_text><page sequence="1">Chinese Communist Treatment of the Thinkers of the Hundred Schools Period By DONALD J. MUNRO ALTHOUGH there is no detailed definitive Chinese Communist interpre- tation of the thinkers of the 100 Schools Period,1 this does not mean that one cannot isolate certain constants from which deviation is not per- mitted. The sayings of Marx-Engels and Mao Tse-tung which are directly relevant to the early thinkers, if not strictly about them, have obviously been the primary guidelines for the scholar in Communist China. Especially in the material produced since 1957, when relatively intensive study of the period began, one becomes aware of more specific trends in interpretation. With the basic tenets of Marx and Engels as tools for interpretation, it is axiomatic that understanding the class struggle of a given time is the key to understanding the thought of that time. The " contention" among the 100 Schools is taken to be a reflection of the intensity of class struggle in the Warring States Period. It is also axiomatic that the history of the struggle between progressive and reactionary forces is reflected in the enduring philosophical struggle between materialism and idealism. But the philosophical concepts associated with materialism and idealism are not native to China; nor are their Marxist definitions universally accepted in the history of Western philosophy. Therefore, in interpreting the thought of the 100 Schools Period, scholars most frequently cite Marx-Engels definitions as support for their own interpretations or to criticise those of others. Engels states that all those who take spirit as prior to the existence of the natural world and thus in the last analysis admit a creator (Old Testament variety or the more sophisticated Absolute Spirit of Hegel) belong in the idealist camp. Those who take the natural world as 1 In the selection of works to be read for a study of this kind, one is necessarily guided in part by subjective factors. One gets the feeling from repeated exposure to articles and books on the 100 Schools Period that certain authors are the most widely discussed among their peers. Their names continually crop up in the works of other scholars, and their articles are regularly included in compilations of selected pieces on a specific topic. I have tried to concentrate on men of this calibre. But in addition to my "impressions" I had the advantage of very helpful advice from Professor Wing-tsit Chan, of Dartmouth College. Strictly speaking, the term " 100 Scholars " refers to the numerous philosophical doctrines which flourished during the Warring States Period (475-221 B.C.), i.e., after the time of Confucius and Mo Tzu. 119</page><page sequence="2">THE CHINA QUARTERLY primary belong to the different schools of materialism.2 A variation on the theme is that those who hold that physical existence determines thought, and hence regard matter as primary, are materialists. Those who hold the reverse, i.e., that reality depends on consciousness to exist, are idealists. A further division is made between "objective idealism" (the view that the true nature of all things is mental, e.g., Reality is one Absolute Mind) and " subjective idealism" (the doctrine that things exist only in minds). The Chinese are accustomed to making this kind of distinction which resembles the Neo-Confucian debate over the priority of li "principle " (or Tao) and ch'i " ether." The statements of Mao which are quoted are more relevant to the Confucian thought of the period than to that of other schools. The first concerning human nature (hsing) reads, "Is there any such thing as a theory of human nature? Of course there is. But there is only concrete human nature, namely, human nature with a class background in the class society, and there is no abstract Human Nature transcendent of classes." 3 Secondly, there is no love of others (denoted by jen in the early works) transcending classes. Mao says, "As for the so-called 'love of humanity,' there has never been such a unified love since humanity was divided into classes.""4 A corollary of both of these statements is an affirmation of the relativity of moral values. "The concepts of morality, immorality, good and evil, are not instinctive, and cannot be deduced rationally from the so-called 'eternal truth' or from the traits of the supposedly non-changing Human Nature," says one Communist theoretical work.5 Chinese scholars must ask several questions in considering a thinker of the 100 Schools: Was his thought idealistic or materialistic (or predominantly one or the other)? This question frequently is broken down into sub-questions, e.g., concerning the idealistic or materialistic nature of his "world view," epistemology, etc. What class did he 2 As stated in Engels, Fei-erh-pa-ha yu Te-kuo Ku-tien Che-hsueh ti Chung-chieh (Feuerbach and the Outcome of German Classical Philosophy) (Shanghai: Jen-min Ch'u-pan She, 1955), pp. 19-20. Since the time of Engels there has been a confusion in Marxist thought between the definition of "materialism " as a belief in " the primacy of Nature over Spirit " (i.e., the denial of a creator God and treatment of mind as a function of matter) and as a belief in objective reality independent of consciousness and sensation (" realism" in Western terminology). In each case "idealism " is defined as the reverse and includes the most diverse of creeds from Hegel's absolute idealism to agnrosticism and scepticism. See Gustav A. Wetter, Dialectical Materialism (New York: Frederick A. Praeger, 1958), pp. 28-296. 3 Mao Tse-tung Hsuan-chi (Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung) (Harbin: Tung-pei Shu-chu, 1948), p. 989, quoted in Dai Shen-yu, Mao Tse-tung and Confucianism (unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, Department of Political Science, University of Pennsylvania, 1952), pp. 150-151. 4 Mao Tse-tung Hsuan-chi, pp. 973, 989, quoted in Dai, p. 163.

What contribution did he make to history-or was his thought progressive or conservative? Scholars are encouraged to investigate the annotation and dating of texts in order to invalidate the interpretations of later (e.g., Sung) commentators who read into the early works ideas appropriate to a later age and thus to discover the original meaning.6 The importance of these constants as charts for interpretation and evaluation is clear to anyone who reads publications on the early thought. More dramatic evidence is available from an examination of targets of criticism. The unfortunate Liu Chieh, of the Department of History, Chungshan University, is a case in point. As a Roman commen- tator once said of Epicurus, he has "the whole pack of philosophers barking around him."7 Drawing his inspiration largely from the Ch'eng-Chu school of Neo-Confucianism 8 and supplementing it with a dose of Hegel (he is classified as an objective idealist), he has violated many of the above guide-lines. He rejects the theory of class struggle as a tool for the study of ancient history, and his key for the study of Chinese thought is not the materialism/idealism struggle but simply the question of the nature of the union between Heaven and man. He and many others accept the Mencius (371-289 B.C.?) definition of human nature as an endowment to all men from Heaven and ignore its class character.9 Unmindful of the relativity of virtues, he treats "human- heartedness" (jen) as an abstract concept transcending time and class, appropriate to any time and any class.l1 In fact, he treats all four cardinal virtues isolated by Mencius (" human-heartedness," "justice," "ritual" and "knowledge ") in this manner."l It is pointed out that he clearly is unaware of the fraud in Mencius' belief that such virtues have universal validity for all people in any age. Thus he is guilty of uncritically glorifying the thought of the early Confucian thinkers and failing to see the deception in their claims of universal validity. Liu is not alone in this error by any means. Fung Yu-lan sees some class content in jen (human-heartedness).12 But, after finding what he 6 For example, see Kuang-ming Jih-pao (Kuang-ming Daily), August 17-18, 1963. 7 Norman W.

His place seems to have been taken by Kuan Feng, whose name is frequently 121</page><page sequence="4">THE CHINA QUARTERLY believes to be Marxist sanction for his view, he goes on to accept as not entirely fraudulent the claims by members of the new (landlord) class in the Eastern Chou (770-221 B.C.) that jen has universal validity. His Marxist references state that, in the beginning while a new class is rising to power and while its own position is unstable, it has not yet formulated its own interests and has some interests in common with other classes.l3 Fung would include all classes as objects of "human- heartedness " in definitions of the concept of jen, such as " It is to love all men "14 and "not doing to others as you would not have done to yourself." 15 But it is held that Fung's view is clearly erroneous, and that he distorted the words of Engels in seeking support for it.ls Attempts by Liu and Fung to find universal validity in a concept such as jen, so that it is applicable today too, are considered not only erroneous but dangerous. They run against Chairman Mao's instruction never to carry out benevolent government to the enemy.17 Those scholars whose studies are not directed by the questions mentioned above but by certain others have been quickly attacked. A common error has been to inquire in what way an early thinker was modern, i.e., of what truths of dialectical materialism was he aware. For example, some scholars have tried to show that the classic work, the Chou I, contains the principle that "practice is the source of knowledge." 18 This is considered dangerous because it leads to worship of the ancient. The value of seeing the eternal truths of Marxism in embryonic form in the early thinkers is not denied. But it seems that one is approaching dangerous ground when he attributes to the ancients ideas that are too sophisticated (from the Marxist point of view). For example, it would be proper to see embryonic dialectical thought in the Chou 1 but not to find therein the law of conversion from quantity to quality. Another error is to carry out one's own study and then simply associated with the activities of the Research Institute of Philosophy of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and who was elected a deputy from Shantung to the Third National People's Congress. Kuan Feng often writes jointly with Lin Yu-shih of the same Institute, who has been connected with the Editor's Office of People's Daily. 13 Fung Yu-lan, "Lun K'ung-tzu kuan-yu 'jen' ti ssu-hsiang" (" On Confucius's Thought Concerning 'Jen '"), Che-hsueh Yen-chiu (Philosophical Research), No. 5, September 1961, p. 67. 14 Confucius, Analects, xii.22.1. ]- Ibid. xii.2. 16 Kuang-ming Jih-pao, November 25, 1963. 17 Mao Tse-tung, On People's Democratic Dictatorship (Peking: Foreign Languages Press, 1961), p. 11; referred to in the critique of Liu Chieh appearing in SCMP, No. 3128. 18 Kuang-ming Jih-pao, November 25, 1963, and Tung Fang-ming, " Che-hsueh shih kung-tso-chung ti i chung chi yu-hai ti fang-fa " (" An Extremely Harmful Method in the Task of Studying the History of Philosophy"), Che-hsueh Yen-chiu, No. 1, January 25, 1963, pp. 33-34. 122</page><page sequence="5">TREATMENT OF THINKERS OF HUNDRED SCHOOLS PERIOD add a coating of class terms in order to achieve orthodoxy.l9 It is also erroneous to ask which ancient truths can guide our conduct today. These, then, are the broad constants guiding the interpretation of the thought of the 100 Schools Period. Coupled with the fact that contemporary Chinese scholars of the period tend to haggle over a very limited number of the same passages in putting forth their theses, the result is an expected impression of some uniformity. CONTROVERSY WITHIN CONSTANTS Within the bounds of the constants, however, a great deal of lively controversy still continues to emerge. Several factors produce a climate which permits controversy. First, the periodisation of early Chinese history has not been officially established, and this may explain the failure to classify early thinkers definitively according to class. Some contemporary scholars hold that the Western Chou was feudal, that the time from the Spring and Autumn period (722-481 B.C.) to the Warring States signalled a shift from a system of feudal lords (the people as private chattels of the lords) to a new feudal landlord economic system (the people as freemen). The other and definitely more popular periodisation stems in part from Kuo Mo-jo. It takes the Western Chou as a slave society and the period from Spring and Autumn to Warring States as marking a shift from slave to feudal society, with the class struggle taking place between slave-owners and the members of the new landlord class, and also involving the struggles of the slaves and internal strife among slave-owners.2 The landlords achieved formal power only gradually and in certain stages (e.g., Ch'i) earlier than others.21 The gradual shift meant that Mencius lived at a time when the slave society and its system of blood-ties still had some strength, whereas at the time of Hsun Tzu (fl. 298-238 B.C.) it had been virtually dissolved,22 and the peasantry was a rising power.23 Also conducive to controversy within the limits of the constants described above is the fact that the effect of class identity on a thinker's doctrines is by no means predetermined. For example, Kuan Feng 19 Kuan Feng and Lin Yu-shih, "Tsai lun K'ung-tzu " (" Second Discussion on Confucius "), K'ung-tzu Che-hsueh T'ao-lun Chi (Collected Discussions on the Philosophy of Confucius) (Peking: Chung-hua Shu-chu, 1963), p. 306.

This is frequently cited in disclaimers of any search for unanimity, though it seems more a slogan than a consistent policy. THE USES OF HISTORY Why should such studies of the early thought be carried out? There are several immediate uses for these studies. They give practice in using Marxism to analyse the philosophical systems which have emerged in history.27 They provide the opportunity for struggle with erroneous doctrines, such as nihilism, the doctrine that denies any basis for know- ledge or truth, sometimes attributed to the early Taoist thinkers. And they lead to the discovery of the laws of thought, or the laws of philo- sophical development, such as the law derived from the study of Chuang Tzu that any search for the beginning of things in the world, things which are without beginning and end, is bound to lead to idealism.28 They also increase an understanding of the era in which a given thinker lived.29 Commentators continually point to the fact that since subsequent rulers adopted many of the views of the 100 Schools thinkers, their hold remained strong. 24 Sung K'eng and Yin Wen are early Taoists mentioned in the Chuang-tzu, T'ien Hsia P'ien. 25 Kuan, "Chuang-tzu che-hsueh p'i-p'an," op. cit., p. 16; Jen Chi-yu, "Chuang- tzu ti wei-wu-chu-i chih-chieh kuan" (" Chuang-tzu's Materialistic World View "), Chuang-tzu Che-hsueh, pp. 160-161. The article first appeared in Hsin Chien- she, No. 1, 1957. Kuan Feng seems to see the evil in early Taoist thought as stemming from such class ties. Jen Chi-yu on the other hand sees no ill effect on Chuang Tzu of his belonging to the slave-master class; he finds him realistic regarding the impossibility of reverting to the old order, not seeking escape into religion, and as taking a materialistic view of things. 26 Jen Chi-yu, "Lun Lao-tzu che-hsueh ti wei-wu-chu-i pen-chih" (" On the Materialistic Essence of Lao-tzu's Philosophy "), Lao-tzu Che-hsueh T'ao-lun Chi (Collected Discussions on Lao-tzu's Philosophy) (Peking: Chung-hua Shu-chu, 1959), p. 45.

The article constitutes a reply to Kuan Feng and Lin Yu-shih. 27 Kuan Feng and Lin Yu-shih, "Lun Lao-tzu che-hsueh t'i-hsi ti wei-hsin-chu-i pen-shih" (" On the Idealistic Essence of Lao-tzu's Philosophy "), Lao-tzu Che-hsueh, p. 227.

The essence is to be kept, the dross discarded. The fruits of the studies will then, among other things, become grist for the education of the youth.30 Thus interpretation of the early thought must be guided by the obligation to "critically inherit" that philosophical legacy. But " inheritance " is a vague word, one which must be explained in Marxist terms. Briefly stated: due to the dialectical course of history, present Chinese society contains elements of essence and dross from the past. These elements dictate the limiting conditions under which Marxism is to be applied to China. Since each country has its own tradition, Marxism must be adjusted to those traditions. A knowledge of China's legacy is of great importance in determining which elements of Marxism must be played up and which played down in China, i.e., what in present- day Chinese thought, attitudes and conduct must be overcome, and what should be preserved and built upon. Within the sphere of philosophy one must look for essence in even the most erroneous world views so as to be mindful of what is vital in the heritage. Just as Marx stood the idealist Hegel on his head, so it is possible for the Chinese to inherit the positive aspects of their own idealistic philosophies. COMMUNISTS ON CONFUCIUS It is not possible to discuss the thought of the 100 Schools Period without making some remarks about Chinese Communist interpretation of the thought of Confucius. According to Communist writers the major struggle was between materialism and idealism, and the leaders of these two opposing camps, Hsun Tzu and Mencius, had carried on divergent threads found in Confucius.31 Controversies have centred on the political and religious doctrines of Confucius, especially on the progressive or conservative nature of his conceptions of jen and li (" ritual "). Whether or not jen is viewed as largely progressive (as Fung Yu-lan views it)32 depends for the most part on whether or not the character jen (" man ") in the various phrases associated with jen (" human-heartedness ") is interpreted as denoting 30 See the reference to the article by Wang Shih-ching, "The Present Must Not be Confused with the Past," in Selections from China Mainland Magazines (SCMM) (Hong Kong: U.S. Consulate General), No. 405. The author's reference is primarily to the " classical literary legacy." 31 Yang Jung-kuo, "Lun K'ung-tzu ssu-hsiang" (" On the Thought of Confucius "), K'ung-tzu Che-hsueh, p. 396.

The conservatism is seen particularly in his advocacy of social gradations, in his opposition to formal law, in his desire to restore the Chou system, and in his calling for a stronger affection for those close by than for others. In addition, Confucius was an idealist in his epistemology, believing in inborn sagacity (which he rated over acquired knowledge) and in truths handed down in poetry, history and ritual which need no testing in social practice.35 However, even those who see him as most reactionary often agree that there are progressive aspects in his theory of jen (the reciprocity of relations, or the fact that the observances of li bound both sides). In addition, he first discovered man as an individual (" the commander of the armed forces of a state might be captured, but the will of even a common man could not be changed "), gave a moral conno- tation to the term chun-tzu or "superior man" and advocated govern- ment by men of worth.86 Finally, his condemnations of tyranny and cruelty and his call for employing the people at the proper times were progressive.87 As to Confucian religious views, for some he had a new, perhaps materialistic, conception of Heaven (" Does Heaven Speak? The four seasons pursue their courses, and all things are continually being pro- duced, but does Heaven say anything? "),88 opposed naive beliefs in spirits and advocated human effort rather than reliance on the divine. 83 Kuan and Lin, "Tsai lun K'ung-tzu," pp. 319-321. &amp;4 An Tso-chang, "Kuan-yu K'ung-tzu di 'li' ho 'jen ' ti hsueh-shuo" (" On Con- fucius's Theories of ' li' and ' jen ' "), K'ung-tzu Che-hsueh, pp. 97-98. Kuan Feng and Lin Yu-shih oppose this tendency to attribute a new content to Ii. See Kuan and Lin, "Tsai lun K'ung-tzu," pp. 321-323. By and large such men as Kuan Feng, Lin Yu-shih and Jen Chi-yu emphasise the reactionary nature of the concepts of jen and li in the thought of Confucius; Kao Heng, Chung Chao-p'eng, An Tso- chang and in some respects Fung Yu-lan stress the progressive nature. But it must be emphasised that progressive elements are often found in a largely reactionary doctrine and vice versa. 85 Fung Yu-lan, "Mao Tse-tung's On Practice and Chinese Philosophy," SCMP, No. 224. 86 Kuan Feng and Lin Yu-shih, "Lun K'ung-tzu" ("On Confucius "), K'ung-tzu Che-hsueh, p. 226.

Doesn't the phrase really mean that Heaven can speak but does not choose to speak? 39 Does Confucius not cause men to kneel in awe of Heaven's commands? The same historical fact will be cited with varying interpretations to prove either the progressive or reactionary class stand of Confucius. For example, in the State of Lu where Confucius lived was the powerful Chi family. Kung-shan Fu-jao revolted against them. If one believes that the Chi family represented the new landlord class (the Duke of Lu representing the slave-owners) and that Confucius sided with the rebels, one interprets Confucius as having the interests of the slave- owner class at heart. If one changes the variables around, the interpretation changes. In the course of the controversies over political and religious doc- trines, however, a general unanimity seems to have arisen about the progressive nature of Confucius's contributions to education (he was the first to educate students on a large scale privately, and he made no class distinction among prospective pupils), his methods of learning which reflected his practical experience (unceasingly study, and be mindful of when you know and not know something) and his work as historian and editor.40 EVALUATING Mo Tzu Mo Tzu, who lived sometime during the period 479-381 B.C., was a critic of Confucianists and a man of the people who might be expected to be viewed favourably by Chinese Communist philosophers. In fact, while most Communist critics do praise him, his case is a good example of the controversy that surrounds even the most obvious candidates for canonisation. Hou Wai-lu issued a positive evaluation of Mo Tzu, which was elaborated on by quite a few others, among them Yang Jung-kuo. According to them, Mo Tzu probably came from slave or urban craftsman stock and stood for the interests of freemen.41 His general outlook was scientific, no nonsense. A materialist in epistemology, he emphasised sense experience as the basis of knowledge and human experience as an important test of truth. His three standards for recognising truth (testimony of the senses, testimony of the ancients 39 Jen Chi-yu, " Kung-tzu Cheng-chih-shang ti pao-shou li-ch'ang ho che-hsueh-shang ti wei-hsin-chu-i " (" Confucius's Conservative Political Standpoint and Philosophical Idealism "), K'ung-tzu Che-hsueh, p. 156.

He would test the rightness or wrongness of an action by examining its actual rather than supposed effect on the people. Mo Tzu opposed this to the criterion associated with the Confucian theory of the " rectifi- cation of names," a doctrine maintaining that truth is forever fixed and can be discovered by introspection, not by experience.42 That is, when one encounters a situation one looks within to the name and eternally fixed concept associated with the name and if there is an exact correspon- dence between situation and concept, a statement using the name to describe the situation is true. The policy of " rectifying names," i.e., reverting to meanings of terms long since in disuse, was a Confucian attempt to revert to the tribal slave state, according to Yang Jung-kuo. Mo Tzu, however, held that the right way to correct social evils was to understand the trends in social change and development.43 Obviously one would see, for example, that new times require new words and meanings. Whereas Confucian principles supported the tribal aristo- cracy, many Mohist doctrines aimed at its destruction. For example, against the Confucian "human-heartedness" with its stress on prefer- ential treatment for kin, Mo Tzu set the levelling " universal love." In opposition to official preferment for aristocratic worthies, Mo Tzu advocated opening a new road for official advancement, devoid of favouritism, to those newly arisen from the slave class.44 He spoke out against the extravagance in the aristocracy which was encouraged by the Confucian concern with music and rites. Finally, he rejected the notion of Heavenly decree (t'ien ming) as a tool of those in power for deceiving the people. Mo Tzu does not fare as well with some other philosophers in China today. Again, the contest is between him and Confucius. In the 1940s, for example, Kuo Mo-jo saw Confucius as the enemy of belief in the power of an anthropomorphic Heaven and in the existence of traditional spirits. He dismissed Mo Tzu as superstitious and reactionary and made no attempts to explain away Mo Tzu's religious ideas (a typical attempt to do so would be to assert that Mo Tzu was the first to maintain that commoners as well as aristocrats became ghosts at death, hardly demon- strating Mo Tzu's non-superstitious character). According to Kuo Mo- jo, Confucius's notion of Heavenly decree was simply " necessitivism" (whatever occurs is an instance of the operation of inexorable natural laws), not fatalism. Mo Tzu was the "fatalist" because of his belief that all good fortune depends on obedience to spirits and to the rulers 42 Ibid. p. 144. 4s Ibid. p. 116. 44 Ibid. p. 136. 128</page><page sequence="11">TREATMENT OF THINKERS OF HUNDRED SCHOOLS PERIOD of the slave society.45 Kuo was not alone, and his views seem to have had other adherents in more recent times.46 MENCIUS AS SUBJECTIVE IDEALIST Mencius developed the negative ideas in Confucian thought. He is commonly held to be a subjective idealist, the direct source of whose inspiration may have come from Confucius's disciple Tseng Tzu, according to Hou Wai-lu. This idealism is seen in his belief in man's innate ability to distinguish right from wrong and in his denigration of the senses,47 leading to the conclusion that man need not exert himself to know objective reality. Through mind alone he can know human nature and Heaven. The "subjectivity" of his idealism is pinpointed in the phrase "all things are complet, within me." His conservative religious ideas centred on that of the union between Heaven and man, i.e., that man cannot be understood in isolation from Heaven with whom man has some kind of metaphysical contact, since Heaven is the source of man's innate moral tendencies (in the words of Mencius, "If one knows his own nature, he knows Heaven "). Thus the supernatural intervenes in the natural. In spite of his subjective idealism, he did maintain a positive concern with the world, in contrast with others such as Chuang Tzu, who held a similar position.48 Politically conservative, he advocated jen and i as primary instruments of rule at a time when progressive thinkers were stressing rale by law. But according to Lin Keng there surely were some positive elements in his political views, such as the statement that the " people are the most valuable thing." 49 HSUN Tzu AS MAJOR MATERIALIST Hsun Tzu is said to have inherited the progressive factors in Con- fucian thought, such as the naturalistic conception of Heaven (if one believes that Confucius had such a notion). Heaven was " naturalistic " in the sense that the term " Heaven " denoted simply natural regularities, such as regular movements of celestial bodies, regular changes of sea- sons, regular functioning of animal organs, etc. Hsun Tzu's study of Nature (Heaven) and of man's ability to influence it is certainly materialistic, according to Li Teh-yung.50 Tao is treated as objective law existing independently of man. Hsun Tzu drew on all 100 Schools 45 Kuo Mo-jo, Shih P'i-p'an Shu (Ten Critiques) (Chungking: Chung-i Ch'u-pan She, 1945), pp. 92-108. 46 For example, see the discussion of the meeting of historians of Central South Region in Kuang-ming Jih-pao, May 19, 1961, translated in SCMP, No. 2514. 47 Hou, Chung-kuo Ssu-hsiang T'ung-shih, I, p. 397. 48 Kuan, " Ch'uang-tzu che-hsueh p'i-p'an," pp. 4-5. 49 SCMM, No. 405. 50 Li, " Hsun-tzu ti ssu-hsiang," pp. 76-77. 129</page><page sequence="12">THE CHINA QUARTERLY for his inspiration, and so he also drew on the positive aspects of Taoist materialism 51 in his understanding of Heaven, i.e., the Taoist interest in understanding the regularity of change undergone by physical bodies and the elimination in Taoist doctrine of interference in the natural processes by an anthropomorphic deity. Another positive heritage from Confucius is Hsun Tzu's emphasis on study as the means of betterment and on the dissemination of textual learning.52 According to Li Teh- yung, there certainly are materialistic factors in his epistemology which assigns an important role to the senses in the acquisition of knowledge and the affirmation of the knowability of the objective world.53 Reliance on law in ruling was a progressive doctrine of the new landlord class, for it served to protect the rights of commoners and helped eliminate in- herited privileges.54 Hsun Tzu entered the progressive system by re- defining li (" ritual ") so as to include law.55 However, one should not overlook the idealistic residue in Hsun Tzu, such as his excessive glori- fication of li and i and only tacit recognition of the need for law.56 But despite some disagreement, most mainland scholars conclude that Hsun Tzu was the major materialistic and atheistic thinker of the 100 Schools Period. The materialist stream which he inherited from Kuan Chung (d. 645 B.C.) was subsequently developed by the Han materialist Wang Ch'ung (A.D. 27-c. 100). TAOISTS AND LEGALISTS: UNCERTAIN QUANTITIES Was the Taoist Lao Tzu an objective idealist or a materialist? To some Chinese Communist philosophers such as Lii Chen-yii and Yang Jung-kuo he was an idealist because Tao is an absolute spirit transcend- ing space and time, which produced all things. Tao is not a physical substance because it existed prior to things, and it is not natural law because it exists independently of the process of physical movement.57 Idealism is reflected in Lao Tzu's epistemology which denies any efficacy in sensation and experience and relies on mystic intuition.58 But others, such as Yang Hsing-shun and Jen Chi-yu, question whether Lao Tzu is really an idealist. His Tao is defined by them as a primal mass of 51 Ibid. p. 78. 52 Yang, " Lun K'ung-tzu ssu-hsiang," p. 399. 53 Li, " Hsun-tzu ti ssu-hsiang," pp. 83-85. 54 Jen Chi-yu, " Han Fei-tzu ti she-hui cheng-chih ssu-hsiang ti chi-ko wen-t'i " (" Some Questions Concerning Han Fei-tzu's Social and Political Thought"), Chung-kuo Ku-tai Che-hsueh Lun-ts'ung, p. 141.

All these doctrines are considered to denote a materialistic outlook.60 Chuang Tzu (fourth century B.C.) carried the doctrines of Lao Tzu to an extreme, and most Chinese Communist philosophers consider him a subjective idealist. He views Tao as emptiness and his total focus is introspective with no concern for the external world at all-a negativism reflecting the hopeless condition of the " sunken slave-owner" class to which he belonged.61 But others, such as Jen Chi-yu, challenge his view. To them Tao is not a spiritual void but ch'i, whose congealing and dispersal produces all things.62 This ch'i is said to constitute an objective world which exists independently of man's thought. In any case Chuang Tzu's most violent critics, such as Kuan Feng and Lin Yii-shih, see some positive factors in his views, such as his criticisms of exploitation and oppression,63 and his opposition to religious supersti- tion. Most important, all contending critics agree that there was rudi- mentary dialectical thought in these two Taoist thinkers: in the discovery of pairs of opposites (Being-Not Being, wealth-poverty, heavy- light, etc.) and in the doctrine that things transform into their opposites and that such is the nature of change.64 According to Li Teh-yung the Legalists, representing the rising landlord class, developed to new heights the materialist themes so well stated by Hsun Tzu.65 The materialist nature of Han Fei Tzu's epistemology is seen in his method of testing statements against objective facts as the only standard of verification.66 He viewed ethical precepts as tools for use by the rulers in governing the realm and showed the 59 Jen and Feng, "Lao-tzu ti che-hsueh," pp. 19-21.

And yet, it is held, one cannot ignore the erroneous views of Han Fei Tzu. The King replaced Tao as the transcendent entity, and his law was held to have some objective, universal truth.68 Han Fei Tzu was also condemned for his failure to recognise the new power of the peasantry or to deal with their problems. FINDING THE ESSENCE AND DROSS No official evaluation of the philosophical legacy has yet been issued. But certain conclusions shared by almost all scholars seem to be emerging. Among these, the most important observation is that Chinese thought even in the early period was rich in materialistic and idealistic philosophies. This gives the thought its place in the sun and in part may explain the severity of attack on those (e.g., Liu Chieh) who do not see the thought in such terms. One critic of Liu Chieh condemns his focus on the differing interpretations which scholars over the ages have lent to the notion of the " unity of man and Heaven," as the ultimate method for understanding the history of Chinese thought. By depriving his theory of the "unity of Heaven and man" of the substance of class struggles in Chinese history and that of the struggles of materialism against idealism, Mr. Liu has downgraded the history of Chinese thought, which is enriched with substance, into a history of the mysterious relations between Heaven and man.69 Clearly, then, although there is no single authoritative list of philo- sophers in the 100 Schools Period who had rudimentary materialist world views, there is unanimity that such views did exist. Kuan Chung is accepted as the founder of the materialist school. His progressive ideas stood in opposition to those of a man like Chang Chu, from whose ideas the idealistic doctrines developed.7 Materialist thinking was stimulated by the Five Element thought of the late West Chou.71 The discovery of new means of production in the Warring States Period led to the development of astronomy and other sciences which also en- couraged materialist views.

So had the Later Mohists, who eliminated the religious ideas which had caused disagreement on Mo Tzu's status. The epistemology of Hsun Tzu and the Later Mohists also was materialist, for they stressed the use of sense organs as sources of knowledge of the objective world. The Mohists viewed practice as the source of knowledge. In addition there were "materialist factors " even in basically non-materialistic thinkers, as in Confucius's develop- ment of a teaching method based on his own practical experience as a student and teacher. An important aspect of the materialistic world view is atheism, which according to Hou Wai-lu emerged concurrently with materialism towards the end of the late Chou. Tzu Ch'an (sixth century B.C. statesman) was one of the progenitors. Whether or not Confucius saw Heaven as a wilful anthropomorphic deity is debated, but his scepticism about spirits and his new focus on man is rarely contested. Lao Tzu may have con- ceived of Tao as absolute spirit, but he denied the existence of anthropomorphic gods.73 No one could question the atheism in Hsun Tzu's denial of any unity between Heaven and man and in his naturalis- tic conception of Heaven.74 Clearly, too, Han Fei Tzu denied the Heavenly Mandate. Instead he held that the people choose the king, and historical events are determined by non-theistic (e.g., economic) factors.75 Another positive legacy from the early period is a rudimentary dialectical theory which developed in the late West Chou.76 Some see it in the thought of Confucius, e.g., in the dialectical relation between native "substance" (chih) and "refinement" (wen) in the cultural sphere (a union of both being necessary in the superior man), and in the internal dialectical relations of quality and quantity (as in the proposition that " doing too much is equivalent to doing nothing at all ").77 It was 72 See Kuan Feng and Lin Yu-shih, "Lun Sung Yin hsueh-p'ai " (" On the Sung-Yin School "), Che-hsueh Yen-chiu, No. 5, 1959, pp. 28-45. The material for the study of these early Taoists comes mainly from the text Kuan Tzu, possibly first century B.C., based on earlier materials. Fung Yu-lan and Hou Wai-lu dispute this attribution of materialism to the Sung/Yin School. 73 Jen, " Lun Lao-tzu che-hsueh," pp. 33-35. 74 JPRS, No. 22, 391.

It is a key epistemological and logical law of the Later Mohists. In examining the contradictions between objective things, between two things of the same kind or between two contradictory aspects of the same thing, they occupied themselves with the mutually related states of " sameness" (t'ung) and " difference" (i), the relation being summarised as "the mutual dependency of 'sameness' and 'dif- ference '" 78 This is the "essence " in the thought of the 100 Schools Period, a rudimentary materialism, an atheism, and a rudimentary dialectics. Probably other matters could be added to the list such as Confucius's views on education and teaching method, developed to a more sophisti- cated level by Confucianists of the Warring States Period. But this essence is always mixed with dross in the early thought. One may be pleased to find rudimentary dialectical thought in Lao Tzu but then will discover that he was an idealist and that the two are contradictory. Hence the problem of removing the dross is always present. One of the most important pieces of dross discovered in the thought of the 100 Schools Period by present-day scholars in Communist China is the lack of any appreciation of the value of struggle between opposites. There was of course a struggle going on between materialism and idealism, but the thinkers themselves usually were totally unaware of the scientific value of struggle as they were of the incompatibility of opposites, which they often tried to " unite " or " harmonise." Some contemporary scholars see Confucian virtues as tools to har- monise contradictions between classes or to bring about " compromises " between other contradictory phenomena. Kuan Feng and Lin Yu-shih regard the Confucian jen in this light. Loyalty and altruism have the function of harmonising relations between rich and poor, ruler and minister, etc. The call to "love all men" has the same end.79 The doctrine of the " mean" was an attempt to justify compromises between mutually contradictory matters, such as belief in Heavenly ming and reliance on human effort.80 In addition, Confucian discussions of an abstract " human nature " were meant to cover up class contradictions. Since later representatives of the feudal rulers adopted these doctrines, the evil was long perpetuated in China. The failure to understand the nature of struggle between opposites is most clearly manifest in the rudimentary dialectical views of the early 78 Kao Heng, "Mo Ching-chung i-ko lo-chi kuei-lu-' T'ung I Chiao-te' " (" A Logical Rule in the Mohist Canon-' The Mutual Dependency of Sameness and Difference' "), Chung-kuo Ku-tai Che-hsueh Lun-ts'ung, pp. 69-70. 79 Kuan and Lin, " Lun K'ung-tzu," p. 225. 80 Ibid pp. 244-245. Also see Hou Wai-lu, A Short History of Chinese Philosophy (Peking: Foreign Languages Press, 1959), p. 6. 134</page><page sequence="17">TREATMENT OF THINKERS OF HUNDRED SCHOOLS PERIOD thinkers. This points to a unique deficiency in the Chinese legacy. In Western thought from the earliest time there was such an understanding. Heraclitus spoke of strife between opposites as essential to the coming into being of things and to ordered change. Such an idea found its way into the idealism of Hegel and thence to Marx. Kuan Feng and Lin Yu-shih hold that dialectics and idealistic philo- sophies are basically contradictory, for dialectics means constant de- velopment through the clash of opposites, while in an idealism such as that of Lao Tzu all opposition disappears in the Absolute. There is no development and change in Tao through the clash of opposites.81 A host of modern commentators offer variations on the interpretation that Lao Tzu's dialectic seeks to eliminate all struggle between oppo- sites.82 Chuang Tzu is said to carry the denial of struggle even farther to the point of seeming to deny the existence of opposites. His dialectics become an attempt to avoid contradictions.83 He preferred to take a middle position between opposites (e.g., between good and bad, strength and weakness) as an expedient means for preserving life.84 Or he would make a "head in the sand " escape from conflict by "transcending" it with a flight into " absolute freedom " or " pure experience." 85 Not only Taoistic dialectical theories lack an understanding of struggle. The dialectics of the Mohist school are restricted to explain- ing the contradictions between phenomena and to elaborating on a logical rule for analysing them. There is no conception of struggle between opposites resulting in development.86 The Chinese tendency to avoid struggle or to seek some compromise is not a new discovery of the Chinese Communists. It was recognised by certain figures connected with the cultural readjustment associated with the May 4th Movement of 1917-21. For example, in a joint statement, Hu Shih, pupil of John Dewey and proselytiser of pragmatism in China, and Ch'en Tu-hsiu, one of the founders of the Chinese Communist Party, said: The old literature, old politics and old ethics have always belonged to one family; we cannot abandon one and preserve the others. It is Oriental to compromise and only go halfway when reforming, for fear s8 Kuan and Lin, "Lun Lao-tzu che-hsueh," pp. 206-208. Lu Chen-yu takes a similar position. 82 e.g., see Fung, "Lao-tzu ti che-hsueh," p. 11, and Lu Chen-yu, Chung-kuo Cheng- chih Ssu-hsiang Shih (History of Chinese Political Thought) (Peking: Jen-min Ch'u-pan She, 1961), pp. 57-59; Yang, "Kuan-yu 'Wu-ch'ien Yen '," p. 297. 83 Jen, "Chuang-tzu ti wei-wu-chu-i," p. 171. 84 Fung Yu-lan, " Lun Chuang-tzu (" On Chuang-tzu "), Chuang-tzu Che-hsueh, p. 126.

This was the most important factor behind the failures of reform movements during the last several decades.87 But the negative aspects of China's philosophical legacy have left special problems for the Chinese leadership which is eager both to pro- mote a politically conscious populace and to rid the country of the ideological dross of the past. These special problems are recognised by philosophers observing their own countrymen. In their eyes, early attempts to transcend conflict by entering the realm of "absolute freedom" where all problems disappear have their counterpart today in the " Ah Q " spirit 88 of so many Chinese who try to rationalise problems away.89 The Taoist preference for taking a mean position between opposites is seen today in "middle-of-the-roadism," by which people hope to avoid the possibility of making a mistake.90 The attempt to deny opposites was handed down from the early period to the present by feudal rulers who found it a useful tool for drugging the people; those who believe there is no difference between life and death, between getting and losing, will not struggle to achieve the former.91 Liu Chieh, whose ideas are derived from Mencius and the Ch'en-Chu school, states that man must not take part in "wild and wrong acts" which may injure Heaven and damage reason, but must strive to recover his heavenly nature.92 In other words, man's task is to devote himself to internal examination and avoid struggle. The concern over the negative legacy takes concrete form in the attacks on scholars suspected of perpetuating the dross of the past with an overlay of Marxist terminology. Liu Chieh was one victim and the the contemporary popular philosopher Feng Ting was another. Like his predecessors in the old China, Feng Ting has been interested in studies of "human nature," in discovering what is common to all men. He takes biology as his point of departure and focuses on those environ- mental factors biologically favourable to the human species and the "instincts" common to all men. His "error" lies in attempting to obliterate class boundaries and reconcile class contradictions by seeking to derive an abstract human nature through biology.93 The most recent manifestation of concern about the negative legacy is the polemic 87 Hsin Ch'ing-nien (New Youth), Vol. V, 4 (October 15, 1918), quoted in Chow Tse- tsung, The May Fourth Movement (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1960), p. 289. 88 Ah Q is the central character in "The True Story of Ah Q," by Lu Hsun (Chou Shu-jen, 1881-1936). He claims " spiritual victories" when beaten and beats those weaker than himself when he can. He was a symbol of a national defect, manifested most clearly in China's behaviour towards the other nations which threatened her. 89 Kuan, " Chuang-tzu che-hsueh p'i-p'an," pp. 4-5. 90 Fung, "Lun Chuang-tzu," p. 126. 91 Ibid. 92 JPRS, No. 22, 391. 93 Kuang-ming Jih-pao, November 10, 1964. 136</page><page sequence="19">TREATMENT OF THINKERS OF HUNDRED SCHOOLS PERIOD surrounding Yang Hsien-chen, elderly philosopher at the Higher Party School of the Party Central Committee who has been under attack since the spring of 1964. In discussing dialectics Yang had talked of "the combination of two into one," a process with roots in early Chinese dis- cussions of the unity of opposites. Yang was accused of opposing dialectical materialism because "emphasising combining two into one" instead of " dividing one into two " was said to be equivalent to stressing compromise rather than struggle.94 Two reasons, one international and one domestic, stand out among the main causes for the focus on struggle today. One is the tendency which the Chinese see in the doctrines and policies of the Soviet and Yugoslav "modern revisionists" to soften the relationship between capitalist and socialist countries (ideas such as " the nature of capitalism has changed," "peaceful road to socialism in imperialist countries," etc.). What is the "peaceful co-existence" of the revisionists but a policy of compromise (with capitalism)? The Chinese see their historic role as opposing a new version of the revisionism that appeared in the doctrines of men like Edward Bernstein during a similar crisis in the Marxist camp at the turn of the century.95 The other reason is the fear of resurgent capitalism in China (demand for more private markets, for private enterprise, etc.) and other bourgeois tendencies indicating the continued presence of anti-regime voices and the consequent need to keep the pressure up.96 CONCLUSIONS The best way to evaluate from a Western standpoint the work done by scholars in China is briefly to compare the kinds of questions with which 94 Numerous articles appeared on the matter in the Press. See, for example, People's Daily, July 17 and 19 and August 14 and 31, 1964. Also China News Analysis (Hong Kong), No. 535. 95 The doctrines of Edward Bernstein (1850-1932), advocating peaceful parliamentary means for attaining the workers' goals and socialism, were attacked by Lenin. Lenin stressed class struggle and proletarian dictatorship. 96 A Hung Ch'i (Red Flag) editorial has this to say about compromise: " Moreover, the modem revisionists give voice to pure inventions such as that the revolutionary Marxist-Leninists, whom they call ' dogmatists,' ' reject' certain necessary com- promises. We would like to tell these modern revisionists that no serious-minded Marxist-Leninist rejects compromises indiscriminately. In the course of our protracted revolutionary struggle, we Chinese Communists had reached compromises on many occasions with our enemies, internal and external. For example, we came to a compromise with the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek clique. We came to a compromise, too, with the U.S. imperialists, in the struggle to aid Korea and resist U.S. aggression. For Marxist-Leninists, the question is what kind of a compromise to arrive at, the nature of the compromise, and home to bring about a compromise. ... It is precisely in accordance with Lenin's teaching that we Chinese Communists distinguish between different kinds of compromise, favouring compromises which are in the interests of the people's cause and of world peace, and opposing compromises that are in the nature of treachery. It is perfectly clear that only those guilty now of adventurism, now of capitulation, are the ones whose ideology is Trotskyism, or Trotskyism in a new guise ": Red Flag, No. 1, 1963, reprinted as Leninism and Modern Revisionism (Peking: Foreign Languages Press, 1963), pp. 9-10. 137</page><page sequence="20">THE CHINA QUARTERLY they are concerned and those deemed important by scholars outside of China. Among the topics selected for study by Chinese scholars probably only one would rank among the subjects generally selected for study by Westerners-i.e., the annotation and dating of texts and related philo- logical studies. Chinese philological studies are of special interest to all concerned with the period. Among the especially impressive works are Kuan Feng's Chuang Tzu Nei-p'ien 1-chieh ho P'i-p'an (Interpretation and Critique of the Chuang Tzu Nei-p'ien),97 Ku Chieh-kang's explica- tion of a chapter of the classic The Book of History, in Li-shih Yen-chiu (Historical Research),9" and articles in Wen-shih (Literature and History). Actually, the individual scholar in China working with materials of the 100 Schools Period might very well have two counterparts in the West, one person whose interest is primarily textual and the other whose interests are in philosophy (or the history of philosophy). While many questions asked by the Westerner interested in textual matters would overlap with those asked by the Chinese, a significant portion of this work reflects a Marxist orientation. There seems to be an excessive con- cern with etymological studies of words in the early texts relevant to social class. For example, terms such as "man" (jen) and "people" (min) seem to be favourite choices for close study. The thesis of Chao Chi-pin 99 that jen denoted members of the slave-master class and min members of the slave class seems to be widely accepted. Not only philo- logists but philosophers and historians in Communist China have been studying such terms for some time. Ch'en Meng-chia has made ex- tensive studies of the terms jen, chung-jen, chung, shu jen, etc., in his attempt to isolate the terms denoting members of the ruling and ruled class in early China.100 Kuo Mo-jo has laboured over the term chung. The form of the Shang bone graph (representing three men toiling under the sun according to Kuo) plus the existence of phrases such as "the king goes to repress the disorders of the chung" and " so-and-so many chung ran away" supplement the existence of headless corpses in royal 97 (Peking: Chung-hua Shu-chu, 1961.) 98 e.g., Ku Chieh-kang, " Shang-shu 'Ta Kao' Chin shih " (" Modern Explanation of the Ta Kao Chapter of The Book of History "), Li-shih Yen-chiu, No. 4, 1962, pp. 26-51. 99 In the chapter "Shih ' jen' ' min '" ("Explaining ' jen ' and 'min'"), in Chao Chi-pin, Lun-yu Hsin T'an (A New Study of the Analects) (Peking: Jen-min Ch'u-pan She, 1962). 100 Ch'en Meng-chia, Yin-hsu Pu-tz'u Tsung-shu (An Account of the Oracle Bone Graphs from the Yin Wastes) (Peking: K'o-hsueh Ch'u-pan She, 1956), pp. 610-616 and 640.

Much of the praise of the early thinkers for their "progressive" educational ideas or " embryonic dialectics" seems downright silly to the Westerner who measures the importance of a philosopher not necessarily in terms of the social consequences or " modern sound" of his ideas but in terms of how well he argued for them. Due to the limitations of Marxist categories of classification, the Chinese philosopher suffers from the standard Marxist ailment of forced and often artificial attempts to fit all philosophers into the two categories of materialism and idealism (Kuan Feng is an occasional exception to this). Western philosophers are not always attracted to labels and cer- tainly balk at being reduced to two of them if they are going to be used. The Western philosopher working with the early Chinese materials would ask questions in categories roughly corresponding to the branches of Western philosophy. For example, because much of the thought of the 100 Schools Period is concerned with political philosophy he would be interested in the answers to such questions standard in the field as: Why should men submit to governmental authority? (self- interest? public-interest? both? will of God?). In whose hands should the political power be? (those whom the individual or majority "con- sents " to obey? the " wise "?). How can the limits of political power be determined, or are there individual rights, duties or freedoms outside of the jurisdiction of governmental control? What are the ends of government? Answers to these questions can certainly be found in the early Chinese works even though the questions as phrased may not be tradi- tional ones. Considerations pertinent to the answers in many cases are common to both Western and Chinese thought (e.g., the problem of the "equality" of men which arises in discussions of the locus of political power). Traditional factors do linger on in the Chinese Communist approach to the early thought. Such might be the preoccupation with a limited number of passages, many of which were also of primary concern to the Neo-Confucianists. The condemnations of Chuang Tzu for his " selfish- ness" are traditional-dating from the Sung attacks on Buddhism and 101 There is a nice summary of the arguments in Ch'i Ta, "Chia-ku-wen-chung ti 'chung' shih-pu-shih nu-li " (" Does the Oracle Bone Graph ' chung' Denote a Slave?"), Hsueh-shu Yueh-k'an (Academic Monthly), No. 1 (1957), p. 18. 139</page><page sequence="22">THE CHINA QUARTERLY Taoism.l02 But certainly no one should underestimate the extent to which the Chinese Marxists are trying to re-focus the reader's attention onto matters which have hitherto rarely (and perhaps with good reason) been studied. An example is the emphasis on the epistemology of the thinkers of the 100 Schools Period (Fung Yu-lan and Kuan Feng are occasionally free from this criticism). Epistemology even in the West became a major concern only with Descartes, though to look at the space allotted to it one would think the early Chinese writers were deeply interested in the matter. Obviously one explanation in this case is the Chinese Communist concern with the relationship between "thought" and "existence " (the " number one philosophical problem " in Marxist eyes)-of special importance to a country desiring to show how "thought" (the heightened consciousness of the masses) can work miracles on "existence " (the objective world). It is true that questions which scholars outside of China consider fundamental have gone unanswered on the mainland. But the answers to some questions being considered are of interest to scholars in the field everywhere. For example, the range of possible relationships between Tao, the laws of change, and ch'i seems to be narrowing considerably. Matters of ontological or epistemological interest may be brought to light even when the questions guiding the inquiry are not important from the outsider's point of view. In short, it would be naive not to look for some very positive advances in our understanding of the thought of the 100 Schools Period to emerge from studies whose approach is dictated by dialectical materialism. 102 Yang Jung-kuo, "Chuang-tzu Ssu-hsiang t'an-wei" ("A Close Examination of Chuang-tzu's Thought "), Chuang-tzu Che-hsueh, pp. 289 and 291.
