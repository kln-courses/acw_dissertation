Simon Introduction Tyagardja is most often celebrated as South India's greatest classical'2 composer. Not enough has been written, however, about the great religious-musical tradition, Bhajana Sampradaya and Tyagaraja's place in it. My intent in this article is to present a glimpse of the 1400-year continuity of sainted, singing poets, especially those who have been most influential in Tyagaraja's life, and to show Tyagaraja's place in that continuous tradition. My intent also is to show how Tyagaraja was born in a place and at a time when the present orthodox southern Bhajana Paddhati (composition of the bhajana ritual) was being shaped, how he was influenced by the leaders, and how he became one of the most important contributors to it. It has long been known in India that one learns not by instruction so much as by imitation. The learning process is one in which the vehicle is emulation of those whom one respects and admires the most. The veneration felt for one's parents, guru, and other saints is bound up in a system which requires that those on the highest social levels be the most responsible and demonstrate by their examples the highest ideals of Indian thought and behavior. The profound love felt for Tyagaraja is due, in part. to his extraordinary music; but also because of his messages of bhakti (see note 1.) expressed in song, and importantly, his exemplary life spent in devotion to Sri Rama. For Tyagaraja, music was the means for expressing his deepest spirituality; each of his compositions is an act of worship. In virtually every facet of his life, music was his conveyance for God-realization. In each of his some 800 works as well as in his daily life he was the living embodiment of India's highest ideals. Tyagaraja was born in Tiruvarur, Thanjavur, district of Tamilnadu. His was a traditional Telegu brahman family which had originated in Andhra. He was raised in the traditional way, and at an early age learned from his father to perform the daily rituals which in</page><page sequence="2">Simon: TyNgarNja and Bhajana Sampradaya 115 his household included the Sahasra Nama Stotra as well as the other traditional rituals. The focus of his life was Rama bhakti; this is understandable, since Rama bhakti was widespread in Andhra due in part to the influence of some of South India's most inspiring singing poet-saints who were from that area. It is said that Tyagaraja's mother sang songs of Badracala Ramadas to him from early infancy. As an adult Tyagaraja spent his days meditating on Rama and chanting His name; in his krit7 and kirtana he worshipped Rama. Popular representations current today depict him holding the tamboura (classical drone instrument, also often used in bhajana rituals) in one hand, and in the other, the chipla (pair of wooden clappers), which is the rhythm instrument of the bhakta (devotees). In some pictures the tamboura is excluded, but still he grasps the chipla of the devotee Nama Siddhanta, the Embodiment of Bhakti Tyagaraja and other bhakta of the Bhajana Sampradaya were practitioners of Nama Siddhanta, the school of thought in which one adores the Lord's name and its repetition. Worship of the Divine Name is at the central core of bhakti worship. Adherents of this path believe that the repetition of the Divine Name or listening to its repetition is the most efficacious means for achieving union with the deity. Rituals can be performed alone in one's solitude or in congregation with others. When performed alone, it often takes the form of Nama Japa (japa, to mutter to oneself), practiced by repeating a single name, such as Rama or Siva. According to tradition, Tyagaraja repeated Rama's name several thousand times each day. He believed that constant repetition of Rama Nama transforms the name itself into a glorious form filling the heart with love. (Raghavan 1966A: 110). Congregational rituals are conducted virtually entirely in song. Some songs extol the glories of God; others, called Namavali, are mintra consisting of repetitions of God's names and attributes. The primary source in which are prescribed the forms or attitudes of devotion in the bhakti approach to God is the Bhagavata Purana. Here we find the stories and ideas that provide the foundations for the forms bhakti has taken. The following is a list of the attitudes attributed to legendary Narada, the divine sage and musician, and his disciple Prahlada, which forms the source for most of the symbolic acts performed in the</page><page sequence="3">116 Asian Music, Fall/Winter 1988/89 bhajana ritual, and which also constitutes virtually all of the thematic material in Tyagaraja's song texts. The attitudes listed are symbolic of the total of all levels and kinds of feelings of love that we as humans can feel for one another, as well as for an anthropomorphic deity: I. Sravana: listening to the glories of God. 2. Kirtana: singing the glories of God 3. Smarapa: constant meditating upon God. 4. Padasevana. worshipping at the Lord's feet. 5. Arcapa: daily worship of the Lord. 6. Vandana- paying obeisance to the Lord. 7. Dasya: approaching God feeling as His servant. 8. Sakya: worshipping God as a friend. 9. Atma-nivedana: complete self-surrender to God as one's own. 10. Vatsalya: love for God as a small child. 11. Tanmayata: love for God as the beloved husband, and viraha, suffering on being separated from one's beloved. According to tradition, it is believed that even by emphasizing only one of the eleven forms a devotee can come close to God. Tyagaraja, in his song texts, addressed God in all of the above prescribed forms. In this he was a direct descendent of the great singing poet-saints who have appeared during the past 1400 years in every corner of India. Antecedents of the Southern Bhajana Sampradaya Just as music is generally the most powerful vehicle for worship among the world's peoples on all levels of culture, so too, do we find music important in Indian popular religion, bhakti. Devotion through song is thought to be the single most potent means for achieving the desired goal. This is born out by the fact that since the first outpourings of bhakti, the spiritual messages were conveyed by fervent devotional songs. Those who created them were god-filled poet-composers, worshippers of Siva and ViSru. India's greatest composers have been those sainted men and women who advanced bhakti through their poetry and music. The role of the sainted singing poets has been crucial in the bhakti tradition. It was they, beginning in the sixth century, C.E., who</page><page sequence="4">Simon: Tyfgar&amp;ja and Bhajana Sampradaya 117 through their passionate devotion, stopped encroaching Buddhism from engulfing all of India. Although bhakti, as an approach to God can be traced back to the earliest vedas, bhakti as an organized religious movement has its roots in sixth century Tamilnadu. It began partly as a reaction against atheistic Buddhism and its refusal to acknowledge the existence of the soul. Also, there was a generally strong need to have a mystical relationship with the deity. Equally important, the Buddhists denied the authority of the vedas. The rise of bhakti coincided with the establishment of the southern Pallava Empire centered in Kdiicipuram. Kings who had been converted to Buddhism and Jainism were converted back to the orthodoxy by fervent poet-singers, and in turn aided in the promulgation of the faith. They financed the new temples (housing deities associated with Siva or Visnu) in and around which the religious activities were centered. All of the arts, architecture, sculpture, painting, music, and literature flourished, focusing on the idea of loving surrender to "the Lord of all" (Kingsbury and Phillips 1921:57). An important feature of the new bhakti cult was the use of the vernacular languages in song texts instead of the traditional Sanskrit. This was due, in part, to the fact that not all of the poet-singers were learned in Sanskrit, the study of which was reserved for a small minority of upper castes. Also, the bhakti movement involved society in general, the caste spectrum of which reached from priest to pariah, and included Muslims. Use of vernacular languages guaranteed the inclusion of all in the movement. This is not to say Sanskrit does not comprise a large portion of bhakti song texts which indeed it does; however, one of the hallmarks of the bhakti tradition is the use of vernacular languages. Tyagardja was intimate with the works of the early saints of Tamilnadu: the Tevaram, comprising the songs of the Nayanar (Shivite) saints and the Natajira Divyaprabandham., the sacred song collection of the Alvars (Vaisnavites). Andal, one of the Alvars, was said to have been absorbed bodily into the Lord. It was she who composed the Tirup9vai, a long poem of thirty stanzas; the practice of singing one stanza each night during the holy month of Margall.still continues in Vaisnava temples. The Hindu revival which had begun in the South eventually spread to other vernacular regions, moving first to the North and West, and eventually engulfing all of India. In studying the southern Bhajana Sampradaya, we find that a movement which began in the</page><page sequence="5">118 Asian Music, Fall/Winter 1988/89 South and which spread in every direction, continually returned to the South in the form of ideas and songs. Contributions of great singing- poets from every part of the land became accretions to the southern ritual. Because of these rich additions, the songs of the southern ritual are not only sung in Tamil, but also in Telegu, Kannada, Mars thi, and Hindi, as well as Sanskrit. The first area outside of Tamil country to be affected by the bhakti upsurge was Kannada-speaking Karnataka.(Raghavan 1966 B:24). Here, two groups emerged sometime in the I lth-12th century, that reflected the earlier Nayanar and Alvar movements in the South: the Virasiavas, also called Lingayats, worshipped Siva, and the Haridasas were devotees of Visou. The Hariddsas, in particular, are important because Purandaradasa (ca. 1489 to 1564), a Haridasa, was a direct influence on Tyagaraja as a model for his spiritual life; Purandaradasa was an uncavritti, 3 one who dedicated his life to God. Tyagaraja was also influenced musically by Purandaradasa. William Jackson cites several examples in his excellent article (Jackson 1982:88). Also, Purandaradasa was the link between Lord Panduranga (Visru)4 of Pandharpur (a small town in Maharartra) and the southern bhajana orthodoxy which began to take shape at that time. Panduranga and his bhakta Pundarika are still prominent in the southern bhajana orthodoxy which began to take shape at that time. Panduranga and his bhakta Pundarika are still prominent in the southern Bhajana Paddhati. The name for one of the song forms, pundarTkam, important in the southern ritual, comes from Panduranga's famous bhakta. Marathi bhakti can be traced back to the 13th century. (Deleury 1960: 224). The establishment of the Marathi language came about during this period partly by way of the devotional songs of the poet-singers. Jnfanadeva (ca. 1275-1296) founded the tradition of Maratha poet-singers whose songs were addressed to Panduranga. Following Jfianadeva there was a plethora of saints, members of the Varkari-sect, all devotees of Panduranga. Tukaram (1598-1650), like Jijanadeva, is revered in MahdrdStra as one of the two greatest of the poet-singers. Unlike Ji'anadeva who was a brahman, Tukdrdm was a merchant of the ?udra (peasant) caste. The strong Maratha influence on the southern bhajana was partly due to Purandaradasa's presence on the scene. Another significant influence was the result of the Mar.tha occupation of</page><page sequence="6">Simon: Tyfgaraja and Bhajana Sampraddya 119 southern India from the middle of the 17th century until the 19th century, their seat of power centered in Thanjavur. It was during this period that the Bhajana Paddhati realized its present shape. The Marathas, who carried the songs of Tukaram to Thanjavur also brought the songs of Samartha Ramdas (1608-1680). Ramdas, in addition to being a religious leader, was closely associated with the Maratha king, Sivaji. Ramdas traveled to Thanjavur where he established matha (places for religious activities), and where Samartha Ramdas bhajana are still performed today. The devotional songs of Tukaram and Ramdas are also included in the southern Bhajana Paddhati.. As indicated above, saints who set their fervent devotional poems to music have appeared in every part of India singing of their love for God. Even during the crest of the Muslim domination in the 16th and 17th centuries, when there was an overwhelming pressure to either embrace Allah or perish, the bhakti tradition not only continued, but was strengthened. This was partly due to an acculturation process in which certain Islamic elements were absorbed into Hindu bhakti. The Muslim elements were part of a tradition of Muslim mysticism, S$fism. Sofis had been in India since the 12th century, and had much in common with Hindus, as do mystics everywhere. Singing and dancing were essential parts of their worship. Like the Hindus, as well as other mystics in the world, they sought direct and immediate experience with God. The Hindi saint Kabir, who lived in the first half of the 15th century (Vaudeville 1974:39), represents a fusion of both Hindu and Muslim ideas. Above all, he was a passionate devotee who perceived God as the supreme object of love, and who saw Him as his teacher and bridegroom. Kabir is a favorite bhakta in the South; his songs are included in the Bhajana Paddhati as are those of Mirabai (ca. 1498-ca. 1563) (Goetz 1966:6). Mirabai was a Rajasthani princess who gave up her husband as well as all of her possessions to become an uncavritti, going about singing love-filled songs to her bridegroom, Lord Kr$ra. Mira, more than any other poet-singer, has captured and held the hearts of Indians in every part of the sub-continent. Little is known definitely about her life. Also, unlike Kabir whose works are well- documented, most, if not all songs attributed to her may be spurious. The northeastern areas of Bengal, Assam, and Manipur did not remain unaffected by the surge of religious devotion engulfing India.</page><page sequence="7">120 Asian Music, Fall/Winter 1988/89 Vidyapati, Cauridas, Ramprasad, and Sankaradeva among others went about singing their God-intoxicated songs. In the 12th century, most notably, Jayadeva sang his immortal G-ta Govinda which has been so influential in every part of India. His passionate Vaisnava love songs on the theme of the Radhs-Krsira LTla are at the center of the southern Bhajana Paddhati. The Bengali religious leader, Caitanya (ca. 1486-1533), although not a poet-singer, was a powerful influence and is credited with having introduced dance in religious rituals during his sojourn to southern India. (There is some dispute about this, which is discussed below.) The Shaping of the Southern Bhajana Paddhati The second half of the 16th and the first half of the 17th centuries saw the formation of the present-day bhajana ritual paddha ti. This task was begun by a family consisting of three generations of poet-singers from the village of Tallapakam whose activities were centered in Tirupati (in southeastern Andhra Pradesh) at the Venkateswara temple. The only dates available for the three are those of Tallapakam Annamacarya, the grandfather, whose only date which is somewhat agreed upon is his death in 1503. The dates of his son, Tallapakam Tirumalacarya, and grandson, Tallapakam Cinnaiya, are not forthcoming. Estimates would place Tirumalacarya sometime around the middle of the 16th century, Cinnaiya in the fourth quarter of that century. Little is documented about Tirumalaca rya; most information available is on works of the oldest, Annamaca rya, and the youngest, Cinnaiya. Annamacarya's importance lies in the fact that he initiated many of the conventions that developed into the Bhajana Sampradaya. It was Annamacarya who first codified the southern Bhajana Paddhati. He is credited with having established musical forms that continue to be in present use: the terms, pallavi, anupallavi, carana, and citta swara have been attributed to him. (Isaac N.D.:11). Professor Isaac mentions that Annamacarya "sang and danced before the Lord." (Isaac:Ibid.) This would probably pre-date Caitanya's visit to South India ca. 1510. (Sarkar 1913:76-7). One of the most venerated names in South Indian religious music is Cinnaiya, who composed a large quantity of devotional music. With his grandfather, he is credited with having systematized the present orthodox Bhajana Paddhati. The bhajana ritual in South India</page><page sequence="8">Simon: Tyagarfja and Bhajana Sampradfya 121 commences with the singing of Cinnaiya's Todfya Mangalam, in which the worshippers sing "Hail, Victory to the Lord," ("Jaya, Jaya"). Also included in the ritual are Cinnaiya's songs sung while worshipping with offerings of incense (dupa), light (dipa), and food (naivedya). He also composed songs for Vasantotsava (Spring Festival), when special annual bhajana rituals are performed. Also, the order of songs performed in the last section of the bhajana ritual, in which the deity is retired for the night, was set by Cinnaiya. Lastly, he set the HeccarTka, the song used in processions, in which the coming of the deity is announced. Several sainted poet-singers have contributed to the structure of the present orthodox Bhajana Paddhati, including Tyagaraja; it was the Tallapakam composers who first set the ritual forms which were followed later. More than that, the tradition of worshipping Rama in song and ritual can be traced back to Annamacarya. (Raghavan 1968:104). It is Annamacarya whose imprint is on the cult of Rama which reached its apex with Tyagaraja in the 19th century. The next most important Telegu-speaking poet-singer to come upon the scene was Bhadracala Ramadas, whose activities were centered in the town of Bhadracala in Andhra Pradesh. A consensus of speculation places him probably in the second half of the 17th century. According to traditional accounts, Ramadas lived as an uncavritti (Apparao 1957:2). He owned little, depending on the devout for his daily sustenance and living his life in worship, mostly through song. B. Ramadas was influential by way of his songs, and a driving force in establishing Rama mandira (places where devotees of a given sect meet in order to worship together). Bhajana rituals in the name of Rama are featured in these mandira. Every village and town in Andhra eventually had established mandira and other meeting places where the songs to Rama were sung in bhajana rituals. Apparao traces Tyagaraja's earliest influences to songs of B. Ramadas sung to him as a child by his mother, as mentioned earlier in this article. B. Ramadas, like Tyagaraja, was an adherent of the Rama Nama Siddha nta. B. Ramadas bhajana rituals continue to be performed in Tamilnadu (especially in Madras) today as they are in every part of Andhra. The formation of the Bhajana Paddhati in South India was affected in a crucial way by the appearance in the Thanjavur district of three men. They are looked to as the bhajana guru, who, because</page><page sequence="9">122 Asian Music, Fall/Winter 1988/89 of their leadership sparked the southern bhakti revival in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. All three were Advaitins (monists), followers of Sankara. They wrote treatises and devotional songs based on Advaitin doctrines in which the efficacy of repeating the Divine Names of the Lord was expanded. As Smarta they were eclectic in their choices of deities; Saivite as well as Vaisnavite gods were suitable objects for worship. The two earliest, Saddiva Brahmendra (known as Bodhendra) and Sridhara Venkatesa (known as Ayyaval) lived during the late 17th early 18th centuries. The third, Sadguruswami (also called Venkatarama), was a younger contemporary who spent his life continuing the works of the two older men. It was he who is credited with having codified the Bhajana Paddhati. Each gave impetus to the cult through their philosophical writings and devotional music compositions. In addition, they established the prototype Matha which were open to priests and laymen alike for Nama Sankirtana (worship in song). Tyagaraja, who appeared later in the century, was caught up in the movement inspired by the three gurus. Songs venerating them are sung today at the beginning of bhajana rituals as well as following the Todayamagalam section, when the Guru Dhyana songs are sung in praise of the three gurus. Narayana Tirtha, a Telegu-speaking sannyasin from Tirupati settled in the Thanjavur district in the late 17th century. He is revered in Tamilnadu as one of those saints who contributed to the literature of the Bhajana Sampradaya. His most important work is the Sanskrit dance drama K-spa Lila Tarangini, composed in twelve cantos called taranga. Each taranga is on a theme relating to an event in KrxSa's life. There appears to be a connection between this work and Jayadeva's G/ta Govinda, not only in thematic material, but also in structure; both are comprised of twelve cantos. Taranga are performed regularly as integral parts of the Bhajana Paddhati. Another who had an impact on Tyagaraja was an elder contemporary known as UpaniSad Brahma Yogin (a name given him because of his commentaries on the 108 UpaniSads). He flourished sometime in the middle and latter part of the 18th century. UpaniSad Brahma wrote several philosophical works, including writings on Rama bhakti as well as Nama Siddhanta. He participated in musical bhajana and is credited with having composed a sizeable body of devotional music. V. Raghavan has traced the influence of some of Upanitad Brahman's song texts to works of Tyagaraja. (Raghavan 1956:114)</page><page sequence="10">Simon: Tyagaraja and Bhajana Sampradfya 123 Tyagaraja's Impact on the Bhajana Sampradaya Tyagaraja, in addition to his enormous contributions to Karnatak (so-called art) music, composed a large body of music which is performed in contemporary bhajana rituals. Indeed, the amount of music he composed which is still being performed is second only to the Tallapakam composers. His songs are remarkably well- suited to the usually limited musical abilities of most bhajana congregations. The songs are composed in familiar rtga, the rhythmic and metrical styles are simple. Drum accompaniments are simple enough so that those with only limited musical backgrounds are able to play. One often sees the mrdangam or dholak, the most commonly used drums, played by a teenaged student. The kirtana were composed so that the pallavi, that is, the refrains, are simple enough for the limited musicianship of most congregation members, while the caranam are more challenging for those few who are able to perform them. The most widely known of Tyagaraja's songs composed for the bhajana ritual is the collection called Divyandma Sankirtanas (lamp bhajana). These were composed originally for inclusion in the symbolic Kalyana (wedding) of Radha-Kr~r)a, Sita-Rama, or Siva- Parvati, i.e., the individual human soul represented by the female, becoming unified with the divine. 5 We find Radha-Kryr)a Kalyana, especially, performed annually in Madras and other places in southern India. The ritual is performed daily in Venkateswara temple in Tirupati. Somehow these songs have found their way to the Bhajana Paddhati, and are regularly performed at the beginning of the second half of the ritual, called Divyanama Sankirtana. This section of the ritual is particularly delightful to bhakta because it is the time when the Krsr)a Lila are acted out. A lighted lamp is placed, standing somewhere near the center of the room; this symbolizes Krsna. The bhakta, symbolizing the Gopis, perform the circular dance Rasa Krida around the Lord. Following this, they pick up pairs of percussion sticks, and while beating the sticks together individually and with one another, they do the Kolatt~m dance around the lamp. The melodies are uncomplicated, the rhythms simple, the meters regular and elementary--simple enough to accommodate the congregation's limited musical and dance abilities. The puja (worshipful offerings) section of the Bhajana Paddhati consists of a total of 26 upactra (offerings, attentions, worshipful</page><page sequence="11">124 Asian Music, Fall/Winter 1988/89 acts) performed before and to the image of the deity who is conceived of as being a visiting royal guest who has travelled a long distance. Seldom are all 26 upacara performed; usually only 16 that are considered the most important are actually included in the regular rituals. Tyagaraja composed the Kirtana for these 16. All are not always performed at every rite. They are, however, an important inclusion since the puja is at the heart of the Bhajana Paddhati. The concluding section of the evening bhajana is called Dholotsava (Festival of the Swing) or Syanotsava (syana means bed). It is the segment of the ritual in which the personalized deity is prepared for and, with his consort, put to bed. This is done between 10:00 p.m. and midnight, as in the temples. The bed of feathers is usually mounted on a frame so that it may be rocked, hence the word dhola, which means swing. The Tallapakam saints composed several songs for this section of the ceremony, but those in common use today are by Tyagaraja. He titled his collection Utsava Sampradgya Kirtana. They are in Telegu, addressed to God as Rama, lauding his beauty, power and virtues, and offering him betel leaves and scented nuts before bedtime. The final Utsava Sampradaya Kirtana is a lullaby titled 'Jo, Jo, Jo Rama," in which as an infant is patted for reassurance, symbolically the infant Rama is patted and sung to sleep. Conclusion Bhakti is a long tradition reaching back to ancient times; references to bhakti as an attitude toward the deity can be found in the Rig Veda. The roots of bhakti, as a formalized approach, can be traced back to Pallava times in Tamil country. It was there, in the sixth century C.E., that the sainted singing-poets first began to pour out their passionate hymns of adoration to Siva and ViSnu. Music has traditionally been the primary vehicle for the bhakti approach to union with the deity. It is this religious-musical movement which has spawned India's most influential poet-composers. Tyagaraja, in adding his musical-poetical outpourings, is an important link in the long continuity; he is seen by many in the South as a giant, towering over all others. His is a unique blend of music and poetry well-suited to each other. In addition to augmenting and enriching the South Indian Bhajana Sampradaya, Tyagaraja has succeeded in enriching the lives of all who are fortunate enough to experience his music. His was a life and spirit that exemplified India's highest ideals.</page><page sequence="12">Simon: TyfgarfJa and Bhajana Sampradaya 125 Notes 1 Sampradaya means tradition. The Sanskrit words bhajana and bhakti are both derived from the root word bhaj, which means to adore, to worship. Bhakti is an approach to the deity through expressions of loving adoration. Bhajana is used in two ways: as a song which expresses bhakti and as a mystical, religious ritual in which the deity, in songs and symbolic acts, is worshipped by his/her devotees. 2 Many of us in the West tend to view non-Western composers and their works much as we do our own. For us, in the formulation "great classical composer," the word classical encompasses both religious and secular works. Western composers write music for either religious or secular purposes. Traditional South Indian composers had no concept of music that was not religious. Indeed, religion, philosophy, and science were one. The Western cultural cleavage into religious and secular existences as evidenced, in part, by the dichotomy of religion and philosophy, can be traced back to Judeo- Greco thought. During the Middle Ages Western Christian society was unified in a religious matrix that, in some ways, paralleled traditional Indian culture. That changed with developments in the early Renaissance when religion and philosophy evolved in dissimilar directions. It is not surprising, then, that we Westerners find it difficult to understand that Tyagaraja was not just a classical composer, that he had no concept of what it would have meant to compose secular music. He was a holy man whose daily life was focused on his God. His entire musical output is an expression of his all-encompassing devotion. 3 The Sanskrit word, uncavritti, refers to the birds that go to the fields after the harvest and pick up the few stray grains that are left over. The uncavritti is a devout mendicant, a holy person who takes vows of poverty and goes about begging for his daily sustenance. Each day the uncavritti goes out into the streets to beg only for sufficient food to sustain him and his family for that day. He stops before a house and sings devotional songs and dances until the householder comes out and puts grain in the pot fastened at his waist. There was an unspoken rule that the uncavritti may remain as long as it takes to milk a cow. If by then the householder still has not appeared, the uncavritti must then move on empty-handed to another house. Today, the tradition has virtually died out. Annual festivals</page><page sequence="13">126 Asian Music, Fall/Winter 1988/89 celebrate the memory of the practice in which a venerated older man walks the streets in traditional dress accompanied by a bhajana party. On his belt is fastened a brass pot in which the devout place grain as he passes their houses. It is also common for people to kneel down and wash the feet of the uncavritti as an act of devotion. 4 Panduranga is also called Vithoba and Vittahala. 5 The idea of utter surrender to the universal Godhead, evidenced in many ways in Indian culture, is acted out fully in the Kalylna.
