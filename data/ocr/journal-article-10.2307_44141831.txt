<plain_text><page sequence="1">ORIGIN OF IRON METALLURGY IN INDIA M.D.N. Sahi Recently, archaeological evidences have indicated that iron objects occur in a context datable to thirteenth century B.C. at Eran (Pandey, 1975) and Ahar. Thus, 'whatever may have been the date of earlier beginning, by about the early dacade of the thirteenth century B.C. iron smelting was definitely known in India on a bigger scale' (Sahi, 1979, 366). In view of such an early date, it is worth enquiring whether iron technology in India came as a result of diffusion from West Asia (Pleiner, 1971, Bharadwaj, 1973, 392) or originated indepen- dently (Sahi, 1974, Chakrabarti, 197o, Banerjee, 1977); particularly because the excavators of Ahar (Sankalia et al, 1969, 223) have observed that certain pottery forms and terracotta incised balls ťdo recall similar forms from Tepe Hissar, Shah Tepe and Troy'. At the same time it has also been mentioned that 'several very distinc- tive shapes which characterise the Iranian and Anatolian neoli- thic and chalcolithic cultures are conspicuously absent at Ahar and elsewhere in India' Incidentally, the objects indicating a contact referred to by Sankalia at Ahar belong to Periods lb and and Ic and actually it is in the upper deposits of lb and Ic that occurrence of iron has been pointed out by me (Sahi, 1979, 365). Does this imply that because of this contact Aharians learnt the iron smelting technology from the Anatolians or Iranians ? The claim of Sankalia has been contested by Rao (1962-63, 198), Thapar (1965-163) Allchin (1968, 98), Chakrabarti (1968, 98) and Dhavalikar (1970-71, 24). They believe that the parallelism drawn by Sankalia is highly speculative, because such forms are available in earlier contexts in India itself. Moreover, even if there was a contact, as visualised by San- kalia, between Ahar and Troy, the introcuction of iron technology 104</page><page sequence="2">ios at Ahar cannot be ascribed to that source, because iron does not seem to have appeared at Troy prior to Period IV, in the twelfth century B.C. (Forbes, 1950, 379, 450), Regarding the Iranian forms with which parallelism is drawn, it may be pointed out that they belong to iron Age levels assign- able by Carbon- 14 dates to circa 1000-800 B.C. (Thapar, 1965, 165 ; Agrawal, 1971, 79 ; and Mandai, 1972, 98). Thus, if there was any exchange, it was the Iranian who borrowed. The theory of any import from the region of Asia Minor can also be ruled out on the following grounds. A suitable process was apparently first invented by barbarian tribes living among the Armenian mountains in what the Hittites called Kizuwadna. The Aryan rulers of Mitanni who incorporated the it on workers in their military monarchy appreciated the value of the new metal, but guarded the secret of its production and controlled the output by virtue of the normal state monopoly over the metal trade. The Hittite king Hattusilis III wrote a letter to one of his contem- poraries, probably Ramses II (1292-1125 B.C.), the king of Egypt. It reads, 'As for the great iron which you wrote about to me, good iron is not available in any seal house in Kissuwatna. That it is bad time for producing iron, I have written. They will produce good iron, but as yet they will not have finished. When they have finished, I will send it to you. To-day, now I am dispatching an iron dagger to you' (Gurney, 1961, 83). The above evidence not only indicates that there was scarcity of iron in the country but also that probably the Hittites did not believe in disseminating the knowledge of iron smelting even to the Egyptians, particularly even when Ramses II had matrimonial relationship with the Hittite ruler Hattusilis III ; otherwise the question of demanding iron goods would not have arisen. Iron technology could not have been borrowed from the Phoenicians, who according to Belch (quoted by Banerjee, 1965, 106) were a possible source of iron in India, because 'a careful survey of all iron finds in the light of their context shows clearly that the Philistines just used iron in the twelfth and eleventh</page><page sequence="3">106 centuries B.C.* (Tell el Farah tombs), (Albright, 1960, 110). This is a later context than Ahar. Thus, in the absence of any evidence either from Ahar or Eran which may indicate a definite contact with Western Asia in the Iron Age deposits assignable to fourteenth-thirteenth centuries B.C., there seems to be hardly any chance of importation of either iron objects or iron technology in India. Let us now examine the other aspect of the problem and see if there was any chance of iron- metallurgy being learnt through experience at Ahar or Eran. This possibility cannot be ruled out. Since a detailed report of the excavations at Eran is not available, let us examine the most significant evidence available from Ahar. It consists of metallurgical analysis of copper objects and slags obtained from stratified levels in the excavations. It has been reported that during the excavations of the deposits of Period I at Ahar, heaps of slag like materials were recovered along with copper objects. The slag like material was found in the Trenches H and I, in specially made round pits of about one and a half feet in diametre. It is not known whether this pit was a part of a furnace. Three samples of slag like material obtained from the deposits of Period lb and Ic, which also yielded iron objects, have been analysed by Hegde (Sankalia, et al, 1969, 225-228).

Phase Ib The above analysis, indicates that iron content has been found present in both the .«lag (43*89% to 48 26%) as well as the artifacts (I '22% to 6*48%). This analytical data also points to the impurity pattern of the artifacts. The sample of ores (Chalcopyrite) from the Khetri area are almost similar, and it is possible to indicate that the copper metal of the artifacts recovered from Ahar was probably smelted from the Chalcopyrite ore of the Aravalli region, found at Khetri, Babai, Singhana, Deriba, Devbari, Delwara and Kotri. The last three places are situated within a radius of 32 kms. from Ahar. It has further been observed that 'complete removal of iron from copper, while the metal is extracted from Chalcopyrite ore, is a problem. One of the conditions necessary for complete removal of iron from copper is high temperature of smelting furnace (over 1200°C). It is necessary to produce separate liquid slag and liquid metal. In this process, if silica (sand or powdered quartz) is mixed with the crushed ore (Chalcopyrite) it acts as fluxing agent and hence promotes fluidity in the smelting charge, lowers the fusion temperature of the ore and facilitates the removal of impurities from the extracted metal' (Hedge, 1969). Since the slag's specific gravity (4) is less than half of the molten copper (Sp. Gr. 8*7) the slag can easily be removed (Agrawal, 1971, 158). The final black or blister copper is about 95% to 97% pure. This study has led Hedge (1973, 401) to conclude that Ahar</page><page sequence="5">loé Was not only a copper smelting centre but also that the smelting technique practiced at Ahar was much advanced. It was beyond the stage of experimentation. This circumstantial evidence further indicates that the chalcolithic people who were smelting chalcopyrite for copper were well acquainted with the iron ore/metal and were successfully tackling the problem of eliminating iron from copper ore. Secondly that at Ahar furnaces were in operation which could produce a temperature high enough (1200°C) to melt even iron ores. When temperature of 1100°C to 1150°G is reached, iron flows forming a semi-fluid mass (bloom) that can be forged and worked Hedge,) 1969, 227). In the light of this circumstantial evidence and the observa- tion of the excavator that 'it may not be pure accident that we find evidence at these levels (layers 2 and 3 of Trenches H and I) of copper and iron smelting in the form of slags' (Sankalia et al, 1969, 10), it may reasonably be postulated that it could not have been difficult for the Aharians to extract metallic iron and forge iron tools from the slag of copper (thus eliminated and obtained as by product) which contained about 50% of iron, to begin with. It may be recalled that iron objects were also recovered in the corresponding levels. Other sources of iron-ores were probably tapped latter in the second stage. If this hypothesis is accepted it would be unreasonable to hold that the metallurgy of iron has little in common with copper and bronze technology or that the craft of a blacksmith is basically different from that of a copper metallurgist and that unlike copper etc. iron could not be made fluid in furnaces being used by copper metallurgists (Bharadwaj, 1973, 391). For the chalcolithic coppersmiths, chalcopyrite became a very popular and, perhaps, handy, ore, though in comparison with other ores of copper it contains least percentage of metallic content. In the metal inventory of copper objects we find that Harappans led the rest in abundance of metal followed by copper-Hoard people. Other Chalcolithic cultures are poorer in comparision but are</page><page sequence="6">109 richer than the neolithic cultures of the South (Agrawal, 1971, 205). Iron content in the composition of copper objects of Chalco- lithic period from Navdatoli, Ghandoli and Somnath varies from 0 57 to 2*5%. At Nevasa it is only 010%. Copper objects from Jokha had 1*80% of ferrous contents (Mehta, 1971, 68). Where as besides other objects of copper having iron contents in them, copper bangles from Jorwe, Nevasa and Rangpur had not even the slightest trace of iron in them. Chemical examination of copper objects from Rangpur (Rao, 1962-63, 152, 153) indicates that except for two copper bangles, two celts and one knife, all the remaining eight objects had traces of iron contents (0*24 to 1*80%) in their composition, indicating that for the former five copper objects some other source of copper ore was tapped. Here it is also significant that none oí the former five objects belonged to Period III. Copper objects from Period II Í contained maximum contents of iron. So is the case at other sites also. Thus it appears that in the earlier periods (I and II at Rangpur) Chalcolithic people were also obtaining additional copper from a different source. This source probably was from the Copper-Hoard people. This is indicated by the occurrence of a typical anthropomorphic figure at Lo thai and non-ferrous copper contents. During the fourteenth-thirteenth century B.C. when the OCP-Copper Hoard culture came to an end due to a natural calamity or 'deluge' (Lai, 1971-72, 102) this source of copper was probably cut off There was thus an urgent need of a substitute for copper. This is also reflected by the non-availability of non-ferrous copper objects in the later deposits (Period III at Rangpur) of the Chalcolithic cultures. There is, therefore valied reasons to presume that iron metallurgy was invented independently as an off- shoot of copper metallurgy in India, particularly» in the regions of Malwa and Banas cultures. It probably developed simply by experience in handling copper ores that had substantial iron content. Secondly</page><page sequence="7">110 there seems to be little possibility of any diffusion or importation either from West Asia after the break up of the Hittite monopoly or through Pakistan from Iran. Iron technology could not probably be developed in the Gangetic Valley because the OCP-G &gt;pper Hoard people were exploiting copper ore which had no ferrous content. Purity of copper content in the objects produced from this source was to the extent of 99% (Agrawal, 1971, 154). Thus for them the extraction was simple and at low temperature. It could not of itself have led to the discovery of iron-metallurgy. NOTES AND REFERENCES Agrawal, D.P. (1971) Copper Bronze Age in India , New Delhi Albright, W.F.
