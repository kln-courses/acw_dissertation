It would be photographs; the rest would be fragments of cloth, bits of cotton, lumps of earth, records of speech, pieces of wood and iron, phials of odors, plates of food and of excrement Booksellers would consider it quite a novelty; critics would murmur, yes, but is it art ; and I could trust a majority of you to use it as you would a parlor game. James Agee Let Us Now Praise Famous Men Detritus, debris, leavings, what is disdained, all things torn and worn, out of the rag pile, junk pile: fenders, universal joints, wheels, tires, batteries, bones, all come to rest to be the rest of whatever was not used or used to near extinction on the ground around this end of Grand Rue: exhausted stuff from Detroit or Tokyo, or Torino; of the sewing shops of Pakistan, bone ends of Haitian lives from the city cemetery. Guyodo, Celeur and Eugène search though this debris everyday. They know who is doing what in Port-au-Prince, in Haiti, and in the world. "Do you know them?" one could ask. They respond with assemblages resurrected out of the fatra, this garbage. Like Giraudoux's Ragpicker they could say to anyone who inquires what they know about the people who run the world, "Know them, Countess, I know them to the bottom of their souls. I go through their garbage every day." To look at the works of the Atis Rezistans is to walk into the underworld, underside, undergarments of our present world, invited by those Vodou spirits, the Gede. These Gede artists lead like Charon, or poetic Virgil, from this world into confrontation with the next. In his dark studio Celeur begins with a credo of these artists: that they live surrounded by visibles and invisibles; that the artists never die because they create and the work goes into the sprit of those who see or who listen. The title then announces that the Atis Rezistans -the Artists of the Resistance -and their ghetto in Port-au-Prince are now on view.</page><page sequence="2">Atis Rezistans: the Place , the Video , the Academy 359 Understanding the mission of the Atis Rezistans, videographer Leah Gordon amazes us into the labyrinth of paths between Port-au-Prince municipal cemetery and the congested Carrefour Crossroads, following a red jacket "Bravo 7" down passages so constricted that it is possible to touch both walls with arms still bent at the elbows. "Bravo 7" turns to beckon the camera forward. Jean Marais following elusive Juliette Greco into a vaguely Parisian Hades of departed spirits in Cocteau's Orpheus arises in imagination. We discover "Bravo 7" is Guyodo, turning to invite us into his studio. He describes this ghetto as inhabited by all social classes. Yes, there is violence. Yes, there are thieves. Yet this is a creative part of the city where many artisans live, making bright things out of scraps. There are mechanics, tailors, intellectuals, he tells us. Celeur, Eugène and Guyodo live and work here in an extant existential metaphor. Londoner Leah Gordon has been at pains to learn the lay of the land, the language, the habits and the attitudes of people and place. It is her camera that enabled us to follow Guyodo around corners, down the alleys behind little kids who laugh and run, into a courtyard where Atis Rezistans Celeur, Eugène and Guyodo transform auto bodies, bones, secondhand clothing, rubber tires, old shoes and bicycles into embodied spirits. A metal giant two stories high with a constantly mobile penis made from a shock absorber guards the entrance to a courtyard where children play under the laundry hung out to dry. An eight-foot assemblage of anthropomorphic truck parts topped by a skull haloed with a chromed hubcap flutters a size XL pink dress into the light breeze. The work gives new meaning to auto body. Inside the studio, Gordon frames a telling moment when Eugène feeds a skull in a setting much like an altar. It is a ritual and it is not a ritual. The artist feeds this remainder of a deceased neighbor almost perfunctorily, then reaches for another, feeds it, another and feeds it. Unlike a focused Vodou oungan or manbo in a formal Vodou ceremony, his act of feeding is more like a parent nourishing his children. Rather than a touristic Vodou performance or an accommodation of the exotic to anthropologist's inquiries, it is an expression of the loose and devout religious sensibilities of this neighborhood and of these artists. We learn that the act is full of care for the deceased, still present as ancestors, though only this piece of bone is visible. The artists transform the bones into something rich and strange. The artists explain that auto parts or human bones, they are engaged in acts of resurrections, making the dead live again, bringing the invisible spirit back into visibility. From the assemblage of ambient soundscape of the noisy district a section of Handel's Messiah catches hearing. "Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world." It is a radio</page><page sequence="3">360 LeGrace Benson broadcast in English from one of the churches. The words are from that moment in the Catholic Mass when the priest elevates the host, bread transformed into the Body of Christ, invisible made visible in all space and time. Accidental? Nothing is accidental, Celeur, Eugène and Guyodo would tell you. Framed in a studio door, a little boy plays in the dirt of the passageway. Soon maman appears, threatening him with a blow of her hand, then picking up her rebellious child, exits stage left. In an instant he is back in the dirt, but this time with shoes on his feet. "I use shoes," says Guyodo, "because so many shoes come to Haiti from America, from Europe, from all over. They are secondhand stuff not appropriate for Haiti. Haiti's streets are rough, so these high heels are unsuitable, and the winter shoes are useless too. But I use them to make art, so they are useful." He speaks of how it is the habit of the people who live here to make do with whatever is available. It is frugal, and the artists are also aware that their work recycles trash into art and thus reduces pollution. But more than that, the works resurrect both objects and persons. The artists endow the skulls with new life, reinserting spirit. They all believe in Vodou and understand it as fundamental to their life and to their works. "It is a good thing," says Eugène. " And the Gede are good. When the Gede appear, everything is out in the open. Nobody can hide anything. Gede is not shy. He doesn't mind showing his belly button when he bathes. I put penises and vaginas in my work. Nothing should hide." Hollywood movies of Vodou have presented exaggerated, coyly prurient versions of Vodou that titillate American audiences, in a culture where sex itself is viewed as obscene. Certain reactions of collectors and museum visitors seem to display a similar revel in this same unsalvific lubricity of interpretation, and at least one paper on the Grand Rue works, presented in a sober academic venue, sought for this same sort of arch amusement. Gratefully, Gordon's video presents the frank sexuality as frank sexuality thus bringing attention to focus on the artists' intimations of our mortality and our urge to create the life that overcomes it. This is the way the Gede work. When the Grand Rue works go into exhibitions in the cities of the northern lands they may well serve thè appetite for the exotic that has nourished both voyeurism and an urge to learn more. From the days when early global adventurers brought back strange objects for the curiosity</page><page sequence="4">Átis Rezistans: the Place, the Video , the Academy 36 1 collections that would evolve into museums, a widening leisure class has both amused itself and broadened its understanding of the scope and diversity of life. The artist Poussin, working in the seventeenth century heyday of European adventurism, empire building, commercial expansion and exponential growth of knowledge, asserted that art should teach moral lessons, and to accomplish this needed to seduce the eye with engaging delights. The ancestors of the Grand Rue artists produced the wealth that enabled the Kings of France, the landholders and the rising merchant class to commission art, including that of Nicolas Poussin, and from 1692 to turn what had been the royal residence into the palace for the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres and the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture. The works of Poussin, already an ancestor for nearly thirty years, nevertheless was present in the form of several of his greatest works. The same French National Assembly that declared the Louvre to be the nation's museum and repository of its national treasures had among its members Jean-Baptiste Belley, (a.k.a. Jean-Baptiste Mars) a Free Colored of Cap François, Deputy from Saint Domingue. Celeur, Eugène and Guyodo seem not to be acquainted with the works of Poussin, but their preoccupation with the unerring presence of death, and the deliberated memoriam tangibly present in bones and especially in the skull is notably present in such works by the Colonial era French artist "The Shepherds of Arcadia; Et in Arcadia Ego Sum" (1638, now in the Louvre.) They are however, well acquainted with the great works wrought by Belley-Mars, by the martyred Ogé insisting that the Declaration of the Rights of Man included the Blacks of Saint Domingue; with the work of Toussaint, of Dessalines and of all that host of unnamed but ritually recalled ancestors who forced the First Black Republic into existence. From the first days of cane field enslavement to the present, death in its harshest forms is fully present in Haitian daily life - nowhere more so than in the Grand Rue district of Port-au-Prince. Like Poussin, the Grand Rue artists know that Eros is the other face of Thanatos and the skull that requires feeding is the top portion of a sexually explicit body. Poussin's shepherds soberly contemplating the presence of death in Arcadia are the same figures that he depicts disporting themselves in priapic orgies around a herm of the god Pan or blessed in ecstatic drunkenness with Bacchus ruling. Modern Europeans, and especially modern North Americans disguise death and make snickering jokes about sex. In the chic galleries and museums they look to the brash and brutal confections of the Grand Rue artists for a little giggly frisson on the juxtaposition of grandiose erections of truck parts with skeletons redeemed from the city cemetery. A parlor game, Agee would say.</page><page sequence="5">362 LeGrace Benson Gordon's video is didactic, even while it seduces with this rich display of the exotic. The laughs it may elicit are nervous signs of recognition that these works are teachings about Eros and Thanatos, sex and death, raw, immediate, hilarious and sober. The video artist appears to have understood her way around the mystery of the geography and into the mysteries announced in the works of the Grand Rue artists. Through her lens we learn the telling contrast between Poussin and, indeed, all the Europeans of the high colonial era who painted human skulls into the hundreds of memento morì canvases: their human crania are at one remove from any actual body, while the Grand Rue artists handle the real skull in order to feed its real spirit, there in the ghetto of Leanne. Commissions for special works followed the first gallery and museum appearances of the works of these artists. They went to Liverpool, where their works helped that city commemorate the 200th anniversary of the British Abolition of Slavery, especially appropriate since it was a British ship that brought the first Africans to Hispaniola to work the fields. Their work was also in Paris and Pittsburg where they created works in situ. Even while using local discards of a habitually wasteful society, they spoke to local patrons of the differences of place and circumstance. To create out of an environment lived in is, they say, a different sort of act from going to some other place, some other arrangement of lives, of finding the detritus there and making something that is both familiar and unfamiliar to the artist for people who are not their relatives or ancestors. Guyodo, Celeur and Eugène are about liberty as well as resistance, and the liberation of themselves and their ghetto with honor and respect has to take place where they live. At a conference in Haiti in November at Club Indigo - a former Club Med resort - the artists articulated this along with descriptions of the many barriers they encounter everyday, including those at the conference itself, where they were refused service at the bar. Celeur, Eugène and Guyodo do what everybody except what folks who live in the houses with big yards enclosed with walls topped with broken glass of razor wire do. Outside those walls is a distributed Gehenna of trashed materials handy for anyone to recycle anything they can still cut, hammer or string together: like the toy cars and trucks the children make out of discarded food tins and scraps of wood; like the doors and window frames now opening into their fourth or fifth house, cobbed together from an assortment of large and small pieces from that other world that tosses away the used, the unfashionable, the old in its rage for the new. In tiny ateliers with dirt floors sheltered by rusting pieces of corrugated metal, a man carves crucifixes out of board ends from a construction project, and another paints a piece of oil drum with yellow plantains and red hibiscus</page><page sequence="6">Atis Rezistans: the Place, the Video, the Academy 363 blossoms, Haiti's national flower. No tourists come to the workshops these days, but the lucky crafters may sell one of the stacked up repetitions to the shops all over Europe and North America that traffic in tourist tchatskas from the Third World. The craftspeople and the now world-renowned artists have a practical knowledge of the political economy of Haiti and of the developed countries. They understand precisely the interrelations of donations and exchanges of goods and the non-material valuations of nation and individual persons. Some of this is apparent in the video, more was explicit in the presentations at the 2009 Haitian Studies Association conference. Professor Myron Beasley of Bates College arranged for the session in the conference of academics, professionals and technical experts, introducing the video, and then the artists. Their presentations were intense, starting with the example of how the ghetto dwellers endure dishonor and disrespect right at home in Haiti. An appalled North American member of the audience immediately offered to buy them drinks at the end of the session, totally oblivious that this offer was perhaps even more disrespectful than the bartender's dismissal. In this venue where at least half the attendees have advanced degrees, and nearly all identify with so-called liberal domestic and global causes, it was clear that the Grand Rue artists have a lot of work to do before their message of resistance and liberation is well understood. One of them explained how it is usually the bourgeoisie (his word) that have museums, and people go there to see works of artists that have been brought to the museum. But they have a novel idea. In late November and early December of 2009, they plan the First Ghetto Biennale. "This district, Leanne, is our museum," they relate. The whole neighborhood, all the artists, everything. This is the museum and people should come here to see the work and where we live." The website for Atis Rezistans invites participants, especially artists, who are welcomed to come spend nearly two weeks to work on special projects culminating in an artists' conference on December 18. Already engaged in creating programs for youngsters in Leanne ghetto, they imagine an outreach to other artists from anywhere in the world to come be with them and participate in the creation of new works. They see all these efforts - their own material and spiritual working, the encouragement and teaching of the youngsters of the neighborhood, the exhibitions in overseas museums and galleries and this unique international outreach-inreach of the Ghetto Biennale as efforts of resistance and liberty, the classic Haitian stance from that day in the sixteenth century when the first slave off the boat took to his heels into the dangers and freedom of marronage.</page><page sequence="7">364 LeGrace Benson Note "Let us now praise famous men, and our fathers that begat us. . ..Their bodies are buried in peace; but their name liveth forevermore.."
