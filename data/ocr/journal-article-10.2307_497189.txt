(Arch. A nz. 1910, col. 536.) Montelius on Prehistoric Chronology. - In Z. Ethn. XLII, 1910, pp. 955-960, O. MONTELIUS gives a rdsum6 of his various conclusions as to the possibility of attaining an exact chronology of prehistoric things. iHe shows that the various epochs in different parts of Europe were more nearly contemporary than has been heretofore supposed, and that fairly exact dates may be assigned to these periods, 1100-1000, 1000-900, 900-800, 800-700, 700-600, forming, according to him, the five periods of the Iron Age. Comb Patterns in Old Aegean and Middle European Culture.- In Z. Ethn. XLIII, 1911, pp. 161-163 (3 figs.), H. SCHMIDT writes of the significance of some single and double comb patterns on pottery, as casting light on the relation between the Old Aegean and Middle European civiliza- tions. Double combs, such as are represented on the discus of Phaestus, and also on the pottery of Tordos (Transylvania), are found likewise on</page><page sequence="3">EGYPT] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1911 535 vases of the Stone Age from Thessaly, which served apparently as a step- ping-stone between the two civilizations. The Prehistoric Period in Malta. --In B.S.R. V, 1910, pp. 141-163, T. E. PEET contributes to the study of the prehistoric period in Malta, com- bating in the first part of his paper the view, expressed most decidedly by Mayr and others, that Malta belonged to a circle of countries which devel- oped under the influence of the older Aegean and later Mycenaean culture; and in the second part describing excavations at Bahria, which have yielded some unique types of pottery. The Preparation of Skins in the Stone Age.--In Z. Ethn. XLII, 1910, pp. 839-895 (110 figs.), L. PFEIFFER, basing his conclusions on present- day implements and processes, especially those of peoples now living in a primitive state of culture, discusses the uses of many prehistoric leather- working tools, and the probable methods of procedure in manufacturing and tanning skins. Stone Age Settlements in Finland.- In Ubersicht der Steinzeitlichen Wohnplatzfunde in Finland (Helsingfors, 1909, Akademische Buchhandlung, 144 pp.; 68 figs.), J. AILIO discusses the settlements of the Stone Age in Finland, the character of their remains, their date, etc. Prehistoric Flint Mines near Kvarnby and S. Sallerup. - In his doctor's dissertation, entitled Fbrhistoriska Flintgrufvor och Kultuslager vid Kuarnby och S. Sallerup i Skdne (Stockholm, 1910, Haeggstr6m, 102 pp.; 87 figs.), BROR SCHNITTGER discusses the flint mines and the prehistoric remains near Kvarnby and S. Sallerup in Skine, Sweden. A Second Gold Land of Solomon's.--In Z. Ethn. XLIII, 1911, pp. 1-79 (8 figs.), J. DAHSE finds a second gold land of Solomon's (not that of Ophir) in the Gold Coast of Ashanti, which he thinks was visited in con- nection with Phoenician voyages to Tartessus in the Iberian peninsula. The article is in the nature of a history of the west coast of Africa as a gold-producing country, and one chapter discusses the ancients' knowledge of this region, Atlas, Atlantis, the Elysian Plain, voyages of Hanno and the Pseudo-Skylax, etc., entering into the tale. He thinks that the so-called aggry-beads were brought to the coast from Egypt to be exchanged for gold. The swastika as a symbol on gold weights is discussed, as is the astronomical knowledge of the natives, which seems akin to that of the East, and was perhaps derived from their intercourse with the Phoenicians. He refutes the idea that Guinea could itself have been the Ophir of Solomon. EGYPT The Decree of Amenophis, Son of Hapu.- In Sitzb. Berl. Akad. 1910, pp. 932-948 (pl.), G. MILLER publishes, with translation and commentary. the decree of Amenophis, Son of IHapu (Birch, in Chabas, Me'langes, I, 2e sdrie, 324-343; Brugsch, Aeg. Zeitung, XIII, 125-127, Erman, Aegypten, p. 214 f.; Breasted, Ancient Records, pp. 377-381). He concludes that it is an ancient forgery, composed and written under the twenty-first dynasty. The Hyksos. - In J. Asiat. XVI, 1910, pp. 247-340, R. WEILL gathers all the material bearing upon the history of the Hyksos from Egyptian and other sources and arranges this in chronological order. The conclusions which he reaches from this material remain for discussion in a later article.</page><page sequence="4">536 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XV, 1911 Circumnavigation of Africa. - The story of the circumnavigation of Africa in the reign of the Egyptian king Necho, as related by Herodotus (IV, 42), was declared by W. Sieglin, at tile November (1909) meeting of the Berlin Archaeological Society, to be a fabrication, inconsistent with climatic and geographical facts and suspicious as well from the entire silence of other learned and travelled Greeks, both before and after Herodotus. His arguments were opposed by H. Schuchhardt. (Arch. Anz. 1910, cols. 523-527.) The Murch Collection of Antiquities.- In a supplement to B. Metr. Mus. January, 1911 (28 pp.; 22 figs.), A. G. MACE describes the Murch col- lection of Egyptian antiquities, chiefly small objects, recently acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of New York. Itcontains 42 examples of cylinder seals, of which 17 date back to very early times and have not yet been satis- factorily deciphered. Twenty-three bear royal names including such rare ones as User-n-ra of the fifth dynasty, and Ra-mer-nefer and Her-tep-taui of the thirteenth dynasty. There are over 800 scarabs and other types of seal used for stamping, of which 242 bear royal names and 70 private names; and a considerable number of signet rings. There are two large scarabs of Amenhetep III, on one of which the king relates that between the first and tenth years of his reign he "shot with his own how 102 lions, fierce ones." The other commemorates the celebration of his marriage with Queen Tii. The collection also includes twenty heart scarabs, a glazed limestone frag- ment giving both cartouches of Amenrud of the twenty-third dynasty, ex- cellent specimens of glass, many coins and amulets, a few pieces of pottery, etc. Of the amulets there are twenty-four varieties antedating the period of foreign domination, and seventy-four later than that period. Egyptian or Phoenician.-- Another in the series of mutually subver- sive articles on the silver basin from Cyprus in the Berlin museum, which Studniczka (Jb. Arch. I. 1907, pp. 175 ff.) and others class with Phoenician work of the ninth - seventh centuries B.C., is published by F. W. v. BISSING, ibid. XXV, 1910, pp. 193-199 (2 figs.), with new evidence to support his former contention (ibid. 1898, pp. 34 ff.) that the object is genuine Egyptian work of the nineteenth dynasty. In technique (beaten work with engraved details) and in some important elements of the decoration, it corresponds exactly with undoubted Egyptian work of that time. Von Bissing claims that the mixed style, in which Syrian and Cyprian elements are combined with old Egyptian motives, began in Egypt in the Ramessid period, and not among the Phoenicians. The History of Mummification. - In the Proceedings of the Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow, Dr. Elliott Smith, for many years Pro- fessor of Anatomy in the School of Medicine at Cairo, discusses the history of mummification in Egypt. He thinks the discovery of the possibility of preserving the bodies of the dead was accidental. The shallow pits in hot, dry sand which formed the graves in predynastic times dried the body with- out allowing it to decay. Moreover the "natron" or salts of soda, which was the chief factor in mummification, existed in enormous quantities in the deserts on both sides of the Nile where the earliest inhabitants buried their dead, and the preservative qualities of this could not long have re- mained unknown. The oldest mummy in existence dates from the fifth dynasty, and is now in the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons.

The Book of the Dead.--In J. Asiat. XVI, 1910, pp. 5-74, E. AMA- LINEAU completes the discussion of the 18th chapter of the Book of the Dead begun in a previous number of the same journal. The Egyptian Labyrinth.- In Ann. Arch. Anthr. III, 1910, pp. 134-136 (pl.), J. L. MYRES attempts a restoration of the Labyrinth based on the description of Herodotus. An Egyptian Funerary Cap.- In Ann. Arch. Anthr. III, 1910, p. 137 (colored pl.), R. MOND publishes a funerary cap of the time of Thothmes IV, found by him in 1906 in the cemetery of Thebes. It is 7 cm. in diame- ter and about 1 cm. thick, made of pieces of linen gummed together. On the top was a lotus flower and on the sides a design consisting of small rectangles. Red, black, and yellow were the colors used. Falcon, not Sparrowhawk. -- In Mon. Plot, XVII, 1909,pp. 5-28 (pl.; 20 figs.), G. BkNiDITE publishes a stone falcon of the Saite period recently ac- quired by the Louvre. Between the legs of the bird is a small standing figure of a king. The writer shows that the bird of Horus must be identified as the falcon (falco peregrinus), not sparrowhawk as has previously been thought. The Iron Workers of the Sudan.--In S. Bibl. Arch. XXXIII, 1911, pp. 96 f., A. H. SAYCE shows that mounds of iron slag are found in the Sudan, chiefly in connection with temples, so that the spot on which the iron was worked must have been regarded as sacred. There was no copper or bronze. age in central Africa. In Ethiopian tombs and cities the place occupied by bronze in Egypt is taken by iron. The iron-smith must have been a more or less sacred personage among the Ethiopians, and the iron foundry was an annex of their temples. It thus occupied among them much the same position as that which native tradition ascribes to the ear- liest sanctuaries of dynastic Egypt. The Geography of Eastern Africa. - In Rend. Acc. Lincei, XIX, 1910, pp. 489-568, E. SCHIAPARELLI presents a second article on the geography of Eastern Africa as based on the hieroglyphic monuments. Lists of mines of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, and various minerals form the subject of this paper. Alexandrian Tetradrachms of Tiberius. - A hoard of 198 tetra- drachms, of which one is of Ptolemy Philadelphus, 61 of Ptolemy Neus Dionysus, and 136 of the seventh year of Tiberius, is described by J. GRAF- TON MILNE in Num. Chron. 1910, pp. 333-339 (pl.), who adds some interest- ing conclusions concerning the carelessness of portraiture of the emperor on Egyptian issues, the recall of the Egyptian coins of Tiberius, and the rate of wearing out of reverse dies as compared with obverse. BABYLONIA, ASSYRIA, AND PERSIA The First Dynasty of Babylon.--In S. Bibl. Arch. XXXII, 1910, pp. 272-282, C. H. W. JOHNS publishes a number of chronological data in regard to the years of the kings of the first dynasty of Babylon, that sup- plement the publications of Poebel in Vol. 6 of the Babylonian Expedition of the University of Pennsylvania. The First Dynasty of Babylon in Berosus.-In Or. Litt. XIV, 1911,</page><page sequence="6">538 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XV, 1911 cols. 19-21, P. SCHNABEL calls attention to the fact that the second dynasty of Berosus, which corresponds chronologically to the first eight kings of the so-called first dynasty of Babylon, consisted, according to some of the re- censions of Berosus, of Medes; but in the Armenian recension they are called Mar. AMar he regards as a modified form of Amnar, " Amorite," which corresponds to the established historical fact that the first dynasty of Babylon was Amorite. Berosus and the Cuneiform Inscriptions. - In Klio, X, 1910, pp. 476-494 (2 figs.), C. F. LEHMANN-HAUPT continues his discussion of Bero- sus and the cuneiform inscriptions (see ibid. VIII, pp. 227-251). The res- torations proposed for the completion of Column III of the List of Kings by previous writers are all faulty. In the text of Berosus Semiramis is placed in the thirteenth century B.c., whereas it is known from inscriptions that she was the wife of Samsi-Adad, 826-811 B.c., son of Salmanassar III. This points to an error on the part of the epitomizers. Berosus must have included Semiramis in the list of forty-five kings which composed his sixth dynasty, ending with Alexander the Great. Column III should, then, be restored with the names of the first seven kings of Dynasty H, followed by a summary, and then a new dynasty, which he would desig- nate 1I2, composed of Adadnirari, Salmanassar III, and Assur-dan(kal) followed by a summary. This will fill up the missing twelve lines of the tablet. iSzub, King of Babylon. - In Or. Litt. XIV, 1911, cols. 62-63, B. MEISSNER cites a passage that furnishes additional evidence that by the namne gfizub two persons are denoted, Mulzib-marduk and NergaluSzib. It records a reward that was paid for the capture of one of the fizubs. The Earliest Mention of Borsippa. - In S. Bibl. Arch. XXXIII, 1911, p. 6, A. H. SAYCE publishes a tablet of the period of Dungi, King of Ur, in the Royal Scottish Museum of Science and Art, which mentions "the year when the priest of Borsippa was invested." This is a new date and is the first known mention of Borsippa. Dada, Patesi of Nippur. - In Or. Litt. XIV, 1911, cols. 154-155, L. DELAPORTE publishes a small tablet which shows that Dada, who has hith- erto been known only as a patesi of Nippur, was a contemporary of Ibi-Sin, King of Ur. The Manana Dynasty at Kish.- In S. Bibl. Arch. XXXIII, 1911, pp. 98-103, C. H. W. JOHNS publishes Babylonian tablets which show that the accession of Manana at Kish occurred in the thirteenth year of Sumu-abum of Babylon, and the fall of the dynasty of Kish in the nineteenth year of Sumrnu-la-ilu. The Name Sennacherib.- In Z. Morgenl. XXIV, 1910, pp. 427-430, H. TORCZYNER shows that the ordinary reading of the name of the Assyrian king Sennacherib as Sin-ahh!-erba, and the reading proposed by Ungnad of Sin-ahhk-riba, are both incorrect, and that the name should be read Sin-ahhk- eriba, and that the ideogram for "city," which is ordinarily read alu or mahazu, should be read eri, which is the value that it has in the name of this king. A New Fragment of the Creation-Legend. -In S. Bibl. Arch. XXXIII, 1911, pp. 6-7, A. H. SAYCE publishes a fragment in the possession of the Royal Scottish Museum of a tablet containing part of the missing portion</page><page sequence="7">BABYLONIA, ETC.1 ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1911 539 of the second book of the Babylonian Creation-Epic. See also S. H. LANG- noN, in Exp. Times, XXII, 1911, col. 278. The Hilprecht Fragment of the Babylonian Flood Story.-- In J.A.O.S. XXXI, 1910, pp. 30-48, G. A. BARTON subjects Hilprecht's pub- lication of a new fragment of the Babylonian flood story to an elaborate criticism, reaching the conclusion that the philology of the tablet, as well as its palaeography, indicates that it is not older than the Kassite period. See also G. A. BARTON in Ex. Times, XXII, col. 278; and E. KNIGm in Z. Alttest. Wiss. XXXI, 1911, pp. 133-146. The Meaning of Kutaru in Assyrian Magic. - In S. Bibl. A rch. XXXIII, 1911, pp. 62-67, L. W. KING shows that the hitherto obscure kutaru in Assyrian magical texts denotes "ceremonial burning." This dis- covery throws light upon the ceremonial procedure of the Assyrians, and proves that the objects over which separate incantations were repeated were not intended to be burnt separately after the repetition of each formula, but in groups. The burning took place in the nik nakku a kutari, or "fumigation bowl," which was a large, flat bowl or tray of metal on which a number of objects were piled up in a heap and burned. The Bearded Venus.-JIn R. Arch. XVII, 1911, pp. 271-298, MoRRIS JASTROW, JR., shows that references to a bearded Ishtar in Assyrian hymns, etc., apply to the star, not to the goddess. The "beard" is formed of rays of light. The bearded Venus of Cyprus, mentioned by Servius and Macro- bius, and the one reported by Herodotus among the Pamphylians, was sym- bolic of strength and virility, not necessarily bi-sexual. The conception of the goddess as bi-sexual appears late in Greek religious beliefs and not at all among Semites. There was no bearded Venus. The Suffering Righteous One in Babylonia. - In J. Asiat. XVI, 1910, pp. 75-144, F. MARTIN discusses the fragments of the Babylonian lyric which contains the lament of a righteous king over the calamities that have befallen him, which bears such a close resemblance to the Book of Job. The text is given in transcription, and there is a precise translation accompanied by an elaborate commentary. The Babylonian Script among the Hebrews. - In Z. Morgenl. Ges. LXIV, 1910, pp. 715-732, E. KoNIG, maintains, in opposition to the view of Winckler, Jeremias, Benzinger, and much more recently of Naville, that there is no sufficient evidence that Babylonian was the literary language of the Hebrews down to the time of Josiah, or that all ancient Hebrew docu- ments which have come down to us were originally written in Babylonian and afterwards transcribed into Hebrew. On the contrary, he regards it as probable that the Hebrews had a script of their own even before the time of Solomon, although he admits that no direct evidence for the existence of the so-called Phoenician alphabet has been found earlier than 1000 B.c. The theory of Naville that the Book of Deuteronomy was a Babylonian document, deposited in a wall of the Temple in the time of Solomon and discovered in the time of Josiah, and that the reason why Hilkiah the priest and King Josiah could not read it was because it was written in Babylonian, he rejects as an untenable hypothesis. The Functions of the Uku-u4. - In Or. Litt. XIV, 1911, cols. 101-106, F. MARTIN shows that the functionary known as the uku-ud, who is men- tioned repeatedly in old Babylonian inscriptions, must have been some sort</page><page sequence="8">540 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XV, 1911 of courier, who journeyed between the fortresses of the king to carry dis- patches or to conduct supplies that were being sent to the king or by the king. The Relative Value of Metals in Babylonia. - In Or. Litt. XIV, 1911, col. 106, A. UNGNAD publishes two tablets which show that at the time of the first dynasty of Babylonia the ratio of gold to silver was as 3 to 1, and of silver to iron, as 8 to 1. Acclimatization of Plants and Animals in Babylonia.--In Mitt. Vorderas. Ges. XV, 1910, pp. 476-501, B. MEISSNER gathers passages which show that from the earliest times the kings of Babylonia brought back plants and animals from distant lands which they attempted to acclimatize in their own country. Some of these attempts, as, for instance, in the case of the cedar of Lebanon, were a failure. Others were a success, and con- siderably enriched the resources of the land. Their example was followed by the Assyrian kings from Tiglath-Pileser onward, who tried to domesti- cate not only plants, but also foreign animals, such as wild cattle and ele- phants. All the later Assyrian kings made similar efforts, and to them is due in large measure the introduction of most of the useful plants and fruit trees into Europe. Sheep-shearing in Babylonia.--In Or. Litt. XIV, 1911, cols. 97-101, B. MEISSNER shows that in all lands it was originally the custom to pluck the wool off sheep instead of shearing them. In Babylonia also in the earliest times the verb for gathering wool denotes properly "pluck." The invention of shearing sheep was introduced into Babylonia between 1300 and 600 B.c. and spread rapidly. Doubtless the introduction of iron was the chief reason for the change. Early and Middle Persian Art.- The March (1910) meeting of the Berlin Archaeological Society was addressed by F. Sarce and E. Herzfeld on old and middle Persian art, illustrated by the plates from their new work, Iranische Felsreliefs. The two periods treated, the Achaemenid, ending with the death of Darius III in 330 B.c., and the Sassanid, beginning in 224 A.D., were in substance continuous, the intervening period of foreign rule under the Greek Seleucids and the Parthian Arsacids having made little or no imnpression on the native Iranian art. This was symbolic and epic in spirit, in contrast to the dramatic character of Greek art, and expressed itself most conspicuously in huge rock sculptures and rock-cut tombs, a custom appar- ently of Median origin, commemorating the greatness and the victories of the kings. A careful study of these monumental reliefs has enabled the two explorers to fix their relative dates by the development of style and to assign them to their respective subjects. The thirty supporters of the king's throne, in a prayer scene, are accompanied by the names of the sub- ject peoples whom they represent, - an important ethnographic document. (Arch. Anz. 1910, cols. 543-548.) SYRIA AND PALESTINE The Date of the Exodus. - In S. Bibl. Arch. XXXIII, 1911, pp. 46-50, E. W. HOLLINGWORTH finds that there is no adequate evidence that the Exodus of the Hebrews took place as late as the reign of Merenptah. On the contrary, Hebrew tradition assigns the Exodus to a much earlier period.</page><page sequence="9">SYRIA AND PALESTINE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1911 541 The Book of Judges contains evidence of Egyptian intervention in Canaan, and shows that the Exodus occurred as early as the reign of Tahutmes II. The oppression by Mesopotamia in Judges synchronizes with the early years of Amenhotep III; the oppression by Jabin synchronizes with the period when Syria was divided between Egypt and the Hittites. The defeat of the Midianites by Gideon synchronizes with the victory of Ramrnessu III over the league of Syrian tribes. The Tombs of the Kgings in Jerusalem.- In S. Bibl. Arch. XXXIII. 1911, pp. 19-25 (5 pls.), P. J. O. MINos makes a new study of the so-called Tombs of the Kings in the fields north of Jerusalem, reaching the conclu- sion that they are neither the sepulchres of the kings of Judah nor the tomb of Helena of Adiabene. The bunch of grapes in the decoration indicates the Asmonean kings, who used these symbols on their coins. The egg-and- dart moulding on the entablature is distinctly Roman. He concludes, ac- cordingly, that "the Tombs of the Kings were excavated and used in the first instance by an Asmonean king, and afterwards were used again by one of the Herods." The Meaning of the Name " Ophel."-- In Pal. Ex. Fund, XLIII, 1911, pp. 51-56, C. F. BURNEY maintains that the evidence from the Old Testament shows that the word "Ophel" does not mean "hill," but "fortress" or "citadel," and that the "Ophel" at Jerusalem was originally the fortress or citadel of the City of David, which took the place of the old Jebusite stronghold of Zion. This was added to and strengthened from time to time by succeeding kings. Yahweh and Jerusalem. - In Exp. Times, XXII, 1911, cols. 226-229, A. H. SAYCE shows that in old Babylonian tablets alongside of the male divinity Yau, who corresponds to the Hebrew divinity Yahu, there is also a feminine divinity Yautum, who corresponds to the Hebrew Yahweh. Yah- well was apparently originally a goddess, who was transformed into a god, as were many other divinities of the Semitic world. Now, in another Babylonian tablet the god Uras is equated with Yau, and Ninip is equated with Yautum. From the Tell el-Amarna letters it appears that Ninip = Yautum = Yahweh was a god of Jerusalem. Putting all this together, we may conclude that the original Jerusalem occupied the Temple-hill; that its patron deity was Salim or Sulmanu, who was addressed as "the Most HIigh God"; that Salim was associated with a "Baal," whose temple stood in a neighboring town, and who was already known as both Yau (Yeho), and Yautu or Yahweh (IP and NIN-IP) before the Israelitish conquest of Canaan; and that the Old Testament is right when it says (Gen. 4:26) that the name of Yahweh was known even in the antediluvian age. The Site of Gibeah of Saul.-In Pal. Ex. Fund, XLIII, 1911, pp. 101- 109 (pl.), F. W. BIRacH seeks to show that the mound of Adaseh or Adeseh was the site of the Biblical Gibeah. In reply to this, D. MACKENZIE reports (ibid. XLIII, 1911, pp. 97-100) that an investigation of the site shows that Adasa cannot possibly be Gibeah, because the remains on the spot show that it was not a pre-Christian site. The Site of 'Ain Shems.-- In Pal. Ex. Fund, XLIII, 1911, pp. 69-79 (3 figs.; pl.), D. MACKENZIE reports the physical features of the Mound of 'Ain Shems, and from the superficial indications discusses the probabilities as to what the excavations will yield.</page><page sequence="10">542 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL.

A Palestinian Bibliography.- The first volume of Thomnsen's invalu- able Palestinian bibliography included all the publications between 1895 and 1904. The second volume, which has just appeared (D)ie Palistina-Literatur, - Eine Internationale Bibliographie in systematischer Ordnung mit Autoren- und Sach/register, bearbeitet und herausgegeben von Peter Thomsen. Zweiter Band, Die Literatur der Jahre, 1905-1909. Leipzig, 1911, J. C. Hinrich'sche Buchhandlung), includes publications between the years 1905 and 1909. Here, under the heads of General Literature, History, Historical Geography and Topography, Archaeology, Geography, and Palestine of To-day, with numerous subheads under each of these divisions, all the books and maga- zine articles in all languages that have anything to do with Palestine or its history have been gathered in the most painstaking fashion. Scholars can- not be too grateful for the self-sacrificing labor that is put into such a volume. It is an indispensable aid in all branches of Palestinian research. The Princeton Expedition to Syria.-In the Publications of the Prince- ton University Archaeological Expedition to Syria in 1904-1905, Division II, Section A, Part 2 (Leyden, 1909, E. J. Brill, pp. 63-148; Appendix, pp. i-xxv; 4 pls.; 93 figs.; map), HOWARD CROSBY BUTLER continues his discussion of the architecture of Southern Syria by describing the remains of the more important buildings on sixty-six different sites in the Southern Hauran. Like the parts already issued, this cointains an abundance of plans, restorations, and photographic reproductions of the different ruins. In Division III, Section A, Part 2 (pp. 21-129; Appendix, pp. i-xxviii; 5 pls.; 249 figs.; map), ENNO LITTMANN, DAVID MAGIE, JR., and D. R. STUART publish 217 Greek and Latin inscriptions from the same district. The most important is a long imperial edict from Kosar il-Hallabat, of which 68 pieces were found, but which is still far from complete. HOWARD CROSBY BUTLER adds a description of Trajan's road from Bosra to the Red Sea in connection with the publication of the milestones found along its course. The Funerary Eagle of the Syrians. - In R. Hist. Rel. LXII, 1910, pp. 119-163 (pl.; 28 figs.), F. CUMONT calls attention to a number of grave stelae found at Hierapolis, at Balkis on the Euphrates, and elsewhere, upon which an eagle is carved, above the inscription, holding a crown in his claws. He shows that the eagle is supposed to transport the soul of the dead to the stars. When a Roman emperor was deified, his body was burned and an eagle released from the top of the pyre. The Romans got this idea of the eagle from the Semites. It can be traced back to the Etana myth in Babylonia. Some Graeco-Phoenician Temples. - A study of Phoenician temples and cult statues, as a contribution to the study of religions, is made by G. H. HILL (J.HII.S. XXXI, 1911, pp. 56-64; 2 pls.), from the coins of the chief cities of Phoenicia and in the Graeco-Phoenician and imperial periods. The Oriental divine pair, more or less hellenized, appears both with marine and with celestial attributes, their original distinction as the gods of a sea- faring and of an inland or mountain people having been to a large extent obliterated. Zeus-Baal, Poseidon, Adonis, Melquarth, Astarte, Europa, the Dioscuri, city goddesses, and others, appear in various forms.

ASIA MINOR The Hittites in the History of Art --In Sitzb. Miin. Akad. 1910, No. 13 (112 pp.; 32 figs.), F. v. REBER discusses the place of the Hittites in the history of art. A general historical discussion shows that the centre of Hittite power was in Cappadocia. The Hittites seem to have been of Armenian origin. Their power lasted from the eighteenth to the twelfth century B.C., and their history can be traced both earlier and later. The architecture of Boghazkeui (Chatti) and Sendschirli (Samal) is described in detail. In plan and decoration the Hittite palace influenced Assyrian and other Oriental architecture. Sphinx-pedestals for columns and lions beside doorways are examples of such influence. The hieroglyphics and the earliest relief sculptures of the Hittites show no Egyptian influence. They brought their writing and their art with them to Cappadocia. The sculpture of ityiik is more naive, more childlike, and livelier than that of Sendschirli, though they may be in the main nearly contemporaneous (perhaps earlier than the thirteenth century). In later times, after the Hittites came into conflict with their conquerors, the Assyrians, their art was under Assyrian influence. The propylaea of Sakje-Geuzi (cf. Garstang in Ann. Arch. Anthr. 1908; A.J.A. XIII, pp. 350 f.) is ascribed to the time of the Sargonids (seventh century B.C.). Hittite Notes.- In S. Bibl. Arch. XXXIII, 1911, pp. 43-45, A. H. SAYCE discusses Hittite texts in which he finds the names Gurgum, Bit-Adin, Bit-A gusi, and Midas. A Hittite Seal Cylinder. - In S. Bibl. Arch. XXXII, 1910, pp. 268- 271 (2 pls.), ALICE GRENFELL publishes a seal-cylinder in the Ashmolean Museum, which depicts craters with curved tubes for the sacramental suck- ing of the wine, and between them the cones of bread that were also eaten as part of the ceremonies. This throws light upon the seal from Kara Eyuk, published by Sayce, ibid. XXXII, 1910, pp. 177 f. A Lycian Headdress.--In J.H.S. XXXI, 1911, pp. 119-123 (7 figs.), H. R. HALL compares the foreign-looking figure of a woman found as a hieroglyph on the Phaestus disk, with a similar figure in gold plate from a shaft grave at Mycenae, and the tall feather-like crown in the hieroglyph of a man's head, with headdresses worn by Philistines, Cypriotes, and others in various representations, especially the defenders of a besieged city on the fragment of a silver cup found at Mycenae. He infers that the feather crown was, as Herodotus testifies, a Lycian headdress; that the siege scene on the silver cup represents a Lycian or Carian city attacked by Mycenaeans; that the tall headdress was adopted from the Lycians by various neighboring peoples; and that the high crest sometimes found with it was taken over by the Greeks from Caria, as tradition says. Dead Cities of Asia Minor. - Under the title Villes mortes d' Asie Mineure (Paris, 1911, Hachette et Cie., 233 pp.; 8 maps and plans; 43 figs.; 4 fr.), FLIX SARTIAUX publishes a general account of the cities of Perga- mon, Ephesus, Priene, Miletus, Didyma, and Hierapolis, in the light of modern excavation.

HASLUCK warns collectors against some recent forgeries of silver coins purporting to emanate fromn Caesarea Mazaca (Num. Chron., 1910, pp. 411-412; 4 figs.). Building a Skeleton. - In R. Et. Anc. XIII, 1911, pp. 162-164 (fig.), C. DUGAs publishes an intaglio found on the island of Samos, and now in Smyrna, on which a seated man with hammer in hand is building a skeleton. He argues that this does not represent Prometheus, but a scene from every- day life; that wooden skeletons were carried about at dinners, as a sort of memento mori, like the small bronze ones which have actually been found. GREECE ARCHITECTURE Athenian Buildings.--In Ath. Mitt. XXXVI, 1911, pp. 39-72, W. DiDORPFELD discusses and criticizes a number of recent works on the archi- tectural and topographical problems of the buildings on the Athenian Acropolis. (1) The Erechtheum and the old Athena Temple. Stevens' restora- tion of the east wall of the Erechtheum (A.J.A. X, 1906, pp. 47 ff.), an article on the Metopon in the Erechtheum (Caskey and Hill, A.J.A. XII, 1908, pp. 184 ff.), and Schrader's theory that the old temple as enlarged by Pisistratus had Ionic columns in the pronaos and opisthodomos and an Ionic frieze along the top of the cella wall (Ath. Mitt. XXX, 1905, p. 305) are approved. Petersen's treatment of the Erechtheumn-Old Temple prob- lem ('die Burgtempel der Athenaia') is criticized at length, and rejected. (2) The Parthenon, The discoveries of Hill in regard to the earlier Parthe- non (as yet unpublished; see A.J.A. XV, 1911, p. 75) are briefly described, and their results accepted. (3) The Propylaea. The work of H. D. Wood and W. B. Dinsmoor (only partially published; see Dinsmoor, A.J.A. XIV, 1910, pp. 143 ff.) is accepted. The question as to the paintings in the north- west wing is briefly discussed (see Ath. Mitt. XXXVI, 1911, p. 87; A.J.A. XV, 1911, p. 546). The resemblances between this building and the Erech- theum suggest that they were built at the same time, perhaps by the same architect. The suggestion is made that the Pinacotheca was designed as a sanctuary. The pillars upon which the statues of horsemen stood are con- structed as Doric antae, showing that in the original plan the Propylaea was to be continued further to the west. (4) The Temple of Nike. Articles by Koster (Jb. Arch. I. XXI, 1906, p. 129) and Petersen (ibid. XXIII, 1908, p. 12) are unfavorably criticized. (5) The Choregic Mlonument of Ni'cias. The work of Dinsmoor (A.J.A. XIV, 1910, pp. 459-484) is praised, that of Versakes ('Eb. 'Apx. 1909, pp. 211-238) condemned. (6) The Chalcothece. The restoration by Versakes ('Eb. 'Apx. 1909, pp. 211 ff.; A.J.A. XIV, p. 497) is rejected. (7) The Asclepieum. The work of Versakes ('E4. 'ApX. 1908, pp. 25 ff.; A.J.A. XIII, 1909, p. 490) is severely criticized. (8) The Pelargicon. A theory recently announced by Kaster (A.J.A. XIV, 1910, p. 232) is criticized, and a brief statement of the theory held by the writer is given. The Portico of Philip at Delos.--In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1911, pp. 214- 221 (2 plans) R. VALLOIS discusses the Portico of Philip at Delos, now in</page><page sequence="13">GREEK A .] ARCHA. ARCAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1911 545 ruins down to its foundations. It was 71.75 mr. long, and 11.15 m. wide. At each end of the facade, on the east side of the building, was a wall pierced by windows, and between the antae of these walls were sixteen Doric col- umnns placed at a distance of 3.35 m. The inscription BaLXde MaKE&amp;dvov WIe'LArwros parXi\ A/rTplov 'Ar'oArMvL covered blocks 8 to 13 of the archi- trave. The missing fourteenth block probably had the word &amp;vEOKEv. The frieze covered only the front half of the architrave. Above was a cornice with gargoyles placed in the axes of the columns. The construction is care- ful; the blocks are fastened by clamps run in lead. The columns were 5.915 m., or six and one-half modules high, i.e. twice the height of the en- tablature (2.95 m.). The enclosed spaces at the ends of the building held dedicatory statues; the base of a statue of Sulla still stands in the southern end. At a later date the portico was more than doubled in size. It was made twice as wide, with twenty-five Doric columns of the same dimension as those on the east side placed along the west front. *At the north end in a line with the back wall of the original portico was a colonnade of four Ionic columns, of the same height as the Doric columns, placed between antae in the form of half columns. This reconstruction dates from about 150 B.C. The Tholos of the Treasury of Sicyon. - In B.C.H. XXXV, 1911, pp. 132-146 (pl.; 18 figs.), F. COURBY discusses the blocks built into the foun- dations of the treasury of Sicyon at Delphi with special reference to the study of these remains by Pomtow (Zeitechriftfiir Geschichlte der Architektur, III, 1910, pp. 97-143, 153-192). The thirteen curved architrave blocks rested on a wall, not on columns, and consequently the 18 to 20 columns of which there are remains cannot be connected with them. The four flat architraves are of different dimensions. The metopes over the curved archi- traves were 0.57 mn. wide, those over the flat architraves 0.875 m. to 0.905 m. The sculptured metopes belong to the latter series only. Thus the theory of Pomtow that all the blocks belong to one building, a Tholos with a rec- tangular prodomos, must be discarded. Architectural Terms. - Three architectural terms occurring in Delian inscriptions are explained by F. CoURBY in B.C.H. XXXIV, 1910, pp. 501- 507. (1) IIpo'vI4iLuE OvpaL. This term in inscriptions referring to the temple of Apollo designates the doors in the prodomos and opisthodomos which were closed by grilles. (2) XOLVLK(S8C. The fact that these are some- times mentioned in pairs and that the main door of the temple of Apollo was furnished with eighty-eight of them shows that the term applies to the pivot as well as to the socket. Each valve of the door had twenty-two hinges, one in the sill, one in the lintel, and twenty placed along the jamb. (3) AlKtrva. This term used in connection with the wpovi~?ws OdpaL of the temple (rT 8LKrva rh &amp;ay~pacpqLva ivcr&amp;vo rv Ovp&amp;iv) designates a grille or "imposte fixe" placed above the doors. String Courses below Frescoes. - Certain small cornice-like mould- ings found in the sanctuary of Athena at Pergamon belong to the stoae of the sanctuary and originally marked off the lower part of the rear wall which was of marble from the upper part which was of a different material and was covered by stucco or frescoes. A similar arrangement occurs on walls of the first style at Pompeii. Here the lower wall consists of a course of orthostatai and two courses of wall blocks surmounted by a moulding.</page><page sequence="14">546 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCIHAEOLOGY [ VoL. XV, 1911 Above the latter the wall is painted a uniform color. In the Pinacotheca of the Athenian Propylaea a narrow band of Eleusinian stone forms a simi- lar division. The upper part of the wall which was not smoothed was in- tended to receive fresco paintings upon a coating of stucco. (W. I)DRPFELD, Ath. Mlitt. XXXVI, 1911, pp. 87-96; 4 figs.) SCTULPTTURE Conventions in Primitive Art. - In R. Et. Gr. XXIII, 1910, pp. 379- 401 (10 figs.), WV. DEONNA shows that there existed in primitive art certain conventions which have not been rightly understood. Thus a triangle might be used to represent the human body, the head, the nose, the foot, :: :::::;::.::-:i ;:::::;- :'::: :;-??-:: : ?:::: - ?_:i :::??__ :-:-:.:::::- :.-:g:: &amp;?: -:-::-: ;::::::::::::: :::-?-: :::i:::i FOIGURE 1.- MARBLE HEAD IN STOCKHOLM. the beard, or, when the upper part was curved, the eye. Two isosceles triangles were used for the hair, as in the Nicandra statue. Another convention was the use of the rectangle, especially to represent a draped figure, which explains the beam and pillar-like statues of women. The primitive figures ending in a point have left a trace in later art, for example, in the statue by Antenor on the Acropolis. The early manner of representing the ear may also be found in later art. A Parthenon Head.- A fragment of a Greek marble head in the Royal Museum at Stockholm (Fig. 1) is tenta- tively ascribed by J. Six (J.II.S. XXXI, 1911, pp. 65-71; 2 pls.; 5 figs.) to the pediments of the Parthenon, although the neck does not fit any of the exist- ing torsos. It is a female head, set straight on the shoulders but inclined slightly forward. Only the back hair with a confining net and holes for attaching a crown, and the left cheek, chin, and eye are preserved, but when the rest is filled out with plas- ter the effect of serene and noble loveliness is entirely consistent with what is known of other Parthenon fragments. From the measurements, this seems to have been placed slightly farther from the middle than the Laborde head. The Date of the Athena Parthenos.- In R. Et. Anc. XIII, 1911, pp. 125-136, H. LECIAT discusses the article by L. Pareti in R~im. Mitt. XXIV, pp. 271 ff. (A.J.A. XV, p. 229) concluding that the traditional view that the Parthenos was set up in 438 is correct, and that the Zeus at Olympia was made after the Parthenos.</page><page sequence="15">GREEK SCULPTURE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1911 5~47 The Statuette of Athena at Amalia. - At an open meeting of the Austrian Archaeological Institute in Athens, February 15, 1911, A. Schober discussed the torso of a statuette of Athena wearing the aegis found on the site of the city of Elis and now preserved in the village of Amalia. It is of pure white fine-grained Pentelic marble, which has acquired a light yellow tint in the course of time. The head, the left fore-arm and part of the right arm are gone; the rest is well preserved. The preserved part is 0.73 m. high; breadth of shoulders 0.24 m.; height of plinth 0.04 m. The part of the neck remaining shows that the head was turned slightly to the right. The weight is thrown chiefly upon the left leg, which stands firm, while the right leg, re- lieved of the weight, is slightly advanced. The drapery is very elaborate. First the figure wears a chiton with short sleeves, above which is a peplos of coarser material girt below the breast with a simple cord, while a mantle is loosely cast over the left shoulder. The gorgoneion and the scales of the aegis were not represented plastically, but were painted. Traces of red paint are still to be seen in various places. The work displays tech- nical mastery and a very care- ful hand, especially observable in the folds of the drapery and in the distinction between the different kinds of material. The flesh parts are polished until they have acquired a smooth and mirror-like surface. This torso helps to explain a series of replicas which recently have been much discussed, viz., the Medici torso and the two large replicas in Seville, all of which are copies of a celebrated work of the fifth century B.c. Hermnann, the finder of the Seville figures, brings them into relation with Agoracritus, the chief disciple of Phidias, while Amelung, with the aid of Attic coins and of a relief from Am- belokipi (preserved only in a drawing), connects them with Phidias himself, and considers that the Parthenos was the I FIGURE 2. -POLYCLITAN HEAD IN TIE BRITISH MUSEUM. original. The occasion for the making of this replica for Elis is not known, but the statuette is certainly of Attic import, as is seen not only from the workmanship, but also from the material. The Head of an Athlete. - In Ath. Mitt. XXXVI, 1911, pp. 193-197 (pl.), A. SCHOBER publishes a marble head of an athlete in the National Museum at Athens (461 in the catalogues of Kavvadias and Kastriotes). It is presumably a careful copy of a bronze original of the middle of the fifth century and of the Attic school, related to, but somewhat later than,</page><page sequence="16">548 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XV, 1911 the Riccardi and Perinthus heads, both of which the writer holds to be Myronian. A "Polyclitan " Head in the British Museum. - In J.H.S. XXXI, 1911, pp. 21-30 (2 pls.; fig.), E. A. GARDNER publishes and briefly discusses a marble head found at Apollonia in Epirus and now in the British Museum (Fig. 2), together with the various types of statues and heads in which Poly- clitan elements have been noted. This head, though a distinctly finer work, sufficiently resembles that of the Westmacott athlete to have its missing por- tions supplied by casts from that head, and the marked departure of both from the Polyclitan canon of proportions, especially in refining the lower part of the face, is much the same. The motive, as indicated by the raised right arm of the Barraco replica, may well have been a victor crowning him- self. On the whole, the head seems to be an Athenian work of the early fourth century, freely imitating in marble a fifth century athlete type which had been expressed in bronze by Polyclitus or his pupils. A Female Head in the Louvre. - In Mon. Plot, XVII, 1911, pp. 139-143 (2 pls.; fig.) M. COLLIGNON publishes a female head of Parian marble ac- quired by the Louvre in 1907. It is greater than life size, and was intended to be set into a body made separately. He thinks it a contemporary copy of a work by an Attic sculptor of the early part of the fourth century B.c. Old and New Niobids. - In Z. Bild. K. N. F. XXII, 1911, pp. 129-138 (19 figs.), B. SAUER shows that the Niobids discovered in recent years, that is, the dying daughter in Milan, and the fleeing daughter and dying son in Copenhagen, date from the fifth century B.c., and thus belong to an older group than the Niobids at Florence. In style they closely resemble the sculptures of the "Theseum" at Athens and an Athena from Pergamon in Berlin. The author of all these sculptures was a pupil of Myron, perhaps his son Lycius. The Maiden of Antium.-In ,Burl. Mag. XVIII, 1911, pp. 13-17 (2 figs.), E. LOEWY argues that the much discussed maiden from Antium (A.J.A. VIII, p. 307; XI, pp. 356, 460; XII, p. 224; XIV, pp. 222, 504) certainly represents a young girl. Like many other statues it was made to be seen from one point of view, in this case from the right, as is proved by the better workmanship, by the use of two kinds of marble for the two arms, and by the cut of the plinth. It is only when seen from the left that the head resembles that of a boy. He thinks that the statue was made about 300 B.c., but as yet he cannot attribute it to any known sculptor. Euphranor.--In Jb. Arch. L XXV, 1910, pp. 159-173 (3 pls.; 5 figs.), Miss M. BIEBER gives reasons for believing the bronze youth from Anticythera to be a copy of the Paris of Euphranor, as already suggested by Loeschcke and Stais, and discusses the position and characteristics of this artist as midway in development between Polyclitus and Lysippus. A large num- ber of fourth-century heads, which show some resemblance to the work of Praxiteles and Scopas, she ascribes to their less gifted and less original contemporary. The Heracles Epitrapezios of Lysippus.-In R. Arch. XVII, 1911, pp. 257-270, CHARLES PICARD discusses the Heracles Epitrapezios of Lysip- pus. Martial (Ep. IX, 43 and 44) does not intend to say that the bronze he describes has passed through the hands of Alexander, Hannibal, and Sulla. Statius (Silt. IV, 6) enlarges upon Martial. The figure was a Tyrian Hera-</page><page sequence="17">GREEK SCULPTURE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1911 549 cles.

The "Alexander with a Lance" may be dated about 334-333 B.c., the Heracles Epitrapezios a little later. It was probably a youthful Heracles, with the features of Alexander. Pos- sible copies are two marble statuettes in the Louvre and a fragmentary marble statuette found in 1904 in the establishment of the Poseidoniasts of Berytus at Delos. Agasias. - In B.C.H. XXXIV, 1910, pp. 538-548 (13 figs.), C. PICARD publishes, with facsimiles, thirteen inscriptions found at Delos with the sig- nature of the sculptor, 'Ayac'wa Mivo4b(Xov 'Ebcri~oo. (Nos. 1-4 = Loewy, Inschr. griech. Bildhauer, Nos. 287-290; Nos. 10-13 previously unpublished.) The statue of Billienus (No. 1) was probably executed before the year 100 B.c., that of Aropus (No. 7) about 91/90 B.c. Agasias collaborated with a cer- tain Eutychides, who is dated about the close of the second century B.c. Many of the statues by Agasias, for the most part portraits of Romans, were overthrown during the sack of Delos by Pontic troops, and later restored by Aristandros, son of Scopas, a Parian (cf. Nos. 1, 2, 4, 8). The Warrior of Delos. - In B.C.H. XXXIV, 1910, pp. 478-500 (2 pls.; 7 figs.), G. LEROUX supports the arguments of Wolters (Ath. Mitt. XV, 1890, pp. 188 ff.) that the pedestal with the signature 'Ayao'as Myvo (tXov 'EEm'oO cannot belong to the statue of the warrior of Delos. The metrical inscrip- tion mentioning Philetaerus and the sculptor Niceratus, brought into con- nection with the statue by Wolters, must also be rejected, since it is now shown to have belonged to a long, narrow pedestal which supported a row of bronze statues. Two fragments of the statue of the warrior have recently been discovered, the left shoulder and upper arm and a fragment of the chest with remains of the baldric. A marble head of a Gaul in the museum at Delos, which has been held to be that of the warrior, is too small (see A.J.A. XIV, 1910, p. 505). Another head, found in 1905, is too large and too realistic in style to be connected with the statue. A Portrait of Heraclitus.- A statue in Candia, found at Gortyna and published by Mariani (A.J.A. I, 1897, pp. 279 if.) is to be identified as a portrait of Heraclitus from its resemblance to a statue of that philosopher represented on late coins of Ephesus. The marble in Candia is a poor copy, executed about 200 A.D., of an original of the late fifth or early fourth cen- tury. The knotted staff which the figure held with the left hand was trans. formed by the copyist into a club. The same mistake was made by the engravers of the coins on which the attribute is held in the arm. (G. LIPPOLD, Ath. Mitt. XXXVI, 1911, pp. 153-156; pl.; fig.) The Frieze of the Treasury of "Cnidos" at Delphi.--In R. Arch. XVII, 1911, pp. 197-220 (4 figs.), FERNAND COURBY discusses the frieze of the treasury of "Cnidos," especially Heberdey's theories concerning it (Ath. Mitt. 1909, pp. 145-166; cf. Karo, ibid. pp. 167-168, and B.C.H. XXXIV, 1910, p. 210). He finds that the fragments ascribed by Homnolle to this treasury really belong to one building, but Homolle's arrangement of them is incorrect. The eastern front contained ten deities. The Aphro- dite of the western frieze is putting a necklace about her neck; the Athena is putting on her aegis. Each is acting in accordance with her nature. The Treasury of the Siphnians.-- In Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XIII, 1911,</page><page sequence="18">550 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XV, 1911 Beiblatt, cols. 277-280, A. SCHOBER discusses further the dimensions of the slabs of the treasury of the Siphnians (see ibid. cols. 81 ff., and A.J.A. XV, p. 227), and shows that the length of the frieze corresponds with that of the building south of the Sacred Way, commonly known as the Treasury of the Siphnians. He also argues that in the gigantomnachy the Athena slab should take the place of the Cybele slab in Homolle's arrangement. On the left of it was the opponent of Hephaestus and on the right, Ares and then Cybele. The Frieze of the Monument of Aemilius Paulus.- A detailed study of the costumes and armor of the figures on the frieze of the monument of Aemilius Paulus at Delphi makes it possible to distinguish the troops which fought on the Roman side at the battle of Pydna from those which served under Perseus. On all four faces of the pillar Roman and Samnite horse- men and Samnite foot soldiers are engaged with Thracian cavalry and Macedonians, identified by their elaborately decorated bronze shields (XaX- KaT7TLSEC). The frieze represents scenes from the opening skirmish on the banks of the stream Leucus, started, according to Livy, by a horse which escaped from the Roman camp and crossed the stream. The representation of this runaway horse on the north face of the frieze establishes the authen- ticity of the tale, which is not found in the Macedonian version preserved by Plutarch. The pillar is the one mentioned by Plutarch (Aem. 28, 2) as begun by Perseus and destined to support a golden statue of himself. (A. J. REINACH, B.C.H. XXXIV, 1910, pp. 433-468; 9 figs.) The Dionysus of the Janiculum.- The statue of the young Dionysus which was found in the sanctuary of the Syrian gods on the Janiculum in 1908 (see A.J.A. XIII, 1909, pp. 361-362; XIV, 1910, p. 116; XV, 1911, p. 98), was described and warmly praised by A. Trendelenburg at the No- vember (1909) meeting of the Berlin Archaeological Society. He dates the original in the fourth century B.c. and thinks that the gilding on face and hands must have come from the hair and the thyrsus, as such partial gilding of a nude statue seems impossible. (Arch. Anz. 1910, cols. 520-523.) The Identification of the Figures of the Pergamon Reliefs. - In Hermes, XLVI, 1911, pp. 217-249 (8 figs.), C. ROBERT proposes several new interpretations for the figures of the reliefs from the great altar at Perga- mon. Puchstein's Oceanus and Doris he thinks should be identified as Hephaestus and Eurynome, a sea goddess. PY, on a piece of the cornice, seems to belong to this name. The deities on the right of the stairs have to do with Dionysus, and NY should be restored as Ni[paLs], and 4 as [CXlvo]s. Puchstein's Rhea is probably to be identified as Semele (the two broken letters of the name probably being EA), while the real Rhea is the goddess riding on a lion just around the corner. The eagle with the thunderbolt behind her symbolizes her relation to Zeus. In front of Rhea are Oceanus and Tethys, who, with Astraeus and Eos, are in combat with the giant Achelous. The god struggling with the lion-headed giant is Pallas, and the winged god next to him is his brother Perses. On the northeast corner are the three Fates, partly identified through the inscriptions KXO[w] and ['Arporr]ov. Between Night and the Fates were Callisto, Heniochus, and Ophiuchus struggling with a giant. Night, her three daughters, and the stars thus occupied most of the northern side of the altar. On the eastern side Heracles must have occupied four slabs and his wife Hebe one. Then came her mother, Hera, the first letter of whose name still remains.</page><page sequence="19">GREEK SCULPTURE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1911 551 The letters B H should be restored as ['H] fly. Beyond Hera was a chariot, Iris, Hermes, and their opponents. Of the fragmentary inscriptions, EY should be restored as Ev[pos], the name of one of the winged horses of Iris. NYQ must be restored ['E]vvo. This was probably a diminutive figure on block A Y, i.e. near Ares. On the missing slab between the Zeus and Athena groups was Athena's owl fighting against the same giant as the eagle of Zeus. Reliefs on Public Decrees. - At an open meeting of the Austrian Archaeological Institute in Athens, February 15, 1911, DI)r. Walter discussed the reliefs on public decrees. One stele relating to tribute paid to Athens has a relief representing Athena seated by a heap of sacks and amphorae. Cities are represented by divinities, as Athena for Athens, Hera for Samos, the Parthenos for Neapolis in Thrace, Heracles for Heraclea, Aphrodite for Cnidus, Apollo for Apollonia; or by animals, as a ram for Clazomenae, a horse for Syracuse, etc. These reliefs are important for the history of sculpture because they can usually be dated. A Hellenistic Relief at Genoa.- A Hellenistic relief in the Palazzo Bianco at Genoa is described by G. E. RIzzo in Rom. Mitt. XXV, 1910, pp. 298-304 (pl.). Athena is represented spurning the offer of a flute from a satyr. The source is probably Asia Minor, the date second century A.D. A History of Greek Sculpture. --An important contribution to the series of handbooks issued by the American Book Company is Professor Richardson's History of Greek Sculpture. In the space of 280 pages he gives a concise account of the subject from Mycenaean times to the Hellenistic period, introducing much more detail than would be thought possible in so small a compass. The illustrations are good, and include a number which have not yet generally found their way into the handbooks. (A History of Greek Sculpture. By RuFus B. RICHARDSON, formerly Director of the Ameri- can School of Classical Studies at Athens. New York, 1911, American Book Company. 291 pp.; 131 figs.) A Reminiscence of Alcibiades.--In 'AvE$dprTros 'AO9rv^v, I, 1911, pp. 52, 59, 67-68 (3 figs.), I. N. SVORONOs publishes a carved block of mar- ble, 0.35 m. high, 1.51 m. long, and 0.32 m. wide, found about fifty years ago in the so-called Valerian wall east of the Tower of the Winds. On the top is a cutting which once supported a stele. On the best preserved of the two long sides were eight unbridled horses in pairs, each with a groom. Those at the right have been destroyed, and part of the pair at the left. On the narrow end which is best preserved is a race horse facing to the right; the other end has been broken off. On the other long side, which was origi- nally the front, were about nine standing figures. All are badly hammered, but three men wearing the chlamys can still be made out, one apparently in the act of crowning himself. The stone may be dated from the style of the figures in the latter part of the fifth century. The writer argues that upon this base once stood a stele commemorating the Olympic victories won by Alcibiades in 420 B.c. and his victories at Delphi and Nemea. (See also T5 iv 'A9dvaLn 'EOvuyV Movo-Eov, pp. 464-469; 3 figs.) The Bronzes of Mahdia. - In Mon. Piot, XVII, 1909, pp. 29-57 (3 pls.; 5 figs.) A. MERLIN and L. POINSSOT discuss several of the bronzes found in the sea off Mahdia (A.J.A. XIII, pp. 102 f., 374; XIV, pp. 248, 388 f.; XV, pp. 112 f.). 1. The large Eros they think is a contemporary copy of an</page><page sequence="20">552 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XV, 1911 Eros holding his bow by Praxiteles, described by Callistratus, an identifica- tion since confirmed by the finding of the missing left arm with the bow (see A.J.A. XV, p. 113). 2. The Dionysus of Boethus shows that the artist could reproduce with a certain amount of liberty an archaic figure like the Hermes Propylaeus of Alcamenes, and likewise shows his skill in emphasizing striking details. 3. The two cornice heads belong together and represent Dionysus and Ariadne. They are of Hellenistic date, but the purpose for which they were intended is not clear. 4. The statuette of an Hermaphro- dite engaged in a torch race was used as a lamp. The head and upper part of the body held oil which ran down through the arm into the torch in the left hand. The origin of the type may be found in the Hermaphrodite carry- ing a torch in certain Dionysiac scenes. 5. An Eros found in 1909 is very similar to the Hermaphrodite and was used for the same purpose. In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1911, pp. 206-210, A. MERLIN and L. POINSSOT argue that the bronze cornices found in the sea near Mahdia originally decorated one of the sacred triremes of Athens. Three of the five inscriptions found in the wreck were originally set up at the Piraeus in sanctuaries dedicated to the heroes for whom the two sacred triremes were named. The writers argue that among the spoils carried off from Athens by Sulla were the decorations of the two sacred triremes, as evidence to the Romans of the complete sub- jugation of Athens. Kneeling Worshippers. - In Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XIII, 1911, Beiblatt, cols. 229-244 (10 figs.), O. WALTER publishes a series of nine Attic reliefs of the fourth century B.C., in which a worshipper kneels on the ground before a divinity. He shows that the deities represented are chthonic and the object of the kneeling was to get as near the god as possible. The Greeks usually prayed standing. A Bronze &amp;yvpr4s. --In Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XIII, 1911, pp. 167-175 (3 figs.), P. DUCATI publishes a bronze statuette in Bologna representing a man with coarse features, almost nude, dancing and playing the castanets. He argues that it represents an yvp,-rj, or mountebank, and is of Roman date, influenced by the so-called Alexandrian art. Two Marbles in Candia.--In R. Arch. XVII, 1911, pls. VI and VII reproduce by the LumiBre (of Lyons) process of color photography two marbles in the museum at Candia (Jh. Oest. Arch. I. VI, 1903, pl. I and p. 9; A.J.A. 1897, p. 274). The photographs were made by the Abbd Archambault. In the text, by S. REINACH (pp. 433-435), the results of the process are criticized. VASES AND PAINTING Late Minoan Vase Painting. - Some Cretan vases from Cyprus in the British Museum are published by E. J. FORSDYKE in J.H.S. XXXI, 1911, pp. 110-118 (5 figs.), with reflections on the historical connection of Minoan and Mycenaean art. He suggests that at the end of the prosperous period in Crete known as Late Minoan I, the encroachments of Cnossus drove the inhabitants of many lesser towns across the seas to settle in Greece, Rhodes, and elsewhere; that their descendants preserved the naturalistic art which they brought with them in a degenerate form contemporary with, but un- affected by the brilliant Later Palace style of Cnossus in Late Minoan II; and returned to overthrow their old enemies and restore their old homes in</page><page sequence="21">GREEK VASES] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1911 553 Late Minoan III, bringing with them the technically advanced but artisti- cally inferior style of pottery which at that time seems to revive in Crete the motives of Late Minoan I. The shaft graves of Mycenae would then belong to the time of the great migration, and the later tholos tombs, con- taining genuine imported Minoan pottery, indicate a continued intercourse of the nobles only with the mother country, not of the people. Cyprus seems, however, not to have been colonized directly from Crete, but indirectly from the Minoan centres of Rhodes or other places. Mycenaean Rhytons.- At an open meeting of the German Archaeo- logical Institute in Athens December 7, 1910, G. Karo tried to explain the silver bull's head and the lion's head of gold from Mycenae as rhytons. On the former the double axe above the horns is a false restoration, as the steatite head from Cnossus shows. The Cretan head is clearly influenced by metal technique, and belongs to the same period and was made under the same influence as the Mycenaean head. The golden lion also has its Cretan analogy in marble. Like the pointed Cretan vase, illustrated by the fresco of the professional cup bearers, which most probably had a small hole in the bottom, the two heads from Mycenae, also with holes in the muzzle, were drinking cups. A Group of Ionic Vases.- In Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XIII, 1911, pp. 150-166 (2 pls.; 7 figs.), W. KLEIN shows that an amphora in Wuirzburg with the rescue of Aeneas on the shoulder, an amphora in Berlin (No. 2154) and a hydria in the Naples museum (Heydemann, No. 2781) constitute a group by themselves, and are Ionic, not Etruscan. Incidentally he shows that the relief from Aricia in Copenhagen does not represent Orestes slaying Cly- taemnestra, but Menelaus and Helen in the house of Deiphobus. It is a Roman copy of an archaic Ionic original, and in style bears some resem- blance to these vases. Epinetron and Loom.- In Ath. Mitt. XXXVI, 1911, pp. 145-152 (4 figs.), C. BLINKENBERG shows that an epinetron published by Xanthoudides, ibid. XXXV, 1911, pp. 323 if., as of the late Mycenaean period, is a local Rhodian product of the fifth century imitated from Athenian models. On another epinetron, published ibid. p. 324, occurs one of the rare ancient repre- sentations of an upright loom with which a Scandinavian loom in the museum at Copenhagen has been compared. The comparison is just, in spite of the objections of Kimakowicz-Winicki, Spinn- und Webewerkzeuge, pp. 36 ff. Vases in the British Museum. - Eight black-figured Greek vases and two later craters, acquired by the British Museum since 1898, are published by H. B. WALTERS in J.H.S. XXXI, 1911, pp. 1-20 (16 figs.). They are: I. An early Attic cylix, of style midway between "proto-Attic" and "Tyr- rhenian," which shows Oriental influence and has animal friezes, but differs from similar Corinthian fabrics in the deep red clay and lustrous black paint. This example has a unique ornament on the inside, a complicated rosette formed of lotus and palmettes. II. Cotyle from Boeotia, of rare form. On both sides, Heracles, seated and resting after his labors, is served with wine by Athena. A satyr an~d goat in each scene have suggested a connection with the satyr drama. III. Lecythus with murder of Priam. Neoptolemus plunges his spear into the body of the king, who is seated on an altar, in the presence of two Trojan women and two Greek warriors.</page><page sequence="22">554 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XV, 1911 Astyanax is not present. IV. Lecythus from Laconia, of peculiar pyxis- shaped body, painted with a sacrifice to Athena. The goddess is seated before a blazing altar to which three worshippers bring offerings and lead up a bull. Columns indicate a temple. Not earlier than 500 B.c. V. Lecythus from Sicily, buff slip, with unique scene of the capture of Silenus. The satyr is reclining in a well-house and drinking from the spout, while an armed guard on the roof of the house is ready to seize and bind him, and two seated figures under the shade of palm trees look on at right and left. All other pictures of the story represent later stages, after the capture. The spring mixed with wine, which was originally in Macedonia but later set in Phrygia, was named Inna, and the motive of the capture, says Aristotle, was Midas's wish to be instructed by the satyr. VI. Lecythus from Thebes; capture of Thetis by Peleus, with a fish-and-lion monster, representing two of the transformations of Thetis, perched on Peleus's back. Not earlier than 500 B.c. VII. Pyxis from Boeotia, on which, if the present state is not misleading, three techniques occur: black on red, white on red, and black on white. The top has three riders with legs doubled up and heads joined in a kind of trisceles scheme. Similar horsemen with other figures form a frieze around the deep side of the cover, which fits down over the plain box. VIII. Lecythus of the end of the black-figured period, with device painted in dull colors on black ground. A seated woman is holding a frame on which threads are stretched, while her wool basket stands before her. Only one other instance is known of the hand loom in vase paintings. IX. Boeotian calix crater, with flying Victory on one side and Athena in a quadriga on the other. Dull colors of clay and paint and poor drawing. This and the following number are contemporary local imitations of late Attic ware. X. Camnipanian bell crater with scene from a torch race in which the competitor is mounted on a white horse and attended by two youths also bearing torches. The mounted torch bearers on Tarentine coins show that such contests, though originating in Attica in the fifth cen- tury, were not unknown in Magna Graecia. (For an earlier report, see J.H.S. XVIII, 1898, pp. 281-301.) The Aristonous Vase.--In Me'l. Arch. Hzst. XXXI, 1911, pp. 33-74 (2 pls.; 3 figs.), P. DUCATI discusses the crater signed by Aristonous. He discusses the form of the name, and decides for 'ApLatrdvooV, in preference to ApLoTrdvoOo or 'ApwTr6vocbos. He then compares the decoration with that of other vases, and finds that the influence of the early Attic style is very marked, but that the vase is not Attic. Finally he concludes that it was made in Italy, probably at Cumae, in the seventh century B.C. Cothons and Similar Types.-In J.H.S. XXXI, 1911, pp. 72-99 (20 figs.), R. M. BURROWS and P. N. URE discuss the vases with turned-in rim, like a safety inkstand, which have wrongly been called cothons. The large number of such vases now available through the finds at Rhitsdna in Boeotia make possible a new classification and enumeration and tend to discredit E. Pernice's explanation of them all as censers (Jb. Arch. L. 1899, pp. 60-72). Rather, the larger number seem to have been lamps for one or more floating or otherwise upright wicks, being a sort of link in the Corinthian period between the large Minoan lamps and the Attic bridge-nozzled lamps; while some of the covered ones may have been perfume vessels and those of metal censers.</page><page sequence="23">GREEK VASES] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1911 555 The Haeberlin Collection. - Fifteen Greek and Italian vases and a terra-cotta relief from the Haeberlin collection at Eschersheim near Frank- fort are described by R. PAGENSTECHER in Arch. Anz. 1910, cols. 456-469 (10 figs.). The pictures include an offering to Hermes in black and purple on white; two beautiful scenes of victorious contestants, one a singer, on a red-figured mixing-jar; a red-figured scene of sacrifice to Apollo, where the pieces of flesh are being brought to be burnt before a small archaic figure of the god standing on a high pillar; a woman carrying offerings to a tomb, on a white lecythus; Heracles about to shoot the Stymphalian birds and acclaimed by Nike, and an attempted murder in which a woman begs her life of the intending slayer, both on an Etruscan scyphus. An Apulian stamnus of late red-figured technique is topped by a small Gnathia vase as cover-knob. The relief of a seated mourning woman seems to be a model for a relief in metal, perhaps a mirror or jar-cover or an emblem for the middle of a basin. Most of the pieces are from the Hamburger collection. Clazomenian Sarcophagi.- In B.C.H. XXXIV, 1910, pp. 469-477 (2 pls.; 2 figs.), C. DUGAS publishes three sarcophagi of children with simple and carelessly executed designs (one in the Louvre; two in Constan- tinople) and four fragments of larger sarcophagi in Smyrna. The top of a sarcophagus (No. 4), decorated with a palmette-lotus design between two sphinxes, belongs to group IV in the classification of Prinz, 'Funde aus Naukratis' (Klio, Beiheft VII, pp. 33-42). Athenian Painting.- Starting with the Dionysiac scenes on a well- known Attic vase at Naples, A voN SALIS discusses in Jb. Arch. I. XXV, f- d~k d I ?- ;r* i Z =.. b'B.C ??;-- OB FIGURE 3. - PAINTING ON A VASE IN NAPLES. 1910, pp. 126-147 (pl.; 8 figs.), the traditions of monumental painting at Athens in the latter part of the fifth century B.c., especially the pictures in the new temple of Dionysus Eleuthereus, of which Pausanias gives a scanty list, as they come down to us through vase paintings, reliefs, and Pompeian frescoes. He finds the truest representation of the ancient work in such a picture as the Death of Pentheus in the Casa dei Vettii, but the spirit and abandon of the composition better shown in the painting on the Naples vase (Fig. 3). Toward the end of the century there seems to have been a</page><page sequence="24">556 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XV, 1911 revival of interest in the more savage aspects of the Dionysiac myth, of which the Bacchae of Euripides was a part, and also a new intensity of emotional expression in painting, to which the legend that Parrhasius used to sing at his work bears witness. The Marsyas Religatus of Zeuxis. --In Rend. Ace. Lincei, XIX, 1910, pp. 887-932, A. CAPUTI supplements B6ttiger's and Michaelis's studies of the Marsyas myth, distinguishing lyric, dithyrambic, and tragic forms of the story, as influenced by Attic jealousy of Boeotia. The Hyginus form of the myth, differing in some particulars from that in Apollodorus, is derived, he thinks, from a satyr-drama, almnost certainly by Euripides, and this drama gave Zeuxis a subject for a famous painting, which Philostratus (Imnag. 2) describes and of which Pliny (N.H. XXXV, 10, 66) speaks as a Marsyas religatus. An analysis of this hypothetical play is given (Caputi thinks Euripides first made the Muses judges of the contest and added the character of Olympus), and the extant monuments, plastic, ceramic, and painted, are classified and discussed as casting light on play and painting. The Marsyas group of the Forum was an attempt to repro- duce this painting in marble. The article ends with an attempt to group the figures in this supposed painting of Zeuxis. The Work of Apelles.- The gold portrait medallion of Alexander from Aboukir, which was interpreted by H. Thiersch as copied from the Alexander with a Spear of Lysippus (Jb. Arch. I, 1908, pp. 163; A.J.A. 1909, p. 494), is again discussed, by J. Six, in Jb. Arch. I, XXV, 1910, pp. 147- 159 (fig.). He thinks it taken from an otherwise unknown portrait bust by Apelles, the official portrait painter of the king; his arguments being that the large eye, the full-face view, and the placing of the attributes of shield and spear close beneath the chin are all characteristics of painted portraits, but inconsistent with the supposition of copying from a statue by Lysippus. The general scheme, in which the shield is especially prominent, was used through a long line of imperial portrait medallions down to the late Byzantine emperors, and some member of this series, perhaps about the time of Gallienus, must have been the model for Rembrandt's Glasgow and St. Petersburg Minervas, in which the motive again appears in the original medium. Incidentally, the relation of Dutch and Flemish painting to the antique is discussed, and a plea is made for freedom in provisionally assign- ing known works to known artists of antiquity. INSCRIPTIONS An Interpretation of the Phaestus Disk.-- In Burl. Mag. XVIII, 1911, pp. 23-38, appears a new reading of the Phaestus disk by Miss F. M. STAWELL (see A.J.A. XV, p. 234). The reading was worked out without reference to the Cypriote syllabary, but shows many points of correspondence with it. The signary is partly syllabic and partly alphabetic. Miss Stawell reads the inscription from the circumference of the disk inwards, and believes that the disk itself is a matrix for the casting of liturgical cymbals. The in- scription, according to her reading, forms itself into a hymn to Athena, in dochmiac metre with strophe and antistrophe. The cymbals were thus inscribed with the words of the hymn, by way of guiding the worshipper while he used them in his devotions, thus constituting a kind of "portable psalm-book."</page><page sequence="25">GREEK INSC.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1911 557 Inscriptions in the Cypriote Syllabary, but not in Greek.- In Sitzb. Berl. Akad., 1911, pp. 166-169 (pl.), R. MEISTER publishes two inscrip- tions which have come to light in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford. Of their origin nothing is recorded, but they are evidently Cypriote. The language in which they are written is, however, not Greek, nor is it Phoeni- cian. The characters are those of the Cypriote syllabary. Cypriote Inscriptions.- In Sitzb. Sachs. Ges. LXII, 1910 (No. 8), pp. 233-247 (3 pls.), RICHARD MEISTER (' Beitriige zur griechischen Epigraphik und Dialektologie IX') publishes and discusses eight Cypriote inscriptions. The first is the inscription from Athienu, now in the Metropolitan Museum in New York, the front of which was first published by Cesnola, Cyprus, P1. V (Taf. CI of the German translation). The back is inscribed with a list of prices. The second inscription is transliterated Tq.LOdya6s VjtL &amp; TLMo&amp;4wLv. It is from Marion-Arsinoe. The remaining inscriptions are brief epitaphs and dedications from Rantidi. Attic Treasure Records.- Three more of the fragments lying in the Epigraphical Museum at Athens are discussed by A. M. WOODWARD in J.H.S. XXXI, 1911, pp. 31-41. They are a piece of the pronaos treasure record for the year 431-430 B.C. (C.I.G. I, 120), which shows the exact number of phialae in the chamber during the years 434-430; and two pieces of the Hecatompedon record for the years 432-431 and 431-430 (1. G. I, 143, 144), one of which shows that I.G. I, 147, with the beginning of the record of a new penteteris, 430-426, was on the same face of the same stone as the above. Double Datings in Attic Decrees.- In Sitzb. Berl. Akad. 1910, pp. 982-988, U. v. WVILAMOWITZ-MOELLENDORFF discusses the double datings (Kar' .pXovra and KacT 9edv) in Attic decrees of years in which there were intercalated months (1.G. 11, 5, 733; II, Add. 238 b; II, Add. 320 b; II, 381; II, 433; II, 5, 451 b 9; II, 408; II, 437; II, 471, 1; II, 471, 50; also II, 408, and II, 437). He offers an arrangement of days for the twelve months, and finds that in the years in which double datings were used, the date KaT' O~6v had the preference. A Decree in Honor of a Merchant.--In Ath. Mitt. XXXVI, 1911, pp. 73-86, A. v. PREMERSTEIN publishes a fragmentary Athenian decree honoring a metic who, on two occasions about the year 175 B.c., had helped to increase the finances of the state by selling it first a quantity of grain, and later a large amount of oil at an especially low price. These com- modities the state apparently disposed ot at a profit. Inscriptions from Delphi.-In B.C.H. XXXV, 1911, pp. 149-176 (pl.), E. BOURGUET discusses (1) the inscriptions on one of the two bases which supported dedications of the Liparaeans. To the two slabs already known five new slabs are to be added. The base bore, in addition to the archaic inscription on its top surface, [At7rapato]L r [Crd]X[XovL] 8[EKdrav a]jr7 Tvpoav[8v], a second inscription on the front face in letters 0.17 mn. high, finely carved in the style of the fourth century. This is to be restored [AL7ra]p [aot] d[Cr[] T [v]pa [aviv]. The spacing of the letters shows that the base was at least 20 m. long, though not necessarily in one straight line. It is tentatively brought into connection with a foundation 13 m. long, and of adequate width, lying west of the stoa of the Athenians. It is argued further that the Theban treasury is to be located in the southwest corner</page><page sequence="26">558 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XV, 1911 of the precinct. (2) A newly discovered fragment of the inscription on the pedestal of a statue dedicated by the Spartan king Pausanias, in honor of his son Agesipolis, confirms the restoration of the couplet by Wilhelm and Pomntow, and gives the name of the sculptor, [KX]owv. (3) An inscrip- tion, hitherto unpublished, is on the base of a statue probably of Theodotus, a general of Philopator. (4) Thirteen decrees for the Aetolians carved on one base (Homolle, B.C.H. XXI, 1897, pp. 407-412), and ranging in date from the fourth century to 145 B.c., were all inscribed at the latter date. (5) A new fragment of the Greek inscription on the base of M. Minucius Rufus is published, and the whole inscription restored. It is uncertain whether this belongs with the two Latin inscriptions, or whether there were two statues. Inscriptions from Syros.--In Ath. Mitt. XXXVI, 1911, pp. 157-162, (fig.), T. SAUCIUc publishes an inscription from Syros, now in Athens, commemorating a certain Attalus and his wife, as holders of the priestly office of ApXwv orebavrpbdpos and dLpXcl' at Syros during the reign of An- toninus Pius. It is one of a class of inscriptions from that island published by Klon Stephanos, 'A6dvatov, III, 1874, pp. 526 ff., and in 'E'itypafari 7TV vviov Zhpov, Athens, 1875, pp. 14 ff., = L G. XII, 5, 659-668. Laodice Philadelphus of Pontus. - An inscription in honor of Laodice (Aao8siiov T)V ftCLaXWX ~LapVdKOU Ka ML pas8Crov dE4~V), found at Delos, is published by T. RELN'ACa in B.C.H. XXXIV, 1910, pp. 429-431. She is to be identified with the queen of Pontus, Laodice Philadelphus, sister and wife of Mithradates IV, and is represented with the latter on a silver tetra- drachm published in R. Num. 1902, pp. 52-65. An Inscription from Thermon. - In Klio, X, 1910, pp. 397-405, H. SWOBODA shows that the important inscription found by Soteriades at Thermon (see 'E . 'ApX. 1905, pp. 56 ff.), which records an alliance between the Acarnanians and the Aetolians, is to be dated between 272 and 265 B.c., i.e. between the death of Pyrrhus and the outbreak of the Chremonidean war. Inscriptions from Thessaly and Macedonia. - Eleven inscriptions from Thessaly and Macedonia are published by J. HATZFELD in B.C.H. XXXV, 1911, pp. 231-240. No. 1, found at the base of the walls of Atrax, is a manumission inscription which modifies the list of Thessalian strategoi established by Kroog, defoederis Thessalorum praetoribus, and Kern, I.G. IX, 2, pp. xxiv-xxv. No. 8 is an epitaph in four hexameters, to be dated not later than 500 B.c. An Honorary Inscription. - In Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XIII, 1911, pp. 200- 209 (fig.), A. v. PREMERSTEIN discusses a Greek inscription from Ala- banda in Caria, now in Braunsberg, East Prussia. It is an honorary inscription dating from the time of Trajan, and records the various offices held by a certain L. Aburnius. Curses on Lead Tablets. --In Arch. Rel. XLV, 1911, pp. 143-158 (fig.), A. ABT publishes five inscribed lead tablets in Munich. Two of these are unintelligible; the others are curses or defixiones. One is inscribed with curses on both sides. COINS Interpretation of Greek Coin-Types.- The types of Greek coins that show heroes embarking in or disembarking from ships, or otherwise stand-</page><page sequence="27">GREEK MISC.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1911 559 ing in some relation to ships, are analyzed and elucidated by F. Inhoor- BLUMER (Nomisma, V, 1910, pp. 25-42; 2 pls.). Some earlier attributions of names are rejected (especially Aeneas), and fifteen new ones assigned. A second part of the same essay deals with the types of athletes and agono- thetae with prize-wreaths. Re-attribution of Certain Tetradrachms of Alexander the Great. - In A. J. Num. XLV, 1911, pp. 1-10 (7 pis.), EDWARD T. NEWELL begins the publication of a series of articles in which he traverses various conclusions of L. MULLER in his Numismatique d'Alexandre le Grand (Copenhagen, 1855), and proposes a new classification of the coins concerned. Greek Gold Coinage. - In Ber. Kunsts. XXXII, 1911, cols. 150-154 (6 figs.), K. REGLING discusses briefly Greek gold coinage. GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Mycenaean Rings. - In Kunstchr. XXII, April 28, 1911, col. 383, E. WALDMANN reports that at a meeting of the Imperial German Archaeo- logical Institute at Athens, March 8, 1911, V. Staes showed that some of the gold rings from the shaft graves at Mycenae are not the product of pure mainland art, but were inspired by Cretan carvings in ivory. Such, for example, is the case with the famous ring representing women engaged in religious rites in the presence of a double axe and a deity. The ivory reliefs found at Mycenae were Cretan imports, and were copied by the Mycenaean gem engravers. The Ivory and Bone Carvings from Sparta. - At a meeting of the British School at Athens, January 27, 1911, R. M. Dawkins traced the artistic development in the long series of ivory and bone carvings (ranging from the eighth to the sixth century B.C.) found on the site of the sanctuary of Artemis Orthia at Sparta. In the earliest of the ivories the drawing is stiff, and there is little or no modelling. Those of the next period (about 700 B.c.) are marked by deeper relief and elaborate incised surface-decora- tion, which compensates for the lack of modelling. The culmination (seventh century) is marked by freer drawing and more developed model- ling. After about 600, ivory is exchanged for bone, and there is a tendency to cut away the background, leaving the figures free, though the relief tech- nique survives in many cases. This development holds good for all the classes of carvings (fibula-plaques, combs, seals, etc.), showing that, by whatever foreign influences the art may have been affected, the objects are, with some few exceptions, indigenous. (Athen. February 11, 1911, p. 169.) Delphinius. - In Klio, XI, 1911, pp. 1-25, W. ALY calls attention to the precinct of Delphinius at Miletus. It was 50 by 61 m. in extent, with a cir- cular foundation, which may have supported a wooden structure, near the centre. It also had a great altar and smaller altars dedicated to Zeus Soter, Artemis and Hecate, but no cult temple. The precinct lay outside the early town, but near the centre of the later city. The writer argues that Del- phinius was a Cretan deity, and that his sanctuary at Miletus was founded by Cretans. His name may be a translation, but is perhaps connected with Tilphosa. He was worshipped in the open air like other gods in prehistoric Greece. The idea of a temple was not Greek, but came from abroad, per- haps from Egypt. An unfortified Cretan settlement was made at Athens</page><page sequence="28">560 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XV, 1911 in very early times, and another at Miletus about 1400 B.c. Side by side with these were other settlements made by Greeks, the one at Athens dating from Mycenaean times, and that at Miletus not later than 800 B.c. The two races became united. Athena, as well as Delphinius, came from Crete. Notes on Cybbd. --In R. E.t. Anc. XIII, 1911, pp. 75-78, G. RADET argues further in support of his theory that Cybdb6, Artemis Anaitis, and the goddess known in the time of the Antonines as Core are the same. TpLTo?arapEts. - The minor Attic divinities called TpLrorarpeZs, which were hardly understood in later antiquity and have not been satisfactorily interpreted by modern scholars, are discussed by G. LIPPOLD in Ath. Mitt. XXXVI, 1911, pp. 105-109. The clearest statement about them is in Harpocration s.v. TpLoraodrope: ~LdvoL 'A~rLvatoL Ovdovo' TE KaL EAXov7TaL aVTOL9 rTp yv~eoEW 7alowv, oTrav yaZdv pAX~wocv. The Athenians prayed to them for raiZse yvwo'o. A rais rpLro7EVV) is thus a ?rail yvvmoo, as Athena TpLroy4~lea is the "genuine" daughter of Zeus. The TpLronarpeiZ are then the "genuine" ancestors. The Cordax in the Cult of Dionysus. - In R. Arch. XVII, 1911, pp. 1-5 (fig.), MARCELLE AZRA HINCKs publishes the drawing on a Corin- thian aryballus found at Cumae (British Museum, A 1437), on which figures dancing the cordax are represented. The dance antedates the introduction of the cult of Dionysus at Corinth, and was perhaps originally associated with the cult of Artemis. One of the figures on this vase wears a panther skin. This is the earliest representation of the cordax in connection with the cult of Dionysus. The Antiquities of Andros. - At a meeting of the Austrian Archaeo- logical Institute in Athens, January 18, 1911, T. Sauciuc gave a brief sum- mary of the history of Andros, together with a description of the present appearance of the island and remains there. The old harbor of Andros, the modern Gausion, is still in use, and parts of the ancient moles are to be seen under water. The site of the ancient city is occupied by the modern Palae- opolis, some four hours distant from the harbor. Upon the side of the acropolis, which is turned toward Kuvara, very slight traces of the ancient fortifications are still evident, among them remains of the foundations of the walls, and of one of the bastions, some 8 m. in diameter, called "Pyr- gos" by the natives. Lower down are ruins of an ancient gateway, near which is a considerable stretch of well-preserved terrace-wall of marble blocks. This, then, is probably the site of the chief part of the city, a view supported by the fact that a number of inscriptions have been discovered in this vicinity. Several of these are yet unpublished. One is a decree, to be dated shortly before 388 B.c., bestowing honors upon a certain Antidotus, son of Antiphanes, because he had furnished grain cheaply to Andros (see Ath. Mitt. XXXVI, 1911, pp. 1-20). To the same period belongs a proxeny decree, as yet unpublished. A later inscription, from the time of the Per- gamene dominion, shows that although autonomous and free in practically all respects, Andros must still pay a tax and furnish a military contingent. This inscription, belonging to the beginning of the second century B.c., mentions a man, whose name is lost, who first became phylax (probably of the prytany), and then led a body of troops to Asia Minor in accordance with instructions from Attalus I. It mentions incidents of the third Syrian war, in which the city of Thymbria in the Troad took the Pergamenian side</page><page sequence="29">GREEK MISC.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1911 561 and opposed the Syrian king Antiochus, when he led his army to the Troad to lay waste the territory of the Attalids and their allies. Another inscrip- tion, an honorary decree for a gymnasiarch, shows Andros at that time still loyal to the Attalids. The last inscription, from Roman times, tells us that the evocatus Augustorum, M. Aurelius Rufinus, with three others of the prae- torians, had a speleum erected to the deus sanctus invictus, for the welfare of L. Sept. Severus and his two sons. This deus sanctus invictus is the Persian sun-god Mithra, whose worship was in such vogue with the Roman soldiery at that time. The inscription is probably to be connected with the Parthian expedition of the emperor. It is noteworthy that here, too, the name of Geta was later erased. There are also two unpublished statues: one, an Artemis of the Hellenistic period and of the Amazon type, bears a marked resemblance to an Artemis now in the Palazzo Rospigliosi at Rome; the other is an archaic "Apollo" of the same type as the well-known Ptoan "Apollo." In addition to these, there were found two beautiful sarcopha- gus reliefs of the Eros-Thanatos type. The Excavations in the Ceramicus. - In IIpawKLKa for 1909, published 1911, pp. 105-112, A. BRUECKNER discusses briefly his excavations in the Ceramicus (see A.J.A. XV, pp. 87 f.), explaining the change in levels. The Heracleum in Melite.-- In Ath. Mitt. XXXVI, 1911, pp. 113-144 (2 pls.; 4 figs.), A. FRICKENHAUS disputes Dorpfeld's identification of the sanctuary excavated by him west of the Athenian Acropolis as the A?ovv'oov iv Ac'wvars, on the ground that a sanctuary which was opened only in Feb- ruary would not contain a wine-press. The square foundation which sup- ported four small columns shows that the precinct was a Heroon, and the existence of a number of reliefs (one in Boston, cf. A.J.A. VII, 1903, p. 85) and vase paintings in which Heracles is shown standing beside or seated in a similar structure, points to the conclusion that it was dedicated to that divinity. It can thus be no other than the sanctuary of Heracles in Melite, the only known Heracleum within the city walls of Athens. Notes on the Persian Wars.--In J.H.S. XXXI, 1911, pp. 101-109, M. O. B. CASPARI offers some suggestions on a few still disputed points in the history of the Persian wars. He gives strong reasons for rejecting Lolling's identification of Marathona as the ancient Marathon, and preferring Leake's earlier selection of Vrana, with the Heracleumrn on the site of the modern Hagios Georgios, where the annual festival is still attended by visitors from all Attica. The recorded weakening of the Athenian centre may be ex- plained by the nature of the ground in front of Vrana, and the great haste of the Athenians in forcing the battle and marching home without any rest after it, by the fact that the Persian fleet had already sailed for Athens before the battle. Other points touched upon are the dependence of Xerxes's army at Thermopylae upon the fleet for provisions; the position of Psytal- leia and the reasons for stationing the Persian nobles there before the battle of Salamis to direct the movements of the fleet in the night; and the reasons for the advance of the Greeks at Plataea along the Asopus ridge, where the elevation gave momentum to their attack. Sellasia. - In B.C.H. XXXIV, 1910, pp. 5-57, G. SOTERIADES discusses the topography of the battlefield of Sellasia, combating the views of Kro- mayer, Antike Schlachtfelder, and maintaining that the description of Poly- bius cannot be accepted as accurate. J. KROMAYER, ibid. pp. 508-537 (pl.),</page><page sequence="30">562 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XV, 1911 defends his views. SOTERIADES, replying, ibid. XXXV, 1911, pp. 87-107, strengthens his arguments, and in an addendum, pp. 241, 242, describes the results of more recent observations and excavations made on the site. The questions in dispute are (1) the course of the ancient road, (2) the hill Enas, (3) the stream Gorgylus, (4) the hill Olympus. Kromayer supposes that the ancient road ran between the two hills Palaiogoula (Enas) and Melissi (Olympus). Soteriades believes that it followed the same course as the bridle path west of Palaiogoula, which has now been superseded by the high road from Tripolis to Sparta, and his excavations have revealed abundant traces of an ancient road there. If this be accepted, the identification of the two hills as Enas and Olympus must be given up. Soteriades argues further that the north slope of Palaiogoula is too steep to admit of the operations described as taking place on Enas, and that there are remains on the top of the hill of quite an extensive Greek fort which would have been a factor in the battle. These remains Kromayer held to be Turkish. Ac- cording to Soteriades, the gully which Kromayer identifies with the r'pyvXoP *rovaLos is not a stream, and Melissi (Olympus) is not a X64oo, but simply a spur of the mountain Probatares. Nerikos. -In Ath. Mitt. XXXVI, 1911, pp. 207-211, E. HERKENRATH maintains that the Nerikos both of Homeric and classical times was situated on the present island of Leucas, and that in Homer the name is applied to the island as well, which was then the aKT/ ~TcLpOLO. The promontory which Dorpfeld holds to be Nerikos cannot be properly termed an dKTr. The town is identified with that excavated by Dorpfeld in the plain of Nidri. W. DORPFELD, criticizing this theory (ibid. pp. 212-219), argues that Leucas is now generally conceded to have been an island in Homeric times, and that, therefore, Nerikos must be sought elsewhere. The Acar- nanian promontory, on which he has excavated a small fortress, is a true aKTV, and suits the evidence in Homer and in classical writers. Greece and the West. - At an open meeting of the German Archaeo- logical Institute in Athens, February 1, 1911, G. Karo discussed the rela- tions of Greece with the West. The prevalent view is that the East, especially the region around the Euxine, as well as the West, Iberia, Massilia, Sicily, Southern Italy, etc., were discovered by the Greeks in the eighth and seventh centuries B.c.; but we have evidence of relations at least a thousand years earlier in such legends as those of Jason, Odysseus, the Pillars of Heracles, the sea-power of Minos, and especially the legend which associated the death and burial of the latter with Sicily. Excavations, within the last ten years, have shown clearly that even if these legends are not to be taken literally, still there is a reason for their existence, and they probably echo actual commercial relations with these places. The so-called Minoan civilization, which had developed a very high culture in the third millennium B.C., maintained constant intercourse with Egypt, the Bosphorus, and the shores of the Eastern Mediterranean. We find a great many obsidian articles belonging to this period. Melos was a great centre for this material, but it is noteworthy that quantities of it are found in Sicily also. Further- more, excavations in Sicily and Southern Italy have revealed a culture which is very similar to the Cretan, and many objects found there seem to belong to Cretan workmanship of this period. In the second millennium B.C., Crete developed still wider and stronger commercial relations with other lands.</page><page sequence="31">GREEK MISC.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1911 563 Close and constant intercourse was maintained with Egypt and the Eastern Mediterranean, and with the West as well. The famous "Minoan" fleet was not merely a collection of warships, but a great commercial fleet as well. We find, at this period, articles of exactly the samne type in both Lipara and Egypt, and Crete was doubtless the medium which effected the exchange. Bronze at this time was in common use. The copper for this was readily obtainable near at hand, but tin was not so easily procured, and the most reasonable supposition is that it was obtained from Spain. This is borne out by discoveries in Spain. The early, native, Iberian culture shows marked Mycenaean influence, traces of which existed even in Roman times. Graves of the same type have been found there, and many articles which show marks of the same culture. Most striking of all is the famous man- headed bull from Balazote, which clearly shows Chaldaean influence, and we must think of Crete as the medium between the two countries. The Macedonian Dialect. - In B.C.H. XXXV, 1911, pp." 120-131, P. PERDRIZET traces the survival of the Macedonian dialect in Egypt under the Ptolemies, and discusses the varying forms of the inscription on the coins of Geta, king of the Edoni. Geta, King of the Edoni. - As was often the case in antiquity as well as at the present time in the Balkan states, Geta, king of the Edoni, was not of the same race as his subjects, but came of the famous Danubian people, the Getae. The foreign dynasty may have been called in for reli- giollus reasons, since the Getae were renowned for piety, or a tribe of the Getae may have conquered the Edoni. The statement that among the Getae only slaves were tattooed, whereas in Thrace the custom was limited to the free-born, suggests that the Getae were a conquering race which had given up the practice, while the Thracian tribe, reduced to a state of serf- dom, still continued it. A difference of race between the Edoni and their dynasty is suggested also by the statement of Herodotus that in Thrace Hermes was worshipped by the kings alone. Hermes conducting cattle ap- pears on the coins of Geta, on a coin of the Derroni, and on some coins of the Orrescii. The limitation of the cult to the kings may have existed among certain tribes in the Pangaean district, and have been attributed erroneously by Herodotus to the whole of Thrace. (P. PERDRIZET, B.C.H. XXXV, 1911, pp. 108-119.) Itanos and the "Inventio Souti." - In R. Hist. Rel. LX, 1909, pp. 161- 190 (3 figs.); 309-351 (11 figs.); LXI, 1910, pp. 197-237 (20 figs.), A. J. REINACH discusses the prehistoric Greek shield and its use in certain reli- gious ceremonies. The small round shield of early times was made of willow, IrTa, and its inventor was called Itonos. As a god of the shield he was car- ried from Thessaly to Crete, where he came to be regarded as one of the Curetes. In classical Greek times this type of shield was not used except in the mysteries of the Curetes. The Origin of the Great Games of Greece. - In a recent lecture at Cambridge Professor W. Ridgeway tried to show that the great games of Greece did not originate in the cults of Zeus, Apollo, and Poseidon, but arose out of games held in honor of local heroes upon whose cults the wor- ship of the great divinities was later imposed. Thus the Nemean games were originally held in honor of Opheltes, the Isthmian in honor of Palae- mon, the Olympic games probably in honor of Pelops, and the Pythian games</page><page sequence="32">564 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL.

FRIES attempts to show that the Phaeacian episode in the Odyssey, including the dbroAoyoL, is to be regarded as a unity. The epi- sode does not rest upon free invention, but upon an actual transaction; and this is not a single occurrence, but the repeated act of a religious cult that was widespread in the ancient Orient. It is derived from the Zagmuk fes- tival of the Babylonians, which celebrated the rebirth of nature in the spring of the year. Archaic Greek Costume. - A detailed study of the Doric and Ionic types of archaic Greek costume by G. PINZA appears in B. Comn. Rom. XXXVIII, 1910, pp. 183-242 (pl.; 18 figs.). It is based upon an Attic am- phora and an archaic statue, both in the Capitoline Museum. The Hair in Early Greek Times.--In his doctor's dissertation, Die Haartracht des Mannes in archaisch-griechischer Zeit (Giessen, 1911, R. Lange, 73 pp.), WALTER BREMER explains the various methods of wearing the hair in early Greek times, as shown by the monuments, and discusses the evi- dence for the krobylos. Tettiges, he thinks, was the name for a garland of leaves. calvouoa.--In Jh. Oest. Arch. L. XIII, 1911, Beiblatt, cols. 269-276, F. HAUSER disputes H.

The Masks of the New Attic Comedy. --The masks of the New Comedy have been carefully investigated and discussed by Professor Robert. He begins with the catalogue given by Pollux (IV, 143 ff.; pp. 244 ft. Bethe), discusses other literary sources of information, illustrates and discusses the different types of masks as seen in terra-cottas, reliefs, paintings, and draw- ings (notably the illustrations to Terence), and shows that some types, e.g. the Hermonios of Pollux, were conventional and were handed down from the Old Comedy, while others, including most of the female masks, were realistic and modern. Many matters of detail are discussed and elucidated. (CARL ROBERT, Die Masken der neueren Attischen Komoedie. Fiinfundzwan- zigstes hallisches Winckelmannsprogramm.

Greek Papyri. - In the second volume of Tabulae in usum scholarum editae sub cura Johannis Lietzmann, WILHELM SCHUBERT has collected nearly eighty papyrus texts on fifty plates. The papyri are in the Berlin museum; those selected show the development of handwriting from the end of the fourth century B.C. to the beginning of the eighth century A.D. Documents, letters, and literary writings are represented. The brief text gives the ne- cessary facts concerning each papyrus. (WILHELM SCHUBERT, Papyri Grae- cae Carolinenses. Bonn, 1911, A.

XVI, 1910, pp. 427-430, S. R. gives a brief summary of the archaeological work done in Greece in 1909-10. This is derived chiefly from an article by STRUCK in the Frankfurter Zeitung, October 26, 1910. ITALY ARCHITECTURE The Architecture of the Columbarium of Hylas. - In B.S.R. V, 1910, pp. 464-471, T. ASHBY writes the descriptive text to accompany a series of drawings and colored plates made by F. G. Newton, a student of the British School at Rome, illustrating the architecture and decoration of the Colunm- barium of Hylas on the Via Latina, just inside the Porta Latina. SCULPTURE Portraits of Gaius Caesar.--At the January (1910) meeting of the Berlin Archaeological Society F. Studniczka discussed two types of head which have both been called portraits of the emperor Caligula, and decided that one of them, a boyish type, represented in the Capitoline, Albani, Uffizi, and Naples museums, is in reality the portrait of the other C. Caesar, the son of Julia and of Agrippa, to whose portraits the features bear a strong resemblance. (Arch. Anz. 1910, cols. 532-533.) The Interpretation of the Reliefs of Trajan's Column. - In B.S.R. V, 1910, pp. 435-459, H. STUART-JONES writes on the historical interpreta- tion of the reliefs of Trajan's column, and arrives at some conclusions in regard to the details of Trajan's campaigns in Dacia which differ somewhat from those of von Domaszewski and Weber, and to a less degree from those of Cichorius and Petersen. A Relief of Serapis and Isis.- A singular relief in the Palazzo Mas- simo alle Terme, representing Serapis and Isis, is explained by F. GRossI GONDI (B. Comrn. Rom. XXXVIII, 1910, pp. 150-160; 3 figs.) as an example of mythological syncretism. It dates from about 200 A.D. Landscape MVotives in Greek and Roman Reliefs.-- In B.S.R. V, 1910, pp. 167-200, A. J. B. WACE discusses the development of the land- scape motives in Greek and Roman reliefs in general, and in particular analyzes the series of eight reliefs now in the Palazzo Spada and some others akin to them, adducing further evidence for their purely Roman origin, and assigning definite dates. Six of the Spada reliefs he assigns to 130 A.D., and the remaining two to 160. Roman Reliefs in the Louvre. - In Mon. Piot, XVII, 1909, pp. 145- 253 (pl.; 15 figs.), E. MICHON discusses a number of Roman reliefs in the Louvre. These are: (1) a Suovetaurilia which formed part of the frieze of</page><page sequence="34">566 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XV, 1911 the altar dedicated to Neptune by Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus; (2) a slab with a procession from the Ara Pacis Augusti; (3) a standing Roman clad in the toga, similar to the reliefs of the Ara Pacis, but not from that monu- ment, and dating from the time of Trajan; (4) a Suovetaurilia carried off from Venice in 1797 and dating from the period between Augustus and Nero; (5) a fragment of a similar relief of the same date acquired in 1808 depicting an ox, ram and two priests; (6) a fragment representing a combat between a Roman soldier and a barbarian, probably from a building of Trajan; (7) a slab of the best period with five headless figures originally representing an emperor accompanied by Rome and Abundantia pouring a libation; (8) a broken relief with two scenes, an extispicium and a ceremony in front of the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, dating from the time of Trajan and bearing on a sandal the signature of the sculptor, M. Vulpius Orestes; (9) the sacrifice of a bull in front of two buildings, perhaps from a trium- phal arch of the time of Hadrian; (10) a group of six standing Roman sol- diers, also of the time of Hadrian; (11) a relief known as "the sacrifice of two bulls," dating from the beginning of the third or end of the second cen- tury A.D.; (12) the torso of a colossal statue in the round probably placed beside a triumphal arch. A Roman Sarcophagus. - In Hermes, XLVI, 1911, pp. 249-253 (pl.), C. ROBERT discusses a slab from a sarcophagus in the Sala del Meleagro in the Vatican museum, on which, in the centre, is a seated female figure with her right arm about a smaller woman. She is turning towards a youth who stands on her left. In the foreground are boats and ships, and in the back- ground buildings. He shows that the scene is laid at Ostia; that the seated woman is Ora maritima, the smaller woman Ostia, and the youth Portus Augusti. The Torre Nova Sarcophagus.- The interesting Torre Nova sar- cophagus of a maiden (see A.J.A. XV, pp. 241 f.) is again discussed in Rim. Mitt. XXV, 1910, pp. 273-292. The author, F. HAUSER, interprets the Eleusinian suggestions of the reliefs not as referring literally to the mysteries, but as symbolical of the girl's unmarried state. VASES AND PAINTING South Italian Vases. -In B.C.H. XXXV, 1911, pp. 177-230 (5 pls.), C. PICARD surveys the later development of south Italian pottery on the basis of the collections in Italian museums, and publishes a number of vases in the museum at Naples. The so-called Gnathia vases are classified with regard to fabric and provenience, the chief Apulian centres being Tarentum, Ruvo, Canosa, Oria, and Manduria, while similar vases have been found in Campania and Sicily (Gela and Camrnarina). They are to be dated between the years 350 and 250 B.c. The relation of these vases to contemporary Italian ware which imitated Greek models and to rustic Apulian ware is discussed, as well as the evidence afforded by pottery as to the political predominance of Tarentum down to its destruction in 272 B.c. Glaze or Polish on Terra-Sigillata ?- In Die Saalburg, December 31, 1910, pp. 403-407, K. BLijIMLEIN maintains, against E. Heuser, that Roman terra-sigillata ware was polished, not glazed. The Tomb of the Nasonii. - The last writing of A. MICHAELIS, finished</page><page sequence="35">ITAL. INSCRIPTIONS] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1911 567 a few days before his death, is published with additional notes by E. PETER- SEN, in Jb. Arch. I. XXV, 1910, pp. 101-109 (24 figs.). He describes the various copies which remain of the painted decoration of the rock-cut tomb of the Nasonii, which was found on the Via Flaminia near Prima Porta in 1674. The paintings themselves, which covered the walls and ceiling and were ascribed to the time of the Antonines, disappeared within a few years of their discovery. Michaelis finds that Bartoli's sketches and engravings are quite untrustworthy, both in color and in contents, since the archi- tectural and landscape backgrounds and important parts of the groups and attributes were freely invented by the artist. An appendix (pp. 110-126) gives a catalogue of the copies of ancient paintings in the library at Windsor Castle, among which the materials for this study were found. Panel Pictures in Fresco Decoration.- Apropos of the frescoes from a Roman house in the Farnesina gardens, G. RODENWALDT shows, by the help of a Vienna mosaic from Centocelle, that the imitated panel pictures in fresco decoration were in fact copies of well-known paintings. (Riom. Mitt. XXV, 1910, pp. 257-262; 2 figs.) Pompeian Wall Painting.--In Jh. Oest. Arch. L XIII, 1911, pp. 123- 149 (21 figs.), W. KLEIN shows that the Pompeian fresco painters made a study of the antique, and that in their paintings they frequently reproduced more or less exactly masterpieces of Greek sculpture. For example, the Artemis in the picture of Actaeon and Artemis in the Casa degli amorini dorati is indebted to the Aphrodite of Cnidos; the Auge surprised by Hera- cles resembles a bronze statuette of Aphrodite in the Louvre; the Perseus of the Perseus and Andromeda (Not. Scav. 1897, p. 36) resembles the Bar- berini faun; the Perseus of the Perseus and Andromeda in the Casa degli capitelli figurati is much like a torso from the Palatine in the Museo delle Terme; the seated figure of the group in the house of the Vettii, called by Mau a poet and his friend, resembles a seated statue formerly in the Gius- tiniani palace; the seated Heracles of the Casa d' Ercole is to be compared with a seated statuette in the Palazzo Altemps, while the female figure beside him is reproduced in a marble statue in Dresden. Such resem- blances are numerous. A study of the Pompeian paintings will reveal free reproductions of lost Greek sculptures. The Newly Discovered Frescoes at Pompeii. - In Berl. Phil. W. XXXI, 1911, cols. 503 f., O. ROSSBACH gives a new interpretation of some of the fresco paintings in the newly discovered villa at Pompeii. (A.J.A. XV, 1911, p. 97.) Of the series XII-XX, he thinks XII, XIII, and XVIII, XIX, and XX are scenes in the gynaikonitis, interrupted by pantomimic scenes, XIV-XVII. Rejecting Giulio de Petra's view of XVI and XVII as a flag- ellation rite, Rossbach thinks the women are dancers and the object, from which one of them turns in horror, a tunny. These last scenes are again differently interpreted by J. SIEVEKING, ibid. XXXI, 1911, col. 599, who thinks the object is a basket, from which the kneeling woman lifts the cover, disclosing the contents to Aidos, who turns away in horror; another Dionysiac scene, therefore. INSCRIPTIONS A New Fragment of the Fasti Augurales. - In Jh. Oest. A rch. L XIII, 1911, Beiblatt, cols. 253-256 (fig.), C. HUELSEN publishes a new fragment</page><page sequence="36">568 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL.

CAGNAT discusses an inscription recently found in Rome and published in Not. Scav. 1910, pp. 132 f. in which there is mention of an augurium maximum quo salus p. r. petitur in the years 3 and 17 A.D. This is the same as the augu- rium salutis mentioned by Dion Cassius (XXXVII, 24, 1) in which informa- tion was sought as to whether the gods wished to be asked to grant safety to the Roman people. Incidentally it is shown that in Tacitus, Ann. XII, 23 we must read XXV with the manuscripts, not LXXV with the editors. The Composition of the Monumentum Ancyranum.- In R. Stor. A nt. XIII, 1909, pp. 41-46, Dr. Vuli6 examines the arguments which have been brought forward to prove that the Monumentum Ancyranum was written at different times by different persons, and finds them inconclusive. The various sections of the document may have been composed at different times, but this does not preclude their having been fused and combined by Augustus himself. The Tabula Iliaca.-In Rend. Acc. Lincei, XIX, 1910, pp. 933-942, H. MANcuso gives a new recension of the inscription of the Tabula 1]iaca Capitolina with complete apparatus criticus. Inscriptions Relating to Roman Campaigns in Palestine. - In Pal. Ex. Fund, XLIII, 1911, pp. 91-97, J. OFFORD and H. H. C. GIBBON pub- lish Roman inscriptions referring to campaigns in Palestine under Vespasian and H-adrian that have been discovered since the publication of previously known inscriptions of this sort in S. Bibl. Arch. XX1V, 1902, pp. 325-328; XXV, 1903, pp. 30-33; and XX, 1898, pp. 59-69. An Inscribed Wooden Diptych from Philadelphia. - In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1910, pp. 795-807, J.-B. MISPOULET discusses the Latin inscription on a wooden diptych found at Philadelphia in the Fayum and published by Lefebvre in the Bull. de la Soc. Arch. d'Alexandrie, 1910, pp. 39 ff. It is a statement that the veteran to whom it belonged had fulfilled the necessary formalities for entering upon the privileges accorded to him and to his children by the imperial constitution. It thus represents a new type of document. A Correction to C.I.L. XIII, 5748.-- In B. Soc. Ant. Fr. 1910, pp. 237-238, E. ESPiRANDIEU publishes a correction of C.I.L. XIII, 5748.

CoINS] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1911 569 Curious Interpretation of a Roman Inscription.- At Etting, north of Ingolstadt, is a church of St. Michael in which the "Three Wretched Saints " Archus, Herenneus, and Guardanus are worshipped. Their names, and perhaps in part their story, are the result of misinterpretation of a Latin inscription on the grave-stone of one D. Herennius Secundus. (F. VOLLMER, Sitzb. Min. Akad. 1910, No. 14. 24 pp.) Latin Inscriptions in the Pyrenees.-- In R. Et. Anc. XIII, 1911, pp. 79-81, C. JULLIAN republishes several Latin inscriptions in towns in the Pyrenees incorrectly read. At Soulan the supposed dedication to Mithra (C.1.L. XIII, 379) consists of modern letters traced over an ancient inscrip- tion in which the name of Mithra did not appear. At Vielle-Aure C.I.L. XIII, 378, proves to be a modern dedication bearing the date 1595. Notes on Dacian Inscriptions. - In Klio, X, 1910, pp. 495-505, G. TIGL;S publishes 109 Latin inscriptions found in the territory of ancient Dacia between 1892 and 1907. Most of them are small fragments.

COINS The Monetary System of Etruria. - In Dolgozatok az Erdelyi Nemzeti Muzeum eremrn-es regisegtardbdl, 11, 1911, pp. 128-173, E. KovAcs discusses in detail the coinage of the Etruscans, correcting in certain particulars the work of Deecke. Haeberlin on the Metrology of Early Italian Coinage-Systems. - The third and final instalment of the Italian translation by SERAFINO RICCI of Dr. Haeberlin's now well-known article ('Die metrologischen Grund- lagen der altesten mittelitalischen Miinzsysteme,' in Z. Num. XXVII, 1908, pp. 1-115) appears in R. Ital. Nuim. XXIV, 1911, pp. 77-118. Aes Grave.- In his Aes Grave E. J. HAEBERLIN has published a monu- mental work on the heavy bronze coinage of Italy. The text describes each coin, and gives a list of the known specimens of each variety. In one case as many as 1168 specimens of a single as are catalogued. The work thus assumes the character of a corpus. Many of the coins are in the author's possession. The plates are especially good, and reproduce every variation.

HAEBERLIN in Z. Num. XXVII; A.J.A. XIII, p. 224), by actual settlers from Babylonian-Assyrian territory, probably toward the end of the second millennium before Christ, at all events, several centuries before the Greeks knew anything about Italy.</page><page sequence="38">570 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL.

In view of these arguments he would correct many statements made by modern historians and etymologists concerning the primitive history of the country. A Coin of the Sontini. - ETTORE GABRICI publishes in Num. Chron. 1910, pp. 329-332 (cut), an almost unique silver coin weighing gr. 5.30, which he would attribute to the Sontini, a people of Lucaaia known only by a single reference in Plin. N.H. III, 15. It bears on the obverse a figure of a bull with reverted head, and the inscription OM, while on the reverse the identical type is repeated, but incuse. Virgil and Coin-Types. - ALBERT W. VAN BUREN suggests that in at least five passages in Virgil's Aeneid (I, 444; III, 551, 702, 703 f., 705) the poet was influenced in his description by well-known coin-types. (Nunm. Chron. 1910, pp. 409-411.) Unpublished Roman Coins.--To his many previous papers of the same sort, FRANCESCO GNECCHI adds another, in which he describes, and illustrates in large measure, 110 unedited Roman coins, ranging in period from Augustus to Valentinian III, that have come into his possession dur- ing the last three years, among them some of first importance, including an Antoninianus of Iotopianus, and a few new medallions. (R. Ital. Nunm. XXIII, 1910, pp. 449-472; 3 pl.) Roman Medallions.--In an article under the title 'La Medaglia presso i Romani,' FRANCESCO GNECCHI summarizes his views concerning the evolution of the imperial Roman medallion in various metals, as a cornm- memrnorative and not a monetary issue, and gives illustrations of the various types. (R. Ital. Numn. XXIV, 1911, pp. 11-18; 2 pls.) The Denarius of Accoleius.- GIOVANNI PANSA believes that the three Nymphae Querquetulanae on the reverse of the denarius of P. Accoleius Lariscolus (Babelon I, Accoleia 1) represent the caryatid-front of the shrine of the deities. He points out other instances of the worship of deities in the shape of trees, and especially calls attention to a similar early shrine of Mercury, in Rome, restored by M. Aurelius, and pictured on a coin of that emperor - Cohen III, M. Aurelius, No. 534. (R. Ital. Num. XXIII, 1910, pp. 473-478; 2 cuts.) The Cognomen of Antoninus Pius.- On numismatic evidence C. HAROLD DODD argues that Pausanias (VIII, 43, 45) was right in his obiter dictum that "the Romans called this emperor Plus because he was conspicu- ous for the reverence he paid to the Divine." (Num. Chron. 1911, pp. 6-41; 2 'pls.) The Coins of Antoninus Pius.--In Rec. Past, X, 1911, pp. 17-33 (3 figs.); 77-91, F. S. DUNN discusses the coins of Antoninus Pius. Dusares on a Coin of Commodus. - In R. Num. 1911, pp. 69-85 (pl.), C. R. MOREY publishes ten coins of Bostra, Arabia, found by the Princeton University expedition to Syria, and now at Princeton. The most important of them is an unpublished bronze of Commodus, having on the obverse the draped bust of the emperor, and the inscription AVP KOMOAOC KAIC VIOF EV; and on the reverse a draped bust of the god Dusares, wearing a fillet and inscribed, BOCTPHN WON AOVCAPHC. This is the first anthropomorphic representation of Dusares to be discovered, although the existence of such a type had been conjectured. Another coin</page><page sequence="39">ITAL. MISC.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1911 571 has on the reverse a wine press as symbolical of the god. The coins fur- nish evidence that in late times Dusares was identified with Bacchus. Unique Medallion of Carus.--In R. Ital. Num. XXIII, 1910, pp. 427- 448 (cut), FRAN'CESCO GNECCHI publishes from his own collection a unique bronze medallion with brass rim, bearing on one side the bust of Carus with inscription, and on the other the bust of Magnia Vrbica, with inscription. The piece is in jnint state and unique, but of its authenticity the owner has no doubt. It came into Italy with a collection of nearly three thousand specimens of Roman coinage that had been formed about a century ago, by a now unknown collector. Most of the other coins were in poor (or worse) condition, and about a hundred of them were false. To Gnecchi's article is appended a letter by ATTILIO PROFUMO, which reviews exhaustively the reign of Carus and his sons, with especial use of numismatic evidence, and points out that this medallion establishes the previously unknown facts that Magnia Vrbica was married to Carinus while Carus was yet living, and that Carinus was formally associated with Carus in the empire. Roman Coins from Corstopitum.- Mr. Craster's report of Roman coins discovered at Corstopitum (Num. Chron. 1909, p. 431) is supplemented by another article in Archaeologia Aeliana (3d ser., Vol. VI), in which he also gives a list of all coins earlier in date than 260 A.D. found during the last season. He believes F. A. Walters right in supposing the coins of Antoninus Pins with the "Britannia" reverse to have been struck in Brit- ain (G. F. Hill dissents). Mr. Craster further notes that the Christian symbol of the cross occurs on a coin of the London mint of the reign of Constantine earlier than its appearance, on coins from the mints of Rome, Trier, Lyons, or Aries. He also chronicles the finding of a large bronze coin of Septimius Severus struck at Hadrianeia on the Hellespont, "one of the few authenticated instances of a ' Greek Imperial' found in Britain." (G. F. H., Num. Chron. 1910, pp. 413-414.) Imitation of Roman Coins in Britain. - The description of a hoard of Roman and British coins found in an earthen pot at Southants some years ago furnishes G. F. HILL with a text for valuable comment. The pieces were 677 in number, the Roman coins (forty-one genuine and imitated) ranging from the second century before to the second after Christ. Mr. Hill judges that some of the plated denarii, which we are wont to believe were struck at Rome for use among the barbarians, were made by the bar- barians themselves, but that the imitations of early Roman copper found in Britain were importations from Gaul. He also describes the cast British coins, the long series of which, starting from recognizable imitations of struck coins, show a prodigious degeneration. This hoard furnishes the first known incontestable evidence of such cast coins of British origin. (Num. Chron. 1911, pp. 42-56; 3 pls.; fig.) Astrological Symbols on Coins of Constantine.- In B. Soc. Ant. Fr. J. MAURICE calls attention to three types of coins of Constantine having upon them symbols with astrological significance. GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Prehistoric Archaeology in Italy.- In Prehistoria (Rome, 1911, Acca- demia dei Lincei, 72 pp.), L. PIGORINI surveys the history of prehistoric</page><page sequence="40">572 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XV, 1911 archaeology in Italy during the past fifty years, chronicling the principal excavations and discoveries. The Nuraghi of Sardinia. - In R. Arch. XVII, 1911, pp. 6-14, L. CH. WATELIN discusses the primitive monuments of Sardinia and classifies them as follows:- First neolithic state: caves, rock shelters, stations. Eneolithic state: dolmens, menhirs, alignments. First and second bronze states: quadrangular and round monuments analogous to the talayots. These appear to have been constructed by a population that came from the west, i.e. from Spain and the Balearic Islands. Third bronze state: the nuraghi proper, erected by a people that came from the east, spread over Sardinia, attained considerable maritime power, and perhaps pushed its incursions as far as Minorca. Dolmens and Tombs of the Giants.--In B.S.R. V, 1910, pp. 89-137, DUNCAN MACKENZIE describes his discoveries among the dolmens, Tombs of the Giants, and nuraghi of Sardinia in the autumn of 1908, and brings forward new evidence in support of the theory that the dolmen developed on Sardinian soil into the Tomba di Gigante, which thenceforth continued to be the family tomb of the people of the nuraghi throughout the Bronze Age. Cretan Proper Names among the Etruscans. - In Klio, XI, 1911, pp. 26-47, A. KANNENGIESSER shows that practically all of the names of places on the coast of Crete reappear in Italy in names of persons or places of Etruscan origin; and the same is true of a considerable number of Cretan personal names. He concludes that there must have been a powerful inva- sion of Cretans, or of people of the same stock, into Italy. At least, the early inhabitants of the islands of the Aegean had an important part in the settlement of Italy. The Beginnings of the First Iron Age in Italy. - In R. Arch. XVI, 1910, pp. 378-400 (5 figs.), T. E. PEET discusses the beginnings of the First Iron Age in Italy and concludes that: (1) The earliest Italian civilization of the Iron Age is a complex phenomenon, due to various causes. (2) This civilization, as found in Latium, is very probably derived from that of the terramare. (3) The civilization of Villanova and of Tuscany seems also to have roots in that of the terramare; at any rate, it contains many indige- nous Italian elements. (4) There is no proof at present that the civilization of Iron was introduced into northern Italy by an invasion from central Europe. (5) Greek and Oriental influences are noticeable in the last phases of the Iron Age, but are wanting, or hardly recognizable, in its beginning. (6) In the late phases of the Iron Age northern Italy exerted influence upon central Europe, but before that time the reverse was probably the case, and it is possible that many influences which determined the character of the civilization of northern Italy in the First Iron Age may have come from central Europe. (7) Southern Italy was much more under the influence of the Mediterianean countries, but also, in some measure, under that of northern Italy. A Silver Girdle and Chatelaines of the Iron Age. -In Rend. Ace. Lincei, XIX, 1910, pp. 751-766 (6 figs.), G. BELLUCCI describes a girdle of thin silver of the second period of the Iron Age, with three-lobed pendants attached, and also several ladies' chatelaines of the same period, consisting of fibulae with a pendant of wire bent in loops, holding toilet articles, two</page><page sequence="41">ITAL. MISC.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1911 573 nail-cleaners, two pairs of forceps, and two ear-spoons. In the light of these he explains other fibula-pendants previously misinterpreted. These articles were found in the necropolis of Norcia (Umbria), and were intended not for practical use, but for adornment of the dead. Among other things found there is a black cup of terra-cotta with a Bacchic procession of children, inscribed L . CANOLEIVS - L . F. FECIT The Early Settlements at Coppa Nevigata. - In Ann. Arch. A nthr. III, 1910, pp. 118-133 (pl.; 5 figs.), T. E. PEET discusses the prehistoric site excavated by Mosso on the hill of Coppa Nevigata, near the town of Man- fredonia on the Adriatic coast of Italy. He argues that the remains of the iron foundry discovered in the upper stratum are later in date than Late Minoan III a; that is, that it is not Mycenaean, as Mosso thought. He admits that the "white incised" pottery of the middle stratum resembles that of Bosnia, but denies its Aegean origin. He concludes that this settlement was not made by terramare people, but may have been made by the earlier inhabitants of the district under the influence of the terramare civilization. The Walls of Rome. - In a paper read before the Imperial German Archaeological Institute in Rome, January 26, 1911, G. Boni discussed the city walls, showing that the oldest were built of tufa and peperino. There was no moat. In many places remains of bricks are found between courses of tufa, and these portions date from about 88 B.c. He thinks the walls which have come to light between the Via delle Finanze and the Via di S. Susanna earlier than the Gallic invasion. He also concludes, from finding terra-cotta fragments in the oldest walls, that Roman imperial buildings of the first century A.D. such as the aqueduct of Trajan were not built of brick, but of roof-tiles which had belonged to earlier buildings. The stamps on the tiles are, therefore, no evidence for the date of these buildings. Boni also argued that the swallow-tail cuttings on the squared blocks served no practical purpose, but, like the double eagles, had a purely symbolical mean- ing. (Kunstchr. XXII, May 5, 1911, cols. 399-400.) The Date of the Servian Wall.-- In Klio, XI, 1911, pp. 83-123, P. GRAFFUNDER shows that the parts of the Servian wall built with the Oscan foot as the unit date from the time of the kings; and that the parts having the Roman foot as the unit date from a rebuilding after the capture of the city by the Gauls. The Roman, that is, Solonian foot, was known in Sicily in the fifth century B.c., and it is not surprising to find it in use at Rome in the fourth century. This conclusion is supported by the masons' marks on the stones. The forms used for N, P, and Z are earlier than 379 B.c. Old Apulian Terra-cottas.- The survival of primitive native charac- teristics in Apulian terra-cottas into the time when Greek and Samnite influences were also prevalent in that region, and even the collocation of the two distinct grades of artistic development in the same object, are shown by M. MAYER, Jb. Arch. T. XXV, 1910, pp. 176-192 (13 figs.). The Location of Clusium. - In Mel. Arch. Hist. 1910, XXX, pp. 373- 395, D. ANZIANI identifies the site of the modern town of Orbetello as that of the Clusium mentioned by Virgil (Aen. X, 167), by Servius in his com- mentary ad loc., and by Polybius (II, 25) in his description of the Gallic invasion of 225 B.c. Mons Massicus in the same passage in Virgil is, there- fore, the ancient name of Monte Argentario, which, as mons Argentinus, occurs first in Rutilius.

WOOLLEY describes the remains of fortifications at the site known as Civita, in the valley of the Sabato, eight kilometres from Serino, assigning them to the early centuries of our era, and showing that the conjectural identifica- tion of this site as that of the chief town of the Sabatini made by Cluver, or of the Picentini made by Orilia, are without foundation. Topography of the Roman Campagna. - In B.S.R. V, 1910, pp. 214- 431, T. ASHBY continues his work on the classical topography of the Roman campagna. The present instalment is Part 3 of Section II, and deals with the Via Latina and adjacent territory from the tenth milestone to its junc- tion with the Via Labicana, the principal subject being ancient Tusculum and its immediate surroundings. The Warehouses at Ostia.--In Me'l. Arch. Hist. XXX, 1910, pp. 397- 446, J. CARCOPINO discusses in detail the existing remains and the arrange- ment of the extensive warehouses (horrea) that lie between the great temple and the Tiber at Ostia. The Date of the Lex Latina.--In Rend. Acc. Lincei, XIX, 1910, pp. 687-704 and 788-809, E. PAls writes about the probable date and nature of the lex Latina of Heraclea. He concludes that it is somewhat later than the time of Marius and Sulla and that the period of Caesar's first political activity (65-59 B.c.) marks the terminus post quem. The sup- position that it is alex satura is less improbable than the conjectures of Legras, Savigny, and others. Pantheistic Monuments. - In Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XIII, 1911, pp. 176- 199 (24 figs.), R. WEISSHXUPL discusses a series of monuments upon which a number of attributes characteristic of various divinities appear. A Liber Pantheus is known from inscriptions; but an altar at Pola, which is simi- larly decorated with emblems, is dedicated Isidis imperio. The writer shows that Isis, as earth mother, was associated with all the divinities of fertility, and hence might have their peculiar symbols. Like Isis Panthea, Venus Panthea might be honored with many emblems. All the monuments dis- cussed belong to the second century A.D. The Cult of the Roman Emperors.--In Klio, XI, 1911, pp. 129-177, H. HEINEN collects and arranges chronologically the references to the deifi- cation of Julius Caesar, which began as early as 48 B.c. He also adds simi- la' references for M. Antonius, S. Pompeius, Augustus, Livia, M. Agrippa, Julia, C. and L. Caesar, and Tiberius Claudius Nero. The Solar Dynasty of the Second Plavians.--In R. Arch. XVII, 1911, pp. 377-406 (11 cuts of coins), JULES MAURICE discusses the worship of the sun by the Emperor Julian and his predecessors, Julius Constantius, Constantine, Constantius Chlorus, and Claudius II. This worship sup- planted that of Jupiter and that of Hercules, to which the previous dynas- ties had been devoted. The sun has the name of Apollo or of Sol Invictus, according to circumstances. The author traces the progress in various parts of the empire, especially in Gaul, of the worship under discussion. The Fighting Position in the Maniple. - In Klio, X, 1910, pp. 445- 461, T.

XIII, 1911, Beiblatt, cols. 261-270 (5 figs.), E. NOWOTNY calls attention to the publication of 62 convex glass mirrors by E. Michon in B. Arch. C. T. 1909, pp. 231 ff. and adds eight more to his list previously published, ibid. cols. 107-128 (A.J.A. XV, p. 248). 134 of these mirrors from different parts of the Roman empire are now on record. Fish-shaped Roman Counters. - In Riim.-Germ. Kb. IV, 1911, pp. 26- 29 (2 figs.), F. J. DiLGER discusses the meaning of certain objects shaped like animals and fruits and dating from Roman times. They are usually regarded as tesserae conviviales, which were distributed at banquets and gave the recipients the right to presents. Dolger publishes six ebony fishes be- longing to this class now in the museum at TrBves, and holds them to have served as counters in games, along with the usual round calculi. Minuscule Writing at Rome.--In Me'l. Arch. Hist. XXX, 1910, pp. 447-474, E. D. PETRELLA defends the view held by Sickel, Monaci, and others, that a distinct form of minuscule writing was developed at Rome, independently of the Caroline minuscule which originated at Tours, and gives a list of manuscripts that seem to him to support his opinion. The Fire of Nero. - In R. Stor. Ant. XIII, 1909, pp. 3-29, Dr. Profunmo replies to C. Huelsen's note in A.J.A. XIII, pp. 45-48, in regard to the cause of the fire of Nero. Huelsen had pointed out that on the night before the fire there was a full moon, and that, had Nero been plotting to destroy the city by fire, this night would never have been chosen. But Profumo thinks that the documentary evidence which he publishes proves that Nero was responsible for the fire. SPAIN AND PORTUGAL A Greek Relief at Javea. - In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1911, pp. 164-169 (fig.), P. PARIS describes a relief found at Jgvea, Spain, about twenty years ago. It is a plaque of native marble 59 cm. long and 28 cm. high, broken at the bottom and ends, upon Which are carved three figures: a youth on horseback wearing a helmet upon which is a star, preceded and followed by a man on foot. The mounted youth is identified as one of the Dioscuri. The relief was carved at Jivea, as the native marble shows, but in style it is Greek and probably the work of a Greek sculptor. In the opinion of M. Collignon and E. Pottier it was a votive relief dating from the fourth century B.C. Iberian Vases at Saragossa. --In Mon. Plot, XVII, 1909, pp. 59-74 (10 figs.) P. PARIS publishes nine vases in the museum at Saragossa in which the decoration consists of linear combined with floral elements. These he thinks are of Iberian manufacture, but show certain Mycenaean traditions. They have no connection with Phoenician pottery as has been suggested. The Dolmens of Boulhosa. - In O Archeologo Portugu&amp;s, XIV, 1909, pp. 294-296 (2 figs.), J. L. DE V(ASCONCELLOS) describes four dolmens examined by him in 1905 in Boulhosa (Alto-Minho), Portugal. FRANCE The Protohistoric Ages in the South of France and in the Spanish Peninsula.--In R. Arch. XVII, 1911, pp. 15-40, L. JOULIN adds to his</page><page sequence="44">576 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XV, 1911 previous articles (see A.J.A. XV, 1911, p. 249) a second part in which he discusses the settlements belonging to the different epochs and periods in Southern France and the Spanish Peninsula to about the beginning of the Christian era. The earliest objects of iron found in these regions belong to the style of Halstatt II; that is, to the sixth and fifth centuries B.c. In those centuries there was also colonization by Phocaeans and Carthaginians. The wars in Italy and Sicily may well have been favorable to the extension of Phocaean trade with the barbarians in the fourth and third centuries. At that time an increase of Greek influence is observed. The Roman con- quest wrought further changes in the civilization of the southern Gauls. The Halstatt II period shows little Greek influence, while the La T~ne period (fourth and third centuries B.C.) shows much more. Bibracte. --A summary of the historical and cultural bearings of the remains of ancient occupation on Mont Beauvray, the site of the Aeduan Bibracte, with special reference to analogous conditions on German soil, is published by H. DRAGENDORFF in Arch. Anz. 1910, cols. 439-456 (plan). On this mountain top, raised far above the surrounding hill-country and very difficult of access, a primitive place of refuge grew into an important manufacturing and commercial town, which was maintained for about a century, or until Augustus removed the populace to Augustodunum (Autuu) some fifteen miles farther east, in the plain. Hence the remains show both the native Gallic civilization and the first stages of the provincial, or mixed native and Roman, quite undisturbed by later developments, and are pecul- iarly instructive for all Roman frontier studies as well as for local and national matters. The houses are chiefly rectangular (not round), one- room, stone or wooden cabins, with sunken, plastered floors and thatched roofs; with a few larger more or less Romanized residences. The dead were burned and the ashes buried beneath the floors of the houses. The fortifications are of the familiar Gallic stone-and-timber construction. The industries were iron-working in all its branches, bronze casting, and enam- elling. The coins belonging to the period of occupation are chiefly Gallic. The native pottery includes the coarse, late La Thne style, the fine bright-colored Gallic ware, and a partly Romrnanized black ware which was probably manufactured in Belgium. The Italian terra sigillata is much less common here than on the sites of Roman military camps. The remains as a whole bear a striking resemblance to the contemporary Celtic culture found at Hradischt in Bohemia. A prehistoric or at least pre-Roman cult was perpetuated here after the abandonment of the town, in a Gallo-Roman temple perhaps of the time of Hadrian, an early Christian apsidal church, and the mediaeval and modern chapel of St. Martin of Tours. Here, at the southeast corner of the old site, a yearly gathering at the shrine, with pagan rites and on the old pagan date in early May, and its attendant fair, account for a long series of later small objects, imperial Roman, Merovingian, Carolingian, mediaeval, down into the nineteenth century. The "Sword of Brennus." - In R. Arch. XVII, 1911, pp. 130-134, D. VIOLLIER, with reference to an article by S. Reinach (Anthropologie, 1906, pp. 343-358 = Cultes Mythes et Religions, III, pp. 141-159) shows that the custom of depositing bent swords in graves was unknown to the Helve- tians, but was practised in the valley of the Po, in Normandy, Champagne, and Croatia, and only in the third and second centuries B.c. It was pecul-</page><page sequence="45">GERMANY] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1911 577 iar to certain families of Gauls, and all the bent swords belong to the second phase of the Gallic epoch. The beginning of this phase cannot be later than 250 B.c. The Ruined Towers of Aquae Sextae.--In B. Soc. Ant. Fr. 1910, pp. 304-308, V. CHIAPOT discusses the two round towers of Aix-en-Provence (Aquae Sextae) and the "Tour Magne" of Nimes, arguing that they all date from the time of Augustus and were built to commemorate some im- portant event. Sculptures of Roman Gaul.-- EMILE ESPERANDIEU continues his important publication of the ancient sculptures in France with a volume on Lyonnaise which is designated as the first part of volume three. It contains Nos. 1733 to 2755. Every piece of sculpture is described and illustrated at least once. Such well-known statues as the Venus Genetrix or Venus of Frdjus, and the Venus of Arles appear in this volume. [Recueil ge'ne'ral des bas-reliefs, statues et bustes de la Gaule romaine. Par E. ESPiRANDIEU. Vol. III, Pt. 1. Lyonnaise. Paris, 1910, Imprimerie nationale, vii, 476 pp.; 1250 figs.] Gallic Divinities with the Serpent. - In R. Arch. XVII, 1911, pp. 221-256 (pl.; 8 figs.) A. J. REINACH, beginning with a stele in the museum at Nancy, discusses Gallic serpent-divinities and their relation to similar divinities of Italy, Greece, and early Crete. Indigenous deities in Gaul, as much earlier in Italy, lost their original forms under the influence of Greek anthropomorphism. The stele at Nancy represents a male and a female side by side, each holding a serpent. Twenty-eight representations of Gallic serpent-divinities are cited. BELGIUM Gallo-Roman Mythology. - In R. Arch. XVII, 1911, pp. 55-66 (4 figs.), GABRIEL WELTER discusses three reliefs of Gallo-Roman mythological sub- jects. The first, in the Lapidary Museum at Arlon (Belgian Luxembourg), represents an animal, apparently a female wolf, swallowing a small human being. Such representations occur on early Gallic monuments and in Romanesque art, but are rare in Gallo-Roman work. Evidently, however, the type persisted. The wolf is probably a deity of death. The second relief, in the Archaeological Museum at Arlon, represents (the lower part is want- ing) a bearded man with raised hands. A horned serpent is twined about his arms and chest. This may be a new variant of the bearded Mercury with the horned serpent. The third relief, in the Lapidary Museum at Luxembourg, represents a standing, half-draped youthful male figure. In his left hand he holds a cornucopia, in the right, probably a patera. Be- side him is a chest (arca), behind which is a stag's head, from the mouth of which a flood of round objects, probably coins, falls into the chest. Beside the stag's head was a bovine head, now much injured. In this relief the Gallic stag-deity is completely anthropomorphized, but the stag is figured incompletely beside him (as is also the bull). He was a god of plenty. GERMANY The Prehistoric Remains at Ofnet. - In Die spaetpalaeolithischen Be- stattungen der Ofnet (Wurzburg, 1910, pp. 1-7; pl., reprinted from Mannus), R. R. SCHMIrDT shows that the remains found at Ofnet date from the same</page><page sequence="46">578 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL.

The Roman Limes in Germany. - In Dolgozatok az Erdelyi Nemzeti Mitzeum (rem- e's regise'gtdrdbol, J, 1910, pp. 1-117 (30 figs.; map), A. BUDAY publishes a study of the Roman Limes in Germany as a preliminary work to the study of the Transylvanian Limes. A Roman Terra-cotta Bust at Trbves. - A new interpretation of the large terra-cotta bust (see Trierer Jahlr. II, 1909, p. 21) is given by P. WOL- TERS, who thinks the figure is that of a matron deity with child. Ram.- Germ. Kb. IV, 1911, p. 29). A Roman Relief.- In Ram.-Germ. Kb. IV, 1911, p. 33, J. JACOBS publishes a Roman relief measuring 0.95 m. by 0.35 m. with three figures representing Apollo, Minerva, and Mercury. The figures are rough and ill- proportioned. The slab which was found at Nassenfels in 1883 is now in the national museum of Munich. Alsengemmen. - In Z. Ethn. XLII, 1910, pp. 969-970 (fig.), F. W. MOSEBACH supplements with 15 more recent examples a list of 35 Alsen- gemmen, so named from the island Alsen, where the most famous specimen was found. This list was published ibid. 1887, pp. 691 and 698. He gives an illustration of one found in 1903 near Biickelburg. In these gems skele- ton-like human figures rudely scratched in the upper lighter colored stratum appear dark in a light field. It is uncertain whether the subjects repre- sented are pagan or Christian. A Clay Wheel. -In Z. Ethn. XLII, 1910, pp. 971 f., H. BUSSE describes a small clay wheel with four spokes, which he thinks a symbol of sun-wor- ship, and an urn of the early Bronze Age, with fourteen bosses, part pressed out from within and part added to the surface. The first was found near the Tegeler See (Berlin) and the second near Gosen (Beeskow-Storkow). HUNGARY The La-TBne Cemetery at Apahida. --In Dolgozatok az Erdelyi Nem- zeti Midzeum e'rem- e's re'gise'gtdrdbdl, II, 1911, pp. 1-69 (73 figs.), I. Kovics describes the prehistoric settlement and La-Thne cemetery at Apahida, 16 km. from Kolozsvir. GREAT BRITAIN Stonehenge.- In Z. Ethn. XLII, 1910, pp. 963 f., C. SCHUCHHARDT summarizes an article of his on Stonehenge (published later in Pridhistor- ische Zeitschrift, II, 1910, pp. 292-340). He regards the "astronomical stone" and the "battle stone" as having originally formed part of a second and older stone circle, and the altar stone is, he thinks, a fallen grave stele. Ashes and fragments of rough pottery found near the latter indicate a grave of the early Bronze Age (2100-1900 B.c., Montelius). He finds that discus- graves and hill-graves in the vicinity surround, in like manner, pit-graves, and, comparing similar circles in England and Scotland where stelae are still extant, and also the pit-graves of Mycenae, he concludes that Stone- henge and its like are not sun-temples, but graves, temples being at that time unknown, not only in northern Europe, but also in places where the Mycenaean civilization prevailed. He denies the astronomical orientation,</page><page sequence="47">AFRICA] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1911 579 claiming that the Britons reckoned time from the beginning of the night, and had no occasion to note the sunrise in particular. Ibid. XLIII, 1911, pp. 163-169, W. PASTOR argues that Stonehenge is a temple for sun- worship, built according to Penrose and Lockyer in 1680 B.c. He points to Hecataeus's statement in Diodorus, that there was in the island of the Hy- perboreans, opposite the land of the Celts, a remarkable circular temple sacred to Apollo, and claims that Tacitus was wrong in denying temples to the Germans, since he twice, in his later histories, refers to particular tem- ples. Schuchhardt, he says, errs in regarding the middle stone as a grave stele, in thinking that a mound formerly covered the whole, and that, since there is no entrance to the structure, it caniot have been a temple. Folk- customs and tradition, the exact orientation of the "battle-stone " and the "astronomical-stone," the via sacra, all contribute to show a temple for sun- worship. The surrounding hillocks could never have covered such great stones, and there are not one, but thirty entrances, the one toward the east slightly wider than the others. Ashes and poor pottery found in the centre must, therefore, come from a later interment. A discussion by Schuchhardt, Kiekebusch, and H. Schmidt follows. AFRICA The Mausoleum at Dougga.- In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1910, pp. 780-787 (fig.), L. POINSSOT describes the restoration of the mausoleum at Dougga, begun in 1908. Architectural fragments found in the vicinity make the restoration certain. Astral Symbols on Funeral Monuments of Northern Africa. - In R. Et. Anc. XIII, 1911, pp. 165-175 (10 figs.), J. ToUTAIN calls attention to the star and crescent, the sun, a head with rays, signs of the zodiac, etc., found on grave stelae of Northern Africa. They appear chiefly in towns which existed before the Roman conquest, and are not a Roman importation. The fact that the star and crescent are found on Punic monuments points to an Oriental origin. The signs probably had some religious significance. An Italiote Cuirass. -In Mon. Pliot, XVII, 1909, pp. 125-137 (2 pls.; 5 figs.) A. MERLIN publishes an Italiote cuirass found in 1909 in a Cartha- ginian tomb near Ksour-Es-Saf, 12 km. southwest of Mahdia. In the tomb were found a wooden sarcophagus containing remains of a skeleton with a girdle, and above in a niche in the wall a lamp and the cuirass. This con- sists of front and back plates ornamented with a head of Minerva below and two bosses above, while bands of decoration fill in the spaces between and run along the edges. The fastenings passing over the shoulders and around the sides still exist. This type of cuirass was used in Camrpania in the third century B.C. as is proved by vase paintings and by specimens actually found. The warrior who was buried in this tomb thus lived in the time of the second Punic war. The Troglodytes of Jebel Garian. - In Or. Litt. XIV, 1911, cols. 1-14, E. BRANDENBURG describes a city of cave-dwellings that exists in the Jebel Garian on the eastern edge of the oasis of Tripoli. The houses consist of a sunken court, which is reached by a long, inclined passage, and from the court open out a number of cave-dwellings in all directions. The inhabit- ants belong to the Arab stock.</page><page sequence="48">580 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XV, 1911 EARLY CHRISTIAN, BYZANTINE, AND MEDIAEVAL ART GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS A Coptic Representation of Christianity Triumphant. - In Sitzb. Miin. Akad. 1910, No. 3 (6 pp.; pl.), F. W. v. BISSING publishes a small bronze, of rude workmanship, in his collection. A nude female figure stands with crossed legs on a beast's head. In her raised hands she holds a wreath and a palm branch. About her is a sort of hoop, which rises from the foot of the whole object, and bears at the top, above the head of the figure, a Coptic cross. On separate leaves or branches extending outwards from the hoop are four birds, - two doves, and two cocks. The whole sym- bolizes Christianity triumphant, and serves to explain several hitherto im- perfectly understood Coptic works. The Treasure of Stmm&amp;. --In R. Arch. XVII, 1911, pp. 407-419 (pl.; 2 figs.), JEAN EBERSOLT publishes and discusses four objects of silver which were found at Stfima, in the district of Aleppo, and are now in the Museum at Constantinople. One is a liturgic fan (gilded) adorned with a design of a winged cherub or seraph in the middle and a border of feathers. On the handle are inscriptions made with stamps. The three other objects are plates. On one is Jesus (represented twice) giving bread and wine to the twelve disciples. This plate is gilded, and has an inscription on the rim. The other two plates are not gilded. In each a cross is incised. One has an inscription. The style of the work and the letters of the inscriptions point to the latter part of the sixth or the early part of the seventh century, as the date of these products of Syrian industry. Islamic Ivory Caskets.- In Jb. Preuss. Kunsts. XXXII, 1911, pp. 117- 142, E. DIEZ finishes his account of Mohammedan painted ivory caskets. Their ornament consists in animal and human figures, hunting-scenes, and even Christian subjects. Their general style is that known as the Seljuk imperial style, which flourished in Mesopotamia and Syria in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and was carried also into Egypt and Asia Minor. Most of the caskets originated in Syria and Mesopotamia. Occasionally one shows indications of Egyptian provenience, and it is possible that a few were made in Southern Italy, or Sicily. Miniatures in a Syrian Manuscript. - In Mlon. Piot, XVII, 1909, pp. 85-98 (5 pls.) H. OMONT publishes a Syriac manuscript of the seventh or eighth century recently acquired by the BibliothBque Nationale. It origi- nally contained the Old and New Testaments with illustrations, but now only the Old Testament remains with twenty-three of the original thirty minia- tures. These are described in detail. The Mosaics of St. Demetrius. - In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1911, pp. 25- 32, C. DIEHL shows that the publication of the mosaics of the church of Saint Demetrius at Salonica (see A.J.A. XIII, p. 522; XIV, p. 527) in the Bulletin de l' Institut russe de Constantinople, needs revision in several places. Much useful information concerning the scenes portrayed may be found in the Miracula of St. Demetrius, written in the seventh century. Several of the panels were constructed at the expense of certain donors, as inscriptions prove. The words 34pp/apov KUaiVa /apfppwv ordXtov of one inscription refer to the attack of the Slavs on the town about 617-619 A.D.

John VI Palaeologus and Hubert Van Eyck.--In R. Arch. XVI, 1910, pp. 369-377 (10 figs.), S. REINACH identifies on the inner wings of the Ghent altarpiece (Reinach, Re'pertoire, II, p. 705), now in Berlin, the follow- ing portraits: John VI Palaeologus, the Duc de Berry, King Henry V of England (with some doubts), and Saint Louis. The inscriptions Justi Judices and Milites Christi on the frame may or may not go back to the Van Eycks. At any rate, the first wing seems to contain portraits of princes of the time of the Van Eycks, and the other to represent dis- tinguished men of earlier days. Byzantine Buildings in Elis.--At an open meeting of the German Archaeological Institute in Athens, February 1, 1911, Mr. Struck discussed some of the Byzantine buildings at Elis. The remains of most of these buildings are, unfortunately, in a very poor state of preservation. However, some can be traced back to as early a date as the eighth century A.D., and in a later period we find a mixture of Greek and Frankish motives in the buildings. Many of the older Greek and Byzantine buildings were taken over and " Frankicised " by the invaders, who had one of their chief seats of government in Elis, where we find Frankish settlements as early as 1205, at Glarentza, and in the neighboring district. Later, many others were established, such as Belvedere, Andravida, Gastuni, Geraki, and Kephala. Androvida, settled by Gottfried II, was an important centre, with three churches and a monastery. A mausoleum, built here by Gottfried II, con- tains his own tomb, together with those of his successors. This was the judicial centre of the district, the church of St. Sophia there being used as a court-room. Glarentza also was fortified (1220-1222) by G.ottfried, who built there the Gothic church. Olenos, the seat of the archbishop, had a famous convent, but this was later burned. The twelfth century church at Gastini belongs to this same Franko-Byzantine style. But the most exten- sive and interesting remains are those of Chlemutzi-Glarentza, belonging to the year 1222. Since the place was considered the strategic key to the whole region, especial care was bestowed upon its defences, many of which still remain in a good state of preservation and form one of the most impos- ing sights of that region. Since the position here was so important, the church was placed over the entrance, that it, by its sanctity, might serve as a protection against invaders. The "Galop Volant" on a Byzantine Ivory.- In R. Arch. XVII, 1911, pp. 428-432 (fig.), Louis Ba~HIER discusses an ivory casket in the museum at Ravenna. On one side a lion, a winged griffin with eagle's beak, and a winged lion are hunting deer or antelopes. All are running with forelegs extended forwards and hind legs backwards ("galop volant"). This motif, common in "Mycenaean " art, but not found in the art of classic Greece and Rome, came into Byzantine art through the art of Sassanide Persia. Such decorative art was encouraged by the iconoclastic emperors. The other designs on the casket at Ravenna are less remarkable, but their variety-- griffins, harpies, putti- testifies to the eclecticism of the art of the time, about the tenth century. Is Romanesque Art Byzantine? - In Rep. f. K. XXXIV, 1911, pp. 93-114, B. HAENDCKE attacks the widespread assumption that the</page><page sequence="50">582 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XV, 1911 styles of western Europe, from the Carolingian period to the Gothic, are founded on the imitation of imported Byzantine ivories and miniatures. He shows that political, commercial, social, and religious conditions from 800 to 1200 were not of a kind to permit the considerable intercourse with Constantinople that such a theory presupposes. The revivals of the Caro- lingian period and the twelfth century are rather due either to Italian influ- ence (cf. Cohn-Wiener's article on Romanesque architecture in Alsace-Lor- raine, Mh. f. Kunstw. IV, 1911, pp. 116 f.), or to the inherent capacity of the local schools. ITALY Metrical Inscriptions from Roman Churches.--In Me'l. Arch. Hist. XXX, 1910, pp. 279-311, L. DUCHESNE discusses a number of metrical inscriptions from Roman churches, that are scattered through the biogra- phies of certain popes from Damasus to John VII (t 707), in a manuscript of the Liber Pontificalis of the twelfth century, now in the library of the University of Cambridge. While these inscriptions have been very mate- rially changed in many cases, Duchesne recognizes seven as new and of some value. The Crowning with Thorns in the Catacomb of Praetextatus.-- DE 'WAAL, in R'm. Quartalschrift, 1911, pp. 1-18, discusses the fresco of the "Crowning with Thorns" in the catacomb of Praetextatus, proposing a series of possible interpretations. He expresses himself as dissatisfied with those advanced hitherto, according to which the scene represents the "Crowning with Thorns," or the "Baptism of Christ," or the "kingdom " of Christ in contrast to the errors of the Gnostics. De Waal suggests that the artist may have had in mind the eighth parable in the Pastor of Her- mas, in which the angel distributes branches to men, which grow green in the hands of the elect but wither in those of the others. The elect then receives a crown, which would explain the wreath on the head of the princi- pal figure in the fresco, toward whom another figure extends a branch. Another possible interpretation would see in the scene an early conception of the Jonah-story. Even a pagan inspiration is admissible. Asymetries in the Baptistery and the Cathedral at Pisa. - In Bulle- tin of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, VI, 1911, pp. 35-39 (5 figs.), W. H. GOODYEAR shows that in the Baptistery at Pisa there is a foundation slope of 9 inches and a vertical inclination of 15 inches. The object of this was to preserve the beauty of the base. Ibid. pp. 59-66 (7 figs.) he shows that Pisa Cathedral was also built to the surface slopes, e.g. the northwest angle of the fagade is 3 feet higher than the southeast angle of the choir. The platform of the fagade slopes 10? inches. Ibid. pp. 139-144 (8 figs.) he shows that the great middle string course of the cathedral is 2 feet out of level. Ibid. pp. 167-174 (6 figs.) he shows that the windows of the gal- leries are arranged in a rough curve; thus, the height of the fifth sill from the west end in the south gallery is 4? inches above the first and 6? inches above the last sill. Much the same thing is true of the line of pilasters below the string course. On the south side the capital of the sixth pilaster is 2 feet 10? inches above the capital of the pilaster of the facade angle, and 3 feet 14 inches above that of the pilaster of the transept angle. The fact that there are approximately the same variations on both sides of ,the build-</page><page sequence="51">CHalsTIAN ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1911 583 ing proves that they were not accidental. Ibid. pp. 215-222 (8 figs.) he shows that there are horizontal curves in the plan, e.g. in the outer walls of the church, in the interior gallery parapets, in the clerestory walls, in the alignment of the columns which separate the aisles of the galleries, etc. Ibid. pp. 323-328 (5 figs.) he proves that these asymetries were intentional. Giotto's Frescoes in the Arena Chapel at Padua.--In Jb. Preuss. Kunrsts. XXXII, 1911, pp. 3-18, A. L. ROMDAHL discusses the chronology of the cycle of frescoes in the Arena chapel Padua, concluding that the series depicting the Life of Christ is earlier than that of the Life of Mary. The former show the influence of Giovanni Pisano, while the latter are so a:i~?-n: ~Sb9~~~~~~~ a r ~u0 ~--- ~ m-il s~~~ FIGURE 4. - THE CHURCH OF S.

S. Angelo in Perugia. - In Boll. Arte, V, 1911, pp. 28-32, D. VIVIANI studies the history of S. Angelo in Perugia and finds that it was not trans- formed into its present state in the tenth or eleventh century, but about 1300. The primitive construction was doubtless Christian, and dates from the fifth century (see Fig. 4). It forms a striking parallel to S. Stefano Rotondo at Rome. An Exultet Roll.--In Me'l. Arch. Hist.

MIARQUET DE VASSELOT shows that the arms on the " Monvaerni " enamels formerly in the Raif6 collection (bought in 1908 by Mr. J. P.

Delisle, espe- cially in connection with the replicas of the Grandes Heures of Anne of Brittany, and then shows by numerous examples that from the ninth to the fourteenth century the artists of miniatures signed their works. Ibid. pp. 443-449, he replies to letters by H. Omont and P. Durrieu, which appeared in the previous number of R. A rch. and criticised his articles on signatures of mediaeval French artists. The Cameos of the Cross of Saint-Andrd-le-Bas. -In Mon. Piot, XVII, 1909, pp. 75-84 (5 figs.) A. BLANCHET describes two Byzantine cameos in the museum of Lyons. One, of green jasper, 6 cm. by 4.5 cm., represents St. Nicholas and dates from the tenth or eleventh century; the other a sar- donyx, 9.5 cm. by 5.5 cm., represents an emperor of the family of Constantine and dates from the fourth century. The writer proves by means of a manu- script in the Louvre dated November 19, 1612, that these cameos were set in a processional cross in the Benedictine abbey of Saint-Andrd-le-Bas, Vienne, and were removed during the Revolution. GERMANY The Evolution of Gothic Sculpture in Saxony. - The movement which sets in at the beginning of the thirteenth century in Saxon sculpture can be traced through such works as the Crucifixion of Halberstadt (cathe- dral), those of Freiberg (now in the Museum des Altertumsvereins in Dres- den), and of Wechselberg, the chancel of Wechselberg, the Golden Portal of Freiberg, and the tomb of Henry the Lion and his wife in the cathedral of Braunschweig. The culmination of the mnovement is found in the sculp- tures of Naumburg cathedral. It is a movement from a decorative to a naturalistic style, from an architectonic to a pictorial conception of sculp- ture, from a symbolical and typical rendering of the human body and soul to one that is individual. The technical factor by which these tendencies make themselves felt is the treatment of movement. (K. FREYER, i1h. f. Kunstw. IV, 1911, pp. 261-275.) The Beginnings of Suabian Gothic.--The earliest knowledge of Gothic was introduced into Suabian architecture by the Cistercians. The Franciscans produced a greater effect, however, with their church at Esslin- gen, the influence of which is shown in St. Dionysius of the same city and in the Stadtkirchen of Heilbronn and Leonberg. The first Gothic basilica with complete vaulting was the Domiliican church of St. Paul at Esslingen</page><page sequence="53">RENAISSANCE ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1911 585 (1233-68), from which was derived the church in Markgraningen of the end of the thirteenth and the beginning of the fourteenth century. The predominance of the monastic orders in the architectural field and the per- sistence of Romnanesque tradition delayed the development of these types into the complete Gothic edifice, notably with respect to fagade, decoration, towers, buttresses, etc. Two sources lent themselves to this final step: the cathedral of Wiirzburg, and, for West Suabia, the Stiftskirche at Wimpfen. The earliest church showing the complete Gothic form is the Marieniikirche at Reutlingen, of the end of the thirteenth century. (H. KLAIBER, Rep. f. K. XXXIII, 1910, pp. 498-508.) Italian Influence on Romanesque Architecture in Alsace-Lorraine. - In iMh.f. Kunstw. IV, 1911, pp. 116-122, E. CoHN-WIENER has collected a group of churches showing the strong influence of Italy on the architec- ture of Alsace-Lorraine in the twelfth century. His most noteworthy examples are the facade Laitre-sous-Amance, which shows a remarkable resemblance to that of S. Andrea at Pistoja, and the portals of Vomd-court- sur-Madon and Andlau. The Portraits of the German Emperors and Kings. - In Rep. f. K. XXXIII, 1910, pp. 509-524, W. SCHEFFLER finishes his catalogue of the portraits, both in literature and art, of the German emperors and kings of the later Middle Ages, from Adolf of Nassau to Maximilian I (1292-1519). The article is accompanied by a bibliography. An Alleged Representation of Noah. - Forrer's interpretation of the scene on the medallion of a Roman urn dating from 50-150 A.D. and found at Kanigshafen, as representing Noah and the animals (see Anz. f. Elsdss. Alt. II, 1910, pp. 121 ff.) is questioned by A. ABT (R6m.-Germ. Kb. IV, 1911, pp. 8-14), who interprets it as a scene of magical import designed to avert the evil eye and protect the contents of the vessel. GREAT BRITAIN French Influence in the Arundel Psalter.- Vitzthum's supposition of the dependence of English miniatures on the Paris school in the thir- teenth century and at the beginning of the fourteenth is given fresh support by W. F. STORCK in Mh. f. Kunstw. IV, 1911, pp. 123-126. A miniature of the Arundel Psalter, representing the "' Three Living and the Three Dead," is evidently derived from the similar illustration in a French manuscript (3142 f. 311 in the BibliothBque de l'Arsenal at Paris). This makes it probable that the English manuscript dates nearer 1300 than has hitherto been assumed. Anglo-Saxon Strap-tabs.- In Ann. Arch. Anthr. IV, 1911, pp. 1-10 (pl.; fig.), E. LEEDS publishes two pairs of silver strap-tabs in the Liv- erpool museum. They are of Anglo-Saxon workmanship. One pair is adorned with a monstrous, conventional lion, and the other with four ani- mal heads linked together. The workman followed Irish models which had come from the continent. The tabs date from the latter half of the ninth century. They throw some light on the Ormside cup, which was mnade about the end of the seventh century and repaired towards the end of the ninth.</page><page sequence="54">586 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XV, 1911 RENAISSANCE ART GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS The Definition of Baroque.--In Rep. f. K. XXXIV, 1911, pp. 17-26, R. HEDICKE maintains that the word baroque should not be considered as standing for an architectural style or, more vaguely, as a name for the complex of the artistic ideas of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but should be applied to revolt against the laws of any style, be it antique, mrediaeval, or modern, or to the intentional departure from the limits of a style in order to obtain a given artistic effect. Thus, we should speak of a Greek baroque, or of a Roman, and certainly such a phenomenon can be seen in the Gothic of the fifteenth century. The Codex Escurialensis and Sangallo.-In Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XIII, 1911, pp. 210-230 (11 figs.), C. HUELSEN shows by numerous comparisons that the Codex Escurialensis 28-II-12 is the work of Giuliano da Sangallo. He also appends a note on the Nereid sarcophagus of Monte Cavallo. ITALY Documents on the Building of St. Peter's.- K. FREY publishes in the Beiheft of Jb. Preuss. Kunsts. 1910 a series of documents bearing on the works undertaken in the Vatican, the Castello Sant' Angelo, the Magli- ana (the papal hunting-lodge), at S. Maria in Domnica (the Navicella), and for the completion of St. Peter's in the reigns of Julius II, Leo X, Hadrian VI, and Clement VII. Works from the Bottega of Antonio Rizzo. - The wooden group "Tobias and the Archangel," a reproduction of which appeared in A.J.A. XIV, 1910, p. 393, is assigned by A. MORINI in Rass. d'Arte, XI, 1911, pp. 70-72 to the bottega of Antonio Rizzo. A similar origin is claimed for two other wooden figures at Cascia, a St. Sebastian and a Dead Christ. Paolo Da Gualdo. - A. Muvoz has succeeded in further defining the personality of the fifteenth century sculptor Paolo da Gualdo, by discovering his full signature on the tomb of Briobris in S. Francesco at Vetralla (Prov- ince of Rome).: M. PAVLVS DE GVALDO CATTANIE ME FECIT. This shows that his real title is Paolo da Gualdo Cattaneo, near Spoleto in Umbria. Other works of his, besides the two well-known Roman monu- ments, the Stefaneschi tomb in S. Maria in Trastevere and the Carafa tomb in S. Maria del Priorato, are the Anguillara monument in S. Francesco at Capranica di Sutri, and the memorial tablet of Niccolo de Summa, a Nea- politan nobleman (d. 1403) in the cathedral of Civitacastellana. (Mh. f. Kunstw. IV, 1911, pp. 73-76.) The Signatures of the Dosso Brothers. - HENRIETTE M[ENDELSOHNK, discussing the signatures of the Dosso brothers in Burl. Mag. XIX, 1911, pp. 79-80, points out that the elder brother, Giovanni, alone uses the simple name Dosso without further qualification. The bone thrust through a D in the "St. Jerome " of the Imperial Gallery at Vienna is a play upon the name D-osso and was never used again. Morelli was mistaken in thinking that the same signature could be found in a picture of the Galleria Bor- ghese and in the "Expulsion of the Money-Changers" in the Doria Gallery. As a rule neither brother signed his pictures, the Vienna example marking an exception.</page><page sequence="55">RENAISSANCE ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1911 587 The Frescoes of the Monastero Maggiore. -In Rass. d'Arte, XI, 1911 pp. 9-15, U. NEBBIA discusses the frescoed decoration of the Monas- tero Maggiore at Milan. The article contains a critical commentary on the frescoes of Luini, and also publishes some little known frescoes of the four- teenth and fifteenth centuries which still exist in the so-called "Torre d'Ansperto." Tintoretto's Works in the Libreria and the Procuratia Di Supra at Venice.- D. voN HADELN contributes to Jb. Preuss. Kunsts. XXXII, 1911, pp. 25-58, a documentary study, in which he shows that Tintoretto had a part in the decoration of Sansovino's Libreria at Venice, and that of the nine philosophers which he painted for the main hall of the Library, two have come down to us, viz. the figures with globe and writing-tablet, respectively, now in the Palazzo Reale; and possibly a third, in Vienna ( Vorrat der Kaiserl. Gemiildegalerie). The figures are to be dated 1571-1572. Documents also show that in 1571 there existed eleven portraits of " Pro- curatori" which Tintoretto painted for the Procuratia di Supra, of which two can be to-day identified, the portraits of Antonio Capello and Marchio Michiel. Of later procurators, three portraits, painted by Tintoretto, are still preserved (Federigo Contarini, Andrea Dolfin, Giacomo Soranzo). The writer also shows that a document of 1568, which has been supposed to refer to one of the four Miracles of St. Mark, and to demonstrate that Tin- toretto was its author, cannot refer to a picture of this series, since one of them was painted in 1548 and the other three between 1562 and 1566. The "Madonna Delle Rocche."--In Gaz. B.-A., IV, 1911, pp. 437-446, S. REINACH reviews the evidence on the respective authenticity of the ver- sions of Madonna delle Rocche in the National Gallery and the Louvre and comes to the conclusion that both are the work of Leonardo, who, however, was assisted by Ambrogio da Predis in the case of the former picture. The Madonna of the Louvre must have been painted at Florence before 1483. In that year Leonardo, according to a document published by Biscaro (Arch. Stor. Lomb., 1910, pp. 150-155), received the order to paint a " Vergine Im- mnacolata" for the church of S. Francesco in Milan, an order which he failed to fill for nine years and then substituted a replica of the Louvre Madonna. In this he must have limited himself to the heads and flesh portions, leav- ing the rest and the wings of the triptych to be finished by Amnbrogio. This replica is the picture in the National Gallery. The Portraits of Catarina Cornaro. - In Mh.f. Kunstw. IV, 1911, pp. 12-18, E. SCHAEFFER discusses the portraits of Catarina Cornaro, pointing out that the rendering of the royal lady took two forms, one realistic, the other imaginative. The former is represented only by the portraits of Gen- tile Bellini, who depicts the queen of Cyprus in the "Miracle of the Cross" and in a portrait at Budapest as old, fat, and asthmatic. The portraits of Titian and Giorgione represented her as beautiful and young. The Nine Heroines. - A propos of a cassone-front in the Palazzo dei Marchesi Chigi Zondadari at Siena with figures of Hippo, Camnilla, and Lu- cretia, published by Marchese P. Misciatelli in Rass. d'Arte Senese of 1910, F. NOVATI contributes an interesting article to Rass. d'Arte, XI, 1911, pp. 61-65, tracing the development of the "heroine-motif" in the art and litera- ture of the Renaissance. The three women on the Siena cassone are hero- ines of chastity, but the original conception was of nine warrior-women, to</page><page sequence="56">588 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XV, 1911 form a pendant to the "Nove Prodi," and the nucleus of the group consisted of Amazons, Sinope, Lampeto, Hippolyta, Penthesilea, etc. Heroines of love-stories were later substituted, and the three chaste women of the Siena cassone are doubtless an offshoot of this form of the motif. The best ex- amples of the nine warrior-heroines are those represented in the frescoes of the castle of Manta, and in a manuscript, cod. 12559, of the Bibliothbque Nationale. A series of sonnets in honor of the heroines of love is to be found in cod. Magliabech. II. II. 40. c. 2168-217 B, and is believed by Novati to be designed for inscriptions under painted figures like those of the castle of Manta. Federigo Barocci's Drawings.--In Abh. Sdchs. Ges. XXVIII (No. III), 1910 (46 pp.; 12 pls.; fig.), AUGUST SCHMARSOW continues his critical study of Federigo Barocci (see A.J.A. XIV, 1910, p. 256) with a descrip- tion and discussion of the drawings in the other Italian collections. Those in the Uffizi gallery were treated in the previous paper. A Pontifical by Francesco dai Libri.- In Mon. Piot, XVII, 1909, pp. 99-124 (3 pls.; 2 figs.), L. DOREZ. describes a pontifical in the possession of J. P. Morgan written towards the end of the fifteenth century for Cardinal Giuliano Della Rovere. It consists of 158 leaves and was embellished with miniatures by Francesco dai Libri. Eight alone are entirely by his hand, two others are in part his, the rest by other artists who had nothing in common with him. All are described in detail. Claudio Ridolfi. - In Rass. bibl. arte ital. 1911, pp. 1-11, E. CALZINI gives an account of the painter Claudio Ridolfi of Verona (1570-1644), the pupil of Federigo Barocci, together with a catalogue of his works. Seventeenth Century Artists in Roman Galleries.--In Rep. f. K. XXXIV, 1911, pp. 119-125, H. Voss completes his critical examination of the painters of the seventeenth century represented in the Roman collections. Italian MVedals. - G. F. HILL continues his notes on Italian medals in Burl. Mag. XIX, 1911, pp. 138-144. He stamps as a forgery the signature PI SAN US F on a small medal of Lionello d'Este, which shows many affini- ties with the work of the medallist Nicholaus. A medal of Giustiniano Cavitelli in the British Museum is added to the signed works of Sperandio, and publication is also given to a medal recently bought by Mr. Oppen- heimer, struck in honor of Bernardo Nasi, prior of Florence in 1478 and again in 1504. The portrait on Pomedelli's medal of Angela Brenzoni en- ables us to identify with that lady a terra-cotta bust in the Victoria and Albert Museum. SPAIN A Critique of Velasques. - In Mh. f. Kunstw. IV, 1911, pp. 176-182, A. L. MAYER defends Velasquez against the disparagement he has suffered at the hands of Meier-Graefe in his Spanische Reise, wherein he is compared unfavorably to El Greco. Contrasting the tendencies of the two artists, he denies the possibility of Greco's having influenced Velasquez, who shows but one real influence in his whole career, that of Tintoretto, plainly mani- fest in the Surrender of Breda. Nicholas Fiorentino in Salamanca. - The artist, Nicholas Fiorentino, described in Baedeker as a pupil of Giotto, decorated the apse of the old cathedral of Salamanca. The date of the work is fixed by that of the con-</page><page sequence="57">RENAISSANCE ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1911 589 tract, still preserved in the archives of the cathedral, of the year 1445. He was, of course, no pupil of Giotto's, but his work shows that he was really a Florentine in his art as well as his birth. His style, derived indeed from that of Giotto, is nevertheless entirely Quattrocentist and shows many affini- ties with Ghiberti, Masaccio, and Filippo Lippi. A careful analysis of the 55 episodes of the New Testament with which the lower part of the apse is decorated shows a development of his style toward the Spanish realism which surrounded him in his adopted country. (A. SCHMARSOW, Mh. f. Kunstw. IV, 1911, pp. 143-161.) Juan de Ruelas. -Mh.f Kunstw. IV, 1911, pp. 51-72, contains an ac- count of Juan de Ruelas, an artist of the seventeenth century, by A. L. MAYER. He was the progenitor of the school of Seville of the seventeenth century, and the teacher of Velasquez and Zurbaran, but little is known of his life. In his pictures he shows his acquaintance with Tintoretto, whom he studied in Venice; in some, also, he betrays a mystic naturalism which savors of Greco and Ribera, with the latter of whom he has many affinities. A Portrait of an Infanta of Spain. - ROBLOT-DELONDRE, in Gaz. B.-A. IV, 1911, pp. 324-329, identifies the subject of No. 297 in the Augs- burg gallery with the Infanta Catherine-Michelle, daughter of Philippe II and Duchess of Savoy. The painter is neither Titian nor Moroni, but an artist of the Portuguese-Spanish school of the sixteenth century. FRANCE A " Oarden of Love" of Philip the Good. - In R. Arch. XVII, 1911, pp. 420-427 (2 figs.), ROBLOT-DELONDRE publishes a painting in Versailles (No. 4021), which agrees with the description by Argote de Molina (see R. Arch. XVI, 1910, pp. 52-70), of a painting in the Pardo. The painting at Versailles is a faithful sixteenth century copy of an original of the first quarter of the fifteenth century. The original must have been produced about 1420, in the school in which Hubert and Jan van Eyck were trained. The picture represents Duke Philip the Good, of Burgundy, surrounded by ladies and gentlemen, in a landscape setting. A Little-known French Painter.- In Burl. Mag. XVIII, 1911, pp. 48-55, MARY F. S. HERVEY and R. MARTIN-HOLLAND, discuss the work of Felix Chritien in connection with a picture in the collection of Admiral Johnston Stuart. The painting represents Moses and Aaron before Pha- raoh, but the king is given the features of Francis I, while Aaron is turned into Frangois de Dinteville, bishop of Auxerre, and other figures are por- traits of his three brothers. The picture is in a sense an allegory of a crisis in the Dinteville fortunes, when the intrigues of Madame d'Etampes threat- ened Fran9ois with the loss of his bishopric. Felix Chr~tien, the painter of the picture, was the bishop's painter in ordinary, accompanied his master into exile in Italy, and was rewarded after his return with a canonry in Auxerre cathedral. Other works of his are the "Martyrdom of St. Ste- phen," in Auxerre cathedral, and a triptych of the " Life of St. Eug~nie," in the church of Varzy, NiBvre. His art reflects the fluctuating character of French painting in the early sixteenth century, showing the influence, not yet dominant, of the Italian school, and still betraying a tendency to cling to the traditions of the national style.</page><page sequence="58">590 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XV, 1911 The "Ecce Homo" of Jean Hay.--In R. Arch. XVII, 1911, pp. 314- 319 (pl.), F. DE MELY identifies the Jean Hay, mentioned in the inscription on the back of an "Ecce Homo"-belonging to M. Michy, of Chdcy (Loiret), with the Jean Hay who is highly praised by Lemaire de Belges, in his Plainte du De'sire' sur la mort de Louis de Luxembourg, ... mort . . . le 31 de'embre, 1503 . . He was no doubt a Flemish artist. A Child's Portrait in the Louvre. - In Gaz. B.-A. IV, 1911, pp. 204-208, P. LEPRIEUR discusses a portrait of a child in the Louvre which dates from the end of the fifteenth century and in style closely resembles a portrait of the dauphin Charles Orlant, son of Charles VIII of France and Anne of Brittany. He conjectures that it represents their other son, who died in infancy. Bernini and the Altar of Val-de-Grace. - The altar of the church of VTal-de-Grace, in its twisted columns, polychromy, and exuberance and bold- ness of ornament, at once recalls the altar of St. Peter's and makes it difficult to believe that the design could have originated with one of the French artists of the period. The substitution of the oval for the square plan of the altar of St. Peter's, and of a garland for the architrave point also to a natural development of Bernini's style from the timidity of his first efforts as represented by the Roman monument. The argument from style for his authorship is confirmed by passages in the Journal of De Chantelou and in a letter of Mattia Rossi, which show that Anne of Austria asked Bernini for a design for the altar, that the design which he executed closely resem- bles the present monument, and that the altar was finally built after Ber- nini's design by Le Duc Michel Anguier. (M. REYMOND, Gaz. B.-A. IV, 1911, pp. 367-394.) The Tomb of Diane de Poitiers.- The fragments of the tomb of Diane de Poitiers, constructed at Anet by command of the duchess herself, are now at Versailles. The tomb was broken up in the Revolution, restored by Lenoir for his Musde des Monuments Frangais, dispersed again when this collection was scattered, reconstituted by Louis Philippe in his park at Neuilly, and finally its separated fragments have found a resting place at Versailles That many of the present fragments have nothing to do with the tomb in its original state is shown by descriptions which antedate the Revolution, a contractor's memorandum descriptive of the materials to be used for the tomb, dating a few weeks after the death of Diane, and a drawing of GaigniBre's collection, all of which show a monument of much simpler character than that indicated by the present fragments, or the pro- jected restoration of Roussel. (A. Roux, Gaz. B.-A. IV, 1911, pp. 291-297.) The Medallion Portrait of a Lady in the Cabinet des Mgdailles. -- A. Venturi and Angeli have both doubted the propriety of attributing the medallion portrait of a lady in the Cabinet des Midailles to Mino da Fiesole, in spite of the signature OPUS M INI on the back. Venturi goes so far as to call the work "more than suspicious." In Gaz. B.-A. IV, 1911, pp. 149-156, J. DE FOVILLE shows that the authenticity of the piece can hardly be doubted, inasmuch as the history of the medallion can be traced back to the Revolution, when it entered the Bibliothbque Nationale, and it is hardly possible that this period would have produced a forgery of Mino's style. Comparison of details with other works of the sculptor confirms the impres- sion of genuineness. The writer dates the work ca. 1472.</page><page sequence="59">RENAISSANCE ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1911 591 The "Trbs Riches Heures" of the Due de Berry.- The miniatures of the first part of the "Tris riches Heures" of Duke Jean de Berry (see A.J.A. XV, 1911, p. 257 f.) show an undeniable Italian influence, which is not to be traced to Michelino da Besozzo or Giovannino dei Grassi, but to some pre-Pisanellesque source like the painter of the frescoes in the Palazzo Borromeo in Milan. The archives of the duke show that in 1409 he received an artist from Siena, who is possibly to be identified with Dome- nico di Nicolo del Coro. An Adoration of the Magi in the manuscript rep- resents a view of Siena in its background. (F. DE MIlLY, C. R. Acad. Insc. 1911, pp. 182-190.) Jacques Coeur as Builder and Friend of Art. - In Sitzb. Mlfiin. Akad. 1911, No. 1 (70 pp.; 7 pls.), HANS PRUTZ describes the importance in the history of art of Jacques Coeur of Bourges, the wealthy financier, merchant, soldier, diplomat, and organizer of the time of Charles VII. His house at Bourges is described in detail, as is also a richly illuminated parchment manuscript prayer-book which was made for and used by him. It is now in the Hof- und Staatsbibliothek in Munich. Jacques Coeur was evidently a man of taste and culture, a friend of art. Eduard EKolloff and the Private Collections at Paris in 1841.- In R. Arch. XVI, 1910, pp. 413-417, S. R(EINACH) gives a brief account of such publications as exist concerning private cqllections in Paris sixty years or more ago. Among these is one, now very rare, by Eduard Kolloff, who died in 1877. BELGIUM The Boy with the Goose in Flemish Painting.--In Mh. f. Kunstw. IV, 1911, pp. 20-23, P. G. HiUBNER devotes the third of his 'Studien iiber das Verhailtnis der Renaissance zur Antike' to this motif, which is found as a piece of statuary ornamenting the architectural background of the Madonna of St. Luke (Rodolphinum, Prague), by Jan Gossaert, and as the centrepiece of a fountain in David Teniers the Younger's Marriage of the Artist in the Rothschild collection in London. The Renaissance artists derived the motif from an antique once in the Savelli collection at Rome. GERMANY Attributions in German Galleries. - In Rass. d'Arte, XI, 1911, pp. 33-42, G. BERNARDINI corrects a number of attributions in German gal- leries. A Holy Family with Donors and Saints in the Imperial Gallery at Vienna, there assigned to Previtali, is given to Francesco (Rizo) da Santa Croce, and a female portrait in the same collection ascribed to Bonifacio is assigned instead to Savoldo. In the'Munich Pinakothek a Judgment of Solomon is ascribed by the writer to Giovanni Francesco Carotto, and a series of "Triumphs" is given to F. Bousignori and assistants. A Madonna in the Kaiser-Friedrich Museum in Berlin, there ascribed to Fiorenzo di Lorenzo, shows the influence also of Crivelli and is to be assigned to an artist of Umbria or the Marche, who felt the effect of the art of both mas- ters. A Tobias and Three Angels in the same gallery, ascribed to Giovanni Boccati, is rather by a follower of his or of Bonfigli. Duke Sigmund and the Frauenkirche in Munich. - In Sitzb. Miin. Aklad. 1910, No. 9 (16 pp.), S. RIEZLER shows by means of the inscription</page><page sequence="60">592 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XV, 1911 at the southeastern Bride-portal of the Frauenkirche at M1unich that Duke Sigmuud had an important share in the building of the church, the corner stone of which he laid in 1468. He caused the erection of churches at Pipping and Blutenburg very soon after. The heraldic glass paintings at Blutenburg are discussed. The Hausbuchmeister. -In Mh. f. Kunstw. IV, 1911, pp. 95-115 and 162-175, E. FLECHSIG presents a number of interesting discoveries regarding the Hausbuchmeister. He designed the woodcuts for the edition of the Speculum humanae sal'ationis, which was printed by Drach in Speyer, as Flechsig shows, in 1481/2. He also did the woodcuts of the Almanach of 1483, which is also to be assigned to Drach's press. The monogram of his copyist, the enigmatical "b x 8," is to be read B. G. The dialect of the inscriptions of the woodcuts of the Speculum points to Ulm, and that the Hausbuchmeister worked in that city is shown by the fact that he designed the woodcuts for a number of works printed in Ulm. He can be traced also at Esslingen, and Flechsig concludes that the artist was probably a native of Ulm, worked there from 1472 to 1475, chiefly as designer for the press of Johannes Zainer, went from Ulmrn perhaps to Esslingen, and finally removed to Speyer about 1480, where he died after 1505. An article en- titled 'Ein Friihwerk des Hausbuchmeisters' is contributed to Z. bild. K. XLVI, 1911, pp. 139-145, by H. T. BOSSERT, in which he ascribes the Crowning with Thorns in the Karlsruhe gallery to the HIausbuchmeister, regarding it as the earliest known work of the artist, having been painted at least as early as 1455. It is strongly impregnated with the influence of the Master E. S. and of Heinrich Lang, and was apparently painted in Konstanz or its neighborhood. The date of the Hausbuchmeister's birth must therefore be set back to ca. 1430-35. In R. Arch. XVII, 1911, pp. 307-314 (2 pls.), CHARLES OULMONT discusses a Crucifixion in the museum at Freiburg im Breisgau. It is the middle panel of a triptych, the wings of which are in the bishop's palace in the Herrenstrasse. Bossert has shown that the so-called Hausbuchmeister is the author of only three pictures in the Hausbuch. Most of the others are by. Heinrich Lang (about 1420-85), several by an inferior artist whom Bossert called the Saturnus-meister. The so-called Hausbuchmeister was a pupil of Lang. He belonged to the school of the Middle Rhine. The Crucifixion at Freiburg is distinguished for its fine coloring and its realism, but a drawing of the same subject in the Cabi- net des Estampes at Paris by the same artist is nobler in its conception. Why should not the name "Master of the Crucifixion " be substituted for the incorrect designation "Hausbuchmneister"? Albrecht Altdorfer.--L. RiAU contributes to Gaz. B.-A., IV, 1911, pp. 113-135, an article in which he reviews the oeuvre of Albrecht Altdorfer. He finds that he is primarily a miniaturist, a colorist, and a landscape artist. His artistic origins are to be traced in Bavaria and in the Donaustil. His prepossessions in favor of miniature account for the excess of detail in his large compositions, like the Battle of Arbela in Munich, and the Susanna, also in the Munich gallery. The same excess of detail is seen in his use of Renaissance architectural motifs. On the other hand, he is a pioneer in landscape, being the first of the German painters to paint a landscape without figures (in the Munich Gallery) and the first to intro- duce atmosphere into his pictures.</page><page sequence="61">AMERICAN ARCH.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1911 593 The Portrait of Diirer's Father.- H. OCHENKOWSKI sees in the "Por- trait of a Goldsmith," in the Albertina at Vienna a portrait of Albrecht Diirer the elder, but rejects Friedliinder's attribution of the portrait to Diirer the younger. According to Ochenkowski, Diirer's father was the author of his own portrait, which afterward was used as a model by his son for his "autoportrait" of the year 1484, also in the Albertina (Rep.f. K. XXXIV, 1911, pp. 1-10). The Master of Rabenden.- P. M. HALM in Jb. Preuss. Kunsts. XXXII, 1911, pp. 59-84, reconstructs the oeuvre and the influence of the Master of Rabenden of th8 early sixteenth century, who derives his name from his best-known work, the high altar of the church at Rabenden. The writer assigns a number of works to him, notably a wooden Gethsemane, with four figures, in the Kaiser-Friedrich Museum at Berlin. His influence is widespread in the Chiemrgau, and can be traced in Tirol. His name and homrne are still unknown. GREAT BRITAIN Military Effigies in Lincolnshire. - In Ann. Arch. Anthr. III, 1910, pp. 73-85 (pl.), F. P. BARNARI) discusses the two fourteenth century mili- tary effigies at Maltby and Belleau in Lincolnshire. The figure at Maltby is much the better preserved and is interesting for the azlettes on the shoulders. AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS The Indigenous Manuscripts of Mexico.- In R. Arch. XVII, 1911, pp. 99-129 (52 figs.), HENRI BEUCHAT classifies the native Mexican manu- scripts, mentioning where the chief specimens now are, and discusses the Mexican system of writing. The signs were pictographic, ideographic, and syllabic, or phonetic. There are also calendar signs and numerical signs. The combination of the different systems mentioned makes the manuscripts exceedingly difficult to read, but much progress has been made. A Nahuatl-Spanish Manuscript. - In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1911, pp. 154- 159, Dr. CAPITAN describes an important Mexican manuscript hitherto un- published. It was written in 1534 on native paper, and is 75 cm. by 23 cm. in size. On one side a vertical line in the middle divides it into two parts, each of which is fille'd with hieroglyphic writing. On the reverse is a Span- ish translation and explanation of the native text in forty-one lines, written in a sixteenth-century hand which in places has not been deciphered. It appears that the natives of Totolapan and Atlatlo, suffering from the exac- tions of a certain Martin de Berrio, had accused him before a court, and he, after confessing, was removed from his office. A text of such length, in which the native hieroglyphics are explained in Spanish, is exceedingly rare. The Remains at Quirigua.- In Rec. Past. X, 1911, pp. 59-76 (17 figs.), A. H. BLACKISTON gives a brief account of the Maya remains at Quirigua, Guatamrala, with reproductions from photographs of the principal mrnonu- mnents.</page></plain_text>
