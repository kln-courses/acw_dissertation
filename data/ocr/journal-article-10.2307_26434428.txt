<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ask Your Mama: Women in Langston Hughes' The Ways of White Folks by Susan Neal Mayberry Until the 1940s, images of black women in both Anglo- and Afro-American literature gen erally reflect stereotyped roles, appropriated to provide a context for certain of society's unresolved dilemmas. Barbara Christian traces the evolution of these black female stereo types in southern white literature and in African-American literature written primarily for a white audience and the oral tradition of slave narratives and worksongs aimed at a black audi ence. In her view, Anglo-American literature throughout the novels of the slavery and recon struction periods "fashioned an image of the black woman intended to further create submis sion, conflict between the black man and woman, and importantly, a dumping ground for those female functions a basically Puritan society could not confront" (2). The most prominent black female figure in southern white literature is Aunt Jemima or the mammy, designed as a direct contrast to the ideal white woman who would have to debase herself to be a mother.' Requiring little for herself, her identify derived, like Faulkner's Dilsey, from nurturing service, this figure satisfies the need for mother in the southern unconscious as well as a surrogate to contain the white wom an's fears of the physical aspects of being female. The two other dominant images of the black woman in southern white literature, the concubine and the conjure or evil woman, also provide a reservoir for fears—of sexuality and of the unknown spiritual world. African-American literature of the slavery and reconstruction periods focused on the tragic mulatta as the dominant black female image. As depicted in William Wells Brown's Clotel (1850) and Frances Harper's lola LeRoy (1892), the tragic mulatta theme calls up the illicit crossing between cultures as the offspring of the white slavemaster and the black slave woman becomes the vehicle for cultural transference. Reaching a peak in the women of Jean Toomer's Cane (1923), a work mainly involving physical, emotional, and cultural miscegenation, and in the novels of Nella Larsen, the stereo type assumes, as her tragedy, alienation from both black and white worlds. While the images of mammy and tragic mulatta persist in the representations of black people fashioned in narratives and songs—the oral tradition that coexisted with the African-American literature of the period—these genres offer the standard formu la with a twist. Continuing the white southern projection of mammy as cook and housekeeper, always caring for her people, the oral tradition denies her harmlessness and presents her as "cunning, prone to poisoning her master, and not at all content with her lot" (Christian 5). This mammy refutes any kind of debasement associated with motherhood and imbues the role with the dignity and responsibility that are car ryovers from the African image of mother as a symbol of the earth's creative forces. The tragic mulatta also appears in the slave narratives, but there is little romanticism in the accounts.2 Any advantages that the mulatta might have because of her ties with the master are easily offset by the abuse she suffers and the alienation and frustration she feels. Unlike the narratives which focus on the relationship between slave and mas 1 Sterling Brown describes the mammy figure and other black female stereotypes in The Negro in American Fiction, pp. 1-89. 2 Harriet Jacobs reflects this anti-romantic sentiment with the character of Linda Brent in her autobiographical slave narrative, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl (1861).

Examining the effects of hard times on love and marriage, the songs as well as the slave accounts reveal overburdened black women occasionally rising to the heights of hero ism but more often succumbing to the tedious requirements of pragmatism. Black female stereotypes, particularly of the tragic mulatta, find supreme expression in the Harlem Renaissance with works such as Toomer's Cane. However, this period can also be credited with providing a transition towards a more varied, complex view of the black woman as she appears in American literature, according to Christian, in the life and work of Zora Neale Hurston. Certainly Hurston's stories do move the image of the black female beyond stereotype through her examinations of the ever evolving ways of the folk and particularly with the character ofjanie in Their Eyes Were Watching God. However, there is another, surprisingly, male writer of this period whose fiction in general has been consistently undervalued and who, unlike so many of his colleagues, acts to dispel the stereotypes of black women—Langston Hughes.3 Black male writers of and subsequent to the Harlem Renaissance were not necessar ily bent on denigrating black women; rather it remained for the black woman herself to illuminate her situation as does occur in the work of authors such as Gwendolyn Brooks, Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, Paule Marshall and others. In practice, howev er, the images of black women introduced by Richard Wright, James Baldwin, Chester Himes, and Ralph Ellison, the dominant black novelists from 1945-60, "come painful ly close to the stereotypes about black women projected by white southern literature in the latter part of the nineteenth century" (Christian 15). Ironically, it is Hughes and Hurston who were under fire from these same black male writers, ostensibly for their provinciality and their lack of racial aggressiveness. While Wright criticized Hurston for her pacifism, Ellison believed that Hughes had "used his emotions and sensibility more than his intellect" and actually accused him of having "stopped thinking." Baldwin objected to his "fake simplicity," and declared himself "depressed" that Hughes had done so little with his genuine gifts (Lee 204). Male writers of the 1960s continued their disparagement of Hughes, with LeRoi Jones/Amiri Baraka pronouncing that he possessed an inadequate racial sense (Rampersad 2: 376).4 Even Nathan Huggins in his important work on the Harlem Renaissance recalls the debate among Harlem Renaissance intelligentsia over the use of the black vernacular, charging that Hughes backed out of the Negro-artist dilemma by taking an anti-intellectual approach to art; opting for a freedom of subject and a personal honesty, Hughes avoided "the Scylla of formalism only to founder in the Charybdis of folk art" (226-27). Huggins argues that nothing produced during the New Negro Renaissance can compare with the fruits of recent years when black writ 3 During his lifetime Hughes suffered not so much from a lack of success as from casual critical neglect, with main stream scholars relegating him to the realm of popular writer and thus by-passing any serious consideration of his art. While Hughes is mentioned in several commentaries on black achievement written by black authors at the height of his career, no discussion of his work can be found in such basic sources of the same period as Alfred Kazin, On Native Grounds (1942); Robert Spiller, et al., The Literary History of the United States (1948); Arthur Quinn, The Literature of the American People (1951). Not only have his poems and short fiction been excluded from college anthologies, evaluation of his writing continues to be hampered by lack of critical commentary in standard sources on recent American litera ture. R. Baxter Miller' observes that even the ablest scholars have ignored the secrets of [Hughes'] practice and theory" (6). In the words of poet Onwuchekwa Jemie, the American literary establishment has dismissed Hughes as "too sim ple, too quaintly humorous, unserious, unreflective, parochial, limited in scope, without a metaphysic, and without profundity" (187). 4 Despite his ultra-nationalist position which acknowledged a growing need to remove the wedges existing between black men and women and include women as central figures in literature, Baraka, along with Haki Madhubuti, creates his own stereotype of the black female. She becomes the idealized black woman or the woman exhorted to change her ways so as to deserve the idealized title. Black women in much of the 1960s socio-political poetry become "symbolic holders of the moral condition of blacks," in effect merely a reaction to the previously projected stereotypes (Christian 15-16).</page><page sequence="3">14 ' The Langpton Hughes Review ers have become "less provincial, more masterful of craft" (307).5 What these writers, together with most mainstream scholars, fail to recognize is that Hughes, like Hurston, set out to record and interpret black folk traditions, that his great achievement was to build popular literature into a significant art form. They also overlook his use of folk sources, again like Hurston, to forward the image of the black female beyond stereotype. As R. Baxter Miller points out, Hughes "sensed in the folk source of woman . . . the dynamic will to epic heroism in both the physical and spiri tual dimensions" and restored "complex humanity to Black woman in particular and woman in general" (33). Miller goes so far as to assert that even "the most rabid fem inist critics" must admit that Hughes' projections of women "radiate (whatever the almost inevitable limitations of Man) a profound sympathy and nearly unquestionable love." In essence, Hughes transformed folk sources such as his grandmother's stories into images of the black woman "more human than almost any other female figure inscribed by a Black male writer in either [his] time or our own" (46). Miller's suggestions about Hughes' myth of the black female are focused mainly on the figure as she appears in his poetry. However, the same can be said about the women in his fiction, even in the earliest of his collections of short stories, The Ways of White Folks (1934).6 Not always without stereotype, Hughes' stories predict the work of Paule Marshall as they depict black women who seem at first to be familiar types—the mammy, the tragic mulatta, the concubine, the sex kitten—only to examine their per sonalities so thoroughly that, given the limitations of the short story form, the stereo type is shattered within the mind of the reader. Hughes is able to revise type by indi vidualizing the women in his stories—emphasizing character over plot—by violating expectations or substituting growth of character for familiarity. In doing so, he not only rejects stereotypes about black women; he calls attention to the socio-cultural forces that give rise to the types. The stories in The Ways of White Folks that most closely adhere to existing stereotypes about black women are "Home," "Passing," and, to some extent, "Red-Headed Baby." Both "Home" and "Passing" outline the nurturing mammy, enduring hardship with out complaint for the good of her own. However, each piece takes as its focus a young man's dubious success story, in "Home" a physically and emotionally ailing musician who has played the great halls of Europe but who is lynched when he forgets his place at home and in "Passing" a son who elects to pass his own mother on the street in order to continue passing as white, surrendering his manhood in order to avoid being called "boy." Their accomplishments as artist and converted white man are made pos sible by sacrifices from mammies who remain in the background. "Home" presents a mother figure reminiscent of the religious images of Hughes' ear lier poetry, black women shrouded in Christian myth confronting secular reality. She is also prescient of the ideal moral icon of the 1960s socio-political poetry. Combining folk experience with Christian myth, Roy's mother is, for him, idealized "home," cen tered around her kitchen and her church. But all of her provisions of physical and 5 While more recent scholars such as David Levering Lewis and Houston A. Baker disagree with Huggins when he cites provinciality and narrowness as causes for a failed Harlem Renaissance, neither focuses on a serious reassessment of Hughes' work. 6 The secrets of Hughes' short fiction have been misunderstood, if not overlooked, by critics. In his pioneering study, James Emanuel compares Hughes' unanalyzed powers as a short story writer with his known techniques as a poet and assesses the published observations of the stories as "generally mediocre, sometimes observant, and here and there briefly penetrating" (55,172). Donald Dickinson notes in his 1972 bio-bibliography that, aside from Emanuel's unpub lished dissertation on the short stories and several brief articles in Phylon, no scholarly studies are available in English (4-5). While Hans Ostrom's Langston Hughes: A Study of the Short Fiction (1993) is a positive step in the direction of reeval uating Hughes' stories, I have located only two articles on The Ways of White Folks in the MLA Bibliography since 1963, not including my forthcoming essay, "Out of the Mouths of Babes: Children and Narrative Voice in Hughes' The Ways of White Folks."</page><page sequence="4">Ask Your Mama: Women in Langston Hughes' The Ways of White Folks • 15 spiritual food, her pride in him, her giving over of self and room cannot save Roy from the reality that his home includes white kids who care more for bigotry than art. "Passing" combines the mammy with the tragic mulatta, describing a woman who gives up her son by encouraging him to "make use of [his] light skin and good hair" to get a job where he gets "$65 a week in spite of the depression" (52). From the per spective of a letter from the son to the mother whose strength of character is oblique ly deciphered through her shallow offspring's apologies, "Passing" illustrates the pain of miscegenation as the mulatta unwittingly passes her tragic alienation onto her child. While the main character of "Home" is a black male and "Passing" involves a black male passing for white, "Red-Headed Baby" reveals in the form of a poetic internal monologue the conflict of a poor white sailor, successfully fusing, like Toomer's Cane, fiction and poetry. Also like Cane, "Red-Headed Baby" focuses on the dilemma of the tragic mulatta. Clarence's claustrophobic, futile life is suggested by a choppy narrative style, his perception of his physical world reflecting his own stagnation. His repressed yearning for beauty and fulfillment that he unwillingly identifies with a former black lover are revealed, however, in passages of lush poetic monologue. Betsy, the young "yellow gal" who "played like a kid" three years earlier, epitomizes the tragedy of a mat ing between the white male and the black female (126). Her white father's ambivalent feelings about her mother and her own birth can be inferred from Clarence's attrac tion to yet disdain of black women. His need for her battles an almost puritanical obsession with the possibility of her corruption, although he refuses to acknowledge that he initiated the circumstances of that corruption. Having "christened" a seven teen-year-old virgin and her mother, turning poor blacks scared of a white man in the house into hardened flesh traders, Clarence is disturbed that Betsy now flirts and drinks, that there have been other "mulefs] in [his] stall (127). He denies both his need to reestablish a relationship with something innocent and any responsibility for hav ing coarsened that innocence. Betsy not only suffers from the ambivalence of the white male's feelings about the black female; she extends the chain with the birth of her own "damn runt of a .. . red headed blue-eyed yellow-skinned baby" who is rejected by his red-haired father (130). Unable to acknowledge that he has produced a son by a black woman, Clarence reduces the child to a "stupid-faced," "bow-legged" doll created to be knocked down at a county fair and continues the violence of the image in a threat to "knock the [little bastard's] block off' when baby Clarence crawls towards him (131). If Clarence were to recognize the child as his own, he would also be forced to recognize Betsy as human, not just another "yellow jane" to be used for his pleasure and then tossed aside. Given the opportunity to exchange sterility for creation, futility for purpose, Clarence cannot overcome his fear of miscegenation. The story ends with his complete denial of his son and his other self, symbolized by his need to prostitute the experience by paying for his drinks. Rejected by the white world and alienated from the black by an absent white father and a biracial son, Betsy is the stereotypical tragic mulatta. However, Hughes provides small touches in "Red-Headed Baby" which mark her as an individual, a technique that will be developed more fully in the other stories from The Ways of White Folks. We glimpse her awareness of the frustrating injustice of her situation as she stumbles over the proper use of Clarence's name, signaling the equality of their status as lovers when she impulsively greets him as "Clären-" but, bowing to his superiority as a white man, quickly altering her reference to "Mister Clarence" (128). Continuing to emphasize the incompatibility of love and inequality through the comic exchanges of names upon the entrance of baby Clarence, Hughes permits Betsy to assert herself further by con</page><page sequence="5">16 • The Längsten Hughes Review tradicting her mother's command that the child return to bed. Her quiet "let him stay" and a subsequent observation that her child may be deaf and dumb but he "ain't blind" serve as a challenge to Clarence, Sr. that he accept his son as unrelenting as the child's own stare (130). Betsy's independence and small concessions to bitterness con trast with her mother's formulaic conciliatory attitude and enrich the figure of the tragic mulatta. Despite her complexities, Betsy's situation, like those of the mammies in "Home" and "Passing," generally remains true to type, in part because she, like the others, is a minor figure in a genre whose form tolerates full development of only one or two char acters. However, in the remaining stories from The Ways of White Folks, Hughes man ages to create significantly rounded black women, either as minor figures or as main characters in their own right. He does so by presenting familiar types only to investi gate their personalities thoroughly enough to dispel any notion of familiarity. Arcie of "One Christmas Eve," Cora of "Cora Unashamed," and Cora of "Father and Son" define the tragedy and/or heroism of the black mammy as well as come to life as individuals. Drawing on his folk sources to emphasize their disciplined application to labor or the direct act of social defiance, Hughes combines myth with pragmatism in these figures. Opening with the laughter and excitement of a white woman and her children returning home late to dinner after last-minute Christmas shopping, "One Christmas Eve" focuses on their maid, Arcie, whose limited plans for her own son's Christmas are jeopardized by the inconsiderate tardiness of her employer as well as her promised payment. Ever the stalwart servant but also requiring her paycheck, Arcie waits for the family to eat, washes the dishes, takes less than the sum of money she is promised, and rushes into the snow with inadequate shoes to collect little Joe at their rooming house and take him downtown to see the Christmas decorations and pur chase a few small gifts. Left outside the store while his mother shops, Joe wanders back to a movie theater for whites only. At this point in the story, the voice shifts to that of the child struck with wonder at the presence of Santa Claus giving away gifts to the white children in the lobby of the theater. So overcome that he rushes right up to the man, Joe is fright ened when Santa, amused by the pickaninny, shakes a rattle fiercely in his face and laughs with the rest of the crowd at his startled reaction. Exposing white hypocrisy, through the behavior of its secular symbol of Christmas, Hughes portrays the isolation of the poor black child from the privileges associated with the holiday typifying Christian love and hope as the birth of a child, presenting Joe as surrounded, like Bigger Thomas, with "too many people, all white people, mov ing like white shadows in the snow, a world of white people" (206). He also uses Arcie to satirize Santa Claus as the sanctimonious figure of the northern philanthropist. Several poems in Ask Your Mama identify Santa Claus as a liberal benefactor to blacks as well as whites, a nice fellow—except that he has no gifts for the children of the wel fare poor. Welcoming only a token participation which allows blacks no real share of the power, Santa offers no protection at all from the harshness of ghetto life.7 In "One Christmas Eve," little Joe is not to be in the white folks' movie, and he receives his first instruction in such racial discrimination from Santa Claus. When the tearful child complains to his mother that he "seed Santa Claus in [the moving picture show]" but "Santa Claus didn't give [him] nothin'," Arcie replies "Huh! That wasn't no Santa Claus .... If it was, he wouldn't a-treated you like that. That's a theatre for white folks—I told you once—and he's just a old white man" (206). Arcie cuts through the illusions of any genuine benevolence to be gained for poor black children from the 7 See "Ode to Dinah" (28) and "Ride, Red, Ride" (14-15) from Ask Your Mama.</page><page sequence="6">Ask Your Mama: Women in Langston Hughes' The Ways of White Folks • 77 white Santa Claus and gives her son the practical gift of negotiating such discrimina tion while appreciating real generosity. This woman puts her own stamp on the mam my's nurturing role with her pragmatic political lessons. Hughes begins his characterization of Cora in "Cora Unashamed" by returning to the image of the nurturing mammy as she appears in the slave narratives and work songs, elevating her position by investing her with the properties of the earth. In addi tion to singlehandedly supporting her drunken father and her quarrelsome, chroni cally pregnant mother not to mention her seven "bratty" brothers and sisters, made mean from hunger, Cora is treated "like a dog" by her white employers, the Studevants. As Hughes puts it, "there was something about the teeth in the trap of economic cir cumstance that kept her in their power practically all her life ..." (3-4). To insure that readers not stereotype the situation, attributing Cora's economic quagmire to Southern racism, Hughes sets the story in a small, rural Iowa town in America's heart land. He also isolates Cora from other black people; the Jenkins family are, in the words of the townspeople, the "only Negroes in Melton, thank God!" (4). Described repeatedly as "humble," "gentle," and "inoffensive," Cora is submissive under white domination in all instances but one. Instinctively valuing life, she cries out or, rather, "cusses" against its violation. Throughout the story, Cora is associated with images of nature while the white townsfolk, particularly the women, sublimate the natural in favor of the social. She "was like a tree—once rooted, she stood, in spite of storms and strife, wind, and rocks, in the earth" (4). She refers to the single event giving meaning to a life of plodding self-denial as her "Spring," a time when she took a lover, her first and the only man she "ever remembered wanting" (6). Her memories of that mating are associated with meadows, orchards, sweet fields, velvet skies, katydids, crickets, and lightening bugs, and with the earthy scent of her yellow-haired, grey-eyed Joe, smelling like the horses he takes care of. Cora pays little attention to white folks' rules about miscegenation or about illegitimate, biracial children. She never expects to marry or even keep Joe upon the birth of her grey-eyed daughter, yet she does not attempt to hide her preg nancy, viewing it as no disgrace even when public reaction, both white and black, is one of outrage. Cora embraces the naturalness of the act, naming the child Josephine after the father who is driven from town and cherishing the child as "hers—a living bridge between two worlds" (7). Hughes individualizes Cora with such unexpected acts of social defiance and con trasts her rejection of form with the unnatural conformity of the white folks by creat ing a number of repetitions in the story and presenting Cora's situation in the context of seasonal cycles. Mrs. Art Studevant gives birth to a baby the same age as Josephine but, though turning her over to Cora to wet-nurse, does not allow Cora to bring her own little girl to play with Jessie, ostensibly because Cora "could get her work done bet ter if she left her child at home" (8). When Josephine dies of whooping cough, Cora takes the white child as her own. Though venting her rage at God for the death of her child in a stream of curses so violent that the grave-tenders at Josephine's funeral react in "startled horror," Cora is "gentle and humble in the face of life—she loved [the Studevants'] baby" (8-9). Having adopted "in her heart" the child that the Studevants reject as plump, dull, and strange, Cora stands as a "calm and sheltering tree" for Jessie who "blooms" only in the kitchen where she laughs, learns to cook wonderfully, and is sometimes even witty. The final repetition occurs with Cora's response to Jessie's own "Spring" when the girl, afraid to tell her mother she is pregnant, turns to the woman with whom every thing "seemed so simple" (10). Here the technique Hughes employs to contrast the black woman's naturalness with the unnatural behavior of the Studevant females is</page><page sequence="7">18 • The Langston Hughes Review their mode of expression. Hughes uses a third person narrator in the story to offer us insight into the various characters; Cora herself says very little. Her answer to the Studevants' incessant talking, mostly in the form of demands, is "Yes, ma'am." Her answer to the public outcry when she was pregnant with Josephine was "Let people talk" (7). Most of Cora's communication is indirect and is done to find ways to break the news of Jessie's various academic and social failures to her parents. The only direct statements made by Cora occur when she is moved by great feeling to announce life or protest death. Thus, although she is skilled at subtly communicating failures to the Studevants, she "marched into Mrs. Art's sun-porch and announced quite simply, 'Jessie's going to have a baby"' (11). Cora does not view the birth of a child as a fail ure. While Cora speaks only when she is expressing natural feeling, the Studevants are restricted by social convention from voicing real emotion. They talk but reveal noth ing. When the situation involves anything natural such as sex, birth, or death, they are incapable of speaking. The shock which follows Cora's announcement of Jessie's preg nancy can only be expressed non-verbally; Mrs. Art falls into "uncontrollable hysterics" while Old Lady Studevant's reaction can be perceived through her wheel-chair, which "rol[s] up, doddering and shaking with excitement" (12). Cora is immediately silenced to prevent her from speaking that which the Studevants feel is unspeakable: "No trouble having a baby you want. I had one" "Shut up, Cora!" "Yes, ma'am. .. . But I had one." "Hush, I tell you." "Yes, ma'am." (12) Clearly at least the female Studevants view Jessie's unborn child, not to mention its Greek immigrant father, as unsuitable beyond expression to their status as civic lead ers and church pillars. They cannot conceive of what they will not name. Left to their devices, the women arrange for Jessie to have an abortion under cover of a shopping trip to Kansas City. Forced to "talk a lot" to explain Jessie's thinness and pallor upon their return, Mrs. Art Studevant also starts a campaign to rid the town of unsavory tradespeople such as Greek ice-cream makers. In the midst of this "clean up," refusing to eat and grieving for her aborted baby, Jessie dies. Biting her lips to keep from cursing while Jessie pines, Cora will not be silenced at the girl's funeral. While "Mrs. Art fell back in her chair, stiff as a board," "Cousin Nora and sister Mary sat like stones," and the menfolk scrambled to shut her up, Cora screams: "They preaches you a pretty sermon and they don't say nothin'. They sings you a song, and they don't say nothin'. But Cora's here honey, and she's gone tell 'em what they done to you They killed you and your child. I told 'em you loved it, but they didn't care" (16-17). Cora knows full well the cost of her testimony to Jessie's memory, complet ing her sacrifice to truth as she rejects "ha[ving] to stand" the Studevants for a "little garden" and "somehow managing] to get along" (3, 18). Hughes renders the black mammy a sympathetic individual with this woman's range of emotion and declaration of independence. While this Cora's act of social defiance is single and ultimately contained, the black revolution that Hughes embraces through the Cora of the final story is collective and contagious. "Cora Unashamed" portrays a black woman's endurance of and resistance to a stifling economic and social system. "Father and Son" reintroduces the strong, nurturing black mammy whose child will be sacrificed to the white system, but this woman also functions as a symbol in a thinly veiled political allegory. Hughes' pre sentation of the generically-named "Big House Plantation" and its inhabitants allows them to function as historical archetypes, models of America's racial past and present.</page><page sequence="8">Ask Your Mama: Women in Lanpton Hughes' The Ways of White Folks • 19 The text of "Father and Son" revolves around the homecoming of Bert, the twenty year-old son of Colonel Tom Norwood, a white plantation owner, and Coralee Lewis, his black housekeeper. The conflict arises when Bert expects to be treated like the well educated man he is and refuses to be a "white folks' nigger" (221). Bert's pride and his father's obstinacy lead to patricide, Cora's mental breakdown, Bert's suicide, and the lynching of both Bert's dead body and the live body of his brother Willie—the perfect "white folks' nigger." Hughes uses plantation mythology in the story to construct an allegorical subtext as valid in 1930 as 1830, suggesting that the position of black Americans did not change significantly with Emancipation. This subtext allies the white world with the patriarch whose control is reflected in the hierarchy of Big House Plantation. Colonel Tom is the type of the white slaveowner, oppressor, and defender of the status quo. The black world is identified with the plantation concubine, mother to generations of African-Americans, whose strength is derived from her abilities to nurture and sustain but is ultimately contained by the white male. Although Cora is technically not a slave, she has been Colonel Tom's mistress for thirty years, and her economic dependence upon him makes him her master. Caught between the two worlds, the black male is rendered impotent, without the nurturing power of the black female nor the political and economic authority of the white male. Hughes offers us the two options open to such men. Willie chooses to remain a "white folks' nigger," and Bert speaks for revo lution. Illustrating the union of the white Everyman and the black Everywoman, "Father and Son" presents their offspring as patronized but denied patrimony and miscegena tion as an inevitable product of American history. Hughes not only sets Cora in the role of black Mother; he depicts her as a variation on the concubine theme. The his tory of her liaison with Colonel Tom is typical of black/white miscegenation. Begun without love, at least on Tom's part, the young Colonel has known Cora all his life as part of the black fabric of the plantation. Busy during the early part of his married years, he takes her presence for granted until, overcome by the death of his father and the chronic illness of his childless young bride, he turns to her as an escape from his troubles. Acknowledging the powerlessness accompanying the slave mistress's role as reser voir for white fears of the physical female, Hughes, nevertheless, is able to individual ize Cora's life. Overcoming many of the concubine's usual frustrations, she goes to live alone with Tom in the Big House upon the death of his wife, supervises his life, bears him all of his children, loves him, and receives something "very like love" from him in return (213). She is able to negotiate, successfully for a time, the land mines effected by black/white miscegenation, keeping his "yard" children out of their father's house yet securing an education for them, satisfying the mores of the white world while maintaining her ties with the black. But however positive her own assimilation, Cora understands the precariousness of balancing on someone else's tightrope. Her own hands burn with her premonition that Colonel Tom's rejection of Bert's hand will someday lead to black men shaking hands with white men like "steel meeting steel" (229). She knows that her life, like the others at Big House Plantation, will be irrevo cably altered by Bert's revolutionary ideas. The conflict within Cora between her loyalty to "the man she had known so long" and her love for the son who is so much like his father finally leads to madness (246). Her epic proportions increasing with her disorientation, Cora identifies the dead Colonel Tom with the white mob running their boy, denies him her bed, and damns him as she lays her most beautiful quilts on that bed for Bert to rest upon. Singly and silently holding off the mob until she hears Bert's shot, Cora is at once "a little brown</page><page sequence="9">20 • The Langston Hughes Review woman" and a symbol in Hughes' ominous allegory of revolution (253). Black moth ers will desert the white father to support their sons' fight for independence, even if it means they must make a place for them to die. And when the white father refuses to acknowledge his black sons, he, too, will die and will leave no legacy. Drawing his Coras from the physical and spiritual examples of epic heroism in the black women of his folk sources, Hughes turns to the folk trickery that allows comic wit to circumvent defeat in the women of "Slave on the Block," "A Good Job Gone," and "Rejuvenation Through Joy." Again, he relies on familiar types, this time the mammy and the sex kitten, only to reinvent them in a comic as opposed to heroic vein. A variation on the black mammy appearing in African-American literature of the reconstruction period, Mattie of "Slave on the Block" is fat, cunning, belligerent, and humorously successful in her efforts to thwart the bondage of the concrete plantation. Telling her employers she is afraid to stay alone at night while they are out, Mattie frequents the best and cheapest hot spots in 1920s Harlem yet maintains the passive image required by Anne and Michael Carroway's obsession with the cult of the Negro. Hughes uses the forty-something Mattie and her young black lover, Luther, as comic foils to the naivete that these trendy, would-be artists expect from blacks. Anne's patronizing assessment of them as "Dear, natural, childlike people" while she stares at Luther's naked torso is juxtaposed with Mattie's blunt invitation to party: "Come on, let's go. Working for white folks all day, I'm tired. They needn't think I was made to answer telephones all night" (24). Although Anne and Michael "treated them nice and paid them well," Mattie describes the Carroways as "too strange ... they makes me ner vous" and observes, "I does my work .... After that I don't want to be painted, or asked to sing songs, nor nothing like that (25-26). The more they are touted as sim ple primitives, the more sophisticated become their abuses of their employers, culmi nating in Mattie's sleeping openly with Luther in the Carroways' basement, expressing resentment at Anne and David's nosiness, and subjecting the household to mood swings brought on by lovers' quarrels. She resumes her competence as cook and housekeeper only when Michael's domineering mother arrives, respecting Mrs. Carroway's open bigotry above her son's covert prejudices. Even this bubble bursts, however, when Luther calls the old woman "poor white folks," and Mattie stands by her man, booming "We've stood enough foolery from you white folks!" (29-30). Mattie comically individualizes the image of the black mammy, refusing to tolerate the "vagaries" of white folks, as she exposes the Carroways' silliness and hypocrisy. "Rejuvenation Through Joy" also pokes fun at the condescension of spiritually impoverished whites who marvel at the so-called primitivism of black people. In this story Hughes relies on the prostitute or sex kitten image of black women to establish the allure that the wealthy white patrons of the "Colony of Joy" find in blues singer, Miss Tulane Lucas; however, he individualizes her with a comic spunk that breaks type and circumvents defeat. Satirizing the hypocrisy of repressed whites who couch sexu ality in a veneer of pseudointellectualism, Hughes uses Miss Lucas to cut through the hype. Responding to the Colony director's requests for moaning jazz and "plenty hip movement" to accompany his high-minded lectures on the deepest sources of life, Miss Lucas mutters, "Lawd... what is this, a dancing school or a Sunday school?" (87). And when her boyfriend, the band's little drummer, indulges his unfortunate habit of see ing other women, Miss Tulane Lucas provides the rich white colonists with a lesson in the primitive they fight each other to emulate, firing a pistol straight at the life center of the one she loves. Narrated by a black student with middle-class aspirations who plays "boy" to a rich white man in exchange for his dental school tuition, "A Good Job Gone" revises the sex kitten theme when the white male becomes "dazed . . . for life" as a result of his rela</page><page sequence="10">Ask Your Mama: Women in Langston Hughes' The Ways of White Folks • 21 tionship with Pauline, a beautiful "golden brown" (66). Because Pauline "hadn't worked in Harlem speakeasies for nothing," is as smooth as "gin and vermouth mixed," and "had a hot line . . . without seemin' serious," Mr. Lloyd "fell for it" (61). Pauline's real loyalties, however, are reserved for black men as she establishes an easy friendship with the narrator and informs her boyfriend "she'd hooked a new butter and egg man with bucks" (62). Hughes' sex kitten knows her business, keeping the old man laughing until dawn and informing the narrator: "you've got to kid white folks along .... When you're depending on 'em for a living, make 'em think you like it" (62). The jig is up when Mr. Lloyd spots his mistress on the town with her black lover and becomes enraged with jealousy. At this point Hughes abandons the sex kitten image and endows Pauline with a feisty integrity. Besting Mr. Lloyd in a physical skir mish, Pauline kicks the old man away as he grovels at her feet, smashes him over the head with a whiskey bottle, and throws all of his gifts at his prone body. Calling him a "white bastard," she makes her exit with the comment: "Just because they pay you, they always think they own you. No white man's gonna own me. I laugh with 'em and they think I like 'em. Hell, I'm from Arkansas where the crackers lynch niggers in the streets. How could I like 'em?" (65). The frustration in this story is reserved for the white lover instead of the black mistress. When Mr. Lloyd's frantic efforts to find Pauline fail, he turns to drink, won't eat, can't work, and finally makes love to a door. The story ends with Pauline travelling the country with her boyfriend and the old man in a padded cell, thinking he is a lion or a stud-horse chasing a mare. Hughes is not only successful at restoring complex humanity to images of black women in his stories; he is careful to present white women as individuals rather than as stereotyped products of their race. From different social classes, Mrs. Osborn of "Berry" and Mrs. Pemberton of "Poor Little Black Fellow" conceal an unfulfilled need for love beneath a condescending do-gooder attitude. The supervisor of Dr. Renfield's Summer Home for Crippled Children, a camp that exploits white, lower middle-class youngsters, Mrs. Osborn exhibits a "grand manner" with the white help, a bigoted exploitation of the black, and a careless neglect of the children. However, her unsatis fied yearning for the attentions of Dr. Renfield humanizes her villainy. Mrs. Pemberton's dehumanization of young Arnie in "Poor Little Black Fellow" is portrayed as unintentional on her part, an offering of Christian charity that becomes pernicious in its kindness. While her husband's response to their ward's rejection of their patron age is to find him an ungrateful "nigger," Mrs. Pemberton is moved to tears that she has never cried "over anything Mr. Pemberton did" (158). Like "Poor Little Black Fellow," most of Hughes' stories present at least one sym pathetic white character, frequently a woman. In "Mother and Child" he goes even fur ther to satirize a group of black women who are every bit as narrow and self-righteous as their white, middle-class counterparts in "Poor Little Black Fellow." In "Little Dog," sympathies are focused completely on the thoughts and actions of Miss Clara Briggs, an introverted white bookkeeper who fantasizes about the black janitor supplying meat for her little dog. Hiding her fears of intimacy and involvement behind a mask of efficiency, Miss Briggs creates a regimented, self-contained world composed of an invalid mother, a job as head bookkeeper, and the occasional Women's Civics Club meeting or lecture on Theosophy. Her only experience with men the "flat-footed old Negro gentlemen" who fuss over her nightly dinners at the Rose Bud Tea Shoppe, she is left without even female contact when her mother dies. Miss Briggs prides herself on "keeping her dis tance" from the movement and color that surround her park-front apartment and on proving right her mother's comment that "Men'll have a hard time getting Clara" (165). Denying that she ever felt lonely, at least "not very lonely," Miss Briggs nonethe</page><page sequence="11">22 • The Längsten Hughes Review less spends more money than she intends to buy a little dog she spots in a pet shop window. The impulse to share her life, albeit with something small and safe, leads Miss Briggs into a relationship with the big and, for her, not-so-safe black janitor whom she contracts to bring meat for her dog. As with her Negro waiters, she initially responds to the kindness of the man with the house full of children. However, Miss Briggs soon finds herself listening for his "rich voice" and the appearance of his "beautifully heavy body" upon her back porch steps (168, 172). While she is overwhelmed by the black man's sexuality, none too subtly couched in the Tennessee Williamson image of the meat delivery, Miss Briggs makes every possible attempt to conceal the truth from her self. Her resistance to feelings she cannot control is so great that she literally closes the door in Joe's face when he brings the meat, refusing to allow him to see her blush ing face. However, she keeps "looking at the big kind face of the janitor in her mind, perturbed that it was a Negro face, and that it stayed with her so" (171). As with "Red-Headed Baby," Hughes introduces in "Little Dog" a minor character who provides the reader with insight into the epiphany of the main character. In this case, it is not the accusing stare of Clarence's son that leads to recognition but the anthropomorphic barks of Clara's dog. Prior to Miss Briggs' introduction to Joe, her dog Flips is not particularly expressive. But by the time the two exchange their first few sentences, "Flips had already begun to jump upon [Joe] with friendly mien" (168). In addition, the occasional pitch-hitting of Joe's wife during the nightly meat deliver ies causes Flips to "bark ... rudely at her," something that Miss Briggs would obviously like the freedom to do (170). Miss Briggs' projection of emotion onto Flips becomes undeniably clear on the night of Joe's last delivery. Trembling so that she cannot come to the door to take the meat when he knocks, she manages to call to him to leave it by the sink. When Flips jumps up on her for his food, she says, "'Oh, Flips . . . I'm so hungry.' She meant to say ' You're so hungry.' So she repeated it. 'You're so hungry! Heh, Flipsy, dog?"' (172). Though hungry for the companionship and love she associ ates with the dog's eagerness for his dinner, Miss Briggs ultimately denies any possi bility for change. She will limit the hunger to where she thinks it belongs, to an ani mal, and begins immediately to make plans to move to a different apartment, uproot ing her entire life to avoid confronting her sexual attraction to a black man. Eliciting our understanding of, as well as arousing our impatience with the repression of the ideal white woman typical of southern white literature, Hughes is able to render Miss Briggs every bit as human as the black women in his stories. In "The Blues I'm Playing," Hughes offers fully developed portraits of two women: wealthy, white Mrs. Dora Ellsworth and her young, black protegee, Oceola Jones. He also prefigures Toni Morrison's Tar Baby and Paule Marshall's "Selina" in his criticism of the hypocrisy of white patronage. Widowed and left childless by a husband who never perceived the significance of his wife's passion for French lore and language, Mrs. Ellsworth indulges her romantic nature only through her participation in the lives of the various young artists she supports. Rationalizing her voyeurism by telling herself that it gives her pleasure to "share her richness with beauty," she actually shows little aptitude for recognizing artistic ability, dismissing a talented soprano as sallow and smelling of garlic and touting "charming young people who wrote terrible poems" and blue-eyed cat-painters (99-100). While Mrs. Ellsworth is not mistaken in her assessment of Oceola Jones as a gifted pianist, her real interest lies with the young woman herself—with the "electric strength" of her "hard young body" and the fascination of her black skin and heritage. Concealing sexual feelings beneath a motherly tenderness, she has become adroit at confusing art with life, the beauty of creation with the attractiveness of its creators.</page><page sequence="12">Ask Your Mama: Women in Langston Hughes' The Ways of White Folks • 23 Mrs. Ellsworth represses emotion, intellectualizes living, prefers the distance of the stars, and proclaims as art the "sublimation of the soul" (112). Hughes underscores her proclivity for vicarious living as she seeks to comprehend Oceola's life by purchas ing fashionable books from Brentano's such as Carl Van Vechten's Nigger Heaven. Ironically, what attracts her most about Oceola is the young woman's direct response to life. For Oceola, art is an immediate expression of living, is primitive soul instead of its sublimation. She is suspicious of anyone, including Mrs. Ellsworth, who would give her things simply for art's sake. When she is persuaded to accept the wom an's offer to study piano in Paris with the famous Philippe, Oceola becomes impatient with the interminable arguments of the students in the West Bank. Always earthy and practical, remembering her own childhood hunger, she can only understand the Marxists who, at least, want people to have enough to eat. She finds, in fact, that she "hated most artists . . . and the word art in French or English. If you wanted to play the piano or paint pictures or write books, go ahead! But why talk so much about it?" (112-113). For Oceola, talk is cheap, particularly the sophisticated intellectualizing of the "cultured Negroes" who proposed that art would break down color lines. Her response: "'Bunk!'... My ma and pa were both artists when it came to making music, and the white folks ran them out of town for being dressed up in Alabama" (113). Hughes is most telling when he manipulates their perception of symbols to contrast Mrs. Ellsworth's view of art as the sublimation of the soul with Oceola's definition of music, which "demanded movement and expression, dancing and living to go with if" (114). In effect, the voyeur prefers abstractions which allow her to substitute art for life while the artist translates living into art. While Mrs. Ellsworth wears black gowns with trailing scarves and resides with brass-buttoned servants in a grey stone house filled with delicate Persian vases and a grand piano, Oceola lives with her lover, Pete, in a four-room Harlem apartment containing barely enough room for an upright piano. She chooses a cotton dress for her wedding because she hates expensive things like silk, and she cooks pigs' feet for Mrs. Ellsworth in the Paris apartment, claiming that "There's nothing quite so good as a pig's foot. . . after playing all day" (115). It is their use of language, however, that most graphically illustrates their divergent atti tudes toward life. When Mrs. Ellsworth blames Pete's influence on her protegee for the lukewarm reviews Oceola receives about her Town Hall concert, Oceola responds that Pete was in Atlanta 'His spirit was here,' Mrs. Ellsworth insisted. 'All the time you were playing on that stage, he was here, the monster! Taking you out of yourself, taking you away from the piano.' 'Why, he wasn't,' said Oceola. * He was watching an operation in Atlanta' While Mrs. Ellsworth speaks with the abstractness of the philosopher, Oceola replies with the concreteness of the poet. The only times they are really able to communicate occur when Oceola listens to Mrs. Ellsworth's stories of the romantic history of France or accompanies her on the piano when she sings simple little French songs. Here Oceola can relate to and support the white woman's direct conversion of her passion into art. Oceola Jones is a composite of the various folk images of black women that Hughes typically individualizes. She possesses the strength and nurturing of the black moth er figure along with her heroic capacity for defying social bondage. She is "still Madam as much as Madonna" (Miller 46 ), revealing the practicality and cleverness of the pros titute or sex kitten. Oceola's sexuality, however, is not sold to the white male but flour ishes in a reciprocal relationship with a black man. Here Hughes acknowledges the</page><page sequence="13">24 • The Langston Hughes Review worksongs which emphasize the special difficulties that living in a white-controlled world bring to relationships between black men and women, but he also renders pos itive the love Pete has for Oceola. It is the white woman's jealousy, couched behind accusations that Pete is using Oceola to forward his medical career, that finally severs Mrs. Ellworth's patronage. Oceola is genuinely sorry for the end and puzzled that white folks could think anyone could "live on nothing but art" (120). Oceola is at once a fully rounded black woman and Hughes' portrait of the artist. Like Hughes himself, she derives her inspiration from her folk roots and transforms her heritage into art. She receives her earliest instruction in music from her step father, whose band played for lodges, dances, and barbecues until he was killed in a knife fight, and her mother, who played the organ in church until the family went trav elling in Billy Kersands' Minstrels. She begins her own musical career by rehearsing a choir for a Sanctified church, disliking the fashionable colored churches where shout ing and movement are discouraged. She inserts variations on the spirituals into a clas sical program even after she has been polished by Philippe and wowed the European critics. She also loves jazz, making good money playing nightly for colored house par ties in Harlem before the period of Mrs. Ellsworth and playing for nothing when she no longer needs the money. She continues to play for the guests at Bricktop's in Paris and refuses to fill her renditions of black folk music with classical runs or fancy falsi ties. Despite her patron's insistence on the dignity of art, Oceola is simply not meant "to stare mystically over the top of a grand piano like white folks and imagine that Beethoven had nothing to do with life, or that Schubert's love songs were only subli mations" (114). For while Oceola has mastered white folks' music, she recognizes that, as a black artist, she must create something of her own. For her, that something comes not from contemplating the stars but from the living and the suffering that have been the experience of her race. As she answers Mrs. Ellsworth's accusation that she knows nothing of life by letting her fingers shift from Beethoven sonatas and Chopin noc turnes to the "soft and lazy syncopation of a Negro blues," she says simply: 'This is mine. . . . Listen! . . . How sad and gay it is. Blue and happy—laughing and crying. . . . How white like you and black like me. . . . How much like a man. . . . And how like a woman. . . . Warm as Pete's mouth. . . . These are the blues. . . . I'm playing." (122) In The Ways of White Folks, Langston Hughes chooses a woman to reveal the secrets of black art: the transformation of suffering into personal and social good, the con version of the folk into beauty.
